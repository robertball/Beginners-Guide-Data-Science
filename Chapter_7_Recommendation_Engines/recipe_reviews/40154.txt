This is so good! I tried the recipe as written the first time and agree that a bit more sauce is needed.  So the second time I made it I increased the sauce ingredients by 1/2 and it was plenty.  I used a prepackaged frozen seafood medley in place of all shrimp and it was wonderful.  I also think the pepper amount was fine.  It is peppery but after all, the recipe is for "Shrimp Lemon PEPPER Linguini".  I can see though how some taste buds might think it is too much pepper.  Overall, this recipe is a winner.  It is definately restaurant quality and definately good enough to serve to company.

Unfortunately, I did not have any linguini on hand and had to use spaghettini.  I strongly do not suggest changing the pasta.  This is truly a recipe best reserved for linguini or any other wide pasta and nothing else.  I will try and use less lemon zest next time since I prefer a more 'shrimpy' taste than a 'lemony' one.  This, of course, is just a personal taste though.  This was an especially tasty recipe and one everyone should try!

Delicious, and EASY. I followed other reviewers suggestions and increased the amount of sauce ingredients and it was perfect. I've made this three times now. The second time I grilled the shrimp on skewers and the third time we used grilled chicken breast in place of the shrimp and it was fabulous.It's very light and perfect for summer. Top it with some fresh grated parmesan cheese and some fresh tomatoes on the side and you have the perfect meal. Thanks for a wonderful recipe skini!

Short and sweet...this was excellent. Enjoyed preparing this nearly as much as I enjoyed eating it. Didn't measure anything (takes the fun out of cooking!), just cooked to my heart's content. Fresh, basic and exquisite ingredients.  Beautiful dish.  Simply perfect.  My tummy is a happy camper tonight.

Really good and really quick!  This was my first time cooking w/ shrimp- and I even cheated!  I bought a big bag of precooked shrimp.  I thawed them in water, them warmed them through in the oil/garlic sauce.  I did not have any wine, just did w/o.  We didn't even miss it!

Very good, very easy...we really enjoyed this one.  The only change I made was to add some capers along with the lemon...so yummy.

I thought the amount of sauce was perfect.  It tasted great, but I have to admit we were sweating pretty soon after we started eating.  I'll definitely make it again, but I'm going to use less pepper next time.

The overall taste of this dish was good.  There was way too much pepper for my husband & me --we had to rinse the food off and start over.  I would recommend adding the salt and pepper to taste and not following the 2tsp given in the recipe.

Honestly, I found the proportions in this recipe inexplicable. First, the ratio of broth to wine and lemon juice seems so off. It tasted awful when I followed those directions: way too much wine and juice, so it tasted very sharp and acidic. I ended up having to add a tbsp of sugar to counteract the acidity. The perfect ratio is 2 cups broth to 1/2 cup wine to 2 tbsps lemon juice. That is more classic and turns out far better. Let that boil down until only half remains. Second, the pepper is great, but the amount is absurd. It is supposed to taste peppery, not set your mouth on fire. I found 1/2 tsp pepper enough to provide a great bite and rich flavor. You can stir in a little cream at the end to make the sauce 'saucier'; it is very runny as written. With the changes, it's good, and it's easy to make.

This recipe is easy to make and it's sure to be a family favorite! There is no need to add or modify anything. If you close your eyes when you take a bite, you will think you are in an italian restaurant. Easily a five star main dish. I get requests to make this regularly!

Very good.  Just tweeked it to our liking, and doubled sauce mixture so there would be plenty of juice for dipping some good crusty Italian bread.  Your linguini will suck up a lot of juice so you really do need to double the amount.  I peeled the shrimp earlier in day and cooked the shells with 1 1/2 cups of water and boiled for 5 minutes with a few twists of cracked pepper.  I used 1/2 cup of shrimp stock and 1/2 cup of pasta water along with the chicken broth and wine.  Very similar to what I've had in good Italian restaurants. I did not use basil instead I used 1 tsp dried oregano.  Also used 2 pinches crushed red pepper flakes, and fresh cracked black pepper only for taste 2 tsp is really overkill. The butter really helps smooth out the taste, and we love the fresh lemony taste you come across every now and then.  The shrimp pick up every flavor.  My husband enjoyed it so much he wants me to use it as a base for mussels the next time.  Lump crabmeat along with the shrimp would be great too.  Thanks.

We simply did not care for this dish.  There was very little flavor even with additional garlic.  I won't be making this again

This sauce blew us away.  You could actually skip the shrimp and just do veggies or chicken or whatever you want.  I added asparagus (just cut up and add to the pasta water 3 to 4 minutes before pasta is done cooking) and I added candy cherry tomatoes from Whole Foods at the end and that really put it over the top.  I also added just a couple of spoons of light sour cream as other reviewers suggested just to thicken it up a bit, although it does thicken nicely after sitting a few minutes.  Oh and definitely double the sauce recipe.  This makes 4 very large servings and is definitely restaurant quality!  Super easy to make but I definitely suggest preparing as much as you can beforehand, because once you get going, it goes very fast!

Two syllables: YUM-MY!. I didn't use the exact measurements of the lemon, white wine and pepper, instead I just went according to taste and doubled the amount of chicken broth. I added 2 Tbsp of Italian bread crumbs to thicken the sauce up a bit. And I added some grated Parmesan as suggested by other reviewers. This is a keeper in my book.

5* very good.  i doubled the sauce, except for the pepper and I didn't have fresh parsley so i used 3 tblsp. dried parsley.  Also, i didn't have linguini and used angel hair and it was perfect, i think linguini would have been too big for this sauce.

Both my husband and I thought this dish was absolutely delicious. I did use closer to 1/2 cup of wine (a Pinot Grigio), and few extra squirts of lemon juice from the plastic squirty bottle. I switched the amounts of parsley and basil, and used only 1/2 tsp. pepper. We added more to taste at the table.
Thanks, skini... this dish is definitely company worthy.

This is an awesome dish!  I added fresh chopped tomatoes and zucchini in at the last step and that seemed to add a great dimension of texture and extra flavor to this dish.  I will make this dish again with the fresh tomatoes and zucchini.

Yummo!  I added boneless skinless chicken breast pieces and sauteed them in the broth mixture as it reduced.  I then added the butter and towards the end, made a thin paste from 1 tbsp cornstarch and a little water to thicken.  WONDERFUL!  Even my picky husband liked it!  :)

One of our favorite pasta dishes! I've made this a couple times now and we absolutely love it. I always double the broth & wine but keep everything else as-is, then let it simmer down to the amount of sauce I want. If I don't have enough parsley, I use more basil & vice versa. Very easy recipe to play with. No complaints and no leftovers with this one! Thanks for a great recipe!

I was really disappointed with this.  The sauce was more the consistency of a white clam sauce, so the juice sunk to the bottom and the shrimp stayed on top.  I also thought it was bland, but sprinkled lemon pepper seasoning on my portion and it tasted much better.

Nice for something different than jarred red sauce on your pasta - and to use up lemons (if your tree is overzealous like mine, haha). I made less pasta because it is just DH and I, but kept the sauce amount the same, so it was very saucy. No cooking wine, so I used all broth, and my shrimp was pre cooked and frozen, so it ended up a little chewy (not the recipes fault). Overall judgement - very zesty and lemony, good for a change of pace, but not for everyday.

Not to take away from this recipe which was fabulous, but I tried it with left over turkey pieces because I had no shrimp and it was very good too.  So if you are looking for something to do with leftovers after Thanksgiving, try this one.  Fabulous reipe, love it  with shrimp

This was delicious.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was that the sauce didn't thicken up quite the way I expected it to and there was not as much lemon flavor as I was expecting, but I have ideas to fix both the next time I make it.  

I will definitely start the sauce earlier, giving it more time to reduce, I get it about 20 min, but it wasn't enough.  I'll also probably add a little more lemon juice, just to punch it up.

As to what other reviewers have said about the pepperieness of the dish...  Don't believe it's overpowering.  It's not.  Yes, there is a pepper flavor, on the strong side, but it is not extrememly spicy or inedible.  You won't have to take a drink after each bite, as I have with some recipes, you just get a pepper flavor to the dish.  Try it as written first, then make changes the next time.  This one is very good as is.

HORRIBLE! I am so sorry, but this recipe is TERRIBLE, and I hate so much to do this, but here it goes. First of all: WAAAYYYYY too much lemon (I used fresh, of course, but too over-powering for the shrimp), TOOO MUCH GARLIC!!!!!!!!!! (please SAVE your precious shrimp).  I LOOOOVVEEE garlic, but WOOOOWWWWWWW, too much, I do NOT like eating garlic by the spoonful, do you?? This is way SOOO disappointing (I LOVE LEMON PEPPER). By the way: doubled the sauce, used fresh herbs, & used premium shrimp.

My husband and I love this recipe.  I find it even better as leftovers the next day.  All of the flavors have been soaking in the pasta all night.

Delicious!  Our whole family of ten loves this!  I like the suggestion to try it with chicken for those times I don't have shrimp on hand.

I really enjoyed this recipe, and so did my fiance. I added a little more olive oil and less butter to make it a little healthier. I also used dried basil and parsley cause I didn't have the fresh, but it came out just fine. Thanks for the great recipe.

wow this is a great recipe!!  I tripled the sauce recipe which made it 18 cloves of minced garlic.. Now.. I'm a HUGE garlic lover so I went with about 12 cloves and it was delish!  I didn't finish the sauce with butter like it says to, instead I used a half bar of cream cheese to make it a creamy,slightly thicker oh and I added capers to give it sort of a picatta look.  DELISH!  will make again!!

I made this according to the directions.  The only thing I didn't have was a lemon.  I used 1/4 cup of lemon juice instead and didn't use the zest at all.  It was delicious.  I think the next time I make it, I'm going to add some chicken breast slices too.  Good recipe.  Thanks!

I also increased the sauce as others suggested by doubling all the sauce ingredients and added: 1 sm jar capers, drained, 1 jar marinated artichoke hearts, drained, and 8 oz of portobella mushrooms, sliced thick. Delicious and easy.

This was wonderful. I did add half more of the recommended white wine and chicken broth. I also used lemon pepper seasoning. I used what was called for on all of the seasonings but I added more as I went along. I also used fresh cracked pepper. Thank you for a great recipe. I am glad I have a new way to cook shrimp.

This is one of my favorite recipes on the site. I like to add crushed red pepper flakes and I usually don't have white wine on hand, so I use more chicken broth. Also, I prefer it without the lemon. I've never been disappointed with this dish.

Made this last night and it was easy to make and delicious. For those who wonder how to stretch the sauce. Add 1/2 cup of the water used to make the pasta into the mix as you are stirring the shrimp into the pasta. 
Also, I added a pinch of red pepper flakes into the sauce to give it a little kick. It was great. Would defintley make this again.

Great recipe!  I ended up adjusting a little bit....I doubled the amounts of the liquids and used chicken instead of shrimp (didn't have any).  I also added one small sliced onioin and a can of artichoke hearts, quartered.  I served it with whole wheat angel hair pasta.  Go easy on the salt, if using the artichokes.  Smelled like an Italian restaurant while it was cooking and it was delish!

This recipe has a magical Something that makes it become much more than the sum of its parts. I double everything except the butter and shrimp (I have a tendency to reduce the amount of butter in anything I cook, so that may not be for everyone.) I brought some to my parents' house, and a few hours later my mother called and said "I NEED that recipe!!". Five stars. Easy and delicious AND classy.

This is very delicious! I doubled the white wine and chicken broth and did not use as much pepper as the recipe called for ! I made this before I went to work, came home 4 hours later and reheated it on the stove . It tasted great as the sauce had thickened. I will make this again soon!

Simple & delicious...even my picky kids liked it!  To lower fat & cholesterol, I  used half the volume of shrimp (it was plenty) & slightly less butter. I followed the recipe for sauce closely (did not make extra), & made the following changes: 1) subbed half the quantity of dried basil & parsley for fresh 2) subbed 1/2 tsp lemon pepper for the 2 tsp black pepper 3) added 1/2 tsp cornstarch to thicken the sauce 4) added a little extra garlic (we love it) 5) added 1/2 tsp salt 6) added 1 tbsp parmesan 7) added 2 tbsp capers.   Used frozen, pre-cooked, de-veined salad shrimp & thawed them quickly with hot water in the strainer, then poured pasta right over the top to strain off boiling water.  Put linguini / shrimp mixture back in pot, then poured sauce over the top, mixing well.  Served with a crisp tossed salad...YUM!!!!  Thanks for the awesome recipe skini!

Great recipe. A lot of recipes have too much butter and that's all you taste. This one has a lot of flavor. I used a Chardonnay. I did add a pinch of red pepper flakes, a tablespoon of capers and a jar of artichokes. But this recipe is still great without all that. I would definitely double the sauce.

This is absolutely delicious - very lemony and fresh tasting.  I made with 1 tsp pepper and will use 2 as listed next time.  YUMMY!

This was very good.  I made a low fat version, deleting the butter.  I would probably give it 4 stars the way I made it, but considering how much richer it would have tasted with the butter, I'm giving it 5 stars.  Still, it was worth it to me to save on the fat and calories.  I also added some spinach which was delicious.  The dish had a very fresh flavor and my entire family enjoyed it.  I doubled the sauce and used an entire box of pasta.

I love this recipe! Tastes like something you would find at olive garden. I substituted the white wine with the same amount of dilluted white wine vinegar, just went an 8th cup of the vinegar and an 8th cup of water.  Turned out great! I also found it to yeild plenty of sauce the way I made it.  Definitely a favorite.

While the overall dish was pretty good, all I really wanted to do was soak up the sauce with my garlic bread.  It was delicious!  I'm thinking about making the sauce just for bread dipping next time!

YUMMY!!!    I used angel hair pasta, skipped the parsley, cut the butter in half, added fresh cut asparagus, and stirred in fresh parmesan cheese to finish.  I also saved a bit of the pasta water before draining in case I needed it for the sauce. Easy and delicious!

You may also add some Lemon Balm, a spice that adds some depth to the lemon flavor without overpowering the flavors. Scampi is a house (and my wife's favorite)  around here. Enjoy!

It was good, but it wasn't great. With the high reviews I was expecting something more. I agree with other reviewers that you need to make more sauce for the recommended amount of pasta (the amount of shrimp was good though). The sauce was much better on the shrimp but lacked luster on the pasta.  It seems to be a good base and I plan on altering it bit with some spice. No plans to make again "by the book" though.

I am only giving this four stars because the pepper was overpowering.  I love lemon pepper, but i also like to taste the lemon in a good dose, too--and my mouth was burning for awhile there was so much pepper.  So I will definitely make it again, but I will reduce the pepper and I didn't use the full amount of butter and it was great still.

Not impressed. I guess I was expecting a little more of a creamy stlye alfredo like sauce.. but it was thin and watery and didn't have much flavor. I'll keep searching for a better recipe.

This was so good! The only thing I left out was chicken broth. I learned from the pros on tv to use the pasta water, it has the starch to thicken your sauce. I added zucchini to the mix to get a vegetable in. It was perfect. I squeezed fresh lemon juice on top of the pasta right before serving & added shredded parm cheese. I served "double tomato bruschetta" from AR with my pasta. Perfect with a glass of Reisling.

not at all impressed. bland (except for the flavor of lemon & chicken broth) and boring. reminded me of avgolemno - and it wasn't soup that I wanted to be reminded of. really expected a lot more from this recipe because of the reviews. apparently this site has a lot of users that are *really* easily pleased.

This was wonderful - even my 2 year old liked it!  I made a few minor changes:  I used the shrimp shells and a few tablesppons of water in a measuring cup in the microwave to make some impromptu shrimp stck instead of chicken broth.  I didn't have a lemon for zest, so I added a bit more lemon juice just before serving to brighten it up.  FANTASTIC!

I made this for dinner last night and the whole famly loved it! I followed the recipe exactly but didn't have wine so I added extra chicken stock. I also doubled the sauce as suggested by others and it was simply perfect, definately restaurant quality. I will be making this often.

This was a wonderful light dish for the summer. It has very little prep time, especially if you buy shrimp that are already de-headed and -de-vained. My only problem was that it wasn't lemony enough for me but I did have a pretty small lemon. Next time I would use a big lemon or even two smaller ones. I also need to say that I did not use 2 teaspoons of pepper but I peppered to taste. I probably use about 1/4 of a teaspoon. Pair this dish with a nice salad, crusty bread and a lovely chardonnay and you've got yourself a great dinner for entertaining.

This is a super recipe...I changed a couple of things because I wanted a "lemon-garlic charred  flavor"  so I grilled the shrimp and used the sauce as a baste... which used up all my sauce so I made a second batch of sauce (knowing this in the future you can just double the sauce and use 1/2) and cooked the linguine in it...I also increased the amount of garlic.  This turned out absolutely great!!!  This gets even better after it sits in the sauce, so it's even better the next day for leftovers.

Loved this recipe!  We used about 8 cloves of garlic, extra wine, the zest of the entire lemon, and more chopped basil (probably about 3T.)  We'll probably vary the recipe a little each time--but it's a keeper however it is modified.

I could only give this 4 stars because my son said he thought it was too lemony. I thought it was just right. It's not called Lemon Pepper for nothing. Very tangy and peppery. I did add more liquid ingredients as it seemed to need more sauce. Other than that, this was very satisfying.

This was a sensational recipe!  I've made it twice, both times omitting the lemon zest and using dry herbs rather than fresh.  I believe that fresh would enhance the flavor, but I had none on hand.   The recipe is very low maintenance, as the shrimp cook in only three to five minutes.  The sauce is very easy to make, with only a few flavorful ingredients.  I suggest this when you want to impress, but have little time to work in the kitchen.  Delicious. It will reheat okay in the microwave at a low power.

This was very delicious and I really only made a few changes.  I added 1 1/2 c. heavy cream to the sauce, as well as a cup or so of parm. cheese.  I also added bay scallops in addition to the shrimp.  To taste I added garlic poweder at the end.  Because of the increased sauce, I used a full pound of pasta.

I'm not a fan of shrimp, but even I liked this & my family loved it!  It looks and smells wonderful, and is pretty easy to make.  The only thing I had to do differently was add about 2 tbs of flour to thicken the sauce.  Also, I would recommend cooking the pasta last, not first.  Other then that, a great recipe!

As written it came out too dry and too lemony. So, I made a second (double) batch of  the sauce part, and added veggies (brocolli & carrot slices)and (bite size)chicken: seasoned with (McCormick) Lemon & Herbs. I also preferred to use thinner Angel Hair pasta. Mixed all when done, in the dutch oven (I cooked the pasta in)and let sit on low for 5 minutes to let the pasta soak up the (thin)sauce and then topped with shaved Parmesan. Definitely will make again. Thank you, for the basic recipe!

This is an excellent, easy fix. It didn't take me nearly as long to prepare as the recipe suggests because I cooked the noodles as I prepared the sauce simultaneously.

Very good!  Tasted right out of your favorite Italian restaurant.  Doubled the sauce, use Pam instead of EVOO and cut the butter in half to make healthier.  I made with shrimp for my husband and chicken for me.  Will be on the monthly menu.  Delish!!

Really good recipe!! Although I did a few things different because I was too lazy to go to the store! Instead of lemon I used lime b/c thats all I had. I used fettucini instead of linguine. I used cooked shrimp. I did not have white wine so I doubled the amount of chicken broth. I also decreased the amount of pepper 1tsp and a half. I increased the amount of butter by two tbs. Since I did not have fresh basil I used dry. It was really good and I will def make it again! Thanks!! :)

Excellent recipe! I doubled the sauce per other users suggestions and it was the perfect amount. I used a bag of raw frozen shrimp and thawed them under running water in the sink.   My only issue was the amount of pepper, we felt it was too spicy but that may just be our personal preference. Next time I will double everything for the sauce except the pepper.   Over all, we loved this recipe and will be making it again!

There is not a lot of recipes I can't eat, but this was one of them.  WAY to much pepper.  It's all I could taste and it made it very unpleasant to eat.  Sorry.

This was a lot tastier than I thought it would be!  I added some half and half and parmesan at the end to "alfredo" it up a bit.  It would've been great without it though.  Very great combo of pepper and lemon.  I added some crushed red pepper flakes on mine when serving.  Thanks for a keeper.

This one is definitely a 5 star.  My favorite meal.  I use angel hair pasta and add onions and red pepper to the pan and saute a little before adding the broth mixture. Tehn when liquid is reduced I add the shrimp for a couple of minutes.  Mix in the pasta and serve wtih parmesan cheese.  Delicious.  I do not add the butter at the end, too much fat and certainly not needed.  Takes a good healthy meal and turns into a higher fat meal.  I also double all my liquids.

This was really good and so simple to prepare!  My family enjoyed it very much, and I have a 15-yr-old and four-year-old.  The only changes I made were to double the sauce ingredients except for the butter, used 16 oz. of linguine, and a pound and a half of shrimp.  Otherwise, I followed it to a T.  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe.  We will definitely be making it again!!

Really good!  I too tripled the sauce and also thickened it just a tad. In addition to the shrimp, we decided to add clams to this dish and instead of the chicken broth, we added the broth from the steamed clams. Great vacation or anytime meal. Thanks Skini!!

Tried this last night with some sauteed spinach on the side, and both my boyfriend and I really enjoyed it. I will note that although the recipe says "1 package" of pasta, it also says "8 oz"...which, for many of us shopping in the grocery store, is actually 1/2 of a normal (1 lb) package of Barilla linguine. I wonder if that is why some people have noticed there wasn't enough sauce? Perhaps they used a full pound of pasta instead of 8oz? Just a thought. I certainly had enough sauce, even after reducing the wine mixture. Also, I found that using the juice of 1 average lemon made the dish overpoweringly lemony and blocked out the other flavors. I think in the future I may use 1/2 lemon and add a bit more broth to compensate for the lost liquid.

I'll make this again for sure, with those slight alterations. :)

This is an excellent, tasty pasta recipe when made as written.  I have made a few changes, based on other reviews, my experiences and my family's preferences.  1.  I sautéed 12 oz sliced white mushrooms in the heated olive oil before adding the garlic.  2.  I used chicken stock instead of broth (it's richer and tastier), and doubled the amount of white wine and stock to yield more sauce.  3.  I reduced the amount of black pepper to 1/2 tsp and I added 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes to give it more kick.  4.  I used frozen cooked shrimp which I thawed, then threw into the pasta water for the last 30 seconds of cooking time.  After I drained the pasta and shrimp, I added the sauce and tossed it together.  Parmesan was served on the side, for anyone who wanted it, but it doesn't really need it.  This was very tasty, not too lemony at all!  And I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for a great recipe, skini!

Great flavor!  I used 12 oz shrimp and 4 oz pasta and left the rest of the measurements the same; there was plenty of sauce this way.

Ohmigosh! This was SOOOO good!!! Not only was this SUPER easy to prepare, it packed a MAJOR flavor punch! Sometimes less is more and this fantastic recipe is proof of that! Other than subbing bowtie pasta for linguini (personal preference), I made no changes. This is simply superb as is - the amount of lemon and pepper are spot on and complement each other nicely, IMHO. I'm regretting that this sat in my recipe box for so long. Rest assured, it will be a repeat many times over at my house! Thanks for sharing, skini. :-)

Good recipe. I added a small crate of halved grape tomatoes to the olive oil and garlic, and a minced shallot. I also added a can of whole baby clams and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Like many others, I doubled the broth ingredients, with the exception of the butter and herbs. I also reduced the black pepper by at least half if not more, because I found the red pepper to be an excellent addition to the flavor of the dish. I wanted to taste the seafood, and didn't want those flavors overwhelmed by either the lemon or the pepper. They were noticeable, but were complimentary rather than overbearing. Will definitely make this again.

Absolutely fantastic! We loved this recipe!!! Like a lot of other posters, I doubled the sauce to ensure we had enough for dipping crusty bread then I served this with a fresh salad, crusty bread and a nice Chardonnay. Great meal and thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! I did double the sauce though. I put half the pepper in and told my husband to add more pepper on his serving. I only had cooked shrimp on hand, so I added these at the very last to warm them. I would have liked to use fresh herbs too, but had to go with dried. It was still wonderful and will definitely make again. Thanks!

OMG!!! This is the first time I made this recipe and it was out of this world!! I read some of the other reviews about how they changed this and changed that. All I can say is that they were right about that. I used 3/4cup of reduced-sodium chicken broth and 1/3cup of white wine (I used Barefoot Moscato). I also only used about 1tsp of black pepper. I reduced the sauce about 1/4 instead of a 1/2 and that made all the difference. My husband loved it so much that he practically eat it all!! I HIGHLY recommend this recipe to any and all that love seafood (shrimp) and pasta. Manga! I will definitely be adding this recipe to my dinner arsenal. Simply love it!!!

Loved how quickly this came together for a simple and delicious weeknight meal! I had a box of shells open, so I just used those. Otherwise, followed the directions and ended up with a perfectly flavored dinner tonight! I loved the light lemon flavor and the freshness from the herbs (though, I'd use a good quality dried herb in a pinch). This will be a go-to for a quick dinner, and is certainly worthy of being served to guests!

I would definitely increase the liquid ingredients next time by about 50%, but otherwise, this was absolutely delicious. Moderate amount of prep work, but totally worth it.

This is great. Had to make a few changes because I didn't have alot of the ingredients. Used 1 TBS and 1 tsp of Lemon pepper (rather than lemon zest), no salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 3/4 cup chicken broth with a TBS of white vinegar (instead of white wine), a little more lemon juice and it was AMAZING!

This is a great seafood pasta, but too much pepper was used. I agree the sauce must be doubled, and will use 1&1/2 teaspoon of pepper next time.

I've made this recipe twice and didn't really love it either time. I made it again thinking perhaps the first time I did something wrong but it tasted the same. It's just a bit bland.

It was good and easy to make.  I didn't find that there was enough lemon taste so next time I would add more zest.

Two of us thought it was one of the best things we tasted in a long time.  Strangely, my 3 teenagers didn't like it at all.  I made up a little more of the sauce and fresh shrimp to coat the leftover noodles for dinner tonight and what we thought was the best, just got better.  My hubby and I will be enjoying this many times over for those candle lit dinners.  Enjoy your KD kids.  Great served with balsamic Bruschetta 
and a nice salad.  Don't forget the rest of the bottle of wine you put back in the fridge.  Magnificent!

My wife and 5 year old son both loved it... I used angle hair pasta instead of linguine and frozen/thawed shrimp instead of fresh, just because it's what I had on hand.

Added 1 red pepper, sliced,  1 cubed zucchini,  and 1/2 cup defrosted frozen peas to broth liquids while it is being reduced.
Substituted 4 tilapia fillets, cut into 1-2" pieces in place of the shrimp.  Added the tilapia pieces with the butter, parsley and basil into the reduced sauce.  
Cooked until tilapia was cooked through.
Added 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese; stirred till blended.
Stir in cooked linguine and cook until heated through
Either the original or revised recipes are excellent!

One of my favorite meals.  I make it with whole wheat spaghetti because that is what I always have.  I also use extra chicken broth instead of the wine because I don't keep wine here.  I didn't think I would like that much pepper so I just added pepper to taste.  I used dried parsley since it's all I had, and no basil around but I'm sure it would be awesome.  Also I started with quite a bit more olive oil because I like my sauces to taste a bit more like the oil than the butter.  Goes perfectly with steamed broccoli!

This was delicious, and very easy to prepare.  I added 8 oz. fresh mushrooms and half of a red bell pepper, just to get some veggies in there.  You could add anything really - I'd like to try asparagus with cherry tomatoes next time.  I used dried herbs, and only 1 teaspoon black pepper.  It could use a little more sauce, and I may try to decrease the butter next time.  Very tasty!

Wow, what a great dish!  I forgot to get shrimp so I used chicken and it was still fabulous!  I think it would be even better with shrimp and will try that sometime in the future.  Perfect Lemon Pepper sauce, I made exactly as directed and it is my new favorite.  Worth the effort!

Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow! Who would think something this simple could be this good? My husband is not a fan of a seafood pasta dish, and he absolutely RAVED about this dish, and asked for it "once a week." The second time I forgot the butter, and it was STILL amazing!

I just made this today. For the first time it actually taste great. I did double the sauce like others suggested. I boiled a 16oz box of linguini and the sauce covered it all. Made a nice pot size. I did not add wine but will try next time to see if it brings a different taste.

I made this recipe exactly as described. It was excellent!  Next time I might cut down on the butter, use less shrimp or use more pasta.  We had a lot of shrimp and not much pasta. My husband who is not wild about linguini noodles even said this was really good!

I have made this recipe several times now and I have created a "veggified" version that blends out a little the strength of the lemon -it's a lot of lemon-  In a wok, heat up some oil, and saute over medium-high heat a medium onion, a zucchini, and a red pepper all cut into bite-size pieces.  Season with salt and some garlic powder.  Set aside.  Then make the dish as stated in the now-heated wok, and when you add the pasta, toss these veggies back in as well.  It makes a Great, tasty dish.

I made this after reading the reviews and decided to use 1/2 tsp pepper to start and I doubled the sauce ingredients. It was perfect... garlicy but light with a hint of spice.Excellent taste. Next time I'm going to try using some crushed red pepper too. Cant wait to have company over

This recipe was super easy to put together. I substituted chicken for the shrimp only because I didn't have shrimp on hand. The flavor was amazing! I will make this again!!

Very tasty. Simple to make, easy ingredients and great fresh flavors. Tasted great, had enough portions, noodles, and sauce for the two of us tonight. I served this along with Italian Herb Bread I from this website and basil butter.

Very easy and delicious recipe!!  I took another reviewer's suggestion and increased the sauce ingredients by half.  I also omitted the salt and added a chicken bouillion cube.  I highly recommend using fresh basil if you can, and absolutely top with shredded parmesan.  Also, I used whole wheat linguine and my husband and I couldn't even tell the difference - it was just light and wonderful!

I like this recipe - have used it several times now and it always turns out well.  So simple and a nice recipe to be creative with, even tho' it's fine as it is.
I've added mushroom and use cooked frozen shrimp (thawed) and it still turns out lovely.
Careful not to overcook the shrimp - just heat in sauce if you use cooked shrimp.

FANTASTIC! I'm not a fan of the bitter wine taste so I omitted and added a full cup of broth. A hefty squeeze of lemon was enough zing for me so I left out the zest. Seasoned with granulated garlic and onion flakes as well. Added two handfuls of spinach to the garlic sauté in the beginning stage and a delightful recipe is born!

Ummm, wow!!  SO delicious and so simple.  My mother-in-law said, 'restaurant quality'.  I doubled the sauce ingredients as suggested, but not the lemon.  Pepper...just to taste...definitely no where near the 2 tsp...and I used equal amounts of fresh basil and parsley.  I also topped the finished product with freshly grated parmesan.  Perfect, and loved by all :)

Really good and easy to make!! Definitely make more sauce or your pasta will be dry. I only salt & pepper to taste and therefore avoided the issue others had with the amount of pepper. The lemon flavor was a bit over-powering (my lemon was a large one) so to correct this, I added about a tablespoon of Rondele garlic & herbs (white) cheese spread which can be found in the dairy section near all the cheeses. The cheese spread counterbalanced the lemon taste and thickened the sauce a bit as I don't like thin sauce. Other than this one addition and omitting the basil because I didn't have any, I followed the recipe. The lemon flavor did add a nice kick. Very good. Will make again!!

Excellent! Easy to make.  Instead of linguini I cooked up some penne, other than that, I followed the recipe exact.  Fantastic with some garlic bread and a salad.

Great!  I sautéed an onion  for about ten minutes before adding the garlic.  I also didn't have fresh parsley, so I threw in a bag of fresh spinache and let it cook down with the liquids.  Delicious and simple!  From start to finish, it took the same time as cooking the pasta!!!

Oh man, this is good. As a newlywed on a budget, I used dried basil that we already had and the frozen shrimp that is already peeled with the tails off. Added fresh ground pepper, salt, and lemon zest to taste since some people said it was too peppery for them. Even with my shortcuts, it was still AWESOME! My husband and I made the Red Pepper Biscuits (also on this site) to go with it and it was like Red Lobster date night at home. thanks for the great recipe! :)

This is an excellent recipe. I was out of basil so I put in dried thyme and extra parsley. I also like it more spicy so I added red pepper flakes in with the garlic/ oil. It was absolutely fantastic. I didn't need to double the sauce either. I thought it was perfect as is.

I followed this recipe exactly...cept I used wheat pasta. I also used just as much basil as parsley, bc I love the flavor of basil.  This was light and bursting with flavor, even my 6 yr old ate it right up.  I did cut the pepper just slightly, bc I was scared my daughter wouldn't eat it.  I also had plenty of sauce, no need to double.  Will definitely make this again!

This recipe was very very lemon-y. We mad it tonight and the shrimp turned out wonderfully, maybe the sauce could be used as a marinade, or cut down on the lemon and it would be good.

This is a good pasta. I like a lot of sauce... Therefore I would recommend doubling the sauce mixture, yet decreasing the amount of basil and parsley. Overall, it was a very good pasta. Thanks!

Excellent taste. Different than the usual, and my hubby said to put this on the list of recipes to make again! I made as is, no changes to report. Tasty, light tasting, not too lemony, and I'm craving it again.

I just have to start by saying that I love it when a recipe with such few ingredients and little prep and cook time comes out tasting so elegant and delicious!  my 11yr. old son who loves to know what's for dinner and if i got it off allrecipes and how many stars it had said this. "Mom, this is the BEST pasta I've ever had" Mom: " gee that's odd since we're Italian & eat a ton of pasta".  Son: " on a scale of 1 to 5 when you are rating this tonight, i give it at least a 20"  So there you go, and i'm just finishing mine up and writing this before i forget.  I will serve this to guests for many reasons but mostly because it's easy, and yummy.  i can have this on a plate fast and talk with my company the rest of the time which is nice when entertaining!

YUM. So delicious and easy. I don't drink, so I subbed a chopped tomato to add a little brightness and sweetness and I didn't miss the wine at all.

This didn't thrill me.  Whenever I see such high ratings I have very high expectations.  My husband thought it was too lemon-y and I felt that it was a little bland, so I guess it's all a matter of personal taste.  You definitely need to double the sauce though!

Quite excellent, as a simple staple recipe. I didn't think it was too lemony at all. (Did those who found it too lemony not reduce the liquid, so the flavors meld together?) I didn't have white wine, and just added extra chicken stock, and it was very tasty.

I am adding on to my original review!  We have had this MANY times in our house and it never, ever fails to turn out perfectly!  

This is by far one of the best recipes I have found for shrimp.  Simple ingredients, no complicated cooking and the results are outstanding - thanks for sharing!

Light and flavorful, it's the perfect way to prepare shrimp!  I didn't change much, except for using only 1 tsp. pepper, making it noticeable but not overpowering for us.  I also didn't have fresh basil, so I used 1 tsp. dried.  I used unsalted butter and then added about 1/2 tsp. salt.  Served it sprinkled with parmesan cheese.  I wouldn't change anything else about this recipe - it's wonderful!

This is a wonderful, quick recipe, but I agree with other reviewers who found it too lemony.  I think that the problem is the vague--juice of one lemon--listed in the ingredients.  The second time I made this I used 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice and that seemed to work well.  I did double the sauce--chicken stock and wine--as another reviewer suggested.  To thicken the sauce I added a little corn starch.

Excellent dish! I used whole wheat linguine which seemed to work well. I used the amount of sauce mix called for but unlike some other reviews found it an adequate amount. I don't see this as a sauce heavy dish. Next time I will cut back on the pepper... or maybe not use freshly ground; the pepper flavor did seem a bit much.  (Has anyone tried it with packaged pepper? how was it? If you used less fresh-ground pepper what is the right amount? thanks)

Delicious. We made this for valentine's day dinner. I'm a fan of alfredo sauce and thought I would miss the thick creaminess of that, since this recipe's sauce is a lot thinner. Was not at all disappointed, excellent flavor, simple and delicious. The wine cooks off and just leaves the perfect trace flavors.

I needed SOMETHING to do with a pound of shrimp tonight and I am SOOOO glad I found this recipe!  DELISH!  Easy as pie, ingredients we always have on hand and quick!  What more could we ask for!  I increased the sauce by a bit because I made an entire pound of linguine and it was more than enough.  Thank you so much!

An update - I used this sauce with cut up boneless chicken over rice and it was out of this world!  I flour & brown the chicken in some olive oil; put it on the side to make the sauce then add the chicken back to cook in the sauce for a little bit - serve over brown rice and viola!  Delish Dinner!  Enjoy!

This was very good. I thought it was going to be absolutely awful looking after I added the pepper and suddenly was simmering a black sauce instead of a lemony yellow one, but it didn't look gross at all once the pasta was tossed with it. We enjoyed this quite a bit, but doubling the recipe meant I put an entire stick of butter into the sauce--yikes! Not sure I'll make this again as I usually reserve my entire-stick-of-butter recipes for things like alfredo :) Still glad we tried it, we both thought it was great!

I doubled the sauce and actually cut down on the garlic thinking it would be too much but next time I will use the proper amount as it isn't as strong as I imagined.  The sauce seemed to be very liquidy but after I added the linguine and let it sit for a short while it all got absorbed.  The dish was delicious and even though I made a massive amount there was nothing left over, very tasty!

The four-star rating is for the recipe as written, because I did have to change the amount of pepper (two teaspoons is too much for us--we almost died the first time I made this) and double the amount of sauce (my family doesn't like dry pasta).  I love the flavors--especially with all the lemon that I doubled, and it goes very well with capellini.  The cooking time for the shrimp is right on the mark.  I love having leftover pasta like this for my lunch!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was super amazingly good.  I agree with everyone else about doubling the sauce amount.  Lemon butter with seafood... what more could you ask for?  The lemon was really strong, and I would recommend halving the amount the recipe calls for.  And definitely, definitely add SCALLOPS!

This was like something you would find in a great restaurant! Entire family loved it.  I saved some of the water after cooking the Liguini and added to the Liquini and shrimp mixture, thicken up the sauce a bit.
Thanks

This was extremely good! I subbed chicken for shrimp. I doubled the sauce and reduced the pepper by half as suggested by another member. I added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce. The rest of the recipe, I made as written. I served this with grated parmesan cheese.

Very good. My craving was fulfilled. I followed the recipe as written except for no wine as didn't have any - I upped the chicken broth to take its place. I was generous with the garlic and parsley and used just slightly less pepper. All the flavours jump out of this dish. Love the addition of lemon zest. I found the pasta sauce ratio just fine. Thank you - my dinner was a great success.

HOLY PEPPER BAT MAN!
GEEZ!
I would AT LEAST half the pepper.
We couldn't taste the rest of the ingredients.  Plus, my 5 year old wouldn't eat it (and she usually loves nearly everything I cook).  Though... my 2 year old ate gleefully (without the shrimp) -- so go figure.
I may make it again... but adjusting the seasoning to our tastes.

Mmm, so good! I have a jar of dehydrated lemon zest that I keep handy, so I used double the amount of zest and no juice. I also doubled the liquid portions as suggested, and ended up with the perfect amount of sauce. We substituted mussels for shrimp, and it was absolutely divine!

Absolutely loved it!!  I used the ready to cook shrimp, and marinated it in chef paul prudhomme's seafood magic seasoning.  It made the shrimp have a great flavor.  Will definately do several more times!!

Rave reviews from everybody!

I would suggest doubling the shrimp though.

I also kicked it up a bit with cayenne pepper just to make it a wee bit more interesting

Giving benefit of the doubt and rating 5 stars because I did not have any parsley; also doubled sauce, but cut back on the butter. If I had done a straight double of everything, would probably have been a 5.   This was easy, quick, and delicious. I used Lemon Pepper Pappardelle pasta from Trader Joe's. Added a pinch of red pepper flakes, too.  I have had better in restaurants, but have also had much worse. This is a good, reliable recipe. Will add this to my permanent recipe box.

Excellent sauce. Not to heavy and the lemon flavor isn't overpowering. If you're not a fan of super peppery flavors, don't pass this up; you can reduce the pepper to suit your tastes. It's worth it!

This is absolutely delicious and easy to make. I used a pound of linguini, 1/2 cup of wine, a 14.5 oz can of chicken broth, 2 pounds of frozen shrimp de-thawed, and pepper to taste. It makes 8 normal size servings or 4 large pasta bowl servings. It makes excellent left overs that can be heated in the micowave. Makes sure to use fresh lemon, basil, and parsley.

Yummy!  I doubled the sauce as everybody suggested and it turned out wonderful!  I also added red pepper for more color.  I would definitely make this again.

This. Was. AWESOME.  I doubled everything (half a box of pasta might be 4 servings "ideally" but let's be realistic here!!).  The only substitution I made was that I used sea scallops for half of the amount of shrimp.  I was skeptical about the amount of garlic and parsley it called for but I followed the recipe exactly anyway, and I'm so glad I did!  The garlic was not overpowering like I thought it might be.  I actually overcooked the sauce just a little bit but just added more broth and wine to make up for it and it was still phenomenal.  I will definitely be making this again!

This came out just perfect!! No complaints from me. I had just the right amount of sauce unlike some other reviewers. I also agree that it tastes gourmet. We served ours with broiled salmon, green beens, and french bread. I followed directions exactly accept for using only one tsp of black pepper because mine was finely ground, and I used diluted white wine vinegar in place of the white wine. Will no doubt make again and keep this in my prize recipe box!

I made the following changes, mainly because I can't easily get fresh ingredients: frozen shrimp, dried basil, no parsley, no lemon zest, chicken boullion cube + water instead of broth.  I reduced the amount of pepper to less than a tsp because I don't eat spicy.  Next time I will double the sauce because the pasta absorbed it all quickly.  Delicious meal even with the adjustments.  Key step for success: pour yourself a glass of the white wine to enjoy while cooking!

Good, but I would add 1/2 a teaspoon less pepper...a little too spicy.

Definitely good stuff!  I ended up adding another half stick of butter because I didn't feel like there was enough sauce.  Excellent tasting though!

I modified this recipe with great success! I added spring onion (green onion) with the garlic and green beans (cut into 1" pieces) just before adding the liquids. The only herb I have is corindar (cilantro) which I substituted for the others, adding some dried basil. I added fresh ginger and chili powder to spice it up. Delicious!

This dish was a little too "dry" for me and I even used less linquini. The taste was there but needed something like pecorino romano cheese or red pepper for flavor.

This simple & easy recipe is elegant & delicious! Even my 2 y.o. loved it! We finished the leftovers for breakfast! Thanks for sharing! This will be a staple in our meal rotation. We served it with parmesan cheese & a luigi round of bread warmed in the oven! SO GOOD!

Way too much pepper in my opinion.  Otherwise, the other flavors compliment the shrimp nicely.

Soooooo good!  Worth trying, and I don't even like shrimp.  I made it for my husband who's favorite food is shrimp, he loved it, I loved it.  I can't wait to share the recipe with my friends and family.  This one is going into my recipe book for sure.

SO easy & light!  I even cut back on the butter and used dried crushed basil (instead of fresh) and it turned out really nice.  I imagine it would be delicious with some capers.

FABULOUS!! I doubled the sauce, used,  pepper to taste only & used all chicken broth instead of white wine. It was fantastic; even my finicky husband who normally is turned off by anything new loved it. Next time I'll use grilled chicken breast instead of shrimp, & maybe add some zucchini & squash. This is so much like the taste of Olive Garden's Chicken Giardano, only better.I had been trying to duplicate their lemon sauce, & this is it. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was excellent!  I went easy on the pepper as others had suggested, and it turned out perfect.  Great base sauce...could be used with chicken and vegetables if you don't like shrimp.

Delicious, I too used frozen shrimp, and 1 1/2 times the sauce. The family really enjoyed it. I can see how this recipe would be a good base recipe for chicken instead of shrimp as well.

This is a definite keeper!  I added much less pepper and tripled the sauce.  I also used 3 lbs of shrimp and added a little crushed red pepper.  And the funniest thing is my husband thought he was doing me a favor by having the shrimp steamed so they had Old Bay on them but I said, "What the heck?"  It turned out delicious.  Didn't have linguine so I used spaghetti.

I really liked the lemony/buttery taste of the sauce in combination with the shrimp and pasta. It was easy, (done in about 15 minutes) and relatively healthy too. I used FAR less black pepper than is called for in this recipe. I followed the other reviews that said the pepper was too strong, and just added the pepper near the end of cooking according to my tastes. I also cut down just a bit on the butter. It was very tasty. I will be making this again and again...

We love this. We substitute the linguini with spiralized zucchini. We flash fry the zucchini in a pan with a little Pam and some salt and pepper. Then we put the zucchini noodles in the pan with the shrimp for a couple minutes before plating. The zucchini will cook down quickly if left on the heat too long. We have made this with and without the wine and usually substitute cilantro for the basil and parsley. It’s delicious!

I've made a few other lemon shrimp linguini recipes and this is so far my favorite and easiest. The lemon flavor is the perfect amount. My only negative towards the original recipe would be that I would actually prefer fewer shrimp and more noddles and maybe add some other veggies like snow peas. However, my rating is for the actual written recipe. (I hate when people change stuff then say it wasn't that great...seriously, stop it)

I was really looking forward to this dish and it came up short. With the combo of lemon juice and zest plus the amount of garlic I was looking for a lot of flavor, and I didn't get that. The pepper overpowered all of the garlic and shrimp taste and had the lemon flavor feeling hidden. I will make this again but will half the pepper and hope the flavors balance each other better.

Very tasty, came out more shrimp tasting then lemony and I agree with other reviews that the sauce should be increased. Add a touch more stock and wine and that should do it. You really do need a lot of garlic, 4 very large cloves or 6 small will do it. I also added red pepper flakes. Wait to add the parsley and basil til after the shrimp is done to avoid discoloring or wilting.

I added mushrooms and red peppers to the sauce and used dried parsley and basil and cut the pepper by one-half.  I also used pre-cooked shrimp (I had it on hand) that I thawed, removed the tails and added right at the end of cooking.   This is an excellent basic recipe that you can change to suit what you have on hand.  I might add some red pepper flakes next time.

This was so good. I will definitely make it again. In hindsight, I guess I made quite a few changes. I limit my saturated fat, so my splash of olive oil for sautéing the garlic was more like 2-3 Tablespoons, and I used a scant 1T. instead of 1/4 cup of butter. I didn't have fresh basil, so used 1t. dry instead of 1T. fresh.  I also used cooked shrimp instead of fresh, so Only threw that in the simmering lemon/broth/wine liquid with th linguine to heat through.. I have bad wrists and got tired of grinding the fresh pepper after 1/2. t. and added just an additional 1/2 t. Of already ground pepper because it is so much finer. I figured that would be plenty and it WAS. 
And lastly,  my garlic cloves were HUGE, so I only used 3 instead of the 6.

I never have fresh parsley or basil, except during N.E. Summer months. I will make again, it's that good, and see if there's a taste difference between dry and fresh herbs. Otherwise, I change nothing ... the recipe is perfect.

This was so delicious!  I made a few changes based on the reviews and my preference of taste.  I used a package  of spinach linguine and pretended it was a vegetable. I increased the sauce ingredients by half and the amount of sauce was perfect but I did not increase the pepper, in fact I only used 1 tsp for the whole dish and I did not increase the garlic or butter.   I also mixed the chicken broth, wine, lemon juice, lemon zest, salt, and pepper in a bowl before hand so I didn't have to scramble to add all the ingredients.

This is an ok recipe at best. I didnt have shrimp so i subsituted with dog food. Also I was short fresh parsley. I added grass from the front yard to ensure freshness. 
Unfortunately I can only give this recipe two stars, It really was not all that good.

I made this exactly as written--before reading any reviews--and it was phenomenal! My fiance and I had two bowls each and ate it right up! Personally there was plenty of sauce--and I'm a saucy gal. I don't feel it is meant to be poured over the pasta or for there to be a ton of it. It is more like a glaze, but a hearty and tasty one!

As I said, we loved it, but if you have someone who is sensitive to spice, you may want to cut back on the pepper just a bit!

Finally, I made this with fresh store-bought pasta and I feel like it really made it shine!

Fantastic! Quick and easy dish I would be proud to serve to guests. The flavor of the sauce is even big enough to hold up to whole wheat pasta. I changed nothing and will definitely make again. Can sub Greek yogurt for butter to save 84 calories/10g fat per serving.

Yummy flavor. I wasn't quite paying attention though and doubled the pasta. I just added a smidge more butter and we complemented with some lemon pepper. I also substituted the shrimp with langostinos since I have a kid with a shrimp allergy.

I doubled the sauce, added a bit of lemon pepper, doubled the lemon zest and used only half of a lemons juice and it was delicious. Also, instead of shrimp, i made Cob and I used the recipe "Fantastic Lemon butter fillet" by MATTDANB on AllRecipes and the combination was amazing! This recipe combination is definitely a keeper!

I used corkscrew pasta in place of the linguini, and let it soak up some of the delicious sauce before serving. I also added fresh asparagus that I had blanched for a little crunch and color. It was wonderful! Lisafburns

My husband loved this recipe and said to "put it in the rotation!" I used fresh oregano, basil and thyme and doubled the sauce components as others have suggested.  Used gluten free rice pasta tossed with a little extra olive oil to avoid sticking.  Delicious!!

We like our pasta with a little more sauce, so, based on the reviews of others I doubled the sauce except for the pepper. The flavor was fantastic and the pasta and shrimp cooked perfectly.  The only downside is the quantity of butter in the dish, so, it wouldn't be something I made every day, but, I would definitely make it again for a special treat.

I just finished eating this, and I'm still savouring the wonderful flavours in my mouth! I was concerned that it might be too much pepper, but it was just the right amount for me. I omitted the parsley and the wine because I didn't have them on hand, and instead added a little extra water. Delish!

This was fantastic, even though I forgot to buy wine!  Perfect amount of lemon and pepper.  I'd add some veggies for nutrition though.

Made just as the recipe said and it was way too peppery, and not enough lemon. We couldn't eat it. Will try it again with less pepper.

This was delicious and easy, but it took me a while to do all of the chopping (I mince my own garlic). I will definitely make it again. I thought the pepper amount was perfect, but I may use a bit less garlic next time.

Nothing incredible about this, but there are some serious pluses:  it's quick, it's tasty, it makes use of things that I always have in the fridge and freezer, and my husband really enjoyed it.  That all said, I did bump up the sauce a little, and used dry herbs.  I also used white pepper - for look and flavor.

I will absolutely make this again.

I loved this :) I did make a couple additions that made it even better. I added heavy cream at the end of the simmering the broth mixture, then I added about a half of cup of parm cheese also at this stage as well. Delicious!!

Love this recipe I've made it 2 different times so far. Changed a few things to my liking. Using only butter In stead of olive oil and adding chili flakes for a little kick. I also add bit more parsley just because I like it.

Delicious!  I didn't add quite as much pepper, but my kids didn't complain, so next time I'll try it with the full 2 tsps.  I added a bit of extra wine and broth and 4 oz extra linguine to give us enough for leftovers, and could've probably added more pasta, but it was so flavorful and easy too!  Great choice for weeknight dinner, but good enough for company.

Quite tasty but definitely not all that quick. Prep time of 15 minutes is unrealistic. I'm not sure how long the prep took but the total time was over an hour. Good recipe, I just know now to allow more time to make it.

Made a handful of adjustments, but used this as a base recipe. Used elbow macaroni instead of linguine. Used lemon juice and lemon pepper seasoning in place of the squeezed lemon, lemon zest, and black pepper. And finally I used frozen salad shrimp instead of fresh shrimp. They are much smaller (and already peeled!) so they complimented the elbow macaroni well. The dish turned out great!

I halfed the pepper and since we are a small family, I cut the pasta in half so that we had more sauce.  This is really good food, quick.  My son for the first time ever ate shrimp and asked me to add it to the list of food he likes.  I knew I was going to be serving it to him which is why I cut the pepper in half.  I have made it with Chardonnay and pinot grigio.  The Pinot was best.

I did 2 cups broth, 1/2 cup wine as suggested by others. But since I like spice, used the full amount of pepper. 2tsps is WAY TOO MUCH pepper! I like spice, but this set my mouth on fire, and completely over powers the other flavors in the dish. I'll be trying it again, but cutting way back on the pepper for sure.

Loved it!  This was really easy to make and tasted light and refreshing.  I used frozen shrimp and dried basil.  I listened to another reviewer and made 1.5 times the sauce and it was perfect!  Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This dish was easy to prepare with a tasty result. I like that the sauce is very light and simple yet so flavorful. I doubled the pasta and shrimp, but upped the sauce ingredients by another half per measurement based on others' reviews. If I hadn't done so, the noodles would be way too dry. It seems that this dish would be easy to customize based on your liking, which is always a plus.

I have made this recipe a number of times now and feel I can leave helpful feedback.  This recipe is 
Excellent!  Very simple to make and is quick and easy.  I usually don't have white wine on hand like the recipe calls for so instead I use 1 cup of chicken broth instead.  The only other change is I use about 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, as 2 teaspoons is way too much, unless you like alot of pepper. When you add the linguini at the end if you notice it seems too dry, add a little more of the chicken broth.  This is even better the second day.  Asparagus spears makes a nice accompaniment with this dish.

Simply amazing. It's a beautiful thing when simple ingredients come together to create a dish such as this one. Unfortunately I had no linguine on hand, so I used whole wheat spaghettini. Not the same, I know, but still good to me. I added some Lemon Pepper seasoning to give it a more lemony taste, as I prefer more lemon vs pepper. Excellent dish, highly recommend!

I absolutely love this recipe. I added an extra pound of shrimp and just had to add a little extra wine, salt and pepper to keep that taste. I love the kick in this recipe from the pepper. This is on our home dinner menu once a week!

This was a really good, but certainly simple recipe that I made when I realized I was out of my canned alfredo sauce. I needed something that would go with Shrimp and wouldn't take too long since I was in a hurry.  This is fairly quick and doesn't take a whole lot of prep.  I eyeballed the salt, pepper, and lemon juice (no zest) and used dried parsley and basil and it had great flavor.  Simple, but the lemon gives it a fresh taste.  I normally like to smother my pasta in parmesan cheese but this was actually very tasty without any at all!

I made this recipe last night for a couple of friends of mine. Absolute hit! I made double the sauce and added more herbs as recommended as well as added an 1/8 tsp Cayenne and 1-2 tsp Chili Flakes to make it spicy :) Since I love veggies, I added artichoke hearts and tomatoes when I threw the pasta in, which gave it great flavor. Definitely a keeper recipe, thanks love!!

This is seriously lacking flavor. You need to salt it to death just to be decent. I wont waste my time with this recipe again.

My girlfriend and I made this last night. It's very easy and enjoyable to make. I'm not a wine drinker so I chose a Sauvignon Blanc as the white wine after reading some recommendations online. The lemon garlic combo was excellent and the shrimp really brought out the flavors. 

However, I misread the ingredients and used 2 tablespoons of pepper vice 2 teaspoons!! lol...it still tasted excellent...just gonna use a little less pepper next time. :)

Very, very good.  I used 1tbs dried parsley, as I didn't have any fresh, and added 2 tbs capers as it seemed like a good idea.  Loved it, and am now suffering from a too full belly.

This was an amazingly light dish.

I subsituted the lemon with lime and omitted white wine. It still had a very beautiful, light taste.

I liked, Jake kind of. Increased all the liquids by half and subbed chicken broth for wine. Left lemon as same amount bc previous reviews said it was too strong, but add more next time.

This recipe is amazing! My friend makes it quite often at my house and its amazing! Very lemony thought, But just perfect! We doubled the recipe but NOT the pepper. It was very very spicy the first time we made it and doubled the recipe. So this time we just didnt double the pepper.

Excellent recipe - though I had to change a few things out of necessity.  Didn't have any lemon, so I excluded both it and the pepper; only had dry parsley and dry basil (instead of fresh), but they worked very well.  I also increased the chicken broth to 3/4 of a cup and the wine to 2/3 of a cup.  It was fantastic!  Better than my local Italian restaurant makes!

this was delicious. I made it exactly as written but a lot of the shrimp was left and all of the pasta eaten with praise from 2 adult daughters who are asking me to make again without the shrimp. So, next time a shrimpless lemon pepper linguini.

Great recipe...very easy...definitely need to add to the sauce like others have suggested.  If you like lemon, use the zest...if not, the juice is fine.  If you're cooking for children or those who are wary of spice...be careful on the pepper

I made this recipe this weekend & it was fantastic, real restaurant quality! I did have to use dry parsley & had to cut the pepper a tiny bit for others who would not like that much pepper. I doubled the recipe because I had 2# of shrimp there was just the right amount of sauce. There was not one morsel left!! This is a definite keeper!! I can see adding fresh mushrooms & asparagus to the mix for something extra. Sure glad I found this one, thanks!!

This was delicious! I'm not real crazy about cooking with shrimp, so I bought the 1 pound bag of small precooked, tail-off shrimp and just thawed them and dumped them in. Followed the rest of the recipe as is. Everyone loved it, even the kids. Served with a caprese salad and some cheesy garlic bread.

I'm not the best of cooks, and yet I didn't even mess this one up!  Absolutely wonderful!  Only problem that I had was that it didn't reduce like it said it would, so next time I'm using less broth and wine.  Otherwise it's wonderfule!  I spooned some of the extra liquid over steamed broccoli and MMMMMM!!!!!  Enjoyed some of the wine with the meal too!  Definitely a keeper!

I made this again last weekend and without the recipe. So easy and still amazingly yummy. Lime is a great way to go. Added a small amount of honey for the tartness of the lime and WOW Shazam! This was absolutely delicious. AGAIN. 

I made this last week on a week night and it only took about a half hour! I added cherry tomatoes (halved) and pine nuts and some chopped zucchini at the end for some veggies/sweetness. I also added some dried rawit chili peppers because we like a bit of heat. The combination was AMAZING. I used mushroom stock instead of chicken. Even after reheating the next day it was amazing. Also used limes instead of lemons because I had them in the house. The lime, pepper, chilis and garlic all combined to make an amazing sauce. Next time I will make a french bread to dip at the end. I had two helpings - it was THAT good!!!

I doubled the sauce but didn't double the garlic or pepper. After making it I think I should have. It had a very mild flavor and could have used more pepper and garlic. I used vermouth instead of white wine. I didn't have fresh parsley or basil so I used a tablespoon of italian seasoning. I used shrimp that were cooked and deveined. I served it with a salad and hot rolls. Yum! Will save this as a favorite.

Although this was good, I will make a few additions to the sauce. I already added some fresh tomatoes, and added more lemon juice. I think I will also add some cream in it next time to add more body. I will also sprinkel some parmesan cheese, I did this time and tasted yummy!

This is a great quick dinner.  I use limes off our trees instead of lemons and for me, I juline a zucinni for less carbs.  It is a winner!

This was delicious.  Followed the recipe as stated and served with salad and garlic bread.  Have made twice in the last 2 weeks and will definitely be making again.

This is absolutely delicious.  I was cooking it for a lot of people so I doubled the recipe.  For an extra flavor kick, I added andouille sausage.  I like a thicker sauce, so I also added a can of cream of chicken soup.  It was perfect.

This will definitely get added into my rotation. I can't believe how delicious this turned out! My husband was amazed and said it tasted like it should be in a 5 star restaurant. The sauce was so good we made extra to dip bread in. Thank you SO much.

My fiance and I loved this one. It needed a bit more pepper for us, but the sauce and shrimp were delicious. We would also keep lemon wedges on the side to squeeze ove rthe dish when its finished.

Didn't have wine so just used chicken broth for both liquids.  Made this for company and it turned out great!  Restaurant quality!  Be sure to use the fresh herbs, though, they really made the dish.

This is so easy and so good!  I had no fresh parsley, so I used extra fresh basil.  I also used frozen, raw shrimp which I thawed in cold water and peeled before cooking with the butter and basil. I'll be making this again!

Absolute best shrimp recipe ever.  Made exactly as recipe, but for two, not four. Provided plenty of sauce.  Definitely cut down on the pepper, used only 1/2 tsp.  Served with asparagus roasted in the oven.  Definitely a keeper and would sure impress guests!

This was a nice dish that was easy to make and very tasty.  Next time, I will increase the amount of basil.  It had a nice peppery taste, but I would recommend using a the juice of one large lemon and increasing the zest to taste.  Since I used only a small lemon, the juice and zest were lost in the dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

Not impressed - a bit better the 2nd day.  Perhaps, as a side it would be "okay" - but there's not a lot of flavor.

Waaaaayyyyy too much pepper.  I could not eat it, because it was so "spicey".  I can not eat spicey things.  I give it 3 stars though because my boyfriend liked it and I am sure if I adjusted the pepper it would taste better.

This recipe is quick, easy, and delicious.  It was really easy to cut down to one serving (I'm lame, I know) and is made with ingredients already in most kitchens.  The only thing I'd change next time is to half the butter.

Really good & easy!  One of the rare times that the total time was close for me.  :)  Doubled the sauce as others suggested but left the amount of lemon the same and skipped the zest.  Definitely will be making again. Hit with the entire fam.

Perfect easy and tasty weeknight dinner.  The only thing I'd change is to add the lemon juice incrementally so it tastes just right for your preference.  Either the lemon I had was too big or super sour, I had to double the other liquids (chicken broth & wine) to compensate for the sourness.

This is a delicious recipe and it's even great the next day.  I followed it to a T except scaled down the lemon.  A friend of mine had made it once and the lemon taste was overwhelming.  I could eat it with or without the shrimp it's that good.

This was easy and delicious. I used fresh pasta, which absorbed the sauce well. I didn't have fresh herbs on hand, so used dried. This is a keeper.

Wow. This was SOOO peppery and lemony  I couldn't even finish the plate. During cooking I had to add another cup of chicken broth and one of MILK to deaden the overwhelming flavors. My throat is still burning. Don't put in all the pepper or all of the lemon juice, you'll ruin the dish.   I'll make this again, not using this recipe, just tasting it as it goes. I'm going to go drink a tall glass of milk now...*cough*

Loved this!  I used chicken instead of shrimp and it was great.  Made it the first time exactly as is and thought it was a bit too peppery for my tastes (my husband loved it though).  Made it with less pepper the second time and absolutely loved it.  Very refreshing flavor.

Excellent recipe.  This is so easy to make, yet tastes like a dish you would get in a nice restaurant.  I didn't have any wine on hand, so I just added a bit more chicken stock.  I will definately make again and make sure I have some wine.  I think it will be even better.  Thanks for posting the recipe!

This was good. I will make it with less linguini next time.  It also needed more moisture to it...I remember it was not moist enough, if that makes sense...

Yummy and a quick dish to throw together at the last minute when you have no idea what you are making for dinner (like me tonight)!!!  I added a full diced zucchini into this for some colour...cooked at the beginning before adding the garlic.  I had to use dried basil in lieu of fresh, but had the parsley on hand and used whole wheat spaghettini!  Enjoyed, thanks!

My husband and I thought this was very good; simple to make, mild but still flavorful.  I made a couple of modifications.  Unlike most reviewers, I did not increase all the ingredients for the sauce, but instead added about 1/3 cup heavy whipping cream.  The cream gave it a nice flavor and thickened the sauce a bit... I found there was plenty.  I also used angel hair pasta instead of linguini; the thinner pasta seems to allow the dish to soak up more of the flavor.  Final thought: don't skimp on the fresh ingredients! I made this dish with dried basil and parsley, and then again with fresh and there is quite a difference.

I really enjoyed this recipe, however like most others, I made a few alterations. I added extra basil since I love the taste of fresh basil, and I also added red pepper flakes, which gave it a nice flavor. I have also come up with a few things that I'd love to do next time:  - omit the chicken broth and use 3/4 to 1 cup of white wine.  - omit the parsley and use 1/4 cup of freshly chopped basil.  - add 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  - add a cup of halved grape tomatoes.  - omit lemon zest.  - add extra shrimp.  - use 8-10 cloves of garlic instead of 6.  - use only a teaspoon of pepper instead of 2.  - omit butter. You can't really taste it in this recipe, anyway.  I really think these tweaks would make this recipe a 5 rather than a 3. Honestly, the recipe alone is kind of bland but adding red pepper flakes, tomatoes, extra garlic and basil will give it a stronger (and better) flavor and make it the perfect Italian dish!

I rated this 5 stars only because i messed up and didn't like lowering the rating, I listened to some of the others suggestions to double the sauce and what a mistake, it was soup! It would be much better as it is written.  My husband liked it ...he thought the lemon flavor was just right.

I gave this four stars because it is a great base recipe, however I don't think I would have liked it very much at all without a few alterations that I made. (I tried making it as written but it just didn't seem to be going well) Anyway I used dried basil and dried parsley (used the 1:3, dried herbs: fresh herbs ratio conversion method). and added about a teaspoon of oregano (for half of the recipe). A lot of people said it was too lemony but I didn't find this at all. I think the lemon taste was just perfect, however I added about half of a cup of heavy cream, about half a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken up, just a few slices of red onion, and some cayenne pepper. (all again to half of the recipe) (so if you're following the recipe exactly, I can see how the lemon taste would be too much) and I used a melody mix of fresh ground pepper instead of just black. I doubled the pepper amount also. All of these alterations got me a very tasty dish that I will definitely make again. I would only recommend following the recipe exactly to those on a diet as the cream isn't really all that healthy but I couldn't fathom putting what looked like such a watery sauce into the pasta.

Pretty good, but a little too lemony for my family as written. I added a jar of alfredo and they liked it much better. I doubled the sauce, reducing the pepper. Served with sauteed mushrooms and french bread.  I stirred the mushrooms in the leftover pasta before storing in the fridge. It was even better the next day! Next time I'll skip the zest and use the whole can of broth.

Love this recipe; it's fast, easy, and flavorful. My roommate had never had shrimp before (she's from a small village in Poland, where it's really unusual to eat shrimp), and she was thoroughly impressed by this dish. However as other reviewers have suggested, I had to make double the amount of sauce to have enough for the shrimp and pasta. Otherwise, I would have given it 5 stars.

My girlfriend doesn't like shrimp so I made this with chicken instead. It was just okay that way. We found ourselves picking the chicken out of the dish, so next time I made it without any meat and it was awesome! I would still love to try this with shrimp, but it gets 5 stars as a meatless dish.

I was looking for a lighter shrimp pasta dish for a simple, summertime meal, and this one perfectly fit the bill.  No heavy cream sauce here; this is more of a scampi-style dish with the addition of linguine pasta.  Next time I'll add the juice from a second lemon, but otherwise, this was perfect.

I loved the way this recipe used very simple ingredients to their optimum.  In fact, the only change I made was leaving out the basil, as I didn't feel it necessary with the other flavors.

This is excellent! I can't say enough about this recipe. It is that good. I was feeding 8 last night so I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 pound of chicken tenders cut into small strips (for the 1 picky, I don't eat shrimp, son). After tasting the sauce, I decided to triple the chicken stock and proceed with reducing it. This was perfect for our taste. Everyone just raved. This will be a frequent dinner around here. Thanks for sharing!

This was good, but not great.  I increased the sauce considerably and it was still on the dry side.  I also added extra lemon and extra basil; still just a bit bland, despite cooking the pasta in super salty water.  Good enough, but I probably won't make again.  Definitely not restaurant quality in my opinion.  Not quite sure what all the hub bub is with this recipe.

my boyfriend makes me cook this about every 2 weeks hes obsessed. I have experimented since making the original sauce and find that dill and rosemary are both great herbs to use if you dont have basil on hand. we use whole wheat pasta and add fresh parmesan every time! thanks for a simple and delicious recipe!

delicious and very easy! i made it with fresh angel hair pasta, and instead of just shrimp i used a variety of seafood: shrimp, squid, calamari, and mussels. i precooked the seafood in some boiling water for 5 minutes before adding it to the reduction. and i put some shredded mozzarella on top.

We liked it!  I did use a whole 13 oz box of pasta so I doubled the sauce, but left the pepper as is.  Will make it again!

This recipe is awesome.  I doubled the sauce as recommended in the reviews, and it was the perfect amount.  I also didn't add the lemon zest, because I didn't want the lemon taste to overpower the rest of the sauce.  This was so quick and easy.  I'll definitely be making it again.

This is a great pasta recipe - very simple. I ommitted the chicken broth and added a couple of teaspoons of sour cream at the end to further the sauce and give it a creamier consistency. I think the most important element of this recipe is to be sure not to overcook the shrimp which I find is the most common mistake when cooking with shrimp! Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Out of personal preference I made this with chicken and not the shrimp, this was a good recipe. I just cut the chicken into pieces and fries it in the olive oil. My husband and kids ate their full plates. I will be making this again, thanks!

yummm. I made this with very few changes for a home-cooked Valentine's Day with my husband, and it was delicious. I used a lowfat vegetable spread rather than butter, and even more garlic than the recipe called for, along with a chopped sweet onion, and I doubled the lemon zest. I served it topped with lemon slices and dill... delicious and restaurant-quality as other reviewers have said.

Wasn't sure we were going to like this one but decided to give it a try anyway.  Sauce seemed a bit thin at first but once it was mixed with the linguini it was fine-more than fine, it was YUMMY!  Will definitely make again!

My husband took the leftovers to work and all the men wanted to trade him, just based on look, smell and my husbands compliments while eating it in front of them.  Two of the guys now have the recipe.  Definitely a make often recipe.

Delicious and so easy!!!  Very good, perfect amount of sauce for 8oz of linguini (half a box).  Made with half amount of butter and was still delicious and full of flavor.  Thought garlic might be overwhelming, but it was perfect!  Thank you for the great recipe!

This is a 4 1/2 star recipe.  I also doubled the sauce and halved the pepper.  (My husband and daughter don't like hot spicy food.)  It was easy to prepare with ingredients on hand.  I substituted dried parsley for fresh, and fettucine for linguine pasta.  I also cooked the shrimp as desribed, but removed the shrimp from sauce prior to adding the sauce to the pasta, then divided shrimp equally on plates, mostly because we all like shrimp, but the amount of pasta per person seems to vary each time we have pasta.  My husband said, "Tasty dinner!" and my daughter finished all of hers.

We live in New Orleans so I could use fresh shrimp and Meyer lemons from our tree.  My husband and I loved this recipe (made as written) and will make it again.  It is a light but flavorful meal - added a salad and it was perfect.

This was a nice light dish better suited for summer time. I reduced the pepper by half because I don't like pepper THAT much lol. But over all very very good.

My husband and I both love this recipe! The first time I made it, I accidentally put 2 tablespoons  pepper instead of 2 teaspoons but we decided we liked it better this way because we love pepper! Now I usually add about 1 1/2 tablespoons of pepper. I've also adjusted the recipe by adding Smart Balance light buttery spread instead of regular butter, and 1 tablespoon dried parsley and 1 teaspoon dried basil, because usually I don't have fresh herbs onhand. I also use dried lemon peel (found in the dried herb section of the store) instead of zesting a lemon.

Really yummy.  We did cut down the pepper and lemon a bit, and made an extra half of recipe of sauce per previous reviewers. We will make this one again!

Really good.  I had to play around with the seasonings a bit to suit my taste and I threw in a handful of swiss cheese at the end to hold it all together.  My guests loved it.

A really great recipe that I want to make again.  It's probably actually a 4.5 star but when I made it, it was 4 star because I was missing ingredients.  It's a testament to the quality of the base recipe that it still turned out well.  So, I made this with chicken that I had cooked up in olive oil, garlic powder and red pepper flakes.  Next time- use shrimp, although the chicken was tasty.  I appx doubled the sauce as others suggested, and it's a good thing because it would not have been enough otherwise.  I used chicken bullion and water instead of chicken broth, and it worked.  I didn't have wine - but next time make sure you have it.  Last, I added maybe a little more than 1 tbl of red pepper flakes for pep and that was a GREAT change.  This was good, make again.

I was looking for a recipe to use items I already had on hand.  I didn't change the sauce but used leftover salmon instead of shrimp.  It turned out really flavorful!

Delicious! I used about 12 shrimp and two small sole filets for a family of four.  I also used one 14 oz can of chicken broth and cooked it down as directed.  I threw in about 3-4 T of capers (no liquid) and went a little lighter on the lemon juice.  It had just the right amount of tart flavor.  I served it over "fresh" packaged linguini- that makes a difference.  Even my kids liked it.  It is definitely good enough to serve guests.

This is by far, one of my favorite pasta dishes. The dish is light and packed full of flavor. My husband prepared it for me one day, and I request it everytime he wonders what we should have for dinner :) Cant blame a girl for trying?

We love this recipe at our house.  I always double the sauce and use less pepper (just a taste preference).  My 6 year old loves this and the 2 year old likes it minus the shrimp.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I liked this but I added my shrimp to soon and they were tough.  I will add later in the process.  Also I had cooking sherry instead of wine and it was a bit to strong.  I also added Parm.

Great recipe if you love lemon and linguini! I personally do not like shrimp, but the sauce made them taste so good and it matched perfectly with the pasta. It was a little too lemony at first but balancing it out with other ingredients helped. A little extra sauce overall did the trick and voila! Great linguini =)

We liked it.  Added a little more chicken broth so there was more sauce.  Used whole grain pasta and it very good and made the dish healthier.

Good but the sauce needs to be a bit thicker.  I used a can of mushrooms with juice and some apple cider vinegar and some additional chicken broth in place of the wine. Leftovers had the right consistency so next time I will make the pasta and let it sit overnight in the sauce.  Then add the shrimp right before serving.  Or I may just add some cornstarch to the broth.

This is now one of our 'go-to' recipes for seafood and pasta. Make sure you reduce the sauce as instructed or it will come out a bit soupy. I make this with 1 tsp black pepper and it is plenty peppery for us. Thanks!

This recipe was so quick and easy to throw together.  I did double the sauce and it was perfect! Just the right amount of lemon flavoring.  I only used half the amount of pepper which was perfect too! I added some mushrooms along with the shrimp to break up the flavor a little bit and it was very flavorful! Be careful not to get lemon seeds in the sauce.  I crunched down on one.  So, maybe squeeze into a bowl fist, then dump into sauce mixture.  I am keeping this recipe and will be making again and again! It's a great summer dish!

I'm a believer! Yes, this is a great recipe for company. I changed a couple of things... first of all, I knew the amount of pepper would be too much, so I decreased it to 1 1/2 teas., also I did not want to use the white wine I had on hand, so I increased the chicken broth to 3/4 cup. I am not a fresh herb snob so I substituted the 3 T fresh parsley for 1 1/2 T dried and 1/2 T of dried basil for the 1 T fresh basil called for in the recipe. I think next time I might increase the sauce by 1/2. I think you will will not disappointed. (Oops, I used fettuccine noodles instead of linguine, too)

This is the perfect dish for entertaining!  I have served this twice now for friends, and several have asked when I would be serving it to them again.  I made a few changes to the recipe, and it was still delicious!  I used 1 tablespoon butter and one tablespoon olive oil instead of the 1/4 cup of butter in the sauce.  I omitted the parsley as well.  I used frozen cooked shrimp (thawed) and cooked chicken strips from the store, and added these at the end and heated through. This is a restaurant-quality dish!

My husband and I really liked this...will make again as it had a lot of flavor.  I didn't have any chicken broth in the house so used water instead and added a little cornstarch in the broth to thicken it up a bit.  Also added cherry tomatoes and spinach for some veggies.

We (hubby & I) tried this tonight for the first time, though certainly NOT the last. This is an amazing dish! I did as others suggested and increased some of the liquids for the sauce, then I used a pinch of red pepper flakes and not quite so much black pepper but that was it. It was creamy, amazingly flavorful and extremely satisfying. I will be serving this at my next dinner party! Thanks Tina!!!

YUM! with a few changes other suggested. Used 3 TBSP olive oil to saute garlic. Wanted to increase sauce ~ used 3/4 C chicken broth, 1/2 C white wine, left out the lemon zest (didn't want it too lemony), reduced pepper to 1 tsp., sliced large shrimp down the middle. Kept the rest as directed.Very nice taste and so easy. Will make often. Thanks.

Way too much pepper in this recipe.  I should have known looking at the recipe when I made it, but I like to follow a recipe to the T the first time I make it.

WOW!  This was tasty!  We had friends over for dinner over the weekend, and we bought two bags of frozen uncooked shrimp. We ended up using 1 1/2 bags, and I had that other 1/2 left, so I decided to use this recipe.  I added diced up roasted red peppers to this, because I thought it needed more color, and it made it taste wonderful too!  I think chopped artichoke hearts would be a nice addition as well.  Instead of linguini, I used the Dreamfields low-carb penne pasta that I had on hand--PERFECT!  I think I put either a little too much zest or lemon juice in this time--the next time I will tone that down a bit, but I just loved it anyway!  Thanks!

This is FABULOUS!! My husband is lactose intolerant and so many non-red sauce pasta recipes have cream, milk, or cheese. This is perfect. I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. DH says I can make this once a week!

Pretty good.  My family liked this a lot.  We're big fans of lemon.  Someone suggested using chicken and I think I'll try that next time instead of shrimp.  I increased the sauce by half and I'm glad I did.  It was the perfect amount of sauce.  I also cut the pepper to about 1 1/2 tsp for personal tastes, though I think I can do the 2 tsp next time.  After adding the pasta (whole wheat), I added two diced tomatoes as well and that was pretty good.  Good recipe and very versatile.

This was really yummy and super easy!  I put some canned spinach in mine because I like getting my fill of veggies during the day but it ended up flattening out the taste of the dish so I will never do that again.  This recipe doesnt need any additions or substitutions...its terrific as is.  I did top with grated parmesan though.  Definently try this!

This recipe just didn't work out for me at all.  It was way too salty even though I didn't add much salt at all and it took forever and a day to reduce.

I have made this recipe (long ago added to my monthly rotation!) countless times and decided to finally review it.  This is an awesome overall basic pasta and shrimp recipe.  Though by no means low-fat, the flavour combinations are simple and beautiful tasting!  This is a recipe that would make even novices look like gourmet cooks! I double the sauce also!
Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I used chicken instead of shrimp.  Pre-seasoned lemon butter flavored chicken worked great.  The only complaint I have is that it calls for too much pepper- I would only use 1 tsp.  It was a little too spicy, at least when cooking it with chicken.

I made the recipe as is with the exception of substituting dried basil for fresh, and using half the freshly ground pepper. The fresh shrimp was flavorful, but I thought the dish overall was too lemony. The linguine noodles soaked up the lemon flavor to the point of excess. I'm not sure I will make this one again, but if so, I will make some changes to lessen the lemon flavor.

absolutely delicious! of course, i had to change the recipe to use what i had on hand. i used bottled lemon juice, and lemon pepper in place of both lemon zest and a small amount of the pepper. i still put in about 1 tsp black pepper. I also used pre-cooked frozen shrimp, and they came out over cooked, so I'd suggest using the fresh or uncooked shrimp. Even with those alterations, it was fantastic and I wish I would've made a double batch.

Really, really tasty!  I followed the suggestion of many and increased the sauce ingredients by 50%.  Perfect.  I used already cooked shrimp, so all I did was let them get hot.  Visually, this is a lovely dish.  Company worthy.

This was awesome!  Unfortunately I did not have white wine so I used extra chicken broth.  I also added sundried tomatoes and topped it off with some capers for some extra flavor!  I doubled the sauce like everyone has suggested but I left the pepper at two teaspoons instead of doubling it as well.  It was PERFECT!

I loved this really simple but amazing recipe. I couldn't say I've many light pasta dishes but I did added one more garlic. My two year old, which is the pickiest little guys alive loved it too. This is astonishing. I also made this dish with chicken instead of shrimp and it came out just as good.

I think I need to try this recipe again. It was good, but it didn't have the lemony/citrusy flavor I was expecting. I will use more lemon and probably more basil. Maybe add some veggies. I halved the amount of pasta and shrimp, since I was only making it for two, but I kept the sauce amount the same, which I think was perfect. Also, make sure your ingredients are all chopped/measured beforehand, this recipe comes together so fast!

I added red onions and brocolli to this, everything else I kept pretty much the same.  It was really good - I wish I would have doubled the recpe.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I only just realized I never got around to rating it, so a long overdue 5 stars thumbs up :-) Hubby (a picky meat & potatoes eater usually) loves it, and so do I. 

I have used it as-is with great success, and also as a jumping off point for variations. The most recent was substituting fresh asparagus for the shrimp for a light and lovely Spring supper. I use angel hair pasta usually, so when the water is hot I throw in the stem pieces, let the water come back to a boil, add the pasta & start the timer, let the water come back to a boil, then add the tips. They all come out done at the same time and then I toss with the basic sauce. Scrumptious!

I've used this recipe so often I now have to go buy yet another jar of dried basil - my winter substitution for fresh. I ran through 2 jars since I found this dish :-)

Fantastic!  Loved ever drop of this sauce.  Great light meal.  I made extra sauce and used 1 1/2 lbs. of shrimp - great for a family of 4 with left overs!  Make sure you have plenty of crusty bread to soak up all the juice.

Great recipe. One suggestion: Have all of your ingredients prepared and ready to go before you start cooking - this cooks so fast, and it's hard to keep up if you don't have everything ready. I added parmesan cheese to this once it was finished. I think I may try putting chicken in it the next time I cook it.

don't need lemon zest and only use 1 tsp. pepper or it'll be an overload..
double the sauce: chicken broth and white wine
add parmesan cheese
i add veggies like mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, petite peas, asparagus..
you can add scallops with the shrimp too.
heavy cream would work too..but i prefer not to add to keep it healthier

I really don't like to give a review that I personlly did not think was all that great.  I followed the directions but there was just something that I could not put my finger on that is was missing?  I will try it again and maybe add some tasty mushrooms to rev up the flavor.  Thanks will try it again.

I have made this recipe many times and it has become a favorite in my house.  To make the sauce more saucey I double the amount of chicken stock and wine.  I also reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water and add it if needed.

I love this recipe. I would have used chicken broth, but since we don't eat meat on Fridays during lent I substituted it with vegetable broth. I also added mushrooms and 1/4 cup of half and half.  I can't wait to make this again.  Next time I might add chicken breasts.

Made this for my fiancee tonight. Doubled the sauce as indicated and cut the butter in half. Had no fresh basil so I used dried. He says its a drop away from scampi, but just not as good.

This was incredible!  I followed the advice of some by doubling the sauce.  Great tip!  I used less pepper since my 4yr old was eating as well.  I added fresh, bite size pieces of asparagus by cooking them in the broth and wine.  I prefer mine a little crispy which added a nice texture to the dish.  I also added baby portabella mushrooms at the same time as the shrimp.  It was divine!  My 4yr old even ate the asparagus disguised by the shrimp.  She told me that this meal was better than McDonald's french fries.  Now that's a huge complement any mommy can appreciate.

This is delicious, addictive stuff. I used 1/2 shrimp and 1/2 scallops.  The lemon zest adds a nice zing.  Top with parmesan.  I also added some carmelized onions, but it would be fine without.

Good basic recipe. I did use 1/2 cup of wine and about 3/4 cup seasoned chicken broth and after reducing there was still barely enough sauce to cook the shrimp in. I added about 1/2 cup of half & half, 1/4 cup shredded mozza cheese, and a Tbs. of parmesan to the pasta before adding the sauce, and it was scrumptious. One other modification: used EVOO instead of butter and it was fine.

Very good recipe. I added a little more 'juices' to make more sauce and since I'm from South Louisiana I added a little Toni Chachere's Seasoning for a little extra taste. I also substituted the fresh parsley and basil for the pre-jarred kind and it worked very well also. The next time I believe I will use 2 pounds of shrimp because my husband and myself love shrimp but it was very good recipe. We really enjoyed it.

I loved this. I also sauteed mushrooms and sundried tomatoes separately. I doubled the recipe but found it to be a bit too runny this way. I think next time I'd stick with the original measurements as there are only two of us. Thanks for the great recipe.

Wow, this is a fantastic recipe. So very simple and yet delicious!  I defintely do NOT recommend reducing the lemon. The pepper and lemon is what makes the dish. (but we love lemon w/our seafood) Once the pasta was in, the flavors blended great and wasn't too strong at all. I did add extra chicken broth and a bit more wine for more liquid and added some mushrooms that I sauted separately and just combined at the end.  Thanks for a great recipe. Both my husband and I agree a 5 star for us.  Thanks for the recipe!

Husband LOVED it; 6th grader LIKED it; 3rd grader would only eat the linguini.  I liked it quite a bit.  I used light margarine and since I didn't have enough white wine, I used 1/2 white wine and 1/2 cooking white wine.  I thickened the sauce with corn starch which worked well.

Great recipe, but as the others said, too little sauce for the pasta called for.  I used a 500g pack of linguini and 1 1/2 cups chicken broth, the juice from 3 lemons, 1 cup finely chopped parsley, and 1/2 cup basil. I also used about 1 pound shrimp and 1 pound fish fillets.  I didn't have white wine at home but it still tasted great without the wine.

This recipe turned out great!  I used chicken rather than shrimp and tossed in a few veggies, but the sauce is very lemony and delicious.  My husband ate all of the leftovers in no time.  Thanks for this easy recipe!  I'm sure I'll make it again.

We LOVED this recipe! It was a really great combination of lemon and pepper. It had a wonderful 'fresh' taste because of the lemon. I'll be making this dish weekly. Thank you for posting the recipe--I wouldn't change a thing.

Great dish!! Do doubble the sauce because even with that you'll be looking for more. This is a keeper!! Play with different white wines. I have noticed different white wines bring out different little tastes.  Keeps the family on their toes.

Very good, DH liked this a lot. He said this was awesome and gave this 4 stars. I don't eat seafoood, so this is DH's review. I used squeezy lemon in the little yellow bottle and dried California Lemon Peel by McCormick. I didn't use fresh ground pepper, just the regular kind in the metal cannister. It was easy to prepare, and the pepper was just right. I thought it would be a bit much, but DH said the flavors were balanced and it was just right how I fixed this. This is a keeper, thanks Skini for sharing this.

My husband had never had lemon flavor with his pasta before so the first few bites were a little shock to his system After that though, he really enjoyed it. I used half black pepper and half red pepper since he likes spicy dishes. I did about a half cup more of chicken broth and used juice from a lemon and a half instead of just one lemon, to make up for the added broth. I will definitely make this again because my husband said that it looks even better than Olive Garden.

Pretty Good Stuff!
Imade this tonight for my family and it was well recieved.  It was very easy, quick and tastey.  I only made 1 very minor adjustment and that was 1/2 cup white wine instead of 1/4.

After seeing so many positive reviews, thought I'd try this. It really was excellent. I left out most of the pepper, as you can always add it later - and found I didn't need it. Will definitely have again.

This dish is absolutely WONDERFUL and easy to make.  My family loved it and even the neighbor tried to take the leftovers home.  I did take the advice from the others reviews and doubled the sauce by doubling the wine, chicken broth, and used one lemon juiced and some extra bottled lemon juice I had on hand.  I will be sending this recipe to my family members to use at our next family gathering.

This is a wonderful dish!! Very light and I love the lemon flavor.  My husband kept going back for more.  My only change was that I added lemon pepper to the shrimp and let it sit for fifteen minutes before I threw it in the pot with the other ingredients.  Very tasty.  Thanks again!!!

This is a great recipe, but I found the pepper to be overwhelming.  I have made this several times, all with different amounts of pepper, and have decided to just add pepper to taste.  Anyone wanting more can add it to their plates.  This is definitely a keeper recipe!

This is a great recipe except the amount of pepper that it calls for makes it almost inedible.  I just season it with s & p.  I make it for 2 people and there is just the right amount of sauce.  I would definitely double the recipe for four people.

Made it several times and it is always very good. I use less pepper as it tends to be a little too spicy for our taste. Have added spinach once and corn another time. Very good basic recipe.

This is one of my favorites.  Like others I double the sauce.  I use whole wheat linguini and still love it.  I've made it when chicken and I've also tried throwing in some asparagus to add some veggies to it.

Doubled all sauce ingredients except lemon, and still thought the lemon was too strong. My husband, however, loved it. Nice change from cream and tomato based sauces - tasted very light. Also, used fusilli, added some sauted onion and red pepper. Adding to our rotation, thanks for a good recipe!

I made this for a mom's away weekend and we all just loved it.  I used slightly less pepper than called for though and a good white wine (not the cooking white wine).  My one girlfriend loved it so much she went home and made it for her husband 2 nights later.  He loved it so much he ate the leftovers for breakfast.  Thanks, its a good one.

Great recipe.  So easy to make with only a few ingredients.  When I make it again, I may cut back on the ground pepper a little bit.

I used dried herbs, and it was still delicious.  Look for whole wheat linguini for a healthier alternative.

I doubled the sauce ingredients (IMO it needed it...I didn't even add the full 8 oz. of pasta) but neglected to double up on the lemon juice & zest & I think it needed more lemon. I did use fresh basil & I subbed some of my lemon balm for some of the parsley. I have no idea how much pepper I used as I didn't measure it...just twisted until I thought it was enough & then added some more. It was just enough to feel the pepper on your tongue but not enough to make you go "Whoa! Too much pepper!" After I plated it, I topped it w/ some grated romano cheese...good choice! Next time I think I might take the time to cut the tails off the shrimp to make it more convenient to eat. I served this w/ french bread & Pan-Fried Asparagus (from this site) & I think the asparagus was the perfect complement to this dish. I was going to saute some zuchinni in the lemon mixture but decided against it because I don't like my side dishes to have the same flavor as the main...I like some contrast.

This is awesome. I also doubled the sauce and am glad I did. It is great also with only 1/2 of the butter. I use chicken broth to compensate the other half. It is also good with vegetables cooked in the sauce in the step prior to adding the butter and shrimp. I like any combination of zucchini, red peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, etc. We sprinkle some parmesan on at the end. For my kids I reduce the pepper a lot; I only use about 1/4 the amount. My husband and I sprinkle more pepper on our own.

I needed some new ideas for fish.  Since shrimp isn't a fav in my house (it's a 'texture thing'), I made the sauce as written, but subbed tilapia fillets for the shrimp.  Lemony AND peppery... yum.  Will make again and again.  Thanks!

I see this reviewed practically every day, so I had to give it a whirl. I used lemon pepper, and added it little by little until it was peppery enough. I also used regular peel-and-eat shrimp as that's what they had at the store. We enjoyed it. Thanks!

This is an incredible recipe that is so easy to make and tastes like you worked for hours.  My family really loved the lemon flavor and the leftovers were soooo good.  If I had known they would be that tasty, I would have taken them to work for lunch instead of sharing!!  Thanks for this one.  I will make again and again.

This recipe is one of the best I've tried so far, but too much pepper for our taste buds. I used dehydrated parsley & basil and regular old pepper (not freshly ground), & margarine since I had no butter.  It still came out good! As others mentioned, next time I'll try decreasing the pepper,  & doubling the sauce (we like lots of linguine and makes good leftovers), and also using larger shrimp (so it doesn't take as long to shell them).

Tasted like a fresh, light scampi.  I used 1lb of pre-cooked shrimp.  I thought the recipe's amount of sauce perfectly coated the shrimp and pasta.  Anymore would have been too much of a good thing!

I made this recipe over the weekend and it was absolutely delicious! I doubled the chicken broth, white wine and added a little extra lemon zest. My bf keeps asking when I will make it again. This is a definite keeper and thank you so much for sharing!

Wonderful! Loved this, just cut down of the pepper a bit. We live in downtown Chicago and enjoy eating out. This recipe could be served at anyone of the finest restaurants with great success. I have never taken the time to rate a recipe before but couldn't pass up rating this one, so good and so easy to prepare.

This was really good.  The only thing I can say that was not perfect, for me at least, was I would use a tad less butter and lemon next time.  After the first few bites, my taste buds adjusted and it was definately an enjoyable, easy meal.

If you don't care for the smell of garlic, forget it, the garlic smell lingered for a few hours.  Otherwise, I give it a 10, bought expensive small, fresh shrimp, will buy larger frozen shrimp next time.  Loved it!

Very good dish. I skipped the garlic because I don't like it and added about 1/2 cup of basil and some grated parmesian at the end. It was very flavorful and quite easy to make.

Awesome! Thank you for sharing this great recipe. I don't really like parsley but I love wine and basil. I doubled the wine and the basil, left out the parsley and added some fresh parmesan. My boyfriend and I both thought it was perfect. (He says it's a 'must have')

This was really good.  The broth and wine lightened up the heavy taste and it was great.  Because I like things spicy, I added some crushed red pepper and it added so much to the flavor.

I halved this recipe because I was only feeding me and my husband. This turned out to be a mistake- 1/2 lb of shrimp was not enough for both of us! The only other change I made was to halve the pepper. It ended up plenty peppery, and I agree with the other reviewers who said to add pepper to taste. This was very tasty, and I'll be making again (with a little extra shrimp).

This dish was delish!!! Both my bf and i loved it. However we doubled the recipe for the sauce (except for the pepper and shrimp) but found we needed to add more pepper and salt at the end. He said it was one of the best things we have made! I added more lemon to mine (since i love my lemon). I also added capers because why not? So good. We don’t mind eating leftovers but this dish was definitely better when it was fresh.

4/5 for flavour and ease.  
A scoop of pesto is a nice substitute if you don’t have fresh basil around and a couple grates of Parmesan rounded it out nicely.

This is definitely going into my rotation.  I doubled everything except the linguini, shrimp, lemon juice, and pepper. It worked perfectly.  I can't recommend this enough.  It's delicious without feeling too heavy.

Subbed scallops for shrimp, seared them on griddle and then tossed them in sauce with some steamed Brussels. Made the sauce exactly by the recipe. Family said this might be their favorite ever.

Added frozen vegetables but my family said they didn't like them in the sauce.  They prefer that they be steamed on their own.  Because I added the vegetables I can't  really rate this recipe accurately.  But I will update this once I make it again .  I made this again tonight without the vegetables and doubled the sauce.  They loved it.  I served steamed broccoli and cauliflower  on the side with Cheese Sauce for Broccoli and Cauliflower on this site.

Since the receipe calls for little broth I dumped the rest with the pasta. I only used basil and I used lemon pepper for grilling by McCormick's AMAZING!!! My husband and I  at the whole shebang!! I  also prepped everything in 3 bowls, so very easy clean up

I took the advice of others’ and double the liquids, except the black pepper. It was delicious. I didn’t have any linguini on hand but spaghetti did the trick! I’d like to try it again with linguini.

Loved this recipe! I didn't have any basil so that wasn't used, however I didn't miss it at all. I used some fresh grated Parmesan cheese which added a delightful finish. I will be keeping this recipe to make again.

The only changes I made was not to reduce it as much and probably  added more lemon juice.  I've never  had it before I loved it , my husband loved it ! 
Will do it again.

Turned out great! I added one sliced up shallot because I love garlic and onion cooking together. My parents had no salt in the house and it still came out tasting delicious. So easy to follow, will definitely keep in the rotation!

I made this and my husband and I greatly enjoyed it. However, I had to add a bit more broth as it was too dry strictly following the recipe. Next time, I’ll keep that in mind as I will definitely be making this again!

Followed recipe and would make these suggestions- plate linguine then spoon shrimp and sauce over- pasta will not absorb all that delicious sauce so much and have extra for dipping crusty bread in. Because freshly ground and pepper from can are different- use a lot less if using canned pepper and just less if using fresh grind -u want to taste the shrimp, not overpower it’s taste. With changes it is a five star recipe. Oh and use shrimp stock instead of chicken!

This recipe  needed a little tweaking to suit my taste, but it wasn't bad.  I had several people over for dinner and they all seemed to enjoy it. I served it with a salad, cheddar bay style biscuits , and paired it with  Moscato and Pinot Grigio .

1. Would have liked the recipe to estimate time to reduce by 1/2.
2. Made it exactly as written EXCEPT that I used a pasta I bought at last year's Houston Nutcracker market. It  is Pastamore's Thai Citrus and Ginger. It was perfect with this sauce. Will do it again.

what a delicious pasta dish ! Light and  lemony.. Also, a snap to make. I only used about 1/2 teaspoon of  the black  pepper and there was plenty of heat and peppery taste for us. I served with some roasted broccoli.

This was excellent and so easy to prepare.  I’m glad I read a lot of the reviews because I was considering doubling the sauce, as some suggested.  I’m glad I did not as it was perfect, as is.  I suspect some people let the broth/wine mixture cook down to less than half.  If your linguine is not quite finished cooking, I would suggest waiting to put the shrimp in the broth mixture until close to the end or they will overcook and turn a little tough.  This is definitely a keeper!

This came out wonderful!!! The shrimp came out delicious and I don't even like shrimp. I did double the sauce as other reviewers suggested. It was good but a little too greasy. I don't know if it was the butter or the extra sauce, but either way it was pretty good. Would definitely make again!

First off I just need to say wow, we are impressed !! I used lemon infused olive oil and 2 tbsp butter to sautée the garlic. I didn't add the shrimp(my husband smoked them) I cut the pepper in half( 1 tsp then 1/2 tsp salt). Didn't have a lemon so used 3 tbsp lemon juice. A nice Pinot Grigio for the wine. My husband tasted the sauce all by itself while I was cooking and said, "We should have marinated the meat in that!!" We have a winner

 The parsley can be replaced with mint for a bit of freshness.

As per other reviewers I doubled the liquid ingredients and garlic to make more sauce.  It was pretty lemony but I love lemon.  My husband would have preferred less lemon. And we only added salt and pepper to taste, I would never just dump in a specified amount of either.  We added crab meat, used a mixture of chicken stock and seafood stock, topped with parmesean cheese and YUMMY! Totally would make it again. And instead of shrimp next time  I want to try scallops.  This is going in my recipe box

This was really good.  My husband was crazy about it.  Had to use dried basil, instead of fresh.  It still tasted great.  But I have to say fresh is always better.

This was easy to make, and everyone ate it. I have 2 kids that are super picky, and one really like it and one ate it but didn't love it - which is still a major win at my house.  I will make this again.

Replaced the pasta with shredded zucchini.  Next time, will cook down more before adding shrimp and zucchini.

I made this meal for my family and everyone loved it (with recipes like this, they're starting to think I can actually cook!). Following the suggestions of others, I doubled the sauce recipe and ended up with more than enough (also added a little more lemon zest than the recipe called for, which worked out great). I added grilled chicken (in addition to the shrimp), for the more hearty eaters in our group. What surprised me was that not only was this meal delicious when I served it, but I heated leftovers two days later and it was just as good! The only thing I would note is that much of the preparation for this meal is last-minute, so if serving for a crowd or guests, you might prepare the sauce in advance, which is the most labor intensive part of the preparation.

I didn't time it exactly but it felt like it took me a little longer to make this than expected. Which is fine because it's probably just me.  This was a very easy dish to make and the sauce was great.  It was a nice change of pace from Alfredo or vodka sauce.  I added  sliced Roma tomatoes while cooking the shrimp, they soaked up the sauce and brought out some very tasty and unique flavors.  

Tip: if you can't say 'Hell Yes!' when someone asks if you like pepper, maybe use a little less than suggested before just following the directions verbatim.  It's cooking, play with your food!

Excellent, I loved the flavor.  Doubled sauce, didn't add as much pepper, and did add broccali and tomatoes.   I will serve this to guests.

Super peppery, not so lemony. I would go with the increase in sauce especially if you use whole wheat noodles like we did. It seemed a bit dry. We used pre cooked shrimp and water instead of chicken broth, didn't make a difference

The DH and I liked this a lot. I followed other reviewers suggestions and: 

1. halved the amount of pepper to just under 1 tsp (and I added a pinch of red pepper flakes.) I did not, however, reduce it enough!! Next time I make it, I'll use 1/2 tsp and the red pepper. 

2. doubled the amount of chicken stock and wine and reduced by half. 

3. Cooked the shrimp separately in a large saute pan for not more than 3 minutes and set aside.

4. Added 1/2 a bunch of asparagus, stems peeled and cut into 1" lengths and one finely minced shallot. 

5. When the linguini was half done I tossed the parsley and basil into the sauce. I sauteed the shallot and asparagus in the butter in the saute pan for about 2 minutes, poured in the sauce from the saucepan and added a little bit of cornstarch slurry to thicken it slightly. 

Added the shrimp back in and transferred the pasta from the pasta water directly to the saute pan. Stirred and, in order to counter the heat just a bit, I added a couple of TB of creme fraiche. We like this a lot and will like it even better if we don't need fire extinguishers!

3 stars as the recipe reads due to it being too dry. I'd give it five stars if the sauce was doubled.

I made it as is with a tiny addition. I cut some sun-dried tomatoes (dried) up and added it to the broth mixture. I didn't reconstitute them first so they weren't too mushy. Amazing flavors and great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Hands down the greatest recipe ever. I made this the other week and fell in love. I followed other reviews and doubled the sauce. It may look like a lot of liquid at first however you soon realize it evaporates and soaks into the pasta. Other reviews may say it's a lot of pepper however I LOVE pepper (I did seasoned to my liking though instead of measuring it out). The only downside to this pasta is the smell of the sauce before you put the butter, shrimp, parsley, and basil in. It is bad, however after putting butter, basil, parsley, etc the smell is heavenly. I double this recipe because I love leftovers the next evening. Something I definitely look forward to after work!

Really enjoy this although as other reviews I cut the pepper in half and still found it to be a lot but my husband loved it. I've made this twice now and definitely better with fresh parsley and basil which I did not have the  second time I made it so used the ones from my spice rack which was different but still OK.

This was delicious and quick! The inly change I made was halfing the pasta and shrimp as it was just me tonight.  The extra sauce was perfect! Oh, I also added broccoli,  because I need to have veggies. 
The sauce was nice and tart but not too lemony. I will definitely make this again.

I agree with everyone else. More sauce needed. I thought pepper was in perfect proportion. I found the lemon to be overwhelming when I juiced one and added it. I prefer half of a lemon juiced. Very tasty.

Very easy to make it. However I reduced the amount of lemon. Plus I almost doubled the recipe. My guy is a heavier eater. I diced roma tomatoes on top along with scallions for color. Served with white wine and warm garlic bread. My guy was very impressed even though this meal was very simple to make.

I made it for 2. Love the way the ingredients shrink as necessary. My husband loved it! Used a good Chardonnay (only 2 TB) so I drank the rest! Forgot the pic because he water it quickly with a nice buttery crusty bread to sip in the sauce! I also used my iron skillet! Cheers!

I doubled the sauce as other reviewers suggested, but it was quite soupy. I added a tablespoon of corn starch and sinners for a few extra minutes. I skipped the basil and added capers. It was greasy!

I did not care for this recipe at all. I doubled the sauce and reduced the pepper but it was not very flavorful. There are much better shrimp recipes on this site. Try shrimp primavera with sun dried tomatoes. so much better. i will not make this again

Mhm! Maybe I'm just a big fan of shrimp pasta, but this was delicious. The taste is powerful, so I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with sensitive tastebuds. The dish is also better if you wait a little bit before eating it, half an hour at least, preferably more. Used a little bit less pepper, while keeping most of the ingredients as instructed.

This is really good...I followed other reviewers and multiplied the sauce ingredients by 1.5...Next time, I'll do the same for everything but the lemon.  it ended up a little sour.  Besides that, it was really good and easy to make!

Made it exactly to recipe, it was delicious! My 4 year old didn't like the "meatballs" (shrimp), but my 5 year old gobbled it up. And they are super picky. Will make again, and you could use any meat or just veggies.

Nice easy recipe.  Went with less pepper and added a tablespoon of Dijon mustard and some fresh green beans.  Looking forward to doing it again with the capers as another has suggested.

This was really good. Took others suggestions and doubled the sauce ingredients and used less pepper. I also just bought pre cooked frozen shrimp and thawed in a bowl of cold water.
Delish! Will make again.

Great! Followed for the most part. Used fresh basil, dried parsley, lemon pepper instead of regular to taste, and eyeballed everything else. I thought the dish had the perfect amount of flavor/sauce for 8oz of pasta and 1 lb.. shrimp...other 4 oz. pasta we reserved on side for picky son. Daughter and husband loved.

I used dried parsley and basil, no lemon zest or wine (used extra broth in place of wine, extra lemon juice in place of zest).  I halved the pepper (per the reviews here) and we LOVED it! Super easy, super fast and really good! It was great over the pasta, but the shrimp alone were fantastic.  I made broccoli spears to go with - and added a little sauce to them for taste.

I thought this was ok.  My shrimp was fresh and nice sized but  the sauce did not really do it for me.( Sorry) I did like it enough that I might try it again. I had to use dried basil. Maybe that was the problem.

For me it was kind of bland but it was still really good. I guess I'm just used to thicker sauce pastas. Glad I tried something outside of my norm.

All of the flavors came together to create a memorable taste.  I had to add a sprinkle of salt, and when I had a second helping, after it had set for a while, the dish was even more flavorful.

It was bland and unappealing and had too much pepper.

I made this for a second time last night, doubled everything but the linguine and shrimp.  I added a small sweet onion (which was caramelized when I cooked the garlic,) capers, and cherry tomatoes (in the last few minutes of simmering).  It looks and tastes like it took way more effort than it did and everyone loves it!

loved this recipe.
Made some inadvertent mistakes that I will repeat on making.
I misread the wine amount and used 1 cup of white wine. 
I used more olive oil and half the butter amount. Instead of 1/2 cup of chicken broth , I used a cup. Adding  a bit of the water from the pasta also went in. All good. 

I used a generous amount of lemon zest. 

Next time I will add broccoli  pieces for a one dish meal.
This was so tasty and good. 
Final step was a sprinkle of pecorino/romano on top

I didn't have any wine so added cooking sherry.  Also less pepper and capers as suggested. Really tasty. I will make it again

This was awesome!   Linguine had a bit of a citrus kick to it which gave it a wonderful flavor. I did cut the pepper to 1tsp since I was using canned black pepper and 1tsp appeared sufficient.

I made this dish and it was excellent. I added a little more parsley and salt than it called for. It's super easy to make. I would highly recommend this recipe.

This was so easy and delicious! Even my picky family liked it! I made it pretty much as the recipe states. Only changes were to make it even easier. I used pronto linguine that I just cooked in the sauce with a little extra wine and water -- so no need for an extra sauce pan there -- and I used frozen shrimp. Defrosted them, pulled the tails off, and tossed them in. Also used squeeze tube herbs so that I didn't have to chop up basil or parsley. I don't think it took me more than 15 minutes to put together but I would serve it to guests. I'm also thinking this might be a good recipe to double and throw in a crock pot when feeding a crowd... I think my shrimp crazy brothers-in-law would love it. It doesn't get easier or tastier than this. Thank you for recipe. I am also going to try with some cooked chicken.

This was so good! I took other reviewers advice and doubled the sauce. Used only half of the pepper and topped with Parmesan cheese. Delicious! Served with garlic ciabatta bread and steamed broccoli. Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe! I followed the recipe and it turned out amazing. I put a little extra lemon and it was delicious and did not have fresh basil so I used dry basil from my spice rack and it turned out perfect. I do want to try it with the fresh basil to see the difference. My boyfriend wanted to add sausage to his and I did it separately and it was actually amazing, don't be afraid to experiment, the broth is so perfect it all tastes good with it. Thank you so much

This dish is a 100%  success!! I followed the recipe, but I didn't have fresh parsley, neither basil. So instead, I used dried version. The flavor was delicious. Next time I'll try  fresh products, but Is good to know that you can use both of them , and your dish will taste good as well

Made it according to the directions, except I followed the suggestions to increase the sauce and reduce the pepper...glad I did.  It was a bit too lemony for our taste, so
the  2nd time I made it...I used deveined shrimp with the shells on......this was about $2 cheaper  than the ones with the shells off. I took the shells off and boiled them in the water that I later used for the pasta....I also used about 1/3 of a cup of the shell pasta water and added it to the sauce. I cut back on the lemon juice and  increased the garlic by 3 cloves. I also grated a cup of parmasian cheese into the sauce.....I think these additions made it a richer sauce......but everyone's taste is a little different .....

Very good!  We had this with asparagas, so there was some timing co-ordination.  I timed the cooking of the pasta with the asparagas, so the linguini went into the sauce pot while the asparagas cooked.  One thing I did was to melt the butter ahead of time, so the shrimp, sauce, and pasta was ready about the same time as the asparagas.   I did serve this with good Parmesan cheese.

This was a great recipe. I doubled the liquid ingredients because I made a whole box of linguini noodles. (We love left overs!) I also reduced the amount of black pepper per other reviewers (only 1tsp). I also cut a couple of grape tomatoes in half and threw them into the pot right before serving to and some color. My boyfriend and I loved it. I paired it with baked potatoes, steamed broccoli, and  New York Strip Steaks for our Valentine's Day dinner. Thanks for the recipe, will be making this again for sure.

I used just a little minced garlic in a double recipe..should have been more like 1/8 teaspoon.  I added some mushrooms but they didn't seem to add anything.  I used white cooking wine.  A lemon should give about 3 Tbsp of juice.  It would be easier to get shrimp already peeled.  The flavor was amazing.  Stick with the linguine noodles.  Top with Parmesan.

Unbelievable! We made this tonight. Poured the shrimp and sauce in with the pasta and ate in heaven. Will definitely make this again! We love our bread yet barely touched it, the shrimp and pasta were so tasty. Touch of lemon and garlic put us over the edge. YUMMY!!!

Excellent!   I can't eat shrimp (like shrimp, but it does not like me), so I made a boneless chicken breast for myself.  That was wonderful with the pasta and sauce.  My husband LOVED the dish with shrimp.  Simple to make, aroma is wonderful so would be quite an impressive dinner for company.

Pretty good.  I doubled recipe and we thought there was the right amount of sauce.  Added red pepper for color and only used 1/2 lemon for our taste.  Gotta like black pepper to like this recipe!  Will make again.

I made this last night for dinner and loved it!  I followed other recommendations an doubled the sauce. My only change would he to season and sauté the shrimp before adding to the sauce because the shrimp didn't take on the flavor of the sauce like the pasta did.

This was pretty good. As others said, it needed more sauce.  I doubled the sauce and could have even used more. I think this recipe calls for too much pepper, not because it is too spicy but because it isn't that great a flavor.  I might try replacing half of the black pepper with some red pepper to improve the taste. One other thing: I think I would saute the shrimp with the oil and garlic at the start of the recipe to give it some color and crunch. Then I would remove it and add it back in at the very end.

In place of the fresh herbs i used a pesto that i made previously with spinach, parsley, basil, and cashews. I put the pesto in at the saute garlic step. I didn't have chicken broth so I used a cup and a half of water and one tablespoon of chicken boullion. I skipped the salt because of the bullion; and the pesto was also previously salted. I used around a half cup of chardonnay. I don't have a grater and didn't feel like hand "zesting" so I left out the lemon zest. I also used half of a bag of frozen mixed vegetables (carrots, pease, green beans, corn), previously thawed. It was good. Probably would have been better if I'd followed the recipe.

Used this recipe when I had odd ingredients to use. Used the search and this recipe appeared....and I'm happy it did!! Used chicken instead of shrimp but I'm sure it will be even better with shrimp. Gives me a reason to make again real soon!

Doubled broth and the wine, but we both ended up adding lemon and pepper.  Very good then, so next time I'll make it just as recipe states.

It turned out fantastic! I had doubled the recipe cause my family likes noodles I had spaghetti on hand so I used it I wanted a thicker sauce so I sprinkled a bit of corn starch to thicken it up. My boyfriend isn't a big fan of shrimp and he loved this. It's a recipe I will keep and make again

Delicious! One change, however... I accidentally forgot the butter, because I'm not used to putting butter in scampi, and it turned out wonderful. I'm thinking it really doesn't need the butter. It probably wouldn't hurt though.

kind of a waste of nice shrimp, honestly. I knew a full lemon sounded like too much, but I followed the recipe, aside from adding shallots and 1/2 cup more chck broth. use 1/2 a lemon if you're making this :)

This is a favorite at my house.  I've followed the recipe several times and now experiment with other ingredients.  Currently, I'm adding 1 tbsp of prepared pesto, 2 tbsp of pine nuts, 1/2 cup of sliced mushrooms, 2 cups of fresh spinach, and 1/4 cup of shredded Parmesan cheese.  And, I serve it with toasted garlic bread.  Delicious!

I listened to the reviews and upped my sauce ingredients by 1/2 but kept the original proportions.  The only change I made to the recipe was that I used angel hair pasta because I bought it on accident.  I liked it with angel hair and would make it the same way next time.  I used a moscato for the wine.  Do yourself a favor and use fresh herbs and actual lemon juice...not from the squirty bottle in the fridge...in a simple dish like this with few ingredients , it makes a huge difference.  This recipe turned out better than any fancy restaurant pastas I have had. This would be a great meal to impress guests.  Thanks for sharing!

This was awesome.  For those that DON'T like pepper, don't bother... it's what makes the meal. The first time I made it as written and it was great, definitely worth the 5 star rating.  I've made it a few times since and have adjusted to suit our tastes. For those interested, my slight adjustments were: Used three heaping tablespoons of minced garlic (jarred), increased the broth by about a 1/4 cup.  Increased the white wine by about 1/2 cup.  Used two lemons and a generous amount of zest.  Used about 1.5x the butter and eliminated the salt. Topped it with liberal amounts of shredded Parmesan. I've used both frozen raw and fresh raw shrimp.  I prefer fresh, but frozen doesn't detract too much.  I wouldn't suggest frozen cooked shrimp, it doesn't seem to soak in the flavors as much.

Sooooo yummy.  I doubled the sauce too so we'd have enough to dunk some crusty bread. Don't know why folks talk about the pepper.  It's devine! I say the more pepper the better!

Made this recipe with all the ingredients, as written. Wasn't as tasty as I would have guessed. Had originally planned to make a garlic, lemon, buttery sauce for these shrimp to accompany the linguini, which had a light buttery, lemon sauce. Flavors could have been a little bolder. Will try again.

Oh boy, this recipe. I must have made this easily two dozen times now; it's a personal favourite for myself and my entire family, easily the one thing I make most from this site. Used to double the sauce as per suggestion, but in more recent tries, I disagree - the amount recommended is perfect to coat all of your  pasta with the savoury, lemony flavour without having soup in the bottom of the pot. A++++ would recommend.

OMG this is so good. I am giving it 5 stars but I made a few changes (no reason - it's just what I did). I'm sure it would be great without any changes. Sautéed onions, peppers, and a few diced mushrooms with the garlic. Zested a lime instead of a lemon. Used 1 cup of chicken broth (no wine); however, I think it was too much because I had a little trouble trying to reduce. So I used a little corn starch to thicken. This may not be an issue if you follow the recipe; however, I needed quite a bit of sauce because I served it over linguine (rather than mix it together). This recipe is super easy to make and very tasty. Thanks.

I thought it was good, but my sauce came out very soupy - did anyone else's? I doubled the sauce ingredients as suggested, but  didn't double the butter (kept it 1/4 cup) - could that have been it?

I followed the advice of previous reviewer and increased the sauce ingredients by about 50% and that was perfect!

I really liked this recipe, but I would probably use less pepper. 

Also, while delicious, there was an awful lot of butter. I might find a way to cut down on that as well

I added some fresh diced tomatoes and it was delicious. I didn't have parsley, so I skipped it.

I used a 12 ounce box of linguini and only a 1 pound bag of shrimp. Should have used more, not enough shrimp. It still tasted very good! I will make it again but remember more shrimp next time.

This was delicious! I ended up putting more lemon zest in than planned because I didn't exactly measure (oops) and it really didn't kill it. I actually might keep that amount and add in more basil & pepper. Fantastic light meal, especially on a hot night! Thank you for posting!

Awesome meal. I loved it and even my son ate it. Next time I would cut some of the pepper or garlic, but only because my husband thinks it is too spicy (he grew up on bland food and has no taste buds).

Whether you try it as written or add a few extra ingredients this is excellent! I didn't have any wine so I added about 3/4 can chicken broth to make more sauce as several suggested. I also added the capers which I think gave the tang missed by not having wine. Along with the shrimp (I used precooked this time) I added 2 sliced green onions, capers, and 2 chopped plum tomatoes & basil straight to the skillet and did not bother to reduce the liquid. I cooked thin spaghetti pasta el-denta, drained, and added to pan, salted to taste & added butter & parsley.  Had lots of extra "sauce" to slurp up. Wish I'd had some crusty bread. This is nice and light and we both had 2 large servings! Excellent for summer.

pretty good but it needed more ingredients to become at least a four star dish. i found that the recipe lacked sauce so i doubled the amount of chicken broth and butter and added some cream for a thicker sauce. i also added a pinch of saffron, thyme,onion powder,paprika, green onion, mushrooms, and cayenne pepper. great dish for everyone to enjoy. i served my shrimp over rice.

Easy, quick, tasted like nothing I've ever had before. i personally didnt care for how wine-y the shrimp tasted, but it was my first time cooking with wine so I'll still give 5 stars. I doubled the sauce seeing other reviews, glad I did. Will make again, thank you!

This was good.  I can't believe I'm going to say this, but it was a little too rich...and NOTHING is ever too rich for me.  I also didn't like the flavor of the basil.  Next time I will leave out the basil and reduce the fresh parsley...I also won't overcook the shrimp and will add more lemon and less butter.

good, easy pasta dish.  quick enough for weeknights.  I didn't have any wine on hand so I just used more chicken broth and it was still good.  good for when you want to do pasta but are tired of red sauce.

Simple to make, pretty dish, and quite yummy!  Only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 as if I had added the full 2 tsp of pepper, that would have been way too much!  I added just 1 tsp, and my husband said that was still too much.  I mostly followed the rest of the recipe except didn't have any basil on hand, and added shredded Parmesan cheese on top. My shrimp took longer than a few minutes to cook.  I used some really fat noodles and let it really soak up the thin sauce before serving, oh and I did double the wine/chicken broth as others suggested and am glad I did.  I could see this being really good with some cream as well.  I do recommend this recipe and will definitely make again!

Beginner cook here and this was an easy great tasting dish. Only differences, I used dried herbs which tasted fine to me. Also, the lemon was a little overpowering but I did use a larger lemon. Next time I might use the juice from a lemon half instead of the whole thing. Overall, fantastic recipe and will make again.

This would have been better if it had not been overpowered by so much lemon. I definitely will try it again, but will start with the lemon zest & just a squirt of fresh lemon, adding more if needed per taste.

Delicious & easy. I had to use spaghetti noodles, thought I had linguine, worked great!  Also used a little bit of red wine instead of white & still loved it.  Didn't really measure anything,  I just did it all by taste.

Made this for Valentine's Dinner. Both my husband and I loved it.  I followed the advice of others and doubled the broth and wine.  I also added 1 tsp of Italian Seasoning.   I thought the pepper overwhelmed even though I reduced the black pepper by half and did add a little red pepper flakes.  Will definitely make this again but with less black pepper.  All in all, this was definitely restaurant worthy and the shrimp came out very, very moist.  One other comment, allow a little extra time for the sauce to reduce.  It took about 15 minutes at medium low heat (I have a gas range so temperature control is a tad easier.

Delicious.  Only used 1 tsp pepper, and omitted basil.  Wanted more sauce, but not more fat, so added only more broth and wine.  My husband loved it.

One of my family's favorite meals! I increase the chicken stock to one cup to make more sauce. Sautéed garlic in coconut oil...delicious!

So easy, fast, and very tasty! I wouldn't change a thing, though I had only dried basil and no parsley. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a very delicious dish, but I felt that the lemon was too strong to I only used a quarter of a up of Lemon juice, but other than that, I'd make no changes.

Delicious and easy.  I use lemon pepper instead of plain pepper.  Aside from that, no changes.

This is one of my kids favorite meals!!! They ask me to make it at least once a week. I doubled the amount of sauce ingredients but kept the pepper the same cause it was slightly to peppery the first time. I also add green olives right at the end cause i'm prego and i crave them but everyone else seems to love them too!

This is a fast and tasty recipe. I reduced the amount of pepper by 1/4 and it was still very peppery and spicy. If you aren't sure, use less and add it to taste.  I could have used a bit more lemon. It's all dependent on your tastes I think. But a nice quick weeknight recipe!

I just finished making this. I too, used seafood medley bag that I had on hand. Otherwise, I made it exactly as the recipe states. Flavor is amazing; however, I found that, for my taste, the sauce was too diluted. So... I added about a Tb of cornstarch and it did the trick! VERY yummy and easy! This will be a regular for us.

This recipes was absolutely amazing! My whole family loved it! I multiplies the sauce by 1.5 and doubled the lemon juice. It took me an extra 50 minutes to make it, but I spend more time cooking noodles than normal, and I am a beginner cook on my dad's account. :) I've been cooking for a year now, and I'd say that this was one of the best recipes I have ever made!

Awesome base recipe!  The ingredients (lemon, pepper, basil, parsley and garlic) are all subject to taste.  You could probably put ten people in a room and all would have a different preference.  Its a good base recipe if you adjust to taste after the initial  try.  Very good! Thank you!

Amazing! Super flavorful and pretty easy. I doubled the sauce recipe and added 1/2 cup heavy cream. Just to tigthen it up and add richness. Also cut the black pepper down  a bit  but added red pepper flakes for heat. So freakin good!  A go to pasta at my house.

Easy to make and a very light but tasty dish. Didn't need to add any salt (chicken broth had enough). Made enough for 8 servings so I doubled everything but the pepper (used a tablespoon) which does give the recipe a little kick. Used a Beringer Pinot Grigio and had enough left over to serve with the dish. Nice pairing.

I used the "good cholesterol" margarine, skip the wine (just never have it on hand), frozen fully cooked shrimp, lower salt chicken boullion cube, and it never ceases to amaze me how great this turns out.

This dish is AMAZINGLY tasty.  I followed the directions perfectly, except I used whole wheat penne noodles, and was pleasantly surprised. I took a bowl of leftovers to work and upon finishing it, I was SOOOO tempted to lick the bowl.  My picky boyfriend loved it as well.  This recipe will definitely be added to the "repeat" list.

This is a great recipe that you may tweak to your own taste.  I added a can of artichokes, shaved parmesan and toasted pine nuts (you must toast them!)  I liked the lemon flavor and would use a little more, plus I would also recommend more garlic.  I used thin spaghetti and it was fine.  I also would try adding diced tomatoes.  It was quite "brothy" and this would be great in a bowl with garlic toast dipped in the broth.  A definite A+ recipe!

It was delicious!!! I doubled the recipe so I'd have plenty for my family. I still only used 1 lb. of shrimp. I didn't use fresh parsley, I used dried. I also had to use frozen raw shrimp that were already peeled because my grocery didn't have fresh raw shrimp. My suggestions are to prep before you start cooking the sauce. Chop your basil & zest the lemons before you start the garlic. I also added grated Parmesan cheese to the plate. It brought out the flavor if the sauce SO much. This is definitely a keeper!

Excellent. Took a bit of prep time, but tastes just like I got it from my favorite Italian restaurant. Added capers on step 3, and it really enhanced the flavor. Will make again.

Absolutely delicious recipe!  Because of food preferences and dietary restrictions of the family, I made it without chicken stock and used oil instead of butter.  Also, I made homemade linguini so that brought everything to the next level.  I ended up using the full amount of pepper and I thought it was perfect (but I love very peppery foods).  I will definitely be making this again.

I made this last night. I don't it shrimp so I sauteed mushrooms, red and green peppers and onions. Also, I had some Mahi-Mahi on hand that I decided to cut in chunks. I doubled the sauce as suggested by other reviewers. I also topped my individual serving with 4C Parmesan cheese. I was delish. I had it for dinner last night, lunch today and dinner tonight.

It was delicious. I made half again the sauce and also saved some lemon zest and fresh garlic to toss in with the linguini at the end, which brightened the flavors. Guests were suitably impressed!

I thought this was a great base, and very easy to tweak to your personal preferences. I reduced the amount of pepper, added some garlic powder, a little more wine, broth, and a splash more lemon juice. I topped with fresh grated parmesan cheese. Yum!

We thought this was very good.  I followed other reviewers’ suggestions and made twice as much sauce.  In addition, I used dried basil, and decreased the amount of pepper as a personal preference.  We enjoyed it.

I generally love lemon -- the more, the better! -- but I think the juice of one lemon was too much for this recipe. Maybe my lemon was too large or juicy, but the overall effect was too acidic. Overall, the recipe's not bad. I'll probably try it again, just with less lemon juice.

Loved, loved, loved this recipe!  I did increase the sauce ingredients, but not the pepper and it was perfect.  Added langostinos along with the shrimp to make it even more tasty, if possible!  Fresh lemon and herbs are essential.

Enjoyed this.  Followed the recipe except added only half the pepper.  Also was too lazy to make a salad so added a few broccoli crowns to the pasta/water the last couple of minutes of cooking the pasta and some fresh tomatoes to the shrimp mix.  Made a fresh, light lemony shrimp prima. vera.  Thanks for the inspiration.

Really enjoyed the original recipe! Enough to experiment several times afterwards.  Adds some time, but simmered shrimps shells in water, added to liquids for the reduction. Increased the shrimp presence.  Also, doubled sauce as suggested and cooked pasta in it as it reduced - intensified all the flavors. Occasionally add some chopped black olive.  Can you tell I make this often?!

This is not Alfredo like some people may think, it's more of a buttery sauce. It was very AMAZING and I followed other reviews and doubled the sauce and added a tablespoon or two or sour cream to thicken the sauce. I loved the lemony garlicy taste!

this came out Super good.. the recipe was a perfect jumping point for us.. except for the pasta, shrimp, and butter.. we doubled everything.. only had angel hair pasta.. wanted to bump it up with veggies.. so added about 1.5 cups of both broccoli and mushrooms.. we love pungent food so the double amount of lemon and pepper totally worked for us.. ty so much for the recipe!

Excellent dish! This tastes like something you could get at a resturant!

I would agree with others that you need to make more sauce. I added a touch of heavy cream to make the sauce a little thicker and it was great. My only suggestion is to not add the pasta to the dish all at once. Add it little by little so that you can decided how "wet" you want your pasta. I personally like my pasta saucey so by adding all of it at once, it was on the dry side and I even made extra sauce. Next time I will make half the pasta from the box or make triple the sauce. 

All in all it was a great dish and its been added to the recipe box!

5 stars! This was delicious!  I made the following changes: bowtie pasta instead of linguini, added broccoli.  My kids, who are just learning to use chopsticks, nicknamed this dish "chopsticks" because the pieces are small enough to permit easy handling by chopsticks.  Overall, an easy, low-fat, delicious meal.

Easy to make and delicious.  I backed off the pepper just a bit so it was not too spicy for the kids.  Otherwise, followed the recipe and loved it.

This has become one of our family favourites... delicious! I also double the recipe because I find that it is not quite enough sauce for my taste...I like the pasta very moist. I also use fresh pasta as it soaks up the sauce better and tastes so much richer!

Used 1/2 veggie boullion cube in place of chicken broth. Used 1 1/2 tsp. EVOO.  Served with lemon wedge.  Used 1/2 T butter for 2 servings. Used more fresh basil. Perfect with Morissette Angel Chardonnay or Primal Roots white blend.  288 calories per serving

I absolutely loved it.  Although I thought it had a little too much pepper for  my taste. Next time I will reduce the pepper to half and increase the sauce.  We loved it.  I will defiantly be putting it in my favorites

Great recipe! Tweaked it  a bit to my liking. Added rep chilli flakes to the garlic and oil. Didn't do any measuring but know I did reduce the amount of pepper, definately would have been too much with 2tsp. Also, after reducing and adding pasta to sauce, add a bit of pasta water to loosen the sauce then you'll avoid any dryness for those of you who thought you needed to double sauce ingredients. Finish it with parmesan for added flavour and voila! so good!

I had never cooked with any sort of shrimp before I made this recipe but this seemed so simple I thought it would be a good way to start. It was great, and the only additional I made was some finely chopped sweet summer peppers.

We had "left overs" so I made a white sauce the next evening and combined it with this recipe; kicked it up a knotch!  Also, I added capers to my plate (hubby not interested)...I though the capers added zip to an already wonderful dish.

This is a really yummy recipe. I doubled the sauce as others suggested and used dry herbs instead of fresh, less of course. I will definitely be making this again for guest.

I made this last night for dinner and my family and I absolutley enjoyed it.  I did add more shrimp and next time I would definitely use less pepper.  It was a little to spicy for my little guys.

Easy to make.  One of the best pasta and shrimp recipes I have found.  I used frozen already cooked shrimp from Wally Mart and surprisingly they were very tender and tasty.  The taste was great, but I wish it were a more creamier recipe.

have made this many times but have used the whole wheat pasta instead. Delish!  I also use less garlic, less pepper, but more lemon zest. This is wonderful with a green salad and rustic bread (something whole wheat, of course!). A real staple on our weekly menu!

Awesome flavor!  Better than a lot of Shrimp Scampi recipes I've tried.  Only changes I made were using spaghetti (had no linguini), dried parsley as I didn't have fresh.  However, I did have some awesome fresh basil from a farmer's market.  I also added a little red pepper flakes as I like the "kick".  Will definitely make again.  Thank you for the great recipe.

I made this last night and it was tasty.  I added more chicken broth and wine since we like a good amount of sauce with macaroni.  I also spiced it up with some red pepper flakes.  It's a quick and easy meal to make.

This was delicious!  I cut the butter in half to be a bit more health conscience and I dont think I would even taste the difference with full butter.  I did pepper to taste (prob ~1.5 tsp) and omitted the parsley (personal preference).  Next time I would add add more shrimp! Definitely a keeper!

wonderful light tasting dish, i made it twice so far, once i used real lemon juice because i didn't have lemons and second time used lemons and lemon zest....definitely fresh lemons wins, i left all other ingredients the same, liked the pepper content and doubled all sauce ingredients, used fresh parsley and basil, big difference there opposed to dry, and i used angel hair pasta second time and it was great! a keeper...of course as always spices to taste.

I made this with bowties and lots of extra veggies for my toddler, and she loved it.  I scaled down on the pepper, and next time I'll scale down on the lemon and butter as well and add a tad more garlic.  Easy, simple recipe.

This Linguini dish was awesome! I made it for my husband yesterday for Valentine's Day and it was a hit. I did double the sauce like others suggested and made a few other changes just based on preference and what I had available:

used 3 cloves garlic instead of 6 (not a big garlic fan but still wanted the taste)

Did not use white wine instead increased the amount of chicken broth (We're not wine people)

Used lemon juice from a bottle instead of lemons and no lemon zest (didn't have lemons available)

Did not use fresh parsley and basil. Instead I used 4 tablespoons dried parsley (didn't have the fresh available) 

Added Parmesan on top at the end (fresh of course!)

I know rating 5 stars with changes irks some people but the changes I made I don't think changed the dish as they were for the most part taste preference (I don't want to rate something low because it has something I don't personally like). Anyways it's a great dish I would recommend for anyone to use.

I was looking for something with a not red sauce, since that's all I've ever made & it's not my husband's favorite. However I do not like creamy, white sauces so this recipe was definitely the ticket. I made it pretty much to original recipe (added a bunch of Italian blend cheese at the end) and it was delish along with cheddar garlic biscuits and a glass of sweet tea. :)

Absolutely delicious. I half the amount of black pepper - it is overpowering. I use a touch of olive oil to cook the shrimp instead of butter, much less fat. I also add halved cherry tomatoes for a nice crunch and sweetness.

Really good taste.  Mine was a little soupy, but I may have not reduced it enough.  Also added a can of artichoke hearts and some parm cheese.  Yummy.

Very good recipe!  I didn't think with those simple ingredients it'd turn out so authentic, the sauce tasted just like what you'd have @ restaurant!   One note thought: make sure you make the sauce saltier than usual, because once you mix it with the noodles, it becomes bland...  But overall a very good recipe, will definitely make again!

A-. A good recipe but very rich. The additional butter definitely adds a depth/richness to the dish but if you're looking to cut calories a la your 2011 new year's resolutions, cut the butter. Alittle margarine should be fine. For the shrimp, the lazy cook in me just bought a bag of frozen cooked shrimp, already deveined. This saved a whole whack of time. I just let the shrimp thaw out in the fridge over night, and then took the tails off before tossing them into the linguine near the end. Ensured they got evenly coated and they weren't overcooked or rubbery- a BIG hit at my house! :)

I made this last night and it was very delicious.   The recipe is VERY forgiving, thank God (and thank you Skini): I didn't have any linguine, so I substitued rigatoni pasta - a full 16-ounce package. I only had a 10-ounce package of shrimp, so I used that along with two salmon fillets that I cut into small pieces  I didn't have any wine on hand so I used an additional 1/4 cup of chicken broth. I used 1 teaspoon each of dried parsley and dried basil because I didn't have the fresh.   I did not double the sauce. Next time, I will decrease the amount of pepper because there was a bit of a kick. But even with the kick, the kids (9 and 14 year old boys) have requested this dish again and soon...as long as I use less pepper!    As for me, I think it'll be an easy dish to commit to memory and make as-is or with variations. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention that this dish is very quick to make!! As a working mom with football-playing boys who have voracious appetites, this is a HUGE plus!!  Bon appetit!

YUM!!! This recipe is SO good!! It was not too lemony, the butter toned down the lemon flavor. Make sure if you double the sauce recipe that you also double the butter as well. It was very easy to make. I made a few changes to the recipe though. I doubled the sauce recipe and I used fettuccine rather than linguine. I also topped it off with fresh Parmesan cheese after I plated it. I definitely will make this recipe again. I'm thinking about using chicken next time rather than shrimp.

Awesome recipe!  So easy to make, that even I cannot screw it up.  I would even recommend that you double the amount of lemon juice and zest. Otherwise, perfect. This one is a go-to for me, since I am not a exactly a cooking enthusiast, and when I cook for my wife every cooking preparation includes lots of wine/beer and good tunes (as it should always be)! Big thanks to "skini" for this great recipe!!! Joe

As usual I prepared the recipe exactly as written and it was a perfect quick dinner.  I served with a crisp green salad and crusty bread. Smaller portions would lend itself well to a company lunch.

One of my favorite dishes to make! I usually make the day before and let the noodles soak up the flavor and then serve it with parmesan sprinkled on top. SO GOOD!

Good recipe.  As others suggested I doubled the sauce and halved the amount of pepper but next time I would not double the amount of butter.  It came out a bit too greasy for my taste.

This was very delicious, I only put in half of the pepper and I quartered some grape tomatoes and tossed them in as well. Very good!

This was delicious.  The husband and the kids (8 and 4 years old) loved this.  I did double it for extra sauce.  Finally got a thumbs up from the 8 year old out of all the new recipes I have been trying.

Extremely fast and easy dish.  I added broccoli for some veggies and it was a nice addition.  I needed to add a bit of starch to thicken the very fluid sauce (which I doubled as I love sauce on pasta), and that did the trick!  Not a crazy WOW dish for company, but simple and satisfying for a night at home with family.

This turned out really good!  I was searching forever to find a good pasta/shrimp dinner that wasn't made with Alfredo sauce or coconut milk (which both are delish, but i'm trying to watch the calories) and I had everything on hand and it turned out yummy.  I doubled up on the sauce which was a good idea and I used thin spaghetti noodles cause thats all I had.  I used the Barilla Plus noodles (which I highly recommend) and it's not a full lb in the box, and I didn't use all the cooked noodles.  I left maybe 1/3 out.  I made it in about 40 mins, really easy, not a lot of prep at all. Yum!

Like others before me, this is a good base recipe but I didn't care for it as written.  I like to make a recipe as written the first time, then tweak to our tastes the next.  So, the second time I doubled the sauce ingredients and tried to temper the strong lemon flavor with 1 cup of heavy cream.   My husband doesn't like linguini so I used angel hair pasta and the liquid had nothing to 'stick' to.  All-in-all it has a nice flavor but we prefer a thicker sauce.  I may make a rogue next time.  Oh, and we added fresh parmesan after we plated it.  Thanks for sharing.

Awesome! I doubled the sauce recipe like some others did, and only added 1 tsp. of pepper because I thought 2 would be a little too much for me. (I'm a weenie when it comes to spice lol) Omg delish! I will definatly be making this again. Thanks so much :D

I tried this recipe tonight and needed to review! It is a delicious recipe. I didn't have garlic so I substituted with garlic salt and just added no salt anywhere else. The taste was still yummy! The sauce does need to be increased. My father loved it and went in for seconds (even slurping extra sauce!!). Overall a great recipe that is very flexible! Thanks skini!

Delicious! This is a "gourmet" tasting recipe but very quick and easy. (side note: I used 2T of powdered garlic instead of the garlic cloves b/c I didn't have fresh garlic. I also sprinkled some garlic on the pasta after I had stirred everything together. )

Very good! I didn't have the white wine on hand so i just added a 1/4 cup of extra chicken broth. My whole family loved it. It was pretty easy to throw together, the part that took the longest was chopping garlic and peeling the shrimp. If you buy the shrimp already peeled this meal is super quick and easy to make.

This dish was AWESOME!!  I like to be creative when I cook and tried something that may seem odd.  Try adding some sliced grape tomatoes just before serving.  The acidity of the tomatoes matches well with the lemon in the dish.

The dish is excellent. I did make a few changes, I doubled the broth and wine amounts.  Also, cut back on the amount of pepper and added capers.  Just a few tweeks to an otherwise great dish.

Awesome! I only substituted a sherry cooking wine instead of the white wine because I didn't have white wine or red wine vinegar...still came out good! I don't think you can go wrong with this one. Oh and I added green pepper because I needed to use it up. Next time I'll probably add broccoli or serve it on the side.

Easy, light, and tasty.  There is a generous amount of shrimp in this recipe.  We used the pre-cooked kind and heated it through.  A delicious alternative to heavy red sauces.

I followed the recipe exactly.!  My husband took one bite and wouldn't eat anymore and he is an "I'll eat anything" kinda guy.  I think the thin sauce was the biggest turn off.  We didn't enjoy the flavor at all.

Very tasty recipe; I doubled the pasta and tripled the sauce, and there was plenty of sauce and flavor! Used small langostino tails and bay scallops - 12oz & 16 oz respectively, and no surprise that they went well with the sauce.

Really enjoyed this, however, it was way too much pepper for us.  Next time I will put in 1 tsp instead.  Otherwise, loved it!  I followed the recipe as written and thought we had plenty of sauce.  I will be making this again.

Very good!  I doubled the sauce after reading the other reviews, and wish I hadn't.  That made it too "soupy".  Next time I'll try it as written, or maybe just add another half to the sauce.  Very good flavor... The whole family gobbled it up!

This was delicious!  I added some extra of each ingredient so it wasn't that dry.

2nd time I have made it this week!! I just LOVE this recipie! I add a little onion and double up on the wine and broth. Also, I have found that it is better if it has a chance to sit first so I made it a couple hours ahead of time and reheated right before serving. AMAZING!! Thanks for the post!

Love this! Restaraunt quality taste, but very easy to make! I did not have wine on hand so I used extra chicken broth. My husband and I both loved and gobbled it up! I used a little less pepper and parsley and I added a little more garlic (but of course all personal preferences) This one is a keeper!

I do have to say this recipe is awesome! I've made it a couple different times for my family and we love it, the sauce is delicious! I even made it with chicken instead of shrimp once and it was still scrumptious!

I didn't have any white wine so I used extra broth. Even so, I didn't like that much pepper and lemon. And found it too light (you couldn't really see the sauce - just taste the spice). I tried adding some milk and parmesan at the end. It helped, but I still don't plan to use this recipe again. Maybe the white wine was the key, but I'm not willing to risk another go.

This turned out pretty well. It was very easy and the ingredients were pretty simple. As many other reviewers mentioned, the sauce should be doubled. Additionally, I used a little less butter and topped it off some fresh grated parmesan cheese after plating. I would DEFINITELY recommend that.

This was pretty good, but the sauce wasn't very 'saucy' I added cornstarch to mine to make it thicker, so it would actually coat the pasta. The flavor was very good though, especially when a little Parmesan was added. Make sure to add plenty of salt and pepper.

I followed the recipe and it definitely did not make enough sauce. The dish was dry and peppery, and not very lemony. If I try making it again, I'll definitely make a lot more sauce for it.

This was easy and simple! It didnt require cheese or cream or too much time, which was what I was looking for.  I made it with chicken and just sauteed the chicken then added the garlic and then broth and wine. Reduced to half then added the butter and reduced even more...I also made slightly extra sauce and added some sauteed peas to the pasta in the end.  My husband and neighbors thought it was good too.

Really good got 4 out of 5 because there was some editing done that help bring out the flavor one being we used stock instead of broth. Made 2 versions one with pepper one without some people can't handle the intensity of the pepper but for me it came out good both ways

I made this for my boyfriend for a Valentine's Day dinner and he looooved it! Thank you to previous reviewers - I took the advice offered and made more sauce then the recipe specifies. We were sad that there were not any leftovers, I'll definitely be making this recipe again in the future!

This was just a little too lemony for our tastes. I will definitely make it again but I will reduce the amount of lemon by at least half and add more chicken broth to compensate. I made it with both shrimp and scallops. I also used only 3 cloves of garlic.

Good recipe - I doubled the pasta (it never looks like enough when it's in the pot!) I wish I didn't do that because like the other reviews, there wasn't enough sauce.  But that was my mistake.  Excellent flavor and a great change, making a shrimp recipe!

Holy  this is fantastic!  I doubled it cuz I have so many to feed.  Only change/addition I made was parmesan.  Sprinkled some in the noodles with a little olive oil then added them to the shrimp etc.  Everyone loved it!  The lemon flavor is fantastic.  Thanks for sharing!

Refreshing but a tad too light and a bit on the bland side for me.  Next time I'll probably add cream of mushroom or chicken.

really, really good, and really easy to make. I added a dash a red pepper flakes to give it some kick. We didn't have any lingini so I used baby bowtie pasta. With a good salad and a good bottle of wine, this could have been our  Valentine Dinner!

Loved it.  Had to use lemon juice instead of the real lemon.  Used 3 Tbsp but I will reduce that next time to 2 Tbsp.

This was easy and delish.  I followed the recipe to a T - except for I doubled the sauce and I used frozen cooked shrimp.  My hubby would have liked the sauce to be a little thicker so maybe next time I should cook longer?  It was good - regardless.  Oh - and because I have kids I didn't do too much pepper but put the pepper on the table for me and hubby.  Will definitely make again!

I love this recipe! I used whole wheat linguine, the whole lemon of zest, 2 tbsp butter and left out the parsley and basil.  I also added red pepper flakes for a little heat and freshly grated parmesan cheese for some saltiness.  As for the blue garlic.  Do not worry. I had that happen with another fish recipe.  I found out it is a chemical reaction between the garlic, the acidic lemon juice and the heat.

I don't know how it happened, but something in this mix turned my garlic blue! I think the sauce and noodles were good, but not as flavorful as I had hoped.

Though my husband is not a big shrimp or pasta fan, he thoroughy devoured this dish!  Made it with whole wheat pasta. The only bad thing is there are no leftovers. :(    Delish !!

Didn't have linguine, lemon, or white wine, so used rotini and a raspberry zinfandel instead.  Tasted great, but a little peppery.  I'm not sure if the lemon would have neutralized this a little better, however.  I would also suggest using a little bit less pepper- depending on what you like.  Maybe even half as much... 1 tsp instead of 2.  Otherwise, very tasty with the rotini! Also I used a vegetable spread instead of butter to reduce the calories and fat and it still tastes fabulous.

Really good, doubled sauce, used 1/2 cup lemon juice and dried lemon peel. could use more shrimp, maybe 2lbs. Used 16 oz of linguini. Should use 8 oz.

WOW, Awesome!  My hubby said he felt like he was eating at olive Garden  :)   I've made this 3 times, and it always turns out great.  Really flavorful.  I'm thinking I might use a small lemon next time.  The lemon flavor could be turned down a notch.  I also read a review about doubling the sauce.  That's a GREAT idea for this recipe.  Either way it's great.  I am thinking about making this for my vegitarian friend.  I'll just leave out the shrimp for her.   You have to try this recipe!!!

Solid recipe.  I used a small lemon which was really all the recipe needed without overpowering the pasta.   Pressed the lemon down while rolling it to ensure all the juices could be squeezed out.  I threw in precooked shrimp (no tails) and it tasted delicious.  Missing one star b/c it had the zest but was missing a kick like some dried chili pepper flakes.

So Good! This is one of my all time favorites.  There is a little too much pepper for anyone who doesn't like spicy flavoring (everything is too spicy for me!), and next time, I will definitely add some capers for extra flavor. But - excellent!! I will definitely make this again!!

I made Gina's Lemon Pepper chicken the night before and had plenty of leftovers.  So, I cut up the chicken and added it to this pasta instead of the shrimp and it was fantastic!  The only other change that I made was that I omitted the white wine, because we just didn't have any and added just a little more chicken broth and lemon juice.  The whole family loved this and there were no leftovers this time around!

A very nice light meal with something missing. My first thought was poppy seed, then I reconsidered and toasted some sesame seeds. The sesame seeds pulled the flavors together nicely.

I loved this dish! i made a couple modifications based on other reviews and doubled the sauce. I also had some red and yellow peppers and some mushrooms that I wanted to use up so I sauteed those at the same time as the garlic and it made it healthier and way more colorful and unique. i also added capers and used whole wheat spaghetti in place of the linguini. I will definatly make this again. The shrimp were so tender and took on the flavor of the sauce. I also added several dashes of hot sauce and it gave it a nice kick. LOVE this one!!

Easily the most made allrecipes.com recipe that we make in our household!  You can really taste the lemon and pepper in this dish.  The only thing we've tweaked over the past few months is to add cherry tomatoes for sweetness and color.

This was delish!  I made it as stated with the exception of adding some cut up asparagus and portabello mushrooms to it.  Thanks for a great recipe! :)

It was allright...nothing special to me. My husband liked it though....we did not use as much pepper as stated due to others comments. I figured we could add it as we ate it if we wanted more.

Very easy to prepare and quite delicious!  The lemon zest gives it a fresh, lively taste.  I reduced the pepper a little.  Used precooked shrimp, adding for just the last few minutes to coat the shrimp in the sauce and heat the shrimp through, and it worked great.  Elegant enough for company.

This was really delicious and simple to make.  It is not often that ALL of my family likes the same dish.  I did make a few adjustments since my youngest child does not like "spicy" foods...even though the rest of us love the pepper!  I doubled the sauce part of the recipe, but kept the pepper at 2 tsp.  I kept the butter at 1/4 cup to cut down on fat, and added NO salt since the broth already had it.  This worked out well.  Next time, I will throw in a some sliced red bell pepper pieces or another colorful vegetable to give the dish some color and add nutritional value.  YUM!

This is awesome.  I added mushrooms with the garlic because I had some mushrooms and mushrooms taste good with everything, even ice cream.  I didn't have a lemon to juice or zest, so I just used bottled lemon juice equivalent and that worked fine.  It works with spaghetti!  But, I don't like linguini, so, you know, biased.

this was perfect!! So garlicky and not too heavy. I thought the amount of sauce was perfect. I did reduce the pepper but season to taste. I used fresh spinach fettuccine. Delicious!

I thought this was great!  I used chicken instead of shrimp, since I'm not much of a seafood person.  I didn't use pepper at all and instead just used a little bit of lemon & pepper seasoning salt, it was amazing!

Delicious and easy to make!!  Made this fairly easily (and I'm only a teenager.)  Everyone in my house loved it, even my dad who will only eat pasta with red sauce and my sister who will only eat pasta with butter.

I actually had all of these ingredients in my house! We had some lovely fresh shrimp and this recipe was perfect for it. The sauce has a lovely, light, soft flavor. Perfect for when you don't want to eat heavy foods.

This is one of my boyfriend's favorite recipes. For him to comment is a big deal... he'll eat gravel and not notice. Make sure you double the sauce, half the pepper, and I used lemon pepper flavored linguini (American Italian Pasta Company). One of my favorites.

Took the advice and doubled the sauce but other than that followed the recipe. Wonderful garlic and lemon flavor, white wine gives it a nice kick. Will def be making again.

I really liked this recipe. I eyeballed the dry ingredients and it turned out pretty good, not too peppery. My hubby did not care for it because of the amount of lemon in it. I think next time I will use less lemon juice, just for his taste, but I really liked it! Thanks!

This was an excellent dish. Very easy to make and delicious.   The only thing I did differently was played around with the quantities of each ingredient to better suite my taste. I added more sauce and slightly less pepper when making the sauce.   Overall excellent dish. Thank you!

My husband was sceptical about the lemon in this recipe as he thought it may be too strong. However, it is subtle and now he requests it. I have also used chicken instead of shrimp and it turned out quite nice. Do not add extra salt to the recipe. It overwhelms the subtle flavors.

I thought this dish was great but 100% necessary to double the liquids - the reason I gave it 4 stars. This is a light tasting dish (even with all that butter) and was incredibly easy. Made it for mothers day and was well received by all. I did have a side of parm cheese for anyone who wanted it. Will difinitely make again but always with that extra sauce - can't imagine the recipe without it since my end result wasn't liquidy.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I did take others' suggestions and use just a little less pepper than called for, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.  I also used whole wheat linguine because we try to do whole grain when possible and it turned out wonderfully.  Very light but very flavorful, and presented well too.  My husband told me to make sure I save this recipe, and that's always a good sign!

wonderful dish. if you're not sure how sour you want it, i would add the lemon more slowly to taste. the combination of flavors is delicious though! it also keeps really well - it tasted even better the next day.

Absolutely delicious.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and I don't know if I will do that again.  It was really runny.  Maybe I didn't let it cook down enough?  Anyway - I will make it again.  My husband LOVED.

Doubled everything except the shrimp and lemon and it came out good.  Did add maybe a TBSP or 2 more lemon juice instead of a whole other lemon.  Not 5 stars but quite tasty.

The reason I gave this a low score is because the recipe calls for 1 lemon.  I think the lemon I juiced is bigger & juicier.  Thus the recipe turned out to be so sour.  But I turned it around.  I added more broth and wine (to taste) and decided to make an Alfredo out of it.  Added 4 oz of crm chz and 1/2 cup of milk with a tbsp of cornstarch.  Plus I substituted half of the shrimp with bay scallops.  Viola!  Now I made a Creamy-Lemon Seafood Linguini.  I should submit that for a recipe.

I was looking for a different way to serve pasta that was quick and simple.  This is it!  I'm allergic to shrimp so we did not add it with the pasta.  I used penne because that is what I had on hand.  I thought my daughter would not like the amount of parsley etc. so I strained the sauce before adding the pasta.  I also added some grated cheese to the mixture.  This recipe was a great change from our normal side dishes!

Delish and easy!  Based on other reviews I cut back the pepper to 1 tsp and used a little less zest so that the butter and garlic flavors would come out more.

Easy, Lemony, Peppery.  Just as described. Didn't change a thing, and we all loved it. I served mine w/hot pepper flakes on the side for those who like extra heat and got raves. Thanks

This was really, really good.  I skipped the lemon zest as other users had suggested and it was the perfect amount of lemon.  I also used dried basil and parsley since I didn't have them handy.  The one thing I did do and won't do again is double the amount of sauce as others suggested.  It was way too much and it almost seemed to be too soupy.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but it was still too much.

This was excellent! I made this a couple of months ago exactly as the recipe read and my boyfriend is still talking about it! I'm going to make it for him again this weekend. I think the amount of lemon is great, but I love lemon. Myself, I'd prefer a little less pepper - just the one teaspoon. Thanks for making me appear to be a good cook! ;-)

I've made this 3 times and we have definitely noticed that using fresh pasta, fresh shrimp and herbs makes a HUGE, HUGE difference. We loved it the first and 3rd time because we only used fresh ingredients.

I would definitely recommend increasing the sauce to pasta ratio.  I cut back on the amount of pasta that I added (as I was cooking for only myself and my SO) and it was perfect.  I also took the advice of others and cut back on the amount of pepper...you can always add more later.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I am dealing with an overabundance of lemons from my tree, so this recipe looked like a great way to help me use them up. I cut way back on the ground pepper - I just eyeballed how much I wanted to use. It was probably like 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. I also used dried basil and dried parsley because I didn't feel like buying fresh and that's what I had in the cupboard. This recipe was good, but the whole family felt a bit "lemoned out" after eating it. If I were to make it again I might cut back on the lemon just a bit!

This was easy and delicious! I was looking for a light pasta recipe and this was perfect! I did double the sauce as some reviewers suggested. My DH loved it and ate the little we had left for lunch the next day. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very yummy pasta dish. Is more of a lighter dish but the garlic and the white wine make your kitchen smell "too die for". I will add a little more sauce next time as it really makes the dish!

I added chicken, cooking it with some onions & garlic before everything else.  This recipe is great.  I doubled the sauce (as others had suggested) and it was just enough.  Will definitely make again!

WOW!!!! That was so good. I didn't have any fresh basil so I used the dry. I had bought frozen raw shrimp with no tails, rinsed in water about three times then put in the pan. Topped with mozzarella. Will definitely make again.

This recipe wasn't half bad. I think it is better re-heated so the sauce thickens more. I did also add less pepper, but not too much less. DO NOT use pre-cooked shrimp, because they tend to get tough...especially upon re-heating.

I did decrease the pepper and increase the amount of sauce.  Also, to make it more healthy and colorful I stirred in 1 small zucchini, chopped, at the same time shrimp is added. Then, just before serving, I stirred in 1 chopped tomato.  It was really delicious!

Great recipe!  I made this with a date and we LOVED it.  I used the white wine we were drinking instead of cooking wine.  We skipped the salt and used low-salt chicken broth.  Also halved the pasta.  I'd definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe. I substituted limes for the lemon and chicken broth for the wine--didn't have any on hand. I also added a little half and half to make it thick like alfredo sauce because that's what my family likes. They are picky eaters and they really liked this recipe.

This is amazing. I increased the sauce amount and decreased the pepper amount as suggested. Also, I used thin spagetti and really liked it, but it's possible that I'd have liked it more with linguini(not sure how that would be possible!) I used frozen salad shimp so I think it would've been even better with fresh shrimp. The fresh herbs and garlic really kick it over the top. Also, the wine flavor is nicely subtle in the lemony-butter sauce. I"ll be making this again soon.

Absolutely awesome!  I doubled the sauce, as suggested by other reviewers, and used 1 lb. of frozen precooked shrimp (defrosted under water then reheated in sauce).  The recipe definitely has some kick, but could easily be modified to lessen the blow.  Just fantastic!

This is a great dish! I'm not a big shrimp lover, but this is fabulous! The only thing I did was add a little bit of heavy whipping cream to make the sauce thicker.

Hubby, kids and I love this recipe.  I have added this to our monthly menu at least once or twice the past 4 months.  I double the sauce, reduced the lemon juice/zest a tad, throw in a few diced mini sweet peppers or fresh mushrooms (kid's favorite).  This recipe can easily be adjusted to suit your family's taste and it's so QUICK and YUMMY!

This is a great recipe. It's easy, fast (not counting peeling and deveining the shrimp), and taste wonderful! 
I did reduce the pepper to 1 tsp and added 1/2 cup of parsley instead of  3 tbsp.

I made this to the T except I didn't use shrimp! The sauce looked awesome, so that's what I made! I served it over spaghetti and put chicken over it and tofu (the Caribbean Delight recipe from this site). I will keep the sauce recipe to use again!

Really good - I added Scallops too.  Be careful if you you use frozen seafood because it will add water to the sauce and make it thin.  This was really easy and really good - my husband loved it!

So good...very similar to shrimp scampi, but not quite the same.  My husband loves when I make this dish...and I personally love anything involving shrimp, wine, and lemon.  This is really great -- thanks!

Excellent recipe!!  My husband who is very picky, absolutely loved it.  We live in Louisiana, so shrimp is a staple in our diet and is my husband's favorite. I was nervous about this because he likes his shrimp fried or cooked with cajun seasoning. He got a little worried when he saw what I was putting in the skillet, but he raved about it when it was done! Great recipe.  Thanks!

Very nice dish. Be careful with the lemon juice. I never have fresh lemons on hand, so I use the bottled stuff. It doesn't specify how much juice equals one lemon.

I made 1/2 recipe using fettuccini.  This was fantastic and I only made a couple adjustments per other’s comments. I added a few red pepper flakes in with garlic and oil. I used a little less of the zest and lemon juice.  Next time I would only use 1/2 bag (7 oz) of 21-25 shrimp.  I also added a little pasta water when I pulled it together and put a little parmesan on top.  Definately will make again very soon!  Thanks!

Awesome recipe!  Very tasty.  I created an account just so I could rate this.

I increased the sauce by 1 1/2 times.  I also used a little less pepper, as was suggested in some reviews - but wished I'd used more.

I agree that this dish tastes like it comes from an Italian restaurant.  My 5 year old and 18 month old loved this.

I have made this recipe several times and I must say it beats Caraba's shrimp lemon linguini. I didn't add as much pepper as it calls for and I dobled the sauce. The only problem that we found is that the sauce is to liquity but today I am making it again and am going to use some corn starch to thicken it... Skini thank you sooooooooo much for this awesome meal... 

PS: acompany this with the fresh tomatoe salad recipe found here on all recipes and you would have the best meal you can buy on a 5 star restaurant...

 buen provecho

This recipe was fantastic!  It is very easy to prepare - I took the advice of some other reviewers and doubled the sauce, though it turned out to be a bit too much for the amount of pasta I had made.  However, the overall taste of the dish is fantastic, and surprisingly, we didn't find it too peppery at all.  I thought it was absolutely great!

I doubled everything except the pepper and I think it still needed more sauce.  The flavor was great, though.  I added fresh broccoli during the last 4 minutes of boiling the pasta.  It went really well with the lemon flavor of the sauce and added nice color to the dish.

My boyfriend never liked shrimp.  He bought me some, and I made this dish for supper.  He was going to pick around the shrimp, but I convinced him to try a bite.  He LOVED it.  He continues to tell the story and raving about this recipe.  It's great!  I've made it twice exactly the way it says.  Both times it's been wonderful, and not very hard to do.  Thanks!

Really good.  Light enough for a hot summer day, yet filling.  My anti-pasta-must-have-meat-husband even took seconds and thirds.  I made it just as written except did double the sauce (definitely the way to go) and went a bit easy on the pepper (a generous 1t vs. the 2t that it called for) and added some heavy cream at the end to thicken it.  Yummy.

This is an awesome dish!  Thanks so much "skini"!!!  The only change I made was to double the sauce & it was perfection!  My finicky sons couldn't get enough... went back for thirds. Great dish!

So tasty and easy to make. Looks and tastes like something you would order in a fancy restraunt. I didnt have white wine so I used Marsala instead. I think doubling the sauce would be good next time as I think there wasnt enough and maybe more shrimp. Nice light taste!

This was quite good.  I did cut back a bit on the pepper just to please the taste of my 3 kids.  It was easy and light and I will certainly make it again.

Very tasty, i added half a chopped onion with the garlic. At the end i added 1/4 or less of heavy cream to thicken it up and stick to the pasta. I used preminced jar garlic so i ended up guessing on the  amount. Kids were ok on it. Their loss.

This is by far the tastiest pasta recipe that I have ever had/made!!! I got so many compliments when I made it for a dinner party! Everyone thought that it tasted just like an authentic Italian recipe! I did make a few substitutions tho, just for personal taste and presentation value.  I diced half a red pepper very small and added it for extra flavour/colour.  I also used lemon pepper as well as omitted the white wine (i didn't have any) and used some chicken broth.  I also topped it with some fresh grated parm chz, which helped soak up some of the extra liquid! Eveything turned out so good, and soo easy! Thanks for the recipes!

I followed this recipe almost exactly but just added a little fat free half and half to make it creamier, and used a little more lemon and wine for more sauce (based on other suggestions).  It was very tasty and my husband was impressed.  I plan to make this again for company.

There wasn't anything blaringly bad about this recipe, but nothing fabulous either. Doubled the sauce recipe which I think was a good idea as there was a perfect amount of it. Lemon and pepper flavors were sharp, but everything else kind of weirdly bland. Used homemade noodles which I think saved the recipe. 

FYI: garlic when cooked with lemon can turn a blueish green. Safe and normal, but kind of weird to see colored chunks in your white noodles with clear sauce.

This was wonderful!  My husband and son, both picky eaters, loved this!  I will be making this again. If I were to do anything different, I would use maybe 1-1/2 to 2 lbs of shrimp...we love shrimp.  Maybe a bit more sauce too.  But it was delicious!

Very Good and very simple. I would adjust
the herbs the next time for our own personal tastes. The linguini and the sauce alone would make a great side dish.
Thanks for sharing.

This is the first recipe that I have tried on this site that did not meet my expectations.  It was a bit bland (I followed the recipe on the amounts) and not what I was expecting based on the reviews.  I tried to salvage it by adding fresh parmesan cheese.

Not difficult at all...did not use the lemon zest, but did juice a whole lemon. Used a bit of dried parsely and basil instead of fresh...great topped with shredded parmesan and garlic bread! Wonderful Dish!

I didn't have certain ingredients and substituted which I think was a mistake because the flavor was not there. It smelled wonderful, but the taste was lacking. I hope to use it again soon and try again!

So tasty! I doubled the sauce as others recommended. Also used half lemon pepper, half black pepper which added a nice zing. Added asparagus, topped with parmesan and used half the butter to save on calories, still delicious and flavorful! Definitely going in my favorites.

Excellent and easy to adapt to different flavors!!  I skipped the shrimp and added fresh chopped tomato as I stirred the pasta in.  Next time I'll try grilled chicken, artichoke hearts, asparagus, or capers!!  Perfect light lemon sauce for pasta (of ANY variety imo).

I had to modify the recipe somewhat because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, but even though lemon is one of my all-time favourite flavours, I though it was too strong.

This recipe is awesome! I double the sauce recipe, even though it's only for 2 of us. We like a lot of sauce! I read on another recipe to thicken sauce with bread crumbs, which turned out awesome. I just added pinchfuls in until it was thick enough for me. I will make this again and again.

This was very good!!  I liked that the lemon did not overpower the shrimp.  My 12 yr old son, who is very picky, said it was good and asked for seconds.  This is a keeper!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This really does have great flavor!  Its simplicity showcases the shrimp beautifully.  i did not have linguini on hand, so used artichoke-flour spaghetti (try it some time; it is not weird, but really delicious).  And I had to use frozen shrimp and dried parsley.  Still delicious and my husband raved.

I made this last night for a few friends and it was AMAZING! My one friend is the owner of a very upscale restaurant and a "foodie" and so I was very nervous making him dinner (even though he insisted he'd love whatever I made -- yeah, right!) But I put the plates in front of my guests and the first words out of his mouth was, "This smells great!" He took a bite and said, "This has GREAT flavor!" I followed the advice of others and added more zest, more wine, and more broth. I also added some freshly chopped shallot and some sliced mushrooms. YUM!!! The flavor was unreal. I was nervous at first when I saw that the sauce wasn't thickening up, but it wasn't supposed to be a thick sauce, so don't let that worry you... I felt like I was eating at a fancy restaurant! I WILL make this dish again when I'm trying to impress! Thank you!!

Wow this recipe was really great! I did add more liquid to it because others said it needed more. I added 3/4C. chicken stock 2 lemons instead of just one and the additional 1/4C heavy cream the other reviewers tried and it was SOOO good! My 3 year old even ate it up! I will make this one again for sure!

This was a great base recipe, but I felt like it needed more sauce and more lemon flavor. I think next time, I'll use 1 cup of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of wine, and maybe the juice of 2 lemons. I like the idea of adding some heavy cream, so maybe I'll just do that instead. I love lemon pepper and shrimp, so I'll definately be playing with this recipe some more. I'll check in later when I decide what works best. :0)

This was so good. My 2 year old normally talks a mile a minute during dinner, but she didn't utter a word because she was too busy slurping the linguini!

My husband and I couldn't stop talking about this!!!  When I made it, I didn't realize that I had bought a 2 lb bag of shrimp until it was all poured into the pan.  We really liked it with the extra shrimp.  I also added a little bit of heavy whipping cream (maybe 1 tbs?) to the sauce to thicken it just a little.  It was wonderful!!!

This is a delicious recipe.  I have not made it for anyone that didn't think it was absolutely fabulous--even my husband, who is a picky eater.  It is excellent as is, but I added some mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes, which made it even more flavorful.  As other people have noted, I doubled the sauce to make it go further.

Thanks for the post! This the first recipe I am able to make consistently great. The recipe is easy to follow and foolproof. The only changes I've made are omitting the lemon (my husband isn't a fan) and using penne in place of linguini. I have made this a bunch of times already (at my husband's request) and will make a hundred times more. Thanks again!

This was good.  I was a bit nervous when my sauce looked green, but once you add the shrimp and noodles it looks and tastes great.  The pepper complimented the lemon flavor nicely.

I wasn't sure about the sauce at first (because it had the consistency of chicken broth), but after adding a little heavy cream and pouring the sauce over the pasta, it was GREAT!!  I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased the amount of lemon juice, but I won't reduce it next time.  SO GOOD

This was an overall good recipe. I doubled up on the sauce recipe, but I cut back on the lemon juice and added more chicken stock. It came out wonderful. I had enough sauce (which was really more like a broth) to ladle it over the shrimp and linguine. It was really nice. I only had frozen shrimp on hand so I just sauted them in a seperated skillet with some salt and pepper to bring out all of the water in them and then I added them to the liquid. I also only had dried herbs and didnt want to spend so much on fresh ones when I wasnt going to use them all, and the dried ones worked out beautifully. Great Dish!!! P.S. I also had some green onion on hand that I threw in

I wanted to make lemon pepper linguine, and got this recipe through a Google search.  I made it with chicken breast I'd marinated in a lemon vinaigrette instead of shrimp and doubled the amount of sauce.  Needless to say, my husband went crazy over it. It was simple and didn't take that long.  He can't wait until I make it again.

This is awesome!  Do double the sauce.  Do NOT double the pepper.  I had leftover cooked shrimp that I needed to get rid of, and this was a great choice.  I’m sure it’s even better with fresh shrimp.  I’m not a huge “lemony” fan, but it wasn’t at all overpowering.

I really enjoyed the flavors in this recipe, my hubby however HATED it. Was happy to eat pasta without a heavy red sauce. Didn't add lemon zest, couldn't find my zester.  Will make again, maybe my hubby will come around.

This was the first pasta dish I've ever tried to make, and succeeded! All I had was macadamia nut linguini but that worked really well. It WAS pretty lemony, but that's one reason I loved it. I also added mushrooms for the heck of it. The sauce is almost pesto-like with all the dark green herbs.

If I can make this, anybody with half a brain can.

Good, but not great...i didn't have the basil or parsley, so it would probably be better with those ingredients next time.  I'll try it again sometime following the recipe exactly.

Very good; fast and easy! Make extra sauce and do use linguine pasta ss it holds or absorbs the sauce well.  Didn't use as much pepper - you could still taste the spice of it though.  Don't let the oil get too hot before you add the garlic or it will burn as soon as you put it in (and it sticks to my pan.)

I really liked this, my daughter made it for me for Mother's day.  There needed to be more sauce, but the it was very flavorful.

This was verrry good. I only had a half pound of shrimp, but kept other proportions as written. It was a Lenten meal so I used veggie broth and used less pepper. Loved it. Next time I might use more lemon juice, but really it's quite delicious. Thank you for the recipe.

I would have given this 5 stars but I didn't have all the ingrediants on hand. I did not have lemon or lemon zest but my whole family loved it anyway, and they said I could make it again !

Wonderful! Use less pepper, it's good even the next day, when the lemony flavor sets in--

This was fantastic!  It was very light and refreshing.  I used dried herbs (1tsp=1TBSP), wheat pasta, and a Chardonnay for the wine.  We drank the rest of the wine with the dinner, which really enhanced the flavors.

Based on other reviews, I also increased the amount of sauce.  I cut the pepper in half, and doubled everything else except the linguini.  It turned out great, and the small amount I had left over was still good reheated the next day for lunch.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was FABULOUS.  I was looking for something different to cook with Shrimp.  This is a gourmet recipe and SO EASY to follow.  I had all the ingredients in the house except I used dry parsley and basil.  I bet it would be really wonderful with fresh herbs.  My mouth is still watering knowing I have some leftovers for tomorrow's dinner.  YUMMMMMY...Thanks so much!

Fabulous served with oven roasted asparagus (so no mayo needed) & a nice reisling!  DH said invite company over!  Semolina linquini (he got by accident) adds a tad more fiber, but still the texture he likes.  Used 1.5 tsp+- pepper, (I'm wimpy) & precooked shrimp (I can tell, he can't). Second time added more fresh herbs - he voted for the lesser! Oh, time two used left over turkey breast...shrimp better, but great healthy way to use up leftovers. Great job...go skini!

I retained all the ingredients, while making this recipe, but I did change the amounts.  I decreased the amount of pepper and garlic and added more broth and peas (for color).  It was quite tasty overall!

I really had high hopes for this one, but it honestly came out bland and too runny, could have just been something I did wrong, either way, We may try it again ...

EXCELLENT!!! Will make this again for sure. The only changes I made, as suggested by others, was to decrease the amount of pepper. I did 1 tsp instead of the suggested 2 tsp and still found it too peppery. Will try 1/2 tsp next time. I didn't have chicken broth so just used 1/2 cup of water and found it wasn't lacking in flavour.
Also will try something to make it less dry.

This is an excellent recipe, zesty and flavorful, as well as an easy dish to make.  I made some minor modifications and it turned out great: I used 12 oz. of fresh linguine and doubled the ingredients for the sauce while sticking one pound of shrimp and only 1 tsp. of black pepper, although I also added some red pepper flakes while sauteing the garlic. To thicken the sauce a little, I stirred in some corn starch before adding the pasta, until the sauce acquired a slightly creamy consistency. My husband loved it and while I was counting on leftovers, there were none. This will definitely be added to our list of favorites.

This was pretty good, but I did alter the recipe quite a bit.  I halved the recipe to serve 2 people, but kept the amount of sauce the same (except for the garlic, pepper and lemon juice.  I reduced the garlic to 4 cloves, the pepper to 1 tsp. and the lemon juice to 3 Tbsp)  I also increased the lemon zest to 1 tsp.  In the end, it was a good, quick dish but next time I would increase the amount of lemon juice to about 1/4 cup and I would also increase the zest to 1.5 tsp.

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't even have all the fresh herbs and it still tasted good.  I later tried it again with only basil and it was just as wonderful!  Don't be afraid to play around with the herbs, you can't do wrong with this recipe!

Absolutely fabulous!! 

I made this recipe exactly as written with one exception. I added a 1/2 cup of sweet baby peas. I used half a box of linguini but next time I'm using a 9 oz package of fresh linguini. I also grated some fresh parm on to each dish. Yummo!  

This dish is a must try!!

This is a keeper.  There was only one thing I didn't care for: I thought it was too lemony.  However, I'm not the type to squeeze lemon on my seafood normally, and I used a rather large California-sized lemon (probably the size of a navel orange).  I had tripled the wine and broth, because I needed to use the broth up, but only used the one lemon plus some lemon pepper in lieu of the zest.  I suspect it would have turned out perfect were I using a more 'normal' sized lemon.  I'll know for next time!  (I also used it on some spinach lingune because that was what we had in the house, and the flavors went great together.)

Excellent! I didn't have the wine, so I added more broth. Very light pasta dish, not heavy like others. I had mine on linguini, my husband has his shrimp on long grain & wild rice. Served with asparagus. Loved it!

Husband and I both enjoyed this dish.  Husband stated--there's a lot of pepper, but not too much.  Matches the lemon well. He also ate it for lunch the next day.

Oh my word. This dish was excellent! Just like something you'd get from a restaurant. 
I did make a few changes to suit the ingredients I had on hand. I doubled the wine/broth sauce, as recommended. I didn't have a grater at the time, so I omitted the lemon zest and added some lemon pepper seasoning salt with the juice instead. I added a lot more pepper as well. I topped it with some shredded Romano cheese. 
We both loved it so much! Definitely a keeper.

I doubled the sauce ingredients as recommended by many people which I am thankful I did.  I added 3/4 pound of sea scallops and 1/2 lump crabmeat.  Excellent, everyone licked their plates clean.  Next time, I am tempted to add some heavy cream for a creamy sauce.

I was a bit disappointed by this recipe. I guess my hopes, based on all the raving reviews, were too high! It's a good pasta dish but nothing to write home about. It also needs some adjustments (more sauce, less pepper, maybe some vegetables...) to become a real keeper.

It was good.  I'm not a big fan of lemon zest, so I added more lemon juice and less zest.

This was very good.  I doubled the sauce like others recommended, but did not think it needed it.  I used extra shrimp and being shrimp lovers, we could have used more!  Great recipe.  Even the kids loved it.  Will make again.  Thanks.

This was an easy dish to fix. I made it for my family and friends and they loved it. I used lemon juice and preground pepper instead of the fresh stuff and it was great. I will always fix this when I need a great meal in a crunch.

I must say, I was very disappointed in this recipe.  I was expecting it to be fantastic based on recent reviews, but it was just okay.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it did taste good, but it was nothing spectacular.

WOW.  This was fantastic!  Very peppery, and I will probably cut down next time on the amount of pepper for my husband and son, but will definitely make again!

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. The flavors worked together nicely and it was easy to make. We didn't have enough butter and used some heavy cream in addition to what butter we had.

My husband and I thought this was good, but the kids only liked the shrimp and would not eat the sauce or the noodles, grrr (too much green "stuff" and lemon). Probably wont make again for a while because of that.

Wow-even my super-picky six year old LOVES this.  Made it tonight for the second time, and everyone loved it.  I used the small frozen shrimp, which did not hurt the dish at all.  A bit less pepper is good for the smaller children.  My son asked if we can have this every Sunday!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Heaven on a plate. Nice & light. Also doubled the sauce, and used cooked shrimp as per previous reviews. Thanks.
Will put into my permanent file.

I liked this recipe because it was easy to make and tasted great. Next time I may add some steamed broccoli or spinach to put in some color.

Wow!  This dish was excellent & so simple.  It took me no time to prepare & tasted gourmet.  I used angel hair since I had no linguini & it was great.  I took the advice of some others & doubled the sauce & also mixed in some minced chilies, (we like things spicey). You could serve this to company, definately a keeper!  Thanks

I enjoyed this recipe but my husband thought it was just okay.  Because of the other reviewers, I backed off on the pepper.  When I make again, I will use all the pepper as I felt the lemon was a little overwhelming and the pepper most likely offsets the taste.  I doubled the  sauce and it was the perfect amount.  Nice recipe, thanks for sharing.

My family loved this recipe. I followed the recipe to a "t" and it was delicious. I wouldn't change a thing.
