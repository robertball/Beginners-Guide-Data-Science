Had appointments today, so I got this going about mid-morning in my Instant Hot Pot using the slow cook feature.  Really easy to make, and it has a rich, robust flavor.  I used some stew beef which I had in the freezer, and it cooked up very tender.  This was a nice change from the old standby, beef stew!

I made it by the directions and ingredients.  I felt it was weak on flavor.  I used Yellow Onions which are mild.  I had approximately 2.5 lbs of top sirloin and adjusted the ingredients up.  I believe one needs a lean meat with more flavor.  I served it over noodles. I will make it again with a twist or two.

I made this exactly as written and loved it! It's very hearty and gets even better, a day or two later. I first served it on rice and served it later, on crusty bread as a kind of French dip sandwich. It's a keeper. Thanks, Joan!

Mine came out really bland, even after adding a lot of salt.  It had too many onions. They dominated the dish.

Woot!  First attempt of boeuf bourguignon - Excellent deep flavor.  I halved the amount of onions that others mentioned.  Next time, I'll add carrots and try pearl onions.

Recipe calls for WAY too many onions, and not near enough broth and wine for the sauce.  Served over spaetzle.

This recipe needed  at least 3 times more wine and beef broth in order to cover and tenderize the beef.  With only a cup and a half the meat dried out and I kept having to add more wine.  The meat turned out tough.  and there were too many onions - I would use half that many if I were to make it again.  Next time I will find a different, better recipe to make this dish.

I substituted dried oregano for the marjoram, and served over angel hair pasta.  It was terrific served hot, and was also excellent when rewarmed a couple of days later.  I definitely plan to make it again!

Delicious! Used 1 1/2 cups Campbell’s “beef broth with red wine” because that’s what I had at home.
Next time will try making it with real red wine and I’m sure it will still taste amazing

This was delicious!  I only had two onions, and that was fine (although next time, I'll probably use more).  I also added garlic.  After step two, I put it in a crock pot for a couple of hours instead of simmering on the stove.  After it was all done, it tasted like it needed something, but I couldn't figure out what, so I added about a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar.  It was perfect!  Thanks for a great recipe!  It will definitely be on the go-to list!

I liked this a lot but it was a little bland. Next time I will add salt and some red pepper.

The top round cooked to perfection in the wine based sauce.  It  turned out to be very tender.  My husband is quite please with this french dish.

I made it almost according to the recipe. It came out okay. I didn’t use as many onions, but I don’t think they would have helped. Didn’t have a lot of flavor as others have mentioned. I used a better quality of beef, but it still came out tough.  Meat needs to be tenderized beforehand.
