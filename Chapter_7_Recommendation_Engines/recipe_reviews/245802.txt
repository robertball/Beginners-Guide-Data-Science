The cookies are very good, my family loved them. The tahini gives them a nice, smooth consistency. They're a little bland for my taste, I will add some almond extract next time I make them.

10.17.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/245802/tahini-honey-oatmeal-cookies/ ... I had to adjust a bit.  The dough was sticky so I added 3/4c more flour & 1/3c more oats; no nuts.  I refrig'd overnight & these still spread quite a bit.  I couldn't imagine 1T cinnamon being right.   I used 1t cinnamon.  While good, if I didn't have tahini already, I'd look at this as a waste of money.

Awesome cookies!!! I used all brown sugar instead of half brown and half white, but that's just a personal preference. I also wasn't sure if I should use sweetened or unsweetened coconut. I used unsweetened coconut and and it turned out great! I like the texture with the slivered almonds, too. A definite winner of a recipe!!
