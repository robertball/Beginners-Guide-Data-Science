This recipe is superb.  My husband begs me to make this dish at least once a week.  If you're a seafood eater, this is a terrific dish for you.  Also, I've tried it with and without the saffron to appease varying taste-buds, and both ways are excellent.
The only down side to this recipe is that quality seafood can be rough on the pocketbook.

What a tasty soup! Must be an east coast recipe and being on the west coast I had to alter a few things as far as seafood. I used fresh cod fillets, clams, prawns, and large scallops. It was great. Make sure you start prepping a little early, it takes a while to chop up and prepare all the ingredients......But it is sooo worth it. :)

A big hit at my dinner party.  I made the soup base the day before and it had a wonderful rich flavour when all the fish was added.  Not to mention it made things much easier to have had all the "fiddely" work done.

This soup had the beginnings of something great...but I made it even better by using an adaptation from an old French neighbor. I used one large can of Roma tomatoes instead of the fresh ones and in place of the broth I used...wait for it...3/4 bottle of a dry but light white wine...chardonnay or sauterne will do nicely! I also added sea scallops a few minutes prior to serving...with just enough time to cook them without making them tough. My boyfriend can't eat mussels so I steamed the mussels in the remaining wine and added them after the fact. I also added a small lobster tail for each guest, to the delight of everyone! Serve this with a  first course of squid ink pasta with lemon butter and salmon caviar, a green salad with homemade vinaigrette and French bread and let the compliments begin!

Pretty disappointing.  I hate to say that because I really wanted this to be great, but it wasn't.  It was very bland and boring.

After chopping up the veggies, the soup was very easy to prepare.  It is satisfying and full of flavor.  I will be making this soup on a regular basis.

Excellent.  I used shrimp, scallops, mussels(in shell), clams(in shell) and grouper cheeks.  My fish store, which is on the shore, sells to restaurants and has packs of grouper cheeks just for this purpose.  

Everyone loved the fish.  I used the recipe proportions for 10 for six of us and had very little left over.

My wife is allergic to onions and garlic so I improvised, adding fresh chopped scallions, Thyme, and Taragon. I used Cod and Shrimp and it was great.

I made this exactly as stated, except that I used mahi mahi, sea bass, mussels, shrimp & scallops for the fish.  The broth was so bland and watery!  I was really disappointed.  I ended up adding a bunch more seasoning, and some Pernod (traditional liqueur for bouillabaisse).  After the additions, it was better but still not great.  If it weren't for the fact that I'd made some toast rubbed with garlic and spread with rouille to eat with the soup, it would have been a total loss.  It may taste better tomorrow, but who wants a fish soup that needs 24 hours for the flavour to develop?  When you are going to spend a lot of money on expensive fish you want to eat it when it is fresh.  Also it made a LOT.  My husband ate a few spoonfuls and then said..."Honey, I know you worked hard on this recipe but it's just not good."  So not worth the effort. Sorry...I really wanted to love it.

Amazingly awesome flavour. My husband never had it before and was a little leary but now it is one of his favourites. Recipe is easy to manipulate depending on your taste.

This was really tasty and versatile -- we didn't have mussels and substituted with some scallops.  The secret that really freshens up the soup and makes it fantastic is the leeks and the orange zest!  Don't forget the zest, it really makes this soup special.  Also, if you only have fish around, I bet it would taste just as good with extra bass instead of the mussels and shrimp (to be tested --!).

Oh my GOD!!! This is SUCH a fantastic dish!!!!! I couldn't get over the flavours it produced!! I added more fennel leaf and thyme as had heaps to use in the garden. Otherwise pretty much stuck to the recipe. Only thing was I found cleaning and debearding those mussels a bit time consuming but this was my first time, so hopefully get faster at it next time! Hubby couldn't believe I'd made such an amazing dish! lol! I will definitely make this dish again.

It was a refined taste. I perhaps would enjoy a can of tomatoes paste with a little cream. However, it was likely the most decadent thing I ever had the courtesy of being able to enjoy. Thank you.

Made it with halibut, snapper, sablefish, mussels, clams, shrimp, and scallops and it was absolutely delicious.  I did add some chardonnay after sauteeing the onions, garlic etc.  The rouille was amazing with it.  Overall, my husband and I were really pleased.
