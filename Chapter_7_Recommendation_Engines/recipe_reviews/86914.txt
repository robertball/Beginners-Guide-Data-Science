Didn't bother making these as towers but instead just put on a big platter and served it that way. Beautiful presentation. Used blue cheese crumbles instead of gorgonzola. I think I did put too much cheese on this one but loved the fact that two cheeses were used. The goat cheese made the gorgonzola creamier tasting. Very simple to prepare. You will look like a gourmet chef after making this one.

I used fresh mozzarella cheese & substituted red wine vinegar in place of balsamic. Marinated 3 hrs. Very strong basil taste.

I am not a fan of strong flavored cheese, so prefer fresh mozzarella instead for the traditional caprese salad flavors. Loved the presentation though, very impressive.

This was so delicious. The only change I made was to use garlic-infused olive oil. It looked beautiful too. This is quick, easy, and elegant enough for company. Thanks so much!

LOVED IT!  I subbed fresh mozzarella for the gorgonzola cheese, since I prefer a lighter cheese. Used lots of basil and balsamic, too.  It was gorgeous and refreshing.  I will make this again.

I love this recipe! But I used slices of fresh moz instead of gorg and goat cheese (although I will definately try those sometime...sounds heavenly!) and also use roma tomatoes as they are not very juicy when making small appetizers.
Yummy!
