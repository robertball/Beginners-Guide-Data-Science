This was delicious!  A surprising variety of flavors.  I didn't have any chipotle chili seasoning, so I used regular chili seasoning and it was still delicious.  I found also that if you eat it while it's very hot, the temperature overshadows the flavors.  Let it sit for about 2-3 minutes so it can cool a tad and the flavors have a chance to present themselves.

I loved this but instead of chipotle chili (I had no idea where to find that), I used a little chili poweder and some cumin and also added a little cinnamon.  I also used half the onion.  It was great!

Delicious.  This dish was sweet and savory at the same time.  I added vegan sausage and eggs to it and made it a complete breakfast.  My hubby loved it.

These were fantastic!

I had three medium sized sweet potatoes that I scrubbed and shredded. I didn't have chipotle powder so I substituted ground cayenne pepper; I also didn't have garlic powder, so I put 1/6 tsp garlic salt.

I was very afraid that these weren't going to be appetizing, I don't care much for sweet potatoes and had some after the holiday to get rid of. I was pleasantly surprised by the way these hash browns tasted. Sweet when you first put them in your mouth and then with a spicy kick! Will make them again if I come across sweet potatoes!

Oh yeah! These are wow. Loved the sweet & hot together. I used 1/4 of a big Vidalia onion ("one onion" is really a LOT in that case), and kept the chile powder @ 1/8t (a pinch), instead of 1/4t, since I was cooking for the kids. Mmmmmmmm. I will definitely make this again.

This was really good, I used it in a vegetable frittata recipe on this site. Instead of chipotle powder, I used a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce that I chopped up.  I used olive oil instead of butter, and I turned the heat down on my stove to avoid the burning that other reviewers complained about.  It didn't get as crispy as regular hash browns, but it tasted really good, so whatever.

These were great!  I love sweet potato, and the chipotle and sweetness worked together wonderfully.  Mine didn't necessarily get crispy before they started to burn,  but the overall flavor of these was awesome.

This was really excellent.  Just what I was looking for to use up some sweet potatoes.  I really dislike candied sweet potatoes and everyone seems to love over sweetening them.  I did not add the brown sugar and these turned out so well!!  Lots of variations possible too!  Thanks so much for posting!

I have a recipe of my own that is similar to this, but I use cinnamon, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. 
I wanted to add spice like you did here, but I just had some cumin. Still, thanks for the tip of adding the spicy stuff to the sweet.
I cut down the amount of brown sugar a little bit, and again used cumin instead of chile powder, but these had an awesome flavor. I still think I'll go back to using cinnamon instead of brown sugar cause the sweet potato is sweet enough on it's own, but other than that I'll be following this recipe from now on. 
I've never had much success in getting my hash browns to crisp up, and the first time around this was no exception. But I had some leftovers and put them in a tupperware in the fridge for a few days, and reheated them over the skillet, and they got really nice and crisp. I'm not sure what did it, as I've stored shredded sweet potato in the fridge overnight before and didn't get such good results. I'll have to figure that one out on my own I suppose. 
Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe as directed, however I did reduce the onion from 1 whole to 3/4 (of an onion).  A typical 'hash brown' crust did develop, but other than that, I did not enjoy the combination of the seasonings, nor the overpowering flavor of onion. I am, almost always, a huge fan of onions in anything.

It was very good, but I'm a moron when it comes to making hashbrowns on the stove top. I finally gave up and put it in the oven at 375 for 10 minutes (after it had already cooked on the stove top for another 10). Next time, I'll just use the oven at a higher heat. It's easier, and it turns out better. I used half of a chili pepper from my garden instead of the chipotle, and I also used a clove of fresh garlic. A lot of the comments say to add cumin, and I'm going to try that next time or maybe a whole chili. I shouldn't have been so scared of heat. :)

Even though I reduced the heat to medium when leaving it to sit, it began to burn after a minute.   I can't imagine what would be left after 5 minutes on medium high heat.  Also way too much sugar!!!  I think this could have potential to be good, but as is - !

Very tasty & filling. It visually looks as though there is too much onion at first - but it cooks down. LOL!

I substituted 1/2 of the sweet potato with 1/2 of a green zucchini and added some minced garlic.  It took twice as long as the  instructions to cook all the way through, perhaps in part to my substitutions?
Worth the wait though.

I made a few changes, because I didn't want to add the sugar...  so I added some cinnamon and a little fresh ginger root. I also used olive oil instead of butter... and it was quite good! I was going to use it as a side for my omelet, but it was a little too sweet for that- so I ate it as a treat :)

The recipe was really good but I did make a few adjustments. 
1)I used half of an onion and not a whole one
2) I didn't have "chili chipotle" powder but I did have chili powder and chipotle powder and I put 1/4 teaspoon of each. 
3) I didn't have a large potato so I used two small ones
4) I used 3/4 tablespoon instead of a full tablespoon
5) And I subbed fresh garlic for garlic powder

Overall pretty good sweet potato hash and I will be making it again

Great recipe, love it when healthy and tasty combine in one easy to prepare dish. Hint, the sweet potato rearly cooks down. I thought I had too much grated, but when cooked it was just enough. Thanks for great recipe.

I used a sweet potat, about a half cup of green onions, and left out the brown sugar.  Delicious.  Like others I had trouble getting them to brown - will have to try again as both hubby and I thought the flavor was excellent, just came out a little mushy.

This was super good!  We made it for a sleep-in Sunday breakfast & were pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was.  Next time we make it, I think I'll either leave the brown sugar totally out, or cut it back.  While I loved the sweet & savory combination, I think the sweet potatoes are sweet enough on their own.  Unexpectedly delicious.

Made these this morning and they were delicious. I also didn't have any chipotle chili powder so I used chili powder and cumin. I did omit the brown sugar as I don't like overly sweet sweet potatoes. And I found the same thing as others in that they didn't hold together like traditional hash browns, and started to burn a bit in the first step of cooking. Just keep an eye on them and "flip" when they look brown. Overall a pretty delicious substitute for white potato hashbrowns!

Delicious - a different twist on hash brown potatoes.  I didn't have chipotle chili powder so I used cayenne powder instead.  These browned up nicely and went well with 'Bacon Cheese Frittata' another AR recipe.  The next time, I think I will omit the brown sugar and just use the garlic powder and chili powder.  I wasn't overly crazy about the brown sugar, but loved the spiciness.

I finally tried it!!  It's a great tasting recipe, healthier than hash browns, and I would definitely make it again...and again.  My husband REALLY loved it!  I made it exactly as the recipe says, but maybe added a slight pinch more of the Chipolte Chili Powder.  For those that don't know what the Chipolte Chili Powder is, I find it in the spice section of the grocery store with the McCormick Gourmet Collection spices.  Good luck and enjoy!!

I love sweet potatoes, and this dish brought out their flavor in such a great way.  I added a little extra cumin and it went perfect with eggs for breakfast.

This was really so-so for me.  The kids wouldn't touch it.  I added two loose tablespoons of brown sugar, and I wish I hadn't added it at all.  It was way too sweet.  I added salt to try and redeem it - I love salty/sweet - it helped, but I still didn't care a ton for it.  Halfway through I realized I'd seasoned with paprika instead of chili powder, so I added the chili powder and it still didn't do it for me.  Sorry, I probably won't make again.

These were great!  My only problem was that they wouldn't hold together well at all.  They didn't hold together like a hashbrown would, but the flavor was great.  Add a bit more chili powder if you like it spicy.

This was pretty good. I used two sweet potatos and a half of an onion (only because that was what I had in the house).  I chopped the potatos instead of shredding them, and while it took a bit longer to cook, they still had a great flavor.  Thanks for sharing - I love to use sweet potatos over white any time I can!
