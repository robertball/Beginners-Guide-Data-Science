Wanted to add a couple notes to my recipe posted here - you don't have to have andouille sausage, chorizo, chourice, even kielbasa or smoked sausage would work as well, also ranch dressing or sour cream or even butter instead of blue cheese can be substituted - hope any of you that try the recipe enjoy it... Mess with it, make it your own thing - I hope you like it.

This recipe is worth about forty-two stars!!!  It's super fast & easy prep, nothing to mess around with once it goes in the oven, beautiful and VERY tasty! This would be easy to make for a big crowd, and it would make an impressive presentation without killing yourself over it.  Everyone loved it, including my sister's not-quite-one-year-old baby.  Zatarain's Creole Seasoning has the perfect spice for this recipe, and it turned out great even with substituting ranch dressing for bleu cheese, a Hillshire Farms smoked beef sausage instead of andouille and plain ol' produce section mushrooms.  A very big hit at my house.  Cannot recommend highly enough!!

This recipe was very delicious! I used Hilshire smoked turkey sauasage and baby portobello mushrooms. I tasted the sauted mixture before adding it to my Magic Bullet for chopping and it was SOOO GOOD!I would eat that over brown rice any day!  My whole family loved it! The next time I fix it I will bake it covered and take the foil off for the last 10-15 min just to make the chicken more tender and seal in more juices! It's a great recipe, thanks Mike!

Good stuff! I do use cremini mushrooms because it's what I tend to have on hand, and I use ranch instead of blue cheese. Those are just personal preferences though, this is a great recipe. Also, I only puree half the stuffing, then stuff the breasts, and the unpureed mixture goes over the top.I usually serve with a wild mushroom risotto, and make it as often as I have time.

Wonderful...a delicious combination of our favorite flavors! My husband, a Cajun from South Lousiana who has been transplanted to Texas, loved it!! I followed the recipe precisely, but would add to the instructions that the most of the fat from browning the sausage should be drained off. I used 8 oz. of smoked sausage and it was delicious. Would also suggest Tony Chachere's Famous Creole Seasoning as the seasoning to sprinkle on the chicken. It's my husband favorite and I have no trouble finding it at major grocery stores. With the entree, I served herb and butter wild rice (prepackaged)...made a nice side dish. We're adding this recipe to our list of family favorites!

Love this stuff! I add some chopped garlic to the mix as well. I sometimes just make the sausage mixture to serve over rice- it SO good! This recipe is in regular rotation in our house; 5 stars just isn't enough.

My husband and I loved this recipe and will make it again.  Don't be tempted to add extra blue cheese dressing though, it's quite zingy already.  Good stuff :)

This is an outstanding chicken recipe. I had some blue cheese crumbles that I had to use up, so put them in there as well. Yummy! Thanks for sharing.

We LOVED it! I used andouille sausage and baby portabellos. Instead of putting everything in the processor, I diced everything real small, and only because I am not a fan of green onion, I diced shallots instead....but to add color when everything was browned, I put in chopped italian parsley. Then I topped the breasts with the dressing and baked!! YUM!

YUM!  I screwed up cutting slits into my chicken breasts, so I piled the sausage stuffing on top of the chicken and it was delicious!

This looks good on paper, but the end result is just meh. I think it would have been better if the stuffing was a little cheesier or something, the sausage stuffing was just a little odd. Oh well, it was worth a try!

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe, the recipe sounded a tad bit spicy so I toned it down a little with the cajun seasoning and it was sooo good. The blue cheese adds and awesome flavor. I also took the advise about the tin foil for 20 min. Good Idea! it was perfect. Thanks

We thought this was great.  I was concerned it wouldn't be very spicy, but it had plenty of heat.  A good dish for company.

This is wonderful!  I strongly dislike blue cheese, so I substituted homemade light ranch dressing.  I also used low-fat smoked turkey kielbasa, and I added a jar of drained pimientos to the stuffing mixture before mixing it all together in the food processor.  There was enough stuffing mixture for four chicken breasts.  Feel free to use more than 1 Tbsp. of Cajun seasoning to rub into the chicken - I used at least 1 Tbsp. per breast!  The prep time says 5 minutes, which is way off - it took me more than a half-hour to prepare everything.  Slicing and stuffing chicken breasts takes time - plus slicing and browning the sausage, mushrooms, and green onions.  But the time was worth it, because the flavor was divine!

This was more time consuming than I thought it would be and we didn't like the sausage and chicken combination. I won't make this again.

This recipe was out of this world!  Everyone loved it.  It was not difficult to make but the prep time was much longer than 5 minutes.  I used butterfly chicken breasts and closed with toothpicks instead of slitting and stuffing.  I also added fresh bleu cheese with the dressing.  Can't wait to make this again!

Great recipe. Very simple and easy to make.  I grilled my chicken, as with most of our meat dishes, over charcoal as always.  Was a hit on Valentine's Day as well as the leftovers I took to work the next day.  Made along with the Corn and Bacon Maque Choux.

This was a really good recipe however we made a few changes to make a more true cajun recipe. Here are the changes: Instead of mushrooms, we used shrimp and omitted the blue cheese dressing. Sautéed the sausage, shrimp, and added 1 tbsp of unsalted butter in a pan and then put it all in a food processor which we then stuffed the chicken with. Then we liberally applied cajun pepper to the chicken once stuffed and then seared the chicken with butter. Lastly we cooked the chicken on 375 for 30 mins....great cajun recipe!

These were AWESOME! I put right in oven without searing...ingredients stuffed in middle. Wonderful flavor from the chorizo sausage! MUST make this again SOON!

One of the best chicken recipes I've made yet! My girlfriend said its one of her all-time favorites from this entire site! The flavor is rich and complex, but the prep is relatively easy. I'm not normally a fan of blue cheese, but it added just the right punch to this recipe. I made everything per the recipe and was surprised at how easily everything went together. It may seem ccomplex when reading the recipe, but I was able to do most of my prep work while other stuff was cooking. Absolutely fantastic! I'll definitely be making this again!

OMG!!!! AWESOME, AWEsome, Awesome!!! This is most defintely a five star recipe. Rich in flavor and tasty. The sausage stuffing is succulent. I did add some bread crumbs to the stuffing to thicken it a bit. This recipe is a must have and will impress the friends. Served it with New Orleans style Dirty Rice. Note: My family dislikes mushrooms but didn't even notice them in this recipe.

I thought this was good but it was very heavy.  My husband L-O-V-E-D it.  In fact, he was disappointed that I didn't love it he did.  I did leave out the mushrooms because I am not a fan of them.  So to compensate, I used a whole pound of cajun sausage.  I also used ranch dressing instead of blue cheese.

These were good.  I left out the mushrooms though..., and forgot that I would have less stuffing as a result... so I didn't have any to put over the chicken breasts... also, the stuffing was left "needing" something--mushrooms, of course, but we aren't mushroom fans!

I think if I make this again I will course chop the mushrooms instead of putting them in the food processor. It had alot of flavor but was a little time consuming.

Great Recipe.  I buy chorizo and fry it up like you would ground beef.  I'm not a fan of blue cheese but it goes so well with spicy flavors and the smell is divine.

Prepared this for my son for a special birthday dinner, and it was a big hit! Everyone loved this chicken. It was a longer prep time than 5 minutes, but worth it. I also used cajun style Andouille sausage and it was delicious. Will be making this again.

My husband and I agreed that if we had gone to a fancy restaurant and spent a lot of money on this dish that we would not have been dissapointed. As suggested, I used the the andouille sausage and cremini muchrooms.  I served it with peppers stuffed with a cajun style rice and cheese. Very Good.

Well, this recipe was ok, but not the greatest.  I'm not sure if I'd make this again.  Plus, I took off a star because of the "5 minutes" prep time.  That is just outrageous, it took me atleast 45 minutes prep....

This was a great recipe!  My husband could not get enough of it.  I used garlic sausage and it made it great.  I also used 4 chicken breasts because thats what came in the package.  I still had plenty of stuffing and now plenty of leftovers!  This will definatly become a favorite arround my house though.

excellent! My husband and our guest raved about this. The only difference i did was make my own blue cheese dressing b/c I had all the ingredients on hand for it. This is a very heavy dish so I pared it simply with roasted broccoli.

I just made this for my family and they LOVED it.  I also made 3 extra breast all the way to the searing and then wrapped them in foil and froze for later.  I did add some sliced pepper jack cheese on top during the last 10 minutes of bake time.  Will make again soon!

This is an excellent dish! My husband and I decided that it goes in the "good enough for company" file.  My only suggestion is to go easy on the cajun seasoning, mine ended up a little too salty for our taste.  Served with some wild rice and the side and we had a wonderful meal!

Excellent!!  We used regular Italian hot sausage in place of the cajun variety which our local stores don't seem to carry, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

I added more garlic (3 cloves) and I used apple chicken sausage.  The sausage is what made this dish.  The flavor from the meat along with the blue cheese was a awesome combo.  Amazing dish

OMG!  This was fabulous!  I used Conecuh brand smoked sausage from Alabama.  The best!  I made up some of the Creole Seasoning Blend from this site to use as the seasoning.  Otherwise I kept the recipe as is.  Cutting the chicken breasts to stuff was a snap!  I used Marie's Chunky Bleu Cheese dressing.  I covered the dish with foil lightly for the whole cooking time.  The dressing started to look curd-ly so I thought it better to keep it on there so it wouldn't look dry and cracked.  You could always slightly warm some dressing and put it on at the end.  Fantastic!!

Very tasty! I didn't even attempt to stuff the chicken, just spread the sausage & mushroom mixture over the top. Hubby suggested next time we pound the chicken, spread on the mixture and roll up the chicken.

These chicken breasts were such a hit in my house I had to double the recipe and make them again the next week.  I substituted Italian sausage (removed from its casing)and it tasted just fine.  When I made it the 2nd time I tripled the stuffing so that I would have a lot to put on top and surround the breasts.  My teens even ate these cold the next day.

Thanks

This was one of the BEST chicken dishes we have tried from this site.  Adding blue cheese crumbled to the top adds a company touch!  For those who said it was too salty - try changing your brand of sausage!

i have prepared this twice but did not use it as a stuffing.  i don't like to try to stuff chicken brests so i cut them up into pieces and cooked them with the sausage, onions, garlic and used canned mushrooms and served with chicken flavored rice.  carried to a church social and the pot was cleaned out.  easier to prepare using this method.  be careful with the spice so it doesn't take over the dish.

My husband doesn't typically 'gush' about any meal I prepare, but he couldn't stop talking about this one.  The grocery store didn't have the mushrooms listed, so I just used regular ones and I couldn't get andouiile saugsage, so I used smoked sausage and it was still DELISH!

Best chicken I've ever had!  I used this for a dinner party, and the guests were fighting over the last piece.

I didn't care for the taste of the sausage with the chicken.  I would not make this again.

Wow this was really good!  I used smoked turkey sausage to lower the fat content and it turned out great!  The only difficult part of this recipe was the clean up.

I didn't really care for this but my daughter and roommate really liked it (perhaps recovering from my cold is hampering my tastebuds?). I used polska kielbasa = as per another reviewer AND it was all I had on hand besides breakfast sausage. I think it could use a little more spice (a "hotter" cajun seasoning) and if there is a next time, I'll use the chiorzo sausage as indicated by the recipe.

A great meal for young adventurous cooks like us! We had the chicken with a side of white jasmine rice and homemade cornbread. The rice goes perfectly with the extra stuffing. We used chirizo sausage and the extra spiciness was great.
Thank you Mike Love!

I've made this several times.  I leave out the bleu cheese because my husband doesn't like it and I'm afraid the tanginess of it will come through.  But, it's a great meal - especially over rice.  But, if you or your friends/family are low carb dieters, you can serve the rice on the side and everyone's happy.  I also don't bother to stuff the breasts.  I just slice them on a bias and layer the sausage on top.  And, I've used leftover rolled breakfast sausage which is great on this too.

Just made this for dinner and we liked it a lot.  I used a chicken sausage with spinach and feta in it and while it's spicy on it's own, I may use a spicier tastier sausage next time. Also, instead of cutting slits in the breasts I pounded them and rolled the stuffing in but it's more work and I'm not even sure why I went that route...  :)  Anyway, it was easy enough to make and we will be trying these again!

This is a great addition to my chicken recipes. It's so easy to make. Hubby loved it. I didn't add as much cajun spice as the recipe called for because my daughterdoesn't like spicy food but next time I will definately add more spice.

This will go in rotation for my family.  I used Conecuh - what a kick! It was too spicey for my daughter but my husband and I loved it.  I used Ranch since we are not Bleu Cheese eaters.

Simple, quick and delicious. Another way to jazz up some chicken. This one definitely makes the rotation. My wife typically likes food that tastes like cardboard and even she'll eat this one!

I made this recipe for the first time today for 22 people. It was amazing!! It is a keeper. The chicken was tender and full of flavor. I think I would actually like to try adding blue cheese crumbles to the stuffing next time. Again very good! Thanks!

This is a Keeper! Great flavor, easy to prepare, we don't have a food processor but do have a chopper and it worked fine. We used sour cream like suggested in place of bleu cheese dressing and it was great. Not too spicy, did season with cajun spice, but not liberally, just seasoned. It was perfect.

This was simple and soooo good! I don't like mushrooms, but that didn't stop me from enjoying this recipe. I used kielbasa sausage and bulk mushrooms. Stuffing the chicken breasts was a bit of trouble, but I think it's worth it. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks!

As a professional chef this is such a quick easy 5 star meal. It was 102 degrees here when I made it so I sauted the breast on the stove and finished them in the toaster oven so I wouldn't heat up the house. Absolutely perfect. Might incorporate this in my menus for work!!! For those who think it was a bit too salty, use a little less sausage and don't put as much salt in the mushrooms when you are sauteeing them. Personally, I wouldn't change a thing, it was great.

Clean plates in my house, this was really good! I did go w/the ranch dressisng also, used thin sliced chicken breast and sandwiched the stuffing between 2 pieces. The chicken was very tender & flavorful. I'll make this again for sure!

My husband and I did not like the combination of chicken and sausage.  It was also very salty, and I could not taste the cajun spices at all, and I even used quite a bit more than was called for.  I used chicken apple sausage and crimini mushrooms, and increased the garlic x5.  I also pounded the chicken breasts rather than making a slit and stuffing it that way.  Otherwise, I made the recipe as it was written.  I think to improve it, next time I would leave out the sausage and just stuff the chicken with mushroom/onion mixture.  I would also omit the bleu cheese dressing, and use bleu cheese crumbles instead to decrease the saltiness.

Using Tony Chachere's regular Creole seasoning made this way too salty; the rest was good, I'll use an allrecipes.com Creole mix the next time I make it!

This recipe is great! A nice change from the ordinary. My husband loved it. The blue cheese dressing was great with it. I'm not a big fan of blue cheese, but it goes well with this dish. Will definitely make again.

Easy and very, very good.   If you happen to own a Foreman Roaster and are looking for ways to put it to use, this recipe is excellent in it!   Moist, quick.

I will not make this again. The  chicken itself turned out wonderful—tender and juicy—but the sausage stuffing was too overpowering and salty. I was unable to stuff the breasts, so I just put the stuffing on top. This recipe would be better and easier if you don't make the stuffing. Just coat the breasts with the cajun seasoning, sear, and bake. The mushrooms and onions (in chuncks) would be a good topper. Whatevery you do, leave out the sausage.

Loved this recipe!  I used ground "zippy" sausage (between hot and mild).  I added some cajun spices & ranch in the stuffing.  It is also great for low carb dieters.

This was wonderful and pretty simple to make!  If you are not a Blue cheese fan (as I am not) don't be afraid, it works with the recipe!  I didn't (for once) change a thing!  Thanks!

This was absolutely wonderful.  I don't think I've ever enjoyed chicken breasts this much.  I made 8 breasts and have a ton of leftovers.  Very, very filling.  I told my friends about it and they all want to try it.  Thanks big time for this one, it is now a family favorite.

Very good recipe as is.  I didn't have green onions, so I used white onions.  My husband doesn't do dressings, so I used some fresh mozzarella I had on hand instead of the dressing.  But it was very flavorful and juicy.  I also covered in foil for the first half of cook time.  Definitely a dish we will be adding to our rotation of dinners.

I had all the ingredients in my fridge/ cupboard so I decided to give this a try. I’m glad I did! My husband and I really enjoyed it. I think next time I would add some crumbled blue cheese on top just to give it that extra bite.

AWESOME!!!  Cook at 450 degrees for 20 minutes instead of 375 degrees for 30 minutes and you will have juicy chicken breasts. Don't be worried about the blue cheese salad dressing, my wife hates blue cheese and she didn't even detect it. Don't skimp on the spices, make sure the outside and inside is totally covered.

Maybe it was my cajun seasoning i bought but i thought this dish was lacking salt. I also didn'T care for the bleu cheese dressing. My chicken was dry after 30 min in the oven even when covered with foil.

This was good, but it seemed to me to be missing something. I'm not sure what. Maybe it was the crappy Cajun Seasoning I used. In any event, it was good. I will make again. Thanks for the recipe!!!

The dish came out really heavy and overly rich.  A little goes a long way. I do appreciate the recipe and your sharing of it.

This recipe was great! I did use a little bit of cheese in the stuffing and used poultry seasoning instead of cajon seasoning, but I was not disappointed. I paired with Wild Mushroom Rice Pilaf and peas. Definitely going in the recipe bank.

Looks can be deceiving!!! My wife and kids were hesitant to try at first but after the first bite they were pleasantly surprised how flavorful it tasted. I served with white rice and broccoli.

Yum good! I made a few changes based upon what was on hand. I had a leftover spinach and fontia chicken sausage that I used in place of the smoked, I also was out of blue cheese dressing so i used Caesar. Instead of cutting a slit in the breast, which I can never seem to do correctly,. I pounded the breast, stuffed it and rolled it up.

I did try this twice but just didn't like it at all.  It sounded good "on paper" but the reality was not that good.  I won't be trying a third time.

Very interesting and such a nice change from the usual marinated boneless/skinless chicken breasts. My husband and I both enjoyed and will make again. Thank you!

Overall a very good recipe. I'd like to try it with pure blue cheese crumbles instead of the dressing sometime.
