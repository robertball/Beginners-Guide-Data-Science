I'm a firm believer that the world needs more rhubarb cocktails. With a modest adjustment (more syrup and less/no triple sec), this one's quite good. The triple sec can overwhelm the drink, but the rhubarb flavor really shined through when we traded the triple sec for another tablespoon of rhubarb syrup and garnished with an orange peel twist. If you like it a little less sweet, try adding a dash or two of Angostura orange bitters. The syrup is great over ice cream and pancakes as well.

These were ok. They were too sweet for my taste. Next time I will use less sugar.

Instead of vodka - we used tequila and added the juice of one lime.  We used our garden rhubarb (which happens to be more green than red) and didn't think the drink was too sweet (and we don't like sweet drinks).   I agree with the reviewer who said to use more syrup than called - then you get more of the rhubarb taste. Yum.  (I waited all winter to try this recipe!)

Thought it was too sweet.  Would cut down on sugar.
