Authentic, classic recipe. The first time I had this it was alongside burrata and it is an excellent combination. Toss leftovers with pasta or add them to risotto. Thank you for the recipe.

I made a crockpot rattatouile from The Ktchn yesterday. After it sat overnight, I added some Kalamata olives with some brine and some capers with brine. Ran all of it, with about a tablespoon of yellow raisins, through the food processor again. Fantastic! Serving it on garlic toast.

I had never heard of caponata until I plugged eggplant and zucchini into the Allrecipes search and this came up.  My goodness, it's DELICIOUS.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't boil the celery ahead of time (wasn't sure what the point was since I was going to saute it again anyway???).  Also, I couldn't find fresh basil that looked good so I used 1/2 tsp. dried, and while I was at it added 1/2 tsp. dried oregano and a few springs of fresh rosemary that I had to use up.  The result was a savory, sweet, delicious vegetable dish that I ate as a main course.  I will definitely make this again, hopefully with fresh basil so I can try it exactly as written.
