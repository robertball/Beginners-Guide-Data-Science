One of my family's favorite holiday recipes!  I found that if you spread the cream cheese to where it's completely covering the pretzel layer, no jello will leak to the pretzels (which makes them soggy).

This is DELICIOUS!!! I used 3 tbsp of sugar with the pretzel mixture instead of one, and halved the cool whip due to personal preference. It tasted wonderful! I will make this many more times!

This is a great recipe.  I made it for a gathering of 6 people, and all loved it!  The only thing I'll do differently next time is to crush the pretzels better for the bottom layer and possibly use more pretzels, since they just barely covered the entire pan.

this was pretty good, a friend of mine brought this to work, and everyone loved it, so i decided to make it for a family function.  i wouldnt say its the best, but it was worth making i might make it again, because it wasnt too hard and it tasted pretty good.  i would suggest really really crushing the pretzels...i thought i did pretty well but while eating it i decided it would of been better if i crushed them to dust!  i think it would also be good with fresh strawberrys..would add more of a home cooked dessert taste to it..

Crunch the pretzels into smaller bits so that that crust stays together better.  Also, make sure the cream cheese mixture is completely covering the pretzels, otherwise you end up with jello in your pretzels.

If you're not too keen on mushy strawberries, raspberry jello with frozen raspberries is an AMAZING substitute! Also, using the same fruit you would normally use atop a cheesecake is really very good.

Two cups of pretzels didn't cover bottom of 13x9 pan so I added another cup.  While this is easy to make, you need time for each layer to thoughly cool.  I used fat free Cool Whip, and reduced margarine to half a cup. Everyone raved about this low fat dessert

The strawberry-gelatin layer was a little too sweet.  Otherwise, this was a great blend of flavors.

Tasty dessert recipe!  I would partially thaw the strawberries next time I make it!  It was too hard to break up the strawberries in the gelatin mixture.

My family loves this! Some people seem to be making it wrong and rating it poorly for it. The pretzels shouldnt be crumbled to dust, its not a pie crust, just broken into small pieces. Also, ensure that you are completely sealing the pretzel layer with the cream cheese layer to ensure that the jello layer doesn't seep through and make the pretzels soggy. When made right this dessert is amazing! (I messed it up my first couple times too, but I was doing it from memory of a friends recipe)

Very dissapointing, I cushed the pretzels up to very very fine pieces, looked like dust and crumbs and it still didnt stay together. I made 2 9in pies bc I was going to take one to a 4th of July family outting.....we tried it Sat, and I didnt feel it was something I would feel good about taking and saying I made it. The kids loved it but I was unimpressed-(the cream cheese layer was yummy though)

I loved this recipe. It is a great way to use up our fresh Florida strawberries. I used about 2/3 of everything to make this smaller to fit in a glass pie dish. I don't know if I would fix it for company but overall it is a great weekday treat. Like other posters I wish I had made the pretzels very fine because they did not bind together. It all tastes good, just a bit messy.

This is the perfect combination of sweet and salty! Alot of the other reviewers suggested crushing the pretzels more finely, but I disagree. I think the crust was great. The only suggestions I have is to use fresh strwberries, sliced and frozen and double the cream cheese layer for a 9x13 pan.

Ladies~ this is the perfect dessert for that special time of the month. It combines sweet and salty beautifully. I highly suggest adding an extra brick of cream cheese & blending the  extra sugar to taste. As for the crust, you do want it pretty finley ground and may need to put a bit of extra butter to have it hold together better.

I could live off this. I also cut down on the butter and sugar and it still turns out great. Vastly different textures and flavors (salty/sweet/sour)makes it really unique but so simple. Fun and easy recipe to make with my six year old who likes to crush the pretzels in a freezer bag by stomping on them.

I have made this recipe many times for family reunions and other get togethers and have been asked everytime for the recipe by more than one person.  I don't use sweetened frozen strawberries though, I just use the plain ole frozen ones and slice them as I go and it tastes just wonderful.  I also use a couple more handfuls of pretzels.

Made this for last night, husband and I went over our friends' house.  My friend and I really liked it, I don't know that our husbands were as crazy about it.  It is kind of a glorified Cool Whip/Jello dessert - but who cares - as other reviewers have said, the salty/sweet combo is brilliant!  I wanted to make mine in a 9" round dish, so it looked more like a pie.  Plus a 9x13 would have been too much for the 4 of us.  So I used about 1 1/3 cups crushed pretzels & decreased the butter to 1/2 cup for the crust.  I kept the cream cheese/cool whip/sugar layer the same, and then just used one box of gelatin/one cup boiling water/one bag of the frozen SLICED strawberries.  Worked perfectly, was not overflowing at all, the pie had all the layers, sliced up very nicely after being chilled.  This is a great summertime dessert, light and refreshing.  Only next time I will probably crush the pretzels even finer, helps the crust to hold together better.

I made this to take to a party, and no one disliked it, but my husband and I were unimpressed.  There's not much mixing of flavors, and even though it does have the sweet-salty combo going on.  Most highly-rated recipes on this site are way better than this.  If you're looking for something to make with strawberries, keep browsing.

I would use more pretzels and crush them finer, it seemed like a lot of butter in the crust, and it broke apart somewhat when I spread the cream cheese mixture on top.  Also, there's no need to chill the jello mixture, the frozen strawberries cooled it down quickly, and you want to put it on top while it is still pourable, of the top looks like strawberry jam instead of jello.  I still tasted wonderful though, everyone at work loved it.  I used a bag of mixed berries instead of strawberries and used raspberry jello since that's what I had in the house.  GREAT!

This dessert is awesome! I use brown sugar with the pretzel mixture but I'm sure white sugar is fine.  I always make this for summer picnics & it  is a crowd pleaser!  The combo of sweet & salty is delicious!

Love this recipe!! We make it for all big family occasions... Thanksgiving, Christmas, Birthdays, etc.!!! Everyone loves it! We have even made it with raspberries and raspberry jello instead of the strawberries. Both ways are so good! My family picks buckets of strawberries during the summer and we freeze bags of strawberries already measured out for this recipe so that we can even make it in the winter! ALl we have to do is pull out and thaw the frozen bag of strawberries, very convienent. YUMMY!!!

This is a GREAT recipe.  I like to make this in the largest round glass pie pan I have.  It doesn't use all of the cream inside, but I use it to dallop over the top.  Any extra Jell-O I put in a small bowl to set (the kids take care of that for me :c).  I usually arrange fresh berries over the cream mixture after spreading.  It makes a fantastic dessert, or thing-to-bring for a picnic!

This was a very yummy dessert.  Everyone liked it a lot.  One note though, the jello and strawberries should be mixed last, because it sets up very fast.  I will definitely make this again!

This is DELICIOUS!! We can't get enough of it!!  I am going to try it with peaches when they are in season!  You can add fresh raspberries or blueberries to the strawberry mixture for some added flavor.  YUMMMMMMMY!!!  Can I say it again? YUMMMMMMMY!!!

This was so different, yet so enjoyable.  I used fat free whipped topping and low fat cream cream.  I also only used 1/2 cup butter.  It was really good.  Everyone thought it was so unique. I would recommend using sliced stawberries not whole.

2nd time I made itI left the sugar out of the pretzel crust and that was a mistake. I guess the sugar melts and keeps the crust together.  I cut the sugar in the cream cheese in half and it was perfect. mad the top as suggested and everyone loved it but as I said the crust would not hold together. I will make this again but will add 1 tbsp of sugar to the pretzel mixture.
My advise to rocksteady is you need to leave the pretzels in small pieces not in a fine powder.  the couch of the pretzels is what makes this dessert so wonderful.

My family loves this dessert so I was on the hunt for a good recipe. All in all this recipe was wonderful. My only complaint would be the frozen strawberry part. I found it was really difficult to get them to melt completely. If i were to use this recipe again, I would definitely use fresh strawberries.

I have made this recipe for years and is a family favorite. I mix the pretzels and sugar and spread the mixture over the bottom of the baking dish. Then, I drizzle the melted butter over the entire layer before baking it.

We loved this and my 12 year old daughter was ready for me to make it again while eating the last piece. I made it as written except for scaling it back just a bit to fit a 7x11" glass pyrex dish. Let the pretzel base cool and even put it in refrigerator to make sure it set nicely. Had plenty of filling (I didn't cut that back, just didn't use it all in this dish) so I could plop hunks in each corner and spread easily over the entire crust, making sure to seal all edges. I used 1 1/2 cups fresh strawberries since they were in season and sliced them, adding just 1 T sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla, letting them macerate in fridge while I made the base.   Once berries had released some juices, I added them to the jello and let it set until it got thick but not set. Spread easily on the filling and set up nicely. Cut into squares easily and crust stayed on as part of the dessert square. One reviewer was not sure it was company faire, but I'd disagree. This would be a wonderful dish to take to a picnic or serve at home. Just make sure to cut big enough pieces so people don't feel badly because they want seconds.

After reading the many reviews, I want to add my two cents. I have been making this for over 20 years. The water has to be BOILING hot, if not, the jello will not set properly. Thus, the strawberries  DO have to be frozen and WILL melt. If you do not know how the process of jello works, this is not the recipe you should start with. If you have non-frozen strawberries, you need to add ice. The idea is to have 4 cups of fluids to the large package of jello. The frozen strawberries add water. In summary: Boiling water to jello, dissolve, then add ice or frozen items/ice to set.

I make it with real whip cream (because I don't like fake stuff) and it was still delicious .  It holds up just as well.

This recipe makes a BIG dessert. I turned it into actual pies by dividing it into 2 pie pans. That way I had one to give away and one to keep. The pretzel and cream cheese layers are the best parts. That salty crunch next to the sweet cream. Mmmmmm. I'm not too crazy about the jello layer - it seemed too sweet. Next time I think I'll just do fresh strawberries on top.

Thank you Jen!  I've been looking for this recipe, had it a few years ago at a church dinner and lost the recipe I got at the time.  I love that it's made with things most of us keep on hand, easy enough for young, aspiring cooks to make and it's really pretty enough for company.

Let me start by saying that I am NOT a cook!  It's not very often I make things because they often seem too difficult.  This looked challenging and I thought I would try it.  Turns out, its not hard at all!  Everyone really enjoyed this, even my hard-to-please friends!  The only problem I had was a few spots of the crust got soggy, and I believe that is because my cream cheese mix didnt cover the crust as well as I should have.  I made everyone guess the crust and they were surprised when I told them what it was.  VERY GOOD!

Turned out okay, I was hoping it was be a little more elegant since it was for a birthday. Tasted like what it was- a cool whip dessert. I loved the crust though, I use that crust on my other strawberry pie recipe and get rave reviews.

This recipe is really good.  I also have done it with raspberry Jell-O and frozen raspberries.

It sounds weird, but this is a GREAT dessert.  It is SO good, it doesn't last more than a day or two! Its very rich, so one or two slices (if you're a glutton) will fill you up.

This is a very good strawberry dessert, even people who say they don't like strawberries will come back for more.
