Fantastic!!!  I made a few changes, took some hints from other reviews.  Such as, used 1 large can of crushed tomatoes and 1 14.5 oz. can of stewed tomatoes, no water.  I also used 1 bottle of clam juice and 1 cup of chicken broth and I added calamari and some extra garlic.  I simmered the broth for over an hour, until we were just about ready to eat, and then added the fish (took order from another recipe) first the clams for about 5 min, till they start to open, then the crab legs (about 1 minute) then the mussels, shrimp, squid, scallops and cod.  Cook stirring frequently until the mussels open, the shrimp curl and the squid and scallops are just firm (about 3 minutes).  Everything was cooked just right and the flavor.......wonderful!!!  The recipe served 6 adults and we had a little left over. I took some of the broth and cooked some extra shrimp in it and then added the rest of the broth and fish and warmed it up.....it was wonderful even as a leftover.

Those of you who have read my other ratings know that 4 stars means my family loved it.  5 stars is absolutely above and beyond.  This is hands-down the best recipe we've ever tried on All Recipes!!!!

A few helpful hints if you are going to try this wonderful recipe:  

Be sure you have a really big pot!  You will want to avoid stirring this too much in order to avoid breaking up the meat, so a big pot is critical!

Use very dry white wine.  A sweet white wine will interfer with the flavor of the seafood, whereas a dry white will compliment the flavor wonderfully!
Don't use flake-style crab meat as it will just disappear in the broth.  Either use king crab legs in the shell or precook your crab legs and extract the meat for the soup. (if you use crab legs in the shell, add 1/2 lb to the amount)

Place the cod in large pieces on top at the very end and cook it quickly.  This will ensure that the cod won't break apart and your guests can extract whole pieces to their plates.

Cook quickly and serve!  If you cook too long the seafood will dry, flake, and lose flavor.

The three secrets to success for this recipe:  Fresh, Fresh, Fresh seafood!

Make this for someone you love.  I made it for my Dad and he still raves.

I hesitated between 4 - 5 stars because this is a really inspired recipe, but I did have a couple of suggestions.  I agree with other reviewers that additional fish stock would give it more depth of flavor and I too blanched at all the butter.  So used used olive oil, and just a couple tablespoons of butter.  Also, if you are using fresh mussels and clams (as I did), they need to go in about 10 minutes ahead of the other fish, because the shrimp, scallops, fish, and crab will cook in about 5 minutes.  I'd wait until the clams and mussels start to open before adding the rest.  I also added a about a 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes for a little more zest.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was a very tasty recipe.  I used a few of the changes reccomended by other reviewers such as using all wine and no water and I added lobster broth to enhance the seafood flavour.  The one thing I will change the next time I make this recipe is to use olive oil instead of butter and reduce the amount of fat to 1/4 cup.  The large amount of butter made this recipe very, very rich (the seafood is rich by itself it does not need excess butter) and I noticed a layer of fat on the top of the stew (I did not find this appetizing).

Wow, this was amazing!  It definitely tasted like a restaurant-quality dish.  I had a dinner party for 4 people--started with a simple lettuce salad with pine nuts and a lemon-basil dressing.  Then we had crab cakes.  The cioppino was the main course.  (Followed by a creme brulee.)  I did make a few changes, but as other people have mentioned, the beauty of this recipe is its flexibility!  I like my cioppino very tomato-based, so even though I halved the recipe, I put in a 28-oz can of tomatoes, as well as a 14-oz can of tomato sauce.  Also, I used a merlot (red wine) instead of white, because I tend to associate tomato-based dished with a red wine accent.  I used a combination of fresh and frozen seafood.  I got fresh mussels and a few scallops from Whole Foods, but then I supplemented with a bag of frozen shellfish and some frozen raw shrimp from Trader Joe's.  I used fresh basil and a mediterranean seafood seasoning from Whole Foods.  Served it with fresh grated parm. cheese on top, fresh ground pepper and a big loaf of fresh, crusty bread.  My guests kept talking about it the entire evening!  I served a nice Chianti with it, which worked well.  My husband and I are both poor graduate students, so we can't afford to make this very often, but we both agreed it was completely worth the price!

Overall this is a good Cioppino.  Being Italian, I had to delete the butter for a nice Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  Other changes...I used crushed tomatoes with added puree and a can of diced tomatoes, no water was necessary, added 1/2 teaspoon dried crushed red pepper to give it a little zip, used red wine instead of white and included squid and sea bass.  Yummy hit for a friend's birthday dinner party.

Absolutely incredible! I made the broth a few weeks ago and froze it. I had a dinner party for 8 with heavy hors d'oeuvres and then the Cioppino and bread for the meal.I thawed the broth, had it hot and simmering and added the seafood and it was ready in a snap. I used bay scallops and shrimp only and it was superb! Every bit was eaten! Definitly let the broth simmer a long time
for the depth of flavor. It will be a staple at our house!

What a fabulous stew!  I replaced the butter with olive oil, added more garlic, but didn't chop fine. I added a handful of parsley and a handful of cilantro.  I added 3 anchovy filets and broke them down in the hot olive oil until they dissolved.  I added the wine and deleted the water.  I put one large can of stewed tomatoes and 2 cans of crushed tomatoes.  Then added the clams, mussels, bay scallops, jumbo scallops, shrimp and white fish.  This is excellant!

I used the modifications submitted by ROTED, which I highly recommend.  A nice thing about this dish is that it's cost can vary dramatically, depending on the types of fish and shellfish you include.  If you're making it for company, I recommend that you add one lobster claw per serving, and add it last so that it is on top of the clams and mussels.  This is expensive but well worth it, in terms of both taste and presentation.

Amazing!  I could just leave it at that...but I won't.  The depth in the broth was wonderful before the seafood, but after adding the seafood it was beyond my scope of words.  I only used fresh shrimp and scallops - living in the midwest 2lbs each of those cost me $45.  I did put in some brown rice and an extra bit of stock to compensate.  Instead of water I used two cups of wine and let it simmer for 2 hours before adding seafood.  Also, fresh herbs not dried  and a full stick of butter added a wonderful richness.  My picky boyfriend said "This is great!" and when we discussed maybe spicing it up (pepper sauce?) he decided "No, I like it like this, it's flavorful and comforting".  Definatly comforting... will make again and again and pass this recipe on.  Thanks!!

This recipe is a very good start to a cioppino! I reduced the butter as many others have mentioned and used clam juice, chicken stock, and white wine as my base, no water.  In addition, I used spicy marinara sauce in place of the stewed tomatoes, therefore I didn't need to add oregano, basil or thyme but I did add fresh parsley and bay leaves.  I also added chopped fennel which gave the stew more complex flavor. I substitued halibut for the cod, I think any firm white fish would do.  We had this for Christmas eve dinner with bread and salad and it was wonderful.

Excellent with a few minor changes: 1. use half butter and half olive oil to saute garlic and onion 2. omit water and increase both broth and wine by 1/2 cup each 3. I use 2 cans of crabmea, tilapia (instead of cod), and squid 4.  Sautee all igredients (except seafood) and simmer about 30 minutes 5. Add one can of crabmeat and simmer another hour to 2 hours (it really allows the flavors to mature) 6.  Add second can of crab, then  mussels and clams; cook about 5 mins 7.  Add shrimp and cook a few seconds, followed by scallops, squid, and finally right before removing from heat add tilapia (or whatever fish you choose)

Thank you for an excellent recipe.  I agree with some changes - no butter no water. Use 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, only 1 can chicken stock, 3 bottles Clam Juice, and a generous pinch of saffron.

Unbelievable. Take great care into what order you put the seafoods in, if you bury the shelled seafood, it won't open right.

this was great!  a few changes we made:  1) instead of chicken stock, make your own seafood stock from the shells of the shrimp, lobster legs, etc.  2) soak live clams in water and cornmeal.  The clams will eat the cornmeal and spit out any sand. This serves the dual purpose of cleaning your clams and the cornmeal thickens the sauce when you cook them.  3) Keep a can of tomato paste on hand in case your sauce needs thickening. 4) leftovers are great over fettucine the next day. 5)  use fresh basil, thyme and oregano if you can, and add red pepper flakes to taste; 6) for a variation on the herbs, replace the oregano, basil and thyme with crushed fennel seeds and saffron.

I made something similar last weekend and the results from that prompted me as to a few minor changes for this one. I'd use DICED tomato,(it's less liquidy & has alittle more body to it), & add seasonings & 2 cans of chic broth and the wine (no water).  Bring to a low boil, then cover and lower heat & simmer for 30 min. While that's simmering, I'd cook the clams in 1 14oz can chick broth & then set aside for later. "Later", after simmering the pot for 30 minutes, I'd add the shrimp and scallops and then the clams including the liquid from that,,,,,cover and continue simmering until shrimps are  pink. Then, Stir the pot, recover, and continue simmering a couple  more minutes. Then serve with some nice crusty garlic  bread.

To die for!  I made a couple changes just because I couldn't get my hands on all the ingredients in time for dinner.  I omitted the water, and replaced it with a jar of clam juice.  Replaced the crab meat with crab legs so it wouldn't just fall apart with cooking.  And used crushed tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes.  What really made this for me and the bf was a dash of Tabsco right before eating it.  Amazing! This is a tasty and impressive dish that's sure to please any seafood lover!

This was truly excellent.  I followed the recipe with the following exceptions: 32 oz UNSALTED chicken broth, 2 cups white wine, no water.  Also added 1 cup uncooked radiatore pasta 7 minutes before the seafood.

This dish REALLY is excellent.  Very authentic, and simply delicious.  I'm probably what you'd call a food snob, as at least half of the things I've tried on this site deserve 3 or fewer stars - that said, this is truly a 5-star dish.  The only thing I changed when making this was to use fresh herbs instead of dried.  Another suggestion that I think enhances this meal - instead of warm crusty bread, take some sliced sourdough, Italian or french bread, brush lightly with olive oil and grill.  The grilled bread is outstanding with this dish.

I have made this several times . . . and I usually don't follow it perfectly (sometimes I use different varieties of fish, shellfish, etc), but I do follow pretty much the "base" of the soup with one exception.  I add clam juice for some of the liquid.  As it stands, it is an excellent entree soup and my family really loves it.

This was incredible!!! 5 stars!! I did make a couple of changes just based on my preference. after reading reviews I decided to make the broth part a day in advance to let the flavors come out and added a can of clam juice instead of the water and substituted a can of diced tomatoes for one of the stewed tomatoes. Next day I heated up the broth and added two cans of tomato paste (just because I like a bit thicker) and some red pepper and hot sauce for heat.  Then added defrosted shrimp, bay scallops, precooked mussels (didnt feel like shucking fresh) two cans of who clams and a 6 oz can of crab meat. and cooked until all was done. Then poured into bowls and topped each with a snowcrab cluster. And of course lots of bread!! Got great reviews thanks for the wonderful recipe! will def do again!!

Absolutely superb! I made it many times and gave the recipe to many of my family and friends.
I make the stew in advance, freeze it and just add the seafood when ready to serve it to my guests.
I add more garlic, more thyme and basilic,more salt and pepper and some cayenne. I use 2-1/2 bottles of clam juice instead of chicken broth and water. I do not use clams. instead, I add: 2 lbs of large shrimp, 2 lbs of mussels, 1 lb of scallops and 2 lbs of firm white fish(cod,halibut,red snapper). I serve the stew with crusty toasted garlic bread.

This is amazing!  It is not a cheap to make, bt it is worth every $.  I made it for a dinner party and the guest were fighting for the left overs. :)  The broth was rich and hearty without overwealming the seafood. I followed others' advise in the order to place the seafood in the broth, and it was perfectly done, and not overdone.  This is a keeper.

This recipe is one of my favorites.  It's so easy!  To make it even easier, use canned clams.  I added a little clam juice to the mix as well.  Great Job!

Was average at best...made a different recipe for last Christmas Eve and wish I had made it again...this one was nothing special. My guests said it was good but I think they were being kind.

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner and everyone loved it! I used one onion and reduced the butter based on other reviews, also used a bottle of clam juice rather than water. I also added the juice of two lemons and used diced tomatoes rather than stewed. I felt the original recipe lacked seasoning so I added plenty of sea salt and pepper. Calamari was substituted for the crab and if you do use calamari make sure it's added at the last possible second as it cooks so quickly. The clams and mussles took longer than the shrimp and fish so that went in first..fish maybe 5 mins, shrimp 3 and calamari 1-2 mins. Served it in deep bowls with crusty bread and salad. Wonderful! Will make it again and maybe use crushed tomatoes in addition to the diced to give it a more tomato-ey flavor. Definitely give this recipe a try!

Was really good actually :D...  I accidently bought whole peeled tomatoes but it worked...wish it was a lil more tomatoey... However it was still great. I added double basil thyme oregano and parsly.... Also added rosemary and dried lemon peel Probably 4x as much garlic I eyed the wine. Also which I really liked was replacing half the cod with salmon adding calamari and also adding....ITALIAN SAUSAGE!  Sorry my review is all unorganized btw >.>

Maybe I used a too sweet wine but I did not like this recipe as much as one I already have.. I'd rather use olive oil, fresh herbs and no tomatoes.

My family and I had this for the first time tonight and everyone loved it. I didn't have fresh seafood so I used frozen and it still came out delicious. I used a sauvignon blanc wine but you could also use a chardonnay. I'm thankful to the person who recommended a large pot. I went out and bought a 12 quart stockpot and it had room to spare. I also bought snow crab legs, broke them into managable sizes and dropped them into the pot at the same time as the other seafood. We had the stew with crusty mini baguettes and a nice salad. All in all the whole meal cost about $50 for 4 people with lots of leftovers. I will definately make this again....just not very often! LOL!!

Company was late, so the broth simmered for close to 2 hours.  It tasted fabulous!  The flavors were well blended, and the broth was subtle.  It was a huge hit.  Next time I make this , I will probably simmer for that long again.  Great recipe!!!

Awesome dish.  I used fresh herbs from my garden and instead of the second can of crushed tomatoes I used 3 very large fresh tomatoes (seeded and chopped).  I also increased the wine to 2 cups and didn't use any water at all.  I used fresh scallops, shrimp, salmon and mussels and agree that the mussels should go in 5 minutes before the rest of the fish.  Also used 1/2 chicken and 1/2 vegetable broth with a two tablespoons of fish sauce and a sprinkle of dried chilies to bump up the flavor and give it a little punch.  Fished it off with freshly chopped basil.   DIVINE!  Serves 6 easily.

I made this tonight & I thought it was pretty good but my husband on the other hand didn't care for it & he LOVES muscles! I made the broth as stated except I used half fish stock & half chicken broth to give it more of a seafood taste, I also replaced the water with clam juice & added way more garlic since we are garlic lovers! And added a few shakes of red pepper flakes. The broth was great....my husband agrees this was the only thing that was good!! But that was my fault I bought fresh muscles & clams but cheeped out & bought a frozen bag of mixed seafood that was absolutely horrible!! Also both my husband & I thought it needed more substance, either potatoes & rice or egg noodles added to it. The broth was great though! But again it was my fault.

My wife says, "I like yours better....."  HAHA, but it's not so different, either.  I use no butter or oil beyond sauteeing the sofrito (onion, carrot, celery) in the beginning.  The secret weapon is a fennel bulb instead of celery, there.  It adds a unique sweetness that goes really well, and I got that from some famous chef (who I don't recall).  I grind the stock to make a thick broth, and then add some fish to cook down, which makes a fish stew.  Then I add the whole pieces and shellfish only at the end, as here.  Rich, thick and yummy with french bread.  Some advice for newbies:  It doesn't matter a whole lot what fish you use, but you want lean whitefish in general - salmon really doesn't belong here.  And a great cioppino is expensive - be ready for a $50 pot of soup.....  Oh, yeah, a bit of red pepper flakes is standard for cioppono, too. It's supposed to have a bit of a kick to it - just a bit.

All I can say is- WOW! This turned out marvelous! My house smelled so good, I was practically in a state of euphoria. Just let your inhibitions go, and go crazy at the seafood counter: white fish, scallops (the big ones), mussels, clams, Alaskan crab legs, giant prawns, dungeness crab. I dumped everything in and just let it steep in the sauce. Who would have thought such prosaic ingredients could come together in such a miraculous way? I served this with a really good Merlot, a round loaf of sourdough, and about 5,000 napkins... the meal was spectacular! Just keep a nutcracker, and bowl on the table for shells. Yes, it costs a small fortune to make, but so what- everyone deserves a truly fabulous dinner once in a while! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I'm only giving this a three for now. I'd like to make it again and review later.  I would leave the fresh parsley out...I didn't like the taste...sort of bitter. I also thought there wasn't enough broth, so I added a little more of all the liquids. I added a bottle of clam juice, as others suggested. I'd also reduce the onions and add some spice. Overall, a good dish, but you may want to make some adjustments to suit your own tastes. I really thought the white wine was a great addition though. Very tasty.

Excellent Recipe!  Restaurant quality.

...just a few changes:

1/2 cup olive oil (instead of butter)
1 large onion (instead of 2)
3 cloves of garlic (instead of 2)
omitted water
used 2 lbs of a frozen seafood medley mix (calamari, cod, shrimp,scallops)
28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes
added red pepper flakes and salt to taste

I followed the same directions and used the rest of the ingredients on the recipe with the changes above.

Awesome!!! I made a few changes, took some hints from other reviews. Such as, used 1 large can of crushed tomatoes with 4 cups of water. I added 1 tbs of clam soup base and 2 tbs of chicken soup base and some extra garlic.  (I use soup bases instead of canned broth -- think it is much more flavorful & has less sodium.  It can be found in the soup aisle of the grocery store.)  I also took the shrimp shells, put them in cheese cloth and put the in the broth to simmer for over an hour, until we were just about ready to eat.  I took out the shrimp shells and then added the seafood, first the clams & mussels for about 5 min, till they start to open, then the shrimp, scallops and cod. Cook stirring frequently until the shrimp curl and the scallops are just firm (about 3 minutes). Everything was cooked just right and the flavor.......unbelievable!!! (My son has worked at gourmet restaurants and said it was one of the best he ever tasted.)  The recipe served 3 adults and we had lots left over. I took the meat out of the shells and put them in the broth, Two days later, I brought the broth with seafood to a simmer and then added tortellini .....it was a great soup & didn't seem like a leftover.

Delicious!  I went with some other reviewers and used big can of crushed tomatoes and italian stewed tomatoes..clam juice instead of water and a little more garlic/herbs, plus red pepper flakes for some heat.  A great base to modify according to your likes.  I let simmer for 1 1/2 hours before adding the seafood in stages (clams, crab legs, big scallops, halibut and large shrimp).  Dramatic presentation and perfect for Christmas dinner! The thing I loved most about it was I wasn't slaving in the kitchen, missing my family - it was perfect :)

Yum, I love this stuff.  But my recipe calls for 3/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes to add some heat to it.  Saw a how too video to make on foodwishes.com

I also let it boil down a little bit more so it is not a soup but a sauce.  I boil some linguine which I top with the cioppino and fresh grated parmesan cheese.  Serve with a fresh salad and crusty bread or garlic bread.  

finish the meal with a mix of fresh cut up fruit like:  pineapple, mango, strawberries and papaya.

Rave reviews from my family. Felt like a restaurant chef.  Didn't have mussels, so used clams, scallops, shrimp and lump crab from the can (believe it or not), and it was fabulous. Took hints from others and used clam juice instead of the water, and I also added in a tsp of Old Bay seasoning.  The shrimp and scallops cooked really quickly (1 min?) so next time I'll be ready to get the clams in sooner.  Threw the lump crab in at the very end just to warm it up. THX for giving me the courage to try a stew I never considered before!

Used Halibut instead of cod, and reduced the recipe in 1/2.  Everyone loved it. Also, omit the water, and used clam juice in its place. Tasted even better as leftovers, after all of the fish tastes blended.

Very good and very easy to prepare but what's best about cioppino are the never ending variations. I added chopped pepper and mushrooms to the onion base. Throw in zucchini and asparagus with the fish to add veggie bulk.

This is pretty awesome, and very fast to put together. I didn't have any clams, mussels or crabmeat, which I am sure would have made the dish more flavourful. I just subbed with more cod, shrimp and scallops. My husband loved this.

Added red pepper flakes for extra zing, but otherwise made exactly as per the recipe. Very good, but think I'll leave out the cod the next time - there's more than enough in there without it! Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for my daughter, who is a seafood nut, and she's been bugging me to make it again ever since.  The only thing I did differently was I used fresh herbs instead of dried, and substituted cod for salmon.  Orherwise, wouldn't change anything else!

This is excellent!  I used fresh basil, and added red pepper flakes and clam juice in place of water.  Don't count on the serving size though.  It's so good that everyone eats seconds. We were sopping up every last drop of the broth with our bread and wishing for more.  Yummy.

I made this for some friends and they couldn't stop talking about it for a week!  It is alittle expensive but worth it...it tastes just like a 5 star restaurant dish.  I'm making it again for my boyfriend tonight.

Fantastic receipe! I changed a few things some ideas from other reviews. I used 50% of the  butter and added extra virgin olive oil. Also added calamari, plus crushed tomatoes and lots of fresh crushed garlic. Did not add water just double the white wine (Chardonnay). My wife, friends, kids (6,4, & 2) just loved it. It was an absolute hit!!! Thank you.

Very Good! I also agreed with other reviewers and slightly adjusted the recipe. Used a couple Tbsp of Extra virgin olive oil instead of butter and halved the recipe. Used 1 jumbo can of crushed tomatoes with basil and 1 14 oz can of stewed tomatoes. Didn't add any water, but used 1 bottle of clam juice. Added a tsp of better than bouillon chicken broth for extra flavor. Only had cod, scallops, and crab meat on hand so used that. Cut the scallops into quarters since they were so big. Added celery tops chopped and 2 handfuls of fresh spinach for extra veg. Topped with fresh chopped basil, parmesan cheese and a drizzle of balsamic glaze. Really tasty after these adjustments!

Fabulous!! I did add some red pepper flakes for some kick. Used a bag of frozen mixed seafood (mussels/shrimp/calamari/scallops) from Costco and made this recipe really affordable (I think the bag was $15). Will definitelly make this again.

This is the best cioppino I have ever had and I have ordered cioppino a lot.  The sauce was fabulous.  I made the sauce a day ahead.  At the dinner party I just had to heat the sauce up and throw in all the fish. Everyone loved it. In fact, no one talked for about 5 minutes, they were loving the cioppino so much.
This is a real hit.

This was very tasty, sophisticated and easy to prepare.  My boyfriend was blown away.  A few changes (for 4 servings): I used much less butter than recommended and added a tablespoon or so of olive oil. As suggested by users, I used roughly a half bottle of dry white wine, two cans of whole tomatoes (without the tomato sauce), 4 garlic cloves, red chili pepper and extra parsley.  Also, I left out the cod because crab legs, bay scallops, mussels, shrimp and clams seemed more fun than plain old cod.  Here in California, it's not terribly expensive to buy fresh seafood, although  I could only find precooked crab legs.  The crab legs make for a dramatic display.  Since I detest white wine (rose might have worked though), I served this with a Barolo.  It was healthy, delicious, and fun to eat!!

This was absolutely wonderful. Just as good as I used to get at a local restaurant in San Francisco called Scott's. I had never attempted this before so I took some of the suggestions from other reviews and added clam juice and no water. My guest couldn't even believe I whipped it up in so little time. Very impressive and little work. Just make sure you have lots of napkins for the guest. I put in baby lobster tales and they were a bit of a challenge but worth it. Thank you for a great recipe.

I would rate this recipe 5-star except for the minimal tomato content.  This calls for only one can (I made it for 6 servings) of crushed tomatoes, which doesn't impart the tomato flavor that cioppino should have.  I made it exactly per the recipe but added a 14.5-oz can of tomato sauce and half a small can of tomato paste.  That did the job for me.

Fantastic!  I doubled the herbs and added quite a bit more stock (because the fishy broth is my favorite part!).  First time I've ever made Ciopinno, and it was a lot easier than I had anticipated.  Enjoyed it with some crusty bread from Trader Joe's

Absolutely wonderful! I tried a few times with butter and once with olive oil. Unlike the majority of reviewers I like butter-base much better. It was kinda watery otherwise. So: I'll stick to the original recipe. Definitely use fish stock instead of water (I use clam juice) or simply add more wine or chicken broth. One of our favorite dishes in the house (when we feel like splurging a little :))

I know I am in the minority here, but it was just average for me, not great - and really pricey to make. I was really looking forward to this.   The only changes I made was to substitute more mussels since I had no clams, chicken broth instead of water and 1 can of stewed + 1 diced tomatoes. Changes didn't seem too drastic.  I expected more. Now I have a lot leftover- I will try to re-purpose leftovers into a pasta sauce for linguini.   Sorry but I will try another recipe next time.

This did not turn out as I hoped. I used homemade crab broth instead of chicken broth. i took one person's advice and mushed up the fish to make a thicker broth base. I cooked my mussels and clams first, waiting til they opened before putting in the crab, shrimp and scallops. However, the shells were blocking the crab, shrimp & scallops from getting to the broth. I used tongs and pulled out all the clams/mussels before putting in the other seafood. It was a very frustrating (and expensive) experience. I have 2 tupperwares of this stuff in the freezer and need to figure out how to convince my family to eat the left overs!

Febuary 2011 I took the frozen left overs and added a can of tomatoes (i had only added 1 can before) and t cayenne pepper. Now it tastes better. I'd bring it up to 3 1/2 stars

I had a lovely picnic with the love of my life  (who happens to love mussels) by cooking this on a propane camp stove.  It turned out beautifully.  I left out the onions (my love doesn't love onions) and replaced the onions with onion salt.  I used all chicken broth in place of the white wine as well.  The dish was perfect, and was enojyed again the next day by adding another few pounds of mussels and reheating.  What a wonderful dish...it's sure to be a staple in our house once we are married.

This is my absolute favorite recipe on this site.  Its a bit expensive because I like to use large shrimp and sea scallops.  I usually add more chicken broth because I like a lot of "soup". You can use any type of seafood...this Cioppino is fantastic!

This is the first recipe for cioppino that I ever made.  I did not like the Cioppino that is in spaghetti sauce so when I found this one I thought I would try it.  My family loves it!  So much so that my husband and I used this recipe for a Cioppino Feed for my son's school.  It was a huge success and everyone asked if we were going to do it again next year!  I give it four stars because we made a few changes.  1. We split the butter into half butter and half olive oil.  2.  We eliminated the water and replaced it with clam juice.  3.  We added a lot more garlic.  4. Added diced celery to the onion and the garlic.  5. Added salt.  6. We also used crab legs instead of crab meat.  Other then those changes we followed the recipe as written.  Try this recipe, you will not be disappointed!

Every yr. I celebrate my b'day with a cioppino party. An expensive dish that required some clever thought. I have every guest bring a crab and a choice of one of the other ingredients. They love to participate, makes for a family athmosphere. 
This recipe is by far the greatest in my years of cioppino experience. This was my seventy second b'day dinner and I had to promise to envite the same people again. Five big shooting stars for this one. I changed nothing, added nothing. When I tasted the sauce, I was tempted to grab a loaf of sour dough and have at it. One thing, I allowed it to cook down a little so it wasn't so soupy. It clinged to everything and everybody. : )

Awesome!  I've made this almost 10 times now and I get rave reviews from everyone.  I sub out the water with clam juice, add crushed red pepper, and use canned chopped clams and no mussels.  Any seafood will do though!  Excellent!

Incredible!!  My kids told me this was "by far the best meal I have ever cooked!"  I followed some of the other suggestions and added red pepper flakes and used clam juice instead of water.  Used all fresh seafood and I did add a small can of tomato sauce to add a little more tomato flavor.  Turned out just perfect and oh so yummy!!  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!! This will be made again and again in my house..............

i omitted the fish just because this makes so much seafood.  Next time I will even omit the crabmeat and add lobster parts instead (with shell on)  Broth is excellent with crusty french bread.  I will add celery next time and a little red pepper flakes.  Thanks.

This was amazing!  I order Cioppino at a Italian restaurant we frequent and this was just as good if not better!! I actually added 1 cup chicken stock instead of water and a can of minced clams in juice.  Served it over Penne, Just PERFECT

My ITALIAN husband LOVED it!!!!  I quote "This is definately a keeper..."  Make any substitutions you want with the fish and it is still great.  You don't have to spend a bunch of money to make it good.  As the other reviewer suggested, use the clam juice.  It's really good and easy.

This was a snap to prepare.  Served it last night for company and we all enjoyed it.  I will definitely keep this recipe and make it again.  It's a great meal for anyone who loves fish.  I used little neck clams, jumbo shrimp, bay scallops and tilapia.  Tilapia is not the best fish to use, but that was the only fresh fish available that was firm enough.  I cooked the clams first, took them out after they opened, cooked the shrimp next, took them out, then the scallops and the tilapia.  They all cooked very quickly.  Thank you Star for a great recipe.

Absolutely loved this dish!!  I made it for New Years Eve and it was a huge hit with my husband. Doubled the portion on everything and still had lots leftover to serve another 9 people the next day! I served it over spaghetti one night and then over rice the following day (and was told this should become my signature dish for the family). I purchased the seafood portion at Costco: frozen bag of "seafood medley", scallops and farmed mussels (didn't bother with crabmeat or cod) I also added perhaps a cup more of tomato sauce and let the sauce simmer for approximately 2 hours.

Made this tonight and it was AMAZING!!  Used shrimps, cod, scallops and 1 can (juice and all) of baby clams.  I also used 1 250ml bottle of clam juice, instead of water.  Used diced tomatoes and crushed tomatoes.
As a side, we had thinly sliced fennel drizzled with olive oil.
I also tried the stew with a touch of balsamic on it soo good!!

Perfect.

I added 2-8 ounce jars of clam juice and did not add any water.
Used precooked clams/mussels and added them for the last minute or so just to heat them.
Also added about 1/4 cup more wine to the mix.
My husband and his friend who was visiting went back for seconds and asked if I would make it again soon.
Great Recipe.

I followed the recipe to a "t"...the next time I think I will use olive oil instead of the butter and clam juice instead of the water. We added about 1/2 cup more wine and salt to get the flavor where we were happy with it. Super base recipe...

Absolutely fantastic! This is the perfect recipe for a seafood lover on a chilly day. I made this per the recipe (cut down a bit for fewer servings) and was not dissappointed. It is a bit on the expensive side if you don't live near the coast, but well worth it for the unmatched flavor. It's super easy to make and very hearty and filling with tons of seafood - without an overly fishy flavor. I'll definately be making this one again!

Really good , I added double the wine and no water also next time I will add 1/2 the oregano I scooped some out. I like the diced tomatoes instead of stewed and clam juice instead of chk broth :)

The whole family loved it! I have always wanted to make cioppino but was intimidated. This was worth the expense of all the fresh seafood. I doubled the sauce which was great for us.

Excellent recipe. I did it for my mother's birthday and she and my father were completely in love with this.
I have to say I tweaked two things : as it was a bit too watery for my taste, I added a spoon of maïz. And I had no oregano but I used marjoram which is almost the same thing.
Served this with rice. 
A HUGE success. Thank you for sharing.

The whole family loved it and gobbled it up.  I would have preferred more of a tomatoe-y thicker broth but it was good.  However, extremly EXPENSIVE to make when you buy all the fresh seafood.  I spent $90 just on seafood and I eliminated the cod.

This is without a doubt the best meal I have ever made. I made it for my family for mother's day and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and while this recipe is very adaptable, I wouldn't change a thing. Make sure to have bread for soaking the broth and have two big bowls for discarding the shells and tails. I used white crabmeat because it was cheaper than lump crabmeat and while it somewhat disappeared into the broth, I think it added to the richness of the broth. I was afraid one bunch of fresh parsley would be too much, but it wasn't. Everything tasted incredible. Everyone had seconds and there was only one bowl of leftovers, which still tasted great the next day. My dad, who is an amazing cook wants the recipe. While it is expensive, this is something everyone should experience at least once in their life.

Cooked up great in the crock pot!  Like everyone else I did some slight moderations.  I'm allergic to pink shellfish so I didn't use crab or shrimp in mine.  I used fresh wild clams, canned clams, scallops, and tilapia instead of cod - I skipped out on the mussels.  I replaced the water with clam juice and instead of adding stewed tomatoes I cut up a fresh tomato.  Also I added a pinch of crushed red pepper.  I tossed all the ingredients except for the seafood into the crock pot and turned it on high for 4 hours.  For the last half hour I added the fresh clams, then at the last 15 minutes I added the rest of the seafood.  So tasty!  I'm a novice cook so I was a little surprised to see that salt was not included in the list of ingredients.  This stew didn't need any.  It was perfect.

We made this for Christmas Eve dinner.  It's a tradition in our family to have seven fish on Chrismtas Eve.  I truly believe this may have been the very best cioppino I've ever had!  It was fun to make and smelled divine!  Even my 100% Italian mother and grandmother wanted the recipe!  E buonissimo!

This was an expensive dish but was EASY and EXCELLENT!  I had to make a few substitutions due to local availability and personal taste.  But I don't think it matters too much which seafood you choose.  I served with sour dough and a green salad.

This is the best Cioppino ever!!! Much better than any restaurant I've ever tried; and I'm from San Francisco!

I've made this Cioppino several times just as it is but yesterday I made it for Valentine's day for my new beau . I added 1/2 a can of condensed tomato soup and used a really good Chardonnay. The depth in flavor was delectable! He thinks I'm a major Chef!! Little does he know..
If you like your Cioppino with a touch of sweetness, definitely add the tomato soup.

What did I do wrong?  I unfortunately did not read some of the reviews that recommended adding the clam juice.  I think this would have made a world of difference.  I thought the sauce was a bit bland.  I doubt I will make this again.

Absolutely wonderful! I made a pot of this cioppino on Valentine's Day and brought it to my husband's office for dinner, since he had to work. A picnic basket full of this, warm crusty bread, and a bottle of wine...delicious! He asks for it all of the time now!

I made a few modifications, 2 cups of super strong Greek wine (no water), and 2 sticks of butter...plus FRESH herbs. You must make this, its soooooo good.

I made this cioppino last winter, and got rave reviews.  One of my guests said 
it was the best they had ever had.  Am doing an encore this weekend.

This was great! Used whole shrimp (w/heads) & crab legs. Added squid and crushed red pepper.

This was a great dish!!  I substituted Crab in its shell for the crab meat (pre-cooked, add at the last minute to keep it from getting too soft).

I gave this recipe 4 stars only because it needed some tweeking.  If you take a look at the additions below, it is surly a 5 star dish. I added 2 different spices for some heat...cayenne and plain ol'black pepper.  very nice!  I also added squid rings...
lots of leftovers that traveled well to work the next day

This was great!  The first time I ever made a Cioppino.  The broth was wonderful!  Start with a big pot!!!  Mine was so full I had a hard time stirring the last ingredients in (what a problem to have, right?)

A very good basic recipe.  You can basically use whatever fish/shellfish you want, though it's better to use a firm white fish like halibut or cod.  I added a little tomato paste for some depth of flavor, and San Marzano tomatoes.  I also added a small shot of Balsamic Vinegar (something my great grandpa always added at the end of his).  I grew up with Cioppino, and this recipe is a great launching point for it.

My husband was absolutely stunned and very pleased with this recipe. The kids and I made him a formal dinner at home with music, candlelight, and flowers. This was his bday dinner. My girls participated in the cooking and were very happy to see Daddy so pleased! The girls asked for seconds meaning that these fussy eaters gave this recipe 5stars. I did modify...I used no water...instead clam juice...seafood brooth instead of chicken..instead of cooking the brooth for 30 min I simmered for 1 hour as reviews suggested. Its a great dinner to impress guests and to serve on special occassions. This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent and easy recipe!  Should be made for anyone who loves seafood.  Our modification: used basa fillets rather than cod (couldn't find cod) in large cubes.  Was amazing, and will make this again.  WARNING:  This recipe makes a large quantity!

This is an amazing dish! My husband made this for me and my whole family last night for my b-day dinner. Everyone loved it even my two 10 yr olds,7 yr old and 2 yr old! It's not cheap but it did feed all 14 of us! We used the original recipe, don't mess wit perfection. He only doubled the garlic and shell fish, even threw 2 lobster tails in there because of the size of our fam. Delish!! We are now making this a traditional b-day dinner. Happy B-Day to me!! Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe. Thanks to my hubby for making it happen!

The list of ingredients looks daunting, but it really isn't that bad once you get going. Simmering the sauce a bit gives it time for the spices to kick in, and adding a bit of butter gives some depth. I serve this in oversized white bowls, with warm, crusty bread. Guests are always impressed and you look like a chef!

Devine! Can't believe I did not rate this yet. I usually scale the recipe down to half. Well, all I have to say is the broth is the boss (w/out the water). You can add whatever shellfishes you may want. We like to use mussels the most , use del monte or s&w italian canned tomatoes (stewed, diced, crushed, whatever), and sometimes add heavy cream to it at the end....ooooweee!

My husband said the broth tasted like dirty dishwater. After spending $60 on all of the items that go into this dish, and hearing that - i was very disappointed. I thought it was okay, but I served myself the stew over a piece of crusty garlic bread.

The recipe was very good and my family liked it.  It was 100% tastier the next day.  I added some tomato paste to give some extra flavor.  I also served over plain pasta with extra french bread.  I would definitely make again!

Excellent recipe!  I made the following changes.  First, I halved the recipe.  I only added cod and scallops.  Since I did not have fresh onion or garlic - I added dried onions/garlic powder. I used leftover white wine from fridge and instead of stewed tomatoes - used 2 cans of petite diced tomato.

I was looking for a Cioppino that emulated the amazing dish that I've had several times at an award-winning Italian restaurant in Miami.  THIS IS BETTER! My boyfriend is Italian and has had the cioppino at the restaurant.  He liked this better.  I used a little bit (but not much) of olive oil instead of butter.  It was amazing.  The leftover "fish stew" is perhaps even better the next day.  (I simply made too much for two).  Excellent! Kudos.

Wonderful. And what a nice dish for special occasions. I followed the recipe as much as I could taking into consideration what I had on hand. I used evoo and a smidge of butter combined but cut the amount down. I only had dry herbs and I used clam broth instead of water, and scaled the seafood to our taste. I made the broth the day before to let the flavors meld. I would give this more stars if I could. Thanks.

There is only one way to say it...  phe·nom·e·nal!!!  I loved this. Made a few modifications, and it was still DELICIOUS!  I used Halibut instead of Cod, substituted clams for mussels (not a fan), and added a lot of extra spices - including seasalt and heavy cracked pepper.  Served with a crusty green olive loaf of bread, and it was a 10+++.  No kidding - try this - we will definitely make this again!  :-)

I am in LOVE with this stew. I'm not a "soup" person, but this recipe is astounding. Very rich and distinct, and the "warm crusty bread" suggestion is a must! In place of some missing seafood I used chunks of chicken breast, as well as some pasta shells, and it came out wonderful.

I loved this recipe.Needed to chage it a little.That's what the fishermen would do.It would be according to the catch.Couldn't come up with the crab so I bought lobster and had it steamed at the store.Then cut it in bite sized pieces and put it in at the end just to heat through. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

the way the real Italians eat this is over white rice.  This should be more of a stew, not a soup.

I wish I could give this 20 stars. This is AWESOME!!! Doubled the mussels and left out the clams. Also substituted clam juice for the water. Used tilapia instead of Cod. Make sure you have lots of bread! Don't leave out the crab meat - I only used an 8oz refrigerated jar. Try to find claw meat, if price is an issue. It really makes the broth. I used a sweeter local wine. Just delicious!

I cook alot and was looking for a good seafood dish. This is incredible! I Did not have clams, but I used a fresh seafood mix..which included squid, octopuss,mussels, crab and more. I used a bit more white wine, green bell pepper...and added canjun spices to make this more of a cajun/italian infussed dish. I also added some rice to it. I had only compliments from those who ate it.

awesome! One of my favorites. The only thing that I do different is cook a seafood stock first and then use that as my base in the soup. Just makes it a lot richer.

Perfect taste! Right amount of tomato.  Wonderful broth.  
Added all the seafood at once. Clams were under cooked and the cod broke up into little flakes. Next time I will put the parsley in the last few minutes of simmering.  30 min made it gray. 
Then I will put the clams in about 5 min before the rest of the seafood.  Once the rest of the seafood looks 1/2 done I will add the cod.

I did not add the clams or mussels (can only afford so much seafood on a 2-student budget) but did everything else as listed. It was WONDERFUL! Served over couscous, this dish is a wnderful addition to our dinner table.

Fabulous! This is the 1st recipe I tried that I won't change the 2nd time around. Substituted clam juice for the water after reading reviews. Also, added shallots to the garlic & used fresh bay leaves & fresh basil (doubled all herbs) & some Emeril's Essence for seasoning. I used red snapper for a firm fish & crab legs instead of meat...I dished up the broth with a few pieces of seafood & then served the shellfish etc. in a bowl. Nice presentation!

Went over very well.  Had lots of good flavor and juice to be soaked up by the bread.  The only major changes I made were to reduce the amount of fish (used 3/4 lb instead) because there was already so much good stuff and I omitted the mussels (because I don't like mussels).

After reading the reviews, I just had to make this dish for Christmas eve dinner. I used canned clams and crab, frozen scallops and prawns and a mixture of fresh fish, added potatoes and carrots (not too much, just enough to thicken it), cayenne pepper and chillie flakes as the others had suggested. 
It was fantastic. Everyone loved it :-)

Absolutely delicious! I only made a couple changes, I used 1 cup of clam juice instead of water, added a couple extra cloves of garlic, some dried chilis and some fresh Pacific Northwest salmon. We had company that evening and everyone raved for hours about how good it was. This is a new favourite for us!

I looked up this recipe very shortly after I had Cioppino for the first time at Franchesci's on Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.  (Also highly recommended) Let me just say that this recipe equals and in certain aspects betters that recipe.  Do yourself a big favor and make this recipe tonight, but PLEASE do not abuse your culinary license to substitute ingredients.  I have made this recipe MANY times, and it always tastes best when I follow Star's recipe exactly.  Thank you Star!

A wonderful medley of seafood!  This was very tasty.  I like the fact that you can be really creative with what you put in it.  I'm not a huge fan of mussels so I'll leave those out next time.  Yummy!

This recipe was very expensive, but also very worth the money and time.  It is a simple but elegant seafood dish, and is also very good the next day gently reheated.

What a wonderful recipe!  I used bay scallops, shrimp, cod, and canned clams.  I reserved the clam juice and simmered with the stew before adding the seafood.  My boyfriend absolutely raved about this one.

I don't know what everyone's been complaining about! This soup is anything but bland, even when made with no substitutions. While the cost and fat content may be something to turn up your nose at, the taste makes it all worth it.

People kept coming into the kitchen when I was cooking this wanting to know what smelled so good.  I had to give out samples before I could take it to the event I was making it for.  I added crushed red pepper like some of the other reviewers, cut back on the butter and added olive oil.  It was definately a hit.  Even the kids came back for sconds and thirds.  Serving with warm crusty bread is a must.

This is the best cioppino recipe I've tried-  and I have tried several.  As others suggested, I used clam juice in lieu of water.  I also used Del Monte Italian Blend Stewed tomatoes instead of regular.  This is a delicious, hearty meal--- easy to make but very pricey so I will only make it on special occasions.  Served it over bow-tie pasta and it was a huge hit.  Thanks for a keeper!

With all that seafood it couldn't help but be delicious.  The grocery bill just getting the ingredients was well over $100.  Yikes!  A special occasion only dish, perhaps.

Outstanding!  My sister-in-law and I made this for our Christmas day dinner and we received RAVE reviews.  I've always been afraid to cook shellfish but not anymore.  This was easy to cook, it tasted great and best of all, it was a really fun meal.  My advice?  Don't waste any energy on salad - once your guests see the cioppino all energies are focused there.  Our salad went untouched while everyone went back for seconds and thirds!  One other piece of advice -- buy plastic bibs for your guests.  It's a messy meal but armed with a bib our guests ate it with gusto!

I made this for my boyfriend on Valentine's and it turned out excellent!!  He's a tough critic, so when he said it was better than any restaurant's version, I know I hit the jackpot.  Only thing I would do differently is cut down on the cilantro to 1/4 c.  You cannot beat this recipe for taste and looks...a must try!!  I can't wait to make this again.

Absolute heaven! I scaled the recipe to 6 but now I wish I had just cooked a whole pot. The longer I let this simmer (total of 5 hours), the better it tasted. I agree with the others who suggested adding crushed pepper. Shaking in about 2 tsp. of the pepper adds a bit more zip without making things too spicy.

Outstanding!!!  I've made this twice, and my wife and I absolutely love it.  We use clams, mussles, shrimp and scallops - we put the shrimp and scallops on the bottom, the mussels and clams on top (cleaned thoroughly, of course), cover, and once the shells open - it's done!  If you're seafood is fresh you'll enjoy an eating extravaganza that bests great Italian restaurants, is cheaper (by a lot!) and gives you much more to enjoy.  Come hungry, and bring lots of fresh crusty bread.  Enthusiastically 5 stars!!!

This is fantastic...adding Ahi tuna and a little cumin and capcicum(red pepper)
to taste..plus scallops lots of garlic make this a colds nightmare. I have shared
 this recipe with many friends and they all say the same....Awesome, whats the
 recipe! A+.for sure.

DH made this and said he followed the recipe exactly.  Well, he did use more onion than stated.  He also used canned crab and I would have bought crab legs.  Hoped we'd like this better, it is a pain living in the Midwest, just don't get the best seafood here.  Saving this for our vacation trips though and I will give it a shot myself.

Loved the recipe and how fast is was to make.  
Our local Costco (Olympia, WA) sells bags of mixed seafood - shrimp, clams, scallops etc.  Instead of buying all the seafood separately just used one of those bags.  Thawed it, removed the clams from the already opened shells and rinsed and added it to the soup mixture.  Costco also sells frozen cod fillets - thawed a couple of those and cut them up and added it to the soup.

Made this yesterday for Good Friday made as written except I used Alskan King crab legs cut into 3 inch  pieces, basa fillet chunks, med shrimp instead of clams, cuttlefish,and mussels. Also added more wine and used one one container of chicken broth. I like more wine flavour. Omitted onion as I don't like onions with shellfish. Added more garlic instead. Family loved it and much to my dismay there were no leftovers :(

This was absolutely wonderful!!  The only changes I made were due to the availability of the seafood.  For instance, the shrimp and scallops came in a 1# bag. Also, we used seafood stock instead of chicken broth.  The result was amazing!  I'm looking forward to leftovers today.

i didn't add muscles, crab, clams or wine. i was more generous with the same spices required and rather than stewed tomatoes used crushed.  Both my husband and I loved it, it's a great base idea and permits one to add too it and still have an amazing stew.

This recipes is amazing!! I just made this for dinner, and it isn't cheap, but it's worth it.  I doubled the broth so I could fit all this great seafood into it.  This was a huge hit.  Thank you for posting this :-)

This i by far the best recipe i've made on this site. I made this almost exactly. I did substitute the water for clam juice and added thick slices of carrot. I steamed them first to soften. delicious!!!!!! next time I will cut down on the butter you def. don't need this much. thanks for a geat recipe will make again for sure.

Fantastic!  I made the base the night before to let the flavors soak in and it was great!  I warmed it up the next day and brought it to a boil dropped it to a low and threw all the fish in for about 8 minutes.

Don't feel bad if you can't get fresh seafood.  Not everyone lives on the coast.  Substituted EV olive oil for butter, why butter for a Mediterranean dish? The only thing missing in this recipe is salt salt salt.  Add 2 teaspoons of salt.  It was bland until I added that.  I cooked the broth for about 1 hour 15 minutes before adding the seafood.

EXCELLENT!  My first time making Cioppini.  I added more more tomatoes and their liquid, more chicken broth, onions and garlic so I would have more broth.  It was SO good even my (little) kids devoured it!  You won't be disappointed!

Fabulous!  My family really enjoyed .... I did not add water though .. doesn't need it.  Instead of using just crabmeat I added whole crab legs ... will be making this again!  I wouldn't add cod fillets either ... it doesn't hold up well.  I did add at the last minute and it still didn't rubbery.  Next time I cook this I will cook cod on the side.

Aug 21st 2010, I made this for my friends massive summer BBQ and Pig Roast. I changed the serving size to 30 people and it still wasn’t enough.  Even when it just broth / soup in the bottom of the pan, people came by and dipped bits of food to soak it up.  I actually never got a taste but everyone loved it.  Several people told me to make again next year.  The only changes I made were these. I used unsalted butter, I left out the scallops (allergies) and I added a some andouille sausage. For onions, I used Walla Walla’s (I live in the Northwest) I added the sliced sausage just as the onion, garlic and parsley mixture was done. The rest was as the recipe stated.  No salt. No pepper.

Just can't say enough... YUM!  This is not an inexpensive dish and the way that I make it, there are ALWAYS TONS of leftovers, but the effort and the cost are well worth it.  I only have two suggestions and they both revolve around your final product's texture.  I've made this with both lump crab meat and king crab legs (in the shell).  Unless you like the crabmeat to simply be a part of the sauce, even with lump meat, you stir the mixture enough that it breaks down and dissappears.  The king crab legs were fantastic.  I had reservations, but they turned out amazing.  The other thing to watch is the fish.  Again, depending upon the fish and how long it's in, it will begin to flake quickly.  As others have noted, to fix this add the fish last.  Also, I picked a hardier fish.  I went last time with the poor man's lobster and got monkfish.  It turned out amazing and has a consistency that can take the "abuse" of being stirred in the pot.  I will definitely continue to use monkfish with this recipe.

OMG...This is so good...Had to make a few changes due to what I had in the house (didn't feel like shopping). I omitted the butter altogether and substituted 1/4 cup EEOV.  I only used 1lb shrimp, 1lb scallops, 1lb tilapia (which I will say probably held together better than cod) and two cans of minced clams (we don't care for mussels and didn't have any crab).   Also added 1 jar of crab broth/liquid and omitted the water.  Threw in a tbls of red pepper flakes as recommended by other reviewers and then just had the most wonderful meal.  Planning on freezing the leftovers..hope that works out well as this is too good (and expensive) to waste.  My husband raved about this and he's pretty spoiled and doesn't ever get too excited about "soup"....ENJOY

UMMMM YUM!! This was so yummy.  I took the advice of others and simmered it for longer.  I also added some cayenne and crushed red pepper.  You can use any kind of seafood.  So good.

This is the best cioppino recipe I have ever used. For a nice lunch or appetizer option omit all the other seafood items and just use the broth with mussels. I can usually cook about 3 lbs of fresh PEI mussels with the amount of broth in this recipe. It's a less expensive alternative and such a crowd pleaser. Serve with some toasted, crusty bread and butter and a caesar salad. Also-- I usually use the whole head of garlic and 2 sticks of butter, 3 onions and 2 bunches of parsley. :) You're about to have an amazing meal~

This is a great recipe! Totally recommend it for the seafood foodie. I followed the recipe exactly as it is except that I didn't have mussels at the time, so I replaced it with small oysters and added scallops. But the base is still there, the buttery onion broth went so well with the seafood. It was a perfect match. The whole family loved it, especially my father.

This recipe totally rocks! It's anything you could want in a seafood dish and the broth lends itself to pretty much any type of seafood you would want to throw in. For those vegetarians that still enjoy seafood, I can recommend making the stew with vegetable broth as I did. It's absolutely delicious! I can definitely recommend serving two or three crusty baguettes with the stew, it'll go fast and its great for dipping. You can pretty much buy all the seafood in this dish (because I assume you can probably find everything else in your kitchen, I did) for around $50. You can purchase everything frozen with the exception of the  mussels and clams. I highly recommend buying big cherry stone clams and putting one in per bowl if you're serving a lot of people, 13 servings was way more than enough for my family of 6.

This soup was ridiculously good. I will make it again and again.  I did not add all of the shellfish, I only used scallops, but it gave all the flavor to the broth that it needed.  Wow, was it delicious!

If your a seafood lover you will not be disapointed by this recipe it is fantastic. We served this at our daughters high school graduation party and the seafood lovers just raved about it. I obmitted the wine and used fresh herbs. Just a fantastic recipe.

I was looking for a seafood recipe to make for Valentine's day, and came across this one. I am not a fan of tomato based seafood dishes, so I made a few adjustments. First, I cut the recipe in half, (except for the chicken broth)and still had a lot of food! I omitted the tomatoes and added a leek, sliced thinly, salt and white pepper, and a 1/4 tsp crushed saffron threads to the onion and garlic. For the seafood, I used shrimp, scallops, mussels and cod. I also added a pint of half and half at the very end. My husband and 4 year old daughter both loved it!

Took the advice of other reviewers and added extra can of tomatoes instead of water, and a little clam juice from a can of chopped clams and tossed those in there too. All the seafood definitely has different cooking temps. I would suggest putting in the clams first and giving that an extra 5-8 mins before adding scallops, mussels and then I think shrimp and fish last. I didn't bother with getting crab. I reheated the broth after we ate our dinner and it was even richer at the end. Yummy! I'm already craving the next time I make this. By the way, the parsley turns all swampy looking if you add it all at the beginning. i rather sprinkle mine in just before serving.

Wonderful, you could use just a couple or all the different seafoods, and I think it would still turn out delicious.  I love the broth, and I used a yogurt-butter spread instead of real butter to reduce the calories.  I used canned clams, fresh scallops, frozen shrimp, imitation crab, fresh cod, and left out the mussels.  I would not use imitation crab again, it breaks apart really funny when it gets cooked.  No one noticed that but me, though.  I will be making this again when I need something really special for someone.  Next time I'll just use canned clams, cod, shrimp and scallops.

I've made this recipe three times and I believe it is my new comfort food. It is light but satisfying. The first time I made it I shared it with all of my neighborhood friends. Everyone loved it.
I use Mahi Mahi for the fish and omit the mussels but no matter what seafood you use it is delicious.

Had to improvise on this a bit for our tastes!  Added 3/4 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 more can of tomatoes and 2 TBPS of tomato paste.  Very good like that!  Expensive though!

Wow - WAS THIS EVER GOOD! Yes, it was soupy but that was fine for us - the broth was absolutely divine. I'm not a fan of mussels or clams so I omitted them, and only used scallops, shrimp, cod and canned crab. I halved the recipe and made it for myself and my husband for Valentine's Day dinner, and we had plenty for leftovers the next day. I will make this if I ever have seafood-lovers over for dinner and I really want to impress them. It was also very very easy to make. Thanks!!!

Absolutely Amazing dish!!!  The neighborhood came running when they caught word and wind I was making this recipe.  It was however expensive and won't be made again except for very special occasions.  For example: the bay scallops were $8.99 a pound, clams $5.99 a pound, mussels $3.99 a pound, shrimp $6.99 a pound.  Add to that all the other ingredients and the optional fish (we used canned salmon) and expect to spend at least $40 to $50 on this one dish.

Restaurant quality.  This is a very good soup.  Broth is "seafoody sweet" and tangy.  I screwed up the recipe: I cut the recipe in half, but forgot to half the stewed tomatoes and chicken broth.  Still turned out great!  Only half the recipe is needed if you serve bread with the meal.  It will serve at least a couple of meals for today's average-sized family.

Changes I made: Substituted sole for the cod.  Cleaned the meat of about 25 shelled clams instead of using whole clams.  Added a bit of salt and a few red pepper flakes (these really aren't needed; trust me).

Very, very good stuff here.  Fulfilling.

I made this for my husband for Valentine's day and we LOVED it! I highly recommend buying an incredible loaf of bread to go with it too. I did modify it a bit: I omitted the water and mussels and added lots of red pepper flakes. Also, since we are from Michigan I used all frozen seafood. We both agreed it was in our "top 10" favorite meals. I will definitely be making it again!

Delicious!! Very flavorful and extremely hearty soup.  Next time I might add some shitake mushrooms though.  Was surprised at how easy it was too.  Cooking time was only 45 minutes all together.  A keeper!!

My whole family loved this! It was not only tasty but beautify as well. I live in a rural area so I couldn't purchase scallops and mussels to put in  it so I added a few more shrimp.

Excellent recipe!  I've travelled to Seattle just to have this dish at Fisherman's Wharf.  This is even better! used butter & more wine instead of the water.  Instead of canned tomatoes I added Alymer's diced tomatoes with celery & peppers. Easy recipe with stellar results.

This recipe was so easy. It is absolutely amazing. I served it Christmas Eve to rave reviews. I did make few small changes after researching a lot of recipes. To start, I replaced the mussels with Calamari/squid and the cod was changed to halibut. I replaced the water with clam juice (bottled) as well as a cup of the chicken broth was swapped out with clam juice. In addition, I added crushed red pepper (~ 1/4 tsp) and 1/2 tsp of saffron. Finally, I used San Marzano tomatoes that I broke up with a spoon when I added them. I will definitely be making this again.

great base recipe. For those on a budget or just lazy like me, I got a bag of mixed seafood at Costco for $15 which had mussels calamari scallops and shrimp and then added a can of crab meat, clams and bought a pound of salmon. I only used half of the bag of seafood.  I also added a pound of Italian sausage that I grilled beforehand. 
With all that, it made the soup nice and rich and full of yummy goodies in each bite. Oh I also added half a red and half a green pepper diced early on when sautéing. 
It was an awesome meal with fresh grilled Italian sourdough.

I made this as a special meal for my boyfriend, and wow...it came out great! This is not the cheapest of dinners to make, but its so worth it if you can swing it every once in a while. I LOVE this meal as a treat sometimes, especially with crusty bread to dip in it!

I love this recipe! I have made it several times and each time it is better and better. It is our Christmas tradition if we can find all the fish. The only thing I have done to really enhance the flavor is I used my frozen garden tomatoes in this soup. They are so flavorful and all you have to do is rinse the tomatoes under water and peel the skin off and chop. The skin is tough on frozen tomatoes but the summer flavor is still there. I used a garlic press for the garlic so you don't get big chunks of garlic. I like it with a little heat so upped the pepper flakes a little bit. Thank you for this recipe. It is perfect for company or just family.

So Made this Dish for a Date Wow it was a hit. More then the Date... I did make a few changes not much and more like forgot to add lol. 
It was just 2 of us so I made it  enough for 4.
1/2 pound shrimp
10 Sea scallops chopped in half
1/2 pound of mussels (was like 16 of them)
Can of clams 
Jar of Crab meat
only 1 jar  of Tomato since we are both not big fans and 1 onion. 
So when making this we were in mid conversation I forgot to add the wine and it still tasted amazing. Everything else I used. Added more Garlic powder and minced garlic. Took about 45 mins to make and we did it together. Great way to get both in the kitchen. Like I said Served 4 so we put it in tubberware and we both had lunch for the next day! Will make again for sure. By The way It looked as amazing as it tasted. When I served it I was almost dying to take a picture but didnt want to look like a total dork.

It's not a bad base.  I used seafood stock and a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, as well as mussels instead of clams.  Also, I used fresh crab that I had cracked, and put in the stew.  I would HIGHLY suggest using red wine instead of white.  We used white, and it made the sauce so sour, we had to simmer it for an extra two hours as well as add red wine.

Very good recipe. Made it just the other day and it was great. Now, that said, I listened to some of the other reviewers (slightly). Split the butter 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil (the flavor butter adds is important, as any cook will tell you). I added more garlic (6 cloves), kept the water and used the wine. I added the seafood in the order suggested in another review, and instead of 2 cans of stewed tomatoes, I added 1 can and 1 box of Pomi chopped tomato.  

Beyond that, make sure, of course, to taste both before and after you add the fish for seasoning. Had to add a bit of salt and pepper but, when it was all said and done, everyone seemed to enjoy it.

(Note, the red pepper would have been added, but having small children we kept it out and let guests add it on their own -- most added it and consequently, I'll probably add it in the future while cooking.)

I loved this recipe.  I used a 28-ounce can of whole tomatoes that I just squeezed into the stockpot.  I also use a bit more seasoning than is called for, especially the garlic.  Best of all, before adding the Bay Leaf (or fish, of course), I emulsified the sauce.  Absolutely Yummy and Not Intimidating at all!

I served this soup last night at our wine club. (We were tasting Pinot Gris and Pinot Noir) It was the hit of the night! Highly recommend this recipe. I did follow the suggestions though about not as much water, and the addition of the Red Chili Flakes.. Do not hesistate to make this recipe.

This was an OMG recipe! The only thing I did differently from the recipe was substitute half of the butter with olive oil. And I used canned lump crabmeat because I ran out of money! I also cut the recipe in half and it was still fabuloso.

Holy Cow! Winner winner seafood dinner. I did have to add some cayenne pepper for some heat, a small can of tomato paste, a little more of the basil, oregano and thyme. Also salt and pepper were needed.  The family LOVES this and it's very easy to make.

Great recipe, thanks. To make it healthy, I don't put any butter, just olive oil. It will be thick enough. As some people suggested, I put less water or no water, I just use water from canned tomatoes. If you are on a budget, you can always do a cheaper version of this soup. Obviously it won't be a true cioppino, but true one requires a lot of expensive seafood. I often use some of those not very expensive seafood mixes from Costco, add some shrimp and couple of scallops and some fish and voila.... I do pay attention to the spices though. That is what makes the soup taste good. Even cheaper version will taste good and if you are on a budget, you can still eat sort of Cioppino as often as you want. Plus, it's super healthy

This is so good and 5 star restaurant worthy. Costco has had bags of mixed seafood for the past few months. Since there are just two of us, we use half the bag and freeze the rest for the next time we make this. We have added the fish in the past, but it just broke into pieces and you couldn't really taste the difference. Everything else we keep the same, only changing the quantity. This is so easy to make and looks so impressive! Make sure you have a loaf of fresh bread to sop up the juice.

EXCELLENT! I loved this and so did everyone else that I served on Christmas Eve. It is easier to make than it looks. :) I doubled up on clams and took out the mussels since we love clams. The cod was a perfect addition.

I used a bag of Costco frozen shellfish-mussels, shrimp, scallops and calamari. It was about 2.5 pounds, so I cut the other ingredients in half. Added a little extra chicken stock and a couple of tablespoons of oyster sauce instead of water.  Also added a good deal of salt and pepper. This ate much better with a spoon as a soup than with a fork. I'm low carb, so I didn't use bread to sop up the sauce so I got a lot more of the flavor with a spoon. Turned out great.

I only used shrimp and scallops in this because that is what I had. I am still giving 5 stars because the broth was so yummy and I am sure with the addition of the other 'fish' it would be just as good.

I remember having Cioppino that my Italian MIL made at Christmas eve dinner about 10 years ago and I've often thought about making it since then. Well, I finally got around to it, and boy am I glad I went with this recipe.  It is fabulous, delicious and easy! And it's even better the next day when the broth gets flavored with all the wonderful seafood.  I did make a few minor adjustments for our family: I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup olive oil (I think next time I may try to decrease that to 1/4 cup as well and see how it turns out).  Also, because we don't drink, use or keep wine I replaced it with broth. I replaced the 1 cup of water with broth as well.  The stew was so flavorful! We sopped it up with a fresh from the bakery Italian loaf. I'll definitely be making this through out the winter months!

This was amazing!  So easy and so flavorful.  This is definitely a keeper!  I made a few changes based on other reviews and what I had available - Doubled the minced garlic, used only 1 can chicken broth + 1 bottle of clam juice, used all fresh herbs from my garden (so tripled them, except for the parsley), and did not use any crab meat or cod.  To make things even easier, for the seafood needed, I used 1 frozen mixed bag of seafood from Trader Joe's + frozen mussels and 1 can of clams from Ralphs.  So easy!

My husband made this for me on my Birthday, WOW was it great. He added more garlic and used my immerson blender on the broth. It turned out wonderful! And it was easy enough for someone that doesn't cook.

Awesome!  My first try at this dish.  I made it as written, except I added a bell pepper just because I was in the mood.  Would have been fine without it too.

I only add a can of diced tomatoes and use two fresh tomatoes to replace the other can of tomatoes since I feel the soup taste too salty already.  I cut the butter to about two tbsp instead of 3/4 cups for healthier alternative.  The soup taste very good, and my sister-in-law kept telling me how good the soup taste even though she's not a big seafood fan.  This dish will be one of my favorite from Allrecipes.com.

This was SOOOOO darn good!!! We did a "mussels cioppino" version, and it was so delish. I didn't use all of that butter, for a healthier version; only used about 1-2 tbsp of butter and a little less than 1/4 cup vegetable oil. Instead of serving the cioppino w/ warm crusty bread, I made AR's Garlic Croutons, and sprinkled some ontop of the stew. Also, an extra addition was some grated fresh parmesan cheese ontop, and a little fresh parsley for garnish. Honestly, you will NOT regret making this stew. If I could give it more than a 5, I really really would!!  Thank you Star Pooley! :)

I use lots of clam juice in place of water and chicken broth.  It adds so much more flavor to the dish.  I make this often as a special treat for my boyfriend and I.  Don't forget some good sourdough bread for dipping!

I am not much of a cook. This recipe made me look like a hero! My wife is not particularly inclined towards seafood and my son and daughter are fans of fast food. I decided to try my hand at this recipe, not deviating or adding to it. It was awesome! Everyone loved it! This is the sort of gem that makes you want to try something new!

This is great! I halved the recipe & made a few minor adjustments to the broth: I increased the wine and omitted the water, plus I added crushed red pepper flakes & cayenne. I also used petite diced tomatoes so I didn't have to break them up. I let the broth simmer for a couple of hours. About 10-15 minutes before serving I added clams first, then a few minutes later a seafood medley (calamari, shrimp, scallops), more shrimp & langoustine tails. It was delicious! I can't wait to make it for company - thanks Star!

This is an amazing and perfect recipe.  Didn't change a thing.  It is quite expensive to make and I'd consider it a "special occasion" meal, but it's so delicious!

LOVED THIS SOUP!  I did leave some things out and made this will all Trader Joe ingredients - a bag of Frozen Seafood Medley, a package of frozen cod and a box of their frozen Steamer Clams.  I just threw it all in and it was wonderful and so easy!! I have filled my freezer wtih the above items so we can have this once a week!

We prepared and served this for our daughter's birthday party.  Everyone loved it!  We used more clams than called for and used tomatoe slices for larger pieces and body and it came out great.  Added the fish in the end as others suggested and it held together well.  We will add more spices next time though, probably the Old Bay Seasoning for seafood.

Great recipe! The fish and shell fish will over cook, if you cook them 5 to 7 minutes. I cooked mine for about 3.5 mins, and it came out perfect.

This was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, with the exception of adding some red pepper flakes. I did however add something from a recipe on the food network. I took sliced sour dough bread and basted them with olive oil on both sides, salt and peppered them and grilled them on a grill pan til they were nice and golden brown. then i spread anchovy butter on one side (5 tbs softened unsalted butter, 1 tbs anchovy paste). This really helped to make the dish. It gave it that extra kick to really move it up to the professional level. Its an expensive meal, so I may look into using frozen seafood for cheaper alternatives, but as is, you can't beat it.

This is a great, traditional Cioppino recipe.  I disagree with the other reviewers in their recommendation of fish stock, or any other ingredients to try to make the dish richer.  This simple "fisherman's stew" is exactly what it is supposed to be:  basic, buttery from the different seafoods, simple, and true to the basic principles of the dish - lots of seafood, good seasonings, basic tomato, wine, chicken broth, and limited other ingredients; no frills or whistles.  Perfect served with some country or sourdough bread, sliced, buttered, and lightly toasted, and then rubbed with a half of a garlic clove.  And wonderful with a nice glass of wine.

What an awesome recipe. I made an inexpensive version, a small handful of mini scallops, 8 medium shrimp, a bunch of mussels, a filet of basa cut up into about half the recipe for broth. We will have it often! Thank you!

Really, really good.  You do need a reallllllly big pot for this!  I made it exactly as is, except without the scallops and water -- I am glad I didn't add the water, because this sauce is deee-licious!  My cod fell apart, so next time I will leave it in big hunks instead of small pieces. Thank you for a great recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly - and it was WONDERFUL!   The 3 or 4 star ratings are written by people who altered the original recipe. Make this one as it is written, and you won't be dissappointed!   My entire family came back for 2nd's and 3rd's - even my fussy 8 year old. I will make this recipe for guests in the future.   ONE NOTE - I used "in shell" snow crab legs. One one hand, cooking the crab with the shell on adds more flavor to the broth. BUT, it was really messy to eat because the broth is all over the shell when you're trying to crack it. I think next time I may use lump crab meat... maybe.

Followed the other reviewers advice, and it came out incredible. Didnt use water, just more wine, added the clams and mussels first, then all the other stuff. We had a sweet batard from Semifreddies bakery here in SF and it was perfect.

I made this last night....Outstanding!!! I cut the recipe in half because only two people were eating it. I added clam juice instead of water, extra garlic, red pepper and fire roasted tomatoes. Everything else i made exactly by the recipe. This one is a keeper!!!

Yum, Yum!  This was very good.  This is on the expensive side though.  I had to make this on a budget.  I had to use an inexpensive wine but wish I used a better quality.  My fault.  I used all the seafood except my store was out of bay scallops - So I had to buy the big ones and cut them each into 4 pieces.  This came out very good. It is a very pretty dish, with a nice presentation. Everyone loved it.  The only thing I would do differently next time is select a better wine.  It's true what they say don't cook with a wine you wouldn't drink.

A great base recipe.  I made it as-is the first time around and it was very good.  This time, I followed bits of advice from others - used some clam juice, extra garlic, simmered for a few hours, replaced water with wine, made the broth with a bit more tomato.  I liked it with these adjustments even more.  Next time, I'll try it with red pepper flakes as some have suggested (forgot this time).  Also, I've decided to use only shell fishes (clams, mussels, shrimp, crab, etc) - my kids don't like white fish as it tends to be too "fishy" for them.  Served this with a loaf of sour dough and a Caesar salad.

OMG This was wonderful!  I pretty much followed the directions exactly except:  I added a small bunch of chopped basil rather than dried I added three small cans of Hunt Tomato Sauce I added one can of chopped clams w/broth I added more clams, mussels and shrimp I did not add fish or crab  I first added the clams and mussels and let them cook until opened.  Then I added the scallops and shrimp at the last minute.  The reason I added three small cans of tomato sauce is because my brother, Chris, wanted it served over linguini.  It was his birthday and I was excited about preparing this for him.  Don't add salt.  I added a pinch and it really didn't need it.  This was a wonderfully easy and tasty dish to prepare.  I will definitely make it again and again.  Thank you for sharing it with us.  MC

I am a Portuguese citizen living in the USA for more than 1 year now and when I first saw this dish I knew I had to do it. This is a Portuguese dish called "Caldeirada". I did this recipe yesterday and me and my husband (he's Portuguese too) we loved it! I'll do it again, and again and again... It's not cheap though..but it's worth it.

This recipe was fantastic!  I made it for m by fiancee and I for New Year's Eve.  I cut the recipe down for just the two of us: 10 clams,16 mussels, 1/4 lb scallops, 1/2 lb of shrimp, 1/2 lb of cod and we left out the crab because of sketchy pickings at the grocery store.  It was such an easy meal but made me feel like a world class chef. An excellent start to 2009!

Absolutely delicious!! This was a hit! Everyone loved the fact that the broth was lighter than a traditional Cioppino base, with less of the traditional tomato sauce consistancy. This is a flavor packed dish....I wouldn't change a thing...perfect as is!

Good stuff. I also did like the others and revised the order of which i cooked the shellfish. I added some wild rice for carbs also added some crushed red pepper for a nice kick. Threw in just a little tiny bit of lemon juice, lots of wine, no water, no salt, lots of fresh ground pepper. delicious! i personally think there was too much fat, even after i substituted olive oil for butter I think i will use less olive oil next time. Thanks!

This is by far the best cioppino recipe I've tried.  I modified it a little to please my very picky family.  I followed the recipe to the t, but I scooped out a lot of the seasoning from the broth because I am don't care for whole pieces of onions.  I was left with a very pleasing aroma in the broth without the whole onions.  I made 3 times the amount of the recipe (I had to feed about 50 people) and by the end of the evening, nothing was left and they all wanted the recipe.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This is really fantastic soup. You can mix and match the seafoods too based on what's available and what's cheap! I end up using flash-frozen shrimp most of the time because it tastes great when it's thawed into the soup and all of the juices from the shrimp melt into the soup. My mom is allergic to shellfish, so we make a version just for her with only fish. The base is the same, just with different seafood added at the end. Very versatile and always a crowd-pleaser!

It was really tasty, but I would use diced tomatoes next time, the stewed tomatoes are too chucky.  Also, the next day I ate it on a tostada shell like ceviche with a little lime and tapatio instead of noodles. Yummy!

I made a few adjustments to this soup, as I was looking for more of a bouillabaisse.  I added some fennel seed (1/4 tsp) and some Pernod instead of the white wine.  I also added a pinch of saffron and used the seafood I had (mussels, seabass, calamari, shrimp & scallops.)  I served this with garlic rubbed toast with rouille (spicy mayo) which made the dish.  I did not have clam juice as some of the other reviewers noted so I added some Knorr seafood base.  This was truly excellent, I really loved it.  I know I did not really make the recipe as noted, but thought it made an excellent base to do with whatever you like, and I am sure it would also be excellent as written.  Thanks!

this was absolutely great.  although i just used the seafood i had on hand (frozen tilapia, shrimp and squid, canned minced clams and canned crab) it still came out wonder.  i can't imagine it being any better with fresh ingredients, but i am sure it would be. i also didn't use all of the cilantro. just added a little at the end.

This was fabulous!  Added one can of crushed tomatoes, clams and clam juice and some fresh calamari.  Prepared  some king crab legs to serve along side rather than adding crabmeat to the dish. Used about 2 cups of chardonnay.  Served with big hunks of crusty french bread for dipping!   This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

I give this dish 4 stars.  I'll tell you why.  It tastes too much like another soup that I love which is called Jackie's Sausage Soup.  Obviously this dish is traditional so I'm guessing "Jackie" came up with hers after, however, after trying this dish second, I would suggest adding flour to the water before pouring so that the broth is thicker.  I think that would have helped quite a bit.

Very good!  My family loved this, my Grandmother especially was so excited over it and exclaimed "I've gone 86 years and have never had anything like this!"  It was too cute.  

Great dish for a crowd.

A BIG WOW!! It's the first time I made this and it turned out very tasty and easy! I followed one of the reviewers' suggestion by using 2 cans of stewed tomatoes. I also added a tiny bit of salt as it was a little bland to me. I LOVE IT!!! DELICIOUS!!

Top notch dish with tons of flavor. I added mushrooms and zucchini to the recipe and really liked the outcome. Aside from being a $50.00 pot of seafood it’s a must try.

This is a fantastic receipe.  We have made it our annual winter camping trip favorite, 5 years in a row now.  We've tweeked it a bit with different fish choices, very good with everything we've tried.  More wine less water, clam juice, more tomatoes, less butter it all works well.  Thank You, Star for posting a great receipe that is loved by as many as 35 in our group.

This recipe is fantastic.  The only suggestions I would make is to use Sherry and tomato paste, which adds a hearty rich flavor to the broth and gives it a nice red coloring.

Fantastic!! This got a 10out of 5 stars. I tried making it for one, but it didn't seem like enough liquid. So I used the whole can of tomatoes and the whole can of broth. I just sprinkled more herbs in by eye to match the extra liquid. I also added a dash of kosher salt. Didn't stick real close on the ounces of seafood, just too hard. So I added like 2 mussels, 3 clams, 4 shrimp, 3 scallops cut up, no crab, but added cod. I used less wine (just ran out and didn't want to open another bottle for a Tbs. Used the water. Not expensive as others thought , I guess since it was only a serving for two (maybe $10 or so). He still can't stop raving about it. These were the comments I got...Rich but not overdone or too much. Perfect balance. Plan on making this for the in laws. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Yes, this recipe is expensive, but every mouthful is worth every penny. I added extra tomatoes as some suggested and it created too much broth-tasted wonderful though. I suggest sticking to the recipe for all ingredients. We loved it! Will absolutely make again.
**add clam juice for water and some garlic. 
Simmer at least 30 minutes or more before adding seafood.

BRILLIANT!!!! ok, first off, didn't have the mussels on hand, nor the cod, subsituted with tilapia.  No Matter, excellent.  After reading the other reviews, and seeing exactly how pricey this dish can be, I used canned clams.  I also didn't have any thyme on my hands, but it didn't matter, it was fantastic.  I halved the recipe, but I doubled up on the stewed tomatoes, and added home made chicken stock. I think that was an important factor.  I also used crab legs, no bay scallops available, but this dish is so hearty, if you omit a couple of the seafood fare, it won't matter.  My dinner guests raved, easy to make, fun to make as a meal, and sure to please.  Pricey, but WORTH IT!

A costly dish to make what with all of that fresh seafood, but worth it. Tasted something very similar in Italy last summer, or otherwise it is close to the French version, Bouillabaise. Lots of bread soaks up this broth, served this to my boyfriend and his family; even his younger sisters who are picky eaters liked it! Will be making this one again.

Scott is the Seafood King. I just realized that I also rated his clams and garlic which was superb as well. 

I don't think you can go wrong with any little changes you make to this one. I used only shrimp, scallops and clams. I also substituted chicken broth for seafood stock and didn't use a bay leaf (just forgot to add it). I put in a ton of fresh basil and an extra can of tomatoes (personal preference). There were 6 of us and everyone agreed that it was sensational. Thank you Scott. Now I am going to see what other recipes you have on All Recipes.

Simple and amazing. My guests were very impressed and I will definitely make it again. I left out the crab that I bought just because the stew already seemed so rich and hearty, and it was fine. There's enough in here that you can leave out one of the seafood ingredients for whatever reason and still get satisfying results.

Wonderful!  Made this for Christmas Eve, used homeade chicken broth, Alaskan King Crab legs, New Zealand mussells, clams, scallops, shrimp, extra garlic and red pepper flakes.  Cook soup for 3 hours and then turned it off.  When we were ready for dinner brought it back to a boil and added Seafood in layers.  Added a white fish and the end and will leave that out next time.  (Broke apart and wasnt very fresh tasting)  I was shocked that my 11 and 7 year olds went back for seconds and thirds.
Thank you for our new Christmas Eve tradition!!

I made this for a dinner party and got absolutely rave reviews.  I live in Sydney, Australia so I have access to some of the freshest seafood in the world.  The only change I made was to swap out the chicken broth with my own stock which I made out of shrimp casings that I had saved in my freezer over the months.  I boiled them in a stock point then reduced it down.  If you don't mind the smell it makes the cioppino broth fabulous.  My dinner guests said it was very "lush", (Ozzie term for incredible, fabulous etc).

We loved this recipe! It was my turn to pick a dish to cook with my new boyfriend. It was such a fun and easy dish to make together. We had plenty of time to talk and have a glass of wine without having to run around worrying about timing dishes etc..I am new to cooking and this tasted like a gourmet dish. My boyfriend LOVED it - it had tons of flavour and the best part is that this dish is healthy (both of us are fairly health consious people). We are having a dinner party this weekend and he INSISTS that we make this...EXCELLENT!

Yummy.  Substituted salmon for the cod and didn't use the mussels due to personal preference.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Hubby asked to please make it more than once a year (I'm always making new stuff from this website).

WOW! I made this for dinner last night and we loved it. I doubled the garlic, added 3/4t. red pepper flakes, 1/4t. sugar and sub. clam broth for water. Even better the next day when I had some for breakfast!

I used the basic broth of this recipe to make my own version of 'poorman's cioppino' and it came out great!  I used a  one pound bag of frozen seafood mix with octopus, cuttlefish, squid, shrimp, mussles and clams,(about $4.00 at the pac-n-save type grocery store.) some leftover mahi-mahi and rice pilaf, and added some new red potatoes.  All the taste, but a fraction of the cost.  I would make it with the expensive ingredients if I was having a dinner party.  But this was a great, inexpensive version.

I'm always looking for the BEST of the BEST recipes to serve. This is one I'm adding to the list. I did not use mussels as I do not care for them. Other then that I did it the same. Not only does this taste great it also looks very pretty. 
It is a meal in itself!!

I like seafood, but this was waaaayyyy to fishy for me.  My boyfriend liked it, he went back for seconds.  I scaled it down to 4 servings and substituted Alaskan Cod, Olive oil, and cilantro.  I won't make this again.  It wasn't on the cheap side and the taste was just not for me.

I made this for my husband and I for New Year's last year.  I cut the recipe in half and we ate all of it - DELICIOUS!  I am going to make it again this year when my in-laws are in town and I'm sure it will be just as wonderful.  This time I'll make the whole recipe and I'm taking some of the reviews into consideration (adding clam juice, more garlic, calamari, etc.).  Thanks for sharing a fabulous recipe!

I enjoy shrimp and crab, the rest is just ok.  Made this for my in-laws who love seafood; WE devoured it!  I pretty much followed all the tidbits of advise, and it was excellent!!  Am making it this weekend for my best friends, have already printed the recipe for them, know they will want it!  Thanks, Star, for sharing, keep them coming!

This is amazing and easy. I cooked it for a group of friends and they literally gave me a round of applause. I am back on the site today so I can send the recipe to everyone. Also, if there aren't all of the right types of fish at the store, you can substitute. (I used salmon and shark.)

I was surprised how delicious just the broth was, but the whole stew is just great!  A must if you like good seasonings or seafood, or both.  I substituted parsley with cilantro, and a little extra of it.  Delicious!!

Amazing! Better than 5 stars! Made for a party of 9 adults and doubled the recipe which was way too much but everyone took home leftovers so they were happy. I had to use a huge canning pot to fit it all in. I used frozen loganstino defrosted in lieu of crab,  pre frozen thawed calamari (which next time I'll leave out altogether),  and frozen sea scallops thawed. Nobody noticed and it didn't impact the dish at all. Timing is important here and I let the mussels and clams start to open first before adding longastino, shrimp and cod. If you prep everything in advance this takes very little time to cook and is ready quickly. Very impressive dish! Served with crusty bread and it was amazing. Was told this was the best thing I've ever made :)

I was hesitant to make this since one of my kids does not like seafood and another is a hit and miss seafood person.  I was amazed because the child that does not like seafood had THREE bowls of this.  The other had two!  In fact out of 5 people only one had one bowl (it was a pretty full first bowl though).  The changes I made: 2 1/2 cups of white wine, no water; a 32 oz jar of pasta sauce instead of the other tomatoes; added 2 TBSP Old Bay Seasoning, I did not have fresh parsley so I added 8 TBSP dried parsley, and sauted scallops in 1 TBSP butter and then used that butter to saute clams.  Since I used frozen mussels that said it's best to use from frozen, I followed its directions and microwaved them then dumped the mussels and half the sauce in the bag in the soup.  I used frozen shrimp and clams (thaw before adding).  Followed the directions for thawing shrimp and clams.   Added seafood in this order: clams (after I sauted them and threw out any that did not open), mussels, shrimp, scallops (after sauted) and then 2 inch chunks of fish.

Absolutely fabulous.  I made a few changes.  I added more butter, used two cloves of garlic, a full cup of sweet onions and replaced the water with bottled clam juice.  I also added the full can of stewed tomatoes.  I was so afraid it wouldn't come out right, and, this was an expensive meal.  Well, it was so much better than the Cioppino at our most expensive local Italian restaurant!! I will make this many times in the years to come.  What a treat!  A friend and I really "pigged out" and ate enough for four.  Many many thanks for posting this.

This is a  very enjoyable dinner! I have been making this delicious and  easy recipe for several years now.  It's a simple one pot meal that would impress any guest! All that is needed is come crusty bread and a salad! Over the years I have used the many suggestions  of other reviewers.  I like to dissolve anchovies in the oil and garlic and add clam juice as well. My only regret is our budget doesn't allow us to enjoy this as often as we like! Thanks Star!

It was excellent. Of course I did a few changes based on others. I used only about 1 tablespoon butter and then olive oil instead. I slowly cooked the onions down without the parsley and garlic for about 30mins. Then added the two other for only about 5 mins. Ended up using 1 14 oz and 1 28 oz diced tomatoes in a can and then 1 1/2 14oz cans of tomato sauce. Twice as much garlic. No water and 2 1/2 cups wine. Ended up using about 4 cups of homemade chicken broth. I had no oregano so I substituted Italian spices. Also had no crab. 
I simmered the soup before the addition of the fish/stuff for about 2 hours on low. If you don't simmer then you are going to get a very strong wine taste/smell. Then added the clams/mussels for 5 mins and then the rest for about 5 mins. So so good. Has some great sourdough bread to go with it.

Awesome recipe. It can be a pricey meal when you add up all the fresh seafood, but definitely worth it! I'm a little embarrassed to say my boyfriend and I ate the whole thing in one sitting! I know, I know... Sinful! But just goes to show you how good it is :)

I used red wine, omitted the water, and added clam juice as suggested by others-  Only thing I would do differently next time is perhaps add more tomatoes to thicken it a bit.  I may also try making the broth the day before and simmering longer since it actually tasted more rich the next day.

I, too, took advice from other reviewers. Omitted water, added clam juice. I added red and white wine, and subbed chopped tomatoes for stewed. Simmered for 1 1/2 hours before adding seafood. So delicious!

I have made this twice now highly recommend this recipe for all you foodies out there! Serve with Large Caesar Salad, and Asiago cheese bread... Mangia!

A few changes I made: Use Olive Oil instead of butter, Use a (Cab) Red Wine vs a White Wine, and add 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper. Crab meat I use Dungeness Crab.  Serve topped with fresh Parmesan Cheese! Its even more fantastic the next day. It makes a LOT.  Store in in the same pot and put in the fridge covered. Heat it up and eat some for lunch or dinner the next night! So GOOD!

Nice and easy. I added seafood in batches for diff cooking times. There is another recipe that has chili powder, next time I suggest adding that fora more southern flare.

Fantastic! First I served it as a soup and it was wonderful. I had leftovers so my husband added cream, some tomato paste.  Waited for it to thicken and served over pasta. It turned into the most amazing fish Alfredo. It was very rich but delicious. Thank you for a great recipe!

Delish and so easy to make! I served this to a family of discerning Italians this Christmas eve, and everyone was so impressed :) I honestly didn't expect this to turn out so delicious, but it did. I used butter and olive oil, a LOT of white wine, san marzano tomatoes, cod, coquels, mussles, shrimp, scallops.

After looking at the other reviews, I also substituted olive oil for butter, and used store bought fish stock instead of water. I used salmon. My family loved it!

I made this for a party and it turned out pretty good.  I used salmon, clams, mussels, canned crab, and large shrimp.  It was missing something (spice of some kind) to make it 5 stars.  Remember the fish and shellfish cook quickly, so don't leave the heat on for very long.  I will make this again.

Fabulous! We truly enjoyed this soup.  I read other reviews and used all clam juice and no water, and added a bit more wine.  I also used all stewed tomoatoes because that was all I had,and added one can of tomato sauce, as we like the extra tomato-y broths.  The crusty bread was a great side for soaking up the delicious broth.  I will make this again and again!  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely delicious - and easy to make.  I made it for two, so our fish monger was a bit perplexed as I asked for small quantities of such a variety of seafood.  It was well worth it and I'll definitely make it again soon.

I made this the other night for dinner and it turned out amazing!  I followed advice from a few others and added clam juice, more tomatoes, more wine, and a bit more chicken broth.  It smelled fabulous and looked as impressive as it tasted.  YUM!!  I will definitely make this again!

This was great even with the extensive modifications I did to accommodate what I had available.  I used a 1 lb bag of medium shrimp with tails off plus a 1 lb mixed bag that included scallops, caramari and shrimp from Trader Joes.  I left out the mussels, clams and cod.  I added some extra canned crab, used dried parsley instead of fresh and left out the bay leaves.  It was truly delicious.

This was very good. I added kalamata olives and a glob of anchovy paste. I also used clam juice and roasted stewed tomatoes. I personally am not a huge fan of having whole shells in my stew/cioppino, so I left out the mussels and clams(it also eased up on the price a bit). Next time, I may try adding canned clams. I also had a bit of time, so I simmered the sauce for a couple of hours. This is a keeper!

Have made this several times and it is always a hit.  I always cut the butter in half, add a whole bottle of wine and a bag of langostino lobster tails. Also have found that using diver scallops cut in half instead of bay scallops keep them from getting chewy.

When they say 12 servings, believe it. I used 1 can (14.5 oz) stewed tomatoes and 14 oz's crushed tomato . I have a vegetarian in the house so I used 2 cups of fish stock instead of chicken broth. I also used i cup of clam juice instead of water. It is delicious and got rave reviews from a picky crowd.

This is the best soup I've ever made. If you can't find all of the fish you can leave out the ones you can't get and this soup is still very good. I used the canned crab meat but I didn't think it added anything so I'll probably leave it out next time.
I've only made this soup once because its very expensive with all of the seafood since I don't live on the coast. But it was very worth it!

This is such an awesome recipe, I cooked this for a friend of mine's family and they raved about it! I didn't go exactly by the recipe, but simply got all the ingredients together and just added more or less on some of things. I liked mussels but never though I'd eat clams from the shell but did and loved it! I also loved how this wasn't such a tomato-y broth as the only kind of tomato-y broth with seafood I like is Manhattan Clam chowder. Was sooo delicious and is a definite keeper!

I made this dish for my family one night and it was by fa one of the most delicious dishes I have ever made. Besides the wait, it was fairly easy to make. i omitted the water and used broth and extra wine instead. We are big seafood fans, but i was a little hesitant about the some of the ingredients, given my picky children. But both of my children, 6 and 9, loved it. It was great!

WOW this was amazing!  I used fresh Parsley, Basil and Oregano and probably used more than what was required.  I doubled the garlic and slightly increased the amount of wine.  I used canned clams and crab and it turned out wonderful.  I can't wait to make this again for my extended family.  My 6 year old son even loved this recipe.

An easy preparation for a great dish.  The tomato/broth combination is delicious.  I used a bag of frozen seafood medley which was a letdown (not top quality, but economical)...next time I will just wait for a really good seafood sale before I make this.  It would be fabulous even with only shrimp and scallops, but I like the idea of all the varieties of seafood together.

Oh, wow.  Yum. Following some suggestions, I did the following:  used mostly olive oil instead of butter, used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of water, and I used founder instead of cod.  I put in the clams first, and after they started to open, put in everything else, lastly the fish that I had cut into bite size pieces.  I cut everything in about 1/2, and it was perfect for 5 people.  Finally, can't say enough about fresh ingredients, everything was fresh and wonderful.

Awesome recipe. I've never haed Cioppino before but was always curious about what it tasted like. So this was a first for me and my family. I was a bit reluctant to make as it seemed difficult ,but having made GUMBO before this was a whole lot easier. This is wonderful . The basil and thyme and oregano give it a nice aromatic flavor (the fresher the spices the better) We ate it like a soup for the first bowl and then used bread to dip on our 2nd bowl. Yummy. This is definitely a keeper and very simple . Note this recipe serves 13 so adjust it to fit your family size.

This is INCREDIBLE!!! I really liked adding the bottle of clam juice, but only because I'm a hardcore seafood fan. It's expensive to make, but it makes a HUGE pot!

I made this Valentine's Day.  It was wonderful.  Everyone raved!!!  I did add 1 tablespoon more of garlic, used clam juice instead of water, canned whole baby clams instead of fresh and a pinch of crushed red pepper.  I also allowed the broth to simmer for 30-40 minutes before adding any of the seafood. It was WONDERFUL!!! WONDERFUL!!! WONDERFUL!!!

This was a terrific recipe.  I used olive oil instead of butter and substituted some of the chicken broth with clam juice.  Delicious!

Really good!  Used clams, shrimp, scallops, and crab.  Make sure to wait until your clams open before putting in bay scallops . . . I didn't and just added the shrimp/scallops after five minutes of the clams cooking, and the scallops were overcooked by the time the clams opened.  But, the shrimp were cooked perfectly.  I think it is a timing thing that I'll learn with more experience with this recipe, and I will definitely be trying it again! I also just added the crab right before serving since it was cooked and it heated right up and was delicious.  Served it with crusty whole wheat bread.

This dish was a HUGE HIT at my Christmas Feast for 18!  I calculated the recipe using 25 servings and then added calamari and Lobster tails (about 3.5 lbs. for my recipe cut up into bite sized pieces.). I did let the broth simmer for a little longer then stated....probably about 90 min. Seafood added in this order:  clams, mussels, lobster, shrimp, calamari, then scallops.  Once the scallops were done I removed from the heat.  It was absolutely PHENOMENAL and this will be a yearly tradition in our family.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

This is a great foundation recipe for an even greater soup. I used many people's advice on adding clam juice instead of water and used petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed. I also took out the cod (since many complained about it falling apart) and added squid rings and bodies. I had a heck of a time finding clams and mussels, so ended up using shell-less clams and had to make do without the mussels (the presentation was very nice but would have been so much better if there were shells from the clams and mussels). Anyway, this recipe is a good start but feel free to experiment on your own. Add and substitute your own shellfish and ingredients to your liking and make it your very own cioppino this way.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it.  I took some suggestions from others: added more garlic, added 1 large can of crushed tomatoes & 1 14.5 oz can of stewed tomatoes, and left out the water.  I also let the broth simmer for 1.5 hrs rather than 30 min.  Next time I will add some red chili flakes for some kick.  This is a fabulous dish!

I just made a Cioppino from a recipe given out by a restaurant here in Hawaii and it said to cook the seasoned seafood in very hot oil so it is browned then serve it on top of the soup sprinkled with herbs. That tasted and looked much better than the usual method. Next time I'm going to try adding lemon zest and maybe some anchovy or Worcestershire sauce. Also saw a great seasoning mix of fennel, rosemary and oregano ground in a 'herb-designated coffee grinder' (another good idea!). I think this is going to be my new craze - coming up with my perfect Cioppino! I serve it over brown rice pasta to make a hearty wheat-free meal.

Wicked Good!!! One of my favorites that I have tried from this website.  I added a little more garlic and reduced the chicken broth before adding the tomatos.  I also used a 32 oz can of tomatoes instead of 14oz and added some red pepper flakes because I like spice. made some aborio rice to go with it and it was delicious.

I took some review suggestions.  I let it simmer for about 45 minutes before adding the seafood.  I used an undrained can of diced tomatoes & no water.  Finally, I added fresh spinach.  It was great!!!

A great aroma! I actually had to leave half way while cooking so I sauteed the onions and threw everything else in the crockpot on low to simmer for about 2 hours.  When I came back, it smelled delicious! Next time I may used tomato paste instead of crushed tomatoes since I thought the soup was too watery.

Outstanding!  My Hubby and I made this for a Valentine's Day Dinner.  Better than anything we could have gotten at a restaurant.  Only changes we made were to add some red pepper flakes to Step 1 and to add cod after the shells of the clams start to open.  Next time, will add more red pepper flakes, and since the frozen shrimp we added were already cooked, would have either not thawed them when added, or wait until the clams were opened and add with the fish.  Taste was absolutely outstanding!

So I was going to give this 4 stars when I first came on to rate it, but decided to go put the leftovers in the fridge while my computer started up. I took one last spoon full before I packaged it up and WOW! The only flaw I'd felt before was that I wished the broth had a bit more flavor to it. Apparently letting it sit for a bit, though, is all it needed! The flavor was SO much better after it rested. My only suggestion to others is to add a jar of clam juice to the broth and be sure to wash the clams and mussles well. I only washed them twice and still had grit.

This was a wonderful recipe, and easy to prepare.  I think we spent around $40 for all the seafood, including king crab claws, which seemed like a bargain since we would pay that much for each dish in a restaurant.  The sauce is great for sopping up with garlic bread.

This dish was excellent. I did not have clams or oysters so I put more Scallops, cod and Shrimp and it was just fine. Next time I will try not to use as much butter (It is quite a lot).

Thought it was great!  Definitely worth the time and effort.  I did leave out the mussels, and used a bit more scallops.  Tons of seafood in every bite.

Awesome recipe.  Wonderful flavors.  I added some crushed red pepper to spice it up and substituted clam juice instead of water.  Simmered for an hour.  This is a great recipe.  Will be making it again definitely.

I used frozen shrimp and scallops, imitation crab meat (it did fall apart but still tasted good), canned clams in clam juice and rice. This was so delicious.  I added a can of tomato paste because to me the added clam juice tasted a little fishy. But overall this was so delicous, I will defintely make this again.

This is a great recipe! I used all fresh ingedients and only made a few alterations. I didn`t use chicken stock but added a few more spices for taste. I also used a little bit mor wine. I added the seafood seperately and then let simmer on low heat for a little while so the different flavors could mingle together. I also used cubed swordfish instead of cod.

Wow- delicious!! I made it with sea scallops (cut up), frozen raw shrimp, and pollock. (The mussels I bought had not read that they should open up after soaking for 1/2 hour, so I will do something with them tomorrow.) I will make this again; I may try clam juice, as it seems like it would add a lot of flavor.

This was really good, and the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because there is another recipe for Cioppino (from a cooking magazine) that I prefer.  The only change I made was to double the clams and omit the mussels. I didn't have clam juice, but I agree with other reviewers that it should be subbed for the water. Thanks for the recipe, good stuff!

I took the recommendations from some of the reviews including cutting the salt by half and replacing water with 1 can of tomatoes sauce. Also, I don't have can stewed tomatoes but replaced that with fresh tomatoes. It tastes so good particularly the next day. Instead of bread, we ate it with rice. It's a pricey dish but will definitely make it again when we have friends coming over.

I cannot stress how AMAZING this recipe is-- and, most importantly, it's nearly fool proof. (I forgot to add the tomatos until almost the very end and it STILL turned out amazing.) My significant other and I both were amazed at how good it tasted-- and we are on a budget, so we used entirely frozen seafood and/or grocery store medleys. With fresh seafood, it's probably even better (although I can barely comprehend that being possible). The ONLY change I made is adding red pepper flakes to the stock-- it gave it a great extra kick and really rounded it out. 

For seafood lovers, I HIGHLY recommend this dish!

I rarely leave reviews on this site but this was so good i just had to. I used a bottle of clam juice, i didn't use the parsley, water, clams, or cod and it was still delicious! I added an extra can of chicken broth and more wine to the soup. I didn't have a clue on what wine to use.  So I just grabbed White Zinfandel.  It definately made the difference.  Excellent!

My old favorite cioppino receipe is from a Weight Wathers cookbook I have. Loved the receipe.   This just became my NEW Favorite receipe.  I made it for New Years Eva dinner.  I only made one small change, I use halibut instead of the cod. (the store was out of cod)I will make this again and again.

I just made this and it is fabulous! I used a lot of the suggestions. I live very far from the ocean so I do not buy fresh seafood. Everything was frozen except the clams and mussels which were canned and it still was great! Because I used frozen seafood it made it very affordable because I bought a litte here and there, like when it was on sale and when I had all I wanted I made the cioppino. I will make this regularly. Thanks to Star and everyone else who wrote in.

subbed about 5 different fish for the cod (not even sure what, my fish monger just hooks me up) and otherwise made as directed, came out awesome, but next time I will add some potatoes, just to balance it out a little bit.

I didn't think this was so great. I didn't include the shrimp, as my husband is on a low-cholesterol diet. I wish I had read other reviews and added the clam juice for more flavor - the broth was bland, despite more garlic, wine, salt and pepper. My husband really liked it, but I was pretty much indifferent. I don't think it was worth the expense.

I'm not even a fan of sea food, but my wife and in-laws are, so I've made this recipe twice now, and both times even I have loved it.  It's just the right mix of various sea foods with spices and a touch of vegetables. Served with a warm rosemary bread, it's unbeatable.

I made a few substitutions out of necessity and for simplicity, but it still turned out delicious! I halved the recipe, so the subs I made were:

- pre-chopped frozen onions
- 1/3 cup dried thyme instead of 1 cup fresh parsley
- 1 lb fresh tomatoes instead of canned
- mushroom and chicken broth granules instead of canned chicken broth
- de-alcoholized white wine
- diver scallops instead of bay scallops
- more clams instead of mussels
- omitted the crabmeat
- dogfish instead of cod

I had chopped the diver scallops into roughly the same sized pieces as bay scallops, but they ended up being too small to be discernible in the stew. Will just quarter them next time. We served it with toasted homemade bread from our bread machine. So good!

This is delicious! Expensive, which is why I made it for Christmas Eve dinner. I added squid and used imitation crab meat. Everyone loved the recipe! I also addef red pepper flakes for spiciness. I also added extra wine instead of the water, and simmered for over an hour until just before we were ready to eat, when i added the seafood.

I add some chopped dill and a bottle of clam juice instead of water. I also add cubed red potatoes instead of tomato.   I let the broth stew on low for a couple hours with a lid and when ready to eat add the seafood 8 min. for cooking time.  I even serve it with fresh chopped parsley and shredded parmesan cheese on top with whole wheat crusty bread and white wine.  This is my dream food. Friend and family love it.

The recipe was a great one but I found the broth lacking the punch of flavor I was hoping for. To be fair I did used low sodium ingredients (for my hubby.) Instead of the stewed tomatoes I used one can diced with Italian spices, one can fire roasted (both untrained), I added a minced jalapeño (seeds removed) and an entire bulb of fresh garlic. I substituted the cut of water for fish broth but next time I’ll use a fish stick in lieu of the water and lastly I added an entire 6 oz can of tomato paste. I think after melding it will be so much more decadent and rich tomorrow. My family loved it right off the stove though!

I made this recipe just as listed. It was delicious without any adjustments. I served it with garlic Texas toast to sop up the just. There were left overs, so I warmed them and served it over rice. It was just as delicious. Will definitely make this again.

Great recipe!  I have made it twice, pretty much as stated, with only minor changes. First, you don’t need all that butter.  I omitted the butter and sautéed In olive oil. I used rotel tomatoes instead of stewed to give it a little more kick. This is a restaurant style recipe. My husband and my friend both loved it!!  Use whatever seafood you have. I didn’t put fish in mine and used clams once and mussels once with shrimp, scallops and crab. I served it over linguini. It is easily the best recipe I have tried on this website! Thank you Star!

I have made this recipe many times. Only thing I have added is sausage & red pepper flakes in the beginning with the onions & garlic. I either add gnocchi or serve it over pasta. It turns out great every time.We add all kinds of fish & my family loves it!!

Cioppino is one of my wife's favs so I made it for her b-day even though I had never made cioppino before. She said she loved it and that it rivaled the one she likes so much at a Palm Springs restaurant we frquent. Only deviation was 3 times the garlic. We are proponents of the "no such thing as too much garlic" theory.

This was simple and had great taste. I didn’t have to add any more seasoning, although you can. My son liked it and ate most of it from me. My wife is a vegetarian and she really enjoyed the soup. she didn’t eat the seafood. So more for us.

Try adding crushed red pepper and fennel fronds. The pepper will give it a spicy flavor and the fronds will help sweeten the over all flavor.

I don't know if all Costco's carry it, but ours has a frozen seafood mix in the open freezers (not in the reach-ins with the doors) that includes fish, mussels, calamari tubes, shrimp and scallops.  I use this mix and OMG it is so easy and done in under 30 minutes.  Crusty toasted bread for schmearing and best ever!

I made it pretty much as described.  I stole the advice from others about using less butter and not using water.  I also dropped out the Mussels (just not a fan).  

In a nutshell, this is a very very good recipe, and really pretty simple and pretty forgiving.  I will certainly make it again.

And don't forget to compliment it with some great crunch bread :)

I’m Not sure how you can go wrong here.      The broth is the base.   Mussels, clams, shrimp, crab and cod!!   Delicious.    For myself I added extra butter and a tad red pepper.    Do not forget the dipping bread!

I made 1/2 of the recipe for 2 people for a date night dinner.  It turned out wonderful.  I used giant fresh shrimp as they taste almost like lobster.  These shrimp come from Bangladesh.  Omitted the mussels as they are not local fresh.  Also used a special spice blend that is similar to Old Bay but with a light hand. In addition I used small crab claws instead of chunks of crab meat. My husband gave it a high-five and we will make again.

Great tasting and good looking too. The recipes needs salt. Start with one teaspoon and add more at the end if you like. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of pepper flakes for spice.

It turned out okay made as is and was definitely better the next day but next time I will add clam juice instead of water as other reviews suggested.  Husband said it needed heat so I'll also add red pepper flakes next time.  I will probably also leave the lid off for simmering next time to see if it will reduce some and concentrate the flavors a little more.

This was really good.  I used all the butter called for, and enjoyed it immensely.  I didn't have mussels or crab, but it was great anyway.

Fantastic flavor everyone loved it. I took others advice and used 3-14.5 oz cans of tomato and a little extra wine and skipped the water. It was too much seafood for me. I would only put in my family favorites or half the cod and clams/mussels next time.

I have made this for several years now for Christmas eve. I don't know why I've never rated it before! I pretty much make it as written. Yes, I will sub fresh tomatoes for canned, and homemade chicken stock for canned. But aside from that, this is a very good recipe. Variations are always welcome. This year I used halibut, scallops (jumbo and bay), prawns and mussels. I could not find fresh clams anywhere! So I used a can of canned clams and substituted the nectar for water. Some years I use cod, and salmon... anything is great. As much as possible, go for fresh. You can make any old chowder with frozen seafood; make this a special dish and use fresh. This year I also added sliced fennel...first time I have done that and I will definitely do it again! The recipe craves some veg. The only thing I do that is not written is simmer it for hours - before adding any seafood. The flavours need to really settle in and blend. If it thickens, add more wine! Follow the recipe for adding seafood, and in what order. Once you add the seafood, you need to stay on top of this to not overcook. I can't wait for next Christmas eve!

This was delicious, but only after I played with the broth a little. I followed the broth recipe exactly, even used dry white wine per reviews, but it tasted odd, so I cooked it down for an hour or so and then added a few cups of water, olive oil, and more salt. Then it was perfect.

Loved this recipe with modifications.  Used only 2 tablespoons of butter, seafood stock instead of chicken, clam juice instead of water, added a little salt, pepper and red pepper flakes and used 1/2 fennel bulb.  DELICIOUS!!

This was an ambitious recipe but well worth it. I got the inspiration from a local French restaurant that serves Seafood Cioppino. I made it as a 2nd Thanksgiving dish since one of our friends is vegetarian and I wanted to make something special. I really enjoyed this delicious Cioppino/boullabaise, as did my spouse and our guests. It is a new favourite. Mind you, it is not cheap.
I got lots of help and tips from the seafood dept. Staff person at my local grocery store.
I actually combined 2 different recipes.
Definitely, no need to add water. I used a stock made from salmon fish heads and bulbs of fennel. I used fresh thyme but couldn't find fresh marjoram.
I added a can of diced tomatoes and tomato paste as the chef at the restaurant where they make this dish gave me a tip about thickening the broth. I used a combination of fresh and frozen ingredients like frozen scallops, frozen shrimp, fresh cod, crab pieces, fresh mussels. As suggested by the seafood dept. fellow, I steamed the mussels seperately at the very end so that they wouldn't be chewy. The mussels also add to the presentation.
My friends were impressed. This was a restaurant quality dish and I generally don't even like tomato based seafood dishes. This one is a keeper. Can't wait to make it again.
Got the ingredients ready for take 2. Going to use fresh scallops and halibut broth/stock this time.

Reminded me of growing up in the Bay Area. We’d go to SF on the weekends, visit the wharf and grab some cioppino. Thanks for the memories!

I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup of "Pernod" (a french liquor) as a subsitute for one of the cups of warter.  It was marvelous and my guests raved.  You'll have plenty left over, whcih is even better a day later.

Very easy to make and the whole family loved it.  I added tarragon because I love it and used flounder instead of cod because I already had it on hand.  This is definitely one to be repeated!

Delish!  We made this with a frozen seafood mix (shrimp, scallops, calamari) the first time.  Added 1/2 of a small head of fennel and increased the crushed red pepper.  Served it with a caprese salad and garlic bread.

Made the dish over the weekend. I substituted the chicken stock with seafood stock. Also added Delmonte petite diced tomatoes with jalapeños and habanero for some bite. Overall the dish was a success will definitely make again. Plan on thickening the broth for a nice winter soup!

This is THE best recipe from ALLRECIPES so far! You can not go wrong. I've even used frozen mussels, clams and it's been excellent. I add seafood stock and chicken stock. Also add a little cayenne it gives it a great flavor. ...just a touch. This recipe doesn't need to be expensive to taste good. I also marinate the onions, garlic and parsley with a little olive oil and that's when I add a little cayenne. Leave it for a half hour then melt the butter and place it in....delicious! Again.. best recipe...now time to have a beer and a little of this soup ??

Amazing taste of San Francisco! Great for a casual dinner party! You can adjust the choices of seafood to go with the season so you don't go broke!

This is the second time we've made this recipe in 2 weeks.  The wine we used was Gewürztraminer  Kabinett , which took this dish over the top. It is a sweeter wine, but really works with this amazing recipe.  Both hubby and I love it. I agree with other reviewers about the French bread to dip in the sauce, AMAZING?  Thank you for sharing Star Pooley this is a KEEPER?

I didn't add any of the herb since I first cooked this at my Mom's and being Asians, we don't normally use these herbs. We didn't have enough tomatoes and didn't have white wine. We used all chicken broth (even for the water) , added more garlic and it turned out wonderful, even with all these changes. I used fresh mussels (that's it) and a lot of it.

This was fantastic! Like everyone else I swapped out a couple of things. I used one can of fish stock over one of the chicken broths. I also used one can of crushed tomatoes and one can of stewed. I also added an extra bit of garlic. My family enjoyed this and cannot wait to have it again!

This was a fantastic recipe!  I divided by 3 to make for just the two of us...I followed the recipe fairly true to form, but  I reduced the butter to 2 TBSP rather than 1/2 cup.  I don't used canned veggies so subbed fresh diced tomatoes and added a tablespoon of home-made tomato paste in place of canned tomatoes. I used all fresh herbs.  I added a dash of sea salt since I did not use the canned tomatoes. I reduced the fish and increased the crab.  Served it with Parmesan toasted ciabatta and a nice white wine. Dee-Lish. My mother never eats all her food and she had seconds. Love the suggestions and comments of others (which I read after I made it...duh)  variable cost through seafood selection choices, using olive oil, fish stock rather than chicken...I am just glad there are leftovers for lunch tomorrow!!!

I kept the basic recipe, but added crawfish and chopped conch to all the rest of the seafood.  The broth is off the hook tasty.  I could just eat the broth.  This became a new traditional Christmas meal.

This was so delicious! I had to make some adjustments due to ingredients in the original. I substituted mussels,langoustine,and red snapper. I used Better than Bouillon fish base and added equal amounts of water to base. I didn't have fresh fennel so I used dried and likewise on the rest of the herbs. My husband has declared it to be a standard meal every Christmas eve!

I needed to clean out my freezer, it had a lot of seafood in it!  I found this recipe and decided to make it based on the reviews.    In place of the chicken broth I used clam broth (it was in the freezer too).  I added fresh ground black pepper and crushed red pepper flakes at the end (I like a little spice).  Very flavorful dish, I loved it

I used frozen cooked shellfish, canned diced tomatoes, and did not have crab meat or cod. Also did not use thyme. It was very tasty. A hit with all of the family.

Excellent!  I made it per the recipe with the exception of adding saffron (I figured since I spent a fortune on the seafood I might as well go all out).  I'm not sure all the butter was necessary, maybe next time, and there will be a next time, I'll try halving it.

This was amazing! I halved the recipe and it still made five big helpings. The only big change I made was subbing in a bottle of clam juice for the water, as other reviewers suggested. This would be a great dinner party dish to impress a group.

I have made this a dozen times, and this is my official "show off" dish during a family potluck or get together with friends. This recipe is so good that if I got laid off tomorrow I will start a restaurant selling Cioppino.

AMAZING!!!  I made this yesterday and it turned out beautifully!  I did make a couple of changes due to suggestions by other reviews.  I used 3 cans of stewed tomatoes pureed, omitted the water and used clam juice.  This will be a do over for sure!  
I would not suggest doubling this recipe unless your feeding an army, as it makes more than enough servings!!

LOVE IT!! I have made this twice now and varied the seafood both times; what I had on hand the first round, and trying  some new sea critters the second. I've never used the clams or mussels in the shell, not that into the shells in my soup. The second time I tried calamari and oysters (shelled) instead  of the clams and mussels and my husband really liked those additions. Also we've used sea scallops in place of bay scallops. They are more costly so I tend to buy 4 - 5 and cut them into pieces. They are delicious! 
As with other reviewers I've reduced the butter, about 1/2 stick with some added olive oil. I also add a can of Italian tomato paste for extra flavor along with some salt and pepper to taste. The base of this is really very good, but I do omit the cup of water, mostly because my pot won't  hold that much.  
It's fun to change up the  seafood to what's on hand or even waiting for sales and bargains to come along. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow!  This Cioppino is absolutely fabulous.  I followed the recipe except I finely diced 3/4 stalk of celery and sautéed with onions and garlic in beginning.  I also added an 8oz bottle of clam juice. Lastly, I added italian flavored diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes.  Pretty simple changes.  Overall, this is excellent! Oh and all I had was riesling. Not the right wine but I wasn't going to let that stop me.  Soon good.

This recipe is outstanding!  I love reading reviews so this is the first time I'm reviewing a recipe.  Yes, I did change a few things out of necessity.  (I shopped on Christmas Eve and not all the seafood was available). My entire family are seafood lovers and I had plenty of it in there,  but the SAUCE was the biggest hit!   We were slurping and slopping it up with bread, rolls and literally drinking it after the seafood was gone.  Will make this dish an annual Christmas Eve dish!

Excellent recipe.  Use fresh fish for best results  Frozen bags of mixed fish does not work.

Served it over fettuccini. I thought the dried herbs as written were a little much; next time I'll use fresh or less. Also, we poured 1/3 cup lemon juice in to it (my husband loves lemon) and it was great.

Made it without the fish but added calamari.  Big hit with the family!  One change I will make for next time... If the clams aren't small enough, put them in the pot 4-5 minutes before the rest of the seafood so they open without the other seafood cooking a little too long.

I took some of the suggestions from other reviews. I added some red wine, increased the seasonings just a bit and doubled the garlic. I used cod, shrimp, langostinos and snow crab. I also thought it needed some depth and a little more tomato flavor, so I added a small can of V8. Next time I will use 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil. Loved it!

This was good, but it needed a bit more flavor. Used crushed tomatoes, Worcestershire and crushed red pepper flakes.

"Thats a Do-Over!" is what I got from my husband! I scaled the recipe down a bit, but only altered it according to the sea-food we had on hand. I had some muscles I needed to use, and some gorgeous shrimp in the freezer. My husband picked up some snapper, good white wine, and crusty bread on the way home from work. We made some homemade marinara sauce the night before, and I couldn't resist using it, in addition to a can of diced tomatoes. . So good! So easy and so adaptable.

I LOVE this recipe.  I have made it several times and it always gets rave reviews.  I don't drink alcohol, nor cook with it, so I have taken a previous suggestion and used clam juice and a little extra chicken broth in place of the wine.  I recently made it for a small dinner party and decided to add muchrooms and kale.  It was a hit!

Really good! I halved the recipe and reduced the butter by a lot. I don't feel like it was missing it either. I also used extra chicken stock instead of adding water. I also added some salt and pepper. Next time I would increase the garlic and wine.

Outstanding recipe.  My partner and I decided to try this for a dinner for just we two. Cutting everything in half with just some minor changes yielded the best cioppino I remember having - and I've had quite a few.  We added several Tbs tomato paste and skipped the water as we like a heartier broth. I simmered the shellfish shells in a bit of the wine and added that.  I always do that to get the last bit of flavor from prawns and the like.  Wonderful keeper for us!!

I would have given it 5 stars, but I changed it a bit so I thought I should make that distinction. My fiance hasn't tried mussels before, so I made it without clams or mussels. Instead I used cod, salmon, scallops and shrimp. It was terrific. I also added lots of veggies, cabbage, carrot, turnips, jalapeno, alll sauteed in the butter. Wow!!!

Followed the recipe but tweaked it by adding a couple of spoonfuls of concentrated fish stock and a can of chopped clams in the broth. Oh, and a squeeze of fresh lemon. It was excellent and easy too!

Altered the recipe and it was very good.  Doubled the tyme, added dried red pepper, salt and pepper, used 10 cloves of garlic, no muscles or clams but additional other seafood,and substituted fresh tomatoes for the canned. If I include cleaning the seafood in the prep time, my prep time was much longer than 10 minutes. Next time I may add small chopped cooked potatoes.

I'd like it a little more thicker sauce. Taste was great. It makes a ton. I shoulda cut it half for the two of us.

Loved this recipe! Very delicious and will make again next week!   Made as is only used olive oil instead of butter an calamari instead of crab meat.  Oh, and I added more white wine instead of water.

I see lots of people are using red wine, but I'd stick to white wine. It' goes better with seafood.

Enjoy this great recipe!

So easy and incredible!  This can be made so many different ways, for those who use shrimp de-shell and throw the shells in the broth to simmer on low.  This will allow the flavors to blend nicely and remove before adding your seafood.

Really great.  My italian husband loved it and ate leftovers two days in a row, which he never does.  Instead of chicken broth I did some diced tomato and veg bouillon.  Added clam juice for depth of flavor and simmered all afternoon before adding seafood.

This was awesome - my whole family loved it!  I basically halved the amount of seafood, but couldn't find fresh clams so I increased the mussels.  It made enough for a family of four (mom, dad, two nine-year-olds) that we'll have leftovers tomorrow.

way way too much time and way way way too much money for a so so meal with no real substance. do yourself a favor and look up a good seafood gumbo. doubled it and got 1 1/2 gal. left over after party, thinking of freezing some, thickening the base and trying it over linguine.

This is a very forgiving and flexible recipe.It was one of the few leftovers I've frozen that disappeared within a week anyway. I did make some modifications based on the ingredients I had.  I had half a red onion, half a brown onion, and a large shallot.  The shallot added that something extra that not only really elevates a dish but also made the house smell great and not fishy.  I didn't have cod, so I used frozen salmon filets--OK, but would use cod next time.  I had sea scallops, not bay scallops, so cut them in smaller pieces--they have a nice, buttery flavor that bay scallops lack. I didn't have clams or mussels so those were left out also.   I froze the leftovers in four separate batches, and on reheating a couple of them, added about a cup of half and half each time.   Serve with warm, crusty french bread and salad--super delicious!

What went wrong? My dish came out bland. Followed the receipe exactly with added clam juice, but was still lacking enough flavor.

Great. But, hold on to your wallet. It's an expensive dish to make.

After making this several times with good reviews, my husband had related to me that he prefers I cook the fish separately so that the broth keeps it's original taste. He thinks the broth gets too "fishy" and he loves the taste of the broth before the fish gets added. Just an option.

Wow! Too bad I can't give it 6 stars. It's prety easy to make and it gives a lot of food. It ends up being an expensive dish, but it is well worth it in the end.

Awesome!   I made a few changes, used canned pasta sauce instead of tomatoes, a whole lot of garlic, 2 TBL red pepper flakes (the heat really makes it), red wine instead of white, 2 cups fish stock.    Added mussels 7 minutes before done, the balance of items at 4 (you don't cook fish, you warm it up).    Served over bed of Angel Hair.    Yum!

Excellent recipe. I was looking for a special dinner for New Years Day and came across this recipe. I live on the East Coast now but used to eat Cioppino all the time when I lived in the Bay Area. I used the suggestions of the crushed tomatoes, red wine (merlot) and hot red pepper flakes. Used clams, mussels, scallops, scrod and king crab legs. Pricey but worth it for a special dinner. If you want to impress this is the right dish.

This was absolutely fantastic. I made a shrimp stock and substituted that for the chicken stock and then didn't have scallops or crab, so put some salmon and cod in at the end. Served it at a dinner party and people were talking about it the next day!

Amazing recipe; I've cooked it at several dinner parties and it was very well received by all...even my friend that hates seafood(whom I cooked chicken for instead) tried it and ended up having an entire bowl of his own!  Be careful when adding all of the seafood ingredients, and follow the order that others have suggested.  I added frozen cod at the end because I didn't have fresh available...highly recommended to FULLY defrost before adding at the end or else it can overcook anything else.

This was good, but I felt it needed a little more tomato flavor. Next time we will put in crushed tomatoes instead of stewed.

Best seafood dish I ever made.  Served it to very discriminating guests and everybody raved.  I would do one thing differently:  Bring to a boil as directed, THEN add the shrimp, cover and turn off the heat.  My shrimp became a little tough, following the directons.  I also did as another reviewer suggested and substituted additional 1/2 cup white wine instead of the water called for.  This one is a definite repeat performance!

Oh my gosh, this was fantastic!!! I had my first taste of Cioppino at Scoma's in San Francisco and when I ran across this recipe I knew I had to try it. The only modifications to original recipe were that I omitted the cod and used seafood broth instead of chicken. My fiance raved about it, especially the soup. I had to make a special trip to Whole Foods to get the shellfish and they weren't cheap but oh so worth it! Can't wait to try the leftovers as soups/stews are usually better the second time around.

Fantastic.  I could not get mussels, so I doubled the clams, which worked out great.  I also used Mahi instead of Cod.  I used fresh thyme and basil because I had some leftover from another recipe.  Rave reviews. Makes a lot!

Very good place to start! I added WAY more garlic, and cooked clams first. I also omitted water and used homemade lamb stock (it's all i had!), white wine and ground tomatoes for the broth.

I made this last week with shrimp, bay scallops, clams and canned crab meat. Like some reviewers suggested, I used a bottle of clam juice but I found that it made the soup too fishy.. I fixed it by adding a cup of water though so it was all good. I'm making it again tonight and this time I only used 1/2 bottle of clam juice and 3/4 cup water. I'm excited to eat it! Each time, all the ingredients have costed me a little less than $50.. and it's sooo worth it too! =)

I make cioppino every year and this recipe was the best combination I've ever had. I did change the broth to a fumet and I left out the mussels and added the squid, but the combination of herbs and the detail given in the recipe and other suggestions made this a huge hit with the 15 people I fed that evening. Next year I certainly will use it again.

I was disappointed with this one.  After all the great reviews, I guess my expectation was little too high.  Our family really didn't care for it too much.  It tasted nothing like from restaurant.  I wouldn't make this again.  Sorry.

This is pretty good but very, very  rich...1/2 of my guests liked it, the other 1/2 thought it was only OK.  I'd be tempted to try something in place of the butter (olive oil?), except this is too expensive of a recipe to experiment with.

Served to my family with fresh San Francisco sour dough bread for dipping.  It was delicious.  I wouldn't change a thing.

After my husband and I got back from San Fran we had been craving the cioppino from the famous Tadich Grill (longest running restaurant,claims to have invented or perfected the dish) Nothing can compare to the Tadich but this was a good substitution.

This recipe must be the best Cioppino of it's kind. I do add more seafood than requested in the recipe which doesn't alter the flavor of the soup. 5 stars!

Made for supper last night.  Used whole crab legs instead of clumped crab meat and kept everything else as written.  My family really enjoyed.  Next time I might throw in some Old Bay spice.  Thought the sauce needed something just a little more.  Served with a nice crusty bread.  Thanks

I made this for my birthday party.  I saved this recipe for a special occasion because it's expensive.  I left out the clams and mussels because I don't like them.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing.  I got MAD rave reviews.  Served this with a nice bread for sopping up the juices.

My husband loves cioppino and always orders it if its on the menu.  I made this for a dinner party of about 8 adults.  Everyone loved it.  I had to make a few changes....I didn't add mussels because of allergy, I used the shrimp with their shells, I put in 2 lbs. crab legs and added the clam juice recommended by other reviewers.  Also, I threw it a couple of extra tomatoes because my taste was a little bland.  Overall, everyone loved it including me and this is a dish I never order.  Highly recommend it!  Thanks to original submitter.

Excellent recipe - made it for a dinner party as a appetizer serve with warm bread.  Recipe was easy to follow the only exception I made was to skip the mussels and add more clams. (not a big fan on Mussels) Thank you for sharing your recipe and making my dinner party a big success!

This was absolutely delicious!! I made it exactly as it was written, but used more clams instead of mussells (don't care for them). The only downfall is the price.  Will make this wonderful soup for special occasions.  Thanks for sharing!

Star Pooley's ciopppino is wonderful as it is, and a great jumping off point as a base for customizing this wonderful stew.  Here is El Paso, most people appreciate a little spice and Star's cioppino takes nicely to a "t" or a "T"
of crushed red pepper.  I too added salmon and cod, along with "frozen seafood mix" from the local market (contains octopus, squid, and mussels).

My current batch on the stove right now is made with fish stock (just boil a whole fish), red wine and 4 garlic cloves.  This batch is about 50% larger than Star's recipe and I tracked the cost at $60.05 for 10 quarts. This cost included $15 for a pount of picked-over blue crab (Sam's Club). A little pricey but only $6/serving for a main course and big eaters... along with a wonderful crusty french loaf.  Gracias amiga!

This was a truly wonderful recipe.  Better than I have had in many restaurants.  I would recommend using salmon instead of the cod though.

I don't normally like fish soup - I think it's something to do with texture! But this was really tasty. All I had to put in it was canned crab, a bit of frozen shrimp and some cod but that was enough. I also added a few potatoes to make it more substantial but other than that I stuck with the recipe. I liked it because it wasn't too tomato-y. It had tomatoes in it but it wasn't tomato based. Everyone who ate it loved it. Keeper!

The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was because of the price. It's not a cheap dish, but it was absolutly amazing. I used sole instead of cod, but really you could use any combination of sea food. Really rich flavor, couldn't eat a big serving. Served the leftovers with angel hair pasta, it was way better this way. Worth making if you are out to impress.

Didn't use chicken broth, instead used celery sauce, i think thats what its called, and about 3 cups of water with it.  Still came out superb, ended up with leftovers.

This recipes was fantastic and very easy to make. I substituted a nice piece of lobster and I added the cod fillet instead of the mussels and crabmeat. Though I might just add everything next time. Everyone Globbbled it up. This is a keeper. Thanks Star for submitting this recipe

I love this receipe because it's so flexible.  Almost any seafood works so buy what's on sale!  I like it a little spicier so add hot sauce but don't be afraid to play with the ingredients.

This recipe was awesome!  My hubby loves Cioppino and always orders it when we eat by the wharf in SF.  He said this was just as good as any restaurant.  I gave it only 3 stars for quickness, because cooking it longer made it better.  I cooked it for about 4 hours before I added the fish.  Can't wait to make it again!
