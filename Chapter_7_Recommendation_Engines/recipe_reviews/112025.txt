OMG!! These were a big hit with my family! The only thing I changed was that I did NOT stain the brine. I left the onion, garlic and ONE pepper in the jar. Thanks!

Overall, pretty good. I was expecting a little more "kick" since I doubled the chipotle. But the flavor was nice.

My family can't get enough of these!  I recommend refrigerating them about 5 days for the eggs to really take on the flavors of the brine.

Very good! I would add more chipotle or adobo sauce to make these eggs spicy. The spice as-is is very mild. I still prefer throwing boiled eggs into left over pickle jars in the remaining brine for the perfect pickled egg, but these were nice for a change of pace.

I loved the change of pace from the usual pickled egg. That said, these aren't spicy at all, for those who are scared to try them. On the heat scale, they were about a 1. I ended up adding 2 whole peppers into the jar and that took them to about a 3-4 on the spicy scale.  Be sure to strain the brine or else you will get a lot of sediment in your jar.

Fantastic Results. 1/2 can(it's a small can to begin with) of Chipotles & adobo sauce. Put eggs in pot, brought water to boil over medium heat,then timed 17-18 mins, eggs into cold water until cool/cold before shelling - worked for me. It's a Keeper!

I have made it and do enjoy it but very little chipotle flavor.  I would suggest to put the pepper in the jar split open instead of the sauce pan and add another two spoonfuls of the Adobe sauce into the sauce pan. this should give you a better result.

This is a great recipe! I have made this a couple of times. I like to make a large batch in a 2quart jar and add the entire can of chipotles. Also they are best after about three months in the fridge.

I absolutely love this recipe!   Has heat and lots of flavor. Instead of a cookie .. go for these eggs.  They are filling and yummy.  Thank you for such a great idea.

They taste like a plain pickled egg. But... The onions are great! I used those by themselves and made some more to have. Great pickled onion recipe.

Fantastic recipe.   I will make again, but make it a little more spicy.   In my first batch, I used large eggs and only a single quart jar, so I only got 9 or 10 eggs in there.   Because I knew the liquid would be too much for one jar, and because I love the vinegar flavor, I cut the water in half.   I still had too much and should cut it further.   I used the recipe amount of peppers, onions and garlic.   I would like it spicier next time, so I would probably double the peppers.   Thank you for a great recipe.

Delicious eggs that go with everything. I added extra chipotles because we like things hot but we still found them to be mild albeit full of flavor. That smoky taste is so unique and that's what sets these apart from your regular pickled eggs. Thank you for the recipe.

I made these exactly as written. I wasn't a fan. I love spicy  food and I love pickled eggs so I thought this would be a match made in heaven. I was completely wrong. There didn't seem to be very much flavor. I'll go back to making pickled eggs the way I usually do and maybe adding in some crushed red pepper and cayenne.
