I loved the ease and simplicity of this recipe. Because there is only two of us I scaled it down to 3 servings. I also have to admit that I used onions instead of leeks, which I know would have been way better.  Next time I would definitely increase the amount of sauce and slice the potatoes thinner.   I like the recipe just looking for a bit more flavor.
