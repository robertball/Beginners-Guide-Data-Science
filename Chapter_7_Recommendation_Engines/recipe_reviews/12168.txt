This was a very good recipe.  The filling might have been a little sweet, but then I used sweet instead of tart cherries.  Next time I use sweet cherries I'll cut the sugar a little.  Very easy and impressive!  Thank you!

Used fresh strawberries, raspberry and blueberries instead. No alcohol. Amazing

I had to make a couple of changes, I used a combination of tart cherries and sweet cherries, my cherry tree didn't give me enough tart cherries.  I couldn't find orange flower water so I substituted vanilla extract. Funny story about the kirsch I purchased a bottle at the local store while getting out of the car with hands filled of grocery bags the bag with the kirsch fell, yes my sidewalk had a good drink. I used a teaspoon of vanilla extract and that gave it a nice taste.
