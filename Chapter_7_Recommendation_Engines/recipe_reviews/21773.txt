Excellent!  I made a few changes after my husband said it was a "little heavy".  I used real whipping cream.  After whipping and after preparing the pudding according to the box I gently folded the two together.  I also used fresh strawberries.  I then placed the cubed angel food caked in the bottom, then whip cream and pudding mixture followed by freshly sliced strawberries and continuing for 2 more layers.  I topped the last layer of strawberries with freshly whipped lightly sweetened cream and garnished the top with uncut strawberries. I got rave reviews!  It was light, simple and a perfect change from heavy desserts!  BRAVO!!!

I used cheesecake flavored pudding (SO good!!) and real whipped cream with a touch of vanilla and sugar, insted of Cool Whip.  This is a show stopper!

I made this for 4th of July. YUMMY and Beautful in my trifle bowl. I did make a few changes. I used 1 pint of real whipped cream and whipped it fluffy/stiff in my mixer and added about 3 to 4T of sugar to sweeten it and used in place of the frozen whipped topping. I also used lady fingers in place of the  angel food cake. And to keep with the 4th theme, I used fresh strawberries and a row of fresh blueberries(instead of bananas) in the middle. I know I changed a lot of the recipe but I thank T's Mom for inspiring me!

Excellent!  Light and delicious.  Pudding is supposed to be the largest sized box.  I now use 2 1/2 cups of milk in the pudding and fresh berries when they are in season.

Delicious and forgiving recipe.  I was short on time so I used the strawberries still frozen (cut in half) and slices of whipped topping, then chilled only 2 hours, but it still tasted great!  It makes a huge amount and doesn't store well (brown bananas & soupy at the bottom by the next day), so unless you are feeding 10+, you may want to half the recipe.

There are just not enough words to describe how delicious and absolutely FABULOUS this dessert is !! It's so light & creamy and all the flavors just blend together perfectly.
Make sure you don't use skim milk when making the pudding -- it won't be thick enough & watery instead. I used French Vanilla pudding and it was sooooo good ! Also made mine with fresh strawberries & put a few stawberry & banana slices on the very top for garnish.

I love trifle and make it often, but this recipe had way too many bananas for our taste. I made my own whipped cream instead of cool whip. Everyone kept asking me if I had used banana pudding and it wasn't really flavorful other than the banana taste.
 *Tip-dip banana slices in orange juice to prevent browning.

My local girlfriends had a going away party for me yesterday and this was one of the desserts I helped make. My friend who hosted had sugar free pudding and we used all strawberries instead of strawberries and bananas. Let me tell you......this was absolutely a hit. Not the prettiest dessert in the world but it was so. darn. yummy. At the end of the gathering, there was only a small amount left in the bowl. Huge hit. Both my friend and I thought that this would be even tastier with instant cheesecake pudding and more strawberries, using fresh as well as frozen. Sometimes the most simple ingredients make THE best food. You could totally go all "light" ingredients, by using SF pudding mix like we did but also using fat free milk, sugar free angel food cake (which I've seen at Walmart), and "lite" whipped topping.

I was afraid that it would just taste like fruit on top of pudding, so I made a few slight changes.  I mixed vanilla pudding, 1 cup of milk & 1 cup of sour cream and beat until it thickened, then folded in a tub of cool whip (french vanilla flavored).  Layered the cake cubes,  FRESH strawberries & blueberries, omitted the bananas because they look yuck after a short time, then the "pudding" mixture.  Not only was it delicious, but it was beautiful.  It was the right amount of sweetness.  It only lasted a day!

This is a beautiful light dessert.  I served this at a bar-b-que, and it went so fast!  I used real strawberries and whip cream.   I whipped the cream, and folded it into the pudding, and that worked out really nicely.

I made this dessert for Mother's Day. I split it in half and made 2 medium bowls to take to my family and my in-laws. They both loved it. I even had a few people ask for the recipe. My brother-in-law isn't big on sweets and said that this dessert was perfect.
However, I did make a few changes in mine. I omitted the bananas because my husband doesn't like them and because they brown quickly, so I only used strawberries. I used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla and mixed a cup or so of the whipped topping into it to make it a little fluffier. And because of that I had to use an extra container of the whipped topping. I did use light whipped topping so it wasn't as sweet. I also used fresh strawberries instead of frozen. Absolutely delicious and very light! I will use this recipe again and again. Thank you!!

I made this recipe to take to a dinner at a friend's house and the three of us polished off about half the dessert. I also used fresh strawberries instead of the frozen and it was great.  The recipe makes quite a bit of dessert soo this is great to take to an office party or a church potluck.  Very easy and very little effort.

Yummy! I took it to a Memorial Day BBQ and it was gone. I probably could have used another bag of strawberries - I think I used more than half on the first layer. Very good!

This was a BIG hit! I made this twice...last night I made it for Mother's Day and it was devoured! Also, I substitued low fat ingredients such as skim milk for pudding and low fat whip cream. Thanks for a great recipe - perfect for big groups.

I made a couple of changes to this recipe and I can't imagine that the original would be worse- so I am rating it a 5.  Used fresh strawberries and omitted the banana.  I also used premade vanilla creme cake from the store. Used the called for pudding and cool whip. Was a hit at the labor day picnic that we took it to. Our host said that we would be the official dessert "people" from now on! (I just need a TRIFLE DISH!)

Very good!  Another very forgiving recipe.  Always well received.  I used some mixed berries as well as the bananas & Strawberries.  Decorated it with Kiwi and Strawberries.  I made a change on half of the whipped topping by mixing it with the remaining vanilla pudding and adding about 1/3 cup sweetened condensed milk.  Yummy!

I was looking for a simple summer fruit trifle and this was the perfect pick!!
I made a couple changes based on what I had available in the house.  I used pound cake rather than angel food cake and added crushed pineapple to fruit layer.  I also used fresh strawberries.  It received 5 stars from everyone for a delish "banan split trifle"!  I might try it with brownies next time instead of the pound cake!

This was really good.  I changed some of the recipe and this is why I am only giving 4 stars...with my changes it is totally worth 5 stars.  I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen and added blueberries.  I coated the bannana slices with lemon juice so they would not turn brown.  I also doubled this recipe (except the cake) and used a really big clear trifle bowl to serve a large amount of people.  This was a hit and many people wanted the recipe.

This recipe was great!!! I made it for a lunch party yesterday and everyone loved it. Everyone was raving about how light it was, this from a crowd that doesnt care much for deserts.

I made the cake using Duncan Hines Yellow cake mix, no time to make cake from scratch. Since the strawberry was a bit sour, I tossed the slices with some sugar. 

Absolutely great recipe, will make it again soon for antoher group of friends.

AMAZING AND BEAUTIFUL DISH!  I made this for a HUGE group of dinner guests, and it made just the perfect amount of trifle! I followed exactly, however, I did use fresh strawberries and sliced them myself which I HIGHLY recommend.  It helps the trifle keep better and avoids a watery and gooey mess. Bottom line: it creates a much better taste!  I will definitely make this again..and again..and again!

This dessert is really good. I omitted the bananas and used fresh strawberries instead of the frozen ones. I also used homemade whip cream. After reading the other reviews, I thought I'd have a lot left over, but that wasn't the case. With 8 guests, it was almost all gone. Another crowd favorite.

I have made this recipe for years but without the banana's and with real wipped cream the added banana's was great. I also make it with chocolate pudding and banana's. That is also very yummy!

Wonderful recipe! I served this with brunch on Easter Sunday and everyone loved it. Most trifle recipes are usually so heavy because they call for brandy or ladyfingers, but this one is light and refreshing!  My son says he "looooooves" it!

I wanted to use fresh strawberries, but they had none at the grocery store-so I had to use frozen.  I thawed them out & strained any leftover juices from them.  I used 2 bananas on the bottom layer & 3 on top.  When making it, I didn't think taht 1 pkg of pudding would be enough (I screwed up & only used 2 cups of milk, instead of the recommended 3), but when I tasted it, it was delicious!!!  Very easy to prepare (Eventhough Mom didn't have a trifle dish, like I was sure that she did LOL).  I just used a large glass mixing bowl & it was fine.  To garnish, I used a slice of banana in the centre & 5 halves of strawberries to make petals, to make it look like a flower.  Very simple, but effective.  Thanks for a lovely recipe!

This recipe is good, but I ALWAYS use cubed up pound cake instead of angel food cake, it seems to "hold up" better to the liquid in the berries. A few people have complained that it may as well just be called banana pudding.  I find that using pound cake keeps this more trifle-like and less of a messy soupy mess.

I don't think I will use the instant pudding when making this again.  The cook and serve kind would make it so much better. I may try making this with other kinds of fruit as well.

I asked my hubby what he would rate this and he said 4+. It's very good--quite refreshing on a hot summer day! I used fresh strawberries and no bananas, as we don't care for those in desserts. I also used two small packages of white chocolate pudding and whipped my own cream with a little sugar and vanilla. In the future I will probably take previous reviewers' advice and combine the pudding and cream to make one layer, so it doesn't overpower the cake and strawberries. Overall, it's very light and refreshing--I will make again when I need something easy, light, and yummy!

I made this exactly as written with one addition -- sprinkle some nutmeg over the pudding layers for a little added flavor.  That was a subtle but great addition.  It was wonderful, and a hit with the family.  Super easy, and beautiful presentation.  Make it lighter by using sugar free whipped cream and pudding.  Will definitely make again.

I made this for a "Good Friday" Potluck.  Very good...AND I even used frozen fruit!  I put fruit, still frozen, in a calinder and ran it under the cold water tap, then let it sit to drain while I prepared everything else. It was a real crowd pleaser...NOT soggy at all...as mentioned in past reviews using frozen fruit.  Maybe because I made it a 1 p.m for a 6 p.m. dinner(?)  The recipe states it needs to chill about 4 hours before serving...perhaps others prepared the night before, and that's why it was soggy(???) Anyway,   a wonderful, EASY, low cal dessert I will make again and again!

Made it for company after a heavy lasagne dinner, BIG hit!!! I then went out and when I came home my husband had eaten almost all of the rest, can't call it leftovers it was too soon. This is really delicious, and can be made all low fat. Thanks for sharing.

Beautiful finished product! I also made a few changes: I used cheesecake flavored pudding and folded in some Cool Whip to make it a little lighter, and I also sliced fresh strawberries rather than using frozen. Omitted the bananas as well. So I did a layer of angel cake cubes, a layer of sliced fresh strawberries, a layer of the pudding/Cool Whip mixture, and repeated. I like to make trifles the night before so the layers kind of fuse together

I love the different reviews on here because it allows me to add as I see fit from several others.  My family said that it looked as if it belonged in a magazine.  I'm glad I made 2 because it went very fast.   One note:  I purchased 3 boxes of cheesecake pudding and it was not enough so I had to settle for a french vanilla variety for a 4th box @ the local HEB on the day of Thanksgiving.  I also added Eagle Brand milk to the mix as well as added the heavy whipping cream (another reviewers suggestion) to the mix as a whole. It went faster than I anticipated.

My husband called it "strawberry shortcake on steriods".  I omitted the bananas and used real which cream (in lieu of frozen whipped topping).  Delish!

Very Good!  To keep the cake from getting too soogy I baked it in a 9x13 baking dish and then tore it into pieces.    I left it sitting out for about 2 hours so that the pieces would harden up a little.  Then I put it all together.  Now (2 days later) it is all still great and not soggy at all!

This was great. I did change a few things. I used 1- 5 oz. box of vanilla pudding and 1- 3oz. box of  cheese cake pudding. I only used 2 bananas. I used a 16oz. pound cake instead of the of angel food cake.

This trifle was fast, easy and tasted wonderful.  It is so creamy and light.  I did not add the bananas as they turn brown fast.  They can always be added right before you serve the trifle.

There have all ready been so many wonderful reviews but here is another hats off to T's Mom!!! I used fresh strawberries sweetened with a little Splenda, fresh blueberries, fat free sugar free vanilla pudding and lite Cool Whip....it was a HUGE hit at our July 4th party! I believe that the size of the pudding is incorrect....believe it should be a 1.5 oz. box.

This was a very good, very light dessert.  I couldn't find an angel food cake in the store, so I had to make one from scratch, which made it a little more difficult.

Used this recipe as a base and changed it up. I wanted it red, white, and blue, so I used blueberries instead of bananas and used all fresh fruit. I made fresh whipped cream and a cake from scratch.

Yummy!  I personally don't like bananas, so we don't add bananas.  For a Fourth of July treat, we add fresh blueberries in the trifle.

I also used real whipping cream and substituted yogurt for the pudding (1/2 of each).  It gave it a lightness and tang that was delicious.  Everyone loved it.

This recipe is fantastic and gets rave reviews every time I make it.  I made similar changes as the other reviewers.  I make whipped cream from scratch sweetened with some sugar and a little vanilla.  I also use fresh strawberries.  It's the perfect light summertime dessert.  Thanks for sharing it!

I used "White Chocolate" pudding - using 1 can sweetened cond. milk and finished off the rest of the 3 cups with skim (cause thats what we use). Made my own whipping cream and added some strawberry sauce from a squeeze pkg. into the whipped cream - added yummy flavor and a pretty pink color. Skipped the bananas - just cause.
It was Fabulous!!

Made this tonight using gluten free yellow cake instead of angel food cake.  This is a light refreshing desert that is perfect for summer BBQs!
**update**  I made this for our 4th of July BBQ.  I used white chocolate pudding for one layer and banana pudding for the 2nd layer. I also added some fresh blueberries to the fruit layers.  The blueberries really add a nice surprising burst of flavor.  Plus, this dessert is just beautiful.  When I  brought it out everyone ooooh'd and aaaaah'd!  I would suggest making it a day ahead of the time you want to serve it so that the pudding layers are exceptionally cold.  Perfect summer time dessert!

I make this every year and it's always a hit! I took this to a family get together last week and it was literally gone in minutes. Everyone wanted to know who made it. So simple to make and doesn't take much. If i have strawberries that aren't very sweet I'll soak them in some sugar in the fridge first. And I don't like cool whip, tastes funny to me, so I make whipped cream. Great recipe!!

I loooove Trifle. I completed this recipe almost exactly (I used fresh strawberries, swirled with a little strawberry preserves for sweetness). I then made a thin cheesecake, let it set, and used cookie cutters to cut out star shapes, which I set around the top of the trifle, along with some silver and gold dragees. Gorgeous and light enough for the holidays or even july!!!

This is ridiculously easy & it makes a beautiful appearance!! As other suggested, I made my own whipped cream to which I added a bit (1 teaspoon) of Splenda for sweetness.  I also added a sprinkle of nut & honey granola to each layer for a little crunch.

This was absolutely awesome!!!  I'm sure it is great following the recipe but I made these changes:  Left out the bananas and used 2 lbs (or more) of fresh strawberries (I don't think you can have too many), sliced them & added 1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar to make them syrupy and used extra creamy non-dairy whipped topping.   The perfect summer-time dessert.  And it's pretty, too : )

I am in the process of making this recipe right now, I just wanted to comment that for the pudding it says 1 (5 ounce) package, but it should be a 1.5 ounce package. This could be confusing fir some, so I just thought I'd point it out. It does look delicious already and I haven't even started layering yet ? Also, I'm adding blackberries and bananas to mine, just in case anyone feels like copying me.

This was very good, I had to change it a bit as to what i had on hand and the time restraint.  I had pound cake that I cubed up, used real whipped cream and I mixed it with the pudding.  I found some individual trifle dishes so I used those and wow it tasted great.  My 13 month old neice couldn't get enough of it,  thanks for a great recipe

This trifle is delicious and adaptable to all tastes.  I make this in the summer for my husband and I because it is a healthier alternative for dessert.  I have even made it before by using sugar/fat free chocolate pudding and omitting the bananas.  Still, this trifle is perfect as is written.  I like to use fresh, locally grown strawberries in the summer when I can get them. Be sure to blot the strawberries really well after washing so that they will not become watery in your trifle.  It is yummy to substitute strawberry angel food cake for the regular if you can find it.  You can also mix it up with french vanilla cool whip for another variation.  This will only keep for about 2-3 days max in the fridge so be sure to eat it up fast.

So good! I made 5 large individual servings using this recipe, without altering the ingredient proportions. 3 were "child-sized" portions (the serving was *more than* sufficient to have been adult-sized) using 8 oz glasses, the other 2 servings were wine-glass sized. The only other thing I did differently was to use the whipped cream recipe submitted by Paula to this site in place of store bought. Another AllRecipe score...thanks a bunch!

This was so quick and easy AND YUMMY!  It was nice to have a fruit dish in the dead of winter for a change.  I also added a small can of crushed pinapple after the strawberry layer - reminds me of a banana split.  Excellent!!

I thought it was wonderful.  I customized it for 6 and used fresh strawberries, frozen blueberries, and the whole package of the instant pudding.I also used thinly sliced bananas. I followed the directions on the pudding box and used 2 cups of milk. I also used a butter pound cake instead of the angels food.  It was very light and we all had seconds.

Wow!!  This is so yummy ~ It was gone in 2 days (between 4 people).  I'm making it for the second time in two weeks.  I used sugar-free pudding mix, and fat free cool whip.

I live in England, and have a really hard time finding the ingredients that I need, by the same name, so needless to say, I have to improvise.  Instead of Angel Food Cake, I use pound cake, and instead of pudding I used cold custard, I also think that you need more custard/pudding than the recipe calls for, my first layer had plenty, the second not so much.  As for the fruit I used, I used really whatever I had, mango, blueberries, rasberries, and bananas.  They also don't have cool whip here, so I used a extra heavy whipping cream mixed half with yogurt, it was awesome!  I never really make dessert, but was asked to bring one to a cookout...it turned out wonderful and everyone loved it! I will definately do this again and again!

I served this for guests on a warm summer day, it was a big hit.  What I did different was use fresh fruit (strawberries, blueberries, & raspberries-no bananas).  I whipped my own cream instead of cool whip and folded the cream into the pudding mix.  I used Angel Food cake and did NOT have a soggy or watery problem like some people mentioned, perhaps because of the fresh fruit.  I will certainly make this again.

Made this at the Hubby's request for his Birthday yesterday and he loved it.  Everyone agreed it was absolutely wonderful.  Only change I made was in using butter pound cake in place of angel food, IMO it doesn't end up soggy if there happens to be left-overs.  Drizzled some hot fudge on top with a dusting of crushed nuts to finish it off and voilà ~ perfect.  Thanks Prissycat for this easy yummy sweet treat.

I love this and made it for the 4th of July. I used a red and blue colored Red Velvet cake and I added some blue berries to achieve the colors that I wanted. I also used a star cookie cutter to make stars out of the cake. Everyone loved it.

YUM YUM YUM!!!!! So I made a few changes but still giving this recipe 5 starts because IT IS SO DELICIOUS! I made angel food cake from a box in a 9x13 pan so it was easy to cut into squares.  I used 1 packet of fat free/sugar free vanilla pudding and 1 packet of fat free/sugar free chocolate pudding.  I put them in the fridge to chill while the angel food cake was cooking in the oven. (PS instead of using water for the angel food cake, I used skim milk, it gives it such a soft nice consistency!) I used only an 8oz can of cool whip.  I mixed half of it with the vanilla pudding only, and used the rest as the last layer of my trifle for a nice presentation! First layer diced up angel food cake, second layer vanilla custard, followed by my fruit (strawberries, blueberries and banana), then start again with angel food cake layer and then CHOCOLATE pudding. Put in the fridge for about 15 minutes. Take it out and spread the remaining half of cool whip, and make it look pretty with strawberries, blueberries and fruit of your choice!  **Tip: to make sure your bananas don't turn brown after you dice them, put them in a bowl of orange juice for about 5 minutes before layering them into your cake!

Enjoy, this recipe is AWESOME and very easy to change up according to your liking! =)

Very simple, easy recipe. I would add more strawberries next time. I prefer the pound cake with this but angel food is healthier.

This is truly the perfect light dessert after a heavy meal. This is what I used, french vanilla pudding, real whipped cream, strawberries blueberries and bananas and ladyfingers sprinkled w milk(bc I wanted them to taste like cake,not cookies). Perfect, and make a lot! prob 15 servings or so...reminds me of strawberry shortcake. Tis recipe is very versatile as you can use almost any fruits/pudding/cake. For the person who had a soupy mess, make sure you dry ur fruit after washing. I put mine in a strainer to get all the liquids out. Enjoy!

I use cherry pie filling crushed pineapple bananas and layer that between a yellow cake torn in pieces w/pudding and cool whip - sometimes I make my own whipped cream and add cream cheese or sour cream either one to it, that seems to make it less runny and then I garnish it with strawberries and marchachino cherries and chopped pecans it makes a ton just using 1 cake I usually use a punch bowl to make the layers in. Never any leftovers

Oh my goodness this is delicious!!! Cannot wait to make it again! The youth at our church love this and the more strawberries the better. This is a great fourth of july dish or for any pot luck lunch/supper. It makes a lot and definitely eat it the day you make it. Be prepared to feed a lot of people, at least 10 unless someone REALLY loves strawberry shortcake! haha

Delicious! I made some slight variations based on other recommendations: Used pound cake instead of angel food; replaced bananas with blueberries, used homemade whipped cream instead of Cool Whip.  Folks could not get enough! Great recipe - thank you!

this was so easy and quick. I made my own whip topping and fresh strawberries and bananas but used French vanilla pudding. I only did the one layer in single servings because I was going to have a bunch of children over and I thought it would be fancier and special to have little custard style bowls and glasses filled with this recipe. And it totally worked to my advantage and The recipe made a quick and nice addition to the meal I threw together. This can work practically with any type of pudding and mixture of fruit. Thanks the kids loved.

Great foundation recipe. Beautiful layering. I used pound cake instead of angel food. I used cheesecake pudding and folded in whipped cream for more of a mousse layer. Used fresh strawberries. Even used made a puree with some of the strawberries to soak the cake. I left out the bananas..........because I don't like bananas :)

Simple but good. Refrigerate everything and then serve right away because it will get soggy if leave it together too long before serving.

This was a big hit. I think it tasted more like banana pudding with strawberries mixed in so I might incorporate more strawberry flavor with, let's say, the whipped cream or something but would have to try it to say for certain. Anyways, good recipe, I just wouldn't refer to it as a Strawberry Trifle as that is not the primary flavor.

This was FABULOUS! I took the suggestions of others and added some blueberries along with the strawberries.. great addition! I found that there wasn't enough cake between the layers though, so next time I will probably use 2 cakes.

I made this for a get-together with another family.  It was easy to make and tasted delicious.  I used fresh berries because I had some in the fridge already.  I would try this with blueberries and/or raspberries too.

OMG - this is AWESOME!  I made this for a baby shower over the weekend.  I used fresh strawberries and mixed the pudding with the whipped topping.  It was so light and delicious!  The entire bowl was gone in an instant.

Made this for Mother's Day for my mom, she loved it!  I used only strawberries (by request from her) and real whipped cream.  I made my own angel food cake 3 days before to let it sit for a couple of days (it turns out much better if the cake isn't fresh, it doesn't go soggy when in the trifle!) then made the trifle the day of.  Was delish!  My parents requested that I make this now for every occasion.  Thanks for the great recipe!  :)

Very good! My first Trifle...I made it for Christmas, b/c I messed up a cake I was making for my birthday and instead of throwing the cake out I used it for the trifle. It reminded me of summer..so will make it again this summer. :)

Wow, great recipe. This literally took less than 20 minutes from start to finish. I followed everything exactly, except I omitted the bananas. I decorated the top with sliced strawberries. The trifle did not last! Next time, I will incorporate blueberries for my color effect!

This was very good.The one change I will make next time would be to only use 2.5 to 2.75 cups of milk in the pudding. Found it was a bit runny for me. Also I added some blueberries and used lite whip topping.Thanks, will make again & again...

I did a few things differently:  I used cheescake pudding and only 2 banannas.  Next time I think that I would use more strawberries though.
I made this for my grandmother's 75th birthday party and everyone LOVED it.  Even Great Aunts were asking for the recipe!!

I made this on Mother's Day and served it as a second dessert (with a candle in it for my uncle's birthday) and everyone LOVED it!!  It was so good that it was requested again 2 weeks later for our annual Memorial Day bbq.  Again, nothing but compliments! 

This is a great and QUICK recipe that can be personalized or tweaked however you please.  The only changes I made were that I combined the vanilla pudding with the Cool Whip and I also used pound cake instead of angel food.  So instead of 5 layers, my trifle was only 4 - well, 3.5 b/c the strawberries and bananas kinda blended together too....it was cake, strawberries, bananas, pudding/cool whip.  YUM!

Yum!!  This was a great recipe that I elaborated on based on some other reviews...I whipped my own cream and combined that with the cool whip.  I also included a layer of frozen blueberries (kept the bananas too though).  This also made for a very pretty presentation.  We did have some leftovers the next day but I did not find them to be "soupy" at all.

Great, simple and tasty dessert.  Beautiful presentation.  The only change I made was I used vanila wafers instead of pound or angel food cake.  Layered wafers throughout and placed them vertically around the dish, kinda like a banana pudding.

This recipe tastes like banana pudding.  If you like banana pudding, it's great.  I think I'll try it again but will use lemon pudding with a berry mix (strawberries, blueberries, rasberries).  No banana!

My son's football team loves this dessert!  I have made both Vanilla (cheesecake pudding) and Chocolate versions.  The Vanilla is more popular in our house.

I made this using fat free/sugar free cheesecake flavored pudding and fat free/sugar free whipped topping. No one knew and it was devoured. I also omitted the bananas,, and sprinkled slivered almonds on top.

This recipe was well liked. I did make a few changes. I cut up a pound cake that I made from a recipe on this site that my family really didn't care for. I hate to waste, so I found this recipe and cut the cake into small chunks. I took the advice from a reviewer to use vanilla pudding and cheesecake pudding and ommitted the bananas. My husband said to add the bananas next time. I will definitely make this again.

I thought this was much better than some other trifles that I have had.  I used both fresh strawberries and blueberres, in addition to the bananas, and I made individual trifles in balloon wine glasses, some with vanilla and some with chocolate pudding.  They were very pretty and tasted great.  I liked the suggestion about using light whipped topping and folding some of it into the pudding--I will definitely do that next time, because it was much sweeter than I expected.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I made this for a gathering at a friend's home...it was the hit of the evening!  I picked strawberries in the morning, sliced them and added a small amount of sugar.  Later in the day, I assembled the trifle.  I used cheesecake pudding, but only had a 3.5 oz box, so I reduced the milk to 2 1/4 cup.  I also whipped some heavy cream with a bit of sugar instead of the whipped topping.  This was an awesome dessert, and will make it again and again!

I used fresh strawberries, real whipped cream, and 1 3.4oz package vanilla pudding mixed with 1 3.4oz package cheesecake pudding.  It was beautiful, but didn't taste as good as I'd hoped.  It was light and fluffy but too sugary for me.  I would have preferred plain angel food cake with strawberries.  Maybe next time I'll try pound cake and a real homemade custard.  But, it did look beautiful and everyone commented on it at our Easter bbq.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe after making it. Very messy in preparing and presentation, I would definately recommend fresh strawberry, I used frozen strawberries and the liquid made the desert quite soggy. Although it was tasty, I won't make again.

I made this cake for my always-dieting-friend for her birthday.  It was a big hit with everyone!  I used light chocolate mousse in place of the whipped topping and light pudding too.  I also used fresh strawberries like other suggested.  The chocolate mousse went so well with the fruits!  I used a tiny little bit of whipped cream on the top, to make it look better.  Thank you for this recipe, I will make it again!

This recipe is wonderful!   My only change was using blueberries instead of bananas and also fresh strawberries.   I sliced the strawberries and lined them along the side of the trifle dish and they looked so pretty.

so easy, so good.  I have made this twice now and have added extra fruit, really you can use any thing you want. Last time I made it the day before and left in the fridge I think it was even better.

Very good and easy to prepare. But not so light! The combination of whipped topping and pudding makes it a very filling dessert. I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen ones.

I think this is really good, but inside I used homemade whip cream and fresh strawberries because they way better than frozen.

This was wonderful. The only change I made was to make my own whip cream and then fold it in with the pudding mix. I then whipped that mix and put the trifle together. This was a hit and even one of the pickiest eaters at the table enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing it!

Great recipe. I subsituted pound cake for angel food as suggested. I'm a chocolate lover, so I used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla. I used less milk than the box suggested for the pudding. It makes it a bit thicker, so the dessert was not 'mushy' at all. Also added a layer of strawberries cut in half on top of the last layer of whipped cream.

I made this recipe for a friend and it turned out great. While he liked the proportions, I think I could have used less vanilla instant pudding. Oh and I added blueberries, which added a nice extra zing. The strawberries and blueberries I used were all fresh, as I couldn't have imagined using frozen ones. That probably would have been a nightmare! Yummy, yummy dessert--thanks for sharing :)

My MIL is battling high cholesterol, so I found this in an attempt to make a dessert she could eat. I made this and a chocolate cake the same night, and this was ALL eaten, and more than half of the cake was left!!! My son raved on and on and even said that this is the dessert he wants for his birthday. I wouldn't change a thing...this is great just like it is!!!
DELICIOUS!!

Great trifle.  Used sugar-free vanilla pudding and sugarfree angel food cake so the diabetics had something to enjoy.  Perfect ending to our meal!

The directions are a bit confusing.  We used three, 1oz boxes of SF-FF Jello Instant Pudding mixing each box with 1 3/4 cups milk.  This makes beaucoup pudding.  Layered as follows:
Bottom :  Angel Food, pudding, blue and black berries
2nd: Angel Food, pudding, strawberries and red raspberries
3rd: angel food, Cool whip on top and sides, blue and strawberries arranged decoratively. The third layer was about 1" less radius than 2nd layer so it looks like a white pedestal with fruit.

This has become a family tradition and all our friends and family ask me to bring it to potlucks. I'm Celiac, so I make gluten free cake instead of using angel food, and it turns out marvelous. I also use real whipping cream and icing sugar instead of frozen topping. It makes it much nicer.
I have also made this using chocolate cake and chocolate pudding and it's marvelous!

I loooooove trifle! This was my first time making it and SUCCESS. Very easy, and simple to follow. I just substituted apple pie filling (I have a lot of jarred goods from the parents!) instead of strawberries and added pecans and bananas in the layers as well. I also used real whipped cream and butterscotch pudding.  It was gone in seconds!

This was amazing!! A delicious light dessert, perfect for summer. I halved the recipe and made a few changes:
1. soaked the angel food cake in ~2 TB sherry for 3-5 min.
2. used instant french vanilla pudding and almond milk
3. fresh strawberries, no bananas

I can't believe how good this was. A definite winner.

When I finished making this dish, it was too beautiful to eat! It was delicious but I made a few changes. Because my husband is diabetic, I used sugar free pudding, used whipping cream and added Splenda. I also added blueberries. This was a huge hit with our company and easy to make. I will definitely be making this again!

I had an accident with an angel food cake.  This recipe was my saving grace.  I didn't use bananas because I didn't have any and I used fresh strawberries.  It was the 4th of July so I colored the pudding blue.  It was a big hit.  Even my aunt who doesn't like angel food cake loved it.  I will be making it again and again!

Rarely give a 3* rating but vanilla instant pudding just does nothing for what could be a lovely trifle. If you must use instant then try the white chocolate instant pudding, but best of all make your own custard because it isn't difficult.  Lots of recipes on the web.

Fantastic.  Very easy to make.  I didnt like the banana taste, so 2nd time I made it I left them out & put in blueberries instead.  Made with Sugar Free Instrant Pudding & 'Lite" Cool Whip.  Family loved it !

Made two changes, but the outcome is definitely worth 5 stars for ease, taste, and presentation.  First change was I made my own whipped cream and secondly I left out the bananas.  I didn't have a chance to let it sit in the fridge long (1 hour) and it was still YUM.

I love this recipe.  I have made it several times and it is always a hit.  So simple and so pretty.  I like to add blueberries.  They taste good and add a little more color.

Everyone that tried this liked it a lot! I halved the recipe and it worked well. I used a pre-made pound cake instead of angel food, and fresh strawberries. Light and fresh!

This was last nights dessert and it turned out great.  I did modifiy it a bit, but went along the same lines as the original.  I used dessert bowls to make them individuals.  I used SF cheesecake flavored pudding, 1% milk and Lite whipped topping.  My husband and son kept saying how great it was.  It was a very nice change to our usual cake or ice cream desserts.

I used fresh strawberries (which I recommend if at all possible), but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and loved the results! Perfect for my ladies' night potluck.

My goodness! This was one of the best desserts I have ever had, let alone made myself. I have been eyeing this recipe for a while now but read from another reviewer that it doesn't keep well overnight so I have been waiting for a time when I was cooking for a large group. And let me tell you... This is SO refreshing and simple, yet luxurious. I did exactly what the recipe said to do, and I was blown away by the results. I even got a little carried away with the pretty designs of strawberries and bananas, but man it looked as wonderful as it tasted. I will definitely make this again for every other group function I host now! :)

Excellent!! I took it to a Bar B Q, there was nothing left but the empty bowl. I, too, used cream cheese pudding and added Cool Whip to the pudding (for time sake). It made it nice, light and airy. This is a nice recipe to make when fresh strawberries and blueberries are in season. Yum!!

I make this several times a year  My version is with non-fat sugar free pudding, fat free Cool Whip and non-fat milk. I ALWAYS soak the strawberries in a bit of cream sherry or other liqueur(real English trifle!) Can even be made in individual parfait glasses!

We thought this was good, but some weren't crazy about the bananas in it.  It's a very light tasting dessert.  I might try making it some time with the sugar-free pudding and whipped topping.  I would make this again and recommend it.

Easy, delicious, and could be varied in any number of ways. Trifles are so much easier than a traditional cake in my opinion, and many times they end up looking even better than something much more time consuming.

I made some changes to this recipe: I made my own whip cream using heavy cream, vanilla, and sugar, french vanilla pudding instead of vanilla, and mixed strawberries with strawberry glaze. It was DELISH!! I took it to church last night and it was gone in minutes. Great recipe!

Beautiful, easy, and a big hit at parties! The only change I made with the recipe was to use pound cake instead of angel food, but that is just b/c it is what I had on hand. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for my Neice/God daughter's baptism party last weekend & it went over well.  The slight variations I made were to omit the bananas & also used french vanilla pudding.  I doubled the strawberries to accomodate the loss of the bananas & before adding them to the mix sprinkled a small amount of sugar over them after they were sliced up since they were a little tart.  Loved how this turned out & also recieved alot of compliments on how pretty it looked.  :)

Wonderful!  Super easy and a huge crowd pleaser.  Some one gave me a trifle bowl for a wedding gift with a recipe and some ingredients... it has become one of my favorite gifts!  Since, I have done the same for another bride and I passed this recipe on to her.  It has been a huge hit!

Everyone always loves this and begs me to make it!  I did make one change- I put the frozen strawberries into a mixture of strawberry jello (large package) and just the hot water called for on the package.  Once the jello was starting to set, then I used this mixture over the cut up angel food cake for each layer.  Fresh cut up bananas in the layers also are good if the trifle will be eaten right away.

This made a delicious LOW FAT dessert! I used fat free milk and sugar free pudding. Delicious and light. Husband loved it! Do have all your ingredients ready to go and then make the pudding because instant pudding sets up fast. I might try adding some chocolate syrup next time as well. Will definitely make again!

Delicious!!  I did have some trouble with my pudding not being thick enough.  I used skim milk, next time I will try maybe 2%.  I also used a sour cream angel food cake from the grocery store and it was so good!!  Can't wait to make this desert again.

Really tasty and easy to make.  I found it was still okay the next day...the bananas didn't go too brown, although you probably would want to serve it fresh if serving to guests!

This recipe was very good. I don't have a trifle bowl so I used my punch bowl. It holds 16 cups. So I used 2-103g packages of vanilla pudding and 2-1Litre packages of fruit and also 2 1-litre tubs of whipped topping. This filled the bowl to the top. I kept out some berries to garnish the top.

My family loved this.  I will try pound cake next time to see if it holds the juices a little better as it did get runny the next day.  I used fresh strawberries and light whipping cream.  Thanks!

Yummy recipe! One review suggested putting lemon juice on the bananas to keep them from turning brown; I toss them in with a little lemon lime soda (such as 7Up)to avoid the sour taste in the finished recipe.

I've taken this dish to several potlucks because every last morsel is ALWAYS eaten!  I use a combination of fresh strawberries, sliced bananas, and frozen blueberries.  I baked the angel food cake (from a box) one time when I couldn't find an already-baked one at the store and it was still a super easy and tasty recipe.  Thanks, it's delicious!

This was so easy and delicious--and low fat! I did make a few changes though. Other reviewers said it was very banana-y so I used fresh strawberries and fresh blueberries instead. I also used pound cake. I brought this red, white and blue dessert to a 4th of July BBQ and it was a huge hit! It looked beautiful too.  Also, because of the fresh fruit and pound cake, it held up well for a few days!

This was my first attempt at a trifle and the perfect recipe. I followed the recipe -- though I used fresh rather than frozen strawberries. Easy and delicious. Though, I need to work on my presentation as it looked a little "messy" but the taste made up for it.

This was quick and easy, and I made it with leftover angel food cake!  It was delish.  I used a good portion of the 16oz tub of cool whip, and also added blueberries.  My husband loved this.  I am going to bring it to my friends house for dessert next month! Easy and impressive looking!  :o)

This was fantastic!  I used fresh strawberries, 1/2 vanilla 1/2 cheesecake pudding (two reg boxes with 3 cups milk), no bananas and light cool whip.  Should have taken a picture as it looked quite different from the one posted here.  Anyway, it was very creamy and the blend of flavors was great!  I'll definitely be making again...but only with fresh strawberries!

This dessert was so good. I made it for a Sunday dinner. I had friends and family over after church and it was a hit. There was none left. My mother made a bananna pudding and everyone wanted more of my dessert. It was my first time trying so I only made one. I guess next time I will have to make more! Thank you so much for this recipe, I will make this again just to show off.

This recipe was pretty good. Used pound cake, frozen strawberries, vanilla pudding mix and whipped cream.  Brought it to a weekly meeting where I bring desserts each week and people said it was good but nobody raved about it like they usually do about my desserts.

This recipe is DELICIOUS!! I made this for a family reunion and EVERYONE loved it. I put some blueberries in it to give it color and also used a premade pound cake and it was just so good and pretty to look at. I would use a larger trifle bowl next time because I barely had enough room for all the ingredients but this is SPECTACULAR!!!

Yum! I used fresh strawberries and pound cake, be sure to slice it really thin. I think I'll try the angel food cake next time. I added 2 tsp of almond extract to the pudding, and I think it complemented the strawberries brilliantly. We'll be making this again and again - it was so easy and delicious! Thanks!

EDIT: I've made this at least 4 times since I wrote that review. Since then I've found a strawberry angel food cake at Henry's Market (aka Wild Oats). That and using white chocolate pudding mix, fresh strawberries, and light cool whip has made a great recipe - HEAVENLY!!!

I made this not so long ago. I absolutely loved it. I cut down on many of the products that contained a high in fat/carb percentage and substituted with low carb/fat. It was very delightful. Both my husband and I loved it. I did leave out the banana, because I figured that the vanilla pudding would inded give it a banana taste after all. I am glad I did that because adding banana would have been a little too much. I also used fresh strawberries instead of frozen. What a difference. Thanks for sharing.

This was so good!  I took the advice of others and coated my bananas in lemon juice, I used fresh strawberries (sliced) and I used a lemon cake instead of angel food.  It was a huge hit!  I was concerned that it would get soggy or runny but I did not have that problem.  Such a simple recipe it will be used time and time again.

I had made this dessert for my son's $ boyfriends birthday party - everyone just loved it. I did use frozen strawberries as we cannot get good strawberries at this time of year in WI, I drained and rinsed the frozen strawberries very good before adding them to the recipe.  I also made a boxed Vanilla cake instead of the angel food cake. After slicing the bananas I did pour lemon juice over them and drained well to prevent them from browning! This was a big hit with the guests.

This was sooo good. I bought all the ingredients sugar free and fat free and it was still super sweet. Even my picky boyfriend loved it!

The only drawback is that it does get kinda soggy and mushy fairly quickly. Not a good recipe to keep overnight.

Fantastic and Easy:
This makes a very large bowl,and every bite is wonderful. I am making this for my Ladies Church group meeting. It is wonderful and light, a great
dessert after a large meal. I did not change a thing, but this would be great even if you just mixed it all togeather.

This recipe was great!  I made it for Mother's Day.  It tasted wonderful and had a beautiful presentation!  I used a pound cake instead of the angel food cake.  Next time I might try it with a lemon pound cake or lemon pudding.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this and used pound cake & fresh strawberries.  The pound cake held up a lot better than the angel food cake would have--not as mushy.  Everyone loved it.

I really didn't care for this and neither did my husband.  Which surprized me, cuz he usually likes everything. 
I think it was just to mushy for us.  I might try it again but without banana. 
Oh and I used fresh strawberries... I couldn't image this with frozen....it would have been even more mushy-ier.   (Is that a word  :)  )

I loved this recipe!!!  I made two, one using French Vanilla pudding and one using lemon.  The lemon was definitely a hit!  Although two seemed to be too much for my party of nine people, it somehow disappeared by the end of the night!  A great healthy and light dessert.

It's a great recipe, but I had success with the following substitutions.  I substituted a pint of heavy whipping cream for the cool whip sweetened to taste (about 2 T sugar) and flavored with 1 tsp vanilla extract...but it would have been better if I had doubled the whip cream layer, it was so yummy! I also used a mix for the angel food cake. I think homemade cake would be even better, but that's my personal bias and the mix worked in a pinch. I used strawberries and blueberries as the fruit layer, unsweetened.  People at work raved about it!

I made this for Easter and all loved it and want it again. I made double the pudding  and I made my own sweetened whipped cream to make sure I have enough. I will purchase two angel food cakes next time and  I plan to make this again.

I made this for Easter brunch - everyone loved it.

Why 5 stars?
-Delicious
-Great for a crowd
-Easy.  I made it the night before and let it set in the fridge

What I changed:
-Made my own whipped cream.  Making your own is just so simple and you can add what you want: sugar, sugar substitute, vanilla.  Keep it simple, no added garbage like the "whipped topping" you buy at the store has in it.
-I used fresh strawberries and blueberries because they're in season.  
-I sprinkled slivered almonds on top right before serving.  The added crunch offers a nice texture


I'll definitely be making this again.

I made this for my family for Easter.  I made the following modifications and it came out delicious:

Banana pudding instead of Vanilla

Fixed the pudding by emptying the package into a large bowl, added 3 cups of milk and 1 /2 cups of the whipped cream.  Whipped together the ingredients 

3 cups of fresh strawberries sliced instead of frozen
Added a handful of blueberries
3 banana instead of 4

Layered according to instructions 

Everyone enjoyed it!  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Super easy to make.  I actually used a Godiva white chocolate pudding and folded in the whipped topping like another user recommended.  I also used fresh strawberries.  I feel like it needed more depth/texture, so I may try incorporating shortbread next time.  Overall, quick and easy - and tasty!

Delicious!  Made the following substitutions based on availability:  fresh strawberries instead of frozen, 1L of vanilla custard in lieu of pudding (no extra milk added), fresh whipped cream instead of whipped dessert topping.  Very easy to put together & has earned a place in the dessert rotation.

I made this but cheated. Layers of cake and fresh strawberries and dream whip but used a can of Devon Custard in the layers  instead of cream cheese (!). Much better, easier, tastier.

I made some changes based on other reviews.   I did use angel food cake but made a custard sauce using Bird's Custard Powder.  I folded about 1 cup of whipped cream into the custard. I layered the cake, fresh sliced strawberries and the custard sauce twice.  I then put sliced strawberries on top (didn't use bananas at all) and then fresh whipped cream when served.  Delicious! !

I used fresh strawberries and it turned out very well.  Will definitely add this to my "go to" quick dessert list.

Was a hit! Very easy. Banana flavour was a little strong. Next time will reduce by 1/4-1/2 the # of bananas.

I've made this recipe a couple times now and it's delicious. I just served it on the Fourth of July and got rave reviews from everyone.  I've always used fresh strawberries and homemade whipped cream, though I'm sure it would still be very good as written.

Excellent! I made some changes since we a diabetic in the family so I used sugar free pudding and cool whip. I also added some blueberries to celebrate Independence Day (red, white & blue).  I will be making this recipe again and again. I'm a huge fan! Thanks for posting it.

Next time I'll use fresh strawberries not frozen. I'll also use fresh pineapple instead of bananas. Everybody loved it. I used glass triffle bowl and the kids thought it looked really cool..I made pudding with skim milk and it was fine.

This is sooooo good.  I used fresh strawberries and made my own whipped cream.  For each layer I put a neatly lined row of strawberries for presentation.  It came out beautifully!  I also put sliced almonds on top.  It was such a hit at Thanksgiving that I was asked to bring it again for Christmas.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this for a friends birthday party and it turned out fabulous! I took some of the other suggestions and used regular white cake as opposed to angel food cake because it was going to have to sit overnight and I didn't want the cake to become too soggy...I'm really glad I made the substitution because it was perfect! Also I made homemade whipped cream instead of the cool whip, and I folded it directly into the pudding, this have it a lighter texture and made it easier to spread.

Took this to a BBQ, it was a complete hit.  Due to what I had on had, I modified the fruit a bit.  I used strawberries, 1 banana and lots of blueberries.  I was a wonderful mix.  Next time I use double the fruit though.

This was delicious! A total hit, I will definitely be making this again. Instead of using bananas and frozen strawberries, I used around 4 cups of freshly picked strawberries. It also looked beautiful in a glass trifle bowl. Fabulous dessert, I highly recommend it!

Made this for Father's Day and it got rave reviews from the family. Made it again a couple weeks later for a co-worker and again, everyone loved it. It's very easy to make. I sliced up fresh strawberries and used homemade whipped cream, so my prep time was a little longer.

This was perfect after a heavy meal. I made a light version with f/f-s/f vanilla and chocolate pudding, f/f whipped topping, and I used banana, kiwi and strawberries. I used a Duncan Hines angel food mix. YUM! It got big raves.

I made this for my birthday and it was better than a birthday cake! I made my own whipped cream instead of the topping and it made it nice and light. I also did the top layer in chocolate pudding and it reminded me of a Boston cream pie! Would definitely make again.

I too omitted the bananas but opted for frozen raspberries and FRESH strawberries instead of frozen.  The raspberries added a nice ZING! to the berry layer.  Instead of using vanilla pudding, I used cheesecake pudding and it was PHENOMENAL.

I brought this to a neighborhood BBQ and got raves! I added a layer of strawberry revel ice cream and kept the whole thing in the freezer for about 3 hours, then let it sit out about half an hour before serving. I also shaved some dark chocolate on top as a garnish. Delicious!

Love this! One of my favorite light desserts to make. I always use fresh strawberries and sometimes add blueberries too. I enjoy it with vanilla pudding and cool whip or real whip cream mixed together. Always gets eaten quickly but will hold up in fridge for 2-3 days.

I made some changes since I didn't want to end up with 18 servings.  I used the same amount of strawberries and pudding, but I used an 8 oz angel food cake instead of a 12 oz.  I probably only need 3/4 of the 8 oz cake, but it was still good.  I also only used about 1.5 cups of cool whip, and 2 bananas and added some blackberries.  It turned out great!

Our whole family loved it! My girls and husband made it for me for Mother's Day. One minor change-Instead of adding the banana slices to the trifle per the recipe, we placed them on top just before serving to keep them fresher.  Thanks for a great recipe! :~)

This is my favorite potlock recipe.  It goes over so well and it's light.  I've also used kiwis, raspberries, bananas, strawberries, blueberries and mandarin oranges.  I just pick my fruit depending on what sounds good the day I make it!

Awesome! My daughter needed to take a dessert to a birthday party so we made it together and it was a hit at the party.  I saved some out and made a small bowl for my 12 year old.  He said he licked the bowl clean.  I will make it for my family for Easter Dinner.

Awesome! Made this for my mother-in-law's birthday and she LOVED it! The royal treatment for sure. It was very easy to make. Looks fancy but done in about 15mins. (Easy to add other exotic fruits should you desire).

Easy and tastes great! We made 2 over the Christmas holidays and they were gobbled up.  Easy to put together but looks like you did a lot of work. We omitted the banana because of a family member with allergies and used real whip cream.

Very good!! I didn't put in any bananas just the strawberries and it came out wonderful. Even better than I thought. My husband loved it which is great because I made it for him for Fathers Day!

Very tasty recipe! I used real whipping cream instead of Cool Whip. It is a beautiful dish to take to a party and looks much harder than it is!

This had such good reviews, I thought it HAD to be good. But I wasn't very impressed. I changed a couple things, so maybe it's my fault. They didn't have premade angel food cake at the store so I made one from a box (it was really good!). I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen. But it just wasn't to die for, like the chocolate trifle is...or the reviews led me to believe. I probably won't try it again.

I took this to work for a spread we had and before I knew it, I had none left to bring home to my family! Will make again but only when there will be at least 10 people to feed.

*laughs*  This isn't one of those "Throw Together Just Before Dinner" things.  It was really super tasty, but boy was it ugly!  I tried to quickly defrost some frozen strawberries by running hot water over them - and they got oddly pale and really fall'y apart'y and almost gooey.  The (lite) Cool Whip was still partially frozen, too. Didn't get to chill for more than 45 minutes, but again - It was YUMMY!  DH LOVED it and told me "KEEP THIS ONE!"

I just made this dessert last night for a bbq and it was such a hit!  I had none to take home and there were only 4 adults and four kids there!  (ok maybe we're pigs)  The only thing I changed was blueberries for the bananas.  Great easy summertime treat!

Since I'm not a baker, this was the perfect recipe to make for Easter dessert.  I used two containers of frozen strawberries simply because we love strawberries.  I was able to make it Easter morning and it was not soggy at all by 5 p.m.  It makes a ton so no need to double the recipe!

This was really good! I made it with skim milk and fat free whipped cream. Needless to say it was a little runny. However, it was still delicious! My advice, just call it strawberry banana pudding~ people will gobble it up!

I used sponge fingers instead of cake, because that was what I had on hand.  At first, I thought I would have needed to sprinkle some kinda liquer or syrup just to 'wet' the fingers a litte so that it wouldn't be crunchy instead.  But it turned out FINE!  Strawberries and banana really go well together.  Used Kraft's Cool Whip which is pretty low in fat (0% trans fat), so it made for a luxuriously creamy sweet without all the icky guilt!  Must do again, and I'm thinking of canned mandarins and peaches this time for an Asian twist!

I made this for Christmas to take over my moms house and everyone loved it. Just about the whole thing was gone. I didnt use bananas but used a mixture of strawberries, rasberries, blueberries, and blackberries. Everyone wants me to make it at the next family get together.

This one is a keeper. And you can't tell if you use a light pudding mix and ultra low fat topping. I had a hard time getting in very many layers, so next time I will serve this in individual dessert cups for a nicer presentation.

I make this recipe all the time! Everyone loves it. It is easy to make and an almost guiltless dessert with lowfat whipped topping and sugar free pudding.

This trifle is so easy to make and tastes great.  I used pound cake, fresh strawberries and whipping cream as suggested by others.  It was a definite hit.

I have made this twice already.  It is so yummy and easy and quick and beautiful and flavourful.  WOW this is one of the best recipes I have ever made.  I used fresh strawberries.  Next time I will add another package of pudding as the rich creamy flavour is a great contrast to the cool whip.  If I have extra time it would be worth it to make homemade whip cream.  Thanks again to a new family fabourite recipe.

This was so light and had a great flavor.  I used fresh strawberries, and I did leave out the bananas because the person I was making it for doesn't care for them.  I'm thinking about trying it with cheesecake flavored pudding next time.

I used fresh strawberries, 2 bananas, frozen raspberries & blueberries & 3 kiwis. That's what's nice about these recipes, you can add or change just about anything :)

Excellent!  Everyone loves it every time I make it.  One thing to note, you need to add a little lemon juice to the banana or else they brown pretty quickly.  Adding a little lemon juice can make this dessert last a few days.

I made this for a Memorial Day party & it was good but not as tasty as I would have hoped.  I used Banana Cream instant pudding, a pound of fresh strawberries, made 2 layers each with an 8 ounce container of Cool Whip & let sit overnight.  I don't expect to make this again.

I made this recipe to "try" on myself and husband -- see if its a keeper.  We absolutely loved it!!!!!  I defintely wouldn't hesitate to serve this to our guests.  Wondering if anyone has also used pineapple in the recipe.  I think I will give it a try next time.

Nice, light, and simple. Very very yummy! I used Cheesecake flavored instant pudding, as suggested by someone else, and fresh strawberries. I also made my own whipped cream (with Splenda instead of sugar), very very good. Will be making this again very soon!

I took some suggestions and used a pound cake and it  worked wonderfully.  I also used kiwi instead of banana.  I made this dessert for Easter  and it was a hit.  Everyone loved it and it was plenty for 9 people.  I definitly reccommend this.  VERY easy.

Always a hit when I have made this for parties.  Great after Easter dinner.  Fresh strawberries definitely improve this is you can find good ones (depending on the time of year).  I like other reviewers suggestions of using lemon juice to prevent browning of the bananas. It doesn't affect the flavor when they brown, but I'm sure it would be even prettier if they didn't.

This was good but better on the second day.  Very pretty presentation!
