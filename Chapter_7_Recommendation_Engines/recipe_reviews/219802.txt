This was sooooo good, I did make alot of additions to this recipe though. I used the entire egg, also cut the recipe in 1/2 bc I only had1 lb of turkey. added cheese, put in 1/2 of the green ench sauce in the mix and topped the rest before putting in oven. small onion, garlic, rotel tomato sauce, cilantro, fresh thyme and oregano, canned mushrooms, and I used the homemade taco seasoning from this website as well. Really good, I cooked for about 1 hour at 350 and I had left overs from a family of 4. It was a huge loaf bc of all of the additions and it was sooo moist. I am def making this again! Thanks!

Wonderful recipe!!!  I did not change the recipe but I used better ingredients.  I used Cuban style black beans from Trader Joe's.  I used frozen fire roasted corn also from TJs. I used fresh Pico de Gallo from Fresh and Easy for the salsa and panko breadcrumbs.Used the whole can of green chiles-why waste them?  Made two meatloaves and it would be easy to freeze one.  Will make this again and again.  Thanks!

1 lb turkey + 1/2 lb beef + 1/2 lb sausage = Yum!  I omitted the green chiles, used 2 whole eggs, only 1/4c of bread crumbs, and sauced the top at beginning of baking only, put rest of sauce on table. It had plenty of flavor and moisture. I made these individual meat loaves in large (Demarle) muffin pan and regular size muffin pan as well (low carb version w/out corn or beans).  Cheese and sour cream on the side. I'll make these for my family again.

For a low fat, heart healthy recipe, this can't be beat.  It is so very tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I could not find enchilada sauce, so I swapped it for the bottle of taco sauce I had on hand.  Thank you for sharing it JRS_cook.

Lighter Mexican Meatloaf Haiku: "Five stars for the taste. Fiesta, funky meatloaf! But, crumbled too much." I'm normally a meatloaf purist with just the basic ingredients, so this was a fun change. Had to halve the recipe, having only 1 lb. ground turkey, but stuck w/ everything else as directed in the recipe. (Mine was more like 350 deg. for a little over an hr.) I used a mild enchilada sauce, which turned out to still have a little kick to it, so I had to scrap and salvage the sauce-less loaf bites for my little one. Husband and I agreed that since it was kinda fall-apartey, that we would've eaten it in a tortilla w/ some melted cheese and been happier that way, than trying to slice and serve it like a traditional meatloaf. Still muy delicioso!

Very good. Very moist.  I followed the recipe as written.  I had no issues with 'crumbling' as others have noted.

This was a big hit at my house. I used all turkey burger, all 4 0z of chiles ( could have use more ) I also used Taco sauce as that is what I had on hand. This will be great for make ahead meals for the freezer...

Shock!  With all that flavor, my husband said he didn't miss the beef!  I personally did, BUT I forgot to put in the egg whites - which would probably make a significant difference.  Also, use the size pan suggested!  It works better that way (moisture needs to evaporate - we used one tall, and two small flat pans).  -- Oh, we used Taco Seasoning I from this site.  It smelled delish even before mixing it into anything, let alone after putting the meatloaf in the oven! --  Love the lighter fare:  I served this with a 'no-point' cabbage soup with a Mexican flair - sorry, not from this site.  Also served with some tortilla chips since I didn't have time to cook brown rice, let alone lace it with cumin, minced-pickled jalapenos, and lime juice.  Next time, I will remember *the egg whites*, & I'll serve it with the cumin-rice.  Might put optional toppings on the table, such as FF sour cream, more jalapenos, diced avocado, sliced green onions, etc. - depending on how much time we have).  ---  last note:  I put this into three different casseroles (two small, one larger) - The loaf in the larger one was topped with crushed tomatoes since I didn't have all of the enchilada sauce called for.  That larger loaf was way too moist.  BUT MY SON WHO HATES MEATLOAF LOVED IT AS A DIP.....  Could be made in a skillet if one wanted to use it as a dip.  Very flavorful.  What's more, I didn't miss the beef then either (but then there were chips - it might be good in soft-shell tortillas, though)!

Loved it!!!  Kids were hesitant at first based on appearance but quickly changed their tune after the first bite.  The only thing I changed was using two eggs instead of three egg whites and I used about an additional 1/4 cup of bread crumbs.  The recipe made 2 loaves of meatloaf so we have dinner again.  Love this recipe, thank you!!

Made this recipe using an eight individual serving bake pan. Served with mash potatoes and green beans. Made cinnamon muffins for dessert. Wife and I ate two servings a piece. I even shared with my mother and little sister. Used extra salsa as a condiment. Will do this recipe many times more.

Made this exactly as written. I always follow exact instructions first  time I try a recipe taking into account reviews and suggestions. Then I decide if personal adjustments are needed. Will not change a thing next time I make this which will be soon as the family devoured it and begging for more. This has pizzazz without being overwhelming. It is simple to put together with little time involved. Big winner in my family and me the chef.

I love it when people say they made the recipe but they changed ingredients, added or removed ingredients, used better ingredients, etc. People, if you've done any of that you've created another recipe! I wish people would make the recipe as described and give their honest opinion. Either you liked it or you didnt.  Very simple.

I made this meat loaf to the letter, and when I pulled it out at 45 minutes, as directed, to put MORE enchilada sauce on it, it was still pretty moist so I didn't do it.  Sorry, for my liking, you don't "scoop out" meat loaf from a baking dish...it kind of crumbles like other reviews state, this is "almost" a taco pie or taco casserole...so changing the description would do a lot to prepare cooks for what they're gonna get.  The "meatloaf" WAS tasty, if crumbly. IF I make it again it will have black olives and chopped onions (what Mexican meat dish doesn't have onions?) and maybe just one whole egg, and only 15 oz. of sauce, undivided, and a whole cup of bread crumbs, I have to make it more like the meat loaf my family expects.

*****Very Different*****
We enjoyed it!  We combined a can of Medium & a can of Hot enchilada sauce together & it came out so yummy!  We also used the southwest black beans that already have jalapenos inside.  Mmm!  
As a side dish, we roasted new potatoes & mixed stoplight peppers with olive oil & fajita seasoning.  This warms up very well for leftovers too!

I used one can of Green Giant Southwestern Style Corn in place of the beans/corn. For the taco seasoning I used a Jalapeno flavor and I didn't use the chicken. This is YUMMY! Great receipt; low in fat and full of flavor.

The only thing I changed was that I used the whole egg instead of the whites.  Nothing else added, nothing else tweaked.  It's mouthwatering.  It's THAT good without doing another thing to it.  My family begs me to make it.

Made this for supper tonight.  It was great!  Husband and son liked it too.  Was worried that the mix was too soft because it wouldn't form into a firmer loaf but it turned out great and moist.  We topped it with sour cream and salsa.  Will definitely make again.  I'm looking forward to the leftovers.

Made this for dinner tonight. I didn't have ground chicken so I used all turkey, other than that I stuck to the recipe. My family loved this meal. I served it with cornbread and yellow rice. My husband pulled out some nacho chips and scooped up the meat with them and loved it that way too. I will definitely make this again.

I have to admit I made adjustments but I think it would have smelled just as divine if I hadn't! To make it gluten-free I used crushed tortilla chips in place of bread crumbs, mexican spices instead of the mix. I also used frozen instead of canned corn, all turkey, onion & bell pepper instead of chiles, 2 eggs instead of just whites and taco sauce instead of enchilada sauce (only because I had just made enchilladas last week). I will definately make this again and again, trying different variations, as it's so adjustable to one's preference. Yummy!

Very tasty. Next time I will try adding a medium onion and a can of black olives. And will top with cilantro and a squeeze of lime.

One of my husbands favorites.  I change only a few things, I use two eggs instead of eggs whites and chopped onions mixed in with loaf.  I also put on shredded cheese over the second round of enchilada sauce after 45 minutes. I use a combination of Colby and Pepper Jack.  Since there is only two of us I divided this into two meat loaves  cook one and freeze one for a later date.

It was very good! But also pretty mushy. Anyone know how to avoid this? I did as the recipe said, except one if the pounds of turkey was frozen then thawed..that could have been why..

Great recipe! Absolutely loved it. I used "Pain Is Good" Smoked jalapeño salsa and added Mexican shredded cheese. Since this Salsa is spicer than normal I didn't use the green chiles. I also added cheese on top while baking. Putting some fresh guacamole on top before serving is also great! The whole family loved it.

It was very good. Made exactly as written as I always do when trying a new recipe.  It did fall apart a but but who cares as long as it tastes good. May add some onion and garlic next time, but for a healthier meatloaf it was very good, hubby loved it!

This one's definitely a keeper in our house - easy, somewhat healthy and full of flavor.   I added some cooked quinoa (about 1/4 cup uncooked) to give the meat some texture and the rest of the flavors are easy enough to substitute based on what you have in the house.   For the topping, I used salsa  and ketchup, and it was really good.  Will definitely make again.

I found the enchilada sauce to overwhelm the meatloaf - especially the end pieces and it was very onion-y.  Next time i'll use less sauce (and probably a different brand) and sautee the onions first.  Huge plus - my boyfriend had no idea that this was made with turkey instead of beef.
