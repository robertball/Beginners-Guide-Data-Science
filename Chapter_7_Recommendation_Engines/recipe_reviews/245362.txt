The first time my husband and I experienced this was at a local restaurant - we absolutely loved it; my husband and found this recipe to be quite similar and very forgiving...as I decided to add some spinach and threw in extra paprika just to finish the jar.  This recipe is FULL of full of flavor and absolutely yummy...loved the addition of mushrooms.  We will definitely be making this over and over again!!!!

Wow! Absolutely amazing! I followed the recipe to a tee and it came out perfectly. The flavor of the combination of spices is so amazing. Really different than anything I've ever had before. My husband went crazy for it! It made for a wonderful and special Sunday morning breakfast. Thank you, Chef John, for this amazing recipe and great video! Glad I watched it a couple times before I made the recipe. Very helpful!

I usually make this recipe for brunch, and when my kids were young I used to add half  a cup of rice (already asked in water) after adding the tomato.  After 15 min. When the rice is almost cooked I make holes  on the surface and crack the eggs into these holes. Add some shaved cheese over the eggs, cover and let cook for 10 min or so. It makes a delicious , inexpensive dinner and I called egg in a nest. The kids love it, and it is easy to make.

I've followed this recipe and it's perfect. I actually make shakshuka every time I have leftover spaghetti sauce. The next day just add vegetables to your meat sauce and put your eggs in it!

I've already made this twice.  It is really good.  My husband is low carb and it is very much a challenge to vary his meals.  Meat and salad is all well and good but it is awesome when I find a recipe like this that I always have the ingredients for and take so little time.  I serve this over kale or spinach for him to fill out the meal.  Frankly I was surprised at how much I liked this, the egg adds a creaminess to the dish that is surprising.  Oh and I did use goat cheese as that is what I had.  Yummy

I definitely liked the texture of the mushrooms, eggs and feta.  I personally needed to up the spice amount and added some garlic but not as much as I usually would to try to keep the integrity of the recipe.  I liked this recipe and it's easy to make but I highly doubt my kids would eat it.   The feta made the flavours really pull together but the parsley was too demanding.

9 6 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/245362/chef-johns-shakshuka/ ... No one had any compliments, but that's unusual.  Nineteen year old boy - man, I mean :D - ate most of his big portion.  Nice!  I served it over grits with buttered Texas toast.  Used Italian brand, Dei Fratelli, diced toms instead of crushed, no water.  Spicy, but not too spicy.  Jalapeno was kinda wimpy though.  Liked this.  Oh, I wonder if the mushrooms should be half pound, not half cup.  Until just now, looking at the recipe, did I remember they were in there.  Next day, same male heated & ate leftovers!  Wahw.  :D  Yup, I'll repeat this one.

Great dish! I typically make to spec the first go round, but had to dial the heat back a little for the family. Used half the amount of jalapeño and cayenne. Still had a nice kick that my five year old could enjoy. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

EASY  VERY GOOD.  I liked this. I tend towards Italian meals and spices. However I like to try and branch out just because I know  I gravitate towards basil.  So , I followed this exactly except I used goat cheese instead of feta
and we both very much enjoyed.  I will  definitely make 
again for Sunday brunch or easy dinner..

really good and pretty easy to make, my dad said that he wanted me to make this every weekend and I said "well you should buy me the groceries then" and he said "I'll buy any groceries you want so long as you make that"

We really enjoyed this dish! I think I need to get better at my egg watching/cooking for this dish but since I don't care for runny eggs and hubby does, I start my eggs before his.

I love this hearty breakfast recipe, especially when it's on the dinner menu. I used green & red bell peppers with the jalapeño. I over cooked the egg -- I like mine fairly soft -- and it was still delicious.

I really enjoyed this meal.  I serve it on flat bread or a pita, great for soaking up the sauce.  I didn't have feta so I used a little grated cheddar mix.  Very nice.

This was so great for brunch, now I have enjoyed at every meal of the day. I added some fresh spinach too, mixed all the spices in a bowl and added together into the veggies and the ramekin was a good idea, great hints Chef John thank you...as always...ENJOYED!

I decided to make this for breakfast and I add pork chorizo to it and served corn tortillas with it and it was a winner.

Delicious! I omiten the jalapeños and added only a dash of the Cayenne pepper, because some at home cannot eat hot (very spicy) food.  Other than that, excellent.

This is my first Chef John recipe and I have made it twice. I followed Chef John's instructions and the family liked the results. The dish is simple and easily followed and was my first go at learning to cook outside of the traditional SAD diet. The next time this dish is made, I plan to try making it with less salt and maybe add a little roasted garlic.

I kept seeing this week after week in the vegetarian section and was skeptical to make something with eggs and tomatoes for dinner but I was so wrong. My husband gave it 5/5 which he's only ever given two other times.

I added some extra cayenne and served it over a little rice with some french bread.

This recipe is fantastic! I have made it several times already. I always have canned tomato products and some kind of peppers and eggs on hand, so I just make this using what I've got when I can! It's always a delight!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I used pablano peppers to create some color, baby belles for my mushrooms, & a tiny drop of carolina reaper paste for the bit of heat. I'm not a cumin fan so I used 1/2 a tsp cumin & a full tsp of both turmeric & paprika.

It is delicious & I've already made it twice!

This was great. I actually joined tonight just so I could review it. I did make some small changes. I replaced jalapeños with green chilis due to personal preference. I also used chicken stock rather than water. It was very tasty and authentic.

Yet another winner from Chef John! 
I wanted to keep a batch in the fridge. When "fully cooked" the peppers went too soft. So next time I made it I cooked for about half the time for what I wanted to store and finished cooking the portion to use immediately. Parcooking is fine because it's just vegetables in the sauce.

I lived in Morocco for a while, and a very similar dish is served there, and I came it love it. A street vendor shared the recipe with me, and when I read this one I realized it was almost identical. I made it as published, added 3 cloves of garlic, no mushrooms, and a pinch of Garum masala, and a splash of fish sauce for salt. The big difference is the recipe has a sticky rice added to it. I added 1/2 cup of Carolina gold rice, raw , and simmered for a while, poached eggs as directed, and garnished with goat cheese and fresh Italian parsley, at the time of serving. Amazingly, I accidentally hit the nail on the head. the nice thing is, you can refrig or freeze the unused portion of sauce, and run another batch of eggs thru it just by thinning and reheating.

Absolutely delicious.  I did leave out the jalapenos and garnished with spring onion and feta.  Everything else was the same.  Everyone from teens to grandparents enjoyed it.  A great option for vegetarians too.

This was delicious! I can’t have dairy so I didn’t add the cheese and can’t have oil so I sautéed veggies in water. It was still absolutely heavenly. I probably made it a little spicier than recipe.

Did not use mushrooms. Added 2 large cloves of garlic to onions and peppers and an 1/8 tsp. Of cinnamon to spices. Topped with cilantro. 
Very very good. Will definitely make again.

Such a tasty dish and a perfect addition to a vegetarian night rotation. We absolutely love it.

COOK'S NOTE: I now use (1) 14 oz can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes, (1) 14 oz can fire-roasted crushed tomatoes as opposed to the 28 oz can of crushed tomato. I like the texture better. Also, I now use roasted red peppers as opposed to fresh red peppers 1:1. I feel like the adjustment of these two items really makes a huge difference in flavor (and it's also more shelf-stable in case my dinner plans change over the week). Enjoy!

This is tasty; I've had it made starting with fresh tomatoes which I think I slightly preferred, but the additions here were nice. Tricky to get the eggs cooked right; wonder if I were doing it again if I'd just add poached eggs to it

I made it five times!  Each time it was wonderful.  Twice, I have added shrimp to the mix and it was delightful. 
I highly recommend this with slices of crisply toasted French baguette and a green salad.

Perfect. I didn’t change a thing except more mushrooms. Absolutely perfect and delicious! To each her/his own for preferences, but I think it’s a must for the yolks to be runny—to plunge the toast (or crisp ciabatta in our case) into that liquid gold deliciousness—then to spoon that rich, flavorful tomatoey goodness on and shove it into the mouth. Heavenly comfort food! It was also fun and easy to make! An instant favorite. Thank you Chef John! And I loved watching the helpful video prior to cooking!

Delicious. I added a tablespoon of my own garam masala in addition to everything else....(and will admit that I only very loosely measured the other spices) This will definitely be a staple at our house since my spring chickens have finally started laying. A great way to incorporate a meatless Monday to the week and use up some extra eggs! Serve with some Israeli flat bread and you are GOLDEN.

Really delicious, the spice combination is on-point. The first time I made it, I made it exactly as the recipe recommended. Second time, I made some adjustments. 1/2 cup of mushrooms is way too little! I watch the video and judge it based on how much it looks like he puts in. First time, we ate a whole loaf of fresh bread with it. Second time, I served it over polenta. First time, I felt like the crushed tomatoes were too runny and diced would have been better. Second time, I used fresh diced tomatoes (they're in season) which was great, but DEF OMIT THE WATER if you use fresh. Love this recipe and will keep coming back to it for sure.

This was pretty good. I did have to add a fair amount of salt, as the spices have kind of a pungent flavor. Could have used some garlic. Crusty bread is a must have with this recipe.

I left out the jalapeño because I can’t handle really spicy food. The cayenne gives just a hint of heat, and the rest of the seasonings are spot on! I also add spinach and homemade breakfast sausage to up the veggie and protein content. I prefer to cook my eggs separately. This is great served with roasted potatoes or toast!

For people on weight watchers this is an excellent meal. I saw the video and then tried to make it how I remembered it. Mine wasn’t spicy enough but the basics of the onion, tomatoes and poached eggs was excellent. Great recipe and low in points, a win-win. I did omit the cheese but that’s because I didn’t have any in the fridge. It would make this delicious sauce even creamier.

You know this is a great recipe because so many ingredients are interchangeable in amount and kind and it will still come out great.  I used over one cup of mushrooms (will definitely use 1.5-2 cups next time) and based upon the video, I used less of the Italian Parsley (Chef John says he used Italian Parsley in the video, then says traditionally it should be cilantro).  In any event, I don't think you can make this wrong.  An if you don't want to use eggs, it will probably work just as well with shrimp, scallops, beef, or chicken).  It is a great base to work with.  Also, I did not change any of the amount of seasoning used.

Brilliant. My wife has had shingles for 6 weeks and I have been chief cook and bottlewasher. Using a number of sites for recipes but this site and Chef John have become a favourite. Another winner with this one. Just enough spice and we loved the mushrooms too. Thanks Chef John.

This was wonderful.  We are converting to vegetarians slowly so I’m always looking for meals that look tasty and colorful.  Colorful means LOTS of health benefits.  We loved this dish and it was done in under an hour.  I didn’t substitute anything, and probably won’t next time either.  Will definitely make again.

Fabulous flavor! Another Chef John home run. He warned that the eggs would cook quickly, and I thought I was watching closely, but mine were overcooked. I'll see if I do better next time... The spiciness was fine for us, and we don't like very hot foods. (Followed the recipe exactly.)

I followed the directions as written and watched the video 
about three times. So this is no where near the sort of flavor I normally cook. At first I wasn't sure, but as I ate it more the more my guest and I liked it. Though I could not eat the egg, felt it didn't taste good with the dish. Could just be me . My guest and I also agreed this would be great as a topper to other foods. Like pasta or with some fried potatoes. I would make this dish again but with modifications.

We made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious. I made my own crushed tomatoes and should have probably not added the extra water, or cooked the sauce a tiny bit longer to reduce the water more. I might add a bit more of the spices next time for a bit more heat. The jalapeno I used was rather mild. I also only used half of the sauce for a dinner for 2 and saved the rest for another meal. It was more than plenty with some crusty bread to soak up the goodness.

Absolutely amazing dish! I took it easy on the cayenne, and omitted the jalapeño (I don't care for a lot of chili-type heat), but everything else was exactly to the recipe. It took a good amount of prep, but putting it together was a breeze. It smelled so good that we could hardly wait for the dish to cook! Size it up or down - it's perfect for 1, 2, or a dozen!

I really love this! Did not use jalapeño pepper because we don’t like it that hot but it was delicious.

Sorry can’t give this more stars. Love eggs that are poached in cheese and wine so that texture does not bother me. There is an extreme amount of sauce to egg ratio. The sauce was good by itself but we felt it overpowered the eggs and just not the best combination ever between tomatoes and eggs.  I would definitely put more mushrooms in but probably won’t make again. Loved the idea of how healthy it is though and know a lot of people love this flavor combination. If you do this is a great recipe

Made this last night for evening Sunday dinner.  Wife and I loved it.  Very warm and comforting on a cold, wet evening. 
 Next time I will ease up a little on the black and cayenne pepper, and I will plate up and serve the dish a little sooner.  As Chef John said, the dish is very hot and continues to cook the eggs after the flame is off, so serve up while the eggs are still a bit on the undercooked side if you want your yolks to remain runny.

Fantastic recipe! The hubby’s comment was, “The more I eat of it, the more delicious it is!” and went for seconds. I did use more mushrooms than 1/2c (about 6ozs), and I omitted the jalapeños and cayenne since others here don’t like spicy food. This is definitely being added to our rotation.

We Love It.  Only a few changes because I make this when I have nothing planned for dinner.  I use a small jar of roasted red peppers chopped up.  I like the flavor much better than fresh for this recipe.  Also, I use diced jalapeno peppers from a jar if I don't have any fresh jalapeno.   I then take Naan bread, brush on some olive oil, sprinkle a little garlic power and roast in a non stick pan.  Everyone loves this too.

Love this recipe and come back to it often.  The only change I made was using goat cheese instead of feta.  I love the flavor of goat cheese and it paired so well with this recipe.  I could eat this every day.

Have made several times and it gets better and better each time. We enjoy adding garlic, increasing the seasonings by 1/4-1/2 tsp, an additional jalapeño, and some chorizo/ground sausage for an intense, full flavor.

Best Shakshuka we’ve ever had or made..... That being said we’ve never has Shakshuka before. But it was delish! I’d add garlic to the onions and mushrooms for a little more flavor.

This is one of my favorite breakfast recipes. I have made it 6 times now and it's just as good each time. Even my kids love it and they usually balk at the idea of peppers. I have also used the leftovers and mixed with chorizo, yellow bell pepper and egg whites to make a lovely breakfast taco. Absolutely delicious. Thanks!!!

I made a Whole30 version of this recipe where I added some ground turkey and served it over baked sweet potato chunks to make it a little more filling.  The flavors were intense without being overpowering. It was off the hook-a!  I'll definitely make it again.

Quick & easy.  Made with ingredients I had on hand so there were some slight alterations.  Used canned green chillies (no fresh jalapeño on hand), and substituted Colby/jack cheese for feta (which we do not like).  Added a bit of diced ham and finely diced zucchini which I had in the refrigerator and served with flour tortillas.  We enjoyed it for an early dinner before a rehearsal.  Will probably make some version of this again.  Should be good for brunch.

Loved it.  No jalapeno on hand, so I added a wee bit more cayenne.  Not a fan of feta, so substituted shredded cheddar.   Still have some leftover sauce in the fridge, for the weekend.

This is a fantastic way to start your day or as we did, made it for Brunch. Huge hit with the family! Incredible flavor and the richness of the egg yolks mixed with the acidity of the tomatoes and kick from the spice combination is a dish that will haunt your dreams!!

This was great!  I used baby yellow and red bell peppers in place of the red and a shredded Mexican blend cheese (that’s what I had on hand and look forward to making it again with goat or feta cheese).  I also used cilantro per Chef John’s suggestion in the video.  In addition to the toasted bread, I served it with a roasted riced cauliflower recipe that I found on another recipe website that included cumin and cilantro.  Yummy and less carbs than regular rice.

I like this tip break up my usual breakfasts.  Very tasty.  I told down the spice a little for my family.  I would recommend trying this with some toast or biscuits.

My first experience making this and I thought it turned out really good. The poached eggs make this dish. I was unsure about it at first but once I tried it, I thought, oh yeah...the yoke was an excellent compliment to the sauce. The mushrooms added a great flavor as well. Will make this again and add a couple more eggs. I also added just a “touch” of brown sugar. That’s probably not a traditional thing for this dish but it just seemed to add something that worked for me.
Thanks for the ShaKshuka recipe!

So good. I made this and was pretty easy. Considering making the sauce the night before, refrigerating then just heating up the sauce and poaching the eggs at brunch. Anybody try that?

My family LOVED it. I tweaked it a little by adding tofu instead of mushrooms.( My hubby has gout and can't eat mushrooms) The texture was still consistent with mushrooms. And it was great!!   Great recipe Thanks John!

I used really good summer tomatoes (a mix of cherry and shady lady) instead of canned. I didn't bother to peed and seed them. Just tossed them in, and added a pinch of salt. This is what you want to make for Sunday brunch when you want something delicious but don't want to feel stuffed and tired. Delicious, healthy, and inexpensive makes this a real keeper. Also a good way to use up the other half of a baguette you had for dinner on Friday or Saturday. Just toast and all is well.

I followed the recipe as written. I was worried about the heat level but with the sweetness of the red bell pepper the dish was perfect. I served this with skillet (fried) potatoes on the side.

I heard about this dish from a cooking show on my car radio so I looked for it  on Allrecipes and here it was! I would call this comfort food...it felt so wholesome to make and eat. I enjoyed the process of just working with these ingredients after a long day at work. I DID leave OUT the jalapenos...not my deal but all else was good. I think most of us love the creativity in cooking  and you can change this up a lot and it will be good every time.

First off, this was super fast, easy, and all cooked in one pan...which I am a huge fan of!! Less dishes to wash!!! Hooray!I’m rating this from my family’s point of view. They RAVED about it. (It didn’t knock my socks off, but I’m thinking maybe my taste buds were acting up again...) It was very pleasant to eat and surprisingly filling! I did 7 eggs, just to feed everyone sufficiently. I added about a TB of minced garlic in with the onions and topped the end dish with the more traditional cilantro. Those were the only changes I made. I did finish it over the stove, which worked perfectly. My hubby said he could easily eat this once a week. :)

So tasty. I’ve always made “eggs marinara” with the bottom of a sauce jar and two chicken eggs. 
First time officially making this dish. The substitutions  include duck eggs, cilantro, goat cheese and potatoes rather than bell peppers (which I started cooking before the onions and mushrooms). There are so many variations you could try in this dish. Next time I might do a roasted butternut squash. Could also add garbanzo beans.

Not a fan of the taste overall. Kinda spicy and eggs with tomatoes texture is not something I would make again.

Turned out to be excellent. One thing that I noticed and had the substitute much more of than was called for is mushrooms. 1/2 a cup is not nearly as much as was shown in the video, I had to triple that amount to get close.

It was delicious. I overlooked the eggs a wee bit because it was hard to tell how done they were. Still, I will make this again. Nice spice.

I can't handle too much heat so I left out the cayenne, and  didn't have turmeric. I just used cumin, a little nutmeg and rosemary. Wonderful breakfast!

I followed this recipe exactly, with the exception of the jalapeno peppers because I didn't have any. I'm usually a big fan of Chef John's recipes, but I didn't care for this one. While I did like a breakfast-for-dinner meal that incorporated a lot of vegetables, I thought this was too tomato-heavy for my liking. Also I did not like the consistency of the eggs cooked this way. I probably won't make it again.

This was extremely delicious. It would be too heavy for breakfast, but add some baked chicken and some bacon on it and it'll make a good dinner. Though that defeats the purpose of a vegetarian meal haha

Super easy! And delicious. I used chipotle powder instead of jalapeño peppers and it had a nice subtle smoky flavor to it. Would definitely make again.

I replaced cayenne and jalapeno pepper with harissa (Moroccan hot sauce) and added smoked paprika.  This dish is wonderful.  Adjusting the spices can give this dish a wonderful zing which complements the mild flavor of the eggs.

This is excellent!  Wonderful flavors in a meatless entree.  It was too spicy for some in my household.  Next time I will use less jalapeño & leave out the cayenne pepper.  I doubled the mushrooms & we all loved it.  My vegetarian son, who is very picky, loved it too!

Delicious. I will make again and again. The feta cheese was a nice addition and shouldn’t be skipped. I paired this with homemade olive bread and some scalloped potatoes and served it for dinner. Yum!

I followed this recipe exactly.  It was very good. two out of three of us liked it.  must add the egg and toast to make it more of a meal.  I would have liked it a little  more spicy.   Next time i'll add a little more  hot pepper.   You really have to watch the egg so that it doesn't over cook.

My family really enjoyed this dish.  A couple of things, do not buy San Marzano whole tomatoes and crush them yourself.  Reason: there's only 5 whole tomatoes and the rest is filled with a thick tomato sauce which made my dish hard to cook down so next time I will buy any crushed tomatoes over San Marzano whole tomatoes.  Also, it didn't have enough salt. We are a low salt family too, but felt it needed more salt so probably will probably get salted crushed tomatoes.  We added 6 eggs and man were they good and saucy. I was concerned that it needed more protein so I cubed  a lb. of firm tofu and added after the vegetables cooked down.  Really good!

Awesome, fast recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except I stirred about 4 oz of feta into the sauce and veggies instead of using it as a topping. The amount of spice is just right, and I'm usually someone who doubles them in every recipe. I have made other recipes for this dish and this one was the fastest, easiest, and tasted just as great as the others I have made!

We left out the jalapeño and cayenne and used 5x as much feta as it calls for and it was fantastic! The eggs cooked all the way through so we just stirred them in and it was reminiscent of lasagna.

This is absolutely delicious! The first time that I made this, I added Italian turkey sausage and halved the recipe. Served it with toasted sourdough bread. The second time that I made this, I accidentally picked up serrano (which is a little spicier that jalepeño, but spice doesn't get me) and used that instead. Serrano peppers definitely gave the dish more flavor. I didn't use any water though for the dish. I also made sure to buy canned tomatoes without added salt or spices, so I'd be free to adjust the flavor on my own. I served it with french bread.

Love this! Great winter meal, with the right amount of heat for me. (Hubs splashes on some hot sauce). For dinner, I cook 1/4 cup of dried lentils until tender and add them with the tomatoes to soak up the spices. This ups the protein content and helps make this a very filling, warm dinner with some pita or Syrian flat bread.

Easy to make. I added chicken  and potato.

However, it did make me poop a lot and my butthole feels a bit fiery.

I liked it, maybe too spicy for breakfast. The amounts are for 1 red bell peppper and 4 big mushrooms.
