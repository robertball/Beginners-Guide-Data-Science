This rye is moist and stays moist and soft past the first day. I added extra caraway because I love it, plus about a teaspoon of fennel as well. The extra caraway and fennel added flavor without overpowering the taste of rye.

This is a delicious and versitile recipe. It rises amazingly, and makes a moist, fluffy bread for the amount of rye flour it contains. I've also tried varying the amount of sugar and using different flours in addition to the rye; it always turns out great!!

It works well w/whole wheat and brown suger (we don't use white flour); in fact we love it so much I make it weekly for our sandwich bread! Interestingly, I tried to halve the recipe and still get two 9x5's!

I used molasses in place of the sugar, and added extra caraway as others have suggested.  This is a great bread.  Making 1/3 the recipe yielded a huge free formed loaf!

This is a nice rye bread. Very similar to what my Swedish Grandma used to make. Nice and moist and very flavorful. The one change I  made was to use ground caraway instead of the whole seeds. It brought out the caraway flavor better.

I thoroughly enjoyed this bread recipe. I didn't make any changes other than making a 1/3 batch and using a bread machine. It's exactly as sweet as I was hoping for with a honey bread. It's fluffy, moist, flavorful - just perfect. Oh! Wait, I did use 1 tsp of orange extract instead of zest, and I didn't detect any orange flavor, but I think it was perfect the way it was. I'll probably just omit it altogether next time. Highly recommend you give this one a whirl if you're looking for a sweet bread. I used the 2 lb loaf setting with 1/3 of the recipe, medium crust, and white loaf. Came out perfect as you can see in my picture :). Enjoy!

Pretty good.  A dense, hearty rye that is a bit sweet--not surprisingly, with the amount of sugar and honey.  I think I'd prefer just honey, though.  I made a 1/3 of the recipe and was able to make 2 small loaves.  My pans are 8x5 as opposed to a 9x5 loaf pan, so I can typically make smaller loaves with them.  However, I could've let it rise longer for a larger loaf.  I don't really taste the orange, so I'd add more orange zest or use some oj next time.  All in all, this is a nice rye.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a great recipe. It definitely made 3 large loafs of bread. Perfect for sandwich making. I put in an additional tblsp of orange zest. My whole family loved it. The only down side was that rye flavor was too mild for my family's liking. I will definitely will make again, but I will add 2 more cups of rye flour and 2 cups less of white.

I made this bread today. Surprised it didn't really taste like rye.  Was really disappointed for that but the bread did taste good none the less.  I will still be looking for a good rye bread.  This really makes a lot so I made 6 small loaves and 1 large loaf and hoping it freezes ok.

I love the recipe.  I especially like the fact that it is rye bread without cocoa or coffee to give it color.  My version is designed for the bread machine which keeps the messy part in the machine on dough cycle.  To make it fit the bread machine, you have to reduce to 12 servings. I also either reduce the white flour by 1/4-1/2 cup without changing the rye flour amount, or simply adding some warm water when the bread machine starts kneading to make a softer doughâ€”if the dough is too wet-add a little flour by spoonfuls. The yeast that I use for the bread machine is instant yeast; and for 12 servings, I use 2 1/2 tsp.  I also add 2 heaping tbsp of vital wheat gluten for better texture.  After the dough is done rising in the bread machine on dough cycle, I take it out and punch it down on wooden board.  The dough at 12 servings can be divided into 24 dinner rolls.  I preheat the oven to warm but not hot-then turn off and leave the dinner rolls in a 13x9 inches pan in the warm but not hot oven with a dish towel over it to rise.  25 minutes later I take it out-check for rise then preheat oven to 350 degrees.  I bake usually 25 min at 350 degrees.  The best way to test is a thermometer in a center roll.  If the thermometer inserted in a center rolls reads 190 degrees, then it is done and can be removed to cool on the table.  Making bread into dinner rolls makes it easy to freeze and take out as many as you need for dinner or any other time.   I usually microwave a frozen roll.

this recipe makes a massive amount of dough, I actually made four loaves, and probably could have turned it into five, but I only had four loaf pans  the bread is good, moist, toasts well, used for breakfast toast and then for a steak sandwich, will make again, but maybe not the full recipe, as it was hard to knead that amount of dough

Delicious bread and easy to make! I made 1/3 recipe and still got 2 loaves. It took me back to my grandparents home where I always enjoyed this bread, my grandfather came here from Sweden and my grandmother always had this bread fresh baked in her kitchen.

Loved it. Will make it again. I crushed the caraway (not ground). I put the seeds in a plastic bag and crushed it with side of a meat cleaver.

This bread is just what I was looking for.  Very flavorful and a wonderful lighter texture. I'll be making this again and again.
