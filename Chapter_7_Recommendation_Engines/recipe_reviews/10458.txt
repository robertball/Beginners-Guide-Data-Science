This is a soft buttery cookie and very tasty. The second time I baked these I substituted orange extract for the vanilla and used canned mandarin oranges instead of pineapple.  Yummy!

Despite the mixed reviews, these cookies turned out very good! Very moist, and cake-like. I put in 1/2 cup coconut and omitted the nuts. I baked them at 350 for 11 min. I yield 4 1/2 dozen.

Hi,
I tried this recipe today. BUT was so disappointed with the result!! Even after baking it for double the time, it still sticks to my mouth. I followed the recipe exactly............but the result was POOR!

I just made these cookies and they turned out very well.  I put a little butter cream frosting on them and they were a real hit..  Very fluffy and not too sweet!  Great!!  I will definately  make them again.

The cookies were very good.  They were moist and had a very mild flavor.  I added a 1/2 cup of coconut, it added a little more texture.  Also a great base recipe for your family's favorite add- ins.

These are a bit plain--you can't taste the pineapple too much, so probably a bit better wtih an icing or something to pop up the flavor.  They are easy, and they spread, so give yourself a bit of space between cookies.  The dough is more like a batter, which makes me wonder if they'd be good muffins, perhaps with some coconut and macadamia nuts tossed in.  All in all, I think I'd experiment a bit more to make them a bit better.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was very worried at the amount and fluffiness of the batter!!  It make A LOT of cookies.  The taste is very mild and the texture is very cake like.  Although, I wasn't too impressed, I find myself going back for more!

These are easy soft cookies - I have made them twice - do my usual substitution of whole wheat flour for white, brown sugar (less than one cup) for the white, 1/2 cup oil for half the butter and I added 1 cup of raisins.  This recipe makes 6 dozen cookies for me.

I tried this recipe to use up a can of pineapple that I had; but there is very little pineapple flavor to them.  This makes very moist and cake-like cookies that stick to each other if stored at room temp. The batter is very fluffy and would probably bake up just as well in muffin form.

Too chewy for my tastes.  I cooked them for longer than the time suggested and they never seemed to get crunchier.
