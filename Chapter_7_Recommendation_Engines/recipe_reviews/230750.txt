Made this last night for a dinner party for 12 but I adjusted the serving size to 8 because I added some sauteed yellow onion and mushrooms. I blanched the green beans for ONLY 2 minutes as I love a crisp bite to my beans and you will be putting them in the oven at 400 again so they get cooked again there. They came out PERFECT ! A very nice SNAP left in the bean when it came out of the oven and it they even sat for 1/2hr before we ate and STILL had that CRUNCH! Added a bit more Blue cheese because I put a layer of the bean mixture in the dish then layered some of the cheese on then added all the rest of the bean mixture that way when you got to the middle of the beans there would still be blue cheese. Did everything else all the same. Got complements and there were none left in my dish!! Need I say more!!

I didn't have time to roast the garlic, so I just minced it and sautéed it with the almonds. Delicious! The combination of blue cheese, garlic and almonds is wonderful.

Made this for Christmas dinner for a group of 20 adults plus children. I doubled the recipe. OMGoodness, awesome! The dish was wiped out on the first round! Note the initial ingredients list has a typo...says minced instead of roasted garlic. I ended up roasting 2 heads of garlic for a double recipe. I think three heads would have been even better.  I was also liberal with the cayenne pepper...more than a little pinch. Everyone loved it! This dish was as beautiful as it was tasty! Good-bye to green bean casserole! lol

One of my teens devoured half the pan, but requested more almonds next time. Anytime I can get one of my kids to devour a vegan dish is definitely worth repeating. I've gotten away from green bean casserole and will sub this as my go-to green bean dish for Thanksgiving.

If I could give this an extra, bonus star, I would! I used green beans from my garden & "guessed" I had about a half pound, so I chose to use 1 head of garlic, 1/2 as much blue cheese, but still used 1/3c almonds.  Rave reviews from the fam! Tasted so "gourmet"!

I used 1 tbs butter and 1 tbs oil.  I found the blue cheese to be the perfect amount.

Delicious! The only thing I didn't have in the fridge was blue cheese, so I substituted shredded parmesan and they were outstanding!  I will be making these again for sure.

This was delicious! Everyone loved it at Thanksgiving! I was worried about the blue cheese -- I don't like it, but it was great in this recipe!! All the ingredients went together really well. Can't wait to make it again.

This is delicious!  I'm not a fan of green beans but in this recipe I love them.  The garlic, almonds and blue cheese go great together.

I rarely use fresh green beans because they always just seem to taste 'green' to me, but this recipe worked great. Everyone really liked them. I did take the advice of some others & sautéed some red onion with the almonds. I will use this again & again.

I thawed frozen green beans in warm water and set aside. Then I chopped the almonds and sauteed them with a little bit of bacon grease, the butter, and crushed garlic (per recommendation of other reviewers). And I didn't have blue cheese, so I used 1/4 cup of feta instead. I didn't measure the green beans but used enough for 4 people with a little bit of leftovers for lunch the next day. I did measure the crushed garlic and only used about 2tbsp but it was too powerful. I enjoyed it but next time I make this I will better think out the proper amount of garlic and maybe use blue cheese to see how that tastes.

I added about 4 shakes of Crushed Red Pepper and the next time I make it I will  add a tablespoon to give it a real kick.  I followed the recipe and it was ok but not amazing.  Not sure I will make it again.  I love garlic and this recipe is for garlic lovers!!

Yes very good I did add some sliced garlic when browning the nuts to give it that extra garlic taste.

This dish was a hit at our New Year's Dinner.  I made it pretty much as it is written except that I had minced garlic on hand so I didn't bake any garlic bulbs.  Also I didn't have any blue cheese so I substituted parmesan and we enjoyed it.

I absolutely loved it. It may be too intense for less refined palettes, but yummmm! It feels a much more elegant choice over a green bean casserole.

I did roast the garlic, but used frozen green beans. This recipe is a keeper at our house. The combination of the garlic and blue cheese make for a tasety side dish.

I also did not take the time to roast the garlic. Sauteed with almonds. I doubled the recipe for Christmas dinner and everyone raved about it! It is the perfect combination of sweet and savory. This may become a new Christmas tradition!

It was awesome and YES will definitely  make it again - I didn't add the blue cheese because I don't like it - I did buy a grated 4 cheese which I was going to add after baking it.. Unfortunately,  I forgot to add it but it didn't matter - got rave reviews and actually just ate the last of the leftovers tonight.. Yummy  - Thank you Chef John!!

Everyone loved it.  I skipped the blue cheese and used a sprinkling of crumbled Parmesan instead.  I found the almonds sank to the bottom and were largely left behind.  Next time I will saute the almonds with the garlic.

My guests loved this.  Me, not so much.  I didn't feel like the flavors blended as nicely as I would have liked.  Followed the recipe exactly.

Had this for Christmas dinner - it was amazing. Made it with minced garlic - otherwise as directed.

Excellent flavor and presentation.  The only change I made was to sauté the garlic with the almonds instead of roasting which saved a lot of time and energy.  Rave reviews from our Christmas crowd.

Great twist - i roasted the garlic the day before the holiday dinner and refrigerated it (good thing as it takes oven time away from other activities on the day of the dinner) - i used my LeCreuset to warm it on the stove with some olive oil (as my oven was preoccupied with the main meal) - it still was delicious!

Oh my but these are good! I don't usually follow recipes without adding or omitting something, but nothing's needed with these! The beans are cooked to perfection and the presentation was beautiful! I couldn't help but bake an extra head of garlic to enjoy while making the bean dish!!

This was a great recipe as is. Chef John is a great chef,but I added some color and crunch to it. I added some julienne Bell Peppers (Yellow, Red and Orange) I added them in at the end of the recipe to retain the crunch factor. Great Recipe Chef ...WELL DONE!!

I changed the recipe as I did not have almonds or blue cheese. I just substituted roughly chopped walnuts and goat cheese. Turned out delicious! I think even without the cheese or nuts this dish would be tasty on it's own because of the roasted garlic - well worth the time. I roasted the garlic while marinating my chicken, and prepping couscous as a starch. This way the oven was hot and ready to go for my chicken to bake!
