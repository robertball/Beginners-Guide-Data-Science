This was so good! As I was putting it together, I thought it might be too sweet, but all the flavors combined perfectly for a sweet/savory treat. The peas (which I crushed slightly) weren't very spicy once blended into the salad, but they provided a great crunch that contrasted nicely with the chewy cherries. I used Poppy Seed Dressing II, from this site, and it was a perfect complement. This is so easy and delicious, I'll be making it often. (UPDATE: It doesn't make the best leftovers; the peas get way too soft. Best eaten fresh.)

This recipe was great inspiration!  I love wasabi peas and because of that this recipe encouraged me to eat some veggies!  I used spinach, golden raisins, carrots, cucumbers, wasabi peas and a quick, homemade mustard vinaigrette.  Thanks for the great idea!

I used crasins instead of the dried cherries and apples instead of pears (sometimes you just have to work with what's in the house, right?) and added some sliced strawberries and a vidalia onion vinegarette dressing.  DELISH!!!
My husband and I are new vegetarians and this was a FANTASTIC quick dinner!!!

Best Salad Ever!  My fiends loved it!  I didn't add the sesame seeds, which would have perfected it.  It doesn't keep well, for the next day, so don't try making enough with leftovers!  The Wasabi Peas were tasty with the cherries, who'da ever guess!

This was a great salad-the tangy, salty taste of the wasabi peas balanced nicely with the sweet cherries and pears.  I used Italian dressing because I didn't have poppyseed.

family really loved this salad, even my husband who turned his nose up at the wasabi peas when he first saw them. They balance out any sweetness from the pear and cherries. Had a nice crunch to them as well. A bit of a bite but not too much. Great summer salad, going to make again for big family dinner this weekend.

I loved this salad!  I used Boston lettuce, and I chose not to add the sesame seeds.  I loved the combination of the sweet dried cherries with the "punch" of the wasabi peas!  Thank you for this recipes, which I will be making again many times!
