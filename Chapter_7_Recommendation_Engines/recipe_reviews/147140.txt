I used only whole grain spelt and put the dough into a bread pan to rise and cook.  I used the rest of the ingredients as listed in the recipe.  It is soooooo good and received thumbs up from even my pickiest eater.  My husband has allergies to wheat (luckily not gluten), so this is a great option for our family.  This is the 5th recipe that I have tried and it beats all those others hands down.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe  :  )

Excellent bread!  I used four cups of fresh ground spelt and no xanthan gum.  I used the dough cycle on my breadmaker, and then raised it in two smaller loaf pans until double and baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  Delicious!

NOT GLUTEN FREE, NO CELIACS! OK, sorry. Nothing against this recipe. I haven't tried it, so I gave 5 stars since that's what it has right now. I saw someone saying they made this for a Celiac relative, and calling it GF, and it's not. It's not regular wheat, and someone with a wheat allergy or sensitivity may do fine with it (but don't take my word for it, check with that individual and/or your doctor), but it *does* still have gluten in it and that exposure can still be dangerous for true celiacs. Wishing all good health!

The first time I made this it didn't rise very well.  This time I warmed the water in the microwave for 30 seconds and I sifted (actually wisked) the xanthan gum into the flour.  It rose beautifully!

I make this every week now, Love it! I don't braid it anymore, just plop it into a baking tin and let it rise then bake it for 40 minutes. My family just loves it and it is healthy, the gluten in spelt flour is easier to digest than wheat gluten. Thanks for an amazing bread recipe!

OMGosh this was by far the best spelt recipe I have found.  I used 4 cups of whole grain spelt flour that I had I ground in my vitamix,   I didn't use the xanthan gum and it was fabulous without it.  I removed the dough used a little flour kneeded very slightly just enough to shape and put it  straight into a loaf pan into a slightly cracked oven at 200 degrees for 30 mins to rise and then increased temp to 350 degrees and cooked for 30 minutes.  This is an absolute keeper for our family

Love this recipe.  I don't braid it.  I shape it into a loaf on the counter with a little more spelt so it doesn't stick and through it in a bread pan.  Let is rise in the oven at 200 F with the door cracked for 25 minutes and then cook it for 30 minutes at 350.  Perfect loaf every time.

Excellent Recipe!  I left out the xanthan gum, since I have no clue what that is, so I didn't have it in my house.  I have never made bread with olive oil, so I was a bit nervous, so I used 1/4 cup  (maybe a little more) of smart balance (the actual hard butter, not the oil in the bottle.  Also, the only Spelt flour that I had, was Organic Whole Spelt All Purpose Flour, so I used 4 cups of it.  I put it on the WW bread cycle of my bread machine, and chose a light crust cycle.  It was HEAVENLY!!!  Light, and airy, YUMMM!  It tasted even better than it smelled (I kept checking to see if it was ready since it smelled AMAZING)!  Definitely going to make this again!

This recipe is great! I have only recently started making bread and have only used the Bread maker, never the oven. I was so happy with how this turned out, much better than anything I've tried. The changes I made:  No Sugar, I used a little bit of Agave syrup to keep things natural. No xanthan gum and I used Spelt and Whole Wheat, as I didn't have whole wheat spelt.  I also crushed 2 cloves of garlic in the egg to glaze over top.  Finally only needed 30 mins in the oven.  I will make this again and again!

I just loved this bread turned out great.  I did change it a bit I put in 2 cups whole wheat in place of the whole grain spelt flour as I had no whole grain spelt flour. I skipped the xanthan gum and it didn't seem to matter.  I am keeping this recipe it is the best one I have yet found for the bread maker.

This doesn't compare to my wheat challah, but since I can't eat wheat anymore, this challah is very very good. Nice, light and moist, but definitely has that "cake-like" challah quality. I baked it in the bread machine using the 2lb setting and light crust, and was very happy with the result.  This recipe is a keeper, thanks!

I made this bread today for my nephew (wheat allergy), for Thanksgiving stuffing especially for him.  I've gotta say this wheat-free bread is excellent!  Soft, moist, flavorful - it takes like the best whole wheat bread I've ever had - you cannot tell it's made different.  My braided loaf only took about 20 minutes to bake on 375, so keep an eye on it.  Thanks for a great recipe - my nephew will be thrilled - bread he can eat that doesn't taste and feel like you're eating cardboard!! YAY!

I   Followed the recipe and ended up with a big blob of dough that didn't even look braided after rising (it was very pretty until then). Where did I go wrong?  Just threw it in a pan to bake. Hopefully it will taste ok.  Really sad it didn't turn out.

I've been using this recipe for years.  I use all whole wheat spelt and do not use the 4 teaspoons xanthan gumand because the first time I made it I didn't have any on hand and it turns out and tastes delicious everytime that I've never found the need to purchase any.
