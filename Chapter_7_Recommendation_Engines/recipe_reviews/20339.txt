I just had this pricey dessert in New Orleans at the restaurant that invented it. It was fantastic! Ingredients are identical except for amounts. Try 1/4-1/2 cup butter, 1cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 cup banana liqueur,4 bananas, 1/4 cup dark rum. Cook same as this. Serve over ice cream. It's hard to believe something this simple can taste so heavenly! Elegant dessert. Thanks Chrissi!

Excellent.  But then it's impossible to go wrong with a banana's foster
recipe -- it's just such a great dish.  I doubled the recipe and flambeed
it slightly differently: after the bananas softened, I poured the alcohol
directly into the pan, waited a minute for it to warm up, then lit it on
fire.  The result was great poured over ice cream, though the remnants at
the bottom of the dish were a little rummy.  (Most of the syrup was fine.)
I might've stirred too soon while it was on fire thereby putting it out
too soon to let all the alcohol burn off?  Or maybe I should've just taken
other reviewers' advice and used a little less alcohol.

Before cooking this recipe, I did a lot of research on the web.  There are
dozens of recipes out there, all varying wildly in the amount of the
various ingredients.  So this dish is apparently very forgiving about
quantities.  The alternative flambeing technique I used is actually more
common than the two pan method called for in this recipe.  Incidentally,  
the best page I found discussing this recipe is a very entertaining read:

FABULOUS! So quick & easy! I doubled and used 3 bananas. No alcohol, used Vanilla instead of liqueur. Spooned over vanilla ice cream and drizzled chocolate syrup on top!  The kids and my husband FREAKED OUT at how good this was! Thanks, I will be sure to make this one for family and friends.  Even camping with angel food cake!

It was fun lighting my dessert on fire!  The taste was just OK, and I found the rum taste to be too strong for this dish.  So next time I will use less rum.

Mmmmmmmm...ok, why 5 stars?  Perhaps the rum is having an effect on me.  But this is simple and great.  I forgot the lemon juice (I think I was very worried about setting the rum on fire, a technique which I had never done before) but it was still great.  Maybe a bit over sweet, but then again I had to use Southern Comfort instead of Rum because we were fresh out of Rum.  Despite all these "mistakes" it was delish, and smelled amazing.  I ate it over vanilla ice cream, but it could make a DIVINE topping for French Toast or practically anything else banana goes with.  Will make again because it is so simple!

Excellent. I added more rum and cinnamon. Took the cooled mixture and made it into ice cream for a Cajun Christmas celebration held at my house. Everyone loved it.

I much prefer this to Bananas Foster II.  In my opinion, this is as close as you can get to what fine dining restaurants serve. The banana liqueur is a nice addition and the combination flames very easily. I would not reduce the rum ratio and if you are making this for a large dinner party, I recommend you error on the side of making too much. Depending on your serving size, itâ€™s easy to come up short and awkward to start over to make up the difference.

I like to serve this a la mode.  I also soak some raisins in orange juice for a few hours and use that instead of the lemon juice.  The raisins will get plump with the OJ and it makes for a very interesting texture and taste.

This is a simple but completely yummy dessert! I cut back a little on the alcohol (the only banana liquor I could find was 99 proof--packs a punch) and I add mixed nuts as a topping. Thanks for a great find!

In my constant search for tasty yet low fat recipes, I was able to modify this one slightly to take out some of the fat.  I only used half a tablespoon of butter, and added two tablespoons of water to help the sugar melt.  Then, I only used 2 Tbls of Rum, instead of the full amount and the banana liquor, since liquor is high in calories.  Still tasted delicious and decadent.  I've served it over crepes, low fat vanilla ice cream, and a combo of both.

My husband and I had a bananas foster breakfast at a bed and breakfast that we stayed in at the beach and have been searcing for this sort of recipe.  We used sliced french toast and this was excellent.  Thank you!

This was excellent though it seemed a little heavy on the rum.  When I made it the second time I added a little less and it seemed better.  Overall, very good!!

OK Kirsten Turek 5/29/05, thank you so much for your review on this recipe.  I had no alcohol so I didn't use the rum or the banana liqueur nor did I have the lemon, but I took your advice and used vanilla I doubled the remaining ingredients and added 1 teaspoon Vanilla (I added it in with the sliced up bananas).  Wow!!! This is a keeper.  I wasn't able to have fun with the fire aspect of the traditional Bananas Foster but the last time I had it at a fancy restaurant, they didn't cook out all of the rum so it wasn't that grate, so finding this recipe and your recommendations was really meant to be.  I can't wait to make this for friends and family.  I didn't try the chocolate syrup but maybe next time.
Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!  

Also I only cooked it for 2 minutes to get the bananas warm, I didn't want the brown sugar becoming more like a caramel syrup.

This was good... however, I was unable to light it on fire. I did as some suggested, which is to mix the liquor into the brown sugar syrup while it was bubbling, and it didn't flame :-(. I wondered if I waited to long to light it? Or maybe I should have poured it on top and without stirring it, light it up? I will try this again... but otherwise it did taste nice!

Really simple but also delicious.  I wasn't sure the sauce would come together - it had separated a bit, but when the bananas went it, it all cooked down beautifully.  This was dessert after Chinese food so I added a pinch of Chinese Five Spice with the cinnamon and Cointreau instead of rum because we didn't have any.

Not enough banana in the recipe and too much liquid. I think I will add another banana next time. We used banana rum in place of the regular rum + banana liqueur. Very good over vanilla ice cream.

very good, and allot less calories than other bananas foster recipe's i have found... 
if you don't have the banana liqueur, you can replace it with another type of liqeuer or possibly more rum, and it should turn out fine. i had to use orange liqueur, in replacement for the banana liqueur and i also added a little bit of orange extract when i was letting it cool- it was an unexpectedly wonderful flavor combination  
**word of caution-- be VERY VERY careful lighting the alcohol- it has a VERY hot flame!!**

This was awesome.  The kids really loved seeing their breakfast on fire (I served it over crepes w/ chocolate sauce) and they loved the taste, too.  Most of the alcohol burned off, but I still may use a little less next time due to its strong flavor.  Thanks for the great fancy-shmancy recipe :)

Wow.  I served this to company and I had to go back in the kitchen and whip more up cause everyone wanted more!  So easy.  I didn't have the banana liquer and it still turned out fabulous.  I served it over a slice of pound cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side.  Soooo good.

I used the changes "awesome in tummy" suggested but cut the brown sugar down some. I also cut my bananas in smaller pieces. Word to the wise...when you light the liqueur and carefully pour it in the banana mixture...it flames up A LOT. I poured over high quality vanilla bean ice cream (also great over cinnamon ice cream) and it was amazing. VERY rich. I had a lot left over so I put it in the fridge and the next morning I cut up two rolls of Grands cinnamon rolls into quarters, mixed with leftover bananas foster and baked as monkey bread. It was simply divine!

My guests LOVED it and literally licked the pan clean.  I did not have rum or banana liqueur and subbed the same amount of orange juice.  I will and have made this again!  Great recipe to have on hand as the ingredients are also usually on hand!

Amazing. I love the way the caramel hardened a little.  Not sure if that is the way it is supposed to come out but yummy still.  I left out the banana liqueur and the lemon.

This is a really good recipe, but I couldn't get the brown sugar to dissolve. Next time, I will melt the butter at a lower heat and maybe that will help.  It still tasted good, though, just a little grainy.

Excellent, easy recipe.  I have substituted brandy and bourbon for the banana liquer - comes out great.  Friends beg me to make this all the time.  The flambe gives it that little something showy and special and everyone thinks I am some sort of awesome chef :)

Even the non-banana-lovers at my dinner party raved about this dessert.  My only suggestion would be to serve over pound cake in addition to the vanilla ice crem.

This was good. I do prefer Bananas Foster II. I thought I reviewed this awhile back, but I guess not. I'd make either one again but prefer the other, I think. Thanks for the recipe!

Outstanding!  But I skipped the lemon and I sliced the bananas rather than quarter and seved over vanilla ice cream.  One batch I used vanilla flavored congac, and the alcohol free batch I used vanilla and skipped the flambee.  Equally delicious.  This desert can't fail and will impress everyone.

First time to FLAMBE`... That was fun!.... I liked this a quite a bit but I think I would have liked it even better on something like crepes!.. As I poured the hot liquid over the ice cream I started to worry my glass would crack, it didn't!  The sauce was my favorite part and I used only one pan, but if I make this again I will use the two pan method; I think the difference is that my bananas left in the same pan carmelized a lot more than some in other pics.. So basically they looked brown!  Wasn't a problem to me, but presentation wise not as appealing!..  I also added 1 extra banana! I may play around with this recipe and try other liqueurs too...

Fantastic! Wow this was awesome I have not had anything this good outside the Renaissance Hotel I stay at in China while there. We had a craving for something sweet and different. This certainly fit the bill. Did I say FANTASTIC!!! Thank you so much for sharing. We will be having this regularly as long as I can keep rum in the house. I think next time I am going to try Amaretto instead of the banana liquer.

This dessert was incredible. I followed it almost exactly, except i used 1/4 cup of banana rum instead of liquer and rum. I also ended up putting in an extra half of a banana. It was soo yummy and really hit the spot!!

so good...the fact that you light in on fire earns this one the fifth star; as someone else suggested, I poured the rum directly into the syrup pan, let it heat for half a minute then ignited it; it was fun

I am a recent convert to Bananas Foster and tried this recipe.  Great results.  I used banana rum instead of banana liquer.  I strongly recommend doing this dish outside because of the flaming rum.

I was amazed at how simple and easy this recipe was!  The presentation was dazzling.. Have never done a 'flaming' recipe before and this was exciting and easy.  I did leave out the liquer.. mainly as I didn't have any, but I don't think it needed it.

This is almost identical to the original recipe from Brennan's in New Orleans, which invented this highly theatrical (and tasty) dessert.  We usually put in a little extra rum and light the bananas in the copper pan, then bring them into the dining room on fire.  My father prepares them at the table in a chafing dish.  It is a WOW!  (and the alcohol all burns off so no problem for kids to eat).

It's a good recipe but most rum doesn't start on fire, it's not a high enough proof

This dessert is outstanding.  I followed the recipe except i substituted Amaretto for other liquors and it was delicious.  It was great served over ice cream but I think next time I will serve with a pastry or blondie brownie on bottom, ice cream, then the bananas fosters.  Delicious!

Wow, I doubled the recipe and yikes;  thought I would burn down the house! For the most part the flavor was good but too much rum!  Will use 1/2 the rum next time and be cautious when doubling!

AMAZING!!! I am not someone who enjoys banana-flavored foods,  but this was fabulous! I agree with other reviews that this could be used with breakfast dishes as well as desserts. The only confusion was how long to let the rum/banana liqueur mixture burn. ??? Otherwise, it was simple, fabulous, and will definitely be made again!

My boyfriend loves bananas foster and this recipe turned out to be great! I doubled the recipe to have more sauce to drizzle over the ice cream. I scooped the ice cream and put it in the freezer first and then added some of the sauce while it was thickening up. Next time I am going to make a mini bundt and put this over it.

Good results.  I concur with two things in previous reviews.  First, this does give a pretty strong rum flavor.  For me, this is a good thing as I like rum, however, it is something to be aware of when cooking for others.  Secondly, I did the flambe in one pan, I didn't go to the trouble of a second.  Since I was using a larger cast iron frying pan, I merely pushed the dessert to the side and added the rum mix on the other, then basted the bananas.

I made this with a friend at Christmas several years ago, and when we get together at the holidays, we always talk about it. Yummmmmmmmyy. We made it for a crowd, so had to guess a bit at the appropriate amounts, and we left out the banana liqueur, but it was divine even without it.

This recipe is delicious! However, here are three caveats: 1) have everything prepped before you start - including measuring your brown sugar and butter into the pan, having the liquor pre-poured in a measuring cup and have bananas cut and ice cream pre-scooped into little bowls and popped into the freezer, 2) Do not scoop out too much ice cream - one or two small scoops are more than enough as this is a rich dessert and 3) If you are making a bigger batch you either need a very big skillet or use two pans. 

This recipe cooks faster than you think and if you leave the bananas in too long they start to fall apart and get mushy. If you scoop out the ice cream and leave the bowls sitting out, the ice cream gets too soft (the hot banana/syrup melts it fast so start with very firm frozen ice cream. I upped the recipe to serve 8 and couldn't fit all the bananas in the pan and by the time I squeezed the last ones in the first ones were getting mushy. This is a delicious dessert - I will make it again but will not make the same mistakes twice!

Similar to the recipe i use.  Perhaps a little more banana liquer though.  Also add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to this.

Please, don't spend needless dollars on organic bananas!  No difference between regular and organic other than the cost.

This was the first recipe that we have ever made that required you to set something on fire. It was awesome! We had a lot of fun with this one, and it was delicious! But when we were making it, we realized that we had nothing to put this over. We had no pastry or vanilla icecream or anything. We ended up putting it over some turtle-track icecream and it was wonderful. Next time we will make it with some vanilla icecream and some vanilla waffers.

So delicious and authentic!  The lemon juice really makes a difference.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  It was so easy and quick, too.  Definitely serve this to company.
