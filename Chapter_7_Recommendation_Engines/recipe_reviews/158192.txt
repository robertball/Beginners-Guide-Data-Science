Well let me say. This is interesting. Easy to put together...But without the celery...we didn't like the taste. It really was weird. Now adding the celery it was tolerable to okay. My kids liked it with the multigrain pita chips I served it with. Tamari sauce was a quest to find. I did find it in my speciality section at the commissary on post. And boy I wished i had googled what it was before hand. It's rather cheap but it's a deeper darker soy sauce with traces of wheat. It smells the same but when mixed it had a tad bit of a back heat to it. Not much ver slight and suttle. I will say this is a recipe you either like it or totally dislike it. We are in the middle. I'm sorry to say. But celery is a must in this recipe. And I'm not sure if i'd make again. I apologize.
