I made this for dinner tonight....it was a Huge hit! I used 1 box stove top stuffing and shredded turkey breast, lowered the milk to 1/2 cup, topped turkey mixture with 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese and baked at 450 for 20 minutes. Then topped with french fried onions, baking until onions were toasted. I omitted the peas, due to personal taste. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

I used this recipe to get rid of a lot of thanksgiving leftovers. I used the leftover green bean casserole instead of the peas and soup. I also used the leftover potato chip crumbs on top. My family enjoyed it, it is one to do every year.

I have mixed feelings about this recipe. It was faily easy to put together, and made a good use of leftovers. However, the soup mixture on top of stuffing was a little too soggy for us.

My husband and college-age daughter weren't excited about leftovers until I served this dish!  AWESOME was the response from both of them.  I put mine in a 2qt. glass rectangular dish and it worked just fine.  GREAT recipe Earla Taylor!

Very yummy recipe!  I needed to use Cream of Mushroom because I didn't have C. of Celery but I don't think that made much of a difference.  We had 2 dinner guests tonight and the 6 of us polished it off very quickly.  My kids (5&7) also LOVED it and asked for more.

Delightful way to use those holiday leftovers.  Hubby was very pleased.  I didn't quite have the amount of stuffing but close.  I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery.  And broccoli instead of peas.  I didn't have any fried onions so added chopped fresh onion and topped with cheddar cheese.  Very easy recipe to use whatever you have on hand!  I will make this again!

Made a turkey breast on Labor Day. Had leftovers. Made stovetop, but first I sauteed some onions and a diced apple in butter. Added a tsp of sugar and some cinnamon. When they were soft, I let them cool and then added them to the stovetop after the 5 min. wait. Used that to make my stuffing "nest" in an 8x8 pan. Followed the rest of the recipe, but did not add peas. Put the onions on the top when there was about 8 minutes left. Good use for leftovers!

This was ok.  Nothing that spectacular.  My husband loved it and would give it 5 stars if he were at the computer right now.  Creative way to use leftover, but not on my list of favorite recipes.  I will not be making this one again.  Thanks for sharing though.

I substituted frozen broccoli for the peas, but I did not chop it up.  Next time I will chop the broccoli first.  I also may try cream of mushroom soup, but this recipe is great as is.

Delicious.  I substituted frozen chopped broccoli for the peas and topped with cheese slices before adding onion rings.  Everyone loved it and it was perfect for using up the leftovers in my fridge.

I made this recipe last night. The flavor was good. I didn't have cream of celery soup so I used cream of mushroom. I increased the amount of turkey. I found there wasn't enough stuffinto balance the soup mixture. I would suggest adding pepper and corn as well. It didn't use enough leftovers but is worth it anyway. My husband had 3 servings and he's the king of picky! Thanks!

Very good.  Will make again.  I browned boneless turkey breast in a pan with a little chicken broth, olive oil and mesquite chicken seasoning.  This would also be good using chicken instead of turkey.  Maybe even put some cheese on top under the french fried onions.

Great leftover use, so great I have made this with non leftovers. I have used chicken, cream of mushroom soup and carrots. Went over so well my family has asked for this one without leftovers around.

Very good. I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery soup. Definitely plan to make this again.

Really good!  To boost the flavor a bit I added 1T Worchestershire and 1 t dried tarragon.  Didn't have frozen peas but frozen mixed veggies worked great and added color.  Put sauteed onions and celery into the stuffing.

This was really yummy. I made a few small variations. I used low fat/low sodium soup since my leftover stuffing was a little salty. Instead of peas, I used my leftover Herbed Corn that was a really good recipe from this site. As a final alternation, I added some cheddar cheese on the top, with the fried onions, for the last 5 minutes. We will definitely be making this again!

Very quick and easy...I used Stove Top stuffing and doctored it up (celery, onion and turkey broth vs. plain water).  The family devoured this and it took no time at all to prepare.

Very yummy and easy.  Instead of peas, I put in leftover broccoli and brussels sprouts. Not too soupy as I think I had more veggies than originally called for. I totally agree that this is a wonderful way to use up leftovers. Thanks!

My husband and I really enjoyed this unique casserole.  A little bit like chicken ala king over stuffing.  Didn't have the fried onions, so I added chopped celery to the chicken mixture, some mushrooms cuz we love them, and after 30 minutes, I sprinkled shredded cheese on top and melted for 5 more minutes.  We had 3 guests bring stuffing to our Thanksgiving dinner so we had so much left.  Also used chopped chicken breast because we were out of leftover turkey.

In this recipe, I substitue the stuffing with egg noodles. If you don't have leftover bird handy, Jennie-O makes a turkey loaf available in all white or white/dark variety (freezer section).

Made this  using our leftover Thanksgiving stuffing, turkey and green bean casserole.  Followed the recipe ingredients and amounts except for swapping out left over green bean casserole  for the peas. The thing I did do differently however was I just mixed everything together, the stuffing, turkey, leftover green bean casserole, cream of celery soup, and milk   and put it into a 9 x 13 glass dish.  Covered it and baked it  for the 30 minutes. I then added the French fried onions baking for additional five minutes and served . Hubby and I both really enjoyed it and he  specifically said this one’s a keeper make sure you don’t lose  the recipe .

Good option for leftovers. After reading other reviews, I made a few changes. I used 2 cups of turkey and only 1/2 cup of milk to make it less soupy. I also used an 8x8 dish and it worked just fine. Flavor was good, but a bit on the bland side. Husband liked it a lot, so I'll make again. It was very easy and quick to put together.

Love this easy Thanksgiving leftovers casserole and have been making my version for forty years. I mix leftover turkey with leftover stuffing with leftover gravy, leaving out the veggies, and serve it with a fresh tossed salad instead. If you never have enough gravy, you should plan ahead and make a quart or so of rich turkey stock by roasting fresh turkey pieces in the oven and then boiling in chicken broth. You can even thicken this in advance. Mix it with the gravy you make from your big turkey, and you have lots for hot turkey sandwiches and this casserole.

Great casserole for leftovers.  I used my homemade sausage stuffing on the bottom. The only changes I made was I added some pepper jack cheese to the mixture. I didn't have the onions so I added fresh grated Parmesan cheese on top. It is so good much better than I thought it would be.

It sounded like it would be good, but I guess it was just really missing something; it was very creamy.  We didn't like it; and would have rather made sandwiches from the left over turkey.  Definitely will not be making this one again.

First, I apologize to those who get annoyed when a review is not a review of the recipe exactly as written. I used this recipe as a jumping off point to make a casserole out of ALL of my leftovers from Christmas, and it was delish!! I added the FF onions to my stuffing (boxed turkey flavor) and pressed the mixture into a greased 8X8 pan, then mixed leftover "grandma's green bean casserole" (from this site) and chucked up leftover turkey into about 1 c. of leftover gravy (which I warmed in the microwave to loosen it up), then poured that in the pan. I split three large buttermilk biscuits into thirds (by layers) and laid them on the top to make it like a pot pie. I warmed the whole thing in the microwave at half power for about five minutes to warm it through, then baked per biscuit directions in the oven (If I'd baked it for 30 minutes, the biscuits would have been done way before the casserole would have been heated through). It came out like a pot pie, so delish that delish doesn't suffice! The perfect comfort food. Thanks.

Pretty good. Had leftover turkey, dressing and gravy.  Used cream of mushroom soup since it's what I had on hand, and replaced milk with leftover turkey gravy.

Everyone liked it but I used the hint from love2cook's review. I did use the peas. It was very good. Thank you

Very good!  I used cream of chicken soup b/c that's what I had on hand.  I probably needed to cook it a little longer--it was a little soup-ier than I thought it would be, but my hubby needed to leave so I had to take it out so he had time to eat.  But the flavor was very good & it was a change from just eating the Thanksgiving leftovers separately--the flavors blended very well.  Loved the french-fried onions for extra flavor & crunch!

This was pretty good; I used cream of chicken soup instead and it needed some extra seasoning so I added my own

I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13x2 pan, baked 45 min plus 5 with the onion topping.  I used a 16 oz bag of peas (rather than 20 ounces) and this was plenty.  I also used 98% fat free condensed soup and skim milk.  My whole family liked this.  It reheated well for leftovers, except that the onions and stuffing became moist and less crisp.  I will make this again, thanks!

This definitely needs help. Some herbs to make it stand out. The nice thing about the recipe is that is one that can be modified to your taste: add celery, use different veggies, but do include more herbs. Just rather flat without them.
