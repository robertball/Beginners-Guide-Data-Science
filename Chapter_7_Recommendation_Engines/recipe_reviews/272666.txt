So Easy!  So Yummy!   If you love the sweet taste of orange marmalade, you are sure to love these. I sprinkled the chicken with salt 'n pepper prior to baking, but otherwise followed the directions.  They came out perfect!  Beautiful crispy, golden brown skin and just the right amount of sauce.

Definitely very easy to make!  Hubby and I both agreed that while we liked them well enough, we still prefer my  regular wings.  I liked the taste of the sweet marmalade with the chili sauce.  We'll probably have them again, mostly because of the ease in preparing!

These were perfect for our get together.  I made 4 lbs total; 2 lbs as written and 2 lbs with grapefruit marmalade. Both were delicious. I served one of each in a bowl over rice then topped with pickled veggies. Perfect for snacking while watching F1 and MotoGP. :-)
