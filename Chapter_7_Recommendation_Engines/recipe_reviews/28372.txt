I find this recipe rather strange.In England,a Chicken Jalfrezi is a firey dish made with green and red peppers and  plenty of chillies/chilli powder.Maybe us English have just butchered the original recipe,(Indians living in Britain have created new curry dishes to suit our palates that are unheard of back in India),but i advise you to add bell-peppers to this recipe as its not only more health,but adds fantastic flavour to the dish.

everyone loved it.  if you want to make your own ghee:
1.  melt unsalted butter in stainless steel pot at very low heat.  2. once melted, slightly increase heat.  3.  decrease slightly if it starts to smoke or show signs of scorching.  do not let it burn.  4.  remain at this point for about an hour, checking often but not disturbing.  5.  after an hour let cool for about 15 minutes.  6. carefully skim foam and floating substances from top with spoon. 7.  filter remaining clear liquid into clean jar.  use cheesecloth,
coffee filter, or paper towel. 8.  cover and store in a cool place.

Thanks for this recipe! Quite simple to prepare and huge on taste. I was surprized how great it turned out...I used chicken with bones (backs & legs) and skin and omitted the ghee. Would probably be healthier, tastier and nicer to eat if I had boneless chicken thighs. This is one of my new favorites even though I used the wrong kind of chicken. Yum!

Just an FYI/edit - Since I adore this recipe so much I made it again the next week but had no cilantro...it wasn't nearly as good! I'm not a huge fan of cilantro but it is really essential!

This is a wonderful recipe!  That said, I have to admit that I did the traditional - cook all the spices together in the oil first.  This method seems to give the food more flavour; plus, I don't like the taste of raw spices.

Oh my this is sooooo good. I used 1 large (28oz) can of drained chickpeas instead of the chicken and served it over rice. Even my teen liked it. It smells great when it's cooking and it was so easy to make. I will be making this again. GREAT vegetarian meal with the chickpeas. UPDATE: I had some Jalfrezi at a local Indian restaurant, it wasn't as good as this recipe. This one rocks.

Yummy! I converted this to a crock pot recipe. I put all ingredients in the crock pot, except the oil and cilantro. It came out great. I got a thumbs up from my husband and two year old.

very delicious recipe.  my grandfather was pakistani and i love the curried chicken he taught our family 2 make.  only thing is i have always been taught to fry the spices first in oil, raw spices dont taste as well.  this was also my first experience with ghee.  as soon as i added it, i saw that it is what makes the difference in the texture of the curry i make and the curry i eat in indian restaurants.  unfortunately it came out too salty (i didnt read the reviews first) and the next time i make it i will cut back on the ghee.  it came out way too greasy for me.  I also microwave cooked some frozen green beans and added them at the end and served it over rice. one good thing is my husband loved it and he generally dislikes chicken curry.

Wonderful flavors! I used chicken breasts instead of thighs and it was great. Also omitted the ghee. Prep was not difficult, but took a little time.  My family said it's definitely a "keeper!"

Very nice recipe. I tried it a few days ago, using more chicken than listed and it was excellent, I made more than needed aswell so that there would be leftovers. The next day I added some stock to it and reheated it for about an hour, it tasted even better than before! 
I would highly recommend leaving it a day or 2 before eating, it improves the flavour greatly.

When I next use this I will try it with a bit more spice however, although it is extremely nice it isnt as spicy as I thought it would be. Definately worth trying, but if you like your curries spicy add in more chilli.

5 stars. :-)

Excellent! Per prior reviews I cut the salt, but all other spices were as listed.  In the last step where you add the cilantro, you can add other soft vegetables such as red bell pepper or yellow/zucchini squash to bulk out the dish. In addition, the steps I used were to saute the onion and garlic, then add all spices except the cilantro and saute them for 1 minute. I then added the chicken and followed the rest of the recipe. Thank you very much for this keeper.

Great! I've used this recipre a few times now and it's brilliant every time. I prefer to keep half the onion back though, then chop it up in bigger chunks and add it nearer the end with some bits of red/green pepper to add a bit more flavour and texture. Everything alse is perfect though!

Everybody liked it. I did a few changes, though. I ground my whole cumin and coriander and added it after the onions and garlic with half of the ginger at the beginning of the recipe before the chicken to cook the spices and bring out more flavor. I used a chopped serrano chili instead of chili powder along with the garlic and ginger. I would have gone for 2-3 serranos, but one family member doesn't like it very hot. I also used fresh tomatoes chopped up in a food processor instead of a can. Except for those changes, I did it as stated and it was certainly a favorite of everyone at the table. I'm going to do it for friends very soon at a get together. Very delicious, indeed!

We normally make curries fm scratch fm madhur jaffreys book using lamb shoulder but this requires at least 2.5 hrs cooking time. Today we didn't have the time so made this chicken jalfrezi not expecting it to b as good. How wrong we were, fab little recipe full of spicy flavour, we only used 350 gms of chicken thigh but kept to the same quantity of rest of ingredients except salt (1/2 tsp). Browned onion,chicken,garlic,grated fresh ginger then sprinkled chicken with turmeric,cumin,coriander added toms,salt,2 dried chillis chopped instead of powder and the ghee (u can use butter) then covered n cooked on low for 45 mins, if it loOks Abit watery reduce sauce by removing lid, we added small bunch fresh chopped coriander (cilantro)right at the end of cooking. Served with basmati rice, elephant chapattis warmed (fm local paki shop or asda) and sharwoods mango chutney for nice sweet fruity accompaniment.Yum

I adore this dish, but similar to other reviewers- have made slight variations in my ingredient list. I decreased the turmeric and coriander by 1 tspn each, and add in 1 tspn of garam masala and 1 tspn of paprika. It's so nice that naan is available at most grocery stores now- it's perfect for sopping up the sauce!

I LOVE this recipe!! Of course I made a few adjustments. I add 2 zucchinis and a red bell pepper when you add the can of tomatoes. I also stir in 2 heaping tablespoons of curry paste and some coconut milk.

This was an excellent dish! It was very easy to make. My only regret is that I did not double it, as I would have liked to have  had some leftovers! Thanks for the great recipe!

I found the amount and mix of spices in this recipe to be far too overpowering. It's not that it was too spicy, it was just hugely overseasoned.  I feel bad about being so harsh but it was truly horrible and a waste of ingredients.

Now that I've made this, I breathe a sigh of relief that I doubled it.  Possible a cocky move for a recipe I've never made before, but as it turns out, a wise move!  It seemed like there was going to be too much spice when I first read through the recipe, but the end result was delicious.

EMMMMM, This is delicious, really easy to make, wonderful recipe, thank you. I did change a couple of things, I cooked the onion, ginger, garlic together, put tomatoes in and liquidized, it gave a very smooth sauce.  Cooked the spices in oil and added the chicken until cooked, added the sauce and chicken together and cooked for 30 mins very slowly to infuse the flavours, it was wonderful.  Thank you for posting.  I also added bell peppers as suggested previously.

This tasted awesome and was so easy!  I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews where people did not like turmeric.  I didn't know if I liked it or not but I forged ahead and tried the recipe and I'm so glad a did.  I followed the recipe except I left out the ghee and cilantro.  I served it with quinoa and topped it with chopped green onions.  I will definitely make this again.

This was very flavorful! The store was out of boneless thighs, so we used bone-in ones and simmered it longer than stated to allow the flavors to blend fully.

Fantastic.  We all loved it.  One thing though, I didn't find this made near enough to serve 6, my husband suggested doubling it next time.

Perfect just the way it is, thanks Alia! Delicious, simple and forgiving (I accidently chopped instead of grated the onion, didn't debone the cicken and dumped all the spices in at once and it was still great.) Use Mexican chili powder for those who like mild; tumeric is so good for you - keep it in!

This was a good dish.  As recommended by another reviewer, I added one red and one green bell pepper, which added a nice flavor.  I also skipped the ghee (I don't have the wherewithal to clarify butter at the end of the day).  I did not closely adhere to the recommended spice doses but I did add them at the times recommended in the recipe.  I think the flavor was nice but it wasn't out of this world.

My goodness! This was without a doubt one of the most flavorful and delicious chicken recipes I’ve had on allrecipes. These were definitely very unique flavors! The recipe as listed is completely perfect. It results in the most succulent chicken with a bold spectrum of heavenly flavors. The spice combination used here was to die for! We served this over a bed of rice and it was a big hit. This 5 star recipe will definitely be a keeper in our home. Thanks for sharing.

Smells and tastes absolutely wonderful.  I think even the hubby, who doesn't usually like really spicy food, will like this one.  I made this recipe for the first time several week ago.  This time, I made it with half chicken and half lentils.  It didn't really change the flavor much, but less fat and cholesterol should help my hubby who is trying to lose weight and get his cholesterol down.

Have made this recipe a few times.  Really good. My husband loves it.  He is from Libya and likes spicy food.  Tonight I added sliced carrots and some chick peas to it.  I also cut the boneless chicken thighs into chunks.  Served it over couscous.  Delicious.

Wow!  This is one of my favorite recipes ever.  I increased the chicken to a value pack (2.5 lbs) and increase to 2 cans of tomatoes and reduced ginger root to 1 T. Everything else I left.  Did just use butter for the ghee.  really delicious on jasmine rice.  Thanks!!!!

This is delicious!  I didn't think it was spicy, but I like VERY spicy food.  The only thing I did differently was I used 2T regular butter instead of the ghee.

Delicious!  I added red and green bell peppers at the beginning of the process and used a huge onion.  Better than the local Indian place, for sure.

I cooked this for my friend from India and she raved over it.  She did say there is a little too much Tumeric though.  She suggested cutting the Tumeric in half.

I loved this!  I make a lot of Indian dishes that take quite awhile to prepare, but this was super easy to make in just a few minutes after work.  I will definitely make this frequently and it is a great recipe to add veggies or easily make vegetarian with tofu, paneer, or chickpeas. Yummy!

This was really delicious and easy to make- I didn't have ghee- because I live in the middle of no where, and I didn't feel like making any, so I just used butter...yeah, I know, a little lame.  After reading other peoples reviews, I realized that I best put a tablespoon of sambal in it and an extra tablespoon of chili powder.  It turned out fantastically!  I will certainly make this again. Woot! Woot!

I had no idea that this was going to be so good!!! Made these modifications: Had no coriander or tumeric so used curry powder.  Added ground thyme, tblesp of coconut milk and heavy cream in leu of ghee.  Also added chopped green pepper, extra garlic, extra ginger, and extra chilli powder for heat.  Delicious!  My fiance devoured it!!  Thanks for recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I did, however, add a few modifications.  First, I used fresh chopped tomatoes instead of the canned kind.  Second, I added some chicken broth to make it "saucier," as another reviewer suggested.  Lastly, I added sliced bell peppers to make it more like the Jalfrezi that is served at my favorite Indian restaurant.  Mmm!

This was good, but I'd change a few things.  The turmeric was a bit overpowering, and I don't really care for its bitter flavor.  I'd reduce.  Also, although the sauce was flavorful, I think I'd want a little more of it.  I would either reduce it less or add more tomatoes. Other than that, it was pretty good, and I will try it again with the modifications.  I usually don't like to mess with a recipe too much the first time around!

The spices are very similar to Indian cooking, but this dish had it's own destinctive taste. I'd never had anything Pakistani. I'm really glad I tried this recipe. I do like things kind of spicy, so I added 1/4t. cayenne like another reviewer. Even more would be okay depending on how hot you like it. Thanks for this wonderful recipe Alia!

I'm always a little nervous when I try different ethic cuisine b/c normally it tastes nothing like what I've had in restaurants and then I'm disappointed. But this recipe IS IT! Spectacular results. My husband is still raving about this one. Thanks Alia! The only thing I did differently was I added a green pepper,  chopped, in with the canned tomatoes. Terrific.

One of my favourite recipes and a dish that I make often.  I made a few revisions to make this healthier and a great deal spicier: 1.) I do not add ghee.  2.) I use a food processor to process the garlic, onion, and 6-8 fresh Thai chili peppers (with seeds) into a paste like mixture.  3.) I use an entire 28oz can of diced tomatoes and drain a little bit of liquid from the top.  3.) I add 1 diced red pepper, 1 diced yellow pepper, and 4-5 whole Thai chili peppers (tops twisted off) with the tomatoes.  4.) I add a dash of sirachi sauce with the tomatoes and peppers.  5.)  I serve this over cauliflower rice when I feel like cutting the carbs.  6.)  If you're in the mood for something exceptionally spicy, use fresh habeneros (2-4) instead of Thai chili peppers

used a little less than the whole onion.. didnt have fresh garlic :( so had to use powdered instead.. about 2-3 x as much if woulda been fresh.. halved the turmeric.. added 1/2 t of cayenne pepper like one person suggested.. halved the salt.. didn't use the ghee and cheated like others and "cooked" the spices first.. also didnt realize i had no fresh cilantro.. and dried cilantro is a joke.. but still used it.. im a lemon feind and splashed a bit on.. the dish came out wonderful!  would like to try it with the fresh garlic & cilantro next time to see the diff.. ty for the recipe

I can see why people love the recipe, but I realized that I am not a big fan of tumeric and this recipe calls for a lot of it.  I might try it again sometime and use less of that spice.  Other than that it was good.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I have been making it two or three times a month for several months now and can't wait til it turns up on my dinner menu planner as the day to cook it! I use chicken tenderloins instead of thighs and dice up my own fresh tomatoes. I am too lazy to make ghee and can't find it in a store, so I just add 2TBSP of butter as is. I find that it doesn't need to simmer for as long as instructed before everything evaporates out. I serve it over rice and have red globe radishes on the side. What a great combination of flavors! Thank you for the recipe!

I was really looking forward to this. And I was really disappointed with it. First, it was waaaayyy too salty. 1 tsp of salt is more than enough. Maybe even 3/4 tsp would work. Second, I didn't really like the combo of flavours. Left a lot to be desired. On the positive side, it was super easy to make and the chicken was very tender.

This was easy to make and very mild.  It had a simple flavor, but was much better the 2nd day.  I will make again, I'll just increase all the spices by half.  This also worked well served over spaghetti.  Thanks to your Mama.

This recipe is terrific!  Lots of flavor and my guests (who are both REALLY picky) loved it! In fact, one of them (the even more picky one) requested the recipe.  I didn't have coriander, so I substituted lime, which worked really nicely.  Also, I used a bigger can of tomatoes than the recipe called for - I think that's helpful if you are going to let the dish simmer a little while (it keeps the chicken juicy).  Highly recommend!

Excellent dish, but made a few modifications. Too much turmeric can leave food tasting "muddy," so I decreased the turmeric to 1 tsp. That was plenty. And I added 1 diced green pepper because we like veggies in our meat dishes. I kept the chili powder at 1 tsp because fiance doesn't like spicy food, but I added cayenne to my portion. Delicious!

This recipe was fantastic. I didn't have all the spices in the house, so I used garam masala spice blend instead. It came out great. It takes just like a good Indian restaurant.

Yum!  I made it with chicken breasts and extra tomatoes.  Didn't add the ghee...maybe I will next time.  But it is great without it.

This tastes great!  Exactly what I was looking for.  I used regular butter instead of Ghee and it turned out fine.  I would recommend using a little less turmeric than it calls for as well.  Be careful with the turmeric - it stains!  I made this recipe twice - the second time around, I omitted the chicken and made vegetable curry.  Will make again.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this dish.  I don't like dark meat, and had run out of chicken breasts, so I used cubed turkey, and it came out great.  I followed the rest of the recipe to a "t" except I think I used a little less cilantro.  The spice quantities scared me, but I took the plunge, and while the dish was VERY flavorful, I would not say it was overwhelming at all.  To quote my husband, "I'd give it a four...it's really a good flavor, but it's not like WOW in my mouth."  I will definitely be making this again, since aside from grating the onions (sweet agony), it was very easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe!

I make something different for my man every night and he said he wouldn't mind having this one again.  I loved it too.  I have to admit I did add a bit more garlic - we're big garlic fans.  Very flavorful & great over white rice.

Excellent recipe!  You would expect with all those spices that it would be too strongly flavored, but it really isn't.  I added all the spices with the onion at the beginning because I didn't like the raw flavor of them added later. The cilantro, however, as a fresh herb, *must* wait until the end or it disappears.  You can make it all ahead except for the cilantro--add that when you reheat it.  It tastes great over steamed brown basmati rice.  Thanks for a keeper of a recipe, Alia!

Just now enjoying the leftovers of this savory chicken curry.  I made this exactly as written, but used chicken breasts (on hand).  My husband enjoyed it as well.  If you like Mexican food, or Oriental food, you will enjoy this as well.

This was very good. I did not add the cilantro, but it was still great. I mixed chicken breast in with the thighs since they seem less fatty. Also increased the chili powder by 1/2 teaspoon. Could have probably added a bit more. We had this over basmati rice and with naan bread on the side. Excellent!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I appreciated all the wonderful flavors of the dish.  Unfortunately, it was a bit too exotic for my meat-&-potatoes husband.  However, I expect to keep & share the recipe....so thanks Alia!

I made the recipe as instructed by the directions. It turned out fantastic! My husband loved it and made me promise to make it again for him. I also made white rice with a cardamom seed and a cinnamon stick for flavor and then put the chicken over it.

We enjoyed this very much.  I omitted the cilantro because we don't care for it.  I served it over cooked cauliflower crumbles in place of rice.  I will make this again.

Great recipe for getting the basics right, but agree with other post that this needs to spice up a bit. I add some sliced red pepper and some roughly chopped onions for added texture and some green finger chilli's to add a heat it up a bit or a lot depending how many you put in. As with all curry I cook I prefer to make them one day, leave in the fridge to ferment for a day or two and then heat them up again.

I stuck to this recipe as much as possible. I used slightly more chilli powder and added spinach and one green bell pepper. It was phenomenal. Was the first curry I've ever made and my guests loved it. Will 100% make again.

Made this with tofu instead of chicken. It was a bit salty, and I love salt. Mixing with rice cut that. Next time I will use less salt. Otherwise it was good.

I'm a big fan of this recipe.  It's hearty and makes a large amount, helpful when I have a boyfriend who can eat his weight in dinner!  I love how the shredded onions add texture to the sauce, and there's a lot of sauce to go with every serving.  Very hearty and savory, great for a cold day.

I make this all the time and as another review says this is nothing like an extremely hot "jalfrezi" you would get in an Indian restaurant. Just a mildly spicy red curry with a great "stew' flavor from using dark meat.

This is a staple in our house. 
You really can't mess it up, at all. I've made it as described, in a slow cooker, in a MASSIVE pot, pan etc. In the pan it's the best since the chicken browns, but there is NEVER ENOUGH. We batch cook this, so I  get about 16 meals from the recipe (4lbs of chicken). I can't rave enough about this. Also, I'm not sure if it's authentic indian, but my indian friends LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe. Also, if you don't have all of the exact same ingredients, don't fret, use what you have, but the recipe as is is the best permutation I've found thus far. 

I serve it with sweet potato mash (sweet potato, coconut oil (unrefined), salt, sometimes a bit of cinnamon). So I do 4lbs chicken, 6lbs potatoes for 16ish servings. AMAZING. Make it already!

I only didn't have the Ghee but can't imagine it tasting any better! I seasoned the chicken with the salt, chili powder and turmeric before putting in with the onions and garlic! Also didn't have diced tomatoes only crushed!  Served over jasmine rice! A keeper for sure!

Well balanced; healthy and hearty!! I used chick peas instead of chicken; added carrots, a red bell pepper and a spicy red chili. The result was an exceptional tasting dish with a unique flavour profile.

Easy and very good.  Easily could be made after work if chicken unthawed. Served it with a slightly sweet white wine from Chaberton Winery (British Columbia)....perfection! And on a work night no less...thanks for sharing.  Oh and I didn't measure the spices just threw them in!

I wanted to try something different for dinner and came across this recipe. I loved the end result. I love quick tasty dishes and this is definitely one of them. Luckily, I was trying to make an Indian dish one night and had all of these spices readily available in my pantry, so all I really had to buy was ginger. I opted out ghee since there were no stores by my house that sells it, used unsalted butter instead. I'm making this dish again tonight but will be cutting back on the hot spices.

This is one of my favorite recipes. My husband and I loved it! I didn't fry the spices here like everyone here said to (Because I forgot), but it turned out amazing!!! I also used bone in chicken, and it worked just fine. Also I didn't have any ghee, so I just left it out. Tasted wonderful!!! In fact, I'm going to try and make it with turkey for thanskgiving (Because my husband hates the traditional roasted kind).

Found the recipe very enjoyable, but did not think it was great, though good enough to make again. It is a very flavorful dish without being spicy hot. Served it over rice. In full disclosure I cooked the seasonings except cilantro with the chicken onions and garlic from the beginning, and did not have Ghee as I couldn't find it in my small town.

I don't prefer it with as much cumin as the recipe called for, and I think the butter was unnecessary. It was good enough to try again with some alterations to suit my own tastes, however.

I agree with one of the reviews that the spices are better roasted/fried first
The amount of cumin and all the other spices added towards the end made the curry seem undercooked.
I read the recipe and reviews many times to confirm if I was following right or if anyone else had the same problem.

This recipe is fantastic! But I did change a few things. I doubled the tomatoes (28 oz). Makes it a little more saucy since the curry reduces down quite a bit as it simmers. I also add "Hot Madras curry powder" and "Garam Masala" at the end when it's done cooking. I usually just add them to taste (about 2 tsp each). YUM!

I doubled the recipe and made it in my pressure cooker. I added all spices and ingredients except the cilantro which I stirred in at the end. Instead of grating the onions I used my food processor and cut up finely like a paste with the regular s blade. Cooked for 20 minutes and it turned out tender and the meat was infused with the flavor of the spices. No stirring or watching the pot. So easy. Would make again but next time would make spicier as I like better hotter.

Delicious!  I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used some frozen jarred tomatoes from my garden, which made for less juice, so I used some chicken stock.  Subbed paprika and cayenne for chili powder, and added some mushrooms and mixed bell peppers.  Used regular butter in place of ghee.  We were very impressed with the flavor.  I served it over quinoa.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a delicious and easy recipe! I added a can a tomato paste, 1/2 cup of coconut milk, and a little cinnamon. I think coconut milk is a great addition, it makes it a little creamier and sweetens it a bit. I will make this again soon... my husband says that it is "company good" this is our term for any new recipe that is tasty enough for guests!

This was good.  And as far as spicy goes, I wouldn't say this was spicy at all -- flavorful, yes.  I used a smoked basmati rice. I also added some red/green bell peppers to it after the tomatoes.  It makes a lot of sauce and 1.5 lbs of thighs is really not enough to appreciate all the sauce, ya know?

I made this for the same meal I made the "Pakistani Spicy Chickpeas" recipe from this site and it came out delicious! I did change it a little bit:
I used a processor for the onions
Cayenne Pepper Powder instead of the chili powder
Dried Cilantro leaves instead of fresh

The only thing I did wrong was add too much cilantro (turned more green than tomato red) - won't be a mistake I'll be making next time. And yes this is one dish I'll be making again. My hubby loved it! I served this with Persian rice, the Pakistani Chickpeas, and a Persian version of the Naan bread (called Sangak).

I have made this twice, and I wish I had reviewed it after the first time to help me out the second time around. The first time I made it, it was out of this world. So rich and delicious. I did add green peppers at the beginning with the onion and garlic. When I make it again I will not put in the cilantro because tonight it was all I could taste. To anyone on the fence, this IS worth trying, but I do recommend adding the green pepper and omitting the cilantro.

Fabulous!  I'm so sick of chicken but not anymore!  Followed recipe almost exactly except I've never heard of grating onions...  I also added white wine to deglaze the pan before adding the tomatoes.  Also added onions first before garlic and cooked on a lower temp as usual.  Wonderful!  Will make again!  Thank you!

Made this last night and it was amazing. The only thing I did differently was add some green bell pepper, put in all the spices with the vegetable oil and garlic/onion paste, put in 1/4 tsp of cayenne, and one tablespoon of sambal chili garlic paste for extra heat. I also had to use regular butter instead of ghee, but it was the best Jalfrezi I have ever had. I will definitely be making this a lot more in the future. Thank you for the recipe.

This was wonderful!!  I substituted chicken breasts because it's what I had on hand and used 2 tbs regular butter instead of ghee because I misread the recipe and served it over rice and it all turned out fantastic.  The chicken was tender and the dish was flavorful and delicious.  My only regret is that I didn't think to buy naan to eat with it!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was fantastic. The only small change I would make next time is cut back on the salt. I served this with naan and it was a better meal than at our neighborhood Indian restaurant.

This is an awesome recipe. My only complaint is that there is too much salt and it's not spicy enough for my taste. To remedy that I only add a teaspoon of salt. I also add a teaspoon of cayenne.

I make a similar recipe except that the spices get cooked in oil first, a sliced green bell pepper is added in, and it is garnished with sliced boiled egg in the end. If you serve it with peach chutney, it is DEEEEEELISH. Enjoy!

I followed this exactly, with the exception of the cilantro.  I could not believe how salty it was. WAY too much salt.  I would suggest no more than 1/2 tsp. salt.  I don't think I would make this again.

This recipe is terrific - the flavors of all the spices blend nicely.  I adjusted the spices to fit the family's tastes and followed the tips of the "most helpful" reviewers.  Served with a tossed salad and fresh fruit. Cantaloupe or pineapple are  refreshing after the spicey chicken. Will definitely be making this again soon.

This was delicious! I omitted the ghee, but added about 3 tbsp of unsalted butter, which made the sauce slightly creamy. It wasn't very spicy, but tasted better than some mild dishes I've gotten at our local Indian restaurant. For more spice, it would be easy to add some additional chili powder or a hot pepper.

One of the best chicken dishes I have ever made. Tastes just like something you'd get in a restaurant. I can't say enough good about this amazing recipe! Interesting to use so much tumeric, cumin, and coriander but it all worked and the end result was very delicious!

I liked this quite a bit. I mostly followed the recipe but took out some of the chicken in favor of adding mushrooms and spinach. I also went the slow cooker route. Very good.

HOLY SHMANOLY!!!! This stuff is definitely on the top of my favorites list. I have never had Indian food before, but I kept seeing this recipe referenced in reviews I was reading for another recipe (cucumber riata) and I got curious.  I did change a few things, some based on reviews I read here-added green peppers, mushrooms, chicken flavor Better Than Bouillon-I used diced chicken breast (personal preference) and I added 1/3 cup of heavy cream (just to add a little more creamy consistency). I also followed anothers suggestion to cook the spices in oil first. The end result was SCRUMPTIOUS!!! I served it over the Indian Style Basmati Rice on this site and made homemade Naan (also from this site).   Oh...I almost forgot, I also added more tomatoes and a can of tomato paste. I guess I did change it quite a bit, huh? Oh well...I loved it and so did my hubby so at the least it was a great base recipe for me! Thanks Alia for the recipe!!!

This is excellent!  Be sure not to use "TexMex" chili powder. Use ground cheyenne and you will get the "heat" and flavor you are looking for.  This is a definite "do again" in our home.

This was good. It was easy. I think my execution suffered a bit (some of the onion got a little too brown) and I was missing the fresh cilantro. I am sure it would be much tastier with the cilantro. I find I am not a big fan of that much turmeric, though, and I was thinking it would be tastier with a few non-traditional additions..maybe some coconut milk or some cinnamon..even basil and peas. But then it wouldn't be jalfrezi anymore. :) I will probably try this again with some of the above changes.

Really enjoyed this curry. The flavors were flavorsome without being spicy hot.  The only negative is that I prefer a little more sauce.   Followed the recipe exactly other than adding some Baby Bella Mushrooms.

Excellent recipe, and I have all those spices on hand. To clarify your own butter, just melt, chill and remove solid butter, discarding the liquid left behind. Kind of a shortcut, but it works.

Very good!  I did not cook the chicken the additional 10 minutes uncovered for two reasons.  First, the chicken didn't need it and second, I didn't want to reduce the sauce because I wanted it for the rice, and there was plenty this way.  Yum.  Very tasty and good!  Thanks!

Update:  Reduce original cooking time from 20 to 5 minutes for boneless thighs.  Total cooking time is plenty since the thighs are boneless .

I love this dish. I made it for dinner and even my seven and four year olds ate it. I love all kinds of spices and this dish has many, but none are overpowering. I put the chicken over a mixture of half brown rice and 1/2 barley for added fiber. If you like dishes with lots of different flavors, you will love this!

I had to slightly modify this recipe since I was cooking for little tummies as well as big ones, but it turned out fantastically! I halved the spices and omitted the ginger (I forgot to buy it) and served it over fluffy basmati rice. I did find that I had to add a little water near the end of cooking to get some sauce since all of mine had cooked down, but it wasn't a problem. My three year old ate a huge bowl with some bread and butter and proclaimed it a keeper. Thank you!

This recipe was amazing. I've never had better Jalfrezi in a restaurant. Thank you very much. My only concern is that I'm going to get sick of Chicken Jalfrezi because I'm going to be making it so much!

Holy  this is good!  While not necessarily quick to make, it is easy (use a food processor to grate the onion).  I didn't have quite 3 tsp of turmeric, and used only 2 tsp of coriander (what we had on hand was very strong) and only 1 tsp salt -- but it came out amazing!  Also, we had no ghee, so I used a bit of butter and added a bit of cream at the end.  My husband is from India, and he pronounced it restaurant quality before inhaling a large portion!  The spiciness was fine for us, but those who prefer less heat may want to use a little less cayenne.  This will definitely become a regular meal in our house!

I absolutely loved this!  It is important though to add the ghee. It creates a beautiful sauce that will stick to your rice/bread/naan.. Still good without, but I could tell a difference when it was missing.

This was good, but not much like any Jalfrezi I've had before. I ended up adding a little bit of generic 'Curry Powder' for a bit more flavor. We had it with basmati rice and paratha. Good stuff. Thanks, Alia!

This was excellent!  I did change some things, though-- I added a can of garbanzo beans at the beginning, about a 1/2 cup of chicken broth (it needed some more liquid) and at the very end, I poured in some light cream in lieu of the ghee.  Also, I used chicken breast cutlets instead of thighs. Oh, and I used curry powder instead of the component spices individually (didn't have them all on hand).  This was  unbelievable poured over brown rice.  Yum!

This was awful! I'm not sure why it turned out so poorly when this recipe got such high ratings. It's the first thing I've ever made that my husband and I couldn't eat, we both threw ours out.  I read the recipe two more times thinking maybe I left out an ingredient or forgot a step, but I followed it exactly. Maybe it just wasn't for our tastes.

this was pretty good and a snap to prepare.  I think it is a bit heavy on the turmeric.  Upped the garlic and added some green peppers.  I like a bit more heat so also added a dried ancho chili. Did not see the need for any clarified butter so left that out completely.  Served this over spiced basmati rice.  Quick easy meal that can be tweaked.

This was the best. The only thing that I did different was to use butter instead of ghee.  I was concerned about the amount of spice, but it was just right.  Will become a regular at our house.

OMG! OMG! This is the BOMB recipe. It tasted just like an Indian takeaway from a fine Indian restaurant! Loved it! I used a bit less ginger as I'm not a huge ginger fan, and I loved it! I would grate the ginger more finely than I did so as not to be biting into ginger chunks. The flavors blended awesomely! I used creamed coconut as I couldn't find any ghee, and it turned out just as good as the chicken jalfrezzi I've had in restaurants. The BEST.

I don't know if this recipe is authentic nor how it compares to the original.  But I do know that I love all of the ingredients and this combination definitely didn't disappoint.  Yumm! I will make this again and again.  I think adding some diced potatoes in the last 10-15 minutes would make this even heartier and next time I will add some heat.  I cut my chicken into bite size pieces. I served on basmatti rice with Naan.

This was great after a few small mods.-- I cut waaaay back on the additional salt. Used maybe 1/8 tsp. Also I used chicken breast cut into strips, just as a personal preference. I had to sub dried ginger and cilantro. However, we all loved this, my 2 year old included. I served it over basmati rice and I liked that it had some heat, but not too much heat. I will definitely make it again.

I used fresh tomatoes.  The red chilli looked like too little so I doubled it (we like our food really spicy).  I also added a green pepper at the same time I added the cilantro.  Jalfrezi always comes with green peppers in it.  My husband thought this didn't taste like what Chicken Jalfrezi is supposed to taste like.  I thought it tasted yummy.  I would make it again but maybe reduce the tumeric a bit.

This was an excellent and flavourful recipe.  I added some chile flakes to spice it up a bit.  Thanks!

I made this over the weekend and it was fabulous.  My husband grew up in West London where he ate a lot of Pakistani and Indian food, and said that he hasn't had anything this good since his days in London - he claimed it was even better than anything in the best restaurants.  Only changes were I added mixed colored bell peppers and tons more garlic - but we really eat a lot of garlic.  Our garlic ratio tend to be if a recipe calls for one clove - we'll add a whole bulb.

When I first made this I thought it was awful! So the next time, I tried it without the Ghee and it came out fantastic. Guess I'm not a Ghee fan. This recipe is fresh and delicious!

I was a bit suspect about the reviews of this recipe wondering how something so simple could be so fantastic.  To give the recipe its due, I followed it to the letter (which is unlike me usually) - it was FANTASTIC.  So, so simple and so quick.  I made it with skinless, boneless thighs and that made it low fat and oh so so scrummy.  I have passed it on to friends and will definitely make it again and again.

This was my first attempt at Indian food.  It was fantastic.  I cut the salt down to 1/4 teaspoon as some other reviewers commented that it was salty.  I also used regular butter instead of ghee as I could not find ghee.

Great recipe!!  I modified it slightly by adding sweet chili sauce instead of chili powder.  Everyone in our family loved it.  We served it with rice, falafel and creamy cucumber salad.  We will definitely have this again!

Apparently I don't like Indian food - this was my first experience trying indian food and I thought it was absolutely horrible.  I usually like spicy foods - but I like heat from fresh peppers, and this was a different kind of heat.  I thought the tumeric was disgusting - it turned the chicken yellow which was unappetizing and also had a strange flavor to it.  Sorry for the bad review - but I have to be honest, I will not be making this again.

I agree with everyone here. This was a very nice balanced recipe. My only regret is that my friends in America find it very hard to obtain proper Basmati rice to go with any of these Indian recipes.  They market a rice which they have borrowed (some say hi-jacked) the Basmati name in the USA which is nothing like true Basmati.  Luckliy here in the UK we can obtain the very best Basmati.  I submitted a photo for this Jalfrezi and it looks as good as the meal tasted.  Full rating for this one.

This is good stuff. Wonderful flavour; nice heat.  A tad salty for me; next time I'll cut the salt by a 1/2t.

This recipe is perfect. Really. I made it for the 2nd time last night, fed it to a guy friend of mine, and he fell in love with me."This is the best home cooked meal I'd ever had." He said with tears in his eyes. Hahaha! After his second helping -- he said if I made it for him once a week he'd have to marry me. I've made MANY dishes for him, but never got this kind of reaction. This is so far my favorite and his. I let others taste it and they've always called me back to get the recipe. The only things I did differently is -- used regular butter instead of ghee, cut the chicken into bite sized peices, and when finished, spooned over basmati rice. NOTE: Indian spices are much cheaper and better tasting when bought from an Indian market. I have a new found love and respect for Indian food.

I made this last week with minor modifications. I used chicken breasts, fresh tomatoes, added 1 cup of chicken broth (half with the tomatoes & half toward the end to make more sauce), and some cayenne (maybe 1/4-1/2 teaspoon? I just shook it in until it looked right) & used 4 cloves of garlic. I also threw in a small can of green beans toward the end. Served it all over basmati rice. Fantastic!
I made this with a friend and we both loved every bite of it. We had to force ourselves to stop eating so that we would have leftovers for lunch the next day (tasted great reheated, but the cilantro lost a bit of its zip after being microwaved). 
If you like Indian food, I think you will like this recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us.

Can I just say - WOW!  I love all the different flavors in this recipe.  I really like that all the flavor comes from the spices and not fat!  It was even better left over the second night!  I find that cilantro loses its great flavor when it is cooked so I just used some fresh chopped cilantro as a garnish.  I also used chix breast cut into strips and it was great.  I wish I could give this dish 10 stars!

This is a keeper! Even my fussy 8 yr old enjoyed it. I made it with drumsticks and chicken breasts in the crockpot. The aroma  ( and taste) was so dee-lish! I love the blend of all the  spices. Its different from my usual repertoire, a refreshing change. I served it with brown rice with peas mixed in it.

Absolutely loved this recipe! Had Pakistani food in Washington D.C. wasn't sure how this recipe would compare and it was BETTER than what I was served there. Had friends over for dinner who could not stop talking about how good it was. Served with Naan and it was the best. Thanks!

Made this exactly as per recipe and it was quite good, but the spices had a raw flavor.  Next time I will change the process and sauté the chicken in the oil first and remove them from pan, next add the onion and garlic to pan and sauté for a couple of minutes before adding ALL of the spices and allowing them to bloom.  Then add tomatoes and juices to deglaze the pan before returning chicken and juices to pan and following the rest of the directions from there on. Adding ginger and cilantro at the end works for me.  Served with basmati rice.  Great flavor!

Every one enjoyed this chicken recipe. It was quick and easy to make. I used chicken breast and stewed tomatoes, since that is what I had to work with. I added tomato juice to the stewed tomatoes & only sprinkled the cilantro. Paired with the basmati rice we had a delicious meal.

I made it exactly as listed. Was worried about the ginger making the dish too spicy for my kids but it was perfect! There were so many wonderful flavors. The ginger and cilantro at the end make the whole dish WOW! I’ve never had this prepared anywhere else so I have nothing to compare to but on its own with no preconceived notions it was amazing! Pretty heavy so serve with some lighter sides and ice cream for dessert!

Lovely flavours! I used cayenne instead of chili. I reduced the amount of tumeric by 1/4 and would further reduce it to 1/2. Otherwise, the spices were perfect. If you want you it little spicier, add more cayenne/chili.

I made this recipe basically as-is, and it was fantastic. The only changes I made was adding bell pepper and using regular butter instead of clarified butter. I’ll try to make clarified butter next time to taste the difference. The flavor profile is so rich and spicy (not hot). Everyone in my family loves it, and I’m definitely adding it to my regular rotation.

I had made chicken cacciatore before but the spice combination on this dish is really good and overall it tastes better. I  added some tofu which added to the richness. I may try to do this only with tofu next time and turn it into a vegetarian dish :)

Absolutely delicious. I didn't have fresh ginger so I subbed 1/3 tsp dried ground, and I was a bit shy on the right amount of cilantro - but even so the flavor was outstanding. The whole family inhaled this, no leftovers!

Followed recipe exactly. Does not have much heat, so the second time we made this we added some cayenne to give it little more kick. Very flavor and we have this dish with Basmati rice.

We've made this recipe dozens of times, and absolutely love it!!! Even our 6 year old daughter enjoys it..

Sometimes, we add red bell pepper (at the same time as the tomatoes).

Would recommend this recipe for sure!

It's not 'Jalfrezi', but it's good! This is a very good dish with some depth of exotic flavors from the fresh ginger, cilantro and spice mix. As with other reviewers, I threw all the ground spices in at the start with the onions, garlic and oil, before adding the chicken. I did not use the ghee, so next time I would use two cans of tomatoes to make enough sauce. I'd also ramp up the spice level with 1 to 1.5 tsp of chili powder.

We really enjoyed this. It tasted more like Indian take-out than any recipe I've tried at home. I added a red and a green bell pepper, as another reviewer suggests. Also, I did not have coriander or as much fresh cilantro as it called for, so I am sure that it would be even better with all of the spices. I also did not use fresh ginger or garlic and instead used lesser amounts of minced garlic and minced ginger from Penzeys Spices. Worked great!

My kids loved this. Just the right amount of spice. I didn't have turmeric so I used half curry powder and half garam masala and it was great. Both have lots of turmeric in them. I made a cucumber salad with it.

The flavors are unbelievably delicious! I only made a few slight changes: I took other's advice and fried the spices in the oil first. I added two cans of garbanzo beans, used LOTS of minced garlic and did not take the time to clarify the butter (to make ghee.) I halved the salt and also diced half of the onions and added them near the end. It was perfect and I will be making this for years to come! Really easy--ONE PAN!--and really Fantastic!!!

My changes were this: I used 3 tablespoons of clarified butter instead of 2. 1 large chopped fresh tomato in addition to  1  10 Oz can of RoTel diced tomatoes and green chilis .For the teaspoon of chili powder i substituted  1/2 tsp of ground poblano and 1/2 top of cayenne because that is what I had,but the spice level was perfect if your not into overly hot food.I also added 3 thinly sliced carrots with the onion.Turned out to be as good as any restaurant's and better than most.

One of my new favorites. I recommend using about 1/4 or 1/3 cup cilantro instead of 1/2 cup. One-half cup makes it a little too tangy. I also added about 2/3 cup raisins which gave it a slight sweet element. I used 8 yellow potatoes as the carb instead of rice. Very, very tasty!

I had fire roasted tomatoes instead of plain, or with chilis because that is what I had on hand.  Also, I added a half teaspoon of cayenne.  I like a little heat.  Did not have ghee or time to make it.  I used regular butter.  It tasted good and flavorful.

This recipe is amazing and literally feels like having a mouthful of heaven.  I have made a couple of revisions to the recipe.  1:  I use bone in chicken thighs, removing the skin and trimming off most of the fat. 2:  I don't add the garlic until I add the tomatoes; it might be a lack of skill on my part but it always burns if I add it in the beginning. 3: I use a fresh chilli instead of chilli powder.  I char it on the stove first, deseed it and chop it up before adding it in.

This recipe as written is good for those who don't like heat. But originally this dish should be spicy & flavorful. Very easy dish to make. Your version was great for "American" taste buds visitors. It was flavorful & not overpowering for those not accustomed to Desi spices. We make it different & spicy! For the chili powder, We use the xtra hot chili powder (Laxmi brand). & if no fresh hot chilies then cayenne is used. We fry most of the seasoning in ghee. Then add the onion & garlic. Then put in 2 diced hot chili peppers (or 1 to 2 tsp cayenne) Let fry for a minute or 2. Then put in cubed chicken breast, & cook for 15 minutes in the fry season/onion mix. Then add 4 large fresh chopped tomatoes, 1 green & 1 red pepper, the ginger, &  TBS of The juice of lime.  When 20 mins have passed, add 1 tsp of garam masala. Then continue to simmer for maybe another 10 or 15 minutes. Then you can add the chopped cilantro. We don't try to reduce the liquid. You WANT the juice so you can serve it over prepared basmati rice.

Delicious savory flavor and ahhh the aroma! Caution, read the recipe ahead of time; cooking took much longer than I had anticipated. You don't want to keep your guests waiting. I am hoping the vacuum sealed leftovers are as good as the fresh dish.

I followed other reviewer's suggestions and cooked my spices, onions and garlic in oil first and then added my chicken. I used a small can of tomatoe sauce in place of the tomatoes since I dislike the texture of tomatoes. Great dish!

Delicious! Doubled the recipe, reduced turmeric, added paprika, green pepper & cayenne pepper. Served over cauliflower rice for good crunch.

This was good, not great, but good. It was better the second day so I think it needs more simmering. Next time I will add some broth to have more liquid to cook down, so I can simmer it longer.

Very good. I made it with chickpeas instead of chicken for my vegetarian wife, as suggested by another reviewer. We all really liked it. But I would cut the salt back a bit as it seemed a little too salty. Serve with yogurt on top.

Makes a nice, filling crockpot recipe. 

Option 1: Dump everything except cilantro, crockpot on high for 3ish hours (until the chicken shreds easily. Cilantro in the last 5 mins. 

Option 2: Sautee the onions, garlic, and spices for 5-10 minutes before putting them in the crockpot. 

I skipped sautéing and it was still yummy. Will make again.

Could have added a bit more chilli powder. Lacking a bit of punch in the sauce. Nonetheless, it's a good dish

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for posting this delicious recipe. The flavors are impressive. Better than restaurant fare.  Don't hesitate to impress your guest with this winner! I like to serve this with cilantro-lime rice, which may sound Mexican in nature, but since the dish already contains some cilantro, it is a nice, light-tasting compliment without overpowering the chicken.  The lime in the rice gives the curry a nice, cool, citrusy balance.

I was just looking for a recipe to use up some chicken thighs and had no idea what to expect. I've never had this dish before, so I can speak for its authenticity, but the flavor is incredible and it's super easy. I make this exactly as the recipe stated and will do so again when I make it next time. And the time after that.

I reduced the spices by about 1/3, due to people saying it was too spicy, because I'm a bit of a wimp. It's not necessary at all. Even for a wimp like me I wished I hadn't modified the spice...except for the salt. Definitely reduce the salt. I also added bell pepper and made it with quinoa instead of rice. This was so easy to make and tasted excellent. There was nothing left when dinner was over.

Made for the first time yesterday and we enjoyed it very much.  Tastes lovely and the blend of flavors is excellent.  Made per recipe with the exception of adding melted butter as I did not have any ghee.  Also added two teaspoons of sugar to take away the acidic taste from the tomatoes.  Will definitely make again.

I had it for the first time about three weeks ago and have made it about four or five times since then.  Everyone loved it. The only thing it needed was a little more liquid near the end, and so I added some water. Great dish. If I could aware more stars, I would.

Very flavorful and lovely on the plate also.  I did not add ghee and only used one tablespoon of oil to sauté  the onion and garlic. I used more ginger than the recipe called for….because I love ginger…and that was tasty, too. Very easy to prepare and it was a nice enough dish that I would serve to company.

Pulled up this recipe last minute and had to make a couple of substitutions but other than that I followed the  recipe and it was amazing! I used fresh bell pepper and some frozen peas and added some water instead of canned tomatoes, and used fresh parsley instead of cilantro and also added some chili garlic paste for some extra spice. I definitely will try the original recipe soon!

AMAZING! Only putting 4 stars because I did make some changes.  Omitted the ghee, used 2 cans of tomatoes (I like things to be saucy!), and cut back "turmeric", coriander, and cumin by a half teaspoon.  I say "turmeric" because I didn't have turmeric but found a sight that says you can sub ground mustard 1:1 ratio along with a pinch of saffron so that's what I did.  I'll make it that way every time!  Served with brown rice and naan bread.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

Made this for the first time tonight for dinner. I used boneless chicken cubes and butter instead of ghee. Also added some multi colored bell peppers towards the end and it actually turned out pretty good. My picky husband actually said it was good enough to pack and take for lunch tomorrow. He didn't think it was Pakistani though, it tasted more Indian. I usually use pre-measured boxed spice packets like Shan when cooking so I wasn't sure how the spices would turn out but it was pretty good. Doesn't beat my butter chicken recipe but definitely wouldn't mind making it again for the hubby :)

So I made this recipe twice now. Once with chicken and once with chickpeas. Both are amazing but the chickpeas ended up being a lot spicier so if you aren't using chicken decrease the spices.

This was quite good, but I used Indian red chili powder, and it was way too spicy. I will definitely cut back on that next time.

This is a terrific recipe! I made it exactly as written, and my husband and I both loved it. The only change I will make next time is to make it hotter, as it was very mild for someone raised on Tex-Mex cooking. Sriracha ought to do the trick.

Easy to make and easy to adjust to taste.  I like mine extra hot, so I used crushed habanero peppers instead of chili powder.  This is a very easy, yet delectable dish.

This was so easy and really tasty.  I didn't know what to cook and had everything on hand so I figured I'd give it a try. I thought there wasn't going to be enough sauce at first but it ended up being just the right amount.  I served it over rice and put a dollop of sour cream (I didn't have any plain yogurt on hand) on top of it.  I'm not sure what it's "supposed" to taste like but I really liked the flavors.  Oh, and I used plain ol' butter instead of the ghee and it turned out great.  BTW, my picky eater kid gobbled it right up!

i don't quite know what to think of this. It was good but I expected more rich flavour. Of course the fault was a little bit mine too as I was distracted for a moment and the heat had gone too high and burned it a little. Anyways everything I could taste of this was mostly cumin. Perhaps I need to try this again and see if the flavours would be more in balance if made more carefully :)

My family loves this recipe! Since I made it the first time, it's become a frequent request...from my 8-YEAR-OLD! I have been getting beautiful tomatoes from my CSA share, so using those instead of canned (I don't bother peeling). Last time I tried adding diced potatoes, so it becomes more of a one-pot stew - the potatoes thicken up the sauce nicely. But the family enjoys it the original way best.

Awesome! Mixed all spices, onion, garlic, and ginger together in oil, then added chicken and fried as directed.  I also added some chickpeas as I didn't have quite enough chicken.  I only had a bigger can of tomatoes and I didn't put it all in but it was more than the recipe amount.  Served with Naan bread, chopped green onions, and some sour cream.  YUM!  I didn't use the ghee as I didn't have any - didn't miss it at all. I think I will substitute chickpeas for the chicken to make this a veggie meal in the future.  FYI: flavorful but not too much heat.

I thought this was delicious, even better the second day.  I added zuchini and squash and used chicken breast chunks instead of thighs.  Very flavorful though.  It was a hit that I will have to make again.

BIG hit with the whole family - even my 12 month old gobbled it up (pureed). My husband said it was one of my best dishes ever. The only modification I made was to simmer it for about hour to make the chicken really soft and easy to puree. Definitely a keeper!

This is a staple around my place. Goes well with white rice  and definitely take the others user suggestion of just adding green pepper. Other than that keep it the same!

Great recipe! The amounts of each spice was excellent, surprisingly.  I only had fresh corriander and powdered ginger as substitutes and I wasn't sure about amounts. I crushed the corriander and added 1 1/2 tsp. For the powdered ginger I added 2tsp. Fresh definately would be better. Also  only half the salt was good. I figured you can always add more salt after, but it didn't need it.

If you are tempted not to add the butter, DON'T skip it.  It made all the difference.  This recipe is delicious and fun for enjoying some exotic flavors. The mixture of spices (which I fried by itself first) and onion I was frying the chicken in seemed dry so I added two cans of tomatoes but one can would have been plenty, just like the recipe says. I will make this again.

First time making this last night and will not be the last!!  This was fabulous and so easy to make. Just need to take a minute to measure all the spices and herbs into a bowl.

I sauteed the onions and garlic together in butter then added all the herbs and spices to the pan and gently fried them with the onion/garlic. Added 1/2 tsp of dried chili flakes for a bit of heat. 

Added the tin of tomatoes then added the remaining garlic, ginger and cilantro. Let that simmer for a good while...adding a bit of tomato puree and water to keep it from drying out. Added cubed chicken breast to the sauce and let it gently simmer in the sauce to cook. The chicken was tender and moist and the sauce divine!

As good or better then any jalfrezi I have had in a restaurant...we were delighted and can't wait to have it again. 

ENJOY!

This recipe is excellent. My husband and friends love it. I will admit to using powdered ginger when I'm out of fresh. I would say apprx 1/2 tsp per 1 tsp fresh. I'm a pinch-and-taste format, so the approximation is not exact.

Made it for a dinner party - was excellent and well received. Except, did not have the thick consistency I was expecting with a Jalfrezi. It was more like a dry-ish chicken curry. But while it did not meet my personal expectations, that was probably because I was looking to re-create something specific. Taste-wise, was excellent!

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  I omitted the ghee and served over basmati rice.  My only complaint is that it is a tad too salty.  I think 1 tsp of salt would be plenty.  Will make again!  Thank you!

I made this recipe for dinner.  It was amazing.  After reading many of the reviews I knew there was some wiggle room on the directions.  I used bone-in legs and thighs and doubled the tomatoes.  Was generous with the spices (didn't double) but followed the ingredient list to the letter.  Even made my own clarified butter.  This dish was a huge hit with my neighbors who don't like anything out of the ordinary.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. I found it to be a bit bland and would like to see it spiced up some. My husband on the other hand, really enjoyed it. He's a finicky eater. I'll be making this again, just kicking up the heat a notch. Thank you for sharing!

Yummy! I added a bell pepper with the onion and garlic then added all the spices before putting in the chicken. It was a good amount of spicy without being too much.

5 stars on flavor and ease, but I changed the recipe too much to rate it as such. Like a previous reviewer, I tossed all the ingredients (minus fat), plus some fingerling potatoes (halved) and cauliflower I had leftover, in my slow cooker. After 4 hours on high, we had an incredible meal. Great flavor for so little effort!

This is delicious if you like chicken and rice - period! I thought this was some exotic business when a co-worker pulled it out for lunch but OMG the chicken was so tendered and flavored beautifully - not too spicy or too fatty (as can happen when sauteed) nor dry either. Absolutely delicious with white rice, although a lot of complex one use ingredients for my household - and time consuming it was totally worth it!

Hey this recipe was fantastic! I make a lot of curry dishes so the flavors didn't overwhelm me and this was soooo easy.  I used Indian chili powder instead Mexican chili powder and it was delicious. I probably could have used less turmeric - I did use fresh tomatoes plus I added green/red bell peppers and served over basmati.

Thanks for the recipe!

Yum yum, Tasty. Very good rendition! I've tried other jalfrezi recipes, and this one is the best by far, plus it's really easy to make. Thanks!

I really loved this and it was easy to do (kid friendly) and super flavorful.  I followed the directions exactly except I omitted the ghee.  This was fast and I had every thing in my kitchen to make.  Thanks for sharing Alia.

I didn't care for this one, maybe I just don't like tumeric and should have reduced the amount called for. I was so excited before making it too.  :o(

We all loved this dish.  I cooked it much longer than it said to, but it was really amazing.  Since all I had on hand for the chicken was bone in skin on chicken thighs it needed to be cooked longer I just took off the skin. I served it over basmati rice, used butter instead of ghee, added green peppers like one person mentioned, and it was great.

I made a few changes just because I didn't have the ingredients in my pantry and I have one child with a milk allergy, so no ghee--used Olive oil as a healthy substitute.  I substituted 1/2 tsp ginger for the fresh ginger root.  I omitted the cilantro as I didn't have any.  I also toasted the spices for a few minutes all together and then added the onions and garlic.  I used skinless bone in chicken thighs and just broke them up a little off the bone as they were cooking.  We finished every last bit of this meal it was so delicious and it will be in our weekly menu from now on.

Very good recipe! I did make some changes. I did not use oil in the beginning, instead I used the ghee called for. I also boiled off water through-out cooking to help make a sauce and infuse the flavor into the meat.

I love this recipe! I don't make it to often bc it does take a while to cook, I make lavender basmati rice with it (so good). I do not make many any changes to the recipe bc it's perfect the way that it is.

I fried the spices first as suggested by another reviewer, and omitted the ghee (because i didn't have ghee and forgot to sub butter at least). Otherwise I prepared as written. I will not let it simmer uncovered for as long next time to have some more liquid remaining. Served over rice. Yummy!

Good recipe. But a staple ingredient for this dish are bell peppers/capiscum. The green ones are the best. Add them when you add the tomatoes so they can cook and soften.

Super tasty dish.  The thing I like about these sort of dishes is that you don't seem to need to be dead accurate with all the spices.  You can add a little more or less of this and that including the curry powder (I used cayenne pepper) to suit your taste and it still tastes superb. Serve it up with som papps, rice and Indian pickles, add a few bottles of Kingfisher and you are set!

This was sooo flavorful. The spices accented each other nicely and it was not too spicy (hot). Loved it! I grated the onion in the food processor to save on the tears. Skipped the salt since this calls for canned items that contain plenty of salt already. For protein, I already had half a roasted chicken in the fridge, so I pulled the meat from that and added a can of drained chickpeas to round it out. The garbanzos went in at the first stage where it calls for chicken. The chicken I added at the end, so it wouldn't dry out. Since too much turmeric can taste bitter to me that was halved. I replaced the other half of the turmeric with curry powder. By the end of the second stage, so much of the liquid had evaporated that a 1/2 cup of chicken broth was needed. Ghee was really easy to make from scratch using unsalted butter (and much less expensive). The difference between clarified butter and ghee is in the slow cooking that brings out the nutty flavor. Try it, it's worth it! Chicken Jalfrezi was wonderful with  the naan and cucumber raita from this site and basmati rice. Make extra, because it's even BETTER the next day for lunch! I may try it next time with green beans added as another poster suggested just to increase my vegi intake. Thanks!

I have never had Chicken Jalfrezi before making this recipe so I have nothing to compare it to, however, I found this to be AMAZING the flavors just explode in your mouth. It is unlike anything I have ever tasted.

This was a very good dish. I didn't have ginger so I just left that out. Instead of using ghee, i substituted with unsalted butter (2 tbs.). I served it over yellow rice and with pita bread. Some people have said that It wasn't spicy enough but it was fine for me. Make sure you are using red chili pepper- found at your local Indian/Pakistani grocery. Loved it, will make it again!

Easy to make, tasty, and healthy.  I Sautéed the chicken with spices in a separate skillet and then added when the chicken was 3/4 cooked, this keeps it tender.  Also added Nutmeg and Cinnamon which added some complexity along with a little brown sugar to balance all of the spices since I generally used more spices than listed.

Great recipe and very easy. I put oil and ghee (4tbsp) in first and then added all the spices and onion. Next the chicken and then after a couple of mins I added the diced tomatoes. I followed the recipes time and cover on and off directions after that. It turned out really well and we ate it with rice,bread and some yogurt on the side.

I followed the recipe closely except for using chunks of boneless chicken breast (added near the end so they would be tender and not overcooked) and adding about a cup of fresh wax beans.  It was very good and we all enjoyed it, although not quite so much as some of the other indian/pakistani chicken recipes we've tried from this site. Even my 2 and 4 year olds ate it though, so that makes it a hit in our book!  Thanks for sharing.

Great flavor!  My whole family loved it.  I used a little less salt per some reviews and I simmered it covered the whole time.  My family likes a lot of sauce for rice and bread.  Turned out perfect.  Will make again.

Alia, What a wonderful recipe.  I have a co-worker from Pakistan and I love her cooking.  I wanted to pay her back for all the wonderful dishes she has made me and I made this for her family.  She was surprised that a I made it.  Thank you for your recipe.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I even visited a local Pakistan market to get the authentic spices.  It does make a big difference.

This is a wonderful dish. The only thing I do is add green beans to this dish. I serve with brown rice. Delish.

I am cooking this right now and it smells wonderful!! I don't know how authentic it is, but the sauce tastes great!!  I didn't have all the seasonings so I added curry and sofrito for the cilantro and it tastes good!!!

Great recipe that I'll use (with some revisions) again. I felt it was too salty so I removed the salt.  Also, the recipe barely served our family of four so I've doubled it for next time.  I also cut the spices in half as we are spice wimps and we loved it!!

I have to say this recipe was amazing!  Everyone enjoyed, even the people who can't eat spicy food.  I just copped up red chillies for the spice freaks and they added themselves.

It found this to be a little too generic for my taste and the ground coriander and cumin was too dominant of a flavor.

Really good! The only change was using breasts instead of thighs because I had them. Now that I've made it, I'll use more spice next time, as others suggested. I served it over couscous with peas, which I know was crossing cultures, but it was delicious and the peas added some good color.

I tried this recipe and it was so good. Added a bit more garlic and left out the ghee. Husband & I love exotic tasing foods and this really was good. Would certainly make it again.

Delicious!!  Reminds me of chicken chaat.  I found that more liquid was needed.  Don't know if this was because the recipe was scaled down to serve 2.
Highly recommended!

This was a delicious easy way to use a bag of boneless, skinless chicken thighs.   I simmered the recipe longer than I was supposed and used melted butter (with milk solids removed) in place of the ghee.  It was a huge hit, even with my cilantro-hating husband!  I also served it with the Indian Scented Rice from this site -- a great match.

my husband and I both really like this!!  I've already made it twice....there seems to be a slightly bitter flavour with it, so I'm going to try cut down on the coriander, and see what happens....but still delicious, and it gets even better as leftovers!

Fantastic!  I left out the cilantro, since I don't like it, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and there's nothing that needs to be changed--so five stars (and I rarely give 5 stars).  I served it with Indian Style Basmati Rice from this site, also very tasty.

Delicious!  I made this with the "Peas Rice" recipe also from this site.  Very good together.

This recipe took a little time to put together but it was worth it.  Nothing difficult, but grating the onion did leave my arm pretty tired!  Will definitely add this to my recipe collection.  Thanks!

This was outstanding!  I did however make a few changes.  But not many.  I omitted the Ghee - only because I am dieting and didn't want the extra fat content, and I omitted the cilantro as I don't like cilantro.  These two changes still made this a 
great recipe -thanks Alia!

I just made this for my family.  I have been looking for a good recipe using Turmeric.  I have heard of the good health benefits of it.  This recipe was really good even though I didn't have all of the ingredients.  I didn't have fresh ginger so I used about a teaspoon dried ginger.  I also didn't have cilantro or coriander.  The recipe really tasted great.  I can't wait to try when I have the rest of the ingredients.

Jalfrezi Crazy!

This is without question the best jalfrezi recipe that I have tried. It was just as good as the jalfrezi at our local curry house. Thanks Alia!

To kick the heat up, I added two dry crushed habenros at the begining. In step three I added drops of Daves Insanity sauce with a toothpick until the dish had reached the desired heat.

You could also make this dish with cubes of lamb.

It wasn't bad but I thought it tasted a lot better before adding the last several spices..

This is sooooo good!  I did a few things differently though.  I used skinless boneless chicken breasts.  I cut them up in cubes.  I cut the salt down to 1/2 teaspoon.  I used regular butter too.  I didn't cook the tomatoes until the juice evaporated.  I wanted it to be a little soupy.  I served this over couscous.  Yum!

So good!  I'm so happy I tried this.  The aroma and flavor is so complex and spicy without being hot.  I didn't have time for rice, so I made couscous, which of course is Mediterranean, not Pakistani.  Still went great.  Hubby kept eating even after he said it was giving him heartburn!  Anyway, thanks for the recipe, can't wait to make it again!

I loved this recipe! It had a little warmth to it, but not too much. I used only 1 Tbsp oil and no Ghee to cut back the fat grams and I didn't miss it. Served it with basmati rice and cauliflower with fresh nutmeg.

This was awesome. I made the recipe exactly as written except used chicken breasts instead of thighs. This is very flavorful and my kids really liked it, not too spicy. I was a little scared adding such large amounts of the spices, but it was great. Thanks for the keeper!
