Made this for 4th of July celebration. Instead of a pie I did mini pie crusts .  I also added some blueberries. Turned out great. Got positive feedback. The pudding mix was very easy to make. Entire process was quick, easy and not too much cleanup!

Okay, great pie, but the recipe is a little vague. It calls for a pudding mix and heavy cream. Did this mean you make the pudding with the cream instead of milk? NO. MAKE THE PUDDING NORMAL WITH HOW THE BOX INSTRUCTS (2 cups cold milk). And then add the cream. This will fill a 9 inch pie dish.

Easy to make, nice a cooling pie.  Just sweet enough.  You can use just about any kind of berry, and even cherries are wonderful.

Vanilla pudding and fruit is a great combo, which is what this is- custard is made with eggs

My family devoured this pie - we had raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries - perfect summer dessert!
