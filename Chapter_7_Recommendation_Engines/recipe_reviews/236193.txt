Did not have the flavor I expected. It was more of a standard deviled egg, with a chewy vinegar outside.

Great idea, and they look so pretty!  The eggs were too sweet for my taste, and I don't care for the clove and bay leaf in the pickling marinade, but you could make this with any beet-pickled egg recipe.  If you plan to make deviled eggs from your pickled eggs, don't pickle the eggs too long, as the yolks get harder to work with.  They also pick up more of the purple color, making the filling pink rather than yellow.  I did half plain eggs and half purple, which worked out well and made a nice presentation.  Next time I would try for a creamier filling by using a food processor to break down the relish and yolks a bit more.

I love eggs pickled in beet juice and also deviled eggs. I never thought of combining them. This sounds so good. I have the eggs on now to give this recipe a try. Hope I can wait the three days!!

These are pretty...Unfortunately any time you pickle an egg in vinegar, it makes the outside white chewy and tuff.  I wish there was a happy medium, because I like my eggs tender.
