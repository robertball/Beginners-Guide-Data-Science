Peanut butter cups are my favorite and this has now become my favorite cookie recipe! Did this for a church bake & craft sale.  Decorated the jar Christmas-y, put it on a tray and surrounded it with baked cookies.  Big hit and big seller!
Tip:  When decorating the jar lid with a fabric piece, cut a square about 2" larger than the lid, secure it with a rubber band, cover the rubber band with ribbon, then trim the fabric.  Save yourself the frustration of cutting a fabric circle and then trying to anchor it evenly to the lid with the rubber band! There's a whole population of lost rubber bands living in my kitchen!

These cookies are so YUMMY!!!!  I have trouble not eating the whole batch!  My kids love to "chop" the peanut butter cups, but in a pinch those new Nestle's PeanutButter and Chocolate chips work too.  GREAT RECIPE!!!  They also make a great gift if you can get them out the door!

This recipe basically made crumbly balls of Reese's peanut butter cups and flour. I'm positive I followed the directions right. The dough was extremely dry, tasted like flour with a little bit of sugar, and when I finally managed to roll it into balls and bake it, the cookies turned into little rocks. I think something is definitely missing in this recipe.

FANTASTIC!! I've made these cookies a couple of times for events--someone always wants the recipe!  Always a hit giftwise as well...especially if you get really interesting jars to put the ingredients in. FYI- Wide-mouth large glass Ball jars are available at the 99 cent store, too! :)

I just recieved these as a Christmas gift from my sister in law, and they were WONDERFUL!!!! I could eat the whole batch all by myself, but I thought I'd better be a good wife and mom and share with my family, they didn't last long! Now my husband thinks since we have the jar, I can make another jar of it to have handy when we need a cookie fix, and not a lot of fuss!!! I highly recomend these!!!

I had intended to make up some of these jars as Christmas gifts, but I made the cookies first to find out if they were good. I have to say, they were not too exciting. They just tasted like a not-so-good peanut butter cookie with some chocolate mixed in.

These cookies were great! I used vanilla powder instead of extract, which left my kitchen smelling like Mrs. Field's in the mall! I'd never seen a recipe using baking powder with baking soda and not adding salt; so becauseI doubled the batch, I added 1/2 tsp. salt without any problem.  I don't think these are going to last too long... good thing I doubled the recipe!

This is a great recipe.  Not as frugal as I would like, as the peanut cups can be costly, but everything is a perfect 10!!

I made these for bridal shower centerpieces, I attached heart shaped cookie cutters w/raffia, and decorated the jars. They were a huge hit, and so easy to make! I have since made other variations and include them in gift baskets.

I wish I could say better things about these cookies, because I love REESES! Unfortunately, they were kind of bland. I know I read the directions right and used everything included, but they just didn't do it for me. They weren't awful or anything, and they sure looked good, but they weren't as chewy as I would've liked. Better luck next time!

This is a great cookie recipe.  I'm going to make this for our annual cookie swap!  I wanted to sample these prior to jarring it and giving it as a gift.  So as I was making them you need to read the whole recipe.  It does call for egg, butter and vanilla.  These are not listed in the ingredient list - it listed in the directions.  It is a rather thick batter and I may add a few more peanut butter cups in the next time (because I LOVE peanut butter!), but they were tasty as the recipe is.

I was planning on making this for gifts and baked them first to see how they tasted. I'm glad I  did because the cookies didn't rise at all. They all spread out and didn't rise. The taste is really yummy though.

Love this recipe! This one was a real hit at home with the kids. Cookie wasn't oily, texture was just right. Excellent recipe.

I made this and several other cookie mix in a jar recipes as baby shower favors (with baby related cookie cutters attached) and the cookies and the gifts were a huge hit!   The recipients  of this variety both asked for the recipe, stating that their families loved the cookies!

These tasted good.  I don't know what happened though 1) I substituted crispy crunch bars for peanut butter cups, 2) I let my boyfriend mix and bake the cookies.  These cookies tasted fine, although the only real taste was the chocolate bar chunks the rest of the cookie was fairly bland, but they kept trying to fall apart after baking and were a bit messy to eat. They were cookies after all, but I was expecting something a little more decadent.
