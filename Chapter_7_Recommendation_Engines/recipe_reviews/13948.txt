This is agreat dish!  Too inprove the spaghetti squash's tenderness, just put it in a baking dish close to it's size and add 1 1/2 cups of water for the same baking time and it will be wonderfully soft and perfect.

My boyfriend and I had never had spaghetti squash, but as he said, I would give it a 10 star if I could. I am not a fan of squash at all.... but this was so good... All the right blends of veggies. I didnt have fresh basil, used less of the dry basil, 
also sauted veggies in olive oil , and depending on the size of squash might take longer then 30 mins, i just did the knife test, and knew it needed  more time, so added 15 more minutes on.Had a medium size one and well there wasnt any left overs. I had a bowl and bf had the rest, he loved it.. So hats off to the chef who made this a keeper in our house. I also added  grated parmesan cheese on top after it was served, yummy we love cheese :) and a loaf of fresh bread to go with it is a 
meal in it self. This would go great as a side dish for the parmesan tilapia fish , that I also found on here. That too was good. I love to cook and have found so many good recipes on here, this is at the top.... go figure and I thought I hated squash.

I wanted to add a P.S. to my rating.  The next day I added some beaten egg and bread crumbs to the leftovers to add substance.  I formed the squash into round patties and breaded them with bread crumbs.  I then browned them in Canola oil and they were sooooo delicious.  My boyfriend loves this recipe and he loved what I did with the leftovers too.

We love this in our house.  But I've modified it a little to better suit our tastes.  Firstly I just put some puncture holes in the squash and throw it in the oven whole to bake -- it's much easier to cut when it's cooked and it's just as delicious.  I also skip the olives and onion to give it a fresher less complicated taste.  Lastly I use grape or cherry tomatoes, they're just nice and managable.

We really liked this new way to enjoy spaghetti squash. I did do some things differently. I microwaved the squash, both halves on a paper plate, skin side for 5 min. and open side covered with paper towel for 6 min. and it was done perfectly. Using suggestions from others, I sauted red pepper and onion together, added one can of Italian style tomatoes, undrained, and ripe olives. Tossed it all together and tried to save enough leftovers for next day lunch :o). It was really super, thanks James.

I enjoyed this dish, but was surprised by the taste/texture of the squash.  I read the reviews but for some reason was shocked that the squash 'noodles' were actually crunchy.  The taste is pretty neutral, so not offensive.  I gave it four stars because I feel that I just need a few more tries to get mentally adjusted to using these instead of real noodles, but once I get adjusted, they are just so much better for you than all those heavy blood sugar spiking real noodles, and makes the homemade garlic bread easy to justify!  You don't feel as heavy and bogged down and your meal is 500% healthier.

I had a half of spaghetti squash left over from last night and i can only do the spaghetti squash once in awhile for my DH as he is not a real lover of it.  SO to allrecipes I went to look for something to do with the rest.  I took all the ideas on the reviews and recreated a cold salad with using similar ingredients.  Scraped out the SS and added EVOO, just a couple of dashes, and then diced half a red pepper and 1 tomato and a half cucumber (seeded) Tossed in some scallions cut on the bias and 2 cloves of garlic and about a small can of black olives, salt and pepper,  Then about 1/2 cup of feta and some snips of fresh basil from my garden along with some fresh tarragon.  Cant wait for dinner!  Samples were divine!  ps  I always punch holes in my spagetti squash and then do in the microwave.  Let cool, slice and seed.  Will try the cooked version in a cooler season.  Thanks James!

I have to give this as low rating even though the recipe is sound.  The reason is how to cook the squash.  Temperature is wrong and so is the time.  First, do NOT cut the squash.  Instead, use a long bladed serrated knife to poke holes all over the squash (be careful!).  Put the squash in shallow pan (no need to butter or add any liquid) and bake at 375 degrees for ONE HOUR.  Remove from the oven and use oven mitts to hold steady with one hand while cutting with the serrated knife.  Cut in half then scoop the center seeds/fibrous strands out of each half.  Then use a fork to scrape the flesh which yields the spaghetti like noodles.  You will be able to see the "spaghetti-ness" before starting.  The squash is AWESOME.  It is very mild in flavor and can be used with any and every sauce/vegetable/meat/etc.  It does NOT taste like squash so feel free to go crazy.  It is also low calorie, low carb, NO fat (5.5 grams effective (net) carbohydrate plus 2 grams fiber and 30 calories).  Perfect for diets or if you just want something delicious and filling.  Might even be a great Thanksgiving treat (dinner, dessert or ??)

By far the best and most surprising dish i have made from this site.  It's amazing how much the squash tastes like noodles, in fact i prefered it.  It was very nice to not feel guilty for eating pasta.  I used 2 garlic cloves and left out the olives because I had none in the house.  I'm going to make this for my squash hating boyfriend next weekend.

Definately a dish you can be creative with.  No fresh basil so used dry basil and added fresh Italian parsley.  Oregano or sage would be good too.  Used olive oil and a little salt and pepper.  Great fall side dish.  Can be made ahead.  Reheat in microwave then add cheese, olives and herbs.

I am baffled how much some reviewers change a recipe then give it a rating.....they are really rating their own version, not the original!  Anyway, this was great just as written.  Please don,t skip the feta or substitute Parmesan because the feta adds just the right flavor layer, yum.  I have been making spaghetti squash for 35 years, I even grew it in the garden years ago, but this is the best  recipe I have ever found--- thank you

We have spaghetti squash often (substitute it for any dish calling for spaghetti pasta) and really love it. So when I found this recipe, with all its blend of vegetables,I just knew this recipe would be colorful and delicious. I normally like Parmesan cheese with spaghetti squash, so feta was something new. We did like this, but I missed the flavor of the Parmesan, and much prefer it over the feta. I used olive oil rather than vegetable oil and, of course, salt and freshly ground pepper.

CRUNCHY SQUASH? Note to cooks...if your squash is crunchy, as some people have mentioned, you have not cooked it long enough.

This is a great recipe. My husband absolutely loved it! I'll admit, I did not prepare it as written, I merely used the same concept. Here's what I did: I baked the squash as directed, scooped out the pulp and set aside. In the meantime, I used evoo to saute onion, garlic, zucchini and mushrooms. I seasoned with black pepper, paprika, a touch of salt, a pinch of brown sugar, and sweet basil. I added a can of fire roasted tomatoes. Next is where I started changing things up. I used a deep glass baking dish and put a layer of the squash down on the bottom, then i covered it with a layer of my tomatoes and veggies, then I covered with a sharp grated parmesan cheese. Then I repeated with the remaining squash and veggies and cheese (imagine you were making a lasagna). I baked on a low heat for about 20 minutes (just waiting for the husband to arrive home for supper). It was delicious!! The cheese melted nicely and it smelled fabulous. A nice addition would be a good crusty bread. I am excited to make this again. I appreciated that it is very flexible. You could vary the veggies considerably and still have a great dish.

If you don't have much time to cook, you can cook the squash in the microwave. Heat whole squash in the microwave for 3 minutes to soften the skin. Cut the squash in half. Place cut sides of squash down on a plate with some water on the bottom. Cover with plastic wrap to keep the moisture in. Heat in microwave for about 8 minutes (depends on the size of the squash). This is a delicious recipe!!!

Very, very good.  I did change a few things.  As printed on the sticker on the squash, I pierced the squash several times and microwaved it 5-6 minutes and let it rest about 5 minutes before cutting in half.  I spread a little butter and sprinkled the inside of each half with some salt, pepper & garlic powder.  Instead of vegetable oil, I used olive oil.  I added a little butter, white wine and lemon juice and sauted about 3 cloves of garlic.  Then added onions first, later added chopped bell pepper and portobello mushrooms.  After a few minutes, added petite chopped tomatoes (canned, drained).  Then poured over the "noodles" and sprinkled some parmesan cheese (did not have feta) and chopped olives.  YUM!  I'll try adding some fresh spinach next time.

This was excellent, it made the spaghetti squash taste more like spaghetti and less like squash! After halving the squash, I scooped out the guts (the stringy stuff that smells like pumpkin) with a spoon, scraping until I hit the firm, fleshy part. I did bake the squash for 45 minutes instead of 30, and added a little parmesan cheese to the top of the finished dish. I'll definitely be eating this again - especially because I'm on a diet and pasta is a NO NO! Thanks for the great recipe!

P.S. The seeds can be salted and roasted just like pumpkin seeds for a snack.

I really liked the taste of this and will definitely make it again. HOWEVER - the squash did NOT cook in 30 min and I even had the oven higher than 350, it took almost double time. Next time I will save the trouble and cook the squash in the microwave.

I used what I had on hand--a large spaghetti squash bought today at a local farmer's market, 6 ripe homegrown roma tomatoes medium dice, a small zucchini cubed, a bell pepper cut into bitesized pieces, a handful of sliced shiitake mushrooms, 4 cloves garlic diced fine, a small onion out of the garden diced medium, some coarsely chopped oregano, thyme, and parsley (just out of the herb garden)and a generous amount of grated parmesan.     To give the squash a little more flavor I diced up a couple of the cloves of  garlic and some of the herbs and sprinkled them over the meat of the squash halves before wrapping them in foil (for fear of them drying out too much) and baking them at 350F for 45 minutes. (Ended up putting them back in 10 more minutes for a total of 55 minutes)   I used an iron wok for cooking the vegetables. Sauteed the onion and garlic in EVOO and butter, then added the zucchini, mushrooms, a pinch of kosher salt, a little fresh ground black pepper, a few more fresh herbs, and finally the tomatoes.   Plated the squash and topped each serving with the sauteed vegetables, grated parmesan cheese, and garnished with a few more fresh herbs.

Wow-- This is such a good and easy recipe. I poled about 5 wholes in the squash and put it in the microwave for 5 minutes. This made it easier to cut in half. I added 1 1/2 cups of water to a baking dish and baked the squash cut side down for 55 minutes. It was perfect! I also used Kalamata olives instead of black to keep up with the Med. feel. YUM! Just remember that when you first cut it open, you need to clean out all the seeds and stringing stuff, just like a pumpkin. The thick squash you see will actually turn in to the spaghetti.

One word, yuck.  I have noticed that a lot of recipes on this website are nasty and people rate them 5 stars.  Is everyone eating  or the person who submits a recipe rates it like five hundred times.

A satisfying and surprisingly delicious meal! I sometimes add spinach for the extra iron, and almost always add chick peas into this dish for the added protien (and taste!). I have at times used (a lot of) parmesan when I had no feta, and this works. The recipe definitely requires longer cooking of the squash -- I give it an hour. There are usually lots of left overs, as there are only two of us, so I usually I bake them in a casserole dish, and cover the top with grated mixed cheeses. Leftovers can also be added to whole grain pasta & a simple (ie: jarred) tomato sauce.

An easier way to prepare the squash is to slice it in half, place cut side down in a shallow pyrex dish.  Fill the bottom of dish with water & cover with saran-wrap.  Micro btwn 15-20 minutes or until fork inserts into back of squash easily.  Followed the rest of the recipe other than using cilantro flavored olive oil in place of veggie oil.  Fabulous tasting!  Have already made it a few other times.

This was great.  I added mushrooms and zucchini, sauteed in olive oil.  I also added parsley. This is surprisingly filling!

Loved this dish-- if you are not a veggie I would add a grilled chicken breast for the perfect meal!

It is really silly to cook the squash in the oven.  Just poke it a few times and place it in the microwave for 10 minutes on high.  Remove, cut and use.  No mess, no fuss and no trying to cut a hard shell squash.  Works for butternut, Acorn and all others. Why waste time and energy.  Use you Micro to save money and time.

For the last poster--
microwaving is very easy and quick.  Cover dish with wax paper or place in a deeper dish and cover with a microwave-safe plate.  No toxins and very easy.

This was my first time making something with spaghetti squash.  The squash itself was ok, but I don't think it went very well with the feta and olives...and I LOVE feta and olives.

Delish and healthy! Sauteed the onions and garlic in cooking spray (a high quality teflon pan is such a worthwhile investment!) and actually boiled the squash to save some time. Yes, I know microwaving is quickest, but in order to make it so, you have to cover the dish with celophane, which I've heard is toxic when zapped, so boiling was the next best bet. Up the basil to 3 heaping T and don't substitute dried! Also, Italian diced tomatoes in a can instead of fresh adds a nice touch. The feta taste is excellent. I love spaghetti squash, and this is an excellent recipe!!

This is wonderful.  I used a combo of black & green olives.  It's also great with spaghetti sauce and sausage on top.  I may never want pasta again!

This was a really good recipe.  I added some sauteed chicken and it made for a hearty meal.  It could have had a bit more sauce, but not much (my squash was pretty big as well). I love this as an alternative to pasta.  My squash was not crunchy, but tender-crisp.  We liked it that way.  Spaghetti squash can really be mushy if cooked too long.  I will add more basil next time. My husband really liked it too and he can be picky when I try to make lighter recipes. We will definitely make again!

Delicious!  I ended up cutting out 1 tbs each of butter and oil because it was a little too oily the first time.  And I ended up using extra mushrooms (portabellos) because I *love* mushrooms.  Really, really yummy.

Yummo - Great recipe - thanks for sharing I did as you suggested and added a nice bright stalk of broccoli. The feta cheese and olives really make this dish pop really - don't judge this recipe without them! I am going to spring for some stronger tangy black olives next time. I might add some red pepper flakes too just to spice it up a bit. This is a definite keeper for my vegetarian meals. Great filling dish for a diet night too! As others have said my squash was on the large side and it did take 40 minutes to get soft.

I made this last night, and my family and I absolutely LOVED it!  I made a couple changes, however.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and I added asparagus.  The asparagus and tomato combination made for an absolutely beautiful display.  I also did not have fresh basil, so instead I used about 2 tbsp. of basil pesto, which was outstanding!  I stirred it into the vegetables after sauteeing the onion, garlic and asparagus and before I added the tomatoes.  I will definitely make this again!

What a yummy surprise! I'm new to cooking and I've never once even tried squash. I saw on the Rachael Ray show that squash helps stablize your blood sugar. I'm borderline diabetic, so thought I'd give it a try. I followed the recipe for the most part, but also added some fresh mushrooms. It was very tasty and I'm now not afraid of squash! It was a hit with my husband as well. :)

This Is delicious!! The first time I made it the squash didn't cook well, so this time I cut the squash in half, seeded it and placed it in a baking dish/pan face down with 3/4 cup water at 350 degrees for about 45 min...it is done when knife inserted in middle goes in easy. You have to adjust baking time depending on size of squash. I let it cool and 'twisted' the strands out with a fork. It came out perfect!! Thanks for a great recipe!

James, What an awesome recipe.  Last night I had Speghetti Squash for the first time.
It was absolutely delicious.  I used a little more garlic.  I didn't have feta cheese so I crumbled Asiago cheese.  I also added 1/3 of a yellow pepper and 1/3 of a red pepper.  It looked so colorful and beautiful.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us.  I will be making this very often.  I can't believe I missed out on Speghetti Squash all these years.  Thanks again.

This is an awesome recipe!  I used 3 cloves of garlic, a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes, 2 tsp. dried basil, and a handful of Kalamata olives.  I served the dish with focaccia bread, roasted garlic, grilled veggies (red peppers, zucchini, eggplant and red onions) and a bottle of good red wine.  We just loved it!!!

This was a delicious, easy recipe! I had some squash in my freezer from the summer, so I used it in this recipe. I made a few changes to the recipe. I did not include olives and used a can of diced tomatoes, instead of fresh. I also added asparagus and sliced portabella mushrooms. Awesome! The fresh basil is a must in this recipe! I made breadsticks to accompany the meal, but really didn't need them. The meal is filling! I'm excited for the summer, so I can make this recipe again, with fresh squash!

I've been making this basic recipe for years.  I would add that the seeds should be removed BEFORE baking; that way, when the baking is done, you don't have to deal with the messy hot seeds.

Outstanding.  I had to cook the squash about 20 minutes longer because the noodles were too crunchy, and they came out perfect after about 50 minutes in the oven.  I also used a large can of diced tomatoes in the juice instead of fresh tomatoes, and I used gorgonzola instead of feta because I love it.  Otherwise, it was all the same and it was absolutely fantastic!  My husband loved it, but our 2 young kids did not.

I am a vegetarian and really thought I was going to like this recipe. I followed the recipe to a "T" with no additions or deletions. I thought it was on the bland side. The feta gives it some kick, but just not enough for me. I don't now what would improve this for me. I think I will move on and look for other recipes.

Wow I like this even better than real spaghetti!! I had a spaghetti squash sitting on the counter for 4 months and I was worried it had gone dry, so I took someone's advice and placed it in a baking pan with 1.5 cups water. (I've microwaved spaghetti squash before, but that tends to dry it out). I also brushed the squash with canola oil and salt/pepper before putting it in the oven. I added olive oil, 3 cups canned crushed tomatoes, chopped spinach, black beluga lentils, and frozen basil. I omitted the olives. I didn't have onions so I used onion powder instead. I also added salt/pepper and crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce. I substituted shredded parmesan for the feta, but I tried a bit with feta and it was nice as well. This is such a quick, easy, and versatile dish!

Being my first time cooking and/or eating spaghetti squash, I was very nervous.  I'm not squash's biggest fan.  But I thought I'd give it a try.  Absolutely fabulous!  The sticker on the squash suggested microwaving it for five minutes then baking for 45, which I did, lining a pan with foil for the baking time.  I was out of feta cheese so I used ricotta instead, mixing it in at the last moment.  It still worked, but I'll be sure to use feta next time.  After I forked the squash, I tasted it.  Very yummy!  I think I'll also try it as a dessert with cinnamon and artificial sweetener, too.  Because of the squash cooking time, next time I think I'll cook two and freeze some for later use.

Used red, orange, and yellow bell peppers, and a red onion.  Along with the basil, olives, and feta, this turned into a really colorful (and delicious!) dish.  I renamed it "Confetti Squash"!!!  Very popular with everyone who tried it.

Great flavor ~ my kids loved it as the main coarse. It was also great reheated the next day when I served it with Lemon Garlic Tilapia (from this site). Makes quite a bit depending on the size of the squash used.

I baked the squash whole but next time I'll halve it and bake in 1/4" water because it comes out less crunchy that way.  Used cherry tomatoes, kalamata olives, red onion, and extra garlic.  YUM YUM!!!

Very good spaghetti squash!! It was easy to make and tasted good!  I did cook my spaghetti squash in the microwave so I didn't have to heat up an oven in the hot weather by cutting in half, scooping out the seeds, and then placing the halves cut side down and cooking them for about 6 minutes. (My spaghetti squash was huge!) I will probably make this again since it is so easy and I have a lot of squashes from the garden!

Delish! I just discovered spaghetti squash this week so I had to try this.  Although this is a fabulous way to eat it, I love it almost as much just plain with a little butter, salt, and pepper.  But making it this way was definitely more fun, and it looked prettier on the plate.  :-)  I didn't use any oil for sauteeing, just Pam, and 2 tsp dried basil because I can't get fresh here.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe was easy and very good.  I cut up chicken breast in bite size pieces and added them while sauteing the onions and garlic, also added a can of mushrooms.  Will make this recipe again.

Great vegetarian main! This dish was very filling and healthy (with low fat feta cheese), we both had seconds even if we already felt full after one serving...

This recipe is one of the best I have tried.  It is easy to prepare, and is ready fairly quickly.  The flavors blend well and it is always a success.  It is great in the winter and heavenly in the summer with tomatoes from the garden. Try it - you'll be glad you did.

This recipe is very versitile and sooooo good!! I've made it twice with moderations. I leave out the feta and the olives, saute a chopped red pepper with the onion, substitute a can of diced tomatoes w/Italian seasoning for the chopped tomatoes, and best of all, add a bunch of kale (chopped) in with the can of tomatoes. A dash of Italian seasoning too. Simply heaven!! And very healthy as an added bonus. Be sure to have bread to sop up the juice! :)

Delicious! It was difficult to cut the squash raw so I threw it in the microwave for 10 minutes and then it was very easy to cut and finish baking in the oven. Everyone raved over this.

this was a really nice new dish for me.  i had never made spaghetti squash before, and it will become a regular side dish for us.  thanks for the recipe.  the only real changes i made were throwing the squash in the microwave for about 3 minutes to make it easier to cut, and baking it a little longer than suggested.  i also used scallions in place of the onion because that is what i had in the house.

Delicious! This is kind of a "common sense" recipe where you can add or delete any kind of spice, cheese or veggie you want. You can treat this just like any pasta dish and let your imagination run wild.

This dish was a wonderful surprise.  It was very light and fresh tasting, a great summertime meal.  When I make this again, I think I will add more garlic and additional veggies.  I found that it helped to dry the squash strands on paper towels before mixing everything together.

This was very good.  My mother-in-law added a jalapeno and my husband suggested maybe adding ground sausage to it to make it a full meal.

What a fabulous recipe!  I served it as a vegetarian main course but it would be just as wonderful as a side with grilled meats.  Fresh basil is a must in this recipe but I used canned organic diced tomatoes with excellent results.  For those who have not tried spaghetti squash this is a perfect recipe to get started.

This recipe is delicious. I did add a few more veggies but other than that followed it. Next time I will bake the squash whole first because it was very hard to cut in half. I added some spinach, zuccini, and mushrooms. I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried and It was still very good. Very very good! And so good for you. This recipe is a keeper.

I've made this exactly as listed, and it was delicious. In an attempt to make it a bit more filling I made a few adjustments and created a customized recipe with chicken, roasted tomatoes, pine nuts and sundried tomatoes ... Amazing.

This was a great recipe.  It gave me a wonderful base for developing my own spin on the squash.  I took the advice of another and cooked it whole with about 6 puncture holes in it.  I cooked a little over an hour at 375F (I have a crappy, small oven so this will probably vary for you).  I let it cool about 30 mins, peeled the skin, cut it in half, and gutted it.  In the mean time, i sauteed a couple of diced porto mushrooms (as another suggested), 1/2 onion, 1/2 red pepper (as another suggested), and garlic in evvo, with salt, too, to help the mushrooms out.  I then tossed in torn basil.  I decided to layer the feta, and also used parmesan as another suggested, with fresh basil, salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper on top of the split halfs, and then add over that the sauteed veggies.  Next, I sprinkled more of the cheeses and fresh basil on top, and put in warm oven (200F) to meld flavors while I waited for my bf to get home.  it was fabulous!

I did minor alterations but still, fabulous.  I cut the squash in half, seeded and then filled each half with water.  Wrapped in foil and baked for 50 minutes.  Took about 4 tbsps of EVOO and warmed with basil stems for about 20 mins. Sauteed 1/2 an eggplant, red onion, red bellpepper, portobello, cherry tomatos, and about 2 loose cups of fresh basil. Seasoned with about 2 tbsps of Tony's and chili paste.  Sauteed on medium for about 20 mins.  Added the spaghetti squash and voila!  Served with wheat bread, pinot noir and brownies for dessert.

Delicious! I've only had spaghetti squash once before and it was bland but I decided to try it one more time. I am so glad I did. My husband and i loved this! Highly recommend this recipe!  I  tweaked the recipe by using canned tomatoes with basil and oregano and feta cheese with tomato and basil. I will definately make this again!

This was an easy, healthy and filling dinner!  I omitted the black olives and used up some zucchini that I had on hand.  The feta is what made the dish even better.  I have only prepared spaghetti squash in a more Italian-style (e.g. with marinara or with chicken parm) but this was delicious and will be made again.

So this was amazing! Of course I tweaked it. I cooked the squash in the microwave. I sauteed chicken breast, salt & pepper, olive oil, fresh basil & oregano from my garden, green pepper and used halved cherry tomatoes at the end, with a handful of fresh spinach. I didn't use olives, and wish I'd have had some feta. I sprinkled with parmesan to serve. I will never have spaghetti squash another way!

I made a couple revisions to the recipe based on what I had available to me. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil to make it more heart-healthy. My husband and I don't eat onions so I omitted onions completely. I didn't have any minced garlic so I ended up using garlic salt instead and the minced basil in the tube rather than chopped fresh basil. It came out great, was very easy and quick to make, and even my picky husband who doesn't like veggies thought it tasted good. Great alternative to pasta or good as a main dish for vegetarians. Will definitely make again.

Served this for Christmas Eve dinner, and it was a hit. Even people who don't like squash loved it -- it didn't taste like squash at all, more like pasta instead. I used kalamata olives instead of black olives and cherry tomatoes cut in half instead of large tomatoes. It turned out to be a very Mediterranean dish, which was well received by my Italian family.

This was superb. I added a purple pepper. I was very fortunate to have the squash, tomato, basil, and pepper all from my garden and I happened to have the other ingredients on hand. I highly recommend this recipe. I think it would also be delicious with shrimp added for company. Instead of baking I nuked the squash whole for 18 mins after forking holes in it. Make sure to use a plate to catch the juices if you try that method.

Third time making this - Love it!  Fresh garden tomatoes & basil are a must.  If you want to shorten the cooking time and zing it up a bit, cut squash in quarters, place in a mircrowave safe dish, add 3/8" of water to the bottom.  Lay a couple julienned strips of red pepper on each quarter along with a small pat of butter or drizzle with olive oil.  Cover dish with plastic wrap to seal.  Microwave for 8-10 mins.   Saute onions and garlic (with additional red pepper if you want).  I like mine chopped, almost minced.  Turn off heat and add tomatoes, gently mixing.  Add basil. Finish recipe as written by James.  (As I'm a feta-fan, I add over a cup. ) For fun, save the quarter shells and place the mixings back inside, like twice-baked potatoes, to serve.  Top with julienned red pepper and julienned basil.

Excellent! Really is a full meal, but I sliced some grilled chicken to go with it for the carnivores!

This was very good and healthy too.  I microwaved the squash which was much less time consuming.  Pierce the squash with a sharp knife about five times, microwave on a paper towel on high for 10-12 minutes turning three times.  Let it sit for 5 minutes, then cut lengthwise and remove the seeds.  I used canned tomatoes along with the other ingredients, added a little salt and pepper.  It was excellent...will definitely make this again.

My family love my tweaked version of this recipe. Instead of serving it as a warm salad or a side dish, I serve it as a one-dish meal. I brown one pound of spicy Italian sausages from Trader Joe's in a big pan, add onions and garlic to saute until soft. I turn the heat to simmer while I scrape the squash into the pan. Turn the heat up to medium, add salt to taste, add tomatoes, black olives, and basil. Heat through all ingredients and serve on dinner plate. Sparkle whatever shredded cheese in my fridge on top.

I have been making spaghetti squash for 30 years. Here's a tip. Don't cut it in half, that cuts the shreds in half.  Cut it across into circles, then bake. When you use a fork to remove the pulp, it will really resemble spaghetti.

I thought this was absolutely delicious. My husband and his friend weren't too crazy about it, but moreso because they didn't like the ingredients to begin with. I love tomato sauce, olives, and spaghetti squash. I made exactly as directed and wouldn't change a thing. I'll make it agian for myself, and this time I won't share.

I'm on a diet, so I cut back on the feta...overall this was very good and fresh tasting.  Needs a little salt and more garlic.

I don't like squash but this recepie made it taste really good. the feta cheese brings in a tangy flavor with good amount of saltyness. 
I used butter instead of oil to sautee the vegetables and i also used some orange bellpeppers, with fresh redvine tomatoes. Definetly don't miss out on the basil. Its a must! i also used feta cheese flavored with basil and herb instaed of regular feta.

Good recipe. A different and interesting way to prepare spaghetti squash. I made it with gorgonzola cheese (as I didn't have any feta on hand) and 1 can of diced tomatoes (I would use only half a can next time).Served it as a side dish with italian sausage. I saved the squash "shells" after I scraped out the flesh, and then spooned the finished mixture back into the shells to serve - it made a nice presentation. Thanks for the recipe!

I'm kind of neutral on this recipe. It wasn't super; it wasn't bad. I would recommend longer cooking on the squash, as even 45 minutes wasn't enough -- still crunchy. (Is it supposed to be that way?) Anyway, that may have affected my rating unfairly. It's worth trying again, as it's the first time I've ever tried spaghetti squash any way except plain with butter... new is good. Worth mentioning that three little kids liked it (and they've never had feta cheese or spaghetti squash before). Thanks for the recipe, James!

Delicious! According to the reviews the noodles weren't supposed to be "crunchy", but I liked them that way ... I purposely did not cook them longer because I tasted them when they were still "crunchy" and liked them so much! My husband loved it, too! Definently a keeper, something different than your normal fare : )
Update: I made this a second time and didn't have olives and accidentally left out the basil. BIG difference. We had to add pepper and salt and it was okay but I'm glad I'd written a review before to remember how good it was with the basil and olives!

This would get 5 stars if my spaghetti squash could have been cut open with a knife. Even my razorr-sharp French Chef's knife didn't work. What does work is to microwave the whole squash for 20 minutes on high, then cut in half and remove seeds, let cool, and proceed with remainder of recipe.

This is a great recipe but the cook time is way off. My spaghetti squash came out pretty raw. So I googled other recipes with this squash and they all recommended a cook time of about 1 hr at 375-400 degree.

We really loved this recipe. So much that I bought another on my next visit to the store. I have been told spaghetti squash was just like spaghetti. Not quite... I could not see how that was possible so I was not expecting it to be just like spaghetti. I was so pleasantly surprised by this dish. I had to make some alterations. I did not have fresh basil so I used cilantro. That added a pleasant zip to the flavor in my opinion. I also had a jar of artichoke hearts on hand and I added those but forgot the cheese. Turns out it did not need the cheese and I am looking forward to making this again. The next time I make this, I will increase the garlic to either 2 or 3 cloves. I noticed that I missed the garlic flavor when I was eating this and when I had it again for left overs. Very good.

This was very good!

After reading some of the reviews I decided that I should add water into the baking dish, while roasting the squash.  It could be a preference thing, but I probably will not add water next time, as my squash turned out a little too moist.  I also had to cook it about 15 minutes longer.  I also added roasted red and orange peppers.  I will definitely be making this again!

This dish was great! I served it as a main course last night since it's Lent I've been experimenting with more meatless stuff. The only thing I changed was I used fresh cilantro in place of basil. Great fresh flavors very light it had a Mediterranean feel to it .

I thought this recipe was really bland. There wasn't anything to bring the different ingredients together. I tried reheating the leftovers with some tomato sauce, and it didn't help very much. Oh well.

This is a fabulous dish...even great as a main dish! I cooked mine at 400 for about 35 minutes. I used a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and it was still terrific. GREAT substitute for starchy  pasta!

Wow, this was great!  I've never made spaghetti squash before and I thought I'd need to add some salt or other seasonings to the recipe but it was wonderful as is.  I'd probably add a lot more tomato next time.  Be sure not to go cheap on the feta cheese!

Just made this and I am quite thrilled with it. My boyfriend HATES squash (and olives...) so I changed it a little, but I think we've found a winner. I also added a little oregano, a tablespoon of creamed honey, and some cumin, garlic and onion powder, and Korean chili powder (mostly because I have a hard time tasting things). Without these things it's quite good, my boyfriend liked it (he has a strong palette), I just needed a little more kick. 

Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I think this is a really good foundational recipe -- I'm sure there's a bunch of ways you could shake this up. It was my first time trying spaghetti squash, and first I absolutely second the person who said you should pour a cup and a half of water into the pan before cooking the squash -- that's how it cooks in half an hour.

Concerning the texture of spaghetti squash, for those new to it: someone said it was crunchy, and that's not quite right.  Nor is it tough, but it's missing the chewiness of pasta-spaghetti.

I had some left over spaghetti squash and was tired of the marinara / tomato sauce route. I wanted something to accompany my fish - this took little to no time at all and the results were fantastic!!

I didn't follow the measurements specified, just eye-balled it. I sautéed the onions in EVOO, until it was the palest of golden brown. Threw in the minced garlic, crushed red chilli pepper, and roughly chopped basil. Mixed it all up and then added my spaghetti squash, a little bit more EVOO, roughly chopped tomatoes, kalmata olives, and small chunks of feta - it looks as good as it tastes!

I'm taking this for lunch tomorrow - mostly to see how well it heats up in the microwave. If all goes well, I know what I'll be bringing to my next potluck :)

This was delicious! I have made it twice and let me just say...make sure you cook your squash long enough to ensure the texture is like pasta. Yum!

This was the first time that I made spaghetti squash.  I didn't add the olives but I will next time. My husband and I liked this dish.  We ground some sea salt on it before serving.

Made this last night following original recipe as written by James. Used fresh basil and tomatoes from our garden.  Excellent, as written.  Will add a few more black olives next time for our personal taste.

Followed the recipe, but didn't measure anything. It was delicious! I've never had spaghetti squash before & didn't really have high expectations for it... but I really enjoyed it. Will make again!

No stars. This is my first time trying spaghetti squash. It sounded like tasty meal from reading other reviews. The squash took an hour until it was tender. The flavor was so bland. I hope to find a better reciepe.

Absolutely LOVED this dish!  A blend of flavors spices up the spaghetti squash nicely!  Will definitely make this again.  My spaghetti squashed weighed 3.5 lbs before I scooped out the seeds.  My alterations to the recipe:  I didn't have a regular onion so I used 1/2 a red onion (aka purple onion) and 4 green onions instead.  I used 3 cloves of garlic, 2 cups of tomatoes, 4oz of feta cheese crumbled, 15oz can of black olives drained and chopped.  I added a dash of onion powder and instant minced onions.

I buttered my squash and started baking face down. Half way I flipped it face up and finished baking. I did not have the same ingredients so I improvised. I used frozen mixed vegetables (peppers, yellow squash, green beans) and added a can of Italian seasoned diced tomatoes with the liquid. I did not have feta cheese so I used Mexican Queso Fresco crumbled and parmesan cheese. It was fantastic!!!

This was really good! I made just as described and it was really different. This was my first time using spaghetti squash, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. My picky husband said he'd definitely eat it again!

This recipe was really tasty.  It was my first time ever trying spaghetti squash and I enjoyed it.  My husband was a little leery,  after bad experiences with spaghetti squash as a child, but he really enjoyed this too!

Wow! I can not believe how really really good this recipe is and healthy as well!!! I also can't believe how incrediably easy it is to make either. The hardest part was splitting the squash before roasting it in the oven. I used an ice cream scoop to scoop out the strings when it was done. After I cooked it, all I had to do was saute the onions and garlic, add in a can of undrained petite tomatoes, some delicious basil pesto my daughter had made, top with the fat free cheese and a fee fresh olives, then add the squash. Both my husband and I thoguht it was delicious and not as heavy feeling like pasta. Excellent recipe!

Easy, delicious, healthy!  I made this twice, once as is, and once with goat cheese instead of feta. It's great either way!

Wow!  I got a spaghetti squash in my CSA crop share, and didn't know what to do with it.  I found this recipe and had all of the ingredients, so I made it as a main dish for one. SO GOOD!!  This will be a regular recipe from now on. :D

I'm clean eating so this was a great recipe to file away.  I added chicken breast and thighs sauteed in olive oil.  I removed the chicken and sauteed the onion and 3 cloves garlic and a cup sun dried, not in oil, tomatoes.  After they cooked a bit I added some swiss chard.  Omitted the olives because I was out and used goat's cheese rather than feta.  Super delicious and easy.

This was DELICIOUS!!!  I baked the squash halves for 40 minutes and they came out perfect.  I also eliminated olives simply because we didn't have any.  My husband loved this, too -- can't wait to make again!

I cooked the squash for 30 mins in 1-2" water in the oven. The knife could go into the outside easily. The squash was still a little crunchy. Would cook for at least 10 more mins next time.

Ok.  Wasn't overly impressed, but it wasn't bad.  I added more seasoning to make it more flavorful and baked the squash about 50 minutes in a little water as suggested by other reviewers.  I may make again since I have to eliminate gluten from my DD diet.

This is an excellent dish!  Fast, easy and delicious. Even though I didn't have all of the exact ingredients on hand, I still loved it - it's a great idea and you can change it up so easily, just like the author said. I didn't have feta, olives or fresh basil, so I used grated swiss, chopped green pepper (added it just after the garlic), and 1 Tbsp of dried basil. I will make this again and will try it with the ingredients it calls for.

I thought it was really pretty good considering your using squash for noodles.  The squash "noodles" have a mild squash flavor which is easily covered by all of the flavorful ingredients.  I used EVOO  instead of veggie oil, a purple onion (not sure if it was better or worse with it), the feta cheese was also fat free basil and tomato flavored.  Overall, I'll make it again since my husband has been "successfully" on the southbeath diet!

This recipe is amazing!! Since I have discovered it I've made it on numerous occasions.  The most important thing though is to make sure that the squash is cooked properly, 30 minutes is not nearly enough.  I suggest baking it for 1h with some water on the bottom of the baking dish, removing it and allowing it to cool, removing the spaghetti from the shell, placing it back in the oven with some oil and cooking it another 30 min.  That way it will be truely tender!  Absolutely delicious!!

Delicious - but interesting. It also seems to be a very versatile recipe from the reviews I read before making this. Added some chopped up zucchini and used garic powder instad of a garlic clove. I think this will definitely grow on me.

Very easy and very good. Only hard part was cutting the squash in half...make sure you have a good big strong knife :-) I followed the directions exactly. My squash took closer to 45 minutes to cook, but that could be my stove.

This was pretty good!  I had never had or made spaghetti squash before but I got one free from work (I work at a farmers market) and gave it a try.  I don't think I could eat it as a main dish, but it's a good side dish.  Boyfriend loved it.  I did bake it in a pan with a little water in it, and baked it about ten minutes longer than the said time.  I omitted the black olives, and had dried basil instead of fresh so I used a little less, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Tried this recipe and using spaghetti squash for the first time a few weeks ago, and it was a hit! My husband is very skeptical about vegetables that mimick other things.  He actually said this was "delicious"!  When I told him we were having it tomorrow, he was excited for dinner.  Wow, amazing recipe.  We weren't able to use all of the spaghetti squash for the dish, so saved half of it for another dish.

This is a tasty way to eat veggies.  I added extra feta cheese, both because I love feta and because I thought this dish was a little too sweet and needed more of a salt element.  Just adding salt might have done it if I hadn't wanted to use extra feta.  I'm not sure if I really cared for the fresh basil, so if I don't have any on hand next time I won't stress about it.  I cooked the squash in a 9x13 glass baking dish with some water in it.

This was the first time I cooked spaghetti squash, and I felt it was really good!!  My husband even said it was good!  I prepared squash by boiling whole until it was soft, while looking for recipes on the internet, instead of baking.  I don't know that I could have cut in half prior to boiling anyhow.  I also only had green tomatoes, so that's what I used, and kept them in saute pan longer.  I think this is a really great recipe though, and would try it exactly as it's written next time.  Thank you!

I have to give this two stars because the "noodles" were pretty crunchy.  I followed all of the directions and suggestions from other users: I put the squash in water, poked a couple fork holes in the exterior and even let it cook an extra 15 minutes.  The flavor was okay with the sauteed onions and feta.

I am on the South Beach Diet and found this recipe was a total fit.  I chose to add additional vegatables (mushrooms, green pepper & zuccini thinly sliced to the onions.  I doubled the squash and fed the family.  Normally I review the original recipe but this worked a I needed to have more vegys at this time.  It was great and you can expand as I did.

Have made this many times and always enjoy it.  I prefer to have more veggies than just the tomatoes so always add peppers (any colour) mushrooms, zucchini, etc.  Don't care for olives so don't add them, but do add the feta and the fresh basil is a must!!!

Super easy to fix and great tasting.  I added chicken and the next time I think I'll also add artichokes.

This was very good....the squash didn't cook at all in the oven, so after the 30 minutes, I popped it into the microwave for 5 minutes and it was cooked....the 30 minutes was hardly enough. I took some advice of others and added some fresh spinach to the mix with the tomatoes. I also had some leftover grilled chicken that I chopped up and added as well. I omitted the olives (personal preference), and I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I also added some red pepper and sauteed those with the onions. Will definitely make again...Yummy!

I made the following changes in this recipe: I scooped the seeds from the squash after it was cooked. I substituted 1 can of diced tomatoes with garlic and basil seasoning for the fresh tomatoes. I omitted the feta cheese, black olives, and the fresh basil.  I added the spaghetti squash to the tomato/onion mixture. Then I transferred to a casserole dish and placed on a warming tray until ready to serve. Dish was bubbling hot when I topped with grated parm/reggiano cheese and served. Very nice flavor and big hit with company.

Great side dish !  I followed the recipe as close as I could. Did not have fresh tomatoes, I used a can of diced tomatoes w/herbs(dained) and only used half of onion. 2 cloves of pressed garlic. I did not have fresh basil. I will make sure I have it next time. Lot's of flavor, my 11 year old had 2nd helpings ! I will make this often.

We loved this recipe! I am always looking for meatless dishes.  I did make some changes...I added lots more garlic, artichokes, dried oregano with the basil, mixed in half of the feta.  I probably used more feta than the recipe calls for.  Serve topped with more feta and the olives (I used green). For the leftovers I mixed 2 beaten eggs (use 1 egg per cup of leftovers) and 1/4cup parmesan cheese and made a fritta, that was really good.  This would make a great brunch dish.  I had it for lunch the next day.

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe as is - no substitutions needed.  I ate the leftovers cold for lunch the next day - it's better warm, but cold wasn't bad.  I will definitely make this again and again!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I have never had spaghetti squash and was pleasantly surprised. I added yellow peppers and mushrooms to the recipe. Excellent!! I would recommend draining the squash really good after cooking. Got kind of watery!

This was really simple and came out great.  I didn't have the feta or olives, but I just sauteed up some veggies I had and added some tomatoes.  Then I topped it off with some grated parm (less fat than feta too).  Low fat, low carb, low cal.  I loved it and I will use this recipe again.

I found this recipe delicious as did my family.  It is a great recipe for those just transitioning to a more healthy diet.  Simple directions and quick preperation also made this recipe fun to make.  My only problem was cutting the squash before baking.  I baked it first, then cut it and baked again until done.  This made cutting much less difficult and dangerous.

Delicious and versatile. Use whatever kind of veggies you have on hand or prefer and whatever cheese you have.
For those who find it difficult to cut the squash prior to cooking, microwave it instead. Put in microwave whole, you can slit some air vents if you like, but not necessary. Cook until a little bit soft, then make the air vents. When soft enough to cut ( the time depends on size of your squash), it will cut easily. You can finish cooking in the microwave or put it in the oven. It's also a snap to remove the seeds and seed threads after it's already cooked.

Excellent!  This was my first experience with eating or cooking spaghetti squash.  I've since tried a few other recipes, but keep coming back to this one.  It's a great recipe to play with and substitue ingredients.  I also found that I prefer it slightly chilled or room temperature.  Tonight I am making it without the feta cheese, but am adding capers for that slight 'tart' flavor.   Goes well with lamb.

This is my favorite summer meal since it's so light tasting and healthy.It's so easy to make, but I change the recipe a little bit to make it a complete meal.  I cut up chicken breats and cook them in a non stick pan with some seasoning and then add them into the squash just before serving.  I also use cherry tomatos, as they have a better flavor.

This recipe is amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out perfectly.  I have been a vegetarian for less than a year, so I am still building a base of go-to recipes.  This one is in!  I've been trying to replace typical high carb and high fat pasta dishes with healthier choices, but sometimes vegetables alone don't leave you with the same "satisfied" feeling.  This one does.  I didn't think squash could taste this good.  My teenager actually thought it was pasta until I told her.  And my 9 year old devoured it!  The feta definitely makes the recipe.  A wonderful taste combination.

This recipe is truly a delight. My carniverous boyfried and picky best friend both *loved* it. There were no leftovers! 

I made a few modifications based on other reviews and my own preferences:
- Goat cheese instead of feta. I love the sour creaminess of goat cheese instead of salty feta. 
- Added artichoke hearts.

I think I have found my pasta! this was yummy. I made mine with grape tomatoes, onions and mushrooms. I added fresh rosemary, a splash of smoked tabasco sauce and parm cheese.

This was fantastic.  I added fresh mushrooms and left the feta on the side, we prefer to sprinkle it on ourselves.  I think this could have used more basil and garlic, it was a little bland.  I will definitely make this again.

I thought this was fabulous.  I had never made spaghetti squash, and it was quite hard to cut in half. I added a little water to the bottom of my pan that the squash was cooking in, as another reviewer suggested.  I left too much of the stringy stuff that the seeds hang out in when I seeded it, so I had to spend time picking it out after it cooked.  I added a can of mushrooms to the onion and garlic at the same time as the tomatoes.  This is really yummy and healthy!

I have made this a few times, a little differently each time, and it always turns out very good.
I have braised the squash to keep it moist, added mushrooms and parsley, used shredded Italian blend cheese instead of feta, and subbed Italian diced for plain tomatoes.
Definitley a versatile keeper!

This was a great variation on the usual marinara sauce I usually use on Spaghetti Squash. I used canned diced tomatoes(drained instead of fresh)and olive oil instead of vegetable but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Next time, however,I will use kalamata olives instead of ripe black olives -- I think they will give the vegetable mixture much more "zip".

Great Flavor.  I would make this again.  I would have given this recipe 5 stars but just baking the squash for 30 left the squash hard and I even cooked it longer.  Next time I would put some water in the baking pan.

I love spaghetti squash but never really knew what do with it. This recipe was fabulous. I will definetly be making this time and time again. I had a large squash so it look about 45 minutes to cook. I recommend cutting the squash into 8 pieces to speed up the baking time. I substituted zucchini for olives and sauteed them a few minutes before adding the tomatoes. Thanks for this one!

This was pretty good and healthy.  I agree that it was a bit bland but nothing that a bit more basil, salt and feta didn't cure.  I might also add a bit more garlic next time--and there will definitely be a next time!

I Love this! I cooked Squash for 1 hour as I think mine may have not been ripe all the way since I could hardly cut through it.  I used canned sliced black olives because that is what I had on hand.  The fresh basil and feta makes this absolutely delicious!  Served with salad and french bread.

This was easy to make and delicious! First time I've had spaghetti squash and it won't be the last! Even my one-year old loved it (I cut up the strands for her)! I didn't have fresh basil so I used about a teaspoonful dried and added it to the onion/garlic mixture.

Never tried this squash before. Loved the recipe! Added some fresh spinach, sliced zucchini and asparagus.  WW Winning points -- it's about 3.5 points per serving and very satisfying.  Will definitely make it again.

Left out the black olives, as we aren't fans.  
Fantastic recipe.  Quick note -- if you anticipate left-overs, serve the feta as a dressing to avoid reheating meltdowns.

Very colorful and tasty dish, and it is relatively quick & easy to make.  The spaghetti squash has a great "crunchy" texture that reheats well.  I added extra garlic and feta cheese because my family likes a stronger flavor.  I have served it to guests and received lots of compliments on it.  We love this dish!

Excellent and versatile. One great suggestion is to cut the squash across in 2 inch slices instead of length wise. This will produce much longer strings of  "spaghetti" like strands.  Google this....it really works. If you have the time also sprinkle the slices with salt and let sit for 15 minutes. This helps to draw out a lot of extra water. Brush off the excess salt and bake in a 400 degree oven on parchment paper for 30 to 40 minutes. Shred the squash and layer between paper towels or you can spread out the shredded squash back on the baking sheet on parchment and put back in the oven while prepping the rest of the recipe. This will help dry the squash even more.  I followed the recipe while adding some extra garlic and oregano. Great as a side or veggie main and also great with some cooked sweet Italian sausage or chicken tossed in or on the side. It really satisfied my craving for something "Italian" while still helping me keep it low carb. Sprinkle generously with "good" Pecorino Romano cheese. Wonderful base recipe.  Looking forward to adapting this using some sauces. Soo good.....so try It !

boy was this goooood! I added squash and zucchini to the mix and the flavor and seasoning was yummy. I added salt and pepper to the tomatoes and when I was cooking the yellow squash and zucchini and with the feta, it just blended. Great vegetarian meal. Husband enjoyed it too.  Oh and I was lucky to use what few local farm grown tomatoes are left.  I'm sure that made it good too.

Entire family loved it!

I cooked the small squash in the microwave by halving it lengthwise, scooping out the seeds, putting in some chicken stock, replacing the "lid" of the squash to close, and then cooked in the microwave for 10 min. Came out perfect!

Then I followed the recipe except added salt, pepper, more garlic, mushrooms, and hot dogs. I did not cook the tomatoes (kids don't like them cooked).

This was my first time making spaghetti squash and it turned out great! This was vey easy to make, and even better as leftovers the next day. I thought the basil was just a little strong, but I tend to like bland food. I will definitely make this again!

Amazing!  LOVED it! Had never heard of spaghetti squash until my pal Barbie M turned me on to it. Today I made it for my Andy. Amazing! Wonderful.

We really like spaghetti squash and this is a great recipe.  I only did some minor adjustments.  We don't like olives, so omitted those.  I added zucchini and bell peppers.  To make it a main dish I also added chicken and it was wonderful!  People just need to be aware that spaghetti squash doesn't ever turn out exactly like spaghetti noodles because they stay "crunchy" but they are so good for you and delicious to boot :)

Out of basil so we substituted 6 medium swiss chard leaves, added 2 bite sized sliced sweet red peppers, 1 cup snow peas, 1 cup chopped mushrooms and 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper.

Very Good Dish.  It was relatively simple to make.  I cooked my squash for about 50 minutes, it came out super easy.    I personally do not like Black Olives, so I kept picking them out, but luckily I didn't use many.  I also used Olive Tomatoes in halves.  Even though this dish was very filling, I think next time, I'll add shrimp to it!

This was very good.  My hubby didn't like the way it looked at first, then he tasted it...he also got seconds :D  I only gave it four stars because my 11 year old son wasn't a fan.

This is a great option if you're trying to cook healthier, or want to use your Weight Watcher points for something other than pasta. I would definitely bake the squash at a higher temperature next time around. I did add water in a 10x13 while baking. Makes cleaning up a lot easier. And for my own taste I like to add extra tomatoes. Would be fantastic with tomatoes from the garden! I will definitely be making this again.

It is my first time cooking spaghetti squash and it turned out fine - but I personally don't really like it with tomatoes, maybe something with cream would work better. I use half an onion but still it is too much.

Love, love, love this!!! I do omit the black olives, as I just cannot get myself to like them in anything! I also have not been able to convince myself that spaghetti squash would be a nice substitute for noodles (taste or texture wise), but I do not really care for pasta, so that may be it. I love it just for what it is! A nice healthy meal or side dish that satisfies without feeling stuffed after!
Thank you for submitting this! I make it all the time and have shared it with many friends who have enjoyed it for something different.

Very easy, with wonderful flavors.  My modifications:  1) used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, 2) used dried basil, marjoram, and thyme, 3) added lots more olives, 4) added capers, and 5) did not add feta to the large batch, but allowed individuals to add feta as they wished to their servings.

Fantastic,   healthy and simple. I prepared the squash as I normally do by baking it in the oven at 350 for 30 mins or so, halved in some water in a roasting dish.

Beyond fantastic!  The entire family loved it.  The only difference between the original recipe and what I made was subbing Kalamata olives for black olives.

We love this recipe!! We tried it out for the first time about a month ago. We had never eaten spaghetti squash before and this has turned into one of our favorite go to recipes, we make it about once a week sine we first tried it. We do however, add shiitake mushrooms which are AMAZING and we don't make it with olives. But other than that everything is pretty much the same as this recipe. LOVE IT!!!

Huge hit with my friends.  Excellent and easy.  Since I was making 2 squash, I cooked one as per the directions in this recipe and the other I cooked in the oven, whole, with holes poked in it till a fork could pierce it easily.  Both methods worked very well.  Hard to cut the squash in half prior to cooking.  I was generous with the fresh basil and rosemary.  Used fat free feta.  Delicious!!  Thanks James, this is a keeper.

This was a yummy, quick and easy recipe, but I do agree the squash did take almost 30 minutes to bake.  I used parsley instead of basil (just didn't have basil in the house) Italian hubby loved it too!!!

This is a great recipe, but you must add a few more ingredients to make the bland squash more piquant. First, cooking the squash - split it length wise, scoop out the seeds, drizzle with EVOO, add salt and pepper and place face down on either glass or aluminum foil. Cook for at LEAST 1Hr, maybe more at 400F. Turn over and cook for another 15m. Let it rest while making the sauce. 
Make a basic fresh Italian sauce, saute as much onion (leeks are better!) and garlic as much as possible. Add some sliced Italian sausage (veggie type is OK - we are looking for flavor here), add the tomatoes (canned w/green chiles is good), basil, whatever else you like, let simmer, season to taste. Then dump into the bowel with the squash and feta. 
You will not be disappointed!!

This was a great way to prepare spaghetti squash and turned out to be an excellent dish served alongside grilled salmon.  I baked my squash in the oven for about 50 minutes and then left it to cool while I prepared the rest.  Great thing is that you can really adapt this recipe to add/use up whatever veggies you want or have in your fridge!  I sauteed some asparagus and mushrooms along with the tomatoes, garlic and onions.  Didn't have any basil, so just left it out and served each plate with some feta and olives.  Delicious!

This is a great basic recipe that I changed a little.  First, I put the whole squash in the microwave (punched a few holes in it) for a few minutes until I was able to slice it down the middle.  Then I put about a cup of water in a glass baking dish and put the squash half sides down and baked for about an hour.  While thats cooling, I sauted a whole chopped red onion, about 2 cloves garlic, some fresh zuchinni, fresh chopped asparagus, and a can of fire roasted tomatoes (with the juice).  Once the veggies are mostly cooked, I put a lid on it so that the juices dont evaporate.  Then I scoop the spaghetti out and toss in with the veggie mixture so that its all coated together.  Then I put into bowls and add a bit of the feta and basil and toss!

Wow!  Yum!  Big hit at our house, and we'll be making this over and over.  
Cooked split squash in 1 1/2 cups water for 60 minutes until tender, then adapted recipe to meet our family needs/tastes in this way:

sauteed garlic and red pepper til soft in olive oil.
Then added to my saute mix: spinach, chopped basil, chopped calamata olives. Removed sauteed veges from pan, and sauteed squash pulp in butter. Mixed squash with veges and shredded parmesan cheese.  Added salt and pepper.

This was really good - I reduced the amount of tomatoes and added red bell pepper.  I also used gorgonzola crumbles instead of feta, since I'm not a huge fan.  Great recipe!

Wow!!!  Now I wouldn't replace my normal spaghetti or angel hair pasta just yet - but this was a very tasty alternative.  Glad I held off on adding the sauce I prepared because it is quite watery, but serving the sauce on the side worked well.

Not enough flavour for me. I prefer to bake my squash face-up, drizzled with a bit of olive oil and sprinkled with dried basil and oregano. Then use that as the base for squash recipes.

I just made this for lunch and it was AMAZING. But to make it a little more like a main dish I tweaked it quite a bit.


-Cut spaghetti squash in half and baked for 45 min at 350 degrees
-Saute asparagus, red onion, red bell pepper in pan with olive oil
-Add mushrooms, jalapeno and fresh basil
-In another pan saute tofu, eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash with a little olive oil. Add 1 tablespoon Bragg's liquid aminos
-In asparagus pan add quartered cherry tomatoes, kalamata olives and fresh spinach. Add a little chicken broth to steam the spinach.
-Pour into eggplant pan when it's browned
-Sprinkle feta and fold in gently
-Add in spaghetti squash and serve warm

It's a must try! ENJOY

Next time I make this I am planning on adding white wine to the sautee mix and maybe lemon juice and butter. I would like it to be a little more saucy, or moist to pour over the squash. But it was good and I felt great about eating this meal. I did add Zuch. and Asp. to this.

What a great recipe!  I've always wanted to try spaghetti squash and this was a terrific recipe to use.  Being new to this recipe, be sure the squash is cooked well so it is tender when you scoop it out.  I used a big squash and should've left it in the oven for another 5-8 minutes.  I accidentally left the olives out and glad it did.  If you really like olives and greek salad, then put them in.  I feel they overpower the dish.  Lastly, I added one red pepper.  Next time, I'll add other ingredients like zucchini.  What a great & flexible recipe.

This is really great, easy and delicious. I altered it a little I deleted the garlic because my husband can't eat it, bothers his IBS. I substituted sweet red peppers for the garlic and used low fat feta. Absolutely fantastic my husband loved it!

I had never tried spaghetti squash before.  I followed this recipe exactly but my squash came out crunchy.  A coworker told me I need to cook it in a pyrex with a little water next time and it will get soft. Even though the texture was off, the flavor was delish!  I will definately try this one again.

This was so good, I may never revert back to pasta!  I added extra veggies to the onion mixture - summer squash, carrots, asparagus, mushrooms, & spinach.  I also served it with feta on the side so I would use less.

Wow! Surprisingly good!  I added one 7 oz can of basil tomato sauce.  I can't stress this enough: FRESH BASIL ONLY, and add liberally.  Will make again for sure!

My squash took nearly 40 minutes to cook.  I should have known this recipe would scream of basil from the 2tbsp it calls for.  The basil completely overwhelmed the dish--I couldn't taste the feta or anything else.  If I make it again, I would omit the basil completely and up the garlic.  Kids still don't like squash!

This was a very good dish.  I made it as the only dish for our dinner and while we were eating it we both felt that it should be a side to fish or chicken.  About an hour later, we were both commenting how it was actually the perfect meal.  We were both full and completely satisfied.  YUM!

This was so-so for me. My husband says I've been on a health kick lately. Wether due to my "health kick" or not, I've had a hankering for spaghetti squash lately. I've heard a lot of positive buzz about this vegetable, and ever since, have been intrigued to give it a try. I guess I'm just a pasta fan because this didn't suit my palate at all. Although spaghetti squash closely resembles pasta in appearance, its texture is VERY different (which is the very thing I can't get past...). Spaghetti isn't crunchy, but my squash was! Perhaps I didn't cook mine long enough, I don't know. After researching on the good 'ol Internet, I found that there are 2 ways to cook spaghetti squash - whole (pricked all over to release steam as it cooks) or cut in half in a water bath. I did the latter but would NEVER do that again! Raw squash is IMPOSSIBLE to cut (lesson learned!). It seems this would be better served cold, perhaps as a salad or side dish. To my surprise, my husband LOVED this and asked that I make it again (sorry hon, not happening). I pretty much followed James' directions to the letter except for one substitution. Neither my hubs or I like olives, so I omitted them alltogether. Served with garlic foccacia bread (my creation!) and a nice white wine, this was a healthy, yet interestingly enough, filling meal. Thanks for sharing your recipe, James. Although I wouldn't snub my nose if served this again, I don't think it will be me making it. :-)

I really liked this recipe. It was easy and delicious! I did add kalamata olives versus black, sun dried tomatoes and fresh, and a bit of extra seasoning, paprika and dill. So versatile!

We made this for Thanksgiving, and my husband (who does not like squash) loved it.  I am going to make it for a cover dish party tonight.  I like the cooking sequence because while the squash is cooling, you saute the veggies, and when they are done, the squash is cool enough to string and put together.

Yum!!!! This was SOOOO GOOD! I'm a pasta freak, and I'm trying to watch my weight and carbs, so I had to have something similar to spaghetti, but much healthier. This was perfect. I've had spaghetti squash before, but never made my own. It's incredibly easy! And, it makes a lot! (At least mine did, my squash was huge). I threw a bit of red pepper powder in mine for an added kick, and it was perfect. I had to use dried basil, as I hardly ever buy fresh. I'll be making this again and again. Thank you, James!!

Simply amazing. I've never had spaghetti squash, but have heard good things about it and wanted to try it out. I saw this recipe that looked really yummy and it was! This is such an amazing vegetable and I am so excited to try it out with other sauces. The only change I made in this recipe was to use mushrooms in place of the olives. I also added salt and pepper. I definitely recommend this as a pasta substitute.

Maybe just add an extra dash of salt, but otherwise so good! You will need to cook the squash for more than 30 min, though.

I liked it.  My 3 kids (7, 3, 1) liked it okay.  My husband hated it, but he hates squash.  I had never cooked spaghetti squash before and the 30 minutes wasn't enough (the "noodles" were crunchy) but then I think I over cooked it because they weren't "defined" when I finished.

Wow!  Wonderful flavor and texture.  I used the bakeware with water variant.  Kept the fresh basil, garlic, onions, olives, feta, etc.  Used a can of Muir Glen Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes.  Servings are a bit much for a single guy, so I may try half or quarter portions of squash and scale down accordingly.

I wasn't expecting much from this, but it was actually quite tasty. You can be liberal with the ingredient amounts, depending on how big your squash is and your taste preferences. I subbed a large can of tomatoes for the fresh tomatoes--I added the juice in the can and let it simmer a while. Next time (if using canned) I think I will drain the tomatoes before adding.

Fantastic! This is a great Greek flavored side dish. This would make a complete meal with just a small fresh mixed green salad. I will be making this again very soon

I tried spagetti squash for the first time and loved it!  I needed to cook a bit longer as well...45 minutes.  But this recipe was great!!  Thank you.

So yum!  We added bacon and used oregano because the store was out of basil, but it was still so delish!

I made a sauce with fresh tomatoes, onion, garlic, asst peppers including a few tablespoons of minced hot peppers, fresh sliced mushrooms, oregano, 1 tsp sugar, 1 Tbs parsley. I simmered for about 1 1/2 hours. I put a generous portion of this mixture over the spaghetti squash and I was absolutely delighted with the end results.

I loved it, my husband liked it, and my children didn't express an opinion one way or the other. I will definitely make this one again, but I think I'll add a tiny bit of brown sugar and salt.

I'm so-o glad I found this recipe. I've been indifferent to spaghetti squash over the years but am crazy over it now. Am about to make it again for the 2nd time in a month.  I made no changes but really should double it for more left overs.

Very good!  Used olive oil instead of veg. oil and added extra Feta cheese.  A nice savory way to make squash.  Family friendly and good for you too!  Will make again.

Absolutely delicious! Made it tonight minus the olives, and I could eat it forever! Better than pasta, refreshing and juicy....I could substitute spaghetti squash for pasta with any pasta dish! Also, this is a very easy filling dish!

This is an awesome recipe.  We loved it. I couldn't get enough of it.  What a wonderful way to use my spagetti squash from my garden and my fresh Basil. Very easy to make. Very colorful and presents well.

FANTASTIC recipe! I'd never tried spaghetti squash before, but had always been curious about it! Used someone elses suggestion with putting water in the dish while it's baking and it came out perfect! Added the tomatos too early, but it didn't change the taste! And, though I don't like olives, I barely noticed them! This will definitely be a regular meal and I look forward to playing with more recipes!

super easy and sooo good!   I used onion, green pepper, a can of diced tomatoes, green olives, and fetta - delicious!!  I also cooked the spaghetti squash in the microwave since I couldn't cut it open.

I loved this recipe. I ended up cooking the squash in the microwave for 10 minutes after poking plenty of holes in it to save time. Meanwhile, I sauteed the onions with thyme and basil and added finely sliced approximately 1/4 of a small zuchini and eggplant to the mix with tomatoes. Delicious!!!

I followed the directions exactly but not thrilled with the taste.  I think the spaghetti squash might be better with different ingredients.

Loved this!!! We've never tried spaghetti squash before and this was excellent!! The only thing I did differently was add more garlic and substitute a couple of big handfuls of spinach for the basil. (We're just not basil people) This is definetly going to be a regular meal around our house!!! kudos!!!

My husband would never eat any kind of squash, but he loved this recipe. I think it has something to do with the sqash being in the strands that makes it a whole different texture. Thanks!

I really enjoyed this.  I used a large squash and it was a little too much -- definitely use a medium size. Also, the cooking time for the squash should be longer or at least I like mine a little softer -- 45 minutes would be enough.

This was my first time cooking with spaghetti squash and I was pleasantly surprised! I used a 1 pound (small) squash and cut it in half as directed. I ended up baking it face-down for 45 mins based on other reviews, and still think it could have cooked for another 10 minutes. I caramelized the onion in the saucepan for extra flavour and used 2 large cloves of garlic. As tomatoes are very expensive right now, I used a 398mL can of diced tomatoes and the flavour was gorgeous. I also used dried basil and left out the feta and olives as I didn't have any on hand. Both myself and my boyfriend (meat eater) loved it! I know this is a lot of changes, but I can imagine how much more flavour the feta and olives would add, and will definitely add them in the future! Thank you.

Cook the spaghetti squash in the microwave for a faster prep time.  Cut in half and remove seeds.   Place cut side down and microwave for 8-10 minutes.
Since all squash vary in weight, adjust time, this works for 3#

A very healthy alternative, but with the versatility, of pasta.  I baked my squash with a splash of olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning.  I place water in the baking dish as noted by another reviewer; the end results were scrumptious.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yum, yum, yum!!!  This was such a nice change of pace for a standard veggie in our home.  I love the contrast of flavors between the sweetness of the squash, the sharpness of the feta, and the textures of the olives and tomatos!!  I made it just as written but would experiment with spinach, mushrooms, and even broccoli!!  

Give it a chance!!!  It is very yummy!!!!

I have never cooked spaghetti squash before, so this was a great starting point for me. I added spinach, real bacon bits and 2 cans of boneless/skinless wild salmon. Omitted the olives since my little one doesn't like them. Great dinner tonight and my daughter loved it, didn't even know she wasn't eating pasta noodles!! This will be a regular in our house as my husband prefers to not eat carb heavy meals and this was a nice alternative.

This was very good!  It could be a side dish or a main dish.  I made mine as a side dish.  I followed the advice of others and used Kalamata olives, so I don't really know what it would have tasted like with the black olives.  I'll have to try those sometime.  I also used canned Italian style diced tomatoes and dried basil and it tasted fine.  It has a "different" flavor which may not be for everyone, but we liked it.  My squash was large so it made a lot!

Loved this! This was the first time I ever made spaghetti squash...I liked having a spaghetti substitute. 

I used canned diced tomatoes and kalamata olives because that was what I had on hand. Also I used oregano...so it turned into more of an Italian dish. I like plan to use the tomato/olive mixture on chicken in the future!

Very good, fresh tasting dish that would work well as either a main dish OR side.  The basil gives this such a wonderful touch!  A great springboard for other ideas too.  YUM!  To cook the squash, I place it in a dish with a bit of water and microwave it rather than using the oven.

Fantastic! So very flavorful. We used a can of Italian (seasoned) tomatoes in place of the chopped tomatoes. Give yourself extra time for the squash to bake - ours took 45 minutes (it was large).  He was skeptical....but loved it too!

I was quite surprised by how delicious this was, especially considering how simple the ingredients are.  If you like Italian pasta dishes, you will like this.  Except this is much healthier!  I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fres, an 8 oz. can of olives, and dried basil instead of fresh and it still turned out very good.  The olives make a big difference and add lots of flavor.  A very healthy, delicious, easy to cook meal.  The only reason it gets 4 stars is because I feel like "fancy" delicious meals are more deserving of 5 stars.  Definitely give it a go!  Lots of leftovers.

I don't like any kind of olive except for green olives with pimento.  So when I first made this dish I just skipped the olives all together.  It was ok but not great.  I decided to try and use green olives with pimentos because those are the only ones I like.  It made such a difference.   I also grated a little parmasean cheese on top and that took it from ok to really good.  I will make this again using green olives and a little parmasean cheese so good for such a healthy dish.  Thanks for sharing.

Honestly I am not sure how I feel about this recipe. I, like another reviewer, was a bit turned off by the crunchy texture of the squash.  I cooked it an extra 15 minutes and it was still crunchy.  I've never had sp. squash before so maybe it's normal?  Due to the reviews, though, I think not.  Anyways, I couldn't decide whether I liked this or not, but I found myself going back for "test" bites after dinner, although a big part of that was because I love feta cheese!  I want to try it again, because it's very healthy, but I will try the microwave method of cooking the squash next time.  Other than that, I added finely chopped broccoli and cauliflower to the onion saute, which admittedly did not fit the Mediterranean flair of this dish, but it was very good and didn't overpower the dish in the least. Omitted olives because I don't like them.  Overall, I am curious enough about this dish that I am definitely going to try it again.  The only other thing is that this just screamed "cold salad" at me, not "warm dinner." But I stuck a bite in the freezer for a few minutes and it was ok, but also good warm, so that's how we ate it (warm). Hmmm, I am definitely going to play around with sp. squash a bit more. Update: Microwave cooking the squash changed nothing, still crunchy.  Didn't like it as well the second time around, but added an egg, formed patties, dunked them in cornmeal/breadcrumbs, and pan-fried.  This was delicious.  Kids ate with ketchup, I ate plain.

AMAZING! Not a fan of squash and this was fantastic! Cooked squash in microwave and came out faster and easier. Used dried basil, halved grape tomatos and double the garlic.  Delicious and so customizable. Next time, I will try an alfredo version.

My first spaghetti squash dish, and it was yummy.  Left out the olives and added chopped baby bella mushrooms.  Didn't have any tomatoes so threw in a can of diced tomatoes (no sugar, no added salt).  Really good.  We will definitely put this in our dinner line up from now on!  Thanks James.

I was looking for a tasty Spaghetti Squash recipe and found it here in this Greek style Spaghetti Squash. I did make a few modifications.... 1. I used Kalamata Olives instead of Black Olives. 2. The recipe didn't specify how large an onion, and mine was large, so I only used half which was plenty for my tastes. 3. I also replaced chopped tomatoes with halved Cherry Tomatoes. 3. And finally, I added 2 cups of fresh baby spinach leaves at the same time as the tomatoes. I followed the cooking directions for the squash and the timing was pretty accurate. It was about 35-38 minutes when the knife would just cut in smoothly. I prefer veggies and pasta al dente so I was careful not to let it get to soft. Nutritious and tasty!

This was a great recipe for spaghetti squash. I ended up cooking the squash for 45 minutes, and it cameout perfect! Just a tiny crunch. I also added left over ground turkey and all natural pork sausage and it definitly added alot. I will definitly make this again!!

Left out the olives because I didn't have any.  Added zucchini and fresh spinach with the tomatoes.  So good!!  My husband said he liked it more than actual pasta.  I liked that the squash had a bit of crunch to it.  And the feta makes the dish complete!  Super healthy and super yummy….we will be making this again and again.  Thanks!!

This is a great and easy way to make spaghetti squash. However, I'll be making some adjustments next time around. I will either use a larger squash or cut down on the amount of onion as there seemed to be almost as much onion as squash when I made this. I'd probably add some extra garlic and spices to make it more flavourful. I would also add some red bell pepper and zucchini as others have suggested to make it a more substantial meal (this would make a great lunch!) I find the recipe as is to be more of a side dish, but it's still very yummy!

Loved it! We will definitely be making spaghetti squash at our house more often! The crunchy texture and subtle flavor is so much better than pasta. Made as-is plus 1/2 a zucchini and 1/4 c. each diced bell pepper & onion.

very good. I added some cucumber for some crunch.  It was room temp when we ate it, and it was delish. Great for a hot night, nice refreshing dish. I microwaved the squash, poked holes in it and cooked for 12 minutes. will make again.

I tweaked it a bit to make my life easier; bought fresh bruschetta and kalamata olives from my grocery store's olive bar. Baked the squash, put the bruschetta-olive mix on top and crumbled the feta cheese. It was delicious. Super quick!

A spaghetti squash first timer here!  This recipe was made according to the directions, but water was added to the baking pan, as suggested by many of the reviewers.  Loved the combination of the feta, tomatoes and olives, and the fresh basil is a must in my opinion.  This dish was served as a main course, but will treat as a side dish next time.  Grilled chicken breasts would be a great accompaniment.

Easy, tasty and healthy! My husband and I loved this dish. My 9yr old wasn't overly thrilled about it, but he's not a fan of squash. This recipe will stay in my family so we can enjoy this regularly. I added more garlic (2 lg cloves) as we love it. Thanks for sharing this fab recipe!!!

I had never tried spaghetti squash before this, but it definitely wont be the last! This recipe was pretty good, I would change a few things though. It needed more salt, so instead of just adding more salt Im going to try adding artichoke hearts. I think I'll also add a portobello mushroom or two to make it a little more substantial.

Solid flavors and, overall, very satisfying for a vegetarian dish (I am not a vegetarian).   Be sure to bake the squash long enough for the "noodles" to be tender. Mine took an extra 15 min or so past the recommended time.    Also, I needed to add some sea salt and garlic powder at the end for a little extra seasoning :)

Yum! Once I got the squash opened (very HARD!) this was delicious. I made the following small changes: * baked squash side up w/ olive oil, salt, pepper * only used 1/2 the squash * used olive oil for onions, garlic, tomato  Will definitely make again!

Awesome recipe! I pierced squash with a knife to vent steam and microwaved whole for 20 minutes. I skipped olives (preference)and added 2 cups of sliced mushrooms to make it more "meaty" when sauteeing the onions.  I also added a splash or two of Marsala wine. We ate this as a main vegetarian dish that even my picky 10 year old enjoyed.

Wow!  This is great!  I was hoping this recipe was as good as everyone was saying and it's true.   I even used canned diced tomatoes and dried basil..and it was still wonderful! I ate way too much of it.   Now, I'm anxous to make this again w/ fresh tomatoes and basil.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I grew spaghetti squash this year so I"ll be able to make this a lot. And it's low calorie.  It doensn't get much better than this.

This was my firt time making spaghetti squash, and I couldn't believe how easy it was!  I found the squash very hard to cut, as other squashes are, so I ended up using an electric knife, and it was super easy and fast.  I cooked my squash for 45 minutes, and it came out great!  I loved the flavor if this dish with the basil (I used dried) and onions, and I did add a little sprinkle of garlic salt for more flavor.  My 3 kids (9,6, and 2) just gobbled this up and even asked for seconds!!!  They actually ate one entire half!  They thought it was so cool they were eating a spagehtti plant!  Little did they know it was a sqaush because they really don't like the usual sqaushes.  My 9 year old said it was awesome, and she really hates her veges!  Another plus is that you don't have to worry about putting a nice huge portion size on your plate because it is so healthy, and yes, you actually do get full.  We will be making this one again!

Wonderful recipe! I sauted the veg's and added a yellow bell pepper to that and used olive oil. I left out the cheese, really didn't need it. Very flavorful. This is most definetly a keeper.

There is a very similar recipe using angel hair pasta on this site.  I feel like feta is best used in small doses.  I made the squash in this recipe but had to almost double the cooking time.

I am not much of a squash person, but I have been trying to find tasty recipes that will help me learn to like them.  I have made this recipe several times now and I really enjoy it.  I follow the recipe as written except for adding a couple extra cloves of garlic because I love garlic, and I use a can of petite diced tomatoes (slightly drained) because that seems easier than chopping my own tomatoes.  GREAT RECIPE!

I had never tried spaghetti squash either but when I found out I needed to avoid wheat, I thought I'd like to try this. I also was surprised at the 'crunch' of the 'noodles' but still loved the overall dish. I did substitute alot but found this wonderful and very versatile. I used EVOO, sweet onion, lots of garlic, green olives and canned tomatoes (that's all I had), fresh parmesan cheese and the fresh basil. Wow! I went back for seconds which I rarely do, but no guilt here! A great dish and will definitely make again this summer when tomatoes are ripe off the vine!

Good! We made this last night. Roasted the squash at 365, in an inch of water, for about 35 min. Tossed with tomatoes, feta, capers, onions/garlic and lots of fresh pepper.

At first I thought this was spaghetti squash with actual spaghetti, so I almost didn't make it. So glad I did! Really tasty, I love the texture of the squash too. Leeetle bit expensive on my student budget, but so worth it.

My whole family loved this! I only had green peppers in the house, but it turned out delish.  My kids can't stand squash, but they all said how good it was.  I heard, "Thanks Mom"", more than once from each child!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow, this is great.  I used dried basil which was fine but fresh would have been better. Also used a can of diced tomatoes w/green chiles which was very good if you like spicy.  Baked squash for 45 minutes with a little water in the dish as recommended by another poster.  Still a little crunchy, but not much.  I personally liked the slight crunch.  I will try the microwave version next time to compare the consistency of the squash.

Fantastic! I used whole, peeled, canned tomatoes (halved, minus the extra juice in the can)- and let everything (except the feta) simmer for about 20 minutes on the stove (the squash did not want to cook!). I also added a few glugs of white wine and a touch of cooking cream to the sauce. Then tossed everything together just before serving. It was amazing. We were two and managed to polish off the whole batch!

I've never been much of a squash fan, but I really, really like this!  I used what I had in the house: sun dried tomatoes, feta, an entire small can of sliced black olives, a dash of olive oil, and fresh basil.  I forgot to saute any onion or garlic.  Delicious!  Full of veggies and healthy oils!  This will be a regular at our house!

Ew. I'm sorry, but this was a waste of spaghetti squash. Vegetarian writing here and I won't try this one again. The sweet squash paired with Greek and Italian flavors was just not good at all. Good luck with this one, though!

Sprinkled with s & p, cholula hot sauce & Parm cheese.  Delish!

not bad at all.  i don't think the squash i picked out was the best so i will try this again but we thought it was a great new veggie to add into our diets. (I learned from this experience that the bright yellow large spaghetti squash are suppose to be the most flavorful)

This was awesome. My house gets super hot in the summer with the oven on, but you can cook the squash in the microwave. I cut and seed it, slice it in half and put it in about a half inch of water, cut side down for 20 minutes on high. Then I added all my favorite veggies.

I've gotten a lot of excellent recipes off of this web site.  But, this one?  It's in the top one or two.  I've never even tried to cook spaghetti squash before!  Absolutely wonderful.  Great flavors.  Filling but light at the same time.  I'm absolutely thrilled with this.  Thank you!!  PS I had a HUGE squash... it took an extra :15 in the oven.

Excellent! I only made two minor changes: omitted the onions (preference) and used olive oil instead of the vegetable oil. This is a fantastic way to serve spaghetti squash. We loved it, thank you! :)

My husband and I are low carbers, and this dish wows us.  It's delicious, satisfying, low carb and relatively low fat.  It's also a rarity in that it is a dish fit for company that is quick and easy to make.  I follow the recipe except I use drained canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh and Mexican Cotija cheese instead of Feta.  (Cotija cheese is quite similar to Feta, but a bit saltier and with a more assertive flavor.)  I also nuke my spaghetti squash for 9 minutes instead of baking it.

Delicious!  I added yellow pepper and mushrooms and used kalamata olives.  The squash needed more than 30 minutes but it was a larger squash.

This recipe is delicious!  I did have to bake the squash about 20 minutes longer than the recipe says to get it to a texture I enjoy more.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This dish was delicious! I'm not a huge squash fan but with spaghetti squash it absorbs the flavor from the sauce its mixed with. My husband and I both loved it and the mixture of onions, garlic, basil and tomato would make a great glaze for many different meats or chicken. Yum!

Using up the veggies we picked up from the CSA this week, I was cooking up a storm yesterday.  As a result, we didn't get to eat very much of any one thing.  

Pulling the leftover Spaghetti Squash from this recipe out of the fridge today I wasn't too sure how it might reheat.  Wow was I ever in for a treat!!

This recipe reheats so well that I have to say that it actually tastes better the next day.  The flavors seemed to have blended a bit more and mellowed a bit.  The feta added a nice creamy texture this way, too.  Even the squash itself was nicer, having absorbed some of the moisture from the rest.  

For those who are looking for a recipe to cook ahead of time and pop in the fridge for a meal later in the week (next day's lunch), this is the one for you!  Microwaving is perfect for this leftover meal.

This was my first time making this type of squash and for the most part it was delicious.  However, the squash itself is pretty bland so I recommend adding your own zest of your favorite flavors!  The best part about this dish is that it is very filling and healthy.  I will continue to experiment with the different ingredients to compliment this fun noodle replacement.

This was very easy to make (beside halving the squash for cooking!) and delicious!  I served it with bread, but next time I think I will use it as a side.  Wasn't really enough for a meal...

Wow!! Who would've thought this would be so good? My 13 year old even loved it. I went with half parmesan and half feta cheeses. I used cherry tomatoes which I think gave it just a hint of sweetness...loved it!

10 minutes into dinner we were still talking about how crazy good this recipe is. We decided it was "stupifyingly good". It's so simple but the flavors blend perfectly and the textures make you go back for thirds. We added asparagus and chopped kale--highly recommended. SOOO GOOOD!

this recipe is FANtastic!!!!!!

so easy to make, it's basically a combination of my favorite foods all in one bowl!

the only thing i did differently was that i punctured & baked the squash whole on 350* for 1 hr before cutting.  personally i -always- end up fighting with the raw squash, and it comes out tender and delicious this way as well!

thank you so much for sharing this great recipe- my boyfriend isn't very fond of the ingredients which means more for me!  i'l actually eating it right now, i don't think i can be stopped...  =]

This is very different. I am not sure what I was expecting, but it was good, and my husband liked it which really surprised me. I added fresh spinach and a red pepper and some pork sausage to make it a one-dish meal, and it was a hit. Thanks!

This is delicious! I made this for supper and my husband hesitated when asking for seconds, thinking there was a ton of butter in it, but no! The squash has such a rich flavour, and I love how healthy this recipe is!  The olives definitely make the dish, both in taste and appearance. I added spinach, and it was great - added a lot of color (and more healthiness!). If you're thinking about trying squash - use this recipe! As a bonus, you can roast up the seeds for a healthy snack!

Delicious!

My boyfriend loved it. The only thing that I would add would be some red pepper flakes for a little kick. 

Also. I baked my squash for 45 minutes instead of the recommended 30.

Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this recipe and make it all the time. Its so easy and I allways have everything I need in the fridge.  I do make a few changes though, usually I use goat cheese instead of feta and olive oil instead of veggie. I also bake the squash halves until the rind browns a little, it gives the squash an interesting nutty flavor.

Wow, that was good! I have never had spaghetti squash before, and a friend recently recommended it. It was tasty plain, but it was awesome with this recipe. 
It was like pasta in disguise, but much better since it felt lighter and tastier. 

The things I did differently from the original recipe are: I used canola spray and a 1/2 tbs butter, and a splash of water when it looked like the onions/garlic needed some moisture, instead of oil. 
I omitted the olives. 
I used a 14.5 oz can of HUNTS brand diced tomatoes w/ a garlic/basil. (Although I usually would opt for fresh veggies..the store I went to was out of "ripe" tomatoes). 

I probably will put in more tomatoes next time. 

Yum!

This was great, and I love the fact that you can clean out the fridge adding a bit of whatever you have odds and ends of left over. Squash was a little raw near the edges, so I think I'll cook a bit longer next time.

Wow!!!  This was really good.  My first experience cooking or eating spaghetti squash.  What a cool vegetable!  It's amazing how it comes out just like angel hair pasta!!  I have always subscribed to the theory that all is better with feta and this is no exception!!  I added some grilled chicken strips per others advice as well as a couple handfuls of fresh sugar snap peas. (Added lots of color and a yummy crunch!) I'm just really excited about learning about this neat-o vegetable!

OMG!i made a few adjustments to fit my cupboards. no black olives or tomatoes or feta cheese. green peppers, red peppers, onions, and garlic. cooked the spag squash in the microwave until WELL DONE. cooked the chicken on the foreman ahead of time and cut it into bite size pieces. sauted the diced peppers, onions, and pressed garlic in butter in a wok. sprinkled about 2 or 3 tablespoons of parmesan cheese. added the pulled squash and tossed around. added the chicken and tossed around until warm. top with salt and fresh ground pepper. AWESOME and completely SCD legal!

This was great!  I added sea salt and ground pepper, upped the feta to 1 cup, added a little more garlic, because we love garlic, and deleted the olives since we are not olive fans, but found this recipe to be wonderful!
Addendum: Oh my, my...this tastes better the next day, cold!  It still tastes great warmed up....but cold it is amazing!

The first time I made this I followed the directions and I would have given it 2 stars, but I thought it had some potential, especially since squash is so cheap, and so much healthier than pasta.  I made this one again tonight and now it is a 5+++ star recipe.  I added four cloves of garlic after sautéing the onions.  I also added about a half a cup of fresh Kalamata olives, a jar of artichoke hearts, fresh basil, parsley and oregano, and some grated parmesan with the feta, and chopped up baby tomatoes.  So much better!!!!  Essentially double the olives and vegetables listed, and add some fresh herbs and this will be a dish you will make again!  Thanks for the recipe

I love spaghetti squash and this recipe puts a tasty spin on it.  I used red and green bell peppers, kalamata olives, dropped the basil, and had it cold as a salad.  I like to undercook the squash so it's a little crunchy, since so many of the winter vegetables are softer.  This makes a great lunch alternative.

DH gives this dish a 5+ rating!!!  He just kept "hmmm hmmm hmmm" while he ate it.  I used the advice of another reviewer and poked holes in the squash and oven roasted it until soft.  Soooo much easier than trying to fight with the super hard "shell".  Added artichokes and cracked red peppers, as DH likes a little more "bite".  DH liked it better without any cheese.  But, like another reviewer said, this is VERY VERSATILE and ADAPTABLE to whatever your tastes are.  I also added a poached chicken breast to the mix to make it a main course.  Thanks for a grrreat recipe.Update as of 11/27...DH warmed up the leftovers and said it was still a 5 star.   Something to be said for that!

I made this tonight (first time making spaghetti squash) and it turned out fantastic.  I didn't really know what to expect but I will definitely make again.  I boiled the squash whole for about 30-35 minutes instead of baking.  It's too tough trying to cut it in half uncooked. I also used red, yellow and green pepper, onion, spinich, mushrooms, and feta, Added salt, pepper and a dried basil. Didn't have any tomatoes, but I didn't feel like I was missing anything, and purposefully left out olives.  It's a very versatile recipe.

This is so good.  I had never had spaghetti squash before trying this recipe but now I'm completely sold on it!  I baked the squash for 45 minutes as suggested by other reviewers and added extra garlic.  So delicious but it doesn't reheat well.

Excelent. I have also made with sm. shell pasta.  I left the feta out and sprinkled parmesean on top.  I added artichoke hearts, and yellow bell pepper and a little more salt.  I also used a chicken breast, shrimp, or a combination of shrimp and fake crab to make this a full meal.  Serve with warm crusty bread.  Sam's has awonderful artisan bread in their freezer section.  Just heat and serve.

I have never had saghetti squash before. theis is DELICIOUS> the squash is a bit crunchy, and has a sweet nutty taste. It goes very well with the salty feta and olives (I used kalamata olives)and freshh tomatoes and basil. I have found a subsitute for the starch in my diet. Actually I RATHER eat this than real pasta YAY!

Sooooo yummy. I used canned diced tomatoes (drained), green olives, and about a tablespoon of dried basil (also olive oil instead of regular). Even better than regular spaghetti. Thank you! I will make this again and again!

ok, this was my first time eating and preparing spaghetti squash, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I LOVED this!!  I already sent this recipe to all of my friends.  My Variations: I added a little marinara sauce and served it on top of meatless chicken, sprinkled stretched mozza and baked it, it was so delicious!!

This is the first time I had prepared spaghetti squash and I must say that it turned out really good! :-)  I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used a can of drained diced tomatoes and fresh grated parmesan cheese instead of the feta.  It's a keeper!  Next time I'll try it with the feta!  Simple, easy and delicious!

This makes a great healthy meal!  I added chicken, zucchini and mushrooms to make it a bit heartier.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  You really wouldn't know that you were eating squash - it's that good.  I even have enough for leftovers!!  Yummy!

This dish is great. But, since my boyfriend and I need some meet, we added chicken to the recipe.  We chopped up chicken breast (can also use turkey) into very small pieces and cooked it with the onion. once the chicken was done with got rid of any liquid at the bottom of the pan and then followed the recipe to a t. It was great.

Very good, simple, and a great side dish.  You can save yourself time by baking the squash ahead of time when you have the oven on for something else, then just microwaving it and sauteing the veggies at the last minute.

This is the best way I've tried so far to prepare spaghetti squash, regardless of what you do with it after it's cooked. Baking is much better than boiling!

This recipe was pretty good.  It was helpful to read the previous reviews for ideas on how to spruce up the spices.  I also cooked the squash for one hour and then as a final touch I drizzled a little margarine on for added taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

A HUGE hit with my family.  I served it with some meatballs and everyone (husband, parents and 3 toddlers) enjoyed it completely.  Some adults chose fresh grated pepper parmesan cheese instead of the feta, but that was the only change.

I made this for my boyfriend and we were both kind of grossed out by the consistency of it... in fact we decided it would make a great fear factor food.  It also had an off smell to it, I wouldn't recomend this recipe to my worst enemy.

Very good, I used low fat feta and I think next time I will use dreid basil, as I found the fresh just a bit too overpowering.  Other than that I really enjoyed the flavour and will probably make it again.

I've never made spaghetti squash before and I was very pleased with this recipe.  I used canned tomatoes, no olives or feta, and added a little mozzarella and dried oregano.  I also microwaved the squash first so that it was easier to cut (although it still took some brute force :) ).

I invented a similar recipe, and encountered this one after the fact. Mine is almost identical, but I used rehydrated sundried tomatoes in place of fresh/canned. That, along with salt-cured French black olives, lended a particularly intense flavor that I liked.

It was yummy.  May need to cook the squash a little longer (I put it in the microwave for about 5 minutes to get it ready with the rest of the meal.)  Next time will try it with a little more garlic!!!!!

Incredible!  This was the first time I have worked with spaghetti squash, but my mom planted some this year and gave me a couple to cook.  I didn't believe that the pulp would really come out in strands, until I cooked the squash to make this recipe.  The flavor was wonderful, and the texture was great - so much healthier than a pasta dish.  I added a small bottle of drained, chopped marinated artichoke hearts, which was really yummy.  I also added salt and pepper to taste, and about 5 cloves of garlic (I love garlic).  Maybe my squash was too big, but I used only 3/4 of the cooked squash, since there was just too much pulp for the rest of the ingredients.  I will definitely make this again!!!

This is a great vegetarian recipe and we look forward to making this for company.  I used klamenta olives rather than black olives and drizzled some of the olive oil into the mixture.  I also used a sheep's milk feta cheese which had a wonderfully mild flavor.  Over all excellent!

Very good!! I absolutely loved this recipe.  I've never made squash before and I found this recipe to be very easy. I didn't have feta cheese so I used Colby & Jack and I skipped on the olives also... very yummy!  Thanks, Michi in Miami

I had a spaghetti squash given to me and I found this recipe to try. I was disappointed with the taste, and I think it was because I found the squash to be bland. I think that this recipe could be applied to pasta as well as squash. I used olives in the recipe, but I didn't like the way they tasted with everything else.

This was really good, but I altered the recipe a little.  I added more fresh basil and garlic, and omitted the olives.  My family loved the interesting flavors.

Nothing special!

I Loved the idea of replacing vegetables where heavy pasta would normally be.  I also spread a hint of olive oil on the squash halves when baking to lock in the moisture.  My husband also loved this dish.  What a pleasant surprise!!

I cooked the squash whole, poking several holes with a serrated knife baked for an hour at 375 like another cook suggested, then used all ingredients as listed but swapped out the oil with olive oil and topped with a bit of pecarino romano ... delish.. will make this again.

Great recipe! I took the added recommendation to bake the squash (cut in half) in a casserole dish in the oven with 1 1/2 cups of water and also poked a couple of holes with a knife and it was ready after 30 minutes.
I added some chopped asparagus and orange bell pepper and used 2 cloves of garlic. Very minor changes, thanks for a good recipe!

I followed the recipe and it came out great. I did substance Greek seasoning for the basil. I will never serve plain spaghetti squash again. This was so delicious.

I've made this several times now and have changed it up quite a bit.  I chop the red onion and a red, orange and yellow pepper and fry those in olive oil.  After a few minutes I add the garlic and a couple tablespoons of basil and a few minutes before I think the peppers and onions are cooked the way I want them I throw in a handful of chopped spinach.  After this is all cooked I stir in the squash with a few scoops of basil pesto and the feta.  
My family isn't big on olives and I don't care for winter tomatoes so this is a nice change.

I love this dish. Such great, varied flavors, that really come together.  I usually have to add a bit of salt at the end, but it's really a unique way to make spaghetti squash. This one is in my summer recipe rotation for sure.

This is omg so good!  I had to substitute a can of diced tomatoes and added cut up spinach, and it was amazing! I poked the squash with a skewer and nuked it in the microwave on high for  5 minutes and it came out perfect.  Way faster & easier than baking in the oven.  Btw, if you do decide to use the oven instead,  put it on 375 for 1 hour instead of what the recipe says.  This would make a great side dish with meat or as a main dish.  I plan on making this again soon!

A-mazing!  I've never like spaghetti squash but decided to try this as part of eating healthier, which means no more pasta binges.  I added chopped red pepper with the veggies, 1/4 cup vodka and 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper with the tomatoes (the alcohol boils off), which gives the sauce a little snap.  I also  doubled the fresh basil and added chopped chicken.  I wanted the strands less crunchy so I baked the assembled dish for 35 minutes at 350, and the texture was perfect.  I could actually live without pasta if I can have this!

My boyfriend and I love this recipe! Make sure to cook the squash thoroughly; undercooking will still shred the squash like spaghetti but it remains a little too crunchy. I don't like feta so I used grated parmesan, and I think I will go with the suggestion of trying kalamata olives next time rather than black, for some added flavor. Make sure to save your seeds to roast as a snack!

We like spaghetti squash but usually make into a lasagna style dish. I wanted something a little lighter and fresher, so I tried this recipe instead. It was a nice alternative and makes a healthy dinner. Next time, I may try some additional seasonings.

Added salt and pepper at the end, and followed one reviewer's suggestion to poke holes in the squash and bake whole to avoid cutting through the hard squash and all went well.  Tasty and attractive dish.

Great recipe, amazingly good!!  I was surprised how the squash really tasted like noodles.  I used 2-3 garlic cloves, left out the olives, used 1 can muer glen fire roasted diced tomatoes (drained, shredded peccorino romano cheese and added some cut up roasted chicken I had leftover. It was a great and my son loved it!!

Never having cooked spaghetti squash before I think the 30 minute bake time is not long enough. I mean, the squash was pretty crunchy. So I can't give a great review because the texture was very strange. I couldn't really even taste the other flavors, either. Just tasted like squash. Which is alright, I like squash, but seemed a waste of expensive ingredients.

I made this exactly as written except that I put the squash face down in a baking pan, added water to the pan, and baked for about an hour.  It was a delicious combination of flavors.

Had to make this with regular spaghetti since I am in Australia and spaghetti squash isn't in season but it tasted amazing nonetheless!! Added Italian herbs and white wine while cooking the onion and garlic until tender. Added a few chilli flakes too. Absolutely delicious.

This was a decent recipe.  I felt it was a bit bland so I added some seasoning.  Overall I liked it.  My hubby didn't want seconds.  I might consider making it again because I like the idea of eating healthy with less calories.

Very good recipe, easy to follow and very tasty the next day. Although I did put a little water in bottom of pan and cooked a bit longer. I hadn't fixed spaghetti squash before but everybody I knew and trusted recommended to do that. Only thing I could add is make sure to wait for it to cool down before scraping. It can be very hot.

This recipe is very very tasty.  Next time I will make more of the onion, garlic tomato part as it could have used a bit more for all the spaghetti squash.  Paired it with toasted garlic bread.  Great dish, I would recommend it to anyone.

Very easy base recipe that's easily tweaked. I used coconut oil instead of veg oil and added some curry and garam masala since I was in the mood for some middle-eastern food. It was absolutely fabulous and I got TONS of compliments. This recipe is a keeper :)

My husband and I love this recipe and have made this dish numerous times since discovering it earlier this year. However, I never cook my squash in the oven - the microwave is the way to go. I cook it in a casserole dish w/ about 1/4 cup of water and covered tightly w/ plastic wrap.  I do one half at a time for approximately 3-4 minutes for smaller squash and 6 for the larger ones. You can easily test it by trying to shred some and put back in if necessary.

The recipe itself is awesome. I ended up adding an extra garlic clove, Mediterranean feta and Greek olives along with the black olives. Some cracked pepper and a dash of Himalayan pink sea salt. 

When the instructions say to scoop the "stringy" stuff out and place into a bowl, after biting into the shell I realized they mean scooping the squash out of the shell. *A note for others cooking it for the first time.

I roasted my squash in a 450* oven for 30 minutes, it was perfect.  I changed out kalamata olives for the black and added a chopped, roasted red bell pepper.  This is an excellent recipe, really very tasty.

I stuck with my spaghetti squash method for baking, but did everything else as is.  Very very good and so different from the usual due to the feta and Greek olives.   I do not microwave my squash.  I think it leaves it too mushy.  Instead I cut it in half lengthwise, scoop out the seeds and then place on a foil lined pan (do not add water), cut side up.  Brush cut edge and inside squash with olive oil and then sprinkle generously with pepper and salt.  Bake until a knife easily goes through the thickest part of the shell all the way through.  A 5.5# squash (weighed before cleaning out the seeds and goop) takes about 50 minutes.  Then I let it sit for about 30 minutes until it's just cool enough to handle.  I use a fork to strip out the insides, using a spoon to get what clings to the shell.  Then continue on with recipe as is.  Note:  If you do this in the microwave with water...or add water to the pan in the oven, the squash will be a lot more watery and the olive oil won't be as effective.

Really unique & healthy alternative to use the spaghetti squash as a substitute for pasta noodles.  I would consider making it again, but switching up the ingredients.  I also fried up the leftovers into patties as suggested by another reviewer.

*Also - most squashes need awhile to cook throughout.  I cut in half an place in the oven with a dab of butter @ 375 degrees for about 45-60 min*

Hope this helps and thanks for sharing ;)

Never tried spaghetti squash before so read the reviews and thought I would give it a try.  I didn't have feta cheese, so I decided to make it like a lasagne by spreading half the squash mixture in a 9x9 pan.  I sprinkled it with parmesan then added mozzarella and sharp cheese then topped it with the second half of squash and more cheese.  I was surprised how good it was.  I will be making this again and try it with the feta.  We didn't miss the meat or carbs.  Great dish.  Thank you for the recipe.

AMAZING!!! I followed the recipe exactly. I purchased a really big squash, so it took me longer than the 30 minutes to bake, but James' recipe stated that. The flavors were amazing! My husband is not a huge squash fan, but is asking me to make this again! Thank you, James!!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Since my husband doesn't like fresh tomatoes, I sauteed chopped red and yellow pepper with the onions and garlic.  Will try it next time with some zucchini.  This will go into my families' regular meal rotation.

This is one of the best tasting vegetarian dishes ever! Great combination of flavors, easy to make, and healthy. I think I'll be making this a regular dish. Yum!

Excellent and tasty dish, which is also very healthy for you!  If you want this spicier, use Ro-Tel instead of (or in addition to) tomatoes.

Love this. I used what I had on hand, a can of rotel tomatoes, feta and black olives. That's it. I also cut the spaghetti squash in half, cook it in the microwave about 6-7 minutes per half in a pyrex glass baking dish with enough water to cover the bottom of the dish. This is going to be my new favorite!!

This was awesome!  I love Sp squash but never really new what to put on it besides just tomato sauce (which isn't my favorite).  I used grape tomatoes because those were the ones that looked best in January.  Added a little salt at the end and about 1/4 teasp oregano in the onions

Husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was our first experience with spaghetti squash... What a great way to be introduced to a new vegetable!!  Very small changes to recipe were using olive oil and tomato/basil infused feta.

This was pretty good, and a great recipe if you've never cooked spaghetti squash (which I hadn't!).  As one reviewer suggested, I cooked the squash cut side down in a glass pan with water in it for about 30 min.  I omitted the feta cheese and olives and instead put in green peppers and spinach.  Also used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes.  We added crushed red pepper and parm cheese at the table and these extra flavors made it great!  I think next time I'll add some crushed red pepper to the oil to get the heat in the dish instead of adding it afterwards.  Thanks for this recipe!

This was awesome.  I'm not a big fan of feta cheese, but it made this recipe.  I did leave the squash in the oven for an hour per other reviews.  I will make this again.

Just Ok as a dish.  the texture was a little off putting for me but perhaps I didn't cook the squash long enough.  The next day we took the advice of another reviewer and added egg and bread crumbs and formed into pattys and pan fried.  Liked that much better.  May try again but not gonna be part of my weekly rotation

Super easy and delicious! I put the spaghetti squash in the microwave, whole, for 10 minutes. Cut it in half crosswise, scoop out the seeds and went from there. I also added about 2 cups of spinach right after adding the tomatoes, which added some nice color as well as additional nutrients. I also used Kalamata olives instead of black and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Fabulous. My husband and I finished the entire thing! Definitely a keeper!

I really liked this.  I used turkey breast instead of beef and thought it gave it a fresher taste and didn't overpower the fresh veggies.

One thing you need to tell people to scrap out the seeds before cooking I really think that people who are not use to hard squashes may not know that.

Loved this recipe. It was our first time eating spaghetti squash and it was delicious. I did what someone else suggested and put water in the baking sheet with the squash to get it tender quicker. I did not have olives or feta so I skipped those. I did put a lot of black pepper and minced garlic and it was very flavorful.

This is the very first spaghetti squash recipe I ever tried and my husband and I love it. This recipe doesn't give a squash size, but I've found it works best with a smallish squash. I increase the ingredients for larger ones. That's the only reason I only gave it 4 stars. I also leave out the black olives because I don't like them. Sometimes I add other sauteed veggies, like mushrooms or green peppers just to switch it up. It's a wonderful recipe to start with if you've never eaten spaghetti squash & it keeps wonderfully for take to work lunches.

Great! Fresh basil is totally essential and you should use a large spaghetti squash--about enough for 3 cups worth.

My boys thought it was angel hair pasta and licked their plates! I stsrted the squash in the oven but got tired of it not cooking through and ffinished it in the microwave. I'd suggest you start there. Really great and just served it with a side salad. Welcome to the summer rotation spaghetti squash!

A lover of all kinds of squash I sought out this recipe to broaden my horizons. Like others, I have altered the recipe to suit my taste. I switched olives for zucchini, added salt and pepper, and replaced yellow onion with red.  It paired great with chicken marinated in Newman's Balsamic Vinaigrette.

I am obsessed with this dish. So satisfying for a dish primarily made of veggies. I omitted the garlic and added a good dose of olive oil right before serving (and I did cook the squash for closer to 45 mins). Perfect summer dinner.

Great recipe!!  I used way more fresh basil than what the recipe called for, probably close to 1/2 cup,  because I love the taste of it.  That's the only thing I changed.

This is divine!  Although, unless this is meant to be a side dish, I don't know how on earth it would serve six.  Maybe I am buying too small a squash...

Have never had spaghetti squash.  Thought this came out awesome.  I added red bell pepper and mushroom to it.  Next time I do this, I will add more vegetables.  Also had to keep the feta and olives separate because my vegetarian daughter isn't a fan.

Great - good advice to poke holes and cook whole before slicing in half (I bought a large squash and couldn't half it raw)

I love spaghetti squash! I usually make it like spaghetti & meatballs (great low point Weight Watchers meal!). I was looking for a different way to make it....and this was a great new recipe! Definitely a keeper! I added some kidney beans...I would add some chick peas too. You can add anything to this recipe! I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil, I never use vegetable oil for anything. EVOO or Canola only! Thanks so much for this recipe!

Wow. Hadn't ever had spaghetti squash before this, and have made it twice since. Crunchy strings means you haven't cooked the squash quite enough (happened my second go-round). I leave out the olives since I don't care for them and have added mushrooms, zucchini, etc. Very versatile! Sometimes I forget I'm eating squash and not pasta.

Oh my, it has been a long time since I have had spaghetti squash and I love this recipe.  It is light and easy to make.  I sauteed onions, garlic, zuchinni, and mushrooms in olive oil and then added some fresh grape tomatoes (quartered) and black olives.  Tossed with the squash and topped with sundried tomato feta cheese!  It's so easy to adjust to whatever veggies you prefer or what is fresh.  This recipe is a keeper.

This is my go-to SS 101 recipe.  It's almost (nothing is perfect) infallible.  I always oven bake it in halves, salted--noticed that micro deadens flavor.  I use EVOO, omit the onion (too sweet), add more garlic (4-5 minced cloves), then add the remaining recommended ingredients.  You can't go wrong here.  Then, fellow adventurers, let your taste buds and stock-on-hand dictate the rest.  Sometimes:  other herbs or spices (do try fried cumin seeds and garam masala--oh my!), roasted red peppers, and/or toss in any greens (lots of baby spinach, or chiffonade chard, escarole; even wild malva), and/or sun dried/oil cured tomatoes, and/or (if you aren't a vegetarian, like me), slivers of dried salami or proscuitto.  If you can dream it, let it happen.  This is simple alchemy, not science.  Some fun!

First time making spaghetti squash! I followed SammyCooks' advice regarding baking with a little water, I added a bit more garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Loved it! Thank you! I will be making this again!

This is really good.  I didn't have basil and don't like feta, so they didn't make it to the recipe, but everyone in the family went looking for seconds.  Thank you for posting this!

I loved it; my family did not. They prefer the traditional spaghetti squash with spaghetti sauce and sausage.  I didn't have time to use my traditional crockpot cooking method of pouring 2 cups of water into the pot, pierce the squash with holes, and cook on low 8-9 hours. So, I tried two methods: oven and stovetop. Oven: preheat oven to 375, cut squash in half, put in pan and add water to 1/2 inches, bake for 45 minutes or until done. Stovetop: Bring a pot of water to a boil at medium high heat, add squash ensuring that it's covered halfway; cook 30 minutes turning halfway through. For simplicity, I love the crockpot method. A close second was the oven method--the only downfall was the difficulty in cutting the raw squash. The stovetop method although quicker was very difficult in separating the strands from the seeds in the end. I liked this recipe but I love spaghetti squash. Thanks for sharing.

This was ok - not good or bad really.  We had this for lunch, which I put into a wrap.  I did make the squash in the microwave as suggested by Joann74, and that worked well.  I probably won't make it again, but it's fun to try something new.  Thanks.

This was a great way to serve spaghetti squash(SS), I'll always use this recipe  from  now on!!!  My husband is a 'gourmet' cook and he's not a fan of SS (how I prepared it) so, I tried this recipe and he raved about it!!! He was prepared for my usual recipe of SS, so he still wanted his traditional pasta and sauce. (This was his side dish)

Modifications: 1) I  poked holes in the SS(before cutting it in half) and put it in the microwave for 5- 10mins to soften the skin . This makes cutting it in half easier; 2) then put it in the oven (350) for 15-18 mins; 3)  added sun-dried tomatoes(since I had them in the  frig)  along with the fresh tomatoes in the skillet; 4) did not add black olives(hubby not a fan of olives) .  Thank you for sharing a great version of SS.

This was very tasty and so healthy. I added pinto beans for protein. Used dried basil. Didn't have onion, but did add red pepper. Used kalamata olives instead of black. I ate my seconds without feta and it was still yummy. good healthy recipe.

I may have to make this my signature dish when i go to family dinners! Tried it out for the first time tonite and everyone loved it... they liked the many textures and tastes.  I made a couple additions.. added some pasta since no one had spagetti squash before, but the pasta didnt take anything away from the squash texture and flavor, and used shallots instead of onions. Really great recipe, thanks for sharing!

This topping is excellent! I think the squash probably need to be cooked longer, about 50 minutes.  We typically eat spagetti squash with some butter and cheese, but this definately kicked it up a notch. I didn't have olives, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was excellent!

I am quite surprised at how good this really was, and how simple it was to make.  Instead of feta cheese I used fresh grated parmesan cheese. It worked well with the tomatoes, garlic and basil.
I paired it with fresh wild sockeye salmon.  
perfect.

I didn't use the onions or olives. When I baked the squash I added some extra water and 2 cloves of garlic. When I sauteed the sweet peppers I used coconut oil and added some dried red pepper. Delicious.

This was good. I was wary at first, even with all of the good reviews, but if I ever happen to have a Spaghetti Squash again, this is what I'll be doing with it. It wasn't just edible, it was appetizing! I did, however, use parmesan instead, since that's what I had on hand. What an interesting squash!

I wish I would've tried this recipe 20 years ago.   I used bell pepper, onion, those skinny white eggplant, and fresh tomato...very Greek Salady tasting.  I've tried spaghetti squash with red sauce and was not impressed.  THIS IS A DO OVER AGAIN AND AGAIN.

We loved this dish in our house. The first bite my daughter wasn't sold, but I think she got a big hunk of basil. We both decided we didn't care for the basil in it, and one we picked around the big pieces, she devoured it. She even took leftovers for lunch today. I did leave out the olives since we are not fans of them, and added some red peppers. Next time I will leave put the basil and put in some fresh spinach. I will also add some mushrooms. Super easy meal, and soooo good. Thanks!!

This is a great recipe - I didn't have fresh tomatoes and don't care for olives so I used a box of pomi chopped tomatoes, threw in some snow peas, and added fresh spinach the last minute or so of cooking - makes a great main dish!

Great recipe. Made it for my husband the other night who had never had spaghetti squash and he LOVED it...he told me that I can make it as often as I want to. The best part, we didn't feel guilty when we had seconds.

Spaghetti Squash is one of my all time favorites so I'm always looking for new recipes.  This is AWESOME!  My children devoured it within minutes and it was so super easy to make.  I hate olives so I left them out; didn't have fresh basil so I used dried (totally fine, but when my garden is in bloom I will always use fresh).  The feta was a nice touch and this was a perfect side dish with pork tenderloin.  Yum!

This is far and away the most delectable recipe I've ever tried for spaghetti squash. I used a carton of grape tomatoes instead of chopping tomatoes. I also added some roasted artichoke hearts. The fresh basil and feta give this such an irresistible flavor it's hard to stop eating. We enjoyed this as a main course for meatless Monday. This is going into my regular rotation!!!!!

If I could give this recipe more stars, I would.  It's like a flavor explosion in your mouth!  My husband almost passed out after one bite he said it tasted so good.  I used grape tomatoes, a full cup of feta, and lots of fresh basil.  Thank you James for the terrific recipe.  It will definitely be a keeper in my kitchen!

It really doesn't have to be "Spaghetti" Squash....any "gourd" will do.  I have 5 month old pumpkins and acorn squash.  I buy them cheap and  if clean and undamaged, they last a long time. Pumpkin starts looking just like "spaghetti" inside...and can be removed easily with a fork.

I feed my Shar Pei a mostly natural diet...and this is part of it.  (no onions, of course).  I just cooked up some pumpkin "noodles" with onions and seasoning for me....yummmmy!  Some onions, garlic, almond slices, flax seed...whatever ya want to throw in.  Make it healthy!..Canola is mostly GMO...use organic coconut or extra virgin organic olive oil.  You can make a pasta dish...or use them in any way you would use other "noodles"...very healthy....;-)

I thought it was really tasty.  I agreed with the other posters in that the squash needs to bake at least 40 mins. or longer.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, added the stewed tomatoes and added mushrooms and zucchini.  I also added more seasonings to ensure it wasn't bland.  I was happy with the outcome!

This was pretty good, it was my first attempt at spaghetti squash so I was not sure what to expect. I guess i was expecting softer "noodles" since everyone claimed this to be just like spaghetti, but they are hard (unless I did it wrong). The flavors were good though! I think next time i'll add sauteed spinach and mushrooms too.

Used as a basic recipe - only needed a tsp or two of oil (olive) and sauteed onion, red pepper, cherry tomatoes and a chicken thigh.  Added chopped cucumber and feta cheese on top.  Yum.

This was full of flavor and really easy! Maybe next time, I should make it as a side rather than the main course, as it seemed like you wanted something else if not just to freshen your pallet.  But a really great recipe!  Will definitely make again!

I've never eaten spaghetti squash before, but had been wanting to try as I am trying not to eat carbs for dinner. I thought this was amazing. Like another reviewer said, the squash is not offensive at all and the basil and feta stood out ....yummy :)

Tasted very fresh and healthy but it missed a "kick". I cooked chicken tenders dipped in egg then parmesan/italian bread crumbs on the oven and mixed it in and it was complete! My mom loved it and said it was "very light". Thanks for the recipe!

I would give this a five star, just because it's a cool surprise. I added pork tenderloin with a bit of greek seasoning, peppers, zucchini, and green olives. I really liked the texture and taste of spaghetti squash, I could see it good on it's only really. Enjoy...and thanks for posting James!

This was amazing. It was my first try with spaghetti squash.  My family loved it. Will be made again and again. Didn't have onions but used scallions...sauted them with olive oil, mushrooms garlic and fresh baby spinach...added a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes.  Cooked and added to buttered spaghetti squash.  Delish.

Everyone at my house loved this... except for me.  It wasn't awful, but something about the texture and the smell, didn't appeal to me at all.  To be fair, it was my first time eating spaghetti squash and, like I said, everyone else loved it.  Maybe I'll try again...

First time to make spaghetti squash.  Only used half and added sauted garlic, sweet peppers, pearl onions, shredded carrots, green beans and parmesan.  Was great!  Will use the other half for my doggies food as we feed the an all natural diet.  Nothing wasted here!

So I was very skeptical about spaghetti squash until a co worker told me about it since i'm on the Atkins diet(low carb) well I found this recipe and I feel in love with it, it is really good and very easy to make for beginners like myself. This will be a dish to made a lot in my house.

I love all the ingredients in this recipe, so I was really excited to try it. But what a let down it turned out to be! I can't even put my finger on it...something just isn't right here. I even made it a second time to see if I just messed something up the first time. Nope - exact same result. It tastes bland yet overwhelming at the same time. I don't even know how to explain it. Very strange. I gave it a shot (actually TWO shots), but now I think I'm crossing this one off my list for good!

This is a rating from my hubby because he is the veggy lover and he said he would eat this dish whenever I would make it for him.  He loved it.  He always brings home squash but never cooks it.  This was great and made accordingly.  Did add peppers because I hubby loves them.  I added chicken teriyaki meatballs to mine and that made it perfect for my taste.  Thanks for sharing.

I was afraid I wouldn't be able to adapt to spaghetti squash instead of pasta, but this is really tasty. The feta tops it off perfectly and pulls all the fresh flavors together. I had to make changes because of what I had left in the garden (veggies: canned tomatoes, sweet red pepper, onion, garlic, mushroom and carrot; herbs:  parsley, rosemary, and sorrel). Easy, flexible, and delicious!

Added fresh broccoli, mushrooms and subbed the feta for monterrey jack. Great color and quite delicious. Passed my non-squash boyfriend pretty well and felt great getting all those veggies in a meal with no simple starches!

Very delicious! It was my first time making spaghetti squasha and I think it was a little under done, but still good! I added chicken to the pan just before adding the onions and made it a meal. He also really liked it. Will make again!

AMAZING! 
I followed a suggestion and made the sauce prior to, added 26 oz of organic stewed tomatoes with basil; once chopped tomato, italian seasonings, garlic salt, garlic, onions, and let simmer for an hour. ten minutes before serving, I added the olives, and basil. I added a shake of Johnny's seasoning to the squash as I scraped it. My family LOVED this, and asked if we could have it again tomorrow! (one of my kids is an immensely picky-- and he ate it all first!!) ENJOY!

My husband loves this recipe, so we make it a lot! We are usually out of olives, so its kind of a treat when we have them. And we've been out of feta on occasion, so we use freshly shredded parmesan. I tried adding ground turkey once, for the protein, but he requested that I just leave it vegetarian from now on. From a meat-and-potatoes guy, this was quite the compliment!

Didn't have feta or olives but this was pretty good.  Used parmesan cheese instead.  Couldn't even tell it wasn't real spaghetti noodles.  Making this now for a second time.  Will need to grow spat. Squash next year.

Love this recipe. I have made it several times. Excellent with some crusty bread. I usually add a bit more basil and some oregano and I brown the onions before adding the garlic. I don't always add the olives, just depends on if I have them on hand. I would like to try it with green olives (especially the smokey ones).

Excellent!  I used red and yellow tomato as I had them and they added color.  Olive oil instead of veg, lots more garlic and salt & pepper. Yummy, my husband loved it and so low in calories it was easy to fill up on it.  We also had a bit of baguette with it.
I will definitely make again.

This recipe is GREAT! I wanted a light, healthy meal for the night and decided on this. It is so easy to make and very tasty! Next time I will take the suggestion to add some pesto or a marinara sauce to add some more flavor.

Very tasty dish. Simple to make. I substituted first cold press extra virgin olive oil for the vegetable oil and omitted the onion as we are not big on onions. I have also tried this dish the same as above but also adding a bit of pesto. Very delicious.

Awesome recipe!!!!  The ingredients put so much flavor in the squash that it transformed it into a greek flavored delight! I prepared my squash earlier in the day, scooped out the squash and stored it in the fridge until dinner time.  I warmed it a bit in the microwave and then added it to the saute pan with the tomato, onion and garlic until it was all warmed through.  Tossed that mixture in  a serving dish with the remailning ingredients and enjoyed!!!  Next time I want to try adding fresh spinach or garbanzo beans!!

The hubby and I enjoyed it very much. In fact my hubby added jalapenos to it for extra flavor and heat. For the kids we put on banana peppers. Not all the kids agreed that was a good idea! :) Good vegetarian  transition meal and we will use it many times in the future.

I was very skeptical about trying this recipe since several reviews mentioned taste was bland; I also didn't have a clue as to what to expect since I never ate spaghetti squash.    Coming from a pure Italian family where pasta is staple; I was wowed by this recipe.  My 13 year old son also liked it; THAT'S a double WOW. I cooked in microwave for 6 minutes and put in oven at 375 degrees in 1/2 inch water for 60 minutes.  This is a very good recipe; didn't change the seasoning, just added salt and pepper.  I also doubled on the garlic.  Great recipe - thanks

This was very tasty, satisfied my craving for italian food, and was easy. The spaghetti squash is more chewy than the regular spaghetti, and we preferred some salt. A nice change, and quite acceptable as a one-dish meal. I did use 8 ounces of ground beef just to bump up the protein content. It also was nice to have all the basic flavors of a sauce without the paste or tomato sauce - which tends to bother my tummy!

This was easy and delicious! I will definitely make again and try a few of the suggestions of other reviewers. My super finicky Mother even liked it even though it is somewhat healthy. I served with pork tenderloin but I can't wait to try with grilled fish. Thanks so much to James for sharing.

Having never made this before, I guess I was expecting more of a consistency of actual pasta, which this was not. It came out like angel hair but really, really thin and limp. There was no "body" to it so when I mixed it in with everything else, it just sort of clumped together. You definitely couldn't twirl it around a fork! That being said, it was good. I like squash but if you are a real hard core pasta lover, this will NOT even come close to the real deal.

It was ok.  I was expecting to really love it based on the rating.  Maybe I didn't do something right and need to try it again.  Needed salt in my opinion.

I made this for the first time last night with a "friend". It was a fun meal that we enjoyed making together. I think I'm going to make it again tonight, this time I think I'll add some spinach, mushrooms, and I may sneak a piece of chicken breast or two on top.

This was a wonderful, SUPER dish!  After reading many reviews:  I followed the recipe, however changed the baking a little.  I did microwave the squash for 6 minutes to make it easier to manage and cut.  Once out of the microwave, I removed the seeds and then baked the halves facedown for 45 minutes in about an inch of water at 350.   That was about all that I changed from the recipe, the squash came out perfect, I love the feta in this recipe.  Give it a try!  I will definitely be making this again!

This was my first time making spaghetti squash and it was easy. Cooking the squash, anyway you do it, is simple...just depends on your preference. The recipe is very tasty. It was a bit "rich" for me...I could only eat so much of it at one time...but it was very good.

This dish was excellent and I'd make it again.
I made one larger change - I always pressure cook squash - its so much faster and no added oil. Just a little bit of water (not much) and let it steam for about 7 min after the steam has started.

This recipe was so good and so easy to follow! I added a diced red pepper and spinach and I also used diced Kalamata olives instead of black olives to give it more of a Greek twist. Overall, a great recipe! Thanks! :)

I made this the other day. My hubby thought it was good but better as a side dish that he didn't care for it as his main meal. I on the other hand thought it was pretty good. Not the best thing I've ever had but good enough that I would be willing to make it again!! I baked my squash with 1 1/2 cups of water like another reviewer mentioned. Then I sauteed olive oil with a ton of garlic, onions, mushrooms, broccoli, red pepper, kale & fresh tomatoes.  I also put feta & parm cheese on top. I thought the feta was a wonderful addition to it & really made the dish!!! I've never had spaghetti squash but I thought it was pretty good! Thanks for the recipe!

Delish and  a keeper. I made this tonight. Both myself and my husband thought it was great..I used more garlic than what the recipe calls for but everything else was the same..ALSO I used fresh Feta, it makes such a huge difference in any recipe.

I served this to my meat and potatoes boyfriend and he loved it. He was very skeptical about the squash until he tried it.  Regardless of how you cook the squash this is tasty and easy.

Delicious!!!!  I did bake it in a pan of water and it made it easier to handle.  It was delicious.  My family and I ate it 2 days in a row.  Loved it.  Next time I make it, my hubby said he would like to add Italian sausage.

Unbelievably delicious!  I picked up a spaghetti squash the other day because it seemed like a fun seasonal vegetable.  I had never cooked with or eaten spaghetti squash, so I started looking for recipes, and this one had the most reviews.  It was absolutely amazing and immediately became one of my favorite dinners.    I made a few modifications: added 1 small zucchini(chopped; the green was really pretty in this dish), and a few dashes of red pepper flakes and white pepper to give it a little heat.  Left out the olives because I don't like them.  I couldn't cut through the spaghetti squash, so I cooked it for 30 minutes, cut it in half and cooked it for another 20 minutes.    My husband and I absolutely loved this dish!  Fun for fall when squash is in season but also light enough to be a delicious meal any time of year.

I could not eat this. It was more like zero stars. The spaghetti squash was completely tasteless and the rest of the ingredients just didn't work with it. I'm pretty much sworn off of spaghetti squash from this time forward, sorry to say.

Left out olives to suit taste, and used cherry tomatoes for the sake of presentation.  This is a unique use of spaghetti squash and goes along GREAT with a Greek-inspired meal.

This spaghetti squash is so healthy and so delicious! I microwaved the squash whole for about 3 minutes so it would be easier to cut. I cut it lengthwise and baked it on a baking sheet for 45 minutes (I prefer the squash to be alittle crunchy, you can bake it 1hr if you prefer it more soft). I used onion, seedless cucumbers, mushrooms, petite diced tomatoes and chopped black olives for my "sauce" and topped it with fat free feta cheese. It was sooo yummy!

Awesome!  I also sauteed a zucchini squash and mushrooms with the onions, and added chopped spinach and a can of chickpeas at the end.  What a great, healthy, flavor-filled meal - will definitely make this again.

Great dish and healthy too.  When I was getting the olives out, I noticed a can of green chiles and used those instead of the olives to give it an added kick.   We loved it and will definitely make again.

I thought this dish was okay and I feel bad about it.  I enjoy meatless main dishes, but thought this was lacking as a main dish.  It'd make a nice side.  Otherwise next time I'd add spinach, subract the feta and make a alfedo sauce to pour over the top.

This recipe was great!  I highly recommend it.  We used olived oil (instead of vegetable oil) and goat cheese (instead of feta) ... and added extra garlic b/c we love it.  We did end up cooking the squash for 40 minutes instead of 30.  Definitely try this ... just a little prep while the squash is cooking .. an easy meal.

This was very simple but tasty to make.  I'm not a big fan of spaghetti squash, but this is a very nice combination of flavors.  I might even pick up another spaghetti squash so I can have this again!

It was good, but I felt like it was missing something, although I couldn't figure out what.  My husband suggested we try it with Italian sausage next time, although I'm not really a meat person.

As all of my veggies were straight from the garden, this was a great way to enjoy the abundance of the season!  I didn't have any olives or feta, but did have some extra green peppers.  I also added sea salt, red pepper flakes, and some Braggs seasoning (not liquid aminos, but the dry type) and some nutritional yeast (has a cheesy flavor).  It turned out amazing!

Absolutely wonderful! The only thing I did different was I used 1 Tbs olive oil to sautee the onions, and I added some marinated artichoke hearts to give a little extra kick. I will definitely be making this again!

I was really excited to make this since I've never used spaghetti squash before and boy was I disappointed. It was just so... meh. Fresh, healthy and colorful but lacking any depth in flavor. I will not make this again.

the "sauce" has a good taste, but this meals just doesn't go well all together. Gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because I would try the sauce again, using it with something other than the squash.

I agree with everyone who stated they have never had this type of squash and don't particularly love squash: THIS ROCKS! I had to modify the recipe because I was missing a couple of ingredients but it still was hands down delish rated by 3 people who fit the above category. And yes, it does need baked longer.

Pretty darn good!  I used marinated artichokes instead of black olives, and subbed dried basil for fresh b/c I didn't have any of the latter.

Wonderful delicious & low carb dish.  For my husband & I, a single squash was enough for 2 full meals. Note: Squash should have about 1/4" water in the bottom of the pan to help with the cooking. You may need to add more about halfway through.  It took about 40 minutes to bake.  It's a keeper!

Excellent recipe!  I had never made spaghetti squash before, and this was just great.  The one change I made was to add a splash of balsamic vinegar to the dish right before serving...divine!  It really bumped up the overall taste of the dish...can't wait to make this again!

SOOO good! I didn't have fresh tomatoes so i used diced can tomatoes which worked out fine as well. To make it a little spicy I also added a little garlic chili paste to the onion and oil. next time I make it I will add some zucchini as well.

This was a good flavour combination, but I found it to be a little bland. I left out the olives but otherwise made as written. If I make again, I'll add some additional veggies.

This was super yummy!  We didn't have the tomatoes and it was still good.  Next time I would just cook the squash in the microwave with a damp paper towel. The roasted squash took closer to an hour then 30 minutes.

I would suggest cooking this 45 minutes to an hour.  cooking only 30 minutes leaves the "noodles" crunchy.  They are better when they are softer.

SO YUMMY!  Used all fresh, locally grown veggies. Used the microwave on the squash.  Cut it in half, scrapped out the seeds, and 5 - 6 min on each side w/wet paper towel over the top.  Didn't use olives, and used garlic salt.  Added parmesan cheese over the top.  Husband practically licked the bowl.  A definite re-peat meal!

Yummy! I just made this for my boyfriend and I, I'm on a low carb diet so this was just perfect! Lots of punch of flavours from each individual item. We're not a huge fan of black olives so I put just a little bit instead and it was still amazing. I put lots of feta cheese ;) I will definitely be making this again! Thanks to James for sharing this!

Fantastic! I enjoy a recipe with a lot of flavor and this is it! I made a few changes; 2 large cloves of garlic, no olives and a lot of cracked black pepper. I did use fresh basil, extra light olive olive oil and (quartered) grape tomatoes. I also used reduced-fat feta cheese. I dated a vegan years ago and have avoided spaghetti squash ever since, after having had it once and remembering it to be very bland. This redeemed the SS for me and I have eaten it for lunch AND dinner today. It reheated beautifully in the microwave in 50 seconds for two servings. I cooked the squash as directed and the noodles were done, yet kind of crunchy. That took me by surprise at first, but by the time I had dinner, I was used to it. I may consider cooking the squash a bit longer next time to make the noodles softer, especially if I am serving it to guests. I am very excited to have found this recipe as I am a member of a produce delivery club that focuses on fresh fruits and veggies locally grown in NC and I never know what is going to be offered week to week. I got my SS 3-weeks ago and it kept just fine until I was ready to cook it. I simply kept it in a fruit bowl on the counter, rather than putting it in the fridge. I had read that it would be okay stored up to a month in a cool area. I now have a new favorite veggie!

Great recipe.  I don't like olives so I used red and orange peppers instead.  It was even great the next day.  :)  I used another reviewer's water method (1.5 c water in a glass dish) to cook the spaghetti squash.

Very healthy and  delicious. My family of picky eaters thought it was pasta!  It is comparable to Carinos Angel Hair Artichoke pasta dish when you add capers and artichokes and use olive oil. Yummy!

Really really good. The first thing I've made in a long time that I wouldn't change the next time around. Maybe not hearty enough for a main course on it's own for me, but still really nice. Added a squeeze of lemon juice at the end. The fresh basil is absolutely key - dried just wouldn't be the same.

Added spaghetti sauce to this recipe…FANTASTIC!!! For veggies, I used zucchini, mushrooms, red onion sautéed in olive oil and minced garlic. Also added Quorn meatless grounds for protein. Sprinkled  feta cheese on top. Try it, you won’t be disappointed!

This was my first time making spaghetti squash.  I really liked it.   Recipe was easy to make and very tasty.  The Feta cheese gave it a different twist and complimented the noodles.  Enjoy.

This did not suit our tastes; it was too tangy (maybe I didn't cook the squash right?).  And we didn't love the texture.

This was delicious and super easy!  I added extra basil, thin slices of green pepper, crushed red pepper, left out the olives since I'm not so fond and put parmesan cheese on top.  So easy and delicious..can't wait to make it again!!!

Great recipe for the Spaghetti squash!!  VERY YUMMY - kids won't even know they are eating squash!  We didn't have olives so we did without and I used a can of diced tomatoes - Italian style because that was what I had on hand.  Yum!

O goodness!  So very good.  I will be making this over and over again.  Followed recipe exactly except for using canned tomatoes as that is all that I had on hand.  Next time I will buy fresh tomatoes, as I think it will make it out of this world! Thank you for an amazing supper James!

I've made this every year at Thanksgiving for the last three or four years now. It's so easy and different and colorful, and my family loves it. I use grape tomatoes, halved, and I use a whole 2.25-oz can of olives and a little more feta to suit our tastes. Baking time for the squash is usually closer to an hour for me, depending on the size of the squash.

This was really good -- we'll need to think of a more colorful name for it, though. :)  I knew I would need a little more seasoning, so I added salt and crushed red pepper to the onion, garlic and tomato mixture; plus I added a jalapeno and some mushrooms.  I also seasoned the squash.  I also used 3 whole tomatoes, a whole small can of olives and 2 cloves of garlic because I knew I would like more of these ingredients.  I also added a little more feta to individual servings.  Will definitelty make this again.  My husband suggested topping it with sauteed shrimp -- might try this.

I made this for dinner the other night and it was delicious.  I did make a few changes.  I cooked two squashes and had to bake for about 45 minutes to get them soft enough.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used one large can (28 oz I think) of diced tomatoes with the juice.  I used kalamata olives and dry basil.  I sauteed the onion and garlic, then dumped everything else into the pan and let it simmer while the squash cooked.  Right before serving, I added about half of the feta cheese to the pan of sauce to melt.  To serve, I scraped out the "noodles," topped with sauce, then sprinkled with the remaining feta cheese.  This made enough sauce for 1.5 large (3+ lb each) squashes.

I've always heard that spaghetti squash doesn't "taste like squash", but I didn't believe it.  Well, I'm a believer now!  A great recipe for which I will ever be grateful for turning me on to an incredible vegetable.

This is a wonderful recipe with a few additions! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, left out the olives(because I’m not a fan),added zucchini, orange bell pepper, and eggplant. I also cooked up some Italian sausage in a pan (with coconut oil) and sliced this up and added it to the dish. It is probably the best thing I have eaten in a long time - at home or out. I have recommended this recipe to everyone I know. The sausage and orange bell pepper really add a lot of flavor.  Use the feta you won’t be disappointed.  I don't think the other cheese reviewers recommend would do the same trick. ENJOY!!!!

This was my first time making spaghetti squash and it turned out awesome. It was so much fun running the fork down to get the strings out. This is such a great alternative for me instead of pasta. I'm on a new eating plan and I just love it. Next time I am going to add chicken to the recipe to give it a little more portein. Instead of plain feta cheese I added some mediterain feta cheese and it turned out great.

We are vegetarians and making pasta becomes boring after awhile. This dish was surprisingly delicious, better than regular pasta because it has a mild sweet taste. It has become a staple in our house. I used half of an onion and two cloves of garlic to give it more of a bold taste. I added some black pepper at the end when mixing all the ingredients. Great!

We really enjoyed this dish!  We like spaghetti squash anyway, but I wanted to try something different and this used ingredients we know we like.  I did use olive oil rather than vegetable oil, but otherwise followed the recipe as given, using fresh ingredients just harvested from our and our neighbor's gardens.  Excellent!

So delicious! The major complaint from reviewers was that the squash was crispy, so I used a different method of cooking the squash. I pierced it all over like I would with a baked potato and roasted it for an hour at 375. When it cooled enough to handle it I sliced it, deseeded it, and used a fork to get the meat out. It turned out perfectly this way! I did add salt and pepper to taste. This was my first time trying spaghetti squash and I will definitely make it again!

This was my first time ever preparing (or eating!) spaghetti squash, and I am sold! This was so good, I almost couldn't stop eating it! I added plenty of garlic, cucumbers and artichoke hearts. This is definitely going to become a regular meal at my house. Thank you!

This is a great recipe and very versatile.  The only thing I did differently was to add some crumbled bacon & zucchini. I definitely recommend adding a little bacon.  It gives the sauce a nice flavor.

Hubby & I loved this recipe. I prepared the recipe as written. However, I had some leftover asparagus which I had cooked on the grill (nice and smoky flavor). I cut the asparagus into 1" pieces and added them. WOW. It's a very adaptable receipe. Thanks.

Love it, I've made it 4 times since I first made it about a year ago.  It's a great recipe to fall back on for a quick meal (aside from the cooking time).

I was concerned because I never had spaghetti squash before and I was pleasantly surprised how much it did resemble pasta. I was also worried when the squash was watery, but what I did was combine everything (except the feta) in a casserole dish and topped it with some panko italian seasoning bread crumbs.  Then I broiled it for 5 minutes.  It was perfect.  I would make this again.

if you haven't made this yet, make it! More flavor and texture than pasta, and so much better for you. Go crazy adding veggies in, it makes it even more of a meal on it's own.

So good!! I added red pepper flakes and omitted the olives because I didnt have any. I also cut up some hot italian sausage and tossed it in there to make a complete meal. I used red and green bell peppers in addition to the onion.

I was looking for something light after a snowy Sunday of picking at not so healthy food all day and started looking for something different to do with the small spaghetti squash that I had on hand. Came across this and realizing that I had Sardinian Feta and Kalamata olives on hand but no tomatoes or Basil (winter in NH!)decided to try it with what I had on hand. I slowly sauteed a thinly sliced onion in EVOO added some chopped red pepper,Cavandash Greek seasoning, a little later added two cloves of chopped garlic and the chopped olives. While pouring my glass of Pinot gave the pan a shot while I scooped out the squash and then threw it all together in a bowl with the Feta and some chopped fresh flat leaf parsley.  Wow! Very tasty, keeper recipe that is probably great with the fresh ingredients called for, but adapts well to improv. Only regret was that I didn't have a decent piece of bread to go with it, but I over ate once again anyway!

This was delicious and very easy to make. I don't care for tomatoes much, so I only used half the amount. I also used goat cheese instead of feta - it was perfect! This would even be great in a simpler version with just the onions, garlic, basil, and cheese.. will definitely make again!

This was delicious, even though I adapted for what I had on hand.  I sauteed an onion, a couple cloves of garlic, several mushrooms, a head of broccoli, and some spinach along with a can of drained diced tomatoes.  After the veggies were mostly cooked I added a can of tomato paste, a splash of red wine, and some chicken broth, and powdered basil and oregano, stirred it all well and let it cook covered for a few minutes till everything was totally done.  I then put it and the squash insides in a big bowl and tossed, then topped it with goat cheese, and my boyfriend and I both loved it.  Definitely easily adapted to your veggies/tastes!

This recipe was very good! I added in a half of a finely chopped zucchini, 1.5 tsp of Kosher salt, 1/2 tsp garlic salt, a few dashes of cayenne, a pinch of italian seasoning and crushed red pepper and a heaping tsp of minced garlic. I sauteed the garlic, onion, and zucchini together, tossed in a can of diced tomatoes in place of raw, added the seasonings and heated through. Cooking the squash halves, open side down for 30 minutes in 1.5 cups of water worked wonderfully! I will absolutely be making this again! Oh yes, and the feta really brings the dish together beautifully. I highly recommend this recipe. **Just an update, I've made this dish several times and it's a regular. When I don't have zucchini, I toss in another veggie, like spinach and just eyeball it to how much I like. I microwave the spaghetti squash halves like recommended, 5-6 minutes each on face up and face down. I also season to taste at the end. When I don't have feta, gorgonzola is also yummy. Thanks for the recipe!

I've served something much like this to rave reviews. I've also used fresh chevre and tomato instead of the feta and olives, which we like just as well. 

It helps to put a little water on the cookie sheet with the squash - the steam keeps it moist and speeds the cooking a bit.

I had never had spaghetti squash before and I was really impressed.  The squash takes on the flavor of whatever sauce its in.  I added two small roasted peppers chopped to the recipe and I loved the result.

Excellent!  My 3 year old ate it and my husband said "spaghetti squash is better than I remembered it" 
I took the advice of others and added 1 1/2 c water when baking and turned out perfect.  Used EVOO instead of vegetable oil, omitted olives and sauted broccoli instead for color.

I modified this recipe a bit and it turned out so delicious. 

I didn't add the olives or the onions, but I added garlic and substituted cilantro for the basil. In addition, I made "basil chicken strips" (available online All Recipes) and added it to the spaghetti squash. 

I'm definitely making this again, the way I did it above.

This is a nice option for Spaghetti Squash.  But I think I still like it better with plain ol' butter and salt and pepper. I didn't have any tomatoes so I added a drained can of Rotel.  Then sauteed the onion and garlice in olive oil, and topped with fresh parm cheese.  The rotel gave it a nice, spicey bite.  The little kids weren't too into it, but the vegetarians in the family loved it!  Oh, it's hard to slice a raw spaghetti squash so poke a few holes in it and microwave for about 4 minutes.  Then it's soft enough to slice. I often put it back in the microwave after scooping out the insides to finish cooking--just add some butter and cover it with saran wrap.

This recipe is a keeper!  My husband not only went back for seconds, he went back for thirds! I did make some changes to it to make it a more substantial meal.  I omitted the oil and browned 1 lb. bulk pork sausage with the onion, garlic and 1/4 cup chopped green pepper.  I added the whole 2.5 oz. can of sliced olives and a 4 oz. can of mushrooms along with a 1 pt. bottle of my own diced tomatoes. (I would've added fresh tomatoes from my garden, but it's October and they had already frozen.)  I did forget to add the basil, but it was extremely tasty without it. I like basil, so I'll add it next time I make this wonderful recipe.  Everything else was the same.  It made a big 9x13-inch pan and even though there were only two of us, there was hardly any leftover!

Outstanding! The blend of flavors from each ingredient went together perfect. Very nice to have a new way to make this squash besides brown-sugar, butter, and cinnamon. It's a keeper in our house and would be a great dish for winter or summer. Thank you!

WOW! This was the first time I have ever had Spaghetti squash and it was yummy. I made a few changes. First, I poked holes in the squash and microwaved it for about 6 minutes. Then I added fresh red and green peppers to the onion and garlic saute mix and cherry tomatoes. Perfect for all of my Mom's home grown veges.

Very good recipe.  My husband does not like squash but he really liked this.  My teen daughter loved itand went back for seconds.
I added Kosher salt and a bit of pepper to add flavor.  Also, since I grew an abundance of bell peppers, I sauted one with the onions.  The tomatoes were vine ripe from my garden.  Yum.
The Feta cheese was the perfect accent of flavor.

On a diet so its hard to come up with different veggie recipes everyday. This was great.  I used no fat feta with basil and sundried tomatoes and it was AWESOME.  Was a little worried about my husband but he loved it.

Just made this tonight for dinner and WOW, was it good!! I'd never made or eaten a spaghetti squash dish, and this recipe has me sold. Our oven wasn't working, so I covered the squash halves with plastic wrap and cooked them individually in the microwave for 12 minutes. It turned out great! I'm really looking forward to making this again, and searching for more spaghetti squash recipes! Yummy!

I made this last night with no olives or feta (not a fan of either). Instead I used 1/2c. canned petite diced tomatoes (instead of fresh), 1c. sliced zucchini, 1/2c. sliced mushrooms, 1/8c. reduced fat greated parmesan cheese, and 1/8 c. romano cheese, and about 1T. of Kosher salt. This was amazing! A great main dish or side dish, and so colorful!

This was a really easy & tasty twist on basic spaghetti squash. My husband and I love using spaghetti squash as a substitute for regular spaghetti in italian-style dishes, but we really liked this mediterranean version. The only change i made was to saute chopped green & red bell peppers with the onions, garlic and tomatoes to make it a little more filling, then added the squash to the skillet for a few minutes to incorporate all the tastes. Then I drizzled a little extra olive oil on top right before serving. I'm eating leftovers for lunch today and I'll definitely make it again!

Tried this last night and loved it!  It lends itself to endless variation, and you just feel so light and healthy.  I just threw the squash whole in the oven.  It took ~55 minutes and was much easier to cut afterward.

Excellent, excellent ,excellent I didn't have the olives but went by the recipe otherwise. This is a true favorite dish of ours we couldn't quit eating until it was gone. My 14 year old loved it also.
Thanks for this recipe we where getting tired of the tomatoe sauces on the spaghetti squash.

Very tasty variation for spaghetti squash.  Will make again and again.  I would give this 4.5 stars if I could.  I still like a nice red sauce on my spaghetti squash better.  This is so easy to prepare! We enjoyed it very much.  By the way, I followed the recipe exactly, no variations.

Yum!  Yum! And Yum-O!!  This was my first experience with Spaghetti Squash and it was amazing thanks to this recipe.  I have changed my eating habits and gone to a more healthy and "Fresh" food selection. Since I am now keeping Carbs to a minimum, this recipe will be a regular one added to our new menu.

I followed it to the letter and thought it was delish!!!  Hubby...the Pizza, wings and Hot Pockets lover wasn't as excited as I was, but oh well...more for me!

I thought that the recipe was interesting (took out olive because I don't like olives), but I didn't LOVE it.  I think I am going tweak it a little bit more and see how I like it, but just based on the ingredients here I didn't think it was fantastic.

This was great!  I used a can of diced tomatoes (drained) instead of fresh tomatoes (didn't have enough), and added a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes that other reviewers suggested.  I also cooked the squash about 10 mins longer than called for in the recipe.  Since I was familiar of the crunchiness of the spaghetti squash, it was no problem whatsoever, and easy to scoop out.  Enjoy!

WOW!  What a surprise!  My husband and I both enjoyed it for lunch.  The squash was quite crunchy so I may try cooking it longer next time (I microwaved for about 10 minutes) but we enjoyed the crunchiness of it too!  This is my first time trying spaghetti squash and I love it!

Unfortunately, this dish did not please either me or my hubby. I think it may have been the overpowering onion flavor... if (a big IF) I ever try this again I will cut the onion in at least half. For some reason my spaghetti squash tasted alot like pumpkin. 
I also tried a different method of cooking the spaghetti squash where you put it in a baking dish with about a 1/4 inch of water and cook it for 35 minutes. My mother swears by this method and says the squash gets less "crunchy" that way. 
It's definitely something to try if you never have before. I think maybe I will try making spaghetti squash again but just putting sauce on it like spaghetti noodles. Thanks anyway though!

I let mine cool down too much before getting everyone at the table and when I had it the first time, had I rated it, I would have given it 3/4 stars.  I heated it up today to finish and off and it was SOOOOO good! I was bummed there wasn't more!

Took longer to cook; about 50 min and I probably should have cooked it a bit longer. This was the first time not only for cooking spaghetti squash, but also eating it. So, w/o having anything else to compare it to, the dish tasted good. I will make it again after I try a few other spaghetti squash recipes.

Wasn't as wowed by this recipe as I thought I'd be -- maybe I was expecting too much because of all the hype. Still, my boyfriend loved it, so who knows? I thought it could have used some more spices and another veggie (maybe some zucchini?).

I had never tried spaghetti squash, but i LOVED it! This recipe gave the squash a lot of flavor.  I used extra fresh garlic, and extra fresh basil.  I also added extra olives since we love them so much. Thanks again!

I liked it and definitely will try it again with some tweaking.  I added artichoke hearts which were perfect in this.  Could do without the onion.  I also eliminated the olive.

This was so good.  Very healthy and easy to prepare.  I followed the recipe exactly except used a sun dried tomato-basil flavored feta and burgundy olives. Delicious!  My squash took about 60 minutes to cook, but it was really big. Will make again.

Loved it, quick, easy to make and delicious.  I cooked the squash a little to long so it got mushy.  I used dried basil, canned tomatoes (and it was still good)and sprinkled fresh parsley on top.

Easy to make and very good. I used dry black olives and pitted them, they are richer and saltier than regular black olives so they really added a punch. I'll make this again for sure.

My husband came home with a GIANT spaghetti squash, so I only used half of it in this recipe (and could have used even less than that).  This is a great mixture of flavors, and I served it with wheat "Easiest Focaccia Recipe" bread from this site.  My suggestion is to be sure and eat it while it's hot.. I didn't like it much after it got cold.  Also, I'd like a little more body so next time (or even with leftovers tomorrow) I'll do as others have done and toss spinach or other vegetables in the mix.  Now... what to do with the other half of the beast!?

I thought this was delicious. I did take another reviewer's suggestion and added some mushrooms and white wine. Would definitely make again.

I've never had spaghetti squash and decided to be brave and "try" it after reviewing this recipe and it's reviews.

The verdict?

I absolutely loved it!  I'm a true kitchen klutz but the recipe was very easy.  I added extra olives and it was truly delicious.

It's been deemed a "family favourite" and I'll be making it again next week!

This is a really good recipe, I wasn't sure I would like it, but it is yummy.  My only complaint is I think the cooking time needs to be increased, as well as the temperature.  Depending on the size of the squash, 45 minutes to an hour at 400 to 450.

This was quite amazing.  This was my first time having spaghetti squash and I found I really enjoyed the crunchy texture and am so excited to experiment further.  I did not use tomatoes but instead added avocado, green pepper and artichoke hearts...salt and pepper to taste.  My taste buds are satisfied!  Thanks!

I made this with a few substitutions. For vegetables, I used onion, red pepper, mushrooms, and sun-dried tomatoes. I added some soy "chicken" and parsley and thyme. Worked great!

Great side dish. As another reviewer suggested, I paired this with the Broiled Parmesan Tilapia recipe from this site and both turned out fabulous!! They are delicious together and make a great low calorie, unique dish sure to impress anyone! You MUST try this great recipe--you won't regret it! UPDATE: this recipe is also wonderful with pasta.

Very good!  Easy to make.  To speed it up when short on time, I put it in the microwave cut side down in a pie plate, covered w/ cellophane for 12-15 min.  For the meat lover in the family, I make keilbasa on the side for this dish.

This was my first experience with spaghetti squash.  On advice from previous reviewers, I added green peppers, more garlic and feta, changed the black olives to kalamata and used a can of tomatoes already flavored with basil.  It was delish!!!!

Very yummy - and so healthy for you.  I used kalamata olives packed in oil instead of black olives, and left out the olive oil.  Next time I will add more tomatoes.

This was amazing!  For a quicker recipe, I microwaved the squash with a little butter for 12 minutes instead of baking.  And then followed the directions.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe.  Next time I will use olive oil instead of veg. oil.  I didn't have fresh basil, and forgot to put in dried basil, but it was still fab.  I will definitely put in the basil next time.  I put in a little extra feta cheese since I crumbled too much, and it tasted great!  It's a keeper!!!

I gave this 4 stars because I liked it but my husband didn't.  He thought the feta  drowned out the flavor of the squash.  Needed to cook it almost twice as long as stated. It is easy though.

So good! I have made this recipe numerous times. The only suggestion that I have it to add a little less onion. I also add some spaghetti sauce from the store to mix up the flavor a bit! I am always asked for the recipe. Also, once I added shredded chicken to get a little meat in there, and that was good too!

This is delicious.  My family really enjoyed it.  I used 2 cans of organic Muri Glen fire roasted diced tomatoes.  No need to fool with fresh.  I also did not have fresh basil.  I used 1 Tablespoon of dried.

I followed the recipe to a T, and this turned out quite well. The mister loved it. We never had spaghetti squash before and had a heck of a time just splitting it in half. (If you're wondering, what we did was take a heavy chef's knife and used a mallet to penetrate the thick rind.) I don't know if the squash was cooked to perfection, either. Ours was still a bit on the crunchy side. But overall, I'd make this again. :-)

I made this with chopped spinach, feta cheese, garlic and a little olive oil. Delicious. A large squash takes more like an hour to bake.

I was tired of my old spaghetti squash recipe so I decided to try this one. It turned out to be excellent. Great flavor and not a lot of work. I used drained canned tomatoes and parmesan cheese. I let the parmesan cheese get all crusty under the broiler before I served it and it was great. This dish is easy to change to whatever ingredients you have at hand.

AWESOME!  We tweaked this recipe just a little to better suit our preferences - We added chicken, omitted the olives, and substituted mozzarella cheese and dried basil.  This dish was even better reheated for lunch the next day!  Thanks, James, for a delicious recipe!

Wow, I never would have thought there could be such a delicious, healthy alternative to traditional spaghetti!  The only things I did differently were use olive oil, leave out the olives, use canned tomatoes and bake the squash for about 45-50 minutes.

My roommate made this for supper the other night and I went back for three helpings!  It was my first time trying spaghetti squash and this recipe made it a great experience.  The rommie didn’t add the onions or olives (because we didn’t have them one hand) but it still was wonderful.  Add a little more salt and don’t skip the freshly grated Parmesan!  I can’t wait to try it again.

I'm sorry to be the one to spoil the party on this one, but I thought it was terrible.  I was so looking forward to making this, it sounded good.  Although I like feta cheese, tomatoes, basil, garlic, and squash, when mixed together really turned me off, sorry:(

This was terrific! I have been trying to incorporate more veggies in my diet and have been re-trying ones I didn't like as a kid. I was pleasantly surprised that I loved this dish. I made a couple on minor alterations. One, I left off the olives since I don't care for them. And I used a flavored feta cheese... sun dried tomato and basil. Yum. I just cooked another squash last night, so am planning on having this again today.

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  It is very good, and most of all, very healthy.  Not being a vegetable fan, I'm always searching for tasty ways of preparing vegetables and this is one I use a lot.  The only changes I made were using olive oil instead of vegetable, and sometimes I use garlic and herb flavored feta cheese.

By mistake, I added black olives stuffed with jalapeno peppers.  It added just the right amount of "zing" to the dish.  I will definitely make this recipe again and again.

Kids didn't like the way it looked but said it tasted "OK".  A little bland.  I had to salt it up pretty good.  An interesting change of pace.  I never had tried speghetti squash before.  You need an axe to cut the things in half to bake!!!!

WOW!  Since I never had spaghetti squash before I wasn't sure what the outcome would be.  But we loved it.  I can't wait to make it for friends and family.  I threw in some zucchini and some cooked diced ham and also used canned diced tomatoes.  The feta cheese was a nice alternative to the usual Italian cheeses. Its fast, simple and delicious.  What more can you ask for.  Make it tonight.

Enjoyed this dish immensely.  Instead of scraping the 'spaghetti' noodles from the squash, I left the squash intact.  I added real cooked spaghetti noodles (to make it more kid friendly) to the tomato/feta sauce, then served it inside the squash.  It was a hit with everyone -especially the kids!

I will definitely make this again, maybe with more tomatoes.  I was a little surprised that the squash "noodles" was crunchy, but overall it was quite good.

We loved this.  I sauted red onion, green pepper, zucchini, and cherry tomatos in olive oil and a couple tablespoons of dry sherry.  I tossed with klamata olives and fetta.  Next time, I will drain off any excess juices from the veggies so it won't be quite so mushy.

Very tasty. I used olive oil in place of vegetable oil. Omitted the black olive. Increased garlic & added mushrooms, orange diced pepper. You could actually add whatever veggies you had hanging around.

I used leftover roasted spaghetti squash and only had goat cheese, red onion and green olives, but it was still wonderful! Topped with green onion and toasted sunflower seeds, because they needed to be used.  I melted a bit of butter (no added salt) in the squash mix before serving for richness....went beautifully with salmon!  Thank you for sharing!

I couldn't get black olives so bought Manzanilla olives, minced pimento and capers.  The spaghetti squash I cooked yesterday and scooped out and placed in a Ziploc bag.  We had with cooked ham and fried eggs.  A bit of a mish-mash but delicious all the same.

This recipe is so easy and amazing! This is the first time I cooked spaghetti squash.  Cutting it is half is quite the workout!  Scooping it out is the most amazing visual experience.  I had to call my husband into the kitchen to check it out. I took the dish to a Christmas get together with my husbands family. The dish was a hit! Everyone loved it! I have leftovers since I did not realize how much squash came out. I will grill some chicken and put the chicken and spaghetti squash in containers to freeze them for dinners for my husband to eat at work and me at home. This one is a keeper!

Just wanted to add this note from another review for myself:  I wanted to add a P.S. to my rating. The next day I added some beaten egg and bread crumbs to the leftovers to add substance. I formed the squash into round patties and breaded them with bread crumbs. I then browned them in Canola oil and they were sooooo delicious. My boyfriend loves this recipe and he loved what I did with the leftovers too.

I cooked the squash a little longer than 40 minutes. Feta cheese  was a tomato and basil cheese. I added another clove of garlic. This is a great recipe and will make again!

A fantastic change for my go to spaghetti squash recipe.  Loved the Mediterranean flavors with the simplicity of the squash.  Wonderful served warm but leftovers for lunch the next day were delicious cold too!

I would never expect a Mediterranean flavor from a spaghetti squash! This was delicious! I used a leftover half squash from another recipe. It was cooked in a microwave, but unfortunately it was a little overcooked so this dish was a slightly mushy but still very good! I reheated the squash strands and added them to the saute pan with the onions, garlic and tomatoes and topped the serving dish with feta cheese. I used kalamata olives and dried basil (fresh plants long gone) and lightly salted. Great recipe, Bob!

I added crumbled bacon and chopped artichoke hearts only because they were left overs that needed to be used.  It was amazing! I also think it'd be good with kalamata olives.

This recipe is a great variation for spaghetti squash. I baked it cut side up after brushing with olive oil, this gives the squash a deeper flavor. I sautéed chopped onion and garlic, then added cherry tomatoes. We are not feta fans, so I left out the cheese.  This recipe could also be prepared with other cheeses, and other vegetables such as sautéed peppers.

It's super flavorful! I wasnt sure how it was going to be with the black olives but they made this dish. Also I didnt have feta cheese, and I'm not a huge fan of it so instead  I used shredded parmesan and it was delicious!!!  It's so good I keep making it. But instead of shredded parmesan tonight I'm using shredded  mozzarella yumm

I had some kalamata & green olives on hand so I used them in place of the black olives.  I thought it added a nice flavor in combo with the feta.

Substituted string mozzarella for goat cheese. No black olives. Didn't mince garlic fine enough.  We like strong garlic and didn't mind it, though.  Added Prego Farmers Market Classic Marinara separate on dish and used Cherubs tomatoes cut in half. 
The main dish quickly turned into the ONLY dish and thought it was great.  First time to cook spaghetti squash and will definitely use this again!

I found a huge spaghetti squash at the store, and because I was feeding 9 the next day, had to have it!  This recipe, with minor tweaks for ingredient portions, and personal choice for additional ingredients, was a hit.  Skipped the meat and served as a side to Marsala Pork Chops.  Golden.

Delicious!  I prefer to microwave my squash as it tastes the same as baked but is easier and faster.  To Maralina who gave it a low rating ONLY because the squash wasn't baked HER way, I have nothing nice to say.

It wasn't anything I was crazy over.  I wound up adding in garlic power and more tomatoes to give it more flavor.

This was simply awesome.  I just didn't have the olives which only would have made it better.  I loved it.  Very easy and loved the crunch of the squash.  Hubby tried it and he enjoyed it too.  I cooked it in a pan with a bit of water in it.  I cut it in half and cooked it at suggested temp.  It worked just fine!

Loved this. I added more olives (an entire small can) and a bit more parsley. This is delicious and no salt was needed. My picky little sister loved it.

I made the sauce earlier in the day to let the flavors meld. I will definitely make this again, it's the best spaghetti squash recipe I've had.

I thought this was super good!! I read in another review to cook the squash whole with holes poked in it at 375 for an hour, that’s what I did! It turned out really well! I think next time I will add some baby Bella’s

It was our first time with spaghetti squash, and it was so easy. My husband and I both went back for seconds and took leftovers to work. I added considerably more garlic--a head of garlic instead of a clove, and we added garlic salt to taste in our own bowls. As inexperienced spaghetti squashers, our gourd was not quite ripe, and it took over an hour to cook, but it still came out great.

This is a nice, flavorful, and healthy dish without tasting like something is left out.  The onions are a little sweet, the feta a little pungent, and it's a nice combination.  I microwave the squash, but it doesn't matter how you cook it as long as it's tender.  Quick and delicious.  (I liked mine with herbed olive oil bread dip in place of the plain olive oil for a little extra flavor.  That recipe is also on this website.)

Yummy alternative to pasta! I followed the recipe except that I added a little bell pepper I had and I cooked the spaghetti squash at 360 for 45 minutes. I'm happy with the result and looking forward to pair it with chicken or steak. :)

I added fresh parmesan, instead of feta and left the olives out. I also cooked the basil in the  onion tomato mix. I  love to soften and release the sweetness of the basil  I also added some lemon pepper seasoning. Everybody loved it. Thanks for the ideas! It was everything we has fresh in the garden.

This dish is really good. Very flavorful and quite the hit with my husband too. Downgrading the rating for the cook time instructions. I had a small squash and it took almost an hour to cook. Everything else is spot on.

I loved this recipe and the only change made was to use some shaved Parmesan cheese since I didn’t have enough feta.

I didn't measure everything exactly so I added a few too many tomatoes to mine, but it was really great! Loved the fresh basil, and I normally hate olives but I added them and actually liked it! It's also very easy for someone who doesn't cook very much, or doesn't make complicated dishes (like myself). I would recommend this dish!

I made this as written except threw in a mild jalapeno I  needed to get rid of.  My husband and son really liked it as did I.  I'll definitely make this again.  It's a good, healthy meatless meal.

Easy to make. Recipe was simple to follow and tasted very good. Cooked on the same sheet as Chicken Cordon Blue and timing was perfect. Will be a staple in our house.

This was really good! I did use kalamata olives instead of black and sauteed spinach with the onions as one reviewer suggested. Will be making this again, but it says 147 calories per serving, how big is a serving??

this dish was delicious as well as quick and simple to execute.   i regret that i didn't include the basil,  since my stash wasn't the freshest and i didn't want to ruin an otherwise great mix of ingredients with wilted basil.  but i just know that with it,  it would have been even better. i excluded the olives because we don't really care for them.  otherwise stuck to the recipe.  thank you so much for this great recipe.

Initially following the recipe as-is, I found it  rather bland. Adding some salt definitely made it better. Also, my boyfriend enjoyed it. Overall, it was a good healthy veggie option, but all of the prep work that went into making it, I'm not sure it was worth it. If I make again, especially for all of the necessary prep work, I would definitely have to make a few revisions for flavor.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made only a few changes. I added olive oil with herbs when cooking the squash. I also drizzled some balsamic vinegar over the dish before eating. Simple and delicious.

Loved this recipe thank you for sharing!

Excellent dish.  I did substitute plain Feta for a Garlic/Herb Feta, but only because of personal taste.  The blending of flavors made for the perfect touch with the broiled fish I accompanied with it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe...I'll be making it often!

This recipe has changed my opinion of spaghetti squash.  My entire family loved it!  Next time I will try ricotta salada rather then the feta.  I also didn't add the pine nuts and I didn't feel as if it were missing any flavor.  Heated up nicely the next day for lunch as well.

I used a can of diced tomato with the juices poured off (but not fully drained) instead of the chopped tomatoes (it's winter) and added just a titch of oregano. Fabulous! My husband asked me to teach him how to make this one so he could do it when I'm away!

Overall it was just okay, but not great. Followed recipe as instructed with the addition of a few sun-dried tomatoes I had on hand. Just did not seem to have a whole lot of flavor. Next time I may try it with blackened chicken strips (squash as base layer, with blackened chicken on top, covered by onion, olive and tomato mixture).

I am new to cooking so my star rating is only based on my lack of cooking skills :).  

Recipe called for cooking squash "until a sharp knife can be inserted with only a little resistance" it was definitely el dante so I would cook longer to match my taste buds.

I also had a pretty large squash so I should have increased the other ingredients to account for it.

All and all, I would try to improve on my experience and do it again.

The only thing I did different was add a small zucchini which I grated into the onion mixture and 1 T of sun-dried tomatoes just to give it a little more boost of flavor.  Overall very fun recipe next time I may add sliced Jalapeño to spice it up!

The flavors were just great!  I didn't cook the squash per the recipe...I microwaved the whole squash for 10 minutes, then cut in half, scooped out the seeds and microwaved each half another couple of minutes (it was a large squash).  After scooping the squash into a large bowl, I added a little butter and salt.  While it was cooking, I made the vegetable mixture in a skillet.  I served it with the vegetables on top sprinkled with Parmesan (all I had...next time I will try the feta! ) I also added some chopped red and yellow pepper and some celery to the vegetables...and a dash of pepper sauce.  It was pretty and yummy!

This was easy and delicious.  It was my first time cooking spaghetti squash, so I will continue to experiment with them. Using baked squash instead of pasta sounds crazy, but this is a great treat!  I followed the recipe and used half a large yellow onion, canned diced tomatoes (14oz - with onion and garlic), a few frozen cubes of garlic and basil, and was generous with black olives and feta.  My omnivorous H and I both enjoyed it very much.

This was my very first time making spaghetti squash, and I loved it. My 15 month old didn’t like it at first, but I added some spaghetti sauce on hers, and she enjoyed it!

Very good, served with Chicken Breasts! The only modification I made was to season the squash with olive oil, salt and pepper when roasting it in the oven. My husband and I both enjoyed and will definitely make this dish again!

This was really good! Even my husband, who usually doesn't care for squash, was pleasantly surprised. I just sauteed some mushrooms with the onion and garlic and added a little crushed red pepper at the end. The fresh basil really makes the dish.

I was not a big fan of this. I must say right up front that I am just experimenting with spaghetti squash for the first time these past couple of weeks. This recipe looked different  from some others so I thought it might be worth a try.  I made it exactly as written except that I added some cut up zucchini and sauteed it with the onion/garlic mixture, as I had seen another reviewer mention. It was okay, but didn't have a lot of flavor. It may be the spaghetti squash itself that I don't really like, as it kind of stood out. So, for others who already like spaghetti squash  this might  be a great recipe, but I doubt I will try it again.

I followed the recipe pretty close. The only exceptions were I microwaved the squash to cook it & I added pesto when blending in the Feta & olives. This gave the dish a bit more flavor. The Feta adds good flavor. We will use this recipe again.

A huge hit...  Actually surprised at how yummy this dish was going to turn out... I followed directions except cooked squash in my instant pot for 10 minutes... So this was a 10 minute meal from start to finish.. I will be making this recipe again soon.

I've made this twice so far, and enjoyed it both times. The second time I coooked the squash  in the microwave instead of the oven to speed up the process.   I fed this to my significant other who had said he couldn't stand squash, but it was his first time trying spaghetti squash and he loved it.

Yummy! I substituted mushrooms for the olives and put less garlic in than the recipe called for. The feta cheese really made the dish! The only thing I'd change is, it seemed to cool down pretty fast. Once I stirred in all the ingredients, the squash cooled down a lot. I love pipping hot meals but that's just me. Definitely happy I tried this new veggie. 95% perfect! ??

We made this with canned no salt added cut tomatoes added mushrooms, yellow bell pepper, and zucchini.  My wife and I both added a sprinkle of turmeric to our individual dishes and we both liked that as well.    Oh, the way we cook the spaghetti squash is to cut it into rings, clean out the seeds lightly oil the cookie sheet and bake at 350 for 30 minutes then I flipped them over for another 10.    I sauteed all the vegies first and added no salt at any time.  The most sodium came from the olives.  Do they make lower sodium olives??  This recipe s a definite keeper/  Thank you.

I added kalmata olives instead of black olives, and I carmelized the onion, garlic, and tomato mixture before mixing it in with the squash.  Delicious, and pretty quick and easy to make!

Very Versatile base.. I made the base w/ a tad bit less onion --since my husband doesn't like strong onion flavors...  My husband added chicken for some protein to his bowl (I added spinach and Rotel diced tomatoes to the garlic onion mix).  I didn't use the microwave suggestion, as I did other things while the Squash baked.  I did bake it longer than 30 minutes (I did 45 minutes..I think it depends on your elevation, the size of your squash etc..  it's very simple to take it out and put a fork in it .. if it's NOT to your aldente taste, put it back in until it is!)--This was fantastic tasting to us.. We LOVED that we were eating a healthy meal w/ no preservatives or hydrogenated stuff..mostly ingredients from our garden (except the FETA). We have saved this recipe, and will definitely make it again.. Thank you!

The two-star rating I gave applies to the recipe as written.  My husband and I both had the sense that something was missing.  I think this is mostly--although not entirely--a function of the lightness of the spaghetti squash.

I squeezed half a lemon over the squash to make it tangier, used chunky Ragu spaghetti sauce (the garden vegetable one) in lieu of the tomatoes and basil, and substituted mozzarella for the feta, which seemed too strong of a cheese for such a mildly flavored squash. Also added about a half cup of diced zucchini when I sauteed the onion and garlic. I omitted the olives. I grated the mozzarella on top after I scooped everything back into the hollowed out zucchini shells, then put it back in the oven until the cheese melted.

Not a fan of using spaghetti squash as a substitute for pasta, but I LOVE this dish.  The saltiness of the olives and feta bring out the sweetness of the squash.  Note:  It takes a lot longer to cook the squash than the recipe indicates.  I cooked mine at 350 for 30 minutes, then increased the heat to 400 and cooked another 30.   Others suggest cooking the squash whole, with some "vents" cut into it.  I will do that next time.   I could have eaten the entire thing!

It was lacking in flavor.  As I was eating it I was thinking it needed a few strips of lamb to give it better taste.  

And yes, the squash needs to be cooked longer than directed in recipe.

I added olive oil, garlic salt, salt, and pepper to the squash halves before baking them to add some seasoning.  I have never had spaghetti squash before and wow this reciepe is so tasty. I also added red, yellow and purple peppers as well as red onion in place of the olives and tomato.  Super yummy!

It was okay. I didn't like the crunchy "spaghetti noodles" but maybe with time I could get used to it. Flavors were nice. I would change it next time - no olives, add salt, pepper and garlic. My squash needed more time in the oven, I added 15 more minutes and felt it could've used more, but I was getting impatient. Cutting the squash also dried it out :(

I can't do traditional noodles anymore and heard about this great healthy alternative. It can get a bit watery, but the flavor and gentle crunchy texture is divine.

What a great main dish or side!  It's so easy to make and very healthy.  I cooked the squash on a baking stone and added 5 minutes to the bake time and it was perfect.  I substituted olive oil, added chopped green peppers and sautéed them with the onions.  I used the rest of the ingredients in the recipe except I left off the olives and basil.  I just added salt, pepper and cayenne to taste.  It was wonderful.  I just wish there had been some leftovers to take to work for my lunch the next day.  I will definitely make this again.

I loved this! I've been a member here for a couple of years but this is the 1st time writing a review, this was so good I felt I had to sign in & rate. This dish was lite but tasted fattening. One small change is that I used green olives ( didn't have any black ones).

My spaghetti squash was large around 5 lbs. It took 60 minutes to bake. I wish the recipe stated the size of the squash since I could have easily doubled the tomato onion mixture. I will make this again, but doubled.

Solid overall, however the squash was not cooked through enough - definitely needs to be cooked at 375 for an hour to make this work.

This turned out pretty good, and it helped me use some ingredients from our CSA box. The cheese and olives helped relieve the blandness that can be associated with spaghetti squash. This is a winner!

I added 3 more cloves of garlic; don't overcook spaghetti squash; for smaller ones I cook at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.

This is a wonderful dish.  We loved that the squash still had a nice texture and the flavor is great. We added crumbled venison and fresh grated mozzarella cheese on top of our dish.

This  recipe was phenomenal!  The only change I made was to microwave the squash after I cut it down the middle, and then I skipped the chopped tomatoes, instead using grape tomatoes.  I left the cheese on the side so that my husband could choose to use Romano cheese and I could use the feta cheese. I will definitely use this recipe again! I cooked 4 spaghetti squash, and used sweet Vidalia onions.  We will be reheating this dish for several days  and alternating toppings, such as fresh jalapeño salsa.  I  prepared this dish with chicken thighs marinated  overnight in olive oil and chopped garlic cloves.  Delicious!  we will definitely cook this again!

The only thing I did differently is follow someones suggestion to poke hole in the squash and throw it in a baking pan for an hour at 375.

I LOVED this recipe and will be making it many more times.

You can cook the spaghetti squash, whole, in a microwave, just stab it in 2 places with a knife and set the microwave for 15-20 minutes once it is done let it set in the microwave about 5 minutes more and it is very soft.  All you have to do is cut it open and scoop the seeds out and then scoop the squash out of the shell.  Be careful it is very hot.

Will make it again for sure!  It was the first time I made spaghetti squash and so surprised how easy it actually was.  Of course it depends on the size for cooking time.... So as the author wrote... Check with a knife at about 30 min. In.  Next time I think .i will add zucchini and sauté cherry tomatoes slightly with a can of chopped tomatoes.  My husband and both kids loved it!

Delicious!!  A big hit with my family as well.  I would recommend what another reviewer suggested and that is bake the squash whole for approx one hour and then let it really cool down before taking the "noodles" out.    I keep getting requests to make it again!!

Pretty good recipe. My husband loved it, I'm not a big fan of cold dishes. Cutting a raw squash was not easy, I would definitely recommend looking up some tips before doing it.

I thought the squash was way too crunchy, even though I baked it for 45 minutes. Also with no spices, I thought the proportions were a little off (too much squash) - there would be some bites with only squash, and that would taste very bland.

I have a vegetarian and meat lovers household and this is a winner for everyone.  I've made it several times and it is always gone in a flash.  I agree with all of the comments about adding water and cooking the spaghetti squash upside down--just make sure a knife comes out cleanly and easily and it is done!  Adjust the ingredients per your tastes--we love the fresh basil and feta especially.  I think salt and pepper and essential in this recipe too, but right before you serve it so the flavors don't dissipate.  You'll love this! :-)

Not bad but I found the tomato overpowered most of the flavour. Olives and feta was nice. I think I will just stick with butter and parmesan from now on though.

This was fantastic! I loved the flavors, although I didn't have the olives. We also sauteed shrimp and tossed them in, though it REALLY didn't need it. 
I would suggest cooking the squash longer our raising the oven temp to 375. Not a deal breaker.

This dish is magical. Excellent beyond excellent. The only thing I did differently is that I sauteed the cooked squash strings with the onion and tomato mixture for a minute or two before adding the feta and olives. This let the squash cook down a little more and blended the flavors really well.

PSA: Don't forget to salt to taste as you go along. It's not mentioned in the recipe, but it makes a big difference in taste. You might also want to throw in a half squeeze of lemon juice at the end to waken things up a little more. Aside from that, this recipe is glorious. 12/10.

FANTASTIC - really a great variation on spaghetti squash.  easy cooking, easy prep.  just be aware of the size of your squash to make sure you get your timing right for the oven portion.

AMAZING!!! Changes I made were to add some chopped mushrooms while cooking the onion, used a can of Rotel tomatoes instead of fresh chopped and topped off with toasted pine nuts.  I have no doubt it would have been amazing if you follow original recipe though.

I added red pepper for a little heat. Threw in some organic apple/chicken sausage and subbed parm for the feta. Next time I think I'll use feta per the recipe.

Really good! I did not make any changes to it at all.
Spaghetti  squash is not one of my favorites but I really liked this.

I gave it four stars (as is) but would bump it up to 5 with my changes.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I doubled the garlic and added a pinch of cayenne pepper.  Freshly ground pepper and sea salt.  Since tomatoes were out of season I added some sun dried tomatoes to the tomato mixture.  I didn't have fresh basil so I added dried to the tomato mixture and let it sit a few minutes while I prepared the other parts.   Lastly, our squash was from our garden and I suspect we picked it too late so it came out watery and didn't string up like spaghetti too well.   So, after the first night I put it in a colander over a bowl, salted and covered it.  I fried it a little in a pan to heat it up.  It took off some of the extra water and was great the next day.

AWESOME!!!!!! .... So I also added fresh spinach and a ¼-½ C chicken broth and simmered it just enough to soften the spinach and warm tomatoes. Instead of feta, I used fresh grated Pecorino Romano and then topped it all with SMOKED sea salt!!!!!! AWESOME!!!!!!! And easy

Great meal, my husband liked it too!  Will make again for sure.  I left out the olives since I didn't have any and like other reviewers, used dried basil as that's what I had.  Very inexpensive, filling and mostly, great flavor, the Feta cheese makes it!

The "noodles" were crunchy even after baking longer. I even put the squash in the pan to cook with the rest of the ingredients, hoping the moisture would soften it..

I microwaved the squash instead of baking because I wanted to make it quicker. I didn't have fresh basil, so I used Italian seasoning instead. Also used kalamata olives as other reviewers suggested. I will definitely be making this again, next time I will make sure to have fresh basil as I'm sure that'd make it even better. I can't believe how great this turned out!

This is a good recipe for low carb or diabetic diets - I've made this several times and just recently added it to my rotation since my husband has been diagnosed with diabetes.  I like to add chopped green and red peppers, fresh spinach, sliced zucchini, and sliced mushrooms. I use Italian diced tomatoes instead of the plain tomatoes and basil. Sometimes I brown a 1/2 lb. of ground turkey and add to the mixture, but this is very good without any meat. We don't even miss it when I add all the extra veggies.

Not for me or my family.  I made it using the microwave for squash.   5 min on skin side and 6 min on tender side.  The squash was done.  Added italian style tomatoes can to the veggie mix.  It added flavor, but the taste of the quash was a deal breaker for all of us

This turned out better than expected with a few modifications based on other users feedback.  Firstly to make life easier I roasted the squash whole, straight on the oven rack for one hour at 375. I used 3 garlic cloves, leek in lieu of onion and was generous with olive oil. Sautéed this then added dried basil and oregano (1to 1-1/2 tsp each)and then added halved cherry tomatoes, Kalamata olives and about a tbsp or so of capers.  I tossed this with the "shredded" spaghetti squash placed in a oven dish and covered with grated Parmesan cheese and let bake at 350 for about 15 min (basically to reheat after I let the squash cool enough to handle).  It was delicious and surprisingly filling.

I was looking for a meal  gluten free, that meets a low glycemic value as well as healthy.  My family doesn't embrace many variations of meat, potatoes or pasta with a small side of vegetables.   I chose to sauté thin sliced chicken with the tomato mixture.  What a hit!  Will definitely cook again and again!

This was so good! My spaghetti squash took longer to cook so I wish I would've accounted for that time. Otherwise, I followed the recipe except I used less oil (used olive oil) and threw in some leftover flank steak strips. It would be delicious with chicken with a little spritz of lemon. Yum!

Really liked this recipe. Maybe my tomatoes were a bit bland, but it seemed like the dish really relied on the feta cheese for flavour, so go heavy on the feta!

I made this tonight for my daughter and I and it was delicious!  I added chopped celery to the onions when I sautéed them.  I didn't have fresh basil, so I minced some fresh parsley instead and it was good.  I also added fresh mushrooms when I added the minced garlic (and I added 2 cloves instead of one).  I used green olives because I didn't have black and added them with the sliced cherry tomatoes to the sauteed veggie ingredients and covered the pan while it remain heating on low heat.  It gave the flavors a chance to blend while the spaghetti squash finished baking.  The rest of the recipe I followed and we were delighted with the blend of flavorings.  What a great low calorie - low carb dish.  I will make it again as long as I can get the squash.  I thought an addition of fresh spinach added to the veggies might be quite tasty as well.  I also appreciate the fact that this is a meatless dish so it is one that I will make on Friday nights when we forgo meat dishes.

So delicious. I'm not a lover of olives so I left those out. I cooked the squash for 45 minutes and added some water to the baking dish to make it more tender. 
I've had spaghetti squash before and love it, but this was my first time using this recipe. I made it for my roommate who's never had spaghetti squash and she devoured it. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great a recipe, I love the simplicity of it and it makes a great side for chicken. I added nothing extra, but I did eye ball all the ingredients and it turned out great.

I have made this several times and I absolutely love it! The only difference I do now are very minor... olive oil in place of vegetable oil, 4-5 roma tomatoes chopped, and a small can of sliced black olives. I dont cook te tomaties before tossi g everything, just saute the onion and garlic. I usually make it for food prep on Sundays to bring for my lunches. Makes me 4 servings at about 215 calories each. It reheats well and it's even better as a leftover once the flavors have a chance to soak all together. Yum!

I made this exactly as written, except I didn't have fresh basil, so like the other reviewer said, used a little dried.  Love this recipe...the flavors go so well together.  I'm  vegetarian and this is the perfect summer meal for me.  Very easy to make!

I got a spaghetti squash in my co-op produce box last weekend and decided to try this recipe. It is good, but not good enough to buy a special squash for.

This was a hit.  Though we always cook spaghetti squash at 400 for 30 mins..  And we added 1/2lbs Italian Sausage.

I made this as a side dish last week and it was so good we made it again a couple of days later.  The best advice I can give is don't overcook the spaghetti squash.  It should be a little crunchy.  Also, I used halved Kalamata olives instead of black because I just like them better.  I grow my own basil so that came in handy.  Also, I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used a drained can of petite diced tomatoes.  It was awesome anyways.  Lastly, I would not serve this warm, rather put it in the fridge to cool for a couple of hours and it was a great salad-like side dish.  Very refreshing and so different!

Delicious.  I did microwave the squash instead of baking.
2nd time I made it I added chopped red pepper and fresh spinach.

Success! I made a few adjustments, however. I added about a fourth cup of cooked quinoa to the mix. I also used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil just to keep it even healthier. Very filling, which is something that is hard to do with vegetarian meals. Will definitely be making again.

I have tried this recipe and it's one of my family's favorites and often requested recipes.  I put Kalamata olives instead of black olives and it gives a zingy flavor we all like.  It works with regular spaghetti too. Thank you James for posting this.

Pierced whole squashed and microwaved with water - try 15 minutes; Italian style diced tomatoes, too much feta took away healthiness so try 1/2 c. Or less

This was my first time having this kind of squash and I love it! I made the recipe as listed  however, added some zucchini squash, eggplant, butter and.cilantro. I also let the squash bake in the oven for a total of 40 mins.
I will make this a healthy staple in my house!

I used the crock pot method for the squash.  Then I cooked the onion, garlic, and tomatoes in black tea rather than olive oil to reduce calories.  My significant other was none the wiser!  This was "actually pretty good" according to him, which in my book is at least a 4 star recipe.

Great! I increased to three garlic cloves and added 1 boneless skinless chicken breast cut in very thin strips which I sauteed with the onion. Next time I'll try adding mushrooms just because we love them.

This recipe was so easy to make.  To save time I added water to the pan to help the squash soften in 30 minutes.  I also used can diced tomatoes.  I added Kale also.  It was quick and easy.

Served this at Easter dinner and have had a request for this at Christmas dinner. If someone asks for a new dish twice it must be great as we are all so fond of our traditional dishes we have served for years. I think this will become a traditional dish on our table.

Even our 3 year old ate it. Until we told her the noodles were actually vegetables. :) But it was delicious. Going in the rotation because it is healthy, whole ingredients, and easy for this busy pregnant mom of a 3 year old to make in a jif. :)
When I make spaghetti squash, I poke it a few times with a knife, cut it in half, and roast it in a baking pan, cut side down, for an hour at 400 and ours is always perfectly done and delicious.

Squash took at least 50 minutes to cook. It was something different, but nothing to write home about. I might try with different or additional veggies or maybe a different kind of cheese next time...

Wow!  This is really terrific.  The only changes I made were to add some crushed red peppers to the tomatoes and used stuffed green olives instead of black.  I'll be making this one again!!  Thank you for the great recipe.

Worth making once. My family weren't huge fans, but I really likes it.  Maybe I won't make so much next time, we had a ton of leftovers that went to waste.

I did not care for this recipe. Other than the overpowering black olives the flavor is bland, and I found the textures to be off-putting.

I was disappointed that this recipe, although containing multiple vegetables, had no depth. There was something missing completely to make a savory dish that I look forward to with spaghetti squash. This definitely needed more spices, mushrooms, and Parmesan cheese from reading past reviews.

First time I tried this, has endless possibilities when it comes to spicing it up and adding whatever veges you like. Next time I will put something spicy to add some flavour. I added mushrooms, broccoli and sweet pepper to recipe.. Divine!

This was good, but the squash did take longer than 30 minutes. I'd make it again though! But I'd give myself more time.

Excellent dish.  I added extra garlic and added it after I had warmed the tomatoes for a more intense garlic taste.  I also squeezed some fresh lemon over the top.

I followed the recipe, but I felt that the squash could have been cooked a little longer. The texture was somewhat crunchy. Next time I will try to cook it longer to see if that helps.

First time making spaghetti squash, it was delicious! Substituted Parmesan for feta and added carrots instead of black olives since that's what I had on hand. Will make again!

First time making spaghetti squash. Made exactly like recipe. Had great flavor and liked the crunchiness of our squash.  Will definitely make it again. Thanks, James for your recipe.

This was ok. You definitely need to add cook time to the squash. Even using the water in the pan trick, my squash wasn't done. :(  Would definitely up the garlic next time as well, though I doubt I'll try it again.

This was a great dish- I would double it next time, as it made only 1/2 the servings predicted. I increased the quantity of tomatoes and olives and threw in a zucchini too. I also added some balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper, and Mrs. Dash to the sauteed veggies while they cooked. Wonderful dish.

This was great! We substituted one can lyitalian style diced tomatoes and a hard chevre cheese for the feta. I also added some diced ham and sprinkled parmesan over the top. The other difference was that it took longer than 30 minutes... it took 45 minutes so plan according.

This turned out excellent. I didn't have tomatoes or fresh basil on hand so added pasta sauce in lieu of tomatoes and dried basil in lieu of fresh. Oh and I cooked the squash in the pressure cooker for one whistle and slow release much more quicker and retains more nutrients about 15 minutes total. Used a fork to remove the spaghetti strands otherwise followed the recipe as per directions  Will be making this again Thank you

Nothing special.  I love spaghetti squash, but this just tasted dry (too much feta?) and bland. Oddly, plain spaghetti squash tastes better to me.  I had high hopes, but it was just so-so.

Delicious and healthy.  For lunch the next day I added some cooked chicken.
I cook my squash at 400 degrees for about 45 mins but the time greatly depends on the size of your squash.  You should be able to easily insert a knife into the flesh.

It was surprisingly good. The only thing I had to change is, I place 1/3 cup of non dairy mozzarella cheese, because I'm lactose intolerant. Added mushrooms, but followed the rest of recipe as it is called. I will make a larger portion next time. I tried to submit my picture but It wasn't accepted. I adjusted the size and was still unable to upload . Thats ok! I wanted everyone to know it was good. The spaghetti squash was the perfect tenderness. I added water in the bottom of the pan to help with tenderness as someone here suggested. I will make it over and over!

This was excellent, very tasty. I added 2 cloves of garlic as we love it n added a zucchini which needed to be used up, I threw it in with the onions. But I followed the other directions exactly. Will b using this again.

We didn't particularly care for the flavours in this dish, even though, separately, they are all things we like. Not sure why. The only difference in what I did was in cooking the squash longer as my squash was huge. Maybe that was the problem. Thanks for posting something different to try.

I was VERY skeptical, this was my first experiment with spaghetti squash. I am not big on other squash so I wasn't quite sure about this. I was so impressed, it was so tasty with not a lot of seasoning needed. The only I changed is that I did brush the squash with olive oil and salt/cracked pepper before baking. I used yellow and brown cherry tomatoes for a deeper flavor and I also did not use olives and did not miss them. This will be a fall staple.

A great way to change up the veggie dish.  I omitted the olives as hubby doesn't care for them - it was still a lively and satisfying dish.  I will make again.

Very good! Made with drained canned basil, oregano tomatoes and fresh basil. Also used canned sliced olives. Left nothing out. Next time I will use dried basil since the fresh did not seem to add anything. My husband likes this too. In fact we had so much leftover, we both ate it all week and loved it.

This is a lovely recipe and very tweakable. I've made it several times and tonight I added 1/4 cup of veggie broth, an ounce of white wine and 2 tablespoons of riccotta cheese.Absolutely yummy however you make it. Thank you James for such a lovely recipe.  : )

I was hoping it would have a bit more flavor than it did, especially since I added salt, pepper & Italian seasoning and doubled the basil. But my hubby & all three of my meat loving sons really liked this dish, there wasn't a bite left! Next time I will add more of everything; more olives, more tomatoes, more basil, more onions, more seasoning. But we all liked it & I will be making it again. Oh, I baked my squash for 45 minutes in the oven & then finished it off in the microwave for 10 minutes. 30 minutes is NOT enough.

I bought a spaghetti squash and wasn't quite sure what to do with it-- I came across this recipe and it turned out great. I have made it several times now and wouldn't make any changes to the recipe. It did take about 50 minutes for the squash to actually be tender enough, so I would just recommend following the recipe's tip about checking it with a knife to make sure it is done.

Amazing meal! I had a medium sized squash and it baked really well in the 30 minutes suggested. A new way to eat a Greek "salad!"

Very good.  I made some changes and additions. Added mushrooms, green peppers, and sun-dried tomatoes to the veggie saute.  I seasoned that with Adobo and Herbes de Province.  Substituted Kalamata for black olives. I added half the Feta to the veggie mix to melt some, then used the rest in the final toss.  Topped each serving with shredded mozzarella, some salt and ground pepper.  You could do a lot of different things with this.  It is a good way to get more veggies into your family.

I wasn't a fan of this dish. It was very water & bland. I almost omitted the olives, because I don't much care for their strong flavor, but I'm glad I kept them in. They are about the only part of the dish with any flavor. I really wanted to like this one, but it just didn't taste like I expected. Adding garlic powder, salt, & pepper did nothing to help. I won't be making this one again.

This recipe is wonderful.  Used goat cheese instead of feta.  Didn't have any fresh tomatoes so I drained some  good quality can tomatoes (Hunt's), added celery, fresh parsley and cilantro.  Awesome

This was so good.  My husband, who dislikes all squash, said that we could add this to our regular rotation!  Even the 15 year old loved it and had extra servings.  The only change that we made was to omit the olives because we did not have any at home and we added red and purple bell pepper because we had them on hand and needed to use them up.  DELICIOUS!

I too modified this just a little and the result was delicious. I sautéed garlic, red pepper, leeks, mushrooms and a couple roma tomatoes in olive oil. Seasoned with a salt and pepper mixtures. Meanwhile had Spaghetti Squash in 350 degree oven for about 40 minutes. When knife easily pierced the skin I took out the squash. IT WAS PERFECT. I then put some squash in my pasta bowl with all of the yummy sautéed veggies and this became my dinner for tonight. I have so much left over that tomorrow it will be a side dish with my meatloaf. This is a great meal all by itself!! Oh I sprinkled a little parm cheese on the top before I ate it. Yummy!!

This was great! In addition to this recipe, I also added portobello mushrooms, zucchini, and spinach. And instead of the vegetable oil, I used a teaspoon of butter and a little Pinot Grigio. And, yes I had to cook the spagetti squash for 45 minutes. But it was SO good!! And very easy to make.

Wow, this is outstanding!  I had to make a few alterations because I didn't have fresh basil, tomatoes nor fresh garlic.  I sautéed a whole onion with red and yellow peppers, and a jalapeño (half of each) in olive oil.  I had tubes of Gourmet Garden basil and garlic, so I used these.  I also added some pesto and instead of black olives, I used Italian olive salad (from Jay's Market Place from St. Pete, FL). I used a can of Hunt's tomatoes with green peppers and celery(drained).  It is good without the cheese, but i wanted to test it with Parmesan, and then with Alfredo Sauce.  Both variations are really good.  I will pick up some Feta and try that also.  OK, after reading through this, I realized the only ingredients I did have are the spaghetti squash and onion!  I will DEFINITELY make this again, and again.

Delicious! I added a liberal amount of pepper and a pinch or two of herbs de provence to the onions and cooked down the tomatoes more than the recipe called for. Also added quartered artichoke hearts and sliced chicken sausages. everybody ate it up, even the squash-skeptics.
Other reviewers were right that the squash takes way longer, though. Next time I'll either try microwaving it or just account for it taking an hour or so instead of 30 minutes.

This is soooo good. I added the water to the baking dish for the squash, and it was perfect. I also added diced baked balsamic marinated chicken I cooked right before the squash and kept it warm. With the addition of diced artichoke hearts this dish got ten times better. My two year old even loved it!

Loved this recipe. I did make some minor changes though. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and drizzle it on the cut side of the squash with some salt and pepper and roasted on the BBQ. I also used the olive oil to saute panchetta with the onion (red) and garlic. I omitted the olives as I didn't have any and used grape tomatoes cut in half. My whole family loved it.

This was my first time trying spaghetti squash and it turned out absolutely wonderful. I changed the recipe a little bit by adding red pepper and Italian seasoning to the veggies and so added about a cup of water( this made it a little more saucey! Also added a little salt to the pasta and the squash stayed in the oven for almost an hour! This was an awesome healthy alternative

I was so pleased with this dish!  It reminded me of a pasta dish I love, but the squash substitute makes it so much healthier.  I'll be cooking this again soon.

This was fabulous! I wasn't sure whether I would like it (I'm not always a fan of squash), but the squash had a nice light taste and its texture was great with the added ingredients.  The recipe was also quite easy to whip together and budget-friendly,  which is always a plus. Thanks for sharing!

Good basic recipe. I didn't use tomatoes--thought it would be too soupy. I didn't have olives. I did use red peppers.

This recipe is great, although I substituted the fresh diced tomatoes for canned tomatoes, and added a can of tomato sauce for added flavor.

This is an amazing spaghetti squash recipe! Seriously, MAKE THIS DISH! You won't regret it. But I agree with some of the other comments, it takes a lot longer then 30 minutes to bake the squash. We baked ours (it was a large squash) for over an hour.

The only way I had ever eaten spaghetti squash was with spaghetti sauce. This recipe has been on my list to make for awhile now and seeing that it was a Myplate recipe it moved to the top of that list. All I can say is YUM! I am so glad I tried this and am wondering what took me so long. All the ingredients went well together and has a wonderful flavor! If you don't have feta cheese I think Parmesan would be a great substitute. I think the addition of some grilled shrimp would be great too! This will be in my regular rotation, especially for a light healthy lunch option. Thanks for a keeper.

This was my first attempt at making spaghetti squash (and only my second time eating it) and I wasn't really sure what to expect, but my husband and I loved it!  I've already added the ingredients to our shopping list to make it again next week.  My squash took a little longer to bake, but only about 5 minutes.  I had to omit the tomatoes and the olives, but it was still delicious.  I added the ingredients gradually and tried it after each addition.  With the onions and garlic, it was good.  With the feta, it was even better.  But once I added the fresh basil, it brought it over the top!  Thanks for a great recipe!

TRY IT!My first attempt to make spag squash, and it couldn't have been easier!  I followed directions including baking squash on cookie sheet instead of giving into other advice to microwave or cook in a pyrex dish.  The ingredient substitutes I made were 1)greasing the cookie sheet with a little dab of coconut oil instead of veg oil, and 2) I used fresh parmeson instead of feta.  It was a little "crunchy", but whole family (including 15 year old boys) said they liked the texture!!  Stayed true to everything else.  Fam wants it to stay on rotation; yeah!  I served it with the 3 Packet Roast which is ALWAYS AWESOME  and green beans.  Happy, Happy, Happy!!!

Loved this! I had green stuffed olives but they added a bit of zing. Also increased the garlic to 4 cloves just because I love it. I will be making this my go-to spaghetti squash recipe from now on.Garnished with red pepper flakes....so yummy and simple to prepare.

A little watery. It would be a good idea to strain the spaghetti squash after cooking to thicken the "sauce" and flavours.

My husband & I had never had spaghetti squash & while I like squash he is not a huge fan.  We loved it!  I did make some changes based on our preferences and what we had in the fridge.  I left out the olives and feta but added shrimp & shredded mozzarella.  I also sauted the onion & garlic in a pat of butter, olive oil and lemon juice.  Delicious!  We will definitely be making again!!

I made this recipe with green olives bc I don't like black olives and it was good. The squash needs more time to cook though. It was not done in 30 minutes, more like 45 min I would say and I raised the temp of the oven to 375.

This recipe is wonderful. I thought the sauce was a tad bland so I added mushrooms to the stir fry and extra tomato to make the sauce juicier. 30 minutes was more than enough time for the squash to get soft. Very easy and fun to make! This will definitely be a regular meal!

This was very tasty and easy to make.  I made it just for me, so there were a lot of leftovers.  The leftovers are not as good as when it is freshly made.  Make it for a family -- not just one person.

Add me to the list of people who tried the recipe pretty much as is and really liked it. Add my husband ( the non-squash eater) to the list of people who liked it too. OK, I did shake some adobo seasoning from Frontier on it to enrich the flavor, but I use that like some folks use salt and pepper. Baking the whole, pricked squash first for 45 minutes made it very easy to cut and cooked it to perfection. This recipe and variations of it will become a winter regular from my kitchen! Thanks so much!

This was absolutely delicious! I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, which was the only alteration I made. The dish was so flavorful and satisfying.  Definitely will be making this again.

Just made this dish -- definitely a keeper. Easy and fast to make, and healthy. Big compliments from fussy, meat-loving partner. I didn't have basil on hand but substituted cilantro. I also used kalamata olives in place of black olives. Had non-fat feta cheese on hand -- helped reduce the calories.

My family loved this. I sliced the squash in half, de-seeded and put a tsp of coconut oil in the center. Lightly salted and peppered then covered with tinfoil and baked at 250 for about 3-4 hours and it shredded beautifully. The only thing I didn't add was the tomatoes as I didn't have any. It was delicious.

Good but not outstanding.  I sprayed my pan with Pam instead of using oil.  Omitted the olives- don't like them.  I sprinkled my squash with salt pepper garlic powder and basil before baking.  Might make again but would need to add somthing..... not sure what this is missing- maybe more of a tomato based sauce......?  Anyway, used fat free feta and it was a nice addition- a nice change from parmesan.

Nice recipe.  I cooked the spaghetti squash in the microwave as Joann74 suggested and it turned out perfectly.  The squash should be slightly crunchy.  I have overcooked it to a mushy state -- not good.  I added the Feta to the sauce because I wanted it to melt a bit.

I would have been happy just to have the squash!  Who needed the pork chop tonight? Followed the recipe exactly except used dried basil and no olives. :-P  I only had about half the feta cheese called for and I know it would have benefitted from it. (Since feta is so salty and I didn't have enough, I needed to add more kosher salt than the recipe called for). Can hardly WAIT to try this again. Really super. My whole family enjoyed it very much!

Really tasty! Don't skimp on the feta cheese, and add a little salt and pepper to taste to finish it off.

So, I've really been trying to cook healthier for me and my daughter. I picked up a spaghetti squash at the grocery, but have never had or made it before. I found this recipe, and it seemed pretty easy. I didn't have all of the ingred. I pan fried the garlic, some green pepper, onion powder in olive oil. When it was done, I added some tomato slices to heat up. I put just a little butter on the squash and tossed it. I then put the rest of it on, and tossed. I then sprinkled some pepper and parm. cheese on top. OMG! It was soooo good! This is going to become a regular on my menu!

Love this recipe! The hardest part with spaghetti squash that no one seems to mention is how to cut it - it is harder than you might imagine. I broke this down on my blog http://www.thefitgirlskitchen.com/2013/01/spaghetti-squash-with-feta-roasted.html 

I add baked shrimp to mine too - my husband says I can make it for him every week!

This was great, next time I will try the recommendation to put a little water in the dish while it bakes in the oven to help soften the spaghetti squash up. Honestly the hardest parts were cutting the squash in half (it was harder than it looked! don't know if I got an extra firm one or what) and it was a little tedious to pick the seeds out after it cooked, mostly because the topping part was ready so I was ready to start eating! I will make this again, it's very healthy and I felt just as satisfied had I ate regular spaghetti. I also didn't add oil to the topping to save extra calories. Also, I felt like the recipe really made more like 4 servings.

Loved this recipe. It was even better as leftovers. We added a cup so of marinara when we reheated it and it was fantastic. We also added an extra cup or so of feta cheese which gave it a better flavor.

Easy and delish! Tip: go small on the squash - it seems to expand as you shred it.  The smallest one I could find made enough to serve 6 smallish portions.

Just made this tonight and it was excellent. The only thing I did different is that I follow the suggestion of putting the squash's in a baking dish with 1 1/2 cup of water.

This was really yummy.  We did add salt and pepper.  And, we thought of ways to make it easier - we think canned, diced tomatoes would be fine on the off season.  Great, yummy recipe!

I really liked this.  It was my first attempt at cooking/eating spaghetti squash.  Rest of my family wouldn't touch it, but that didn't surprise me.  I thought it was "the bomb!".

This was soooo good and healthy.  I made these changes.  Sauteed in olive oil spray, used kalamata olives as I had them on hand, and used goat cheese as I had it on hand also.  DELICIOUS!   I'm sure it's great the way it was presented but it worked great with substitutions also!

This dish is excellent!!!  I had never had spaghetti squash but I will have this again and again.  The only changes I made was to cook the spaghetti squash 45 minutes, add more olives (because I love them) and used 1 can of tomatoes because I do not like flavorless store bought tomatoes.  It is great as a meal or a side.  I kept going back for a forkful here and there it was so good!!!

I never had spaghetti squash before and I had some really serious doubts that I would like it. My husband made this dish with a spaghetti squash that was given to him by a fellow church member. I have to say that this dish is the BOMB!!! I absolutely love it -  and I wouldn't change a thing. Based on the nutritional values listed it is only 4 points a serving on the Weight Watchers plan - GREAT!!! This is a keeper.

I microwaved a half a squash for 15 minutes in a bowl with a half-cup of water. I used mint chutney and diced red pepper instead of feta, olives and basil. I have made up many spaghetti squash recipes, and this was spectacular.

This was a pretty good dish. I love spaghetti squash; or at least I remember eating it when I was littler and liking it a lot. Puncturing the squash before cooking was a good idea, and cooking took about 40 minutes. I liked the texture and the tomatoes, but there was something too overpowering about the flavor. It think it was because I didn't have any feta cheese, so I had to use Romano. I also omitted the olives. The squash's natural flavor would probably be accented better with the proper ingredients. Anyway, I'll try this again when I'm more prepared. Thanks!

Wow! My picky 3 year old ate two servings! I added a bunch of chopped rainbow chard and used 3 of those frozen basil cubes from Trader Joe's. YUM!!! I also skipped the olives because I didn't have any on hand but I think kalmata olives would be an awesome flavor...

Wow, this was delicious!  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Used 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1, and around 3/4 cup sliced olives instead of 3 tablespoons (we love olives!).  I only had grape tomatoes on hand which still tasted fabulous.
I was worried 30 minutes wasn't going to be long enough for the squash, so I put the two halves down in about 3/4 inch of water (in a 9X13 pan) and cooked at 350 for 45 minutes.  It was perfect!  I salted and peppered the halves before facing them down as well.  It stated it serves 6, but my 3 young children and I ate it all (probably because it was the only thing we had for dinner), and we were all stuffed!  
I will be making this again!

I did change a few things up after reading reviews...baked spaghetti squash longer, sauteed it with the onions and stuff and then at the end I stuck the whole shebang in 350 for 30 minutes.

My first time eating spaghetti squash. I love it! I added sea salt and black pepper. I did not have any olives, but next time I will definitely add them because I know they would make it even better. I also used a lot less oil, maybe one tablespoon.

Delicious! My family loves spaghetti squash, but I wanted to spruce it up. I added blanched asparagus, sautéed celery & red peppers in EVOO with garlic, onion & tomatoes.

Had never eaten or cooked spaghetti squash, so when I was given one from a friend's garden I wasn't sure what I would do with it. However, I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. I watched the video which was helpful since I was unfamiliar with the squash. Since the squash I had was quite big, we could have probably doubled the ingredients, but just went a little over the recommended amounts. We had so much, we ate this as our whole meal, and absolutely loved it! We have a new recipe to add to our repetoire. Will definitely make this one again!

Was looking for recipes to use for garden produce and this one fit the bill.  We had everything to make this except the feta and we substituted grated Parmesan and also added some fresh green chili peppers.  Delicious!!

Just added some mushrooms, spinach and jalapenos to the recipe. Ended up being awesome! I definitely recommend adding in the mushrooms, they just naturally go with the recipe.

Love this dish. I rubbed the cut halves of the squash  with olive oil and seasoned it with sea salt.  When it was done roasting it had a hint of sweetness.  Added red onions too.

This was so delicious! I added some fresh baby spinach and the feta was a perfect addition, it would not have been as good without it. Very easy to make and very filling, this is one of the recipes that will make it into the cook book. Even my  husband who does not like any kind of squash had no problem devouring his entire plate.

I am not a squash fan - but there is something about spaghetti squash that I'm drawn to. Maybe because it really has no flavor and takes on the flavors of what you add it to??? I avoid the take-out lunch scene at work as I'm not a fan of mass-produced food and have been experimenting with low carb recipes for lunch ideas. This is an absolute winner just as written! I have ideas of adding grilled chicken and peppers for added protein to get me through the afternoon. This is an amazing dish none-the-less! Try it - you won't be disappointed!

This is a great recipe! I only gave 4 stars because I used goat cheese because it's what I had at the time. I also cooked the squash the day before and it was still great! Don't think about it... Make it! Yum!!!!

Used dried basil instead of fresh, canned tomatoes instead of fresh which added more flavor and didn't add cheese. Wasnt too bad - I would make it again.

Spaghetti squash on its own is pretty bland no matter what veggies you add. I added some pasta sauce and that helped quite a bit.

Yummy! I made a couple changes, I wilted a couple handfuls of spinach in, added a drained and rinsed can of black beans, and used kalamatas made a wonderful entree.

My mother and I made this today, it was the first time I had ever made a meal using spaghetti squash. It was fantastic! We loved everything about it! 5 out of 5 for sure. We used this as our entree and were completely satisfied! Enjoy :)

This was WONDERFUL !!! As I was eating it, I kept saying '' yum, this is good, this is really, really good...'' I did add some chopped red peppers and a handful of fresh baby spinach leaves. I highly recommend this recipe...

This was awesome!! I've never made Spaghetti Squash before, so I was a little hesitant as to if it would be good, but it was awesome!!! Will definitely be making it again.  I followed the recipe as followed and I wouldn't change a thing!

It seems too simple of a recipe to be so good... but it is! I made it just as listed without basil but using feta cheese with tomato and basil in it. Was a big hit!

I saw a recipe on Dr Oz for Spaghetti squash and thought I would try it since I have eliminated pasta from my diet.  It is way better than real or gluten free spaghetti!!  My husband is super fussy and he loved it too.  We also added calamatta olives and cut up chicken that I cooked in the same pan after I took the veggies out. Delicious!

I liked this recipe as a side dish.  It tasted good, and my husband loved it.  My only issue is that it took a little longer than I had anticipated, but was worth it in the end.  Thank You!

My wife and I are on a health kick and counting our calories, and this recipe had a lot of high ratings, so we gave it a try. It was very easy to prepare, but it was sort of "bland" as far as taste goes. 

This dish would be nice as a side dish, but not so good for a main meal. It needs more oomph. I was hungry after 1/2 hour.

Fabulous!  Very light and tasty.  I used Pomi chopped tomatoes, and added oregano to the sauce to give it a little more zip.  The squash is very mild in flavor,  the  feta and olives (I like kalamata) are key to adding some pizzaz to the dish.  Enjoy!

Amazing! I can't believe I waited this long to try spaghetti squash. It's such a simple dish but so satisfying (and without the guilt that usually comes w/noodles).  Seeding this was a bit of a process for me but the end results were well worth it.  The great thing about this recipe is the versatility, I could see adding a lot of different veggies to it, and even different types of cheese.  Thanks for sharing this one!

I attempted spaghetti squash about a year ago and it wasn't good.  I think I didn't cook it correctly.  This time it was great!  I baked it in a small amount of water for about an hour.  I used canned basil/oregano tomatoes and parmesean.  It was worth the $5.70 I paid for the squash.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great taste as a side dish. I served with grilled mahi mahi and a glass of shiraz wine and it was "delish".I added a dash of seasoned salt. Will make for guests.

Bake squash for 45 minutes. Scoop out all seed junk.  Firm flesh becomes spaghetti.  Add extra garlic plus whatever other appropriate herbs you like.  Use Kalamata olives, halved.  Serve with interesting bread, salad, and Pinot Noir.

Took this as my contribution for Easter dinner.  Was a total hit with variety of ages.  I microwaved for 15 minutes - worked perfectly.  Used one full squash.  Served in shells.  Served 14 as a side dish.

Surprisingly a WINNER for my family.  We may make some adjustments for different taste buds in the future.  Started off with extra garlic and a little less onion.  Still a fabulous dish.

This recipe is great as a base for so many more options! I followed some other suggestions and baked the squash for 55 minutes with 1 1/2 cups water, and in turned out nice and soft. I also added a giant bunch of kale that I steamed for about 5 minutes and then sauteed in some olive oil and vinegar. It didn't detract from the dish at all and made it even healthier.  I also doubled the feta (I LOVE feta) since the kale stretched the dish so much. I'll definitely be making this again and again.

Not impressed with this dish.  I may try it again at a later time, but the tastes clashed with my palette.  Definitely worth a try for anyone that is interested.

This might have been great, except that the squash seems to have needed more time to cook. I put a fork through it and it seemed totally done, but it ended up feeling undercooked when we ate it. I like the other comments about adding water to the pan when you bake it, that would probably make it nice and tender.

This was delicious!  I used olive oil and minced basil from the tube.  Next time, I will add mushrooms and possibly artichoke & fresh spinach.  I'll also cook the squash for an hour, instead of 30 minutes, to take the crunch out of it.  Loved this!!

This was easy and delicious, but the baking time on the spaghetti squash is more like 45 minutes to 1 hour.  The longer you bake it, the less crunchy it is, and baking for 30 minutes left it way too crunchy for my taste!

This was perfect for my husband and I...we even added a little chicken for the protein and next time we're thinking shrimp. We cooked our squash by cutting it in half first then cooking cut side down about 40 minutes on 350. :)

Very easy, affordable and delicious. I used green onion instead of white onion, added diced sauteed eggplant and used dried basil instead of fresh. The squash tasted very similar to regular noodles.

It's a wonderful recipe. It's easy and one can add more ingredients, like parsley, scallion, etc.  It is very healthy because basically there is no oil when I cooked the squash. I highly recommend it.

Was anyone else laughing when they realized there is no actually spaghetti in this dish?  Well, I am now a believer - this dish is amazingly unique.  I did what another reviewer said and put the squash in a dish with 1.5 cups of water and it was perfect.  There was plenty for 3 people.  My 4 year old didn't go for it though.  We had bread with this, but could easily stand alone.

Yum! I made this to take with me on a flight tomorrow. Could use more flavor, though. Definitely bake the squash for longer than 30 minutes unless you like a little crunch. I need to find something to substitute for the olives since I'm not a fan of them...any suggestions?

I give it 4 stares only because I had to make some mods in order for me to feel like it was a 5 star recipe. I cooked the squash in the microwave to save time. For the veggies I sauteed a red onion, red bell pepper and zucchini together before adding the garlic. Then instead of adding fresh basil at the end I used a can of diced Italian seasoned tomatoes. The olives and Feta at the end are the perfect touch. My family LOVED it! We are going mainly meatless so this dish will definitely be something we eat often. It was that good!

Really enjoyed this one.  We had it as a main course warm, but the next day I ate it cold as a side dish.  I think we both thought it was better as a side than as a main course, but the flavors were great warm, cold, and both alone or as an accompaniment.  Only thing I changed was adding a little oregano to the cheese.  Yum!

Excellent twist on traditional spaghetti squash!  Its great re-heated the next day for lunch.  I followed the recipe exactly, only difference is i baked my squash at 375 instead of 350.  TIP: I used my "pronged" turkey lifters to remove the squash from the pan

It was ok--may be needs to grow on me.  I microwaved the squash after stabbing it several times.   It was too hard to cut in half to bake.

Yum! This is an excellent way to serve spaghetti squash! I added an extra clove of garlic and used a pint of grape tomatoes that needed to get used up - sauteed them until they were just about to pop.  I added some ground black pepper, too.  Very fresh, tasty dish.  Thanks for sharing!

I did not have feta cheese, so I used some ricotta cheese & parmesan cheese.  I also substituted a can of stewed tomatoes for the chopped tomatoes.  Very good.

If you have a microwave steamer this is a perfect time to use it to cut down on the cooking time - just cut the squash into pieces small enough to fit under the lid - it only takes 10 minutes or so to cook versus time to preheat the oven and then bake. Spaghetti squash is pretty versatile, you can vary the veggies and flavors in this recipe. Try fresh veggies and any herb pesto, or stir fry the veggies asian style with a little sesame oil.

This is so easy, and so filling and delicious.  I like it better than a heavier tomato sauce on spaghetti squash.  Thanks James!

I never even heard of spaghetti squash until this summer.  Found this recipe, and it was great.  I didn't have feta on hand, so I substituted cottage cheese.  My husband doesn't like olives, so I substituted almond slices.  We finished the entire dish that night.  SOOO good!  Thank you for posting!

My 16 year old son had three helpings, even though he was very suspicious when I was cooking it.  Used a red onion I had on hand, and also added some fresh spinach I had to use up, torn and tossed to wilt, tiny bit of fresh mint and a dash of cayenne.  Picture perfect colors.

This turned out a lot better than I originally thought it would. Because I'm allergic to onions, we left that out. All in all though this turned out very nicely. Definitely will be doing it again.

I quit smoking 5months ago and have gained 12 lbs. So while looking for a healthy meal to cook I stumbled onto spaghetti squash. I thought I'd hate it. This recipe is so quick and easy-everyone in my house loved it. I always add my own little changes to things (gotta have some parm. cheese), but this was really tasty!! I can't wait to try it again. I'll definitely keep spaghetti squash in the fridge until I get back into my jeans!!

this dish is amazing! spaghetti squash is an unbelievable discovery--i could live without spaghetti from here on in! i modified it by sauteing the onion in olive oil and adding garlic and some chopped tomatoes and then a small can of chopped mushrooms. i threw them in without draining them and it gave the dish some juice. then i tossed in the spaghetti squash and added salt and fresh basil. divine and healthy!!

I followed this recipe and found out that it didn't turn out as amazing as everyone is saying. It was way too watery, which was a disappointment. I like the idea of the recipe and if anyone has any suggestions to the watery problem, please let me know!

I had never made or even ate spaghetti squash before. However now that I have I will continue to make this recipe. I only made one change I used a can of diced tomatoes (only because I didn’t have fresh ones). This also pairs great with grilled chicken. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Delicious!  I followed this recipe and JOANN74's suggestions on microwaving the squash and adding in a can of italian tomatoes.  Probably the best veggie dish I've eaten in a long time!

Yum Yum!!  I had never had spaghetti squash before but saw this recipe on the home page and decided to try.  Very, very good.  I probably used over 1/4 cup of basil but other than that followed the recipe.  Nice healthy comfort food.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe. Any veggies will do. I omitted the olives and added cilantro. Left overs were great the next day too. Might kick it up a bit next time and add some slivered Jalapeno. If you do not have Feta Parmesan might be a good substitute.

My husband and I are trying to adhere to a healthier way of eating and I was trying to come up with something new and different and since neither one of us had tried spaghetti squash, I gave this one a try.  Honestly, the combination of the feta, basil, onions, and tomatoes is what caught my eye.  We had this dish tonight and OMG is it ever delicious!  The ONLY thing I'll do different next time is cut the oil used for cooking the onions and garlic down to one tablespoon.  Less calories, right?  Anyway, this is a wonderful dish and definitely a do-again at our house.

All the ingredients EXCEPT the squash were good. Either this recipe is wrong about the cook time or this vegetable is just inedible. Maybe cooked 2 hours it would resemble it's namesake but it didn't after the 45 minutes I cooked it. Thankfully I only used half of my prepared tomatoes, onions, garlic ect and NONE of my feta cheese.

It is obvious judging by the ratings and reviews that this recipe is a winner!!!  I literally just finished making (and inhaling) this great dish and felt compelled to comment on it.  I only made minor adjustments; trippled the amount of garlic (oh how I love it so!)  and added half of a red bell pepper.  This was also my first time ever having spaghetti squash!  A friend of mine grows them in her garden and gave me one to try.  I will DEFINITELY be making this again as well as searching for new ways to prepare this amazing veggie!

This is amazing!  I always add either 1 lb ground beef or 3 grilled, seasoned chicken breast to this meal.  I also like to add a touch of zucchini or squash.  So good and easy!

Had a spaghetti squash never cooked one before this was absolutely a HIT.Everyone loved it. I added artichoke hearts and didn't add the feta and it was still great and low fat.

This is an all vegetable dish that tastes great. My husband, who would not eat vegetables by choice, said we could have this again :). The squash has a very mild flavor. I added fresh chopped spinach and next time I may add a nut mix I have (soy nuts, dried cranberries, almonds, and pumpkin seeds).

Folks -- this was just great!  I'm at the level below beginning cook, and this turned out to be wonderful!  I had never made spaghetti squash before, so here's a tip:  when seeding, make sure to remove all the strings that you find along w/ the seeds --- that's NOT the "spaghetti" of the "spaghetti squash"!  This also works really well with typical pasta! Bon appetit!

Yum! I added some water in the pan when baking and accidentally left it in for almost an hour, but it was extra soft. We also added zucchini and Chicken sausage, which was really good.

My husband asks me to make this delicious dish, and it's healthy. Add fresh cracked pepper and garlic powder for more taste. In keeping with the Mediterranean feel of this, I also added ground lamb once. Delicious.

I love spaghetti squash. This took a lot longer to cook though. Next time I will cook the squash ahead of time. Will also ditch the tomato and add kalamata olives for a Mediterranean taste. Liked the recipe as is though too.

This is an interesting recipe.  Unfortunately, I had to leave out the feta.  Although I love it, my husband does not.  I sprinkled the squash with parmesan instead.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable and I added a lot more garlic than the recipe called for and added a whole lot of salt and pepper.  I had a similar dish at a local restaurant.  It was a lot spicier and shrimp and scallops were added to it.  It was delicious but sadly they took it off their menu.  I will keep experimenting with this recipe and next time I will add the seafood and extra seasonings.

I had never had spaghetti squash but I really enjoyed this. Good flavor, very similar to pasta, but way healthier. I had to cook my squash longer to get it to be more tender, came out great in the end. Good for leftovers and not too heavy.

So very yummy!  I cooked the squash in the microwave to keep from over heating my house and added diced red peppers to the onions and garlic.  The sharpness of the feta was a wonderful addition.  Can't wait for leftovers, might even try the 'patties' in another review.

Fantastic! I surprised my 'meat & potatoes' boyfriend with a meatless meal by pairing this up with Roasted Sweet Potatoes + Onions. He loved it! This was the first time either of us tried Spaghetti Squash. It was sweeter than a pasta, with the pulp very fine, like angel hair. The tomato based sauce was delicious with the olive and feta cheese for accent flavors. I made a 'mistake' and did not toss all the ingredients together as the recipe called for, but having the sauce and everything just on top turned out great. This is on the favorites list!

This was very, very good. The flavor was amazing, but next time I do want more tomato, olive, garlic, and perhaps a hint more onion. I couldn't taste the feta cheese mixed in as well as I wanted, but I loved the bites where it was sprinkled on top. Next time I'm going to mix some salt inside and put all of the cheese on top. My squash took over an hour to cook. I halved it and cooked it skin side down with a couple of cups of water poured inside the pan. When I realized it wasn't done or as soft as I wanted after over 45 min., I turned the halves up, forked the insides of the squash into big piles in the skin, and poured water inside, filling each to the top. This helped it cook and softened it some. I initially wrote a slightly more negative review, but really it was just that the texture of the squash takes some getting used to. Once you get past it, though, this is sooo delicious! Also, it made a total of four average sized ceramic bowls, if this helps at all in anyone's meal planing. It tastes as well reheated (covered in the microwave) as it does in the first place. Easy and delicious!

Loved this. Super easy. My 7 year old ate an entire bowl full. I added some zucchini and green onions as substitutes and it was quick and easy. You know it's good when your kids eat it all:)

This was a great way to cook spaghetti squash!  I had a very large squash (about 6 or 7 pounds), so I had to cook it about 2.5-3 hours...I cut it in half and placed the cut sides in about 1.5 inches of water...covered the pan and baked at 350 until tender.  Then, I used about 2 or 3 cups of it in this recipe.

Was so excited to try this recipe. Never having had spaghetti squash before I was not sure what to expect. The smell was great, the look was great but the taste just wasn't there. I loved everything in it, except the squash I guess. If you like spaghetti squash I would recommend this but otherwise I would not, it was not to my families liking.

Very yummy.  I microwaved the squash for five min. to soften it enough to cut then I cooked it in a baking dish with a cup of water (enough to cover the pan) instead of on a cookie sheet. I used italian seasoning, a small handful of bite size pepperoni, onion, garlic, fresh tomatoes, black olives and paremsan cheese.  Very tasty.  I did add some marinara sauce to my 4 yr old daughter's portion to make it more kid friendly.

I followed this recipe to the T. I guess it just wasn't suited to my tastes. I will not be buying spaghetti squash again, but it wasn't a total wash - I roasted the seeds with garlic salt, pumpkin style.

Fantastic flavors + EASY + HEALTHY + inexpensive. I wanted to try something different and carb consious after my holiday binge. This recipe will stay in circulation year round for sure.  It tastes so fresh and light w/o sacrificing flavor. Like spa food or something. I ate it alone the other day and it was very filling. Today I plan to bake or grill some lemony chicken to pair with it.   I made as is except I cooked my squash for 45 mins (a little longer) and used canned diced tomatoes (drained) and garlic powder. I've never cooked spaghetti squash before (although I've eaten it plenty of times). It was definitely an interesting experience. I love how the insides just come apart into strands. It was fun! :)

Loved it!  I cut the squash in half and placed cut side down in a baking pan and added 1 1/2 cups water as per someone else's suggestion.

This recipe complemented my parmesan crusted salmon beautifully! It was quick, easy, flavorful and my dinner guests just loved it. I did, however, have to bake my squash about 15 or 20 minutes longer -- maybe because my squash was a little larger than average. Otherwise the recipe was effortless. I'll definitely make this again.

Great recipe. Modified it a little by skipping the olives, using dry basil and adding two handful of baby spinach and sauteing it for a few mins before tossing in the tomato. If you want to impress a meat lover person with a vegetarian dish, this is the one

Phenomenal!  Definately use fresh tomatos (I used plum) and fresh basil if you can.  I think the fresh ingredients really make it pop!!!

This was so good!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and there wasn't any leftovers!  I almost wasn't going to add the olives since I'm not normally a fan but they were perfect in this dish.  Yummy!

Well, this is the first time that I have ever cooked Spaghetti Squash and I must say it was great. I had no idea what to expect, and now I can't wait to make this again. I made this as is, but I also added sauteed chicken which I thought was a great addition. Will make this again!

This was excellent! I didn't know what to expect or know exactly what I was doing so it was a little messy this first time around. I will definatley do this over and over again. My two year old lapped it up! I couldn't believe  it! I did use whatever I had on hand for this. I used tomatoes, green bell pepper, red bell pepper and a little minced garlic. This turned out great. I didn't have any basil so I left that out and topped with Feta. I was very surprised at how much my family enjoyed this! Thanks for sharing this great, healthy recipe!

Delicious! My husband loved it. I didn't have tomatoes so I used can of rotel and minced olives instead of sliced olives. I also used EEOO instead of vegetable oil.  It ended up a little dry and bland (i think because the squash was HUGE, probably should have used more ingredients to meet its size) so I did add a little light butter and pinch of meditteranean sea before serving. Great low cal low carb Nutrient Dense dish!!

Make sure the squash is hot when you mix this up to get those flavors to blend. It is even better the next day.. I have made this twice. Fantastic!

Very tasty ... I tried cooking the squash whole in the oven but it took over an hour so in the end I cut it in half and finished it off in the oven for about 15 more minutes.  I used a can of italian stewed tomatoes since we didn't have anything else and it tasted great.  I also used parmesean cheese instead of feta.  I will definitely make this again and will be a go-to recipe when we have vegetarian guests over to eat. The second time I made this I cut it half and placed it in a baking dish face down with a little bit of water - it cooked in about 40 minutes and was very tender.

This was my first time cooking spaghetti squash, and it turned out quite tasty.  The squash did need to cook for 40-45 minutes.  I used dried basil, but other than that, I didn't vary from the recipe. Yum!

The sauce on this was fantastic but the spaghetti squash ended up being too firm for me, and didn't quite work for me.  I'll definitely make the sauce for pasta though

A light and healthy salad. I have a similar recipe but it requires mch more time and this has a better flavor. I pierced the squash 5 times and wraped in 2 paper towels and microwaved the spaghetti squash (3lbs) about 9 minutes until it gave slightly. Thanks James!

Delish! I made some variations, but overall used this as my guide. To prep the squash I just baked it whole, then cut it lengthwise once it was full (much easier!, just bake at 375 for one hour in shallow baking dish). To the sauce I used fire roasted tomatoes (1 can), frozen chopped spinach (~2/3c) and frozen broccoli florets (~1c); and I used dried basil and Italian seasoning. It was so good, we loved it, my husband and I ate the entire pan!!

I really enjoy this recipe, and find my mouth watering every time i pass the spaghetti squash in the grocery store.  It's important to use FRESH basil. It gives it a sweeter taste, and i recommend a sweet onion like vidalia or red.  It just adds to the flavor.  I use olive oil each time i make it, and i never use anything but "cold pressed" olive oil.  Two thumbs up for a fabulous, low cal meal.

I can't believe this was spaghetti squash! So good! I used to serve spaghetti squash with a marinara sauce and parmesan - it was tolerable, but this was amazing! The feta cheese, garlic, olive, tomato combo works wonders. Our basil is done for the season so I used fresh parsley -- still tasted great.

This was my first time making spaghetti squash. This was super easy. I didn't have any olives. I used a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and basil. No fresh basil so I used dried. I liked the texture, the squash was sort of crunchy. I think this would be good with some shrimp. Great recipe!

I didnt folow this recipe completely. However it was a great guide. I don't like feta so I used parmesan cheese instead. And I added roasted red peppers, mushrooms & a little bit of sun-dried tomato pesto sauce when I served it. Tasted great heated up the next day!

I added chicken, more onion, more garlic, and more tomato. I also threw a couple of bay leaves when sauteing the onions and garlic. It was amazing. I love this recipe because you can really make it your own! Have fun with it and try different ingredients that you love!

This was my first time cooking spaghetti squash and it was really wonderful. I forgot the olives, but added toasted pine nuts - they added a great crunchy surprise throughout.  I wish I'd read Tracy's review on making the leftovers into a frittata - I bet that was great!  Will be making again.

It definitely needs to be cooked for more than 30 mins, more like 35-38.  When it is done it is a darker color, if part of it is still whitish, it will be crunchy! It was a great recipe, I just added a little bit more garlic.  Everyone loved it!

This was awesome. I made some additions such as extra garlic, toasted pine nuts, red bell pepper and french fried onions and finally fresh grated parmesan. This is a keeper.

Very good recipe! I used about 1/3 cup sliced kalamata olives and used halved grape tomatoes. It was delicious, but needed something on the side - I was still pretty hungry afterwards. It was a fun sensory experience for my 1-year-old daughter, too! Thank you!

The basic recipe is great!  I left out the feta, however, and mine turned out a little bland.    I love the texture and taste of the squash, though!    Will definitely be making this one again and next time I'll try it with the cheese.

This was great although I made variations to the recipes as others have.  I didn't have feta cheese and olives, so I used a small zucchini and yellow squash instead with the tomatoes.  I added various spices as well including red pepper flakes.  What was the best was the next day, I took the leftovers and drained the juice out, added about 1/2 cup flour and one egg and fried them in a little canola oil in a pan!  YUMMY!  We actually ate the veggie pancakes for breakfast with turkey bacon and toast. Awesome!!!  And very healthy.

A nice dinner, especially if you're new to vegetarian dinners.  Not EXACTLY like spaghetti, but is comparable.  I did the recipe exactly as described, but without the fresh  basil (I used dried) and it was still good.  I absolutely love tomatoes, and this time of year (late summer) and I would have added a little more.  Definitely recommended!

I had never cooked with or even tried spaghetti squash before, but a friend at work gave me one out of her garden. So, I figured I'd give it a try.  I am SO happy that I did!  This dish was fairly simple, and my 14 year old daughter had a great time helping me in the kitchen.  We did tweak it a bit, but I think even the basic recipe would have been fantastic.  We added fresh yellow squash and zucchini slices as much for color as anything, and we tripled the amount of garlic. Oh, and I think there may be a typo for the feta cheese, because 1/4 cup seemed like plenty. This has become one of our favorites, and I will now begin substituting spaghetti squash for pasta whenever I can.

This is a terrific recipe.  We have a tiny garden and we planted the spaghetti squash on a whim.  This recipe inspires to plant more next year.  It is an excellent dish!  Thanks, James.

There are so many variations you can do with this recipe, it always turns out amazing!  I left out the feta and olives, my husband doesn't like them.   I added fresh spinach, tomatoes and crushed red pepper.  I also nuked the squash for 10 mins. instead of baking it.  Delicious!

FABULOUS!  We had never had spaghetti squash before - so this was a new experience altogether.  I followed the recipe except the olives (I don't like olives, so I just left them out).  My husband & I both loved dinner...and the leftovers reheated quite well.  We'll definitely be making this again - and we'll probably try adding different veggies next time...very versatile.

I really liked this dish.  Low cal, quick cooking and healthy!  I used canned diced tomatoes and drained them.  I would try with baby tomatoes baked in the oven the next time.  The addition of feta cheese was made the dish really tasty

This was such a great tasting veggie side dish! I added 1 cut up zucchini, and 1 sliced red bell pepper. I was sceptical at first thinking it wouldnt be too flavorful, but it really does have a great flavor!

I used a yellow onion and also sauteed some zucchini with it. My boyfriend said it was one of the best recipes I have ever made for him. Next time per request, I am adding shrimp. I think it will be even more amazing!! Next time, I am also going to serve some crusty bread to soak up the juices.

Wow - I was expecting this to be good because I love all the ingredients in it, but holy cow! This was excellent! I accidentally overcooked the squash, but it was still wonderful. I don't like black olives so I used kalamata olives instead, and I used 1 tbsp of jarred basil. I topped it with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and this is now one of my new favorites. Definitely will make again.

Ehhh, it takes MUCH longer for the spaghetti squash to cook. Once it was done, it was ok, we actually enjoyed it with spaghetti sauce and a green salad. However, I won't be making it often. I just need to figure out why it took so long for the squash to bake...

I made this recipe for my family and they all enjoyed it. I added a substantial amount of fresh vegetables that I sauted with the onion and garlic. We had crusted bread with butter on the side and it was a complete meal. Everyone voted to keep this one.

We loved it! My wife and I had no idea what to do with a spaghetti squash. This looked promising and it was a hit.

We made a few changes. We are garlic lovers so we used 4 cloves. Next time it will be a full ear. We also doubled the basil.

On a side note we saved the seeds and toasted them for a light desert.

We are planning on making this for a vegan potluck and using pine nuts instead of feta.

THANKS!

Delicious!  My boyfriend was a little hesitant to try this at first, but he LOVED IT!  I boiled the squash for 30 minutes to cut down on time (pierced the skin several times beforehand), added baby bella mushrooms, and used grated Romano instead of Feta, simply because I had it on hand.  I actually think this sauce works better with spaghetti squash, as opposed to real spaghetti, because the squash absorbs and takes on the flavor.  Only one issue:  It looks kind of unappetizing in the bowl, but unless you're aiming to please a super-picky crowd, who cares!

I substituted the black olives with some Basil Pesto (Classico brand) and it was yummy!  I used canned diced tomatoes, drained, and that made it even easier!

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. We are not squash eaters in my family, but I was determined to give it a shot. I used what I had on hand which was garlic, tomato, olive, chicken, mozarella/parmesan mix, and oregano instead of basil. I loved it, my husband loved it, even my 4 year old loved his "noodles"! It was so fast and easy to make. I'm definitely keeping this recipe, and I can't wait to play around with it some more! Thanks so much for helping me get over what I used to think was a "yucky" food!

Deeee-licious!  I don't like squash at all and I LOVED this recipe.  I just wanted to prepare something healthy and low in carbs.  Little did I know how tasty this dish would be!  I used minced garlic and canned tomatoes (garlic & onion flavored).  I also used garlic and herb feta cheese.  I cooked the squash according to the recipe and it turned out perfect.  Seeding it was a bit of a hassle, but otherwise it was a perfect dish!

This dish is excellent! Per the suggestion of a couple other reviewers I added in 1 chopped red bell pepper and a couple good handfuls of fresh baby spinach at the end just before adding the sautéed mixture to the spaghetti squash. Since I added the red pepper I only put in 1 cup of chopped cherry tomatoes instead of 1.5 cups. The fresh basil and feta cheese really make this dish. This is a wonderful and tasty addition to the vegetarian section of my recipe binder. I can't wait to make this again!

I had high hopes for this recipe but apparently did something wrong.  I don't think I cooked the squash long enough because it had a crunchy consistency.  Tasted more like carrots than noodles.  Also, I used canned tomatoes which watered down the dish.  I'll definitely try this again but will microwave the squash and use fresh tomatoes.  Don't make my mistakes!

FANTASTIC. Cooked squash in microwave - saved a ton of time - and left out the olives. Great recipe! I am making again tonight!

Absolutely delicious! What a great way to eat squash. We must have had a huge squash b/c half of it was enough for the recipe. If I had usesd the whole thing, I would have had to add more feta cheese and olives. Everybody in our family loved it. We will make it again.

Caution: may cause overeating. This was absolutely delicious, and fairly easy. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used more tomatoes, basil, and olives. Next time, I'll add fresh oregano. This will become a winter staple in our house.

I don't care for squash but this was so good I think if there was more recipes like it around I might be a squash eater.  I only had a red onion and instead of fresh basil i had feta crumbles with basil and tomatoe.  Turned out fine.  I made it with chicken though I think it would go better with a steak.

This si really a versatile recipe. Y0u can used whatever veggies and herbs you like. I used garlic, onion, basil and cherry tomatoes, salt and pepper of course and topped it was parmesan cheese. The more parm the better, it gives it great flavor. I did find I needed to cook the squash for longer than 30 mins, i just cooked them in the microwave for about 3 mins per side (halved) depending on the size. Very tasty!

I have to give this recipe 4 stars because it did come out perfect.  The ingredients were flavorful.  But this was my first time tasting this particular squash and I must say I wasn't  impressed with the squash itself.  It was a bit too crunchy  for me. Don't get me wrong it didn't crunch like ice or anything, just a little crunch and that was too much for me.  I let it cool completely because I wanted to eat it as a cold pasta dish, then I added some italian dressing to give it a little kick. (good idea).  Its worth trying though.  Thank you for the recipe.

This was so delicious and nutritious.  I added chicken sausage and crushed red pepper and omitted the cheese. I also used two squashes instead of one without doubling the rest of the ingredients. I used fresh basil from my garden.  I think fresh basil here is the key.  I can't imagine substituting dried herbs after having it with the fresh basil.  Sometimes fresh herbs really make a dish.  Also, for me, using a bit of crushed red pepper provided the right amount of kick.  I didn't miss the cheese at all.  I will make this again and again.

THIS WAS SURPRISINGLY GOOD!!! I'm not a big fan of spaghetti squash but my husband loves them. I'm so happy to have found this recipe. My family liked it very much. This recipe is also a very good way to use up extra spaghetti squash from my garden

I liked all the ingredients EXCEPT the spaghetti squash, it had no flavor to me at all.  It was my first time ever using one, so perhaps I didn't make it correctly??

Loved this!!!  I've never made this and it was so yummy.  I think I overcooked because it was mushy, not stringy like spaghetti (if that's what it was supposed to look like).  I didn't use olives since I don't like them and added a zucchini.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes since fresh tomatoes are scary these days.  I'm making this tonight for the 2nd time in two weeks.  Perfect for weight watchers too!!

This was ok.  My fiance was a bit put off by the slight crunchiness of the squash, but overall the flavors were pretty good. It was such a pain to split the squash in half, and even though the rest of the recipe was easy, I don't know that I want to bother with spaghetti squash all too often.

This will be a keeper in our home...I'm looking forward to making it again with home grown tomatoes, and fresh basil from our garden...yum!
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

One of my least favorite spaghetti squash recipes. Not sure if it was lack of some olive oil, pepper, salt or something, but something was definitely missing. Bummer as I love all of the ingredients but it just didnt mesh.

This was my first time cooking Spaghetti Squash and I didn't know what to expect. I was happy with the flavors but the texture of the squash was crunchy and hard. I am not sure if it was supposed to be that way or maybe I didn't bake it enough. Maybe I'll try it again.

A great recipe. I was nervous because my husband hates squash, but he couldn't get enough of it! I did have to cook my squash much longer that I thought. I ended up microwaving it for about 15 minutes before it was even close to soft enough to scoop out. The olives and onions really add a lot of flavor and spunk. We had tons of leftovers so we enjoyed this dish for a few days!

Awesome!! Sure to please every time. OK, so I'm biased, I love spaghetti squash with just butter alone, but this takes it to the whole next level. We've also tried fresh cilantro instead of basil... very good too, and sometimes I toss the squash into the skillet with the garlic/onions for a few minutes. Oh yeah, if the squash is too hard to cut, it can be thrown into the oven whole. Any way you fix it, you can't go too wrong with this one.  Yum!!

This was fab... I love squash and now I can finally get my boyfriend to eat it. I was out of fresh tomatoes so had to use canned (it worked well enough, though I can't wait to try it with fresh) and I added chicken right in the dish. I definatly recommend adding cubbed chicken breasts to it.

Fantastic recipe!  I printed it once but didn't take the time to store it to my recipe box.  I was afraid that I'd never find it again but was relieved to find this delicious recipe.  (Yep, it's stored now.)

I cooked this easy recipe with dry basil instead of fresh, flavorful red onions and more feta because I love cheese.  Absolutely delicious!

This is a great recipe.  I cooked the squash for 50 minutes and had to add A LOT of parmesean cheese to give it flavor, but I really liked pretending it was pasta.  Not that great the next day so eat it the first night.

This recipe is a great way to use the never ending squashes during fall and winter.  I rediscovered this recipe after thinking it bland after my first go.  Much better with the fresh basil.  Goat cheese was good instead of feta.  Other than those two ingredients standing out the recipe lends itself to interpretation.  I've used artichoke hearts, shelled edamame, bell peppers, and basil pesto and all were great.

This was too dry for me, so I added about a tablespoon of olive oil after mixing all the ingredients. Tasted much better. Cooking time for the squash for me was about 45 minutes. I do recommend poking holes as states in previous reviews.

I really liked this recipe.  I would definitely go with the fresh basil and the only addition I made was to add diced artichoke hearts to the mix.  It was a good addition.

Very tasty way to make spaghetti squash.  The beauty of this recipe is that you can add things like chopped red peppers, celery, snow peas to give a bit more color.  Or just leave it as is and it is just as tasty.

This is so good.  I was very nervous at first, because the squash smelled kind of funny when I was scooping it out.  After it got mixed with the other stuff, though, it was fine.

I nixed the garlic as that stuff stays with me for days.  I didn't miss it at all.

I tweaked this a bit and it was fabulous! I didnt have olives or cheese. I used a can of crushed tomatoes and a can tomato paste with sauteed onions and mushrooms. It tasted like spaghetti and I will most definately use this to trick my baby boy into eating veggies When he is older!

This is an easy recipe to follow.  I enjoyed it much more with pasta then with spaghetti sauce. But must have lots of feta  and definitely hits the spot with some nice olives mixed in.

For squash it was pretty good.  My kids ate a couple bites and didn't guess it wasn't noodles, but something was missing.  I probably would add more spice next time.

I made this according to directions, but left out the olives because we don't like them.  My husband wasn't a big fan.  I made it as a main dish, but would prefer it as a side dish.  I tried baking my squash, but after an hour it still wasn't soft, so I cooked it in the microwave instead which worked wonderfully.  I did like it better sprinkled with parmesan cheese.

Very unique, but I was the only one who enjoyed it.  Only change I made was instead of adding feta cheese, I added cheddar.  

Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is a great alternative to pasta.  The only change that I did was only use half of the squash.  I saved the rest for another dish.  It was great thanks, James.

I used scallions instead of onions and gorgonzola instead of feta, and added sliced mushrooms with the tomatoes in the pan. Totally yummy with lots of fresh cracked pepper!

this squash turned out looking like pumpkin when I had taken it out I have never cooked a spaghetti squash before so perhaps that is the problem, I was just wondering if I did not cook it long enough or what.  Any help would be awesome. 
p.s. I threw the squashy mush out and just used angel hair pasta

I made this dinner for my husband and extra picky (chicken nuggets and fries) daughter. My husband gave it 4 ½ stars. He said that it would be a 5 star meal, but there was no chocolate or ice cream in it, LOL! My daughter actually ate an all veggie dinner! For that reason alone I would give it 5 stars, but to be realistic I will rate it a 4 star. I think that mushrooms would have been great in this dish, but I forgot to put them on the list when I sent my husband to the store for the ingredients. I will definitely be making this meal again in the near future!

I thought this recipe was ok. A little bland. It think goat cheese would have been a good choice. Maybe some baby spinach. However it was easy to make and I had most ingrediants on hand. I will probably make this again with some changes. Thanks!

This recipe was very good, though my husband thought it was too heavy on the basil.  I used substitued olive oil for the vegetable oil and omitted the feta cheese since I really dislike it.  I also seasoned it with Paula Deen's House Seasoning.  It was excellent.

Not too bad, but I will make some modifications next time I try this. For one, the squash was a little too "crunchy" for my taste - I would probably cook it longer. Also, I added extra feta and olives and still felt that the flavor was a little bland - maybe my squash was just larger than normal!

i thought this was great flavor for the basic ingredients and ease of making. i espec loved the pasta feel-tomatoes, cheese, basil-since my husband and i are cutting our carbs lately. i would try other suggestions to add chicken and make it a main dish.

I thought it was very good.  My husband thought it was great.  I thought the texture of the spaghetti squash was a little too crunchy, but that could be the brand I bought or the way I cooked it so I won't blame that on the recipe.

Pretty darn good.  Even my non-vegetarian husband went back for seconds.

Ok for a vegetarian meal.  I did have to add a lot of stuff to this, the squash has no taste (this was my first time making spaghetti squash).  It also needs longer on the cooking time that was recommended.

Thanks for the great idea for spaghetti squash.  I'm not the most creative of cooks, and never would have thought of this recipe myself.  We just had it for dinner last night, and it was delicious.  I'm heating up the leftovers for lunch right now, and can't wait!

Awesome!  I used Parmesan instead of Feta cheese and added diced green bell peppers and it came out delicious.
This was our first time trying spaguetti squash and loved it.  The baking time was accurate and the combination of flavors were great.
A quick and great tasting recipe recommended to everyone.

Great recipe! I'm always looking for creative ways to prepare veggies and this was excellent. One adjustment -- I had to cook my squash for closer to 50 minutes and it was actually on the small side. I don't think 30 minutes is adequate.

I made this last nite and it was delicious!  So good in fact that I can hardly wait until lunchtime so that I can eat the leftovers.  It was THAT good.  I added some chicken and a small jar of capers... YUM!

This recipe was strange.  It seemed somewhat soggy, and I think it would be better with less onion.  My squash took over an hour to cook.  Interesting recipe, but somewhat disappointing.

Great recipe! I was cooking this with 2 other dishes at the same time. Sauteed everything too long, forgot the garlic (a sin!) and it still came out great! Will try again when I can focus my time direct on this dish.

I think I probably over cooked the squash and so had some minor problems with the texture being a little too mushy and watery.  This recipe easily makes eough for 8 people plus leftovers depending on the size of the squash you buy.  The flavor is great & wonderful change to the usual ways to cook squash!

Recipe was easy to do and quick to make.  Feta is quickly too strong so be careful to not use too much!

Ohmygosh!!! This is easily one my very favorite recipes!  I added kalamata olives instead of black olives - even better!  I will be making this one again very soon.  Thank you for sharing!
