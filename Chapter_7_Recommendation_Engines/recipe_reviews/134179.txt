I submitted this recipe and made it the other night with a little less wine and I think it was better - just thought I'd pass that on  :)

Yummy!  I didn't have Muenster cheese, so I used Monterey Jack and it was still very good!

Good, and once the chicken is cut-up (something I despise doing), it was easy going from there.  I think the muenster is part of what makes this recipe different from others and that it's worth getting that specific cheese.

I didnt have any white wine so I substituted 1/2 can cream of chicken soup stirred together with 1/2 can of chicken broth and poured that over everything. My family rated this recipe a 10!! I served it with herb stuffing and corn. Really good flavor and so moist. I will definitely make this again!!

This one is a keeper, it turned out great.  I reduced the recipe for 2 and added a few black olives. Wonderful dish that I'll serve again and again.

Perfect. I made a slight mistake in a hurry and left the chicken breasts whole. It turned out perfect and my family loved.

this is so good, don't be tempted to add anything to it!! i wasn't sure how it would be with so few ingredients in the sauce but it's perfect just the way it is. i have made it a few times now and have used muenster, mozzarella and provolone and each was fantastic.

Excellent recipe!  I also sauteed about half of a white onion along with the mushrooms.  I served the chicken with acorn squash and 3 cheese rice and it was a huge hit with my fiance!  This recipe is a keeper.

I would probably give this 3.5 stars.  I ended up with a lot of liquid (not sauce) in my dish.  Not sure why that was.  I was thinking the wine and butter would make more of a sauce, but it was very liquid.  I also reduced the number of eggs.  6 eggs seemed like overkill and since the eggs didn't go in the dish I used 2 and it was plenty to cover the 4 breast I had.  I also had to use more then a cup of bread crumbs.  It was probably more like a cup and 1/2.  Overall taste was fine, although, my kids thought that they would like mozzarella cheese better.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Found this searching for something to use up my Muenster Cheese that was starting to get some mold.

I only had one large already cooked herb chicken breast.  So I had to add some filler.  I boiled up a 10oz box of whole wheat Penne.  Laid that on the bottom of the 13x9 baking dish.

Cubed the cooked chicken bite size then coated with bread crumbs as instructed.  Sautéed a short time since the chicken was already cooked.  Layered that in.

For more volume sautéed sliced onion, mushrooms and a red pepper with some chopped garlic.  When done added wine and 2 tablespoons of frozen Pesto sauce.  After this all mixed, layered on top of chicken.

Muenster cheese as directed with a little Parmigiana on top.  Baked uncovered 30 min till cheese was browned and bubbly.

It was superb.  I'll try and upload a pic, but if it is like doing a customized recipe, which I also tried , AllRecipes may require you to be a paying member.

This had such a good taste.  I did add chopped onion and garlic to the mushrooms when I sauteed them.  I started out dipping the chicken in egg, but after doing a few pieces realized that the egg just made for more mess.  The breadcrumbs stick to the chicken breast pieces just fine without it.  I used 6 chicken breast and cut them up about chicken nugget sized and that covered the bottom of a 9X13 pan.  If you make it definatly use the muenster, dont sub cheeses.  I will definatly make again.

This was really good! I only had 3 chicken breasts but kept the measurements the same because so many people said the sauce is KILLER. I did add 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup too. Served with butter pasta and steamed broccoli.

This was a yummy recipe.  I modified it a lot though.  Instead of using cubed chicken pieces I sliced the chicken into thin slices and pounded them flat as if I was making chicken kiev.  I also used butter, shallots, garlic and rosemary in my white wine sauce.  The baking time was greatly reduced because of the way I prepared the chicken.

This was very good. I expected some gravy/sauce to develop from the wine and chicken/mushroom juices while it baked and was a little surprised when it didn't, but the chicken was moist, and the dish was still delicious.

The chicken was so tender. My husband was willing to be the sous chef for this one and was very pleased the way it turned out. It is an ambitious recipe and was better to have two people working it! We added minced shallots with the mushrooms and then removed them from the pan. We used the same pan to saute the chicken but added garlic oil. We had not muenster so we used shredded mozzarella. The leftovers were almost as good as the first night. It's a keeper!

My husband and I just had this chicken and it was simply delicious. The smell throughout the house had me salivating endlessly. Great deodorizer. The only thing I did differently was that I used cremini mushrooms and for cheese used a combination of provolone and mozzarella. Simply delicious. Thanks.

This recipe sounded good but I don't like mushrooms.  One of the reviewers used spinach in place of them so that's what I tried and everybody loved it.  My daughter even ate the spinach -- first time ever to eat it!!  The chicken was tender and delicious.

My husband and 2 toddlers loved this.  I made pasta with marina sauce to go along with it.  Tasted a lot like chick parm. 2 modifications.  I put the wine in but I also added on top, a can of Campbell's cream of chick as someone suggested. (so glad I did that). I used mozzarella chz as I didn't have muenster chz.  Was good.  My advice would be to season the chicken with whatever (salt, garlic, pepper) you like before adding the mushrooms on top.

Fairly easy recipe that looks and tastes like you spent way more time on it than you did!  I followed the recipe exactly and even the kids liked it (they usually don't like anything flavored with wine).  This made our menu rotation.

I followed the recipe exactly. However, I used flavored  Panko bread crumbs which may be the reason there was no "sauce" and the final product was just OK. My husband liked it but I don't think I'll make it again. It was a bit of effort for a final product that was rather flavorless. Maybe using a pepper jack or softer cheese would make a difference?

Yummy recipe, and another new way to prepare chicken.  Only change I made was to add some diced onion and garlic to the mushrooms for a little extra flavor.

I made the same mistake as Andy and forgot to cut the chicken into cubes.    Used four slices of muenster - less than 1/4lb.

Very tasty! I substituted spinach for the mushrooms because my kids don't like mushrooms. My children loved it!  We'll make this again.

Didn't have mushrooms, so used cream of mushroom soup - didn't have specified cheese, so used random cheese cubes - turned out great regardless.  Great savory flavor!
