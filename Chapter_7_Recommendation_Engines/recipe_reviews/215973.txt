Delish! Made it for the family and everyone loved it.  Used the new Classico Light Alfredo I found at Target.

This was absolutely delicious!!  My husband loved it and has already requested variations, like shrimp instead of chicken. There is a local restaurant that makes a very similar sauce and we were so glad to find an equivilant.  The only changes we made this time were to use regular basil pesto instead of the sun-dried tomato and we left off the feta on the top since it's not usually a flavor we enjoy.  The cheese could have been replaced with mozzerella if you wanted to add something.  We sliced the tomato like the recipe said but it would have also been good chopped.  I will just add that the sauce is actually a lot so it required a knife and fork to eat.  If you want it to be a true eat with your hands type pizza then I would recommend not using all of the sauce and maybe save some of the leftovers for some pasta.

This pizza was delicious!  We loved it - although it is very rich and I might recommend it being used as an appetizer. I couldn't find sun-dried tomato pesto, so just omitted it and still thought it tasted great.  I really liked the garlic flavor of the pizza - used bottled minced garlic. Will definitely make again.

Fabulous! My husband and kids loved this! I omitted the tomatoes on top...warm tomatoes are not my thing. And decreased the garlic just a little and it was the perfect combo, for fun I put onions on one half of the pizza just to see how it would taste and it was a good compliment! Most are right though, it makes ALOT of sauce! I made two 12 inch pizzas with what I thought was the perfect amount of sauce and still had sauce left over, I would say half the sauce recipe and there won't be waste :)

This is a really great recipe. Tried it tonight and loved it.  I'm cooking for me and my husband and my two year old so to please my two year old I substituted the feta cheese for mozarella cheese with success.  I'm sure it would also be great with feta.  Couldn't get sun-dried tomato pesto so i just omitted it.  Will try harder to find it next time.  Nice change from the same old pizza...

Try some sliced green olives or artichoke hearts on this delicious pizza, it really enhances the favors and add bite and tang to this recipe! I tried it with regular pesto and it was every bit as amazing! It's a good one!

I thought this was just okay, it's a good starting point but needs to be doctored up a bit for more flavor.

Not bad.... While my hubs and I didn't dislike this, we would not have it again. We both felt the taste was "off," so to speak. Our pizza didn't taste anything like alfredo (which really surprises me). The feta overpowered everything else. Feta is a strong, distinctly flavored cheese. I believe mozzarella would have been a more suitable match. It would also melt better (feta doesn't really melt at all). Contrary to other's comments about this being a "knife and fork" kind of pizza, I can only somewhat agree. I didn't use a pre-baked crust nor did I "pre-bake" my store bought (fresh) pizza dough. What I DID do was pre-heat my baking stone and then, using my pizza peel (dusted with cornmeal), carefully "slid" my prepared pizza onto it. This produced a nice, crispy crust. I also allowed my pizza to "rest" ten minutes prior to slicing it. This is KEY as it allows the fragile pizza to "set up" a bit. Other than subbing prepared dough for a store-bought crust, using a 6 oz. pkg. of (cut up) Tyson's pre-cooked oven roasted chicken strips, chopping my tomato rather than slicing it (personal preference) and switching to a sun dried tomato & basil flavored feta, I followed this recipe to a T. I'm just not sure this is for me / us. Maybe with a few tweaks this could be better, but I'm not in any hurry to find out. Thanks anyways! :-)

This is very good.  I agree the sauce needs to be cut in half.  It does not look like it when speading, but if it is not reduced, the pizza is too soupy.  I used regular pesto and added chopped sundried tomatoes.  Delish.

Awesome pizza.  Made with "whole wheat and honey pizza dough" from this site.  For the alfredo sauce made "fettuccini alfredo sauce II" also from this site.  Didn't use the pesto and added fresh chopped spinach.  This one is going into the weekly rotation for sure!

My family liked this alot! I won't say it was my favorite thing because I had to substitute basil pesto for the tomato one (thanks alot to the grocery store) so mine didn't come out as great as I think it could've had I found all the ingredients I wanted, but the taste was very good and it was pretty easy to throw together. I would try again.

This was SO yummy and flavorful.  I used Amanda Rider's Quick and Easy Pizza crust recipe and precooked it. I didn't use all the sauce as it makes a lot.  It makes a great dip for your crust or breadsticks.  I also used mozzerella instead of Feta. I love Feta cheese, but it's so expensive.  I also added bacon crumbles with the chicken, but this pizza doesn't need more flavor. It is so yummy. You can really taste the garlic in the sauce, so if you are not a garlic lover, cut back on that.  I thought it was perfect!

This was very good.  I did use frozen pizza dough because I don't care the pre-made crust.  I will be making it again, it's so easy and a change from regular frozen pizza's.

Made on a garlic french bread base instead of pizza dough and was fantastic. Do be careful with amount of sauce--can get pretty sloppy if you overload it.

I can't get things like alfredo sauce or sun-dried tomato pesto where I live, so I made those myself and then put the pizza together. So it turned out to be a bit or work...which is true of most homemade from scratch pizza. I felt it was worth the trouble because the pizza was delicious and a bit different. My sauce was pink...probably due bo my homemade stuff...but didn't hurt the taste a bit. I will make this again.

This is my favorite pizza recipe and I always get compliments when I serve it- Tastes good without the chicken too when I made it for vegetarian friends.  I think the recipe makes more than what you need for your standard store bought pizza crust- if you use all of it it gets a bit messy.  Could make two pizzas though.

This pizza was very good.  The only change I made was to use mozzarella cheese instead of feta as we dont care for feta.  It was definitely an "eat with a fork" kind of pizza as it was rather messy but delicious!

Warning: Do not make this pizza recipe--  --unless you can eat the whole thing!!!  Delicious does not even come close to describing this pizza.  I used  regular pesto, not sun-dried tomato, because it's what I had on hand. And I saved some of the sauce for later, since the recipe made too much for my 12" whole-wheat crust.  Results-- Definitely a pizza worth having a relationship with!!

This was easy to make and easily adapted to include sun dried tomato, onions, mushrooms, and artichoke hearts. I used more pesto than directed, and it was great. I also skipped the oil and butter, and used less alfredo, with no complaint from my diners.

I substituted sun-dried tomato pesto with a sun-dried in oil puree. They did not have the pesto at the grocery store that I frequent.
