I made this for an office potluck. Since it is a cold dish I did not need to worry about the heating, etc. Nice vegetarian dish. Good cold or hot. I added pine nuts for some extra crunch.

I contributed this dish as a vegan offering for my family's Thanksgiving dinner.  It was a hit with vegans as well as with carnivores.  Great dish for potluck, and very very easy.

Yum! I just tried this for the first time, and its a keeper. I only had a jar of regular un-marinated artichokes, so I needed to add a little greek dressing. I also added some pine nuts as suggested by someone's review. I am planning to make this again, and soon.

This great. Easy to make. I used green onions instead of red.

I thought this a little bland.  I try to make the recipe as written the first time I make it but I did not have any black olives.  I used green olives which is what I had on hand and some fresh basil.  I also added a little balsamic vinegar and some freshly grated parmesan cheese which really boosted the flavor.  Thanks so much for posting the recipe.

I gave it 4 stars because "as is" it needs a little bit of something.  I added pine nuts as others suggested.  I also added a dash more lemon juice and a liberal amount of greek seasoning.  The seasoning really helped the overall flavor.  Also, I used about half of the olives and I would by chopped or halved olives.  Whole olives was a bit too much.  Overall, it was a big hit at a party.

Had a chance to make this salad last minute when needed for a picnic...  Added some feta cheese, cubed, as well as italian dressing instead of using the artichoke marinade (my artichokes were only canned salted).  Very good and easy when out of other ingredients...

Very tasty! I've made this recipe many times as a side dish or as a vegetarian wrap. I add toasted pine nuts too. I also like adding roasted red pepper to the mix for some extra color.

We liked this a lot! It could only get better if we'd have let it chill longer. Dinner couldn't wait, so it wasn't real cold but definitely worth the effort. I used the grease off of some bacon to brown my rice in before cooking it. Also used chicken stock instead of plain water to cook my rice. Thanks for this recipe.

This was a wonderful rice salad! I ended up adding a cut up cucumber that I had leftover and that was a nice addition. Thanks for the recipe!

Made changes.  Used green onion b/c that was all I had.  When cooking the rice I added some Oregano, Parsley, Garlic, Nutmeg and Salt.  I also cooked fresh mushrooms with the rice.  The can of artichokes that I had came in water so I added olive oil to the mix instead of using the "artichoke marinade."  When combining the ingredients I added more Oregano, Parsley, Nutmeg, Salt, etc.  Then added a can of garbanzos and poppy seed.  Colorful and tasty.

My family really enjoyed this salad.  It was quite easy to throw together and went well with hamburgers on the grill.   I didn't let the rice chill completely, so it was room temperature and I didn't add a cup of red onions but it still tasted great.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to either cut back on the garlic or use garlic powder.  It was quite strong in the salad (thank goodness we love garlic!).  Thanks for the great summertime salad.

I made a few changes, I used orzo instead of rice and halved cherry tomatoes. The salad is definitely better if its refrigerated overnight. If I made this again I'd add Parmesan cheese for some extra flavor.

Just finished making this for picnic with the in-laws tomorrow. I added chopped carrots and fresh chopped herbs - basil, oregano and mint about 1 tbs total and preliminary tastes are fantastic!!  We'll see how it holds up tomorrow.

This recipe is phenomenal! Is definitely a keeper for my kitchen.  Only changes/additions I made were: 1) added about a tablespoon more of lemon juice (personal preference); 2) added some Greek seasoning, and; 3) added some dried mint.  I can hardly wait for summer tomatoes to be in season as they'll add even more fresh flavor!  Do yourself a favor and MAKE THIS RECIPE!! YUM!

Made this with souvlaki and tzatziki sauce and it paired GREAT. Omitted the black olives because the little man in the house doesn't like them... next time might cut back a little on the onions. But, it was DELICIOUS!!! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I loved the ingredients but the dressing was too sharp!  Will try again and try to tone down the dressing.

This is very tasty.  I've made this several times because it is so easy to make and everyone seems to enjoy it. It's tasty, but not overwhelming.
