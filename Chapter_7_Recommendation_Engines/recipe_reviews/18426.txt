My grandmother was born and raised in the South, so though I grew up in the North, I grew up on peach cobbler and peach crisp. This recipe is good but perhapes mis-named. The recipe results in something more like a cobbler than a crisp. If you want something more like a COBBLER this recipe is GREAT. But if you are looking for a crisp I have the following suggestions.   The first time I made the recipe I followed it exactly. The second time I made it I adjusted it.   When I made it the second time I doubled the amount of peaches, and made only half of the topping. (The recipe makes a lot more topping than is needed.)  I also changed the topping a little bit. 1. I added a cup of oats. 2. I doubled the cinnamon.  3. I used only 1 1/2 cubes of butter instead of 2 cubes.  4. Instead of 1 1/2 cups of white sugar I put in 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar.  5. I also drizzled honey on top of the crumb topping before baking it.

Took this to a potluck. It was a hit! Used fresh peaches with skin on . Added a bit of brown sugar and cinnamon to the peach slices and a few dashes of nutmeg to the crumble mixture. Thanks for a great tasting and easy recipe!

YUM!  Did modify this a bit - I only made 1/2 recipe since I was low on peaches.  Added 1/2 cup of oatmeal and 1/2 cup brown sugar to the topping.  This was SO good. Am making it for the 2nd time this week right now!  I used fresh peaches (with skins) the first time, but this time I'm using canned so we'll see.

You didn't make it right. It calls for a big can of peaches and  a cup of butter(2 sticks), not a pound(thats four sticks).I actually said when I submitted this recipe to add one to two sticks depending on how much people like.I have been making this for years and it comes out great everytime.

This was excellent!  I used 2 large fresh, firm peaches, halved the recipe, added 1/4 cup sugar and 2 tbs butter to the peaches to make more of a pie filling consistency.  I cooked it in a loaf pan.  It was still yummy crispy even though some peach liquid boiled up over the top of the toping.  Really really good stuff here!!!
I have also used apples and canned cherry pie filling with this and it has all been very good.

Wow! This is incrediable! I had a craving for peach cobbler, but I had everything except milk. I search for a recipe that did not list milk as an ingredient (didn't think that was possible) and I found this one! I must admit I was doubtful this would work, but boy was I wrong!

I followed the directions as listed except I put a little sugar and cinnamon on top. I would not recommend that because it came out too sweet - but it was still edible. I can't wait to make this for the Hoildays! Thank you! :)

this was very good. It really is easy to make. I did use two cans of peaches, which is what you need to cover the bottom. I've made before, but peaches were in "season". Try this you will LOVE it. I did only use 1 cup of sugar...as I didn't want to be too sweet.  thanks

This is a very yummy dessert.  I made it for my son's birthday party for something different and everyone loved it.  The topping is the best.  Very easy to make also!  I will make it over and over!

Great base recipe! I added 2 tblsp of flour, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla extract & 1 cup of blueberries to the peach mixture. For the topping I added reduced the flour to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup of oats, I subbed the white sugar with 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/4 cup white sugar, added 1/2 tsp nutmeg & allspice, and 1/4 cup chopped pecans & walnuts. Used only 1/2 the butter and the topping came out very crumbly and flavorful! Easy & delicious! Thanks for sharing!

I've made this twice and will do a third for Thanksgiving.  Like others, I thought it resulted in too much crust and too few peaches.  The first time, I put it in an 8x8 and thought the peaches were still too thin.  I thought there was way too much crust with 1/2 the topping ingredients.  The second time, I doubled the peaches and at first put them in a 9x13 but thought they were still spread too thin so I went back to the 8x8 using 2 29oz cans. 2 cans in an 8x8 seems about right now.  I kept the 1/2 topping amounts but changed to 3/4 whole wheat flour plus 1/4 rolled oats and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  Because of the increase in peaches and smaller baking dish, I increased the baking time to 55 minutes.  This version has good reviews from my spouse, daughter and grand-kids.  I'll be going with these mods for Thanksgiving, but will probably tweak later versions with apricots and/or a few sour cherries as well as playing with the crust some more.

I made this with frozen peaches from this summer. I doubled the cinnamon and used 1 cup flour and 1 cup oats, and 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Looks and smells delicious!

This made a LOT of topping (I had leftovers) and 29 oz of sliced peaches would not even cover the bottom of my 13 x 9 inch pan...so that was a little weird. i switched it to an 8 x 8 glass baking dish and then STILL barely had enough, so i tossed in some blueberries too to fill it up. Other than those proportion issues, this tasted great...the topping was delicious (despite how frustrating it was to get that sand-like, crumbly texture) and it was fairly simple.

really good. loved the topping. I added a sprinkling of brown sugar and cinnamon to the peaches to hide the fact they were not ripe. I also had a problem with the crumb topping not browning even after 45 minutes so i put the broiler on low for a few minutes. (placing the cobbler at least 5 or 6 inches away from the flame) and that made it crisp perfectly. It was a big hit with my family.

It seems these have to be the wrong measurements for the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and this was hardened flour over peaches. Waaaay too much flour mixture. I was really looking forward to dessert tonight. This wasted my ingredients and my time. Sorry.

Super easy and really good.  A definite keeper.  Great for when you need something homemade, but don't have a lot of time.  Your guests will be impressed that you had time to "bake all day".  I made the recipe as is, and really enjoyed it.  I persoanlly like a little more peaches though.  The next time I made it with an additional small can of peaches.  I also increased the flour by about a 1/4 cup, decreased the sugar by a 1/4, and doubled the amount of cinnamon.  It turned out great.  I have also substituted the peaches with apple pie filling.    Great with vanilla bean ice cream.

This is a recipe for people who like crisp desserts. I used fresh peaches. I also added a touch of my own. I used white and brown sugar. It tasted really good. This is one of the best desserts I ever had. Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!!!

I made this on a whim, because I had fresh white peaches from a local farm in my town. I only used 3 (because they were HUGE!) I didn't want to use canned peaches (that's just me!) I have to agree with some of the comments, that this is more of a cobbler than a "crisp" 
I added brown sugar to the top of it and also baked it a little longer than the 30-40 minutes. It turned out GREAT!! So many complitments on it! Can't wait to make it again next summer!!!

This was easy and tasted good, but I couldnt get the crust to crisp up, I put it in the broiler but only the edges slightly crisped up-the under side stayed mushy.I couldnt get the "pea size crumbs" with the butter either, so maybe that was the problem. I am still searching for the perfect easy cobbler/crisp...

My sister and I made this last night with peaches/nectarines that were getting too soft, and our whole family (and neighbors) loved it! We made half the original recipe, and substitutions because we were afraid of so much white flour and sugar, so we ended up with the following: 5 peaches, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup all-pur. flour, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup packed brown sugar, pinch of salt, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, pinch of nutmeg, and a sliver less than 1 stick of butter. Did everything according to the recipe, but the measurements gave us too much topping and not enough fruit--we filled our glass gratin bowl, a tiny loaf pan, AND a small pie pan filled with a quickly chopped fuji apple. That's how much extra crisp topping we had, but the end result was such a wonderful hot crisp to go perfectly with vanilly ice cream. Thank you!

This is a fantastic and easy crisp topping. I substitute half of the white sugar with brown. 

The "fruit" variation that I use this on the most is Yam and peach. 

Cube 3 yams and soften in the microwave with some cinnamon and a few tablespoons of water. top with peaches (I use frozen).

I am so happy I found this recipe. People now think I can cook. :)

So easy! Double the cinnamon, add nutmeg, and sprinkle nuts, cinnamon, and honey over the top before baking.

VERY good. I tripled the peaches, and may actually quadruple them next time. There is a lot of crumble on top and it is VERY sweet, but my family  has a major sweet tooth and that was jt fine by us! I will make this again and again. I couldn't believe how easy it was. I dd have to throw it under the broiler for a couple minutes to get it to brown.

this was delicious. I had fresh peaches that needed used, in my oppinion, fresh is the only way to go! i did take some of the suggestions by other reviewers like adding the oats but i made it for my family and he took some to work in his lunch the next day, he then came home to tell me i had to make another one just for his coworkers!

I made this recipe once as is except I used fresh peaches instead of canned.  It turned out great and the peaches were soft and perfect.  The reason for the lower rating is the topping was very very sweet.  I would cut back on the sugar next time or at least double the amount of peaches I used.  It didn't turn out crispy until the next day.  The consistency is kind of like a soft cookie right from the oven that gets hard as it sits overnight.  Even though it was good, the texture was a little off for me.

My boyfriend loved this, but I wasn't thrilled.  I'm still going to have leftovers though!  First, as others suggested I bought two large cans of peaches just in case, and they were correct, you do need two cans to cover a 9X13 dish.  Also, there is a lot of topping, which takes a while to cook and still seemed doughy even after the top started to brown (350 for about an hour).  I added a handful of brown sugar and some cinnamon to the topping as well and topped it off with slivered almonds, which, thankfully added some nice texture.  Thank you for the recipe, as it was quick and easy and my boyfriend loved it!  I will be looking for alternate topping though.    PS:  It looks like this is a crisp!

I would use real peaches next time not canned ones as the juice there was bit to much juice, I used brown sugar sprinkled over the fruit and little cinnamon before the topping was put on.

Actually,  give no stars to this dessert.  I thought it was a waste of ingredients.  It was the sweetest, least enjoyable dessert I've made.  I might try it again with less sugar and less butter, but I can't promise I'll try it again.  How anyone rated this with 5 stars is beyond me.

I have made this twice so far...I added another can of peaches and sprinkled some vanilla on top, then added the crisp mixture....it's really good, but very sweet...next time I think I will cut the sugar by 1/2 cup...Oh!! and I left a little juice in the peaches, instead of draining them all the way. I took this to a party, with some French Vanilla ice cream and everyone loved it!

Very tasty.  I used 7 fresh organic peaches sliced thin, but I could have added about 4 more and it still would have been great.  I also added frozen raspberries.  Blueberries would have been good too.  Instead of all white flour, I did half whole wheat, half white.  Brown sugar could have been added too for a more carmel-y flavor.

This was ok, but not what I was looking for.  I was hoping for a nice crunchy topping, but this was like a peach upside down cake.    I changed the recipe a bit- I used  frozen (partially thawed) peaches and substituted sucanot for half the sugar.   The kids liked this, though.

Great recipe! Can tweek in many ways. I like to use 1 cup of sugar then use 1/2 cup brown sugar to sprinkle on top. Also plan on using 1 1/2 sticks of butter next time instead of 2. This was an unexpected hit at a party, Thank you! (unexpected b/c I always mess a recipe up!)

I used fresh peaches (left the skin on) and sprinkled them lightly with sugar.  I then added the topping but only used 1 1/2 cups of flour and added 1/2 cup oatmeal...it was fantastic!

I have to agree with others, the measurements are way off. The topping buried the peaches, which kind of messed up my dish because I marinated fresh peaches over night so I had to cut up a few extras, causing us to have "bland spots" throughout the dessert.  I am going to try it again tonight, but I will use more peaches and less topping.  Also, because fo all the topping, it takes longer to cook in the middle, so be prepared to spend a little more time in the kitchen.  Hope this helps someone.

Excellent, I used about 12 small/medium sized peaches (without skin) and 1/2 cup of granola.  It seemed like the flour mixture would be too much but it was perfect.  I'd like to reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup next time.  I baked for 40 minutes.

This came out quite nicely! I absolutely agree that this is a crisp rather than a cobbler. I may have added too much butter, or used the wrong butter (since Country Crock really isn't butter), because my crumbly mixture turned into a dough very quickly, and almost impossible to backpedal to correct. (BTW -- dough was yummy). In any case, good, simple recipe, with no milk (which is great!). I added a 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg; next time I'll try more. I will also use fresh peaches if I can. Thanks for a great recipe---it's a keeper!

I wanted to make something for my father today, as it's Father's day. Most of the peach recipies I found called for fresh peaches, and cornstarch. This recipe was easy to follow, and simple to make. I followed some of the other reviews and only made half the topping, and used more peaches than were required. Add cinamon to the top of your peaches, or nutmeg if you have it to give them an extra bit of flavor. Also, sprinkle cinnamon on the top, with just a little sugar (I used the raw crystals for that), tastes amazing.

I needed 2 15 oz. cans of peaches and the topping quantities should be halved.  It was ok and probably would've been better if the measurements were more accurate.

I cooked this for a 4th of July BBQ, and everyone raved about it! It's so easy to make that I actually had my two friends make it while I got everything else ready. I used two varieties of 7 fresh peaches that weren't fully ripe, so added a little more sugar than called for. I topped with brown sugar and served with vanilla ice cream of course! Some of my friends found it a bit too sweet and buttery for their liking, so you may want to cut down if you're not too crazy about sugar, but I liked it as is. Keeper for sure!

This was awesome!  I used fresh peaches, picked that day, half white and half brown sugar and added a cup of quick oats.  I also sprinkled my peaches with a little brown and white sugar to help make a syrup.  My family loved it.  Absolutely delicious.

I thought this was good, but definitely was not the "best". It needs some tweaking, as I made it as written and the peaches just seemed bland to me. Perhaps a good sprinkling of brown sugar and cinnamon over the peaches prior to adding the crust topping would do the trick?! Adding vanilla ice cream or whipped cream would be a great addition to this as well!

I was unable to get the top layer of the "crisp" to stick together using the butter. I also missed the texture that adding oats offers.

This was very simple and very delicious.  I used fresh peaches (and followed someones suggestion to mix them w/ a bit of brown sugar)  I had fresh blueberries in the fridge that needed to be used, so I threw them in too.  This was absolutely delicious.  The only thing I found was it needed to be baked longer to get the topping more browned, but that was no problem.  Took it to a friends cabin and brought back a very empty pan and many compliments.

The word "crisp" is very misleading.  I was hoping the crust would have a crunch to it, instead it's a very chewy breading.  The warm peaches are a delicious treat when paired with ice cream. But overall disapointing:(

I made this recipe for my bridge club.  Most of us left a lot of the topping, it was too much and too sweet.  I had added an extra half can of peaches and could probably have added all of the second can as there was still too much of the topping.  I liked that it was easy to make but I would not try it again.

Quick, easy and delicious. It makes a lot which is good, as hubby and I are looking forward to the leftovers today. I kept it in the oven for about 50 minutes. Thanks.

I added 1/2 cup of oatmeal and 1/2 cup brown sugar to the topping as suggested by: SHADYB.
2 15 oz cans did not even cover the 13x9 pan so I added another can. There was alot of the dry topping, and after cooking it for the 40 mins it was still floury and only the edges had "dissolved". It was not edible at that stage. So I poured the peach liquid on top and cooked for another 10 mins. It was not crispy at all, but flavor was good.

Made this tonight using two jars of peaches...but the large wide mouth mason jars with home canned peaches, so I'm not sure on size but it was definitely enough to cover the dish with one layer. It still wasn't browning nicely after 40 minutes so I stuck it under the broiler. I was worried that the "crisp" still wasn't done but after one taste my fears were assauged. This stuff is good and I can't wait to have over vanilla ice cream. The only reason I didn't give if 5 stars is it's a little grainy and that's being VERY picky. All in all an excellent flavor and it's nice to feel like we're having a little summer in January.

This was good.  I would use a little bit less sugar.  Make sure that the topping is really 'pea-sized' since larger pieces are too chunky.

This was fantastic!! The crust is super rich, but my family thought that was great. I had fresh peaches so I just sliced up 6 peaches, mixed with 1/3 c sugar and 2 T lemon juice and let sit for 15 minutes. I also added cinnamon and allspice to the crust. So yummy!

Very good! I changed very little, I used frozen peaches and added an extra stick of butter, that I melted in the iron skillet before adding the peaches. I coated the peaches in the butter and an extra 1/2 cup of sugar added the crumble, tossed and baked it in the iron skillet. The result was carmelized edges and bottom, I will make this again, the boys loved it.

YUMMY! I followed the recipe exactly except for using fresh peaches. I thought there would be too much "crisp" when I was putting it in the pan, but it baked down and is perfect. I'll be making this again with our next batch of peaches.

This recipe is very easy. I made it for a dinner party, and the entire thing was devoured, even though the party only had six people and I made 24 servings. The one thing I did differently from the recipe was that I used fresh peaches instead of canned. I ended up using about 10 peaches. Also, my oven may have been weaker than average, but 40 minutes was not enough. I would leave it in for 45-50 minutes.

This was incredible!  I did modify it just a bit as I used fresh peaches (about 6) and it made 2 8 1/2 inch pies.  I also used margarine and separated it and used 1/4 cup near the last 10 minutes of cooking to drizzle over the crisp.  I then topped it with 1/2 tbsp of brown sugar.  Delicious:)

To quote my husband, "This is the best peach thing I have ever had. It may even be the best thing made with fruit that I have ever eaten." I used fresh peaches and it was fabuous.

I was so excited to find an easy peach crisp but I was disappointed with the amounts and end result.  As others have said, there is WAY to much topping.  I added a second can of peaches to the 9x13 pan and still had enough topping to make two more 8x8 cherry cobblers.  Yes, this is a cobbler not a crisp.  Mine also did not brown after 45 min. of cooking so I put it under the broiler for 3 min. and that finally did the trick!  I wish I had stuck with my tried and true crisp topping made with the oats.  It would have made all of the difference to be a crisp.  I also should have added something to the peaches like nutmeg, etc. before adding the topping.  I ended up with three desserts out of this but not as tasty as a true peach crisp.  I will not make again.

I'm not sure what 29 oz cans of peaches are like in other areas of the country, but I could only fill an 8X8 container with what came out of mine.  Because of that, I ended up throwing out about half of the topping.  I also had issues with this browning, so I put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes.  I think I will make this again, but will consider using frozen peaches or perhaps leaving some of the juice in from the canned peaches.

I tried this twice as written.  I have no idea why but the top didn't crisp up, it was just dry ingredients sitting on the top, and yes I used two sticks of butter.  Won't waste the ingredients to try it again.

This was really good! I added 1 cup of oats to the recipe and also used have the white sugar called for and used brown to make up the difference. I also made it in two 8x8x2 dishes and used one large can of peaches in each so I could give one of the dishes to a friend.  My hubby really loved it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side.

Great, easy, crisp for out of season cravings. However, either double the recipe for a 13x9, or make this recipe in an 8x8, because as posted, there's not enough fruit or topping.

Only used 1/2 cup of butter because that's all I had.  I made up the difference in liquid by adding a few tablespoons of the canned peach syrup-I knew I set it aside for a reason!  Came out beautifully!

I took some advice from other reviews. I cut the sugar and added brown sugar. 1/2 can extra peaches and vanilla. We had it for Christmas desert, It didn't last long.

Delicious! My family (even my Mother-in Law) loved it! It was sooooo easy. The only modification I made was that I decreased the white sugar by 1/2 cup and added  1/2 cup of dark brown sugar. I actually used frozen nectarines instead of peaches, but I don't think that made much difference. I would recommend this recipe anytime you need something quick and easy.

This is so good.  Just made it and had some hot from the oven with a little bit of vanilla ice cream on top totally divine!  Easy to make, I used fresh peaches, with a little brown sugar and  cinnamon mixed with the peaches. on crumble I sprinkled a little nutmeg.  Will be making this again and again.

I loved the taste of this, although for me there was too much topping, I could have doubled the peaches and the pan size and it would have been perfect. The crisp was really easy to make , I did add a little cinnimon to the peaches and used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I will definately make this again.

My parents brought us a huge bag of peaches back from their vacation.  I logged onto this site and found this WONDERFUL recipe.  It was easy.  I had all the ingredients handy and it turned out great.  Thanks so much!

My husband has been searching for a crispy peach cobbler, and we finally found what we're looking for!  This recipe is a keeper.  We used about 4 large fresh peaches.  It took approximately 37 minutes to cook, and was well worth it.  We served it to some guests, and they absolutely loved it.  Will definitely make again!  Yummy!

Very good! It was my first time making it. I used a 9x6 pan and made 1/2 the amount of topping with a full can of peaches. I added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 cup of sugar to the peaches and let it set. This made a much richer filling! Next time I will make it with fresh peaches!

I never thought I'd say this, but there was too MUCH topping!  Not because I don't like topping, but because I physically couldn't fit more than 1/2 of it on top.  But it was delcious.  And I like this non-oaty topping a lot.

Fantastic!  I made this tonight for a dinner party/potluck, and it was a big hit.  I made it exactly as described, with fresh peaches (not peeled), as they are in season.  I baked it for 40 minutes and served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  It gets 5 stars for how quick & easy it is, and for its great taste!!

Very easy to make. Seemed a little sweet for me so I would suggest putting cool whip or vanilla ice cream on top.

This is a great and very easy recipe. Tastes fantastic. The people that added a ppound of butter must not have cooked or used a recipe before because the recipe clearly states add 1 cup butter.

It looks as if the recipe has been fixed.  What was 1 pound(!) of butter is not 1 cup of butter and the size of the can of peaches has been specified.  I cooked this with fresh peaches and a little more cinnamon than asked for.  It is cooling right now!  Let me try the first bite.......  Mmmm mmmm good.. A good quick easy dessert you can cook with very common ingredients.

There must be a mistake with this recipe because one can of peaches only covers about 1/4 of the pan bottom, and a POUND of butter leaves you with a big pan of melted butter over a few peaches.  I had to throw this out!!!

AMAZING! I used 3 fresh peaches and halved the recipe. I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and added 1/2 cup of quick cooking oats. It ended up cooking ~40 min and came out absolute perfection! A little vanilla ice cream on top and it doesn't get better than that. I can't wait to eat more tomorrow.

I modified this at the suggestion of others. I used 10 baseball-sized fresh peaches for a 8 x 13, 2 c flour, 3/4 c white and 3/4 c brown sugar, 1 c slow-cook oats, 1T cinnamon, and 3/4 c butter. I didn't think the topping got very crispy; probably because of the decreased amount of butter. I'll add more next time and cut back on the flour. Otherwise, it was a hit! Took it to a party and everyone loved it.

This was pretty good. I also couldn't get the top into pea-sized crumbles, but it's a tasty treat. It's a bit buttery, but my kids and I are enjoying it.

I made this today as a special treat for Mother's Day and it was one of the easiest and tastiest desserts I have ever made.  I used the large can of peaches, but halved all of the topping ingredients because I couldn't bring myself to use 2 whole sticks of butter. I used a 9 inch round baking dish and the topping was piled high even after cutting the recipe in half. I served it with vanilla bean ice cream and my husband and I loved it! It's like eating peach pie without the hassle of rolling out a crust.

This crisp was yummy.  I used 3 jars of peaches and added boysenberries.  In the topping I used 1cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I was very tasty.  I am not sure how anyone could use 29 oz of peaches in a 9 x 13, 3 24.5 oz bottles was the perfect amount.  I also don't know how this recipe was to feed 24 servings.  It is closer to 12 - 14 servings.  I will use this recipe again.

This recipe has an amazing taste!  Thank you for sharing it with us :)  I followed everything except I added 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 brown instead of just the 1 1/2 cup white sugar.  Everyone loved it and wanted thirds!   I will make it again and again!!!!

Great and easy recipe.  I used extra peaches and it turned out delicious.  My husband just informed me that he has finished about half of the dish in the last hour. I won't tell him how much butter is in it. I am sure it's not complimenting his diet.

I used fresh peaches and blueberries. The fruit was a bit tart so the extra crispy stuff was just the right thing to balance it out.  I had lots of fruit to I doubled the recipe, substituted 1 cup of flour with steel cut oatmeal and reduced the sugar And butter a little.This ones a keeper!

This was exactly what I wanted & SO easy! I used 5 fresh peaches, brown sugar, flour, and 1 1/2 sticks of butter (ended up being PLENTY of butter).  It looked weird to me at first, like the topping wasn't mixed well enough w/ the butter... but I mixed up a little bit after it'd warmed up for a few minutes & it turned out great.  I really don't think you could mess this up.

This needed more peaches than the recipe calls for.   Instead of almond extract (I'm allergic) I added vanilla, cinnamon, a squeeze of orange juice and a bit of flour to the peaches.  I made the crisp with half flour and half oatmeal, which I thought was great.  Next time I will double the cinnamon and add half of the amount of sugar it called for--This was entirely too sweet.\

This was sooo god but was really crispy, I mean that there so so much crisp and not a whole lot of peaches.  I have made twice now and the second time I cut the topping in half and used a 9 inch round corning dish.  It turned out so much better. When I make it a third time I will keep the crisp topping as the original but add a second can of peaches!

So good and so easy to make.  It really makes home-made dessert accesible to busy people.  Yes, it's crispy, buttery and yes, it's sweet, but everything in moderation, right? :) Thanks Katigar!  Also, I tried it with crushed nuts (any kind) added to the topping, and it's fab.  Stairmaster, anyone? Cause I just ate the whole pan.

This is a recipe I have been searching for for 5 years! All I remembered about it was that it had a crisp topping that didn't have any oats in it. If you are a fruit lover, you may want to add a bit more, but for my family of topping-lovers, this was perfect. A definite keeper! Almost more delicious than should be legal!

This was good, but a few suggestions. First I would add another can or so of peaches and if you don't add another can cut down on the topping. Second I would add another half stick of butter to the topping.

I made this for company and everyone enjoyed it!  I used two 16 oz. bags of frozen peaches which I sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar.  I reduced the topping amount to the equivalent of 18 servings and added about a half cup of brown sugar and a half cup of oatmeal.  The peaches were partially thawed; I ended up cooking it for close to an hour.

The cobbler topping is excellent! When I use fresh apples I and add some spices to the mixture before baking. I also cut the cobbler topping recipe in half. I have used this also with wild blueberry pie filling! 

A NO FAIL NO COMPLAINT PERFECT COMBINATION!!! 

Plan on a few extra minutes cook time for conventional oven.

This was delicious! My husband said without a doubt it was the best peach crisp he's ever had.  I used 8 large, fresh peaches (peeled) but may use even more next time, they're so good.  I put a squeeze of fresh lemon over the peaches before adding the topping.  Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe!

This recipe is so easy and I love that it calls for things I already have in my kitchen.  I think it is great with a lot of cinnamon (I put about a tablespoon).  It also works well with fresh peaches you don't even have to skin them, just slice enough to cover the bottom of the pan. Fabulous with whipped cream, vanilla ice cream or both.  Thanks for the yummy recipe.

This was terrific Katigar.  With minimal effort and inexpensive ingredients, I would definitely make this again.  I did have my butter at room temp rather than cold.  Since I don't have food processor, I have to mix this kind of stuff by hand and it's easier if the butter is softened.  I baked this in a pyrex casserole dish and used 2 cans of peaches.  I suggest draining them well because I did have some "crust" that was under cooked due to some juice but the overall taste was good!  Thanks for sharing.

I had to add an extra can of peaches (thank goodness I had some on hand) because the one can hardly covered the bottom of the dish.  Other than that it was pretty good.  My husband took it to work and the guys loved it.  I might make this again but maybe experiment a little with it.  It's a quick dessert when you're in a pinch for something.

Very good dessert.  Everyone enjoyed it, including my 7 month old. Good taste and easy to make.

I substituted 1 cup of flour for 1 cup of oatmeal and it was delicious! I also used 6 large FREASH peaches.

I read reviews & then also split sugar between white & brown.  I also made 3/4 of topping, & in the end 1/2 of topping would have been more than enough.  I used fresh peaches from my trees, so they were peeled with lots of impurities cut out.  I will definitely make again!  (who needs peach pie when this is even better & easier!)  The only downside was lots of juice in the bottom after taking a piece out.  Perhaps some corn starch mixed in with the peaches would help next time.

I used the basic temp, time and recipe with my own dietary substitutions: brown rice flour for reg, olive oil for butter, and fresh peaches for canned.  I all worked out beautifully.

Fabulous! I used fresh peaches; no need to take the skins off. They were really large peaches, four cut up filled a 9 x 13 pan. I use a food processor to make the topping. Everyone loved it; added a dollop of whipped cream.

This had so much "crust" that you could hardly get to the peaches.  It didn't not come out even remotely crispy but more like cake dough.  It could have been my fault but I followed the receipt to the letter.  Will not try this one again.

It was a very simple easy recipie that yielded great results! The mixture sprinkled on top came out very crispy and crunchy even though I didn't drain the peaches. I followed the instructions exactly except I used brown sugar and cut back on cinnamon. I was tired of making time consuming desserts but still wanted to make something with my peaches, and this recepie was just the thing! I'll definitely make this again.

Made this for a meeting snacks at work and it was a big hit. This is a great way to use canned peaches especially if you shop at a big box store. I did add a drizzle of pureed berries from the garden over the peaches.

This was amazing. My husband doesn't like peaches at all but I had him try it and he loved it! I did make only half a batch and I added nutmeg and used a little less sugar. Can't wait to make it again!

I also had issues with the crust crisping. I baked it for 40 mins at 350 and it was no where near being cooked. Then had to increase the temp to 400 for 15 more mins. The end result was a perfectly crisp crust but my peaches were over cooked. Next time I will increase the temp to start with.

This recipe did not call for enough peaches to fill the bottom of the pan.  You would need two 29oz cans.

This is very good.  I agree with other reviewers and used a lot more peaches.  I was using home canned peaches, so I don't know exactly how it compares to regular canned ones.  It makes a lot of topping, but since I added more peaches, I was fine with that.  Not surprisingly, it took me a lot longer than 10 minutes to get this ready since the butter needed to be blended in correctly to get the crispiness.

Totally loved this recipe! A hit every time I made it although I cut down the sugar to create a 2 : 1 ratio for flour to sugar. Really yummy especially with the ice cream!

Very easy, I had my 13 year-old throw it together before heading out to a get-together with friends. Their ended up being a lot of crust for not enough peaches. I think I'll make sure the crust is covered with peaches next time, no matter how many it takes:)

I modified this a bit, used 2 ripe pears (should have used more), 1/2 cup all purpose flour, just less than 1/2 cup almond meal. about 1/2 cup brown sugar almost 1 tablespoon cinnamon and 3/8 cup butter. Cooked it in a 5x8 pan in a toaster oven on 350 for 30minutes and then right before serving heated it on broil. Turned out great and the top was just a little crispy.

Delicious and easy. I made this for my Mother-in-Law's Birthady and served it warm with vanilla ice cream. I added the cinammon to the peach mix and also added a small package of fresh raspberries. I did have to cook for a while longer until the crumble part browned, but it was well worth the wait. All ingredients the same. Definitely a keeper. In fact I just emailed this to my Mother-in-law b/c everyone thought it was so tasty.

True to it's name, this dish was very easy to prepare, as well as scrumptious! I took the idea to add oatmeal and added a cup, but only used 1 and a 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour. I also only used a cup of sugar and added a half teaspoon of powdered stevia extract to get extra sweetness without the extra calories. It turned out wonderful! I will be making this again. And again. :)

This is quick, easy and tastes great.  I used two 29 oz cans of peaches and a 10x15 inch pan after reading other reviews and it still had plenty of topping.  Thanks for sharing!  I will definitely make again and again!

I've only made this recipe once and with the changes I made I gave it a 5* rating. I had fresh peaches so I sauteed them with equal parts of butter and sugar, just until fork tender. Then I added about a cup of fresh raspberries on top of the cooled peaches. I also added some oats to the crumble mixture. Made it for a party of 12 and everyone loved it!

Very tasty! I wanted more peaches, though. Next time I'll double the amount of peaches, and drain them really well.

I rated this recipe 4 stars because of the ease of the preparation and the taste.  I also loved the fact that it didn't require any special ingredients, only things I already had on hand.  I added nutmeg, 1/2 c oatmeal, and 1/2 c of brown sugar, like others suggested.  I actually sort of messed the receipe up and started to mix the peaches in with the flour, but I added a sprinkle of sugar to the floured peaches and then added the rest of the topping, and it still turned out delicious!  Would definitely make again - and the right way next time.

This is a GREAT recipe!  I followed the directions exactly except that I added a dash of nutmeg.  The only thing I'll do different next time would be to use more peaches.  This topping would be great for dutch apple pie too.

I'm an inexperienced cook who has limited items in my pantry, but I had canned peaches. One evening I wanted to make a dish for a social event. It was my first time baking a crisp like this so I didnt know how it'd turn out. I felt hesitant to place my dish amongst all the store bought items on the table. Afterward, there were alot of left-over storebought food but this peach crisp was GONE! People were shocked when I said that it was my first time making it because it was so good. That was a huge boost to my cooking ego! Thanks for the super easy recipe!

This tasted good but you definitely need more than 30 minutes for this. I would say at least an hour.

This has a really good flavor.  Shortbread with peaches is a good description.  It didn't turn golden brown in the 40 minutes so I gave it a few more and then gave up because I didn't want to dry it out or over cook it.  This gets 4 stars because it's easy, inexpensive and tastes good.
