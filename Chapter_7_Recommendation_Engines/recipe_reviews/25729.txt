This was very good and easy to make but the first time we made the mistake of pureeing the whole soup. It made it too thin. The next time we purreed only half the soup. It is better with a little more chunkyness to it.

Can't figure out for the life of me why people send in a so-called review that ends up with numerous revisions or a completely different recipe.  If you want to submit a recipe just do it....don't bash others' recipes.

This soup was so simple and quick to make, and it tasted fantastic, equal to something I would expect at a restaurant. I followed the recipe except that I added cubed cheddar cheese. I pureed the soup with my hand blender until it was fairly smooth, and it turned out great! Everyone who tried it loved it.

I'm not a huge fan of using processes American cheese so I used a powdered cheese instead and my wife loved it. (She is the connoisseur of Broccoli soup). I thought it was good also. A better way to salvage what is left of our hearts is to use FAT FREE 1/2 & 1/2 and you can not taste the difference!

I give this 5 stars!  The recipie was very basic & filling.  The only thing I changed was I used 1/3c of heavy whipping cream in lieu of the other dairy (didn't want to trudge back out to the store) I also brought some to work and my co-workers tried it and loved it

Pretty easy to make! Very tasty! I also added some leftover rice (from chinese take out) to the mix and added a bit more chicken broth to make it thicker. Will be making this again for sure. Big hit with 12 year old son and husband :)

I followed the recipe to the letter.  At the beginning, I thought, "Hey, despite the recipe, I should really use a roux."  Well, darn me for not listening to myself because my soup was like veggie cheerios in cheese milk.  I added flour.  Nothing. I let it simmer longer, nothin'.  I'm disappointed.

This is a great recipe, if you make it to thin by pureeing you can add a corn starch/water mix as a thickener. This made it a great consistency.

Loved the soup but made it a lot more interesting using 300 G of Gorgonzola cheese and using just enough (sour) cream to decorate the bowls...doesn't need all that cream

This soup is amazing and simple to make. The only thing I did different was chopped extra carrots and broccoli and onion and I chopped them kind of chunky. I also use an entire 32 ounce brick of velveeta cheese! Sooooo good!

Surprisingly easy and delicious.  A good way to sneak broccoli into my kids' lunches.  I served it also at a baby shower and none of the grownups would have guessed it wasn't made with shredded cheddar and a roux.

I followed the recipe for the most part with the exception of using sharp cheddar. I did spoon out the majority of the chunks and put them through the food processor. It was thinner than I thought but when I pulled it out for leftovers today it was perfect and tasted even better than last night!   Will make again!

Just made, delish!  I can see how easy the cheese will stick to the bottom of the pan.  Keep the heat low and once everything is heated thru it's done,turn off the heat.  Add a cornstarch roux in between step 1 and step 2 and more cheese. Yumm!!!

Made this tonight and it was DELICIOUS!  I had to tweak it a bit since I did not have processed cheese on hand, I used two cups of shredded Colby-Jack cheese and heavy cream instead of half-n-half.  Once the veggies were ready I purred everything in the blender in three batches, I returned it to the pot, added the heavy cream that I had left out to get to room temperature, and added the shredded cheese.  I let it simmer on low for another ten minutes and then it was time to enjoy!  Thanks for the recipe Jeanie!

This is a great recipe!  I made it with beef broth, used more broccoli and cheese, added some Cavenders, and added flour water at the end.  We loved it!

Thanks for a delicious easy broccoli cheese soup. Iâ€™m a keto eater and most broccoli soup recipes are made with a roux. I made the soup as listed except the carrots (too many added carbs) itâ€™s a little thin but an easy trade off for my diet. I saw a couple of reviews that mentioned salt....taste before you salt, the broth and cheese added plenty of salt for my taste.

I love broccoli cheese soup, provided it isn't overwhelmed with cheese.  This one has a good balance.  The seasonings are simple and offer flexibility for customization, but it is incredibly delicious exactly as is.  I'm about to make more, and can hardly wait!  I don't have any type of blender so I just mashed it some with a potato masher, which worked well enough.

This was delicious, but wanted a little more cheese flavor so I doubled what the recipe called for. I also used my immersion blender after cooking the veggies but I should have taken more care not to over blend the broccoli so that there were some chunks. Again, both of these changes were for my own taste and my comments are more for my own future reference as much as anything.

Very good and simple recipe, perfect for after work on 2nd shift at 2am. Most people seem to want their soup thicker. I thought it might be thin as well so I only used about 1-1/2 cup of broth more or less steaming the broccoli. I also didn't have any carrots so left them out, carrots would need more time to cook anyway. I pureed in a vitamix blender starting on low then turned the dial up to about 3 or 4 just long enough to pull the broccoli down through the blades about 2-3 seconds. Made the perfect chunky consistency soup.

So I know it irks some people when a review is written and the chef makes changes to the recipe-if that is you then read no further. I like a soup that is not just broth, so I added carrots, some broccoli pieces and mushrooms after I pureed most of the broccoli. The only issue I had was my cheese didn't melt all the way and so I had some cheese lumps in the soup.(I didn't use processed cheese product; I used a combo of sharp and mild shredded cheddar cheese.) Soup had a great flavor, so I will try this again but need to figure out how to avoid the cheese lumps :)
