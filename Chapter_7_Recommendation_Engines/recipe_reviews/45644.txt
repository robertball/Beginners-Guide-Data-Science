This is a very good main dish that doesnt include meat, but a whole lot of flavor. I found that  baking it at a higher temp, 375, and for a little longer, 20 minutes total, you can really get a more heartier taste. 

Overall, two thumbs up! Thanks!

I thought the flavor was great a bit too much red pepper next time I will add Zuchini and yellow squash in place of some of the red pepper.

If you love veggie's (esp. roasted), this is divine!  Beautiful, tasty, healthy.  I made enough to last for two more lunches, and I'm so glad.   Of course I modified according to what I had on hand. Subbed crimini for portabella (divine!) Omited tomato Omited tapenade. Added a little sea salt and black pepper. Used bow tie pasta.

The flavor of the veggies is much more interesting when you roast them on the grill.  And basil pesto works really well in lieu of the tapenade.

I love roasted veggies and this was a great way to use them. I did add other veggies too- was great with squash,onion,asparagus,shrooms,red pepper and baby carrots. Tapenade I had was a bit sour so will try another brand.

My carnivore hubby and I both agreed that is was amazing.  I sliced up cauliflower, broccolli, asparagus, tomatoes, red peppers, onions and summer squash, then drizzled the veggies with EVOO and minced garlic before roasting (I agree with the other reviewers - 20 minutes minimum!)  I could only find penne pasta in the multi grain version, so that's what I cooked.  When the noodles were hot, I scooped them into a bowl, put a dollup of smart balance butter on top, then threw the hot veggies on top of that and tossed everything until the butter disappeared.  I WILL be making this again.  It was wonderful!

Tapenade is easy to make: pureed or finely chopped olives, capers, anchovies and good olive oil.  Good side w/grilled pork loin!

Wanted a fresh vegetable pasta dish to go with our Easter ham and this hit the spot!! I did not use mushrooms as son is not a fan, but did add onion, and grape tomatoes instead of quartered regular tomato.  We liked it so much I made it again last night to go with some chicken breasts I baked at the same time.  I too would like to add zucchini, and will try the mushrooms when son is not here for dinner.  Will be a new regular in the rotation for go-to side dishes, or even a light entree!!

I made this recipe back at the holidays and what a great dish!  I roasted the asparagus and mushrooms with zucchini and summer squash cut in medium size chunks.  I also made fresh tapenade of greek, black olives, capers, anchovies, garlic and olive oil and trust me when I say - it makes all the difference in the world.  I thought I made enough for leftovers, but when my family of 5 went back for thirds - leftovers were out of the question!

I have made something very similar using whatever grilled veggies I have left after parties.  Eggplant, zucchini and oven roasted tomatoes have been great additions.  I usually drizzle a bit of olive oil before serving to prevent a dry dish.  Especially good with infused oils.  A bit of chopped basil or flat leaf parsley before serving hits it home.  Can't stand oregano.  Makes a good-tasting dish taste like cheap pizza.

This is very good, thank you! I agree with Nick D that you should roast the veggies for 20 minutes at 375. I used one red pepper and half of a yellow pepper, two zucchini squashes, farfalle, and mozzarella instead of parm, but otherwise stayed true to the ingredient list. I added capers to the finished product, which really complemented the tapenade nicely. I also added a little more cheese and tapenade than specified to really give the dish a zing. It tasted great! We'll be making this one again. Also, the leftovers are delicious served cold the next day, so make extra!

We have a vegetarian in the family and are always on the lookout for new recipes.  We're not huge rosemary or oregano fans, so used honey and a bit of balsamic vinegar to flavor the veggies.  Love the recipe and it's so easy to create variations by changing out the veggies.  Thanks, Nick D. for the recommendation to bake at the higher 375 temp.  Will give it a try next time.

I like roasted veggies that have some color and caramelization.  The trick to that is to heat your baking sheet in the oven and make sure it is sizzling hot before you put the veggies in and toss the veggies after 10 or 12 minutes.  I always roast veggies at 400 to 425.  Also heating unpeeled garlic cloves in a medium high heated skillet works quickly and gives the garlic a smokey flavor and the skin comes off easily.  The papery skins will get dark brown.  
I added more fresh herbs including basil and made a bit more olive oil mixture to toss the pasta in.  

Less peppers and greater variety of veggies.  
A good base recipe.

I agree with Nick D and somewhat with Amanda E.  Roasted vegetables need longer in the oven to develop a good flavor.  Amanda says it's "plain"; I would rephrase that to "a little bland".  The essentials of the recipe are excellent; it just needs some kick to it.  I add a generous amount of a delicious salt-free seasoning mix available at my local dollar store (really!)  It has wonderful flavor including lemon rind and a little touch of hot pepper flakes.  I don't know what else, but it's yummy!  I would definitely add a modest amount of salt.  And just a hint - when roasting vegetables I've learned they do better if you dump them all in a plastic bag, pour in your oil and seasonings and shake before putting them on your cookie sheet to roast.  It makes quite a difference in the end result.  We LOVE roasted vegetables as well as pasta so this will be made often in our house.

I loved this recipe. Husband thought it "too dry", and he had a point.  Adding some light Italian dressing would help (he wanted me to add asiago cheese sauce--there goes the "healthy"!)  Also, to avoid a hasty end of prep, I would chop the veggies early and seal them in a baggie in the fridge....that way, you don't have to do it all at the end.  Good recipe, healthy.

First, cutting off the half inch end of asparagus will leave a woody part that won'd cook; you break asparagus by holding both ends and bending it until it breaks between the tender and woody parts.  Discard the woody parts.  Next, there are no "written" instruction about baking the garlic as in the video.  However, if you roast the garlic 35 minutes, like she said, you will have "rocks".  I wasted a bulb finding that out.  Had to start over.  It was okay but I won't be saving it into my favorites.

Made it tonight. Made a few modifications. I added onion and zucchini to the roasted veg medley and I sautéd 2 Italian Sausage links (cut into bit size pieces) and a pound of shrimp.  It's a keeper but I'm sure I'll keep playing with the ingredients.

This was a simply, healthy and tasty.  I did what a another viewer suggested and cooked the vegetables at 375 for 25 minutes and then hit broil for the last 5 minutes to get them a little "browning".  I didn't have roasted garlic, so I added fresh garlic and let it roast with the vegetables.  The fresh rosemary makes the flavor of the dish... I also added some fresh basil.  We added shrimp, because my family thinks I'm crazy when I try to serve them anything without meat.  The shrimp worked well and kept the dish low cal.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing we will make this again!

Yummy!  Used lots of fresh garlic, mushrooms, onions, orange peppers, tofu cubes and broccoli.  I also increased oven temp to 375.  Served sauce on the side.  Excellent quick dinner.  Elegant enough for guests.  Use whatever veggies you have on hand. The tapenade was great with it.

Made it exactly but added onions. IDK - just missing a whole lot of taste even with the fresh oregano and rosemary. Certainly a healthy choice. Oh - and 1 hour to chop all of the fresh ingredients.

It was very good I will make it again.I did add yellow squash and cherry tomatoes . Gave it a four star because of the cooking time not being enough. Twenty minutes at 375 like other people have said would have been much better.

I could not find the tapenade so that was the one ingredient that I missed in this recipe. I am unsure of this was the reasoning but the dish was very bland. The family wasn’t too happy with it.

I made it as written and it was kind of bland. The next time I made it I omitted the mushrooms, Used 1/2 onion, 1/2 pound of asparagus, 1 yellow squash, 1 zucchini, 6 baby carotts cut in strips, 1/2 red bell pepper. I seasoned 1/4 cup of olive oil with 1 T Italian seasoning, 1 t kosher salt, 1/2 t fresh ground black pepper. Mixed the vegetables in a bowl and spread them on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. I roasted at 400 degrees for 10 minutes added 15 cherry tomatoes and stirred the mixture again and roasted for 10minutes more then stirred the mixture into a bowl of hot rice.

I had high hopes for this from the reviews, but I thought it was very bland. I won’t be making it again. Roasted veggies on their own are fine.

Very good & filling. I roasted a sliced fennel bulb, 3 large carrots, 2 shallots, vidalia onion, fresh broccoli, fresh asparagus, mushrooms, grape tomatoes, tossed in avocado oil, dried rosemary, dried parsley & basil, garlic powder, salt & pepper at 400F for about 3/4 hour or until tender & carmelized. I cooked some corkscrew pasta al dente, drained it, saved a bit of pasta water for further use. Tossed the pasta with black olive tapenade, some pasta water, Parmesan cheese ,added the roasted vegetables, mixed all together, served with a sprinkle of added Parmesan. I really enjoyed it & will make again. I used different vegetables than listed but I had so many that needed to be used up. I got 6 servings of roasted veg & 6 cups of cooked pasta. Lots of leftovers for tomorrow. I read one review where it was good hot or cold. The olive tapenade is quite salty so didn’t add any extra , except sea salt  in the pasta water. Thanks for the recipe to follow, will make again. Will try some leftovers cold tomorrow to see if it will be a good recipe to take to a potluck BBQ.

We made it...well my husband made it and we missed a couple ingredients  (oregano-we forgot  & tapenade-we couldn't find) maybe those to lost ingredients would have given us a completed dish. He said it was okay, I didnt care for it but  still finished my plate.

There is no way the vegetables will be done in 15 minutes.  Does anyone in your test kitchen actually cook these dishes.  I find a lot of your recipes need something else. I love vegetables and we eat a great variety of them.  But I do not like them raw.

I did make a few changes, but the basics stayed the same.  I did bake it at 375 for 20 minutes, too.  I used asparagus, but I don't know how much.  It turned out fine.  I used a half tomato, half onion and some baby carrots.  I also used 4 oz of canned mushrooms and frozen broccoli.  I added some basil and 12 black olives cut in half instead of the tapenade.  I have been looking for some good vegetable recipes and this one is GREAT!  I love how flexible it seems to be!  I will definitely make this again!  Thanks to this website, I feel like I really can cook!

Made this and was skeptical that my family would like it, but they loved it.  I used other veggies such as onions, zucchini, yellow squash.  I also used pesto instead of the tapenade as I didn't have any.  
Will definitely make again.

It was 50 mins total to roast (35for clove garlics and 15 with the rest of the vegies) and that is not including the fettuccini, so cooking time is not 30 mins. However it was worth it:) we liked it, except for a couple who added salsa...Lol. kids:) Next time be easier:) And because the fettuccini I used were 300calories per 85g, I got to fill up on vegies:)

This was awesome.  I thought it would just be a healthy dish that I would tolerate for the sake of health.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Satisfying and delicious.  
I couldn't find tapenade so I made my own with equal parts olive spread (kalmata), capers (slightly crushed), and anchovy paste. I also used dried spices to save some $$.

Tried this recipe and we loved it, even my husband who is a meat eater (and I grill salmon for him) and my daughter can do without the tomatoes (which I omitted).  I used what I had in my pantry which was spaghetti.  I used vegetables in the original recipe the first time.  The second time I omitted the mushrooms, added onions, zucchini and summer yellow squash. We never heard of tapenade until the video so I did not incorporate it in the recipe.   Each time it gets better and better.  I roasted the veggies at 425 degrees and added water from the pasta and olive oil when I tossed pasta.  Delicious

Excellent, healthy meal.   The only change I made was add a few different veggies on top of what the recipe called for and couldn't find regular tapanade, so I bought a green olive, tomato, garlic and red pepper tapanade and then added anchovies to that and then used my wand mixer to blend it all together.  Will definitely be making this again.

This was AWESOME.  I thought it would be too much red pepper, but after roasting it was fine.  I turned up the oven to about 400 degrees and roasted the vegetables a little longer than the recipe called for.  I put the tapenade and parmesan on the side since not all of my family likes these ingredients.  Even without these, it was very tasty and soooo aromatic.

Great veggie pasta! I added a sliced zucchini and made my own tapenade.

This really tastes like a true Italian dish - simple to prepare and delicious. Difficult to mix the veg with the fettucini if you make larger amounts though - farfalle are easier. But nicer with fettucini. Make sure you use fresh and quality ingredients. ,

We like roasted veggies, especially asparagus and bell pepper. But this was lacking flavor, and I even tossed the veggies in garlic-infused olive oil. My husband flat out did not like it and said so. It needs some"punch", maybe more seasonings or something??? Will not make again.
