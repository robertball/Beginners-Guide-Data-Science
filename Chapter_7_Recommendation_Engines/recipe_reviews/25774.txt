I used fresh pineapple - maybe too much because the top layer came out too gooey even though the bottom was firm (or perhaps it needed an extra 5 minutes in the oven).  My kids mostly played with it.  I sprinkled mini chocolate chips on top about 15 minutes before it was done to garnish the top.  Pretty but a bit bland - I think it needs more dense pineapple AND chocolate flavor to be a big hit.  Maybe butter instead of shortening?  Maybe a teaspoon of lemon juice or some zest in the pineapple 1/2?
