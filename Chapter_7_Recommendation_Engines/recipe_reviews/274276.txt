Delicious new flavor of meatballs to add to our recipe rotation! I added some salt and onion powder to the meat to suit my family’s taste but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and it was great!

My family really enjoyed this. Could easily double the meatball part to 2lbs as there is plenty of sauce.

Really enjoyed the flavor but my meatballs did not hold their form at all and turned into a sloppy joe type consistency.
