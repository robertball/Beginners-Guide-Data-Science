The first time I made this, I used the oven. It turned out ok, but the flavors weren't super pronounced and it didn't look very appetizing. 

The second time I made it, I used the grill, and that was WAY better! Grilling cooked the meat well while keeping the veggies vibrant in color, and helped thicken up the sauce instead of making it all watery like the oven-baked version did. 

Regardless of the cooking method, the foil packets were an absolute snap to clean up after! As someone who despises cleaning, I will be using a lot more foil packet recipes in the future!!

I made but added more bbq sauce than recommended (by double). The veggies needed some sauce to help keep from browning too much.

An easy way to grill chicken and the chicken comes out moist.  I did sprinkle some garlic powder, pepper and salt on the chicken.  I wrapped each chicken individually so that each person could have their own packet.

I have to agree with others this chicken needs some seasoning. I originally thought it was maybe because of the sauce others used but nah...it needs some simple seasoning. As for the foil packets they are a great way to grill without a mess! My only worry was making sure the chicken was done. I use the thermometer on my grill instead of the heat setting and grilled at around 450 and gave it a couple extra minutes.

I loved the ease of preparation and clean up.   I think it definitely needs the addition of salt and pepper and maybe some additional spices. It paired well with a baked potato. Thanks for the recipe!

only thing I would do differently is add some basic seasoning to the chicken itself

I made this in my oven because the weather wasn't cooperating! 
I used chicken thighs and baked them for 15 minutes. At the same time, I baked two small potatoes. 
I used drained canned corn. 
It was delicious!

One of the very best recipes I've come across, don't bother thinking, and get stuck in, excellent.
