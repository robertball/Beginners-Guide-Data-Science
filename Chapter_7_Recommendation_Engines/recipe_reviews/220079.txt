A whole pkg of the sausages (19.76 oz) seemed like a lot to me for a single pizza, so I used three of the five links in the package which gave good coverage.  Also, 1-1/2 cups of wine seemed excessive, so I reduced that to 3/4 cup, otherwise, I think it would have taken forever for the sauce to cook down.  The sauce for this pizza is full-bodied, bold, and has many layers of flavor.  The key to this pizza is to simmer slowly until the sauce thickens, the alcohol cooks out, and what you have left is the rich flavor of the wine.  I added the sausage back to the sauce and simmered for about the 10 minutes.  This is a very filling pizza, unlike any that Iâ€™ve ever had.  This is a special one, thumbs up in this house!

I really did not care for this pizza. I have loved all of the Johnsonville sausage recipes I have tried. Basically, I really just don't care for store bought canned pizza crust. Despite a time consuming sauce and good quality sausage, it just didn't work. The off flavor of the crust could not be masked. Despite cooking the sauce 20 minutes, I still felt some of the onions weren't soft enough and wine taste seemed to linger way too strongly, even after the pizza was fully baked. A cup and a half of wine, almost seems like a misprint! I re-read the reviews, to find a few mentioning reducing it. I also prefer a pizza with more mozzarella. The parmesan was a bit much. I am not much into hot foods and the red pepper flakes were a little too bold for me too. Another reviewer, mentioned omitting them completely. The pizza was just a little too time consuming for the over all flavor and a homemade crust is definitely recommended for a more pizza and less bready flavor. Think, I will stick with the "Easy Sausage Pizza by Johnsonville," already on the site. I made that one and it was excellent. If you are looking for more of a pizza flavor, that is the one to try!

Only used 1 cup of wine & added tomato paste & extra oregano & basil to sauce.  Baked crust for 5 minutes then brushed with olive oil & sprinkled with dried basil & oregano before topping with sauce & cheeses.  Husband said best pizza he ever had!  Will be making again & again!

Had a great taste! I didn't want it too be too spicy for our tastes so I left out the red pepper flakes. Next time I will add less wine to make a thicker sauce. But overall this made a really enjoyable pizza!

My fiance really enjoyed this pizza.  I don't eat sausage so didn't try it, but will share his taste rating of 5 stars.  It was a touch time consuming for a pizza, on nights I make a pizza I usually don't spend more than 10 minutes prepping, but this seemed to be worth the effort..thank you for sharing!

The sauce was very liquidy with that much wine so I ended up adding some tomato paste to thicken it.  This was just more trouble than it was worth for the taste you get.
