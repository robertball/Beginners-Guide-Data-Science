I love lemon and vanilla cokes, but this one tops them! Just the right amount of sweet and tart. Thanks Angela. This will be one of our quick favorites out on the patio this summer.

Yum! A simple twist on a classic drink. I had tried this in the past with fresh lime juice, but it just didn't have the same kick to it. Limeade concentrate's the way to go. I loved this.

Great taste.  I like to use just a few slices of lime to flavor instead of limeade.  Also great with fresh lemon slices.

I did not care for this at all. I found the lime much to over-powering. I will stick to my usual pepsi with a wedge of lime.

I order lime in all my soft drinks, have done it for years.  In some places they sell Coke with lime already in it direct from Coke products.

3.13.18  Weâ€™re not big soda drinkers, but occasionally, my husband likes to have a cola, so we always have a few cans on hand.  This is a nice way to style up a glass of diet cola; the lime flavor kicks in after your first swallow.

Yum! The lime concentrate (plus some regular ol lime juice) really helped cut down on the syrupy odd flavor I get from straight up cola. Normally cola is to sweet for me to have more than a few sips but with the lime I was able to enjoy a small cup.
