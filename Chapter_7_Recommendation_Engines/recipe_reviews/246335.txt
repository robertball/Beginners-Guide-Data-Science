If you find it watery, slice the zucchini ahead of time, place in colander, sprinkle w/salt and allow to drain for at least an hour. This removes most of the water.

I made this lasagne exactly as was stated, and it was a crowd pleaser.  My picky husband even ate it, and he usually needs a heavy meal.  This tasted exactly like regular lasagne, but was light.  My daughter and I can't eat gluten, so noodles are not an option for us.  We have not found GF lasagne noodles yet.  So this dinner was perfect for us, quite a treat actually.  We never get to have lasagne with noodles, so this was a hit.  This will be a regular in our house!  I look forward to making it for guests as well.

Made almost exactly as written and must say even my carnivorous husband loved it!. Zoodles weren't mushy and the bechamel with tomatoes really makes this zoodle lasagna recipe in our opinion! Cook time was spot on! Used the Bechamel sauce recommended in the Editor's Note (for Gluten Free, sub with GF All Purpose Flour--I use Better Batter). Had a jar of crushed tomatoes from last year's garden surplus--just cooked them down more and used the same amount as called for (tomato sauce) in the recipe. Hubs accidentally added way too much of the Bechamel sauce (I made double on purpose to use the remainder the next day) and it did come out soupy, but that's our fault! Still loved the flavors though! Pay attention to the recipe and the editor's note and this will be divine!! Next time I may add an extra layer of lightly sauteed (just undercooked) vegetables (e.g. mushrooms, spinach, bell pepper, etc.)! Thank you for another awesome recipe!

The first time I made this dish, it was a bit too watery and the Zoodles were a bit undercooked for our taste. In subsequent preparations, I baked the Zoodles (on a wire rack in a sheet pan) for 5 mins at 375 prior to casserole assembly. This additional step solved both problems! I also found that I prefer using the Vegetable Sheeting attachment on my KitchenAid stand mixer, it makes the Zoodles more consistent with actual lasagna noodles.

Great, Great, Great! I love eggplant Parmesan and this is now a close second. Make it to the recipe first if you can and then adjust from there. Healthy and lower cal. I will definitely make it again and again.

Hello everyone. I am the submitter of this recipe. This is a favorite of ours. Obviously, you need to use gluten free bechamel to keep this a gluten free meal. The bechamel recipe in the notes works perfectly well when you use gf flour or corn starch instead of wheat flour. Also, in order to reduce moisture, some people sprinkle salt on the zucchini and allow it to rest or pre-cook it. That is your choice, of course. We like the liquid from the zucchini and the nutrients it provides. I hope you enjoy it. Ciao, ciao.

Delicious flavor, however it was kind of soupy.  I added mushrooms, and my  husband would also recommend adding some kind of  meat (ground hamburg, anyone?)

I had my doubts about this recipe but gave it a try hoping for a nice, not watery sauce. As I suspected the bechamel broke during baking. It was very tasty but soupy. I had to soak up the liquid with paper towels. I think I would try it again and cook at a lower temperature.

I have not tried this recipe but it looks amazing!  To address the comment  made by the poster regarding the Bechamel Sauce.  There are so many gluten free flours widely available that it can successfully be made gluten free.  It would be so nice if we all did our homework before posting negative reviews.

Okay, I'm going to admit I haven't made this recipe, but I wanted to let Brigid know that if she occasionally would like to use noodles, look for brown rice noodles.  They are GF, come in lots of shapes and sizes, including lasagne, and they are wonderful.  Hope you see this and are able to find these noodles.

I actually spiralized the zucchini instead of slicing and added ground beef with onion and mushrooms. I didn't add the Bechemel though, but wish I had. Still delicious. Hubby loved it. 35 minutes was a touch overlooked for my oven as you can see from my pic.

I sweated the zucchini with salt then patted it dry, used ricotta cheese instead of white sauce, was very generous with all cheeses and especially with the fresh basil. We LOVED it and will definitely make it often, especially come summer when our veggies come in.

Too saucy!  Not sure if I did something wrong but this came out almost like soup.  Even after letting it cool, it was still very loose.  The flavor was great though.  If I make it again, I would add a lot more cheese.

We liked this low-carb option for lasagna!  It turns out soupy so I ended up cutting the zucchini slices up and eating it from a bowl with a spoon- same great flavors!

The family enjoyed it.  I grilled the squash before assembly, eliminating the excess moisture.  It was good, but I still prefer regular noodles.

This is delicious and a wonderful, low-carb dish!  I used Chef John's homemade tomato sauce and it was terrific. Next time I will try to double the layers to make it thicker so each serving is larger.  I will definitely make it again!

I was quite happy with this recipe, my husband, a self proclaimed ‘meat-a-tarian’ complimented it and said it was quite good. So a big thank you! Trying to get that man to eat a vegetable that isn’t a potato chip is difficult and he said “this was a keeper”. This is definitely one that will be made again. Great idea

I am curious about the reference to gluten free lasagna noodles being replaced with zucchini when the bechamel sauce is made with flour?  This is not a gluten free meal as far as I can tell, so I am not sure why the reference was made.  I love it though and love the bechamel!

This was a big letdown, and kind of revolting.  Maybe I'm spoiled.  I'm a lasagna-girl, since I was old enough to toddle around my grandparent's apartment.  They were from Sicily, and knew no English.  I wanted to make a lighter version of lasagna, so I tried this.  Completely gross.  The "zoodles" were like mush, no texture whatsoever.  There was way way too much liquid in the pan between the water extruded from the zucchini (which I wrung out prior to making on a dishtowel) and the water extruded from the ricotta (which I drained prior to making also).  Not recommended at all, unless you don't care that you're eating something that could be eaten through a straw.  Gross.

So you did not have gluten free pasta but you add gluten in bechamel sauce.  White flour!!!    You would have same gluten reaction if you just used your regular pasta.  Because of this ridiculous bait and switch. ... one star

Way too soupy. Such a waste of my killer béchamel sauce. I won't make this again.
