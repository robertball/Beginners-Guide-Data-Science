These were very good waffles. I added vanilla and cinnamon and I changed up the leavening to 1 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp baking soda per cup of flour and omitted the salt. I made a double batch as I was feeding 3 boys and they gobbled them up!

These are great basic buttermilk waffles.  If you want crisp, I recommend Belgium waffles, which have you beating the whites separately.  Buttermilk waffles are faster to prep and offer a more tender consistency.  I made these with whole wheat and doubled the recipe with no issues.

These are wonderful! I added a tablespoon of homemade vanilla for an added little bit of flavor. Delicious!

Made as is with no substitutions. Easy and quick recipe that makes nicely crisp waffles if you leave them a little bit longer in the waffle iron to brown. Thanks for the recipe. My mornings are busy. This works great!

Quick and easy. No complicated steps. I substituted 1/4 cup of applesauce for the eggs and sugar because we were out of eggs. It worked great.

We prefer a crispy waffle, so the texture was off for us; it is still a good basic waffle.  This was lovely topped with a warm fruit compote.

It was just ok. Quite bland tasting and I added some vanilla in hopes of some taste. Won't make again.

LOVELY! Mine turned out soooooo good and flaky on the surface, soft in the middle, fluffy... I could go on and on but you've got to try this recipe for yourself. P.s. They were just as good without syrup.

This is my go to buttermilk waffle recipe.  I  used "dried"  buttermilk blend.  You add water and you have buttermilk.  Today I added blueberries to it.

I made these this morning, and they are delicious.  I cut the sugar in half, but other than that, I followed the recipe.  Even the raw mix is delicious.  It's easy, quick and is now my go-to recipe for waffles.

My family liked these.
I used 1 teaspoon of baking powder instead of the baking soda, added a splash of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon.

I doubled the eggs.  I like my waffles a little stretchy.  Also increase the butter to improve no stick and crispness.
