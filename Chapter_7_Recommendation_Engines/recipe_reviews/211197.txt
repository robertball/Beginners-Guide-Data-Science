I tried this recipe and it was WONDERFUL ... I did make a few changes and here they are :  I also shredded carrots and finely chopped onions and layered these too.  I also made my white sauce with chicken broth as I did chicken breasts instead of pork chops.  My husband has lost his taste and smell and the texture of this dish was "feel good" in his mouth.  Thanks for the idea and I hope you don't mind that I changed the recipe a tad.

I made this last night strictly according to directions. It was very bland, no flavor, although the pork chops were fall apart tender. Potatoes were mushy. I don't think I'll be making this again.

I sliced the potatoes instead of shredding because it turned out more like a scalloped potato. The pork chops turned out nice and moist but the dish did need some more seasoning than the salt and pepper called for.

The flavors were pretty good, but as other reviewers mentioned, it's quite bland.  Use twice the salt & pepper you think you should since it cooks so long.  Also, I'm not sure the proportions are right on the flour and butter.  I would use about half the butter if I make it again - the finished product came out quite oily.  I think this might be better as a scalloped potato with thick chunks, too.    

I think this recipe has potential, but it's not quite what I expected.

I must have done something wrong... There's no way what I ended up with is what this recipe is supposed to make... I followed the recipe exactly, and ended up with some OK pork chops (decent texture, but VERY bland), and a thick potato-ey paste... tried to salvage it by adding some instant mashed potatoes & putting it under the broiler to crisp it up a bit, but there was no saving this. My 4 year old wouldn't touch it, and my husband suffered through it to spare my feelings, but told me later that I should probably NEVER make this again. Sorry, but I agree with my family, definitely not keeping this one...
