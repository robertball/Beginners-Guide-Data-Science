These are amazing!  I didn't have fresh garlic or ginger, so I used powdered.  It worked out just fine, I am sure fresh would have been better. I am so glad this recipe was posted.  I go to our local Chinese restaurant to get their green beans, now I don't have to!  I am going to add some cubed tofu in the next time...I am sure it will make a great main dish!  :) Thanks!

These were excellent. I did make one change since I was cooking on my grill using a side burner. I steamed the beans for several minutes, then just used a small amount of oil to follow the rest of the steps. We really enjoyed these and I will make them again.

Perfect! I didn't have a whole lb of beans so I kinda tweaked the other ingredients as best I could, and they turned out amazing! I added a pinch of chili flakes for additional zip.

These were very good. Lots of flavor and a little heat from the ginger. I used frozen thin whole green beans, I didn't cut them up. I used minced ginger from a jar and minced garlic from a jar and lots of fresh ground black pepper. I didn't have peanut oil so I used vegetable and then at the end added a couple of drops of sesame oil for the nut flavor. Everyone liked this dish. Thanks for a great recipe!

These green beans had great flavor, but the cook time wasn’t quite long enough.  I questioned rather I should blanch or steam the beans for about 2-3 minutes before adding to the wok.  I should have followed my instincts and done so.  I cooked the beans in the wok for 4-5 minutes with the first cooking and another 2 minutes with the second cooking.  They were still pretty crunchy (raw kind of crunchy, not good cooked kind of crunchy).  The flavor was wonderful and the cooking method was easy to follow, but I will par cook the beans when I make them again.  I served these with ‘Take The Night Off Slower Cooker Pineapple Chicken’ and white rice.  We enjoyed a delicious meal and I would make both recipes again.

These are tasty! I used frozen beans and light soy sauce, otherwise, kept the recipe the same. The green bean flavour comes out, as well as the spices. Yum!

These green beans were so good.  I have three children who are very picky eaters and they all ate these.  Wonderful and full of flavor!

This was a quick and easy side dish. My boyfriend said he's never tasted anything so good that was green. Great side for my asian themed dinner!

I would eat these every day. The family loves them and they are so easy to prepare. Used this recipe in my preschool class. Those kids loved using a wok and cooking!! And they ate every bean!

I thought the flavor of this was spot on.  I tried it with very thin asparagus that I had on hand.  As I didn't want to fry it, I blanched the asparagus in water, then drained.  I followed the remainder of the recipe. Easy and very delicious.  Next time I will try the green beans!

My husband and son hated fresh green beans until I made these.  So glad I tried it!  Now they ask for these at least once a week.

This recipe tastes virtually identical to the ones I had in Dongguan, China last year.  So happy have found it!

These beans were excellent; we loved them!  Since I didn't have fresh ginger, I used 1/2 teaspoon of powdered.  Also didn't have peanut oil, so I used coconut oil but not near as much as the recipe called for.  It was actually a nice touch.  You do have to fry them for a while to get to the crisp-tender stage.  I put the cover on to help steam.  Right before adding the beans back to the pan, I added about a tablespoon or so of peanut butter and a little bit more soy sauce.  I think they would have been fine without, too.  Will definitely make these again!

Absolutely delicious!!! I've been trying to replicate the beans I get from a Chinese restaurant and well... they turned out even better! I followed the recipe almost exactly but I added a little bit of teriyaki sauce and used minced ginger in a tube. I didn't have peanut oil so I used extra virgin olive oil. I did as the other reviews recommended and blanched the beans for about 5 minutes before putting them in the pan. I will definitely keep making these!

This was a nice and easy recipe for when you need to make dinner in a hurry.  However I thought the finished product  would taste more like garlic and ginger, as I enjoy that flavor combination, but it didn't . I think for me it was the combination of dark sesame oil and the peanut oil that threw it off for me.

This was delicious and flavorful. To make it healthier, I used only 2 T. of oil, and left out the sugar. Even the kids enjoyed this!
