I had my doubts about this and boy was I wrong! I had plans of actually making a pizza, toppings and all. But I decided to taste the crust first and after that one taste my plans went out the door. I ate the whole pizza crust by itself, that's how good it was!
Amazingly it does taste like a crust. Thanks for a great recipe.

If you love the flavor of roasted broccoli as I do then this is a must! Excellent and 5 stars all the way. I didn't get as much as the water squeezed out of the broccoli as I needed to and had to add extra bread crumbs but still excellent. Thanks for the great recipe!
