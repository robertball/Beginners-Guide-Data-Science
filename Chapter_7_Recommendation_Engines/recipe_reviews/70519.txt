This was a really great idea. I didnt use the Craisins. What I did was take a can of whole cranberry sauce and mashed with with a potato masher, mixed it with the pinapple and then poured it over the pork. It was excellent.  The can of cranberry sauce is alot cheaper too and I think the craisins wouldnt have been as much flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! I made a number of changes though. Used pineapple tidbits. Reduced the cranberries to about half. Reduced the seasoned salt to just a pinch. Added half a large onion, chopped. Added half a cup of teriyaki marinade. Added about a tablespoon of dried minced garlic. Added about a quarter teaspoon of dried thyme. And a pinch each of cinnamon and cayenne pepper. Served over rice. I will definitely be making this again.

Folks- really? Why review a recipe you didn't actually make according to the ingredients and directions provided - and decided to just make up your own recipe? Jeesh. However - I agree this is a good "starter"- something you can tweak to make your own. But if you're adding ten different ingredients, it's not Slow Cooker Pineapple Pork Roast, it's Your Teriyaki Onion Ginger Peppered Pineapple Pork Roast!!!!

I really liked this recipe and so did my family and my guests. I did use a variation. I read all of the reviews and went from there. I chopped a yellow onion and put that on the bottom of the crock pot, put thyme, pepper and rosemary on a 3 lb pork tenderloin and then topped it with terriyaki sauce. I put in a generous amount and then added the pineapple and cranberries. I did not use salt since I was using terriyaki and that is salty. It was great - moist and had lots of nice flavor. The best thing was that it was very, very easy!

I give this a guarded 4 stars because I would not use a roast for this recipe again.  I will, however, use this recipe again for pork chops, small pork loin, or chicken breasts instead.  

The rest of the recipe is great - a nice, light fruit flavor (I used spicy seasoning salt)....but there is not enough liquid to cover the entire roast - so if you do use a roast - turn it over halfway through, so the top half doesn't dry out.  

Again - a very nice flavor.  If you are looking for more spice - you might have to add a splash of teryaki or soy sauce.

  Great way to get fruit into a meal!

It was really, really good. I did not have dried cranberries so I used a can of whole cranberries juice and all.  I also added one sweet onion. Next time I will also put green peppers in it and serve it over rice.

I did this a little differently. I pierced the meat and sprinkled it with season salt, garlic powder, black pepper and onion powder.  I then put meat on top of sliced onions in a roaster and poured the cranberry/pineapple mixture over it.  I used whole cranberry sauce.  I baked covered at 350 for 1 1/2 hours or till the temp was 155 then let sit for 15 mins before slicing.  Delish! Tender and great with mashed potatoes and seasoned green beans.

Great recipe!  If you, like me, don't have enough pineapple follow recommendations of others: add teriyaki marinade/sauce.  I also added onions (on the bottom---I love the flavor they add).
We will do this one again and again! Yummy.

Delicious...I did modify it a bit. I had a smaller pork loin roast 13/4 lbs, cooked on high for 4 hours. I put some sliced vadalia onions on bottom and drizzled some sweet catalina dressing over the onions, pork on top, lots of pepper and a little salt, pineapple on top...the last 30 minutes i put some sliced green peppers on top with a little more salt. I didn't have any cranberries this time. Moist, tender, very good!!!!  Thanks for sharing  :)

Made with boston butt roast. Sliced onion on bottom and seasoned meat with a pinch of thyme and garlic powder.Added can of pineapple and juice,soy sauce, 1/2 amt. craisins and sprinkled brown sugar over all.Cooked 2 hours on high and 1 hour on low. Very moist and tasty roast. Strained the juices and thickened to make gravy for rice. A good basic recipe that can be tweaked to your liking.

Great! I also used 1 can of cranberry sauce, that I pureed and added to the can of pineapple chunks.  I cooked it on high for 4 hrs. It was amazing and I will be making this again soon! Thanks for the recipe.

Great with modifications suggested by other readers. I layered the bottom with onions, then placed 2 pork tenderloins down and seasoned them with thyme, pepper, a small amount of seasoned salt, and cayenne pepper. I then poured in some teriayaki sauce, a can of diced pineapples with juice, and a can of whole cranberry sauce (mushed first). I topped it off with a little chicken broth to make sure the meat was covered. Then covered and put on low for 8+ hours. The pork was so incredibly flavorful and tender. Barely needed a knife to cut it! Would def. recommend with moderations above. Thanks to users who experimented!

I tried this and it was absolutely wonderful and tender.  I used a pork shoulder and seasoned it all over with the basics: Sazon, Minced Garlic, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, White Pepper, Black Pepper, Dry Rosemary, and Oregeno. I mashed together 1/2 can of Jellied Cranberry Sauce (instead of Craisins), 20 oz can of pineapple chunks and 1/2 cup teriyaki sauce. I also used 2 medium onions and 1 Green & Red Pepper.  I layered the bottom of the slow cooker first with sliced onions (1) , green (1/2)  & red (1/2) bell pepper slices.  I placed the shoulder on top and then placed remaining Onions/Peppers slices.  I poured the Cranberry mixture over the shoulder and cooked on a high setting for 4 hours.  Simply Delicious.

This is one of the best things that has ever come out of my crockpot!  I used a pork tenderloin that already comes marinated in teriyaki sauce.  I cut up a sweet onion for the bottom of the pot, and then poured in the can of pineapple chunks and a can of whole cranberry sauce.  This cooked on low for about 10 hours because I was at work at all day.  It was perfect...hardly any leftovers!!!

Everyone enjoyed this the first night.  The meat was very tender, the taste "different, but good." No one liked it when I served it as leftovers.  They ate the sides I served -- mashed potatoes, green beans, and corn, but put their forks down after one bite of the leftover meat & sauce.  I wound up throwing it out which is not something I'm used to, nor do I like doing. I won't be making it again unless I have enough people here to finish it the first night.

Wow this was surprisingly wonderful for such simple ingredients.  I did add 1/2 c teriyaki sauce and garlic cloves.  Pork was very tender and moist.  I cut the pork roast in several large chunks so the acid from the pineapple juice could penetrate the meat fully.  Served with mashed red potatoes and broccoli for a simple, easy, and tasty meal.  My 15 yr old son RAVED about it and my not-so-pork-loving husband liked it.  Will definitely make again and use chicken too.

This is a wonderful recipe and so adaptable , to additions of you own choosing.  I made it for visiting family, and they loved it!  I added soy sauce, a little brown sugar and cider vinegar the next day, reheated and voila!  We had sweet & sour pork over rice.  The pineapple juice is just the right base for this.

This is the best and easiest recipe to do.  If your not  a salt lover than this is the recope for you. I made this as directed except I used lawrys season salt and garlic salt.  I rolled the pork in the salt mixture.  Then, I poked holes throughout pork roast.  I set the cooker to medium and cooked it for 6 hrs.  This roast came out wonderfully seasoned, juicy, delicious and season lightly.  I would make this again. My family loved. Teresa

Very easy and tasty! I used a 1/4 soy sauce and fresh tyme and rosemary. When roast was done I took out the meat, pineapple and cranberries with slotted spoon and thickened juice into a gravy with cornstarch/water mix.  Also used crushed pineapple cuz its all I had. Will make again!

I only had a larger bone-in roast, so I adjusted the cooking time accordingly.  This pork was so good it almost melted in my mouth.  We had leftovers that made excellent pulled pork sandwiches.  I also used some of the leftovers to make stuffed pastry rolls as appetizers for a dinner.  Yum!

VERY GOOD DISH! My mom just made this (I'm writing this from her account) and boy, it was delicious. I'm your average hungry 16-year-old teen, and my sister and I really enjoyed this. It's got tons of flavor, its very tender, and all i can say is if you have kids, they will certainly like this! Also, it was pretty easy for my mom to make, so if you're one of those high-maintanance moms out there, this is the dish for you!

This recipe has got to be the best kept secret out there.  With this kind flavour it is just "sick" how easy it is to make.  We have even used equal weight of pork chops and yep still AWESOME.

I put onions in the bottom but I don't think they were needed.  This dish is great.  I did cut my roast into one inch chunks.  Served o er brown
rice.  This is a keeper and so easy.  I cooked on high for 4 hours.

I give it 4 stars only because I added a little to it. I didn't put in the cranberries..I didn't have any, but I added about a 1/4 bottle of honey hoisin stir fry sauce. Kept everything else the same, but used chops instead of roast. If you use a roast I would recommend more honey hoisin sauce. It turned out amazing! Even the kids loved it.

This was a winner. My husband went back for thirds! I did follow other reviewers' comments and used a can of whole cranberry sauce instead of dried cranberries. With the pineapple, the cranberry sauce combined for a nice sauce. I served it over rice.

Followed others suggestions and added a bit of teriyaki sauce (yoshida's) and some onion on the bottom but otherwise followed directions.  Served my family and inlaws and they rated it 5 stars, my FIL rated it '3 platefuls'  Will definately make it again.

I have made this twice now, once using whole cranberry sauce as I didn't have the dried, and it was really good. Tonight I made with the dried, but we are cutting back on salt so I stuck some cloves in it and put in some cinnamon and then added a tablespoon brown sugar/Splenda blend and it was amazing! I think it's going to be a staple from now on. Made rice and green beans with it and needed no desert. The sauce was great over the rice too. My husband cleaned his plate in record time. It was better than a glazed ham even.

I used this recipe as a base and added my own special touch.  First I browned off my pork roast in a little olive oil and butter.  I took out the roast and added 1 chopped onion, stirred them around a few minutes then added 1 can of pineapple chunks and stirred to get the goodies off the bottom of pan.  I then dumped mixture in crock pot on top of roast.  I added about 3/4 cup of soy sauce, a dash of apple cider vinegar, and juice of 1/2 lemon,and just threw the lemon half in the pot.  seasoned with tsp. garlic and onion powder.  I did not add cranberries at all, cooked on low for 7 hours.  It was absolutly delicious.  I was hoping it would not be too sweet, and it wasn't.  The pineapple was still kind of crunchy, oh I forgot I added 3 carrots, chopped in chunks to the mix.  I will definately use this recipe many times.  Served over rice. This is my first review.  I was so impressed with the results I just had to share.

This was so easy, I couldn't believe it would turn out so great. I followed some of the other suggestions, ie; I sliced a sweet onion & put it in first, used cranberry sauce instead of dried cranberries, & sprinkled the pork with thyme, rosmary & fresh ground pepper. Easy enough for during the week, fancy enough for comapany.

WHOOEEE! My husband is NOT a meat eater but can't keep his akhands off of the leftovers--if there are any. Since he can't handle fat of any kind, I use pork tenderloin. As others mentioned, I slice a Vadalia onion for under the roast, use a can of whole cranberry sauce and tweak it with teriyaki sauce. The ease of preparation makes this one a 6 star.

My family loves this recipe, and I love how easy it is! I've done it with and without the cranberries, and I don't really notice a difference. Lately I've just been leaving them out because I don't usually have them onhand. Delicious either way though!

I had high hopes for this recipe.  I was disappointed.  Followed the directions exactly...the meat was tender but somewhat dry and flavorless.  The pineapple and cranberry sauce was good (added a little cornstarch to thicken) but nothing special.  If I make it again, I would cut the pork into cubes before adding to the crockpot to see if that would increase the flavor.

I followed this recipe exactly; what a winner!  My family loved it.  I used a 3.5 pound Boston butt roast and it was fall-apart tender after 9 hours on low. I served the fruited juices in a bowl and we spooned it over the meat.  Doesn't get any easier than this.

I made this dish for my family and it was a hit. I changed it up of course, by removing the cranberries and seasoning it with cinnamon, allspice, and garlic instead. I also used crushed pinneapple instead of chunked.   DELICIOUS!!

I made this with no modifications except whole cranberries instead of craisins.  Couldn't really detect a fruity hint at all on this.  Turned out very tender though!

Brilliant in it's simplicity.  There is a lot of juice at the end - I discarded most and used around cup full for gravy by processing the juices with a little of the pineapple and cranberry - v tasty!  I also served a small side dish of strained pineapple and cranberry (like a chutney almost).  Rave reviews from everyone - very sticky and sweet and perfect in sandwiches the next day. 

Will absolutely make again

I thought this was good but not great.  I had to add a bit of water halfway through because it looked like it was getting overcooked (which equals dry in the slow cooker).  I served it over couscous (which I made with orange juice to blend flavors with the pork) and a side of broccoli.  It went well together, but next time I think I'll tweak the recipe.

I made this pretty much to the recipe directions except reduced cranberries to 1 C (looked like more than enough to me) and used 8oz. can of crushed pineapple and 8oz. can of chunk pineapple because that's what I had on hand.  About 2 hours before serving, I mixed in cornstarch/water to thicken the sauce a bit, thinking it might make a nice glaze and gravy for rice.  This worked well.  I really wanted to love this recipe but it was just so-so, not too inspiring.  I won't be making this one again, but if I did, I'd make sure to add more salt.

Winner, winner, pork dinner.  What did this take me, maybe 5 minutes to prepare before leaving for work?  And the flavor was amazing!  Yes, even my seven year old devoured this dinner.  This is going to be a permanent staple in our recipe box.

was looking for a different recipe for a pork roast. after reading the reviews, decided to try this recipe. I put in a can of cranberries and dried cranberries. still seems like it's missing something, but it was very good. I did use cold water and cornstarch to thicken the juice left in crockpot to put over the rice and pork roast. the family loved it!

This was fantastic!  Super easy to make, and full of delicious flavors.  My wife, who's not really into pineapple really loved this as well.  I added a yellow onion into the mix and that worked well.  Thanks!

Followed another reviewer's advice and added 1/2 cup of teriyaki sauce (I use low sodium). Did not add extra salt, replacing it with ginger. This was delicious!

This is going in my recipe box.  I have 3 kids (5, 7, & 9) and all ate like it was the best meal ever.  I did add 1/2 a chopped purple onion, extra dried cranberries and cooked 2 hrs on high and 2 hrs on low.  I served w/ asiago cheese bread.  I will be doing this recipe again soon.  So simple and the flavors meld wonderfully!!

Pretty good. I would make this again. I seasoned the pork with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder. After adding the pineapple and cranberries I sprinkled brown sugar like others suggested. Served it with white rice and it was really tasty.

Very tasty and interesting blend of flavors. I left out the seasoned salt and added a sweet onoin chopped. Crushed pineapple is what I had on hand so I used it, also added 1/4 cup of Teryaki sauce to the mix and marinated it 24 hrs. then cooked every thing in a bag. Wonderful Christmas Dinner !!

I made it exactly as the recipe was written and it turned out very moist and with great flavor!  My husband couldn't stop saying "mmmm" with each bite.  I just dumped it all in the crock pot and that was it.  This will be great to serve to company.

This definitely gets 5 stars for easy.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and added 1 sliced onion on the bottom of the crock pot and placed my roast on top of it.  I used a bone-in 3 1/2 lb pork roast and poured pineapple tidbits and whole cranberry sauce over the top.  I added a pinch of garlic powder to the roast along with the salt & pepper.  I also added about 1/4c. teriyaki marinade, but it didn't add much flavor and I don't think it needed it.  Pork fell off the bone and was very tasty.

Great served over rice.  Add a vegetable or salad & you've got a great meal.

I didn't have cranberries but this was just as good. I will definitely use them next time to try it out.

Even without the berries- this recipe was different and delicious. A real winner with picky kids!

Thanks!

This did not turn out well at all.  It needs a lot more flavor and juice.  I used 1.5 pound pork roast and half of each can of pinapple chunks and cranberries.  The pork roast was very tender, but it soaked up all the juice which was lacking serious flavor.  I'm not sure how you're able to pour this over rice??

This was only my second time using the slow cooker  and this recipe was *GREAT*. I couldn't find a roast that was exactly 3 pounds so I used two >2 pound roasts. I also used a can of whole cranberry sauce, and during the last fifteen minutes I added in a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar and a splash of soy sauce. I think those final touches really helped boost the flavor. I attempted to remove the meat 20 minutes before it was done to slice it up a little but it was already so tender it was falling apart. Delicious! And I can totally understand why folks use leftovers with some BBQ sauce for sandwiches. My folks went to my sister's for dinner tonight but I'm going to make them taste this when they get back! :)

This turned out really well.  We used about 6 pounds of pork shoulder, so let it cook about 8 hours (8 1/2 or 9 would have been better).  We also used crushed pineapple instead of chunks (hubby isn't a big fan of warm fruit chunks and meat together).  Defatted and thickened the resultant juices with cornstarch slurry.  I was disappointed that the cranberry flavor didn't come out more, but for a 3-ingredient dish (plus seasonings) I thought it was really good.  We may try a combo of fresh or frozen and dried cranberries next time.  The meat was very flavorful (says the teenaged boy) and it was a tossup as to whether we liked the meat better with or without the gravy.  We will definitely make this again -- it's a great weeknight meal!

This is at home in my slow cooker as we speak. I cannot wait to try it. I zested an entire orange and rubbed it all over the roast, and squeezed the juice in with it as well. I also used a can of whole cranberry sauce in stead of dried cranberries. I think it's going to be very good! I will post pictures of my success later!

This was excellent. My boyfriend and I LOVED it. We agree that it's a keeper, both because it's easy and it tastes good. I followed some of the previous commenter's advice:  1. I used canned whole cranberry sauce, which I first blended in a food processor. 2 I used a 3 1/2 lb pork roast. 3. I sprinkled the meat with thyme, garlic powder, dried onions, onion salt, pepper, soy sauce, and brown sugar. 4. I cooked the roast on low for 2 hours and high for 2 hours, flipping it over once.

This is a great recipe.  Like others after reading the reviews this is how I altered it. 1lb pork roast decreased recipe to 3 servings 8oz crushed pineapple 3/4 cup whole cranberry sauce/dried cranberries 1 to 2 garlic cloves pressed 1/3 cup terriyaki sauce 2 tps minced onion flakes or 1/4 cup chopped onion 1/8 tps thyme pinch cinnamon 2 dashes of cayenne pepper salt pepper  Rubbed the roast with salt & pepper. Cook on low for 4hrs.  Remove the roast and shred with a fork.  Add meat back to crockpot, turn down to warm.  Let it sit in sauce for another hour or till ready to eat.  Spoon over rice.

Everyone enjoyed this recipe, even the ones who don't fancy pork! I served it with rice, a green bean casserole, and salad.    Here's what I did: I chopped up 1 large onion and 2 cloves of garlic and made that the bed for the pork to lay on. Then I covered the 3 lb pork roast with thyme, rosemary, pepper, and a pinch each of cinnamon and cayenne pepper on both sides. Next came the cranberry and pineapple sauce mix (mashed). And last I topped it with about 1/2 cup terriyaki sauce. The terriyaki was crucial in balancing the flavors.    I baked covered at 350 for 1 1/2 hours and let cool for 15 minutes before slicing.

A wonderful recipe.  I pretty much followed it closely, except that I had no seasoned salt, so I used plain salt, garlic powder, and crushed rosemary.  When I got home from work, I sliced the perfectly cooked pork and let it cook a bit more in the sauce (which I had thickened with a bit of cornstarch)while I made rice and a salad.  Very, very good.

I don't like pork, but I did like this.  Very tender and good flavor.  I misread the pineapple label at the store and bought crushed, but that worked just fine.

This was really good!  I had to use canned cranberry not the whole ones but the sauce or jelly as did not have the dried cranberrys.  Other than that I followed the recipie as stated.  It did not need anything else!  It was very good served over rice!  I will be making this again!

I made this recipe as written, and it was great.  It was very moist; no need to add any extra moisture.  I used pineapple chunks in pineapple juice.  As long as you follow the recipe and don't drain the pineapples, there should be plenty of juice.  The meat was moist and sweet.

This pork roast was good, I am just not much of a pork fan, but I would have to say that it may be the best pork I have tried. I have a major sweet tooth, so the sweetness from the fruit is really good to me. My husband was not much of a fan, but he doesn't prefer many sweet things, but I thought it was pretty good!

Yes, this is a very easy recipe but the pineapple and cranberries are too great a quanity and 7 hours is way too long.  I cooked it for about 5 hours and it was too long.  Will not try again on this one--there are too many good ones out there.

Great recipe.  Followed other suggestions of adding terriyaki sauce but also added 1 can chunked pineapple with 1 can crushed pineapple.  I also added a can of jellied cranberry sauce.  We had plenty of left overs so the next day I shredded the pork and added a bottle of Barbecue sauce and a little ketchup to the sauce and had pulled pork sandwiches.  To die for!!!
Whole family loved them.

This was excellent- I left out the salt and pepper (the roast was salty enough), used pineapple rings and 1/4 c Orange Craisins.  The roast was frozen solid when I started, so it took about nine hours (I turned up the heat for the first and last hours).  Awesome recipe!

This was pretty good but a little bland.  I ended up putting it over rice mixed with soy sauce, and that helped kick it up a little.  Still, it makes for great leftovers and was very satisfying.  Also, I used boneless pork chops because they were on sale, and cooked for about 9 hours...  Still, it turned out well.  Maybe some brown sugar and hot sauce next time.

Very tasty roast!  Only thing I'd have done differently was decrease the amount of cranberries or used real.  Otherwise, very good.

I am going to rate this lower in order to give it a more fair representation.  As-is, this recipe is not good enough.  It's bland, doesn't account for various slow cookers, and is just not a good recipe.

If you look at all the high ratings, people have just made up their own recipes, added a ton of different ingredients, and have completely changed it before rating it well.

Lots of potential!  Very good, sweet flavor, but needed more!  We added a little BBQ sauce and served over french bread with a little cheese.  I also used shredded pineapple, then shredded the meat and mixed it all together!  I liked the cranberries in it too!

This was a really easy recipe, and my pork loin roast came out fork tender and mouth watering. The only thing is the pineapple chunks were a little too tart for my taste, but the rest of my family loved it.

The meat was very moist and tender but the pineapple and craisins did not add any flavor.  I did not read the reviews before making or I would have added some onions and some of the other items other reviewers suggested.

This was good. The meat was a little dry. I would have to cut the cooking time a bit to make this again. The fruit was a delicious, sweet but tart companion. I served it with broccoli and jasmine rice. Very tasty when put together. But I can't say that I will make a great effort to try this recipe again.

I don't know if it's fair to rate this, since I used the recs to add more items: thyme, whole cranberry jelly, crushed pinepples, a dash of cinnamon, red pepper flakes and soy sauce, sugar. Can't say I loved the outcome. it was a bit too tart for me  - even with the sugar ( i didn't want to make it too sweet.) Also, I know that some don't believe it's possible to have dry pork roast from a crockpot (i didn't either), but lo and behold! DRY DRY pork roast. I had it bathing in those juices, and yet it was still dry! It was easy to pull apart but all the moisture was gone! I'd give my outcome a 2 star, but I can't rightfully give that to the recipe since I changed it so much. Just be aware!

I would rate this 5 stars, but I changed the recipe a little.  This was a great dish.  Everyone loved it.  The meat was easy to pull apart, tender and moist.  I added 1 tsp of onion powder and 1 tsp of Tony's seasoning to the salt and pepper and rubbed that on the roast.  I also poured 2 tsp of soy sauce over the roast after putting it in the slow cooker.  I used 2 cans of whole berry cranberry sauce, mashed up.  However this made it taste more cranberry than pineapple, so will use one can next time.  I flipped the roast halfway through the cook time so the top didn't dry out.  It was a great meal served with rice and using the juice as gravy.  Will be making this one again.

A bit unique, almost sweet and sour effect that comes across very well.  Almost sinfully easy to prepare.  Goes well with brown rice.

This was very good except it took 10 hours to be able to pull apart. Invited friends for dinner at six and had to make tacos instead as the pork wasn't done til 10 p.m. I also cooked on high after the first 1 1/2 hrs. because my experience in the crock pot has always been 10 hrs on low. Maybe I need a new pot in order to cook this in 5 hrs.

This was delicious.  I'm not a big fan of pork roast but the combination of pineapple and cranberry was delicious.  I did make a few modifications -- used only 3/4 c. craisins, added 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1 tablespoon of soy sauce.  Also, added mini pearl onions since I didn't have any sweet onions.

Sounded weird but tasted excellent. It was so simple to make. I didn't change a thing. I just let it go overnight in the slow cooker and everyone loved it.

Pork is always difficult for me to cook...it normally comes out a little dry. This recipe is fool proof and absolutely delicious!  I didn't rub the salt and pepper into the roast, just sprinkled it over the top. It was still wonderful!

We were more than a little dissapointed in this recipe, expected a lot more flavor. Meat was a little dry and tastless, sauce wasn,t all that tasty either.

I really can't figure out how 2 of the recent posters had this come out "dry". It is just about impossible for anything done in a crock pot/slow cooker to come out anything but moist and tender.....even the worst cuts of stew beef!! Maybe they did not actually do it in the crock pot/did it in the oven instead?? Now.....onto the flavor. Since a number of the previous posters DID feel the need to boost the flavor with some added seasoning: I made it as written plus also sprinkled the pork roast with onion powder and ginger as a couple of previous posters suggested. I only had about 3/4 of a cup of cranberries on hand but I did have dried cherries in the cupboard so I did half cranberry and half cherry. Hubby ate a LOT of this and even my daughter who is not fond of pork had 2 helpings.

Not impressed!  The pork didn't absorb much of the flavor.  It came out tender enough, just kind of boring on the flavor.  My husband covered it in bbp sauce just to choke it down and the kids made me promise not to make it again.

This recipe was a good start.  I rubbed my pork loin with garlic powder, ginger and onion powder.  Browned it in a pan and then added it to the slow cooker which had chopped onions, fresh garlic, TONS of ginger, a can of mandarin oranges (with juice), 1cup of teryaki sauce, soy sauce and a couple pinches of red pepper flakes.  After 6 hours, I pulled the meat apart and added 2 tablespoons of flour that I had mixed with water so not to be adding lumps. It is REALLY good!  Remember to add a lot more spices when cooking in a slow cooker...

My husband loved this. I accidentaly grabbed a pork loin at the grocery instead of a roast. But it still came out well. I used a can of whole berry cranberry sauce also. It was very easy to fix. Thanks for submitting this recipe.

Very good. I added an onion, rosemary, thyme, and used cranberry sauce as others have suggested. I also poked holes in the roast prior to putting it in the crock pot. I'm not sure why others felt that this had no flavor; mine had tons of flavor!

This was extremely easy!  I personally did not love the taste but I gave it 4 stars because my husband and kids did!  The only thing I did not add were the cranberries as my husband is not a fan of them.  Maybe I would have liked better with them?

Tried recipe twice - used a large pork loin roast both times.  First time followed original recipe... dry.
Second time added a can of whole cranberry sauce and 1/4 c of teriyaki sauce.  Better but still bland and now watery.  If you like overcooked pineapple and a lifeless roast, then cook this one.  There are far better recipes out there.

We thought that this pork roast was the best that we ever had.  Bonus that it is made in a slow cooker.  One of those dishes that seem to be even better the next day!!!  Cooked pineapple not on your forte-- guess you never ate sweet and sour Chinese food.

This was very tasty and so easy to make! I will deintitely make again.  Husband liked it and the kids ate it and didn't complain--so it's a keeper in my book!  I did add some brown sugar to the pineapple cranberry mix--we like everything sweet! It deserves 10 stars for how easy it was to make!

I thought this was okay. My family didn't care for it at all. The pineapple & cranberries had lost their charm by the end of the cooking time. We strained those off and ate the meat without them. Very tender and moist, but nothing special.

We loved this recipe.  It doesn't matter what kind of pineapple you use.  The craisins are wonderfully tangy.  For those reviewers who did not like it, I wonder if the cut of meat makes a big difference - I used pork tenderloin.  We will definitely make this again!

The whole family enjoyed this one, even the seven year old who hates pineapple. Put it over rice on the first night and on buns for lunch the next day.

This is a very easy, very tasty pork roast.  I used a pork loin, that's what was on sale.  I cook all the time, my boyfriend usually doesn't say much, so it's hard to tell if he like something or not.  He was raving about how good this was, what a surprise!  Great recipe!

This recipe was pretty good. I used  canned pineapple juice instead of the canned pineapple, also I sliced an onion and put it on the bottom of the slow cooker. Had a real good flavor.

I used ingredients as listed, only changed the spice.. My roast was just under 3lb. I rubbed it with a rosemary/garlic mix, & sprinkled sea salt. cooked in my Instant Pot on slow cook "Medium" for 5 + 1/2 hours. came out perfect. tender enough to cut with a fork.

Best pork I've had from the slow cooker!   cut the roast into process then sir in some of the"sauce"in the pot.  Serve over rice. We had steamed cauliflower and asparagus with it and it was awesome! Kids loved it.

I did it exactly as the recipe described except I used bone-in pork. It was falling off the bone and the delish factor completely off the hook! Three kids devoured it. I lamented that there weren't leftovers for their school lunches the next day. The salt/pepper ratio was perfect.

This is a good recipe to get started. Like others, I knew that I wanted a little more flavor, so I added some onions and other spices. As always with a slow cooker recipe, adjust the time to how yours cooks. I forgot this little rule, and my crock pot runs hot and my roast wound up a bit dry at 7 hours. I will definitely try again!

I didn't have craisins, so I used fresh cranberries instead.  I wouldn't recommend this as the cranberries tasted very bitter after cooking.  Regardless, the roast had good flavor from the pineapple, but I would add a little sugar next time.  I like sweet sauce on my pork to mask some of that "piggy" flavor.  I would also maybe thicken my sauce before serving because it obviously is going to be watery.  I served this over rice.

Seriously took me 2 minutes to prepare and 7 hours later I had a mouth full of YUM! Fabulous flavors - pairs great with brown rice  - did I mention it was insanely easy and quick to prepare? This one is being added to the normal dinner rotation.

Super easy and tasty.  I shredded some of the left over meat and mixed it with BBQ sauce for yummy sandwiches.  I'm going to try it with dried blueberries next time instead of cranberries.  Great with mashed red potatoes.

The roast was moist and tender. The pineapple, however, soaked up the fat in the juices and was not very appetizing. I would not fix again.

This recipe was bland and boring. Not worth the time it took to put in the slow cooker.

It was very tasty.  I used two cans of pineapple because we are big fans of pineapple.  I omitted the craisins because my husband doesn't like them and added about a quarter cup brown sugar.  TASTY!

Disappointing. I needed a quick recipe for an unexpected dinner party. This dish just didn't pick up any flavor from the fruits. Each taste was separate and didn't create any excitement at all.

This was really great.  I followed someone else's lead and put in canned cranberries.  Then when it was done cooking I took the sauce and threw it in the blender (I was making it for my sister and she doesn't like chunks of stuff) and made a thick sort of gravy to go with it.  Acutually then I froze the whole thing in the gravy and it was fine when I thawed it out.  However, my crockpot always dries things out so when I made it again for my husband I put it in the oven, covered with foil and it was even better.

I was skeptical but it looked so easy I had to try this.  It was wonderful!  I added a small can of pineapple juice but otherwise kept the recipe the same.  Try this!  I will make it again and again!!!  Thank you!

This roast tasted absolutely delicious, but I had to give it three stars for two reasons.  It was INCREDIBLY dry which I thought was very strange as it had cooked in liquid on low all day.  It was also very very tough, which I don't understand.  The roast I bought is the same cut of meat I use when I cook the roast in the oven.  It is completely cooked and tender within an hour.  So the fact that this was dry and tough really baffled me.  I recommend turning the roast half way through the cooking time if it is possible.  I found that it cooked evenly, but the bottom half had much more flavor.  If you don't mind the dry, tough meat, give this a try because it does have a delicious flavor.  One more thing, once I realized how dry it was, I sliced the whole thing and slid it back into the liquid for ten minutes.  It really moistened it quite a bit.

I added brown sugar and crushed pineapple and teriyaki for more flavor.  It was definitely moist and fell apart but the flavor didn't infuse the roast well.  So the next day I used the leftovers with mini hamburger buns and barbacue sauce for mini pork sliders - even better!

This was so easy and so good.  Had a small 1.5 lb pork tenderloin, added a can of pear slices instead of pineapple and a touch of ginger.  The gravy from the pears and the tang of the craisins was delicious over rice.  Definately a keeper. About 3 hours on medium in the slow cooker. Fork tender

So, this had potential, but turned out dry and lacking. So, i think it needs to cook less, use more seasoning. I added onions and cranberry sauce like other reviewers, but it's still missing some more flavor, maybe some brown sugar & garlic salt to really bring out the pineapple.

I followed other peoples' advice and chopped a yellow onion and placed it under the roast.  I also used crushed pineapple and whole cranberry sauce becaue thats what I had on hand.  It was very delicious.  I definitely recommend pouring teriyaki sauce over the entire roast and sprinkling thyme and rosemary on it as well.  The meat was so tender it fell apart and I served it with chicken flavored rice and a salad.  I will be making this again because both my husband and I loved it.

This recipe was very simple.  I did use whole cranberry sauce instead of craisins, but that is the only adjustment I made.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because all of us in my family like a few of the other pork recipes better than this one.  We will certainly have it again, just not as often as the others.

I followed the advice of others and added an onion to the bottom of the crock-pot and teriyaki. I used pineapple chunks and craisins.  The meat was moist but the flavor was lacking.  I will try to salvage by pulling the pork and adding BBQ sauce.

I tried this recipe because I was curious about a recipe with so few ingredients. Now I make this a couple of times a month. My husband LOVES it, my three year old can't get enough and even my hard-to-please 6 year old loves the smell when we walk in the house after school. It's easy, delicious and a little different than the usual. The pork just falls apart, and the pineapple carmelizes...Mmm Good.

I loved how easy this was, just throw everything in the crock pot and walk away. Unfortunately, the flavor was so bland that it really wasn't even worth it. The fruit flavor didn't penetrate the meat at all so we wound up with wet, tasteless pork with warm fruit. I added some soy sauce at the table, trying to make it interesting, but even that kind of fell short. I wish all crock pot recipes were this easy, but I wish this one had actually tasted good too. Probably not making this again.

I thought this recipe was very good as is. I do agree the cranberries were a bit mild. I would like to try these suggestions given: onions, soy sauce, canned whole cranberries, and brown sugar. These might make it even better. It was very tasty with rice-a-roni original or Italian whole grain.

This was great, I actually followed some of the other reviews and added the onion and terriyaki sauce.  I rubbed the pork roast with lots of spices and let it cook on low.  It smelled great and I served it with fried sweet potatoes.  It was amazing and the two complimented each other well!

This recipe was pretty good.  The pork was really tender.  I mashed up canned cranberries with crushed pineapple and added basil, cinnamon, and paprika to the meat with pepper and salt and served over rice.  I'll be using this one again.

This made a fabulously wonderful dinner.  I do not think the sauce really made it wonderful - but it did cook the meat to perfection.  The sauce just was there so to speak...the meat was awesome.

Flavorful, simple recipe

Only change was using a can of whole berry cranberry sauce vice dry cranberries. Meat was fresh, wild, free range, chemical free 150 pound sow. Sliced a couple of smallish roasts from front shoulder while butchering. Just enough to cover bottom of Instant Pot. Made some crisscross cuts in meat. Made sure pineapple juice was directed at those cuts while pouring pineapple chunks in. Topped with cranberry. Used slow cooker setting on low for 10 hours. Great sweet flavor and fork tender.

The flavor was really good!  We used a 3 lb pork lion.  While the flavor was really good, it was a little dry.  I add some  orange juice to add some juice to it.  That was also really good with the add orange juice.

Such an easy recipe to make, minimal ingredients needed.
It was absolutely delicious.  I had a 6 lb pork roast so I doubled the ingredients, and it still came out so tender, juicy, and my family loved it.

I made this last night and it was SO delicious!  I did add a little bit of sliced red onion and cooked it on high for 4 hours.  My 10 year old gobbled it up before touching her side dishes (usually it's the other way around).   This was fantastic and I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the awesome recipe Andrea C!

My family is really picky about pork-and this was a keeper!  I followed a couple of suggestions as mentioned from previous reviews:  First rubbed salt, pepper and ginger on a pork loin and seared it in a cast iron pan.  I then removed the roast and added to the pan some garlic, a can of pineapple chunks, 1 cup teriyaki sauce, and cranberries to deglaze.  I put the pork (fat side down) on a bed of chopped onions, poured over the sauce, and cooked for about 2 hours in a crock pot on low.  After 2 hours, I flipped the roast, removed the layer of fat, and covered that with sauce.  I have a crock pot with a temperature probe, so I watched for the temp to reach 155 and then removed the roast,covered it, and let it rest.  I added some cornstarch to the gravy and let the continue to cook for awhile.  I sliced up the pork and let it sit in the gravy for awhile.  It definitely wasn't a set and go recipe-but I think sometimes for a good pork a little extra attention is worth it.  YUM!

The best of my pork crockpot trials.

I used currants instead of cranberries, so it probably wasn't as tangy as it might have been.  

Portions refrigerated for several days were still good, not too dried out.

I added the terriyaki sauce and onions as well. I also added garlic powder and salt and pepper. And I took advice from other people and mashed the can of whole cranberry sauce. The flavor was amazing, but i read that you can cook it on high for 4 hours, which i did because i was running behind schedule and it was totally dry. :( So I will do it again for sure just do it on low like it actually says to do. :) I served it with steamed rice which i added a little bit of garlic and spice to, the hubby ate it up even though it was a little tough.

I have a variation to this. Instead of cranberries. I rub the roast with rosemary, garlic (minced) salt and pepper. Once it is brown I put into the crock pot with 2 cans of chunk pineapple. Cook on low for 6-8 hours depending on size of the roast. I also make Zattaran's Caribbean Rice with pineapple and coconut to serve on the side or on top of. 
It's my husband's favorite dinner.

Nice tender & juicy roast. Followed directions to the "t" but tasting didn't see much need for the Cranberries and the roast was a little too sweet. Still a good roast but not to our tastes.

So tender you could cut it with a spoon! Used fresh cranberries & Splenda to make a sauce. Added 1/2 cup Soy Vay brand Island Teriyaki sauce (contains garlic and ginger). Otherwise followed recipe as given. DELICIOUS.

My parents came over for dinner and I made this recipe.  They raved about it for days!!!  And I loved it too.  The pineapple and cranberries tasted delicious together and the combination of long, slow cooking and the fruit juice made the roast "melt-in-your-mouth" tender!

VERY moist in crock pot!! I almost did it in foil in the oven due some of the other reviews, BUT it was wonderful done in the crock pot. If you like pineapple, then this is a great way to make pork. My husband does not care for pork normally and he was happy with this meal. I probably made it too peppery as my kids mentioned that is was spicy  : )

I was really excited about all the great reviews, but we thought it was just okay. The meat was nice and tender but it wasn't that flavorful. So we will eat the leftovers but will probably not make again.

I think the using the pineapple and cranberries was a waste.  The meat is tender but tastes no different than if you didnt use anything.  Id make the pork again but wouldnt use the pineapple and cranberries.

Super easy, very tasty, but the kids didn't like it.  The grown ups loved it.

Followed the recipe to the letter, it was good. The roast was extremely tender and tasty, actually it was too soft to carve into slices so we ate it sort of "shredded". The resulting gravy and pineapple topping was a bit too sweet; next time I make this (and I will) I will temper the sweetness with some onion and garlic.

I didn't think there was anything special about this recipe. I followed the directions and substituted canned whole cranberry sauce for the dried cranberries.  Combned with the undrained pineapple, it was very soupy.

This roast was really tasty and moist.  The only thing I did differently was I used a can of whole berry cranberry sauce instead of the dried cranberries.  I drained the pineapple and reserved the juice.  I mixed the pineapple juice with the cranberry sauce to thin it down.  I then dumped the pineapple chunks and the thinned cranberry sauce on top of the roast.  Cook and eat.  YUM!

I used pork tenderloin because I had some I needed to use up, poked holes in the pork before cooking, and added 1/2 cup teriyaki sauce and half an onion, like some of the other recipes had suggested.  The flavor was very good and everyone loved it.  It was a little dry for my taste because I usually like a lot of sauce; next time I might add more pineapple juice to cover the roast.  Overall good.

I followed the recipe exactly and I must say that the roast was really bland.  It WAS really moist though, but we had to put some barbecue sauce on it to give it some flavor.

I thought this would be a great recipe. I used frozen cranberries and frozen pineapple tidbits, added some water and brown sugar twin. My roast needed more salt, at serving for my taste. But altogether was a nice and easy cooked roast, on a time pressed day. Will use the leftovers to make BBQ Pork sandwiches.

This one just didn't do anything for me.  Too expensive and the results were disappointing.  I followed the exact recipe and it lacked the flavour I expected.  My husband said it was okay but definitely not for me.

Quite easy and tremendously tasty.  I gave the recipe to someone else who said it was the best roast they had ever eaten.
