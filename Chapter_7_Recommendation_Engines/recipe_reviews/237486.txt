I thought this was great, but I used more ice and cashew butter instead of peanut butter one of my favs now!

This was great! I thought it wouldn't be sweet enough, but it has this great fresh taste with a slight sweetness from the bananas. Loved it! The one thing I'd say is that this recipe does make a few servings--but for me that's great because I just refrigerate the rest.

This was delicious. Modified as follows. I used all of the kale, leaves and stocks; I have an Omega blender so the kale was pulverised. I substituted 1 c. banana yogurt instead of a banana. I added 2 T. peanut butter, 1/2 c. whole milk, 5-6 ice cubes, 1/3 t. cinnamon, and a scoop of chocolate protein powder.

I added some blueberries and Greek yogurt since I had them around. Simple, tasty recipe! I agree with another comment about adding more ice. This was significantly more liquidy than I had expected.

I don't know if my bunch of kale was smaller than the average but with found the peanut butter overpowering in this recipe. I would maybe add honey next time instead of peanut butter
