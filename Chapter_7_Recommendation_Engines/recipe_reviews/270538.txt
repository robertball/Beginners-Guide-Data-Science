This is better than our local Mexican Restaurant offers.  I made exactly as written, using half white cheddar and half mont. jack. It is so super easy and quick to make.

This was a big hit with the family. Will be making this again. We ate it like nachos. Was really good with sour cream.

taste is awesome except I got the taste of uncooked cornstarch....any suggestions on how to correct that? otherwise it was easy and yummy! will certainly make again but maybe with a rue instead of just the starch mixed in with the cheese....thoughts?

This wasn't the best.  For some reason the diced green chilies made it bitter.  Won't be making this again.  I didn't get any complaints but not to my liking.  A bit of salt helped, but not enough.

Subbed 3/4 can of ROTEL for the fresh tomatoes but I'd imagine fresh would be even better. Very easy. Hits the spot but isn't exactly decadent. Could use a bit less cornstarch. I would only make this for a Mexican/Southwestern-themed event as it's not exactly the One Cheese Dip to Rule Them All, probably cuz it doesn't have alcohol in it...just my taste I guess!
