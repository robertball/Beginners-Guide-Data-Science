I like to use the left over shrimp from a dinner the night before. Shrimp laid in a bed of butter and lemons sprinkled with dry Italian seasoning. It makes for great flavor when mixed with scrambled eggs!!! Add mushrooms or green peppers for more flavor.

I’ve made this before in the past.  I usually cou the shrimp imto smaller pieces and add it to the scrambled eggs when they half way done so the shrimp doesn’t get too rubbery.  Then I turn off the fire, put shaved parmesean cheese on top & scramble it into the egg & shrimp mix.  Delicious.

A bit too sweet, and I used homemade cocktail sauce with some kick. A bit bland for my taste as well.

I probably shouldn't rate this recipe since the shrimp I used was left over from a BBQ and had been brushed with butter, garlic, tabasco and lemon sauce.  That being said, after I peeled the shrimp I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was great.
