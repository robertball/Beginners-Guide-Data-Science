Maybe it's just my taste but I didn't really care for this and would not serve it to company. Not really worth the bother in my opinion.

I really liked this. My salami was only a pound (so I thought) so I halved the recipe. At first I liked it but thought it was a little heavy on the bbq sauce and brown sugar so I made a mental note that I would reduce those ingredients next time. It wasn't until I was cleaning up that I realized it was only an 8 oz. roll of salami. So with that being said this recipe would be perfect as written. The key is to use a bbq sauce you are familiar with like and one that is not overly sweet. My go to bbq sauce is Gates which is a Kansas City style.
