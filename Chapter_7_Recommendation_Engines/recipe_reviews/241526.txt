This would make a really nice fast dinner, as well as a good breakfast.  I had some leftover fettuccine, so I used that instead of cooking spaghetti.  Add any veggies you have, thinking artichoke hearts would be an excellent addition.  Next time, I think I would save a pan and just push the pasta and veggies to the side and scramble the egg in the same pan.  Mine was just a tad dry, I think that is because I used leftover pasta.  Reserve a little pasta water to add at the end, if you want a little saucier dish.  Thanks for a good Sunday breakfast.

Delicious! I made it for a quick weekday dinner and served it with brown and serve sausage patties and a fresh fruit salad.

I don t really think this is a breakfast just because there are eggs in it. It s more a light dinner. This is similar to Carbonera. Be sure to have a platter ready before adding the eggs and then move pasta out of the pan quickly before the eggs get too dry.
