These are the best baked beans in the world! I left out the limas(don't like them) and depending on picky eaters, can use onion powder in place of onions. O.K. I'm back (4/8/07)Tried them with limas,Surprise!,they are still the best. Used Apple flavored liquid smoke. Good enough to be a bean stew (add diced tomatoes and chopped green peppers) This is a meal in a beanpot!

These are delicious!  I cooked everything up the night before and put it in my crockpot.  The next morning I put them on low for about 5 hours.  They were a real hit!

These beans are excellent! I put mine in the crock pot for nine hours and served with cornbread for a delicious main course meal.  Also, it is possible to substitute ketchup for the barbeque sauce, just increase the vinegar to 3T. and the smoke flavoring to 1T.

These beans were scrumptious; everyone in the family ate them and asked for more!  They would be a great addition to a potluck.  I had to sub black beans for the lima beans, but other than that I followed the recipe as directed, adding the optional liquid smoke.  These will be a staple in our bean loving family!

I made this for a family reunion.  It was super easy to throw together before the party and everyone loved it.  I was asked for the recipe by many people at the party!

Excellent baked Beans!  I had to come up with a way of baking them since I don't have a Dutch oven.  I used a 12 X 9.  Covered and baked at 375 degrees for 1 hr. 15 .  It turned out very good.  I left the Lima Beans out as well.  It really made a lot.

I am not a fan of lima beans in baked beans but I thought I had to try this one.  The only thing I changed was the meat as I had ground turkey in the freezer instead of beef.  I made this on Sat for a potluck on Tues.  I definitely will keep this recipe handy.  It was very easy and the flavor very good. (Even if it did have lima beans in it!!  teehee)

Fantastic.  To simplify, I cut the original recipe in half, left out the ground beef (because we were making burgers already) and lima beans, and scaled back the other ingredients just a little. I used 2 slices bacon, 1 can pork/beans with some liquid, 1 can kidney beans, 1/2 c BBQ sauce, 2 T br. sugar, 1 T cider, 1/2 t liquid smoke, and 1/4 t pepper.  I omitted the salt, and accidentally forgot the onion (will remember next time).  Cooked in a casserole pan with lid at 375 for 1:15.  They were the best baked beans I've ever tasted.  I'm not a big baked bean eater anyway, but my fiance who loves them raved.  He said, "SAVE THIS RECIPE!" So I am. :)

I made this over the stovetop. Due to not having all the ingredients, I didn't put in the beef. Also, the only beans I had on hand were kidney and red beans so I used those. Valerie, you are genius adding BBQ, liquid smoke, brown sugar, and cider vinegar. I could not stop picking and eating these beans all the way to the dinner table! This recipe tops a bland can of baked beans or pork and beans.

I was looking for something with a little ZING in it and when I read-VINEGAR I knew this would be the one! I did not bother with the LIMA BEANS??? BUT THE BACON AND PORK HAMBURGER made this a meal in itself! I added extra vinegar and IMMEDIATELY people came out the walls! everyone LOVED THIS POT OF BEANS!!! I bring it to church potlucks and sit back and let the compliments roll in!!!! LOL

I cooked the ground beef, onions, and bacon, put it in the fridge overnight, and then added the rest of the ingredients to my crockpot. I turned it on High for 4 hours, and they were delicious! My husband and I enjoyed the leftovers two days later!

I have made this several times now, and it is my favorite! The only thing I change is I added a little more bacon, cause I LIKE it, and I add a couple different beans.

Sorry to say it, but these weren't the best beans I've eaten. Made them on Sunday for a small party and no one even commented on them. Aunt Ro's Beans on this website were waaaay better.

Fantastic recipe, followed recipe as posted.  Only omitted the liquid smoke as I did not have any on hand.  Everyone could not get over how great they were.

I took a chance and made this for the first time for a pot luck. By the end of the night the beans were all eaten.People were saying how good they were and some asked for the recipe. It was a big hit.I'm going to make it for the next pot luck. It is easy to make.I put in another 1/2 c onions and next time will put more in.The same with the bacon, I took the advice of your readers and put in more bacon but next time I will make a whole pound and maybe add more beef.I found it was easier to cook the bacon after I cut it in half, then cooked it, since it wasn't a frying pan.I cooked it crispy. It was also easier to cook it after the pan was really hot and more bacon grease was in it after some bacon already cooked.I added a little more br. sugar, not a lot. The rest of the recipe I followed as it was written.It was delicious.

I made this for a potluck at work last year.  I'm not a big fan of lima beans so I substituted them for an extra can of kidney beans.  Otherwise, I made the recipe to a "T".  One of the guys I work with raved about it so much that he's paid me to get all the ingredients and make it again for our halloween potluck this week. YUM!!

Excellent! I have a large family with several teen boys and everyone loves this recipe. I like it because I can prep it in the morning or the night before and let it cook while I'm at work. I add a little garlic and fix corn bread on the side.

Good and easy to make.  I also left out the lima beans because I despise them!!!  However, the addition of the kidney beans made it very hardy.

This was actually really good and I don't even like beans. I made this originally for my husband and he really liked it so I just had to try it and was pleasantly surprised at the fact that I liked it! It was a lot though. I put half in a freezer bag to use with another meal later. Thanks for the easy meal!

Delicious and easy one dish meal. I used ground pork in place of the beef and pinto beans in place of limas. Very sweet, so if you use a sweet bbq sauce, you may want to cut back on the brown sugar. I think i will omit it altogether next time. This recipe makes a ton! Could easily be halved but i would use the full pound of meat and at least the six slices of bacon. Thank you for a delicious meal.

I enjoyed this very much, but not everyone I served liked it.  It's very, very sweet and the cider vinegar makes it quite tangy.  My 5 year old wouldn't eat it. If I make it again I would cut down on the vinegar and increase the liquid smoke. I did use the lima beans and I have to say they were tasty, and I don't normally like them. They go nicely in this dish.

Excellent for a potluck dinner.  I followed recipe exactly and it was great.  I was concerned about the liquid smoke, but was not overpowering.  Highly recommend.  Will be making for Easter Gathering.

I have made this quite a few times, but given how many accolades I received on Mother's Day for this recipe, I thought I should finally review it.  Made minor tweaks: used cannelloni beans instead of lima beans and was lazy and just used packaged bacon pieces instead of frying/crumbling bacon.  Cooked it on low in my crock for about 5-6 hours. Delicious...

These were pretty good but didn't quite match up to our favorite baked bean dish I usually make.  Other than making without the hamburger and mixing up the bean combo I made these as is.  If you don't use a good bbq sauce don't even bother to make these.  Thanks for something different to try.

One of the family favorites. Added just a very small amount more of liquid smoke. It’s even better when you make it the night before and reheat it.

These were really good!  Next time I would use another bean besides the limas - the green color threw some of my dinner guests off.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, everyone loved it so I had to make it again for Christmas dinner! The only thing different I did was I put an extra 1/2 cup of brown sugar in the sweet potato mix. It was an accident the first time I made it but it was soooo good that way, I made it with the extra sugar again on Christmas... delicious!

The limas threw this recipe off.  I'm willing to make this again and omit those. Other than that, this was a decent recipe.

These are the best baked beans I have ever made. I followed the receipe exactly with the exception of the Lima beans and it was delicious. My family also enjoys adding a little crumbled sausage

My husband told me that he'd sell me to the "Sheeny Man" if I were to put Lima beans in here, he suggested butter beans.  I made this and it was a great turn out.

Good.  I used large butter beans instead of green limas. The BBQ sauce had enough sugar so the extra brown sugar was unnecessary.

Lima beans are too chalky for this.  Substitute Northern beans or black beans for color and flavor variety.  The taste is great as is, but there is plenty of room for adjustment of flavors if you wish.  Thank you for sharing!   Bar-B-Que favorite for us.
