The major ice cream manufacturer's should take note of this recipe, because this is the most true form of cake batter ice cream I have tasted. It is comparable to Cold Stone Creamery's Cake Batter Ice Cream. I added 1 cup of yellow cake mix, which is just a little more than the recipe calls for. I realized after I began making this that the recipe required a ice cream maker, but have no fear, you can make this without one with success! Let your mixture cool in the freezer for 20 minutes and then pour into a large casserole dish or a cake pan. Freeze for 20-30 minute increments and take out in between and beat the ice cream with a hand mixer. I only had to freeze and beat the ice cream 4 times until it was done. I honestly think I will never buy ice cream again. This was easy and you could easily use a chocolate cake mix too. This is not runny at all as some other reviewers said, make sure you use the correct ingredients. For the milk, I used whole milk and make  sure you do not substitute the heavy cream for anything else. This is a CREAMY ice cream, not an icy ice cream. **Update** I have since purchased a Kitchen-Aid Ice Cream Attachment and I use that and it works great. I have used both white cake mix and yellow cake mix and the white cake mix tasted "off" so I highly suggest using yellow cake mix for a more authentic taste.

This ice cream is SO yummy! It was the perfect creaminess! Not too thick! I thought the cake batter taste wasn't too strong, you could maybe add a litte more, but I thought it was good as it. The only difference I did was use vanilla bean paste in place of the vanilla extract. I do that with all my homemade ice cream. This recipe is for sure a keeper that I will make again and again!

Unreal. Quite simple for someone like me to make without messing it up. Flavor is just wonderful. I did use REAL vanilla extract, didn't mess around with that imitation stuff. One of my most favorite ice cream flavors ever....and now I can make it at home. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was a nice base recipe inspiration but not all that wonderful on its own. I agree with the reviewer who said to use yellow cake mix and more of it -- that's a no-brainer. White cake mix has zero flavor and usually makes an awful tasting cake. I used a DH yellow cake mix. I used organic jumbo sized eggs which I think gave it too much of a custard-y egg-y taste so next time I'll cut back to two eggs or three regular large eggs (the recipe doesn't tell us what size eggs). This recipe has to increase the vanilla to get it anywhere in the ballpark of Cold Stone's cake batter ice cream. I think I probably used two or three TABLESPOONS before I decided it had sufficient vanilla taste. I also doubled the recipe and added two full cups of cake mix. Next time I might get a vanilla bean and scrape the insides into the batter for a stronger, more authentic vanilla taste. Last, I finely chopped two semi sweet chocolate bars and added them once the ice cream was getting to milkshake consistency. Without the chocolate this would not have been half as good. I will try this again with less egg and maybe more cake mix and more vanilla via fresh beans. This is a good recipe inspiration but needs some help to reach the right to be called even close to cold stone's or any commercial brand.

YUMMY!!! I can't believe I've forgotten to rate this little gem! My family eats ice cream year round and we LOVE this. We do make it like MySweetCreations recommends and use 1cup of yellow but otherwise follow the recipe! Thanks so much for sharing. This was our first homemade icecream recipe to try out and I'm so glad we did!

I managed to make this ice cream like my "local creamery" by trial & error...I don't have an ice cream maker, so I put the mixture in a covered glass casserole dish in the freezer, whisking every 30 minutes until set up. The first day it was ok...a little soft & not exactly tasting as rich as the "creamery's." We left the rest in the freezer overnight, which resulted in a really hard lump. 60 seconds in the microwave resulted in a creamy, delicious treat that's a mirror image of what you'd buy at the mall. With my favorite mix-ins, I won't be spending $4.95 on the same thing anytime soon. Thanks for sharing!

great recipe.  I made mine with red velvet cake mix and pieces of red velvet cake it turned out perfect.  I did add 1 cup of milk and 4 egg yolks to make it more custard like.  Also, it is better to add the cake mix and cream after you cook the yolks, sugar, and milk to keep it from being so thick and cooking the cake mix. great idea!

Very yummy ice cream.  It actually tastes a lot like Cold Stone's cake batter ice cream (even a similarly thick consistency).  I mixed this up for the first time tonight while I was cooking dinner.  I didn't really even pay attention to the ice cream mixture when it was on the stove...just stirred one last time before removing from the heat.  You could easily substitute lighter ingredients like half-and-half for the heavy whipping cream.  I found a reduced-sugar Pillsbury cake mix that worked well.  It turned out so thick, creamy and sweet.  Great recipe!  If you want a real treat...use the rest of the cake mix to make cupcakes.  Serve the ice cream over a cupcake with fresh strawberries!

A delicious ice cream! Make sure you seal it up as air-tight as possible before putting it in the freezer, or it will get hard... I tried adding chocolate sprinkles once, and it turned out quite yummy! I think I like it best plain though...

It took me 3 attempts (the first two failed because I didn't have a thermometer), but the third time was the charm -- it tastes just like Cold Stone's cake batter ice cream!  I highly recommend not trying to make this without a thermometer, because if you leave it on the stove just a little too long, it gets way too thick and ends up the consistency of pudding or frosting.  EDIT, November 2010:  I still make this all the time, but now I leave out the egg yolks and skip the cooking part entirely.  I whisk together all the remaining ingredients and just pour them straight into the ice cream maker.  The taste is exactly the same and it's a lot less work.

I used Half and Half in place of Heavy Whipping Cream and Skim Milk and it was STILL SUPER creamy. I am talking about Cold Stone Creamery status! And it was half the fat of this recipe which I love. I also made it 'Birthday Cake' Ice Cream by adding 1/4 container of vanilla icing in the middle of its churning time...as well as some sprinkles of course. I think I let it get a little past 'soft serve' consistency, but it was still perfect and did not need to set in the freezer overnight in my opinion. Everyone was raving! Thank you for this recipe!

Heavenly!!! I have made many other flavors of homemade ice cream but this is the best ever! It tastes just like the kind you get at the specialty ice creameries only better because it has that homemade taste going on. LOVE IT!!! I used all half and half for this recipe since I wanted to get rid of what I had left, I am sure that only added to its decadence. Thank you for this recipe!!!

Creamy, decadent, amazing ice cream.  Will not add chocolate jimmies next time as they changed the flavor & color of the ice cream.  Tasted even better (if that is possible) after it had ripened in the fridge.  Thank you for excellent recipe!

Absolutely wonderful recipe!!! I put it into my KitchenAid ice cream mixer attachment and this was ready in about 15 minutes. I followed other's recommendations to up the cake mix to 1 cup and my husband said it tasted exactly like cake batter. I also added rainbow sprinkles (inspired by the recipe photo) and crushed mini Oreos to the batter to make it even more decadent. Delicious!

HEAVENLY!!! I used skim milk and whole milk in place of the heavy cream and it turned out amazing! It was more like soft serve when it was done in the ice cream mixer but after freezing all night it is still soft enough to scoop but still hold it's shape!  Thank you!

Great idea! This tasted super similar to Cold Stone Creamery's version. I have to admit, we ran out of time and had to cheat....we took a half gallon of vanilla ice cream and mixed (in batches) just the cake mix to taste. Then we stuck the glasses in the freezer to refreeze. (It got pretty melted by the time you had it mixed well). Big hit from the whole group tonight! Thanks!

I love this! I always get cake batter ice cream at Cold Stone with brownies mixed in, so I baked some & added them in the last few minutes of the ice cream maker. So yummy!

I think you may have just saved my peanut-allergic son's childhood! He's had reactions to even the "safest" store-bought ice creams, so it's been tough. And then we found this little gem. It's the best ice cream I've ever tasted and totally safe for him.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

Wow this was good.  Very rich though.  I think next time it will be half and half.  The taste will be just as good, just wont be as thick going down!  A keeper.

Excellent.  Thick, creamy custard ice cream!  The cake batter taste was a little muted, I would add more cake mix next time (perhaps even doubled). But still, was a wonderful recipe!

I was soooo excited to make this ice cream.  I adore cake batter and enjoy Cold Stone's Cake Batter Ice Cream.  The taste of this ice cream is spot on, yet the texture is throwing me for a loop.  I though, perhaps, it was just me, as I prefer my ice cream super cold and almost *icy*, as opposed to creamy.  Then, I asked Mr. LTH to try it and he said exactly the same thing (and he's a creamy ice cream kind of guy).  It's def worth giving a try; I'm anxious to see our guests reactions to it tonight!  THANKS for the recipe!

Quite a nice tasting ice cream, makes a change from the usual flavors, Vanilla, chocolate etc.  I did have to use yellow cake mix (all I had in the pantry, not something I really stock) also used just half and half.  Made this first thing this morning, and its still quite sloppy (Maybe something to do with the fact I only used half and half).  I am pretty sure it will be fine tomorrow (I have had to have a taste sample of course and its good!!!

It's cake batter, it's ice cream, it's delicious!  This is a rich and creamy treat that I will make again.  I did follow others advice by upping the cake mix to 1 cup. Can't wait to try it with yellow cake mix.

Im sure it is great if using the right cake mix. DO NOT use funfettie cake mix. I will try this again but with a yellow cake mix like another user suggested.

i used this recipe, then took the remaining cake mix and made a tall 9 inch round cake. I then cut it into three layer and used the ice cream to stick them together, and frosted with a homemade cream cheese frosting. I was told to box and sell these cakes. it was delicious.

Use 1 cup yellow cake mix & 1 cup half in half instead of milk.  Let the batter chill overnight before churning.  Super rich!!

Absolutely delicious!  Best homemade icecream I've ever made!  Huge hit.  I added about a capful of almond extract and it gave it great flavor.

I hate to be the ogre who gives the thumbs down, but this is not quite right. 
To me, it tasted like custard. 
Also, for ice cream shop (c.s. in particular, which I am a frequent customer of) cake batter ice cream, there is a distinct (for lack of a better term) "powdery" taste, which I love. It makes it actually taste like cake mix.
IF i were to try and make this again I would do a full cup of mix. 
Also, when cooking it, my mixture jumped quickly from 150 degrees all the way to 175. I'll watch that more carefully, in case that added to the 'custardy' flavor.
Decent, but not what I was hoping for.

The first time I attempted to make this my house was crazy and I was slightly distracted and instead of 3/4 cup cake mix I added almost the entire box of cake mix. Needless to say it came out extremely thick and more cakey than ice cream haha...second attempt was a much better success and very easy to follow if you actually read the measurements and very yummy :)

Tastes EXACTLY like the Cake Batter ice cream at Coldstone.  Delicious.  Used 1 cup yellow cake mix instead of 3/4 cup.

I made this with yellow cake mix, and substituted one cup of half&half for one cup of the cream (it was what I had on hand). 

It came out tasting exactly like cake batter (ie, wonderful)! I think it might even be a little better than the local chains. :D

When I quality-control tasted this I thought it was pretty darn good. Then, when my family and friends tasted it, they took bigger portions than I anticipated! I knew it was good and they thought it was great! Stuck to the recipe as-is. It's a keeper! Thanks!

So yummy! It's more the consistency of frozen custard, then ice cream but the flavor is delicious and rich!!! Mix in any kind of toppings to create a unique "cake" ice cream! Try sprinkles and fudge sauce, or mixing in strawberries and top with whip cream for a strawberry short cake theme! The possibilities are endless. I received many compliments.

OMG this is SO good!  I used Yellow Cake Mix instead of White Cake Mix and this was better than Coldstone!  I added mini chocolate chips and rainbow sprinkles and used the batter in my Kitchenaid ice cream maker and it turned out like Coldstone's Birthday Cake Remix!  Will definitely be making several times!

Absolutely awesome ice cream.  I made this just yesterday and it is almost gone. Only change was to use half-and-half instead of the cream because that is what I already had in the fridge.  I am sure the cream would make it even better.   I can't believe how great the flavor is.  Plus, this recipe is simple and fool-proof if you follow the directions.  I used my candy thermometer and heated it until 160.  It honestly does take like cake batter.  When I cut open the bag of cake mix to make this, I was wondering what I was going to do with the leftover mix - I am going to make more of this ice cream!

I was sad that I could only give  it 5 stars! This is the best ice cream I have ever had!! Cake Batter is my favorite flavor at Cold Stone, and this is better than that. This recipe tastes more like cake than the one they are using. Love it!!

First time we made it we all thought it was great.  A couple weeks later I made it again and the response was more tepid.  It's easy enough to make and comes out exactly as advertised.  It's ok ice cream, but I think I'll keep looking for a recipe I really like.

This ice cream was really really good :) it was rich and creamy and i used a yellow cake mix instead of white and it still tasted great kind of like a rich frosting will definitely make again and again. i have made this recipe time and again and its always turned out wonderful for me :) you could change it into a regular ice cream by omitting the cake mix and adding whatever flavors you like chocolate pieces, cookie dough, and mint extract are all the flavors i've added and theyve all come out wonderful this is definitely my go to base recipe when i make ice cream

Comparable to Cold Stone's cake batter ice cream. I made this recipe since cake batter ice cream is a favorite  in our house. After following a few of the suggestions in the reviews, I made a couple changes to the original  recipe:
-I omitted the eggs and cooking step
-Used yellow cake mix instead of white cake mix and upped it from 3/4  cup to 1 cup
-Sifted the cake mix before adding it into the wet ingredients, then sifted ice cream mixture when pouring it into the container to refrigerate it

It turned out super creamy, delicious and rich, yielding just over 1 1/2 quarts. 

The only thing I would consider changing next time I make it is using half and half instead of heavy whipping cream to make it a little less rich.But there will definitely be a next time with this recipe since it was a big hit :-)

This was one of the best ice creams i have ever made, i used 1 cup of yellow cake mix and 2 teaspoons of vanilla. Add the vanilla after cooking though. I actually think you should skip the eggs and cooking altogether. Cake batter does not taste good as a custard. Definitely making this again but next time, I'm skipping the cooking altogether.

I gave this recipe to my mother, I had just purchased a ice cream maker for her. She said it was delicious! As always you have to refridgerate the oce cream over night to get the true "ice cream" consistancy.

Got too thick and pudding like with cooking. Then froze too quickly. Was more frozen pudding than ice cream. Too much cake batter in this. Sounded good but nah. Recipe followed exactly as written. Will keep looking

Followed the recipe except used yellow cake mix instead of white.  The flavor of this ice cream is amazing.  It tastes just like cake batter.  The consistency/mouthfeel is not as good.  Before pouring into the ice cream machine the mixture was very thick, and it transferred to the ice cream itself.  Very thick and custard.  I would make again because it tastes amazing, but might work on how to make it less thick.

This is the best ice cream I've ever had. Seriously, I'm tempted to go back in the kitchen right now and get more. I can't imagine any way that this could be made better. Smooth, tasty, and very similar to what you can buy at the ice cream shop.

This was yummy but I'll definitely make some tweaks next time. I added a full cup of cake mix as some of the reviewers suggested but I think the cake batter flavor was a little overwhelming so I'll stick to 3/4 cup next time. Also, the mixture formed large clumps at the bottom even though I was stirring constantly over medium/low heat. Not sure how I'll avoid this next time. Finally, make sure you freeze the ice cream before serving, I served it immediately and it was a little too custard-y (we froze the leftovers and they were so much better).  

FYI I used the Kitchenaid ice cream attachment.

Be careful when cooking on stove!  I "burnt" the bottom a bit. :(  1 cup YELLOW cake mix.  Little less sugar.

Love it! I used a chocolate cake batter, and used 1/2 a cup. Once the ice cream got to soft serve consistancy, I melted some frosting and added it to the mix, then threw in some sprinkles, then turned my ice cream maker back on for a few min. Then froze it! Sooooo good!

Absolutely perfect!  Finally a quick, easy, great tasting ice cream recipe.   Smooth, thick and creamy.  I too increased the cake mix to 1 cup.   I can't wait to try different flavors.

I made this without an ice cream maker.  I just stuck it in the freezer and took it out and whipped it with a hand mixer every 20 minutes.  The result was ridiculous good!  It's so rich and creamy and just plain yummy.

Oh My Goodness Gracious. This is the easily the best ice cream I've ever made. It's creamy and easy and soooo delicious! The second time I tried using half and half in place of heavy cream and it turned out just as creamy and delicious, and less fat! (I know, it's ICE CREAM, but why not :P ) This recipe is infinitely versatile, you really could use any flavour of cake mix... or brownie mix, mmmm! I tried it with a cherry chip cake mix, and oh my, oh my! Thank you so much for this recipe!

I used Funfetti cake mix and it turned out amazing. The only other thing I changed was I omitted using eggs. I also just whisked all the ingredients together and threw it into the ice cream maker. The kids said it tasted like cupcake ice cream. Will definitely make again and again!

This is SO, SO good.  I did not change a thing because it is the first time I have ever made ice cream and it came out SO good.  Next time, I am going to add jam, blueberrie or strawberry for something a little extra.  You have to make this ice cream!!!!!!  Thank you!!!!!! I don't have an ice cream machine but it does not matter.

Oh my goodness, there should be a law against this, this is very good i mean very very very good.  i just finished making this and just had a taste and its like heaven on earth.  I had cake batter cake once and it was so good, this tasted nothing like what i remember but this is still so great.  it does taste just like cake batter, its so smooth and creamy and all and all very easy to make.  i will make this again and again.  my only problem is it does not make a lot, not that i need it but geez this was excellent.  you have to try this, also i tasted this as it was cooking and i knew then i was gonna love it.

Really very good! I used yellow cake mix and it gave it a very slight "french vanilla" color, rather than pure white. It was not quite as strong in cake batter flavor as certain ice cream stores, but still good. I put cut up brownies in the ice cream maker in the last 5 minutes, and it was great!

With all the wonderful reviews I had hoped that I would be able to give one as well... unfortunately that is not the case. The icecream DID NOT turn out good at all. It never creamed up it just turned into an ICY cream and not an ICE-CREAM. I will not be making this again :\

Incredibly smooth ice cream that everyone in my household loved.  Be careful not to overcook the mixture, it will result in a pudding like consistency which can be slightly unappetizing and ultimately effect the texture of the final product. Also I'd recommend using a strainer to strain out all of the lumpy bits that might exist after cooking on the stove. I had to literally multiply this recipe times six to make enough  for my guests. I was a lot of work but WELL worth it!

First off don't agree with erin lol, this recipe is perfect the only thing I do agree with erin on this is to use yellow cake mix but only do the 3/4 cups anything more would be to sweet , and as far eggs are concerned use 2 large ,my wife's parents raise chickens so fresh eggs are a bonus. Can't really say much more about this recipe it is so freaking good lol only bad thing is my breville only makes 1.5 qts at a time a bigger quantity would be great, now to find a chocolate cake batter recipe

I'm a perfectionist and I make too many sweet things... including this fabulous ice cream.  Have made it twice now... different flavors- cakes mixes;  Pecan Butter (added some almond extract w/ it) and Triple Fudge.  Am going to do Strawberry today and add fresh strawberries.  Only change is I do 1 cup cake batter (and more vanilla b/c I like it).  Watch the thermometer close towards end as it rises quickly.  And keep stirring so you don't get thickening on bottom of pan.  This is my go to homemade ice cream as you can do ANY flavor cake mix.  I added marshmallows at end with the chocolate and we called it "Hot Chocolate" ice cream -totally tasted like it.  They set up nicely, but we don't mind eating too much before it has a chance to set up.  Also I doubled AND 2.5 times the amount as we have a 2 QT maker. So EASY, so GOOD!

I used one cup of French vanilla cake mix,1% milk and half-and-half cream. I had excellent creamy consistency and a good balance of cake flavour. It's really good but I will still experiment with other cake mixes until I find one that really blows me away. I will try yellow cake mix next.

I think this ice cream tastes better than the store-bought versions. I used a different mix of whipping cream, half and half, and milk, which made it less sweet, so I added an extra 1/2 cup of sugar to compensate. Scrumptious!

I doubled the recipe because once the recipe was made and I poured it into my ice cream freezer container, I realized it was not nearly enough, unfortunately, it still does not seem like it's going to be enough. All my other recipes call for filling to the "fill line" on my freezer container, but this does not come near it.

The first attempt didn't even make it into the ice cream machine. I did add a 1/4 cup (Pillsbury yellow) cake mix, but followed the recipe instructions exactly. The mixture turned into extremely thick pudding around 140F. I chilled it in the fridge, and in a few hours it had become even more sluggish and a bit separated. It seems that the cake mix acted like cornstarch. But I was determined to make cake batter ice cream, so I ended up remaking the mixture, omitting the eggs and skipping the cooking step all together. I didn't want to waste what little cake mix was left so ended up using close to 1.5 cups of cake mix. Without the heat, this didn't seem to be a problem. The eggless version worked well in the ice cream machine and, although hardened slightly in the freezer, was still workable the next day. I quite liked the taste and texture wasn't bad, although a little bit of grittiness was left from the cake mix. Would make the eggless, uncooked version again. Certainly not using the written recipe again unless I want gelatinous cake batter pudding. If you are set on a cake batter ice cream recipe with eggs, I'd guess your best choices are to either not fully cook the eggs or to add the cake mix after bringing the rest of the mixture to 160F and letting it cool back to room temperature. Also, add the vanilla extract after cooking so you don't loose the flavor.

The first time I made it as is and it was way too much cream for me. The second time I did part milk and part cream and that was perfect. Really good flavor

This ice cream was fabulous! It definitely beat out recipes I was given years ago. Of course, I made some minor changes- I omitted the egg yolks since I'm not crazy about custard-type ice creams and I just mixed the cake mix right into the cream mixture(I used DH's French Vanilla). I was in a rush and didn't have time to cook/cool the mixture before freezing it. It saved a step and I can't imagine it could be anymore delicious if I'd done it the other way!

Yummmm! That was the comment made by all who tasted the ice cream.

This was super good. I made it for my husband's 33rd birthday since he doesn't like cake and requested a pumpkin cheesecake instead. (I wanted cake! LOL) I used my Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer ice cream maker attachment and it worked like a charm. The only change I made was to add tiny little rainbow sprinkles to make it more festive. Great recipe. Will definitely make again.

This was easy for the steps you must go through for making ice cream.  I was impressed when I tasted it.  It melts creamier than store bought ice cream.  Look up recipes to use your left over cake mix.  I made cake mix cookies but next time will try the apple crunch.

Simply put, this ice cream is phenomenal!  I baked a birthday cake for a friend who decided he wanted cake-flavored ice cream to go with it.  So, I made an ice cream cake roll, and used this for the filling.  I had a REALLY hard time not sampling it to death while it was in the ice cream maker, and the cake roll turned out fantastic because of it.  Thank you for sharing this!!

Yum! I no longer have cravings to go to ColdStone or MaggieMoos to get some of this stuff. It is so easy to make (does need to be done a bit ahead of time though) and tastes almost identical to the stuff at the icecream shops! I would use yellow cake mix as opposed to white because yellow has a stronger flavor for the icecream. Just as a tip to others 3/4 cup of cake mix ends up being about half of the package.

I used 1 cup of cake mix, and actually just used all whole milk instead of cream. It's just what I had on hand since I forgot to buy cream at the store. It still turned out great. A little hard when left in the freezer overnight since it was just milk, but I'm sure it would be great with cream.

I made this with a cup of the cake batter and accidently bought half and half rather than whipping cream. Still tastes like the real thing! Mixed in sprinkles, brownie bits, and fudge. YUM!

Amazing! I used yellow butter cake mix and skim milk (because skim milk might make a difference with all of that cream?) and the results were better than I could have imagined! Tasty and easy!!

This was SO good! The only complaint I have was that it didnt make a big enough batch and it was gone too fast!! I will be making this again very soon! It was pretty easy to make too. This was my first time making ice cream and it turned out amazing! Next time I will try chocolate cake mix.
