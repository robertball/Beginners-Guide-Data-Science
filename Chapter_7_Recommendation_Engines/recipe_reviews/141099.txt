Huuuge hit at our house tonight. I've never seen "spreadable" goat cheese, so I took a regular log and mashed it with a bit of sour cream until it was smooth and spreadable. Great combination of flavors.

Outstanding.  For a truly decadent version, cook the duck breast first and save the rendered fat.  Slice a potato thinly and drizzle the duck fat over the slices before roasting them in the oven.  Add the roast potato slices as another layer of the pizza.  I also used goat cheese which had honey added.  Really, great fun recipe.

This is unbelievably good! Even my picky eater requests this on a weekly basis! I did tweak the recipe. I used the duck fat and the same pan with 1/2 the oil to cook the onions. This flavors the onions and adds another level of flavor. Cook the onions but salt and pepper to taste and add 1/2 teaspoon of minced or smashed garlic. When the onions are lightly browned, add 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar and another tablespoon of honey, reduce until the liquid is almost gone and very syrupy to make a balsamic reduction. Tastes just like the fancy flatbreads you get a restaurant.

We love this! I use Pizza Dough II from this site and bake at 500 on a pizza stone. Also I use cooked chicken instead of duck. Try it, it's different and so good.

This recipe is amazing.  I have never eaten duck, so I substituted chicken.  I have made it three times so far, and will keep making it.  Everyone that has tried it has loved it.  Thanks for sharing!

The first bite was delicious, but after a few more bites, the richness became so ovewhelming that my husband and I both put it down and couldn't eat any more. Since I only used 4 ozs of the goat cheese, I can't imagine this pizza with all 8 ozs! I took one reviewer's advice to add some potatoes roasted in a drizzle of the duck fat... the potatoes alone were yummy, but they got lost in the richness of the pizza. I really wanted to love this dish; this recipe has the components of a really great gourmet pizza. I will try it again, though, either drastically cutting back on the goat cheese or even eliminating it altogether.

Love, love, love this!  I have been looking for a recipe like this every since I had it as an appetizer in a gourmet restaurant.  This was just like it except they had thinly sliced grilled/roasted potatoes on theirs so I added that.  PERFECT!!

This wasnt terrible but I didnt really enjoy the combo of goat cheese and duck together. I did however LOVE the caramelized onions with a bit of honey and the fontina cheese with the duck. I believe I will make this again however I will look for a different base.

Absolutely amazing...something you'd find on an upscale restaurant's menu but easy to do at home!  I used the breast meat from a whole roasted duck and used fresh rosemary.  This has made it onto our top recipes list for sure and will definitely be reproduced for company!

This pizza has to be the best i have ever tasted.  I don't buy pizza bases, i make them.  I would never have thought to spread goats cheese over the base but it is so morish i have made it twice now and will keep making it, highly recommended. ****

I was actually looking for a recipe for leftover duck breast when this caught my eye. I did make several changes, as I didn't have fontina, and spreadable goat cheese, and will purchase those items and make it again. I made a cream sauce with garlic and heavy cream and added a little salt for the base. I had some feta crumbles with basil and tomato and shredded Parmesan. We all enjoyed it very much, thank you, your recipe gave me good ideas to use what I had.

Delicious!  This pizza is EXTREMELY rich, I loved it but my fiance thought it was too much.  More for me!  If you are using wild duck, it doesn't reheat well.

Fantastic! My boyfriend doesn't like onions but he loved this recipe! It tasted very gourmet and buttery. We weren't able to find fresh duck but did find frozen duck at Whole Foods that worked just fine. I'll definitely make this again!

This was so good.  I used pre-cooked duck, made my own pizza crust, and cooked it on a charcoal grill.  I think next time I will use the orange sauce that comes with the pre-cooked duck instead of the honey.
