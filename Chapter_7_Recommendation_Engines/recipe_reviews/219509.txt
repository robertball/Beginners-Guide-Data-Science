Use a blender! Don't try to just stir it as the recipe says. Been making this for years...in my Tucson Arizona family, it's known as "Pink Dip". Also, any brand of salsa will work, just use your favorite: hot, medium, or mild. This is always a hit and I get asked for the recipe every time I take it anywhere! I'm sure a food processor would work too....but I just soften the cream cheese a bit and throw it in the blender. Perfect every time.

I only used approximately 8 ounces of salsa (didn't have any picante sauce) and it tasted great!  It was served for a dinner party as an appetizer, and the guests loved it!
