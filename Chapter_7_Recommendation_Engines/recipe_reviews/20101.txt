Great summer sidedish. I think next time i will use less horseradish. it was a little over powering. Not a good dish for kids, but great for the adults.

This recipe was GREAT!  A really good flavor that tasted good even as leftovers.

Warning:  I used cream style horseradish instead of what the recipe called for.  It really increased the heat!
