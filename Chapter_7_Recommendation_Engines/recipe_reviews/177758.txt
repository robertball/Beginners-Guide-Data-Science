I give it 3 stars as it's written but with my changes it's a 4.5. Almost a 5. My changes: regular brown rice (not instant), fresh broccoli and carrots, and LOTS of seasonings. I seasoned the chicken before browning with garlic powder, salt, pepper, and onion powder and browned them in butter. I used chicken broth (low sodium) in the rice in place of the water and used cream of chicken and roasted garlic soup. With all that, it was good and I'll make it again-would have been pretty bad without, I think.

I was a little apprehensive at first about making this recipe just because of other reviews about it being kind of bland. So I changed it up a bit, I seasoned the chicken before i browned it with onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper and paprika on both sides. I also threw in 2 chicken boullion cubes and I think that helped with the flavor ALOT. next time i will use instant white rice and not brown i did not like the texture. After modifications GREAT comfort dish, my guests all wanted more!

We love this recipe. Instead of water I used chicken broth and I also topped this dish with about a cup of mild cheddar cheese.  My picky family love when we have this dish for dinner.

My husband asked me to make this when he found the recipe in a magazine.  Even for him, it was way too bland.  Addition of herbs and spices may help, but I won't be making it again to find out.

This is easy but I found it very bland. However just adding some garlic power and black pepper helped a great deal.  My grandkids loved it and  even asked me to make it again.  It really needs some doctoring up with herbs.

This was very good! I listened to other reviewers and seasoned my chicken well and also added in 2 chicken bouillon cubes for extra flavor! However, next time i may cook my rice first, then add it to the mixture.

This was pretty tasty, easy to make, simple comfort food.  Cream of chicken sounded too boring so I used broccoli cheese soup and cream of mushroom soup instead, and I added some canned mushrooms too.  The rice took longer than I had hoped, but that was probably user error on my part. It turned out yummy in the end, and the chicken was so moist and tender. I'll definitely be making this again. The leftovers were good too.

It is a good weeknight dish when you want something quick with minimal ingredients on hand. Just reading the recipe I thought it sounded pretty bland and "blah" like "food for the elderly" so I doctored it up by using only 3/4 can of the soup and mixing in 1/4 c light sour cream (you could use plain Greek yogurt instead, if you prefer). I cooked the rice before adding, since brown rice seems to take a little longer, and seasoned my chicken before cooking as well. It was a satisfying dinner; I took the leftovers to work with me the next day. Next time I may try one of the Philly cooking cremes as an add-in...

DEFINITELY follow the directions.  Except....season to taste on the chicken.  I tried a ton of alternates and ended up cooking MUCH longer than it asked because the rice took so long (5 minute rice with homemade makeshift cream of chicken soup).

This was excellent!  I'm usually not a big fan of brown rice but this was awesome!  I added some onion and garlic powder to the chicken as it was browning and omitted the oil.  I also added a few minutes to the simmer time to allow the rice to cook properly.

It was really easy to make, but it was really bland. I guess it would easy enough to season it some more, but I don't know enough about cooking yet to know what and how much to add.

Im not sure how this tastes when u follow the exact recipe... but i did a couple twists because of my budget and what i had in my pantry.  Instead of chicken breasts i used boneless skinless thighs, i used cheese broccoli soup instead of the creamy chicken and i used butter instead of oil.  I also added extra cheese on top of the finished product.  With these twists i consider it great! it tastes amazing! oh ya i added salt, a lot of salt for taste :)

Yummy!  I used Campbell's Cheddar Cheese Soup instead of the Cream of chicken, and it added some cheesiness to it!

everyone in my family LOVES this recipe! i use chicken stock instead of water when making the rice and it really helps add a little more flavor. i also add garlic powder, salt, peper, and paprika, on both sides of the chicken. it makes for a really flavorful and winning dish! someone always requests i make this at least once a week!

I actually found this recipe in the coupon section of the paper and since it was so quick and easy, we decided to try it.  I had bought the regular soup (not low fat or low sodium) and it was good.  Could have used a little more flavor.  There were alternate recipes, like reducing the water and using orange juice instead for an orange chicken.  We'll try that one next.  Kudos because it's a super quick meal and it has protein, veggie and a good carb!  More flavor would have gotten another star.

This was ok.  Campbell's has a recipe on their broccoli cheese 98% fat free soup that calls for similar ingredients (minus the rice/current soup and add the broccoli cheese soup) that is SO much better, doesn't need a ton of added spices, and we eat every other week (and I like cheese but I don't love broccoli cheese soup).  I won't make this again--just add rice to the other recipe.

Thought it was good, but a little bland the first time I tried it.  The second time, used chicken broth instead of water.  That fixed it.

I tried this tonight and it turned out pretty well. Per other reviews I added some garlic and butter when browning the chicken. I also added some more garlic at the end, as well as some salt and more black pepper. I might add this to the rotation, but try it with broccoli cheese soup next time.

I didn't make this exactly as the recipe says, but added chicken bouillon to the water/soup mixture, added garlic with parsley for added flavor, just like the other reviews. I did also add onions and cooked them with the chicken before I added it to the soup mixture. I cooked the rice first, since brown rice usually takes longer to cook (and I prefer not to use instant rice) and let it cook it's final 5 mins with the chicken mixture. With the modifications, it tasted pretty good and was the right consistency for me. Can't wait to see if the leftovers taste better.

This receipe is BLAH!! I tried to add more herbs as the other reviews recommended, but it still lacks excitement.  Needs a makeover from one of the chefs on food network! Big disappointment.

This recipe looks and sounds good but it was not. Even my husband who is not a picky eater at all said he didn't like it. There are way better chicken and rice dishes out there-don't bother with this one.

Better then some of the campbell's recipes I've tried. I seasoned the chciken with garlic and onion powder before cooking and it took longer to cook the rice then the recipe stated but all in all it was a good healthy easy meal to put together.

This recipe was really good but I do recommend that you season your chicken before you sauté it in the pan.Also when you are finished sautéing the chicken don't clean the pan. Use the same pan and prepare the rest of the dish. All the seasonings in the pan marry together.  I gave it three stars because I seasoned my own meat. Other than that it was really good. Family was pleased!

Tried it for dinner. Doubled the recipe. Seasoned chicken breasts with salt, black pepper, marjoram, onion and garlic powder before browning.  Used one can each cream of chicken and cream of mushroom. Didn't have instant brown rice on hand so used long grain brown rice, took too long for rice to cook.  Will try instant next time.  Family loved it. Will cook again.

I was a little hesitant to try this one with such mixed reviews. I do know that we like everything in it so, I figured, even if it was bland it would still be okay. I did make some changes as my husband can't have any dairy. I replaced the campbell's cream of chicken soup with my homemade dairy free cream of chicken soup (which does have a stronger flavor than the canned soup). That may have made the flavor better, as ours was not bland like many of the reviews say. I also used white rice instead of brown. The entire dish was gone and everyone's plates were clean. This was very easy and quick, so we will use it again.

After reading some of the reviews, I modified this recipe a bit too. I used butter instead of vegetable oil, and pre-seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder as well. I didn't have cream of chicken soup on hand, so I used cream of mushroom, and chicken broth instead of water. I am very happy with the flavor and results this way. it's delicious!

This recipe was a very big disapiontment from campbell's. I have always had pretty good luck at pleasing my family's picky taste with thier recipes. I tried brightening the recipe up with additional spices but it just wasn't enough. I won't be making this one again.
