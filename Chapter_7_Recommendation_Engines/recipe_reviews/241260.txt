I changed it up a bit. Substituting macaroni for rice, adding black beans and putting chips on the side as a scoop. It came out really good though!

I omitted the black olives, but otherwise my husband ate the whole thing in 3 days. It was easy and different to have something other than tacos on Tuesday.  
I did add extra cheese and he ate it with green salsa.

I made this the other night instead of tacos because we didn't have enough shells for regular tacos. I was a little skeptical when assembling it, but it turned out great!  I used up the 4 taco shells I had on hand in place of the tortilla chips and added black olives to the top. All 3 of my boys liked it. I served it with a side of rice and refried beans and it made a great weeknight meal. I will make this again.

I made it and we really liked it.  Even my picky eaters loved it.  I made some white Mexican cheese dip and added a drizzle over the ground beef layer.

Good...basically tacos in casserole form. I used Bill Echols' Taco Seasoning I, so I used the amount of seasoning and water that I normally use for taco meat. The one thing my husband said it was missing was salsa, an addition he placed on his second helping :)

It was really good. I topped it with Ortega taco ranch sauce and sour cream after it cooled a little bit and also used Doritos instead of regular tortilla chips.

This was very good, but I was confused about the recipe calling for 8 tortillas chips.  I used most of a bag but I think it was too much.  And I used 6 flour tortillas to cover the bottom.  
I cut it and and topped with fresh diced tomatoes and shredded lettuce.  I will make it again and modify the  quantity of chips.

This was very good.  Family enjoyed it.  Made a Mango-pineapple salsa to go with it.  Leftovers were even better the next day.

Very good! I omitted the soft flour tortllias and used all crunchy tortilla chips. I layered everything in the crock pot and heated 30 minutes or so until it all bubbled together. Will use this recipe again.
