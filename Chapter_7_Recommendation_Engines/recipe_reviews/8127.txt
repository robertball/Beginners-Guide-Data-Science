This cake was delicious but there are a few things I would change for next time.  First of all I would cut the frosting in half.  I baked it in a 13x9 pan and there was literally about an inch of frosting.  Also, 45 minutes is a little too long to bake it in a 13x9.  When I took it out it was just starting to get black and hard aroung the edges.  One last thing...next time I might add some raisins or nuts to the batter.  Thanx

I struggled with how many stars to rate this cake. I was not impressed with the cake itself or the recipe directions but the frosting was a real winner. Traditionally, a cake of this type has pretty standard directions: cream the butter or shortening and sugar(s), add eggs one at time, then add the sifted dry ingredients alternately with the liquid, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. The second problem is that the baking time as directed is far too long.  Even at 25 minutes, I believe my layer cake was overbaked, which I'm sure contributed to the third problem, which is that the cake was not nearly as moist as it should have been. The flavor was great, and I did add 1 tsp. of double-strength vanilla. Now the frosting is perfect - silky, fluffy, light and smooth, with just the right amount of maple flavor. But even here there was a problem. Other reviewers have commented they had too much frosting for their 9x13" cake. I, on the other hand, made a layer cake and did not have enough frosting to frost the sides.  Unfortunately, given the issues with the mixing and baking instructions and the fact that this was on the drier side, I can only call this an average cake, even though the frosting was simply perfect and beautiful.

This was good, but I did have to modify it. Like others, my cake was done in 25 minutes, and I was very thankful for the reviews or I might have walked away from the oven and ended up with a burnt cake! I split the batter into two nine inch rounds, so that may have had something to do with it. Otherwise the recipe was great, tasted just like the spice cake I remember. The spice ratio was PERFECT but overall not quite strong enough for me, so I would probably increase the spices by half next time, just to my own preference. I didn't have any maple extract so I tried substituting some of the sugar in the frosting for real maple syrup. The texture was fine but the maple flavor was hardly noticeable--just a warning for anyone else who might try the same thing ;0). 
Otherwise it was great. Thanks for the recipe!

Spice cake is my favorite cake, as well. I have been wanting to try this recipe, but was worried the high ratings were more for the frosting than the cake. Not to worry! I did make a few changes, but nothing that substantially changed the recipe. Most of my changes were in the directions because I'm really anal when it come to preparation. First I sifted the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, and cloves, but not the white sugar. I substituted unsalted butter for the shortening and creamed it with the white and brown sugars. I then beat in the eggs (one at a time, as directed), as well as a teaspoon of vanilla extract.
Finally, I added the flour mixture (in fourths) alternately with the buttermilk (in thirds), beginning and ending with the flour mixture. I know this sounds complicated and time consuming, but it really isn't. I baked my cake in a 13x9 pan for 35 minutes. 45 minutes is too long. I always use an oven thermometer, so I know my oven is correct. Anyway, I frosted it with a traditional cream cheese frosting, and my husband and I both thoroughly enjoyed it! So, thank you Stephanie, from both of us!!

The frosting was superb!  I added an extra 1/2 tsp. maple flavoring to the frosting since the flavor was too subtle.  The cake, however, was very dry.  I'll keep the frosting recipe and search for another spice cake recipe to go with it.

Spice cake and carrot cake are tied as my favorite.  I loved this recipe, but made a couple of healthy changes.  I used Splenda in place of the white sugar, olive oil in place of shortening, and added a cup of applesauce for moisture.  I did not substitude anything in the frosting (best part), but cut it in half and had enough.  Thanks.

WHEN WILL I LEARN??? This cake is not good.  It's dry, just like pretty much everyone else has said... but noooooooooooo, I had to try it anyway thinking my superior talent in the kitchen could side step the inequities of this recipe.    The edges of the cake were hockeypuck-esque. The inside was dry and crumbly.  I creamed the sugar/shortening and even increased the shortening to meet 1/2 the sugar level.  Beat in the eggs one at a time, added the dry mixture to the wet, adding buttermilk inbetween scoops of flour - didn't overmix.  I gave it all I had... Please folks... stop rating the frosting!  When will I learn to trust the reviews?  When will I learn?

The cake itself is delicious and moist, with a wonderful texture.  The smell of the cake baking had my son's mouth watering.  We couldn't wait any longer and iced it while it was still slightly warm.  I did make a couple of small changes -- I used all butter instead of butter and shortening, and half the quantity of icing was perfect for the sheet cake version. YUM!  Next time, I will add some ginger and some allspice to the batter.  To those who claim the cake is dry, I suspect that you're using too much flour.  Make sure to sift it thoroughly BEFORE measuring.

This spice cake has just the right amount of spice.  It is neither too dry nor too moist and keeps well.
     To reduce the calories from sugar and fat, I topped each piece of cake with a dollop of Cool Whip instead of using the maple frosting.  It made an excellent light topping.
     I wondered about the mixing instructions in the recipe.  The order given is not the usual way of mixing cake batters.  I mixed the ingredients in the following order: I creamed softened butter with the sugars, beat in the eggs one at a time, then added the dry ingredients alternately with the buttermilk.  This method worked well.
     Finally, be careful of baking time!  I used a 13x9 pan.  I first checked the cake after 30 minutes, and it was done after 35 minutes.

My family loved this cake and it was a very easy cake to make. The cake itself was very light compared to other spice cakes I've tried and the maple frosting was not overpowering. Will definitely make this again.

I made this cake for my mom's birthday and it turned out wonderfully moist and delicious. I sifted the flour before measuring and then sifted the dry ingredients together. I followed the suggestion to use all butter. The frosting was the perfect amount to frost an 8" layer cake. Would definitely make this again.

I was looking for an icing to go with a boxed spice cake so I didn't make the cake for this recipe but I did make the icing following the recipe precisely. The icing was delicious with just a hint of maple, not an overpowering maple flavor.

This cake is quite dry.  I wish I could figure out a way to make it moister.  Yet it had a nice flavor.  I made half the frosting and it barely was enough to frost the cake in a 9x13 pan.  I won't make this cake again though because it was so dry.

I love spice cake and made these birthday cupcakes for a friend.  I used a real maple butter cream with egg whites so I could make them look like ice cream scoops on top of the cakes.  The glaze was simply powdered sugar and maple flavoring with a touch of food coloring to caramelize it's look.  They came out so great I will be using this again, especially when the holidays come.  They would taste great with eggnog.

Perfect!  Moist and delicious with just the right amount of spices.  We don't like cloves so just added a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg.  I measure flour by weight - used 11 oz.  Delicious!

I used the frosting recipe on a box mix for spice cake.  It was delicious.  I only put in 3cups confectioner's sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Also I substituted one tsp of the milk with some vanilla.  I was worried the maple flavor was going to be too strong.  Lastly, I grated fresh nutmeg across the top for a small decor. My entire extended family really liked it. This was a great recipe for the frosting at least.

This is like straight butter and sugar.  The recipe made plenty of frosting and maybe that was the problem, but the butter was overpowering and even after adding an extra 1/2 tsp of maple, it was bland.  It was not light by any means and the thud in my stomache was unmistakeable.  I am sorry but this was awful.  I threw half the cake away and will not make again.

This rating is for the Maple Buttercream only, which is great! The only thing that would make it better would be a dash of salt. I used it to ice Pumpkin Cake III, which I filled with Brown Sugar Cream Cheese Frosting. Yum!

I am giving "Thumbs Up" for the icing!   I ended up using a different spice cake recipe, similar but more buttermilk to flour ratio to ensure it came out moist enough... and I am glad I did that because ended up being just right. It would have been too dry to use any less.  This cake was for Dad's birthday, so it needed to be great and couldn't be dry.  This was a perfect combination, and this cake was gone quite quickly!  My husband still is talking about it, and keeps telling me I need to keep this recipe.  Thank you for suggesting such a "hit" with a different flavor combination!

I baked mine in a 9 x 13 pan for 35 minutes. This cake has a terrific taste, but it's dry, like some other reviewers have said (and note that's without overbaking it). I think another 1/2 c. of buttermilk might help, but I'm not sure it the cake would rise correctly. Anyway, the frosting is really yummy. While making just half the frosting for a 9 x 13 is cutting it thin, it can certainly be done if you add a few tablespoons of milk, no problem.

Dry seems to be the word of the day with this cake.  I used ginger instead of cloves and added some vanilla to the cake and the frosting.  Also, I did not have any maple flavoring, so I just used maple syrup instead of the milk in the frosting, which was amazing.  I had ample frosting for my two-layer cake -- I'm not sure what the problem was with other reviewers there.  However, I must strongly agree with the rest who said the cake was dry, dry, dry.  The problem is not with the preparation, as I followed a more classic preparation technique of creaming the butter and sugar first, then adding the eggs, sifting the flour, and so forth.  Though the flavor was good, the cake was dry to the point that it made me not like it.  I have had two different people tell me that spice cakes are always dry.  Maybe that's so -- I'll try a different recipe next time to find out.

I made this cake with the Cream Cheese Frosting II instead of the maple frosting and doubled the cinnamon.  The taste of the cake was excellent, but like others have mentioned, it came out too dry.  I think next time I will try sifting the flour before measuring it to get less dry ingredients.

This cake tasted wonderful.  We couldn't get enough of it!!  However, it doesn't need to be baked for 45 minutes.  I took mine out after 40, and the bottom was almost black.  It did make a bit too much frosting too, but I think it would have been wonderful layered.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!  This is definetely a keeper!

This is a great recipe; just the right level of spiciness, and simple to mix up.  I used store bought frosting (the boyfriend insists), and it's delicious.  It's even better the second day, I think.

Overall, it's a great cake.! I didn't use the recipe for frosting, as my bf doesn't care for the maple flavoring on non-breakfast foods. I used a cream cheese frosting instead and it worked well. It WAS slightly on the dry side, as others mentioned, and that was after adding about 1/3 cup sour cream. I would probably increase that just a bit more. I might also up the spices just a bit too, just for personal preference. I will make again!

The kids all ate it. Used butter instead of shortening. Mixed it like a regular cake recipe - not the crumble way. Frosted with a Easy Penuche Icing. Very moist, flavorful.

I didn't have cloves, so I used Allspice, and probably used too much.  I believe this was a big mistake.  The cake was, indeed, dry.  I have a gas oven, and after 25 minutes, the cake was too done on the outside, but definitely not done on the inside.  The icing was okay, but I would have liked a more buttery flavor.  For some reason, I couldn't stand the smell of the icing when I was mixing it!  I found this to be a strange cake and threw it out after having a small piece.

I doubled all of the spices, and used butter instead of shortening.  It was delicious!  Moist and dense, and I got raves.  I also made a blackberry filling, and used Cream Cheese II frosting found on this website.  This will definitely be my spice cake recipe from now on!

This is a very nice cake.  I will cook it a bit less next time as it was a bit dry.  I used a 9x13 pan and cooked it 40 minutes.  There is plenty of icing and it could be halved for those who do not care for the sweetness

Having read many reviews that this cake was dry, I tweaked it a bit. Used 1/2 c unsalted butter, cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup, creamed the butter and sugars together first, and after adding the eggs I added a cup of applesauce (half unsweetened plain, half cinnamon). I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1 c milk with 1 tbsp lemon juice. Doubled the spices. Baked for 35 min in a 9x13 glass pan and it was PERFECT. For the frosting, I also took reviewer recommendations and cut it to half. Used 1/2 c butter, 2 c powdered sugar total, 1 tbsp plus 1/2 tsp of milk, and 1 tsp maple flavoring. I also added 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the frosting and it was delicious. To everyone complaining about a dry, crumbly cake, ADD APPLESAUCE! And don't over-mix! Still moist and delicious the second day, though there isn't much of it left...

I had trouble with the cake sticking to the bottom of the pan, use parchment paper, I had altered it to be vegan, so not completely a fair test of this recipe.  I sort of pushed it together and used the excellent frosting with vegan butter.  I also added freshly grated ginger and a touch of molasses and it was very tasty, just a mess to look at.

Very good cake! No problems with moisture, as I layered the buttermilk with the dry ingredients and turned back the baking time. Just a note, I don't usually have buttermilk hanging around, so if I have a recipe that calls for it I combine 1 cup of milk with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. This is a great substitute!

Very good cake!! I made it to have on christmas eve. I did make some changes though... to make it easier, I used a yellow cake mix I had on hand. I combined the mix with all of the spices (definitely add extra!!), then I beat the mixture with the water and oil that the boxed mix called for and beat in the eggs seperately. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. The frosting recipe was perfect! Overall, I didn't find the cake to be too dry. The amount of frosting made was perfect for a layered cake and compliment it very nicely. It made it VERY sweet, but thats exactly what I like so no complaints!

This was a good recipe that translated well to cupcakes. The full recipe made about 18 regular-sized cupcakes, and LOTS of frosting. I used less than half of it. The frosting was the best part, though it was slightly greasy and shortening-y. I would make it again, but with a different frosting with maple added.

I was really bummed. This cake took me half a day to cook, cool and frost. And it turned out very dry. The frosting was too sweet and I'm not sure maple frosting belongs on a spice cake anyway. The cake itself has a good flavor but it was much too dry. Will be sticking with the box mix unless I find another recipe.

Came out dry, and not my favorite. It was pretty easy though, and might been a bigger hit had it been more moist.

WAY too much frosting! But the cake was excellent!! I will be making another cake today to use up the other half of the frosting from the first batch. Next time I will cut the frosting measurements in half. I also had to alter the cook time to 50 minutes (9x9 spring form pan).

everyone in my family really enjoyed this cake.(especially my 3 yr. old) i made this recipe exactly and baked it in 9 in. pans which only took about 25 mins. instead of the suggested 30 -35. i also toasted and chopped some pecans and put them on the top and sides, DELICIOUS!

Flavorful and moist! My husband loved it. I used cream cheese in the frosting and whipped it light. I am so thrilled with this recipe. Perfect for fall. Thank you so much!

This was an absolutely great cake.  Very tender, light, tasty, and not too spicy.  The maple frosting, which I thought would be too much on top of a spice cake, was perfect.  Kudos to Stephanie!!

I increased the spices by about 1/2 teaspoon each on this recipe and added a teaspoon of ginger and it was great, though maybe a bit dry. Tasted better (and moister) the next day. As for the frosting, I made it but tossed it out and used a butter-based caramel frosting recipe. It's just a matter of preference, but I thought the shortening in the frosting tasted greasy.

I have made this cake twice - the first time was with a cream cheese icing and the second time with the maple buttercream.  Both were absolutely delicious.  The first batch was cupcakes and they came out light and fluffy!

This was an excellent starting point to make a really good spice cake!  I used butter in place of shortening and bumped it up a bit to address the dryness that was mentioned in comments.  The spice combination was very good and I added a little extra of each.  The cake was still a little dry, but not bad.  Maybe add a little oil?  Definitely watch & don’t overcook it.  It goes from not done to done in a very short time.

This review is only for the FROSTING from this recipe:  love, love, loved the frosting.  I used it to frost 'Nutmeg Feather Cake' from AR.  Creamy texture that held up well with great taste!

I just baked this cake. It has a delicious flavor,but mine didn't cook in the middle. I tested it with a toothpick, which came out clean, but it was not nearly cooked in the middle. We will eat the parts around the middle like coffeecake, since it is so good. Next time I will use 3 pans as suggested in other reviews & I think it'll do nicely!

I have made this three times for my dad's birthday now and each time everyone loves it.  I had family who usually refuse to eat cake asking me to make this for their birthdays now.  I usually double the spices because my dad really likes things full of flavor. I've also done a regular butter cream frosting with the spices added in and it also tasted great.

I thought the spice was a bit on the heavy side. My daughter liked the amount of spice but didn't like the texture....so wasn't a keeper for either of us.

The maple frosting is wonderful !!  I made some pumpkin cupcakes and thought this icing would compliment them. WOW! It really did.
My hubby thought it was maybe a little strong on the maple flavor, but he really liked them the next day. It is sweet, but hey, it's frosting. I will definitely make this again.

HI! I was in a hurry and needed a great tasting maple frosting. This was great! I twisted it up a little, I didn't have the best maple flavoring, I had to use a lot more than a tsp. So, I also used some Coffee Mate Pumpkin Spice coffee creamer in the liquid form instead of so much milk. I doubled the recipe as well. YUMMY! Oh and I used more butter than  shortening , just for personal taste reasons. I put this on a spice cake I had. Next time I'll surely try the cake recipe too. This is fun, delicious, and has fantastic flavor! I got the idea to use coffee mate since I use the Vanilla Coffee Mate Fat Free mixed in with eggs and cinnamon for french toast batter. Try it, it's yummy too.

I didn't try the cake, but I picked this recipe for the frosting.  I was looking for something different, and maple frosting sounded wonderful on top of the applesauce spice cake I made.  Instead of maple flavoring, I added maple syrup.  Like another reviewer noted, the flavor wasn't very strong, so I ended up adding around five to six tablespoons of real maple syrup.  I also used 1 cup of butter instead of 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening.  In my opinion, it gives a better taste and a fluffier frosting.  All in all, the frosting had wonderful coloring and gave just a hint of maple flavor.  Thanks so much!

My uncle is not a fan of chocolate, but he does like spice cake.  I made this for his birthday one year and he always requests it now.  I usually make a layer cake rather than a sheet cake, and I think the extra icing between the layers helps keep the cake soft.  Yum!

Perfect!  Spice cake is my granfather's favorite cake and I made this for his birthday - he loved it.  I did make a few changes based on reviews and personal preference: did 1/2 whole wheat flour, 2t cinnamon, 2t nutmeg, and 1/2 t cloves, substituted butter for shortening and added 1/2 c applesauce.
My grandfather loves penuch icing so I did that instead of the buttercream.

I got to admit, this was a pretty good cake. The whole process took about 4 hours. The cake itself was pretty good (although more spice would have made it amazing)and the frosting was nice and thick. My only problems though were that the frosting was way too sweet and that there wasnt enough maple flavor. I'll try this recipe again, albeit next time with some changes.

Very yummy, and easy to make. I thought the buttercream frosting was a bit too sweet, so will probably try cream cheese frosting next time, but it is a fabulous spice cake.

Very VERY good spice cake. My family loves the frosting. Best when served chilled! It really was not that hard to make either!

A wonderful spice cake recipe. I made it just as the recipe says and it turned out great (except the cakes did collapse). The cake has wonderful flavor and the frosting was a great addition.

I think I baked my cake for a little too long because it came out a little dry.  I thought the frosting was a bit too greasy tasting but everyone that tried absolutly loved it and commented on the frosting and how good they thought it was.

Excellent cake with a good texture. I used cream cheese frosting instead, and it was great. I also added more  of the spices, plus a little ginger.

The frosting on this cake is absolutely incredible!!  The cake could use a little more spice, but overall it's terrific...I would suggest this to anyone!  My family loved it!
