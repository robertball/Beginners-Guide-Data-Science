Super easy, makes a delicious gravy with a super moist turkey breast. My only criticism is that it certainly doesn't take 10 minutes to get everything into the crockpot, it's more like two minutes! I've made this recipe multiple times and it's great every time.

Made this turkey today and it was delicious! Very moist and the gravy had a great flavor. Including side dishes, this recipe was the perfect amount for 4 ppl. I will be making this again for the upcoming holidays.

This turned out amazing. The turkey fell right off the bone and my boyfriend now thinks I'm the best cook. I substituted cream of celery for cream of mushroom (all I had on hand) and it still tasted wonderful. Easy and delicious, will definitely be making again.

I followed the recipe as it was and it turned out tender just as other viewers stated, however, I wasn't happy with the taste of my turkey breast; I usually use my own way of cooking it but I wanted to try this one.  I would recommend this recipe to a new beginner cook but for a professional, I needed something more to get the taste I wanted, so I give it a three star rating.

Seems too simple to be so great but it really is! This is the 3rd time I'm making a turkey breast in my slow cooker this way.

The ingredients were so strange I knew it must be good - and it was! My only addition was a little Knorr Chicken flavor bouillon - just added a little more depth of flavor.

I made this .  I followed the very simple recipe except I put salt and pepper on the turkey breast before adding the soup.  I put it on low in th slow cooker.  It was done after four to five hours.  Had I cooked it for eight hours  it would have been way too done.  It fell of the bone as it was.  My family loved it.  I will definitely make it again.

Amazing recipe. Super easy to throw together before work and really delicious when we got home. I wished we had doubled it for leftovers!

Weirdest recipe ever and it is AMAZING.  I don't know why this works so well.  I made it for the 1st time Thanksgiving 2016.  So EASY and tasty.  The turkey fell off the breast bone and the gravy was perfect.  

I used my oven for a standing rib roast.  Making turkey in a slow cooker was a "favor" to the one person in our group that likes turkey.  Wow, everyone loved this turkey.  I didn't tell them the recipe until after dinner.  They still think I'm crazy.

Very good.   Only took about 6 hours to cook a 5.5 lb. Turkey breast on low.  Don't want to overcook.

This was my first slow cooker turkey dish. Reason for four star I overcooked went for the 8 hrs recommended. use a thermometer and start checking at 5 hrs. really good flavor will try again. I was worried about 2 cans of concentrated soup but came out just fine. I did use a liner worked really well for coup mixes.

LOVED IT!! My husband does not usually like turkey because it is so dry. He loved it. He actually asked me to make it again. Turkey is so tender. I did not use cheese soup because I forgot to buy it at store.

I put mine on at about 12:30 PM, and by 4:00 it was totally done. I served this over sticky rice with a few extra mushrooms that I happened to have that I caramelized and then added at the end.  This was comfort food, and we appreciated it.

Yum and so very easy. Made with green bean casserole (in oven) and served with fruit. Simple but fancy meal for us!!!! ;)
