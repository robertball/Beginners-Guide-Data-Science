Delicious!  I changed the sugar to 1/2 cup and used a whisk to mix the batter instead of a blender.  They were very fluffy!  The reviewers that had flat pancakes likely mixed the batter too much.  You want the batter to be a little lumpy.

Finally a pancake recipe that does not leave the after taste caused by Baking Soda!  I have been searching for a good homemade pancake recipe since I gave up the box 3 weeks ago and I finally found this one.  The only thing I did differently was mix it by hand instead of in the blender.  It was slightly lumpy, but they went away once I poured it on the griddle and it turned out great.  Even my 2-year-old who doesn't like to chew ate them...and without syrup!

We loved this recipie.  We omitted the oil in the mix, and halved the vanilla.  Was not rubbery.  With my favourite topping - sprinkle of sugar and lemon juice it was just divine. Very easy to make.

Pancakes are too sweet for pancakes.  They seem very rubbery - not a good texture.  Didn't like them at all.

I LOVE this recipe.  This has got to be the best pancake recipe ever.  I hate thick pancakes and these come out with what I want to call almost crepe like taste and texture (except thicker)  
I make them and freeze in the freezer and they are wonderful!!

I love this recipe. I have been using it for over a year now and it always turns out great. I always add lots of extra cinnamon, use half the amount of sugar, double the recipe and use a hand mixer or whisk. I freeze the extra pancakes for my kids to eat during the week. Very good!

So normally other reviewers really give great advice so I listened with these and reduced the sugar. Mistake! Stick with the original amount! They need it. Didn't have regular milk or vanilla so subbed vanilla soy milk and tasted great. You need a big grill: the first few had a better texture than the last few. Batter does not rest well. But overall, a great pancake!

Great, quick and easy recipe!  I followed one of the reviewers and used just 1/3 cup of sugar.  I also did not have enough regular milk, so I subbed vanilla soy milk.  Worked out perfectly!!!!  Will defintely use this recipe again!!!!

I think they tasted good, the sweetness was fine for me. I like light syrup and that might make a difference. They were'nt very fluffy at all, I think I will try to add more flour and baking powder to change that. Otherwise, they were good.

It was slightly too sweet. We made the next batch with 1/4 cup of sugar and added more syrup at the end in our plates.

This recipe is really good. I ran out of vanilla and had to substituted almond extract. Also,this recipe is a little runny so I added 1/2 cup flour to thicken it up. My 4 year old loved them! It's a sweeter pancake than most I've made from scratch.

this was a very bad recipe- I saw the reviews that were bead before I made them- should have not made this recipe- it was very flat- rubbery- I even added more flour later and b. powder- still the same- would not recommend making- especially if you are low on ingredients already. A waste.

Major points on simplicity of preparation.  Definitely very fast and easy, but WAY TOO sweet.  The texture is more dense, not as fluffy as others, but that's the way my hubby likes them.  Next time I will cut the sugar to 1/2 cup or maybe even 1/3, and maybe cut the baking powder to 1 Tbs.

I'm giving this 4 stars because they are fast and easy, and my husband was happy with them. But they are not pancakes, they are modified crepes, hence the "rubbery" texture. They are MUCH too sweet to me, so the second time I made them I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, perfect amount of sweetness for me. I also found the vanilla flavor overwhelming so I reduced it to 1/2 teaspoon, which was fine. This recipe also has a TON of baking powder in it, which is funny because it doesn't do much for the pancakes, they are almost completely flat. The second time I made them I even let the batter sit for 15-20 minutes, hoping that it would activate enough to make a difference, it didn't. Maybe just one egg would make the batter lighter. I think I'll tweak this a bit then update the review and let you all know how it goes.

This was my staple pancake recipe because like it says its fast and easy. The only thing that changed is my boyfriend (who is the one eating them) confessed he really didnt like them. Too sweet. Tasted more like a cake or pastry.

THIS IS MY FIRST REVIEW!! I have made this several times now (My 5 year old eats pancakes every morning) it is really fast & easy. One change I made was to reduce the milk, only because I like pancakes that are a little thicker. This is in my recipe book for years to come!!

I love this recipe!! However, I can see why it is not for everyone. The pancakes do turn out very swet and have a slightly rubbery texture. I think they're great, I have made them several time following the recipe exactly. I have also made them when I was almost out of milk, and used 2/3 water intead, and they turned out just as good :)

It is fast and easy, but at the expense of everything else. Baking-soda taste. To sweet. Bland. To decrease the baking soda would make these already flat pan-cake even more flat. Reduce sugar, add salt. .  . create comepletely different recipe.

If you like fluffy pancakes these are not for you. This batter was wat too runny for me. I added more flour adn they turned out tough and bland. My family hated them. Was a waste of time and ingredients.

Although it is a fast and easy recipe, the pancakes were quite flat.  My family likes light and fluffy pancakes.  I would not make these again.

These were fast and easy, I'll give 'em that, BUT they were way too sweet and the batter was runny. My kids liked them because they tasted like cookies. I will make them again but next time I'll cut the sugar in half (or less!) and add a little more flour. Worth a try because they are so easy.

Batter was runny.  First batch made something more like a crepe.  After adding flour I still had very thin, bland pancakes.

This was fabulous....so fast and easy.  I made them in my Kitchenaid Mixer and cut the sugar down but added a little more flour.  This is wonderful.  I doubled the batch so I could freeze them and make microwave pancakes for my boys.  They love it!  Thank you

This recipe was not only delicious, but it's also just like the title says ... fast and easy. Plus I loved that I could throw everything in the blender all at once, and it was ready to cook within just a few minutes! That's exactly what I need for my house having two hungry toddlers to cook for. Also my husband is picky about pancakes because he loves thin pancakes rather then thick.  So after reading the previous reviews I knew this would be perfect for him. I did take the advice that some of you gave about cutting the suagar to 1/2 cup rather then the 3/4 cup

What a mess!  This recipe didn't mix well in the blender and either burned on the stove or was uncooked.  The kids ended up eating cereal for breakfast.  Back to the old pancake recipe.

This was the first time I ever made pancakes and they turned out very well. The sugar sweetened it nicely and I hardly used any syrup. The kids enjoyed them too. The first couple of batches I just poured some batter onto the griddle and when I flipped them I pushed down on them because I was worried that the middle wouldn't be cooked through. Then I tried pouring an outer circle and letting the middle fill in inself and that worked nicely. Since there was just me and my young boys eating there were some left over. I put them in the fridge and when the boys want a snack I'll just nuke them. This recipe is a keeper!

I make these pancakes often as I am usually in a hurry to get out the door, but want a satisfying breakfast to start my day! The batter is a little thin, but I like thin pancakes -- I don't like the big heavy ones that feel like lead in your stomach. Great recipe!

3/4 cup sugar seemed a bit much, so I cut it back to 1/2 (they still came out great though, with just the right amount of sweetness. :) Also, the recipe makes a pretty thin batter, so I added about 1/8 extra cup of flour.  -Mary

Light and fluffy!  I didn't want to make it in the blender, so I whisked the batter, adding the flour by 1/4 cup at a time.  It came out just right.  I won't be adding the full amount of sugar next time, though.  It was a bit too sweet for my family.

I tried these pancakes because my daughter really wanted pancakes, but I wasn't feeling very well so I thought these would be quick and easy. I omitted the egg since my son is allergic, and they still came out awesome. I added chocolate chips once in the pan. We will be having these again one day when I can actually enjoy them without having to blow my nose a billion times.

I am known in the kitchen only for my ability to reheat frozen pizza - NOT make homemade anything. But this was so easy! I didn't use a blender - just a whisk so my daughter could help stir. I also did half whole wheat flour and half regular white flour. And, like a few others, I only used 1/2 cup sugar and added some cinnamon. Yummy!

Recipe was easy enough...but the batter turned out really runny, therefore I had really thin pancakes. It wasn't all bad, since I was making them for my son, and I could then just scoop 3 scoops out into the pan and make a big one. Good for 1/2 today and 1/2 tomorrow (he's 10months old) but they were not really what I was expecting. I won't be using this recipe again.

Followed directions exactly with the exception of the type of oil used.  I used safflower oil instead of vegetable.  Safflower has a higher burning point.

This is not what I would consider a pancake. I would have given 5 stars had the name been something more like what you get, such as a breakfast crepe. That being said I really loved these once I got over my panckae expectation. They are thin, sweet, and chewy. I am going to keep these stocked in the freezer for a quick breakfast. All they need is a smear of butter, nutella, or peanut butter. Roll it up and munch. If you want light and fluffy pancakes this is not the recipe for it, but you should try them for breakfast or dessert crepes.

This is a great basic recipe. The only change I made was I added 1/2 more flour to make it less runny...made 12 large pancakes! Husband approved! :)

These were terrific!  They didn't puff up like some pancakes do...they stayed nice and flat but airy too!  Nice and easy for those late night breakfast lovers!

We did not care for this recipe, they were very thin and slightly rubbery, but that was not the thing that made me unhappy, they leave an unpleasant aftertaste.  I am more of a thick and fluffy pancake person.

These are very eggy in texture, sort of rubbery.  And I agree with other reviewers, they are much too sweet for pancakes.

In my opinion they were too sweet. But, when I think about it, most children might like these pancakes, they just weren't for me and my family.

Excellent flavor!  For my low sodium diet I used Hain sodium free baking powder and used olive oil.  Wouldn't change a thing, texture and consistency was perfect and I blended until there were no more lumps.  Hubby couldn't believe they were from a recipe and not a box!  This will be a keeper!  Thanks!

Say Good-bye to the box!  Although these aren't as tasty as the pancakes at my nearby diner, they are still sooooooo much better than what I get from a box mix.  I love that they can be frozen for future grab-n-go pancakes if necessary.  For those days that we need to eat breakfast in the car, like on days we are running late for school, I throw a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips into the batter.  This way, no syrup is needed.  Needless to say, my son intentionally makes me late when he knows it is pancake day!  :)  Helpful tip:  Since we eat pancakes once a week, I like to pre-measure my dry ingredients.  At the beginning of the month I measure out the dry ingredients and put them into separate containers, one for each week, like making my own mix.  On pancake day I only have to add in the eggs, oil, milk, etc.  It saves me a lot of time.

Substitute 1 cup water for one of the 2 cups of milk. Use skim milk for the other cup. Cut the sugar to 1/4 cup - or cut it out entirely. Then substitute whole wheat flour for the white flour. Now it's healthier.

I tried this recipe twice.  First time used the blender, were so runny that I assumed I over mixed.  Second time mixed by hand and still runny.  I only mixed until the ingredients were combined.  Turned out so flat!  I'm normally a very good cook and baker.  I think there is too much milk in here.  IF I try again, I might only use a cup or so of milk.

While these pancakes are very sweet, whether they are too sweet is a matter of taste.  I enjoyed the strong vanilla flavor and the sweetness.  These pancakes went well with most of my favorite toppings, and are a definite keeper.

These were excellent!  The only thing I did different was use canola oil for the veg. oil since this is all I had on hand. Actually looking back at recipe now I forgot to add the vanilla, so I bet that would of made it even better.

Way too sweet for my taste. Maybe 1/2 the sugar would do?  It seemed like a lot of baking powder and then they seemed runny. I thought about adding more flour but decided to give it a try first. The fluff up a little as they cook. In the end they are a little on the thin side but I like the texture fine.

These are on the sweet side, BUT They are delicious without syrup! I'm not a fan of syrup and these are fabulous without any. They are slightly rubbery but Delicious. I could see how they could be too sweet if added syrup for some. My 8 yr old had no complaints though and he used syrup. They cook up really easy.

i halveded the recipe and added about half tsp of cinnamon.tastes really good with the cinnamon! though it was a little rubbery. maybe its cos i mixed the batter too much, i didn't know the lumps will disappear once you fry them. also, i put cold milk in, which kind of curdled everything,making it hard for me to mix the batter properly. so remember to use milk at ROOM TEMPERATURE! :-) oh and remember to have it with condiments like syrup, jam, butter or something because it was kind of cloying if you just eat it as it is. overall it's a good recipe, you can do a little alterations here and there to your liking. do add cinnamon!

The flavor was good but there is no way to mix these properly in a blender. Pancakes ideally should be mixed just until blended together and the blender over mixes them so they turn out tough. Pancakes should be fluffy and rise up about 1/2 inch when they hit the pan. These are very flat and dense.

Wonderful pancakes, I used 2/3 of suggested sugar and added a cup of flour because I love my pancakes thick :) So there's plenty of room for your personal modifications to these wonderful and easy pancakes! Greatly recommended!

Super Easy, and very sweet.  My kids loved them.  One problem they stick to my pan, I need to re-grease before putting down more batter every time.

This is Ok. Most of what the other reviewers are saying is right. They are dense, bland, not worth the time you save. My pancake-loving son wouldn't finish one and neither did my daughter. I gave it 4 stars because it's edible and once you put butter/syrup on them, it masks the flavor.

Did not like these too much. They were SO sweet, even after I cut the sugar back to 1/2c. They weren't very fluffy either, came out kind of flat and soggy.

This recipe was OK. I would recommend it to someone who is on a diet; otherwise I thought it was  very bland. Very easily made though!

This is an awesome recipe. I'm not that good of a cook but these came out perfect, easy and fast! I added a little bit of bananas, because I love them with panacakes, and MmMmmM... SO GOOOD!!!

This recipe was fair. I liked the idea
of using my blender, but the pancakes
weren't really what I was looking for.
It was still too sweet when I reduced
the sugar to 1/3 of a cup.

I found this to be a rather dense pancake. I followed the recipe exactly, didn't overmix, but I was still left with a flat, thick, bland pancake. I really doubt i'll make this again.

The resulting pancakes tasted ok, but they were entirely too sweet even though i only used about 2/3 the recommended amount of sugar.  I will not use this recipe again.

These are fast and delicious.  I was looking for something to whip up real quick.  I used only 1/2 cup sugar and they were plenty sweet.  Also, I added some a cinnamon plus blend I have, which has mutmeg and clove in it.  I got lots of compliments!

These pancakes are tough and have a funny taste and texture.  They don't resemble normal pancakes.   I didn't enjoy the vanilla along with my Vermont maple syrup, the syrup flavor should dominate but didn't.  The blender is fast but not a way to  make pancakes.  If you enjoy the vanilla flavor I suggest you mix the batter lightly by hand.  If you don't want vanilla pancakes I suggest you use another recipe.
Cooking light has a good recipe for pancakes.  Ignore the "mix until smooth" though and just mix until combined.

Good recipe, but way too sweet.  They tasted more like cookies than pancakes, and this is coming from somebody with a serious sweet tooth.  If you decrease the sugar, it's a good recipe.

These are amazing! First time I made them and they turned out really good :> I made a few alterations and don't understand when others say the batter's too thin. Mine came out just at the right consistency. I cut the recipe in half and whisked the egg white up to a stiff peak, which I folded into the batter last. It instantly thickened up the batter. They make really good and fluffy pancakes, although they could still be more tender though.

A nice idea, but I think the batter turned out too runny, and the recipe had too much sugar for my taste.

The pancakes were rather thin and tough probably due to the batter being mixed in the blender.

Just made these for breakfast. They are so sweet that they don't need syrup. Added a little butter and grape jelly on top,  rolled them up and ate them in our hands. They were delicious. Bet our little granddaughters will like them.

These had little flavor and texture was gummy and rubbery.  Thin batter held together OK for flipping, but were lackluster.  And I would say it only made 4 servings: 2 adults, 2 little kids.  Keep look for another reeipe; this one is disappointing.

I wanted to make some pancakes and had no batter mix. With a group of 7 hungry people to feed breakfast... I read the ingredients and reviews and decided to try it out following some suggestions in another review of using 1/2 cup of sugar and I blended it using a hand mixer. A decent amount of pancakes came out and they were sooo good! I will repeat this recipe and is on my favorites list. Thank you!

Super Easy, Fast and Delicious!  Blend the ingredients, pour on oiled or buttered griddle - that’s it.  Clean up is a breeze. We like our pancakes on the sweet side so the sugar amount was perfect for us.  I also like to sprinkle on my favorite granola right before I flip them.

My kids (2 and 4) loved this recipe. I didn't have any vanilla, so I subbed almond extract. I also used an applesauce/baking powder mixture instead of eggs. I love this recipe because it doesn't taste like flour like a lot of other recipes I've tried and the pancakes turn out fluffy and light.

This is now our family favorite for pancakes. It was a little watery for me but I just added more flour. Also, I whisked it by hand. Very easy to make and tastes super good.

Excellent fast recipe if you are short on time.  I also changed the sugar to 1/2 cup, it was crazy sweet still (but we like that).  I  think this would have benefitted from about a 1/4 teaspoon of salt, it was missing some kind of dimension and I think that was it.  I used a hand mixer to combine instead of a blender and finished mixing with a spatula.  I whipped my eggs first before adding them to the rest of the wet ingredients and I had no problems with flat or dense pancakes.

As a beginner chef, I highly recommend these pancakes.  I followed the recipe as written except I had to turn my heat down to mid-low as medium or mid-high was burning them.

This recipe also gives a very large amount of batter.  Perhaps my pancakes are just very small?  I saved the leftover batter for use during the rest of the weekend.

Finally, these pancakes turned out very sweet.  I have a rather large sweet tooth and didn't need to add anything to them.  Just ate them plain!  My 4 year old polished them off with some applesauce.

Love this recipe I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to give it more of a vanilla flavor. It is a genius recipe using the blender and it tastes delicious.

I used half the amount of sugar that the recipe called for, I sounded like a lot of sugar for just one recipe.   i also used 3/4 cup of hole milk and the rest I used almond milk.

I had to turn the heat to med low.  The kiddos like the light brown appearance on the cakes.  But sure loved the blender idea!  I don't know why it wasn't fluffy...it was flat.

I made it with sweetened vanilla almond milk due to our lactose sensitivities. I still added the vanilla. They were wonderful! They made plenty for the 3 of us, with more left over for tomorrow. I also didn't make it in my blender (blender issues). They can be made by hand; however, I would recommend mixing them differently if you're going to do it that way.

FYI These will spread out on the cooking surface. They aren't thick. They are good though!

Tasty pancake recipe! I want to continue experimenting with the mixing and dry ingredients, which is why I gave it 4 stars. Per other reviewers, I reduced the sugar and whisked instead of blended. It still ended a bit thin, which is why I want to keep experimenting with it. But it is really tasty and a great foundation!

Great texture and cooked up great, but way too sweet. Some people say change the sugar to 1/2 but I only use 1/4 cup because I don't like sweet pancakes.

I cut way back on the sugar, because that seemed like too much to me.  As a result, I had to add more flour because the batter was too runny.  The batter still was pretty thin, but the pancakes puffed up very nicely and were good.  Everyone's taste is different, and I think I would enjoy these even more with no sugar.  I might try subbing some whole wheat flour too. It's a good base recipe that you can modify to your family's tastes.

Perfect!  I used my immersion blender with the whisk attachment.  Halved the recipe, doubled the vanilla, omitted the oil and made them in a well buttered skillet.  YUM!  :D  Done in less than 10 minutes from start to finish (including washing my dishes by hand!).

I really liked these. I put them in my mixer instead of blender, and added blueberries. They are pretty sweet, and with the berries almost didn't need syrup. They rose nicely, not the thickest pancakes but definitely on par with some restaurants I have been to and SO much better than box mix.

My husband and I loved this recipe. We converted the recipe for 3. I used less sugar and a hint more vanilla...fabulous for us. My husband likes his pancakes thin and crispy...which this recipe allowed me to do easily. I made mine a bit thicker and they came out just right. We will be making this recipe from now on. Thank you :)

Great easy recipe!  I hadn't made pancakes before at all, and this was a great first experience! Very tasty and the texture was perfect. I whisked everything together by hand instead of using a blender, and I halved the recipe since it's just for me, but everything turned out great!

Quick and easy, but mine turned out flat and WAY too chewy. They were edible, but I will try a different recipe in the future. May never make pancakes without a blender again, though. So easy and minimized cleanup since I could pour right from blender onto skillet.

These were so thin. I had a feeling they'd be that way when I saw the 2-2 ratio of milk to flour. Additionally they did not rise so they just spread out into thin blobs. They also tasted nothing like a pancake and were more like a Pizzelle (those little waffle cookies at christmas) which I haven't had in a long time, so we're going to cook the rest anyway- hate to waste the ingredients! Definitely more like a cookie and less like a pancake!

OK Here are some more hints. 1. make sure your baking powder is fresh and double acting. 2. make sure you don't over mix.. if you do it will make gluten and that is what will make it tough and chewy. it's better to mix in a bowl with a whisk than in the blender. 3. add a pinch of salt, it make everything else taste better. 4. mix all dry together, then mix in the wet, then the baking powder wont react until you want it to. 5. have whatever your cooking on hot and ready before you mix the wet, that way you can cook before all the baking powder is used up. 6. add fun mix-ins like fruit, nuts, or chocolate. lastly have fun and don't be so critical. mistakes are how you learn. if you don't like how it turned out this time, tweak it and try again. that's what makes cooking so great! thanks for the recipe. I used apple sauce instead of the oil, and added almond extract for that extra kick. thanks again

I chose this recipe because of all of the positive reviews but I am one of the 10-20% of people who the recipe didn't work for. It didn't seem thin like a lot of people had said, the pancakes were medium on a scale of low to high, in regards to thickness. They were dense and tasted horrible. I added cinnamon to hide the taste but the denseness was overpowering. At first I did try to reduce the sugar amount to half, as many positive reviews said they were way to sweet. After not liking the first batch, I added more sugar and still were not good. I will not attempt to alter this recipe to try to make it work for me. On to the next recipe! :)

Best pancakes I have ever made! This one is a keeper! One thing i changed was only using 1/2 cup of sugar and only using 1 1/2 cups of milk and 1/2 cup melted butter. After those moderation's, these pancakes were perfect!

These pancakes were fast and easy if you were looking to make rubbery frizzbies for the kids to play with for Christmas. Not fluffy at all. Made the changes others had made and it was just not a good pancake. Will stick with buttermilk pancakes from now on.

I loved this recipe who knew homemade pancakes could be so easy to make, and fast. Saves from buying the pre made panckaes mix. Just buy a huge bag of flour n pretty much be set on pancakes for a very long time. I didn't even make these the correct way. I didn't have vanilla extract, I thought I did but couldn't find it. but I made them anyway n I was cooking one and eating some @ the same time. easy to make, and yummy.

These were a little flat for my taste, so I bumped it up to 2 1/2 TBS of baking powder and about 1/4 TSP of lemon juice to add some fluff. Much better :]

Fantastic recipe!  We made it as is, and it made lovely light and fluffy pancakes.  I quickly blended the wet ingredients first, and then added the dry ingredients, blending only for a few seconds.  The batter didn't have any lumps, but it was still fluffy.  If you blend too long, the baking powder won't work and the pancakes will be rubbery.

We will make this again.  Next time I will add less sugar, though these were fine as is, just like a restaurant's pancakes.

More often, I prefer pancakes on the "flatter" side than super fluffy ones.  Admittedly, I like McDonald's pancakes - and this recipe resembles that, but better.  The only change I make in this recipe is the sugar.  I find that even with half the sugar, the pancakes are too sweet for any syrup or toppings.  So if you want to eat the pancakes as is, then maybe cut the sugar in half.  I have to have syrup with my pancakes, so I use anywhere from 1/4 to 1/3 of the cup (depending on what syrup I have at home).  This is such a basic recipe that you definitely customize.  I have used sesame oil before to add a "nutty" flavour - and hints of spices.

This was my first attempt at pancakes from scratch.  These were so quick and easy to make, my 6 yr old helped me. We added banana extract instead of vanilla and some chocolate chips for a treat and they were yummy!  I halved the recipe and made it exactly as is, other than not using a blender and just hand mixing it.  I felt it looked too runny, but made my first batch with it as is.  They tasted ok, but were completely flat and didn't look very nice (reason for 4 stars).  I love crepes, but this is not what i was going for!  I added a bit more flour until the batter was to a desired consistancy and continued with the batches and they came out nice and fluffy.    I can see how others felt they were rubbery and sweet, but I much prefered this texture to the usual dry, need to be drowned in syrup pancakes you get out of mixes. We were able to eat them without any syrup which I'm sure would have added much more sugar than what the recipe called for.  This is a keeper and I won't be buying store bought mixes/batters anymore!!!  Thanks :)

super simple and just delicious!  The only thing I changed was that I used a butter & vanilla flavoring. We made two batches to freeze they were so good!

These are good- but be prepared, even reducing the sugar, they are a lot sweeter than normal pancakes.  a little on the bland side, but good for a quick recipe.

These pancakes are WONDERFUL! thin, and sweet. The recipe is perfect as is, and the blender idea makes it easy to save some batter for later. These pancakes freeze well, and are ready to eat after 30 seconds in the microwave, great for lazy mornings. But, these pancakes are definitely sweet. All they require as far as dressing is a little smear of butter. Its fine with me, most pancake syrups are loaded with high fructose corn syrup anyway, so I love being able to omit them alltogher.

I am not sure how so many people had so much success with this recipe.  I find that the blender over mixes the batter and the result is a tough, chewy, pancake.

If you're thinking these will turn out like Bisquick pancakes, find another recipe! The batter came out a little more runny than I expected. I let it sit for about 5 minutes & it thickened up a tad, not much. The pancakes were as another reviewer stated, crepe-like. I did 1/2 the sugar, extra vanilla, & they did taste good. My kids wolfed them down & said they liked them, so I guess I'll try again & see if I get a better batter next time!

In New England, home of maple syrup, all restaurants serve thick, thick, dry pancakes. I won't guess the motivation or historical reason (sop up more maple syrup?) but I find eating these pancakes like ripping open your sofa's cushions and eating the stuffing. Even maple syrup won't help that. This recipe, which I halved, makes pancakes that are more crepe-like. I like that they're a tad chewy and not thick and dry.  I did not use the blender method. All other pancake recipes call for minimal mixing, even leaving some lumps in the batter. I hand whisked the mix. I suspect blenderizing would quickly lead to a homogenous batter.

I thought the batter was too thin. So i had to add a cup of flour and add more baking soda so they rise a little more. The pancakes had a wonderful flavor too them! My daughter who is and can be picky sometimes loved them!

I would consider these to be a perfect "no syrup" pancake, so in terms of quick and easy (kids running out the door..) they're perfect for a hand-held breakfast. The sugar the recipe calls for is probably less than what you would find in syrup. I added an extra cup of flour to thicken them abit.

I ran out of Bisquick this morning and went to Allrecipes and searched "easy pancakes" and this recipe came up.  It was easy and "the best " according to my teenage boys.  I mixed it by had in a bowl because a blender is too noisy at our house in the morning!   I have saved it to "My Recipe Box".  No more Bisquick pancakes in our house!

These really are super easy, but to reduce clean up, i'd definitely just whisk the ingredients in a mixing bowl instead of dirtying my blender.   As for taste, they really are quite sweet. i'd reduce sugar to 1/3 cup i think. you already top pancakes with syrup or other sugary toppings like jam, so there really is no need for the pancakes to be as sweet as they are.  these pancakes weren't fluffy like traditional pancakes, which i like, but if you want fluffy pancakes, these aren't the pancakes for you.

My husband loves "crepes" and I recently used a mix that was fine, but there was not enough mix leftover for the next time he wanted them.  I found this recipe and they were very good and easy to make.  I filled them with a mixture of cream cheese, powdered sugar, raspberry freezer jam and dash of vanilla.  I rolled them and drizzled more jam and topped each one with the cream cheese mixture.  My husband really enjoyed them.  He will want them a lot...not sure I want to make them every weekend, my kitchen is a mess now!  This is the only downfall, but the recipe is a keeper.  Thanks!!

Like the idea of the blender. Was quick and easy. I ended up using 1/4c sugar and added cinnamon and 2 bananas for fun. Although they were dense the family did enjoy them.

For a simple pancake these are really good.  I did cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup and they were still pretty sweet...not bad, but since they get topped with sweet stuff I think I will cut back to only 1/4 cup next time.  They aren't super fluffy, but that made it easier to spread stuff on them...my daughter loved them in place of bread for a PB&J. :)

These came out pretty well.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and whisked the batter by hand.  I also reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup and found it to be plenty.  I made this in two batches and made half with chocolate chips, half with blueberries.  Will probably make again.

After reading the reviews on this recipe, I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup. My 11 year-old, who eats his pancakes plain, proclaimed these too sweet. No one else noticed because their pancakes were covered in syrup.

This recipe was very good, as good as boxed pancakes, but they were too runny to turn when they should have been. Therefore they browned more than I prefer, so next time I will make them with less milk.

Nice and quick. Need to be careful to use a fairly small amount of batter per pancake or it stays too thick/chewy when cooked.

I followed this recipe except I whisked instead of blended becuase I read the other reviews of getting flat, rubbery pancakes. I very lightly whisked and I too got flat, rubbery pancakes-definitely didn't overmix. I really, really wanted to like this recipe but I just didn't. The taste wasn't good and the texture was awful.

I absolutely LOVE this recipie! I do cut the sugar a little, but it is absolutely delicious, and wonderfully easy! My 2 year old son devours these, and I am happy knowing what is in them. I dont mind cooking breakfast with a recipe as easy as this.

I love this recipe! It makes fluffy lump free pancakes in less than half the time it would by hand. I enjoy adding mashed up banana in the mixing process or pieces of apple or blueberries after.

Not bad---I would cut back on the milk so they wouldn't be sooo thin. I did cut back on the sugar to 1/2c --thank goodness I did--they would have been too sweet with 3/4c----

If I could give this recipe less than 1 star I would. They have an extremely strange texture, very gummy, perhaps caused by too much flour. They stick to the pan and the batter was thinner than regular pancake batter.  I knew you needed buttermilk to make pancakes....I recommend finding another recipe!

Very versatile recipe.  Tastes great, like regular pancakes if you leave out the vanilla, but the vanilla is nice for a change.  I've also made them and added fruit, which is exceptionally good.  They are sweet enough that way that syrup isn't necessary.

Your first pancake as a rule never comes out good. The rest of the batch were perfect and I really enjoyed the ones that I sprinkled with sultanas just as I put the mixture in the pan. Thanks for this recipe.

No bad. But a little thin and definitely sweet (other pancake recipes only use 1 tbsp of sugar NOT 3/4 cups). Also, I'm not sure that it is any easier using a blender than mixing by hand. Now I have a blender to washinstead of a bowl.

I liked this recipe, although it was very sweet - which is ok because I'm not a big syrup fan, so I eat them plain! I was a little worried about the amount of vanilla in the recipe, but it turned out fine. I used only egg whites (4) and beat them until fluffy before adding to the milk (I used soymilk, because we can't eat dairy in our house) and they were perfect , not runny or too thick. Nice one!

They were awful!  They were so floppy and way too sweet.  I agree with others that they taste more like a soft cookie.  When you put syrup on them, wow!

I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white flour and they had a nice hearty taste.  This recipe is very fun to make with the kids.

These pancakes were easy to make and I had most of the ingredients on hand, which is a plus. I added 1 tsp cinnamon to the recipe and that gave them a great flavor. My husband said these were the best pancakes I had ever made. Definitely a keeper.

When I tried this recipe for pancakes, the pancakes turned out kind of chewy--not light and fluffy like I'd hoped.  They were almost like not-very-sweet sugar cookies.

Tasted good...but didn't cook right. They either cooked too much too fast or too little too slow.

These were pretty good, but even after cutting the sugar to 1/2 cup, they were still too sweet. I'm not used to sweet pancakes,though. Next time, I will also add salt. I thought the thickness of the batter was fine, and puffed up fine during cooking.  It was definitely easy! Thanks!

Very nice taste! I think it has the perfect amount of vanilla. So SUPER easy to make - took less than 3 minutes to mix up the batter. Only drawback - it's missing fluffiness! It helps to double the baking poweder, though.

I liked this recipe.  I still think there was too much baking powder so I decreased it and add 1/2 teaspoon of salt.

If you're looking for a quick way to make pancakes on a busy morning--this is it.  But beware--flavor needs a little tweaking.  As others have noted, it's a little sweet.  So, I decreased sugar by 1/4 c.  In addition, I'm used to pancakes which have a dash or two of salt to set off the flavor of the maple syrup.  They were just a little too bland for us.  We've tried this recipe with blueberries (adding about 1/2 c of frozen ones to the blender and blending for 10 seconds to incorporate (but not pulverize) the berries).

This recipe is very easy. It's the first time I have mixed pancakes in a blender, but it was combined in no time flat.  This recipe is very sweet to the taste buds, prob. because of the vanilla. Very good. I made a batch to accomidate 6 servings and froze them to save for every morning until they are gone. I'm sure it won't take long! Yum.

Way too sweet and kind-of gross add a tablespoon of lemon juice, 1 tsp baking powder and a little more flour and its ok.

Too sweet, even with the sugar amount cut down. Also, the texture is very dense and rubbery. I'm looking for a little more fluff.

I found that the high sugar content in this recipe makes them tend to burn quickly.  I recommend using lower heat than you would for regular pancakes or reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup.

This was the first time that I had ever made pancakes. This recipe was very easy! I added a capful of Butterscotch flavouring which dazzled up the flavour. These were excellent! Not too sweet, but not too bitter... just right, if you like not so sweet pancakes! I'll def be using this recipe again! Very easy ... very lovley!:)thanks!

Pretty good and very easy.  I used powdered buttermilk and water as the "milk" replacement to make them more tasty.  I don't think I'll ever buy premade pancakes again when the real thing is just too easy to make.

This works great when you have three tots. They are easy to make and light on the stomach. To top it all off they taste great.

My family thought these were great!  Not at all complicated, could make them on a school morning.  I whisked the ingredients instead of using the blender, one less thing to wash.  They were light and delicious!  Recipe halves easily, makes 8 pancakes that way.  I used an electric Farberware Griddle and they were perfect and evenly cooked.
Thanks for sharing this one!
