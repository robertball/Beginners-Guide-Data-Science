This was very easy to fix. I think I will leave the broccoli out next time. Plus I added some home grown red peppers, they really added to the flavor. I finished it off with a cold beer!

This was alright.  I found it to be too greasy.  I might try to drain the bacon grease next time before adding the pasta.

I have made this twice now.  We love it.
I used peppered bacon, a LOT of garlic, fresh grated parmesan and cajun spice seasoning instead of the cayenne pepper.
Delish! There is never leftovers!!  LOL

Used 8 ounces of peppered bacon, left out the broccoli & cayenne, & used pecorino instead of parmesan. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is the broccoli. There's just something so simple & clean (ours wasn't greasy at all & the peppered bacon gave it just the right amount of seasoning) about the flavor combination, I feel the broccoli just takes over. We served it with garlic sauteed spinach & a simple chicken cutlet for a really nice, comforting meal!

This went over really well with the family.  I used chili powder instead of cayenne, and had to use dried parsley because I didn't have fresh on hand.  I also had to use half mozzarella and half mild cheddar, but no one seemed to notice or care!  It was still very good and I will make it again (maybe following the directions next time).

My boyfriend is a very picky eater, but he loves this.  I think sometimes it's a little greasy, but it does warm up well for leftovers.  I also recommend using asparagus instead of broccoli for a nice change of pace!

We doubled the amount of bacon (mmm!) and made sure to drain the grease before adding the broccoli and garlic. The pasta took longer to cook than anticipated so we would make sure to start that well in advance next time. Used a mixture of pecori romano and grated parmesan cheese along with the mozzarella. Very stringy and hard to stir, but who cares! The cayenne added a wonderful zing. Will definitely make again!

Absolutely delicious!!  My boyfriend and I had two big plates and then stood over the pan and finished the rest WITH OUR FINGERS!!  It was that good.  I did use 4 cloves of garlic (and next time I'll use even more, 5-6), next time I'll also add a bit more cayenne pepper.  I left out the parsley, just didn't have it.  A bit greasy, I might sub turkey bacon and cut the cheese in half to save calories.  Very tasty, definately will be making this again!

Delicious!  I didn't have broccoli so I used peppers.  Make enough for seconds!

Also, next time I'll make less pasta per topping.  Or more topping per unit of pasta.

I made this exactly like it says except I added one ingredient... Asparagus! I chopped up one small bunch into 1" pieces and added them when I added the broccoli. This dish was so delicious! My husband said I made a "home run" with this dish and to put it on the favorites of all time list. :)

I had bacon and mozzarella in the fridge, so I put them in the search and this seemed like a good recipe.  As written it would be very greasy and bland.  I drained some of the bacon grease and used 3 garlic cloves when it really could have used more.  Also added salt and pepper, and garlic salt/powder.  I had some leftover chicken in the fridge that I minced up and added.  Next time I'll just make carbonara and call it good.

I love mozzarella cheese now. This recipe has a great combination of flavours and I'll definately make it again! More cheese would be a good suggestion, as it gets dry near the end. Otherwise delicious!

Bland would definitely be the correct word to describe this dish.  I gave it two stars because we ate it, but it was not a favorite.  I will never make it again.

Made this today. At first I drained the grease but once I cooked the broccoli I added a little back in. I liked the flavors of the dish but I was expecting the cheese to be more like a sauce instead of melted cheese.

This recipe was okay. I found it to be very greasy and the cheese did not really mix well. I will try it again but cook the bacon first, then steam the broccoli. I think I will use velveeta cheese next time so the sauce is creamier. I would recommend it but would be better if all the ingredients were cooked separately and then added at the end.

Flavor was okay, but it definitely needs some kind of sauce.  I added alfredo to try to rescue it.  This is not a keeper.

This is yummy comfort food.  I am always looking for skillet dinner/burger helper kind of receipes without all the powdered stuff that gives commercial boxes it's flavor.  I loved this.

This was a messy ball of cheese and pasta until I added some cream and water. Then it finally melted down to a nice sauce.

This was good, my family really enjoyed it.  It was a little dry, will add some wine or chicken broth next time.  I did substitute the cayenne pepper with crushed red pepper.  Will def make it again.

Made this as is except used turkey bacon, and it was a little dry- had to add 1/4 C of H20 and a cube of chicken boullion most likely because the fat was greatly reduced.  The taste was strange not bad just very different.  We ate this but I won't make it again.

This is a favorite for my husband.  You can substitute 2 cups cubed chicken for the bacon with great results as well!

I agree with the previous comment about waiting for a sauce to form.  This seemed like it needed some cream or some tomato sauce (or something).  The texture was just kind of gloppy from the melted mozarella.  Not a big hit at our house....

A good "starter" recipe.  Needs some tweaking though.  Add more garlic & seasonings and maybe heavy cream to make it a sauce instead of just melted stringy cheese.  It was good, but lacked flavor and sauce.

Will not make again.  Made it exactly as directed. First of all, there is no way the broccoli will cook in that amount of time.  It dish was just one big goo of cheese and really didn't have that much flavor.  The kids all ate it but all said they really didn't want to have it again.  Same with husband.

The flavor was good, but mozzarella does not melt and stick to pasta well, so we ended up with pasta, broccoli and lumps of cheese.  I wouldn't recommend mozzarella for this recipe.  I also would recommend using this cooking method, parboiling the broccoli so it cooks in the time noted, as frying it for 4 minutes does not soften it enough for the recipe.  We did like the overall flavor, but I would make changes next time.

I make this at least twice a month. Replacing the bacon with chicken strips is amazing.

I love cheese, and I love bacon, but there was too much of it in this dish, much to my surprise.

Easy good but too drying.  I drained the grease.

I liked the taste of this recipe, but just not my cup of tea. I read the reviews and used extra garlic(about 2tbs of minced). Although, I still couldn't taste it. I prefer cajun over cayenne, so I used cajun instead. I thought 1/8 tsp. was not enough; so I free poured. I decided to add all the ingredents except for the mozz. ch. I added that at the end as a layer on top of everything and put a lid on it with heat on medium to melt the cheese. Didn't exactly turn out the way I hoped, but still edible. Won't make again, but might use the concept in another recipe.

Very tasty and not too tricky to make. Had some minor problems coordinating parts of the recipe to be ready at the same time, but i often find that the first time of making anything.  It will be easier next time, and i will make less too, as we ate far too much!  Not the fault of the recipe, i just cooked too much pasta and bacon.  I think it would have reheated well if it had been around long enough!

Made this for 5 men, (big eaters) doubled the recipe and sauteed in small amount of bacon grease a diced jalapeno and onion added cooked bacon back in adding the cayenne pepper and broccoli, noodles and cheese gave a great spice which we love; thought this would be a good side. Everything else was the side but this dish.

Would leave the bacon out and use less garlic since it gives me heartburn, otherwise an "I'll make it again" recipe. I would imagine Turmeric would be a good spice choice if you don't have cayenne and want it a bit less spicy. Lots of room for altering this easy recipe to your own liking.
