I did something a little different.  I cooked Italian sausage (not in the casing) in a skillet and added minced garlic, chopped onions and bell peppers.  I also added some Tony Chachere's More Spice seasoning.  This was a huge hit and went fast.  Awesome recipe; I'll definitely be making it for the Superbowl!!

This was easy to make and my guest really enjoyed snacking on it during the game. I think I might try using sun dried tomatoes next time as an alternative to fresh since they will likely pack in more power. I think adding some chopped up pepperoni might be good too.

This was very good! Perfect for when you're tired of the same old, same old dips! I made it as written but I didn't use the black olives. I just doubled the green olives instead. I also added more mozz on top because 1 tablespoon just wasn't enough for me. I served these with Ritz garlic butter crackers...yum!

This was so yummy, I loved the concept of using meatballs in a dip recipe. However, a word of advice, because it's something that I didn't want with mine, a mound of grease residue. Make sure if you are using pre-made meatballs, that you could them or boil them in water to help remove the fat before mixing them in this recipe. At least it should reduce the mount in your dish. I too added extra mozz on the top of mine, but however stayed to the recipe otherwise. The family totally enjoyed the different style of dip recipe that this was. I think I might add chunks of pepperoni to the next batch. TY it will be a repeat offender in my house.

I took it to a party and it was a huge hit. Completely gone.  Now everyone wants the recipe.  I did change it a little.  I didn't have meatballs on hand or hamburger so I used pepperoni diced up. Definately a keeper.

My son and I put this receipt to the test on the yesterday's NFL playoffs. Many thanks to John Brescio for sharing such a great appetizer and to Ritz for the video (great Video). My son went to the store and bought some things. He used frozen meatballs (Walmart Great Value fully cooked Italian Style frozen meatballs) as a replacement. I had some Townhouse cracker box almost full, so we used it as a replacement. Otherwise, we followed the recipe (added more Mozzarella, during mix and on top). The outcome was fantastic! I think the Ritz Crackers would have been better, since the Townhouse brand broke easily when dipping; tasted ok, but not as thick and strong as Ritz). All 5 of us that tried  the recipe rated it a 5. Also, we microwave defrosted the frozen meatballs while cutting up the tomatoes and olives. We had a lot of meatballs left over so my son thought up another appetizer he and his buddies make; to put the left over meat balls into a slow cooker with Sweet Barbeque sauce and cook them for about 4 hours on high. They were delicious and he also added some frozen Cream Cheese Wontons and frozen Cream Cheese filled Jalepano Poppers with Rancho dressing dip and a Wonton dip. Thank you John again!

I made this recipe for Super Bowl and it was delicious!  Everyone loved it and it was almost gone in 30 minutes!  Served with Ritz crackers and Ritz toasted chips.  I liked the toasted chips best because they were a little firmer to be able to stand up to the chunkiness of the dip.  Will definitely be making this recipe again.

Fantastic!  I must admit that I substituted turkey pepperoni for the meatballs.  And only used green olives (chopped very fine) because I didn't have both on hand.  My family HATES olives, but they loved this dip and they thought the green olives were pickled jalapenos.  They were irritated when I told them, but not enough to stop eating this dip!

I enjoyed the recipe enough to make it again, but personally, I could go without the meatballs in it.  I did add fresh minced garlic to the mix as well as used fresh oregano over dried.  I really loved the dip before the meatballs.  Would definitely make it again.

Stay near it when you bring it out because it will disappear fast. Perfect for Super Bowl parties.   I added turkey pepperoni instead of meatballs and it was great,  but I found a nice Italian chicken sausage (no casing) that would probably go really well also... I'm gonna try it next time.

This fast became a fan favorite!  I doubled the recipe and the only changes I made were to use Italian turkey sausage (casting removed) instead of meatballs and a 15oz can of fire-roasted tomatoes (undrained) instead of fresh romas.  I put the whole thing in a crockpot and served with ritz crackers for a work potluck.  Everyone was talking about how good it was and there were no leftovers to take home.

Disappointing! Gave it three stars because I did make some changes. I added ricotta cheese, Italian sausage. I also added Mariana sauce trying to make it better to no avail.

This was pretty good although I'm thinking cutup pepperoni would be better.

I used 10 oz. can of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead of the plum tomatoes and it turned out great! I served it to a gathering of friends and everyone who tried it liked it .

I had leftover meatballs and decided to give this a shot. It was really good but a little on the bland side. I would make it again  but add something to give it a little kick! Still, very good!

I made this using chopped petite canned tomatoes and omitted all olives.  My guests really liked this dip and asked for the recipe.  I cut thawed frozen meatballs into smaller chunks.

This was very easy and except for the meatballs, all ingredients are immediately available in my refrigerator. I shouldn't be so pleased, but people think I worked very hard to make this wonderful dip and I get complements for being so creative. I tell people I have Lombardi's Pizza to thank for sharing this great recipe.

I made this for a New York themed pitch in at work.  It was a huge hit and I ended up giving the recipe to at least 6 co-workers.  I already have plans to make this again for another party my wife and I are going to
