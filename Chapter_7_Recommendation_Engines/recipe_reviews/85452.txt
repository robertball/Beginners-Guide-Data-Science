I love these burgers.  Let me tell you how to keep them from falling apart, though.  First, you must rinse the black beans and dry them off before mashing them.  Second, you must strain the onion, garlic and pepper mixture through a fine strainer to remove any excess water.  Third, if you add 50% more bread crumbs, it will hold much better.  Also, I freeze mine and grill them frozen.  Doing this has keep my burgers intact and my mouth happy!  Also, I always follow the spice/hot sauce measurments pretty well, and I do not find it too spicy at all, and I find black pepper to be spicy!  Hope this helps with the loose burger issue.

Delicious and easy!  I substituted red bell pepper for green and used rolled oats instead of bread crumbs.  I reduced cumin to 1 tsp and used 2 eggs.  Following the advice of others, I blended everything in the food processor, beginning with onions, peppers, and garlic, then oats, then eggs and spices, beans last.  I chilled the mixture, then rolled (more like poured -- think thick muffin batter) onto waxed paper. I froze the burgers.  To grill, I oiled some foil that I folded over burger.  Perfect!  My 13 yr old vegetarian daughter liked it better than store bought (me too!)

One of the best dishes I made this month! You can substitute or add corn kernels to the burgers for more texture and flavor, but not necessary! Tastes very healthy since I baked them in the oven - no oil! This recipe made 4 good size patties. We ate them all up and I immediately made another batch to have for lunches.

I made a chipotle mayo dressing which was exactly the touch it needed! (Some mayo and a dash of ranch dressing in a blender with two or three canned chipotle peppers to taste. GO EASY, they are extremely spicy.)

If you love black beans, you'll love this recipe.  My recommendation however, is to use whole-wheat Ritz crackers, instead of breadcrumbs. They add much more flavor.  Also, with any recipe, I would fry one small pattie in some oil first to make sure that it will be to your taste in terms of seasoning before you cook the whole mixture.

Okay, these are awesome. I hate the price of the supermarket veggie burgers and these are even better! I made the recipe exactly as directed and it was perfect. I don't have a food processor so I used my Pampered Chef chopper to finely mince the veggies. Unlike other reviewers, I had no problem getting the mixture to stick together—this may have been because I squeezed the excess water from the onions and peppers before adding them (I used pureed garlic). They formed up beautifully and didn't stick at all to a sprayed pan in the oven. I'm thinking of making a double batch, baking it, and freezing them once these first four patties are gone. They would be SO handy to have on hand for those nights you don't want to cook. I ate mine on the "Tasty Buns" recipe also found on this site. This recipe makes a large patty, which is the perfect size for the largish buns.

As written, this recipe is NOT 5 stars (hence my 3 star rating). I made this exactly as written and ended up with a veggie burger that was too wet to hold together in a patty and had an odd spice flavour (too much cumin and not enough salt). 



That being said, this recipe is a good base to add to- and that's what most people hear are giving their 5 star rating to. With the addition of: grated zucchini and carrot, salt, pepper, more breadcrumbs, and fresh parsley (and the decrease of cumin), these burgers are very, very good.  This recipe is actually one that works well with just about any grain or legume added (wild rice, lentils, quinoa, green onions) so my recommendation is to think of the recipe as a base to build your own creation from.

Great recipe!  Two eggs is the way to go, no falling apart and not dry.  I used all ingredients but also used corn.  I advise that you make sure to add salt and pepper and the spices to the bean mixture before adding eggs so you can adjust as needed.

Mmmmm-so good we decided to freeze the rest of the batch for an easy, reheat meal during the week. I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 cup cooked brown rice with the breadcrumb step to give the burgers a little more fill and structure. This recipe had the meat eaters and vegetarians alike asking for seconds. One tip: put a little olive oil on your hands when shaping the patties to prevent sticking. (Also makes your cuticles nice and soft!)These are an instant classic with my frinds.

Fun to make! I have already made it twice in the past 3 weeks.

I use eggbeaters instead of real eggs, and 1-1.5 eggs (1/4-3/8 cups) seems to form the perfect consistency. I also added cilantro and mushrooms for a nice added kick. Superb!

The first time I made these seemed like a disaster.  The mix was runny and could not be formed into anything, it was almost like soup.  I froze it and baked it nontheless and it turned into surprisingly FANTASTIC burrito filling.  I am on try number 2 now (we are having burritos again tonight) and the mixture was perfect, so it must have been me!!  This time, I soaked and cooked my own fresh black beans . . . that may be what made all the difference.  Try this recipe, it´s delicious!!

This is DELICIOUS. I swear, it is wayyyy better than storebought! I don't have a grill, so I did things a bit differently than some of the other reviewers. I did let the beans dry a bit after rinsing them and tried to get most of the moisture out of the onion, red pepper, garlic and pinch of cilantro that I roughly pureed with my immersion blender. One can of beans wasn't enough, so after mixing everything together, I added half a can of organic refried black beans. I didn't have breadcrumbs so I added a half a cup of cooked short grain white rice and about 1/3 cup of flour. I greased some aluminum foil and baked them on each side for 10 mins as suggested. To crisp them up, I put them in a pan on the stove with a tad oil for a few minutes before serving. AWESOME served with a side of chipotle mayo.

These burgers are delicious!  As others have said, you need to squeeze the excess water out of the pepper and onion mixture before adding it to the beans.

Another tip: you can make these vegan by using ground flax seed instead of the egg.  Whisk 1 tbsp ground flax seed with 3 tbsp water.  Then mix in the spices like it says in the recipe.  You'll get sort of a spicy paste.  Mix this in with the beans and it will hold together perfectly! Honestly, when I made this recipe with egg some of the burgers cracked, but they came out perfect using flax seed.

I'm impressed!  These are tasty and at a fraction of the cost of store purchased veggie burgers.  I took the tips from another reviewer (Kelly) and rinsed the beans then dried them really well with paper towels.  I put the onion, garlic and green pepper through a mini food processor, then drained the excess liquid off and blotted with another paper towel. I mixed the mashed beans with the onion, garlic and green pepper.  I added two egg yolks, omitting the whites because that just adds more water.  I then added 1 cup of fresh bread crumbs with the remaining spices.  Mine made 5 huge patties and I grilled them on foil lightly brushed with Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  They came out perfect and I did not have any trouble with them falling apart.  
     The second time I made these I added some worcestershire sauce and a small amount of liquid smoke.  Wow, did that kick up the flavor.  Even my meat lover husband thought they tasted great.
At first I thought they would take a lot of time to make but I was surprised at how quick I made them.  I will make up a bunch of these and freeze them.  I have eaten just about every brand of store veggie burger that's out there.  These are far superior to any of the store burgers.
     Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

These were superb! I didn't have any onion so I used onion powder instead. To make up for the dryness of the powder I added a tablespoon of salsa. They turned out really well! Grilled them for 5 minutes on each side- really yummy! Will make again!

UPDATE: I have now made this again and have simplified the process. I just throw the beans, the roughly chopped pepper, onion and garlic into a bowl and blend with my stick blender until quite smooth. Then I just mix in the seasoning in the same bowl, add the egg and the breadcrumbs and stir. Then I let it stand for about 10 min so that the breadcrumb have time to actually soak up the excessive moisture. 

So easy and yummy! Will make now every week...

While these burgers don't quite have the same 'mouthfeel' as store-bought veggie burgers, these are so much better (not to mention cheaper) because YOU control the ingredients.  A few tricks to keep the patties together ~ as a few reviewers have mentioned, make sure the beans are dry; even though the directions call for mashing the beans until thick and pasty, I've had better success when the beans are roughly smashed; briefly saute the chopped veggies to rid of excess moisture before adding to the beans; using only the egg white will help bind the patties together without increasing the amount of bread crumbs ~ hope that helps.  And thanks, LAURENMU, for the delicious post!

I have never commented on a recipe but I really felt I needed to on this one.  I have made these burgers 2 times.  The first time they were great.. the second time they were AMAZING!! and the difference?? I put the beans, garlic, peppers, and onion in a blender and made a puree out of it, which of course made it more watery and I thought I had messed it up.. So I added bread crumbs until it was thick (about 1.5 more cups) added another egg (I did this both times) and then froze them, shaking my head at botching a good thing (although, now with all the breadcrumbs, I got 8 burgers out of one can).  About 1.5 hours later I took them out, apologizing to my other half who had begged for them that night, put a little olive oil in a stir fry pan and cooked them on the stove.  Oh my god - they were absolutely amazing!! the blender took away the weird bean-y texture that they had the first time. Absolutely amazing.  I can't wait to eat the rest of them - they are in the rotation

i just made these for the first time and they were wonderful. i was really surprised but they held together perfectly! i rinsed the black beans, drained them, then spread them out on the baking sheet to dry while i prepared the rest of the ingredients. i also squeezed the water out of the onions, garlic, and bell pepper as best as i could with a paper towel. instead of the breadcrumbs i used 1 1/2 cups of quick oats, which made the burgers very dense (they could easily be a substitute for a beef patty this way). this is definitely one of my new weekly recipes- i'm a vegetarian and these provide tons of protein, fiber, nutrients, and carbohydrates in a quick, cheap, easy meal. next time i make this recipe i will probably add 1/2 a cup of each carrots, mushrooms, and perhaps soybeans, reduce the oats to 1 cup, add 2 tablespoons of flaxseed, make 6 servings instead of 4, and reduce the chili powder to 2 teaspoons. i should also mention that i plugged this recipe into the calorie-count.com recipe analyzer and the numbers are extremely different than the values on this site, so for the health conscious i would double check. either way this is a delicious, wonderful recipe!!

My husband and I are vegan, so I doubled the recipe and substituted 1 Flax Egg and 1 Chia Egg for the traditional eggs.  To do this mix 1 Tbsp. Flax meal with 3 Tbsp water and set aside, and mix 1 Tbsp. Chia Seeds with 3 Tbsp water and side aside.  Then combine with other ingredients as written.  We found that this eliminated the excessive moisture that some had trouble with.

Great recipe!  Thank you!!!

I am a meat-eater who eats vegetarian during Lent. I used to be a terribly picky eater and even 5 years ago I never would have tried something like this. But I sure am glad that I did! After trying the recipe as is(very good),I did decide to make a few of my own modifications. I cooked my own black beans,drained and rinsed them when I was done. I cooked 1/4c.(dry)bulgur in 1/2c.water and 1/2t.vegetable base and used this in place of bread crumbs. I also used red pepper instead of green,1/2 of a jalapeno(no seeds),1/2c. mushrooms,1 ripe avocado(this adds a little healthy fat and gives the burger some moisture), and 2T tomato paste in addition to the ingredients listed. I chopped all of the vegetables to about a minced texture in my Zyliss, which gave it a ground beef-like texture. I drained these in a colander lined with paper towels(along with the fork-mashed black beans and bulgur)and gently pushed down on the ingredients to force out a little more excess moisture so they would hold together. I whisked together the egg,chili powder,and cumin and also added 1/8t.liquid smoke,1/4t.oregano,and 1/2t.vegetable base to this. I then poured the egg mixture over it all and used my hands to thoroughly combine all of the ingredients;as I mentioned earlier,it resembled the texture of ground beef. The patties formed very nicely,but I do recommend freezing them or they may fall apart when cooking. Cook in a non-stick skillet,but use a little butter or olive oil. 4* as is,5* this way.

This is a fantastic, basic veggie burger! I have followed the recipe with great results, but also love the versatility! I tend to double the recipe, use red peppers instead of green, use Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, and add a can of corn. It's also good with other veggies mixed in! The amount of breadcrumbs you use will depend on how watery your ingredients are - be sure to have more on hand, if necessary! You can substitute the egg for ground flax-seed mixed with water to make these vegan! Enjoy!

I am a chef at a sorority. I make these for my girls all the time, they live them. I add different ingredients each time with different spices to keep it fresh. Why would you strain the veggies, losing all those great flavors, add some dried french onions instead of bread crumbs!!! Mix up a Chipotle ranch mayo for these with some cheddar cheese. Make a Greek veggie burger with spinach and feta cheese and Greek seasonings, ad a cucumber sauce for extra flavor.  Make the patties up and freeze for a short bit, that will ensure a perfect patty!

With a few minor tweaks, this recipe is so good!! I have made this 3 times so far, each time with a few changes. I definitely agree the cumin is too much. I reduced it to 1 tsp and it seems perfect. Second, I make the whole thing in the food processor, because I'm just that lazy. I like the red bell pepper better than green in this recipe, or a mixture of both will probably be in my next batch. So I start by processing the pepper and onion in the food processor until finely chopped. I saute them with a small amount of olive oil in a non-stick pan for 2 minutes over medium heat. Meanwhile I process the garlic until it is nicely minced. Add that to the pan and saute one minute more, or until fragrant then remove from heat.

I add the beans to the processor with the veggies, egg and spices, and process until blended. Then add the bread crumbs (3/4 cup as per others) and give it a few pulses. Then comes the most important part: put in a covered bowl and refrigerate at least 20 minutes. No more falling apart.

I sauteed mine in a bit of olive oil for about 5 minutes each side in a non-stick pan. Topped with avocados, as others suggested. Basked in the raves. Thanks for the recipe!

Made these yesterday, was pleasantly surprised at how great they were!  I didn't have a perpper, so I subbed half a grated carrot.  Also, I used an extra egg and refrigerated the mixture for about an hour.  No problems with it falling apart.  Very happy with my first home-made garden burger attempt.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I'm a vegetarian and decided to give this recipe a try.  I made it pretty much the way that it says except that I added soy sauce and worchester sauce instead of chili powder and hot sauce.  That way I can spice it to taste later, especially since my 7yo daughter doesn't like spicy foods.  They came out delicious.  They are much better then what you buy in the store. I also strained the green peppers as some of the other reviews suggested. I fried it in a pan with a little margarine and it was wonderful.   I will definitely make another batch to freeze. I was also thinking that these would make a great meatball substitute for spaghetti.  You could form it into little balls and fry them up.  I also thought that they would be great for faux falafel by flattening it out, frying it in a pan and then putting it in a pita pocket with some ranch dressing. The possibilities are endless and yummy!

These are really great!  Dense and satisfying while also being healthy, I found these very easy to throw together. This recipe is also quite simple to modify  (ex: I tossed in a jalapeno and used a chili garlic sauce rather than hot sauce).  I used an oven to bake these and they turned out just fabulous--no problems with them falling apart, perhaps because I took the good advice of other members and added extra bread crumbs.  I'll be making these often!

AWESOME veggie burgers!  I am definitely going to make this recipe over and over again.  The mix was a bit too loose and moist to form into patties, so I added more breadcrumbs as well  as some grated parmesan cheese to firm the mixture up.  I used real bread crumbs (i.e. bread that I processed into crumbs)  to make them extra good.  I also dredged them in flour and then fried them in a little olive oil and this gave them a nice, crispy exterior which added to the flavor.

This recipe is an excellent "base" recipe but IMHO it needs some adjustment on the seasoning. The taste of cumin is truly overwhelming--I adjusted to 1 tsp instead of 1 TBS and it was much better. All in all a very good recipe.

I used my food processor for the whole process and it worked great! I used a large can of black beans (it was in my pantry to use up) and just doubled the rest of the ingrediants. This was very easy to make and now I have a bunch in the freezer. We baked ours and I think next time I will pan fry them in some olive oil to get a crispy texture. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very quick and easy recipe. I omitted the peppers, used red onions, seasoned breadcrumbs and cut the amount of chili and cumin in half. I didn't care for the chili and cumin taste and next time I will experiment with spices that I like since the cumin and chili over power the taste.  I also used an extra large egg and that seemed to hold everything together nicely.  I will definately make this recipe again.

Original recipe has good texture. Be sure to drain & rinse in a sieve, not just pour the goup out of the can. Mash by hand, not in the processor; I used a grid type potato masher. For those who are getting liquid in the veggies, chop the them, rather than pulverize, in the processor. I pulsed on/off 2-3 times, scraped down, repeat until 1/8 to 1/4-inch pieces. There was no excess liquid. I doubled the recipe with a 29 oz. can, which measured a scant 3 cups after rinsing. I used 1/2 the cumin and a red pepper, but otherwise the exact recipe. My husband is a hearty eater, but loved these and asked for them the next day. I'll post a pic of the unmixed ingredients as well as the burger.

Skip the egg and use 1 cup of panko bread crumbs instead and they will have the perfect consistency and be a five star worthy burger!

These are great! I followed some reviews and put everything in the food processor. I didn't have a bell pepper and hate cooked bell pepper anyway, so I used a carrot. I used oats instead of bread crumbs to make them even more healthy. I rinsed the black beans but should have let them drain longer - they were a bit wet so my mixture was runny. I treated them like pancakes, poured the "batter" into a hot pan w/ a little oil then fried them up. I got 8 thin patties from 1 can of beans, my toddler LOVED them, was shoving them in her face w/ two hands. Great lunch for us girls during the week - my guys won't touch them with a 10 foot pole.

These were really fun to make! I read a lot of reviews beforehand, so from others' suggestions I added another egg and froze the formed burgers for about 15 minutes before baking, as well as laying the beans on some paper towels to let them dry out a bit after rinsing them. I had no problem with them crumbling or anything. Also, I made 6 smaller patties, and made sure not to make them too thick so that the texture would be even throughout. I also flipped them halfway through the baking time. Oh, and I added corn because my fiance and I love corn. We both thought they tasted good, but that there was definitely too much of something-it may have been cumin, which I hardly ever use. I'm going to make them again just with less cumin, or maybe I'll just leave it out altogether. Also, mashing the beans with a fork seemed ridiculous. I used my hands and it took far less time than it would have with a fork. The finished burgers were served with the Baked French Fries I recipe on the site.

These were delicious and relatively easy.  I took some advice of other reviewers and mixed everything in the food processor, adding more breadcrumbs until the mixture was thick enough to form into patties.  Instead of serving them on buns, we topped them with pomegranate guacamole and/or sour cream mixed with mango salsa.  Wonderful vegetarian meal!!

I just went and reread all the reviews and don't get what I did wrong - but it must have been a doozy because these were awful for us.  In seven years of cooking together, this is only the second dish my husband wouldn't eat.  These had absolutely no flavor - and I added all of the spices, chili sauce, garlic, etc.  Usually if a recipe is so-so, I'll remake it.  This isn't one of them for us.  I hope others have better luck with it.

OMG that was good!!!!!  This is definitely a do-over again and again and again... !  These are by FAR better then the expensive ones you get in the grocery store and much better tasting.    I topped a whole wheat bun with my black bean patty, guacamoli, onions, tomato slices, spinach and pepper jack cheese with a bit of chipolata mayo. It was messy but melt in your mouth magic!!!  Will repeat often. :-)

My husband and I made these for the first time last night and we were so happy with them!! Instead of using canned black beans we used dried white beans because that is what we had on hand and we also used oats instead of breadcrumbs for added nutritional value and added finely chopped yellow crookneck squash. It was so tasty. We are both meat eaters that are trying to eat more of a flexitarian diet and this recipe will be added to our list of tasty veggie dishes!!

I just made these for dinner. Very Good. I used this recipe as a base then tweaked to my likings/availabilities. I doubled the recipe to ensure leftovers for lunches, my version made 18! Added 1 can of corn, 1 cup of cooked lentils and 2 cups of cooked brown rice. I substituted steel cut oats for the breadcrumbs. Used 2 eggs. I live in a small studio apartment with no counter space and I don't have a food processor or a blender. So, I put all ingredients into a large mixing bowl and mixed with my hands until I found the desired consistency. This move totally worked out to my benefit. I placed 6 patties at a time on an oiled baking sheet and refrigerated for about an hour. Baked 12 mins per side at 375F. Perfect! Thank you for such a great idea!

Great Eats.  I used old fashion oat meal ground in food processor instead of bread crumbs. Added some mushrooms. Let set over night so oat meal absorbed moisture. Also, dried beans in paper towel and used paper towels to squeeze out moisture in green pepper and onion ground in food processor. Made great patties. Cooked in frying pan with a little oil on low heat.

Used 2 eggs and everything else by the recipe.  Very tasty and didn't fall apart or anything.  Other than the fact that it tastes like pure cumin, I will definitely make this recipe again (with about a teaspoon of cumin instead of a tablespoon). -I've made round 2 and 3 now, and settled on a teaspoon of cumin, 2 medium or small eggs, red instead of green bell, and add portabella mushrooms to the veggies.  If you add a few (1/8 - 1/4 cup) extra bread crumbs and dry the beans and diced vegetables very well using paper towels, you won't have any trouble with patties falling apart.

I can't get enough of these burgers, although I do make a fair amount of changes.  I omit the cumin and chili powder entirely and instead add chopped jalepeno peppers.  In order to keep the burgers together, it is important to put the peppers and onions in a sieve to express all the moisture after they go through the food processor or you will end up with watery patties.  I use plain oatmeal instead of bread crumbs, and double the amount.  Additionally, I like to shred parmesan cheese into the mixture before forming the patties.  They are fantastic with bbq sauce

These are delicious!  I eat frozen black bean burgers regularly, and these blow them away!  I'm going to start making a big batch for my husband and I to eat for lunch!  I made these with "Baked Basil Fries" also on this site.  What a combo!  Thanks for this recipe!!  (Try putting the bean mixture in the refrigerator for a few minutes before you make the patties and cook them a little longer.  They won't fall apart that way.)

These were great.  I followed the recipe with just a few exceptions. Because I'm trying to watch my sodium intake, I used dry beans instead of canned. Because I had a whole bag of beans, I ended up multiplying the recipe times 4 so I could use them all. Instead of guesstimating the sizes of the patties, I weighed everything and figured out that I had enough mix to make about 18 4 oz patties. I don't buy whole eggs, so I used eggbeaters.
 
Other reviewers mentioned problems with the patties holding together. I followed the advice of others and made sure to get as much liquid as possible out of my peppers, onions and garlic. I lined my colander with paper towels, put the veggies in, topped with more paper towels, then weighed it down with a plate and some canned goods. I let it drain for about 10 minutes. I also let the mix sit overnight in the fridge before forming the patties.

Huge hit at my girls night!  I added 1/2 a can of corn and fresh cilantro.  Then topped it off with pepper jack cheese mango salsa and avocado.  No one missed having meat.  I may make some to keep on hand in the freezer.

Absolutely delicious. As another poster commented, I pureed 1 cup of brown rice and 3/4 c. shredded mozzarella and added it to the mixture. I didn't add the hot sauce and only put in a 1 tsp of chili powder. I also used 4 cloves of garlic. Fried them up in some olive oil and they were divine!

These black bean burgers were amazing!  I made these burgers exactly like how the video did.  I didn't think they were going to hold together since I processed the bell pepper, onion, and garlic, the mixture was kinda watery.  I did add a little more bread crumbs in hopes it would not be sooo wet.  The burgers came out great.  I made a total of 5 burgers.  I also made a mayo sauce out of 1 cup of mayo, 2 chopped adobe chipotles, and 1 teaspoon of adobe sauce.  I toasted a piece of bread, added some mayo, avocadoes, tomatoes, and then the burger.  It was pretty delicious!  Will be making this recipe again!

Made these tonight. The mushed beans make it seem a bit "doughy". Only the flavors of included were not enough for me. I added some mushrooms and roughly ground oatmeal, jalapenos, lemon salt, and crackers as I had no breadcrumbs.
 I just hated the texture, mushy and soft. NOT meaty texture.

Very good! I pureed the onions and green peppers to get rid of their texture. I also added an extra 1/2 cup of bread crumbs. I followed others advice about freezing them. I pattied them up and placed them in layers of parchment paper. They worked really well on the grill the next day. Also I tripled the recipe so I would have some to freeze and eat some other day.

These are yummy indeed. I used two eggs and had no problem with the sticking together. For lunch the next day I mashed up two leftover patties and fried them up in a little oil to put them on a flour tortilla as a burrito. That was delicious.

Really good! I doubled the recipe. They do fall apart a little, but I think I did a pretty good job of getting them to stay together by adding an extra egg and refridgerating them for about 2 hours. I chopped up the pepper and onion myself, and used a garlic press, since I don't have a food processor, and I think it worked out fine. I didn't completely double the breadcrumbs. The beans, I mashed with my hands after discovering a fork wasn't too effective. I must have made larger burgers because my doubled recipe made 5 patties. I baked them for 15 minutes on each side.

These are delicious! I've made these several times and even meat-eating friends enjoy them.

Don't over-mash the beans or the burgers will be mushy. They're better with a bit of "meaty" texture.

I made mine vegan by replacing the two eggs with a mixture of 4 T potato starch + 4 T water. I usually reduce or eliminate salt in recipes, but I found these to be better with the addition of 1/2 tsp salt. Pleased with the results when using Thai chili sauce and plain bread crumbs.

Made this dish for dinner tonight along with some homemade fries. It was a HIT !! even with my picky eater ( what he didn't know didn't hurt him ). Changes I made were this, I used one 15 oz can of black beans  ( Drained ) and 1 can of refried beans, strainded the onion and pepper mixture ( using 1/2 yellow pepper instead of green ) and seasoned with Emerils essance instead of the chili powder and cumin. I baked in the oven at 350, but thought it needed more cooking time so I turned up the oven to 375 and cooked another 10 min. Will make again, but may use brown rice instead of bread crumbs to see if they hold together better

I never thought I would say this, but I could give up ground meat burgers in exchange for these!  The taste was awesome!  I served them on pretzel rolls with a cilantro-lime mayonnaise, fresh tomato and red onion slices.  Also, I used dried black beans that I had cooked instead of canned beans.  Definitely will make again...and again...

I thought the flavor of these was wonderful! I left out the green pepper, though. Mine also came out very mushy. I think I might try them again frying them in a pan. They would have been much better with a little bit of crispiness....

WOW!! This was the very first veggie burger I have ever eaten in my entire life, and I absolutely loved it!!! Wish I would have discovered this one a long time ago:) These are the few changes I made: 
1 used banana pepper in place of bell. 2 used red onion. 3 omitted garlic(had none) and added garlic powder instead. 4 used 1tbs flaxseed and 3tbs water in place of egg. 5 used cayenne, not chili powder. 6 spread chili sauce on bread instead of adding to burger(why I did that? IDK =) 7 in place of bread crumbs I used garlic&cheese croutons and just threw them into the processor for a couple of seconds.   
I ate it on a whole wheat sandwich thin spread with thai sauce, and sliced some tomato, onions, and cabbage. DELICIOUS!! I halved the recipe and it made two large patties. Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!!

I used the other recommendations of adding 2 eggs, and using about 1/4 cup more bread crumbs. I also added about 1/4 cup of shredded chedder cheese which made it stick together even better (not to mention add a nice flavor). I cooked mine in a skillet with some olive oil - turned out great. Next time I think I'll make six patties instead of 4 and make them thinner (they were a bit too thick and big for my tastes). My boyfriend who is a meat eater had two of these! I'll make again for sure.

This was a great lunch.  I added jalapeno and a few mushrooms because I needed to use them.  Very tasty. I didn't have a problem with them falling apart; I placed the bowl of mixture in the fridge while I cleaned up the kitchen and it had time to come to a nice consistency before making patties.

These were VERY good! Did not have green pepper, so I added an 8oz can of corn. I chopped everything in my mini chopper, including the black beans. First round: corn, onion, garlic, Second round: black beans, then combined in a bowl. Since I used the corn, I upped the bread crumbs to ~1 cup. I did not have any issues with them falling apart. I baked them as directed and topped with pepper jack cheese. Will definitely make these again!

Maybe I did something wrong?  Mine were bland and dry...I couldnt even finish one.  With all the great reviews I'm tempted to try the recipe again, just incase, but I dont want to waste my time if they come out the same.  They sure smelled good as I was making them...just didnt cook up how I thought they would.

These were amazing. I was truly astonished. I did freeze them and they cooked great. after i cooked each side i squished the patty and made it thinner. I didn't use the food processor, I just chopped finely. I am not a vegetarian, I just thought this could be a great cheap meal and it is.

cThank you sooooo much for this recipe! My daughter and I loved these Homemade Black Bean Veggie Burgers, and we always have black beans and others in the house! Due to our Cajun/Creole Heritage, we replaced the Chili Powder with Cajun seasoning and added a tablespoon of Chia Seeds for that extra POW! These are now on our weekly menu, and are in accord with our weight loss goals. I love that it is such a simple recipe and is delicious. MC

Just tried these with a few changes & they're wonderful!  I used 1/2 cup of mushrooms pureed with, 2 T minced shallots, 2 tsp garlic salt, 1/2 tsp hot pepper flakes, 2 eggs, & a T of worcestershire sauce, & a 1/2 tsp cumin.  Then mixed it by hand with 1 can of rinsed, well drained, coursely mashed black beans & 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.  I let the mixture meld together for about 5 minutes & they stayed together perfectly.  I baked them for about 8 minutes on each side.  This made 6 not huge burgers, but I served them on frozen garlic Texas toast knots with herbed mayo, so they were just the right size.  Next time I'm going to add some grated carrot & wheat germ & make a double batch.  Best burgers I've ever had!

I love these burgers! My bf requests I make them often, so I always make a double batch and freeze some. They cook just as well from frozen as fresh. I do have a few tips and tricks for the recipe though: 
I use freshly cooked black beans instead of canned. I also use a food processor but not for all the ingredients at once. I first mashed the black beans (sooo much easier in a processor). then removed them and chopped garlic, onion, and red bell pepper (in that order). This gives me some extra moisture to help the burgers stick together :) I've used both 1 egg and 2 for a double batch - 1 egg if it is large, and I've never had a problem w/them falling apart. Another trick is to refrigerate the patties after you make them for at least an hour before cooking - helps them hold their shape!

I made this exactly as written but had some trouble with them staying together. I should have headed others' advice and added more egg and breadcrumbs. As it turned out, this would have made good filling for a bean burrito or taco, but as a burger it was kind of a letdown.

Great reciepe! I used black and brown rice mixture instead of the bread crumbs, added hemp seeds and powder for protein (1 tblsp of each), and amino acid for added flaver. WOW! Also added 1/2 chopped carrot to the veggie mix. Grilled, and very good!

My family and I are not vegetarian, but are trying to add more vegetarian meals to our diet. We all really loved these burgers, but I gave the recipe 4 stars because I made various modifications based on other reviews I read. I cut the cumin down to 1 tsp, but still felt it was a bit overwhelming, so would definitely half that in the future. I didn't want to drain  the veggies of their flavorful juices as some suggested so I ended up using about a half cup each of bread crumbs and quick oats that I had pulsed in the blender in order to thicken the mixture enough to form patties. I hate salty food, but I also hate bland food. I noticed that some reviewers commented that these burgers were bland so I added half tsp. tamari, which added some depth to the flavor as well. As modified, my recipe made 6 generous patties, which I sprayed very lightly with canola pan spray and baked as directed for about 25 minutes. The burgers held together very well. I served them with a squeeze of lime, lettuce, tomato, a slice of sweet onion and spicy ketchup, made by adding a squeeze of lime and chipotle hot sauce to regular ketchup. I served sweet potato fries on the side to round out this excellent meal.

WOW amazing! I followed a few hints that others had left. I drained the excess moisture from the onion/pepper mixture using a few paper towels. I also rolled my patties in bread crumbs. It held up great and gave the outside a bit of crunchness. Also freezes very well! I double the recipe when I make it so I will have some on hand for a quick lunch/dinner. Yummm!!

Very good recipe.  Followed exactly and baked in the oven.  As good as any veggie burger I ever had, and even my toddler ate it up so it was not too spicy for us.  Only tip I can offer is to grease baking sheet or foil to allow for easy flipping/clean up.

Delicious!

This meatless burger recipe is very flavorful and satisfying.  I used a food processor for the ingredients so there was a bit more water from the blending process.  I also added 1/4 of a jalapeno pepper.  I used garlic and cheese toast as the breading... about 1 1/2 cups worth to firm up the mixture.  Cooking time was about 8 minutes in a Foreman Grill cooking 2 patties at a time.  With the extra bread crumbs added, this made 6 patties slightly larger than a standard burger bun.

My wife and I loved this recipe and will definitely use it again!

Absolutely delicious. I added 2 eggs and just eye-balled the bread crumbs until I could form patties without them totally falling apart. What's great is you can literally add anything you want in terms of type of beans (I used kidney beans because that's what was in my pantry), veggies (I added carrots), grains (add quinoa or brown rice for added fiber), and spices and they're guaranteed to taste delightful. Great go-to meal when you're in a pinch and don't have a lot of time to spend on planning and cooking!

I have tried several recipes for veggie burgers over the last couple of years, and this one is the best by far!  I made mine in a non-stick pan on the stove.  They fall apart a little when you flip them, so I 'm not sure how it would work to grill them (although I'd like to try!).  There is plenty of flavor, so no condiments are needed.  My husband thought they smelled so good, that he even tried one!

These were great.  I did everything by hand, chopping and mashing. No problem with being runny or falling apart.  Rinsed the beans and left them to drain for at least an hour then tossed them in a paper towel. Used 5 cloves of garlic and added 1.5 t of liquid smoke.  A little more bread crumbs because there was just a little left in the container.  Used the suggested chipotle mayo to stay with the flavor profile and topped with lettuce, tomato, and avocado.

As others suggested, I dried off the rinsed beans to keep the burgers from falling apart. For a more complex flavor, I halved the chili powder and cumin, and added black pepper and McCormick Montreal Steak Seasoning. Veggie burgers can seem dry on a hamburger bun, even with cheese and condiments, because there's no fat content from beef to moisten the sandwich. After trying one of these patties on a hamburger bun with cheese and mayonnaise, the next night I made a kind of patty melt: I warmed the patty (which had been in the fridge) a bit in the microwave. Then I formed it to be flatter and more square. I placed it between two pieces of bread (buttered on the outsides) along with a slice of cheese, sauteed onions, and a bit of mayo. I grilled it up in a frying pan long enough to heat it through, to melt the cheese, and to brown the bread. It was very tasty, and I will be making this recipe again with my variations.

Nice flavor. We enjoyed these with some fresh lime and salsa. And although this isn't a "WOW" recipe, I'd make it again. I didn't serve them on buns, but with some Mexican rice and corn. Oh, and don't forget the fresh lime and salsa!

These burgers had great flavor but if the recipe author reads this-- please edit your recipe (if you can) to add a step.  

"After chopping the peppers and onion in the food processor, drain the vegetables on several layers of paper towels. " 

Otherwise, the mixture is mushy.  I added more bread crumbs (fresh, probably should have used dry), then oatmeal, then oat bran.  Finally, after playing with these for a day, I shaped them (with difficulty) and baked them.  THEN I took them to the Fourth of July picnic and finished them on the grill.

As I said, the flavor is fantastic but, as the recipe is written, it has simply too much liquid to be able to form the burgers.

Also, I used minced chipotle pepper instead of hot sauce and added chopped cilantro as well.

This was my first experience making black bean burgers and it was easy with this recipe! I didn't have a bell pepper so I just used the onions and garlic. It worked out fine that way. I don't think i used enough hot sauce because they needed more flavor...but with cheese and ketchup it worked for my first attempt!

This is a good basic veggie burger recipe, i added red and yellow bell peppers, grated carrots and rolled oats. Next time I will add corn.
And be sure that you don't make them to thick or it will be crispy on the outside and mushy on the inside.this recipe makes more like 5 or 6 burgers.
All in all this is a good recipe, just play with it to fit your taste.

I made these last night and they were delicious! I followed tips here and added can of corn, and topped with slice of tomato, lettuce, avocado, and sour cream. (also can use guacamole spread, my daughter opted for that). So yummy!! Only prob: after baking they crumbled (not firm at all), so I (very unwillingly) fried the rest in a tiny amt of oil in a pan.  I baked a few others just to compare. Frying is not what I usually do in the house, but the family devoured them that way!! Figures! Will try to refrigerate longer and add extra egg next time to firm it up. Thanks for all the tips! It's lunch for me today! :)

Yummy! I cooked them a bit longer and at 385 - going for a crispier burger - that turned out well.  I also followed the advice of previous posts and added egg and refridgerated for a couple hrs before cooking.
I ate the 1st one with ketchup, mustard, lettuce, toms, etc - like a normal burger and that was yummy, the 2nd one I put salsa on (which I normally love on burgers) but salsa didnt add much to this burger as its natural flavor is already along those same lines.  
I got 5 good sized patties out of this recipe.

They're pretty good.  I used chipotle chili powder, which I think gave it a distinctive flavour.  Definately a keeper to work with.

These burgers were delicious. My husband was skeptical at first but after trying them loved them. Like one commenter mentioned, I tried to make sure the beans were dry before mashing. I added a bit more bread crumbs than the recipe calls for and also added some spicy taco seasoning to the burger mix for added kick. This really upped the flavor. I topped it off with spicy sour cream, spinach and arugula, and sharp cheddar cheese. Will definitely be making these again.

I really liked this!! I did double the bread crumbs, and used Ritz crackers for them. I also added cooked New East roasted red pepper quinoa into the food processor for more protein and flavor! I added just about half the box...not the whole thing. Only used one egg like it says to do. I feel that the double bread crumbs are what helped the patties stay nicely together:)

I doubled the recipe for leftovers. I added a few things to the recipe:  rolled oats and some 1/2 cup of cooked brown rice to gold the patties together, 4 eggs,crushed croutons instead of bread crumbs. It came ok, kind of bland. The next day, I sliced the patties in half, warmed them in peanut oil and Goya Sazon coriander and annatto seasoning to add some flavor. The Goya seasoning made it great! Next time I will add the Goya seasoning to the patty mixture.

Although these actually look like  burger patties this recipe is a total fail! I have had good veggie burgers before but all I could taste was beans, chili powder and cumin with the texture of refried beans on a bun. Bleh!

I put them in tortillas and made burros out of them. They were good as such, but burgers, no.

Wow! Made these for dinner after my 15 yr old's football game. I prepped the patties earlier in the day so they could set in the fridge while I went to the game (and so my people were not aware of what I was "hiding" in the burgers). I added shredded zucchini (salted to pull out water) and a bit of balsamic vinegar. I had no problem with the patties holding together, I think because I chilled them for a few hours before shaping the patties. I sprayed a pan with canola oil and cooked on medium for about 4 min per side. You should realize that I live in a house with 4 males who love their beef burgers. My 12 yr old no longer will eat beef burgers, my VERY picky dad said they were decent (from him, that is a HUGE compliment!), my husband called his sister to tell her about them and posted notes on his Facebook. The best part is my 15 yr old, who I have to wrestle with to eat anything that is good for him, ate 2 of them! I didn't tell him what he was eating until he was finished his 1st and was telling me he liked the "flame-broiled" taste, which he thought was just a different cooking method. He just curled his nose and then asked for a 2nd. If you want to keep the Beefy texture do not process the beans as noted in some of the comments. These are a bit mushy if you reheat in the microwave, but do well reheating on the stove.

Low sodium version to make it more heart healthy.  I made it using no salt added beans, part green pepper and part red pepper, and a little more garlic. Since I used my blender to chop the vegetables they were slightly more juicy, so I needed a little extra bread crumbs. I used plain panko bread crumbs, also a lower sodium option. These turned out great, my husband took the left overs for lunch and this was his first "black bean burger".  Also added so fresh sage.  I doubled the recipe so I could freeze some burgers for the future.  To keep the cholesterol low, instead of two eggs, I used whole egg + 1 egg white. I was able to get the sodium down to about 129 mg/burger (11 burgers from a double recipe).  Paired nicely with roasted herb tri-colored potatoes and sauteed kale and mushrooms. No suffering on our low sodium diet.

These were awesome! My vegetarian roommate has had every brand of pre-made veggie burgers, and she said this recipe was better than all of them by far. I doubled the recipe and got 8 good-sized burgers. I followed other reviewers' advice to rinse and dry the beans as well as drain the pepper/onion mix. I used ground oatmeal instead of bread crumbs. I made the mixture the night before and left it in the fridge over night. I didn't have a problem with the mixture being too liquidy. I think letting it sit in the fridge overnight helped the excess liquid absorb into the oatmeal. I want to make this again (and again) and experiment with different vegetables.

I read a lot of reviews prior to making these. Hubby is a true vegetarian so I had to omit the egg. I used EVERYTHING above, except I used 1/2 red bell pepper since I didn't have green. I added about 1/4 of a small zucchini, chopped and about 1/2 of a small carrot chopped as well (used my processor)  I also mashed the beans with my potato masher and used a paper towel to squeeze them to make sure all water was out. I did the same thing with ALL the veggies prior to adding to the beans.  I added about 1 tbsp of fat free thousand island dressing to sort of make up for the lack of egg and the consistency. I also added some parsley flakes, 1 tbsp salt, 1/2 tablespoon of cracked black pepper and I cut the cumin down to under a teaspoon. I added a dash of cayenne pepper....everything mixed together awesome and I got 3 nice size patties out of the recipe.  I used parchment paper on a baking sheet and sprayed it with a lowfat nonstick spray.  I also put a small cup of water on the pan to add some moisture while they were cooking...

I made these in my vitamix.  I threw in the onions and pepper and mixed.  Then added the eggs and spices and mixed again.  Then I added half of the black beans, mixed and then added the other half and mixed again.  This gave the black beans some texture, some were whole or half others were really mashed.  I dumped all this in a bowl and then added the bread crumbs and made into patties.  I did some on the grill and others I baked.  I liked the baked ones because they stayed nice and moist while the ones on the grill were a little on the dry and crispy side.  They had a nice spicy kick.

Excellent recipe!  Easy & far superior to anything store-bought!
My substitutions:
1. Sauteed the onions, peppers & garlic in a bit of oil (used green, red & yellow peppers), then once cool, squeezed out excess liquid in cheesecloth
2. Added Mexican oregano & liberal salt & pepper
3. Used more bread crumbs than called for
4. Froze patties then baked directly from freezer
5. Blended all ingredients except bread crumbs in food processor.  Once blended, manually mixed in crumbs.

Very good! I threw everything in the food processor, it was so easy! I did not add bell pepper because I am not a fan. I did add corn at the very end. I did not need to use extra bread crumbs, mine held together find without! I used Franks Red Hot Chili Sauce in and on the burgers, excellent!

Awesome recipe! Followed exactly and had no problems whatsoever. I pre-made the patties in my patty press and let them sit for a couple hours before cooking, then I baked them in the oven. They were fantastic, and filling!

You don't have to be vegetarian to love these burgers! They are a little messy because they don't hold together as well as a regular burger, but they are really yummy!

Great recipe! Four stars for me because add'l bread crumbs were needed to keep the mixture together. I used only the ingredients called for in the original recipe, and found this to be a great vegetarian alternative that I'll make again and again. I liked the amount of heat from the hot sauce and chili powder. Instead of baking or grilling, you can also use a little cooking spray and cook these up right on the stove.

Excellent!  I used an entire green pepper, pureed with the onion until homogenous and drained as much liquid as possible before adding pureed beans and ~1 1/4c ground oatmeal/bread crumbs mix.  I ended up with 6 medium-large patties which after baking at 375 for 22 minutes, I flipped, topped with cheddar cheese and broiled until bubbly.  These were quite filling and healthy!  Next time I will add a tsp or so of salt and pepper to the mix.

Great flavor, great alternative!  These burgers aren't wimpy sized, flavorless globs of veggies.  They are tasty, filling, and I'm definitely planning on making them again.

The only difference I'd make is one more egg and some more bread crumb to stiffen it up a bit.

These tasted okay, but I think it might have been a bit too spicy for me. I also had the same problem as some others where it came out too soggy, even though I added a ton more breadcrumbs. I did not dry or drain the vegetables like some suggested though so that might be the cause of excess water. If you don't drain all the water, this recipe makes a much better burrito filling.

These are actually amazing. I had all but given up on veggie burgers and these have restored my faith in vegetarian food for amateurs like me. I baked these in the oven and didn't have any trouble with them falling apart as other reviewers described. These have a really great texture, they're filling, and they've got a nice kick of spice. These are now my go-to burger and I'm not even vegetarian. They're that good.

I'm not a vegetarian or close to it. I tried these though and really liked them - using them as part of my weight watchers diet. Did mix everything in the food processor, veggies first, egg and spices second, beans last. Added an whole jalapeno and substitued oats for bread crumbs. Browned in olive oil and ate it with a teaspoon of light s. cream and a dash of hot sauce. Used a tablesppon this morning inside of a breakfast burrito - very filling!

Doubled the recipe, adding one additional egg and an extra half-cup of breadcrumbs. The burgers held together well since I heeded other's suggestions to drain and dry the beans, and to drain the extra moisture out of the chopped pepper, onion and garlic mix. Since I had only one can of black beans, I added a can of red kidney beans. Fussy vegetarians declared these a hit. Consider adding a little salt if you are not sodium restricted.

Fabulous! Super-easy and very tasty. Mine fell apart when cooked in the oven but I may not have formed them tightly enough. However, it didn't matter because I ended up eating them on a bed of spinach with hot salsa and sour cream. Trust me, that's the way to eat these bean burgers. 

It was a lovely lunch to pack - black bean burger with salsa in one container and spinach in another. Heat the burger and eat on spinach.

WONDERFUL!!! BUT with these changes.  I doubled the recipe, used a red pepper instead of green, added mushrooms, carrots, cilantro, salt, pepper, 2 cups cooked brown rice and 2tbs of chili sauce (i like a little more heat.) I made them into 10 patties and baked them 12 min on each side.  They are definitely a bit mushy but oh my gosh that flavor!!! I also really enjoyed the addition of brown rice, they really filled me up!  I ate them with no bun and a little salsa and guacamole for lunch!! AwESOME!! Will definitely make these again!!!

I followed the recipe exactly.  I froze them as some had suggested before grilling on foil sprayed with a little EVOO.  The only thing I will change for next time would be to add another egg.  They tasted great, much better than store bought.

These very lovely! The changes I made were the following: I added 1/4 cup of crushed walnuts; 1/4 cup of mushrooms; substituted yellow pepper for green; replaced cumin with a curry powder mix; added fresh cilantro and dill; added an extra egg; and omitted hot sauce (I like them mild!). I also forgot to add garlic, but they came out lovely nonetheless. Next time I will increase the amount of mushrooms to 1/2 cup, as I find these add a lovely flavour to any veggie burger mix.

Used 1/2 and 1/2 of oatmeal and panko as I didn't have regular bread crumbs.  Otherwise, followed recipe exactly.  Result was very good.  I agree with others that these are 1) easy to make and 2) better than store bought burgers.  Happy I made a double batch and froze 1/2.

YUM! Loved these!!!  I was nervous about the patties falling apart so I ended up dicing and patting with paper towels instead of using the food processor. I rinsed and drained the black beans then poured them onto a couple of paper towels while I diced and put everything else together. I was hesitant to use all of the chili powder, cumin and chili sauce called for but I went with it to give the recipe a fair shot and I'm glad that I did. SOOO tasty!! I did add 2 TBS of wheat germ in place of a little bit of bread crumbs. I had no problem with the patties sticking or falling apart ... used non stick foil on my baking sheet. I did cook longer (probably 15 mins on 1st side then 10 on the 2nd) and more time would have been fine. I will definitely be making these again and will try my processor next time b/c dicing the veggies took a little while.

My vegetarian 11-year-old gave this five stars.  I used Cajun seasoning mix to boost the "wow" factor. Also subbed about 2 T of chopped poblano pepper instead of the bell pepper.  He ate them all throughout the day, so they must have been good.  For a meat-eating mom who likes a good burger once in a blue moon, they didn't really do much for me.  I'm not a burger person, though, so am relying on his more expert opinion for the star rating!

I made these up and put in the fridge til dinner. Held together fine and crisped up a bit but the inside was still too much of a refried bean consistency after 30 min on the grill.  Taste was good and a lime sour cream was a nice compliment. I honestly didn't like them as much as the frozen version but they fit in my category of "cheap, easy and good enough" so I'll probably make them again and see if I can get a texture more to my liking.

I don't really care for the spices used in this recipe. So, I opted for less onion and bellpepper, then added corn and carrots. I used about 1 tablespoon of balsamic dressing. Yummy!

These were just alright, in my opinion.  I fear that cumin caused the downfall of these burgers.  I have this spice in my spice rack but seldom use it because I don't care for the smell...but decided to give it a try.  Initially I thought they smelled yummy but the taste was a whole different matter.  I think the combination of the cumin taste and the slightly chalky texture from the black beans was a real problem.  We ate them, they weren't terrible...but I did have to load mine with relish, ketchup and mustard to hide the cumin taste.  I added 1/4 can of drained niblet corn and used a red pepper instead of green.  These looked really pretty!  I also used a HUGE amount of freshly ground black pepper and several generous dashes of extra hot red pepper sauce.  I like the idea of making my own veggie burgers and will keep looking for the perfect recipe.  This one has potential though, I might try to tweak it to our tastes.

This is the first recipe I've encountered on this site that has been raved about that not only I didn't love, but actually I disliked. My brother disliked them, too. The only way we could finish eating them was by putting a slice a cheese and a couple slice of pickles to distract our taste buds from the burgers themselves. Needless to say, I won't ever be making these again.

These were awesome, once I got them working. When I put the egg in, it made things WAY to liquidy, so I doubled everything else to make up for it. It only made about 4 patties for me, even after I doubled. In all, this is an EXCELLENT base for bean burgers that all my friends liked. It needed a bit more spice, but I had forgotten the hot sauce when I made it. Next time I will make a nice peppery broccoli slaw to top them, and these burgers will rock!

I must admit, I was VERY reluctant to try these. I have tried those disgusting things in the freezer isle of the grocery store and those could seriously ruin someones perception of a veggie burger! These were great!!!!!!! With the cumin and chili powder it gives it a taco taste. I topped it with cheese and it was GLORIOUS! I used 2 eggs and I didn't measure the bread crumbs, I just poured and mixed until the mixture was sticky.

What a fabulous alternative to hamburgers!!! Thank you to the reviewer's advice to drain and dry the black beans. I chopped the onion and green pepper in the food processor. (I might also saute it next time to bring out its sweet flavors). I removed the vegetables and put all the other ingredients into the food processor. (I used heart-healthy rolled oats instead of bread crumbs, and doubled that amount, as reviewers recommended. I also used 2 eggs instead of one. I mixed the vegetables with the bean mixture and placed it in the refrigerator for a couple of hours the thicken up the mixture. I used a little bit of olive oil and PAM and placed them on my grill pan. I left them there for about 5 minutes, used the PAM again and flipped them for about another 5 minutes. My husband and I really enjoyed the flavor, but our kids did not. Next time I will season it with basil and oregano to make the flavor more appealing to the kids.

The cumin is a little overpowering - I suggest using a teaspoon rather than a tablespoon.  I included roasted corn and it added great flavor!  Like other reviewers, I also recommend using 3/4 cup of bread crumbs, otherwise the burgers tend to fall apart.  The recipe is good; tweak it to your individual taste and it can be great.  I used the leftovers for tacos the next night, and it was a big hit.  I would definitely make this burger again - it is easy and super fast!

Very good.  I used fresh, whole-wheat breadcrumbs spiced with red and black pepper, chipotle powder, garlic powder, and smoked paprika...didn't measure them but ended up using about a slice and a half.  I omitted the fresh garlic because I was out and the chili powder and cumin because I don't like them and added some shredded cheddar cheese.  They were delicious and even my confirmed-carnivore husband said they were really good.  Next time (and there will be a next time!) I'll add some cooked brown rice for the chewy texture that's missing.

These were really quite good as the recipe was written.  I will definitely make changes next time, though.  I think the step to food process the coarsely chopped onion and green pepper serves to create too much liquid.  I had to add about triple the amount of bread crumbs to absorb that liquid.  Plus, I didn't care for the crunchiness of the onions and peppers once the burgers were cooked.  So next time, I am going to omit the green pepper and substitute roasted green chile instead.  Additionally, I am going to finely dice the onion and then saute it in a little bit of coconut oil before adding it to the mashed bean mix.  I anticipate great results.  Thanks for the recipe!  Recipes like this make it easy to consider vegetarianism as a viable lifestyle!

i'm a meat eater but i've always loved veggie burgers. finally i got around to trying to make them at home and i used this recipe with minor changes:
i used 2 cans of beans, 1 cup of bread crumbs, 2 whole eggs, some celery, and less of the spices [omitted the hot sauce, and used 2 t. of the other two; i used super spicy chili powder and it was caliente as is!]. to add to the final product, and to compliment the spicyness of the burgers, i whipped up an avocado-ranch spread [mashed a half of an avocado, mixed in about a T. of ranch and 1/2 t. of sour cream]. with a slice of provolone, the avo-ranch spread, and a wheat bun, these are SUPERB! i suprised my veggie-burger-skeptic of a mom with these and we're both hooked!
thanks for the recipe!!

These are excellent.  Even my carnivorous husband loved them and has requested them several times.  I add whatever I have on hand in terms of veggies - corn, shredded carrot, zucchini etc.  They don't hold up well on a Foreman grill, but are great in the pan or in foil on the bbq grill.  Next I plan to make them with 1/2 beans and 1/2 soy "sausage" meat - I think they'll be awesome.  Use whatever seasonings you like - I usually add Montreal Steak Seasoning to the cumin & chili powder.

My husband is a vegetarian and I cringe every time I look at the price of store-bought veggie burgers.  I made these today and he told me never to buy veggie burgers ever again!  I used all of the ingredients according to the recipe but I just threw it all into my food processor and made a paste. It was a little too thin then, so I added a few more bread crumbs, coated my hands with oil, and shaped them into balls.  I pressed the balls on a wax paper lined cookie cheet and stuck the whole thing in the freezer.  Once they were frozen solid, I threw one on the grill and put the rest in a freezer bag.  Thank you for this recipe!!!  Oh I did use egg beaters instead of a whole egg to cut the fat.  AND my husband said they taste just like the veggie burgers from Chili's.

not quite sure about the other reviews because these were a tremendous hit - as-is.  normally i make all sorts of changes/additions/deletions to recipes, but didn't here. and they were really a winner.  i had no problem with them sticking to the cookie sheet, and the flavor was excellent.  i made them smaller (ended up with 6), and served them with a "dipping sauce" of 1/2 salsa mixed with 1/2 sour cream.  delicious.

This is an AWESOME recipe. I didn't find it to be to dry as said in some of the other reviews. However I did do some things differently. I used my food processor. I put in my garlic, onion and I used frozen pepper stir fry (red, yellow, green pepper slices and onion slices- you can find them in the freezer section at the grocery) and a little cilantro. I blended that together first. Then I added everything else. I didn't use hot sauce.  I blended all the ingredients until they were all well incorporated. I then baked them a 400 degrees 15 min on each side. They were a hit!

For the past few years, I have been trying to cut back on the red meat and dairy products so when it comes to bean burgers I have tried them all. This was a new recipe and my dad just got a new grill, so I thought that I would go ahead and give these a shot to see if there was some way to get that restaurant quality black bean burger at home. 

I WAS NOT disappointed. This is by far the BEST veggie burger that I have ever had and WILL be at every family cookout from now on. It is not often that I go back in for seconds, but this was totally worth it. The only thing that I could suggest is to add some salt and pepper into the bread crumb mixture, or at least add them as a topping. Still, amazing burger and I would definitely recommend!

As someone who doesn't eat veggie burgers regularly, this recipe is super simple and easy to make and goes with a lot of different topping options. We topped ours with a corn salsa, guacamole, onions, tomato, a fried egg, jalapeno-muenster cheese, sriracha garlic chili paste, and sauteed jalapenos. This pairs well with the Quinoa and Black Beans recipe on this site.

My family really enjoys these veggie burgers.  I didn't have any problem with the burgers coming apart.  I didn't rinse the beans.  Instead I left them in a strainer for 10 minutes to get rid of the excess bean juice without losing too much of the flavor.  I also used my stick mixer to grind the black beans into a paste before I mixed everything else in.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

I've never been a fan of veggie burgers, but I have to admit I went for seconds after cooking this one! So simple and easy. I'll add some more spices next time, as it was a bit bland for my taste. My husband loved it though!  I followed another viewers advice and added more bread crumbs and they held together perfectly!

I'm not a vegetarian but we made these because we had all of the ingredients.  We used 2 eggs instead of 1. Used only a pinch of cumin and chili powder. And we used 3/4 cup of breadcrumbs. We baked them 10 mins on each side. Served on a light colored wheat bread. I highly recommend this recipe.

These turned out great.  I added some Worcestershire sauce and a dollop of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce to the mix.  Also, instead of baking, I cooked them in my cast iron skillet.  Wonderful!

Made these last minute without reading any reviews first, something I NEVER do! I sort of doubled the recipe: 2 cans beans, 1 c. (give or take as needed) plain bread crumbs, 1 sm-med onion, 2 xlg cloves garlic, 1/2 ea red & yellow peppers, 2-3 tbs olive oil, 2 eggs, 2 tsp cumin (plenty), 2 tbs chili powder, 2 tsp onion pwdr, 1 tsp garlic pwdr, 1 tsp salt. Chop onions, garlic, peppers in food processor; put aside in bowl, coarse chop rinsed beans in processor; add to bowl w/ veggies. Beat two eggs in a clean bowl, add spices, oo & beat well, add to beans & veggies. Mix in breadcrumbs 1/3 of a cup at time until the mixture is thick & will hold together well. I lightly oiled a non stick pizza pan, turning patties after 10 minutes then baking for an additional 10 at 375 as recommended. They came out really well, they held together perfectly & looked like beef burgers. I served them on home baked rolls, with spicy ketchup, diced tomatoes, cukes, & cabbage. Will make again!

Liked this recipe. It had good flavor. The main issue is the soft texture. Would like more of a "burger" texture so kids don't notice a difference. I will definitely make this again, but would like suggestions on the texture.

I have made this recipe 2-3 times just as written (almost-I put it all in the food processor, adding beans last) and it is just great! I can definitely see substituting other grains for the breadcrumbs, and I think adding other veggies or seasonings would be awesome as well!

Loved it!  I served it over sauteed red pepper, onion and sweet potato instead of on a bun.  The sweet potato balanced out the spices perfectly.  When making the veggie burger I added 1/2 tsp of paprika and 1 cup of power greens.

I highly recommend!

Good, no problems with them falling apart or anything, only change I made was that I didn't have a food processor so the veggies were a little bigger than they could have been

Was really excited to try this recipe.  Followed directions; however, as soon as I bit into it, all I tasted was black bean paste (and I had grilled onions and cheese on it).  It had no spicy flavor and was mushy.  I think I will try again and add whole black beans and up the spices.  It held together and cooked like a patty, so I have hope.

This turned out yummy! I added 1/4 cup corn, omitted the egg and seasoned with salt (not sure why that is missing from the recipe). Also halved the red chili and added half a jalapeno pepper. Baked it in the oven for the recommended time and YUMMMMY. super amazing

I'm stuffing my face with it now. This was such a great easy, fast, fun, cost effective and basic recipe! 

Next time, I will try it with corn, a little more egg or fewer bread crumbs, and a more spices for my taste since I prefer a robust flavor to my foods. I think I'll try cooking dried black beans for a really fresh change of pace! Lovely stuff, thanks!

Yummo! I sprinkled a little corn meal on the pan and it added a great crust. Not too much at all. They are really flavorful.

Used Roasted Red Pepper Triscuits as the bread crumbs.  Will probably use quinoa or brown rice next time...but this was delicious!  Definitely put the eggs in last so you can season to taste.  Baked for 10 minutes, made a scrumptious quesadilla filling with some shredded cheddar cheese added in.  Hub ate a burger as a side dish next day...wow!!

I LOVE this recipe!  It's by far the best & easiest veggie burger recipe I've tried, and I've been vegetarian for 20 years.  Most recipes have either been too bland, too spicy, too time consuming, or just don't work out (too dry, too mushy). I do not like spicy food but another reviewer mentioned she also didn't like spice- but said it was ok, so I decided to try it.  I stayed fairly close to the actual recipe.  I drained and rinsed the beans and then placed them between paper towels to squeeze out extra moisture.  I used a food processor for the green pepper, garlic and onion and then strained them and pressed between paper towel to reduce extra liquid.  I used 2 eggs instead of 1 (per another reviewer) and used closer to 2/3 cups of bread crumbs to make up for the extra egg.  I halfed the cumin and red pepper and omitted the hot sauce (too chicken to try all of it!).  Baked as directed on parchment paper to avoid the oil; 10 min per side.  Excellent!  They stayed together, tasted great and weren't spicy at all but were flavorful.  In fact, next time I make them (there will definitely be a next time) I will add more of the spices.  I made 5 patties about 1/2" thick the size that fits on the normal "cheap" store brand buns.  If you use the larger or bakery sized buns, you will probably get 4 patties.  Wrap extras, refridge then throw in the microwave for 1 minute, flip and add cheese-microwave for 20 more seconds.  Fast and fab quick meal on the go! Love it! Thanks 4 recipe!

I've made these several times and they always come out great!  I do end up baking them about twice as long (20 min each side) as is suggested in the original recipie.  I also tried turing the oven up to 400 which seemed to make 15 min per side work too.  Overall very tasty, and even enjoyed by non-vegetarians!

I decided to follow the recipe to the tee, although I thought there may have been too much cumin. I actually doubled the recipe so that I could freeze individual burgers to be used throughout the next couple weeks. I fried the fresh burger over Pam after immediately making the batch. It turned out better than expected but the cumin could have been a tad less. My 19 yr old agreed. Now wait! This being said, I froze the rest; took one out for lunch today, baked it, and OMG! The flavors had time to mix together and it IS the BEST black bean burger I have EVER had anywhere. The secret is being patient to let the flavors blend. Out of a 10, with 10 being the best, this burger is a 20!

These are delicious if you follow others advice to make sure the excess liquid is removed so you don't end up wih a mushy mess.  Pat the black beans dry after rinsing.  More importantly, after chopping the onion/pepper mixture, squeeze out the excess liquid with your hands.  There is a lot!    This is really the only mdification that I needed to make delicious, perfectly bound yet still moist patties.  I have also made it by adding zucchini and cilantro to the onion/pepper mixture, sauteeing some chopped onions and jalapenos to top and making a chipotle mayonnaise for the bun.  Delicious both ways!

Great recipe! I've made these a few times now, and I follow the other reviewers' tips for how to get the burgers to stick together better (add another egg and 50% more breadcrumbs). I also add in a small can of yellow corn (patted dry), half a small can of green chilis (sometimes I use that instead of the bell pepper, if I don't have the bell pepper on hand), about a teaspoon of chipotle Cholula sauce, and about a half teaspoon or so of salt. I've made the recipe as-is, however, and it's great! Everything I do is just extra.

Excellent.  I followed one reviewers advice and strained as much water out of the vegetables as possible.  Served with Chipotle mayo and slaw.

I like these, but not without alteration. I normally need to add more bread crumbs (Panko) and I always increase the heat with peppers (serranos or jalapenos in addition to the green pepper, plus a liberal amount of red pepper flakes). For the hot sauce, I use Huy Fong sri racha sauce (slightly more) and I probably add an extra garlic clove as well and some chili powder :). I like spicy food though..It does seem necessary to drain the excess water off the onion/pepper/garlic--add the garlic first because it needs the most blending. I also add more salt! Before adding the egg, I taste the veg/bread/bean mix...it needs more salt.

These were okay, everyone ate them and no one complained.... but not the best. I would definitely choose them over a frozen processed meatless burger though for sure. I felt like they just needed something else to make them fantastic.....

This is so simple to make vegan and gluten free. First I followed the recipe except for the eggs and bread crumbs; I replaced the egg with cooked quinoa and and replaced the bread crumbs with plain gluten free ones. I then put in basil, chives, turmeric, garlic and onion powder. I then made it slightly sticky and formed it in a patty and put it in the oven for about 15-20 minutes on 350. I then took it out and pan fried it in some olive oil. It stayed formed and had a crispy outside. Made some baked sweet potatoes and baked brussel sprouts as side dishes. just yummy

Delicious burgers! We used red bell peppers instead of green and also added mozzerella and tomato on top. They were wonderful! We baked them and they came out well. Next time we will try them on the grill. We will definitely make these all summer long.

Did the recipe with some of the recomendations listed, cooked the peppers and onion a little first, used dry beans instead of canned, rinsed and dried beans. used two eggs instead of one and grilled burgers on aluminum foil. They were a little too dry and a little too spicy for the kids. May try again but will not put as much spice and maybe less bread crumbs.

This is the BEST vegetarian burger recipe I have ever made. They held together beautifully!! I used an ice cream scoop and flattened the burgers slightly before baking them in the oven. The recipe made 7 burgers this way.

OMG so I have never tried black bean burgers in my life but was feeling a little adventurous and decided to try these! LOVED them - so did my meat-eating husband! I would seriously take this over a beef or turkey burger any day! It was definitely not too spicy and I loved the flavor! I used my Magic Bullet to almost puree the onion, green pepper and garlic cloves. I bought fresh rolls at the store and made fresh breadcrumbs out of one of the fresh rolls - super good! I read a bunch of the reviews and decided to make a quick chipotle mayo creation (mayonnaise, touch of ranch dressing, and some hot Mexican pepper powder from McCormick spices). I put tomato slices on it and it was AMAZING :) Will definitely be making these again and again!

Excellent and EASY burgers! I used one cup of Whole Wheat Oats instead of half a cup of Breadcrumbs. Your burgers will hold better. And definitely strain out all the water/liquid from your red pepper mix. ENJOY!

Easy to make. Edible, but definitely not great. Probably won't make again. They were a little bitter tasting. Probably would taste better with modifications.

I made the burgers as directed.  The only change I made was to rinse the beans and squeeze the water out of the pepper and onion.  The burgers were quite tasty but a bit dry.  I had no problem with them staying together.  However, I dont think these would hold up well on a grill.  Maybe next time I wont squeeze the water out of the veggies.  ***UPDATE***  I made these again but I did not squeeze the water out of the veggies and they were much better-not dry at all.  I baked at 400 for 25 minutes.

I used dried soaked black beans and then followed the recipe. I also found that the patties did not hold together. Very tasty, but I don't think this recipe is worth making a burger out of. If you used the same seasoning and added some sauteed corn and/or squash and put it in a tortilla this would have been 4.5 stars.

Excellent recipe just as written.  For superior results, go old school: soak dry beans overnight and simmer them yourself.  The texture and flavor surpasses canned beans.  Once you get the key technique down, variations of this recipe are almost endless.  Try different beans, binders, and spice combinations.  I always double the recipe, bake them in the oven (on release foil), eat some now, refrigerate and/or freeze the rest.  Once cooked, they stay together very well. They are even better reheated in a skillet with a touch of olive oil - it gives them a wonderful crunchy texture, or on the grill for a smoky flavor.  Thanks for sharing this outstanding simple recipe!

Delicious flavor! Texture was a little too smooth, so next time I won't mash the beans as much.

For next time, finish burgers on stove in frying pan with hot oil to get a crispy outside...kind of too soft for everyone.

Most of the family really enjoyed these (i have a picky 8 yr old).  I would add additional flavor next time though.  Recipe doesn't call for a separate salt-just the salt in the chili powder.  That wasn't enough.  Add salt.

Really good burgers!!  I added mushrooms, carrots, and anything else I had in the fridge.. I cut down the chili powder, but added a couple tablespoons of sweet thai chili sauce.  Ive made them twice now-- the second time i crumbled them up and used as taco meat!

These were very good! I actually thought that they were a bit dry, so next time, I may add a little bit of liquid of some sort. But they held together very well. Good recipe!

I love this recipe- makes for a great meal on the occasional nights that I don't want a meat-oriented dinner : ) I'll just make these along with some kind of rice side dish & a nice salad! I do follow other reviewers tips on how to keep them from falling apart though, they can be a bit crumbly if your not careful.

At first I thought adding so much spices would be crazy but no, it was just right! I added Creole Seasoning for the perfect kick instead of chili sauce. I also doubled the bread crumb suggestion and added 1/4 c rolled oats. Rinsed and dried my beans on a towel b4 mashing them as mentioned on previous posts. Topped it off with sauteed  mushrooms and the other half of the  pepper  when my burger was done.

This was delicious! Followed the recipe exactly except used red beans instead of black beans and it turned out perfect--no falling apart and not dry. Melted feta cheese over it and topped that with avocado, tomato, parsley, and spinach.

I want to make these into little bite-sized balls instead of patties and bake them in the oven to be served as an appetizer with crackers and chipotle mayo or sweet chili--that'd be to die for!

normal w/ hippy tendencies here...best bbb (black bean burger) i've ever had.  made a cpl successful adjustments.  opposed to food processer (didn't have) used juicer to process onion and gp, and added mush to mixture during bread crumb step.  toppings added: chipotle mayo, avacodo n homemade pico de gayo.  completed my version of this bbb. all in all can't b happier..n can't wait to experiment more.  -bd

This recipe was great, even my red meat loving husband gave them a 10 out of 10. I found that I ended up using 1.5 cups of rolled oats and 2 eggs and then froze the patties for around 10-15 minutes before cooking them and they stayed together great! I also added a dash of salt and pepper as well as a pinch of cilantro as suggested by other reviewers.  As is, I'm not sure these 'burgers' would stay together, hence the 4 stars out of 5. Otherwise - delish!

this recipe is a total winner!! i read the reviews beforehand, and agree with adding more breadcrumbs to hold the patties together. the addition of chili powder and cumin is stellar -- very tasty. i served these with guacamole, garlic mayo and salsa, a nice change from the regular ketchup/mustard/relish combo. i have to admit that i normally opt for meat to any veggie burger type dish, but this recipe has totally won me over. will definitely be making these again, and again...! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!! :)

These were great!  I'm not vegetarian but I'm trying to eat less meat for cost reasons.  I liked these way more than regular burgers (I don't especially like red meat).  The only thing I did was after running the veggies through my food processor, I spread the mixture on a cutting board and blotted it with paper towels to remove some of the water.  Next time will make a double batch a freeze for a quick dinner later on!

Excellent and I mean excellent flavor.   I did substitute an additional egg white for the yolk in the whole egg and used Panko breadcrumbs to help lower the total fat, cholesterol and calories.   

The only problem I had was the thickness of the 4 ounce burgers.   They held together fine, cooked well and looked fantastic.  But, the thickness caused it to compress when eaten, which caused it to slide out the other side of the bun.  Next time, I'll make 3oz burgers and make them a little thinner.  But, these are great.

I just made these for burgers as a main dish for company tonight.  They were a huge hit.  I tripled the recipe and cooked them on olive oil coated foil on the barbecue.  I had no problem with them sticking together.  I mixed the whole concoction up in my kitchen-aide (which is also how I mashed the beans) and doubled the amount of bread crumbs that the recipe calls for.  I put them out with traditional burger fixings (ketchup, pickles, lettuce, tomato etc) and everyone gobbled them right up.  Please note: it is VERY IMPORTANT to oil the foil that you cook them on :o)

This recipe is fantastic!  

I didn't have green bell pepper or thai chili sauce so I used salsa instead and added corn off of the cob from one ear and it was delicious.

the flavor of these burgers is phenomenally good---plenty of spice, a little heat, loads of taste!  mine came out a bit floppy, but i think that was because i was conservative with the bread crumbs;  next time i will add more to achieve a firmer burger---thank you for this recipe!!

Loved this recipe! made it last night for dinner and couldnt be happier with how it turned out. So much better than store bought veggie patties (which i hate) i added a 1/4 cup of cooked rice to it though and that made it so much better.it tastes phenomenal with barbeque sauce and cheddar cheese.I would also suggest pan frying it, it seems to dry out alittle in the oven

Yum! I really enjoyed these. My kids liked them too. I was way short on chili powder so I subbed curry for most of it. Otherwise I followed it close to exactly. I didn't dry off the beans as some suggested but I did "wring out" the onions and peppers and I used 3 eggs for my doubled recipe. I baked 4 and froze 4. I didn't have any chipotle mayo as some suggested using on top but I did put a little sour cream on it and I ate it bunless - it was a good low carb meal. Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  I did as others before me and drained the juice from the pepper and onions and didn't have a problem with the texture.  The patties were plenty sticky and our whole family loved them.  I added a couple dashes cayenne in lieu of the hot sauce and it was fabulous--definitely one for the recipe file.

These weren't bad, but I don't think they were fabulous.  As one reviewer said it reminded me of refried beans when you bit into it.  The flavour was nice though, I like the spice of it.  I put the veggies in a cheese cloth and wrung it out.  I also froze the patties, which I got 5 out of.  I topped it with fried mushrooms and onions and havarti cheese.  Like I said, they were good but not like screaming awesome.  I would like to try them with lentils myself, maybe it wouldn't have that refried bean consistancy to them then.

Exactly what I was looking for in a veggie burger! I made these according to the recipe and had no problems with the consistency. I did drain the excess water from the pepper/onion mixture and perhaps that helped. I put a slice of smoked guryere cheese on the last 3 minutes of baking. Served them on a whole wheat "sandwich thin" bun with lettuce, tomato and an avocado slice. Incredible and will definitely make again! Thank you!

Awesome, I had no problem with texture or consistency.  I agree that maybe 1/2 to 1 more egg would make it less dry, but slathered with all the fixins and it great.  My meat eating husband said is was way better then a fast food burger he had for lunch. :)  I skipped the bell pepper and halved the chili powder, but I now think it would have been fine.  I like the idea someone had of adding brown rice or grains to give is even better texture (less paste like).  I will absolutely make again!

These weren't as good as the store-bought ones, but they are WAY less expensive, so I can deal. I just made them for the first time, and think that with some tweaking they can be made even better. I did not have an issue with them holding together. I did as suggested and drained and rinsed the beans thoroughly while I got the other ingredients ready. I omitted the green pepper because I didn't have any on hand, and I added a packet of oatmeal into the mix as well as the bread crumbs as a binder. I would have liked a little more spice, but that's a personal thing. By the time I topped the patty with a slice of low-fat cheese and some salsa, it was pretty good., I will definitely make them again, and try experimenting with the flavors some.

I love veggie burgers but hate to pay close to a dollar a burger at the store so finally I decided to try to make my own. They came out great. I made two modifications to the recipe posted here. I ran out of chili powder so I used hot paprika instead. I had some leftover cooked quinoa so I used that for about half the bread crumbs. Oh and I also threw in a handful of corn as well. I baked my burgers in a 375 oven for about 25 minutes. I got about 6 patties.

Okay, but I was surprised how bland they turned out considering all the spices that went in. I will definitely try this again but next time I'll try adding a fresh chopped hot pepper or maybe add chopped chipotle in adobo sauce. I will also use normal black beans - I had low sodium this time and that might have been part of the blandness. I baked them in the oven and they held together pretty well. Per other reviews, I added about 1/2 C corn and used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs.

I am going to give these 3 stars for now, but I'm not giving up. The flavor was delicious and the ingredients so healthy, but ours were just too wet inside. I will try again and maybe try other reviews to strain moisture from veggies or I might try to double all ingredients but still use 1 egg- somehow I have to get the moisture down. But I will definitely try again because if I figure out the trick then this will definitely be a 5 star recipe.

These are great and soooo EASY! I used one egg and  1/2 cup of brown rice and 1/2 cup of bread crumbs. I also added more garlic and some fresh jalepenos. Had them in the oven for 10 mins on each side and put them stovetop to get that nice crisp outer edge. Enjoy!

No one in the family is a vegetarian, but we try to eat healthy...yum yum yum! I love these. I make them exactly as written, and it makes 4 huge burgers. I top with pepperjack cheese, lettuce, and chipotle mayo. They are so much tastier and healthier than beef burgers.

The first time I made these I followed the advice of other reviewers and squeezed the water from the pepper and onion and dried the beans off.  The taste was good but my boyfriend and I both found the burgers a bit dry.  The second time around I left them alone and just added an extra egg white and refrigerated them overnight before panfrying in canola.  DELICIOUS!  NOTE: I didn't have hot sauce or bread crumbs, so I just used black pepper and quick oats.  I also used fresh black beans instead of canned.

Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly, and they were delicious! I baked them as directed, but I think I might add a few minutes next time, along with a bit more breadcrumbs. I just devoured one and it was fantastic. I will probably keep one out for dinner for me since DH will not be here, and I will try freezing the rest. First time I made veggie burgers, and the ingredients were so simple!  Love it, thank you so much.

Due to a new dietary restriction I decided to try these.  I, like other reviewers, had to double the bread crumbs also. I used red bell peppers since I didn't have any green bell peppers. I also forgot to add the chili sauce and they are still AWESOME.  I suggest grilling rather than baking. The baking just didn't work out well @ all and they were falling apart. I ended up moving them to the grill (on lightly greased foil) and they came out PERFECT. I doubled the recipe and 1/2 of them are pre-freezing right now. I think that will also make a huge difference.  I was scared there would be too much cumin & chili powder, but it was again, perfect. Love this recipe! Definite keeper and much better than Boca burgers.

Absolutely delicious!  Im new to the veggie burger world and these are great.  I prefer these over hamburger meat.  I made mine a bit lower in calories by using 2 egg whites instead of the egg and 1/2 cup oats instead of the breadcrumbs.  For the oats put them in a blender and grind them up before adding to the burgers.  Helps keep them together better and then you arent eating big pieces of oats in your burger!  I also listened to the reviews and made sure to absorb as much water from the onion, pepper and beans.  I havent had any problem keeping the burgers held together. Great recipe!

I wanted to give this 2 stars but I'll give it 3 because I'm not too familiar with veggie burgers so I'm not sure how they are supposed to taste. The burger overall held together pretty well and had a nice texture but I did not care for the flavor at all.  Chili powder and hot sauce?? The flavors in this burger did not taste good eaten in a bun....it tasted like it should be put in a tortilla wrap with some rice and cheese.

These burgers are my favorite and we eat them at least once a week and we're still not tired of them!  I don't put bell pepper in it because I don't like it, but I do add in some jalapenos and then top with avocado and blue cheese.  SO Good!  10 stars for us!

This recipe is awesome. I did add an extra egg and "baked" them in the oven. My husband probably wouldn't like it, just because it wasn't  meat,but I thought it was great and will definitely make them again.

This was not to my liking - I really think it should be called a "black bean patty" versus a "burger". The texture was mushy and it overwhelmingly tasted of the canned black beans.

Excellent! Taste & texture are great.  I made these in the broiler with some Cajun-seasoned sweet potato fries (also broiled).  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and kept the beans, onion and pepper as dry as I could and I had no problems with them falling apart.  I used paper towels to squeeze the ingredients dry.  I topped them with some pepper jack & cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, and sliced jalapenos (good if you like it hot). I also made a small amount of cajun light mayo (1/4 cup of light mayo + 1/2 tsp cajun seasoning) and used that on the toasted buns.

This was a good alternative to hamburgers. I decreased all the spices for the kidlets but next time I might just use all the spices. Served it with cheese and mayo/mustard/ketchup. Husband even ate 2 of them.

SOOOO good! I don't own a food processor, so I diced everything up really well, and they didn't fall apart at all! Only thing is next time I'll add a bit more chili sauce because they weren't quite as spicy as I'd hoped.

Great flavor! Even my carnivorous fiance liked these very much. Only changes I made were to use yellow bell pepper instead of green and only used 2 cloves of garlic. I also added a little finely chopped jalapeno to half the burgers. Very good, will make again. Thank you :)

Delicious-- I used quick oats that had been put through a food processor instead of bread crumbs and the texture was perfect. These are a definite repeat, but I may add more spice next time.

You know how some make Bean Burgers...others make Mushroom Burgers?  This is a GREAT burger as is. I added some diced Shitake mushrooms to the 'cuisinarted' mix. I used a little bit of Black Bean Sauce and Hot Garlic-Chili Sauce. Since I doubled the recipe, I only used 1 Tablespoon of Chili Powder. I used Garlic Herb bread crumbs...adding to achieve the desired texture. I baked mine as suggested, flipping after 10 minutes. I still like my ground chicken or turkey burgers (no beef), but this is a professional burger.  I'm not clever enough or inclined to add some fancy fruit topping, but it might be ok too. I got 10 burgers out of doubling it, adding mushrooms and additional bread crumbs. They're still pretty fragile after all that...break up easily if you're not careful.

This is a GREAT recipe. It was quick, easy, and so flavorful! I used an extra half cup or so of breadcrumbs to get it to stick together better. We froze the other two and I'm looking forward to seeing how they do when we heat them up.

They are all right, VERY beanie! But unlike other reviews the breadcrumbs and two eggs helped binge mine together just fine.

I have tried all of the "stick together" tricks. They still don't stick together. I've made them 3 times and I guess it's not the charm. Never making them again.

These were smaller than I expected so I only made three patties instead of four.  I should of increased the baking time, but didn't think of it.  Maybe then the texture would have been more tolerable. .

I was lazy and didn't want to wash the Cuisinart, so I minced the bell pepper and onion by hand. Upped the garlic to 6 cloves and grated it. 
Cut the chili powder to 2 t. and substituted oatmeal for the breadcrumbs, then let the mixture set overnight in the fridge. I cooked these in a George Foreman grill for about 6-7 minutes and they came out perfect. Very, very good. Thanks!

THe taste was great, even my meat loving boyfriend enjoyed these. However, I do suggest freezing the burgers before grilling so that they stay together, and adding a bit more bread crumbs then what the recipe calls for.

My whole family loved these burgers- they were awesome.  I used black beans and rolled oatmeal instead of the bread crumbs.  I also broil them for the last 2 minutes.
We are starting to eat least meat and this is one recipe I will continue to use.
Thanks!!!

Fantastic!
Added a little bit of cilantro and went easy on the green pepper. Did add some jalapeno peppers to the mix. Also, just put everything in food processor and it turned out fine and was one less step.
GREAT!!!!!!

Was looking for a good recipe that satisfied my spouse & vegetarian child.  THIS IS IT! I  took the tips of other reviewers, cut back on the cumin & froze them (made 4 healthy portions.)  Cooked in a cast iron skilet w/ little canola oil, toasted buns & served w/ lettuce, tomato, onion & homemade guacamole & spicy oven fried potato wedges. An easy, tasty, filling keeper.  Many Thanks

I loved this recipe. I sauteed the onion and garlic before adding them to the beans and put in twice as many bread crumbs and it didn't fall apart at all.

This was easy, fast, and very good.  The patty is a bit on the soft side or maybe squishy is a better word.  I personally did not mind that at all.

We are not vegetarian but were looking for something healthier than traditional burgers, and these were great.  I froze them which helped them hold together.  I also broiled them instead of baking/grilling, and that seemed to work well.

Excellent!  I will never buy another frozen veggie burger. I skipped the chili powder and cumin, I used egg beaters, added carrots and a little salt.  I baked them and they were heavenly!

I really enjoyed these burgers.  I improvised a lot, though, just because I didn't have everything in the recipe.  I didn't use onions or green peppers but added more garlic than it called for.  Mine did not fall apart in the pan, but that could be because I halved the recipe but still used an entire egg and added bread crumbs until it stuck together.  It made them very moist.  I fried them on the stove top in some olive oil and topped them with swiss cheese.  Yum!

These were great.  My husband and I really enjoyed my first try at veggie burgers!  I think next time, I won't mash the black beans as much and leave the onions and green peppers a bit larger so there is more "crunch" to the burger, but YUMMY!  And I got 5 good sized patties out of the recipe.

Agreed -- they are hard to keep in one piece, but have great flavor and are quite easy.  Next time I think I'll refrigerate the mix for a while before baking ... hopefully that will help.

I hate these kind of reviews, but I almost always make changes, based on what I have on hand, and what I think will work. 

 I added about 1/4 cup chopped veggies to burger mix, as well as about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs. 

Formed them into patties, and refrigerated for several hours. Placed in skillet with a bit of oil, and fried for several minutes on a side. Topped with cheese & we devoured them.  I didn't think I missed the taste of meat until I realized these tasted like a really good hamburger. 

Thank you for this recipe.  I'm getting ready to make two more batches, one for tonight, and one for the freezer.

They held together really well, and were so good, I immediately made another batch & froze them. Defrosted one evening for a few mintues, then fried & tasted as good as before.  

Making them yet again tonight.  Thank you for this recipe.

Followed recipe, drained, rinsed and dried beans before  mashing lightly with ricer. Used a fresh chile pepper instead of green pepper. Use whole oats instead of bread crumbs.Made patties and refrigerated. Lightly coated with masa and fried in small amount of canola oil...Browned nicely and a bit crispy around the edges...I keeper for sure.

I'm a meat guy. I want meat wrapped around other meat and a side of bacon and cheese. I say this because I have a bias and vegetarian isn't typical for me. Having never made a veggie burger I was quite nervous about all the reviews and difficulties normally experienced when people attempt them. The instructions here produce really good results. The seasoning, although simple, gives a good smell and flavor to the patties. The only mod I made was using quick oats in place of bread crumbs because I didn't have any onhand. I squeezed out the moisture (a ton which likely leads to people's problems) from the onion and bell pepper after the food processor. Adding the seasoning and thai paste to the egg is brilliant because it ensures an even distribution in the patties. The patties held together great and had the texture of refried beans from the can. I wrapped in plastic wrap and froze and followed the cooking instructions as written on the grill. The last minute I topped with pepper jack which complimented well. My wife absolutely loved the burgers but being more of a meat person, I was disappointed in the size of the patty initially. It makes 4x 1/4" patties which is pretty thin. I would rather have made 2 patties or even maybe one. Being thin resulted in pretty crispy which is not similar to a meat burger I would want. For those reasons I can only give four stars. That being said, I will definitely make these again.

Made this with a can of mixed beans. I think people's problems with it being too sticky are just because it's been over-worked. I just mashed the ingredients together (I didn't use a processor at all) and that gave the perfect consistency. I also used only a teaspoon of cumin and a bit of fresh thyme too. Because the mix was slightly chunkier than if I'd have used a processor, the burgers get nice and juicy when they're cooking.

I have made these so many times!  I cut the cumin to 1 teaspoon,  added 1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke, 2 tablespoons tomato paste and increased the bread crumbs to 3/4 cups.  I got 6 nice sized patties.   I freeze them  on a cookie sheet, then place each in sandwich baggies until I need!

I made this gluten free by replacing the bread crumbs with quick oats and I made it vegan by using one Ener-G egg and also adding a couple tablespoons of besan (chickpea flour) and flaxseed meal.
I also used a mix of lentils and frozen peas instead of black beans.
The burgers came out very good, not mushy, after baking.
I don't think the recipe really makes 4 servings.  I doubled the recipe and made 5 large burgers and ate 4 of them in one sitting, but I'm a big guy.

These were really tasty! I just did everything in the food processor and saved some whole black beans to mix in at the end. Next time I think I will add corn or use some different kinds of peppers, but these were really good as is. These are definitely going to be added to the regular rotation.

Ridiculously good! These are incredibly tasty and so easy to make! I love the spices, so I definitely didn't skimp on those. I did add 1/2 TSP salt and I used Sirachi chili sauce. I didn't use green peppers because I didn't have any on-hand. If you like spicy black bean burgers, you have to try this recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and dried the beans before mashing them. Quickly gobbled up one and then froze the rest. This recipe makes four burgers.

Good consistency.  I followed the recipe exactly and put on the non-stick foil on a cookie sheet in the oven.  A fresh slice of tomato and avocado on a Publix deli wheat bun was the crowning glory.  Served it with homemade white queso dip - a winning combo!

I've only tried frozen veggie burgers once, back in high school, and after that horrible experience I never thought about them again.  Until stumbling upon this recipe and finding I had all of the ingredients!

So glad I tried it!  They were absolutely perfect for me.

I drained the beans, but didn't rinse them, added red bell pepper, and a little extra sriracha.  I actually put in a little less breadcrumbs than the recipe called for.  I also don't have a food processor or anything to mash with, so I just minced the veggies as best I could and mixed it up with my hands :)

I'm surprised everyone had a hard time with them falling apart...I was worried from reading all the reviews but they ended up being the perfect consistency!

We loved this recipe!  I finely chopped my pepper and onion then squeezed out their water because I hate cleaning my food processor.  The black beans I used were low sodium, so I needed to add a little salt to really bring out the flavors.  Great recipe and an awesome alternative for my burger loving family!

Feeding a house full of picky vegetarians isn't easy. These are absolutely fantastic! I made sure everything is dry dry dry before putting together. We like ours a bit spicier so I usually add more spices. Sometimes I'll add in a few beans still whole, corn (patted dry), fresh jalapenos (patted dry), red bell pepper (patted dry). You can mix it up with any combo of your favorites just make sure they're patted dry. YUMMY!

I'm a carnivore, but I've been trying so hard to eat healthier and add veggies and legumes into my diet. I'm not too fond of legumes, but this recipe sounded tasty. I made them two nights ago and we all enjoyed it! Nothing fell apart, they make awesome burrito filling (courtesy of one of my sisters), and they freeze well too. I took a couple of them to work to give as samples for my boss and one of my coworkers (a waitress who's a vegetarian), and he said this will be perfect for one of our future vegetarian meals for our residents. We also happen to have a resident who's a vegetarian, so we'll keep this recipe on hand for her. This also saves the expense of the store-bought vegan burgers. Give this recipe a go!

delicious delicious delicious. I'm not a vegetarian, but am trying to eat less meat, and this kind of recipe makes it easy. I took other reviews into consideration and did the following: cut the chile to 1/2 a tbsp of chile powder (infant and toddler were eating), used 1/2 a green pepper and 1/2 a red pepper. After putting that with rest of ingredients in the food processor, I put the beans in separately and gave them a mushing. I used a paper towel to soak up the excess fluid. I used 1 whole egg + 1 yolk and kept everything else the same. The burgers kept their shape perfectly. I also broiled them for 8 min/side and they were superb.

Better than store bought...I put EVERYTHING in the blender attachment...used this recipe as a base...added org. egg whites to bind, chopped garlic & onion, carrot slivers, found leftover panko crumbs & tossed those in - eliminated the green pepper & Thai sauce (didn't have any).  I coated pan with olive oil spray and let cook on each side until browned lightly - about 20 minutes in all.  My 15 oz can of black beans yielded 3 nice size patties for about $1. for all - total cost...That's a big savings.  This recipe is a good base for anything else you might want to add.   Tasted delish!

If you like black beans you'll love these burgers. I sautéed the garlic, onion and green pepper in a little olive oil to make sure they wouldn't  be crunchy but that's the only thing I did differently. Yummy!

So delicious! Taking hints from previous reviews, I knew that my can of beans would make the mixture a bit runny, so I cooked up about a cup of red lentils and added that to the mix. I used Ritz (approx. 1 cup) instead of bread crumbs. This is definitely a great and flexible recipe, depending on which fresh ingredients you have on hand!

I'd give the appearance an A+ and the taste a C+. They didn't stick to the baking sheet and browned up nicely without falling apart when I flipped them and came out looking like nice burgers. The taste was ok, flavor is pretty good really but they lacked in the texture department. It really felt like eating mashed bean paste in a bun because that's what it was. Next time I make these i'm going to cut back on the beans, finely chop and sautee some mushrooms and add some cooked bulgar too. I think these things would add some much needed toothsomeness to the burgers.

Love this recipe.  So easy and delicious.  I make a vegan version by substituting the egg and breadcrumbs with oatmeal made from steel cut oats. Mix enough in and it binds the ingredients brilliantly.

Loved this recipe - I added a small beet to the mixture - overall very good, can't wait to have them again - I made 6 patties instead of 4 since we don't like burgers too thick. Will for sure make them again.

OMG. I do have to say I really liked this burger! I am a meat eater all the way and this is the 1st veggie burger i have EVER had. I just wanted to try something different and this was a homerun. 
After draining and washing the bean i dry them as others suggested. I used sweet Thai chili sauce and 1 tbs of BBQ sauce. I also added a little more bread crumbs than what was called for. Formed the patties (4) and placed them in the fridge for 1 hr before cooking in the oven. Served on a kaiser roll with pepper jack cheese, tomato, spinach, sauteed red onions, mayo and ketchup with a side of Ore-Ida Crispy fries ( made in toaster oven). This Veggie burger is a winner!

The burger gets those two stars only because it was relatively healthy. Besides that I didn't like any aspect of it. My father and I followed the recipe exactly whilst making this, and the burgers were very mushy and fell apart while we flipped (or tried to, in this case) them and put them onto our burger buns. They were very mushy and gooey, even after we left them in the oven for an extended period of time to try and counteract this. The burger also had no flavor whatsoever. I had to douse mine in condiments to get any sort of flavor (mustard flavored mush, ooh, yum). While I was eating this, I DID in fact wish I was eating store-bought frozen burgers. They had so much more flavor and were actually healthier than these. Morningstar products, here I come.

I made this exactly as is. The burgers were tasty. They had a black bean taste to them. We will probably make them again with sweet corn added. Over all a good recipe just not what we were expecting.Very easy to make!Thanks.

I followed the recipe exactly and the "burgers" were perfect. I am not a spicy food person but these were quite nice. My husband and I are trying to cut down on our meat consumption and this recipe will definitely be included in our diet.

After reading reviews, I only used 1 tsp cumin, used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs, & added salt. I also squeezed the onion/green pepper through a sieve, & laid the beans out on a baking sheet & dried them with paper towels. I chopped the beans separately using my food processor to get the consistency I wanted, then mixed all the ingredients together.
Also, I cooked a small 'test' burger using a pan with a tiny amount of EVVO, glad I did because I knew it needed salt.

Making the recipe as is is completely disgusting!  Tastes like you're eating straight cumin from the jar!

I really loved these. I pressed out the extra moisture, shaped them into patties and froze them until I cooked them. They were delicious

This was our first veggie burger, and probably our last.  I guess we're beef people.

My whole family devoured these, even my picky teenager. I altered it a bit to make more. I used 2 cans of black beans, 2 eggs, 1 cup of breadcrumbs and half a can of corn. I had no trouble shaping the patties. I then refrigerated them for a couple of hours. I proceeded to bake them as directed but also "fried" them in a pan using Pam spray before serving to crisp them up. Inexpensive, simple and delicious! Made 10 patties.

These are very good.  I used 3/4 cup bread crumbs per some reviews, and found the mixture too dry, so I added a second egg.  I cooked  beans to use for this rather than using canned, which may account for the difference in moisture.  We froze the patties and cooked them on the stovetop from frozen and served them on homemade buns.  My daughter loves them as is. I'll change the seasonings and add some grated carrot and diced celery for a different taste in the next batch.

This is a great burger! I had no trouble keeping the patties together. I dried the onion/pepper mixture as much as possible like another reviewer said. I did not measure the breadcrumbs and just added them until I got a consistency that would hold together. I also added a jalapeno because the sriracha was just not making it hot enough for me. I usually make 8 patties at a time and freeze them!

Great recipe. I hadn't had a black bean burger in ages - used to visit this place in Seattle during my university years and have black bean burgers !! They were the best. This recipe reminds me of those burgers. I also used oats instead of bread crumbs.

I thought the onion was overpowering, and it lacked depth in flavor.  Maybe salt and pepper, and less cumin would have helped.

Amazing!  Thanks!  I just did a few things different as I did not have all the ingred.  Instead of egg, I put in a couple squirts of mayo, added some salt, used garlic powder in stead of fresh.  I wish I would have put corn in, but didnt have.  Also.. added a couple tablesoons of green salsa as I didnt have pepper on hand.

Excellent! I questioned the quantity of cumin and chili powder; however it was perfect!  I placed the first four ingredients in a food processor and then followed the remainder of the recipe instructions.

Great recipe and YUMMY!  I used two cans of black beans (instead of one) and rinsed them.  Mine were perfect and did not fall apart. I kept everything else on the recipe the same and they turned out awesome!

These burgers are great! Made 2 servings instead of 4 as theres only 2 of us but have plans in the future of just freezing the other two burgers.

Added red quinoa and instead of using a food processor we just minced the vegetables with a knife. Noticed it could use a little extra moisture as they were a little dry.

Also finished them in a pan with a little olive oil and melted bocchini ontop.

I was looking for a black bean burger recipe and this one is out of bounds!  In reading the reviews, I adjusted the recipe some....I reduced both the cumin and chili power to 1 t., I added a dash  of salt, only used the egg yolk, a dash of Worchestershire sauce and used ground oatmeal as a "breadcrumb."  It came together perfectly!  I simply sautéed the burger in a small amount of olive oil, and served the burger on a sprouted wheat tortilla with sliced avocado and tomato.  Simply fabulous!

These are excellent - I've made them exactly as is, many times.  I usually double it and freeze half of them.  They thaw and heat up well in the mircrowave.

I made the burgers based mainly on the reviews that I read of this recipe, therefore: used 1/2 cup oats instead of breadcrumbs, should've used 1 cup to make burgers denser, used flax seed eggs, added shredded carrots, and shredded pumpkin for added moisture,added worcestershire sauce,crushed chilli peppers, cayenne pepper (should've used 1/2tbsp, instead of 1tbsp, it's really spicy), Italian seasoning and 1tsp cumin. I processed the pepper,onion & garlic in food processor ,then sauteed them with the veggies. I also used dried beans which I cooked myself, next time I'll cook them longer to get a more meaty texture. I made sure to refrigerate burgers for almost an hour before baking and baked them 20mins per side for a crunchier crust. 
I froze the extras, and they tasted much better reheated .Overall i liked these burgers , even though I like non-vegan/vegetarian burgers better.
 I don't know how these compare to store bought veggie burgers , since I've never had those.

i like the base but it is over seasoned with cumin.  it should be noted that one really needs to drain their onion/pepper mixture of all water and let the beans dry.  more bread crumbs could be used too if your having problems with water as i did although i did strain the veggies.

we tried this recipe and it is one of the better vegetarian burger formulas we've had to date. i do wonder if the amount of chile powder and cumin is mistaken. Instead of a tablespoon, I used only a teaspoon (for serving of four burgers) and it turned out great. I think the stated tablespoon may be a typo...

A little bland for my taste and so I would add a chipotle pepper or more seasonings and reduce cumin.  I added brown rice to make it more substantial and hold together better as well as a little more bread crumbs (1/4 cup). A good base recipe to start with but modify to your taste.

Love these. We have baked, grilled and fried them, and have never had a problem with them falling apart. Use the bottom of a cup or some other solid object to smash the beans. Using a fork was always such a chore, and this method has made it SO much easier. Enjoy!

PANKO BREAD CRUMBS. Seriously. I followed this recipe exactly, except I used plain panko bread crumbs and I did not have one problem. Served them with some Green Mountain Salsa (all natural!) and avocado slices. Best recipe I have found on here because I haven't had to alter it much, which I tend to do.

LOVE this one. Made it exactly as it says to and they turned out perfect. My husband and I recently chose to stop eating meat and are looking for vegetarian options. This one will probably be a weekly staple.

These are great. The only modification was to use 2 tablespoons of flaxseed mill and a 1/2 cup of water, let this sit while you prepare the other ingredients for the burgers. I poured off the excess water  from flax mixture and used the remains as an egg subsitute. I also used Panko Bread Crumbs. The burger mixture was then dumped onto parchment paper. I put another piece on top and patted it down to the desired burger depth. I then used a glass to cut out the burgers. The burgers held together beautifully.  I transfered them via a spatula to a hot, lighly greased, nonstick frying pan. My meat eating husband even liked them. A hugh success.

Made these exactly to recipe, making sure I rinsed and dried the beans very well. After we made them into patties, we put them in our panini maker and crisped them up. Very good, looking forward to adding various things to the base, maybe some avocado and water chestnuts.

Great flavor, I didn't even miss the meat!  I used 1/2 green pepper & 1/2 red pepper and left out the hot sauce because I didn't have any.  I also didn't have any bread crumbs, so I finely ground up 1 cup of old-fashioned oats.  After forming the burgers, I placed them in the freezer a few hours before cooking them.  They held together perfectly and were absolutely delicious!  I will definitely be making these again!

So I love veggie burgers, but have never had/made black bean burgers and these were delicious. I didn't have a bell pepper, so I substituted some celery, carrots and parsley for that. I omitted the hot sauce because I didn't have any & cut the chili & cumin powders to 2 tsp each.

I mashed the beans by hands, added the veggies (chopped in a chopper), then the egg/spice mix and then panko breadcrumbs. I made 5 patties, but you could make 6. Baked them in the oven. I ate mine by itself with a ketchup & olive oil mayo mix. 

I will definitely be making these again and experimenting more with different spices and veggies. My new favorite meal. :)

Delish!!! Cut calories: the recipe calls for two eggs but I only used the egg whites and it worked just fine. I used paprika instead of cumin, I like my food spicy. I didn't tell my husband they were veggie burgers and he believed they were regular burgers until I told him the truth! We had a delicious diner I would do them again anytime.

i tried to make this exactly as written, but it was just too goopy, even having patted the beans dry. i didn't have more bread crumbs, so i added 1 cup of crushed rolled oats and 1/4 cup crushed almonds. i baked them for 8 minutes on each side and then browned them for two minutes each side in olive oil on the stove. served on a bun with chipotle mayo that another reviewer suggested. delicious and great texture with those additions, but they were almost soupy before!

This recipe was excellent.  I have been looking for a good black bean burger recipe that my meatatarian boyfriend and I will both like and this is the one. 

I made a few modifications on purpose and one out of necessity.  On purpose, I subbed cumin for 1/2 TBSP of smoked paprika and 1/2 TBSP curry powder based on other recipe my boyfriend and I have both enjoyed.  We found that seasoning combination worked well here. 

On purpose, I omitted the onion and used sour cream and onion crackers for the bread crumbs.  That gave a nice but subtle onion flavor that will likely please non-onion eaters. 

Out of necessity, I omitted the egg. I did not have one on hand and did not want to wait. The mix stayed together ok considering, but I bet adding an egg will help. 

I had sweet potato fries in the oven at 425 degrees so I fried the patties in a non-stick skillet with a little olive oil.  They took about 5 minutes a side to get browned and lightly crisp, but I think they could have gone longer to taste. I needed two spatulas to get them out of the pan without breaking them (again, the egg would probably fix that), but all four made it to the plates intact. 

The final product was so good my boyfriend and I each ate two patties, wrapped in leaf lettuce with melted jack cheese and tomato slices.  They did not even require condiments. I might make them again tonight...

I may try a few other variations.  If they are as good or better, I will post.

This is such a great recipe. I've made these SEVERAL times throughout the summer and always enjoy! 
Very filling as well. We really like them topped with chipotle mayo, cucumber slices and lettuce.

I just finished a batch.  Total weight was 13 ounces.  I made 5 patties.  The box of 4 B*c@ burgers weighs 10 ounces.  It cost about $4.  Hum, 79 cents for a can of black beans on sale.  And what's half an onion and half a bell pepper cost?  Another 50 cents?  For egg beaters, say 25 cents which I call the cost of bread crumbs and flavorings to boot.  Hum $1.54 for 5 burgers.  I'm liking this recipe without ever taking a bite.  Thirty-one cents vs $1 per burger.  Whoo-hoo!

Love that this is a very flexible recipe.  I usually add brocholi and carrots in this receipe.  I've also used corn, cauliflower and avacado....what ever veggies I have on hand.  I put all veggies, onion, and garlic (we don't care for the bell peppers) in the food processor and it does a great job of chopping and blending.  I put those in a bowl while I put the black beans in the food processor.  I add that to the bowl, then add my eggs, seasonings, bread crumbs and buffalo wing sauce (in place of chili sauce).  We have formed the mixture into patties, "hot dogs", and "meatballs".  My son hardly ever eats McDonald's as he prefers these bean burgers.  I always make a batch using about 3 or 4 cans of black beans.  One of our favorite receipes.

I used this as the base recipe and twisted it up using other users suggestions and a little flavor. Runny/won't stick together? Strain the veggies after you put them through the food processor. You can do this in a strainer or, even better, a cloth towel/cheese cloth. If you have ever made tzatziki you know what I'm talking about! You must add cilantro to the veggies when you chop them in the food processor! The flavor adds that extra kick that many that posted on this recipe are looking for. I used 1 bunch for a double batch. Also add kosher salt and fresh ground pepper! This is a must! I doubled this recipe for the family and acutally still left the 1 tbsp cumin/chili powder and 1 tsp hotsauce (used Yucateca habenero hot sauce) the same and the flavor was good.

Great flavor on these. Pan fried these, had to be careful with them so they wouldn't fall apart. Will probably take the suggestion to freeze next time. Will also saute onions & peppers before mixing in.

These were good but I did have the problem with them coming apart. The second time I made them I put the mix in the fridge for about an hour before I made patties.

These were good once topped for burgers but rather bland on their own.  we grilled ours but i think I may bake them next time.  ours still a little "smoochy" in middle which threw me off texture wise but I may have over chopped my veggies.  will try again and see if I can do better.

Easy to make and pretty tasty but next time I will add salt and pepper.  I chilled the burgers before cooking which held them together a bit.  Next time I will pan fry in a little canola oil and then finish them in the oven.  That should help hold them together and give them a bit of crunch.

These are pretty good burgers. I have never made a veggie burger before so I have nothing to compare it to however I will make these again. My family wanted the recipe and I know it's tons better for us than a big chunk of red meat. This is going to fit nicely into my new healty lifestyle. I did follow others suggestions and drained everything as much as possible before adding it all together, I also tried to freeze them before grilling them but didn't have enough time to make much of a difference. It was tough to grill on foil, I may try to bake them next time. Another thing that differs from red meat is that these dont shrink when cooked. I made them rather large thinking they would get smaller. They were better than I expected. Thanks for the recipe!

delish!  i chose to use 2 eggs and increase the breadcrumbs by 50% in oreder to help them hold together, after reading many of the reviews.   i did not have problems with them falling apart, however they were a little mushy which i attribute to the extra breadcrumbs.  In terms of seasoning, i thought this recipe was right on - it has a delicious southwestern flair that i really enjoyed.  granted no one else in the family would eat this, so i have lots of leftovers, but i intend to freeze them and take them with me to work for lunch.  this was my first attempt at homemade veggie or bean burgers, and i thought they were very simple to make and also very flavorful. thanks!

These were my first try at a veggie burger and I can honestly say I liked them MORE than real burgers.  The seasonings was just right.  Mine held their shape and I made them into 4, rather than 5 burgers.  Thanks for the recipe!

Soo good! I couldn't find my food processor so I just cut the veggies by hand and it was amazing. It just gave these burgers a really healthy feel with all of the onion and green pepper jutting out of the black bean part.

Amazing! I took the advice of one reviewer and drained the onions and peppers and added more breadcrumbs and they held their shape perfectly! Even my non-vegetarian fiancé loved them. I'll definitely be making these again and again!

So mine were totally wet. But they tasted awesome.  I should really have read more reviews to figure out how to keep them together. I am gluten free and vegan. So I used 1/2C All Purpose GF flour in lieu of the bread crumbs. I also used egg replacer. That worked just fine as well. In the end I had a GF vegan veggie burger that was fantastic. What I'll do different next time: Add 1/2C more flour, rinse, drain and dry black beans. And, strain garlic onion bell pepper mix to weed out extra moisture.

These burgers are wonderful and very easy to customize. Rather than bread crumbs you can use rolled oats. I just pulse the oatmeal in a food processor for about 5 seconds.

Wow! I was a bit sceptical when I mashed the beans and mixed the rest of the ingredients, but they turned out terrific! To ensure equal portioning, I used 1/2 cup mixture for each patty and had enough leftover for a 5th, smaller patty.  They are so good, it was hard to stop at only one.

I didn't have thai chili sauce or hot sauce so I added red pepper flakes. I added corn to it too. This was the first time I've ever had a veggie burger and I will be making these again very soon! Yum!

I am eating one of these right now & its delicious! Will def repeat. As far as getting them to stay together I had no problems I simply grated the onion, finely chopped the green pepper and used a garlic paste. Also as other users suggested I used a little more than double the bread crumbs if you cook veg food often you know you have to eyeball the bread crumbs it doesn't compromise the flavor at all! I was curious as to whether or not frying vs. Baking had any difference in them staying together so I fried half my batch and baked half both stayed together perfectly!

Delicious!

-replaced bell pepper w/ corn
-rinsed beans and sautéed onion
-pat dried beans, corn, and onion really well
-2 eggs
-2 tsp chili powder
-left out hot sauce
-added 1/4 cup quick oats
-chilled mixture, shaped into patties, froze extas

I baked them in the oven as directed and served w/ rice and BBQ ranch sauce. So good! Can't wait to have as an actually burger! Will also try crumbled as burrito filling. 

(try w/ mushrooms!)

Pretty good.  I would actually give 3.5 stars.  A little bland but still much better than most frozen veggie burgers (chipolte black bean burgers are the only frozen burgers that are just as good).  We used a bag of beans and soaked over night instead of canned (we had a ton left over for other dishes).  I will make them again, but next time I will add a lot more cumin and maybe try some chipolte sauce or something to spice it up.  I think I also put too many condiments on and sort of lost the flavor.  The next day I had a leftover burger and just put a little mayo and some avocado on and it was better, still lacking a little flair.  But that said, I am sure I will make them again.

Good, basic recipe :) I like my veggie burgers spicy so I added jalapenos.  I also added some corn for a little extra flavor and texture.  They turned out delicious!

These were a huge hit.  All my kids ate a huge patty without stopping.   They will not do that with a real beef burger.  They pick at it and scold.  I did add corn in place of the peppers.  More of a family preference.

Fantastic! And super easy! I did add about 3/4 c cooked rice and also added in about 1/2 c of flour just to make sure it held together... If i had drained out the juice from the peppers and onions, that would help too... but i was too lazy, lol! Delicious! I will be doubling the batch and freezing some so i constant ly have these!

Wow, these were good and so easy to make.  We are not vegetarians but really enjoyed these and will make again.  We made sure everything was dried out as other reviewers stated and lessened the spices just a little bit which was perfect for us.  We got 6 hamburger bun sized patties out of the recipe.

I replaced the bread crumbs with rolled oats, added some mushrooms (cooked first and drained) and dried the onions with paper towels. It stuck together pretty well and held up enough when I cooked the burgers. They are delicious, especially with avocado!

This recipe is easy and very tasty, but it makes far more that just four patties. Next time I will have to double the amount of patties I make to compensate. Very good though! It was the best veggie burger i've had in a long time.

Just made these for the first time and had to sample before serving them....They are Delicious! I'm going to make a tomatillo Ranch dressing to drizzle over the top. I can't wait for dinner! I also read that someone used this mixture as a filling for burritos. I think that would also taste fabulous!

Fantastic.   As recommended by another reviewer, I used oats instead of bread crumbs---healthier in my opinion.   Also, instead of using a food processor, I cut the onions and peppers into small pieces added minced garlic and cooked them briefly (in a non-stick pan) without oil.   I'll be making this many more times.

This was a great recipe! We tweaked it to suit us (onion powder instead of onions and green chile instead of the bell pepper) and it still came out great. We're definitely going to make it again but we're going to halve the cumin, it was too strong; but that was the only issue :)

It is good.  I followed sugestions of other reviewers and drained the excess moisture from the onion/pepper with paper towel.  Also, as I didn't have bread crumbs I used old fashioned oats. My hubby is very picky and found it "delicious".  I personally would give it 4 stars, but because these veggie burgers are so easy to make and pleased hubby, they deserve 5 stars!!

I really liked these burgers, and my husband LOVES them!  Since it's winter, I baked mine in the oven, so I didn't have any problem with them falling apart.  I made them exactly as the recipe reads.  We added Colby-Jack cheese and ranch to the burgers, which was great!  I'll definitely make these again!

Made these tonight.  Didn't have any peppers and substituted old fashioned oats ground up for bread crumbs.  Baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  Really tasty.  Would definitely make this again.

These are fantastic!!!  I substituted red pepper for green pepper.  I took a previous reviewer's recommendation, and I strained the onion/pepper mixture with a wire strainer. Then, I added the strained mixture back to the food processor and added the beans. I had no problems with the burgers staying together.  Great flavor, and I would definitely make again in place of real burgers!!

Came out fantastic! I made a few changes however. I opted out of the bell pepper, onion, and hot sauce. I used onion powder in addition and a full cup of bread crumbs. Made four thick awesome burgers, and I was able to cook them in a frying pan! Excellent recipe that will now be a staple in my household! Thank you for sharing this!

Read reviews. Did what others suggested. Was very good. Hubby said it was a keeper. Used 2 egg yolks and rolled oats (instead of bread crumbs). I did let sit before making into patties. And I put into freezer a few minutes after patties. Bake. Turned out great. Made into burgers with lettuce and honey, mustard. Added thin slice of new york extra sharp cheese to half (gave it a nice flavor). Thanks for the recipe.

The texture is great however all I can taste is cumin. There's cumin in chili powder and of course the cumin itself. I would definitely tweak the spices next time

I thought these were pretty good! I didn't have onion, but I ended up putting corn in (makes them prettier, and good addition taste-wise too). I used soda cracker crumbs instead of breadcrumbs, just because that is what I had on hand. I also ended up using about 2 tsp of hot sauce instead of 1, but I like things spicy. I thought the taste was perfect (spicy - but not overly). I made sure to dry my beans as much as possible after rinsing! With these (EASY and not major) changes, I had no trouble shaping them together. But I don't imagine that they made too much of a difference. I made 8 smaller patties, just for personal preference, and I put olive oil on my hands before shaping for ease. I didn't find them to be mushy or dry, like other reviewers mentioned.. just crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I will freeze and reheat the ones that are leftover!

I created an account just to review this burger, in the hopes that I might save someone the suffering that I just put my family through.

Mushy, flavorless, grey. And the positive reviews are hilarious: "It's really good. I had to replace half of the ingredients and then go out and order a pizza, but I loved it.!"

You have been warned.

I just finished making these and loved them!  I did add a small carrot and zucchini to the food processor and used oats instead of bread crumbs.  Also, I doubled the recipe but used 3 cans of beans - two black and one kidney - and froze the leftovers.  The consistency was perfect...not too mushy and not falling apart.

De-freaking-licious and super healthy! I loved these burgers. They’re super easy and super cheap. The only problem I have is that I only made 1 batch. Next time I will make more and freeze them. I made my own beans instead of using canned. Next time I will either strain the chopped onions and peppers or I will add an extra egg. I’d like them to be a little firmer. Also, I will add a touch less cumin and chili powder and maybe throw in an additional seasoning. I also want to explore replacing the bread crumbs with maybe oats or something else. I baked them 10 minutes on each side, then another 5 minutes on the 1st side and that was great.

Wonderful! I used beans I had soaked overnight in fridge and cooked myself; didn't dry them - were fine! I sauteed pepper, onion, and shredded carrots and at last minute, garlic - then ran through food processor. Would be great with corn niblets or anything else you like in your veggie burger. Also, sauteed sliced mushrooms and placed atop burger - next time will saute sliced onions with mushrooms to top. Dressed with red leaf lettuce, sliced tomato and red onion, as well as chipotle mayo. Next time will try Bobby Flay's chipotle mayo from 'Sliders with Chipotle Mayonnaise' @ foodnetwork.com .  My girls loved these and I served with Roasted Cajun Potatoes, By: Tamra Duncan @ Allrecipes.com (love these potatoes!)  Bon Appetit!

These were so much easier than I would have thought and tasted great - as good as Morning Star's. I didn't have any bread (weird, I know) so I had to substitute cracker crumbs and they were still great. They also freeze/cook from frozen amazingly.

I must say this is the first recipe I have not really enjoyed in a long time. Strain the water out of the onion mixture and cut back heavily on the cumin.  The burger tasted like a cumin burger in my opinion.

I really love these burgers. I freeze them individually in plastic wrap and then put them inside a freezer bag, this way I can take out one at a time. Such a great, go-to meal!

These Veggie Burgers are amazing. My teens are all vegan and they raved about them. I tripled the recipe and froze the leftovers for my kids to pop in the microwave after school. Followed the recipe exactly, delicious!

Simply THE BEST veggie burger recipe. They have a distinctly Mexican flavor, which I love. These bad boys are even robust enough to stand up to grilling, a claim most veggie burgers cannot make.

This was just okay for me and my boyfriend.  We've been eating healthier yet still delicious and this really just didn't pack as much flavor for us.  Our mixture was also really runny even after freezing it for 15-20 min, the addition of an extra egg and about a 1/4 cup of added bread crumbs.  It tasted okay but I will probably stick to extra lean ground beef if I want a burger in the future.

This was a very easy and delicious recipe.  I made the burgers with fresh black beans that I rinsed and strained.  I added 1/4 cup of mushrooms and corn.  I do not have a food processor so I diced finely.  I found that one egg was sufficient to maintain the thick consistency.  I used 1 slice of toasted pumpernickel.  I sprayed a 1/2 measuring cup with nonstick spray and loaded with the mixture and placed on a sheet pan to bake.  No crumbling or mess.  This recipe made between 5-6 burgers.

These were EXCELLENT! I took others advice and added an additional 1/2 cup of bread crumbs...I still think they were a little on the soft side....next time I'm going to add some chipotle chilis and brown rice along with the bread crumbs and see how that does.  I froze them and that worked well to cook them frozen, but once on the bbq, they still tried to fall apart some, but were still in burger shape and held together.  I think they are good....

SOOOO delicious!  I had to add about a cup of bread crumbs, but other than that - super easy recipe.  I baked mine in the oven and 10 mins on each side was perfect.  I ate it on some of those thin wheat buns with lettuce, tomato, a little mayo and avocado.  I also fried some sweet potato slices to go with it - fantastic meal!

Great recipe!  My husband was not excited for veggie burgers at all...  Once he tried them he loved them!  I will definitely make this again.  I used rolled oats in my recipe.  Feel free to use a little more until you like the consistency.

I love this recipe. I add more chili powder and ignore the cumin, though. Also have added slivered almonds with good results. And cheddar, mmm. I like to make these in bulk and freeze the excess for quick future meals.

Based on the stellar reviews, I thought that this would be a winner with the minor adjustments of squeezing the extra liquid from the onion/pepper mix and adding bread crumbs.  However, after taking the advice of one reviewer, I opted to leave the addition of the egg until the end so that I could taste the mixture- good thing I did!  The addition of 1 tablespoon of both cumin and chili powder are too much for only 16 oz. of black beans- it was a bitter mixture!  Good thing that I had more black beans on hand- I added another can to the mixture along with more bread crumbs and another egg.  It was a much nicer blend- the bitterness from the huge amount of cumin was nicely reduced.  I had no problems forming the patties on a cookie sheet and baking for about 25 minutes total (one side I baked for 15 minutes).  I will try this again- but I'm definitely reducing the cumin and chili powder and I will do them on the grill or stove top for sure- baking was somewhat unspectacular for texture, although a certainly healthier choice.

I love these! I add about 50% more breadcrumbs (as another reviewer suggested) to help the burgers stay together. I usually make a double or triple batch and freeze what I won't eat in a few days. They defrost well, and are great to have on hand for last-minute meals. And they are much tastier and cheaper than buying veggie burgers from the store!

This is by far the best recipe for black bean burgers I've found! As a recent vegetarian convert, I'm finding these to be a staple! I followed the recipe to the T and had the burgers on a warm tortilla with some salsa and guac --perfection! Thank you!

OMG - I had a craving for some delicious black bean burgers and I had never made them before.  I found this recipe and it was so easy!  These served with some homemade sweet potato fries was a big hit between my husband and I.  I plan to make more of these and freeze them for lunches during the week.

These tasted great! They're definitely a much cheaper and tastier alternative to the ones in the freezer section and are pretty easy to make. I had dried black beans in the pantry so I cooked & used those instead of canned, added a small zucchini & about 1 cup of bread crumbs. No problem with them falling apart until I was sauteed them in a non-stick skillet. My mistake was trying to turn them too often. If you're going to cook them stove top I definitely recommend letting them go 10mins on one side before flipping.

It tastes great; but it is what it is: a bean burger.  I guess I was expecting it to taste a little more like a hamburger.  But we wrapped them in foil to cook them, so that might have been the problem: they didn't absorb the charcoal flavor that grilled burgers are supposed to have.  I will make these again, but I will leave out the onions because their flavor was too strong.  Also I might skip the buns and serve this in tortillas.

Awesome tasting and great fiber- so healthy! Will become a regular in my house. We used sri racha for the hot sauce, were out of garlic so replaced with garlic powder, and added some extra egg whites. Had no trouble with the burgers coming apart. We also added bbq seasoning...YUM! Might make an Asian version (Soy sauce, ginger, etc.) next time.

I followed others recommendations to squeeze as much liquid out of the pepper, onion, & garlic mix - the patties stayed together perfectly. I also used red bell pepper instead of green - much healthier & nourishing and I also used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs. This recipe is top notch & my faith in allrecipes as having good usable recipes has been restored. Will definitely make again.

Great veggie burgers! I didn't have the spices or hot sauce (and I didn't think the kids would appreciate the spice anyway), so I used 2T. ranch dip mix and 1 t. olive oil, and prepared the rest of the ranch dip mix (by adding ~1 c. sour cream) to top the finished burgers with. I also used crushed ritz instead of bread crumbs as suggested by other reviewers, and froze the formed patties for a couple hours before cooking.  These burgers were inhaled at my house! :)

The burgers were fantastic.  I immediately made another batch the next day.  I took the tip and added more bread crumbs (Keebler butter crackers) and they turned out perfectly.  My family and extended family said they were yummy and that they didn't miss the meat.  Additionally, after eating one, you don't feel stuffed and bloated like you do with a regular hamburger.  Black beans will become a staple in my home.  This recipe gets my AAA stamp of approval. Thanks Allrecipes.com

I followed the suggestions for firming up the texture -- doubled the breadcrumbs, dried the beans, extracted the liquid from the chopped vegetables -- and even doubled the baking time. My patties still came out like discs of black bean dip. The flavor was great, but the consistency was nothing like a veggie burger.

These burgers were delicious! I added about 1/4 cup of oatmeal and a little extra bread crumbs because it was very mushy. I also refrigerated for about 45 minutes before forming and baking. I have made home made burgers before and yes, these were good but if you really like these burgers try this.
I use fresh cooked beans because there are no preservatives but it is time consuming. If you cant just buy the cana and tripe the recipe. you can freeze them if you are the only one eating them but i doubt you will be!
1 can black beans(2 cups of fresh)
1 can white beans
1 can chick peas
mash and mix all
saute your veggies until onion is translucent set aside to cool
mix you bread crumbs, seasonings (I always add crushed red cause i love it spicy), and eggs
Mix everything together and cool in the fridge
Everything in the recipe was wonderful and its great when you only have black beans =)

These were pretty tasty. My husband (a pure carnivore, like most men) liked them, too. You cannot make these; however, expecting a "burger". They taste nothing like beef burgers. That said, they are still tasty and a great way to try something different. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I am a hamburger lover, but I have to say that these are a great alternative when you want a vegetarian burger.  I made mine exactly as the recipe stated; I had no problem with them holding together in the skillet.  I fried them in a little bit of olive oil until they were brown and lightly crispy on the outside.

I think next time I will try adding rolled oats or corn for a change of pace.  

If you are a meat eater and expecting these to taste like a hamburger made with beef, however, it will not be the same.  The flavor and texture made me think of the inside of a bean burrito--except on a bun.  But they were good, I plan to make them again when I am craving a burger but have no meat on hand.

These burgers were fantastic!  They hit the spot with my cookout tonight and my vegetarian friends loved them.  My favorite part was they were so simple and easy to make.  I made sure to really squeeze the water out of the onion/pepper mixture and I added rolled oats and bread crumbs.  Thanks!

Very good! My husband who only likes meat in between two buns actually really liked them and that is a major compliment. I did make a couple of changes that previous viewers recomended. I used 2 eggs instead of one and 1 cup of bread crumbs instead of 1/2 cup just to make sure they didn't fall apart. They definately didn't. Came out great! But I did get 5 patties instead of 4 with the changes- not a problem! Came our much better than I thought they would.

I don't have a food processor so I did things a little differently. First, I chopped up my onion, and pepper (I used green and red), added it all to a skillet with a little EVOO and then put in some minced garlic. Mashed up the beans, realized I was out of hot sauce and cumin, so I substituted BBQ sauce and paprika with a dash of cayenne. Followed cooking directions, and added a slice of pepper jack cheese to it. Not close to tasting like a real burger but pretty good, definitely better than store bought and even most restaurants!

I want to rate these 3.5 but that is not an option.
A good burger, alone a but boring, but with chipolte mayo so tasty really brings out all the flavours. Served in pita bread instead of a bun with tomatoes. Will make these again.

Good base recipe but the recipe has way too much chili powder and cumin...it will make you gag. Second time I made them with 1 teaspoon of chili powder and cumin and they were delicious. I also added some shredded Mozzarella cheese in with the bean mixture. Yum!

Great black bean burgers - I don't even consider buying them from the frozen food section anymore.  Changes: dried beans on paper towel before mashing; used red pepper instead of green pepper; drained mixture from food processor; used rolled oats instead of bread crumbs to make it a little healthier.

Delicious!  There was no worry about the burgers falling apart, as I just added additional bread crumbs until the right consistency was reached (about 1/4 cup extra).  Also added 1 t. thyme.
My flexitarian boyfriend and I really loved these, and will definitely be making them again! (And making extra to freeze and have easy on hand!)

Made these today for the first time & they were delicious!! My husband & son are really big meateaters and they gobbled them up... and had seconds!!! The only thing I did differently was doubled the black beans, eggs & hot sauce, kept everything else the same and they came out perfectly! I also chopped all the vegetables by hand, no need for a food processor. I will definitely make these for my family again!

Great Recipe!  One of the patties came apart when  I flipped it but otherwise they were great.  I added salt and pepper to the mix because they helped make the flavors pop.  I also used a sprayed oil to help them brown and keep from sticking.

These were wonderful. I made a few changes. Added a few TBSP of chopped cilantro. Used chopped green chiles instead of green pepper. Added ~1/4 cup of shredded "Mexican seasoned" cheese. Minced the onion and garlic and sauteed them a bit before mixing everything together. I pan-fried a small sample patty and found it needed salt and pepper. Made three large patties and baked them. Ate them on "Tasty Buns" from this site with some chipotle-mayo-sour cream on top... as advised by a couple other reviewers.

these veggie burgers are so good its a keeper I used 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, plain bread crumbs, in my health master blended the beans only and I only drained them, then I sauted in olive oil the onions, red/green peppers, garliic, and dry seasonings all these ingredients, also I doubled the bread crumbs until right consistency...tip use cooking spray to create the patties ,spray both of your hands with cooking spray so they wont stick on your hands...also spray the parchment paper as well,

I didn't add peppers or the spices, just some salt and pepper and the fresh garlic and half an onion. My onion must have been huge compared to theirs because it turned out to be an onion burger with some black beans :-) Good thing I love onions! 

I added half an avocado and some shredded carrots. Next time I will use a whole avocado. I used flaxseed instead of eggs because my dad is vegan (1 Tbsp flaxseed meal in 3 Tbsp water is a good egg replacer). I also used tapioca gluten free bread.

I had to add more beans because I had way too many onions. I also chopped everything instead of processing it in a food processor. It could use more binding ingredients even though I doubled the bread. Either more bread, or using rice instead and more rice (the egg would have helped if I wasn't making it vegan). 

I pan fried it with just a touch of olive oil. Turning them is very difficult because they want to mush up. Next time I will bake them.

The taste is pretty good. However, I wouldn't call it a burger, because it's not. Like another commenter of the recipe said, it's a black bean patty. But I like it enough to make it again with some more slight changes. It's a nice change when I am having beans so often.

I'm only giving these 4* becuase it really needed more bread crumbs.  My bean mixture was really wet and I even stained my veggies and dried my beans.  The flavor is reall good.  I made these into sliderr burgers as bean brugers seem to be heavier then a beef burger.  These would be good with Garlic Aioli

I was surprised how good they taste. My hubby didn't seem to mind them either. I followed the advice and drained the juice from the beans and i used two eggs instead of one. In the future i think I'll add more seasoning.

The seasoning made it taste Indian to me which doesn't make me think burger. The consistency was great though and I will definitely try again with different flavors. After reading other reviews I doubled the egg, used crackers and oatmeal instead of break crumbs. We topped it with guacamole and traditional hamburger toppings to hide the Indian style flavor and make it seem more like a cheeseburger. :-)

Very good :) Definately recommended! I won't put as much onions next time because I find the onion taste is powerful, but that's just personal preference :)

This was awesome!!  This was a first time for me making veggie burgers and it was a success: both my husband and I loved it.  Didn't have green bell peppers (I never do cause I think they're a drag...) so I used a roasted red pepper and a jalapeno instead.  I serve it in those new, thin hamburger buns and some Mamirolle cheese. (a sharpsemi-firm cheese).  Will definetly make this again.

Perfect vegie burger.  I had no trouble with mine falling apart.  I did drain any liquid from my beans & vegetables...I had no need to increase my bread crumbs.  10 mins each side was perfect.  I topped it with a cucumber sauce I found on allrecipes.  1 (6 ounce) container plain yogurt;
1/2 cucumber - peeled, seeded, and finely chopped;
1 teaspoon dried dill weed;
salt and pepper to taste;
1 tablespoon mayonnaise;
chill for 30 mins.

These are AWESOME! We try and eat as many beans as we can, to save money, and this is a great alternative to the normal soup and chili. I made these with some dry beans that I had cooked the day before. I made them with shredded carrots instead of the peppers, we hardly every buy fresh peppers in the winter, but they were great! The carrot adds a good texture and blended well with the color and flavors. Oh, and I added a tsp of salt, since I cooked the beans without any seasoning.Served with mayo, lettuce and cheese on a folded flour tortilla, they were a hit! Even with the ardent carnivore at the table! Will most definitely be making these again!

Wonderful flavour, odd texture. I couldn't get these burgers to hold, so instead I use the mixture as a spread. It's a filling alternative to mayo. I also used rolled oats instead.

I loved this recipe! I didn't have a full can of black beans so I added kidney beans. I mashed the beans using a potato masher. Much faster than the fork!
I used rolled oats instead of bread crumbs- I am trying to stay away from wheat. I added a little red pepper flakes for some extra kick.
They baked perfectly and tasted wonderful! No crumbles or falling apart!

It  had a re-fried beans consistency even after doubling the amount of bread crumbs I used. Next time I will definitely add some rice to the patties to give it a different texture. The taste was great,  I didn't have chili powder in my cabinet so I made my own and added a touch of cayanne.

Delicious, healthy, inexpensive and easy to modify! I've made this recipe about 4 times so far. I dump everything (the beans, and vegetables) into a blender and blend it all together. I then dump it all into a kitchen towel (flour sack towels) and squeeze all the liquid out over the sink. This gets rid of all the excess liquid and the patties stay together quite nicely. If you make smaller patties, then this recipe yields a lot. I have started cutting squares of wax paper, brushing oil on them and then stacking the patties with the wax paper in between. I then freeze them. When I'm hungry, I pull a few out of the freezer and heat them in the oven for a quick and delicious meal.

I'm vegan so I left out the egg and added about a 1 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of corn meal instead. I also added frozen corn instead of onions (but I did add a little onion powder with some salt and pepper with all of the other spices). My meat eating husband asks for these. I put them on toasted whole wheat buns and he's a happy man.

This is a great recipe! Be sure to let the beans dry a bit (I let them sit in the strainer). I use red peppers, corn, grated (and then minced) carrots, minced onions, and/or whatever I have on hand. Instead of hot sauce and chili powder, I use berbere (an Ethiopian spice), for a milder but more complex taste. For the bread crumbs, I usually use some mixture of crumbled stale bread and crushed whole wheat saltines. Once these did not hold together at all on the pan, so I roughly chopped up the patty with my spatula and fried it with rice, and served it with sliced avocado for an amazing and quick variation.

GREAT base for any substitutions.  I used 1/2 of a toasted sandwich thin and made into bread crumbs.  Keeping it lower in fat/calories is what its about for me.  TRY THIS and YOU will enjoy not having all of the sodium, preservatives that you find in the frozen items of it's kind.

Very tasty but I had a lot of trouble keeping them together.  We cooked them for a total of 30 minutes (10 minutes more than the recipe) and they still fell apart on the burger.  I'll try to freeze them next time.

I just made these and I have to say they were delicious! I followed other reviewers suggestions and rinsed and drained the beans before I mashed them. I also strained the onion/garlic/pepper mixture after I chopped it in the processor. The only change I made was that I used 1 cup of bread crumbs instead of 1/2. They came out really good and really good, but could use some tweaking. The next time I make them I plan to do the following: add 1 more egg, cook them 1-2 minutes longer on each side, use less cumin and add cilantro. I think with those additions they will be the perfect black bean burgers. Overall a great recipe, but room for improvement!

Will make again. They were a bit difficult to shape and cook (and flip) since they were so soft so I may want to oil the pan a bit more next time. Hubby really enjoyed them. :)

Delicious! I used a packaged dry marinade - garlic, basil, tomato - in place of the chili, cumin and hot sauce and left out the green pepper since we don't care for them.  Also followed advice of others and added corn, patted dry the onion, and used 2 egg yolks instead of one whole egg.  Wish I would have doubled the recipe and had some leftover to freeze!

It's true, I'll never by frozen veggie burgers again!  These are so easy to make and really delicious.  I eyeball the amount of breadcrumbs until the mixture holds together well and I'm sure I end up using more than 1/2 cup.  I topped mine with guacamole and salsa and it was soooo tasty.  I like it even more than a meat burger!

These were delicious and received rave reviews!!  Everyone thought they were delicious!  They definitely taste like a veggie burger, but so good.  I used 5 cloves of garlic, 1 egg and flaxseed/water in place of another egg, omitted the hot sauce, and used 3/4 cup panko bread crumbs.  I threw it on the stove for a few minutes so it got really crispy before serving.   This is incredibly healthy, not to mention super cheap!!! Everything cost less than $5 and fed 4 people.

I thought these burgers were very good. I started with dry beans, used chili sauce, a "flaxseed egg" (1T ground flaxseed with 3Twater), and more than 1/2c bread crumbs.

Great recipe! I only modified the preparation, so this definitely deserves the five stars.  I followed other reviewers advice about running the green pepper, onion, and garlic through the food processor, adding the egg/spice mixture to that, then running the beans through the food processor. This resulted in perfect patties that didn't fall apart.  I put them on oiled foil and placed the foil in a hot cast iron griddle. I don't think these would have the same appealing texture if they were baked, so grill them if you can!

I was looking for a healthy meat-alternative burger and stumbled across this one.  I took the advice of America's Test Kitchen and used 2 egg yolks instead of 1 whole egg to get them to stick together better which really helped with assembly and cooking.  I also added Worcestershire sauce and 5 cloves of garlic instead of 3 and they were amazing.  I've made them four times now, and even made them for a vegetarian friend and she said they were the best thing she'd tasted in months and months (granted she does have 3 kids and rarely gets a moment to eat, but I still took it as a compliment!).  Serve them up with avocado, tomato, and other fresh fixins and you won't miss the meat at all, promise.

Edit: Here is another tip that I picked up for those with lose or unevenly cooked patties. For uniform patties, spoon and flatten the mixture into a mold. I like to use a large cookie cutter(for sliders), but you can remove both sides of a tuna can and have perfect patties every time while avoiding messy hands! This way you can even make them onto wax paper squares and freeze for later.
Veggies such as onions and peppers contain excess water that must be squeezed out. If this still fails then add enough bread crumbs to get that ground meat texture.

I've made this twice within the same week. Actions like that speak louder than any review that I could possibly give! I'm allergic to half of the store-bought varieties out there which had some ingredients worthy of a google search. It was refreshing to not only have a do it yourself recipe but this was simple, fast, healthy for myself and my budget.  I found that topping the buns with some of the thai chili sauce and ketchup(the organic version at my grocer actually costs less than the regular one) was a perfect sauce for the burger. The closest thing that I could come to describing it as would be a spicy cousin to the Polynesian sauce at Chik-fil-a. Besides it's always great to pair the sauce with a major ingredient, right? Crisp romaine or a slice of tomato really take the edge off of the chili sauce. I prefer mine baked and if I'm not using the pepperidge farm thin buns, then these make great sliders or enchilada fillers.

These were really good, but I gave only four stars because they were WAY too spicy. I think next time, I will use half the chili powder and hot sauce recommended. Made them, froze them and then cooked on our Griddler.

They were ok.  I was surprised there was very little flavor considering all the spices I put in it.

Was surprised that I liked these. Was hesitant about making them because I have never used black beans before. Rinsed and dried the black beans. In the food processor I pulsed the green pepper, onion, garlic, and a handful of carrots, then put the mixture in a strainer and was surprised at how much liquid I squeezed out, very important to do so the patties stay formed. Put the black beans in the processor and pulsed to a nice consistency. Mixed veggie mixture and beans together in a bowl adding the egg, chili powder, cumin, hot sauce and bread crumbs. I did add a little extra bread crumbs. Formed into patties, put on parchment paper on a cookie sheet and put in freezer. When frozen I put the ones I would not be cooking in a freezer baggie for another healthy, quick meal. Served on a 1 point wheat roll with lettuce, tomato and mayo for a total of 5 points on Weight Watchers. (the patty is 3 points) So glad I tried these. Will always have some of these made in my freezer.

Homemade Black Bean Veggie Burger Haiku: "The most helpful tip? Freeze a bit before grilling. (Or they'll fall apart.) VERY filling and delicious, either served on a pita w/ chipotle mayo, avocado and tomato slices, or dressed up like a regular burger w/ traditional trimmings. I've made them w/ crushed Triscuit crackers in place of bread crumbs, and 1/2 tsp. Siriacha, which gives the perfect kick! I wrap the 4 patties in plastic and freeze them for 1-2 days prior to grilling (or baking), and then grill them in a well-oiled pouch of foil, or in a skillet coated w/ cooking spray. Never buying packaged BB patties again!

These are wonderful. I put everything in the food processor added a little more bread crumbs and they turned out perfect! Thanks for such a great recipe! I have tried the frozen veggies burgers and do not care for them at all. These are inexpensive and easy to make and I can make a couple batches and save myself kitchen time!

THE BEST!  I always double the recipe and freeze them.  I highly suggest straining the veggies after they have been processed.  Getting as much water out of them helps keep the burgers from falling apart.  I like them extra hot so I go heavy on the hot sauce.

My husband went crazy for these (I thought they were fine).  I didn't remove juices from the veggies, but put in an extra egg and extra bread crumbs.  They were a little breakable, but fine.  I had a horrible time with them on the grill.  High heat was way off for our grill.  I ended up baking them which was fine.  For spices, I'm not into spicy, so i did my own thing totally - 2 t. old bay spice, 1/4 t. cumin, and splashes of mustard and bbq sauce.  i'll play around more next time.

Really tasty... follow this suggestion for keeping it together:   I love these burgers. Let me tell you how to keep them from falling apart, though. First, you must rinse the black beans and dry them off before mashing them. Second, you must strain the onion, garlic and pepper mixture through a fine strainer to remove any excess water. Third, if you add 50% more bread crumbs, it will hold much better. Also, I freeze mine and grill them frozen. Doing this has keep my burgers intact and my mouth happy! Also, I always follow the spice/hot sauce measurments pretty well, and I do not find it too spicy at all, and I find black pepper to be spicy! Hope this helps with the loose burger issue.

This was a very good starter recipe.  I added more seasoning, WAY more bread crumbs, another egg, and a whole can of chickpeas as well.  The flavours were just right though, and these burgers go very well with tarragon mayonnaise.  Personally, I like these type of things to be nice and crisp on the outside, so I baked mine at 400 for about 30 mins, turning once.

did not have bell peppers, so improvised. Used a palmful of walnuts, a shitake mushroom and a 1/2 carrot. the mix tasted good before I added the egg.  This is so adaptable, great recipe for vegetarians. Thanks.

Yum! I will say, that I tried as hard as I could to remove as much extra liquid as possible: I washed and dried the beans, also blotted the onion and pepper to remove as much water as possible. It was a little mushy and I did have problems with them falling apart. I used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs, and all I had to do was add more crackers until I got a good consistency that would form a patty. This one is a keeper in my book!

I have to say that I didn't think I was gonna be a fan of a veggie burger but these taste really great! Nothing replaces the fat laden 80/20 chuck burgers but this is a good alternative. :o)

Great burgers. I made the butter bean burgers on this site and then these. They are like beef burgers and turkey burgers. I love these burgers the best but I like the choice. I will not be buying frozen vegan burgers any more but will be making my own and creating different seasonings for these. I froze these first and then baked them on parchment paper. Great new choice and filling too.

I was happy that these burgers held up well for me. I read the reviews and removed as much liquid from the equation as possible. I set the onion and pepper on a kitchen towel and drained as twisted out as much moisture as I could. I also dried the beans after draining and rinsing them. The burgers shaped beautifully and we grilled them without mishap. They looked beautiful. I like the recipe and will use it again. Unfortunately I had to take it down a star, because my husband still wasn't too fond of the consistency. He said, "It tastes like refried beans of a bun." He wasn't necessarily saying that's a bad thing, but it wasn't totally complimentary, either. Anyway, the recipe is definitely a great starting point which can be altered based on your personal preferences.

These were awesome!  I don't know what everyone is talking about, you DO NOT need to add an extra egg!  The burgers would been disgusting goo with 2 eggs!  I followed the recipe exactly except I forgot to pick up a bell pepper at the store.  I used a couple of tablespoons of chopped jalapenos (from a jar, NOT fresh) instead and it gave the burgers a little heat that my husband loved.  I will say I did use paper towels to try to remove as much excess water as possible from the beans and jalapenos before I added them to the mix.  I also just threw all the ingredients into the food processor and mixed it together all at once.  After I cooked the burgers in the oven they looked and tasted like regular hamburgers.  Very similar in consistency to ground beef.  My husband is a big time carnivore and he literally could not believe the burgers didn't have any meat in them!  We both thought they were awesome!

These are excellent. I'm a believer in rating a recipe according to the ORIGINAL recipe. Please don't make a bunch of changes and rate it 5 stars! Anyway, I noticed some people had trouble keeping them together. Well, I'll admit when I first made the patties I was nervous because it didn't seem they'd stay together. But I had to refrigerate them because I made them in advance, and that was the key. By the time I pulled them out, they were solidified and grilled beautifully. Wow, long review. Sorry about that!

I made this recipe exactly as written, and had no problems with the burgers falling apart. The spice was perfect, not to much, but just enough to add a little something extra.  My husband had his on a bun like a hamburger, while I had mine in pita with tzatziki.  It was delicious both ways.

Delicious burger!  I had a can of black beans and was looking for a new dish to make with them and stumbled upon this recipe.  Mine wasn't too spicy at all and I might even add a little bit more kick in the future.  The recipe was quick, easy, and tasty - a definite keeper.  I took advice from others and put my leftovers in the freezer - definitely has helped to stop the crumbling.  I think next time I'll add some chopped portobello to the mix.

These are great!  I stopped eating store bought veggie burgers since they all seem to have soy, corn or wheat in them--and I'm allergic to all 3.  I've made these at least half a dozen times now. The first time I made these I followed the recipe exactly and the taste of the cumin was a little too strong for me and they were a little wet and messy.  I've adjusted each time I make them and don't really measure the ingredients anymore.  I add enough bread crumbs (gluten free) to get the texture I want and usually end up using more bell pepper and onion than the amount listed.  I adjust the seasoning to my taste and add salt and pepper.  Sometimes I also add some shredded cheese.  I always bake them using a parchment lined cookie sheet sprayed with cooking spray.  Fantastic!

Good flavor but the texture was a bit odd, (refried beans on a bun).  Substituted a half tablespoon of ground cayenne for the Thai chilli paste and omitted the Green pepper. I will try this one again and see if the texture issue was something I did.

for those of you who have difficulty with it holding together may i suggest doubling the bread crumbs i.e. one cup instead of half. if you want to give them a zesty Jamaican flavor add 1/2 tsp Grace Jamaican Jerk seasoning to the mixture. it'll blow your mind!

These were pretty good.  My daughter who doesn't eat a lot of meat really enjoyed them.  She had a homemade veggie burger at a local restaurant that had wheat germ in it so I wanted to incorporate some for extra nutrients.  I doubled the recipe, used hot chile paste instead of chili sauce, used 1/2 cup bread crumbs and 1/2 cup wheat germ.  I didn't have any lettuce or tomato on hand, but those would have been excellent toppings, and also some avocado would have been tasty as others have suggested.  I baked at 375 for about 25 minutes to get them a little crunchy on the outside, but they were still moist inside.  I would definitely make these again.

These tasted pretty good, but they were more like re-fried beans then burgers. I chopped my veggies up real fine, squeezed out the moisture, and baked them like it said and I had no problem with them falling apart or sticking. They just weren't what I was expecting. They could use some more texture. They were pretty mushy.

these did NOT cook at all. i followed the recipe exactly and baked at 375. i turned out with a "batter" but baked them anyways. i must have kept them in for an hour and theyre still mushy on the inside. oh well. maybe ill try again and double the bread crumbs.

Was very disappointed with these burgers.  This recipe should be called "Bean Mush Burger" as it just tastes like smashed beans dried out into a patty.  I had no problem with them staying together as I poured the batter onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.  Flavor was just ok.    The texture was way off.  Kind of like flavored sawdust paste.  Crumbly mush in my mouth :(  I've had many delicious veggie burgers, so I was really bummed with this recipe.

They were good, I was just expecting more. I wouldn't do them again simply because they weren't worth the time and hassle for four burgers when Morning Star Farms makes veggie and black bean burgers that taste the same.....

I scaled the recipe up to 6 and this yielded 10 good size patties. I scaled the spices down and omited the chili sauce to accomodate those who didn't want spicy, and instead served these with a homemade spicy chipotle ranch burger sauce on the side. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written and was very happy with the outcome. We grilled them on the indoor grill for about 12 minutes per side. They are very soft, but held together quite well. Very filling. Thanks for a great recipe!

I am a relatively recent vegetarian and was very hungry come lunch time. So on a whim I figured I'd try making a black bean burger instead of a Boca burger. This recipe is freaking amazing. I did make some minor modifications (which mirrored some of the ones in other reviews). I get a little freaked when I have to use lots of hot spices and such, so I cut the Cumin down to 1 tsp. and used 1 cup of bread. I only formed one patty and baked it at the temp. the recipe called for. Though in the last minute or so before I pulled it out to eat I put a piece of cheese on top and let it melt over it. So delicious! I formed and wrapped up 3 other patties for the freezer and can't wait to make them and share them with my friends and family. Great recipe!!! :]

We really enjoyed these veggie burgers!  They are definately better than the store bought version!  My 8 year old said he thought they were a real burger and enjoyed his dinner.  It took about 15 minutes on each side at 375 degrees at our 5600 foot elevation.  The grill will be fun too!

Super hearty and guilt free! I mashed the beans with a potato masher, took the advice of others and strained the pepper+onion+garlic mixture. I added a little corn because I had some in the fridge and I used red instead of green pepper - also what I had on hand. Sprinkled a little extra bread crumbs and baked 10 minutes on one side, 8 minutes on the other. Veggilicious!

Delicious! The whole family loved these. I took some of the tips from the reviews and added more bread crumbs than called for. I actually put the beans in the food processor - much easier! Then I processed the onion and garlic, and drained it before adding to the beans. I also made the patties (8 for a double recipe) thinner, and froze them prior to cooking. This made them hold together as the mixture was quite soft. I pan fried them frozen, about 10 minutes on each side. I served them with all the condiments I would normally use on hamburgers, and  they were very tasty. Thank you!!

Wow. This recipe is awesome. I'm not a vegetarian, but I've been trying to eat better lately, so I decided to try these black bean burgers. I didn't have any cumin or chili sauce. I added a tablespoon of dried jalapeño flakes instead. The only problem I had was that they were a bit mushy on the inside, so each bite caused the patty to get bigger. lol. Even so, this was one of the best burgers I've ever had, including beef hamburgers!

delicious! I skipped the onion (don't like them) and the hot sauce (didn't have any) and these were still very flavorful. I used a mixture of green, red and yellow peppers and added a few sliced of portabella mushrooms in my food processor, then squeezed out the liquid as other reviewers suggested before blending in the rest. I had no problem forming them into nice patties - not soupy at all! Made a double batch - 7 for the freezer, one for me - and I can't wait to eat the rest!

Loved these!  I baked mine and the flavor was great.  I will grill or lightly pan fry the next batch to see if I can get the patties a bit firmer.  Yummy and healthy.

Very good! My kids thought these were really good, especially wrapped in paper with sweet potato fries. ;) The only thing I did different from the recipe is that I drained the onion/pepper mixture in a wire strainer until it mostly stopped dripping and used oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs. (Both suggestions by other reviewers. :D) I also doubled the recipe and added 3 eggs instead of two and they held together perfectly.

this is the BEST recipe. since finding it about 3 weeks ago i have made over 80 burgers!!! my husband takes them for lunch, i give them away, and they store fabulously in the freezer! i make alterations all the time...sometimes adding mushrooms or other coloured vegetables. green onion was yummy too. i always quad the recipe as i don't have a food processor and it takes awhile to chop it all up :P i've also tried it with 2 cans black beans 1 can chickpeas etc...this is pretty much the greatest recipe. i recommend it to everyone i know, and tons of my friends have been making them and freezing them too!

The veggie burgers in the store are bland and pasty.  This one is superb in every way!  I left out the hot sauce and cut the chili powder in 1/3 (I'm hypersensitive to spicy foods) and it tasted spiced and passive.  I chopped the veggies in a small cuisinart.  I decided to put everything in the cuisinart. The end result was smooth and tasty.  I'd like some small bits of unique flavors, so I'll leave out a bit of the chopped veggies and incorporate it after I cuisinart everything else. I drained and dried the ingredients as best I could and the mix was still too wet.  I added more bread crumbs per other suggestions.  Good idea.  I also added carrots and spinach.  The recipe portions are too big for me.  I made a double batch and baked 1/2 to store, freeze and nuke.   This also makes a great spread raw.  I'll definitely make this again and again.

After trying some other vegetarian recipes from the site, I was truly impressed. I've made these twice so far - First as listed, and the second time taking away the cumin, and substituting the bell peppers with jalapenos. The jalapenos won over the bell peppers for me. Thank you for these!

We've made these three times now and they are a hit.  The first time, I tried to fry them and they just fell apart.  2nd and 3rd time, I've baked them.  I made sure and pressed the water out of the veggies through a sieve and I think that helped hold them together.  After formed, I put the patties in the freezer for about 10 minutes to firm up.  Once baked, we put them on whole wheat buns with avocado, pepper jack cheese, lettuce and tomato.

Wonderful! I made sure to get all of the water out of the veggies like earlier posts and had no problem with consistency. I did add a sauce that brought it all together: 1 chopped roasted red pepper, mayo, and cilantro pureed until creamy. yummy!

quicke and easy to make.  This recipe is versitile. Add what spices you like I added some cilantro and garlic too. It was great. Better than store bought.   But I did mix everything up in the food processor. I think next time I will mash the beans as directed. The texture was a little off because I didn't follow the original directions.

Warming the beans in the microwave helped with the mashing process. Also, I added a handful of cilantro and one green onion to the food processor which made the flavor extra delicious. And, I combined sour cream with salsa to put on the inside of the bun.

YUM! I made this *for the second time* last night. I have to be  honest and say the first time around it didn't work out too well. I dont own a food processor so I chopped the onions and what not but not finely enough.. secondly I didn't heed the other reviewers recommendation on using two eggs. They came out dry and chunky (not in a good way).  But last night I decided to re do this recipe at friend's house. I still chopped the onions and peppers (finely this time). Instead of bell peppers I used 2 seeded jalapenos. I used two eggs instead of one. I ended up needing half of another can of black beans. I also added a tea spoon of cayenne pepper. Once I had them ready to go in the oven I cracked some black pepper on the top- and the same when I flipped them. I served them actually on a piece of toast (open face) with a champagne garlic mustard and three slices of avocado... let's just say I found myself writing out the recipe several times last night for several friends.

Great alternative to regular burgers!  I omitted the Thai chili sauce (didn't have any) and added a packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix.  We ate them without a bun and topped with salsa and sour cream.  I'll definately make these again.

Wow! With a husband and two boys, im the only vegetarian in my house and im not sure who enjoyed this more, me or them! This is a fantastic receipes, so flavourful and my husband says they are just as good as hamburgers! I used an orange bell pepper instead of green and added some sweetcorn and left out the hot sauce, and baked them....delish!!! Will have again and again and again! Thanks for the fab recipe!

My meat-loving family loved these! As a vegetarian these have single-handedly eliminated my cravings for burgers. I modified a little, using half the chili powder and crumbled Ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs. I don't measure the crackers, just mix until it's the right consistency. I would guess I use about twice what the recipe calls for. Melted swiss cheese is great on these, as well as ranch or peppercorn dressing.

Not like this recipe needs another 5 star rating, but I thought I'd put my 2 cents in as well. :) Excellent burgers!  I added an extra egg and to the bread crumbs an extra 1/4 cup matzo meal.  I used sriracha hot sauce so I only added 3/4 tsp just in case. I then fried the patties in oil on the stove top.  They fell apart a little bit, but they tasted so darn good, nobody cared!!! A++ recipe!!

I love the flavor of these.  I tried two different ways of to make them, to see which way I would like best.  The first batch I tried following the recipe directions exactly, and I ended up with pureed green pepper and onions,(with a few huge chunks still left in it).  I knew it would be way too much liquid from this puree, so I drained this well and proceeded with the recipe.  These patties stayed together very well, and tasted good.  The second batch I just finely diced the green pepper and onion, and then followed the recipe.  These patties were very dry and would not hold together, but the flavor was amazing.  So I guess the verdict is, if I want patties that stick together I will follow the directions and just add a 'drain the vegetables' step in there.  This recipe is definitely a keeper for me.

Really great! I processed and strained the onions & garlic, used rolled oats as suggested. Plus egg whites til proper consistency like thick batter as someone mentioned. I used Franks Chili Lime hot sauce but next time I might used Red Rooster. I froze & baked them. This recipe is a keeper!!!!

These are delicious! Made with goya black beans, red/green peppers, and unseasoned bread crumbs. Added more spice as we like things seriously spicy. Served on rolls with guacamole and all the fixings, homemade french fries and salad.

Awesome, don't change a thing! I am the only vegetarian in my house so I made the whole batch but froze the other three burgers. They seemed to have frozen well - I thawed one out today and cooked it on the grill and it tasted great!

Wow! I made these for my Memorial Day barbeque last weekend and they were a hug hit! Some of the guys actually stopped eating the meat and switched to these! I did find them a little soft to work with, but took another reviewer's suggestion and cooked them frozen. I cooked them on the grill on a piece of foil, which worked well and then baked one in the oven for lunch on Tuesday. Yum yum! One suggestion: make sure to use a non-stick spray if grilling or baking. Otherwise they stick and come apart when you try to flip them.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This was DELICIOUS!!!  I only used 1/4 of an onion, though, and instead of going through a food processor I just chopped everything pretty small.  I also made my own bread crumbs from toasted bread.  That helped cut down on the calories (I used that 45 calorie Sarah Lee bread).  I also used Egg Beaters instead of an egg, and used skim milk.  I used Bush's Black Beans with reduced sodium also.  This cut my calories down to around 120 per burger!!  I'm playing with the idea of vegetarianism just for health's sake, and this recipe is really making that transition a smooth one!  I think I preferred it over meat burgers!!  Thanks for this recipe!!!

Well I ended up with black bean mush instead of burgers. I think my mistake was mixing the recipe with tips from other reviewers. Otherwise the taste was good and i liked the idea. While BBQ-ing, the burgers just fell apart but I cooked it anyways and put in into a pita which made a really yummy sandwhich.

These are the best black bean burgers. They are easy to make and they taste much better than the frozen ones at the store.  I love making them for my vegetarian friends. Everyone loves them! Thank you for the recipe. :)

This has become a regular in my diet.  I followed recommendations by others to use 2 eggs and to dry off the beans and veggies before mashing and mixing.  I don't have hot sauce, so I just leave it out.

Absolutely Incredible!  I love my meat... but lets face it, black beans are cheaper and healthier!  I doubled this recipie and made a few changes. I took pevious reviewers advice and squeezed the excess water out of my Red Bell Peppers. Changes:I added 1 tsp of Onion Powder (instead of fresh onions), about 1/2 cup of powdered parmesan cheese, and 1/2 cup of drained canned corn.  Even though the doubled recipe called for two eggs, I only put one in - two eggs would have made the bean mash too runny.    I will definetly be making this one again.  Lots of flavor and great texture!  I didn't miss my 1/2 lb beef burger at all!

I made these with a mix of oatmeal an crushed cracker crumbs. I just added them until the mix stuck together. I had no issues with loose burgers. I served these with baked sweet potato fries and I thought they were very good. My brother was a little bit thrown off by the texture, but he ate most of his. I will be making these again and I look forward to trying them grilled or fried.

I made this recipe two times. The first time, 3 cloves of garlic was a little too much for me- so I tried with just one clove the next time! I also added a little bit of corn and I chopped up some fresh spinach and added that as well. Oh- and I also added a little brown rice! I was so excited to have such a HUGE burger, and it is actually healthy for me!! Now when my Hubby eats his meaty burgers, I eat my black bean burgers!!! (I freeze the rest and use when I don't feel like cooking!!) Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!

This was the first time I've ever made or eaten a black bean burger and i was impressed with the turnout. These burgers are great, my sister and I loved them. I made a few changes. I added about 2 tablesspoons of salsa to the recipe and used a chipotle hot sauce instead. On top the burger i put a homemade guacamole and then some additonal salsa. It was great. I also didnt mash the beans completely because I wanted a little more texture. Definitely try the burgers, they were great. Oh and i added a little more bread crumbs to help pack the patties together better.

Great recipe!  I made the seasoning for black bean burgers and for ground turkey burgers at the same time.  They both taste great!  I think the seasonings are perfect, I did add a little salt and pepper but not much.  I would recommend this for sure.  I stopped buying frozen veggie burgers a long time ago, I am happy to have found something to replace them with!  By the way, nothing crumbled, they flipped perfectly... I cooked them in the oven.

This recipe is DA BOMB!!!  Both my teenage boys are vegetarians and I think it is ridiculous to spend $5.99 for 4 veggie patties.  I found this recipe and used other reviewers suggestions: drying out the beans, using ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs and adding 1/2 cup of rice. Get this, I even had sushi rice sitting around that I never used, and since it's supposed to be STICKY I thought... how perfect! It was!!  Also, I never came across this suggestion in the reviews but I added a 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke.  It was such a perfect addition.

I expected this recipe to be good, but I'm blown away with how tasty this turned out.  I'm not even vegetarian and I would take these over a beef burger any day.  I doubled the recipe, the only thing I changed was adding -bit- more bread crumbs than called for.  For a doubled recipe I probably added less than a quarter cup extra.  I used the same proportion of spices it called for and didn't find it tasted of cumin too much at all, as some reviewers have complained.  I did grind the veggies to almost a paste before adding them to the bean mixture, and the hot sauce I used was Sriracha chili sauce, which I feel made all the difference.  Topped with simple american cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle, ketchup and mustard, this was easily the best homemade burger I've ever had.  I will -definitely- make this again.

Extra Tasty- we've had them twice since! I used 2 eggs, and about five pieces of bread that I blended into breadcrumbs- I kept adding until it was a ground beef consistency. Grilled in the oven.

I have made these so many times that I know the recipe by heart.  First of all, I do substitute 1/2 cup oats for the bread crumbs.  I don't add more than what is called for.  When you mix everything together, it does seem more 'watery' than typical hamburger -- but it's supposed to be.  If you add more bread crumbs (or oats) they'll end up dry and bland.  I ONLY bake these in the oven on a parchment lined cookie sheet.  On the grill or BBQ they'd just be a complete mess.  Also, play around with the seasonings to make it your own.  Sometimes I don't add cumin and hot sauce but add 1 TBSP of Worchestershire sauce and diced Swiss along with the other ingredients.  Enjoy!

WOW! I am just starting to cook vegetarian cuisine (Its my new years resolution!) and this is wonderful, even my meat eating husband ate two! When making the patties I used about 3/4 cup bread crumbs and substituted green taco sauce and 1/4 red and 1/4 green peppers. I also cooked these quite a bit longer than called for, about 17 minutes on each side. I served these on toasted whole wheat buns with organic cheese, lettuce and tomato, but what *really* made it awesome was reviewer Jamie Ks suggestion of chipotle mayo, the patties themselves are a little bland, but coupled with the mayo these were delicious!

We really enjoyed this one! I put pepper, onion, garlic in the food processor until it was starting to break down - then added the black beans and spices and gave it a few whirls in the processor. I used two eggs whites and a crumbs until it wasn't too wet. I didn't have any issues with falling apart. I cooked them on the stove top. these are on heavy rotation.

My father-in-law loves these.  He eats with us once a week and requests these nearly every week, which is fine with me, because they are so easy.  I do add an extra egg and leave out the cumin once I started adding the extra egg I haven't had trouble with them holding together.  I bake them in the oven.

I'm an omnivore who loves her rare, bleeding burgers (and I don't care for black beans), so I was surprised at how fabulous these were.  They are flavorful and not too spicy.  I took another reviewer's advice to use 3/4 cup of bread crumbs, and the patty held up like a trooper.  I don't use non-stick pans, so almost everything breaks up on it, but this held together.  Thank you for this healthy delicious recipe!

It was okay, but felt like it was missing flavor and texture. Maybe the beans just weren't my thing, but the patties tasted dry and mashed and kind of strange.

This recipe is awesome!! Have made it several times now, and it is a hit. Make sure to drain off the liquid from the veggies before adding. I've also noticed for some reason different brands of beans are wetter than others. If your mixture seems too soft, pop it in the fridge for a while before making your patties. It'll hold together better.  These also make the best taco filling ever!!

This was very good. I ran into some trouble with my mixture being too moist, but I just added more bread crumbs to compensate. Like other reviewers, I fried mine a little bit after baking to make them slightly crispy on the outside. I also added sweet white corn to the mashed beans, which was very good.

I'm eating my burger right now and it is delish! I followed the recommendations to dry the beans and onions, and that may have helped mine stay together. I also threw in some veggie crumbles and oatmeal. I didn't have to chill before baking, but this probably have helped the burgers firm up a little more. Definitely try this recipe!

These are really good and tasty. The challenge is, as usual for me, trying to get them to hold together. If you fry them, make sure your oil is hot, but not smoking, otherwise the burgers will just soak up the oil and turn to mush.

I'm always looking for a good vegetarian burger recipe. Unfortunately, this one wasn't it for my family. I did read the other reviews where posters said that the mixture was very wet. But I decided to try the recipe as it was written. It was so wet I could have poured the mixture. I ended up having to add an additional 1/2 cup of bread crumbs just to get to to where I could form them into burger shapes. Since we don't have a grill, I chose to bake them in the oven. I found them to be dry on the outside and soft on the inside. The flavor was ok, but the texture didn't do it for us.

Excellent burgers! I pan-fried mine in a nonstick skillet and they cooked up perfectly. I did cut back on the spices but glad I made a double batch!

Coming from a meat eater, these burgers are incredible! I used rolled oats and 2 eggs. (Next time I will add a little brown rice to make it a little less mushier.) I froze them and stuck them directly on my George Foreman grill... delicious!

This recipe will now be a staple in our home. I am always looking for meat alternatives for a healthier diet. I added finely chopped jalepenos, extra bread crumbs and southwest seasoning instead of cumin etc... it was so good! I served it with tomatoes, romaine lettuce, red onions, ranch dressing and fresh cilantro. I used the leftovers on a spring mix salad with all the above toppings for a very satisfying lunch at work! My husband just loved it!

These were incredibly good. My boyfriend is a vegetarian and we have had store bought black bean burgers, but these were by far better.  I used purple onion and cheese seasoned bread crumbs because that is what I had.  I just added the crumbs until it was a good molding consistency.  I also added brown rice which gave them a great chewy texture.  These were fine placing directly on the grill and the cooked texture was was fabulous.  My boyfriend was so very impressed and can't wait to make them again.  I also loved that I made them large enough to go on the big wheat buns.

This was a very delicious recipe that was much better than I expected due to my previous  encounters with veggie burgers. I had to make a few changes due to lack of ingredients and advice from other reviews. To prevent the burger from being too wet, I dried the beans after rinsing as well as squeezed the liquid out of the veggie mix.  I was low on breadcrumbs, so  I threw in 1/3 cup brown rice in addition to the 1/3 cup bread crumbs I had into the food processor.  I also substituted cayenne pepper for the hot sauce.  Overall this turned out excellent and the patties stayed together in the oven.  I would highly recommend this to anyone!

Oh my ... these are really good!  I, too, was wary of the spice level but it was perfect.  I used fresh bread crumbs (as opposed to dry) and added about twice the amount called for.  To help the patties keep their shape, I chilled them for about an hour after shaping before cooking.  Given the spices, I topped the cooked patties with a squeeze of fresh lime, salsa and a dollup of sour cream.  WOW!!!

I thought these were Delicious!!  I used tabasco instead of thai chili sauce, and i mashed the beans with a pastry cutter because a fork wasn't working well and it started to hurt my hand. I ommited the onion because we had none, used a red pepper instead of green.  I also put the red pepper in the blender, because i don't own a food processor, and put the garlic cloves through a garlic press. I didn't really measure out the bread crumbs but rather, tore up pieces of multi-grain bread until the bean mixture began sticking to itself (probably required about 4 slices).  I grilled it on a charcoal grill on tin foil and froze the rest and it turned out great.  I just put one of the frozen ones on the foreman grill for lunch and it tasted just as delicious as the first one I made.  Definitly will make these again.

This healthy "burger" was great! I have a toddler and was concerned about it being too spicy but it wasn't and he loved it. I served it on an onion roll with a side of steamed veggies and it was very healthy. Next time I may use more bread crumbs because it was kind of creamy but I had no prob with it falling apart like the other reviewers did.

There's no comparison between these and the frozen ones I used to buy.  These are extremely tasty.  The only changes I made: I had some corn on the cob I cooked on the grill, so I cut that off the cob and added it to the mixture.  I also used a little more bread crumbs than 1/2 cup.

There is too much cumin in this recipe and it creates a bitter flavor I had to add a LOT of additional seasoning to salvage this mix. I recommend liquid smoke, almonds and several slices of more bread.

I changed this recipe up a bit based on what I had on hand.  Instead of peppers, I used mushrooms and oats instead of breakcrumbs to keep within my nutritional plan. 
I had one last night and froze the rest, delicious and very filling!

I think it's a great recipe!  I did (like most people) add more breadcrumbs.  Another great thing to add would be some sun dried tomatoes. They wouldn't add excess moisture like regular tomatoes and would add a hint of sweetness that people are probably adding with ketchup on top--which is full of sugar and yuckiness!

My husband is a big meat eater (I'm a vegetarian and he also enjoyed these)

MMmmmmmm~ tasty. I followed the advice of others and made some minor changes to the recipe... Used garlic powder instead of garlic (none on hand), halved the cumin and chili powder, and substituted a can of mushrooms (drained) for the green peppers. The final change I made was to use rolled oats that were pulverized in my chopper to mimick breadcrumbs. I added as much rolled oats to the mix that it could tolerate... my hands were sore from the mixing! Slapped the babies on the fry pan and it came out perfectly. Didn't fall apart at all~ This will definitely make it into our regular rotation in the future.

I used 2 eggs and 1 cup bread crumbs. I was a little unsure about the seasoning, since some reviewers said it was bland, and others didn't like the cumin. I substituted 1 TB of a GrillMates powdered marinade from an envelope packet (used 'Southwest' flavor, but any would be good). Skipped the cumin/chili/hot sauce. Delish! Will try this again with different veggies - black olives, shredded carrot, etc. to keep it interesting. Freezes well. Served with lettuce, tomato, and a slice of American on a toasted whole wheat bun.

These veggie burgers are excellent!!!  The tip one of  the viewers gave on drying the beans a little before after rinsing  them did the trick. I just used a paper towel and blotted the beans while they were still in the collander. There was no problem in them holding thier shape while forming the burgers or cooking them.  These are well worth making if you are looking for a great meatless burger.  Thumbs up to whoever created this recipe. * * * * *

These were amazing!  I just chopped the onion, pepper and garlic really fine, mashed the beans with a potato masher (they were not cooperating with the fork...), used chipotle flavored tabasco and I halved the chili powder and cumin, thinking I wasn't really into those flavors.  Next time I will use the full amount, as the beans really need that flavor - they seem to absorb it.  I baked them and they were awesome - since I had the chipotle flavors going, I squeezed a little lime juice over the patties before serving.   Used a little less than 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and had no problems with patties falling apart.  Great recipe!

I loved this recipe!  I changed it a bit, as I wanted to use up what I had at home (I added chopped tomatoe, but didn't have green pepper, used differet spices).  I could only eat 2 patties at a time, but kept the already made mix in the fridge and just made two new patties later on.

Thank you for this recipe!  Definitely a keeper, and so easy to make!  I always look for new vegetarian recipes :o)

These are awesome! I can't believe they turned out so good because I accidently added way too much bread crumbs. But after baking them, freezing them, and then reheating them, the strong bread crumb taste it had when I first ate it right after it came out of the oven disappeared. Next time I'm trying them with less bread crums and instead of baking them, I'll just freeze them and then cook them in the pan. Since I didn't have green bell pepper, I just used one whole onion and it was awesome that way, but I really like onion. I also thought that the 1 tablespoon of chilli powder would be too much but I'm so glad I decided to add it anyway, it gave a great taste.

These were really good! I changed the recipe a bit just because I wanted to use ingredients I already had at home. I followed the advice in reviews and added an extra egg. I didn't have any hot sauce so I omitted that step. Also, I didn't have breadcrumbs so I used soup crackers. It was still really good but next time I will follow the recipe as written. As a final note, I halved the recipe to make 2 burgers, but it still made 3 decent sized patties.

Quick, easy to make and super tasty! Thanks for the recipe! I made this for a south beach dieter without the flour and it worked fine.  A little mushy to get onto the cookie sheet, but firmed up nicely with baking. We topped them with some shredded cheddar, salsa and a little sour cream. Yum.

Interesting! Hubby loved them! I got so caught up in TV, I forgot I was eating a veggie burger. Then, the cumin would remind me! I think next I add less cumin just because I do not care for it. Maybe some cheese and bacon...just kidding. A welcomed change.

Even having added all the cumin and chili powder, I found these to be very bland.  I cooked them for the recommended 10 minutes on each side; the outsides were dry and the insides were mushy.  I gave the recipe two stars because I found them just edible, but I can't say my family agreed on that matter.

I just finished cleaning up dinner and these black bean burgers were a hit! I doubled the recipe in fear of not having enough burgers for everyone, but it made as much as it said. I got 8 really heaping burgers out of the mix, and they are big! I ended up putting more like 1 1/2 cups of bread crumbs, and I also used my electric chopper to chop (or mush) all of the ingredients. Also I only used one teaspoon of chili powder, and one teaspoon of cumin. My eaters don't really like spicy, and this amount was perfect! The spices gave it taste, but there was no extra kick. I give the recipe the 4 instead of a 5 because it was really wet, and I ended up cooking them for 20 mins in the oven, then I put them in a frying man to finish them off. I finished the plate off with a whole wheat multi grain bun, sautéed onions, french-fries and steamed broccoli with corn. Make these! They are great!

The kids actually loved these, even my 7 year old who won't eat burgers of any kind.  The only thing I changed was I threw all of the ingredients into the food processor & mixed it all together that way.  I had to add a little extra bread crumbs & I substituted taco seasoning for the chili powder & cumin.  I baked them & for the last couple of minutes I turned on the broiler just to crisp the outside a little.  So easy & tasty, thanks for the recipe!

These were very easy to make, and were fairly comparable to the kind you can buy frozen.  I added an extra egg as suggested by others, and then an extra 1/4 c. breadcrumbs because it was a little runny.  Also, this made 8 patties for me.  One of my neighbors liked this better than the storebought ones!  Thanks!

Very good!  I didn't use the egg or bread crumbs at all...I did reduce the spices to 1 tsp. instead of 1 tblsp.  I also added a handful of frozen corn...and topped them with grilled portabello mushrooms and salsa. Delish and very cheap to make.

Delicious!!! My first veggie burger ever and it was GREAT! I followed the recipe exactly except for adding an extra egg since I didnt' want to deal with a mixture that doesn't stick together and used a 1 cup measuring cup (sprayed with cooking spray) to help shape my patties to perfection! I got 5 wonderful, thick patties from the recipe and I baked  them in the oven. I had to bake them a bit longer than the time called for so I broiled each side on high for an extra 3-5 minutes at the very end, but that wasn't a problem because it was common sense to do so since the patties were still too soft after 10 minutes on each side. We ate it on hamburger buns with lettuce, some Miracle Whip, and lots of ketchup (you need lots of ketchup when eating these because for some reason it tastes way better that way)! Thanks for sharing this recipe! I'll be making these over and over again!

I wanted my children to try this so I used mild green chilis (1/2 of a 4oz can) instead of the hot sauce. I think it would have been great with the hot sauce. I also used 1/4 cup Egg Beaters instead of an egg. I LOVED THIS RECIPE! I will be making this regularly!

I made this tonight along with the Apricot Glazed Carrots for a side dish for dinner.  My 3 yr old loved both dishes.  MAde it with cheese melted on it.  I made a few on the non stick skillet and a few on my george foreman.  I prefer the browning and crispier taste on the skillet.  Can't wait to try it on a real bbq when it's warmer.  It made a lot more for me than 4 patties (made them to fit those regular hamburger buns).  I also did 2 more garlic cloves than recipe stated.  In addition to the veggies stated, I finally chopped some broccoli heads, celery.  Loved the texture and crunch.  Spices were nice.. but I might change it up as I go on.  Will use this recipe again and yes... very inexpensive way to make these burgers (hint.. stock up when beans go on sale!).  Thanks for the recipe.  **Update** 10/12/09  Using dried beans now.  I presoak a bag, partially cook them and freeze them into 16oz or so bags.  Just take out what I need and run them under hot water and follow the recipe.  I've tweaked it as I went along, adding some onion and garlic powder, along with some mrs. dash.  Otherwise very good and simple recipe.  Dried beans is the way to go, longer process but a bag can make up to 4 meals with it.

These are delicious, easy and very healthy.  Despite what some people write here, they are not dry, just don't overcook them.  I cooked them on the stovetop instead of the oven or grill and they turned out great.

This is the fourth veggie burger recipe I've tried and it is by far my favorite.  It has a lot of great flavor and is so good with fresh salsa and guacamole!  This recipe is going to become a regular in my home.

Not bad. My veggetarian hubby didnt care for it (surprisingly). But its a nice change. I would recommend keeping juice in bean mixture and blending everything together. AND MAKE SURE YOU USE A COOKING SPRAY OR ELSE THEY WILL STICK!

...These were very easy to make and pretty tasty too.  I fried a small one before I froze the rest and was good but a little mushy in the middle.  Once I thawed the others and threw them on the grill they were even better.  They stayed together nicely and had much more flavor then my taste test patty.  Make sure you use all the liquid from the onion, pepper (I used red) and garlic puree and freeze before grilling for better texture....Thanks for a great recipe!

I've made this recipe several times now and it's always a hit.  I now form the patties and put them in the fridge for half an hour --it has reduced how much they fall apart on the grill, though I find that a pan on the barbecue is a good place to start them.  When they're firm enough, move them to the grill for a final sizzle on the 'cue.

I made these tonight and not only were they delicious they were very, very easy. Keeping the reviews that warned of oversized patties  in mind, I used the 1/2 Cup measure to portion out the patties. The size was perfect. Great recipe.

These were GOOD - really really GOOD!  I didn't have any hot sauce or cumin, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Although I made thise recipe for my vegetarian daughter, my husband and I both tried it and enjoyed.  I made the burgers too big (only 3), forgetting they don't shrink like our beef burgers. We had a little trouble flipping it, so used a second sheet of foil and just put it on top and then flipped, pulling off the old foil.  It worked perfectly.   We froze the left overs, hoping they will be just as good next time we pull out burgers for dinner. EDIT:  The burgers we froze turned out to be just as delicious.  Freeze them on a tray and thaw individually on the foil you intend to cook them on.

Excellent recipe!  I've made this twice now and everybody loved them.  The only thing I changed was adding corn. Oh and don't have a food processor, just mashed the beans, diced the veggies, mixed it all together and baked.  We topped with lettuce, tomato, avacado, sprouts, onion, pepper jack cheese and ketchup.  We will keep this recipe around for a long time! Very easy to make. Pairs really well with the spicy baked sweet potato fries!  YUM!

This made a really great lunch for me today. Took the advice of others and chilled the mixture to help hold them together. By the way, as a response to "DMayer's" review, this recipe is not entitled "Vegan Burgers". Vegetarians do eat dairy products and eggs. Thanks so much, I love my beans!!

This is a standard dish in my household now.  Several years ago, I switched to a pescatarian diet, and this is something I make fairly frequently.

If you want a twist on this recipe, substitute different spices for the cumin, chili powder and chili sauce.  I did an Asian variation with ginger, sesame seeds and katsu sauce that turned out splendidly!

A food processor is ideal for chopping, but I've also been able to hand-chop it for more of a textured burger.  It's less smooth, but more natural-style to me.

I cannot recommend this recipe enough!

Delicious! Used 1 cup of almond flour instead of bread crumbs, and Tabasco for the hot sauce. Will definitely make again!

I followed others' suggestions and used 1/2 tbsp cumin. I used red bell peppers as a personal preference and 1 C breadcrumbs for shape. Patties stuck together and it turned out great!

I love this recipe and have made it many times now. I'm an incredibly amatuer cook and this is one of things I make when I'm trying to impress someone. 

For all you other amateurs, here's what I learned to do this best:  
- I mash the black beans, a half can or less at a time, with the back a big spoon. This took me way too long to figure out. 
- I absolutely have to strain the pepper and onion to remove excess water. It keeps the burgers together. HOWEVER I don't own a fine strainer, or have cheesecloth, so after much finagling I finally found a solution. Whatever cloth-- clean cotton dish towel, unused embroidery fabric, old tshirt-- becomes my cheese cloth. It works well! but heads up it will stain your fabric slightly green. 
- Because I strained everything, I don't need as much breadcrumbs which really contributes to flavor. 
- I double the recipe. It takes long enough to make (like an 1hr 30min for my slow self) that it's worth making only once and having leftovers. The burgers freeze really well, just put something in between them. 
- Also, in general, I get more and more liberal with the spices each time I make this. The black beans are forgiving. 

I love this recipe and it gives me a lot of *cooking confidence* that I can do it well now. Enjoy!

These were really good! My fience was very skeptical being a meat guy. He went back for seconds! The only thing we added was just a little bit of liquid smoke,  cooked it over a griddle and served it on onion buns.

These were so delicious and super easy to make! You definitely do not need as much bread crumb as the recipe suggests, but it's easy to decide as you go based on the stickiness of the mixture. If baking in the oven, I recommend cooking for a few minutes in oil on a skillet at the end for added crispiness (and also to melt cheese on top if so desired). Particularly good with Havarti cheese.

This is an excellent recipe. It is a family favorite and one that I have taught many people. They freeze excellently! Great for a high fiber, easy and quick meal that is filling and healthy. I've never been able to find good quality black bean burgers at the grocery store, so this is a staple in my household.

Amazing!!!! I made sure to drain my beans well and to pat mine dry before mixing - followed the recipe exactly but I wish I had left some juice In my beans because they were a bit dry. BUT they came out right and the taste is great too!! These were pretty easy to make - will make again!

SO YUMMY!!!! These are my new go-to recipe for veggie burgers. A couple tips are to use red pepper for an even spicier, meatier look and taste as well as to make sure to drain the black beans throughly. 10/10 job well done!

A few changes, along with the highest rated suggestions of draining veggies and beans, and adding breadcrumbs:

I use a whole bag of dried beans, quadruple the veggies, and add two eggs instead of one. Season to taste. I've started freezing the leftover juice from the peppers, onions, and garlic and adding it to my pressure cooker with a bag of dried black beans and whatever seasonings I feel like using to get some of the nutrients back in there and give it a more flavorful base in my next batch.

It works great as a large batch - it's enough for a week or two of filling, individual meals. Usually keep it in the fridge and cook it a serving at a time, but I'll freeze it first if I'm planning on a more varied week.

Trying it with fresh ginger, cumin seeds, turmeric, fresh ground coriander, and fresh ground cloves today. Can't wait, it smells super aromatic so far!

It's good. Not perfect the way it is listed though.
Adjusments made:
Added parsley
1 tsp cumin only
Pan fried it instead of baking

It all goes down to personal preferences after all. Keep altering till u hit it.

Really good. I cooked for around 7-8 minutes on each side, the first flip is a bit challenging but I did the strain / dry beans before mashing method and it worked out nicely. For the 2nd side, I slapped a piece of cheese draped over it which held it together really well for removal and eating.  Great flavor. Also, I substituted Aleppo Chile Pepper flakes instead of chili powder and used barrel aged sriracha.

such a simple and DELICIOUS recipe! easy to follow and turned out perfectly. while the patty was in the oven for the last minute, i turned off the oven and added a slice of pepper jack cheese on top so it would melt while still warm in the oven. made a ketchup/mayo dressing and added spring greens and tomatoes. so tasty!

Home run! This one changed things. It didn't fall apart, and  it didn't stick to the top of my mouth. I took advise from others and used 2 eggs, and added a bit more bread crumbs, maybe 1/8 of a cup. Perfecto! Served with chipotle mayo, sliced tomatoes, sliced pickles, and harvarti cheese on  delicious brioche buns from a local bakery. Wow! Now that's a veggie burger!! Thanks!

These are so good! They are spicy, but I like spicy and it's easily adjustable to your taste. I made a few tweaks: I used all the called for ingredients, but used a whole green pepper to add more veggies.  I did wring out the onion/pepper/garlic mixture in a paper towel after they were chopped in the food processor (wringing out takes less than 30 seconds but I know it added to end product). I did everything in the processor and it worked great. I will definitely make these again, but I'll double the batch!

These are delicious. I made a mixture of Anaheim, Jalapeno,   red, green, and yellow peppers, cilantro, leeks, and garlic; all roasted and placed in a blender. This added a wonderful flavor to the batch. I also cooked my black beans in a Crock-pot with salt, leeks, and red onions. 
For the egg mixture, I added cumin, kosher salt, smoked chili flakes and chili powder. I stirred in a Mexican blended cheese and Panko bread crumbs. I cooked the batch in the oven but I also have leftover mixture which I will try on the grill. 
Nothing falls apart if you adjust the amount of eggs (I used two) and amount of bread crumbs. My mixture was pretty thick. I used a little avocado oil on top just for moisture.  The flavors are so yummy!

Do not make this as written!      Watery and tastes medicinal!  With a few changes in technique and one big change in contents you will have success.     

•To deal with the watery:   Strain and rinse beans and let them dry on a cookie sheet for an hour.   Strain and blot dry the onion/garlicc/pepper mixture  AFTER you chop it fine.  This will remove a lot of excess mosture.... the key is relative dryness when the egg is added. 

• To deal with the medicinal  forget about adding a whopping tablespoon Of cumin!    Try  a teaspoon.... 

Do these things and follow the rest of the recipe  as written and you will have a good base from which to explore different additions to suit your fancy.

I like adding the juice of 1/2  lime. (Which requires an additional tbs. of bread crumbs).  I also like adding kernel corn.   Read the other reviews they are full of great ideas and additions.  I got a lot of inspiration from others.   I think the lime juice is my contribution.... for what it's worth.

These are the best veggie burgers EVER! They're easy to make gluten free by simply using GF bread crumbs. I didn't have chili powder so I used Sweet Chili sauce: YUMMY!! Love the taste of cumin that comes through quite nicely

This was my first time making veggie burgers at home and I love them.  I prepared the recipe just as is, but I added 2 eggs and my own seasoning and a small shake of ground flax seeds.  Then I chose garlic toast as bread and all the fixings....OMG this was so good!!! I am always trying recipes because I am not  a restaurant eater (too picky).  I will be making this again!  My batch made 6 patties....Next week lunch here we go!!!Please try it very easy!!!

Adding a little salt makes a huge difference!
Also, couldn't get it to really "set" as a patty but I just plopped it on the bun (for my husband) lettuce leaf for myself.

I've been on a vegetarian diet recently and this burger makes it worth it.  Some adjustments I made include adding half pound of sautéed mushrooms and subbing jalapeños for green bell peppers and leaks for onions since I didn't have those ingredients.  Also used rolled oats with the bread crumbs and added some feta cheese.  It made me about 6 burgers total due to the addition of the mushrooms which I think it adds more flavor.  I'll never buy veggie burgers from the store again and it tastes like a normal burger!

I'm not sure how anyone pulled this off as the recipe is written. I doubled the recipe to get 8 burgers. Besides using the ingredients in the recipe, I added fresh ground ginger. I needed 4 cups, yes 4 cups of Panko to get the mixture to firm up. I put the recipe into my "patty-staker" which turned in a disaster. So, I put the mixture into the fridge for an hour to "firm it up". Then I formed  the patties by  hand using rubber gloves because this mixture will stick to your fingers. (I missed the tip in the reviews to use olive oil on your hands to handle the patty making. After all this..they turned out AWESOME.. Reviews from people I gave them to, were rave reviews.

Good, but as others stated, too wet as written. Needs more egg and bread crumbs, and veggies need to be strained.

Made them for my vegetarian wife and she liked them but need to work on the consistency. I did add the rice and increased the bread crumbs. Also added corn at her request. Had to leave out the bell peppers as she can't eat them and that probably made a big difference. May try and find some kind of substitute pepper next time. The  spices are the key and the heat was needed. She thought they were better than the ones in the store and I will make them again.

This is a great recipe and I used everything according to the list, however I actually added roughly 1/2 of a cup of brown rice to the mixture (a restaurant did this and I really liked it.) adding the rice I believe made the mixture more dry, therefore it didn't fall apart when baking/preparing. Will do this again!

This was a great jumping off point into the world of veggie burgers. I found that roasting a variety of veggies ( carrots, parsnips, onion, garlic, red peppers lightly oil seasoning salt and pepper ) in addition to the black beans was a great flavour adder. I pulsed the roasted veg in the food processor then added to the smashed black beans. Corn was also a nice last minute addition that I roasted. I even dried the beans in the oven to be hyper conscious of removing as much water from the ingredients to ensure they didn't fall apart at the end.  The seasoning needed some additions as well, but to each their own on the spices, I loved the Thai chili flavour in this recipe but added some dry spices like garlic powder, oregano, ground pepper, soya sauce, basil, dry mustard, garam masala or curry powder )Great addition in the comments about shaping and freezing the burgers btwn parchment in a container- it made the fairly time consuming task 100% worth it and helped in the cooking process. It was easier to skip the BBQ and do a light pan roast when they weren't frozen. I fed them to my veg friends who loved them! Plus my partner couldn't get enough of them- he tends to like a steak over a veggie burger any day! Happy cooking!

I am a self proclaimed recipe "tweaker" so I tend to read recipes and get the overall concept and then just go with it...however, i have been transitioning my family to vegetarian/vegan meals and this is new so I don't have the confidence quite yet to tweak!  With that being said, I LOVED this recipe almost exactly as it was written.

Since I tend to not read the directions, I accidentally threw the beans into the food processor.  This actually worked out great.  In the processor went the beans, garlic and peppers (yellow and red since I did not have green). After I read the instructions again and realized I had placed the beans  in the food processor I scooped everything into a bowl.  I added the eggs and spices to the food processor bowl after taking the bean mixture out.  I used sriracha for hot sauce.  Once it was well blended I put it in with the beans.  Oatmeal was subbed for breadcrumbs (avoiding gluten) and I actually threw that into the food processor bowl and it cleaned up the egg/spices mixture.  I doubled the amount of oatmeal and the burgers were not runny and set up nicely!  Once everything was mixed I scooped out 1/2 cup portions and they kept the cup form nicely, I simply smoothed them out with a rubber spatula into burgers

I cooked in the oven for 10 minutes per side.  I did this early in the day and when it was time for dinner, I crisped them up in a pan with a small amount of olive oil.  My family (3.5, 16 and a manly man middle aged husband) LOVED them!

Very good base, but you can add a bit more "punch" to it. Here's how: Put half bread crumbs, and half crushed Doritos Sweet Chili Heat (Plus these chips are vegan!).I also add fresh mushrooms and spinach to the bean mixture. It really brings the flavours of the burger all together. 

Also, to get a better texture, try breading it, lightly, with panko. 

The Doritos and panko mix makes these burgers cripsy, and delicious.

I'm a long time cook (40 yrs.) and cook  everything and made my own of this delicious recipe.  I used the basic recipe but added 1/2  cup of corn, three eggs and reversed the chili powder and cumin measurements. I added 2 teaspoons of sea salt, a load of fresh ground black pepper and hot sauce in addition to oats instead of bread crumbs. Instead of having problems some of the others did with a wet  mixture, I lined a cast iron skillet with parchment paper (all the way up the sides of the skillet) and baked at 375. This will be my burger for the summer. All I can say about this is awesome! I hate store bought veggie burgers and just can't get them down. But these are a different story altogether. After baking, I sliced and served with a big slab of tomato, purple onion and avocado. This doesn't need a bun in my opinion.  For those that aren't total vegans, a couple of slices of bacon would be excellent on these burgers.

I made this for my husband, who hates going meatless, and he loved them! Followed the recipe but omitted the Thai Chili Sauce. 

Didn't have any problems with them holding together. I did rinse the beans and allow them to dry for 5-10 min. I didn't use a food processor, since I pretty much think they're a waste of time and clean up. Just chopped the veggies finely by hand and used minced garlic from a jar (my fav shortcut). 

These were so delicious that he requested them again this week!

I think they were too spicy and I like spicy food.  My husband couldn't finish his.  Otherwise the recipe is pretty good.  I'll tweak it a little next time and add teaspoons instead of tablespoons of the chili powder and cumin.
I just mashed the beans, added my vegan egg substitute/spice mixture and really only needed to add 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs and they patted out nicely and cooked in the time allotted.

First time I made it I'd rate it a 3. I prepared it with ingredients as written except I used crushed Ritz crackers instead of breadcrumbs because that's what I had on hand. I mashed the beans by using my Bosch mixer with wire whips and continued using the mixer to stir in all other ingredients. As others suggested, I drained extra water from the chopped onion/pepper by pressing it in a fine sieve before adding it to the beans. Final consistency was like a thick paste so per suggestion of a reviewer I froze the patties before baking in the oven so they would hold up better. Baked flavor was bland, the patty was small, and the center felt mushy while the outside was too dry. Maybe that was a result of freezing? I just made the recipe for the second time and followed the same procedure as before plus the following changes: I doubled the recipe and made 5 patties total so each patty was more substantial, I added a little corn, I squeezed the chopped onion/pepper/corn in cheesecloth and extracted WAY more water than before, I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, I added garlic powder because I didn't have enough fresh, and we grilled the patties. This time the mix was slightly firmer than hamburger and very easy to work with and I did not freeze patties prior to grilling. Texture after grilling was much better and the flavor was stronger.

I LOVED this recipe. The only thing I had a problem with the burger falling apart but it was worth it because it was so tasty. I have never shared a recipe on F/B but I will momentarily. I am so excited that I found a veggie burger that is delicious and only cost me $2.00 for all of them(I doubled the recipe).The flavor was great and I will add more bread crumbs next time and maybe more egg so the burgers stick together.

Not sure why this recipe doesn't get more reviews because this recipe is not only easy, but soooooo delicious!  I double it because my family always wants two burgers each.  We don't eat bread or buns, so what we do is place the black bean burger on top of a bed of mixed greens and top with onions, tomatoes and whatever else we love.  I'm not kidding when I say I make this at least once a week!

This recipe is amazing!  There are a couple of things that I have done differently--  I like to add a jalapeño in with the green pepper and onion for a little extra flavor, I only use one teaspoon of cumin instead of a tablespoon, I like to add about 1/2-1 cup of corn in with the black beans, and I use bread crumbs and oatmeal to make the mixture (I use a lot more bread crumbs than the recipe calls for, I just add them until I get a good consistency/texture). I highly recommend that you drain the green pepper/onion mixture as much as possible so that there isn't too much moisture in the burger mix.  To cook them I first bake them in the oven (as directed) and then I cook them on medium-high in a skillet for 2-4 minutes on each side to crisp them up.  These burgers taste wonderful and are very much worth the effort and time it takes to make them.

Really great. My young kids (4 & 6) love them and so do I. Changes I made:
2 eggs (not 1), 
2 tsp cumin (1 just isn't enough, 1 Tblsp may work), 
1-3 tsp salt, 
1 Tbspn sugar, 
1/2 carrot shredded, 
1/2 zucchini shredded, 
3 shakes Italian seasoning, 
3/4 cup oat flour instead of bread crumbs, 
6 cloves of garlic, 
1/2 cup sweet corn (frozen), 
Omitted all chili sauce/powder (my kids won't tolerate it yet).

It's a winner!

OMG I am not a vegetarian but I am trying some vegetarian options for my meals and I made these black bean burgers and boy I realized what I have been missing! I fell in love I prefer this over a beef burger any day. I cooked them in the oven I cant wait to try them on the grill! 5 stars everyday of the week!

Very good flavor! Followed exact the first time.The burgers fell apart easy though. Second time making it I used two eggs, two cans of beans and it was still very thin/wet looking so added about 3 tbsp coconut flour - ultra absorbent and can't taste it. Turned out great!

I'm a diehard carnivore, but was looking for some healthy meatless dishes for Lent.  Decided to give these a try.  Awesome!  Way better that the store bought brands. I followed the tips in Kelly's "most helpful positive review and they were perfect!  The only thing I did different was to slide them off of the foil onto the grill grates for a minute on each side to get the a little char and some grill marks.  Will absolutely make these again.

We're not even vegetarians and I have made these several times. They are full of healthy flavor and the texture is great. I've served them on a bed of quinoa, on buns with French fries and even fried the leftovers into an omelette and topped it with salsa! They also travel very well in pita breads as room-temperature picnic sandwiches to take hiking. I do bake them, rather than grill, and haven't had any problems with them falling apart.

I made these for dinner tonight and was pleasantly surprised at how good they were. I didn't have cumin, but I added onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes. I'm the only vegetarian in the house, and will definitely be making these in the summer for my husband to throw on the grill for me.

Made this the other night to look just like the pic allrecipes has on youtube, nice and thick.  We love beans but not to impressed with this recipe.  They started to crack on the outside while cooking which was fine.  Then you bite into it and it's just mushy beans with flavor.  Really didn't know how we weren't expecting that.    Will do again with tvp involved.  Thank you

I doubled the recipe. I also did not add the hot sauce and added some corn to mine. I cooked one in the oven as the directions say and it turned out tasting almost exactly the same as the Morning Star brand black bean veggie burgers you buy at the grocery store freezer section. The patty was almost falling apart as it was baking. I am freezing mine in patties and will add salt and pepper next time. Other than that, good flavor.

These were awesome. I made them just according to the recipe and they were delicious. I didn't have any trouble at all with them falling apart. The second batch I made with extra veggies - spinach, mushrooms and jalapenos. Both ways  were delicious. I made enough to freeze and thaw for a quick snack or a nice dinner.

I made these tonight, and they turned out so well that I helped myself to a second one despite that I was already full from "round one".  I had a hard time mashing up the beans "manually", so I threw them into the food processor along with the onion, pepper and garlic once I had chopped them separately.  The end consistency was quite smooth, and I became worried that I would be making some sort of black bean meatloaf instead because the mixture did not appear as though it would be amenable to being formed into patties.  But once I added the bread crumbs (I added probably twice as much as the recipe calls for), the patties formed just fine.  I grilled the burgers on our indoor grill, and served with the usual burger toppings.  I am by no means vegetarian, but for health reasons am trying to eat less meat and incorporate more legumes into my diet.  This recipe will definitely remain on my radar!  Just awesome!

*UPDATE*...I think I've mastered these.  What I do is mince the veggies in the food processor first, then add the black beans and pulse a few times.  Stir in everything else "manually", and then I'm good to go.  I actually prefer these to meat burgers now, so much cheaper and healthier!

Easy, healthy, satisfying and delicious. Added more bread crumbs to make the mixture less wet and to make burgers stick together.

I patted the beans dry, and also used a paper towel to remove moisture from the chopped veg. And I made 6 thinner patties. Worked great!

I used 15oz of black beans, and both me and the person I cooked for found half an onion to be overwhelming. Not only that, but we could not taste the seasonings at all. The recipe basically tasted like onion flavored black beans. This recipe is a good start, but it definitely needs some tweaking.

Delicious! Even as a meat-eater I loved this. I used Frank's Red Hot and went cumin-heavy. I also took the advice and froze them which helped them from falling apart but not as much as I thought. Maybe next time I will drain the beans and veggies better. Thanks!

Even my meat loving husband enjoyed these. We grilled them outside and they tasted amazing. Instead of hot sauce, I added a Serrano chili and also added some corn. I threw them in the freezer for maybe an hour before grilling also. It helped keep the mixture together ALOT better.

These are awesome! I am trying to find meatless recipes and I struggle with bean dishes , but these taste amazing! I doubled the amount of breadcrumbs as someone suggested (also used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs) and used 2 eggs. Loved them and my husband did also. This will be a regular dish for us I'm sure !!

I made this , and it was delicious! I did make a few changes though. In addition to the green pepper, I added some sweet peppers. I added garlic powder and sea salt to the egg mixture. Since I didn't have the chili sauce, I used braggs liquid Aminos instead. Lastly, I used gluten free seasoned bread crumbs. The outcome was a tasty , delicious bean burger. It wasn't dried out and had tons of flavor. Will definitely be making this regularly.

I just made this recipe, and yes I have to agree with some of you in regards of being a bit difficult o mold the burger because it doesn't hold well. I tried the 2 eggs and the oats and still, but I will keep trying because I really loved how easy it was to make and added a bit of salt.

Very good recipe. I changed a few things to fit what I had. I put the veggies and egg in the blender.  I mixed that and the rest of the ingredients in a bowl. I used rolled oats instead of bread crumbs. I didn't measure. I just cont. to add until I got the thickness I needed to make patties. I also added a pinch of chia seeds and mrs. Dash.  I will make these again.

I've got to admit...these are allot better than frozen ones. I fried them up and they crisped up fine. I made them last night and put them in the fridge overnight before cooking them. I froze the uncooked ones for later.  I gave it 4 stars because this is very filling. I celebrate Meatless Monday for almost 1 1/2 years.  This is a good change of pace. I think I will try some other adders to it..maybe something like green peppers and corn.

Mmmmm...yum!  I made this gluten free, instead of bread crumbs I added some coconut flour and xanthum gum.  The coconut flour absorbed the liquid really well and the xantum gum helped to hold everything together.  End result was very delicious, it's a perfect to fill my burger craving in a healthy way.

Tasty! Replaced the bell pepper with zucchini because bell peppers are yuck. Turned out a bit watery so we added extra bread crumbs and oats to stiffen it. Ended up great!

First time making a black bean veggie burger and I have to say this was good! I did listen to the other reviews about reducing the cumin, also I made this mixture the night before. The patties cooked well no cracking or falling apart. Hubby loved it will make again!!!!

I loved this recipe! I followed the suggestions given and blended everything in the food processor.  I added 3/4 of bread crumbs I read and omitted the cumin. I added Greek seasoning instead. I served with feta and black olives on a bed of lettuce. So yummy!

Really good.  Added 1/2 cup refried black beans - helps it hold together.  I made the patties and froze them on waxed paper on a cookie sheet.  Pan-fried in a little olive oil, 6-7 minutes per side.  The freezing gets rid of the falling apart issue.

These were very easy but I agree that there's a little too much cumin. Some wanted more egg but I found them wet enough. SAve time and throw the whole thing in the food processor!

Needs modification- then becomes 5 star!  Just put the mix together mostly as suggested.  (added more bread crumbs and an additional egg, but this is because I used dried and soaked beans so had more than exactly 1 can of beans.)  Lightly pan fried one patty to check taste, and my taste buds needed two things- fat and salt.  Maybe not so healthy, but I added 1 teaspoon of salt and panned fried with a light coating of grape seed oil. At this point, these are AMAZING and excellent. Thank you for recipe!

I thought it was excellent!  My 12 year old son is still arguing that there was meat on his burger.  I did vary a bit from the recipe:
2 eggs
No onion, no bell pepper
Onion powder instead
Small can of mushroomed pureed with the garlic
Siracha for hot sauce.
Scoops the mixture with small cookie scoop and made little patties.  Melted pepper jack on top.  Served them as sliders on toasted yeasty rolls.  Absolutely amazing!  Will be making ng again and again for sure.

I took Eliza's review into consideration when making these.  I did alter a few things, but OMG these things are fantastic!!!  I made a triple batch for a July 4th BBQ, and I don't know if they will make it to tomorrow!

Here is what I did:
I drained and rinsed the beans, then spread them on a cookie sheet and baked them about 20 minutes at 350*.  They got a bit crunchy, which is oh so good.

I put a handful of mushrooms, a giant sweet onion, a whole head of garlic, a bunch of cilantro, and about a dozen small sweet peppers (unfortunately I used all of my jalapenos in my mango jalapeno chutney) in the blender, added about 4 egg whites, and the zest and juice of a lime.  I tossed in the dried baked beans and salt and pepper, and blended til' smooth.  

Poured this into a bowl and added a tsp of each: chipotle powder, white pepper, and cumin, and a pinch of salt and a pinch of regular chili powder.

Here the mix was very wet, so I started with a 1/2c bread crumbs.  Still wet, so I added about 1c rolled oats. Still wet, so I added 4Tbsp flour.  This seemed good (Every mix will have a different moisture content, so just keep adding until it works), so I managed to make 16 patties, plus a taster.  

I put the patties on oiled foil in the oven at 350* for about 20 minutes (was no longer spongy/puffy to the touch), let them cool a bit, and now I have them on cookie racks to cool before I freeze them (wax paper btwn.) I HOPE they hold up on the BBQ tomorrow!  If not, I will reheat.

Mine ended up crispy on the outside and really mushy on the inside. There is too much cumin, and I found the "1/2 onion" instruction to be too vague; I would rather a unit of measurement, such as "cups".

Love this recipe! Husband can't get enough of them. My food processor purees my veggies into liquid though so I usually have to add extra black beans/bread crumbs or just chop the veggies by hand. Guess I just need to invest in a better food processor.

I followed the suggestion to strain the onion-green pepper mixture and I rinsed the beans...the flavor of the burgers was great & they held together pretty good, but they have a weird texture. After cooking them according to directions, the outside edge of the burgers was dry...the middle was better. I don't think not straining the vegs would help much bc the already delicate texture if the patty would be downright falling apart. I thought they were just ok...my friend who eats veg & black bean burgers regularly liked them more than I did, but still found them a little dry. Overall, just ok and I probably won't make them again.

OH. MY. GOODNESS. GRACIOUS. these are delicious! I got about 8 good sized patties out of this recipe. I didn't have chili powder so I used cayenne pepper instead, and I don't mind because I love a little extra heat. I rinsed and dried the beans before mashing and doubled the bread crumbs as recommendations suggested. I froze the remaining burgers and I can't wait to grill them up later on. :)

This was fairly easy to make, I followed the directions but omitted most of the spice as I have three small kids.  I made smaller patties, and this was a hit with 2 of the 3 kids who gobbled the burgers, topped w cheese and ketchup and in a bun.  What surprised me was how yummy they are on their own...pan fried in a little olive oil with no bread or bun.  I am enjoying the leftovers that way!

Best bean burger ever! I threw in some fresh parsley because I needed to get rid of some and added a little extra bread crumbs. Cooked them in a skillet with olive oil. We ate them with sliced avocado and siracha and they were by far the best vegetarian burger I've ever had

This is the best black bean burger I have ever tried. They definitely grill easier if you pre-make and freeze the patties. I probably added an extra 1/2 cup of bread crumbs because mine needed extra consistency, but the flavor is superb.

I liked it a lot. I don't have a food processer so I minced the vegetables and I liked it. Simple for a person new to cooking from scratch and delicious.

This is awesome! This is the second time I've made it but I modified it and put in diced jalapeños instead of green bell pepper. If you couldn't tell I LOVEEEE spicy!! Also, in order to help it stick just put the mixture in the fridge for about 10+ minutes and it is much easier to work with!!

These turned out great! My husband is not a vegetarian, but loved them. I doubled the recipe so I could freeze more leftovers. I followed other reviewers' advice for keeping the patties in tact and patted the beans dry, added 50% more bread crumbs, and added an egg (50% more for a double batch). The patties stuck together perfectly. I also added corn -- yum. I used plain bread crumbs, but flavored or salted might be better. Also, next time I'll add a little more chili sauce or chili oil because I'd personally prefer a little more of a kick. Regardless, these were terrific.

After reading several reviews, I made this recipe with a few tweaks and it turned out great!  I cut down on the cumin using half the suggested amount and added a half teaspoon of salt. I added a jalapeno pepper diced/minced and at the suggestion of a local restaurant whose black bean burgers rock, I used crushed up Dorito chips rather than bread crumbs.  I grilled half of the burgers and baked half but cut the cooking time to 8 minutes a side rather than 10.  The burgers turned out great both ways - my family loved them and I will be making these again!

Too much onion, it over powered the flavor. I had to add some cilantro, salt and lime juice to spark it up. Would also add brown rice for flavor and consistency.

We aren't vegetarians and think these are delicious. Our friends who avoid meat asked for the recipe because they're better than she makes! I avoid hot sauce because my toddlers eat them but otherwise make no changes at all. I bake mine and keep in the freezer for an easy meal any time.

Like most people have said, this is a really good base recipe. Without any changes it is a solid meal. What's great is that there are endless opportunities to hide extra veggies in this patty. I did soak out moisture from my beans and processed onion/garlic mix with paper towels. I didnt go crazy with trying to get all the moisture out and my patties had no problem sticking together.

I like this recipe. I did change it to suit my taste. For example, I don't like green bell pepper, so I use corn instead. I also don't use hot sauce. I add cilantro when I have it because they taste better with it.  I fry the patties in oil because I found them too soft when baked. I serve them on the plate with guacamole and tortilla chips.

Best " non meat" burger I've ever tried to make. I rinsed and dried the black beans well and used a bit more bread crumbs. I also used Siracha hot sauce instead of the chili sauce. Doubling the recipe gave me eight large patties. The burger was moist and my family loved it!

Good recipe.  I made this according to the directions.  I had no problems with the patties falling apart and didn't risk the patties sticking to the pan by baking them on parchment paper.  This was certainly edible, I will mix in salt with the other spices next time. It was a filling burger without the bulk.

This was a great meal! Doubled the recipe and froze the patties carefully wrapped in cling-wrap. Added parsley, salt, more hot sauce, worstershire sauce, liquid smoke, chai seeds, and cut back on the cumin as recommended. Even my toddler ate it!

This is the 2nd time in 1 week that I've made these. Recipe made as stated except I used less chili powder. I also added liquid smoke to give it that BBQ meaty flavor. Def needs more Panko crumbs than recipe called for. I would like to add that this does need a salt to taste ratio. It really brings all the spices together. Today, I attempted to fry one in the skillet. Don't recommend that one..baking is the best method so far for me. Though near future I'll try the grill.

I really love this recipe!

It is excellent as written (I add salt to taste, BTW) and also serves as a template for variations.  I've found that almost any addition of a low-moisture and highly flavorful ingredient helps to add a personal touch.  I have tried these add-ons alone or in a combination (the variety is endless!): fresh or dried minced parsley, basil, oregano, red pepper flakes, paprika, turmeric, coriander, ground mustard seed, minced sun-dried tomatoes, mushroom, black or green olives, celery seed, taco seasoning, Italian seasoning, Italian dressing mix, ranch dressing mix, chili mix, et alia.  I could go on but you get the idea; any flavorful and/or aromatic ingredient to your liking would work, used in place of or in addition to the original vegetables and spices (just so long as it's not too moist).  Vegetable add-ons with more moisture such as corn, salsa or shredded carrot require some pre-treatment to remove the excess water; for example, I like to add a little salt to shredded carrot or zucchini, allowing some water to seep out, followed by pressing and draining through a wire mesh strainer.  

It's important to keep the moisture content relatively unchanged when making alterations, IMO. As long as the wet and dry components are in balance, your own version(s) should work. 

But after all that, I still like the original. It has a Tex-Mex taste that I really like!

This came out perfect.i drained the beans through potato masher after washing. Its imp. to drain them completely. Also I added 1extra tbsp bread crumbs to the mixture &grilled them on oiled foil.came out perfect.if u let the beans &crumb mixture sit for few min. It absorbs all the moisture.my patty was absolutely fine.my hubby absolutely loved it . Thanks

Mine fell apart a bit, should have read the comments first. However, with the partial falling apart, the flavor was outstanding. I added jalapeno to the green pepper which added another depth of flavor. My husband loved them!

These were pretty good.  I would have liked them to be spicier.  I did freeze them first.  They took quite a long time to cook in the oven.  I added more breadcrumbs according to one of the reviews, but I wish I hadn't because I found the burgers to be very bland.  I didn't squeeze out the veggie mixture because it was all taking too long.  I will keep trying this to hone my recipe.  It's a good recipe to get you started if you've never made them before, like me.

Agreed with other reviewers...you MUST add more bread crumbs in order for the burgers to stay together.  I used roasted red peppers instead of fresh peppers (which are more watery) so I of course had to add more bread crumbs.  I too think this is a great base.  You could also cook these in a pan with a little olive oil....

I have made this recipe several times. Usually as is, sometimes with half-ground oats instead of breadcrumbs.  This time I diced the onion and bell pepper by hand. I cut 1/4 strips then squeezed with a paper towel before finishing the knife-work. This was the first time I have not needed more breadcrumbs/oats! I always try to wring out the liquid after processing, but it's pretty difficult to do. Will dice by hand from now on. Also, I dropped cumin to 3 tsp, as it is otherwise a bit much for my taste. Made this as the vegetarian option for friends at a cookout - rave reviews :)

Wonderful! Kids and husband ate it. I used black lentils, added some Braggs Liquid Aminos and used a LOT of gluten free bread crumbs to hold together. We grilled on oiled sheets of aluminum foil, about what they suggested-- 8 min each side. Just flipped the whole package to get the other side. Great with goat cheese!

I used steak spice instead of the suggested spices. This recipe is too runny and needs an extra egg and extra bread crumbs. Over all a good base recipe for black bean burgers.

I read through many of the reviews before making this recipe.  I took others advice and squeezed the excess water from the bell pepper and onion mixture.  I also dried the beans off.  The recipe was easy to make and absolutely delicious!  I can't understand why anyone would have problems with it.  One thing I did do was put the mixture in the refrigerator for a couple of hours.  I'm not sure if that helped any, but I had no problems forming the patties.  The burgers were moist and better than store bought brands.  I will definitely be making this one again.  Thanks!

Soooo good. I have made this many times now. I do rinse and dry the beans, squeeze out all liquid from the pepper/onion (and use that liquid to mix with chia seed to make chia egg)and I add the corn from 1 cobb for texture.  I bake them for 20 minutes, but no need to flip them. I especially like them chopped and put on top of greens for a taco salad.

This was really good I am a true blue carnivore but I have say that I enjoyed this recipe. I have tried other veggie burgers before and idi not like them. The recipe was easy to follow and all I did was follow some of the other suggestions. The only things I did differently was to grate my garlic and I grated half of the onion then I followed a suggestion to mix ritz crackers and oatmeal instead of bread crumbs also I put that in the mix and let it sit for 15 min to soak up extra liquid. I added a little liquid smoke and worchestshire sauce these came out good I will be making these again I might add an extra grain like quinoa to add a little more structure. Which will give it a bit more texture like a real burger.

Delicious. We followed other people's instructions and put it in a food processor (I found it difficult to mash the black beans with a fork), and that worked well! I think the only difficulty was actually creating the patties, because it was sticky!

I felt like there was too much cumin in the recipe.  I felt it needed salt, and the texture wasn't so great.  I think it would've been better with some sort of sauce to go along with it.

I thought these were lovely!  The day I had planned to make them, I was also cooking red kidney beans.  Because they were handy, I used them instead of the black bean.  I also took the advice of a review, and froze the patty before grilling.

I LOVE this recipe! It's a total staple in my house now. I quadruple it (it's only marginally more work than just making the single recipe) and store them in the freezer with a piece of wax paper between each one (all in a big ziploc bag or two), and then we have easy lazy weeknight dinners when we need them! I make some small adjustments with the spices. I use 1 TSP cumin, not one TBSP (and I love cumin, but 1 TSP is plenty!), and same with the chili powder. Also, as other reviewers mentioned, the trick is to make sure the beans are drained dry and to drain the veggie mixture so the mix isn't too wet. It makes kind of a mess (I use paper towels, lots and lots of paper towels) but it's totally worth it. These are just so incredibly good, you can't compare with anything store bought, and they are really low-fat and healthy too!

I'm not a vegetarian at all, but I was curious about how this would turn out. It was surprisingly delicious and tasted like chilli! I ended up with something that was like the consistency of pancake batter and I cooked it by pan frying. The patties held together really well. I'll definitely be making these again.

This is a tasty recipe.  Why so many different opinions as to whether the burgers will hold together?  Well, the wetness of the veggies and beans is variable...so cooks must use some common sense and tweaks when putting these burgers together.   I doubled the beans and bread crumbs in the recipe but only needed a single recipe  of peppers, onions and garlic.  Used double recipe of seasoning and added a couple tablespoons dried cilantro.  My family enjoyed these veggie burgers.  Thanks LAURENMU!

These burgers were surprisingly good (note: I'm not vegetarian and generally not a bold cook). I added corn and cilantro (suggestion from a similar recipe), and I used Panko break crumbs. I chose to pan fry a mini test burger to taste the spices - opting to add salt and pepper to subsequent patties - and concluded the oven was definitely the preferred cooking method as the pan fried burger remained "wet" and difficult to flip. I will cook these again.

These were great and my family is in no way vegetarians.  They were really thick when you make 4 burgers.  I would recommend 5 or 6 patties from the recipe.  Try them you wont be disappointed

This recipe was amazing - I will never buy a frozen veggie burger again (even my carnivorous husband loved them)! I thought the burgers were a little bigger than needed, so I made about 5 patties from mine. I loved them as is, but my husband baked and then fried his (to get it crispier throughout) and really enjoyed it.

I just reviewed this recipe and I gave it 4* because of the "mushy" texture. The taste was great with the decrease of cumin. I went back and read more reviews and answered my own question about making it gluten free- and it may even give me the "mouth feel" I was looking for. I am going to try it with oats and see if the texture is what I want.

Very good.  I added the extra egg like suggested in comments, and cut the cumin to 1 tsp.  I also added about 2-3 tbsp extra bread crumbs because of the additional egg.  Next time I would intentionally let the mixture set for 10-15 minutes fefore cooking to let it become easier to work with.  The last few I made were much better than the first.  

Also I wanted to grill them, so I started them in a pan on the stove so they would set and not fall through the grill.  :)  Worked wonderfully. 

The beans I used were Blue Runner Creole Cream-style Black Beans (my new favorite canned beans!)  OMG they are so good!

A single recipe made 8 smaller burgers.

O.M.G. these were FANTASTIC.  I gave it four stars since I had to add more bread crumbs to hold everything together.  I also had to bake them longer on each side, about 14 minutes, ONLY because my oven is a little off.  Otherwise, my husband loved them!  I took the suggestion of also draining the excess liquid from the veggies after the food processor...I think that helped a lot!  This will be a staple in our household from now on.  I'd like to experiment with freezing patties to have on hand whenever we need them!

I just used this recipe, BUT the key (when baking) is to bake them for the first 10 minutes on 375 as suggested, then broil them on LO for 10 minutes, flip and continue broiling on LO for 5 minutes. The consistency of the mixture is really liquidy at first, but the broiling really solidifies them well. I topped mine with a slice of mozzarella and 1/2 of an avocado. To quote my vegetarian girlfriend "This is honestly the BEST veggie burger I have EVER had!" I will definitely be adding this recipe to the weekly dinner rotation :)

Super yummy burgers. I freeze them individually, then take them out one at a time and toss it on the forman grill and bring them for lunch. The one problem I've had is that they don't hold together well when they're grilled (not quite solid and burger like) but frankly, they taste good enough that I don't really mind.

Used a red bell instead of green.  Other than that, made it exactly as the recipe says.  They were great.  My wife has never had a black bean burger and didn't love it, but my 4 year old son loved it, and I thought they put the MSF frozen ones to shame, and were much cheaper as well.  Next time I make them I will make a bigger batch and freeze them.

Great recipe! I followed the recipe but added half of a jalapeno and some cilantro for a little extra kick, then topped with cheddar cheese and avocado. Will definitely be adding this to my vegetarian cookbook and making it again soon!

My husband and I are very carnivorous, but we've been fasting meats and sweets so I was looking for vegetarian recipes and came across this one for a black bean veggie burger.  I made the burgers for dinner and he absolutely loved them!  He said "MMM-mm, that was really good; we'll have to have these again even after the fast is over!"  Thanks for sharing!

These were quite tasty. I am not a big fan of onions or peppers, but I'm trying to eat better, so I used onions and peppers anyway. I doubled the recipe and used a whole orange bell pepper and a whole small white onion. Because my husband isn't a big fan of onions or peppers either, I put them in my food processer and kept going until they were really finely chopped and they added a nice flavor without having large chunks. I used dried beans I had cooked in a slow cooker, so I didn't have a lot of extra liquid. I froze the patties for about an hour before pan frying one, and baking the others. Both ways turned out great. I also made homemade burger buns for these, and THEY WERE AMAZING. I used the "Burger or Hot Dog Buns" recipe from here, and they took these to a whole new level. Overall, it was a good recipe, though I did end up using 1.5 times the bread crumbs like other reviewers have reported. I will likely try these again with cooked brown rice or quinoa in place of the bread crumbs to improve the nutrition.

These black bean burgers were very tasty! Super easy to make. My five year old boy had fun smashing the black beans.:) After chopping the veggies in my blender, I strained them very well. I added more bread crumbs as recommended by other reviewers. I froze the burgers for about 45 minutes before baking in the oven. This recipe made 4 average size patties. I let the patties cool for about 10 minutes after baking. The patties were still pretty delicate. Easy to break apart. If you like store bought black bean burgers, you will love these! They taste exactly like the ones I bought from costco...just fresh tasting and not hard like the costco ones always were. Next time I make these, I will be adding corn and chop my veggies by hand so the patties have a bit more texture.

Loved this recipe!  It's cheaper and fresher than the frozen kind, and even though mine crumbled, I poured the large crumbles into a wrap and added other veggies, homemade guacamole, and a little hummus and cheese.

Also, I made this with chopped mushroom, fresh chili peppers and fresh garlic chives.  I'm looking to substitute the bread crumbs with whole wheat crackers that I crumble next time, and rinse/drain beans before mashing to decrease crumbling.  Loved it and will definitely make it again!

I didn't have any issues with the burgers being to wet, they held together perfectly for me. However I did make them on the stove top and not on the grill, which may have had something to do with it working out better for me then for others. I put in bread crumbs until the burgers became the consistency that I needed them to be, which happened to be less then what was called for. The thing with recipes is that everyone has different products that they are using so of course some alterations will have to be made in order for the end result to come out the way you want them to. Play around with your ingredients.

These were great, getting most of the liquid out of the  beans and the onion and pepper mix helps, I added a little garlic salt, I made the pattys with an old tuperware patty press using 1/2 cup of the mixture per patty came out great

I just made this recipe and ate a Black Bean Veggie Burger wrapped in a lettuce leaf!  Let me tell you it was filling, did not fall apart, and I baked them in a pie tin.  I froze two for later on. I topped thm off with a blob of refried beans and some fresh salantro!  OMG!  The are the bomb!  I didn't even miss any hamburger really!  I hope I can convince my hubby to try one when he gets home!  My daughter  really like it as well she gave it a 5 star as well! :) I did not have any trouble with it falling appart while baking.  I can see a little trouble if grilling though. :) Thans for a great reicpe!  It's a keeper!

Wanted to love these, but they were kinda a bland spicy flavor. They also fell apart as you ate them and were rather dry tasting. I made a tex-mex dressing to go with it and had to overload to compensate for lack of flavor and moisture.  Not sure I would try this again.

yummy!! as someone else said - better than store bought! I added some chopped mushrooms and replaced the green pepper with red pepper. Also didn't have any bread crumbs so I used half oatmeal and half flaxseed meal. Also used 2 eggs. very good!

I didn't have bread crumbs on hand, so I used rice flour and it came out well. Also made my own ketchup with tomato paste, thai chili sauce and carob molasses (maple syrup would also work).

I love almost every kind of food but I didn't like this at all. I could only eat half the burger hoping it'd get better. I'll stick with the already-made veggie burgers at the store.

They aren't as moist as I hoped they'd be, but wow are these good!  I did as someone else suggested, adding 1/4c more bread crumbs and freezing them for a half hour before I grilled them.  Next time I think I will try adding more Thai chili sauce to offset the dryness.  Oh, there will be a next time.

This was my first time making or eating black bean burgers so I didn't know what to expect.  They were very flavorful but since I am used to regular burgers, I found them dry.  I was trying to eat healthy but had to add mayonaise to make them moist and tasty.  I put them on the grill semi frozen and they still sort of fell apart.  The flavor was great however!!  I think you could put in half the cumin and it would still taste great!!  Cumin is expensive!!  I will try them again with a bit of tweaking and maybe try a few other black bean recipes to see how to improve the moistness...

This recipe didn't work out for me at all.  The burgers fell apart and took forever to cook.  I'd punt on this one - or use more eggs and bread crumbs.  Maybe try matzah meal instead of bread crumbs.

This recipe is a household favorite! If you're finding it's too dry and crumbly add in some cheese. Also, I find that if I don't form it into patties and just bake it in the oven on a cookie sheet, I can make some excellent bean burrito filling!

Liked this one however I wanted to pan fry these but had some trouble with patties falling apart.
I tried coating a small bowl with pam or oil and putting about 1/2 cup mix in the bottom and microwaving 1-2 minutes this helped the mix bond and also formed it into a patty shape!! worked really well. Also used salsa for the veggies and added  powdered beef  flavoring.

I just made these for our memorial day cookout.  They were excellent.  Much better than the frozen veggie burgers from the grocery store.  They are not spicy at all.  I even added diced jalapenos to one batch and they still weren't very spicy.

These were amazing. So flavorful and delicious. I cannot wait to make these again. I made my homemade (amazing) guac to top, and dipped every bite in my "special sauce" (half fat free ranch and half buffalo wing sauce). I am craving them now.

This is a terrific vegan burger with lots of flavor. I substituted 1/4 cup of egg beaters, and used 1/4 cup of crushed blue potato chips + 1/4 cup bread crumbs (very finely crushed). Wow - I've made them 4 times now and my husband loves them and looks forward to the next round.

I really liked this recipe. TEXTURE: I wish it was a little more meaty in texture like some of the frozen brands. I AM a vegetarian, but I am a new one (one month to be exact), so I still like the texture of meat in my burgers, but the bean-y texture was very good, too--just different. TIME: It took a little longer to make than it was supposed to because I don't have a food processor and my food "chopper" was turning it into liquid (I don't know if that was supposed to happen), so I took it out before it was too late and chopped the rest by hand. Chopping by hand meant more time in the kitchen, and plus the burgers were a bit chunkier than I preferred. They were still very good. I added a tablespoon of Egg Beaters to it to make it stick together. It tasted good, and unfortunately nobody in my home wanted to try it, so I was alone in my enjoyment of these burgers (is that really a bad thing?). 

I gave this recipe 5 stars because although the texture was not exactly perfect to me, this is a veggie burger and I realize it isn't supposed to taste like meat.
 
Update: I chopped the vegetables in the blender, which was probably a big mistake because it made it basically liquid. Will chop by hand next time because I don't have a real food processor.

These are great. Didn't want/have breadcrumbs so I pulsed some old fashioned oats in food processor instead (not flour, but no flakes either). When mixture was still too moist, I threw in some oat bran until texture was right. Followed advice and blotted beans of excess water. Puréed veggies in processor, then added beans and pulsed. Freeze. Grill or bake in individual foil packets at BBQ...

These are ridiculously delicious burgers - even my carnivorous friends couldn't get enough of them. Five stars for taste, four stars for the recipe as it stands. As is, the patties are pretty loose and fall apart, even after baking or grilling. I ended up adding an entire cup of bread crumbs and a half cup of oats. The egg held up, and I didn't have to add any more spices (well,  maybe cumin, says the cumin addict...). I also used black beans that I had previously cooked from dried stock and frozen. A great way to use up left-overs! These will definitely become a staple in our home.

A little plain. I loved them though. I used oats over bread crumbs. Next time I will try using bread crumbs. Use less cumin as well. I felt it overpowered the other flavors.

Delicious flavor.  Even with the previous suggestions to drain the onions and peppers and freeze the burgers, they still weren't firm enough for a bun.  I think next time I will put them in a tortillan and make a wrap.

I made mine more simplified with just chopped onion, black beans and all purpose meat seasoning. I also added corn starch to keep them from falling apart.

WOW!!!! This recipe is good just the way it is. It's not Spicy at all and if you wanna make it Spicier like I did, then add 3-4 tablespoons of hot sauce. I did allow the patties to sit in the Freezer for 5 minutes and had no issues with the patty staying together. I will store these in the Freezer on a regular basis for future meals.

My husband and I loved these burgers, they were absolutely delicious.  I had no trouble getting them to stick together.  I did, however, dry the beans off after rinsing them - not sure if that helped.

These were very good!  You could probably make more than 4 patties because I found it was hard to finish 1.  Very filling, even my husband had a hard time finishing 2 (which he normally does easily.) 
I baked them and I will definately try them again but grill them this time.

You have to use 3/4 cup of bread crumbs at least to get it the right consistency.  I formed mine into balls and then smashed them into patties on a stick proof mat and threw them in the freezer.  Left them there until frozen and then cooked on the grill straight with no crumbling.  I liked it better than the beef burger.

This recipe is really great! My husband hates them on buns as burgers, but he LOVES them on rice. He asks for these black bean burgers on rice at least once a week. They do tend to crumble sometimes when cooking, but the flavor is great.

I liked these ok.  Nothing to special.  I wringed out the onion,pepper, garlic in a towel.  Added more bread crumbs.  And I grilled them in a pan.  They held together well.  I also melted a slice of cheese on them and had some avacado, mustard and ketchup.  With these additions I enjoyed them.  Nothing I want to make again soon though.

I used about double the chipotle chili powder and Thai chili sauce, and estimated the bread crumbs to be about 1 to 1 1/2 cups.  Very good! My husband said they were better than his favorite from Chilis.

Delicious! Per recommendations from previous reviews, I made some alterations. I used a food processor to chop up the pepper and onion very fine and then drained the juices. I also rinsed and dried the black beans before mushing. Added 1.5 times the amount of bread crumbs (or oatmeal in my case because I never have bread crumbs) to help the patties stay together. Once I made the patties, I put them in the freezer. Pulled out of the freezer a few minutes before grilling. I sprayed some foil and folded over each individual patty and grilled that way. They stayed together perfectly, and have been delicious each time I have made this recipe. This is quite a bit of mess during the prep (when you have two kids "helping" you), so I always double the recipe and freeze 1/2 of the patties so I can just pull out of the freezer and grill. One of my family's favorite recipes!!

These held together well and had a nice flavor.  I would prefer them to be a little more spicy, so next time I will probably add some crushed red pepper and possible one spicy pepper with the bell pepper mix.

These burgers are awesome! This is the first recipe I tried, and I don't think I would change anything or try another one. I just finely chopped the pepper, onion, and garlic, and mashed it a little bit into the black beans. I have my boyfriend pack them really tight, the way he did it when he worked at 5 guys, and they do not fall apart! You just have to make them super tight. The spices are great and the burgers have as good of consistency as you can get with black bean burgers.

These came out great, and you can customize the seasonings/spices any way you like. If using fresh veggies, you may end up needing an extra 1/8-1/4c bread crumbs to absorb excess water. So easy! I will be making these again!

I'll never buy store-bought veggie burgers again! I've used this recipe as a base for many different burgers.  My personal note: they seem to do  better with a little extra breadcrumbs and a little olive oil added to the mix; the extra breadcrumbs make patties easier to handle and the oilve oil keeps them moist.  that said, you can basically add whatever seasonings you like; Mexican, Italian, Asian, spicy or mild (I always double the recipe and save out a little for my three year old before adding anything too spicy).  I've even made 'meatballs' by putting in Italian seasonings and parm. then rolling them into balls instead of patties. You may need to experiment with cooking times, which will vary depending on the size of the pattie/loaf/balls, but it seems to closely coincide with that of meat dishes of the same ilk.

Excellent texture and taste. I didn't change a thing and even the 8 year old that picks beans out of all meals ate the whole thing. Remember though the size you make them is the size they will remain after grilling.

These are okay...could use a little something. I followed exactly plus added some chopped jalapenos. They didn't fall apart, the texture was fine but they were just a bit boring.

I just made this but tweaked it a little. I added a small can of hot sliced jalapenos, two eggs and 3/4 cup bread crumbs. Delicious!!! I rinsed the beans and let them dry out. I dried the onions and the jalapenos really well also. Good recipe. I will definitely add this to the rotation. Makes 4 hearty patties.

We liked this recipe very much! I would recommend doubling the recipe. I am not a big fan of peppers, so only used 1/2 of what was called for, and my husband, the pepper lover, still liked them. 
No problem with the burgers falling apart, but I did mash all the ingredients together by hand to get them fully incorporated. It really did look a bit like chunky hummus when I was through hand-mixing it. 
I baked mine in the oven in an olive oil coated pan with good results. Excellent with sour cream!

These are so awesome, I can't thank you enough for such a wonderful recipe!  I make these weekly for the family, they are so delicious!  I do add ground flax seed (or flour) to make them a bit easier to put into patties, ~ 1/4 cup, everyone loves them and we arm wrestle for the left overs for lunch the next day!  :-)

As written 4 stars.  1/3 kids found this a little spicy so I will play with the seasoning next time.  Definitely needed to increase the bread crumbs in the mix to get a better consistency.  When baked, did not crisp on the outside, so texture was a little off for the meat-eaters in the crowd.  Would recommend a quick, light fry to get the outside a little crisper.  Definitely serve with toasted buns and lettuce to get a little more texture as well.  Will be adding this to the regular rotation.

We make this recipe regularly.  A little too spicy, so we cut down on the chili powder and eliminate the hot sauce.

This is a great BBB. I subbed a grated carrot instead of the green pepper and used Panko breadcrumbs. I also refrigerated the patties for a couple of hours before baking. These have a great flavor (not too spicy) and texture. I will be making these all the time now.

They make decent sized patties, which surprised me, I tend to do bigger portions.  Yesterday I had this with mustard & ketchup on top, bun-less because I'm trying to not eat so many carbs.  Today I'm eating it with spaghetti sauce and cheddar.  I froze the other 6.  This is a new item to add to my rotation.  I used Thai Sweet Chili Sauce, was out chili pepper so I added a tiny bit more.  It was hot enough, without killing my tummy.  So much better than boca or morningstar.  Will do again.

Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  We preferred it pan fried as to baked but both were great.  We usually keep the "dough" in the fridge and make just what we need at the time because fresh is best! Keeps for at least a week.

I suppose my rating will not compare to others as I have never had a veggies burger before.  I did enjoy the burger but it tasted like a nice side dish on a bun.  If I were to make it again I would change up the spices as I didn't appreciate the chili powder.

I made these according to the recipe. I did not like them at all. I thought they were bland, which is unfortunate because since they got such good reviews, I was sure I'd like them and made a double batch. I gave them 2 stars since they were at least edible.

These weren't bad at all and it was super easy to make! I followed the advice from previous reviews and it's important to strain the pepper, garlic, onion, and black bean mixture! What helped was adding about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs and about 1/4 cup-1/3 cup of oatmeal. It held together really nicely. I also changed up the spices: 1 tbl of chili powder, .5 tbl of paprika, .5 tbl of cumin, 1/2 tsp of garlic pepper, and 1.5 tsp of chili garlic sauce. Sounds like a lot but it didn't over power the patty at all. Will definitely make again!

PS
baked sweet potatoes would be a great side to this dish!

This recipe was tasteless. I will not make it again. Thought the black beans would be, but it is not a keper for us. No offense to the ones who like it.
  I made Roscos Black Bean Brownies once and they were quite good.

These are great to make and freeze for quick lunches. I eat mine topped with hot sauce or salsa, a little bit of melted cheddar, and a smidge of sour cream. Good eaten on and off a roll. I followed others' suggestions and made sure to rinse and dry the beans and strain the onion/garlic/green pepper mixture. Mine stayed together fine. Next time I might make it less dry, add some chili peppers and use it as a burrito filling.

This was a lot like eating fried black beans with cumin. After moving it out of the bun and into a tortilla, it wasn't as bad. I was disappointed, sorry.

Delicious!!  There is a restaurant down the street from me that makes an awesome black bean burger and this one comes super close!!  I added 1/4 to 1/2 C. more breadcrumbs than the recipe calls for so it would hold better and used the whole onion instead of 1/2 of it.  Topped the burger with provolone, onions and avocado - yummy!!  I'll be making this over and over again!

Added 3x the amount of breadcrumbs to get it to hold together.  Decreased the amount of cumin and chili powder by a teaspoon, because of all the reviews, but should have left the recipe as is!  Added fresh cilantro and 1/2 a minced jalapeno, and the patties were STILL a bit bland.  Will make again, but with MORE not less spices. Comparable to store bought black bean burgers, but not better.

Amazing veggie burgers!!  Better than Morning Star burgers.  I love veggie burgers, but I really like to know EXACTLY what is in my food (and save money) which makes this recipe an A+.  This is a seriously delicious, though I did make some minor alterations to make it fit my tastes better

Added 2x the cumin, extra garlic powder ( I love garlic, what can I say), used yellow peppers instead of green (that's what I had on hand) added about 3 slices of bread (crumbled) to give it a better consistancy, added about 3/4 tablespoon chipotle Tabasco, also added a dash of Italian seasoning and various other savory spice mixes to give it a well rounded flavor and instead of baking it, I dipped them in flour and fried them (OMG, delicious!). 

WILL DEFINIETLY MAKE AGAIN!

My 4-year old loved it so that alone says it all!  Easy to make!  I put in 1/4 T chili powder because i was concerned it would be too hot for my son.  1/2 T cumin only and 1/2 T sweet chili sauce.  I did add 1/2 a cup of bread crumbs and thought it was too watery still, so I crumbled in some extra crackers we had on hand.  I agree that the beans need to be drained of excess water, but most importantly, after you have the ingredients mixed up, you have to judge for yourself:  if it's too watery and looks like it might be too hard to hold together, add more to bulk it up!  Next time I'll try adding corn and perhaps different spices.  Have fun experimenting!

These were pretty good but not the best veggie burgers ever. I will try this another time with the green pepper (i left out) and may saute them a little before baking to help with moisture. I also added red pepper flakes. Super easy!

These were so darn tasty!!  I must admit that they were a little tedious to make, solely because I don't have a food processor... so I spent a lot of time chopping the onion and green pepper, but even with the larger pieces of veggies, these were amazing!  My family all greatly enjoyed these!  The BF asked if they were fairly easy to make and I explained the chopping... He was disappointed in the time it took, but on the bright side, I believe we will be investing in a food processor soon!  I used garlic bread crumbs to help enhance the flavor a bit more, and omitted the chili sauce due to the spice level tolerance not being the same for everyone and they still had so much flavor with the cumin and chili power.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

It turned out GREAT! I agree, remove the excess water in the onion/pepper mixture and pat the beans dry (I cooked my own). Add a little more bread crumbs. It was not as firm as I expected and  could have made about 6 patties. Very tasty. I'm so proud of myself on this one. Filling and healthy.

Well, let me just say that these are delicious!!!  I am not a vegetarian, but right now, I am in the process pf doing a detox and I am not allowed to have meat.  These burgers are so good, that when I am done with the detox, I will continue to eat them!  I followed the recipe exactly as it was written because this was my first time making it, and I will not be changing it in the future.  Not unless I want a little more spice!  I warmed up a 10' flour tortilla shell, used some of my Dad's homemade BBQ sauce, lettuce, shredded cheese and bread and butter pickles.  WOW!!  I cant wait to make these for my sister n law who is a vegetarian!  My meat loving kids even loved them!!

my new years resolution is to go vegan so ive been doing it bit by bit.  my friend, who lives a few houses down, has chickens, though, so i do eat eggs from there.  thats what i used in this recipe.  i had to nearly double the amount of breadcrumbs, fried one and then decided i need still more breadcrumbs.  i also added salt and in addition to the chili sauce, i loaded it with sriracha sauce (i really like spicy!) i also added chopped onion and green pepper to the mixture which added a nice texture.  topped with vegan cheese in between two pieces of gluten free toast.  i only wish i had some salsa with this and maybe a slice of avocado.  it made way more than the four servings but now ive frozen them to eat throughout the week and share with friends.

I regularly make these burgers for church potluck. I double or triple the recipe, use lots of breadcrumbs (I seldom measure anything exactly) and bake. Then I place them in a caserole with canned mushroom soup over them and reheat at church. I get lots of compliments and don't get to bring home leftovers.

Excellent recipe, and I hate to be redundant, but really is better than the frozen.  Was too mushy, but as my husband said, it was like a burrito filling.   "Fried" on top of stove in cast iron skillet with very little oil.  Will add more filler next time (flax? oatmeal? brown rice?).  Added frozen roasted corn kernels (Trader Joe's, I keep a bag in the freezer).  Served with an amazing spread we made up with mayo, sour cream, and oven-dried crushed jalapenos from our bumper crop.  When we had zillions of jalapenos, we dehydrated them in the oven then ran them through the food processor.  Nice heat when we need it.  Burger recipe definitely a keeper!

I am new to veggie burgers, but I REALLY like this one. I cut down on the spices because a tablespoon seemed like a lot. Also, I added more bread crumbs because it was a little too wet.

This came out watery (about the consistency of something you could mix into black bean soup). had to add more than twice the amount of beans, extra breadcrumbs and still had to stir in a rice/quinoa/cheese mixture that I blended in the food processor first to get it even close to holding a  patty shape. And even now it's not quite right. A big waste since I added so many more ingredients

These were really good, however, they were so spicy! I am used to some spice in my food, but these were almost too spicy to eat. I even thought about it as I was making them, thinking that 1 tablespoon of chili powder seemed like a lot. Next time I will definitely go lighter on the spices. I made 6 burgers out of mine because 4 made HUGE ones. I calculated each burger at 116 calories! Awesome low cal burger, just be careful and taste the mixture before hand. Thanks for the recipe!!

Fantastic.  We love to freeze these and then take the frozen patties down to the park to grill outdoors.  Yum!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes!!!  I make the recipe exactly as written, but make 6 patties and bake them.  I like them on a quality roll/bread with mayo, lettuce and tomato.  Quite healthy and so yummy.  Thanks for sharing!

I always double the recipe & freeze the extra.  I will never buy store frozen veggie burgers again. These are by far the best I have tasted! 

Sometimes I also add some chopped up celery for a little extra crunch. Other than that I follow recipe exactly! So yummy!

these are my favorites, the store bought version cannot hold a candle to these.  I also used 2 eggs, other than that I followed it to a tee.  I refrigerated the mixture after making and cooked the patties on my stove top griddle.

Carnivore hubby actually admitted to loving a veggie burger!  My only problem was that even with putting twice as much bread crumbs in, the burgers were still mush. That said, the sliders I cooked for the kids were done PERFECTLY so next time I'll just make sliders only and keep the cooking time the same.

Really good.  Needed a little more salt, but that's about it.  I baked it, but I suggest stove top frying pan or grill which is my plan for next time.  Took me less then 10 minutes to prepare and is way better than the frozen kind sold at the stores.

My seriously carnivorous husband said that these are "better than regular burgers." They tasted fabulous! We topped them with avocado. I had a little difficulty with the consistency because I failed to read the directions carefully, and put the beans in the food processor rather than mashing them by hand. The batter was way too mushy to "form" anything. But I treated them like pancake batter, using a larger cookie scoop on an oiled iron skillet. Next time, I'll hope for better consistency (and follow directions!). These will definitely become a regular at our dinner table, and we aren't even vegetarians.

These are RIDICULOUSLY good. I fried these lightly in a pan, and then put Southwestern Ranch on top. Wow, this was the perfect topper for these already super yummy "burgers." Already looking forward to the next time we make these.

Delicious! We used a poblano pepper instead of the green bell pepper, omitted the chili sauce and reduced the spices. Added more bread crumbs and it was perfect. We doubled the recipe and froze the rest for a quick meal later. Thanks for the recipe.

Although slightly better the second day, overall I did not enjoy these and the recipe did not work as written. I had to add a lot more bread crumbs than was called for to even get anything resembling a very sticky patty to put on the baking sheet. I should have added another egg and squeezed out the water from the minced vegetables, but I wanted to rate and review this as it was written. 

The patties were very difficult to turn halfway through the cooking process due to their heavy wetness. It would probably have been easier and less frustrating to just pan fry them. Also, I did not care for the bland flavor or pasty texture. I'd much rather make burgers out of ground seitan (wheat gluten). Easier and tastier.

Pretty good.  Recipe makes 6 burgers.  Drain and rinse the beans first.  I think some fresh cilantro would probably be good.

These are so yummy! I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and drained and dried the beans before mashing and also strained the pepper/onion mixture through a mesh strainer before adding it. I used oats rather than bread crumbs, plus I added fresh cilantro too. First try and they were perfect consistency for forming patties and I cooked them in a cast iron skillet with a little olive oil. Already froze some and will make them again definitely!

Excellent for the family. Fairly simple to prepare. best bet is to broil for the last 1.5 min in the oven to insure the burgers don't come apart. Very pleased with this recipe.

I followed others' advice: cut spices to 1 tsp each; drained the veggies; added 1 minced jalapeno pepper instead of hot sauce, and added extra breadcrumbs and used 2 eggs.  And I pan fried in a tiny bit of olive oil.  OK sounds like a lot of changes but I still think it was tweaks.  They were very tasty (served in a whole wheat pita with fresh avocado slices) but I wasn't thrilled with the mashed bean texture.  Next time I will try adding corn as suggested by another review, and also maybe some cooked brown rice.  With a little extra texture these would be perfect!

Oh my goodness are these fantastic!! I never thought they'd be this good. I've been making falafels lately & love them so I thought I'd try these burgers. I mashed up the beans the day b4 & left them in the fridge. I doubled the recipe, added a 1/2 can of mashed chick peas, a handful of crushed crackers in addition to the bread crumbs. I didn't have any onion so I put about 1/4 c. dried onion in some water to plump them up.  I coated with the breadcrumbs. I fried them in a little oil. 
Served with a sauce I whipped up: mayo, ranch, hot sauce, red pepper, paprika & cumin. Melted provolone & shredded cheddar on top of the burgers, topped with sauce. YUM! 
This will be a regular meal in our house now. I like this much better than regular burgers. Who knew eating meat-free meals could be so yummy?

The taste was exceptional! I used dried beans which of course took much more time. Next time I'll try others' techniques for removing water, as one of them broke apart, and the others were almost on the breaking point. Only alteration was to add jalapenos to the bell pepper/onion mix, and a lot more of the hot sauce...still werent spicy enough for our tastes. Other than slight alterations, the recipe is top notch!

I am a meat eater but am looking to cut calories so I wasn't sure what to expect out of this recipe since I have never had a veggie burger, but I love black beans so I thought I'd give it a try. I thought a whole tablespoon of chili powder and cumin for the amount of black beans/onion/bell pepper was just too much so I scaled that back to about 1 1/2 teaspoons, threw in a couple shakes of Steak N Shake seasoning and just a shake more bread crumbs to form the patties. The patties tasted very good but they taste like chili. They are like if you took chili and made a patty out of it. lol. After one taste of a cooked patty, I knew what to do with it.  I melted a little shredded cheese on top of one and added a little scoop of sour cream to it. These are very good but like I said they taste like chili in a patty. I definately think for my taste that 1 tablespoon of chili powder and cumin would have been way too much. I wanted to still taste the beans and already couldn't with what little amount of seasoning I used. I couldnt image eating this on a bun with lettace and tomatoe but I might try it.

I don't know why, but these didn't stick together and barely any flavor actually cooked through. All I tasted was the green pepper and beans. I think it will be decent when mixed with rice as leftovers.

This was very good! I added a bit of grill seasoning I had on hand, but that was the only change I made.

Loooooved these! I only used one egg and used a cup of bread crumbs like others suggested.  And I put them directly on the grill except I did need to use cooking spray so they would not stick to the grill. Overall a great recipe! I will be making them again!

I took others' suggestions and add two eggs instead of one, and 3/4 cup of bread crumbs instead of 1/2 cup. Delicious!

Excellent, husband-approved black bean burgers.  These had just the right amount of spice and were delicious.  I forgot to drain the pepper, onion, garlic mixture as one of the reviewers suggested so I doubled the breadcrumbs and they held together on the foil fine.  I served them topped with a piece of avocado and a drizzle of sweet chili sauce.  I will definitely make these again. Thanks for the recipe.

I used a mix of dries beans with barley and lentils.  These I cooked, put through the food processor.  Then to the mix I added grated cheeses; the taste was extraordinary.  A real crowd pleaser.  The look was much closer to a beef .  I had made these once before following the recipe precisely.  We like the tweaked version better.

Amazing! I made a few changes according to other reviewers: added 1/4 cup rolled oats, dried the beans, squeezed out the fluids and freezed them a night before cooking.

Also, I used only 1/2 tsp cumin because I don't really like it, didn't have any hot sauce so skipped it, added 1 shredded carrot (drained) and doubled the garlic. I did not use a food processor but a brown mixer, which left chunks of the black beans- I think this was a good call because the burger did not feel like a ball of refried beans, like other reviewers said.. 

Next time I'm probably going to triple the recipe and freeze them to have great veggie burgers on hand..!

1) Rinse, strain, and dry the black beans WELL before mashing.

2) Use mounded 1/4c mix in a burger press *lined with plastic wrap* to get good consistent patties.  If you don't line with plastic wrap the mix will be stuck in the press.

3) Add 1/4c processed carrots and 1 tbsp fresh ginger.

...Delicious, thanks!

I hate when people do this, but I made a few (minor) modifications.  I used red bell pepper instead of green, I cut back slightly on the spices so I could add about a teaspoon of smoked paprika.  And I left out the hot sauce because toddlers were eating this.  I served mine bun-less over arugula with some fancy country ketchup on top.  Divine!  My husband didn't know it wasn't meat until I told him.

These burgers were delicious. Even my Dad who is a big meat eater enjoyed them. Just make sure you drain the beans, because I forgot and the burgers turned out pretty mushy. They tasted great, but they kind of fell apart.

Excellent. I used the same recipe, but it made six burgers instead of four.  If I made only four burgers, they would have been monsters! Definitely will make this again.

Eh. I made mini burgers instead of four large ones, much better. I also added some shredded chicken for my eat nearing fiancé :) she really liked that. I added more latino flavoring which help alot. But I also made some as the original recipe called. I liked the added chicken alot, the veggie Latino one second and the original last. The original called for too much onion and pepper not enough garlic. Next time I'm thinking of grilling the ingredients first. Also I used sesame (1/4tsp) oil on a pan to cook. Thanks for the started recipe :D

I added corn to the recipe.  I didn't freeze the patties before putting them on a George Foreman-type grill, and they squashed a little.  VERY good, though.  I'll freeze beforehand next time.  Can't wait to try some more variations!

I thought these were a very good alternative to a beef burger.  I made this according to the recipe, put in the freezer to firm up and grilled.  Very tasty!

This was a great recipe for my boyfriend (he eats only beef!). I did have to double the beans, because he ate up three burgers quickly! 

He used Steak Sauce instead of Ketchup as a topping!

This is a great snack to have extra to heat up in the oven quickly for hungry husbands, boyfriends, and kids!

This was very good! I made the recipe as it was written and baked them in the oven. They held together very well and had a nice flavor. It will be a good base recipe to experiment with.

Delicious!! I basically followed recipe (substituting red for green pepper, and left out the chili powder/hot sauce b/c I didn't want a spicy burger so added some extra garlic and thyme) and also added bread crumbs until it seemed sticky enough and formed into patties. Turned out fantastic! Froze the leftovers as patties, and they are so easy to just pop out of the freezer and throw on the grill. I agree with others, will not be buying store bought again!!

Wow!!  I made these exactly as the recipe said and they were delicious!!  When I was getting the onion/pepper mix out of the processor I did press each spoonful against the side to squeeze out any extra juice.  Other than that I did nothing special to make them stick together, and I had no problems with them falling apart.  They were perfect!!

Before making this recipe, I never had more than a single bite of a black bean burger. I wasn't very impressed with the one that I tasted. This recipe is delicious! I don't know if all of the measurements wound up being exact, but I did use all of the same ingredients (minus the onion) and added a little extra here and there to taste, adding the egg last. I had no problem with it holding together. I allowed the beans to sit in a strainer for about 10 minutes, and then froze the patties for about 20 minutes while I worked on sweet potato fries. I then grilled them on a George Forman. The patties were fairly spicy and delicious, and I paired them with a homemade avocado spread on a toasted wheat bun with lettuce and thin slice of tomato. Yum!

These burgers had great flavor and are very filling.  The only reason I didn't the recipe 5 stars, is that my husband and I thought they were  a little to soft.  Although, when I microwaved leftovers today, it did toughen up a bit, which actually helped in that department! We'll definitely have them again.

These were delicious - the seasoning is just right! My first attempt followed the recipe exactly - I tried to grill them and they fell apart! This afternoon, I made a few modifications: used red bell pepper, red onion, and homemade wheat breadcrumbs. I sauteed the bell pepper and onion in 1T of olive oil, then mashed the blackbeans with a potato masher. I combined all ingredients (I ending up using 2 slices of bread for the crumbs, which equaled about 1 cup. Cooked in a cast iron skillet with 1 T of olive oil. So good! You've got to try these with pickles and swiss cheese!

I really can't explain the high reviews- this was just a plain old mushy bean burger to me- it did not resemble a typical veggie burger at all.  If you are making this dish you absolutely need to add salt and pepper- which the recipe does not call for. Mediocre at best.

Really delicious flavor!  I added approximately 1/2 cup of leftover brown rice (just to use it up) and used 1/2 cup ground oatmeal instead of the bread crumbs.  I reduced the chili powder and cumin to 2 tsp and omitted the hot sauce since hubby doesn't like his food too spicy.  This recipe is a keeper -- I will be making it again!

Excellent recipe! I always order veggie burgers at restaurants and never thought that I could have something this good at home! The only change I made was using red pepper instead of the green. There is a nice bite to it, but not too spicy. Will definitely make these again.

These were pretty good. I think the chili powder taste was a little overwhelming though. I couldn't really taste the black beans. I would probably reduce the chili powder to 1.5 or 2 tsp. I wouldn't recommend processing the beans as some other raters and myself did. You lose the texture of the beans. Otherwise I enjoyed it.

Delicious! I wanted to try new things for Lint on Fridays and this was a hit.  I didn't have bell peppers so I used canned green chilis that were well drained.  It gave it a nice kick.  I also added two eggs as suggested and added bread crumbs until the mix came together.   I also added a hand full of shredded cheese I had left.   I then formed the patties and put them in the fridge for a few hours.  Served them in a nice burger with the works and avocado.  They are also great in a hot flour tortilla!

I will make these again for sure.

I love vegetarian dishes, but this one just was not good in my opinion.  It needs more veggies.....black beans with bell pepper, onion and spices don't cut it.

Mine came out a bit dry... but I wonder if it is because I forgot to add onions? (didnt have time to run to the store) so I added some onion powder. Other than that I did everything on the recipe except the thai chili sauce (that might be why too) and added some salt to bring out the flavor more. ^^ It tasted good! Hope to make them again. :)

Squeeze the veggies, double the eggs & crumbs = four good size burgers - excellent!  As others suggested, I mixed some adobo sauce with mayo for a topping - wonderful zippiness.

The texture of these was almost gag-worthy, but I didn't dry out the beans like people have suggested here. Definitely do that and add extra breadcrumbs.

This is a good base that I'm looking forward to playing with.  I took everyone's advice about more egg and breadcrumbs, and chilled the patties, baked them, but moved them to a hot skillet for a good sear.  I also cranked up the spice a little bit, because we really enjoy the heat.

This was pretty good. My suggestion to combat the patties breaking up is to not make them too thin or wide. A really thin or wide patty will flex and tear, and will be hard to handle. These are not bad though, and quite economical.

We made these and my boyfriend and I both loved them. I did add extra bread crumbs and egg. We also used foil on the grill to give them a more stable surface since they are a bit sticky to start with. Next time I'm going to shape them as six smaller burgers as the center stayed a little mushy and neither of us could finish them but still awesome dinner! My bf is not even a vegetarian and he loved it too!

I loved it!  I did leave out the hot sauce because I was feeding this to my kids, and it was still yummy. I followed the directions, but added an extra 1/4 cup of bread crumbs because it looked too "wet".   It's a keeper for me.

We loved them!  My daughter and I are spice wimps, so we halved the chili powder and chili sauce.  Also read some other reviews and added extra egg and bread crumbs.  Perfect!  My meat-loving husband even loved them and requested us to make them more often!

These taste great and my 2yr old LOVES them, but they're awfully crumbly.  I managed to hold them together by melting cheese on top.  They're also REALLY filling.  If they kept their shape, I'd give more stars.

Not knowing what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised how easy and good they were. I drained the beans and mashed them with a fork and added a tablespoon or more of salsa.(I didn't have the chili sauce) I chopped 1/2 orange pepper, 1/2 onion and three cloves of garlic in my blender. Added the cumin and chili powder. Added that mixture plus the egg to the beans and then added 1/2 cup bread crumbs. I also added some fresh chopped parsley. Mixed it and formed patties. They formed well and did not break apart. I baked them as directed on lightly oiled parchment ... 8 minutes each side. Very tasty, very simple!

YUMMY Burger!!!! The only thing I did different was add a chopped Jalapeno to the burger and top it with SPICY guacamole. One thing I would recommend is quarter the burger size into slider size. That way they will be crispy on the outside and not to squishy / too moist on the inside. AWESOME burger though. And that is coming from meat eaters. THANKS SOOOO Much to the original recipe poster.

I doubled the bread crumbs and still had some difficulty keeping them together. The taste was good, though. I also like that I can make a bunch and stick them in the freezer for a quick dinner.

Great recipe! Followed it right down to the details and the burgers came out awesome. It's also a great base recipe to experiment with -- change the spices, substitute different veggies, etc. Instead of baking or grilling, I found I like 'em fried in a little canola oil 'til the edges get crispy.

These taste great! I can't seem to make them quite right, the texture is always a little too thin, but I'm going to keep trying until I get them right! I also add half a can of corn.

I'm clearly in the minority here - but I did not care for these.  Like a previous reviewer said...these were SO dry.  Not spicy at all - not sure what I did wrong, because the entire recipe was followed to a "t".  I was expecting a juicy black bean burger with a kick, like you get in a restaurant.  Not even close.  So disappointing.

I really enjoyed these hommade burgers, i made them on a non-stick skillet with parchment paper- about 6-7 minutes per side. I also added corn which gave it some extra flavor. My husband doesn't like anything remotely spicy so I left out the chilli and it was still great!

Here's my experience with this burger-Delicious!!! The mixture was a bit wet after i added the veggies but a little more bread crumbs fixed that. All in all a good pattie [and I have never eaten black bean before!!!!]

I had no business starting this recipe...no black beans, no bread crumbs, no green (or red) pepper, so I did what I always do..improvise.  Cut cumin to 1 tsp because I felt that a tablespoon was overkill.  Used a can of red kidney beans, drained and rinsed.  Used instant masa instead of bread crumbs.  Shaped into six thin patties and fried in a nonstick skillet in just a whisper of oil.  I had some homemade whole wheat buns to use and we topped the burgers with some pickled onion slices, mayo, dijon, and spinach leaves.  My daughter and I both gave this a thumbs up.  The patties weren't mushy at all and this is a great vegetarian dish.

Amazing recipe! I serve it with a slice of cheese and some guacamole on top. Great, great recipe as is, or add more garlic or chili powder for a stronger taste.

I prepared the burgers by cutting up the onion, bell pepper and garlic with a knife. I also decided to cut up some mushrooms then I added all of the veggies to the mashed beans. Then, continued with the egg, and seasonings. I didn't have Thai chili sauce, and I am not crazy about hot sauce, but I did use some cayenne pepper.  I cooked them in a skillet with olive oil and they turned out wonderful. They stayed together pretty well.  I was very pleased. I will definitely be making them again.

This is definitely a good veggie burger and one of the best I've ever had! Went well with homemade sweet potato fries too. Followed the recipe pretty close but I definitely agree that you should add more bread crumbs and oats to hold it together. I believe we used a 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and a 1/2 cup of oats and it held perfectly. Great recipe!

fantastic!  used red bell pepper instead of green; added an extra clove of garlic; added 1/4 bunch cilantro; added salt & pepper to taste before forming; broiled burgers at the end with the buns to get crispy.  served with wheat buns, lettuce tomato, cheese, ketchup, & mustard.

These were fantastic. Even my carnivore boyfriend loved them. I listened to some of the comments and used 2 eggs instead of 1, and also added more breadcrumbs. I also squeezed out the excess liquid from the onion mixture and as much as I could from the beans. I cooked them in the oven and at the end I shallow pan fried them for about 30 seconds on each side. I topped them with avocado, pepperjack cheese, and I made a little chipotle mayo. Used a few tbls of mayo and liquid from chipotle in adobo, and also added chipotles diced. So delicious. Thanks Laurenmu!

They were ok. I used freshly made black beans. For a veggie burger they were better than expected, I guess, but they were very difficult to keep together even though I was sure to remove as much excess water as humanly possible.

I could only give this four stars because made as is it would have never worked.  There was far too much liquid between the onion, pepper, and beans and half a cup of breadcrumbs didn't touch that.  Luckly, I read the reviews so followed another's advice and used oats to thicken.  Also needs quite a bit more seasoning like garlic powder and onion powder.  Overall a good base recipe.

These are truly addictive!  I followed the suggestions for getting them to stay together (rinsing and drying the beans, draining the liquid from the peppers, adding another egg)and I cook them slowly in a frying pan to dry them out a little more.  I sometimes throw in other veggies; corn is really good in these.

Made these today and followed Kelly's suggestions to add more breadcrumbs and made sure to remove moisture from the beans and the pureed mixture of pepper, onion and garlic. Worked great! I also made my own breadcrumbs.  Everything tasted so much more fresh and healthier than store-bought. Also will come to be much cheaper. Next time I'm tripling the recipe to freeze them!

I am not a vegetarian, but this was awesome! Other than the texture, it was just like a regular burger off the grill, the  only changes i made was to saute the onion, pepper and garlic first then add to the beans. i also added some Worcestershire sauce for a meaty taste.

these were great, and super easy if you get the frozen onion/celery/carrot chopped mix.  doubled recipe and made substitutions with what i had -- ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs, a little crushed red peppers instead of chili powder.  froze the patties on wax paper and they cooked up perfect in the oven.  served with avocado, sprouts and ceasar dressing on flat bread.  can't wait for leftovers!

This recipe is awesome!  I will definitely make these again and again.  Changes that I made: I used 2 cans of black beans drained and rinsed, only 1 clove of garlic, less cumin, oatmeal instead of bread crumbs, and I added 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar.    Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

These were suprisingly good! My hubby and I aren't vegetarians, we just like healthy and inexpensive meals.  This recipe fits both those!  We doubled and followed the recipe only making one change---more breadcrumbs.  We made them the night before, refrigerated, and cooked the next day.  They held together wonderfully and created a sense of eating a hamburger.  We topped with Pepperjack cheese, lettuce, and chipotle mayo.  We will definitely use this often.

These were awesome.. I've made a double batch twice now. Both times I followed the recipe exactly as it was written except I used 3 eggs (again for a double batch) and I strained the chopped onion, green pepper, and garlic at the suggestion of another commenter. These are also great with a chipotle ranch/mayo. Gonna make a bunch soon and freeze them :)

So good! I added 100% more breadcrumbs, and about half the amount of cumin, and it held together nicely. Next time, I will make smaller patties so that the inside is less gooey. But the flavor was phenomenal, I can't wait to make this again!

These veggie burgers were fantastic!  We added mayo, sliced tomato, lettuce and kosher pickles to the bun to make it seem evenmore like a beef burger.  We baked them but I can't wait to try them grilled so they pick up some smoky flavors from the charcoal.  Thanks Laurenmu!

I eat frozen veggie patties quite often and this was my first time actually making them. I added corn (as someone suggested) and BBQed them on foil.  Very good! It was easy to make and I froze the extra ones so I can enjoy them later :)

OMG this was amazing!! Even my 9 year old nephew asked for seconds. Topped it with baby bella mushrooms, marinated in the same mixture as the Portobello Mushroom Burgers recipe, and grilled onions. I am the only pescatarian in the house, but now we have a  strictly veggie dinner night, since I made these!!!

Great thing to add to BBQ for veggie (and non veggie) friends!  Tofu dogs are pretty gross and I dont want to serve frozen pre-made patties. I made mixture the night before, minus the hot sauce and bread crumbs (red bell pepper instead of green), then added 3/4 c bread crumbs and 2 T of the green tabasco at the last minute.  I made them into mini-burgers and grilled them on my tabletop grill/pannini press just like any old burger. They held together great and everyone who ate them complemented them. Great with pepperocini peppers, salsa, and a little cheese.

My first and only veggie burger, and I am okay with never having another!  These are great and soooo easy to make.  I use panko breadcrumbs (and usually more than the recipes calls for) and Tiger Sauce (haven't found a chili sauce I like).  Serve on a whole wheat bun with lettuce, onion, swiss cheese and a small amount of spicy mayo (I make my own with regular mayo + cayenne and garlic powder).  Yummy and good for you too!

I made these vegan by substituting 1 tbsp ground flaxseed and 3 tbsp water for the egg. I found the burgers to be a bit bland, but this will be easy to fix next time with more spices. They held together very well.

We had a great black bean burger in Scotland (go figure!) and I wanted to try make my own.  This recipe worked out wonderfully!  I did use both red and green bell peppers then added half a can of corn.  We also like it spicy, so I doubled the chili powder and hot sauce.   If you melt a little monterery jack on top and add sliced avocados, you have a meal.  They are delicious and very filling.

Warning- you will be shocked by how delicious these burgers are!!!  I didn't have any trouble with the burgers falling apart- one suggestion- skip step 2, and add the beans (strained and rinsed) into the food processor after step 3.  Pulse until well mixed.  Add more breadcrumbs if they are too watery to form a decent patty.  You can play around with the seasoning- I omitted the hot sauce and half of the chili powder, and added other seasonings.  So healthy and delicious I'd give it 10 stars if I could!

These were absolutely delicious. Veggie burgers are new to me, and what an impression this recipe made... Guess you really don't need meat to have a 'ham'burger. :) My body just felt so good after eating this. It's wholly satisfying. I put some sliced sharp cheddar, some parmesan, a bunch of pickles, and some mustard and ketchup on a whole wheat bun and it couldn't be beat. Follow it up with some minty tea and you'll be in heaven... The best part? I doubled the recipe and I have TONS of leftovers.

Was worried about the consistency of these burgers and for good reason. It was like eating a refried bean sandwich. After I tested one added some rice and shredded carrots, which helped some but not enough. Will have to use the rest as bean burritos. Obviously, a recipe for many I just didn't care for them.

I was a little disappointed in these, since they had such rave reviews.  That being said, I think I will try them again, with a couple of suggestions reviewers made.  If you plan to make these, definitely use two eggs!  I'm also going to use more chili powder and hot sauce, because we like things with a little more of a kick.

I followed the exact ingredients of this recipe.  The only thing I changed was the method.  On the RE Marcella told me to mince my veggies in the food processor and then just throw the beans in too and pulse them until I had the right consistency.  So I did just that.  I have to admit, all the reviews scared me with their watery vegetables and the patties that wouldn't hold their shape.  I did not have that problem at all!  Mine made beautiful patties and held together quite well.  I baked them 12 minutes on parchment paper and then flipped them and baked 12 more minutes.  A very enjoyable nutritious, healthy burger. ***The second time I had to bake them longer, long enough to get a crisp crust on each side.

I am sorry! I don't think I ever gave a bad review because taste is so subjective but this does not work. I sprayed a nonstick pan with pam and it still stuck! I was so excited to try them and I just ended up with a mushy sticky mess.

I followed the instructions, but omitted the bell peppers since I did not have any. I don't know if it's because of not using the peppers, but my burgers came out too dry. Otherwise, the taste was good. Perhaps, next time I'll change it up a bit and add some moisture somehow.

These were fantastic! If you like black beans, you will definitely like these. They were a bit crumbly, so I served them in a pita. I made a tahini sauce to go with them and it went really well. I only had half the bread crumbs called for, so I used half oatmeal. I'll probably just use all oatmeal next time. Thank you for the new staple in my diet!

Yum! I forgot to drain and strain and just added breadcrumbs until the mixture held together.  I coated both sides with olive oil and grilled on aluminum foil.  No more frozen veggie burgers at our house!  Thanks!

I enjoyed this recipe a lot...the rest of my family wouldn't even try them, but I didn't expect that this recipe would appeal to everyone.  I would make these again, but I'll play around with the seasonings as I am not a big fan of cumin.  I reduced the cumin to 1 tsp, but next time I'd eliminate it, add a little black pepper, and increase the Thai chili sauce.  I used Safeway Nut and Grain bread to make my breadcrumbs, and I liked having little bits of nuts in the burgers as well.  My mixture was very liquid (I blotted my drained beans with a paper towel) so I just poured it into 4 little, greased foil trays that I made and baked it without flipping.  It resembled a vegetarian meatloaf slice.

Absolutely delicious! All my kids ate them, even the 2yr. old. They were a little hard to flip while baking and fell apart a little but overall, can't complain. Will not buy store bought again.

These were decent veggie burgers, but were very thick and dense. You must certainly love black beans to love the flavor of these burgers, but otherwise they were a good alternative to a frozen veggie burger.

These were delicious! I followed the ingredients and amounts exactly. Squeezing out the juice of the pepper and onion, and blotting the excess water off the beans as I read in other reviews really helped keep them from falling apart.

Excellent base recipe!  I chopped up about 5 white mushrooms and sauteed them in butter with the garlic and onions.  I added a little bit of olive oil and after cooling off I added to the bean mixture.  No problem with them falling apart, I didn't even have to freeze them.  Excellent, excellent...Thank YOU!!!

Excellent black bean burgers!  I have been making a version of these for many years, but there were some problems with the old recipe I had used and I was looking for one that was better.  This is it!   I was in a hurry, so I skipped chopping the veggies and instead used a fresh salsa (squeezed very dry).  With that step, these were in the oven in ten minutes flat.  Super quick and easy!  I did not have any problem with them falling apart, and the texture was perfect--not too moist, not too dry.  I served them with a lime-cumin mayo on the homemade burger buns from this site, with lettuce and tomato.  Yum!  Will definitely make these again.  Thanks!

These tasted AWESOME - loved the spices! However, the texture was only ok. Next time I might try to make them thinner to see if they crisp up. I used 2 eggs and cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs because I was out. 5 stars for flavour, 3 for texture. I'll try them again for sure, thanks! **EDIT** I had to up my rating after eating one cold the next day. The texture was much better - not as soft, more like a store-bought burger but with a WAY better flavour!

I 'hate' veggie burgers and I can't get enough of these!! The key is in the onion/ green peper/ red peper mix; use a whole onion and two pepers and you won't reget it!!

This was SUCH a great recipe! I followed the recipe exactly, except for a few things. As others suggested, I rinsed the beans thoroughly and dried them with a paper towel. I added about 1/3 a can of corn, and used red pepper instead of green. I used my Slap Chop to do the onions and red pepper and this worked SO well. Before I added the red pepper, I squeezed them of their juices. you must eliminate as much water as you can. From doing this, I found I only needed 1 egg - others mentioned they needed 2. I formed the patties and put them in the freezer for about an hour to make handling easier. I grilled them on the BBQ on tin foil as suggested - worked great, even had grill marks like real burgers.   Instead of using ketcup and mustard and regular burger toppings, I used homemade guacamole (I figured this would go since the burgers have a bit of a tex mex flavour). The guac really made it! SO GOOD!!! I also served the burgers on those new whole grain thin buns. Was delish.   Thanks for such an awesome recipe! I'm not a vegetarian... but this will definitely be a staple in my house!

This is a great recipe and I enjoyed the burgers A LOT even though I'm not a vegetarian.  However, I did make a few alterations.  As suggested by other reviewers I rinsed and slightly dried the beans before mashing as well as refigerated the formed burgers for several hours.  I was feeding these to young children so I skipped the hot sauce and added ketchup and worchestershire instead.  Also halfed the amount of cumin and chili powder which I definitey recommend as it was sufficient.  Corn also adds a nice sweet element.

These are excellent!  They are very filling and tasty.  I used more bread crumbs than the recipe called for and have made them many times with a variety of vegis mixed it.  We prefer them bbq's on foil for a more hamburger taste.

I tried this recipe because my BF loves Black Beans (I could take or leave them), but I absolutely LOVED this receipe. I wish I could have given this 10 stars, that's how good they were! Don't be squimish, give this a try, you'll be glad you did. Oh, I added a few more sprinkles of bread crumbs and they came out perfect!

YUM. We liked using the oats instead of breadcrumbs, and we put the mixture in the freezer for about ten minutes to let it harden first. I think I'll use parchment paper or something next time, they stuck to the pan for sure-even with olive oil on it. We also used dry beans we had already cooked and cooled. We ended up putting it all in the blender and adding oats till we like the way it looked.

This was my first veggie burger and I was shocked at how close it comes to tasting like a real burger! I loved it and so did my family. I followed directions except I cooked my own black beans and I didnt have hot sauce ;-( Try it you wont regret having this for dinner!

Delicious! I baked instead of grilling and did not put anything in the food processor, rather I finely chopped the peppers, used onion powder instead of fresh onion and used pre-minced garlic. These are a perfect addition to my "Meatless Monday" recipe list!

Very good and easy to make. My wife and I are both vegetarian and we liked this recipe. Next time we are going to try to add different vegetables - maybe corn or minced mushrooms, squash, or broccoli.

Awesome recipe. I did everything almost exactly as described and it came out wonderful. The only things I added were about 1 tsp of Liquid Smoke to the mixture, because I like that extra smoky flavor, and I added hot sauce, not thai chili sauce. Magnifico!

The texture of this burger is great and it mixes up and cooks well--and looks beautiful.  With all of the onion, garlic and spices I added, I was very surprised at how bland it turned out.  I used beans dried beans, so perhaps it was lacking salt that you can get from canned?  I will certainly make this again, but maybe add more hot sauce and chili powder.  Thanks!

Great! Double recipe and it made 7 large patties. I uniformly scooped out 1/2 cup per pattie. However, to get it firm, I had to cook it easily twice as long to get a nice crust on the outside (I baked it). I would also recommend serving it with guacamole as a topping. Or thousand island dressing. We only had ketchup onions and lettuce. The ketchup masks the great flavor you get from these burgers!

Absolutely FANTASTIC, I followed the other gal that gave the order to mix everything (also drain well) onions, peppers, garlic, breadcrumbs (3/4c), 2 eggs, spices THEN BEANS.  It was SO FIRM they were like a regular burger!  We are HOOKED! YUM!

You are absolutely right when you say I will never buy frozen veggie burgers again. My family absolutely loved these! The flavor was great and the texture was better than I expected. The only thing I think I might do differently is add the black beans to the food processor after pulsing the garlic and onions instead of mashing them with a fork because the kids weren't crazy about the texture. I loved it, though!

I am not a vegetarian. My neighbor however is. I was experimenting the other night and attempted this recipe. I found it to be to runny. Soooo.. I started adding rolled oats a little at a a time until I got the concistancy I was looking for. No to bad. I am VERY impressed. Took 3 of the 4 patties over to my neighbor. The said they were better than the store bought ones.

I'm sorry but this just didn't do it for us.  First of all my boyfriend hated it but that was to be expected as he's a meat lover.  I did add bacon for him too!  He actually took the patty off and ate it alone.  Secondly I actually LOVE veggie burgers but the texture and the flavor just didn't do it for me. I think maybe a grain based recipe would be better.  Sorry! I wanted to like this so much!

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe, but only added 1.5 tablespoons of cumin and chili powder.  We were very skeptical about this recipe, but the burgers are delicious.  This is definitely going to be a "do again" recipe.

My husband and I loved these burgers. We had them last night for supper and paired them with onion rings and dark beer. YUM!  Because we don't eat eggs, I used ground flax seed and water in place of the egg. This worked well. Because I had no crumbs, I used crushed saltines. We like our burgers very thin, so I had lots of mixture left. I have two burgers in the oven right now for my lunch and it looks as though I have enough for two more burgers. So, for us, the mixture made 8 burgers. We will definitely have these again!

My boyfriend is a weight lifter who believes vegetarian meals are for losers. He not only ate these burgers with gusto, but asked me to make them again. I found that cooking them on the griddle helped them hold together better than in the oven.

This is a very good recipe that allows for any modifications you want.   I left out the green pepper and added curry instead of the chili sauce. I fried them in oil and they were delicious!   I think the reviewer who said the beans need to be as dry as possible was right.

Mmmmmm... very good!  I did make a few changes, though.  I, being a garlic lover, nearly doubled the garlic which gave it a nice flavor.   I didn't have hot sauce so added some taco seasoning, pepper, and garlic powder.  I also used 3/4 c. of oats instead of bread crumbs, and they worked really well.  I found, however, they needed to be baked a few minutes longer.  They tasted good but not exceptional, the reason I am giving this 4 stars. I'll add more spices next time. Everybody loved them, I will definitely make them again!

I absolultely loved the flavor of these, but they were mushy even after cooking them for an additional 5 minutes on each side.  I used fresh spelt bread crumbs, so perhaps that was the problem.  Next time, I will try toasting the crumbs thoroughly to dry them out first.  Even though I was the only one in the family who liked these, I will definitely be trying them again.  I'll just wait until I'm the only one home!

I made these exactly according to the recipe, and they were just awful.  I've never had a veggie burger, so I don't have anything to compare it to.  But, we didn't end up eating these.

Added hot sauce to give it more of a kick. MUCH better than the frozen burgers.

I really enjoyed these! I topped the burgers with caramelized red onions and avocado - delicious!

This recipe is pretty good. The only changes I made was to use red pepper and dice it finely, sautee the diced onion prior to mixing. I didn't have any garlic or chili sauce. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I think I will use a little less cumin next time, as I found it to be a little overpowering. Also, the bread crumbs I used were a little too fine, which resulted in a gummy texture. I will try another reviewer's suggestion of oats, or crispier bread crumbs. I didn't have a problem rolling these into patties, but they did come out a little dry. I associate this with the bread crumbs. Topped burger with cheese and avacodo. Mmm. Great healthy recipe!

My husband and I are new to the vegetarian world so we are looking for new recipes.  This one was outstanding!  We both loved them.  I followed others advice to dry the beans, drain the onion pepper mixture, and use 2 eggs.  The burgers stayed together very well.  We will definately make this again.

these burgers lacked taste and jesty flavor...they didnt stick together very well so i would recomend straining the vegtables before adding and maybe freezing before grilling......but there were not great and i would choose a real hamburger over them anyday.......

At first I thought the mixture was too moist, but it firmed up in the oven. My husband, who is usually skeptical about vegetarian entrees, LOVED this. I'm not big on spicy, so I cut down the spices to about 1 t. each and it still tasted great.

Amazing.  These are easy to make and so good.  Freeze well, too.  Different brands of beans made them look a bit different.  If they are too wet from veggies, just add more bread crumbs.  Otherwise they won't bake well and will fall all over(from experience).

YUM!  I had leftover black beans so I made these last night--they're so easy to make and tasted great on a bun with lettuce, cheese, and mayo. I didn't have chili sauce so I threw in barbecue sauce instead.  The burger mush was a bit loose at first so I just kept adding breadcrumbs.  The rest are in the freezer and I hope to make more soon!

3/13/11 Made these again.  drained the beans really well and dried them before mashing.  Cut up 3 slices onion, 4 slices red pepper (frozen) and two large baby bella mushrooms into very small pieces, then dried with a paper towel.  mashed up beans in hand food processor with chili powder, garlic powder, cumin, and taco seasoning.  Added 2 ketchup packets.  Mixed in egg, then veggies, then 2.5 capfulls of breadcrumbs (~ 1/2 cup).  Made 6 patties.

These were very good!  Made as written and next time I might go a little lighter on the chili powder, it's all I tasted.  Had no trouble getting them to stay together.  Very glad I tried it - so much cheaper than buying the boxed black bean burgers and I can adjust the spices next time!  Thanks for sharing!

I used egg replacer (Ener-G Egg Replace to be exact). Added a handful of corn and sliced up a jalapeno pepper and omitted the cumin. I patted dry the onions & peppers like someone suggested. I used the exact amount of bread crumbs it called for and they turned out super yummy. They fell apart a bit when flipping in the oven so I will use more than 1 (fake) egg next time to ensure they stick.  I will make these again but with more egg replacer!

I made with ingredients exactly as written, except I used a potato-based egg substitute due to an egg allergy.  My 7-year-old daughter and I loved these burgers! My husband, not so much, but I would have been shocked if he did. Don't go by him, though. I baked the burgers, and they kept their shape beautifully, perhaps because I took the advice of others and made sure the beans and the onions were well dry before mixing.  I had a couple left over, so I froze them. Had a frozen one today, and I think it was even better! Will definitely make this again.

I used kidney beans, made my own bread crumbs, added some rolled oats, used two eggs, and changed a few other things based on what I had around. These are excellent! I recommend topping them with barbecue sauce and eating them bun-less. I made six patties instead of four.

THIS IS DELICIOUS! Always wanted to try to make my own veggie burgers and I definitely found the right recipe! I made these right after coming home from grocery shopping and could not find the cumin! so I had to leave it out.It was still great, but next time I will be adding the cumin since my roommate found it under the table while we were eating  them! haha

Good recipe. I liked the burger with some BBQ sauce on top. I did not have any trouble keeping the patty in one piece when I followed reviewers suggestions below (to drain the beans and keep all the veggies dry).

I think our tastes are just much much different than everyone else's? We had to fry after we baked and they still wouldn't stay together. It tasted like mush badness. My bf didn't like the cumin in it. I didn't like the beans. It didn't really stay together at all. We now refer to this as the smooshed bean recipe. We are avoiding black beans for awhile now.

These were really tasty.  I had to use at least double the amount of bread crumbs to get them to hold together and took others suggestions about chilling them before cooking.  They were just a bit dry, but I smeared some may & ranch dressing on them and it moistened them up.  I prefer to eat them without a bun.l

Best burgers on the planet. I've made these multiple times- using whole wheat ritz rather than bread crumbs, & I don't tend to use the green bell pepper. Everyone must try these! They also freeze well.

This was just ok. While I do like cumin, a tablespoon was way too much. It was very overpowering. I didn't have trouble keeping them together, but I added a 1/4 cup more breadcrumbs and an additional egg yolk to make sure I didn't have that problem. I also felt the patties were too thick. If I ever make this again, I will make twice as many patties so that they are much smaller.

We absolutely loved these burgers.  They freeze easily (layered between sheets of parchment or wax paper) and we've cooked them in a pan with no stick cooking spray as well as baked them directly from the freezer.  Thanks for this great recipe!  Can't wait for summer to try them grilled as well.

Pretty good recipe, will continue to revise it. I did not freeze before cooking and might try this next time. I substituted a cup of brown rice for the bread crumbs and used egg substitute. Also baked longer than it said, and with the rice, I was able to make 8 patties which reduced the calorie count.

I may be rating this too tough, comparing it to a good hamburger, which I'd much rahter be having, but am trying to avoid for health reasons. It wasn't bad, and I did try to follow the recipe exactly, but the overwhelming flavor that I had with this burger was of black beans.  Not necessarily bad,  not not what I was hoping for or expecting.

Best recipe ever! I too added about 1/4 cup of frozen corn to the mixed. I was nervous when I started forming the patties since the mixture was super slimy and sticky. But I formed the patties anyway, placed them on my stoneware pan and baked. I added about 15 minutes total of bake time because my patties were extra thick. They turned out great dispite the slimy start and I will be make these many more tmes. Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

Okay, I  am in so happy that this recipe is everything and more than I could have hoped for.  I am pretty new to burger substitutes, so I was a little nervous. This recipe is amazing! My picky carnivorous husband gobbled one down with cheese as soon as I took them out of the oven. They smelled so good! I did make some minor changes...  I was out of chili powder so I added a dash of Tabasco, 1/8 tsp paprika and a dash of cayenne pepper along with the Thai chili sauce and cumin. The burgers were terrific this way so I doubt I will  ever make them with chili powder. Also I used Sarah Lee 45 cal bread for my crumbs to save a few calories.I sprayed the burgers with a little Pam to prevent sticking. I baked them at 375 for 10 min on each side. Mine held together fine just be careful. Let them sit for a few minutes and they should be fine. Thanks for the recipe. I will definitely make these again and again! Freeze the leftovers!

We are trying to eat healthier and gave these a try.  They were pretty tasty.  Reminded me of chili though since they had a strong cumin/chili powder taste.  Might cut back on those next time.  Worth making again!

I have never eaten a store bought veggie burger, so I have no point of reference, but these were awesome!  I used black beans I had already cooked and frozen, didn't use any green pepper because I didn't have it, and used 1 1/2 tsp chili powder because I had no cumin.  Had no problems with consistency as others mentioned.  I sauteed them in cooking spray in my non stick pan and they were done in minutes!  Probably took 20 minutes from finding this recipe until I had them on the table!  I'm going to mix up a huge batch and put them in the freezer for easy grabbing.

Quite surprised with these after I really BAD incident with another recipe.  These are great! I'm going to try to pass them off to the kids with some cheese on them.  I added a little mushroom and replaced the breadcrumbs with oats.

I didn't have a problem with the burgers sticking together, I made sure to dry the beans after I rinsed them but didn't strain the garlic/onion/pepper before adding it.  I did add some extra bread crumbs to compensate (only about 1/8 cup).  They tasted good but the texture is too mushy to go on a burger - it squeezed off the edges of the bun as I was eating.  My husband said not to make them again, he felt like he was eating a burrito on a bun.   I might make them again just for myself for lunches but maybe put it in a wrap or play around with the texture more.

Delicious and filling.  We like to add a 4oz can of mushrooms, chopped up, and then melt a slice or two of cheese (provolone or cheddar) on top during the last few minutes of cooking, and serve with extra hot sauce.  Always a win.

The reason I rated so low is I don't find this recipe to be good for veggie burgers.  I've tried it twice now; the 1st time it was very runny and ended up using it as stuffing for tacos like another user suggested.  The 2nd time; I managed to get the mixture dry enough by following some of the other suggestion on the board.  However, I still find it too mushy for a veggie burger; this is best for making tacos or tortilla stuffing but not for veggie burger making.      As for the veggies to stuff; I used onions, celery and red pepper mixture which worked well and the hot sauce is the right amount; just enough to give it a kick.  I also recommend to freeze before cooking to keep it from falling apart.

I made these vegan by omitting the egg and adding 2 tablespoons of whole wheat flour to make the whole mixture come together.  If you omit the egg like I did the first time, you'll end up with really mushy batter (like mashed potatoes).  I fried them in olive oil for a special treat.  I didn't have any hot sauce on hand, so I added ketchup instead, which might not be the best substitute, but the burger didn't lack any flavour.  Instead of garlic, I added a tsp of granulated garlic for more subtle taste.  Very good.  I think I might even add vegan steak spices in next time for some punch.

Very tastey, I made a double batch and froze the leftovers - they were perfect for a quick meal. I don't have a food processor, so I just diced the veggies, which came out fine in my opinion - but I don't like smooth veggie burgers that pretend to be hamburgers anyway.

They are way too big! Make them half the size and it won't take you forever to cook them! The flavor was good, but when you have such a large burger it is overwhelming. Make them fairly flat and reduce each burger size to 1/2 of what the recipe says :)

I made these for a 3-day detox diet I'm doing. I substituted rolled oats instead of the bread crumbs, only because I can't have certain grains. They are delicious. I topped with taco style lentils & rice- even better! The kids like it, too. Saving this one for future, detox or not!

I made these the way it was written the first time and they were very good. However, I have since then made some changes that made them fabulous for my tastes. I did add an extra egg, I don't put in the fresh veggies I use powdered to flavor(just easier for me) I also changed the spices to better suit the flavor I was looking for. I am not vegetarian, I just wanted a healthier substitute for my primary addiction(cheeseburgers) as I am on a strict diet now. I use liquid smoke, worchestershire sauce, and beef bouillion to flavor the burgers to get a beefier flavor. I also plan to use oat flour instead of bread crumbs next time I make these to make them even better for you. Hopefully they will still turn out good. These satisfy my craving for a burger every time, and this is healthy to boot. LOVE and highly recommend this recipe even for meat lovers like me.

Used panko as that's all I had.  Other than that, I followed everything else.  I found tht their was WAY too much cumin for our tastes.  We like cumin but this seemed overpowering.  I didn't have any trouble with them falling apart.  However, I had made them earlier in the day and they sat in the fridge for a few hours before dinner time.  Not sure if this helped them stay together or not.

This burger is excellent! The only change I make is to use red peppers instead of green. They freeze well, so I usually make a double or triple batch and freeze what I don't use. I have made them on several occasions and all of my family and friends loves them. My meat-loving husband doesn't even complain when we have these for dinner.  I will never eat another veggie burger; this one tops them all!

I loved these burgers though I changed the recipe a bit. I'm vegan so I used Ener G egg replacement for the egg, then instead of bread crumbs I used a mixture of corn meal, quick rolled oats and 5 soda crackers crumbled. Then I added Italian seasoning. They stayed together fine for me.

These were great burgers.  Made one change; I'm not a huge fan of green peppers, so I substituted with a jalapeno.  At Trooworld's suggestion, I served these on whole wheat buns with pepper jack cheese, avocado slices and roasted red peppers.  Wonderful!  Thanks for a great veggie burger, Lauren!

Just made these for dinner. TERRIFIC! Best black bean burger recipe by far. Just press the onions and green peppers into the sieve to release the juices. I followed the recipe step by step. I will make again.  Yummy.

I added some cheddar cheese, microwaved to set the egg then wrapped it in a tortilla then I toasted it all in a frying pan. I heeded the previous post that said to strain the veggies and dry the beans and the texture was great.

Very yummy!  I made them for my DH's mom, and she loved them!  We don't have a grill, but I baked them in the oven for 22 minutes at 375 degrees: 10 minutes on one side, then 12 on the other.  I'll be making these for my own mom next!  Thanks for a great recipe.

These tasted good.  I think the trick is to not over process your veggies.  You just want them finely chopped not pureed (I did mine a little to long).  I also froze them before cooking which helped keep them together.

These burgers are very tasty, especially with tomatoes, cheese, and mushrooms! I substituted kidney beans for the black beans, and they still tasted great. My only problem was that they were a little too wet before they were cooked, which made it a bit difficult to make the mixture into burgers (even though I thoroughly dried the beans after rinsing and added extra breadcrumbs).

These were super good! Really really pleased with how they turned out. Very flavorful and filling, leave you satisfied. I put them on toasted whole wheat buns. I followed the advice of "Kelly" who left a review on how to keep the burgers from falling apart, and they came out perfect. So definitely do what she suggests because you won't regret it! :-)Great recipe!

These are very good and they are easy to grill. I made sure to  keep adding bread crumbs until they were nice and solid. I also took the advice of others and drained out any liquid from the beans and vegies.

Excellent veggie burgers. I followed the reviews and made sure the beans and chopped veggies were really dry before I mixed them. I also dry sauted the veggies and garlic a bit before mixing them in. I like thin burgers so I got five nice big ones from this recipe. Really, really delicious. Much better than Morningstar Burgers and a lot less expensive!  These are on my regulars list.

Great recipe! Have made and enjoyed several times. But you must, Must MUST ADD MORE BREAD CRUMBS! That makes this recipe a real winner.  Food processor helps a lot, too, but not for the beans.

First let me say I am not a fan of most veggie burgers, but I am trying to lose weight, and go meatless for a meal or 2 a week to cut down on fat. I made this pretty much as written, used pepper and onion stirfry mix well drained in a food chopper, and used Mrs Dash steak seasoning, as it had most of the ingredients of your seasonings, added a bit more cumin. They came out perfect, didn't stick, formed patties very well, while a bit dry adding some light mayo to the burger made it quite tasty, flavor stayed for a long time. Thanks for posting I think I will make some and keep in the freezer.

NO complaints! This was absolutely delicious. I forgot the hot sauce in the recipe, but there was plenty of flavor (I did add just a little salt and pepper to taste prior to adding the egg). I topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato and pickles, just like I would a regular burger. The flavor was good enough, though, that you wouldn't HAVE to add anything. I added the beans to the food processor, after the pepper/onions/etc. were chopped well. I had no problems with the burgers falling apart or sticking to the pan, as others have mentioned. I used non-stick cooking spray on my baking sheet. I'm wondering if some reviewers didn't mash the beans up enough to get a pasty texture. I will make this again...and again!!!

Absolutely delicious. Drying off the black beans after rinsing them really helps them stick together better. I like the spice, but think it could still use a little more kick.

Love these burgers. I use two eggs and probably 1 cup of bread crumbs, and I think they're perfect. I have tried both grilling on aluminum foil and frying, and both are good, although the burgers are a little harder to deal with when frying. I top them with with store-bought hot and spicy mayo, a little ranch, cheddar, lettuce, and guacamole. Salsa is also good on them, but seriously, it's worth the extra effort to put the guac on. Also, I make five patties instead of four because I think they're too mushy in the middle if you make them that thick.

I used two eggs like some reviews suggested I then had to add an extra 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to accomodate for the extra liquid; they stayed together perfectly. I didn't have chili sauce on hand so I used ketchup and it worked fine. Will definitely make again!

These are delicious and so easy to make!  I've never had any problems with them falling apart, but I don't own/use a food processor to chop the green pepper and onions.

Girlfriend loved them...I kind of compared the taste to that of the veggie burgers found at a well-known Burger franchise - and found them missing a bit. Overall though - given the health aspect vs beef burgers - they were GREAT!

These were wonderful. I made sure the beans, onions, and peppers were very well drained and all excess moisture gone. I used 2 eggs instead of 1 and used 3/4 cu of crushed Ritz crackers instead of 1/2 cup of bread crumbs. I baked them and they were great, much better than other black bean burgers that I buy. The rest of the family loved them as well.

I will still be buying veggie burgers until I find a recipe that compares.  I made the recipe & froze the patties.  No trouble with them falling apart.  However, the texture was like eating a mound of mashed beans, the flavor was good. Not sure I would make it again.  Going to try some others before I try to attempt modifying this one. 2 stars for flavor.

This is very good. I used a red bell pepper and a tsp of salsa because I didn't have a green pepper on hand nor hot sauce. I froze three of the patties. The patties were too soft since I didn't drain my home cooked black beans enough. I patted crumbs made from homemade French bread on both sides of one and fried it in canola oil. I didn't feel like a bun and ate it plain. I think it would be good this way with a dollop of sour cream and a little salsa on top.

super good flavor, really tasty.  easy to put together but it does take time to let the beans & veggies drain. and i froze the patties for several hours, about 4. otherwise, i followed the recipe almost completely, only changes were oats instead of bread crumbs, 1 egg white instead of whole egg.  i found the consistency fine to work with...only criticism is that cooking took longer than i expected.  definitely going to make again but next time i make them i am going to add brown rice.

This was a great base recipe!  I used creamed corn instead of eggs (we are vegan) upped the bread crumbs by 50% as other users suggested (I use Panko) added 2 TBSP flax seeds and 1/4 cup shredded carrots, used 2 bunchs of green onions and 4 cloves garlic.  Ommited the chili flavorings (personal preference). I baked them 7 min each side then lightly sauteed in olive oil.  Served on whole wheat english muffins toasted with garlic-butter and a side of sweet potato fries - it really hit the spot!

Next time I make these I intend on making some changes based on a couple of difficulties I experienced. I had absolutely no problem forming the patties even though I left out the egg (I'm allergic). I thought the consistency of the mixture was perfect, not at all sticky and quite similar to turkey burgers I've made in the past. However, I had a hard time keeping them from falling apart during cooking (I baked them unfrozen and frozen) and had to keep reforming them during the cooking process. I also found these to be quite dry(could be because I left out the egg?) and not substantial enough for a burger. Otherwise, I loved the taste of them and thought the spice was perfect! I melted some cheddar on them and served with a modified version of the "Chipotle Peach Salsa with Cilantro."

I thought these were fabulous!  Only thing I changed was that I used a red pepper instead of a green one only because I like them better. I made extra and froze some patties.  So good and healthy.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious and easy to make. Baked in toaster oven at 375 for 10 minutes/side. Next time, I may coat with panko or wheat germ to give a crunchy exterior. Thanks!

I made these for a bbq recently, and they were delicious. I added mushrooms, and I substituted Rits for bread crumbs. Mine didn't fall apart primarily because I added more crackers. ENJOY!

This was definitely a hit. My husband is a meat lover and he really liked these. I followed the recipe and I grilled them on nonstick foil. I had no problems with them sticking together. I served them with sliced tomato and chipotle powder mixed with yogurt cheese to top them. I will make them often.

We love these!!! My three year old loves these, so it deserves 10 stars! We didnt have any eggs on hand so I used chia (1 tbs chia seeds with 3 tbs water let sit for ten minutes = 1 egg.) These are so quick and easy to make. My little guy loved helping me these. Thanks for sharing!!!

Very good bean burgers, I added more bread crumbs than the recipe called for and melted habanero jack cheese on top. They did need a little more time baking than the recipe said but it wasn't a big deal. Overall, very good!

this made a delicious, moist burger. i used a whole orange bell pepper and used a full cup of bread crumbs. i will go thru the reviews and try some other reviewers suggestions as i enjoy the versatility available with this recipe. it is good as is though (with the extra bread crumbs in my opinion) my six year old formed the patties and we grilled them, had them on multigrain bread with avocado and mayo. delicious!

This was fantastic.  The only thing I changed was substituting egg replacer for the egg to make it vegan.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

Wow! These are delicious!  I followed the ingredients exactly and my burgers didn't fall apart at all.  However, I did saute the green pepper and onion in 1tbsp of olive oil, prior to mixing with the bean mixture.  I also pan-fried the burgers with a light spary of olive oil, instead of baking.  YUM!  These are definitely a new favorite in my recipe box.

This was a great meal! Very filling. I did add 1/2 a can of drained corn and lots of Cajun spices. I did take the hint to rinse and dry the beans which made them hold together. I put them on some toasted onion buns, added spicy mayo-talk about good. All-in-all they were tasty and a fast fav for my vegetarian boyfriend.

So I give these 4 stars because I didn't have cumin.  But I added spinach and carrots and cheese and an extra egg.  Something is missing. I had pre cooked my beans because I didn't use the can ones and I even seasoned those with a veggie broth.  The burger stuck together fine and maybe I left it on the George Foreman too long but it was a bit dry.  I should have used cheddar cheese maybe.  But they have a lot of potential. Not as tasty as the lentil patties I have made from this site but still pretty good. I will play with them to suit my taste next time.

I tried this recipe in an effort to use some leftover black beans (dried ones, soaked and cooked). I was very pleased with this! I didn't have breadcrumbs, so after some research I used cornmeal. I used a tbsp of salsa as I didn't have hot sauce. These held together pretty well, and they tasted great! If you leave out the hot sauce, be sure to put some salt in at some point before cooking. I fried mine in olive oil on the stovetop. Thanks for the recipe!

Good, healthy alternative to a traditional burger.  My teenage boys turned up their noses when they heard I was making veggie burgers for dinner but, after only one bite, they both agreed that these were pretty good and ate every bit!  I did add an extra egg and used 3/4c. bread crumbs.  I also made sure the beans and pepper/onion/garlic mix were well drained.  Served with regular burger toppings.

Luckily i had read other reviews and since we usually eat beef burgers and had back-ups ready. They looked great which is why I gave them two stars. We thought they had too much chili powder and cumin. Surprisingly, my 5yr old was the only one who liked these everyone else changed to regular burgers.

These are excellent. I just added enough bread crumbs to get them to hold together, which was more than 1/2 cup. They tasted like panera bread company's black bean soup! My carnivore husband loved them!

This is a great recipe.  I used 2 eggs and an 2 extra Tbsp of bread crumbs and they held together nicely.  Added 1 Tbsp of chili sauce and it didn't seem very hot.  Enjoyed with traditional hamburger condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo). Yum y!

I live in a country where some of the ingredients are hard to find... but the recipe sounded so good, I was determined to try it. I substituted cooked dry navy beans for black beans. Rather than use bread crumbs, I blended 1/2 cup of oats and 2 slices of toasted bread in the food processor. I didn't add as much spice as suggested, but will next time. My meat-eating boyfriend savored them as much as I did! Thanks!

I've never eaten a veggie burger before so I have nothing to compare this to. It was a bit dry though and I wasn't sure what condiments or toppings to put with it. I will double the Thai chili sauce next time though. Maybe I should have tried topping it with a splash of chili sauce? I will try that the next time I fix these. I didn't have any egg so I used a spoon of mayo and it worked out great. This was really good and I will fix it again. Thanks for sharing this great meatless dish!

Easy to make and satisfying to eat. The burgers were very flavorful. I used extra onion in place of the green pepper, and wheat bran instead of bread crumbs.

These burgers are excellent! Even my carnivore husband loved these.   To make the burgers a little healthier, I put oatmeal in the food processor instead of using breadcrumbs. To keep the burgers from falling apart, I used two eggs and just over a cup of ground oatmeal. After mixing all of the ingredients together, I refrigerated the mixture for just over an hour. Everything held together perfectly! We used red pepper instead of green pepper, because we much prefer that flavor. These burgers were delicious, and we will make them again and again!

First let me start with I don't care for beans but I have been trying to incorporate them into my diet because of their nutritional value while trying to not eat so much ground beef. With that in mind to me these tasted good I will make these for my lunch. I made these for a friend whose is a vegetarian and she was so impressed with these burgers she could not believe the taste and took the recipe home to share with some friends of hers who are also vegetarian. Thank you for the recipe.

Very good!   I didn't want "mushy" as some have reviewed so I increased the bread crumbs to 1 cup total.  This, I believe gave them the cooked through texture that I wanted.  I also decreased the chili powder and cumin by half and was pleased with that amount.  I got 6 patties from this recipe.  We all enjoyed them.  THX

This recipe was wonderful. I added a small can of green chilies, and another 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to compensate for the extra moisture.  Way better than store bought!

I followed this recipe exactly and loved it.  I used to by store bought veggie burgers and will make these from now on.  I had no problem with the patties not sticking together and I didn't dry my bean or strain the onions, peppers, etc.  Loved it.

I've never really had veggie burgers before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I thought they were good, but not fantastic. I doubled the recipe and took the beans for a ride in the salad spinner to dry off. I used 50% more bread crumbs as advised by a different reviewer. I think that is a good suggestion because they did stay together well. It is cold outside, so I used the oven rather than the grill. My family didn't eat these as well as I expected even though they LOVE black beans, so I will be the solo veggie burger leftover consumer. I do think there was too much cumin. If I make these again (probably not) I will reduce the cumin in half. These would be really good with some chipotle mayo or something similar.

This was easy to prepare, and my mom (vegetarian) thoroughly enjoyed it. I would high recommend reducing cumin to 1 teaspoon and grinding it before adding to mixture. Also, needs a bit of a kick. We ended up putting more hot sauce on the burger when it was done. Overall wonderful :) Thank you!

VERY GOOD! The only change to the recipe I made was use two eggs and I put in 1/2 cups bread crumps and 1/2 cup rolled oats. I had no problem with it holding together or being to wet.

Great! Easy enough recipe, great results. I was a little put off by reports of oddly-textured burgers, so I added an extra 1/2 egg per recipe (I doubled it, so I added one egg) and added a combination of bread crumbs and oats until the bean mixture was no longer moist and sticky. If you pay attention to the state of the "dough" and don't cook until it feels right you should be fine! Per other reviewers' suggestion I topped with Chipotle Mayo from this site and it really added good flavor. I also served with Roasted Vegetables from this site for a healthy veg meal. Thanks for a recipe I'll return to again and again!

This is the second time I've made this. The first time was quite a long while ago. Today I made sure to rinse and dry all the vegetables. I added in 1/3 - 1/2 cup corn and a small can of fire roasted green chiles. I mixed the beans with the spices first. I added 1 tbsp cumin, 2 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp garlic pepper, 1 tsp of my own chipotle spice mix, and a few shakes of liquid smoke. After I mixed that well, I took all the vegetables (which I chopped the onion and bell pepper finely -- the garlic I left whole) and put them in a bread loaf pan, mixed in some olive oil, and roasted them for awhile. I drained the vegetables after removing them and added them to the bean mixture. I pressed the garlic and mixed well. Instead of bread crumbs, I used 1/2 cup oats (run through the blender slightly), and wheat germ (oh, I have no idea how much -- I just added til it looked right, 1/3 cup maybe?). Instead of an egg, I used 2 tbsp ground flaxseed + 6 tbsp water, mixed. I added that last. I sprayed a lined baking sheet with Pam, sprayed my hands, and formed patties (then sprayed the tops of them). I got 6 good sized (but thinner) patties. All vegan too! For the rest of my family, I made up some chipotle mayo as suggested by other reviewers. I glanced at the recipe, but I didn't follow it exactly. I used a big glop of mayo, a big squirt of ranch, and most of a chipotle bouillion cube. Cumin was perfect, I thought.

These were awesome.  My daughter loved them more than I did, but she's also our burger guru.  Squeezing out the way excess moisture from the onions and the beans (mostly the onions) was a pain, but the effort was worth it.

Made these for me and Mary. Great taste but were a bit too crumbley. maybe add another egg or some cheddar cheese to help them stick together better.

This recipe was great! Everyone I have made these burgers for has loved them, and I have suggested it to several friends who made them and liked it as well. The recipe can be made simpler though, as I do not use the chili powder, cumin, or hot sauce; instead I use garlic powder, and add a couple of seeded jalapenos. Also, others who suggested blending all ingredients are spot on, as it makes things much easier.

I omitted the peppers and added frozen vegetables instead.  I also followed the advice of others and added a second egg and used 3/4 c of oats instead of breadcrumbs.

I'm not a vegetarian and I won't give up meat burgers, but I thought these were very good and I'll definitely make them again.  I shaped mini-burgers and grilled them on my indoor griddle with just a bit of nonstick spray.  I had no problem with too much moisture, but what I did to dry the beans after rinsing was drain them in a colander, then put them in a bowl that was lined with several sheets of paper towel to absorb any remaining moisture.  I mashed them using a potato masher to make quick work of the job.

I would definitely recommend adding another egg or more breadcrumbs, if squeezing excess juice doesn't help maintain consistency.  Other than that minor detail, this are delicious!  Best vegetarian burger I have ever had...and probably 1/3 the price, too!  I dressed mine with sour cream, pepperjack, and salsa on toasted/buttered wheat bread.  Fabulous dish.

This was delicious!  They ended up smelling and tasting like taco seasoning!  I made these for my fiance and his mother and his vegetarian sister.  We LOVED them.  They are still enjoyable two days later, too.  I made a few changes, though:
-I doubled the recipe
-I used an extra egg
-I used an extra half cup of bread crumbs
-I used frozen green/red/yellow peppers from Kroger.  I defrosted them in the microwave, then squeezed out the excess water by hand.
-I used garlic from a prepackaged bottle of Spice World minced garlic instead of expensive fresh garlic.  Half a teaspoon of minced garlic is roughly equal to one clove of garlic.  (I use this bottled, minced garlic with much success in just about everything that calls for fresh garlic.)
-I mashed the beans with a potato masher instead of a fork.  It worked very well.
-I lightly coated a foil-covered cookie sheet with sprayable, canned vegetable oil.

All of this worked out very well.  The fact that this recipe is quite inexpensive only makes it that much better, if you ask me.  I made the recommended four patties per can of black beans, and the patties were pretty big.  My fiance and I both think that the patties could have been a little bit smaller, though, so next time I will probably make five patties per can of beans instead of four.

I will definitely make these again in the future.

Disappointed.  Even though it held together really well for me, I thought there was way too much chili powder in it.  It was too dry and crunchy.  Spouse didn't like it.  Teenage sons comments..."too much weird spice taste".

The reviews were so good, I went ahead and doubled the recipe before I even tasted it.  My husband is the manliest meat eater around, and he was still raving about the black bean burgers this morning.  Good thing we have lots of frozen left overs.  Great recipe!!!

This burger was so yummy just like the one at Chili's. I would say the #1 thing to remember is really pat out all the excess liquid. I didn't use the spices only paprika. Next time I am going to try other veggies

Disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly and several weeks later I still can't get myself to finish these. They don't stay together at all, and the taste doesn't make up for the mushiness. Basically tasted like mashed black beans with cumin.

These are awesome burgers.  My husband hates frozen veggie burgers and I convinced him to try these.  He loves and usually eats more than one.  I've added all different types of left over veggies to the mix with great results.  Don't be afraid to season because the beans can take it.  Like others have said, you must gdrain the veggies and the beans well or you will have a wet mushy mess.  This is a great way to make your $$$ go furter while eating healthy.

These were great. I used whole wheat ritz crackers in hopes that it would create a firmer texture. It didn't help. I'll have to experiment with that part of it because my burgers were soft. That wasn't a bad thing, I would just enjoy them more with a crunch outside. Thanks for the awesome recipe!  I have made these again and I used slightly ground up oats to add some healthiness to the burgers.

All the hype is warranted. I won't be buying anymore frozen veggie burgers.
This is a great recipe-I really didnt change too much.
I doubled the recipe. I drained two cans of black beans in a colander, then patted then dry with a paper towel, then mashed them with a fork.
I diced an onion, 3 garlic cloves, 1/2 green &1/2 yellow pepper. I had some mushrooms and roasted red peppers I threw in, too. I doubled the chili powder and cumin, but kept the chili oil paste at 1 T. I used 3 small eggs. 
I dont have a food processor, so I put all the diced veggies in first and choped them, then added the eggs and mashed black beans. I dumped it all back into the bowl, added the spices and breadcrumbs (Italian Seasoned) and mixed it up. You may need to add a little more crumbs, depending on consistancy(how big your eggs will make a consistancy difference)

I just fried one up in an olive oil sprayed pan and it was awesome!!
Thanks for the great, healthy recipe!!

I wasn't expecting to enjoy this meal myself (I'm very picky), but made it for all my vegetarian friends. I ended up liking it a lot more than I thought, and all my friends really liked it. I had to use more bread crumbs than the recipe called for to make it the right consistency. I will also add a little salt next time. Thanks!

VERY yummy!!  Loved this recipe, but I added a few things to the burgers.  I added a cup of cooked brown rice, doubled the egg and beans, added about 3/4c mozzarella cheese and a 1/2c sliced mushrooms.  I used the bread crumbs and added until moist.  It made 6 large patties.  I topped these with Swiss Cheese and used whole wheat buns.  So good!

This is a great recipe!  I was looking for cheap meals that are healthy and filling and this was a great change.  My husband wasn't too sure of it at first, but once he tasted it he told me he was pleasantly suprised and he would like it added to our meal rotation!  The only things I changed was I added 2 eggs instead of 1 and I used oatmeal(grind it up in the processor) in place of the bread crumbs. I ended up using 1-1 1/2 cups of the oatmeal!  The consistency should look similar to regular hamburger once you've added enough oatmeal.  I will keep this one!  Thanks :o)

I LOVED LOVED LOVED the taste of this recipe! I made it last night and tweaked the ingredients and recipe
1. I added brown rice like others had recommended 
2. because my family has a spicier palate I decided to nix the bell peppers and add hot chili peppers, 
3. I finely chopped the garlic and onions and mixed everything by hand 
4. To make it healthier I added 2 egg whites instead of a whole egg as the recipe called for 
5. I added wayy more bread crumbs 
6. before I froze my batch I dipped each patty into an egg white then bread crumbs mixed with taco seasoning 
In all GoodStuff!

I wouldn't really say this was a bad or good recipe.  Probably won't make it again, I don't really see myself craving it.  I do not eat meat and found it to be ok and my roomie is a meat eater and he disliked it, couldn't even choke down a whole patty.  I would say it is worth a shot if it sounds good to you, just not our fancy!

I have to tell you I have never put in a review before but couldn't let this go.  I tried a black bean burger when out one day at a local resturant and just had to look it up here.  I was suprised to only find 2 recipes to choose from.  I tried yours and loved everything about it.  I did use 2 eggs and extra bread crumbs. I also pulled out my hamburger press and then I froze them before cooking. They still fell apart but what does that matter? Neatness isn't everything....
I put them on a wheat roll with black/corn salsa GREAT!!! The hamburger press that was in the closet for years is now out for good and I will be making this recipe often.  thanks

Easy to make, quite healthy, and not bad at all...but perhaps a little bland. I'll definitely make this again, but I'll probably use more of the spices, and possibly add some lemon juice to give it a little extra zing. Otherwise, a great recipe!

I followed the tips of a reviewer on how to keep the patties from falling apart and they held up well on the grill. Though we liked the flavor, we didn't enjoy it in "burger form" as much as we thought we would. I followed another reviewers suggestion and used the leftovers as a burrito filling and enjoyed it better. Very good flavor.

great flavor, just not for a burger. better for a burrito or mexi-type wrap.  but it is too much work not to be a burger.... add something chewy, brown rice or grapenuts or something

Excellent. Even my husband who doesn't like beans loved this.  I added corn and cilantro and used 2 eggs, and a little more bread crumbs than stated.

The taste was good but the burgers were extremely mushy.  If we try to make them again, we'll definitely use even more extra breadcrumbs than we did this time.

These are so good! My husband loves burgers and he didn't miss the meat at all. I added 2 eggs as another review suggested and a bit more bread crumbs to get the right consistency. They held together very well and were moist and delicious!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I loved the combinations of the spice - the smokiness of the cumin and the kick of the chili powder and the hot sauce.  Actually I used the Thai sweet chili sauce.  I didn't use a food processor at all.  I just diced up my veggies and mixed everything together, so cleaning up was a snap!  I did choose to bake these burgers, but I bet the grilled version is really great too.  I'll be making these again.

We didn't like this at all.  Won't make again.  I'm not quite sure what I expected, but I will stick with Boca...at least it reminds me of a burger.  I guess if you are looking for a spicy bean patty this is your recipe.

These did not hold together well. 75% of a good bean burger recipe is the consistency and I think this really lacked.

I love this recipe, I make it all the time and have no problems with it falling apart. I don't do anything different from what the recipe calls for, though I don't puree the onions and peppers, but just chop them fine in the food processor.

This is a very good recipe. I enjoyed making these, they weren't hard at all, and I'm not even very good at cooking! Anyway, the only changes I made were to add more bread crumbs (I used seasoned bread crumbs also) and just eyeball to see how the consistency changed. Another thing, if you aren't a big fan of cumin ( like me) DO NOT ADD 1 TABLESPOON. I only used about 1/2 tbsp. and the cumin overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients. Next time I make these I'll only use about 1/2-1 tsp. Thanks again for a great recipe!

These have become a part of the rotation in my house. We eat them at least twice a month. My husband and 16 month old love them. They are a great way to cut some of the fat and meat out of our diet. Thanks! We like spicy food, so we add a little extra hot sauce to the grownups burgers.

These were great. Did everything in the food processor as others recommended.  Probably used about 3/4 cup total of breadcrumbs and doubled the garlic.  The patties felt really wet and I was worried about them staying together but they turned out fine. Letting them grill long enough to get a good crust on them before flipping helped. Much better than Boca. :)

The perfect veggie burger! It's good with anything on top, just like its beefy counterpart. I also find it helpful to strain the vegetables after chopping and/or refrigerating the mix before cooking. Very good!

WOW!! This burger was so easy to make, i could not believe it! My vegitarian sister raved about it. I have already made a second batch, wrapped them individually and put them in the freezer. We love this burger and will be making them often instead of spending 4x as much money on the pre-packaged ones.

These were great. Used a jalapeno instead of bell pepper because we have one that's allergic to bell pepper. Gave it a nice kick.

I  just made some of these (with a few substitutions) and ate one for lunch. Delicious! I had soaked and cooked a pound of kidney beans, so I tripled the recipe and used 5 cups of kidney beans. I did what one reviewer advised and drained/dried everything as much as possible. I used some cayenne instead of pepper sauce and added black pepper and fresh parsley (had some around, why not), and salt (since they weren't canned and needed it). I needed more bread crumbs like the same reviewer said, so I used 1/2 cup of cornmeal (it worked, but not particularly good enough to recommend). I made the patties big and baked them a few minutes longer. So good! I'ma keep playing with this recipe, thanks! Update: I froze the rest and they're really dry when reheated. Maybe it was the cornstarch.

I love these, I will no longer be buying any from the store! The first time I made them they kind of fell apart, so this time I added a little more bread crumbs, and they stayed together nicely. Thank you so much for the delicious recipe!

I took some of the others advice and used 2 eggs, 1 cup of bread crumbs, and only 1 teaspoon of cumin.  They were excellent!  I cooked them on the George Foreman Grill and they didn't fall apart at all.  Excellent.

I didn't like this recipe too much. It was a big mushy and dry at the same time. I will probably try this again next time with corn. It just didn't taste that much like a burger, although I do appreciate the amount of seasonings in it.

Great basic bean burger recipe.  I would increase the seasonings next time, and maybe add some corn, but the texture was perfect.  I recommend serving them like I did with chipotle mayonnaise...So yummy.

SO GOOD! And I'm not even a vegetarian! Wonderful flavor, just the right amount of spice. I recommend this as an alternative to beef. Served with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Cut down slightly on the cumin and made sure to strain the processed veggies before adding to bean mixture. This cut down on the runiness of the mix. Baked them as directed and they were wonderful.

Perfect healthy recipe! A nice change from fish and chicken. I decided to broil the burgers to get a nice "crunch" on the outside. I served these with guacamole on the side and used a good quality store bought BBQ sauce instead of ketchup. Really delicious. A keeper.

Simple to make and tastes very nice!  Substituted orange pepper for green (that's all I had) and used 1/2 cup of brown rice in addition to a sprinkle of bread crumbs. Following other users I blended the pepper, onion, garlic together and threw in some green beans and a red chili (for an extra kick!) - blotted the mixture with a paper towel to absorb the extra juice.  Only change I will make next time is reduce the cumin - although I like it I found it a little overpowering in the burgers.

I loved these, but I DEFINITELY recommend reducing the amount of cumin. I added corn like another review mentioned & they were excellent! They were great on a whole wheat bun with mustard! Thank you!

These were delicious, but had some problems with the mixture not holding together. The only kind of black beans I could find were in a 'chili' sauce (not living in the US)so it made the mixture too moist - however gave it a great flavor! Next time I will add more breadcrumbs and make the patties smaller so that they don't fall apart when I turn them over.

These were okay. They came out really dry. They were hard to cook without crumbling apart. Eventualy all I had was black beean crumbs, but we put them into wraps, so that was okay. They are really dry, and don't taste like others that I have had. I did make them with oats instead of bread crumbs to make them healthier. I may try again with bread crumbs to see if they work out better.

These were soooo much better than any veggie burger I have ever eaten before.  I pretty much stayed to the recipe, only I added a 4 ounce can of drained, chopped jalapeno peppers.  These had a GREAT kick to them and were super satisfying.  I cannot wait to crumble what is left for some burritos.  Thanks much!

So much cheaper and tastier than the store bought ones! They're great on the bun, but they're also super tasty on a salad or in a wrap. I'm on a diet, and this is a great way to eat something healthy that actually has some flavor.
Also: my boyfriend who has never had a veggie burger before really likes them. I'm just glad I made a double batch.

Very good, cheap and easy.  I didn't have any garlic so I just used onion and g.pepper, I just diced them up into small pieces.  No cumin so I substituted curry, I didn't measure it just threw in whatever.

I baked them in the oven and then made it into a bean burger grilled cheese with ketchup.  Very good, will definitely make again.  Much better than the store bought veggie burgers.

I haven't had black bean burgers before so I thought I'd give these a try.  They turned out pretty well and even my meat-loving husband thought they were okay.  I added an extra egg to the mixture and left it in the refrigerator overnight.  I cooked them in the toaster oven and topped them with cheese.  Not bad!

Despite all of the great reviews, I was disappointed. They took way longer than 10 minutes per side to cook. The texture was dry and pasty, and there was way too much cumin. I will not make again.

It was ok, but not a hit. maybe next time i will add some more veggies and try baking it. Used only 1 egg and had no problems in making patties, it held well.will try it again though.

I really liked this.  I had to substitute white navy beans the first time (black beans are not in every store here), but the taste was great.  Be sure not to make them too thin- they won't hold together then.

The flavor was OK but I found the burger kind of dry and pasty.  I used the leftovers as a filling in Tacos. I shaped them into little oblongs and heated them in the Microwave. Much better that way!

These are great I was wondering about that first bite hmmm YUMM just like chili.I got 5 palm sized burgers out of this recipe. I don't have a processer so I just minced it all really fine. I had to cook them at 450 and it worked fine it gave a slight crispiness to them. I never ate a bean burger so I didn't know how to top it so I went with corn,miracle whip and grain mustard mix with a layer of salsa it was awesome. I will make this again and again. Thank you!

My mom is a vegetarian, so I thought these would make the perfect the Mother's Day lunch.  They were quite a success.

I had a little trouble grilling them, so I ended up frying most in a non-stick pan.  I might try baking them next time, frying seemed to leave them very squishy in the middle.  I would also suggest serving on some thinly sliced sourdough instead of hamburger buns, since the patties are thin.  They would also be great in tortillas quesadilla style, or just taking the bean mixture and making a burrito out of it.  It is so tasty.  I got lots of compliments on the flavor.

I liked these, although I fried them in olive oil instead of baking them.  I don't know if I put enough bread crumbs to help hold them together, but they mostly stayed together within 2 pieces of bread.  A serving suggestion, for extra calories and tastiness: put fresh sliced avocado on the burger along with the usual lettuce & tomato.  The creaminess of the avocado helps to offset the dryness of the beans.  Very good recipe!

These burgers are delicious. The only problem I has was that the burgers didn't hold their shape well, and got squeezed out the sides of the bun. Maybe I made the patties too thick. Anyway, these are as flavorful as a hamburger and very nutritious and filling.

I made this with some pinto beans and red beans that i had in the fridge already. Since they were quite wet, I didn't add the suggested egg. I also cooked mine in a skillet instead of in the oven. I might try doing them in the oven next time. I liked the spiciness of these. My husband commented that the only thing about them was that they kind of mushed out of the burger...but other than that they were very tasty. Nice for a change.

These had a great flavor! Even my husband who doesn't like to eat vegetarian stuff rated them a 5, although he did say, "Don't tell anyone I ate a veggie burger." ;)

I had a hard time getting them to stick together, perhaps because I used fresh bread crumbs. I grilled some on my George Foreman and some on the stovetop in a skillet - we liked crispy outside on the skillet ones better.  

We served them on wheat buns with fresh guacamole and salsa. Excellent!

Perfect!  I followed recipe as written, only reducing amount of cumin to 1/2 T and adding a little bit of cayenne pepper.  I finely chopped green pepper, onion and garlic by hand, instead of using the food processor. I had absolutely no problems getting them shaped into 6 fabulous burgers!  Recipe is definitely going into my recipe box!  I plan on tweaking this with other spices just for the fun of it.  Thank you for posting - I no longer need to buy the expensive frozen!

Followed others advice and used 2 eggs, which made it too mushy to form into patties...so I added more bread crumbs and used a scoop to get them on the fry pan.  Once they cooked though, they were a good consistency.  Cut back spices to 1 teaspoon each...didn't have the thai sauce, so added cayenne pepper for spice; then added salt and pepper to each one as they cooked...and they turned out very good.  Better than the frozen ones, plus WAY cheaper and you know what's in them.  Will definitely make again...thanks!

I loved this recipe.  I didn't know what to top them with/how to serve them, so I put them on bread and spread a bit more of the Thai chili sauce on and it was great that way.

I had some left-over  home-made black beans with gravy to use and ended making these.I had added 2 eggs , no chilli sauce though and I followed the recipe , but it was still not able to hold together (my fault cuz the black beans had more gravy) so added rice flour to make it sticky and  refrigerated for 4 hrs then fried over a non-stick fry pan for sometime both side and then baked at 375 F for 15 mints each side for acrispy patty.It was very crispy , tasty and flavorful .thanks !!

I made these burgers twice - once for a dinner party, once for a BBQ - everyone loves them! I read the reviews before and decided to refrigerate the mix and had no problems with them sticking together. I had requests to make them spicier so I think adding in a little cayenne pepper or tabasco would be better next time!

This is a great veggie burger!!  The only thing that I changed was I added a can of corn.  They turned out so good.  My husband has already requested them again.  And he is a meat lover.  Thanks for such a healthy , low cost recipe that I will be making over and over!

My new favorite staple!  I used egg whites, so naturally the recipe was much harder to form into patties.  I used a bit more bread crumbs to compensate and although a bit crumbly to deal with, a near-perfect success-- I couldn't be any happier.

These were pretty good!  I used green onion (all I had), egg beaters, and just a little more than 1/3 cup bread crumbs.  I didn't have any hot sauce, so I used red pepper flake.  (That didn't do any good, though.)  They were good, just a little something missing.  I think that next time I will season the mashed beans w/ S&P before mixing everything else in, and I will definitely use hot sauce next time.  Definite keeper, though!  YUM!

Yummy!  I altered the ingredients just a bit to suit my taste (used corn in place of the pepper and onion) and forgot the hot sauce (good thing, too!  I'm not a bit spicy food fan - these have the perfect kick with the chili powder).  My only complaint is that this was pretty dry.  I'm not sure how to change that...maybe fewer breadcrumbs?  Leave a bit of the black bean juice in the mixture?  I'll definitely experiment and be making these again!
Oh, and I had the burger on whole wheat toasted bread (ran out of buns) with tomato, a little 2% milk cheddar, and sour cream - delish!

This recipe is a bit spicy, but I like spicy. I grilled the burgers, but 3 of them fell apart. I crumbed them up and used them for taco salad. I will be making these again!

Cripes were these good! I love-LOVE-cumin, and there being an entire tablespoon of it in these just made my day. I left out the green pepper since I don't like them, mashed everything up with a pastry cutter and made 12 small patties out of the mixture. They baked up perfectly at 6 minutes on each side in the oven, and came out just great. They seemed to be missing something, but I can't put my finger on it. Still, delicious.

Very tasty!  I tried using 1/3 cup egg substitute instead of an egg and had to add about twice as many bread crumbs as the recipe called for.  They were still kind of pasty though.  I did add a teaspoon of paprika and put salt and pepper on both sides of the patties because I was afraid they may be a little bland.  Overall, they came out really well.  I'll definitely be making these again.  They're sooo much better than the store-bought kind!

Very delicious. I left out the green pepper (personal preference) and threw in a red pepper instead. Jazz it up with a little mayo mixed with dijon mustard, garlic, lemon juice, and dill. We also made sweet potato fries as the side dish, which complemented the burgers nicely.

These were really tasty burgers.  My husband even loved them and said that they were very filling, which they were.  I made them a bit too big, though, so it was a little hard to flip.  Be mindful of the size you make your patties!

My husband got used to eating veggie burgers in the Airforce. Then he ordered one of the black bean burgers at Chili's Restaurant and demanded that I learn how to cook it. he thought these were great. I am not a veggie burger eater, so they were OK for me. If you are expecting them to taste like beef you will be disappointed, but if you like black beans, you will like them fine. Be sure to grease the foil.

I altered this by using celery, carrot, onion, garlic, and green pepper. I seasoned with garlic powder, cajun seasoning and all-purpose seasoning. I also used red taco sauce(Pace brand) instead of chili sauce. I did NOT use any egg b/c my boyfriend is a vegan. Refrigerated for about 1 hour then formed into patties. I baked at 375 for about 30 mins per side then broiled on high for 2-3 mins per side for extra crispiness. I had a little trouble turning them after the first 30 mins...it required 2 spatulas to keep them from falling apart but after that no problems with turning. Topped with fresh salsa...VERY TASTY!!!!

Unfortunately, this was a lot drier than we thought and the bean flavor was really overwhelming.  Perhaps it's because I didn't have any peppers and used mushrooms instead, and also because I used my George Foreman grill.  We used an herbed cream cheese spread which was good.  My husband and I both agreed that we would probably like the recipe better not cooked up as burgers, but rolled up in tortilla wraps with salsa and sour cream.

Wow. The other reviews were absolutely true. These are way better than store-bought. I substituted an Anaheim pepper in place of the green bell pepper, and I added some chopped mushrooms. They were wonderful! Next time though, I think I'll add a bit more egg, since the burgers were sorta falling apart on me. Thank you for this yummy recipe..I'll definitely be making these again.

This is a really good and fairly easy recipe to make.  I have made them twice already.  Luckily my husband is a meat-and-potatoes kind of guy, so I get them all to myself!  I have eaten them plain, without bread both times and enjoyed them.

These were good; we definitely liked them more than store bought veggie burgers.  I changed up the spices to fit my tastes:  1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes and 1/2 teaspoon tabasco.  I still found it very spicy, and will probably cut back further in the future.  I made this ahead of time and refrigerated for about 3 hours before making patties.  I added ~7 minutes to the baking time and they came out great.  I topped them with ketchup, but I think I'll follow the other reviewer's suggestion of avocado and sour cream next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

My vegetarian husband and I loved these burgers!  They were delicious.  I made homemade breadcrumbs in the food processor from a whole wheat baguette, which made the burgers a bit more moist than most veggie burgers we've tried, but still quite good.  Next time I might try day or two old bread, to see if the breadcrumbs might make the burgers a bit crispier in texture.  Overall, great recipe.

This is a fantastic base recipe, but you need to add to it. I added shiitake mushrooms, cilantro, 1/2 jalapeño and carrots. The most important thing I did was sauté on medium the veggies (mushrooms, onions, garlic bell pepper and the jalapeño) in olive oil and some black pepper for about 5 minutes. (Add the garlic last so it doesn’t burn.) Just a slight sauté brings out a crazy depth of flavor and is worth the extra few minutes. I did not add the carrot or cilantro or the saute, but I suppose you can.

I prepped the patty mixture ahead of time. Formed 4 meatballs shapes and put them in the refrigerator until I was ready to cook. Once on the pan I smashed into a Patty. I feel refrigerating helped it stick together better. I was able to make on a grill pan. Approx 8 min on high each side. I added this to a salad - Boston Bibb lettuce, red pepper, carrots , red cabbage, scallions. I also made a dressing with fresh juiced ginger (you can mince instead), soy sauce, Rice vinegar, olive oil, garlic.

These are perfect as I’m living over seas in a nation that doesn’t have much meat. When I’m craving a burger this is my go to. I tend to make the green pepper mix a full liquid and then add some smaller pieces if want a different texture.

Great tasting burger! I followed the recipe with the exception of using a yellow bell pepper instead of green because I happened to already have one in my fridge. I also added 1/4 cup of corn and just a tad extra bread crumbs as suggested from other reviewers.

I baked them in the oven which is my only regret because the patties came out much softer then we preferred. Next time I will fry them up in a skillet so they get a nice crispy texture.

I've made it twice and the second time was definitely better!  Next time, I will add just a little pink sea salt to the recipe. Less fat than pre-packaged patties and well worth the prep!

We made these burgers several times but always struggled to have them properly cook because the mix was too moist. Then I came across another recipe that called for a number of variations.  Putting the beans in the oven for about 10 minutes and sauteing the vegetables reduced moisture considerably. Also, reducing cumin and adding in Worcestershire sauce, ketchup and mayo brought in more flavor.

Quite tasty with the spices suggested. The patties held together well. We refrigerated them briefly prior to cooking. It made about seven generous sized burger patties. Next time we might make it with a few additions as it seemed to lacking somehow. Still they were good. Not having made any other  veggie burger recipes to compare this one to I'm hoping they can be improved in the future. Still better than store bought!

I accidentally left the onion and bell pepper in the food processor for too long and decided to hand dice the garlic after, still really good! I added lettuce, avocado, and pepper-jack cheese to mine

Good flavor. As is always the case (in my experience) with black bean burgers, they are too wet which makes them hard to form into patties.

This was a hit with our family. I made it as is, accept  I cut the cumin amount in half with no added salt. Was great with melted Swiss cheese.

I told a vegan coworker that I'd finally be making the black bean burgers and he said good luck because they don't hold so well. I just made them. While it's very flavorful full, my coworker was right. They partly fell apart. I'll be eating them with rice instead of buns.

This recipe was amazing! After reading the reviews about it being wet I decided to change a few things. I rinsed the beans and put them in the pressure cooker for 10 min.(to solve the lectin problem) along with a small splash of chicken broth. When they were done I drained them and pressed on them with a wad of paper towels. 
I grated the onion and squeezed out the water by hand and then again with a paper towel or you could use cheese cloth. I didn't use the peppers because I am allergic to them. I minced the garlic by hand. 
I used two eggs and I added my own mix of chili seasoning but only about a 1/2 tsp or so. 
When it was all mixed I fried them in a frying pan with EVOO. I experimented with one coated in bread crumbs and one without. Without was way better! They held together perfectly. I mixed some mayo with srirachi to dip in. 
Because of the extra pressure cooker step, considering time,  I will double this recipe so I can freeze them. Outstanding!
A few extra steps but it was well worth it

These are super easy, and freeze well so I usually make a double batch.  I don't even bother sauteing the onions and peppers: I just mince them pretty finely.  If the mixture seems too wet, I add 1/4 cup cooked rice or quick oatmeal.   I add cumin and a bit of chili powder.   Top with sciracha mayo (2 tbsp sciracha to 1/2 cup mayo)   for pure yum!

I read through some other reviews on this recipe.  I used rolled oats instead of bread crumbs.  Half the Cumin, 1 whole green pepper, table spoon of hot sauce.  Finally, I fried them in grape seed oil.  They turned out really well...crispy on the outside.  I'll make it again.

This was like a high end burger you would have while sipping wine at a Napa Valley winery. This is the way we felt when we were eating them. They were delicious as written. I did strain excess water from the pepper-garlic-onion mixture and I added a bit more bread crumbs (as needed) to bring the right consistency and it worked great. I've made this dish twice and both times cooked them on the grill. The first time we didn't cook them for long enough so I suggest to follow the directions. The cooking time in this recipe is pretty accurate. Thank you for for a delicious and healthy burger recipe!

I saw previous commenters worrying about them falling apart, and I noticed mine was pretty liquidy, so I ended up doubling the egg, doubling the bead crumbs, and halving the cumin. There is also no salt or pepper mentioned in the recipe, but I noticed too late and will add it next time. Going to freeze these for future dinners :)

The spices were perfect! I was worried how the flavor would turn out but these were so incredible. I was looking for a vegan recipe so I didn't use the egg, which meant I didn't need breadcrumbs. And I don't like green pepper so I omitted that as well. The flavor hits you right where you want it!

I have made this burger again and again! My family loves it, even the meat-eating old folks. :D  I took the advice of other commenters and strain my onion/pepper mix, and I also use an entire cup of breadcrumbs to make a drier burger. I've been able to turn this into 6 smaller patties; it's perfect to have lunch leftovers!

So so good! I will say, I puréed the peppers, onions, and garlic instead of just chopping up. It spread out the flavor well and mixed in with the beans perfectly. My burgers did need about ten extra minutes but i think that’s because i made them too thick rather than wider so I’d change that next time- i poked holes in them which evened out the cooking. Oh, and i did take advice from one of the other reviews and change 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to 3/4 cup which really helped with  Consistency. My husband loved them which is the biggest compliment the recipe could get.

Well to be completely honest I never ate a black bean burger before and I totally enjoyed this one.  I found it easy to make and having a food processor to Pulse the veggies made it super easy.  Only thing I’d change is not use hot chili powder, I’d use less or milder chili, it had a bit too much heat for my spouse.  Otherwise it’s a great healthy meal.

I didn't have bell pepper so I finely chopped 3 baby carrots. Next batch I'm adding corn. Great recipe!

I have never posted a review here in all of the many years that I've gotten recipes from this site, but these black bean burgers tasted so delicious that I felt compelled to give my opinion.   Fantastic!  Followed the recipe, and I did freeze them for 2 hours before grilling, added one more minute per side, and they were awesome!

For the people who had trouble getting the right consistency- I put the beans and the onions and peppers in a food processor to get the consistency more smooth and then added more breadcrumbs until I was able to clump the patties together and shape them properly.

I chop all the veg in the food processor and drain off some liquid. I rinse the beans as well. I also add some extra bread crumbs, freeze and grill from frozen. I'm pretty wimpy on the spice front all I leave out the chili from the recipe but add a squirt of sriracha. That's perfect for me. Better than store bought for sure!!

Very good! I added a jalapeño. I blended the egg, spices, onion, garlic, and peppers. I then mixed with the beans and bread crumbs. It turned out to be the perfect texture. Grilled on foil and got great grill marks.

Added a little more bread crumbs to hold it together better. Strained the water from the veggie blend before adding to the mix. Used 1/3 green pepper and 1/3 red pepper for colour. Great taste! Made more to throw in the freezer. Good recipe :)

I've made these twice so far for my mom, she has trouble stomaching meat these days, and she's gone crazy for them. Even I'm tempted to eat these bc they smell so good and I despise black bean lol

I add garlic and onion powder and pepper to the spices that go in (I don't have chili sauce) and I followed another reviewer's advice on freezing them. I do take some of the juices out of the veggies but that's bc mine were frozen and had extra moisture, haven't tried with fresh yet. I bake mine and put them on parchment paper to make flipping easier and add 5min to each side since they're frozen.

Ok...so I tried these. Made them exactly as the recipe says. It tasted almost entirely of the hot sauce we used and the patty was just mushy. I was hoping that it would harden up more and be more like a burger patty. it look like a burger on the outside but inside it is just paste. I am still a meat eater and I'm trying to remove meat more. I will say that I've had black bean burgers that are pretty good...but the texture and taste made it inedible for me. I'll see what I can do to make it better later

This was good! I used spicy black beans and red pepper instead of green. I added 1/2 package of tofu because I was worried about all the chili powder which led to extra bread crumbs due to moisture. I just added bread crumbs until I got the right texture.

Really liked it! I used a little less cumin than was recommended, and also made sure to dry out the beans and onion/pepper mix as much as possible. I also added more bread crumbs than asked for, and everything turned out fine and stuck together.

First timer making veggie burgers and I was happily surprised!  I read a few recipes and decided on this one.  I opted to lightly cook the onion, green pepper and garlic before adding to the recipe. I also added one baked sweet potato and a handful of chopped cilantro (both things I saw in other veggie burger recipes that I like the idea of).  To balance out the dryness I had to add a bit more bread crumbs.   I grilled on the bbq and they stayed together and were delicious!  A bit of sweetness from the sweet potato and texture from the mashed black beans.  Served with thinly sliced red onion, avocado and bbq sauce.  The bbq sauce is a MUST!!!  I will definitely make these again.

Per some of the other reviewers I added a carrot to the vegetable  mixture as well as a small amount of celerty powder. I drained and dried the black beans and the vegetables with paper towels. The patties were still very wet. I haven't had a veggie burger before but this was wet and mealy and didn't offer much taste. I'll stick to the cow.

My daughter didn't try it because she said she smelled spices. I didn't taste any heat, at all. It needs something creamy.

Yum yum yum! Almost tastes like a beef burger. I second the review about adding smoke flavour and Worcestershire! I topped it with a little cheese, salsa and cilantro. Can't wait to make it again! Very interchangeable recipe!

I loved it!  Did not think it was too wet at all.
Maybe the trick is to use dried garlic or garlic salt instead of fresh garlic? I did not have any fresh garlic so used dried garlic instead. I also used just chili spices instead of actual chili sauce(did not have chili sauce).

I also left the burgers in the freezer for an hour or two before frying in a skillet with a little bit of sunflower oil.

Really simple to make. These veggie burgers held me over for 3 days. It was really east NOT getting sick of them. The flavor of spices and veggies really complimented each other perfectly. If you're looking for a decent recipe, I would definitely encourage you to try this one out. Tweak the spices to your liking.

I didn't use any oil, due to my husband's diet.  I just finely chopped the veggies as well.  This recipe rivaled any restaurant black bean burger I have had. So good.

I made these and I really liked it.  Instead of using breadcrumbs, I used rolled oats (1/2 cup).  I also added a carrot to the onion (I used red onion), green pepper and garlic.  After chopping them in my food processor I squeezed out as much water as I could (I used paper towels, but cheesecloth would work better).  I also sauteed some mushroom and added it.  I also added in 1/2 cooked brown rice.  To the seasonings I added salt, pepper, cilantro, garlic powder, and onion powder.   I found it easy to form the patties by using a 1/2 cup measuring cup and slightly pressing down ( with oiled palms) and got 5 patties of equal size.  I froze mine before cooking and it came out great.

Followed the recipe exactly. The texture was fine but its missing a lot of salt. We are not a vegetarian household and needless to say we missed the flavour in these, tasted like something that belonged on top of our nachos.

The description is correct: I will never buy frozen BBburgers again! : ) I will make a batch and individually freeze the cooked burgers for work lunches. I used chopped red pepper, garlic, carrots, and cauliflower. I drained the water from the veggies best I could and also laid the rinsed beans out to dry for a while. But the burgers were still pretty wet. They cooked up okay. I think I'll try cooked rice instead of bread crumbs next time and see how that does. **Three garlic cloves was very strong. Next time I will use less (I'm not sure if this is because I chopped them rather than minced?). 
This is a great base recipe and I look forward to adding all sorts of veggies in with it. Maybe mushrooms, spinach, corn, etc.

This was the first time I made a vegetarian meal for my husband and I. First, he said to count him out but would critique on a burger. He devoured them all! He loved it! I loved it as well. I pan fried mine, because I need the grease, can't be too healthy. I left out the pepper, but tasted phenomenal and followed the recipe with no problems about the patty falling apart. I made them about 1 cm thick, next time will make them thinner as it was a touch dry.

This is a very forgiving recipe. I dried my beans with paper towels, don’t have a chopper so I used my shredder on the onion and well for everything else I didn’t measure. I didn’t have a pepper but tossed in red pepper flakes, no cumin but put in other spices to fix it. I doubled the recipe and had no issues with it being runny.  Made 6 large patties in the oven. Spicy but oh my gosh delish. The spicy is from

I also squeezed the extra liquid out of the chopped vegetables and these held together without falling apart.
They are good and a bit spicy.
Doubled the recipe and cooked some on the stove and some in the oven the next day. The fried ones were better!

Great flavor! Easy to make. I will make these again. It could use a little salt, but other than that this recipe is a keeper.  The patties are large and very filling. It could be used to make bean balls for spaghetti. The patties did fall apart a little but could use another egg or it could be that I added corn to the recipe and only had panko bread crumbs.

I made the recipe exact as stated and I didn’t think it was firm enough.  The taste was okay, but it was lacking some flavor, salt? Not sure.  I like it because it was healthy, but next time, I am going to add more onion, garlic, and top with blue cheese.

Very good.  For my kids' sake,  I drained the onion and pepper's liquid after processing, and I cut the chili powder by half  and the cumin to about 1/4-1/2 tsp.   I also omitted the chili sauce/hot sauce. Everyone liked them. and there was still a good flavor.  The texture is a little crispy on the outside and bean-like on the inside.

These are good, but make sure to press the liquids out of the chopped vegetables with a mesh strainer.
They're pretty bland, so be sure to add salt.

Major step is missing...squeeze excess juice out of chopped veggie mixture otherwise these are going to be sort mushy and bread crumby. That being said, these are really good and yes, Quick and Easy.

These were excellent! Took some advice from other reviewers and made sure the beans were dry and that I squeezed out the onion and pepper. I made them and froze them before cooking and they stayed together and tasted so good! Definitely making again....maybe trying different spices for different tastes. But these were excellent just as the recipe was written!

With a slice of red onion, tomato, lettuce, cheese and condiments this burger is a favorite.

These are great!! Recipe as written worked for me. BUT, dry beans after rinsing/before mashing! This will help hold them together much better.

These were pretty great. I solved the moisture problem by pouring the contents of my food processor of veggies into the colander I'd just used to rinse and drain my beans to let the excess liquid run off, and after that the consistency was perfect. I'm planning on making a big double- or triple-batch of these and freezing them in waxed paper so that we can have ready-to-go veggie burgers on hand for the nights when no one feels like cooking.

Awesome protein-packed burgers that both my family and I love a lot! I've made this recipe several times and the only thing I changed was adding water and olive oil to make them moister and stick together better. 10/10 would recommend!

Flavor was good, but my patties didn't hold together so it was more like Veggie Joes.  Maybe I should have drained the excess liquid from the blended items.

These didn’t hold together, as others have noted.  Still searching for a veggie burger that I can freeze in quantity.  This was more like hash.

Loved the flavor but debating whether I want to fuss with it a second time. If I make them again, it's going to take some tweaking to get the right consistency to actually shape into burgers. I ended up pan frying the patties and still they were fragile and wanting to fall apart. Top marks for flavour though so I may give it another shot.

My husband and  I really liked these!  I did let the beans dry out per another reviewer's suggestion and I added salt. The mixture seemed a little too soft to make into patties, so I added an extra 1/4 cup of panko. We put cheese, sauteed onions and peppers on top. I think I could easily have made 5 burgers from this recipe. I froze the extra patties, and am interested to see how they hold up to freezing. Will definitely be making these again.

I have made these burgers about a dozen times now, and they are DELICIOUS. I first looked for the recipe when my daughter was a vegetarian. Even after she went back to eating meat, we continue to make these. They are way more flavorful than other veggie burgers. I’ve made them following the recipe to the T (baked), and I’ve also cooked them in a cast-iron skillet when I needed the oven for something else. Great both ways, though they keep from falling apart better in the skillet. Usually I follow the recipe, but I’ve also made them when I didn’t have any green pepper, and I’ve altered the spice levels for my kids. Everybody loves them, including my two year old. When she was even littler, I made little “meat” balls out of these for dipping. Those were great, too. This is really a fool-proof recipe, it’s SO YUMMY, it’s healthy, and it’s cheap. What more could you want? :)

I love this recipe. You can add or subtract veggies to switch it up. I have added carrots and used chilies instead the green peppers. The original recipe is great too. I had to cut down on the chili powder because it was a little spicy for me. Delicious and filling alternative to hamburgers.

I made this for my vegetarian son, and he gave it a five star rating. He really likes the veggie burgers that I get at the grocery store, but he likes these even more. That’s fine by me because I figure the cost is about 1/3, and the burgers are larger. I followed the recipe exactly, and I didn’t have the wet burger problem that some of the reviewers have complained about.  I also put on a slice of real American cheese two minutes before taking them out of the oven. Two burgers with cheese and rolls is about 900 calories. Toast the rolls on a skillet with butter to add additional calories and flavor. If you have vegetarian kids, calories are good.

I followed some suggestions of other reviewers including adding a bit more bread crumbs, adding corn and parmesan cheese.  I also froze them for 3o minutes or so.  They kept their shape and cooked up awesome.  I added pepper jack cheese.  I also used green onion because thats what I had on hand.  Added a little grated carrot.  Will be making these every week-loved them!

This burger was so good! I eyeballed all the measurements of the ingredients. I just added all the ingredients to what I thought was the right amount and to my preference. As for the bread crumbs, I added as much bread crumbs as needed for it to hold together. Then I froze them and whenever I feel like a burger, I take out a frozen patty and bake it. It’s perfect for make ahead meals and for a quick meal in the future.

Made it did in frying pan with nonstick spray. Didn’t try to form patties wasn’t going to happen.  Just did by large spoonfuls and pressed down a little. Held shape after cooked on one side. Made smaller than said so got more burgers.

Take the advice of others and dont forget to dry your beans after you rinse them and strain your veggies of excess liquid. I doubled this recipe and found that the amount of cumin called for per serving could be reduced to about 2/3 of a tbs and comes out just right. Cumin in these burgers are what provide the main flavor  component of this recipe. I also changed out the chilli powder for  chipotle chilli powder and green pepper for red pepper since that  was all I had in my kitchen (it added some sweetness to the recipe which helped balance the chilli powder and hot sauce). I added 1 tsp ground white pepper and 1/2 tsp of garlic and onion powder. Instead of bread crumbs I took about 1/2 package of town house crackers (you can use ritz crackets as well) and used a food processor to break it down to about a half a cup. I also added some corn to the mixture when bringing it all together. If its still too watery and sticky you can try adding more bread crumb. I simply took some wax paper and shaped out my patties. Stuck it in the freezer and cooked them from frozen.  Theres so many things you can add to improve the flavor of this recipe

Made it just like the recipe said to and they turned out pretty well. I did have to double the amount of bread crumbs to get the consistency right, though. The family liked them. We will definitely make them again.

This was my first veggie dish and I got to say I loved it!

I certainly did follow the top suggestions which were:

add more bread crumbs
rinse black beans before mash
dry onion bell pepper mixture

I will definitely be making more of these!

These were very good, but I followed the directions and they did not hold their shape. Next time I'll add more breadcrumbs and freeze into patties before cooking. Definitely keeping these in rotation though with those changes!

Rate 3 for flavor but the consistency was off. It was soupy. I followed the recipe. My vegetarian daughter suggested not to pulverize the beans to keep some of the texture. Will try again.

Probably the first time I made black bean burgers. Followed the ingredients except I used a red pepper. I may have over processed but then again maybe not because the black beans were fairly hard to mash with a fork . In the encore I think the texture was correct. I used the recommended spices (maybe Thai curry paste instead of hot sauce ). I used bread crumbs. The patties were easy to shape. The total weight was 550 gm so I made 4 patties weighing 120 hmm and one weighing 75 gm. The child ate the 120 gram patty; the adult who may never eaten a bean burger ate the smaller one.

I've made this recipe twice - first time as written and it was good.  Second time I added a grated carrot, chopped parsley and more hot sauce - MOST IMPORTANTLY - I dredged the patties in flour and gently fried them in a little oil (I used coconut but olive or veg oil works too).  They look better, taste better and hold together better.  I make 8 burgers out of this recipe, use four and freeze four.  It works well.

I loved this recipe and it was super easy to make! I substituted the full TBSP  of cumin for a TBSP of taco seasoning which has cumin in it plus other spices. To make it vegan, I used 1 TBSP of flaxseed mixed with 3 TBSP instead of the egg. I read from one review to use Ritz Crackers instead of bread crumbs so I went with the crackers. I rinsed my beans and blotted with paper towel. I also squeezed out the excess water from veggies. I pan fried with olive oil. They were perfect and didn't even come close to falling apart!!!  Next time I will add other ingredients like other reviews suggested, such as corn and maybe carrots to add texture to the inside.

Each time I modify a wee bit.  Our favourite add in is about 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce and then add in a few more bread crumbs to thicken up or oats. Love this recipe

This looks awesome and easy to make. I added to my list to make this week. However this isn’t vegan. Not with that egg in ingredients. I will try making with applesauce to hold together? Not sure. But ya should change name to avoid confusion since the VEGAN got my attention but saw that ingredient and now have to think of a modification.

This was my first time making home made veggie burgers and I wanted to create a much healthier version of the Morning Star Farms black bean burger (which I love). Mine unfortunately came out really dry and bland. I followed the advice of others to substitute bread crumbs for rolled oats- maybe that is why? I’m pretty bummed and still in search of a good veggie burger recipe.

I made it vegan by replacing the egg with chia seeds. take 1 tbsp of chia seeds with hot water and  allow it to sit and gelatinize. Once you get to the recipe where  you're supposed to the egg, I took 1 tbsp of the gelatinized chia seeds and added it to the black bean mixture. It worked perfectly! Oh and I did drain my beans and the bell pepper and onion mixture, I highly recommend it.

I've made this a few times.  
The last time, I bumped it up from three stars by  adding portobello mushrooms, and some grated parm to the mix.  More breadcrumbs were needed.  Next time, I'll add some dried parsley.  Used my food processor for the entire process, finishing with adding the beans and just giving it a few pulses to break them up.  Simple, easy, tasty.  Froze them on a sheet pan, then packed them up.

I've been using this recipe for a while and they're really tasty.  It's quite versatile if  you want  to try other spices.  I follow the directions exactly and the patties hold together pretty well.

Kelly is right-- rinse and dry the beans before mashing. Squeeze every drop of fluid out of the onions and peppers. I used only a little more of the bread crumbs than called for (maybe mine were super dry?) and the patties held up fine. Added more Thai chili sauce because I like it! Next time I will make a spicy cucumber and vinegar relish (needs a little crunchy texture).

This was my first time making these burgers. I did make some substitutions I added  Worcestershire sauce, Liptons onion soup mix, Sazon, and some ritz crackers. It turned out great. I did not have any problems with them falling apart or being to wet. I also formed my patties using food prep gloves and added veggie oil on gloves so they would not stick. I will make these again. Thanks!

Great recipe! The only things I did different was to bake the black beans first at 350 for 15-20 minutes to dry them out a bit (I believe it keeps the burgers from being mushy) And I sauteed  the onions & pepper first.  I made a spicy mayo sauce to spread on top & had on a warm pretzel roll. Delicious! Even my meat loving husband loved these & asked when we're having again.

This recipe is to die for! For those that put the beans in the processor to mash up like me, it may be more loose than you want it. Once all ingredients are combined I just added more bread crumbs to make it less soupy and stick together. I added seasoning salt on top before baking. With 10 minutes left, I took some yellow onions and green apples and caramelized them in a skillet adding cinnamon. The burger turned out sooooo good!  To make it spicier add more hot sauce or spicy sauce that you prefer or even consider adding holepeños when pulsing the onion, bell pepper, and garlic. I hope you all enjoy the recipe as much as I do!

This was my first attempt at making a black bean burger and I was pleasantly surprised!!! I did make some changes so that's why the 4 star review and not 5. Like some other reviewers stated, to keep the burgers from falling apart after rinsing and draining the beans, I dried them with a paper towel. Also after chopping the peppers, onions and garlic in the food processor I drained them on a paper towel as well. I had to add an additional 1/4 cup bread crumbs to hold it together. I used italian style panko bread crumbs.  For some variety, I substituted equal parts red and green pepper. Yummy!!!

I usually try to make a recipe how it’s written, but after reading reviews I did the following:  I used red bell pepper, I drained and rinsed the black beans, dried them with paper towels, and mashed them with my squiggly potato masher. I used oats in the food processor - 1/2 cup. I put the onions and bell pepper in the food processor and drained them well on paper towels.  I used about a half table spoon of cumin since most people said it was over powering. Everything else I did as written. I made 3 patties, refrigerated them for about 1/2 hour, then fried them in a pan with olive oil. They were never runny, formed into patties well and were great! I think I had too much bell pepper because that was the main flavor but they were really good. I salted and peppered them like regular hamburgers. I never had a veggie burger before but will definitely make these again.

*Updated - I had to take a star away. My husband fessed up that he was pretty lukewarm about this and doesn't especially want it again.

Loved it! I put in two jalapenos and just half an onion. I didn't have an egg, so I subbed it  with 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil and water mixed with 1 teaspoon baking powder. Also, mixed in the whole box of panko crust to keep it together while grilling. Grilled on a small indoor grill and it come out good.

This recipe was super easy. Like others, my mix was a little too mushy so I added oats and made more patties. I froze the patties so they would be easier to work with the next day. Popped them in the air fryer with a spray of olive oil for 10 mins and it was tasty. Next time I’ll use less cumin, and perhaps add some soy sauce or something else to give it different flavor.

Wonderful bean burger recipe! I accidentally  used sweetened black beans so it ended up more like a meat loaf flavor. Still delicious though!

These were delicious. After mixing ingredients put in refrigerator to cool until I made them. They held together great and I baked them in an oiled pan at 375 for about 20 minutes , flipping them at 10 minutes.

I'm not a fan of veggie burgers but it was ok.  Used 2 egg yolks, 1 tsp. cumin, no hot sauce, froze the patties.  Family finds that if you add enough dressings, like mushrooms, it's decent.  I think cooking them in the skillet would have upped the rating.

I'm a meat eater (possibly former) and cannot believe how easy and delicious this is. I used a splash of soy sauce and a prime rib rub (celery salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder). Topped it with cheese and warm sun-dried tomatoes. OMG SO GOOD!

I used 1/2 a red bell pepper instead. I added a cap full of olive oil (so it wouldn't be too dry). I decided to put the beans in the processor with the onions and bell pepper.  I ended up baking them, and I thought they were delicious!

First time ever having black bean burgers and it won't be our last. I reviewed several reviews to ensure I picked some of the tried and true suggested changes and I'm glad that I did. I ensured the beans were drained/dried and also I strained the onion mixture. The burgers were great. I added sea salt, pepper and a dash of creole seasoning - just cause.

I made a few changes based on others' recommendations. I increased the breadcrumbs (half panko and half seasoned breadcrumbs), the cumin, and added an extra egg. I also did what one reviewer said about drying off the beans first. I didn't have a bell pepper, so I cooked up a cup of mixed frozen veg (carrots, beans, and corn), drained and squeezed it out, and then added that to the food processor with the beans. I also added a good douse of Tony Chachere's Cajun seasoning, too, and they were very tasty! When summer comes, we will be trying these out on the grill. Glad I tried them!

These were the worst!! Way too mush to put between a bun. We had to put them in a tortilla and add shredded cheese...which made them vegetarian not vegan. My family ate them but I passed.

Fabulous recipes. 3 out of 4 family members requested it again.  I did rinse my black beans and let them dry (and made sure the onions and peppers weren't to juicy). Kept together very well during baking.

This homemade Black Bean Veggie Burger was great!! I followed the ingredients and directions exactly. The only thing I did differently was rinse the black beans and drain on a cotton napkin for maybe an hour before mashing..Cooked in my cast iron pan with a little coconut oil. I didn’t have any problems with them falling apart as others have stated.Then served on onion buns with my homemade ketchup and a homemade dill spear. Yum!!

I  made the burgers  exactly per your  recipe. I did not care for them. Way, way too much cumin and chili powder for the amount of beans. It tasted like a pure spoonful of cumin and chili in my mouth. I love beans and in my culture we use cumin all the time. But this amount was completely over powering.

I too had a hard time keeping this from crumbling apart, so I recommend adding a 2nd egg, and being sure to drain all water from beans and other ingredients before adding them.

I also substituted rolled oats for the bread crumbs—they're more nutritious and have more fiber. 

Finally, if you fry these in a pan or on a griddle, I recommend you add a few tablespoons of oil (e.g. olive oil) to keep them from sticking to the cooking surface.

My husband & I were looking for new ideas for dinner and these veggie burgers were amazing! Very filling & tasty. I’ll definitely make them again and next time I want use as much Thi Chili Sauce. It was a little spicy for me but again, my husband loved the spice. I hope you enjoy them as much as we did!

I followed this recipe as listed, except I used rolled oats instead of breadcrumbs (because I didn't have breadcrumbs on hand),I hand chopped the veggies into tiny pieces, and per a reviewer I rinsed and dried the beans.  Like another reviewer said, these did turn out very crumbly, however, they also turned out really tasty. I'll definitely make again.

I made this recipe as directed, however I didn’t use the food processor to chop my veggies. I finely minced them up with my knife so I didn’t have to worry about draining the extra water from them, as many others have mentioned. After I mixed them all up, I put them into a bowl and divided them into four sections and refrigerated for 2-3 hours. They were very easy to form and the patties came out just like a hamburger. I will give these 5 stars!!!

So happy to find this recipe! Actually doubled the recipe, because why go through the trouble for only 4 burgers? Even my one year old liked them! I didn’t add the hot sauce, but I will add salt and pepper next time.

Made these burgers and they came out great.  For a gluten-free option, I used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs.  However, next time - I think I will grind or blend the oatmeal first so it blends in well.

This is definitely an easy recipe especially if you bake the burgers. As some reviews have stated issues with the burgers falling apart I for one did not experience this. I did double the recipe and instead of adding a cup of bread crumbs I simply added until I got the right consistency. This is a 4-5 star recipe for someone that enjoys vegetarian food (like my wife) I simple do not. Definitely some room for growth with it as next time I will perhaps add more hot sauce or maybe mushrooms and Swiss?!

This recipe is great! I added an extra 1/4 cup of bread crumbs and doubled the recipe to freeze.

Update: I’ve made this recipe a number of times and it really is the best  recipe. I get a 16 oz bag of dry black beans, quadruple the recipe and freeze them for summer grilling.

This is the first time I make these. The flavour is very rich but the consistency is not right. I dried the beans and drained the onions and bell peppers as suggested by other posts, and still needed to add more than three times the amount of breadcrumbs!

This was my first time making black bean burgers. I mostly, but didn't quite, follow the recipe exactly. I added finely diced mushrooms for texture and earthiness, and some parsley after mixing everything else together. I also used 1/4 cup rolled oats and 1/4 cup plus about 3 tablespoons of bread crumbs. I accidentally grabbed my Thai curry paste instead of Thai chili paste and it smelled funny prior to cooking but it blended right in and just added some good flavor.  If I'd used more diced mushroom and another 1/4 cup of bread crumbs, these could almost pass for beef burgers. They smell great and give a satisfying sizzle while they're cooking and get nice and brown and crispy on the outside. I had no problem with them falling apart. Thank you!

So good! Recommend not overdoing the veggies in the food processor. While no one wants a huge chunk of onion or green pepper in a bite of a black bean burger, if the veggies are too pureed it gets a little watery and can make the patties mushier. However,  I kinda like/expect black bean burgers to be a bit mushy so they were still AMAZING. I made them for my family, and they LOVED them. Added a slice of provolone cheese two minutes before taking the patties out of the oven. Pairs great with sweet potato wedge fries.

My first time ever making veggie burgers and this was absolutely delicious! I followed tips provided from another review which stated to strain the beans, peppers, garlic and onions so the mix wouldn't be too moist. I added fresh ginger, mushrooms and carrots. I love spicy food so i also added cayenne pepper and salt to taste. I was very pleased. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Good base but I like heat, so I added more hot sauce, Savory Spice Shop Hot Chili Powder, ditched the bell peppers, added Jalapeno's.  Got a little carried away with new food processor and ended up with a close to puree mixture but drained the excess water and added a tiny bit more bread crumbs and all was good.

Not too bad. Next time I will saute the onions and decrease the cumin. The cumin overwhelms the recipe. It also needs salt! I used Panko breadcrumbs and the burgers stayed together perfectly.  A great base to experiment with and create your own version of the recipe.

I added 1/2 cup of chopped portabello mushrooms and 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar. This gave it a meatier texture and the cheese was a hit with the kids.

The flavor was AMAZING. The only reason I took off one star was because they fell apart and clearly need much more breadcrumbs. I read the reviews and put 3/4 cup and they still fell apart, even after I froze them! 
BUT  THEY WERE SO TASTY. 100% would make again.

I found this dish very good and easy enough to make, but having read others' comments, I'd agree that I'd use less cumin by half, make sure to strain the veggies after they come from the food processor, and increase the bread crumbs from the original amount by about half.  I loved the versatility of this dish. It does serve as a burger with mustard, ketshup, and dill pickle, but it also makes a nice toping to a spinach salad.  I have yet to include it in an omlet, but I suspect it would work nicely there too.  I"ll make it again for sure.

I'm NOT a vegiatrian and don't nomally try recipes from that category unless it gets some pretty high reviews. Well...you guys let me down. Followed this recipe to the letter and gave up eating it at the half way point. The whole family just chalked it up to "it's just one meal" saying when a dinner doesn't turn out well. We all went to bed hungry that night. Tastes too much like beans and cumin. No good texture and definately NOT worth the time it takes to prepare.

I have  began transitioning to vegan.  I love a great burger and I don't like the mushy texture of the frozen black bean patties.  This recipe was delicious and will be come a regular item for us.I followed this recipe to the letter with  two exceptions: 1) I added additional bread crumbs to create a firmer burger.  I didn't measure it, I just added and mixed until I found the correct the texture I was looking for.  2) I added a few sprinkles of "Slap Your Mama's" cajun seasoning.  It was delicious!!

2017-11-23 - I made this as written, except that I omitted the bell peppers and cumin, and I cooked in a frying pan instead of baking/grilling.  These were okay.  With two cups of beans cooked from dry (and then rinsed and drained), these held together well in the pan.  The flavoring of Thai chili sauce and chili powder didn't seem to work well for the burger, but it wasn't terrible.  The texture of just mashed beans + breadcrumbs was far too smooth and mealy.  If I make these again, I think maybe I'd sauté the onion and garlic, or roast the garlic, and try different flavorings.  Instead of breadcrumbs, I might follow another review and use 1.5 cups quick oats.  (We ate these as part of garbage plates.)

Followed the exact recipe and the burgers came out great! I was surprised at how good they were considering they have no meat. I baked mine for ten min on each side and it was good :)

I didn’t use the peppers or cumin, I used garlic powder instead of fresh but my daughter still loved them.  Her comment was “They are AMAZING!!! Better than a restaurant.”  I cut out burger bun size tortillas and lightly grilled them for the “bun”.

I absolutely love this recipe. I've made it a few times now, and so far my favorite version is to top the burgers with arugula, ranch dressing, and guacamole. Using a nice fresh bun adds to it as well. I did reduce the cumin to half in my burgers and added some jalapeño for a little heat. LOVE IT!

FIVE STARS
These are the best bean burgers we have ever eaten. My husband didn't want to like them but after one bite he was asking for more. 
I will never buy frozen veggie burgers again.

Turned out great! The only issue I had was that the mixture was too wet. However, I did not have breadcrumbs and used oats instead. To fix I just added almond flour and GF flour. 
Next time I would love to add corn and cilantro for added flavor.

These burgers are good but just way too spicy using the amounts listed. I love spicy food, but these made me cough they were so spicy. I did use hot sauce as opposed to chili sauce and that probably made a big difference. If you don't have chili sauce and are using hot sauce, use half the amount listed if you want a mildly spicy burger, and even less if you don't want a distinctly spicy flavor in your burgers.

No bad. Good flavor although I thought it had too much "taco ish" type flavor. I baked on flexipan in oven. Not very crispy on the outside. Hubby gave a quick grill and fixed that before eating. Good protein alternative, bummer such high carb.

Made the recipe exactly as written. The spice flavour was way too strong... we didn't enjoy it at all. But it could be better with some adjustments (cut the cumin for sure).

Meh. Wasn't bad. But I don't think I'll do that again. The taste of the beans was too intense I guess. I thought it would taste more like the spices...

It was delicious but of course I added more seasonings to it.
Red pepper and onions, black pepper!!
For the breadcrumbs I didn't have , I used whole wheat crackers and put them in the blender and that made it thicker but otherwise this recipe was too simple and still don't hold together when you want to shape the burger.

I followed the directions except reduced the cumin as stated by many.  This may be a good base; however, it is not a complete burger for me.  If someone out there has a good recipe that is an easy to make black bean burger, I would love to try it.  There are way too many bad recipes out there for vegetarian burgers.  I appreciate all the comments but they are not complete enough to make my own burger using them.

Too much cumin. There was a bit of a bitter after taste. I will try making this again with some adjustments.

I love these burgers.  I think they would be delish as taco filling too - just crumble.
I make these vegan by using flax meal and water to sub for egg.
Really good.

These are tasty and filling. As we were eating these, my partner and I kept thinking of different variations that would work with this recipe. I baked them, but next time I think I'll fry them to get a bit more of a crusty exterior.

Used this recipe with substituting egg with flaxseed gel, will make it again. Much better than buying the frozen ones.

Mine turned out more like veggie sloppy joe's, but I think that's because I added zucchini and summer squash. It was pretty tasty though!

I didn't add as much of the Sriracha sauce, but I did add extra bread crumbs as suggested by another user. Turned out great. The only thing is that I left them in the oven for longer so that the outside was a little crispy.

I was a skeptic. But now I am in LOVE! Def will make again. Maybe tomorrow! 

Did not have green pepper, so I did without. Was perfect anyways. Followed the suggestions that I ensured my onions and beans were dried very very well.  Baked in oven, topped with some grated parm. DELICIOUS!!

I made these for the first time for my vegetarian friends and they said that these were the best black bean burgers ever!  Asked for the recipe!!!  
The recipe was easy to follow and used ingredients that I already had on hand.

The flavor was good, but just reading all the directions sounded like a lot of work so hubby made these.  He said the consistency wasn't conducive for grilling, made to many dishes & what I thought, to much work.  I'll keep to my Morning Star Grillers. 10/26/2019 - didn't know we'd tried this back in 2017 & saved the recipe again. Our feelings haven't changed, except now I didn't care for it at all, but we ate it. Way to much work & to many dishes. Hopefully we don't do this anymore.

I made this recipe for the first time today and it was tasty. I omitted the yellow peppers as I didn't have any. Instead of hot sauce I added ground scotch bonnet pepper. I added a little more bread crumbs to hold it together. I think I'll play around with the flavors a little more next time. Maybe add brown rice to it or corn.

I loved this burger recipe!  I put the black beans in the oven on 250' until they started to break open and then added them to the mixture, I also followed the recommendation of another reviewer and squeezed out the excess moisture from the peppers and onion.  No problems whatsoever of the burgers falling apart.  I am making them again tonight!  I made a fresh guacamole as a topping which was perfect!

I made the burgers and they were great!  I didn't have any trouble with keeping the burgers together. I mashed the bean and blended a pepper, a jalapeno pepper and cilantro, then added the spices and some breadcrumbs and the burgers held together very nicely. My daughter actually ate them and told me she liked them and she can be fussy. I made them again tonight and thought they were quick and easy to make.

These are so dang tasty.  I double the chili powder, put a slice of cheese on the birder and toast ciabatta bread for the bun.  A good alternative to a hamburger.

Was looking for something different to make and found this recipe saved in my favorites from awhile back, thought I'd give it try-with 2K saves and a ton of great reviews it was worth a shot- WOW were these delicious! Entire family loved them too! I used 2 eggs in mine and 1 cup of panko bread crumbs, baked 375 for 20 minutes, flipping half way through. I will be trying these on the grill next.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These were very good! I was making them with my grandson, so we did cut down on the spices. I did follow the advice of other reviewers to dry the beans. After rinsing thoroughly, I poured them out on a paper towel. By the time we were done chopping veg, they had dried enough.

I saw this recipe and with the many favorable comments decided to make it...LOVED IT!!!  I made it with all the ingredients except for the green pepper. I used three (yellow, orange and red) mini sweet peppers. If anything, the flavor was enhanced.  Will definitely make these again.

DO NOT use a food processor on the black beans.  It will come out like a paste that goes on a burrito.  
The taste was pretty good.

This was my second time and I tweaked the recipe a bit by adding a good pinch of sea salt,  frozen corn and shredded carrots. I also chilled it for about 1/2 an hour before forming the patties.

Super easy and can all be done right in food processor. I placed onion, red bell pepper and about five baby carrots in first. Then added beans and gave a few pulses. Added bread crumbs, eggs and seasonings.  I added onion powder instead if garlic and added a little salt. To shape, I placed a piece of seran wrap in bottom of a hamburger shaped container and then added 1/2 cup of mixture and pressed down. It pulled right out and wrapped up neatly and individually for freezer.  I doubled recipe and made 8 patties.

These were great. My 12 yo vegetarian daughter loved it, and she generally doesn't like veggie burgers. Her comment, "this is basically a bean burrito in a bun."  She wants me to make them again soon, so I know this will be a summer grill staple. 

A couple of things you need to know: 1. The mixture is too wet as written. I added about twice the amount of breadcrumbs (panko) and they were still soft, but worked well.  Second, it needed salt.

First time I have had a black bean burger and it was delicious!  No problem holding together.  I lightly floured my hands as I formed patties and pan fried in tiny amount of canola oil making a nice crust.   This recipe is very adaptable to individual taste....as a reminder to me I used TBL of Gochujang hot sauce and was pleased with the spice it added.

This is a favorite dish in my house. I ease back on the spices a bit though. Add some Southwest Ranch on top of the patty when it's all done and you won't regret it. Delicious!!

Fantastic! This burger is absolutely delicious. I reduced one star, though, because like others, I found the mixture a bit wet at first in spite of drying my beans with a paper towel after rinsing. I added 1/2 cup of rolled oats, though, and it was perfect. And with the extra bulk, I got 5 burgers out of the recipe. I also added 1 Tbs of ground coriander, because I thought it would be good. Otherwise, made it exactly as written. This is going to be a staple in my house--easy, cheap, and healthy. I melted a little cheese on top and ate with salsa. Might try the leftovers with some sliced avocado.

I absolutely loved these.  It was like eating a hamburger again.   I tasted it before cooking and thought there would be way too much chili powder, but once cooked it wasn't that strong.  I might cut back some next time or even try different seasonings, but they were still great.  
I also had a problem, with them not keeping their shape when turning, but I'll just try to reduce the liquid more next time.  Overall, a great recipe.

Very good burgers but still fell apart. I did everything it said. I omitted the bread crumbs the second time and it held better.

Not a fan here. They were OK and maybe would be better with different spice blend. I have had veggie burgers that tasted better than this.

I made these for the first time. Family loved them. What I did for it not to be so wet is fried it with a little olive oil until crispy on both sides then placed them in the oven for 15 minutes to make sure the ingredients were cooked thoroughly. Next time I'll add corn. Thanks for the recipe.

This was an awesomely delicious recipe with 2 minor adjustments. 
I used boiled black beans (I try to stay away from canned and box foods as much as I can) and my own homemade bread crumbs. 
Only part I have to master is getting the burger to stay together., since this was my first ever veggie burger. 
I may use two eggs next time or maybe add some flax-egg to it.

Good burgers! I must have made them smaller than the recipe intended as I had 8 burgers in total. That's great though - we had 4 this weekend and we're freezing the other 4 for another time! :)

These were really good!  I followed other reviewers' advice and dried the beans/drained the onion/pepper mixture to cut down on wetness.  I left out the hot sauce because I wanted the toddler to eat it.  He actually ate them, so it was a winner!

Absolutely wonderful flavor. Be sure to dry the beans a bit before mashing, and be careful not to take away all of the texture in the beans when mashing. There will be juice in food processor after creating the garlic, onion and green pepper mixture so drain that out a bit too. I added salt and a couple of tablespoons of toasted slivered almonds very lightly chopped and about 4 more tblsp bread crumbs. We made four and ate two one night and put other two in fridge for next night. To reheat I put them uncovered in microwave for about 44 seconds, the crisped up in medium high heat frying pan with a bit of olive oil. Just as good next day. We put red onion, pickles, avocado, tomato and lettuce on ours. Really tasty favorite (and I love a good hamburger, but this A GREAT alternative).

I was super excited to make this dish but ended up disappointed, I personally wasn't a big fan of the chili powder and cumin mix and my parents didn't like how much like beans it tasted. So the concept was good but this recipe just wasn't for us.

This recipe is not five stars how it is, hence I am giving it 5 stars anyway because I am reviewing myself in the comment section and not the actual recipe. Anyhoo, instead of black beans I used angus beef and I used rolled oats instead of bread crumbs and steak sauce instead of chili sauce and a jalapeño peppwe instead of a bell pepper and seasoned with cumin, garlic powder and lime juice. And it was a BIG HIT!!! My hubs devoured them before they even came off the grill!!! (Oh hubs!!) I did have to skip the cheese for my 27 1/2 month old son because he's lactose intolerant but he LOVED these!!! Definitely making again!!!!!

There is not really anything unique about this recipe from dozens of of other bean burger recipes. I used freshly prepared beans, a mixture of black, small red, and pintos. It takes a lot more that the recommended amount of bread crumbs to dry it out enough to form a pattie. This might have been due to the freshly made beans. However, I both fried this and baked it. Both firmed up nicely.
Next time I will use fresh bread run through a food processor instead of bread crumbs. Should absorb more moisture and be a little less mealy. It might also be interesting to use Provencal-like seasonings like sage, thyme and rosemary for a different flavor.

I mixed it up and baked one. Very good! Then I "improved" it for my taste, which I won't go into, because it turns into a different recipe. I know that makes some people crazy...! If you bake them in the oven, use parchment paper, rather than tin foil, to line the baking sheet. I found my first burger in two pieces - top and bottom - because it stuck to the foil so badly! ("Improvement" involves lots of sriracha sauce, few drops of Worcestershire sauce,  more breadcrumbs to offset the extra liquid, mushrooms, sun dried tomato bits and some small dice chayote for extra crunch, among other things. See? I told you it would be a different recipe!)
I really liked it as written though!

These were extremely tasty.  The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because they didn't hold together very well.  I cooked them in the oven.  Perhaps if I left them in a little longer than 20 minutes they would have firmed up a little better.  Didn't want to dry them out too much though.

I made it as is although baked longer since patties were starting to fall apart when I tried to turn them at 10 minutes. It did not make them dry like I thought it might. Also, my meat eating husband said he LOVED these and couldn't tell it wasn't a real burger.  I would definitely make this recipe again!

My attempt at making my own instead of buying at the store! I did read through some reviews and took note of changes. I made my own substitutions tailoring to WW points which came to 4 SP. I cut the cumin in half, added an ear of cooked corn on the cob and grated carrot for personal taste. I also added some smokey paprika, and I used quick oats that I blended down a little finer because that's what I had in the pantry. Prep was probably the biggest change I made as I was fearful of them being too wet and I also wanted a quicker cook time after freezing. After chopping the onion, red pepper and grated carrots I sprayed a baking dish with Pam and put them covered in the oven at 300 till they were tender. I took care of making sure the beans and onion mixture was strained and most of moisture was out. I also believe precooking the veggies drew quite a bit of moisture out. This was a very good recipe. Thanks!

These burgers are absolutely stunning and I would recommend anyone to try them out. For spices I would try and taste and add what you like, I myself added salt and cayenne pepper. I also used red beans in stead of black ones.

However, since the recipe is quite heavy and full in itself in terms of flavor, I countered it with a pinch of lemon juice. Not a lot but just to balance the fullness with a little bit of freshness. 

TLDR; I'd add more spices and some lemon juice to add some freshness.

I didn't have black beans so I used kidney beans and I didn't have chili seasoning  I used  cayenne pepper...it came out a little spicy but my family thought it was still good...I would definitely try this recipe again but I will make sure I have all of the ingredients before hand. I just didn't feel
Like going to the store..I worked with what I had.

My omnivore husband loves these. I use rolled oats instead of breadcrumbs and add about 2 tbs more than a half cup which helps the burgers hold together better. I also use a food processor to combine ingredients, putting the beans in last and just pulsing a few times so the mixture doesn’t get too mushy. We like them well done. Serve with sliced tomato and avocado, with sweet potato fries and coleslaw on the side. So much better than store-bought!

It  was really good. I also added mushrooms in the food processor. However, I needed 2 eggs to hold everything together. I made 6 smaller patties to go with the size of my buns. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was wicked easy and super yummy! I followed the recipe to the 3 except on the seasoning... I'm nursing so I didn't use hot sauce but I'm sure that would have made it.

Awesome and making a double batch today. Substituted ground oatmeal for bread crumbs (and used extra), no green peppers, and added salsa & corn.  Will try with brown rice.

I followed the recipe with the exception of the bread crumbs.  I crumbled Organic Blue Tortilla Chips(really fine) to substitute the bc.  I also added cooked organic black rice that I had left over. ?? These two worked to make a sticking agent.  I baked the (5)patties on a cookie sheet at 375° for about 13 minutes on each side.  I wanted to make sure they were done. Scrumptious!! Thank you for this recipe!

This veggie burger fills you up. When you are mixing it up it seems like you are mixing ground meat that has already been browned. Great tasting too.

A good recipe. I made the dish exactly as written...but I didn't have  "chili sauce". I took the advice of others and blotted out as much moisture as possible from the beans, and the bell pepper, onion, garlic mixture before I formed the patties. I baked mine. I think this recipe is a great base recipe that you can get creative with according to your own personal tastes.

Like many comments said, it came out a bit too liquidy for patties.  Instead, I put it in a casserole dish and served it that way.  Added a jalapeno, but it didn't add much heat.  Used oatmeal instead of bread and  it worked fine.  Also put avocados on it and kind of mixed it with a salad.  Mmmmm.

Thankfully I saw someone else's review about reducing the cumin and adding a bit of salt (1/4 tsp). I used 1 tsp cumin and that was enough. I didnt feel like messing with the food processor so diced the veggies up and tossed them in with the beans.  As long as you dice them or grate them, you are fine. I also cooked them in the skillet and they were really good. It is really similar to a recipe from Cooking Light that I like excep for the Thai chili paste and diced bell pepper. The chili paste in it was very good.

These burgers came out delicious.  I gave it four stars only because I changed it slightly according to other reviews that said they fell apart.  I added an extra egg and rinsed and dried the black beans before mashing.  I also squeezed out the extra water from the chopped onion before mixing in.  They came out the perfect consistency.  Next time I might try just using onion powder instead to make it easier.

Delicious, as recommended by my significant other's daughter who loves figs in her veggie burger, but doesn't like bell peppers. I substituted figs for the bell pepper and they turned out great. A big hit with both of them.

Delicious burgers! I followed the recipe exactly as written. My only criticism is that they were a bit too crumbly and tended to fall apart. I'll definitely make these again, but my second attempt will include adding an extra egg for additional binding.

I have made made black bean burgers before but I love this recipe now. My husband and I both ate 2 burgers tonight. We loved them! I did add a half cup more of italian bread crumbs and sriracha mayo instead of the chili sauce. They came out with a lot of flavor. We will be making these again soon.

I really liked this burger. It held together well and cooked up crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. If your mixture won't stay together, try letting it rest in the fridge for an hour to let it firm up. We topped ours with avocado.

Wonderful! Definitely use 50% more breadcrumbs and lessen the cumin to 1.5 teaspoons. I also used two small eggs and they stuck perfectly! I dried the beans very well and removed the water from the onions/peppers by sauteing them for a few minutes as others had suggested. A touch of salt and these was delicious!! I made 3 giant burgers instead of 4 as I like to use big ciabatta rolls :-) This is now a go-to!!

Not bad, but not great. They're lacking something and there's definitely a bit of blandness. 

I followed the recipe to a T, but reduced the amount of cumin and added a bit more breadcrumbs and some salt.

I had no problems with the mixture sticking together, that was fine. They didn't fall apart once, and I didn't even strain the vegetables, so not sure why people are having that problem.

All in all, they're OK. I'll need to experiment with them if I want them to taste great though.

I'm not a vegetarian, just on a diet, and we do need to cut our cholesterol as my husband's has been a little high (so we do need to cut down the meat). These are absolutely delicious! Even my hardcore meat eater husband really likes these. Making them again tonight! Followed the recipe exactly. Now a staple for our family. :)

The black bean burgers are amazing! Everyone I have given these to like them so much more than store bought.  I recommend baking them in oven at 375 for approximately 15 minutes per side. I also recommend doubling the recipe then freezing them for later

I loved these. I was a vegetarian for a few years, and I've had a few in restaurants, but never made my own. I copied a lot of commenters, putting in 3/4 cups of bread crumbs and a little less cumin. Otherwise, absolutely amazing!

I made this as suggested by others to reduce sogginess of burgers.  Paper towel drained everything to remove moisture, dried out beans before mashing, froze them before cooking,  and doubled breadcrumbs..They still came out mushy, but the flavor was very good.

I will add that I was unable to grill these so tried to cook them under the broiler in a hot cast iron skillet.  Perhaps the grill is the secret key to getting better consistency and as I didn't cook 100% to recipe by using broiler I didn't want to downgrade beyond one star.

It was delicious. Im no chef but this was easy to prepare and cook. Agreed with other posts that you need to remove excess water from onion and peppers. Which I did by using a paper towel and blotting them. I also used panko bread crumbs since they are less fattening, but needed to double up on the panko to keep it together.  My 7 year old twins loved them and my manly man meat eater husband liked them as well! Perfect mix of protein and fiber that is needed for my current pregnancy!

I made these yesterday and they were great. Other reviewers wrote about them falling apart mine were just right and firm. I followed the recipe exactly except I used half breadcrumbs and half oatmeal. I put them in the freezer after making them because I wasn't eating them right away. The flavor was just right better than store bought. I don't like using a lot of breadcrumbs and I think oatmeal is better nutritionally. I will definitely make them again. Thanks for the recipe

I selected this recipe because I would like to cut more meat from my diet. I followed the recipe except I substituted oatmeal for bread crumbs. I baked the patties and they held together well, but I suspect they would fall apart if I had tried to grill them. Other reviews suggest adding an additional egg or squeezing out extra liquid from the chopped veggies, but I don't think that's necessary if your plan to bake. I liked the ratio of spices, but next time I'll add salt. I'll also experiment with different spices and add other types of veggies.

My family loved the burgers and they are tough critics!  I didn't put in the garlic or cumin and I used just slightly less breadcrumbs than the recipe called for and the burgers were perfectly moist and didn't fall apart when I baked them.   I will never buy frozen veggie burgers again.

As mentioned in reviews, I rinsed and dried the beans and then I used  the same pastry cloth to dry the finely chopped onion and green pepper. The flavor wasn't bad. I agree they don't turn out hot at all (that's good), however, I think a little liquid smoke would've improved the flavor. A big help would be to make sure the burgers are thin! I grilled them with a typical one inch thickness and pressed down the center and they turned out pasty in the middle.  Sorry, but the quantity of work (utensils and drying) combined with the texture didn't make this recipe worth it.

First I have to say I was BLOWN away with the amount of flavor and how great these were. I didn’t miss eating a beef patty. The consistency wasn’t bad not too mushy and not to solid perfect. I was so excited to share these with my coworkers. I will have to be HONEST “THIS WAS MY FIRST EVER BLACK BEAN BURGER” and have been wanting to order one for some time now. I am more than HAPPY that I made this myself because I do not think anything will compare to these.  
I did follow other reviewer’s suggestion when it came to freeze them night before and to strain the bell pepper and onion mixture. 
1.	I did rinse and strain the black beans really well and let sit for a little. 
2.	The bell pepper and onion finely chopped in a ninja was more of a slush mixture. I definitely needed to strain the mixture really well but using a mesh strainer and hand before adding to the black mixture smash. This took about 10 to 20 minutes to get a lot of the liquid out. 
3.	Egg mixture- I didn’t have all the spices that was suggested. Instead of the chili powder and cumin I used: paprika, oregano and cayenne pepper. I aslo added black pepper and garlic salt (these I eyeballed the measurement). I used the Asian hot sauce with the green lid (Sambal Oelek, ground fresh chili paste)
4. I used Ritz crackers rather than bread crumbs. 
5.	I freezed them the night before 
6.	Baked at 350 degrees on both sides for 10 minutes each. 
a.	Here I failed to grease the cookie sheet/foil so they stuck to the foil a ta

I make these every few months. They are delicious! One tip: after you make the patties FREEZE them for at least ten minutes, that way they don't fall apart when you pan fry them.

Good base recipe though the cumin and the chili were overpowering.... will do it again with teaspoons of the previous two and not tablespoon.... the patty held onto to its shape easily especially for cooking in the oven

I pureed the onion, bell pepper and garlic....added about 1/4 cup more bread crumbs....substituted Tiger Sauce for the Chili Sauce and cooked them on a griddle indoors....quite good actually and they weren't too wet ....key for me was: mashing beans with my hand vs a fork....adding the other ingredients, I don't go exactly by recipes per se.....I added enough bread crumbs to counteract the 'wetness'.....overall...not a bad alternative burger!

I added an additional egg as well as a 1/2 cup more of bread crumbs, fresh copped parsley and one small can of corn (drained) after they were done cooking we
topped the burgers with sliced avocado, tomato and tzatziki sauce
 My husband and I thought they were very tasty.
I will make again for sure.

This recipe is a 5/5 with some changes, here's what I did. I used 2 cans of beans, 2 aneheim peppers, 1/2 onion, 1 carrot, cilantro, 5 garlic cloves, 3 egg yolks, breadcrumbs to texture, spices(cayenne, cumin, and chili powder), salt, and pepper. Blend the vegetables and strain out the excess fluid. Mash the black beans in a bowl. Beat the egg yolks with the spices. Add all ingredients together and add breadcrumbs until the mixture can be formed into patties that hold their shape. I cooked on a cast iron skillet, get the skillet medium-high with a splash of oil and try to get a crust on the burgers. Don't be afraid of over-cooking these things, they have plenty of moisture in them. Makes 8 patties, freeze before cooking for later use.

Super easy and delicious! I used a food processor to do everything but add the bread crumbs. Used a hamburger press and about a quarter cup of mix per burger. Served up with Romaine lettuce, Roma tomatoes, and whole grain buns. Will definitely be making these again!

These were delicious! I made minor variations based on suggestions from others, I used 2 eggs and added breadcrumbs until the consistency felt right. (about 3/4 cup) Also I'm not fond of green pepper, so I used orange pepper. Added a bit of carrots as well. I finely chopped everything and then dabbed the veggies with a paper towel to pick up as much excess moisture as possible. I thought the spice was right on, but I didn't measure... I add spice until it "feels" right for my palate.  Also made a Siracha mayo to top them with, because I like spice. VERY good recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Made EXACTLY as described. Watery slurry is what I got. Added enough bread crumbs to get it into patty form. Baked 10 minutes per side as per directions (fell apart when trying to flip). Still lukewarm inside; used meat thermometer, 102 degrees. Baked another 20 minutes... took out, fell apart.

I didn't have a chance to read reviews and just forwarded the recipe to my husband who made it tonight. These burgers were awesome with no changes to the recipe! They definitely seemed like they might be too wet and not hold together but we made them on the grill and it worked out great.

Made this last night and loved it! I followed the ingredients as written but used less cumin as it is not my fav spice. It had a nice kick to it, not overwhelming, just enough spice to give it some flavor. To keep the patties from being too watery, I dried the beans and chopped veggies on paper towels for a few minutes before mixing and let the mixture sit in the fridge for an hour before forming the patties. The burgers held together nicely. Topped it with guacamole, jalapeños, lettuce and tomato. Definitely will make this again!

Flavor combo is incredible and very easy.  It was time to start incorporating more meatless meals into my diet and this definitely fit the bill.   I prefer less seasoning so I made a few changes... 1/4 onion, 2 garlic, added corn, chopped cilantro, added more bread crumbs,  salt/pepper and dredged patty in flour then sauté in coconut oil.  Next time I will cut the cumin to 1 tsp also.  Made the chipotle mayo and topped with spinach, tomato, and avocado.  So, so yummy!

I will preface this with the fact that I don't eat veggie burgers ever.  I was, however, having a BBQ with a vegetarian guest, so thought I would make these for him.  He thought they were pretty good.  I had one, just to see.  It just tasted like a spicy bean patty.  If you like beans, then you'll probably think these are decent.  Would I make it for myself?  No.  Oh, and no problem with it holding together (as some peeps have said).  I squeezed the liquid out of the pepper/onion mixture as suggested and I didn't measure the breadcrumbs, just kept adding until the mixture seemed stiff enough.

I made some adjustments based off other reviews and my kids preference. First I doubled the recipe. Used red pepper instead of green and vidalian onion. I used about two shakes of cayenne pepper and 2 tsp sweet chili sauce. I also added about 3/4 can creamed corn. I pulsed the pepper and onions first and then added the black beans, garlic (used heaping spoons) and spices. I then pulses that a few times and put the mixture in a big bowl where I added 1 1/4c Panko crumbs and about another 1/4c Italian (as I ran out of Panko and it still needed more) and then one egg. Mixed with my hands and then used Saran Wrap and a burger press to make the burger patties. I got 7 large burger patties that I then froze in their Saran Wrap.

They were very delicious  but they didn't hold together as well as I would have liked but it was still edible as a burger on a nice toasty bun.  I wish I had read one of the most helpful reviews at the bottom of the page like I usually do.  Other than that, my family loved them and so did I.  I will definitely add this to my list of quick dishes.  Yummy!

I made these exactly to the recipe and the texture was great. I wore vinyl gloves to shape the patties (as I do for meat) and they were perfect. I got 6 patties of a nice size. So happy to have this recipe, considering the cost of store bought with probably all of the added preservatives. This is a keeper. Incidentally, if you make them exactly according to the recipe and you get 6 burgers, the calories are about 124 per burger not counting the pepper and onion. I just counted the black beans, the egg and the bread crumbs.

I made this today.  Like others have suggested, I doubled up on the bread crumbs and they held their shape much better.  Very tasty.  Will make again!

Good recipe. Easy to put together. I cooked dry beans in a slow cooker and then weighed out 16 ounces of cooked beans for this recipe.  I highly recommend purchasing a kitchen scale--especially for weighing flour.

I pretty much followed this recipe exactly, except per comments, I only put 1 teaspoon each of cumin and chili powder.

I put the processed garlic, bell pepper, and onion onto a paper towel in a strainer, and then I picked up the paper towel and squeezed all the moisture out of the vegetables.

I used a potato masher to mash the beans.

I used the same amount of egg and breadcrumbs as the recipe indicates and the mixture came together just fine. I was able to form perfect burgers.

I baked the burgers, and they were yummy. We will be making these again. Plus it is only 1/2 the cost of buying store bought veggie burgers.

I doubled the recipe and added smoked paprika, as well as vegetarian worstechire sauce. I also simply added the rinsed and dried beans into the food processor to pulse a few times after the peppers and onions so I could avoid the fork-mashing step. I fried this on the stovetop and they turned out well. A little fall-apart, but so are most homemade veggie burgers.

I followed the suggestions of draining and drying the black beans. I also got a headstart in mashing them with my Vitamix first, and finished it off with a fork. 

I dislike raw onion so whenever I make meatloaf or burgers I sweat my onions/garlic to get some of the water out. With these I knew I HAD to because everyone complained about them being crumbly because they probably had too much moisture (from the onions). I didn't have green bell pepper so I just omitted it, I used ancho chilli powder, 1/2 tsp of cumin (not a huge fan of cumin), and 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper. I used the recommended amount of breadcrumbs (panko) because panko does tend to absorb a lot of water.

I made them in the oven 10 minutes on one side, and about 13 minutes on the other so they would dry out a little more. I flipped them with no problems. I had mine in a salad (all 4 of them, I hadn't had breakfast!) and they held together really well, even through quartering them. I smeared some laughing cow cheese wedges (x2) and some guac on top of them before I quartered them.

I will be making these again for when I don't feel like putting too much effort into lunch/dinner.

First time I've made any kind of veggie burgers and these were soooo good! I also added some cooked bulgar that I had in the fridge and some chopped mushrooms.  I did freeze the patties before grilling them as some others had recommended. Served these with aioli sauce that I made from this website. Will definitely be making these again soon!

I've made these two times, the first time full of improvisations (hand chopped veggies, and smashed pretzels instead of bread crumbs), and the second time followed to recipe to the T. PLEASE READ:: the pretzels were an incredible touch!!!! I missed the saltiness the second time around, and encourage everybody to get resourceful--instead of bread crumbs, try pretzels, crackers, tortilla chips, etc. This is an amazing recipe!!!

I love these burgers.  I  buy bluk raw beans and soak them the night before and cook them on the stove between an hour to three hours depending on the age of the beans.  

I make patties with them, "meat" balls size that I cook in the oven for my spaghetti sauce.  I put them crumble on salad.   I am kinda going nuts with these.  You see, I just love them.  lol

This makes a wonderful, healthy alternative to store bough veggie burgers.  I have made them twice and each time have rinsed and dried the beans on paper towels to remove the excess moisture.  It makes four nice size patties.  You can play around with the spices.  I placed all the ingredients in the food processor instead of mashing the beans separately.  Yummy!

My husband lovd these Burgers. I was looking for an easy vegetarian recipe and I found one. The secret to keep them from falling apart is to make sure you strain the onion/bell pepper mixture. It took about 15 minutes on each side but overall a success!!

Super yummy! Delicious and great texture. Only thing I changed was I used a little less onion (I doubled the recipe and an entire onion was too much) and slapped some pepper jack cheese on them! they were delicious!

I really love these veggie burgers but made a few modifications to the recipe.  While preparing I throughly strained (after rinsing) the black beans and also the onion, green pepper and garlic which created a fair amount of liquid in the food processor.  I added some extra bread crumbs, pinch of salt, and cracked pepper as well.
Instead of 4 large burgers I made the burgers a bit smaller  and cooked them in a little olive oil on the stove. The first time I made these according to the recipe they took forever baking  and still could have cooked more.  I have not tried them on the grill.
This is my go to recipe!

Great foundation recipe, Like others I made tweaks, Doubled the recipe cut the cumin (used the T for the double batch), added 2t of Worcestershire sauce and about 3/4 to 1 Cup of baby carrots added to the processor. Took the food processor mixture and cooked it for about 5 min to soften the veggies and drained some of the water that was released. It should also be noted that I REALLY processed the onion and green pepper, a few extra bread crumbs and TA DAAAA!! My 15 yr old Black Bean Burger Connoisseur was extremely pleased.

I followed the instructions of the "most helpful positive review" and they turned out great! It's easy to replace the veggies you put in the burgers with various ones you have in the fridge. Jalapenos are good if you want some extra kick, and I put in less cumin because I felt the tablespoon was a bit much.

I used two cans of black beans,  1 onion, 1 yellow bell pepper.  Mashed beans w/ hands leaving some whole,  pureed bell pepper and chopped onion, all other ingredients as listed.  It was great consistency for forming patties.  The patties did fall apart a bit after baked so would suggest 2 eggs.  I didn't care for the spice combination but my family liked it.

Amazing! Instead of using a food processor, I minced the veggies by hand to give the burgers a nice texture. I ended up cooking them longer and at a higher temp. I added some extra breadcrumbs as well. The only thing I would do differently is add more spice and veggies.

I made these for my vegetarian daughter in law and ended up enjoying them as much as her. After reading reviews I decided to add some rice and mushrooms to the mix and cutting a bit of the cumin. At home we all enjoy mexican flavors and spices and the black beans lend them selves beautifully to these dishes so I intend on making the burgers again with more cumin and possibly some fresh cilantro.

Brilliant burgers. I highly suggest topping with feta, tzatziki sauce, and some onion.

With any black bean burger, you'll want to remove as much  moisture from the beans and veggies as possible for the patties to hold together. Extra bread crumbs help.

I doubled the recipe and froze the extras. 15 minutes per side in a 375 degree oven on a greased pan will cook them perfectly from frozen.

I followed other reviews and cut down the cumin.  I added 1 tsp. cumin, which I would think is what was meant to be, instead of 1 tbs, and the cumin was still very noticeable.  I didn't read the reviews until after I had added the onion, garlic, and bell pepper.  Next time I will definitely try draining out their juice.  I did add a half zucchini and half carrot grated and also added more bread crumbs to try and mitigate the juice.  I like the flavor of these but they did turn out too mushy for my families liking.   I think draining the juice will make these perfect next time.  This recipe definitely has potential.

Excellant burger! I liked it better with chipotle mayo rather than mustard & ketchup. I will be making these all summer!

I made it exactly as posted. This got great reviews from my vegetarian family. It was moist and delicious. I can't image buying vegetarian burgers again.

Loved these veggie burgers in a bun with the trimmings, by themselves hard to eat. I made the recipe, as is.I may very the  veggies a little next time. I will never purchase veggie burgers again.. So easy and cheap to make  and good to freeze too.

Made these last night. Amazing! Better than I hoped for. I did follow some suggestions. I let the beans dry after rinsing and removed as much liquid as possible from the onion, garlic pepper mixture. I had no problems. They held together perfectly and had a great texture, easy for forming into patties.I'm dreaming of large batches in my freezer. Great recipe!

Excellent! I used onion powder, garlic powder and red pepper flakes to ensure it all held...and it did! 
Next time, I may try to make them with a little more fat, like mayo or shredded cheese mixed in. Highly recommend this recipe.

I like my veggie burgers to have a consistency at least somewhat close to meat burgers, so I made six patties instead of four and baked them for 30 minutes instead of 20 (20 minutes on the first side, flip, ten minutes on the second).  The flavor was pretty good, though nothing special. A good all-around veggie burger.

Like someone else said, dry off the beans and the veggies and add a little more of the bread crumbs, but overall it turned out good :) I think corn would taste good in it and some salt...

I used the suggestions to make it less watery (like rinsing beans and squeezing water out of pepper mixture through a fine mesh strainer).Then I doubled the  recipe to freeze more for later. I also used 1.5 cups of oatmeal that I processed in a food processer in place of the breadcrumbs (3/4 c if not doubling recipe). I processed the oatmeal before I processed the pepper mix since it was dry and I did not want to get the oatmeal wet and clumpy with the moisture.  I added the ingredients together as noted and formed patties and grilled them. They held together perfectly. When they finished cooking, I let them sit until cool enough to handle and cut them in strips. We made burrito wraps with soft whole wheat tortillas and all our favorite fixings (sour cream, guac., salsa, cheese, lettuce, etc). It will definitely be a regular part my menu! The only thing I would change is adding salt which it needed badly. Oh and I sneaked pepper in which my kids HATE by using a red pepper (green was a dead giveaway). They thought it was tomatoes and loved every bite and asked for seconds!??

Tastes amazing. I left out the cumin because I didn't have any, as well as the hot sauce because I forgot to add it in. It was still really good. Very filling. It was a little hard to hold together, so I'd recommend using two spatulas to flip it. I cooked it on a griddle, and I don't think it'd work on the bbq, but still, amazing recipe overall.

i really was truly impressed with these burgers. It was my first time substituting black bean for meat in my hope of becoming vegetarian.  Had I known I could've had such a fine burger years ago, I would've turned my back on meat years ago.  Flavorful, held together like a burger, including consistency. Hey, with all recipes you're gonna have to tweak it to make it right for you.  Thank you.  Oh yeah, one thing i did that folks may find useful - I used y garlic press on the onion as well, got rid of all excess onion fluid and it made it into a pleasant paste easy to mash and mix with the other ingrediants.

I made this as written, and I wish I had checked the reviews! This had way too much cumin for my taste. They definitely did fall apart, but I feel like most black bean burgers do that. These would be good with modification, but as written I give them a 3/5.

I was disappointed with these when they were finished. No salt, too much cumin. They didn't hold together enough to flip.  Only the edges got anywhere close to solid even with increasing the cook time. I will give it another shot with the suggestions from others.

OMG, this recipe was amazing ! This has to be the best veggie burger I have ever eaten . Very easy to make and they didn't fall apart because I made sure I drained the beans and the veggie mixture and I used just a little bit more bread crumbs. I wanted to make it for my lunch tomorrow at work and I am very impressed by this recipe!

These are terrific. I added a dice of carrot and mushrooms to the onion, red and yellow mini-peppers and garlic, and sautéed them first, then pressed the heck out of the cooked mixture through a sieve after pulse-processing. I wiped out the hot skillet I had used for the sauté and shook the rinsed and towel-dried beans around in the cooling pan for a few minutes, then mashed the beans in that skillet with a metal potato masher. With all this, I only needed 1/2 a cup of the breadcrumbs. I reduced the cumin as everyone seems to suggest, and thought the seasoning was perfect.

These are delicious! I followed Kelly's instructions and rinsed the beans and let them dry a bit, also added some leftover black beans, so probably ended up with a cup and a half. Squeezed the water out of the chopped veggies, added one egg and the breadcrumbs and seasonings. Will probably add corn next time and maybe try with oats instead of breadcrumbs? Maybe, they are really good as is, not spicy

These are fabulous! Instead of using a food processor for the veggies, I hand chopped them because I wanted to add some crunch to the burgers. I did everything else the same. 5 stars!

My friend talked me into making these in place of the frozen kind one night and I'll never go back! I made sure to use paper towels to dry the veggies before combining them so that the patties stick together easier. I highly recommend szechuan hot & spicy marinade/stir fry as the Thai sauce. It really added flavor.

These were awesome; I didn't have any trouble with them holding together. I baked them and used an extra 1/4 c of flour beyond what the recipe calls for. Cook time was double what the recipe called for. This recipe makes 4 large burgers and I had to cook for about 20 - 25 minutes on each side to ensure they were cooked through and formed. No complaints though, everyone enjoyed!

These are really delicous. Moist, great taste and healthy. I added more breadcrumbs- 2/3-3/4 until the texture seemed better, and I dried the beans. Used a food processor for the entire recipe then put into a bowl to stir and make patties.  No cumin on hand, added red pepper flakes. I will never buy frozen again. I put 2 on the George Foreman grill (perhaps that's why they were not mushy), lightly oiled the grill plates. Took about 6-8 minutes. Froze the other 4.

Whole family loved it. Made it exactly as written and worked out fine. I did chill it in the fridge for about an hour so breadcrumbs could absorb any excess liquid fromgreen  pepper and onion.

This is my kids go to recipe. Made as is- it's a great burger. We substituted 3/4 cup sweet potato in place of the diced pepper and  a handful of corn. Coated each with EVOO and pan fried. Will make again.

Great recipe! Make sure you dry the beans before mashing to avoid extra moisture. I left out the onion and garlic, replacing with the powdered version of each. I also chopped up some carrots to put in the mixture. I don't have a food processor so mine had little dices of peppers and carrots, but I like the added texture. Will be making these again!

This has a nice flavor, however,  I didn't care for the texture - it was completely mushy so when I bit into it, it would squeeze out of my bun. This was my first time making a homemade bean burger so it may have been me.

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!! I can not rave enough about this recipe! I've been a vegetarian for about 7 years now and this is the "burger" I've been looking for. The flavor was on point, and the texture was perfect!! While I did find it slightly crumbly this really wasn't an issue for me.  In addition to being a fantastic recipe, I found that they froze really well which is a major plus for a full time student/full time worker! I can't believe I was spending $4 for four frozen processed veggie burgers. When I could make these for a little over $1.35! 
Again I say THANK YOU!!

Loved these!! And we are meat eaters. Like other reviewers I squeezed out the extra moisture from the ingredients. They held up well during pan frying. The mixture would be great to use in so many ways other than burgers. Maybe for stuffed green peppers? So tasty!!

I used 1 can black beans, 1 small yellow bell pepper, 1/4 a white onion, 2 Tablespoons minced garlic, 1 egg, a pinch of chili powder, a pinch of cumin, 4 tablespoons BBQ sauce, 1 Tablespoon yellow mustard, 1 tablespoon ketchup, and pinch of salt. I blended those all together and then folded in a cup of crushed crackers. Next, I baked them for ten minutes on both sides. They were amazing! My husband gave me a high five.

Made this for dinner today.  Took other reviewer recommendations on the use of 2 eggs instead of 1.  Used quick rolled oats to sub for the bread crumbs and added 1/2 cup TVP (textured vegan protein)  Final results turned out well, wasn't wet at all.  Didn't use the oven or grill for this first time trial.  I have access to a hot air convection cooker, gave the exterior of the veggie burger nice a crunch.  I skipped the bell pepper since it triggers my gout.  Will likely sub water chestnuts in for the bell pepper next time for some extra crunch :)  Will def make again.

My first time making veggie burgers and it was a success - the patty formed nicely and didn't break. However, I found them a little too dry (baked in the oven) and lacking flavor (definitely add salt!). Also, my boyfriend was wondering why he had to use fork instead of potato masher to mash the beans..

It tastes very good, but my "burger" fell apart in the pan so I rolled it up in a warm tortilla, which was good, too. If you want a patty to put on a bun,  chill the mixture for a while before frying.

If you're hesitant about veggie burgers, I really suggest you give black bean ones a try. Probably one of the tastiest and still so healthy recipes I've made ever.

This recipe is a good base,  but definitely one of those recipes where you should adjust according to your tastes. I really don't like bell peppers, so I left them out. 

However, I did add finely diced carrots, celery, and mushrooms. Not much of a hot sauce fan, but I usually add heat using either crushed red pepper or cayenne pepper. Now that I'm writing this, I've realized I actually forgot to add the chili powder, but the burgers were still great.

1/2 cup of bread crumbs is probably all right, but I usually add a little more. I cut down the spices to about 1 tsp or 1.5 tsp each for chili powder/cumin.

Instead of grilling or baking, I pan fry these patties on the stove top with some oil, about 3-4 minutes per side on medium high heat.

Created the burgers on Sunday and froze them to eat later in the week. I made them tonight for dinner and they were sooooo delicious.  No more frozen store bought burgers for us. Ever!! Nothing more to say. They were just that good!

I made a triple batch, reduced the cumin by about 1/4 per other reviews, and I kept the ingredients dry- for instance after putting the peppers and onions through the food processor, I let them drain through the strainer.  I did aluminum foil, brushed with vegetable oil, on the grill.  They held together fine.  I used Italian breadcrumbs, because that's what I had and it was fine.  There is some heat at the end.  I don't eat much spicy, but it is good.

Tried it a few times with various spices, bread amounts and 1 or 2 eggs depending on moisture levels, each time was quite good! Really good for customizing to different flavor type as well if you have guests. Though I added diced mushrooms to mine just because i like mushrooms.

These were very good. I added extra beans as recommended and I added some crushed red pepper to the onion mixture. I also added Worcestershire sauce as several reviewers suggested. I had no issues with wetness, in fact I ended up adding a second egg. We will have these again.

This burger turned out great for my first time making it. I read the comments and followed the advice about drying the beans off before mashing them and adding 1/4 cup extra bread crumbs to avoid the burger falling apart.  The next time I make this I will use the full tablespoon of cumin and chili powder; I was afraid it would be too spicy but I think it will be good.

Definitely tone down the spiciness when serving to children. On a side note, if you break the patties up again, and put them in a burrito, they are dynamite!

Definitely not as good as a burger with meat, but I thought it was good recipe. Next time I think I'll just serve the patties in a different way (not in a bun) otherwise I just expect the meat taste.

Just made this recipe...Love them!!!  My changes were, I cooked dryed black beans in a Steak seasoning then followed recipe adding Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce as hot sauce.  Once patties were made, I cooked them in one table spoon of Harissa Olive Oil (we like Spicy)  it gave a little bit of a crispy spicy texture which was Delicious.  I can't wait toake them again!!!

Great basic, vegetarian patty recipe!
Moist and savory with the following changes:
Oatmeal instead of bread crumbs
1/2 cup of shredded carrots instead of bell pepper
Chicken broth instead of water for quinoa
Baked at 400 degrees for 30 minutes 

Next Time i will use less garlic (mine was strangely strong) and grease my baking pan (serious sticking went on!) I will also try adding some nutritional yeast...

I agree with other reviews that this is a good base recipe where you can play with the spices and vegetables that go in!!

These were much better than many veggie burgers I have had. I used garbanzo beans instead of black beans and it worked just as well. I also added a little more hot sauce an cumin as a replacement for chili powder. I also used blended, whole wheat bread for bread crumbs and it worked just as well (you will need a little more than 1/2 a cup though). It was a little wet and took about 30 minutes to bake in a oven but I think that was because i used garbanzo beans instead of black beans. But other than that, very flavorful!

The recipe as is, seems too wet. This is only my 2nd time making BB burgers, but based on my 1st attempt - consistency is key! I combined different reviewers' advice to get the mixture bulkier & drier.  Used closer to 3/4 c. bread crumbs, about 1/4 c. cooked quinoa (it was in my fridge), some extra zucchini & squash shreds (maybe a 1/4 c.). All of these additions got the mixture to a better bulkiness. It formed nice patties that did well in the oven. Haven't eaten any yet though!  Fingers crossed.

Oh my goodness! Here's my secret to how I made this absolutely amazing! I added another egg and more crumbs as some suggested below BUT the real kicker was 1 chipotle pepper added in the food processor mix. SO GOOD!

They were okay. Very easy to make, and they taste okay, but they didn't have an appealing texture. Too soft!

I made this. The overall flavour is nice, but you have to like cumin, and not everyone does.  

This recipe was obviously not tested, because if it had been, the amount of breadcrumbs would have been increased, as well as the addition of some salt.

I doubled the recipe so that I could freeze some burgers for future use, and added 1 cup of breadcrumbs.  It was way too wet to make patties.  I ended up adding about 2 more cups of breadcrumbs to a double batch; for a total of about 3 cups.  I just let the food processor run and kept pouring in breadcrumbs until it had the right consistency to form patties.

They are very bland because there is no salt in the recipe. Luckily I only cooked up 2 patties before realizing that it was screaming out for salt.

I would make it again, with the adjustments I made.  But the recipe as is, is terribly written, and obviously not tested.

My family loves this.  

There are a lot of suggestions on how to make this work, so here's mine, which is super simple.

I did dry out the beans a bit but forgot to do so with the vegetables.

Otherwise, I just dumped everything in the bowl, as directed, except that I used gluten-free oatmeal in lieu of bread crumbs.

Then I whacked at it with my 'zing-zinger' - my immersion blender.  As another reviewer suggested I then let it sit - I put it in the fridge for a few hours.

I greased my hands just a bit, they made into patties beautifully, baked them as directed - fantastic.  Easy as could be and I only used one bowl and a baking sheet.  No need to any other gymnastics in my kitchen.

Enjoy!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This recipe is lovely. I doubled the recipe. Rinsed my seasoned canned beans & pulsed them in a food processor. I don't like to taste partial beans in my bean parties. I didn't have to dry them. I added everything as listed but left out the hot sauce...for my kids :) They held great. I baked them during the day. Put them in the fridge & juts heated them in the oven quickly. They are easy to make, easy to bake, easy to re-heat & easy to eat :)

My vegetarian daughter loves these. I changed things up a bit by using (ground) oatmeal instead of breadcrumbs, and by adding more shredded veggies (zucchini or anything else I might have in the fridge).  I also added a little more spices and some Worcestershire sauce. I used the posted tip to freeze and then cook - they definitely hold up much better that way. When grilling, definitely put on a piece of (lightly oiled) tin foil. We did make them once in a pan and they turned out great that way - easier to get a sear on them. Last time I made the recipe, I doubled it and froze a bunch for future use. My daughter (the vegetarian) requests these often, and likes them better than any store-bought veggie burger. BUT you must like the flavor of beans to enjoy these. Sounds obvious but the bean flavor is not masked.

I made this exactly to the recipe. Oh wait, used a Red Bell, I had no green.  It was very good, our first veggie burger.  Thank you for an easy tasty introduction.  I baked it and it held together perfectly, I did pat dry the beans after rinsing.  Thank you very much for being my first!

Mine came out really runny even after adding about 2 cups of bread crumbs. They stuck to the greased pan and still mushy. I just now turned up the heat in hopes of drying them out a bit. Feels like a fail for this recipe, might try again after reading more reviews.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe.  Instead of bread crumbs I used panko crumbs and 1 C of rice to add a little bit more consistency.  Since we were at work, I used a counter top griddle and they turned out great. It was delicious, my coworkers loved them!

Loved it!  Made a double batch with only one egg and 1/2 c. whole wheat bread crumbs.....instead added diced portabello mushroom which help to "dry it out" and cooked the mushroom, peppers and onions together to reduce the liquid......wonderful recipe and loved the spices......even added alittle extra thai chilli on top. Also rinsed and dried beans as another reviewer suggested.

The Burgers were great. We did not add any chilli powder ,but still used that Thai Chili SaUce to give it that nice flavour . Also Mixed In two-big spoons of Hummus Which gave It a nice flavour:) AND paired with a batch of FRESH BAKED sweet-potatoe fries .. you're talking about Pefection? :D This is what it looks like.

Made these last night with a few modifications based on other reviews.  I used 2 eggs, increased breadcrumbs to 1 1/2 Cups,  and only used 1 Tsp of cumin. The consistency was fantastic. As easy to work with as real ground beef.  Made 6 patties. Cooked as directed and they held together beautifully. Will definitely make again.

My boys declared, "This is the best meal ever!" I would say that's success for a 10 and  8 year old.

Some alterations I made to the recipe: 1) I added 1/2 tsp of salt. 2) Sautee minced onions (the food processor beats onions into a pulp... I won't use it) and celery in olive oil, then add minced garlic in the last 30 seconds of the sautee. 3) Exclude peppers. 4) I did use the food processor to make bread crumbs from two slices of sandwich bread. 5) I excluded the thai chili. Overkill. 6) After baking the patties, I sauteed them in olive oil to get a nice crust, then topped them with cheese. Yum!

I absolutely loved this black bean burger! I thought the flavors came together wonderfully. We had some last night for dinner and the left overs for lunch today and they are even yummier! I omitted the cumin and Chili sauce for fear of my picky 5 year old not liking it, but everything else I did the same. I took advice from other reviewers and made sure to strain everything and squeezed between paper towels. Seemed like a lot of work because I was pressed for time but it was all worth it in the end. I made 5 burgers instead of 4 because my buns were a bit on the small size. I will probably be making these weekly as they are an easy lunch to prep the next day. My son was so happy he didn't have to eat meat (not a huge fan of beef) and enjoyed his black bean burger even though he always fusses about eating beans! I love beans, and do not eat meat so this recipe gets a 4.5 rating from me! The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because my meat loving husband said they were only okay. I have been trying to find substitutions so he can cut back on his meat but unfortunately this recipe will not work for him. Perhaps because it is not as hearty as a beef burger? Regardless I will continue making this for my son and myself. Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

These are so wonderful, I don't even want to eat homemade burgers! Like most of the other reviewers suggested, I also doubled the amount of bread crumbs. With doing so, I've never had a problem with them falling apart. 
I tried making them strictly by hand and utilizing a food processor. You will save an incredible amount of time and frustration using a food processor. 
Give them a try! I promise you won't be disappointed!

The best ever. Mine did not fall apart,I just drained the beans...Processed 1/2 poblano pepper, 1/2 red onion, garlic and a small zucchini in food processor and added to the beans. Followed the recipe otherwise and it was perfect on english muffin with tomato and lettuce and tahini,yogurt, hot sauce topping.

The flavour is amazing, even my carnivore husband loved them.  Will definitely make them again. This recipe makes a very moist mixture that is best baked in the oven (can't imagine trying to cook these on a grill).  Next time, I will let the mixture sit overnight in the fridge to firm up. Like the other reviewers have said, this recipe is a base for many other variations.  Double the batch so you can freeze some.

Enjoyed thoroughly by the whole family (no buns or topping necessary!) The burgers have a great texture and mean kick. I fried them gently in olive oil just so they'd be done faster.

I love these burgers!  They are so filling!  I added some chopped jalapeños to the mix, and it was a little spicy for my 8 year old so I won't do that again.  Hubby is not much of a faux burger fan, but he gave them a 3 out of 5.   Enjoy!

this was my first attempt at a veggie burger and these came together, and stayed together perfectly.  I doubled the recipe to freeze some for later and from other recommendations, did chill for an hour before shaping and used parchment when baking.  I changed some of the flavors since I prefer herbs to spices and ground oats with the immersion blender for flour.  it's a lovely base recipe, will definitely use again.  Nice to see a big bowl of beans and veg for a burger instead of the store bought variety.

Wow! I really liked this burger! I added a full cup of bread crumbs and stuck them in the freezer for about 2 hours. Grilled them on aluminum foil, they stuck together perfectly. Great recipe!

I'm a huge meet lover, but I thought I'd try something a little different with some dry beans I had laying around for a while. The burger was great! It was a little bland and it did fall apart, but I was prepared for that because of the other comments. I just added some seasoning to it when I was making my sandwich. Things that are easily fixed the next time I make these. I will definitely be making more of these burgers!

I followed the recipe exactly but took the advice of others and squeezed the liquid out of the green peppers and onions after I chopped them in a food processor. I didn't have any problems with the burger falling apart. I baked mine in the oven. I personally didn't care for this recipe, possibly because of the texture and I felt it had too much cumin flavor. Hubby loved them though.

It was just okay for me. The onion and green pepper flavors were very overwhelming. If I make it again, then I would use 1/4 measurement instead of onion and green pepper. I would also dial back the cumin some.

I made the recipe mostly as is, except did not add the bell pepper, as I didn't have any. It was delicious! I made it for some neighbors, and  they all had rave reviews . We topped with the burgers with A1 steak sauce, lettuce and tomato.

I made it as written and baked it.I didn't want to risk using the Foreman. The burger stayed together and was moist and delicious. I used a Light Multigrain Thomas's English Muffin instead of a roll to cut calories and garnished with fat free cheese,lettuce,tomato,avocado and a little taco sauce. Three more in the fridge for lunch or dinner during the week.

Our green bell pepper went bad so I used a little extra onion and some corn. Also used 50% more breadcrumbs (panko) as others suggested. Scrumptious!

Great recipe for a quick, delicious, vegetarian burger option. I'm gluten free so I substituted the bread crumbs with gluten free glutino bread crumbs. I had to add a little more than 1/2 cup just to get everything to stick and stay together. I also made 6 patties instead of 4 because I made them a little smaller than normal burgers. Instead of using a burger bun, I topped the burger with goat cheese, jalapeño stuffed green olives and wrapped it up in lettuce. So delicious, can't wait to make more!

I also tried these today with kidney beans because I was out of black beans and I might actually like them a little bit better. Of course I love kidney so that's not a stretch. Thanks for recipe.

I found the reviews very helpful (straining to remove excess moisture, use 2 eggs instead of one, substituted half of bread crumbs for crackers).  My one remaining question was the size of the patties.  Recipe stated 4 servings but they were huge!  Recommend smaller patties to fit on buns and firm up the insides a bit more.  Crisping them up in a frying pan (after baking in the oven) with a little oil adds to the texture.  Also added some carrots and peas to increase veggies. Just processed them with the other ingredients. Nice flavor.

Great recipe had a lot of fun making it.I did not put in cumin, squeezed the vegies real good. I used wheat crackers and bread crumbs added a little adobo. Took them to a bbq and my niece said WOW. Her 15 month old daughter loved them too! They had great texture and flavor too!

Must try it with Garlic Aioli recipe found on this site! Yummy!!  Like suggestions given, I use more bread crumbs (maybe 3/4 cup) & add more salt.  I use Pampered Chef's Mix n Chop to mash beans-saves soo much time! Also, use cheesecloth (or reusable, mesh turkey stuffing bag, found at Wal Mart in kitchenware for under $1) to strain all juice from veggies in seconds. In fact, dries out & holds together so well, that I'm able to add a small spread of butter to each burger for added flavor after flipping on George Foreman grill.  Oh, and out of habit, I always stick in freezer for a bit before grilling or even many days ahead.  They never fall apart on me.  I serve with pepper jack cheese and fresh-cut veggies...and don't forget the secret weapon-Garlic Aioli!! Served mine on grilled focaccia bread...delish!!

Just made these, and they're amazing!! I only used 1/4 of a bell pepper and onion, I also fried it on the stove using olive oil, and it was still very good. I'm the only vegetarian in my house, so I froze the other four, so I can grill/cook them later!! Can't wait :)

I loved this recipe. I noticed the same problem as many others; they tend to fall apart or crumble. This can be fixed easily by adding more breadcrumbs or some rolled oats. Also the garlic was a bit strong, but this was an otherwise amazing recipe.

I did not have the cumin and I used hot sauce. Also I added season all and pepper. I read other reviews that said add more egg so I used one egg plus one egg yolk. I baked them a little longer than 10 minutes on each side and they came out great for my second vegetarian meal.

I made these as specified except for adding a little rice.  My kids love beans, but they did not care for this.  My husband and I thought it was just okay.  Nobody really wanted the left-overs, though I ended up adding them as salad toppings and that was okay.  Wouldn't make again.

Burgers didn't stay together well, needed salt added and maybe more bread crumbs?   We are going to try them again with some tweaking.

My 3 star rating is from the original recipe, 5 stars with adjustments suggested by others and a few done by myself. You have to strain the pepper mixture(added serrano pepper for more heat, I looove spicy food), add 1 cup of breadcrumbs and 2 eggs to the patties. I added the spices mentioned along with salt,pepper,serendipity,dried oregano, and cayenne. I was going for a which wich type sandwich but instead made it into a salad bowl. Like the previous poster I would freeze then grill, baking didn't workout too well for me but the patty will still awesome, and I froze the remainder. In the salad bowl, I toasted some sourdough bread and chopped it up, spinach, diced tomato, sautéed mushrooms w/ salt&pepper,avocado,parmesan blend cheese,& sliced black olives... I would recommend it more in a sandwich form w/ toasted french bread.

We substituted red peppers for green, used ' Kicking Hot Sauce' and added corn and a little more bread crumbs.  Topped them off with jalapeno cheese. Delicious! :)
PS if you add corn and/or hot sauce be sure to add more bread crumbs.  We added more but ran out, the burgers were a little 'soft' but still very tasty!

I made my own recipe but instead of eggs I use 1/2 C organic peanut butter and instead of bread crumbs I used 1/2 C old fashioned oatmeal. Then chill in refrigerator an hour for easier handling. To cook I use about 1 -2 teas. sesame oil and brown 5 min on each side.

These are soooo good, no changes needed (I do blot the processed veggies with a paper towel to soak up as much liquid as possible and add whatever amount of bread crumbs to get a good consistency). A hit with the whole family -- YUMMY! Make sure to double the recipe and freeze half of the patties for a quick dinner later.

Very good recipe and it's delicious!  I used the same recipe with some minor changes.  Used egg whites and 1 cup bread crumps.  Bravo!

I made this recipe exactly as it was written and had no problems whatsoever! I let the beans sit after rinsing do they dried a bit and after chopping the veggies in my vitamix I used an old nut bag to squeeze out all the water. I may have added a little more bread crumbs like someone suggested but didn't anything or take anything away. Me and my daughter were amazed at how well they turned out. Just beautiful and delicious. I got 4 out of the mix and ate 2. I also used the tasty buns recipe to go with them....omg!!! I will never buy a boxed veggie burger or hamburger bun again!

These were delicious! The only thing we had to added extra was crackers to make them hold. Other than that, perfect! I froze some 6 of these and take them out whenever we grill.

Oh my gosh, you won't even be thinking about beef while eating these! There is a lot of flavor and so easy to customize! I rinsed and dried the beans, but didn't dry the onion mixture, but things still held together fine. Highly recommend to anyone!

Delish!  I added one more clove of garlic and left out the chili sauce.  Also added some cajun spice.  Will add corn next time. I only used one egg, and the burgers turned out perfect.  I mashed my beans A LOT, so that may have helped.  Also, cooked on the stove stop in a non-stick pan.  About 8 minutes on each side.  This is definitely going in the rotation!

Do you juice?  I found this recipe to be a great way to use my bulk after making my green juice.  I usually toss it in my garden but thought I'd try it in this burger.  Worked beautifully since it is so dry and gave me the peace of mind that I wasn't loosing all of that fiber.  Just an idea.

These were ok. For me the breadcrumbs were too major of a component and added a mush and breadiness that I could do without and made it more of a breadburger than a beanburger. Switching out the crumbs for brown rice might do the trick. The garlic flavor was nice and strong. I had no problem with them falling apart.

They work better if they are frozen.  Wrap them in tinfoil and then let them cool for a bit before unwrapping them.

Amazing thanks so much!
I doubled up the ingredients apart from the garlic and used smoked paprika, Harissa paste & cumin for spices.
The mixture (done in the kenwood chef) was really wet (2eggs) so I ended up using 6 slices of bread for breadcrumbs. 
The mixture was still quite wet so I fried them in coconut oil. Omg, I didn't ever expect such success. 
Will try next time with some roasted red pepper bits in them or maybe some kind of cheese.
Thank you, I'd never made bean burgers before so your recipe is perfect x

These are great!  Would have gotten five stars but I had a little trouble getting them to hold together.  I made them exactly as recipe stated.  I was missing a good black bean burger since moving away from South Carolina.  These really hit the spot.  I will be making again before I decide to make any alterations to the recipe.

I loved this recipe.  I put the veggie's in the food processor and then drained them well through a mesh strainer.  I also drained the beans really well.  Other than that I did as the recipe said, and they were wonderful.  I have made them several times and they are always a hit

This recipe does need alterations to create a good burger.  I patted the beans dry, as well as not putting the veggies in a food processor (mincing makes a better texture to the burger in my opinion).  Absolutely double the breadcrumbs, or substitue quinoa as well.

This recipe is a great for inspiration, but needs a little coaxing to make them come out great. I used the full amount of bread crumbs (I used panko) because that's what I had in hand. I also added a little oats for an extra binder like some of the reviews said. I only used one egg becuae the extra oats helped hold them together perfectly. When I processed the onions, bellpepper, and garlic I added a few sliced jalapeños for an extra kick. It came out just a tad of the spicy side because I also used tobasco sauce. Next time I make them I will use a different hot sauce, most likely siracha, and add fewer jalapeños. Make sure to dry the beans on a paper towel until all of the moisture is gone, and they are completely dry. When I was finished processing the veg I put them in a fine mesh strainer and shook them until a lot of the liquid was out. Put a paper towel below and you will see how much liquid comes out! It takes a little longer, but is well worth the wait. I also added a pitch of garlic powder, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste! The cumin flavor is a little strong so maybe 3/4 of a tablespoon will work better next time. These are definitely better than store bought frozen veggie burgers, and are very inexpensive! I will make these again and make a bigger batch to freeze for a quick, healthy, and easy meal! Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the directions exactly. They turned out perfect. I will say I dried my beans before mashing. I did add corn to mine instead of onion and green pepper. I will be making these again.

Tasted incredible! I did, however, have to add more breadcrumbs than suggested to get the proper texture. I cooked these on the griddle and they held together wonderfully. I topped with a chipotle mayo (mayo and adobo chili sauce), lettuce, and onion. Best black bean burgers I have ever made!

As a former carnivore gone pescitarian, I've been craving a hamburger but the store brought veggie burgers taste like cardboard so I wasn't expecting much when I made this for dinner tonight. I absolutely LOVED it! I didn't have green pepper so I only used onion and fresh garlic (I don't have a food processor so did a fine chop with my knife) and added a sprinkle of Tony Chachere's. This is going to be my go to veggie burger recipe from now on! Next time I think I'll add grilled onions and some sauteed mushrooms. 

If you are having trouble getting the ingredients to bind, try adding a little oatmeal along with the bread crumbs.

Great recipe! I just changed to 2 eggs, added double the bread crumbs (actually I used crushed all bran cereal) and added corn. Make sure to dry the veggies and black beans before mixing , makes the patties stick better!

I really enjoyed the taste of this recipe.  I really wish breadcrumbs were not used as the binding agent.  I tried using slightly over-cooked quinoa and they did not hold together very well.

5 stars for a delicious no-meat burger and for ease of preparation & cooking.  Made these for a burger-burn w/some vegitarian guests attending.  The non-meateaters enjoyed these & said these were much better than the store bought brands. I (a lover of a good meat burger) wound up eating one of these burgers instead of a meat burger - grilled with green chile and cheese on top :). Delicious.  As suggested by other reviewers, it is necessary to drain the beans very well and not mix the pepper & onion mixture in if its too wet.  You will need to drain some moisture off as needed. You can easily add more moisture if needed - just enough to "feel" the pattie texture will hold together when cooked & flipped over while cooking.

These were such a hit! I'm giving it a 4 just because I did have to do a little tweaking (extra bread crumbs and eggs to hold them together), but I cooked these for a group of friends and got nothing but raving compliments. It was pretty easy to make, and I think I might try to do them even a little spicier the next time - this amount was not too spicy at all!

Awesome burgers, added cilantro, an Italian spice blend, Panko, Thai chille sauce topped with fresh grated parmesan. Horseradish aoli, tomatoes and romaine on a whole grain thin round bun. We upsized the recipe by adding another egg and another can of beans, one can whole bean and one can mashed. What a treat, can't wait for more. Beef is history, save a cow! Next up is fresh mozzarella on top!

I tried the recipe and it tasted great.. I had to add more bread crumbs to help it stay together. I had one problem, my burgers were to dry. I think I cooked them to long because I didn't follow the 10 min on each side like it said but other than that, it was good. First time ever making homemade veggie burgers but it will definitely not be my last. Thank you for a simple recipe.

I didn't think my husband would be interested in a veggie burger, he's definitely carnivorous, but he loved this and got excited that we had leftovers and so we ate these twice in one week.  I did add some carrots, corn and green beans that I put in the food processor just because I wanted to get some extra veggies in there.  Of course the vegetables that I added meant that I had more volume but it still went farther than I thought it would. It made 4 HUGE patties. I seriously think i could have made them half as big.  I baked 2 in the oven and froze the other 2. They stayed together better after being frozen.  Either way they were tasty!

Oh MY! I just ate THE best veggie burger I've ever had in my life, and I made it myself using this recipe. The only change I made was from green to red bell pepper because that's what I had on hand. I used an XL egg and found it to hold together well. Easy to make with your super clear instructions.  Thank You Lauren.  This is why I love this website!

Great base recipe  I changed a few things when I cooked my burgers  i finely chopped all veggies  I then sautéed my veggies which included jalapeño peppers  with seasoning and used minced garlic I then proceed on with my beans which I mashed then season I'm big on flavor with onion powder, chili sauce and black pepper  I used regular bread crumbs a lil more than stated and I froze mine for about an half hour before cooking

Sent to me by a friend...everyone was right! Super easy and so yummy! I adjusted the seasonings to what I had on hand and turned out great. I love the texture and so fresh. Next time I will plan to add more breadcrumbs to keep it from falling apart but otherwise great.  Definitely true that it will be very hard to go back to frozen boxed veggie patties.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used garbanzo beans instead and added in 1/4 cup cooked brown rice, 2 eggs, and drained the processed bell pepper and onions of the excess liquid. I left out the hot sauce. It turned out fabulous! They held together and were very tasty. Thank you for the recipe. I will not be buying the frozen veggie burgers anymore.

These were fun!  I mixed everything in a food processor and let it sit out a little for the bread crumbs to soak up the water.  The burgers fell apart the tiniest bit after baking them, but they were great.  Pretty mushy, but very tasty.  I made some extras to freeze, and look forward to enjoying them in the weeks to come.

This has become our go-to veggie burger recipe and we typically make it at least once a week! I like to add canned mushrooms, drained well and chopped, for a little extra flavor. They will hold together fine as long as you drain everything very thoroughly before mixing, and you can add some extra breadcrumbs if you're still having trouble. Delicious with some cheese melted on top. One of my most-used recipes.

These burgers turned out pretty good. Although, I didn't use the exact measurement for the breadcrumbs (had to eyeball it since it wasn't getting sticky enough) and I think I'll add some different seasoning next time for a more flavorful kick. We added a slice of cheese and topped it off with some barbecue sauce (didn't have ketchup) and it was delicious.

This is probably the best veggie burger recipe I have ever tried.  All the ingredients are staples in my pantry, and this is a much better route than a store bought, frozen burger.  The only changes I made were as follows:

I added: 
--2 Thai chilis instead of the chili powder
--Soy Chorizo from Trader Joes to add a little extra dimension and flavor to the recipe
--I doubled the garlic,because I believe there is no such thing as too much garlic.

This recipe also freezes really well (you don't compromise the texture or flavor) in case you've made more than you can eat.

I made these for my daughter over Labor Day weekend. She thought these were very good and liked them. I followed suggestions made by other cooks. I added more bread crumbs, drained, rinsed and patted dry the beans, as well as drained the veggies and squeezed them dry before adding them to the bean mixture. I thought the spices were just right but maybe the next time I will add S/P too. I grilled them on foil on a charcoal grill and they did hold together nicely. I got about five thin patties. The next time I might make them thicker. I did freeze them first before grilling and that worked out just fine. I would make them again.

I made the recipe as written, and it was my first time making any kind of veggie burger. To be open-minded, you really need to disregard your experiences with out-of-the-box products that have more complex texture, such as a well-shaped patty with a slight crunch on the outside. This recipe wasn't intended for that. The flavor reminded me of my homemade black bean soup, which I make by following the recipe on the back on the Bush's can. Ingredients are similar. I used the grating disc on my food processor to handle the pepper and onion, and used a garlic press for the garlic. I tried to avoid having large chunks of any particular ingredient. This worked well. Also, I continued adding bread crumbs (panko was all I had on hand) until the mixture seemed appropriate for shaping patties. I probably ended up with twice the recommended amount. During cooking, the patties were mushy, but surprisingly they didn't fall apart when I flipped them. I cooked them longer than recommended until the patties were golden on top. They were definitely worth making again, although next time I might try skillet cooking them in a little butter to see if this adds some richness to the flavor. It needs a little something more, but I haven't figured out what yet.

I think these are pretty good I took some saltines and crushed them up to make them thicker.  Placed them on a cookie sheet using a measuring cup and a wooden spoon keeps the hands clean through.  Add some lettuce and tomato and guacamole!

This recipe was really delicious! I did not give it 5 stars because I found it too wet. I needed to adjust the amount of bread crumbs added in order to make it workable. Otherwise, they tasted fantastic! Thank you!

Excellent Recipe! I followed it to a T and it was delicious. Even my toddler ate it! We are trying to cut down on the meat we eat per week, and so this dish was perfect for us. Thank you for the wonderful recipe :)

Only giving this 3 stars because these did not hold up well for me.  I didn't read any of the reviews before making, I wish I had.  Now that I've read some reviews I'll try making these again with the suggestions.  The flavor was pretty good, but then when everything fell apart that was a big disappointment.  That being said my parrots & dogs enjoyed the pieces no complaints from them.  I'll review these again after a second try.

great veggie burger....even my kids ate it!  I used one extra egg for a double recipe, and sauteed the veggies without food processing them.

Yummy! I rinsed and dried the beans before mashing with a potato masher. Drained the veggies, used one egg and the patty held together perfectly. Didn't need to cook on foil. I used only 1 tsp of chili powder and cumin.

Made this tonight and it was a hit. My husband and I really enjoyed them and we are not vegetarians. We followed the recipe as above, but let the beans dry after rinsing them and dabbed the green pepper and onion mixture with paper towels to gather the extra liquid. Even though there is chili powder and hot sauce added it is not a "heated" amount. I also do not have a food processor and used my Pampered Chef chopper and it still blended as it should. I also took the advice from one of the reviews and mashed the beans with a flat object versus a fork. This a recipe that we will definitely be eating again.

I loved this! The only thing I want to figure out how to change is how easily they fell apart.. But other than that the flavor was phenomenal and my hubby repeatedly requests this one!

These are delicious. We made as is, only added 1 additional egg for binding. They basically tasted like a taco burger. I think next time I will skip the "taco seasonings" and add different ones for a more regular burger taste. But even my picky young kids ate them up with a slice of cheese and some pickles!!

I will never buy another Boca burger again! Along with the ingredients, I added 16 oz of sliced portabella to the food processor with the green pepper, onion and garlic.

Tried these this week.  Absolutely delicious. First attempt made them as written.  Pan fried.  Great on the outside but mushy in the middle.  Added a cup of cooked rice to the remainder and this helped, but still not the consistency of meat.  Any suggestions? I've had bean burgers before that were not mushy.

I found 3 cloves of garlic was way too much.  I like spicy food and this was not spicy at all.  I will certainly try it again but will increase the amount of chili and hot sauce.  
I drained and rinsed the beans and let them dry, this helped keep the burgers from falling apart on the grill.

I must have done something wrong. I ended up with 10 HUGE burgers! It might have something to do with the fact that I boiled my own beans. I needed extra salt and pepper at the end. These were very very good. Just as good as regular hamburgers!

I love black beans! I'm definitely making this tonight for dinner! I think I'll add roasted corn and maybe use red bell pepper instead. Some pepperjack cheese on top would also taste great!!

Tasty and easy! A million times better than many store bought veggie burgers. I added salt and pepper and sriracha but otherwise stuck to the recipe as is. They held together ok on my cookie sheet, but I think they might be tricky on a grill.

Yum! Turned out delicious! I didn't have enough bread crumbs, so used some oats instead, and also didn't have green pepper so added extra onion instead.  I think that was a big mistake.  Next time I make these, I will follow the recipe as is, and possibly add some extra egg and maybe shredded cheese for moisture since it seemed a bit dry.  All in all great though, and my kids loved it!

These were very good. They had excellent flavor. I added extra bread and made sure to dry the veggies after they were in the processor so the burgers stayed together perfectly. I ate mine with cheese and a dollop of sour cream on top.

This is a good starting point for a black bean burger.  I use about half the cumin called for, and I add cayenne pepper and a little smoked paprika because I like my burgers spicier.  I also just keep adding bits of bread until my mixture is thick enough to hold together.

For someone not used to veggie burgers, this was pretty good. Next time, however I won't use 1 T of cumin--way too much. I'll stick to 2 t. Also, don't have a food processor, so I just minced the daylights out of a red bell pepper, garlic, and the onion. I baked these for 10 mins on each side at 375 and then topped with a slice of muenster cheese. These really don't have a similar taste to a turkey or ground beef burger, (and they're probably not supposed to); they're pretty good.

I tried this last night and it was great! I made it with yellow peppers instead of green. I paired it with avacado on one side of the bun and goat cheese on the other which made the taste really wonderful together. It was a little bit on the dry side so like others have mentioned I would add a little bit more egg to the mixture, maybe even some honey. Must try.

Everyone I've fed these to loves them!  I chop the pepper, onion and garlic, drain some of the liquid, then add the black beans to the processor.  I follow the rest of the recipe exactly.  Green chilies make a great topping.  Also, this may make some people shake their heads, but I'm not a vegetarian and I love turkey bacon so I usually put two pieces on my burger, yum!  I serve sweet potato fries or chips for the side.

These taste delicious but they fall apart when I cook them 90% of the time. I have tried cooking them fresh and frozen but they always fall apart. 

Some modifications the slightly help include subbing out the bread crumbs for old fashioned oats and adding an egg to hold it together a little bit better.

These burgers are so delicious! I cut out the cumin and added less pepper. I also added onion and garlic powder to the mixture. Ate it with whole wheat buns and laughing cow cheese. I'll definitely be making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it's OK.  A good base from which to create a burger to your own taste.  The cumin dominated the other flavors so I'd cut back on it a bit and up the garlic.  I found it a bit blah.  Our burgers were a little dry but that's likely because I prepared the black beans from dry and they could have cooked a bit more.  Will experiment.

Delicious! Gave it only 4 stats because I had to increase the bread crumbs by about 50%. I also decreased the cumin by a little (about 3/4 tbsp) and added a dash of salt and pepper.

This is a really good black bean burger recipe!  I almost completely followed the recipe as written, with just the tiniest of tweaks.  I added a little more hot sauce because we like everything a little more spicy, and instead of adding more breadcrumbs like a couple of reviewers suggested, I added a half cup or so of cooked bulgar.  The burgers held together really well when I cooked on a skillet w/ a little oil spray, and the bulgar up-ed the protein even more. Since the mixture contained raw egg, I made a tiny "test burger" in the pan before cooking off the whole batch to check the seasoning- definately add salt if you aren't on a sodium restricted diet!

This recipe is fantastic!  Even my meat-loving boyfriend loved them!  I used Sriracha for the Thai chili sauce...and doubled the amount.  Also, after baking for 10 on each side, I crumbled some FF feta on top and broiled until golden brown..  The next time I make these, I will broil on both sides...it added a little crisp (and structure) to the patties.  Served with whole wheat deli rounds, arugula pesto and a slice of tomato.  YUM!!

Delish! I have to admit, my first try of this recipe was using modifications but I don't think they are significant to the overall recipe. I love chipolte black bean burgers but am intolerant of dairy, egg yolks & yeast (at least 1 of which all processed foods seem to contain) so this recipe is a godsend for me. I subbed 5T egg whites & crushed Ritz then drained the processed veg as other reviewers suggested, then baked - these came out perfect. I will be making these weekly & flash freezing for lunches. Thank you for posting!

It's easy to adapt this to a vegan, gluten-free diet. The egg and bread crumbs can be replaced with just over half a cup of grain mix (I used a mix of oats, brown rice, soybeans, millet and sorghum, but any of these on their own would probably do) and a splash of unflavored rice or soy milk. I like making them much smaller and serving them as vegetarian party food with various dips and grilled plantains on the side. A barbecued version would probably work great!

The basic recipe is delightfully easy and I didn't experience the problem that so many reviewers commented on of the burgers falling apart, possibly because I didn't use a food processor. Automation can make it too easy to cross the boundary between chopping and liquification, especially if you're using anything from a tin. I've certainly found that when making falafel - which uses comparable ingredients - so I stayed away from the machine from the outset. It's more work, but (at least for me) has more predictable results and looks prettier!

I am a vegetarian and Im always looking for new recipes with beans and these burgers are awesome. I always twist recipes and for this one I used red pepper instead of green, added more garlic, and used chipotle instead of chili sauce for the added kick. I put them on parchment and in the freezer for a little bit then rubbed olive oil on them and grilled them on the barbecue and they were delicious. 
Definetely a recipe to make again and again. My brother and my dad who are NON vegetarian had them and said "I gotta hand it to ya these are good." and these are people who swear by meat burgers LOL. 
NOTE: I did what a girl had mentioned in the reviews and doubled the egg amount and breadcrumbs as well as straining the pepper/onion/garlic mixture and it was perfect. 5 stars.

This was a great recipe! Just about the best black bean burgers I've ever had! I just about followed it to the T, only I added about 1/4 cup of fresh cilantro. I also used the thai chili sauce and made my own breadcrumbs using organic oat bread and dried parsley, oregano, and rosemary. My roommates loved them too. I'll definitely be making these again!

Very tasty veggie burgers! I processed the veggies and per others comments strained them afterwards. I also dried the beans after rinsing. Had no problems with them holding together. I would definitely make them again.

Was really excited to try this, but the texture wasn't what the family hoped for. The taste was fine but a mushy texture inside, would make a nice bean dip for chips. I am going to try a Quinoa recipe in hopes for a meatier texture.

Incredible. I used oats as well, froze them for a few hours, and broiled them in my toaster oven atop aluminum foil. Just for the record, if they begin to thaw and loose shape don't give up on em' they are incredible. GRRRREAT recipe!

AWESOME!! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because it was a bit weak as far as how it held up consistency wise. I would maybe add an egg white along with the egg or more bread crumbs next time. I didn't have Thai chili paste so I used a hot taco style sauce and still was perfect. Add a piece of gouie provolone and YUM!

It was different... obviously, not being made out of meat. It took a while to do (longer than I thought it would), and I ended up using a hand blender because the beans were not mushing up properly using just a fork or potato masher. The hand blender did great. It was not bad! I may make again.

I have made these many times for my family.  We absolutely love them.  I just leave out the chili powder when I'm making it for my kids because that makes the burgers really spicy.  I follow the recipe otherwise.

So I am trying to find a healthier way to substitute burgers, as well as stay away from processed foods, so I tried these out because I pretty much always have these ingredients at home.  The flavor is delicious! Only tweaks I made were that I used red onion and I used two cloves of garlic instead of three.  I also tried to be extra healthy and put oats per one of the reviews I read here, but I think that dried it out a bit.  Next time I will use the breadcrumbs, because I am definitely making them again!

This was a pretty good recipe; it's a keeper even if I do have one already for a veggie burger. It uses shredded zucchini, fine chopped mushrooms, brown rice and parmesan and mozzarella cheese for the base. I burned it and didn't have anymore of some of the ingredients to be able to remake so I found this one to do. This calls for ingredients always on hand and not alot of ingredients and it still tastes great...in a different way than my usual but with the ease all around, it may become my number 1.

This was great!  I used a little less hot sauce and chilli powder, and it was still amazing.  This is one of those things whre the natural flavors are what you taste at first, but then the heat builds and kicks you when you're almost done eating.  Will make it with Thai Chilli sauce next time.  Oh I had to make my own bread crumbs this time, easy and quick process.

Love these burgers and what a savings over the ones you purchase at the market.  I used what I had which meant replacing green pepper for red and ground saltine crackers for bread crumbs.  Delcious and easy.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you for the recipe.

These burgers were delicious.  I squeezed the moisture out of the veggies before adding them to beans.  Also, I made 8 - 1/4 cup thin patties and put them in the freezer for a quick meal.

These were very yummy! I added extra breadcrumbs and some oats but they still fell apart a bit :(. Next time I will try 2 eggs. I went easy on the spices because I was making them for my 2 year-old but I needn't have-there was no 'kick' at all.

I've been making this recipe for years.  I love how these taste.  Be careful calling them veggie burgers b/c the taste and texture very much says "bean burger."  What I love the most about this recipe is how many veggies you can stack on this burger and it still remains so healthy!  My favorite is avocados, tomato, lettuce, and pickles.

Flavor was ok, but way too much chili powder.  They fell apart on my grill, but I didn't freeze them first as others suggested.  That would definitely help, but the flavor was not worth a repeat.

This one is a keeper. Nice flavor. Here is what I did different to keep the burgers from falling apart. I used used Town House crackers instead of the bread crumbs and I doubled the amount. I hand chopped the peppers, onions, and garlic and I also added fresh cilantro.  I formed the patties on a tin foil lined cookie sheet and froze before cooking. Cooked on a cast iron skillet with a small amount of canola oil. Cook until brown flip once and brown the other side. Maybe 7 minutes each side. Very delicious.

I used other's suggestions and added egg to help bind. I grilled them and had some difficulty with the patties sticking to the greased foil. Definately tasty and will make again!

Just tried this recipe with a few recommended adjustments ie: added 2 eggs and 1 cup bread crumbs.  I also added cooked spinach, mushrooms and about 3/4 cup parmesean cheese.  Absolutely fabulous!! I'm looking forward to trying this recipe with blue cheese.  This is a real keeper!!

This was the first time I have tried to make (and eat) a black bean burger and let me tell you... This was awesome! I don't have a food processor so it took longer to finely cut the vegetables, but it was worth every minute of extra time. Yum! I will definitely be making this again.

I also found the mixture to be too sloppy to hold together.  I added more breadcrumbs, but they still fell apart.
I will try the last poster's recommendations next time.
The flavour was awesome though.

These were tasty but the consistency was kinda mushy (like refried beans) compared to what you could buy pre-made at the store. My burger was still very good and I enjoyed it.

This recipe is FABULOUS. I followed it to a the letter and even froze the leftovers. It is, however, severely lacking salt. And I'm not heavy with the salt! Just be aware of this- and top with some guacamole and pico de gallo- delicious!!!

I make these burgers as written everytime with the addition of chipotle paste instead of hot sauce. The hint to squeeze the liquid out of the onions and peppers works like a charm. I also freeze my patties before I grill them. My vegetarian friends and non-vegetarian friends alike love them! Thanks for such an awsome recipe!

My meat eating hubby LOVED these and even went for seconds!  I recommend making them into 6 patties, and I cut back the chili and cumin to 1tps instead of 1T.  Serve with pepperjack cheese and lettuce on your favorite roll or with rice. YUM!

Simply delicious!  I love chili powder, cumin and chili sauce, so these were a flavor home run for me.  I followed other suggestions and a) pressed the liquid out of the onion, pepper and garlic mixture and b) added more bread crumbs.  Baked, on a potato roll with a slice of onion, tomato and lettuce, these were super.

I was leery of using canned beans, since so many reviews said it was more like batter than moldable dough.  I soaked my own beans, and cooked them until they were al dente.  Then I processed them in a meat grinder.  They came out fluffy and easily conformed to patties when used in this recipe.  I added an extra egg and an extra 1/4 c. bread crumbs, probably because I used more beans. I ended up with a mix that felt like meatloaf.  I baked them, and they were great!

These are pretty tasty and have good texture.  I will definitely be making them again (and I'm not a vegetarian).

These were great. I am new to being vegetarian and was looking for something to make ahead to have on a weekday night. These are perfect for a quick meal. I used my food processor but will try again with the Vitamix. Mine did crumble a little in the pan when flipping, I'll try freezing like others suggested and using a little more breadcumbs.

The flavor was good, but the consistency was really gross. Crispy on the outside, and mushy on the inside. I followed the recipe to a T, so I don't think I did anything wrong. A squishy burger is just not for me.

Only modification I followed was using oatmeal instead of bread crumbs.  Kept in the fridge for the day. These were more of a paste, and really didn't taste that good.  Darn--I was hoping for a yummy veggie burger!

Wonderful dish!  I had prepared a mix of black beans and black eyed peas 2 days before and decided to use that instead.   I added crushed red pepper instead of hot sauce and red bell pepper instead of green.  My 13 year old son loved ate it on an english muffin and loved it!

Absolutely delicious ! I tweaked the recipe a bit by reducing the cumin and chilli powder and adding ground Chipotle . I also added Gabanzo flour to stiffen the mix up a bit. Scrum yum !

Awesome. I didn't follow the measurements, just the list of ingredients. Used rolled oats & breadcrumbs, rinsed & drained the beans, and strained liquid out of pureed pepper/onion mixture. Held together great. I think next time I'll add some more texture by not mashing up beans so much & using all oats & no breadcrumbs. But it really was great. Whole wheat buns, sliced avacado & a mayo/hot sauce spread. Made two very large patties. Hubby LOVED it!

Made these tonight for the first time. I used instant oats as suggested by others, along with 2 eggs. 

Overall, they were tolerable but next time I'll bake them. A little mushy on the inside, yet crisp on the outside.

I will try it again and perhaps try a few tweaks in the recipe to suit my tastes. 

I really want these to work out. I didn't have trouble making them stick together. I refrigerated the mix for an hour before cooking them. I plopped the mix on to a non-stick surface and pressed them into burgers with no troubles at all.

Just made these burgers. The only changes I made were to add an extra quarter cup of bread crumbs, I used a yellow bell pepper instead, and I added a half a jalapeno pepper. I used my food processor to chop all the ingredients first, then mixed them and shaped them. I placed them on a foiled try and froze them for about an hour. I used a grill pan with a little Smart Balance spray to cook one up and it was YUM!!! I'm keeping the rest frozen for a quick lunch/dinner. They are a bit soft but it doesn't even matter because they're so tasty and healthy!

This was really good!  We are eating strictly vegan so we used another binder besides egg.  We used flax seeds grounded in water.  Taste is a 5 but it needed to be firmer without using bread crumbs.  I added brown rice and served open faced on a bun. My husband like the burgers so this is a keeper.

These are very very good!  I followed the recipe almost exactly except I probably used more breadcrumbs than called for (I didn't measure, just mixed them in until I liked the consistency.  I baked a few and fried a couple in a small amount of canola oil so I could decide which way I preferred.  I really couldn't decide between the fried and the baked, they were both excellent so in the future I will probably bake to keep them as healthy as possible.  I didn't eat them as burgers but made a small salad with lettuce, tomato, and avocado and added a little dressing and put the patty on top with some cheese.  An excellent light but filling dinner!  I gave it 4 stars only because I would have preferred a little more kick and a little less cumin.

This is a very delicious recipe and it is VERY spicy! But my family like spicy, so that was ok. Instead of mashing and mixing like the recipes calls for, just put all of it in a food processor. It will probably turn out like a sticky muffin batter, but all you have to do is add bread crumbs or rolled oats until its hard enough to make patties. Have fun!

Excellent! These are so easy to make and come out fantastic! Good for freezing and reheating later. The only change I made was adding panko instead of regular bread crumbs and used 1 cup of them.

This was a really quick and easy meal.  I didn't know what to add as a condiment - ketchup didn't work so well.  I ended up topping the burger with sliced avocado and some salsa.  It was really great!

Very good.  Much better than the frozen stuff.  Foil didn't work for me.  I moved it over to a pam sprayed grill and it turned out great.  Even had grill marks.  Served it with melted cheese and sour cream.  No bun.

Totally delicious, healthy and easy! My family and I love these, even my 1 year old. Freezing does keep them from falling apart so I highly recommend that. As the other reviews say, you will never want to eat store bought veggie burgers again.

They fell apart. The taste was okay (just like beans, not special), but they would not stay together, although I drained the beans.  I might try it again with 2 eggs, add some fresh herbs, and work on the spice mix.  If you make these, try 2 eggs and a nonstick pan (I fried them in oil.)

First time making any veggie burger and I was shocked at how good it tasted. It did fall apart a bit but the taste was yummy! My whole family loved them and loved the fact that you were full but not that "stuffed" feeling like when you eat a meat burger. I will be making this again for sure!

They were absolutely great!! Feel apart easily, but that was better than a dry burger.  I did add a little portabello mushroom to it, but followed the recipe other than that.

I can imagine tweaking this in about 14 zillion different ways. I put shredded carrots in mine because I was out of onion, put in salsa, which made it too watery, so I added a bit extra bread to firm it back up and it was STILL great. All three of my kids (including a 9 year-old carnivore/picky-eater) loved it. Good Studd

These patties are so good but i would add salt, pepper, don't put in so much cumin and oil the foil before cooking. I am so 
glad i tried these and the whole family loves them, I thought they looked just like the ones from the store and tasted even better.

Great recipe! Per others' suggestions, I used double breadcrumbs and red pepper instead of green and they turned out fantastic! My bf is so picky and he ate these like crazy!

I had high hopes for these... unfortunately they didn't deliver. They held together fine and looked amazing, but the texture of the cooked burger was mushy and not very appetizing. I don't think I'll make these again. Too much work for meh taste.

This was my first time making Veggie Burgers and they were SOOO amazing. I added serrano peppers which made the burger very spicy, and added corn. I also made a delicious sauce to go on top!

Excellent on the grill!  I added about 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 3/4 cup of mushrooms.  We served them with a dollop of goat cheese.  Yummy!

Delicious. I put the tin foil on the grill before I turned it on and then spooned the mix on to the foil like cookie dough and shaped them with the spoon. It worked very well, meaning they did not fall apart, and with minimal oil they did not stick to the foil. I am definitely going to add something to make it spicier next time though.

Ok, so I've found my new "go-to" recipe.  I altered it just a bit by sauteeing the onions, peppers, and garlic in olive oil first. I also added corn and crushed red peppers for a spicy twist.  This recipe is so easy! I'll never buy a frozen veggie burger again!

Delicious and very satisfying! I think they need more than 10 minutes in the oven, but though mine seem a little mushy I had no problems with keeping them together (added a little more breadcrumbs) or their getting too dry. This amount seemed more to me like 10 patties' worth, but then, I'm happy to eat two in a row :) I reduced some of the spices to make it easier on the stomach but it's still flavourful.

I doubled the recipe and added two eggs. These were so good! The recipe made 9 huge burgers, and we had four left over after dinner. We had two the next day for lunch, and then 2 the day after. The kids even ate them, though they did say "these don't taste like regular burgers Mom!" (I didn't tell them they were made from beans!) 

This recipe will be a staple in my 2 week menu rotation from now on!

The burger was delicious! Being a student on a budget, I definitely appreciate that this was an inexpensive and quick meal. I used 2 eggs, as recommended by some of the other reviews, and I had to use a little more bread crumbs in order to hold it together. Lastly, I used red bell pepper instead of green. I will definitely be making this dish again.

Delicious! I added 1 tsp. creole seasoning and replaced cumin with curry since I was out and it gave the burgers a nice kick without being hot. I over-toasted 3 slices of wheat toast and crumbled in place of bread crumbs and it worked great.

I didn't know how to rate this because i had never eaten a black bean burger before. Therefor I'm solely basing it on my opinion of a first experienc. I loved the flavor. I put sliced avocados and salsa/mayo on it and it tasted really good. BUT, they were hard to keep together and the texture was really mushy, not like an actual burger. I took another members advise and froze them first but I think it just needs more breadcrumbs or something. Also I think I'll add shredded zucchini to it next time. All in all, I did enjoy them and will make them again!

NO NEED TO DRY EVERYTHING!!! I just formed the patties put them on wax paper and thru them in the freezer for a bit( about 30 minutes) They stayed together quite nicely! I did add old fashion oatmeal to mine instead of the breadcrumbs since I didnt have any.And since we arent vegetarians, I did add some shredded cheese in the mix!  My husband who was scared to try this LOVED it!

I love these burgers!! I almost never have bell pepper around, so I often substitute hot peppers (serranos, jalapenos) instead. I also cut the amount of chili powder in half but roughly double the hot sauce. Just tonight I made a batch and added some Mexican oregano, which tasted great. I also prefer making five smaller patties as opposed to four huge ones, but that's just a preference. Really delicious recipe overall!

I love this recipe, It rocks and is so simple. My sister in law is a very picky eater; I convinced her to try one, and she asked for seconds. I call them 'chilli sandwiches' rather than veggie burger. For some reason this makes people more receptive of them 

I use off brand ritz crackers for bread crumbs, and I cook the black beans, rather than using canned. I triple the recipe every time I make it. The cost per serving is roughly 0.32 cents per sandwich, including a loaf of bread! I generally bake mine and eat them at least once a week; if not more!

These had a great flavor but next time I will grill them or maybe try pan-frying them--that is strictly preference because I don't like the veggie burgers that you buy in the store due to a lack of texture.  If you are used to those then these are awesome.  I added just a little extra panko crumbs to ensure that they didn't fall apart.  I baked them for twelve minutes on one side and eight on the other hoping that they would firm up before the flip and they did great.  I also made 8 small patties instead of four, again to help keep them together.  Yum! UPDATE: I originally rated this 4 stars since I intended to change some things next time, however, my very meat-eating husband's curiosity got the better of him and he tried a tiny bite when I wasn't looking.  He said he was amazed at how good these are.  If this recipe gets him to eat a veggie burger then it deserves 5 stars and more.

All I could taste was black bean and chili powder. I will use less chili powder next time, and try mixing a variety of beans for more depth. Good base for a veggie burger though - I'm new to them - so thanks, Lauren.

I have never had a black bean patty before, so I really have nothing to base this recipe on BUT these taste amazing! I made them for a big barbeque because my friend couldn't eat meat (lent). She was so happy I thought of her but even more so when she tasted them. She raved about the flavor! One thing that was different when i made them was that I used black beans that I had boiled myself. Maybe that was the difference it need but my patty formed really nicely. I did have a little problem with stickiness, but if I sprinkled a little bread crumbs on the patty before forming, there was no problems. Also, I couldn't get them to stop sticking to the foil on the grill, so I ended up pan frying them with a little bit of veggie oil and it gave them a nice little crust on the outside. I will definitely be making these again for our next barbeque.

I pretty much followed this recipe to a tee. I just put in a handful extra bread crumbs and a bit more chili powder. We LOVE these burgers. I topped it with spinach leaves, pepperjack cheese, and some ketchup and mustard. Next time Ill try topping it with avocado and sour cream. I'll definitely be making this again!

This is a great recipe. I made black bean tacos last night and had a large bowl left of the beans. I would have given this recipe 5 stars but couldn't since I didn't follow it to a T.

My left over beens had corn and roasted red peppers, cilantro and cayenne pepper in them. I didn't have any green bell peppers but I did have the roasted reds. I also used  a sweet chiptole mustard as the condiment

Overall, a GREAT recipe. I won't buy frozen burgers anymore knowing how easy they are.

One thing i would caution is that these are very HEARTY. I made them the same size as I make regular burgers and they were too big. I would say this recipe would make 6 filling patties.

I was pretty happy with the way these turned out. They were filling, tasty and super easy to make, plus I felt good about how healthy they were. My only complaint is that they're a little bland - next time, I'll be experimenting with more spices or flavors.

This was the first veggie burger recipe I tried.  It is, basically, a good recipe.  I baked the burgers a little longer than the recipe called for and they still came out too moist; they did not hold their form.  Still, I will never eat frozen veggie burgers again.

yummy - used carrots and worcestershire 1 T too - also made own bread crumbs with whole wheat Wasa crackers - put them in freezer to keep them together - have also added habanero peppers in it too :)

12/19 - used gf breadcrumbs, chili sauce, worcestershire, hot sauce - should put veggies in blender then strained them to remove extra water then add in black beans,  had to use a LOT of bread crumbs since we did not strain first - plus cooking took a long time

Amazing, especially as sliders with some sweet dinner rolls, cheese, and extra spinach. Since I didn't have green peppers, I used spinach. And I didn't have a food processor, so I preferred to preserve the integrity of the produce and chop the onions, spinach, garlic into bite size bits/hand mix/press/ pan seared vs. grilling. This came out wonderful and looks so beautiful with the different chunks of produce.

Well, the only other black bean burgers Ive tasted was the ones we can buy at Costco and I love those.  These did not taste anything like those but they had there own flavor and were so yummy.  My family thought they were too spicy and I didnt even put in 1/2 tsp of hot sauce in it.  I thought it was great and maybe needed more hot sauce. I did add a little salt to these after tasting the first burger.  These were easy to put together but were kind of sloppy when trying to form patties.  I had to throw tin foil down on my grill and just spoon the mixture on and form it with the spoon.  They cooked up just fine and hardened quickly so i could flip them.  In the end they looked just like a patty and held together well.   So end product was awsome but forming patties was quite difficult.

These were so good.  They leave you very full.
I did as few of the posters suggested.  I dried the beans and got the excess water out of the onions, garlic, and peppers.  Instead of the 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs I used 3/4 cup.  I also used increased the egg by half.  They were the perfect consistency for patties.  I think next time I may add a little spice with crushed red pepper or a jalapeno pepper.  These are VERY comparable to the store bought frozen patties.  You will not be disappointed.

I have tried to make black bean burgers a few times in the past and have had to throw them out because they were horrible so when i told my husband I was going to try these he pretty much begged me not to. These were so good! I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems at all withthem being to wet. We both loved them and had them the next day too. One suggestion is that they are really good in a wrap filled with crunchy veggies (lettuce, onion, carrots)
Thanks for sharing:)

Very tasty and easy!  I didn't have any peppers on hand so I added extra heat. Used ezekial bread for the crumbs. Used a masher for the beans instead of blender- the patties held together perfectly. Loved them!

These were great! Though I made quite a few changes just because of personal preference. I ended up using quite a bit more than 1/2 a cup of breadcrumbs. I didn't use bell pepper or onion, but i used cilantro and tomatillo. I added grated parmesan cheese which came out wonderful! I made twice the serving and froze them the night before (I live in a dorm so I end up cooking for quite a few people). I didn't have any problems with getting them to form up, but that may have been because of the freezing or the use of extra bread crumbs.  They tasted amazing! Confirmed by vegetarian and non vegetarians alike. Will definitely make again.

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I substituted the hot sauce for Worcester sauce and it was delicious.  I felt like I was eating a veggie burger from a restaurant.  Even my carnivorous boyfriend loved it! Thanks so much!

Great recipe!  It made huge burgers.  I added jalapenos and it was excellent.  Plus, I put in a cup of bread crumbs and didn't have a problem with the burgers breaking.

Loved this burger!  I made it the night before so it had time to firm up in the fridge, but it was still a bit softer than I'd like.  I think I'll add some corn and oats next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This passed the kid test. We have been meat eaters and are cutting back, trying to eat more beans b/c of cost and they are good for ya. It is hard to find recipes my kids like since this is new for them.  I did use cracker crumbs instead of breadcrumbs b/c it isn't something i usually keep in the house.

Excellent!  They are pretty dry, but I guess that's a bean burger for you.  I doubled the egg and breadcrumbs, halved the cumin, and added some corn.  Perfect consistency.  Slathering them with some good sauce of your choice helps compensate for the dryness.

My first veggie burger, ever eaten or made, and it was easy and delicious! I used 2 egg whites instead of 1 egg, and a bit more breadcrumbs than stated, red pepper instead of green, and less cumin for personal taste. I baked in the oven, and had no trouble with them falling apart, and I didn't squeeze out any of the moisture as others mention. Thanks laurenmu!!

Very tasty.This is the second time using the recipe and I loved them better the second time. I pretty much followed the recipe but I drained my beans and let them sit after mashing them so the beans   dried out a bit not a bad thing (Accident - ran to the store but adding a little water did the trick). I chopped my vegetables and sauteed them, I also added more bread crumbs until the mixture held together well and I placed them in the pan to cook. Adding more breadcrumbs made them better this time as they were really sticky last time, egg was undone, also flattened them out more. I got 4 patties. Added a slice of mozzarella cheese and the fixings...Yum!

These were excellent!! and the recipe was very easy to follow as written. I omitted the chili powder and sauce because i didn't have any on hand. Instead used sweet chili sauce as a 'mayo' and served with salsa and avocado slices. Too good ...

These burgers are delicious! All the spices really give them a kick, my girlfriend's a vegetarian and I made these for her for dinner one night as a meatless option, but they ended being the hit of the night! I grew up with really spicy food however, so what I like to do is chop up a couple of chipotle chilis and mix them in with the burgers and then top it off with salsa and shredded colby jack, but that's really only for the most adventurous. Awesome recipe!

these are awesome.  We have made them a few times now and I find that using the food processor as it says makes them a bit too liquidy.  So we simply use a chopper to do the onion and pepper and garlic... they turn out much better.

Let me qualify this review by first saying that I LOVE real, beef hamburgers.  hopefully that will explain why i sound so harsh.    i was driven to this recipe by the cheapness of black beans and am trying to find a way to eat them that doesn't taste like eating cardboard.  lentils and chickpeas i can do... but beans sort of elude me.    For me the word 'burger' has a powerful association with delicious, warm beef juices dripping down your chin, and also a sense of pleasure from the post-consumption mini-coma.  it isnt really fair to ask any sort of burger 'replacement' to compete with that.  i tried calling them 'patties' or something else w/o the associative power of the word 'burger', but i fear it was too late.    on a more rational note- i followed all the suggestions about how to make them stay together to no avail.  of the 9 i made, i did not have 1 come out as a solid patty.  I had more bean 'crumbles'.   I also found them all to be quite dry bland (my kingdom for some beef juices!), and had to add lots of pico de gallo and hot sauce to get them down the gullet.  my roommate was less condemning.  so if you are into the super-healthy thing and aren't bothered by blandness... this may not be so bad.  if you are a burger lover, this will be disappointing.

These were delicious!!  I made as directed, except I added a bit of salt/pepper and pan fried rather than baked.  Also, splitting into 4 patties was way too big (too big for a bun) so we just ate then bunless.  They were still delicious, but if you need a bun, ten split into 6 patties I think will work better.

I'm not a vegetarian, but these are good to have if you just feel like having something healthy.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was 1cup bread crumbs. The flavors were a bit strong, but I couldn't figure out if it was the garlic or the cumin, as other people have mentioned. It wont stop me from making it again. Next time I'll just use less and see what happens. Compared to a regular burger, they are mushy, so I recommend a soft bun rather than something toasted that will squish it. I might even mash one up and put it in a pita for lunch tomorrow!

took these to the last cookout before winter and they went over very well! We grilled two and baked two to see which were better, and I would recommend baking them. Also, I like my black bean burgers spicy, and while these were good, they were a bit bland, so I will no doubt be spicing them up in the future. Also, I added corn and took the suggestion to add 50% more bread crumbs... it was a winning combo! I will most definitely be making these again!

great recipe to make ahead and freeze for future lunches. my husband loves it bc it adds a spicy variety to his lunch. i throw in a jalapeno pepper to kick it up and top off the patty with salsa, pepperjack and a generous slice of avocado.

Soooo good! I added curry powder, and then cooked them in a pan, 8 min on each side. They turned out perfectly!

Good stuff. I used garlic powder instead of fresh only because I was too lazy to pull out my processor and then clean in :) Pan fried in a bit of olive oil.

I made these and they were amazing!  I did make some changes though.  Put all the ingredients, minus the bread crumbs, into a blender to get a smoother texture and added about 1/4 cup of oats and an extra 1/4 cup of bread crumbs to thicken the mixture.  Delicious!  I froze the patties for quick weeknight dinners!

I used diced red onion instead of yellow onion, I thought it was flavorful that way. I only added 1 tsp each of the spices. Panko crumbs might be good here. It was kind of mushy, I sprinkled each side with cornmeal before frying. Freezing it for a while helped it keeps its shape better. I wonder if using smoke flavoring would make it taste more burger-like? Don't think I will make again. Although it doesn't taste bad, it tastes like black beans (duh...), and if you're not vegetarian you might as well have the real thing and search for another vegetarian recipe if youre looking to eat less meat.

For as high a rating as this had I was a bit disappointed it was ENTIRELY too much cumin. All I could taste was cumin. It's a good base, but need some spice adjustments to be edible in my book.

These burgers are very flavorful and delicious!  I added more breadcrumbs until the consistency was similar to meat patties.  The first time I prepared these, I baked them but the insides were too mushy.  They are much better fried or grilled.

These are my favorite! I make them all the time! I use crushed shredded wheat instead of bread crumbs, egg whites instead of a whole egg and I omit the hot sauce (I usually top it with pepper jack cheese.) SO good!

i absolutely love this recipe! i made this for a small get-together at my house and everyone loved it. as a vegetarian, i'm always looking for new recipes that i'll like but it's difficult to get my friends and family to agree. tofu, i've come to learn, is and acquired taste but even my non-vegetarian friends praised these burgers! the only change i made was replacing the bread crumbs with ground oatmeal. i added about 50% more to the recipe because it seemed a little loose. the oatmeal definitely gave it more structure.

These smelled out of this world!  As they baked, my stomach growled.  However, they ended up being a little bland.  I'm going to increase the spices next time and maybe sautee them on the stove top.  My husband, however, adored these and asked me to make them regularly.

I love this recipe but fist time they were too wet and second time too dry. Both times i cooked on an outdoor grill...the only way in my opinion! im BBQing tonight with my hippie friends/neighbors and am making them. i think my problem may be the size of each individual burger. so tonight i will use my measuring cup to gauge the size better and make each burger more consistent.

I made these for a barbeque last summer because I had invited one of those "pesky" vegetarians (just kidding!) and need something different. She LOVED them, and another neighbor took one thinking it was a cheeseburger. He loved it so much his wife made them the next day. They are great.

After my husband said he liked the black bean burger at a local restaurant, I figured I would try to make them myself.  My husband loved it.  I used a previously reviewers suggestion and strained the beans, peppers and onion.  I also added some cilantro, but I don't think it made a difference.  I used a little less spice just to be safe, but next time I think I will use more. I froze 1/2 and used half that day.  They held together great.  I ate them on a bun with lettuce, tomato and low fat mayo.

Definitely no more frozen black bean burgers.  This was cheaper and most important, just as tasty.  I followed some of the advice and used two eggs and a full cup of bread crumbs.  I also mashed the beans in a food processor instead of with a fork (was already using it so I figured why not make it easier on myself).  I baked instead of grilled.  The only issue was that the larger burgers didn't stay together as well as the smaller ones I made (bite-sized for my toddler), but that didn't really bother me.  Good spice.  I don't usually add too much salt to my dishes anyway.  I may use ground flax seed the next time.  It's been a great binder in other recipes I've used it in.  I would definitely recommend this recipe to others.  Thank you.  :)

I used spicy black beans,omitted the sauce as I have read reviews that burgers are mushy.  I did not process the onions or bell pepper.  At last minute, I decided to press into a small oval loaf pan.  Baked mixture about 35 minutes at 400...Wonderful!  Can be sliced, used as a burger,nor eaten as a side dish.

This was amazing. I loved it, and it's very WW friendly.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and rinsed the beans and pat them dry, and got rid of the excess water in the veggies, as well as increasing the bread crumbs slightly. They stuck together, and I used a hamburger patty press to make them pretty :)  These are AMAZING. No joke, I'm not one of those people who review everything as delicious, and I am quite picky. These will be a staple for me.

We really really wanted to like these. Really. I liked them the most of the five of us, but they were nothing to write home about. I tried making them without the cumin to see if that was what my family didn't like, but they still didn't go over very well.

This was not very good. When I found this recipe, I was expecting the texture to be more meat-like (like the store bought burgers). However, these were very mushy. I would not make these again, but then again I am not a vegetarian.

Tastes great.  I put all the ingredients in the food processor and mixed until it was the consistancy that I wanted.  I did end up adding more bread crumbs than indicated.  I baked in the oven and the burgers held up nicely when flipping.  I am keeping this recipe, and I may try it with different beans next time.

We used dry beans and boiled them. They didn't stick together. We won't make these again.

I will NEVER buy frozen veggie burgers ever again.  I did put in the freezer about 1 hour prior to baking.  Only changes were 1 tsp ground cumin, 1 shredded carrot and 1 shredded jalapeno pepper instead of the hot sauce.  Also used 10 crushed fat free saltine crackers for the bread crumbs and 1/4 cup egg beaters for the real egg.  It made 4 really decent sized burgers.  Almost a fat free food and will make on a regular basis.  The only item I had to buy was a can of black beans.  I had everything else already on hand.

I used egg white and only 1/3 cup bread crumbs and these held together fine for me. Pan-fried with cooking spray over med/med-high heat for about 4 to 5 minutes on each side and got really good reviews from family.

Amazing! I made a couple of revisions to make the burgers hold together better. I upped the breadcrumbs to 3/4 cup and strained the onion/pepper/garlic mixture to remove excess liquid. Will definitely make again!

A good base for tinkering.  I found the recipe as written to be a wee bit bland.  And almost entirely un-grillable.  Definitely follow the suggestions for making the burgers hold together better.

Very simple, very good, and very easy to modify.  I can honestly say this is my new favorite bean burger.  I started making these and then realized I was out of bread crumbs so I used matzo meal as a substitute.  I was a little nervous about the amount of spicy seasoning but didn't notice it in the burger once cooked.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used two eggs.  I also do not have a food processor, so I diced my ingredients finely and mashed the beans with a potato masher.  My mixture was very sticky but it cooked perfectly.  I also made mine on the stovetop over medium heat.  I lightly sprayed a pan, covered, and flipped halfway when it was nice and brown.  It took about 10 minutes.

After reading the reviews I decided to try this and I was not disappointed at all. Loved this burger and it was so simple to make. I did add two eggs doubled the bread crumbs. I add fresh jalapenos since I love spicy food. Made extra and froze it for during the week. I would never buy a premade burger again.

So delicious!  I blended the beans in with the green pepper, onion and garlic to get a really nice consistency.  Also, I doubled the bread crumbs so the patties would stick together.  Will definitely be making this again soon!

very good taste but missing some "bite" in the texture department... i think i might have mashed my beans too much?  i think i'll play with this a bit, maybe by adding rolled oats or rice?  it just seemed a bit too creamy to me.  hmmmmmmm... great start though... thanks for the recipe!

Love, love, love these.  I do find them a little crumbly so I prefer to bake them rather than grill them.  But they taste great.  The last time I made them I added some carrot, and spinach to the food processor with the other ingredients from the recipe and it turned out really tasty.  Thanks for sharing this one!

I too had to add more bread crumbs than the recipe called for, and even then I was worried because the mixture seemed rather gloopy, but they actually turned out pretty good! This is my first time making veggie burgers, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. Once I got past the expectation that it should actually resemble hamburger meat in any way, I appreciated that they tasted good! Something in the flavor makes me want to try version with Mexican flavors, cheese, sour cream and/or salsa. I tried this recipe mostly as a way of trying to get more fiber into my diet. A black bean patty on a whole wheat bun is about 40% of my fiber needs in one meal! Much tastier than fiber drinks!

I really like these.  I didn't use the egg because I made just one for myself.  I had this just like a regular burger, with American cheese and my regular toppings.  I also made a chipotle mayo, as one review suggested, and I loved it with this burger! I would highly recommend that suggestion.  Easy and trusty recipe for vegetarian burgers (or vegan if you omit the egg!)

This is a great veggie burger recipe.  I've made it twice and am super happy with it! No more frozen veg burgers for me.  The 1st time I made it exactly like the recipe.  The 2nd time I used only the egg white, and 1/2c oatmeal (put it in my food process).  It was a little moist, but I wanted to stick with the amt.  Thx, IL2C

These were very yummy. I also added about 50% more bread crumbs. I also had to add some salt to my final product. So I would suggest adding 1 teaspoon of salt to the recipe. Also they were a bit spicy, and I'm Mexican, that's saying a lot!

This recipe is awesome. I did squeeze out excess water from my pepper and onion before mixing it and also doubled the eggs and bread crumbs, perfect consistency. I baked mine and they were yummy!

I wasn't a fan as is. Might be workable-but, definitely not what I was looking for. I love all the ingredients- but, too moist to solidify as is, then not quite the flavor I am hunting.

We have recently started eating more veggie meals and I had high hopes for this recipe. It had flavor but too much cumin for my taste. My son (8 yr old vegetarian) loved it. My 6 year old daughter and husband did not care for it at all. I will probably make this and freeze them for my son when I cook meat dishes.

I always have a hard time getting these not to stick no matter how much spray or oil I use...but I LOVE the flavor & my meat eater boyfriends over the years have too!
Update: I have made these so many times...what I do now is make the mix ahead of time & let them sit in the fridge as patties for about an hour or 2..I heat some veg oil-about an inch (Olive oil has never worked for me, it always soaks into the patties & makes them weird) I fry these up (2-3 mins each side) carefully turning them. I figure they're healthy enough I can afford to fry them in a little oil to have a burger that will hold together & the little bit of crunch on the outside is an added bonus!

So good and so easy. Never tried grilling them, but baking them is so quick and simple. My mix seemed really wet even after I added more bread crumbs, but I just spooned it onto the cookie sheet and patted it into a burger shape. They baked just perfectly. Feel free to use bread crumbs or a combo of bread crumbs and oats. I will say that it is a thick burger and needs lots of good toppings like tomato, lettuce, grilled onion etc. Whole family liked them!

Delicious recipe.  I did sub oats for the breadcrumbs and finely diced the onions and peppers by hand.  Plan on making up several batches and freezing so hubby can grill them whenever he wants.

Followed recipe exactly. As a carnivore, gotta say this did not rank high on our chart of yum. DH took a bite and immediately went for the peanut butter. I DO think, though, had we been eating frozen veggie burgers from the grocery on a regular basis, this would have been tantalizing in the extreme. We won't be doing these again...backing away from pseudo meat for now. Thank you for posting, though. Oh! And flavor is improved with ketchup on the finished product. I wonder, too, if adding some portabella mushroom would give it an actual hint of a meaty taste.

I had to give this 4 stars just because I made a few changes. But this is a great base recipe, and I really think it would be delicious as written! In case you want to know here is what I did: chopped the veggies (peppers, jalapeno, onion, garlic) in the food processor and sauteed them; used a mix of bread crumbs and oatmeal; seasoned to taste and not by tsp or tbsp; and added Worcestershire and liquid smoke. I did not add extra breadcrumbs or egg. The mixture was fine. If you grill, watch the time. We had to grill for a little longer than written. But this made a fantastic veggie burger. We won't ever buy store brands again. Thank you so much for the wonderful ideas!!

These were delicious, but too spicy for my kids. My oldest (9) ate hers and loved the flavor, but needed a lot of milk! I will tone down the spice next time to suit the younger two. The texture and flavor of these are great, so much better than store bought veggie burgers. Next time I will serve with chipotle mayo like another user recommended, that would have been the perfect touch.

I'm making them as I type! They look amazing. I hate onion so I substituted jarred roasted red peppers (drained and all that) instead and it smells AMAZING!

These are great!  The texture was really moist for me, and not really like a burger (I'm not a vegetarian) but still yummy!  I just had a can of black beans in the pantry and wanted to do something with them and found this recipe.  I baked them for the recommended time, and they look like they are getting dried out, but they were crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.  I subbed Worcestershire sauce for the chili sauce and only used a tsp. of the seasonings.  Also added salt and pepper and they were great!  I also did my beans in the food processor as well.  Much easier than mashing them with a fork!

EXCELLENT flavor with substitutes of red onion and red pepper.  Other change was quick oats rather than bread crumbs.  Rated 4 rather than 5 stars b/c unless you do freeze these prior to cooking, they are ridiculously sticky & unmanageable w/o added dry agent.  But, very much worth making!!!

Not bad, the flavour was fairly good but I didn't love the texture. A bit grainy.

I followed the directs of drying the beans out, after I drained and rinsed in colander I layed them out on a piece of paper  towel.  I also took my green pepper and onion puree and placed that into the colander with a coffee filter in it to soak up excess juices.  Followed the recipes accordingly.  AWESOME.

I don't cook often, but I'm getting sick of packaged veggie burgers so I decided to give these a try. Boy am I glad I did! Delicious! I used two eggs as suggested, red/orange pepper because I prefer them, and Japanese bread crumbs because that's all I had (3 cups). Otherwise I followed the recipe as-written and these turned out great! I didn't have any problems with them falling apart, the flavor was awesome, and they look really nice too. My guest who makes her own black bean burgers gave them an A+ as well. The only change I might make next time is to add a pinch of salt. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

pretty good! I had no trouble with these. I just ate it as a patty and it seems to me, that guacamole on top and some spicy rice on side, to be more fitting for my liking!

I've been a vegetarian for fifteen years, and this is the first time I've made veggie burgers! I added mushrooms and drained the pureed veggie mixture before adding them to the beans. I discovered half way through the process that my breadcrumbs weren't usable, so I broiled some dark rye bread for ten minutes and then mixed it and some flax meal into the bean/veggie mixture instead, which turned out great. Will definitely make again!

I've made these for my husband and I several times now. Very simple. Great flavor and texture. We've added a bit of cajun seasoning as well and love the outcome. This burger tastes great with a little guacamole on top. Yum!

I made these today and they were pretty good. I thought the taste of cumin was a little overpowering so next I will decrease that, but otherwise I really liked the simple ingredients and easy prep. They pair really well with avocado. Thanks for the recipe!

Thank You so much for sharing this recipe. My patties turned out great..However I made them a little tiny so they got a little crispy but I will remember to correct it next time :). I had my yum veggie burgers with an Indian dessert (Mango Shirkand) -  What a treat for a sunny day!

These are delish! I will however, do things a little differently the next time I make them. A quick pulse or two is all you'll need in the food processor. I went a little too long and has onions & peppers that were practically pureed. I had to squeeze the extra water out of them and it got pretty messy. The flavor was great, I think adding some corn would take it over the top! Be sure to freeze right after making them so they hold their shape, they tend to fall apart while cooking so it's easier to cook them frozen. Definitely a keeper!

i followed the recipe and it came out really good. i drained the juices out of the beans and pepper onions and garlic. I added a little more than half a cup of bread crumbs and the mix holds together a lot better. It baked really nicely. Most importantly, it tastes great.

These were amazing!  I did as others suggested and doubled the eggs and added a bit more breadcrumbs.  I also drained the onion mixture and dried the beans.  I put them on a bun with avocado, tomato, and chipotle mayo (made from a recipe on this site, but I made it with plain Greek yogurt for a healthy alternative) and they were so good!  I will be making these often.

I think I took all the changes into consideration, but still wasn't that impressed.  They tasted like refried beans baked into pattie form.  They were way too dry to be called Veggie Burgers.  They're a useful addition to the vegetarian recipe box, but won't be replacing store bought - yet.

Most delicious veggie burger I have ever tried!I made mine from dried beans. I added 1/2 cup of corn,and brown rice in place of the bread crumbs. I also used 1 TBSP flaxseed meal mixed with 3 TBSP boiling water as an egg substitute. All these variations are for people like me who have allergies to eggs & wheat. I removed the liquid from the veggies and corn before mixing with beans but still had a hard time holding the burger together. But the taste is so fantastic that I really dont mind it falling apart. Better than real beef burgers. Oh ya- I also added Chipotle sauce to mine to make it superb!!!!!

I love black bean burgers! This recipe is a great one. I decided to add corn to it because i love the little bit of sweet with the spicy. I dont think it made the recipe better or worse, just a little variation :)

This was a mess to make, but fun to eat. Cumin to taste, I think a tablespoon is too little, but two is two much. Chili powder should be mixed in with the beans first before putting the onions on. I'm still working on making them not fall apart in the pan. My taste tester loved them, made with tater tots.

What a delicious dinner!  My husband was skeptical, but had to admit - these are more flavourful than beef burgers!  I added 1/3 cup of oats.  Also fastened 3 sheets of aluminum foil, liberally smeared olive oil on it before placing patties on.  Chilled the patties for 30 mins before grilling as directed.    FABULOUS!

Tasted like refried beans on a bun (probably not too surprising, in hindsight). I had no issues with them falling apart, though.

I can't get enough of these! I'm usually only cooking for myself so I made them one at a time and refrigerated the rest. Toward the end, there wasn't really enough for one more burger so I mixed in some leftover Spanish-style rice I had in the fridge. I wish I would've been using the rice the whole time! It really stretched the recipe and added some extra flavor. I'll be making this again and again. So easy to make and even easier on the wallet :)

Pretty good for the first time making these.  I did add extra bread crumbs and a little oatmeal for texture per other users advice.  I was surprised at the meatiness of the texture.  BBQ'd these with homemade honey wheat buns and avocado...Will definitely make again...will probably use more bbq sauce....yum.....

These are fantastic.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and they held to gether beautifully.  I served them on a hard roll with tomato, lettuce and chipotle mayonnaise...Delicious!

Delicious. I put avocado slices on top and that made them especially yummy. My meat loving boyfriend liked them more than regular burgers.  I also  added more bread crumbs like the others suggested, and I had no problem with them falling apart.

These are some mighty fine veggie burgers. I used red pepper instead of green because I like them better. I also added a bit of tomato paste for the taste and texture. Delicious with basil mayo, avocados and tomatoes. Who needs hamburgers!!!?

I used no salt added black beans and panko bread crumbs and oatmeal to cut down on the sodium.  I also added cilantro.  These are really good!

Delicious and spicy!  I used jalapeno cheese and honey bar-b-q sauce, which helped balance out the spiciness of the burger and make it more moist.  Quick and easy meal and i can't wait to try them on the grill!

This is one of the best recipes that I've made from this site!  I make a double batch, freeze them separately on a cookie sheet and then put the frozen patties in a ziploc bag so they are ready to go in the oven at any point.  The only change I make is to add frozen corn to the burgers.  These would be great with jack cheese and avocados on top!

I thought these were pretty good, but hubby didn't care for them at all. I mean, they don't taste like eating a 'real' burger, but they were definately good for something different. I dried everything REALLY well and used 3/4 cup breadcrumbs and had no problems with them being too soft or breaking. I may make these again when hubby isn't around, lol! Thanks for sharing. :)

My wife and I were not big fans.  They formed really well.  But wasn't crazy about the soft texture of the beans.  Personally I prefer the Morningstar Farms Veggie Pattie (not Grillers).  I really like their texture.  I didn't really like the taste either of these ones either.

These were great! I made them during a BBQ get together to have an non meat for myself and my veg friends. They were a hit. Even the non vegetarians were having a hard time resisting.  I made them just as directed except I didn't measure the bread crumbs. I just poured them in until I got the consistency I wanted. Then my bf stuck them on the grill. Wonderful recipe! Pleasant surprise.

The mixture tasted good but I ended up making bean and cheese burritos with them because they just crumbled apart.  I tried draining out the veggie mixture really well but they still crumbled.  I guess I'll use the other reviewers' recommended 2 eggs next time.

I had all the ingidents on hand one day few weeks ago, when we had one of our warmest spring days to make this. I liked the texture and consistency, as I made sure to follow some of prior comments, however found it to be little bit bland.

I really liked this.  I doubled the recipe and it was a hit at the picnic.  I did have to add about 1 cup of old fashioned oats (it really added to it) and about another 1/2 cup of bread crumbs (for a double recipe).  I still put some bread crumbs on my hands to make it easy to make patties.  I ate it with mayo, sliced tomato, red onion, shredded lettuce, and a slice of white american cheese :)

This was a great recipe!  Grilled on the bbq and used non-stick spray.  To make it truly vegan I used veggie stock instead of egg and they turned out great.  I also made some guacamole to top it off.  Yum!

Very good.  Since I used pasilla pepper instead of green, and they are harder, I sauteed it with the garlic and onion for a few min before mixing it into the beans.    Solid recipe!

These burgers were very tasty. I did add corn with the peppers, but besides that i didn't change a thing. I served these on toasted white bread and made a spicy sour crem and cilantro dressing. They were fantastic. I will definitly make again. =)

Delicious flavours --> however, unfortunately, the consistency of the burgers themselves were too moist and didn't stick together well to begin with.  I literally had them in the oven for a hour (while taking them out of the oven every twenty minutes to "remold" the patty).  Will make again though with some tweaks!

My boyfriend likes cheeseburgers, but I don't particularly care for red meat.  This was a GREAT compromise!  It felt like we were having burgers, but without the calories or food coma.  We both loved the taste and the recipe was super easy using a food processor.  We added cheddar cheese and condiments.  I will definitely make this again!

These ruled!  The only changes I made were that I added double the breadcrumbs (didn't want it to be like refried beans), I added pepperjack cheese (best decision ever) and dipped in chipotle mayo (just blended together a bit of mayo and a canned chipotle pepper). Oh, also I did use 2 eggs instead of one. I made sure to strain the onions and peppers as recommended.  These tasted amazing.  I loved them as did my boyfriend who had never had any sort of vegetarian burger.  These are FAR better than the burgers you can buy at a restaurant or in the grocery store.

I originally rated this recipe as only a 3 star....thinking that maybe I just didn't like bean burgers.  HOWEVER...I stuck 2 of the burgers in the fridge and my boyfriend decided to 'remake' them by slicing them up and tossing them on the griddle on a couple tortilla shells which he sprinkled with cheese.  Once melted he slapped them together and cut them up like a pie and we now enjoy them dipped in sour cream and salsa! (I still don't care for them as a burger but I think it is personal preference)

I was hoping for texture/flavor like a store bought but better.  It was like cooked bean dip on a bun.  OK but nothing like a burger.  Also was way way too garlicky...but maybe my garlic cloves were extra large? We may try these again but I doubt it. I gave it 2 instead of one  because my 4 year old loved them.  (but he wasn't expecting a "burger")

Good as written, but needs some tweaking to make Great.  I will probably try again and use some of the other reviewers' suggestions to try to bump this up another star or two.  I love that it's simple, homemade, vegetarian, preservative free, soy free, etc.  However, my biggest complaint is the texture - just crumbly if made as written.  I suppose the type of bread you use could have some bearing there - not sure - I used Dave's Killer Bread "Goodseed" which is nice and moist.  I did reduce the chili sauce to 1 teaspoon for my spice-wimpy tongue, and the cumin to 1 t. as I find cumin delicious but often too strong.  Thanks for a good start - I will likely try this one again, with some small changes, until I get it just the wait I like it.

This is great! My kids loved it. I substituted garlic salt for garlic and also  added Valentino Hot Sauce. Had to skimp on peppers. An extra ingredient I always put in my burgers is Worcestershire sauce.. Yummy.. Top that with guacamole, pico de gallo and shredded cheese on toasted bread.  Hey I'm from Texas.

My first successful try at veggie burgers, made with soaked and cooked dried black beans.  I made as directed, and baked them on a stone.  I was amazed to watch my carnivorous husband and a hungry miner down black bean burgers topped with cheddar cheese.

I never made, better yet I've never had a veggie burger, I'm a meat eater so I was hesitant about trying a veggie burger period. Well I came across this recipe read the revies and decided to try it since I had every thing in my pantry anyways....LOOOOOVE IT!!!

My husband was very nervous about this, but he liked it. He even took the leftovers for his lunch the next day even though he claims it killed his stomach. I did use less cumin like someone said and doubled the breadcrumbs and added corn. We will have this again. As far as the wetness others mentioned I just dabbed everything with a paper towel and took out a little bit of the egg white to cut down on liquid.

Was really good, I baked them.  Next time I will make thinner burgers they seemed to soft on the inside and perfect on the edge.  Also they were too spicy for my liking so i will add less cumin next time.  Very filling this recipe could easily make 6 burgers maybe more.  I will make this again.

Made this tonight, it was wonderful! Didn't make any changes to the recipe, and didn't have trouble with them falling apart.  The flavours were great, it had a bit of kick from the chili sauce, but also let the bean flavour come through, which was nice.  I will definitely be making these again!

These were fantastic! Made the recipe as written, with the exception that I had to add a little more bread crumbs to hold it together, but otherwise, very good. I think next time I will cut back the seasonings just a bit, because the flavors were very bold and overpowered the black beans. I topped it my favorite salsa... Mmmm. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Nice recipe - good flavour and easy to make.  I'm only giving it 3 stars because of the whole family's review of it.  Mixed reviews in our family .... my hubby and I both enjoyed them a lot....our eldest thought that if we added meat it would taste better (lol), our daughter said she only ate it cause she knew dessert was coming and our 3 year old turned up his nose at it completely.  On a plus note, my hubby and I had made a double batch of these and cooked up the rest of the burgers today and found that the flavours came through a lot more today than yesterday.

I used a yellow bell pepper, drizzled 1 tbsp olive oil, and used whole grain crackers-and blended everything in the food processor, but this recipe was completely inspirational. I am never buying veggie burgers from the store again! Thanks so much for such a great/easy recipe!

Awesome!  Like others, I found that the recipe needed two eggs.  But these burgers are so easy, fast and tasty!  My husband loved them, too.  We have plans to whip a big batch to freeze for quick week night meals.  Thank you!!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  It tastes just like the ones i buy at the store but the store bought ones are SO expensive!  I made this recipe as is and it came out perfect.  Only thing i would add would be if you bake them in the oven to spray them first with a little cooking spray.  I didnt the first time and they stuck to the pan a little.

These were really good and easy to make. I used Red Curry Paste because I didn't have any Thai Chili sauce and it was just fine.  I also cooked mine in the oven for the time suggested, then split the batch in half. One half I froze and the other half I cooked some more in a skillet because I like my burger to have a bit of crisp.

Absolutely delicious! These are so easy and quite cheap that I will never buy another veggie burger again.  I did get carried away chopping the onions, garlic and peppers in the food processor.  It caused excess water, but I just blotted it with papertowels and that seemed to work just fine.  I served them with cheddar cheese and a lime and jalapeno sour cream sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe!

It was VERY hard to get the bean mixture to the correct consistency.  Once I finally managed it, the flavor was great.

Despite taking advice of others and using more egg, mine were still not firm at all.  The flavor was also a little bit bland and, altho, I love cumin, the amount was just a little too much to put it over the edge and detract rather than add to the taste.  It's a great recipe to start with and tweak, tho.

Followed the recipe exactly except I added about 1/3 cup of corn.  It was FANTASTIC.  It was really fun to make to boot.  Didn't stick together as well as I was hoping (but not bad).  Will add at least 1/2 an egg extra next time. This recipe is going into heavy rotation.

LOVED THESE!!! Such amazing flavor!! The only change I made was to add 1 1/2 carrots instead of the green pepper because I didn't have any on hand. Otherwise, I made the recipe as written. I'll make these again and again. They were THAT good!

Made these burgers for myself and 2 year old daughter.  I loved them, and so did my daughter.  Put cheese on during the last 5 minutes.  Served with lettuce and tomato on a whole wheat slider buns.  Was great!

This is soo much better than the frozen burgers you find at the store.  I didn't use the hot sauce as stated in the recipe but I substituted cayenne pepper instead. As others have noted, it is important to dry the beans after rinsing and to strain the veggies.  I used rolled oats instead of breadcrumbs and my burgers held their shape beautifully.  Thanks!

I concur with 2 eggs; a little dry AND I put in 1/4 c. no salt sunflower seeds, which add protein, fiber and many minerals and vitamins (a little crunch too).

This is the most delicious bean burger recipe I've made. I thought making less lumpy burgers would help keep them together so I threw the bell pepper (I used red instead of green), onion, and garlic in a food processor and processed until it was the consistency of mashed potato. I added this to the mashed black beans, I then added canned corn and peas. I realized I was out of chili powder so I used 1/2 tbs paprika. I used Panko bread crumbs, adding 1/4 cup to the amount, and made sure to spray the cooking sheet with canola oil. I noticed the medium sized bean patties stayed together the best. Definitely a keeper! :)

These are great is you bake them but they fall apart if you try to do them in a frying pan like i just did.  I also think that these are even better with a cup of corn added (i used frozed).

Loved these! I took some of the other reviewers' advice and increased the amount of breadcrumbs and made sure to drain the pepper/onion/garlic combo before adding it to the mixture because it would have been too wet otherwise.

I needed to fry my burgers, they stuck to the pan and fell apart. Wasn't to excited about the taste either.

Yum!!!  I followed the recipe as stated (baked in the oven) but omitted the Thai chili sauce/hot sauce since I didn't have any on hand.  My result was delicious!  I got four jumbo burgers...very filling.

Followed recipe exactly. The burgers turned out spicy and bland at the same time. Perhaps my chili-powder is especially spicy, but they were definitely too spicy for me and i like spicy. They also needed more flavoring. If I make them again, i'll cut down on the chili and add some seasoned salt.

These were awesome! I would suggest adding some egg beater in place of the egg to keep it healthy. Be sure the beans are drained well. If it is not the right consistency, then I suggest putting it in the freezer for 30 minutes.This helped me form the patties.

I thought this was very good.  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, but took the added precaution of using a paper towel to soak up the excess moisture on the beans and green pepper mixture.  My patties stuck together and had a good consistency.  The only thing I would change next time?  I would halve the chili pepper.

The only problem I had was keeping them from falling apart.  I substituted oats instead of bread crumbs because I thought that would create a nicer texture.  I also added a couple spoons of flour to soak up some of the extra liquid from the beans. Try this recipe with grilled pineapple & a fresh avacado/mango salsa. Its delicious! Even my meat loving football playing brother couldn't stop eating them.  I may suggest adding a little more spice to the burgers though [If you like spicy foods, which I do]  Make these! They keep you full & satisfied

I love these burgers!  I use blackeye peas instead.  Even if i don't have all the ingredients, i use onion powder and garlic powder and still comes out great.  I always have to use more than 1/2 cup of bread crumbs but that's ok.

These are so good. I did my own seasoning mix and no hot sauce. I am very picky about spices and allergic to garlic. I did do 3/4 c bread crumbs as recommended by others.

We just couldn't handle the texture.  The flavor was great but when I served it my husband and I we're both unable to finish it.  Could be just our texture preference so if you're used to the texture of a bean burger then you'll love this, we really liked the taste.

These were great!  I doubled the recipe, baked the patties on a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper, and froze a batch of patties to use later.  I made the patties thinner than what the recipe calls for- ended up with 13 patties instead of 8- and I thought they were perfect.  I used red bell pepper rather than green and also added about a half-bunch of cilantro.  Yum, yum, yum! I will never buy veggie burgers from the store again- these are so much better!

Awesome!  Used less onion (cuz too much hurts my tummy), used red bell pepper, used 8 saltine crackers instead of bread crumbs, and made sure to strain the onion/pepper/garlic mixture.  Cooked 'em up on the stove and YUM!!

I thought the recipe as written had too much chili powder.  Next time I will decrease the chili powder.  I will increase the onion, green pepper and the garlic powder. I also added corn which I think is a good addition.  I think this is a good base recipe  that could be even better with some modifications.  I will try this agin.

These were really good for a "veggie" burger. A great alternative for meat. It worked great to drain the chopped veggies and to avoid them falling apart. I still prefer the meat over these, though.

YUM!  We made these a couple nights ago, taking the advice of a couple reviewers and draining the veggies / beans completely and adding 1 cup of bread crumbs instead.  They were delicious!  Topped them with guacamole but would next time top with avocado slices.  Thanks!!

I took the recipe and made meatballs for spaghetti. The southwestern taste added a different kick instead of the same old. I agree that you either need to dry the beans and strain the pepper/onion mix or at least double the breadcrumbs in the recipe. Either way it was delicious. Served it up on a bed of spaghetti squash for a healthy alternative.

Amazing! I did not have the runny dough problem other people have had, but I did dry my beans thoroughly, I also omitted garlic because I didn't have any. I baked mine and found they were crispy enough and did not require any type of pan frying. This will be my staple recipe for veggie burgers!

Amazing. I ate 2 and froze the rest, but they will not last long!! I squeezed the excess water out of the veggies, and grilled them in a bit of olive oil on each side so they were nice and coated with crispiness. DELICIOUS!

Followed this recipe exactly, and I have to say, I did not care for it.  I strained all the ingredients dry and it was still mushy on the inside.

Sooo easy, yummy and fulfilling!  I love the added bonus of freezing extras for later.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Delicious! I only made half a batch the first time, but I think I'll make another and freeze them to have on hand.  I halved the recipe exactly except I used a whole egg and they kept together really nicely.

These were pretty good. I added crushed wheat Town House crackers and a little more bread crumbs to make them thicker and easier to work with. I used 2 eggs. Next time i will flatten them out more so they are not so mushy in the middle.

these are awesome!! I didn't use bell peppers but a 1/2 can of corn. I drained and rinsed beans and corns well, and blotted them dry with a paper towel. I doubled the chili sauce, & added Cajun and cayenne pepper because I was out of chili powder. I froze them and made them that easy, about 8-10 on each side over a hot pan added a slice of Swiss cheese. Served over a toasted bun!!! They came out perfect!! Even my meat eater boyfriend loved them, will be making them again soon!!

These were awesome!  I didn't have any of the reported problems other reviewers had...my recipe yielded four good sized patties.  I was afraid the Thai chili sauce would lose it's kick, but it stayed with the burgers :)  I also added some dried cilantro for a little extra flavor.  I paired them up with the Arnold Multi-grain Sandwich Thins and some of the creole mayo on this site.  I will definitely make these again since they make such a healthy and filling lunch!

Yummy! A good recipe to modify to suit your own tastes. I omitted the garlic, green pepper and hot sauce and just used 1 onion and some corn. I was afraid of them being too bland so I added 1/4 tsp of salt. Instead of using boxed breadcrumbs, I put two slices of toasted bread in the blender and made my own. I also doubled the recipe and got 11 good-sized burgers out of it. Everyone loved these. I will not be buying many frozen ones from now on!!

LOVE IT! I, however, attempted this recipe without a food processor. Not a good idea. It ends up being kinda chunky and the texture wasn't right. My boyfriend said it was like "bird food" when he took a bite.  I'm going to try this again, but using a food processor. I really liked the taste, and they are SO cheap to make so it's great for us college students.

Followed recipie exactly....drained moisture from beans and veggies as suggested.  Baked on oiled cookie sheet 7 minutes each side and then tossed in fry pan to crisp them up. My husband loved them!  Question, would you freeze extra cooked or uncooked?

It amazed me how much these looked like real hamburgers.  I thought they tasted pretty good, a little bland, but good overall.  I would prefer mine to have a little chunkier texture though.  It almost seemed like I was just eating a giant mushy bean.

I was out of black beans, so I used black-eyed peas and found it very remeniscent of falafel.  Mine fell apart quite easily when I tried to flip them so I would add another egg next time.  I like the spice in these burgers, but my children wouldn't eat them.  My husband thought they were ok, but I am quite accustomed to the taste of veggie burgers and thought they were good.  My husband says he would rather the patties in a pita with tzatziki sauce and veggies.  Either way, we will use this recipe again.

The flavor of these were awesome. I added about 1/4 cup Hot Rotel tomatoes, strained. I also strained the onion, green pepper, garlic mixture to get all of the water out. I also added about 1/2 corn and a little bit of cilantro and doubled the bread crumbs. The texture was a mushy on the inside, I was hoping for more of a spongy texture I guess. I think maybe next time I might add some Stove Top Stuffing.

I really liked this.  My husband not as crazy at first -- too beany for him.  I think I could make the patties smaller and it'd be a more tolerable bean amount for him.

I know I've already reviewed this, but after I made some changes I wanted to review it again.  The first time I made these the garlic/pepper/onion mixture was overpowering to me.  So the next time omitted the green pepper and sauted the garlic and onion, in a little oil.  I didn't drain that mixture and texturally it turned out fine, but the taste was still too strong for me.  I will not make these again.

These were much better than expected.  I followed the recipe exactly except I only had Italian bread crumbs on hand but that didn't seem to matter.  I am not too keen on hot & spicy foods and I thought these might be too spicy but they really weren't.  Next time I will probably cut back on the cumin just a little since that is not one of my favorite spices.  I can't wait to try these again and try some other spice combinations.  My husband even thought they tasted good and he doesn't do veggie burgers!  Definitely worth making.

I loved these, and even my bf who is typically opposed to any type of veggie burger liked them.  They're easy and inexpensive to make, and while I did stick to the recipe, I'm pretty sure you can play around with it and still have it taste great.

Pretty good - kind of dry but that may be because I baked them. They were very good when you spooned on lots of salsa and sour cream though.

These are always superb.  I follow the recipe verbatim and they turn out perfect.  I found that the best method to preparing these is to bake them (for about 30mins as well); I've made them by frying in a pan, and throwing them on my George Foreman grill (I don't have a regular grill), both are which still good, but I like the baked version better.  And yes, make sure to squeeze the onions/pepper/garlic mixture in a mesh strainer and blot with paper towels to rid excess water, the mixture turns out nicer and holds together better.  A definite fav.

These are great!!!! Make it easier, mash beans with a potato masher, do not process them, they are too pasty. Use an indoor grill, and they are perfect! Great for getting your veggies, dieting, easy for work lunches. On a whole wheat english muffin, by themselves with some spaghetti sauce. Just cheap and delish,Hmm!

These are wonderful! Full of flavor and nutrition! Love the addition of hot sauce. It adds a little something without adding too much heat. I'm actually going to be making these again tonight. Delicious!

I've made these a few times and most of the time I follow the recipe. It's a good base and they turn out quite decent. Sometimes I have left over patties, so I'll crumble them back up and make burritos! So good. Thanks.

This is a great recipe. My husband is a major meat-eater and he still loves them. He actually requests these. We make it a little different. Instead of using hot sauce, we use Worchestershire sauce and it comes out fabulous. It was a little strong for me this time...but I'm pretty sure that's because my husband was "helping" me and added more sauce after I had already put extra in twice. lol. Anyway, these are amazing and good for you...definitely 5 stars!

very yummy-this is a good vegetarian staple & a great break from meat for the carnivore. It was a little spicy for me, but I think it would be fine for most folks.

Even my husband, who claims to dislike all kinds of veggie burgers, LOVES these. They are really good on a whole wheat bun with bbq sauce. I usually make at least a double recipe and freeze the individual patties.

These were fantastic. I made them exactly as directed and they were the consistency of a thick batter but formed nicely and after about 5-7 min per side on the grill they were perfect!

This was great recipe, I did not use the Thai chili/hot sauce since my  husband can't take food that's too hot.  So, I followed the ingredients exactly as the recipe and instead of baking it/grilling it I very very lightly fried it in x-tra virgin olive oil, very lightly only to coat it.    TIP: It is not salty so if you like more salt than just a hint of taste, either use a bit of salt or use feta cheese when you assemble your burger.

They taste great, but are really soft and kinda messy. Maybe more bread crumbs would help with that?

Very good!  I did as other posters suggested and got the onions, green peppers, garlic, and beans VERY dry before mixing.  I also only did 1 TSP. of cumin as 1 TBSP. just sounded like wwaayyy too much.  I decided to cook them in the cast iron skillet and that gave them a nice crust on the outside.  They were very delicious and I will no longer be buying the pre-made ones in the frozen section of the store.  Thanks for the recipe!

AWESOME! my boyfriend is opposed to veggie burgers but he loved these. I substituted corn for red bell peppers and added more hot sauce. If you freeze them first before you grill them, it stays together a lot better.

GREAT burgers!!!!!!! I have made these on several occasions, and everyone RAVES about this recipe. Since I didn't have chili sauce on hand, I just subbed mild picante sauce and it worked out great. As in other suggestions, I placed the patties in the freezer for about 20 minutes prior to cooking. This helped to keep them together while cooking with foil on the grill. A definite keeper!!! Thanks for sharing this GREAT recipe. I am now a hit with the veggie and health food crowd when I grill.

I made these for lunch today, and I they were great! I did add in some corn, it was a nice touch! Also, I had no breadcrumb so I used some organic cereal (it was basically the original chex mix but some other brand and all natural). My burgers did hold together, but were a bit crumbly! Next time I'll add in an extra egg and double the amount of bread crumbs. Also, I was surprised about how GINORMOUS the burgers were. Yummy!

So delicious!  We increase the amount of egg slightly and once it's all together, just add bread crumbs until it reaches the consistency that we want.

As good, cheaper and healthier than grocery store veggie burgers.  I made my own black beans instead of using canned.  Added eggs, and extra bread crumbs, and carefully squeezed excess water out of the veggies.  No problems with the burger staying together for me.

My whole family was excited to try them(besides my carnivore father who said they resembled 'burnt pieces of charcoal') and EVERYONE liked them once the tried it! Definitly double the egg and it is very important to get the beans drained and dried off. I will definitly make these again as they are much cheaper to make than the pre packaged Morningstar Spicy Black Bean Burgers we always get, and just as tasty, if not more so!

Ok, let me preface by saying that I doubled the recipe and then also used twice as many eggs and about twice as much breadcrumbs as well and this recipe made 8 GIGANTIC burgers. They were too big for the buns! I also used poblano peppers instead of green for a little extra kick. I'm giving these 3 stars because they were just "eh" to me. I feel like they definitely needed more spices, though I'm not exactly sure what. I also made them for the purpose of grilling on our Weber, but they were waaaaay too soft to flip without ruining, so we ended up doing them in a pan on the stove. I suppose if you wanted to you could always start them there and then transfer them once the egg firmed them up a bit.  They smelled delicious while mixing them, so I was sure they were going to blow everyone away (and the ratings led me to believe this as well), but honestly they fell a bit short of my expectations. They were also time consuming because I made my black beans from scratch, but I don't know that the payoff was worth it. I think next time I'll used canned beans and try using more veggies and twice the spices in the mix...   UPDATE: I had these again for dinner, and for some reason they were much tastier than I remembered this time. ??? I had frozen them and just did them in a skillet--didn't add anything--but I had to edit and give these another star. :) Still think they need to be spicier, but I whipped up some chipotle mayo which was fab with them.

These burgers were amazing! As a vegetarian they really come in handy and save me tons of money as well. As other reviews have said, they freeze well. This is not too difficult so I recommend this recipe for people just learning how to cook - like me! :)

I didn't think these tasted good.  And they looked strange.  I'll stick to the already made frozen burgers.

Very good black bean burgers! I made just as described and they turned out great. I quartered the recipe to make only 1 burger and man was it a whopper (no pun intended). It was huge, and I felt very full and satisfied. Served with a cup of hearty tomato soup.

I kept the ingredients the same, but changed up the method a little. I pureed the beans in the blender (MagicBullet, actually) with the eggs and finely chopped the onion and green pepper, and used garlic powder instead of fresh (about 1/2 teaspoon). I baked them in the oven as directed. My family -- including three picky kids and a picky husband -- LOVED them! My husband, who is a self-proclaimed veggie-burger-hater said they were better than beef. In fact, he heated up a leftover one tonight after having a "REAL" beef burger and said that the black bean burger was better BY FAR!!! I will absolutely use this recipe again and again! THANK YOU!!!

These were tasty, but a little dry. I think next time I will serve with lettuce, tomato, and sour cream. Maybe even some salsa.

These are fantastic!  I'm the only vegan in my house and I have been looking for a recipe for "burger night".  This is it.  I love it!  I put them in the freezer and even cook one now and again to crumble into a taco salad.  YUM!

YUM! I can't stand the taste of the processed veggie burgers found in the supermarket. These are out of this world. Froze the patties and took them camping. Cooked perfectly over the charcoal grill. Thank you!

Amazing!! I used a jalapeno instead of a bell pepper and used ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs.  Following the advice of another review, I also used two eggs and squuezed the liquid out of the processor mix.  Topped with sour cream ,cilantro and salsa, they were just wonderful!!

These are fantastic. Never made any type of black bean burger before and I am in love. They held together perfect, I took the advice of another reviewer and dried the beans, and strained the liquid from the onion/green pepper mixture best I could. I didn't have to freeze them. My only substitution/change was 3/4 tsp garlic powder in stead of fresh garlic. ps - and they really are superb with ancho chipotle ranch! (I used T. Marzetti's low fat version found in the produce section) Enjoy!

Wonderful! We baked them and added Heinz chili sauce on top where they were finished.  The garlic was a little strong so next time we'll probably saute' the garlic or chop it a little finer.  Still yummy, though!

I thought these were pretty good.  All the seasonings are pretty necessary, in the quantity given.  I used quick oats in addition to bread crumbs and didn't measure them--just added them until the consistency was right.  Good base recipe with lots of room for experimenting with spices.

They tasted pretty good but I couldn't get past the texture; my husband, who will eat almnost anything, took two bites and said he couldn't eat it.  I think if I try them again I will not mash them up too much, and maybe add something for some texture, since they were very mushy-feeling.

Really enjoyed these burgers on the grill... be sure to use enough oil on the foil to prevent sticking.  Light mayo and some Provolone and we had a great summer meal!

So delicious! I've never had black bean burgers before and I was so pleasantly surprised. The flavor reminded me a little of falafel (I think it's the cumin), but falafel is one of my favorite foods, so no complaints!

I didn't notice the other reviews that said to use 2 eggs, but I didn't quite have enough bread crumbs, so it worked out fine with just 1 egg.  I think I probably had 1/3 cup of bread crumbs, which meant that the burgers were still nice and moist and good. :)

I really enjoyed the flavor of these burgers, but they were a bit mushy.  I did remove the moisture from the beans, onions & pepper. I'm wondering, as another reviewer asked, if there is a way to make them less mushy? I'm wondering if I shouldn't have chopped/pureed the veggies so finely. I'd love to make these again.

I made these last night and think the recipe is a good base, but needs some additions.  I added jalapeno, cilantro and a little tofu to my mixture.  Even with the jalapeno, hot sauce and chili powder, the burger was still bland and not spicy.  I think it needs some salt and pepper because I can only taste dry beans and cumin.  I used a cilantro sauce on my bun instead of ketchup or mustard and that seemed to add some much needed flavor.  One of the reviews suggested quinoa and I think that would be a great idea.  Not a bad recipe, but you'll want to tweak it to your taste.

I was pleasantly surprised that these turned out so tasty. Even the rest of my meat-preferring family liked them! I followed the recipe carefully except I added more breadcrumbs as people suggested, and a bunch of fresh chives, and topped them with cheddar cheese and mayo. You'd think it'd be hot, but I didn't notice any heat. I used a plastic hamburger patty maker sprayed with cooking spray to keep it from sticking. I'm going to make a bunch to freeze.

I was excited to make these, but they were so dry and the cumin and chili powder were the only things I could really taste.  Next time I'll alter the seasoning and see what I can do to make the texture less dry and sandy.  A good base recipe, but needs some changes.

Yummy!  Pretty much followed directions except omitted spices.  A little to hot for little ones.  Put several in the freezer and reheat for a quick supper.  Delish!

This was fun and easy. I cut back on the spices and topped it with pepperjack cheese and a heaping spoon-full of salsa instead. It was good- gave me a little bit of a stomach ache, but I attribute that to "too many" beans all at once. Still- liked it a lot. I think if it hadn't been for the cheese and salsa it would have been pretty dry. Other minor notes: I used matzo meal instead of breadcrumbs b/c its what I had. Works just as well. I don't have a food processor but a good fine chopping was all mine needed- it held together just fine. I think the key to that is (as other reviewers have said) removing moisture from the beans. I did that by pressing the lid of the can down as hard as I could to let the juices come out before spooning them into the bowl for mashing. (if you do this make sure you washed the can beforehand).

I used thawed green peppers from the freezer and egg substitute in place of the egg.  I also use an ice cream scooper and scooped them directly onto a cookie sheet, topped them with plastic wrap and pressed down to flatten. Stuck the whole cookie sheet in the freezer and froze them before baking.  The smell was delicious as well as the flavor.  Baked them for about 15 minutes, flipped them and baked for another 15.  The only bummer was that a couple fell apart when I went to flip them.  Ate them with a little ketchup and some extra hot sauce. Will make again.

Hubbie and I enjoyed the flavor of these veggie burgers, but not the consistency.  They didn't fall apart (thanks to the tips of other reviewers!), but they were mushy.  I couldn't quite tell when I had actually bitten into it.  Any tips on how to achieve a better consistency?

just okay. I love black beans but this recipe was dry and bland. Just not a great veggie burger. maybe with all the reccomended tweaks these would be good?

A decent veggie burger. However I did make a few changes. I chopped up a green chili and added it with the onion pepper mixture, added 2 more garlic cloves, and a lot more hot sauce. I will also cut back on the bread crumbs next time because the flavor of them was a bit over powering.

These are great!  I'll never buy Morningstar (which I love) again!  I substituted 1/2 cup tvp (textured vegetable protein) reconstituted for the bread crumbs, drained the veggies, and added 1/4 cup ground flax seed to help hold them together.  Made 7 large patties.

These were very good, but I would make one change.  I thought the taste of the cumin was overpowering.  I would only use 1/2 a tablespoon next time.  Also, the patties were very large so if you wanted to, you could easily make 6 burgers out of this mixture.

Wow!!  Not that this recipe needs more rave reviews, but i had to post.  These were the best veggie burgers i've ever made.  I've tried making similar ones before and they always fell apart...these turned out amazing.  Took previous posters hints and dried beans thoroughly and removed as much liquid from the food processed onion/pepper mix as i could and i really think that helped.  Definetly will make again.  Thanks for the great recipe :)

Very delicious!  Always fun to try a new recipe out and immediately love it!  Didn't have any problems with them falling apart, just sticking to the pan slightly, which could be fixed with a bit more oil (I used quite sparingly).  We ate them like regular burgers with sliced tomato, onion, and pickle, dijon, mayo, and ketchup.  We will definitely be making these again soon.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were delicious and did not fall apart for me. I followed the directions almost entirely but replaced the bread crumbs with quick oats and a few crackers and added about 50% more than it calls for. I topped them with cilantro, avocado, some mayo, and cheese. So yummy.

Very tasty! Didn't have enough chili powder and no hot sauce, so I used ground red pepper. Made a double batch with half bread crumbs and half oatmeal, as suggested. Formed the pattys and froze about 15 min before baking. Froze the left over cooked pattys and reheated for taco salad. Delicious.

These were very good veggie burgers! Definitely better than the kind you get at the store. I added corn and a touch of brown sugar to mine. I used regular bread crumbs but also added some Ritz for flavor. Followed others advice and drained my veggies and beans thoroughly and also froze them before placing on the grill. Next time I will add rice to add more dimension, but will definitely make these again!!

Mmm! These are good! I made these for Father's Day (although veggie burgers aren't exactly a guy burger, come to think of it) and they turned out delicious. My mum especially liked them. Cut the amount of chili powder to 2/3 tbsp, but the amount of hot sauce was perfect. Also, if you've forgotten to strain the green pepper/onions like I did, you can add breadcrumbs (or crushed crackers of any sort) up to 1 1/4 cup instead of the 1/2 cup specified. Make sure you add enough so that the patty is able to hold its shape when rolled into a ball or flattened in the palm. Will definitely be making these again for a girls' night. Thanks!

these were great - my husband and i both loved them. i did make a couple changes. i used 2 cans of blackbeans and 1/2 can of sweet corn - i added the corn after mashing the beans. i also added some diced chiles instead of the green peppers because we like spicier food. i omitted the breadcrumbs and used oatmeal in its place. I also added a bit of fresh cilantro to the mix and served them on a bed of cabbage with a chipolte sauce. they were SOOO good -

These were easy to make and delicious. I made a few changes. 1)I used dried beans that I had soaked and cooked myself. I used 2 cups of beans. 2) I did not have a pepper on hand so I put in some matchstick carrots. 3) I added about a tsp of salt 4) To make them GLUTEN FREE for people with celiac I crushed up tortilla chips and used those in place of bread crumbs. THESE ROCK!!!!

Next time I will cut down on the cumin and chili powder for the kids, and really for me too.  They don't cook long enough for the flavors to become more than the taste of the powdered spices.  Maybe if they sat longer before cooking -- hmmm.

These are really quite flavorful.  I didn't have the Thai sauce so I used a few dashes of Tabasco sauce.  They're definitely hot and spicy but very tasty.

i have never made black bean burgers before and i made these last night. i always modify recipes a little bit, and this was no exception. i added some extra bread crumbs as the mixture was still a little too wet with only half a cup. also, instead of thai sauce, i used tabasco and i used two teaspoons. next time i'll definitely add some extra seasoning, but only because that's how i cook. it was delicious the way specified. had it on whole wheat buns with a slice of tomato, sour cream and some green chiles. can't wait to get home tonight for leftovers!!!

I love this recipe except I do a few different things. First I add 1 jalapeno and cilantro with the bell pepper and onion, instead of using hot sauce and instead of an egg I used egg beaters and instead of bread crumbs I used oats. I also add a little liquid smoke. Great recipe!

I didn't like it...  My Wife likes all of my cooking but our girls are also more discriminating.  It probably doesn't help that the girls and I take our burgers with cheese, mustard and pickles.  I doubled the recipe and made half like burgers.  I have frozen the other half and will try one of the other reviewers suggestions and use it as a burrito filling.  I will update the rating if that goes well.

Yum!!  I loved these and so did my husband.  I added some extra bread crumbs because they weren't forming well enough, but after that they were great.  I have made these multiple times since.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I loved these burgers. I used the suggestions that many of you provided by draining and drying the beans, pushing the liquid from the onions and peppers and the extra egg.  I made two changes, I added 1 cup of cooked brown rice to the mixture to give it a little more texture and substance and 2nd - Since I have a gluten free diet, I substituted corn chips (ground in the food processor) in place of the bread crumbs.  We are already thinking up some new combinations for this recipe to change it up a little. This is a definite keeper. These burgers are much better than anything you can find in the frozen food section and in most restaurants.

Hmmm... I tried to follow others' advice by squeezing out the extra juice from the onion/pepper mix and adding extra breadcrumb and freezing the patties.  But it was still really gloppy and hard to cook.  The taste was good, but I had issues with the texture.  The middle of the patty stayed pretty wet while the outside got really crispy on the grill.  Maybe I did something wrong.  I may try to cook the other patties in the oven instead with some foil over it.

These were straightforward to make but pretty bland. I thought with all the spices they would have a kick but no. Maybe they need some salt? Worth playing with the recipe... might make again.

These are absolutely fantastic.  Next time I will squeeze more of the juice out of the peppers/onions and the black bean mash.  Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.  These will definitely become a staple for my diet.  I think I will follow another review's suggestion and make a batch of these to freeze.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I didn't have green peppers so I used grated carrot instead.  I'll definitely make these again and I'll just use whatever veggies I have on hand.  I made the patties and then refrigerated them for 1/2 an hour and that made them even more solid.  I baked them and had no issues with them falling apart.  Great recipe!

This was my fist attempt at making veggie burgers, and these were excellent! I always read the other reviews before making something, and i made sure my beans were rinsed and dried them on a paper towel, also removed most of the liquids from the onion,pepper,and garlic mixture. I doubled the recipe so i used 1 egg and 2 egg whites. Also sprinkled in a little corn. Popped them on the good 'ole George Forman Grill and we were good to go! I thought they were WAY better than the storebrands pre-made patty's!! Very good, thanks for the recipe!

If you like black beans then you'll love these burgers.  My only complaint is that they don't stick together very well.  I even added an extra egg and chilled them in the fridge for a few hours before grilling.  Next time I'll stick them in the freezer.

These veggie burgers were great! I had never made any before since I thought they were a lot of work but this recipe proved me wrong! I threw the veggies in a mini chopper to make them small and mashed the beans with the potato masher. It was easy and the burgers stayed fairly well together. They also froze easily after I individually wrapped them in plastic wrap. Next time I would break them into 6 portions since each burger was so large with 4.

I was very skeptical in making these. I did cut back on the spices. Only used 1 t of cumin and chili powder and it was plenty. Made 6, we like a thinner burger but on a roll, with lettuce, tomato and onion....couldn't tell much of a difference. Nice low calorie option.

I will add some more spices next time because I personally enjoy spicy food and I did adjust the amount of bread crumbs to make the burgers hold better. Otherwise it was great!

These were really good, however we all agreed, if you make 4 patties they are too thick and over powering. This amount should make at least 6. Smaller patties the next day were far better.   We'll probably alter the spice eliminating the cumin and replacing it with something else. My son said it tasted too much like chili. My husband thought the "earthy" flavor of cumin didn't match the concept of "burger".   The patties stored well for later use, so this is a nice quick, easy patty to make and keep on hand for fast dinners or lunches.

Thanks for the recipe. In recent months I have had a hard time finding the store bought frozen version at my local supermarket. I delightfully found your recipe. It is even better as others stated. We now no longer have to search or over pay for a healthy veggie black bean burger! One can also change veggies based on what is on hand thanks

I just made these "burgers" and I AM IN LOVE! I drained all the water from the veggies and beans, as suggested, and it turned out perfectly.  I will be making these a staple in our dinner rotation.  Thank you!!

I was very unimpressed with these burgers. My main complaint is that they are just too mushy. I made the patties in the morning, froze them, then let them thaw for 4hrs or so in the fridge before I cooked them for dinner. Due to their consistency, I would definitely recommend baking them because that limits contact with the fragile patties. Nevertheless, they were still too mushy. Also, I would suggest roasting the garlic. The raw and bitter flavor of the garlic is quite noticeable since the burgers are essentially heated up, not cooked. I would like to attribute the poignant and unpleasant 'zest' of the burgers to the raw garlic, but without repeating it could have something to do with the spice combo as well.

This recipe is DELICIOUS! I always buy veggie burgers at the grocery store and agree that I won't do it again.  I followed a member's advice and made some chipotle mayo (with greek yogurt and a little ranch).  Will try next time smashing down to be much thinner and to cook longer so they are crunchy in the bun!

This is a good, easy, and inexpensive recipe. I put the onions and beans together in the food processor (I didn't have a pepper). The spices seasoned the burgers well. I baked them and after I flipped them I put cheddar slices on top to melt. Will make again.

I really like these burgers. They are a little dry for my families tastes so it is more a recipe for me to have for lunch. If you want to try something: put some basic coleslaw ( shredded carrots and cabbage with mayo) on the patty. The sweet, cool flavor of the coleslaw and the spicy, warm flavors mix well for me. Try it and see for yourself.

Very good! My secret is chipotle peppers (for smoky flavor and heat) and cooking them on a panini press. I doubled the recipe exactly (using red bell pepper) rinsing and drying as suggested, and added 2 fresh jalapenos and about 5 chipotle in adobo to the food processor. I also used 1 extra egg (3 in total), 1/2 cup cooked quinoa (or rice), salt, and 2/3 cup thawed corn. I cooked them on my Cuisinart Griddler (George Foreman-type grill thing), which pressed them together and browned them nicely. It made 12 spicy burgers which I will freeze. So nice not to drop so much cash on Morningstar Farms!

This was very good, but I think that the peppers you add should be roasted first with olive oil, salt, and pepper, then once cooled, pulsed in the food processor.  You need to drain the beans and wash them. Also, what was this recipe missing? Corn!!!! I still liked it a lot though.

Very good burger. I doubled the recipe, used whole wheat Ritz crackers as someone suggested and rinsed and drained beans. After mixing I refrigerated for couple hours and they were fine to form and did not fall apart at all. I did add more crumbs at least double what it called for. I think it would be good to change the spices around to change the flavor if you made them often. A very good base though.

I thought these would be really good based on the other reviews, but I wasn't a big fan.  I've been a vegetarian for 8 years now, and I thought this recipe would be delish, but I was disappointed.  I just don't think the spices meshed well together... I don't know... something was just kind of off with the flavors.  I think I will try these again but use different spices.

These were fun to make, not too laborious, flexible in terms of ingredient swops, cheap, and also particularly great for vegetarians that are mindful of protein intake (considering the beans, egg (up-ed it to 2 as someone recommended) and sliced cheese which is yummy melted atop the patties).  I also rinsed the beans and let them drain overnight to dry out - saves that extra drying step, plus paper towels.  To be fair, I didn't have the same spices on hand so I made some changes - substituted crushed red peppers for the chili powder and added some curry powder and onion salt as well - it still all came out well.  I also used Panko for the bread crumbs, which worked fine.  My veggie bf really liked these burgers, so we decided our next weekend activity will be mass-producing a stash of these for the freezer for future quick-and-nutritious dinners.  Thanks for uploading!

WOW! These are wonderful! This is a new staple in my recipe box! I have food allergies and have to be careful with a lot of healthy premade veggie burgers, so I was so excited to try this recipe! I did follow some other suggestions and added a generous amount of breadcrumbs but that was all I changed. This was a quick easy healthy and popular dinner. What more can I say!

Delicious. Only modifications I used were jalapeños (a couple of forkfuls) instead of the bell peppers which I didn't have, and 8 mins on a George Foreman Grill instead of a real grill or the oven. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Really good! So excited I don't have to buy those overpriced frozen veggie burgers any more. Thanks for saving me money on my grocery bill :)

I made this recipe last night and doubled it, and used three eggs.  I used red peppers instead of green, and they turned out very tasty!  I would cut the cumin down to 1 tbs. next time, though.  It seemed to overpower all of the other flavors going on.  I think I will also add some corn whe I make these again.  Overall, a nice, healthy recipe.

Excellent recipe the only thing that I added was mushrooms. This recipe was easy to make, and it also had a great after taste.

This would have been a 5 star dish if the texture was more substantial. I've tried some of the suggestions in the reviews but I can't seem to firm it up. The flavor is outstanding & I will continue to use the recipe. My favorite way to eat these burgers: a double-decker stacked with cheese inside of a toasted onion bun.

These were super good! My husband, the self-proclaimed meat-atarian, even fought to take the leftovers to work for lunch the next day. I subbed red for green pepper in these, next time I'd like to try it with corn added as well. We made these burgers to go with the Tomato, Corn, and Avocado Salsa from this site for our weekly "LOST" viewing party.

I made this once and decided to make some more, but instead of doing patties, I changed the seasoning and used it like regular ground beef to add to spaghetti, and other things. It worked great! My husband remarked on how much it looked like, and had the texture of real meat.

I have a small cafe and these babies are going on my menu! They freeze and reheat well. I did add some Chipotle salsa, and followed some suggestions to increase the egg to 2 and subbed oats for the bread crumbs. (I processed 1/2 the oats to a coarse powder) I baked them at 350, then cooled them and froze them. Microwaved to reheat, served on wholewheat flatbread with ranch dressing, red onion, lettuce and tomato. My customers are raving over them!

My family loved this!!! I read other reviews and used their tips.  I added 1/2 can of corn w/ the veggies & used 1 cup of whole wheat ritz cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs (1/2 cup - the mix was too runny).  I will be making this again - YUMMO!!!

Outstanding hubby loved them. I thought they were great but a little too much cumin. I will cut the cumin in half add some corn too next time. Don't forget to make some chipotle pepper mayo (mayo, ranch dressing and chipotle peppers) like another reviewer mention. It really complimented the burger and made it taste even better

mashed beans on a bun. We had to pile on the lettuce to overcome the texture. This is not a good replacement for those accustomed to beef hamburgers. It looked great, but that is where the resemblance ends. If you are not already a bean burgur lover, I suggest having a back-up.

Just ok. Like eating a bean burrito on a bun. Needs some more texture. Another reviewer said she added brown rice I think it definately needs it. The idea of some corn mixed in would help too.  Family of 6 says its just ok.

I thought that these burgers were truly delicious!  I've been a vegetarian for a little over a year now and have been trying to find new recipes all of the time.    I found this one and made them last night and they were great.   I thought I was eating an actual hamburger; I couldn't believe it was vegetarian.  My husband is a meat eater and he thought these were just as good as a regular hamburger as well, with better flavor.  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly the same, just didn't use quite as much hot sauce (My husband doesn't like hot sauce)  and they held together perfectly.  I would recomend these to everyone, they're delicious and simple to make.

These burgers were so delicious.  After I mixed all the ingredients, I did try some cold on a tortilla cracker and I could totally see how you could use this as a dip at parties.  I only had dry black beans, so it was a bit more time consuming (took over 2 hours doing the 'quick soak' to cook just the beans).  Other than that, the only changes I made to the recipe is crunching up Garlic Club Crackers (I think it's a new flavor) to replace the bread crumbs.  This brought a little extra flavor, without making it any more unhealthy really.

Absolutely delicious!  I made these exactly as written, and they turned out perfectly.  My husband and toddlers devoured these, so next time I’ll double the recipe.  The burgers were the perfect consistency, and they stayed together nicely (not crumbly or mushy as other described).  Yum!

I really loved these. Very flavorful, and  you walk away just feeling good and energized, not stuffed and immobile. I didn't have a food processor so I just chopped the onion and pepper as fine as I could. I baked them, vs. grilling, and they still came out nice. I didn't alter the recipe at all, but am thinking that adding a little ground turkey in with these would be great. Perhaps 1/2 the amount of beans, and 1/2 turkey. I'll try that next.

These were very good.  I had no trouble getting the patties to stick together.  I was expecting a more spicy flavor given the amount of chili powder added and given the fact that I accidently added more hot sauce than the recipe called for.  So next time I try this I will probably up the spices.

Good...but they crumbled.  I used 1/2c oats and kidney beans instead of black b/c that's all I had.  I rinsed and dried the beans and put the pepper/onion mix in some cheese cloth and squeezed the excess water out.  I put the patties in the freezer to firm up.  I started out baking them but they started to crumble when I tried to flip them after 10 min so I moved them to a fry pan with some olive oil.  That didn't help they still crumbled.  So what I did was crumble up the rest of it and put slices of cheese over the mixture and cover until the cheese melted.  The melted cheese held the crumbles together so I was able to transfer something resembling a buger onto the bun.  What we didn't eat on a bun, we put on top of some tortilla chips and cheese, it was fantastic.  I will try this recipe again with black beans and an extra egg for a burger, but I'll probably even make it again as a topping for nachos.  The crumbly bean mixture was an excellent topping.

Good for being so healthy, but they were very bland.  We used a lot of hot sauce to spice them up, which helped.  I might have used too many bread crumbs after reading the other ratings/comments that suggested more.  I would suggest more spices or hot sauce than the recipe called for.

So fast and easy. Instead of using bread crumbs, I used Fiber One cereal that I ground up in the blender. I'm just so amazed at how cheap you can make veggie burgers versus what you would pay in the grocery store. So thanks for the recipe and saving us money!

I loved these!!  Added more breadcrumbs and drained ingredients well and had no issue with falling apart.  Also I freezed some and used the next couple days. Hubby liked them too, definitely will make again :)

Absolutely the best! No more packaged frozen veggie burgers ever! I substituted a few things. I used 2 pieces of chopped toast for bread crumbs, western style frozen veggies(about a cup or so, eyeball it) instead of peppers and onions, and instead of thai chili sauce/hot sauce I used a poblano pepper & black berry jam. The only problem I had was keeping the burgers together, maybe more egg & bread next time. (Updated 7/13/09) I use different variations from the veggies. The other day I used wild rice,onion and carrots. Still just as good.

I followed the advice of another reviewer and used two eggs instead of one. I also used rolled oats instead of bread crumbs. I put the onion and pepper in my food processor, and then added the beans. I drained the chopped onion and pepper to make the mixture less watery. Mine didn't fall apart at all. Cooked on my electric griddle about 10 minutes per side. I won't be buying frozen black bean burgers at the store any more-- these are super easy and taste great!

A delicious way to add more legumes to the diet. We liked them best with salsa and cheese and chips, but they where still good eats burger style on bread.

These are delicious and easy to make!  Also, check out the detailed nutrition on this recipe - these are just full of vitamins and minerals.  I made a bunch and now take them to work every day for lunch - they reheat just fine in the microwave. By the way, I just blended everything together in a food processor and it worked great.

5 stars for taste, 0 for cohesion!  I had the awfulest time trying to keep them in one piece, but it was worth it because they taste AMAZING!  I even dried the beans, strained the vegetables and used more bread crumbs like one of the reviews suggested, but still had problems with them sticking together.

These were so delicious...even my carnivore husband loved them. I took some of the other reviews suggestions - I doubled the breadcrumbs, strained the water from the onion/pepper mixture and added some corn. Yum! I will be making these again very soon.

As far as the seasoning and veggies involved goes, this recipe is GREAT.  I used red and yellow bell peppers and added some fresh cilantro I had lying around, and these taste delicious.  THE PROBLEM WAS that they were way too dry.  Next time I'm going to try leaving out the egg (in order for them to be vegetarian and vegan) and I'm going to add some olive oil and ketchup to moisten these things up. I made a double batch and froze mine (individually wrapped) and that worked out great.  I can through a frozen one on my GOFO grill and it still tastes super fresh.

I thought these were pretty good. And Most of my family did as well. I rinsed and drained the beans very well and after chopping the onion and green pepper in the food processor I drained the juice from those real well as well I didn't change the egg or the bread crumbs but by drying out the beans and onions and peppers they held together just fine.

I really liked these, I drained a lttle water out of the onion/pepper mix, added an extra 1/4cup of bread crumbs and froze them for about a half hour before pan frying them.  The end result was just a little too soft, maybe throwing them under the broiler they would have crisped up a little.  I also threw a slice of pepperjack on them...tasty!

These were pretty tasty after a few adustments to seasoning.  I thought that they seemed a little blah so ended up adding garlic powder in addition to the cloves.  Once they had a little more kick to them they were awesome.  Would take one of these over a real burger any day.  I couldn't pass them off on my kids but my husband and I really enjoyed them.

Great recipe - these were really good, and not dry at all (the way some veggie burgers can be)! I used the tips of rinsing and drying the black beans, but I actually ended up using the ordered amount of bread crumbs and it turned out wonderfully.  We've topped them with sour cream and chives or pepper jack cheese - both are really tasty!

We enjoyed this, but did not use the amounts of spices called for!  I cut the chili powder and the cumin both down to 1 tsp.  For the chili paste, I let everybody put on their own amount.  I also cooked up dried black beans, so used 2 cups.

this recipe was easy to follow and did take advice from others...squeeze ecess moisture from veggies and beans.  next time I'll add cooked rice and more veggies like peas, corn etc. I dressed the burger with chipotle mayo, avocado and tomato. delicious!

I guess it's just a matter of preference, but we didn't enjoy these at all. I love all of the ingredients, but in this combination, I did not like the taste.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I have had veggie burgers at restaurants before and enjoyed them much more.  Something about the spice mix seemed off to me.  I formed them in  a 1/3 cup measure, froze them, then cooked them on the Foreman grill.  They stuck to the grill a bit, but mostly held together.  I probably won't attempt this again.  Thanks, anyway!

These were OK, but I've had better.  I was handicapped because I didn't have a food processor.  I had to hand mince the onion and pepper.  I couldn't possibly get them chopped fine enough.  LP didn't like them much.  I don't think he like the concept.

LOVE IT! Can eat just like a regular burger.  The only things I do differently is dice the pepper and onion and use 3/4 cup bread crumbs.  I usually serve it with a baby leaf spinach salad.

I made these burgers for a Christmas party so my sister would have a vegetarian option. She loved them and, shocker of all shockers, so did my husband and daughter (they don't even LIKE black beans!). I followed other users' suggestions about doubling the eggs in the recipe and had no issues with the burgers falling apart. I also used half the amount of chili powder and tobasco sauce. When I did a 'test burger' right after mixing things up, I wasn't sure if it would be hot enough but after the uncooked patties sat overnight in the fridge they had plenty of heat and I was glad I didn't add in the rest of the spice. Fried them up on a non-stick griddle and they were fabulous! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is one of my favorite recipes - so easy, delicious, and healthy.  I am allergic to the additives in store-bought veggie burgers and this is a great alternative.  Even my meat-loving husband likes them.  I do add extra bread crumbs, about two slices of toasted bread processed in the food processor.  Drying the beans and the vegetables does help everything stay together, as well.  I process everything - the bread, vegetables, and beans and my food processor, which gives the burgers the best texture and makes the recipe so quick and easy.  Try it, you will love it!

This recipe didn't go over so well with the family.  I doubled the recipe and the consistency didn't come out quite as I would have liked.  I added two eggs and a 1/2 cup of bread crumbs.  The taste wasn't bad and I can see this recipe being used in my house as a pretty good bean dip.  Most of my family said the consistency wasn't what the expected for a "burger".  I have to agree with them, although I did eat mine!

Great Recipe- I used 6 tablespoons of tomato paste instead of the egg(s).  Makes it healthier for those watching their cholesterol like myself.  My family liked it and they have never had a veggie burger before.

AWSOME!!!  Such a good, inexpensive meal!  I did not have a problem with them sticking together, I used the suggestion of using olive oil on my hands, great idea!  I will make them and freeze for lunch!

Very tasty, though we've made this three times and still can't seem to stop them from falling apart! We love the spicy flavor and they sure beat store-bought burgers in both flavor and cost. We'll keep trying...

We were very attracted to the healthy appeal of this recipe, but we didn't like these.  They were very bland and had the consistency of mashed potatoes even after baking.  Maybe because I used cornflake crumbs instead of bread crumbs?  The flavor alone wasn't enough to try the recipe again with bread crumbs.

These are amazing. Just like you'd get at a restaurant but sooo much cheaper. The recipe makes a lot, so you can always freeze until later.

These were good but I think they would be better if divided into 6 instead of 4.  They were very large and hung over the bun causing them to fall apart a bit.  I melted swiss cheese on the top.

Very good.  I upped the egg and bread crumbs, put it all thru the food processor and baked it.  I only got three good sized pattys, which was fine.  Served w/salsa and melted cheese.

I've made this several times and everyone has loved it. Sometimes I use cracker instead of bread crumbs.  Either way I use a little extra.  It's especially good served with a topping of sour cream and a fresh (but atore bought)salsa.

I thought the patty was pretty dry once it was cooked.  I'd add more onion and pepper as they'd increase the moisture level.  Overall, I thought these were good, just dry.

I used frozen peppers, minced garlic from a jar and dried onions (all my favorite time savers) and simply skipped the sauteing step.  I prefer to simply mash the beans with a fork, as I like that texture better than pureed.  I will use less cumin next time and add some of Trader Joes' roasted corn.  I love, love, love this recipe.  As a new vegetarian, it is comfort food with out the other issues.

I am so happy with these veggie burgers. They are better than anything I've ever bought...and I've bought a ton of em'. Being short on time, I made 12 servings and froze the rest.  I topped them with a piece of nice sharp cheddar cheese, tomato, lettuce, dijon mustard, and ketchup. Fantastic!

First try at making black bean burgers and they turned out great.  Even got husband's full approval!  I took the advice of the other reviews and froze the patties before baking them and they held together great.

Very good, I doubled up on the bread crumbs, and I am glad that I did as I am sure they would have broken apart had I not.

I had to make a few changes, my mother lives with wife and I, she is 93 and sometimes cannot tolerate a lot of spice. So I put in 1tsp smoked paprika, just a dash of chili powder, I also sauteed the veggies with cilantro, then mixed everything in the food processor. Remember keep everything dry! Great recipe

These turned out well, although I did take some tips from other reviewers and used rolled oats instead of bread crumbs and used twice as much as called for. They still fell apart a little bit after baking, but not too bad. I think a tablespoon of cumin is too much. I'd cut that in half next time and maybe lay off the spicy stuff a little bit, but that's just me. I'll definately make this again with adjustments. Thanks for an easy, great recipe!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and got as much moisture out of the onions and peppers as possible, and rinsed the beans. I don't have a food processor but chopping by hand worked just fine.
My only issue with these is that they're a bit dry, but by topping with salsa and fat-free sour cream you can counteract that.

These were really good!  Nice to have a fresh veggie burger alternative.  Despite draining the beans and onion/bell pepper/garlic mix, I did need to up the bread crumb content a little, but that's easy to adjust as needed.  I added some fresh corn; thinking about adding chopped mushrooms next time.  Spice mix was perfect.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Yes, this is a keeper.  I will be making it again.  The only reason it's not a 5 star is because it lacks the moist, juicy fatty grease a real burger would release into your mouth.  I will be searching for a method to accomplish this while still keeping it healthy and vegetarian.  And when it happens...watch out.

wow! These are way better than what you get in a store. I agree with freezing them first, then grilling... or just be careful when flipping. Either way, these are yummy. I like the way they the edges crisp up on the grill... similar to the way a burger does. I plan to use this recipe to make stuffed green peppers tonight. see taseteslikefood.com for pics.

As a single gal in the city, I'm always looking for cheap and healthy eats I can pack for lunch, and this was perfect!  I used Ritz for breadcrumbs and red pepper instead of green.  I went a little crazy looking for the "perfect" condiment and even bought a revolting bottle of key lime mustard... before realizing that these are just delicious with ketchup!  I think the entire recipe, which I doubled, only cost me four dollars!!

This is now one of my favorite recipes. The flavor is just great! I used Franks hot sauce. When I chopped the green pepper, onion and garlic in my food processor, it get very runny, so I squeezed it out before adding to the beans. Mmmm!

I am only giving this 3 stars because of the texture.  No matter how many breadcrumbs I added, the burgers would just fall apart after cooking.  The flavor was ok, but they turned into a pile of mush.  I will try this again, but I will be making many alterations.

These turned out very well! I didn't use the Thai sauce as I didn't have any, and used extra bread crumbs to help them hold together since we were grilling them.

Very Yummy!!

My wife and I thought this was a fantastic recipe.  We are both heavily carnivorous and were really pleased with the turn out.  And for as inexpensive as they are, this can be a regular meal.  Thanks for sharing this one.

These were pretty good. We are not vegetarians, but have been trying to eat more meatless meals. We liked them best done-up like a regular burger-ketchup, mustard, pickles, and so on.

This is only my second attempt at making a homemade bean burger and it came out very tasty.  I added more veggies and used vegan egg replacer instead of the egg.  They were a little on the soft side but still held together really well and tasted fantastic.

Great veggie burger!  I actually added 1/2 cup brown rice to the mixture and that may have helped keep it together.

I like Mexican flavors, so I was hoping these would be fabulous... they were ok... I should have used only half the hot sauce because they did have a bite to them... my kids don't usually mind spicy but these were too much so for them.

These are delicious!! I used Sirachi for the hot sauce and all I had was Italian breadcrumbs, but I couldn't taste the herbs over the chili, cumin & garlic.  Super easy and much better than a plain old Boca burger!

Ummm...good! This recipe was delicious! Thanks everybody for your suggestions on how to keep them from being too runny and sticking. I did the drain, rinse and pat dry method. Along with 2 egg yolks, more bread crumbs,placing it in the refrigerator for a few hours and spraying the inside and bottom of the measuring cup. I had no problems with the mixture falling apart. The patties came out beautifully!! Again DELICIOUS!!!

Super easy to make and the flavor is great!  My patties didn't stay together well but I think it is because I didn't drain the pepper/onion mixture after processing.  I used 1/2 tbsp of chipolte powder instead of chili powder.  It came out a little spicier but I liked it.

These were excellent, although I did something wrong and they were kind of runny. I ended up using them for burrito filling as suggested by someone here and it was excellent.

Delicious!  This was such an easy recipe and great because they can be frozen and eaten later.  Helpful if you're cooking for one.  I added a little more bread crumbs to make it stick more, because I didn't dry the pepper and onion and it made it a little runny. My mistake!  Turned out delicious though!!

My husband loves these!  I am excited to have an better option than the frozen ones I used to buy at the store.  I squeezed/drained some of the liquid from the onion and pepper mixture and also dried the beans off a little and it came out perfectly!  They stuck together just right!

My Hubby's favorite! Great texture and flavor, in need of no adjustments. To deal with the stickiness of the mixture, simply spray a 1/2 cup measure with non-stick spray, spoon the mixture in, and slide it out onto your cooking surface. You can spray the bottom of the cup and use it to flatten the mound to a burger shape. I ended up frying them because it was too hot in my kitchen to use the oven. Fry for about 5-7 min. per side, on medium heat. These will become a household regular for us!

Big sloppy mess. We even added extra bread crumbs in an attempt to hold it together. They still fell apart when cooking and after we finally managed to get them onto a bun, they tasted like mush sandwiches. Nothing resembling a "burger" of any kind. Pretty okay flavor, although I think the same thing could be achieved by simply using taco seasoning.

Made it with the previous suggestion of chipotles mayonnaise and dash of ranch dressing. Was out of bread crumbs so used 1/2 a cup of matzo meal.  Cooked in oven on cookie sheet.  They were a little bit spicy but my kids loved it.  They will want me to make it again.

Interesting...we did not enjoy eating the patties plain, but liked it very much with a bun and some provolone cheese.  I would make these again even though my 1 yr old did not like it.

These have very good taste. I did not use processor at all. Just mashed beans, added chopped onions, garlic and so on. I followed rec exactly in the amounts, just ommited peppers( cant eat them)and halved the amount of chilli and no hot sauce(do not care for hot food)I had no problems with crumbling. Cheap, easy, fast and delicious!

I just fixed this for dinner tonight- and they were AMAZING!! I sauteed the onions and peppers before I pureed them with the bean. We also made a sauce of lite sour cream and chipotle tabasco to go on the buns.

I think it might have been my pan- but these turned out really dry. Next time I'll make them thicker- and I bought better quality non-stick pans, so I'll be able to make them a lil better!

the burgers were awsome, but squishy in the center and hard on the outside, even when cooked on low heat. they were still good though and one of the best veggitarian burgers i ever made!
i would suggest not makeing them as thick as it says though

apart from running out of breadcrumbs before the mixture was firm and having to use corn flour to get it to the right consistency, I followed the directions, very very nice I will be making these again

These burgers are incredible.  Why have I been buying frozen veggie burgers for all these years?  This recipe is so simple and fast, it is now my go-to dinner on busy nights.  I made the recipe almost exact -- except I minced the veggies and mixed them in, instead of dirtying my food processor.  I served my burger with romano cheese and thai chili sauce, with a salad on the side.  Yum!

We love this recipe!  It has a great flavor and is so much better than what I used to purchase.  I basically follow this recipe but add grilled corn and an extra egg.  I then always put the patties in the freezer for a few hours before cooking.  I have never had a problem with these crumbling.  I now keep a few in the freezer for quick dinners--even my toddler loves these!

Really great recipe! I have never really liked the store bought veggie burgers, so I decided on a whim to try these when my parents wanted hamburgers for dinner. They were delicious; I will certainly make these again. I had to cook them a bit longer than what the directions said for the grill (12 minutes instead of 8 minutes) but that could just be because of my grill, not the recipe.

I was hesistant at first but I loved it!  I used 1/2c corn bread instead of the bread crumbs and used cayenne pepper in place of the chili powder.  Not a fan of bell peppers so I left that off.  It was delicious!

VERY good, it was a nice change from a regular hamburger.  Did as other suggested, rinsed and dried the beans and also drained the veggies after they were in the processor.  After combining the ingredients it seemed like it needed more bread crumbs, we added about 1/4c wild rice, that helped a lot.  My 10 and 8 year olds loved them, the 8 year old helped and used a potato masher for the beans...had some whole and some mashed beans.  Will be making this again!!!!! Thanks for the great recipe.

Great tasting but they need as least double the bread crumbs or maybe even more than that.  next time I will chill the the mixture before I make the patties.  I also cut back on the cumin a bit.  1T would have been too much.

Well... these burgers are healthy.  But they taste like beans and cumin on a bun (and I reduced the cumin by a teaspoon).  Maybe I should have expected that, but I didn't expect those flavors to be as strong as they were.  I ate my burger but I don't want more.  My husband wouldn't eat more after his first bite.  I didn't have problems with crumbling; I added bread crumbs until the mixture held together well.

So delicious, but it needed some modifications to make it perfect.  I add all ingredients (+ an extra 1/2 cup of bread crumbs) to the food processor, and grind it until it's like a paste.  Then I add two fresh tomatoes and pulse until those are chunky.  Then I add a bit of oil to the george foreman grill and cook them on there, one at a time.  I took the advice of another reviewer and make an avocado ranch sauce (using non-fat yogurt), and put a little of that on each, served on whole wheat rolls.
There really is no comparison to the frozen kind, these are SO delicious!

These tasted really good but they fell apart. I just mixed it with some rice and it was all good. I did use soaked, cooked black beans and not canned, maybe that was the difference and why they didn't stay together. Overall very tasty!

The taste was pretty good, though the burgers were a bit too soft and wanted to fall apart.  I'd suggest doubling the bread crumbs in the recipe and straining the onion/pepper mixture before adding it in to make them easier to work with.  I think whole corn kernels would add to the flavor, too.  I also felt the green pepper flavor was too strong - maybe use half the amount?

We really enjoyed these! The mixture made 4  good sized burgers. I thought all of the spices would make it too hot, but it didn't at all! I even added diced jalapeños to it. We put a half slice of provolone on half and cheddar on the other. I liked having mayo on it because the mixture can be a little dry. Pop in freezer while preheating the grill.

These are excellent!  I omitted the hot sauce, since I didn't have any, and I didn't bother with a food processor; I just chopped the onion and pepper up finely.  I added a dash or two of pepper and I put in a total of 3/4 c. of bread crumbs.  They formed up nicely and cooked just fine in the oven.  Delicious!

This was just not for us.  Waaay too much cumin.  The texture was excellent, though.

I made this tonight along with a garlic french fry recipe.  The entire dinner was great.  My boyfriend and I loved the veggie burgers.  I forgot to get the chili powder so I put a little extra of the thai sauce in.  Other than that I followed the recipe and it came out wonderful.  I baked the burgers, toasted some whole wheat buns and then topped the burgers with homemade guacamole, fresh tomato, shredded colby jack cheese and a little fresh onion.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.  :-)

I enjoyed these veggie burgers fresh from the frying pan and cold from the frig. I ate them ontop of a salad of romaine with sweet bell peppers, sweet onion and a simple lime dressing

I baked these becuase I was afraid they would fall apart on the grill.  Suprisingly easy to make.  Put on a bun with lettuce and light ranch dressing.  Very good!

These are great!  I swapped the green pepper for a red and I added 50% more bread crumbs to help it stick together.  I mixed everything in the food processor as many people suggested. I also doubled my batch and froze the rest.  I can't wait to get them out!

This is a very good basic/starter recipe for making your own black bean burgers.  The only thing I did a little diff is add some salt, make patties smaller (got 7 out of the batch), threw beans in processor instead of hand mashing, added extra bread crumbs so they would form up better, and I pan cooked them with a little olive oil.  They came out very nice.  Next time I make a black bean burger I intend to add some basmati rice, and maybe use some oats like a prev. reviewer recommends.

I would recommend these burgers if eaten with a bun and toppings/condiments.  Eaten alone, they need some tweaking.

These were okay.  As the recipe is, they come out a little bland.  I usually double the recipe, shape half of it into patties, and freeze them.  One thing this recipe desperately needed was SALT.  I also add a small can of corn, double the hot sauce, and add 1/4c-1/2c of spicy salsa.

These were ok.  My friends and I are trying to eat healthier, so we thought we'd try 'em out.  There was something off about the taste..... maybe it was the cumin?  Maybe it was because it was too bland?  We don't know... my one friend didn't finish his burger... another friend and I piled on mustard and ketchup to make up for the blandness/cover up the off taste.  It was really crumbly, too... I wish I read the other reviews first about adding one more egg.  Oh well; I believe this recipe still has potential.  I'm going to try again, but use this as a base... I'll add my own spices and twists to it.  Thanks anyway!

This was a good recipe but not excellent but I will be making it again.  It made 6 patties for me.  I followed the other users advice, I reduced the cumin to 1 teaspon, I did not have pepper so I used one finely chopped carotte and I froze the patties, I also added an extra egg and they did not crumble. In addition I topped them barbecue sauce.  I froze the rest of the patties as well for another meal.

These tasted great but the consistency was a little off (they were too mushy, possibly because I cooked them in the oven).  I substituted a fresh chopped jalapeno for the cumin and chili powder, as was recommended by a previous reviewer, and I thought the mingling of tastes was excellent.  These are so filling!  I will definitely make these again, but I will probably grill them next time in order to make them a little crispier.

I doubled the recipe and while they didnt crumble like other siad it did, I found the flavour to be very bitter, probably too much cumin. I dont think that I will make them again. My son refused to eat them.

they were tasty. i didn't use all the chili powder nor sauce, and they tasted fine. i think it depends on what type of chili sauce you use. i used 2 eggs which did give the moisture. however, they didn't hold together at all. my burgers turned out more like mush.  maybe its because i used brown rice instead of bread crumbs. i think bread crumbs would help absorb some liquid and hold the burgers better.  also, i think this recipe would make a very tasty dip if uncooked.

This was such a great meal!  So easy to put together, and it tasted great!  I went with a little mediteranian feel with some feta cheese, tomatoe, and cucumber on top of the black bean burger and it was fabulous!  This is definetly a keeper in my recipe box!!

This is a wonderful recipe. I didn't add any bell pepper because I didn't have any on hand. I made 6 slightly smaller burgers. We made them on the grill and they turned out great.

These were really great!  I made the recipe as directed except I added some chopped jalepenos to the mix a bigger kick.  For the last five minutes of their cooktime I put the broiler on and add some cheese to the top to be melted.  Will definitely make again!!

very good taste, but hard time getting them to stay together. next time i will cook them in the skillet. i also think that putting the veggies in the food processer really watered them down, so next time i will finely chop, and maybe add corn for some more color!

I love this recipe! I made them mainly for myself but my kids loved them and didnt know they were made of beans instead of meat! I will be making this over and over again. Next time I might add a tad more spice to it, I like spicy things.

These were great - I had to cook them for 10 minutes longer than the recipe stated, a lot of liquid came out of the onion when I chopped it in the food processor which made the mixture quite loose.  They tasted great though.

These were very good, but a little mushy.  I cooked them on the stove top in a skillet with a little olive oil.  I can not imagine putting them on the BBQ as they would likely fall apart.  I froze the extra two (recipe makes four, we are two) so we'll see how that works.

Good recipe.  I didn't change the ingredients, but did change the methods.  I minced the veggies and food-processed (lightly) the beans.  Next time I will cut down on the cumin, however.  At 1T, each pattie has nearly 1t, which didn't agree with my tummy or taste buds.  My patties did break apart when I turned them over, but I made them very thin.  So, I will play with that.
