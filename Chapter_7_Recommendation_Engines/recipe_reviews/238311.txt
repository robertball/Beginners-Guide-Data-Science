It was good. 
I would recommend that one "marinates" the yuba in some dressing while prepping the other ingredients as it has nearly zero flavor on it's own. I also added a tbl. of teriyaki sauce and more chili sauce to mine.

The giant asian grocery store I went to seemed to have 'bean curd sheets', which I think are the same? They were a bit dry and on the chewy side, so maybe not quite the same. Anyway, they were good and nice to eat noodles without the carbs.

Love the dressing! Having a hard time finding the tofu skin in our area.  Even the Asian market didn't have it.  We got a soy noodle instead.  A little thick and ridged texture was not great.  I think the skin noodles would be so good. Red cabbage might be pretty, too.
