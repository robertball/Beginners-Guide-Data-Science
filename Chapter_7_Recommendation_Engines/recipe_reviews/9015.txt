This was pretty good, though I couldn't taste the Italian dressing at all. Is the baking time right? It seems awfully long for chicken, especially once it's pounded thin. I left them in for an hour, which I think was too long, and they turned out a bit dry for my tastes.

This is a very simple and delicious chicken recipe. The next time I make it, I am going to marinade the chicken breasts in the italian dressing after pounding them out. We didn't have buttermilk on hand, so we combined 1 cup of milk with a tablespoon of lemon juice. Definitely use seasoned bread crumbs.

This was fast, tasty and easy. I used the italian seasoned bread crumbs since we wanted a little zip. We only needed to bake ours for 50 minutes. Thanks for the post.

I made this and it turned out great, the above picture I took of chicken cordon bleu I made. I added a Swiss cheese sauce.
