Granted, I wouldn't serve this as a company dessert, but for my kids and I as a mid morning snack, it rocks! We used half lemon and half vanilla yogurt and fresh raspberries. It was fun and easy to make with my 7 year old. I found it a bit tart, but still delicious. Will try again with other flavor and fruit combos. My oldest (12) says to use granola instead of cocoa krispies if we serve it to company :).I liked the chocolate.
