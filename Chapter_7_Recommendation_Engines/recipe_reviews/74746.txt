I love cilantro but this just doesn't cut it. I was reaching for the salt, pepper and ketchup in order to give these some flavor.

The cilantro didn't really make much of a difference, they were still very bland. Don't think I'll be making these again.

I didn't expect much from this recipe, but I had some cilantro that had to be used up and I'm tired of making salsas. With that being said, I just used frozen french fries instead of making my own. These fries are very bland; when you fry cilantro, much of the flavor is lost. I managed to eat them after doctoring them up with ketchup, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and hot sauce. Sorry MISSDOLCEPOIS, I hate giving bad reviews but this just didn't work for me.

It tasted pretty ok. I use a lot of cilantro in my food, & so it came out as nothing special.
