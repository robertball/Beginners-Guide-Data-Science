My husband & I LOVE this recipe.  It's thick & pasty & hearty ~ perfect comfort food.  I use a lot more bacon & a lot more garlic.  Everything else I do exactly as she says, & we honestly hold this recipe as one of our very favorites.  I even chose it as the one to give out in a recipe tree I was involved in!

This recipe was fine, but I feel that the spices weren't strong enough.

These beans were awesome. I kinda cheated, and I hate that because chef inspired recipes should be treated that way, but they were still great. I had to make enough for a side dish for my Class of 2000 reunion BBQ so I calculated the recipe for 70 and I used 3 gallon size cans of Bushes pinto beans.  I used lots of garlic (I didn't measure), but I used all of the other ingredients to the exact measurements they were calculated out for. I cooked and crumbled the bacon into the tomato mixture and saved the tomato mixture for the next day. We were traveling so it went with us on ice. I added the beans and simmered everything together for 20 minutes, then headed out the door. I only heard positive remarks about the recipe, and even bean haters said they loved them.   The only problem I came across was that the chili powder was not listed in the directions. I added it to the tomato mixture but still had to give this recipe 5 stars.  My husband is a bean hater and told me I had permission to cook these again in the winter and he would eat them.

I love these beans!  I never seem to have the marjoram on hand, but I use all the rest of the ingredients mostly as measured.  If I happen to have a ham bone, I'll use it and chunks of ham instead of bacon.  I also add a jalapeno when boiling for more flavor with a kick.  The secret is the added tomato mixture and letting the flavors meld together.  We make a meal out of it with cornbread on the side.  

NOTE:  This is not a chili recipe, so you'll have to hunt the website a little longer if that's what you are looking for.  These are just good old fashioned Southern comfort food.

Awesome recipe!  Great with smoked ribs, brisket, chicken, etc.  I substituted the stewed tomatoes with Rotel tomatoes and it has been a big hit time and time again.  Thanks for sharing T. Pringle.

These beans had good flavor, but I found them to have no sauce to speak of. Not sure why, I followed the drections exactly, and others haven't had this problem.

Tasted strange and not much like chili as I know it, even for vegetarian chili.  My husband loved the balance of spices used, so I thought next time I'd try adding some ground beef for that more traditional chili flavor.

My picky husband and I loved this recipe and he said "it's a keeper!"  Served it as a side dish to bbq'd pork ribs.  After some taste samplings, I added about a palm full (roughly 1 tablespoon) of brown sugar and about 1/2 cup Masterpiece Barbeque Sauce.  Those seemed to be the "missing ingredients" of this bean dish, and it tastes even better the next day.

These beans are in their final stages, cooking on my stove as we speak.  Fantastic!  Rarely do I find beans which have so much complexity. DELISH!!!

The only thing I did differently is add a jalapeno from my garden while boiling the beans.  YUMMO!

I added the cooked bacon and chopped garlic to the tomato mixture later, rather than to the beans while they were cooking.  We like things on the spicy side, so on the final tasting, added a very healthy shot of Trader Joe's chili pepper sauce which took these beans from mediocre to spectacular!  The beans cooked in about an hour, so I just transferred this to a slow cooker for dinner later.  Could use double or triple garlic, but this is a great bean dish.

GREAT recipe! Made these exactly as written, though I simmered the beans with a large jalapeno pepper...seeds and all...mixed in. This recipe is a must try, and I can't wait to mix with other add-ins. Thanks so much for sharing this one. A winner!

These were awesome! I put them over rice for dinner and added some sliced smoked sausage. Could use a little more liquid if putting over rice, but as is would be great as a side to a brisket! Loved it.Thank you.

I love cooking various heirloom beans and I'm always looking for new "pot o' beans" flavoring ideas. This is a nice pot of beans, but I was running late and didn't add the bacon. Mistake. It needed the bacon. In fact, for a pound of beans I will use more than four slices. Next time, with the bacon, I predict this will be at least a 4 star recipe.

I did tweak this slightly to make just a tad healthier by subbing olive oil for butter, home canned tomatoes for stewed tomatoes (less sodium) and omitting the salt.  This was still absolutely delicious.  This will be my pinto bean recipe from now on!  First class!!!  P.S.  May add just a tad of jalapeno in the future...

Good recipe.  Used ham hock and diced ham from the holidays along with bacon.  Didn't drain off the water and added a little more spice.

I made this dish using pinto beans that I grew in my garden. I used Irish Butter (yum!) and, since the chili powder was not noted in the recipe's steps, I added the chili powder to the tomato mixture. I used extra bacon (premium thick cut bacon) and cooked it slow without crisping it. I all strips into 1-inche pieces (like ham) and added it to my beans. I also added a can of diced tomatoes to the can of stewed tomatoes and a teaspoon of vegetable bouillon to final combination to simmer. It is a delicious dish. Thank you for sharing it!

This is a great recipe. I messed mine up as i didn't have dried beans and tried using canned pintos. alas, would never get soft. I'm sure must have been preserved with salt. The flavor however was great.

I made this in the crock pot. I used a left over ham bone from Christmas with lots of meat on it instead of bacon. I did not use the cumin in this dish since I did not want it to taste like chili. Instead, I added some ketchup. We really liked it. I will make it again some day.

These were pretty good.  I added a little more garlic and I have to say they turned out different than what i expected.  They were a bit chili like but all in all they could be changed easily toward the flavors of your main dish by just changing some seasoning.  I added a little barbecue sauce to them and served with Baked Ham and side of Cole Slaw.  Next time I might add a little sweet.  They were just spicy enough, too.

Great recipe! However, I used some substitutes:  one bone-in ham steak for bacon, diced tomatoes for stewed.  Added about a half cup of mild, pickled jalapenos and then added some of the jalapeno juice to loosen up the tomato mixture.  Maybe about a half cup.  The tang and heat kicked it up perfectly!

This was a pretty good recipe.   Not exactly what I was looking for (more of a Tex-Mex pot of beans) but incredibly tasty nonetheless.  I did add lots of salt though as it seemed to be lacking.

Absolutely loved these beans.  I mixed this recipe up with another I had out and started the beans in chicken stalk which was surprisingly a great idea, and I didn't have marjoram so I substituted oregano.  I intend to make it again and have the right spice on hand just to see the difference, but my husband loved these beans!
