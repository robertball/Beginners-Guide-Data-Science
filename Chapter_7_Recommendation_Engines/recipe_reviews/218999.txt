I love this sauce with cold spring rolls, this and the spicy peanut sauce are the main reasons we make the spring rolls! Love it and you can use white or rice vinegar. Delish!

i was looking for a recipe without ketchup or other tomato based sauce. this one was excellent.  as did another reviewer  i used white vinegar and sweet chili sauce only because thats what i had on hand.  i wont be buying sweet and sour sauce again.  this was easy and so much better!

This is easy and delicious!  Just the right balance of sweet, salty and spicy. Served with homemade veggie spring rolls. I could just eat it by the spoonful though!  I added a tiny bit of cornstarch dissolved in water to thicken.  I imagine it would be delicious on tofu, chicken, shrimp, pork, anything!  Thank you!

This sauce is great and my husband loved it!  Good with spring rolls.  I used garlic salt instead of regular salt and red Tabasco pepper sauce instead of chili garlic sauce.

I made this sauce for sweet n sour chicken. Cubed chicken breast and when chicken was almost done I added the sauce and simmered for a couple of minutes. I did make a couple of changes to the sauce. I added just a tad bit less of the rice vinegar since vinegar is very strong and only used 1t. of salt. This came out great. Will be using this sauce for dipping egg rolls in a party that I am planning. Will be back to post my comments on what my guest think of this sauce. FYI also used it to dip chicken nuggets with the kids.....thanks for the recipe

I really liked this sauce!  Because I didn't want to buy yet another chili sauce, I used a combo of Sweet Chile Sauce and Sambal Oelek.  I also used only half the salt.  But I think it's really the vinegar/sugar method of cooking that makes the sauce so different from other sauces, so I hope that sets well with the author of this recipe.  I served it last night with some potstickers and today with some chicken.  I'll bet the reviewer who said it didn't thicken didn't wait to write the review because it really does thicken---a lot!  Very yummy!  Thank you!
