We did not care for this recipe at all. I make a similar recipe that is excellent. I season and brown the pork chops in a frypan. Drain grease, add 2 cans golden mushroom soup and simmer on low until pork chops are done. This way the soup stays nice and thick and you can put it over mashed potatoes. Try it like this...I think you will like it better.

This was pretty good. Everyone in my family really liked it. I hate it when people make a million changes in a review but.... I did saute the onion, (canned) mushrooms and about a tablespoon of minced(jar)garlic in a skillet until soft, removed it from the skillet and put in a bowl. I browned the pork chops in the same skillet, seasoning them with a good amount of season salt, garlic powder and pepper while in the skillet, transferred to the baking pan and topped with onion mixture and soup. Very flavorfull and tender, I will definitley make again.

OMG!!! I made this last night, and my boyfriend LOVED it.  I did do like the others and brown the pork chops in a TBSP of butter, 1/4 cup of onions and TBSP of garlic.  I after letting them bake in the 350 degree oven, i turn the oven up to 400 for about 15 minutes.  Then uncovered.  They were the best pork chops I've ever cooked.  Im making them again tonight.//Ok so I made it again less than 24 hours later. Even better.  2 thumbs up

This is a great starter recipe. I took some of his ideas and some of mine and kind of mingled them together. First I decided to brown my meat (6 chops) in the skillet w/ some garlic,pepper, and seasoning salt to my liking. Then I mixed 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup w/ milk and added 2 cans of mushrooms, the chops, covered, and baked. It turned out delicious! The meat was very tender and moist. I separated the meat and the "gravy" and poured the "gravy" over the meat and the mashed potatoes I served with the chops. As far as everyone giving this recipe a bad review, they need to stop and think about everyone's different tastes. As far as it being bland, everyone has a different threshold for spices.  And as far as it being dry, a quick fix of covering it with aluminum foil to lock in the moisture might do the trick. It seemed to work for me. Anyways, once again a GREAT starter recipe, and I will definatly be making again. Thanks and God Bless

These looked terrible coming out of the oven. My husband made a face and said what is that??? But after he bit into one he was sold, even my 7 & 1 year old loved them. I was asked to make this agian and again.

I did do as other reviewers suggested and heavily season the pork chops before browning them. I also used an 2 cans of cream of mushroom and one of celery. I think 2 cans would be plenty next time. I also added extra onions since my family is such a big fan of them, and omitted the extra mushrooms as I'm not a big fan.

Thanks for the tasty recipe!

I've also made this by chopping up the pork, seasoning & browning then slow cooking and serving over egg noodles or rice.

My husband loved these. I made some changes. I used one can of golden mushroom AND one can of cream of mushroom soup. I also sauteed the onions and sliced mushrooms as another reviewer had suggested. also, i used a metal meat tenderizer briefly on the chops AND used seasoned meat tenderizer.. the chops were very juicy and tender!

Delicious! I made this recipe along the lines of some other reviewers, first sauteing the onions and mushrooms in vegetable oil. I then set those aside and browned the pork chops in the same oil, seasoning both sides with seasoning salt, pepper, garlic powder, ginger, and thyme. I mixed together the soup, leftover water from the canned mushrooms, onion, and mushrooms, and then added all the same spices to that mix for the sauce. Since the pork chops were already browned, I baked them for only 30 minutes, at which point they were thoroughly cooked but still juicy. The results were fantastic! It would've probably been bland, but the thyme and browning the meat really made the recipe. Will cook this again!

I love this recipe. It is a great place to start with p/chops. I have tweeked it to fit my schedule and opted to use canned srooms instead of fresh and  put it in a slow cooker/roaster on low with two large whole potatoes on top, set it on low and dinner was ready when I got home from work, just add salad and french bread. I have also done it in the oven and it always turnd out great. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and green peas....yummy!

Simple preparation even with browning the pork chops & sauteing the onions/mushrooms.  Used baby portabella mushrooms.  

Added a little bit of cream (about 1 tablespoon) when finished cooking to make the sauce a bit creamier.

The meat was very moist and tender.  Covered the baking dish the entire time during baking.

Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Very satisfying.

I will be making this recipe again! I used about 6 oz of mushrooms and sauteed them and the onion first. I also used cream of mushroom, added green beans, 2 Tablespoons of minced garlic and more seasoning for the meat. It was very tender and even my toddlers liked it!

I only changed a few things. I used a huge package of 8 thick chops. Not center cut but not the cheapest cuts, either. I used an 8 oz carton of fresh mushrooms. I bought 2 cans of the golden cream of mushroom soup at the store but could only find one can when I got home, so I used one can of that and one can of regular cream of mushroom soup that I already had at the house. (I bet the other can rolled to the back of the car on the way home, lol)  I sauteed half of a chopped sweet onion, 2 heaping teaspoons of minced garlic from a jar, and the mushrooms in 2 tablespoons of real butter. Set aside in a bowl, then I put the chops in the same skillet I just used, seasoned them with garlic & sea salt grinder, seasoned salt and pepper grinder, and lightly browned both sides.   I put the chops in a 10x15 (just a tad bigger than the usual 9x13) and spooned the soup over the chops, and then spooned the mushroom/garlic/onion mixture over the soup. I covered it with foil and cooked it in the oven for one hour at 375 degrees. Very very good!

I made these again tonight and they were just delicious once again. Pure comfort food. After making these severals times, I've ended up modifying it much like the other reviewers did, but the recipe, as written, is worthy of 4 stars easily. I made it, as is, at least twice with favorable results. Now, I double the mushrooms and I sautee them and a clove of garlic (minced) in a bit of olive oil or butter, then remove and mix with the soup. I then brown the pork chops, seasoned with garlic powder, pepper, and a bit of thyme. I find that Campbell's Golden Mushroom Soup is saltier than regular Cream of Mushroom, so I always skip the seasoned salt. Love this recipe and it's easy to modify to fit the tastes of your own family. Thanks :)

Really excellent recipe.  Followed Becca's suggestions.  Sauteed the mushrooms & onions in a little olive oil with some garlic.  Removed from pan and added the chops which I seasoned with garlic, pepper & seasoning salt.  Browned quickly.  Mixed 2 cans mushroom soup with a scant one can of skim milk.  Put chops in baking dish, covered with mushroom/onions and then poured soup mix over top.  Baked for approx. 45 mins.  Absolutely phenomenal.

I got out of this just what I expected from a dish that begins with canned soup and little else - an okay-tasting meal, rather on the boring side, not very attractive, yet something oddly "comfort-foodish" about it which I guess is what I was aiming for.  I did have to play with it a little since the recipe called for no seasoning other than salt and pepper.  I seasoned the chops with Montreal Chicken seasoning, and to the soup, I mean gravy, I added a good glug of Chardonnay, a couple shakes of Worcestershire sauce and some poultry seasoning. I served the chops over simple buttered pasta and "Skillet Cabbage," also from this site.

My kids loved it!  Even the picky one!  I used turkey chops instead of pork. I have a big family so I had about 16 turkey chops which equal in size to about 10 regular sized pork chops. I cooked the onions and mushrooms in butter and olive oil and browned the chops in the same pan as suggested by others.  I seasoned my chops with garlic powder, seasoned salt, pepper, and onion powder. I couldn't find Golden Mushroom soup so I used 3 cans of cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of celery and a can of milk to loosen it up some.  I served it over buttered noodles and some brocolli on the side!  YUMMY!

I forgot to mention in my earlier review that I used thin cut pork chops. They come out of the oven so tender and you can cut them with a fork. GREAT!

I also wanted to say that you have to make them differently than what the instructions say for them to come out good. I sliced the onions into half moons and sauteed them in a pan with some vegetable oil until onions were caramelized. I took them out of the pan and mix them with 2 cans of soup and set aside. Season pork chops with salt, peper, and garlic powder and sautee them in the same pan for about 10-15 minutes. Set the browned pork chops in a 9x13 and pour soup/onion/mushroom mixture on top. Bake for 40 minutes. Wonderful, comort food meal!

My family has cooked a similar version of this for years. I slice about 5 large potatoes and layer them in a dish and place the pork chops on top of them. Use a little extra mushroom sauce to cover the potatoes and you have a nice side as well-all in one dish.

I have been making this for years, but in the crock pot.  It's so EASY and even the kids like it. Sometimes I brown the chops before putting in the crock, sometimes I don't.  All tastes about the same.  I add carrots as well. Easy veggie side.

I just left the recipe alone & made it like it stated with the exception of how I baked it: 350 for 45 min., then turned up the oven temp to 425 for another 15-20 min. Everything cooked perfectly, even the onions. It came out fork tender, juicy & extremely flavorful! Forget browning the chops or sauteing the onions with the mushrooms first - there's no need to dirty your stovetop! My husband stopped eating pork chops because they were so dry & tasteless, but raved about this recipe!

Mom made this for us kids when we were little. She never added salt, just used pepper. Sometimes, she would fry the pork after it had been dredged, then add the soup. Nice comforting meal. Very good with a spoonful of sour cream and a little worchestershire stirred in a the end, for a change.  You really don't need to bake it. You can fry your chops first, then just add the sauce. It'll save time and energy.

Very good, comforting meal when served with homemade mashed potatoes and lima beans.  I made several changes due to other reviews and personal taste.  Per other reviewers, I sauted the onion and mushrooms w/ garlic in butter before mixing with the soup.  I also found it necessary to add a little milk to thin.  Then lightly browned the pork chops on each side before adding to the baking pan.  Finally, I reduced the baking time to accomodate my thinner pork chops.

I love this and make it often.  I make a little differently each time, but the main thing I add is a little onion soup powder mix.  I also add a little milk to thin out the cream of mushroom soup mixture. Sometimes I use a flavored cream of mushrooms--roasted garlic.  Yum!!!

THE PORK CHOP WAS VERY TENDER!! I DID OMIT THE FRESH MUSHROOMS AND USED 1 CAN OF GOLDEN MUSHROOMS AND 1 CAN OF CREAM OF MUSHROOOMS AND IT WAS AWESOME. YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE MUCH SEASONING THOUGH BECAUSE I OVER SEASONED IT WITH THE SEASON SALT BUT OTHER THAN THAT I HAD NO COMPLAINTS!!

10/10 recipe!  Used 1 chopped onion, 1 container of mushrooms (chopped) and 2 cloves of garlic.  Sauteed these 3 ingredients, then removed from pan and combined with 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup.  Then browned 6 boneless pork chops (seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder), laid them in a 9x13 glass bakeware and covered with sauce.  Baked at 375 for 30 minutes, then 400 for 15 minutes.  Awesome meal with mashed potatoes!  Quick prep and makes lots of extras.

I thought the flavor of this was great!  I used the main ingredients, took tips from other reviewers, and had an easy crock pot meal.  Per other reviewers, I sauteed the onion in seasoning salt & olive oil and put in crock pot.  Didn't have fresh mushrooms, so used canned mushrooms and put in crock pot over the onions.  Then I diced 6 boneless pork chops into strips and sauteed them in the same pan I'd sauteed the onions in with a little more seasoning salt.  Dumped these into the crock pot.  Just had regular mushroom soup, so used that, and threw in about 8 oz. of leftover sour cream I had in the fridge.  Stirred it all together and started the crock pot on high for about an hour, then cooked it for about 5 hours on low.  The meat was SO tender...I served over mashed potatoes, but you could also use rice.  It was really soupy, but it smelled so good we were too hungry to wait for me to thicken it -- this could easily be done with some corn starch/water.  I will definitely make this again, and next time will use the Golden Mushroom soup, even though the regular was awesome...and take the time to thicken the "gravy!"

This is a winner! I made the recipe as written. I was very happy with the results. The pork chops were nice and tender and the gravy was delicious. We put the gravy over rice but next time it will be mashed potatoes.

As written it was just okay for us. Good basis to tinker with though. Next time I do think it would be worth the extra step (& clean-up) of browning the seasoned chops then sauteeing the onion & mushrooms just a bit prior to putting it all in the oven. Definitely needed a little something more, maybe a dash of Worcestershire sauce in the gravy...just needs to be kicked up a notch.

Quite liked it. Made it exactly as outlined though scaled down to fewer pork chops. One issue though: too salty for my taste due to (I'm guessing) the excessive salt in the condensed Golden Mushroom condensed soup. At my local supermarkets there is only one brand that does Golden Mushroom (no surprises which one) and that small can contains 27% sodium. There are standard cream of mushroom condensed soups with low sodium options and I'd be tempted to do it again using those. Lower the salt and this one would be a keeper, given how easy it is to prepare. Right now the salt is just too overpowering.

My family loves these. I  just let them sear in a pan for 25 minutes, instead of baking. Came out juicy both times! I made them with mashed potatoes and green beans and used the sauce as gravy. Yum.

Excellent!  Chops were prepared as directed,although I did add a little Chardonnay wine and a package of dry onion soup mix , and they turned out perfect. Baking time was dead on. Thanks for sharing!

A great recipe! Like other reviewers, I sauteed the onions and mushrooms, along with some garlic, in evoo, then browned the prok chops in the same pan and added it all to the soup in a baking dish. After 45 minutes, it was perfect!

Awesome!  I seasoned the 1 inch chops with salt, lemon pepper and garlic powder and placed them in the slow cooker.  Then I poured the golden mushroom sauce and onions over the top and cooked for 8 hours.  The chops were to die for!  So moist and tender!  Will definitely make again!

This is by far the best pork chop recipe I've ever had. I browned the pork chops and sauteed the mushrooms and onions before putting it in the oven and it came out really tender with tons of flavor.I will definitely make this recipe again!

Just finished dinner so I thought I would write a quick review.  These were quite good although I did make several changes.  I sauted the chopped onion in some olive oil and added two grated cloves of garlic near the end.  Then I put them in a separate bowl and browned the pork chops in the same pan.  I used two cans of healthy cream of celery soup and added the onion mixture and a little bit of Gravy Master for color.  My son doesn't like mushrooms so I didn't use any.  I poured the "gravy" over the pork chops, covered and baked as directed.  Very good.  Oh, and I made mashed potatoes too.  The gravy was a hit on both potatoes and chops.  Thanks for a good base recipe.

I prefer not to review if I had to make a change but I did want to share my experience. I made this as written except that I only had 1 can of golden mushroom so I did have to substitute a can of cream of mushroom. It was delicious. I do think it would be even better with all golden mushroom. UPDATE:  I made this with 1 can of golden mushroom soup and added an envelope of pork gravy mix and a big dollop of sour cream ( maybe 1/4 x1/2 cup). I sautéd chopped onion and fresh mushrooms and put that over the chops and gravy. Baked as directed. This kicked it up a notch and made it taste a bit different. Still love the original recipe.

Great easy recipe...I've been making these for years, and am cooking them again this month for 50 people.  This is a good recipe for large groups because once the chops are tender, you can keep them warm and exact timing is not an issue.  I don't add the extra mushrooms or onions due to personal taste...also, try adding about one cup of beef stock to the canned soup instead of milk.....delicious!!

I enjoyed this, though DH wasn't a big fan.  I cut the recipe in half but used 4 oz. of mushrooms - the amount called for just didn't look like enough when I measured it out.  I did take the suggestion of other reviewers and saute the onion and mushrooms in some olive oil first, then browned the pork chops.  This cut down the bake time.  I probably won't make this again since DH didn't really enjoy it, but I'm glad I tried it.

I made this absolutely as written.  All I tasted in the "gravy" was raw onion.  The pork chops were moist and tasted good, but next time I would take other reviewers' suggestions and saute onion and mushrooms prior to baking.  I think I would also use one can of cr mushroom soup to replace one of the cans of golden mushroom.

Very good!I modified the recipe somewhat to meet the taste of my family and to use type of soup that I had on hand.I did as some of the other reviews mentioned and  browned the onion and clove of chopped garlic in EVOO. I  browned the seasoned chops in EVOO and small amount of butter before I placed in baking dish. Used 1 can of cream of celery soup and 1 packet of dry brown gravy mix with mushrooms. Mixed dry gravy mix in with creamed soup and a small amount of water....enough to rinse can.Stirred well and poured over the chops. Covered chops and baked as directed, uncovering in last 10 minutes of baking. Chops were very tender and the gravy was great..everyone said to cook chops like this again real soon. A big THANK YOU for sharing the recipe, I will definitely prepare chops like this again.

My husband has made this same recipe for years and it's a favorite.  He doesn't add salt (soup already has enough) and cooks it in an electric fry pan (his preference).  The key to this soup is using GOLDEN mushroom soup.  If you substitute cream of mushroom soup, it is an altogether different recipe.

I've made this recipe for years except I brown the chops, and sautee the mushrooms and onions first and also add 2 cups of shredded cheddar to the soup mix before adding it to the onions, mushrooms and chops.  try adding a little cinammon for a unique flavor.

Simple and delicious, great weeknight family comfort food.  I used a large oven safe saute pan, and seasoned my chops with Lawrey's and cracked black pepper, and browned on one side of the pan.  The other side I added the onions and mushrooms, seasoned, and sauteed as well.  When the chops were browned I just mixed everything together with the sauce, and placed the covered pan in the oven 350* for 45 minutes.  Served with mashed potatoes and oven roasted asparagus.  Hubs loved this meal.  Thanks of sharing!

Delicious!  We really enjoyed this recipe. I chose to brown them on the stove and just simmer on low for about 1.5 hours.  This left my oven free for side dishes.  Will definitely keep in the rotation.

This is wonderful! My whole family loved it and this recipe made me love these soft caramelized onions. I did first saute the onions and fresh mushrooms then I removed them from the pan and browned the pork chops in the same pan. I baked everything for 40 minutes and they were so tender and flavorful. This is a little reminiscient of salisbury steak but with pork chops. Thanks for the recipe!

I used regular cream of mushroom soup because our grocery store didn't have golden mushroom soup, & it was awesome. My husband was still telling me how good they were the next day.

These are great but I do as others do and brown them first.  I usually add some wine to the sauce.  Maybe 1/2 C but I only make enough for 3 servings.  I like to serve mine with dumplings and an asparagus side.

Delicious! I couldn't fine, nor have I ever seen the Golden Mushroom soup. Instead, I used two cans of cream of mushroom soup a half can of beef broth and a splash of tomatoe sauce. I simmered all three, added a 1/4 teasppon of garlic powder and white pepper. I browned the chops in a tablespoon of olive oil, then tranfered them into a dish, poured the simmered sauced and covered them with foil for 20 minutes @ 375. Inthe meantime I chopped a whole onion and sauteed it in the same pan that I browned the chops in. I added this to the chops, opened the foil and continued cooking for another 25 minutes. Served with mashed potatoes and there was pretty of sauce for gravey. Will definitely be making this again! Thank you.

These really are delicious.  I brown chops in a saute pan 1st, pour in 1 can cream of mush and one can golden mush and bring to simmer, and then pour into baking dish.  Cover and bake at 350 for 20 min.  Uncover, pour sauteed onions and mush on top, and bake another 20 min.  Soooo good and soooo easy!  Thank you!!!

I've made this for many years with some variation. This is for 4 chops. For those who don't like using raw or sauteed onion, try mixing one envelope of dry GOLDEN Onion soup mix into one can Golden Cream of Mushroom soup. Use the Golden Onion vs regular as it has a chicken base instead of the stronger beef base flavor (unless you like that on pork). Add 1/2 cup milk to make it creamy, mix all together and pour over browned, seasoned (I use garlic & onion powder, seasoned salt and black pepper) chops. Bake COVERED at 350, for 30 minutes  then increase heat to 400 and baked UNCOVERED for 15 minutes more. Delectable! Moist and flavorful meat and gravy to die for. Serve with any sides you choose, potatoes, rice and even pasta goes well with these chops. YUMMMM!

After a bit of tweaking, this recipe is fabulous!  I did as others have, and pan-fried onions, garlic, and mushrooms then added them to the soup.  Then I fried the pork chops with seasoning salt and pepper and followed the recipe from there.

OMG! These are awesome pork chops! I'm normally not a pork chop person, but I ran across this recipe, and just had to try it. I'm so glad I did! I did add onion & garlic powders. I also added a bit of milk to the soup, making it easier to spread on top of the chops. My daughter, who normally doesn't like gravy on her meat, had two helpings! I'll definitely be making again. Thanks for sharing!

THIS IS A FANTASTIC RECIPE! Okay, I changed it a little,used cream of chicken in place of and Tony C's seasoning  and I cut up yellow bell peppers instead of mushrooms (not in my kitchen!) Excellent meal, it's been suggested that I use cream of celery next time, we'll see about that.

Wow, and my Mother thought the Golden Mushroom Soup was her idea!  LOL  Our family's version is to brown the chops first and sauté the onions in the same pan then add them to an enamel roasting pan. Don't be afraid to deglaze the sauté pan with white wine (1/4 to 1/2 cup) and add it to the roasting pan.

A pork chop with ZERO seasoning, put on the grill, tastes better than this recipe. Very bland. We were bummed because we wasted 4 beautiful chops on this one.

I absolutely LOVED this dish.  I did however used some of the suggestions by other reviewers.  I seasoned the porkchop w/salt, pepper and garlic and browned it in EVO. In another pan i added a lil oil,onions, minced garlic, mushroom and white wine for flavoring before adding the canned mushroom soup.  I added a water to make less thick.  I poured it over the porkchop and placed in the over.  I used the leftover sauce to pour over the porkchop once cooked.  I had these with some mashed potatoe and corn and made for an INCREDIBLE dish.  The hubby ate it all! :)

This is one of my favorite ways to cook pork chops.  I sautee diced onion and fresh mushrooms in butter, then sear the chops in the same pan (the key is to get the pan hot (med high) so you just brown the chops, and don't cook them).  I then covered the dish in foil and cooked for 30 min. @ 350 and 30 min @ 375. I have tried the method of cooking on the stove top with a deep pan, but my pork chops always come out dry that way.  I think you need the indirect heat to keep them moist.

Very good! I added thyme and sage, that gave it a real hearty flavor. My wife says, if she's ever on death row, this would be her final meal. We also made it with chicken breast, it was excellent!

Easy to make and great tasting!  Even my picky son loved them.  I adhered to the recommendations from others, browning the chops a little longer and putting gravy and fresh mushrooms on top.  Yummy!

I gave 4 stars because this is an awesome Base recipe and so easy.  I read a lot of the other reviews and adapted many of the ideas.  I saueteed 1 large chopped onion and 1 package of mushrooms in EVOO with a little bit of butter until theedges were getting browned.  When they were just about done I added 2 minced garlic clovesnad just cooked until fragrant.  I added the sauteed mix to a bowl with 1 can of Golden Mushroom soup, 1/4 C water & 1/4 C lowfat milk and some spices: 1tsp dried thyme, 1/2 tspn oregano (or Italian Seasoning) 1/2 tspn ginger, S&P and a few dashes of hot sauce.  I seasoned the pork chops (boneless sirloin chops) with a little garlic powder, onion powder & S&P then sauteed the pork chops lightly on both sides in the same pan.  Placed the chops in a baking dish and poured the soup mix over them evenly and baked covered for about 30 minutes then uncovered for another 10 minutes.  The great thing about this is the Deeeelicious sauce!!  I made a pot of brown rice and added the leftover gravy to the rice for my lunch the next day & it was soooo good!

My family loved this recipe.  Even my kids ate it with no problem.  I made a couple changes.  I browned the meat first and the sauteed the onions and mushrooms (I used an entire 8 oz package of mushrooms - button as store didnt have shitake).  I layered those on top of chops in baking dish.  I mixed the soup with a little milk and some herbs and poured over the chops.  Since I browned them, I only cooked for about 45 minutes total.

My family loved it.  I was so tender, you didn't need a knife.  I took the advice of others here an made some tweaks of my own.  I had 8 thin pork loin chops I used instead.  I didn't have any extra mushrooms on hand and it was still fabulous; but next time I make it I will make sure I have some because I think it would enhance the dish.  I also used just plain salt/pepper because I had no seasoned salt. I used one big vidalia onion and a tablespoon of jarred garlic.  I did use the 2 cans of mushroom soup and added just a little milk to smooth it out a bit because it was a bit lumpy when I added the onion/garlic mixture.  I also browned the meat.  I made home-made mashed potatoes and used the extra mushroom sauce on the potatos.  Everyone was happy.  Even my husband; and he's very hard to please!  If I can figure out how, I'm going to post a photo of what mine looked like right out of the oven.

Definitely a keeper! Delicious! I didn't have Season Salt and just used salt & pepper and 2 cans regular cream of mushroom soup and it was still something my family raved over.  Next time I might try a little wine in the gravy mix. Might be better but might not.  It's a great recipe and extremely easy!

Lots of leftovers, Sorry but this recipe was too bland. We ate it but  we basically have to force ourselves to eat it as there was nothing else prepared for dinner. Even garlic didn't save this one. Will not try again. Even the thought of eaten this again upsets my stomach, sorry

This was recipe was great. I used Cambell's mushroom and garic soup instead of regular mushroom. I also added a small clove of garlic. It was great and you may want to try it that way.

This a a quick and easy recipe!  I did not have the golden mushroom soup so I used plain cream of Mushroom soup.  No Mushrooms so I omitted them.  Like one of the reviewers suggested I did brown the pork chops before baking and I chose to slice the onions and carmelize them after browning the chops!  Thanks for an excellent recipe Hallie!!!

Desperate for a good and easy baked pork chop recipe and I came across this one.  LOVED IT! The pork chops were so good...not dry! I wasn't sure if the mushrooms would get soft, but they did.  I didn't add an onion because the child in my house hates them and I only had one can of golden mushroom soup, so I mixed it with a regular cream of mushroom soup.  Those aren't changes, just letting you know those two things don't change it.  Next time I will add the onion and make sure I have 2 cans of golden soup.  I bet that makes it even better!!

I make this same identical dish but instead of mushrooms I use new potato's. I spray a baking dish with pam slice the new potatoes on bottom, onions sliced into rings on top of that. Brown the chops in a skillet and place on top, then add the 2 cans of soup on top of that. Cook as directed above. This is a real meal in one dish. Glad I found this one though as the mushrooms will be a great addition for next time. Thanks for sharing

This recipe turned out really well.  I think next time I make it I will brown the pork chops first.  I also added some fresh garlic which the family loved.

These were very good. I didn't really think I would like them, but was looking for a different way to make pork chops and had all the ingredients on hand. Well, my husband and I really enjoyed them, and the sauce was delicious!

This is one of my favorite meals. I always make it with rice and some vegtable on the side like green beans. The only difference is I put it all in a skillet and let it simmer for a hour or so. Usually I brown the meat first with a flour bread crumb mixture also just to get that yummy crust.

Ugh, what a soupy sloppy mess this turned out to be. I followed the recipe as stated, and couldn't have been more disappointed with the results. I couldn't even eat it!!!! You definitely need to sear the pork chops prior to baking in the soup mixture, because the meat comes out looking grey & gross with this orange water/gravy stuff surrounding them. Yuck!

being from new orleans, i had to do alot to this recipe to get it to my cultural liking! first of all this is pork chop soup! i sauteed bell pepper, onion, green onion, a few fresh mushrooms in olive oil.  In the same skillet i panfried the floured and seasoned with tony chacheres pork chops.  once they were nice and brown.  i added the cream of mushroom soup, minced onion, basil, rosemary, alot of garlic, garlic pepper, a cup of water to thin the sauce, and kitchen bouquet to give it a nice brown gravy color.  I allowed the chops to cook on a medium fire for at least 40 minutes, stirring until a smooth consistancy....once they were done i spooned the sauce and mushrooms on top...it was yummy once i tweaked the recipe alot!

This is a great starter recipe. I sauteed the onions and mushrooms in butter, put them to the side with one can of cream of mushroom, one can of cream of chicken, and one packet of onion soup mix. Next, I browned the pork chops seasoned with salt and pepper for about 15 min. Finally, I returned the soup and onion mix to the frypan and let simmer on low for about 45min. I did cook 2 of the pork chops in the oven because I ran out of space and I would recommend using the stovetop method over the oven method for a thicker gravy. This was the most delicious meal, I think I will try it in a slow cooker next time for more tender meat.

This was awesome.  But I did as others and saute'd the onions w/mushrooms and fresh garlic then added soup and covered chops.  My chops were 1 inch thick so 30 minutes covered and 10 uncovered worked.  We served with mashed potatoes.  All I heard from our table was Mmmm..

Turned out great!  Will make again.  Like others I fried pork chops until slightly browned, sauteed onions and mushrooms then added on top of pork chops.  To the soup mix I added 1/2 can milk and 1/2 water.  I ended up baking for about 2 hours turned out very tender.  I do think next time I will brown then toss everything into crockpot.

i am just learning to cook and did not know to pre cook the pork chops.  Here i followed the recipe and thought supper would be ready at a decent time...two extra hours later we were able to eat.  I put raw chops in the sauce, they were only an inch thick!  I just think it needs to say to pre cook or brown the chops first.

I made this for the 1st time and I notice i had it in my reciepe box since Oct 2008.  My partner and I loved it.  I didn't have 6 pork chops so I used only four.  All the other ingredients were the same qty's. Since I live in an RV Travel Trailer the ovens are not really reliable so I have a counter top CusineArt oven that cooks perfect every time no matter what I make in it.

THE GOLDEN PORK CHOPS WERE TENDER AND THE ABSOLUTE BEST CHOPS WE HAVE EVER EATEN! I made Rice-A-Roni as a side dish.  We have enough left over for tomorrow's dinner. What a great reciepe. I never fixed a pork chop except fried before and this was a wonderful experience for us. Our chops were Medium Thick and it took only 45 minutes to cook.

This was pretty good, but not something my family is necessarily clamoring for me to make again.  I wouldn't be opposed to making it again, it just wouldn't be the first thing I'd go to.

My husband and I really liked the recipe. Like others, I sauted the mushrooms in chopped garlic and olive oil first. Used 3 chops, 1 can of golden mushroom soup and a little white wine to the sauce. Very good. I wont add any salt next time though. Thanks.

Used 1 can of golden mushroom and 1 can of cream of mushroom. Served over rice. It was good. I browned the chops with garlic powder, seasoning salt and pepper. Next time will use less salt. Husband and kids liked it.

Awesome recipe!! The only changes I made were to use an entire 8 oz. package of sliced fresh mushrooms and to add 4 cloves of fresh garlic.  I  sauteed the garlic (minced) along with the mushrooms and onion in a little olive oil prior to adding the soup & covering the chops with the mixture.  I used the sauce as gravy over the chops and baked red potatoes and had a green salad as a side. This meal was a winner and we will definitely have it again!

I was searching for something aside from breading and frying my chops....great but tiring and a bit time consuming for a family of 6....found this recipe and it is absolutely fantastic...a bit heavy on the onion, next time I'll use a half but the prep was a snap and the results were quite satisfying....THANKS! golden mushroom soup will be a staple in my cupboard from now on

All I have to say is that my husband (who is not a fan of pork chops) was persuaded to take "just one bite" to try them... well he said holly Shoot these are good!!!!!!!! and that was that! The only thing I did was add a full can of Cream of mushroom so that I would have extra sauce to put over rice.

Excellent! Sauteed onions and garlic. Salted and peppered the chops then browned in frying pan. Mixed onions and garlic with soup and baked as directed.

This was deelish! Like other reviewers, I first sauteed the chops in a very small amount of EVOO, then removed from pan, reduced heat and added the chopped onions and cooked just a few minutes until tender.  I put the chops in a shallow baking dish, spooned the onions on top, then poured the golden mushroom soup and fresh mushrooms on top. Covered, baked at 375 for 30 minutes, removed foil and continued baking uncovered for another 15 minutes.  The chops were SOOO tender and the golden mushroom soup made a delicious gravy, which I served over the chops and rice pilaf.  Someone stopped by the house just as we finished eating dinner and the first words out of her mouth were, "What smells so good?"  I ended up giving her the leftovers to take home!

My mom made something similar but I can never get her recipe to turn out right (she never wrote the recipe down). This was spot on to her version! I updated it for my family. I sauteed 1/2 of a large viadallia onion and minced garlic with 1T butter. I browned my seasoned (Williams Sonoma's Asian seasoning) pork chops in the onions and garlic. I cooked according to the directions and they were awesome! My husband said, What is that? Slightly disgusted as they came out but LOVED them! Said they were the best pork chops he ever had. And, he couldn't get enough of the sauce -- eating it by the spoonful. I should add I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom. Maybe because we're midwesterners but we don't like the golden mushroom. And, the cream is nice for adding your own spices to the sauce. A keeper! My toddlers approved :D

I seasoned my chops with garlic and onion powders and black pepper but no salt due to the high sodium that's already in the soup. I browned the chops and then placed them in the slow cooker with lots of mushrooms. Just before serving, I removed the chops and added some sour cream to the gravy. So good and thank you!

Super easy to prepare, wonderful to eat! Pork chops came out fall-off-the-bone tender.  Added a little garlic powder in addition to the seasoning salt and pepper.  Served with veggies and mashed potatoes and spooned some of the sauce on the potatoes.  Total comfort food.

Pork was very tender and delicious...left out the fresh mushrooms and added a little milk to mix the soup with.  I melted butter & mixed it with bread crumbs then added that to egg noodles and put the pork & extra soup over the noodles...Will definetly make again!

Love it!  What I did differently:  I use a dutch oven, for just about everything... Seared the chops in the dutch oven, sauteed some onions and mushrooms, mixed in the soup.  Returned the chops to the mixture in the dutch oven, and slow cooked at 300 for 2 hours.  Perfect!  Even better the next day!  Excess gravy is yuuummy on mashed taters too. :)

This was very good---with a few little changes.  I sauteed the onion & baby bella mushrooms in butter, olive oil, & a little white wine.  When done, I removed from pan, then browned the seasoned (salt & pepper) pork chops quickly on both sides.  Placed pork chops in pan, combined a can each of golden mushroom & cream of mushroom soup, added the sauteed onion & mushrooms, and poured over chops.  Baked covered for about 30 mins., then uncovered about 15 mins.  Served with whole wheat noodles & green beans.... Delicious!

I thought it was great!  I browned the onions in olive oil & seasoning salt, added the mushrooms, then when they were done, I threw them in a crock pot.  I sliced the thick pork chops into strips and browned them in the same pan with a little more seasoning salt, then threw them in the crock pot.  Stirred in the mushroom soup (didn't even have Golden, just used regular mushroom soup) and a dab of sour cream I had leftover in the fridge.  Cooked on low all afternoon. It was a little soupy (I could have thickened it, but we were too hungry to wait!) but we went ahead and dipped up the "stew" and ate it over mashed potatoes.  Very good flavor, and the meat was so tender.

This is a very tasty and EASY way to make chops. I sauteed the pork chops with the onion and added some garlic first, then put in the dish and baked for 30 min. Added onion soup mix to can of soup that I poured over the chops before baking. I have a hard time finding dishes that make chops tender, but this did it!

Great, I cooked it on top of the stove because it was to hot to use the oven. I also browned the pork chops first. Everyone loved it. I have made it twice and the results are great. I guess you could use the crockpot on low if you have to be gone most of the day.

Excellent! We eat this often. I always season and brown the chops before baking, and sometimes I sautee the onions, mush, and some minced garlic before adding to the soup and baking dish but this isn't necessary if you're in a hurry. I usually make with garlic mashed potatoes and a green bean dish.

After sifting through over 300 reviews, I came up with a conclusion. I used minced onion instead of real onion on the account that I didn't feel like chopping an onion. I sauteed the minced onion and canned mushrooms in butter. Then I browned the pork chops, adding Italian seasoning, garlic, and pepper to each side. I put the chops in a pan and poured 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 can cream of celery soup, mushrooms, and tad of milk over them. Baked for about 35 minutes and they were yummy. Goes great with rice and green beans.

Excellent recipe. This was the first time I've made my own pork chops, and they turned out so much better than my mom's ever did - tender and juicy, not at all dry. I couldn't find golden mushroom soup, so I used cream of mushroom. Both my boyfriend and I loved it. The sauce is also good over mashed potatoes, if you want to have that as a side.

My husband loved these!  I only had one can of golden mushroom, so I substituted cream of mushroom for the second and added a little bouillion granules. The onion taste was a little strong for the kiddos, though, so next time I'll either use less or try sauteing them first.

A good, easy meal.  I have also cooked this recipe on the stovetop by browning chops in oil then adding remaining ingredients. I do not add any salt due to the canned soup already has plenty.

For a quick fix, not many ingredients recipe, this was perfect!

I didn't even have fresh mushrooms and used a can instead. I browned the chops in the pan quickly, it saved me 20 minutes in the oven. I even had a surprise guest that night -hubby's coworker I never met!- and he cleaned his plate! I was really relieved.

I would use maybe a little more seasoning next time, or brown the onions too, but this was otherwise perfect for a quick, effortless fix. I will make it again.

I just made this recipe and it was fabulous!  I followed other's advice and sauteed the onion and mushrooms in butter and added a clove of diced garlic and browned the chops lightly in the remaining butter, but other than that, I followed the recipe.  Two cans of cream of mushroom soup makes a perfect gravy which goes great with mashed potatoes.  I have a 10 year old picky eater and an 18 year old that eats me out of house and home and both loved it!  I will absolutely make this recipe again, in fact, I will probably add it to my regular rotation.

This recipe was fabulous.  Very tasty. I only made three pork chops, for my husband and myself, so I just used one can of the Golden Mushroom soup.  I took another reviewers advice, and braised the pork chops (to hold the juice in) first. When braising them I added salt, pepper and just a pinch of rosemary (we all know how great rosemary goes with pork)and I also sauteed the onions before adding them to the soup mixture. This was so delicious, a definite keeper.  Thank You!

This was very good and easy.  I did sprinkle with Tony Chachere's - we like a little more zing.

You know you got a winner when your family eat everything and left nothing for leftovers. I used this recipe along with mashed potatoes and string beans... Can you say, "YUM, YUM!"

The only reason I did not give this recipe 5 stars is because I altered it a bit.  Like others, I sauteed the mushrooms and onion with a bit of garlic in olive oil and butter, adding the garlic at the end so it would not burn.  I then added this to the soup mixture with a bit of milk.  I browned the chops in the same skillet, put them in a casserole, spooned the soup mixture on top and followed the recipe from there.  This is absolutely delicious.  Flavorful and so tender.  My husband loves this and is very picky about his pork chops because so many times they come out dry.  Not a problem with this winner!  Thanks for sharing!

I am used to making this with cream of mushroom soup but I thought I'd try this.  Did not add the mushrooms or onions (used onion powder on the chops, to make it more kid-friendly).  The orangey color of the condensed soup kind of scared me but I continued on.  This is almost as good as using the cream soup.  For taste it is a 4 star, but I am bumping it up to five, as it is more calorie wise than the cream soup.  The golden has half the fat and 40 less calories per can.  It also looks more gravy-like than the cream soup.  Next time I am going to add the mushrooms and onions as stated in the recipe.  (Oh, and I did brown the chops before baking and kept the foil on the entire time).  Thanks for the recipe, will definitely use again!

After looking at the suggested changes, we put some flour on the pork chops and browned them before baking.  We also sauteed the onions and mushrooms.  Turned out great.  Will definitely make this again.

Used 1 can Golden Mushroom and 1 can cream of mushroom and the gravy was excellent.  Would highly recommend brining the pork chops for the best pork flavor then they would be a 5 star.

Loved this recipe! The gravy it makes tasted great over rice, my whole family loved it. I did follow previous reviews and browned the chops salt, paprika, pepper, and garlic powder before I put them in the oven. I also sauteed the onions and mushrooms with minced garlic befor I put them in the oven. Great flavor, will definitely make this one again, thanks for sharing!

The chops were moist and flavorful. I did season them with salt, pepper, garlic powder and season salt before browning them.  I also sauted the onion and mushrooms in 1/4 cup white wine as suggested by others.

Good recipe! I have to admit that I didn't have high hopes after smelling the "golden mushroom soup." Never cooked with it before, and it smelled pretty bad! BUT stick with it, the gravy ends up awesome! The only changes I made to the recipe were to seriously season the pork with S & P, garlic powder and seasoned salt, brown it for a minute or two first as previous reviews suggested, and I added about 1/4 cup of white wine to the onion and mushrooms that I sauted first before baking. Will certainly make again, great over garlic mashed yukon gold mashed potatoes!

Just finished dinner with Golden Pork Chops. Easy to make and delicious to eat. I made a couple changes simply because I didn't want to go to the store. I used a can of sliced mushrooms instead of fresh and I added a 4 oz. can of green chile, because we eat green chile with most everything. Chops came out nice and tender and moist. Served it with Stove Top Pork Stuffing. The family loved it.

I have tried this recipe several times and finally found a way that my family all likes it.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and one can of regular 99% fat free cream of mushroom soup and one can of golden mushroom soop.  Much better with chicken since my pork chops always turned out tough and a little dry. Just baked for 60 minutes instead of 45 to make sure meat was done.  YUMM!

This recipe is great and I can never get enough of it! The only thing I do differently is use pork cuts that have no bones because the meat gets so tender that in the past we've found bone fragments in the sauce. With kids that's a problem. But it's delicious and a big hit with my family.

Great recipe!  Can be prepared on top of the stove by browning the chops first with the onions and a little oil.  Then pour soup mixture and mushrooms over and cover until cooked through.

Normally i am not crazy about "soup" recipes but this one was good.  Maybe it's because it not a cream soup.  Great served with mashed potatoes.

I am a decent cook. I followed this recipe completely. Had to see how it turned out. I used a thick butcher cut chop at room temp. The flavor to me was quite good. However if your knife squeaks when cutting a pork chop it is overcooked. I actually made this 2 nights in a row trying to make it better the second night. The first night I browned it like several posts shared. The second night I just baked them. Still over cooked in my opinion. Any help would be great. A nice moist pork chop can be so good.

I did add some garlic powder to the chops and I am always a little heavy handed with black pepper.   My chops were frozen so I went ahead and added another 15 minutes to the time covered.   They turned out very nice.   I didn't think the gravy was too runny we served it with rice and vegetables.   Entire family enjoyed it and we will make it again.   I didn't salt the chops since the soup has plenty of salt.    I also did not have an onion and it was pouring here, so I used onion powder -pretty heavy- on the chops.   I was tempted to brown the chops, but instead just followed the recipe, my family thought they looked and tasted fine, and this was a lot less mess and work.  Try the recipe as it is first.   This particular soup has a better flavor than the cream soup, try it.

My pork chops were cooked perfectly, but I didn't care for the sauce.  I think a homemade sauce instead of the Golden Mushroom soup would better.  Also the onions were still crispy, so if I used this as a basis again I'd sauted the onions.

We loved it! I cooked this for my grandmother and she said it reminded her of how her mom used to make porkchops. :) It's a really great dish! But If you like a little extra seasoning I would suggest adding about 1/8 tsp. of garlic or lemon pepper.

YUM YUM..This is probably the better mushroom pork recipes out there. I did saute garlic, onions and mushrooms first, then brown the chops in the same pan seasoned with greek seasoning. Baked it as instructed. I love the taste of the golden mushroom soup. Much more richer than the regular cream of mushroom soup. Must try.

Always a hit - I normally double this recipe when I make it; brown the chops first and sometimes use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup mixed with the golden... A very quick and tasty "comfort food" sort of dish. :)

The pork chops were so tender.  I omitted the salt and pepper (accidentally) the second time I prepared this dish, and the soup had enough salt to allow for this omission.

I stopped eating and cooking with condensed soups years ago, when I found out the high sodium content.  But canned soups have gotten healthier and I have fond childhood memories of Campbell's recipes.  This was good, easy comfort food.  My husband was happy, but my kids wouldn't try the gravy/sauce.  Of well, shows times really have changed.

Yummy! Only made a few changes.  Used very thin chops, and entire 1/2 lb of mushrooms, plain cream of mushroom soup and some seasoned salt mix for extra flavor.  Baked for 30 mins. covered and 15 uncovered as directed.   My daughter went back for 3rds after commenting earlier "do I have to eat that?"  Thanks

I just made this for dinner..my 13 year old daughter loved it and the Big Joe had 3 servings :)!!  I added a finely chopped clove of fresh garlic and sauteed the mushrooms, onions and garlic prior to putting those ingredients into the bowl of golden mushroom soup!! I also browned the pork chops before baking all of the ingredients in the oven. It was great, thank you for sharing this recipe!!!

A wonderful meal.   The chops turned out tender and very tasty.  Like so many others I saluted the onion and mushrooms and I also browned the chops in the skillet using the juices from the salute.     I used most of the original ingredients and added garlic and used one can of Cream of Onion instead of two cans of mushroom soup.     Then I added Sheryl’s Baked Potatoes recipe (check it on allrecipes) added one potato for each serving.  They were very good and I simply added peas as a side dish and completed the meal with Biscuits and Merlot.  My wife loved everything!

Loved the base for this recipe!! I am not a fan of golden mushroom soup so just used used regular mushroom soup and sauted the mushrooms and onions like everyone else. I also used two packets of Mushroom gravy mix, assume without this it would be very bland and not a good gravy!! USE GRAVY MIX!!! EXCELLENT!! My family loved it!!

Even my 3 year old son loved this one!  He asked for seconds!  Taking advice from the previous reviews, I sauteed the mushrooms, onion, and some fresh garlic before mixing with the soup to pour over my lightly browned chops.  I only had 4 chops, but I kept the amounts of everything the same because I made mashed potatoes as a side and wanted the "gravy" for over them.  This was really, really good.  I cooked it for 30 mins covered and 10 mins uncovered.  This one will stay in my rotation - thanks!

Loved these chops! The only thing I did different was brown the chops before I put them in the dish to bake them and also sauted the mushrooms and onion after I browned the chops. Otherwise, the whole thing was GREAT! My boyfriend can't wait for me to cook these again.

Tasty, moist, easy. As most people, I tweaked it a little by adding more of some of the ingredients, but not much. Did not saute as some suggested. Just followed directions and it turned out so well that my wife ate her full helping. Served with baked potato (for me) and steamed rice (for her).

I think it was missing the "BAM" element. I will try adding some wine and roasted garlic to it next time I make it. My family loved it just the way it was so I will definitely continue making it. Overall this recipe was very easy to make.

It was ok.  I think the simplicity did this one in.  I'm not quite sure what I would do with this one.  Maybe I'm just not a huge golden mushroom soup person.  The leftovers are still there.  I served with egg noodles and that helped.

I was not a big fan of this recipe, you have to really LOVE onions.  My husband did eat 4 chops though.

Would do this next time without the seasoned salt. We found it gives a funny taste. Good otherwise!

This was a major hit at my house last night and like some others, I did saute the onions along with some fresh garlic and I also browned the chops just a little before popping into oven. Very, very tasty.

Very good.  Made exactly as written (except I only had 3 chops (boneless) so just used one can of soup. Served with mashed potatoes (refrigerator kind), green beans, and rolls.  Talk about an easy to fix, tasty meal!

surprisingly good!  I normally hate recipes that are made with cream of mushroom soup so i was wary about trying one made with golden mushroom soup.  But it was good!  I cooked mushrooms, onions, 4 cloves garlic and a Tbs of Tyhme before mixing with soup mix.  Also browned the chops before baking.

really really good! i used a few canned mushrooms because i didn't have fresh. i didn't use onion because i forgot, but was very good although the meat wasn't as tender as i was expecting from what other reviewers' said it was supposed to be. i served this with homemade mashed potatoes and green beans, the mushroom sauce was a good gravy for the potatoes also, will make again!

I was totally shocked at how good this was. I was looking for an easy recipe and thought this one would do. However, with some homemade mashed potatoes this was very good. This will be a staple in my home from now on.
Made again with cream of mushroom (added some additional flavor) with rice  - still good.

My bf LOVES these!  I haven't heard him go on about anything I've cooked lately as he has about these.  I make them just like the recipe says, almost. I put the pc in the pan, slice onions into rings on top of the chops, then add the mushrooms, then pour the soup on top.  I like to keep the onion in rings so I can easily pick them off.  I can't recommend this recipe enough!

Delicious recipe. The gravy is Fantastic! Pork came out a little tough but I listened to others and seared first. Probably shouldn't have done that. I did add 1/4 t crushed rosemary and 1 t garlic powder to the salt & pepper mix. Also, I sauteed the onions and shrooms in a little butter and white wine before adding to pan. YUM.

Very tasty and easy to make.  Added 1/2 cup sliced cremini mushrooms along with searing the chops and sweating the onion, 3 diced garlic cloves and the other 1/2 cup of button mushrooms prior to mixing with the mushroom soup.  Also added 1 tsp of fresh thyme leaves prior to baking and topped with chopped fresh chives prior to serving on brown rice.  Husband devoured and requested to put recipe on the "often list".

I loved the idea, but took another reviewer's advice and made it all in a pan (browned the chops, sauteed the onions/mushrooms, added 1/2 cup of skim milk to the soup and then added it all together and simmered for 10 minutes until it cooked through).  Served over roasted cauliflower, and it was delicious.  Thanks for the great idea for dinner tonight!

This is a great recipe.  We have been making a similar recipe at our house for years but we make into a scalloped potator recipe.  We add thinly sliced potatoes, diced onion, salt and papper to the pork chops and then cover with the golden mushroom soup.  It is delicious and dinner is all in one pan.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I did make a few changes however.  I doubled the amount of mushrooms because I love them, and I sauteed them with the onions and garlic for a few minutes before adding them to the soup.  I used bone in pork chops, approx 1 inch thick.  Some parts were a little overcooked so next time I will either use thicker cuts or reduce the cooking time.  My husband couldn't get over how delicious they turned out.

I made this for my family and they loved it.... After reading some of the reviews, I made the following changes: I sauteed onions, garlic, and oil in pan and poured into a seperate bowl when done. In the same pan I seared the chops(bone-in) with salt, pepper, and garlic powder on them. Then placed in a deep dish. I covered with the onion-garlic mixture and poured 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup(mixing only one can with milk). It was fabulous! My family devoured it and said the combination of having macaroni and cheese to use the gravy on was wonderful! This is a keeper!

This recipe was not as tasty as I hoped it to be, my husband is not a picky eater, and realy was not thrilled with it, I will try it again with the 6 chops. As I had downsized it to 2 chops, decreased the amount of baking time, and took another veiwers advice to saute the mushrooms, onions, and garlic. I think by doing this it took out some of the moisture. Thanks though, I will try again.

This recipe wasn't outstanding, but it was definitely above average. I fried the chops in oil and onion and then baked in the oven in one tin of cream of mushroom and one tin of those sliced mushrooms in gravy, while adding a handful of sliced fresh mushrooms. The herb for pork is rosemary, so I added some of that to the chops when I was frying them. Delicious and tender.

Excellent recipe. Usually I use c.of mush. soup, but i'd had never tried the golden mush.  It was very good. Definitely need to use a thicker chop.

Excellent!  My husband even complimented on the mushrooms, and he isn't much of a mushroom fan.  My sixteen month-old son could not quit saying, "num, num, num," while chowing down.  The only thing I did differently was to brown them up first like others had suggested.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good and very easy.  I had to change up though because my hubby cannot have condensed soups due to MSG content plus we low carb so I also sub sub for that reason, HERE IS THE SUB: 4 TBL unsalted butter, 1 clove garlic mashed/chopped, 4 TBL of soy flour, 1 1/2 cup of milk and 1 TBL of "Better than Boullion" chicken flavor (no MSG) Melt butter, whisk in flour, add milk and seasoning and some ground pepper.  Also, I did brown the chops in EVOO and sauted onion and mushroom before baking.  Cut down to 30 minutes and it was really good. I love easy meals and this was a hit.

Excellent and Easy!  ....one would dare to saw tooooo easy.....;-)   I used 2 cans of cream of shroom.  I sauteed the onions and shrooms and browned the chops briefly.  Excellent over rice. I would make this again.  delish

Great recipe! I took the advise of others and quickly browned the chops after seasoning them in a bit of garlic powder, salt and fresh ground pepper.  I also butterflied them as I had centre loin chops and they were quite thick.  Once I browned the chops I removed them from the pan and then added a little  bit more  butter and garlic and sauteed the onions and thinly sliced mushrooms.  I didn't have a can of golden just regular and also did used an additional can of cream of celergy and I added 2 scant cans of creamo.  I cooked it covered and removed the cover the last 10 mins or so.  My husband raved about them and was licking the serving spoon so I knew that was a great sign!

I used one cream of celery and one can of cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom as a family member does not care for them. This dish had a fantastic taste! I served four chops with eggs noodles...poured some of the soup on top..delicious!

YUM!! I seasoned the chops with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper.  I carmelized the onions, and put them and the mushrooms on top of the chops, then the mushroom soup, and a little shredded cheddar cheese on the top.  I lowered the heat to 350 and didn't cover the chops.  I cooked for a little over 40 minutes.  The chops came out nice and moist and the gravy was great!!  I served this on udon noodles.  I will surely make this again!!

This recipe was fantastic. We have made it several times now. We have also made it with boneless chicken breast which turned out even better. I served it with rice on the side. The whole family loved it.

Overall, it was an ok meal. Wasn't a huge fan of the mushroom soup but the pork chops were very moist and tender. Might make this again with some revisions to the sauce.

I have been making this receipe for 20 years. I acutally use a can of cream of celery with a can of cream of mushrooms. I pour the mixture over the porkchops and add stuffing mix. My family loves stuffing. Over the years I have used stove top stuffing. I cook the stuffing and then put on top of mixture. My family loves this receipe. My leftover gravy is used for beef stroganoff. I just doctor it up a little.

Very good recipe. Thanks Hallie. I actually simmered the pork chops in my cast iron pan using all the ingredients listed in the recipe. However I did change the soup as I only had one can of cream of mushroom. I also used one can of cream of celery. Most cream soups blend well with flavor. I covered the frying pan and simmered for about an hour. I served the chops and sauce over pasta springs and peas. My family loved how tender and tasty the chops were. Thanks again Hallie. Your recipe is a hit in our house!

Just made this for the family.  They loved it even the picky youngest child ate it.  I used cream of celery soup low fat added a little chicken broth and garlic.  My family is a bunch of garlic lovers. But other than that I kept things the same oh and i sauted the veggies before hand.  Thanks for the recipe i will be making this again.

Simple, used everyday pantry staples, and was a no fuss meal that the hubby enjoyed quite a bit. He asked me to save him a plate for lunch tomorrow. I used 4 chops and cut this in half. Good food. Thanks!

This recipe was good, but 45 minute cook time was too long. The chops ended up dry, but the mushroom gravy it was in was awesome! As recommended by other reviewers, I sauteed the chops with the onions and mushrooms with some minced garlic. Unfortuantely, I cooked them too long. I would try this recipe again too see if I can get it right and end up with moist pork! I do love a challenge! I served this with 4 cheese macaroni and cheese, and man what a duet!

Delicious recipe!  I seared my chops on both sides and that cut the baking time down to about 25 minutes.  I also used a little white wine to loosen up the soups a bit.  I only had one can of golden mushroom and one can of chicken and mushroom and it was delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes and peas!

Very moist!! I too have trouble with hockey puck chops... and stick to shake and bake!!  This recipe changed that!  I used Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom to save on fat/calories and seasoned the chops with seasoned salt rather than the s & p.  Used baby portobella mushrooms... about 1/2 box... this was a nice change!!  Thank you!!

Frequently my pork chops turn out like hockey pucks. So I am on the look out for a way to cook them so they don't dry out and I don't have to use high heat. This recipe was great. I cooked 4 chops, 1 lrg. onion and used 1 can of mushroom soup. They were tender and had a lot flavor. I will make this again.

Basically cut the recipe in half but added the following:
Half of a red bell pepper, chopped
Minced garlic
Add some mile to thin down the cream of mushroom soup
Also as others have mentioned, I browned the chops and sauteed the chopped onion, mushrooms & bell pepper
Results - Very Good

I didn't change anything and this was very good.  UPDATE: I decided to make again using other reviews and it was way better than before. I sauteed the mushrooms,onion and garlic and then browned chops in same skillet and it now gets five stars instead of four.

This was an awesome dish!  I browned the meat and onions first and then followed the rest of the instructions.  The meat was juicy and tender.  My family thought that was the "best gravy" ever.  I served it with potatoes and fresh green beans.  Thanks for sharing.  This is winner! And soooo easy...

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was!  I seasoned the chops heavily with garlic salt and pepper and then browned them both in olive oil.  Then I baked them in the soup, uncovered, for 30 minutes.  They were perfect and the soup made a lovely gravy.  We served over mashed potatoes.  Yum!

I made this last night and it was a hit! I did brown the chops first with a little seasoned salt and Beau Monde seasoning and I used regular COM soup(1 can) and a jar of mushrooms. I covered with foil and it was moist and yummy !! This recipe will go into the rotation!!

If you are looking for quick and easy.  this is it!  I only used 4 pork chops thin cut.   So I scaled down the recipe only used 1 can of the soup and 1/2 an onion, still had lots of gravy.  I cooked for only about 25 mins covered and then about 12 minutes uncovered.

If you're like me and never know what to do with a pork chop, you'll love this one.  Not only for the simplicity, but because it's DELICIOUS.  The Golden Mushroom Soup makes a delicious "gravy"--and if you're not a mushroom lover, don't worry.  My husband hates mushrooms, so I omitted them from the recipe and he loved the chops.  I also browned the pork chops first, then sauteed some red onions & garlic.  Then I combied the soup, onions & garlic, poured it over the chops and baked.  Simple.

This is sooo good. I did the same as some of the other reviews and seasoned and browned the chops. I also sauteed the onion. Served it over mashed potatoes (a must!) and enjoyed! It's great, try it!

This was good. I didn't have any onions so I used a packet of Lipton Onion Soup. The gravy had good flavor, great over mashed potatoes. I would make it again but it's not something I would want often.

I have been looking at this recipe (and others like it) for some time.  My biggest fear was that the sauce would taste overwhelmingly like the cream soup that is used.  I usually avoid recipes that call for too much cream soup because of this.  That being said, this recipe is AWESOME.  I sauted the onion and garlic with a can of chopped mushrooms in 1 tbsp of butter - putting the garlic in last and removing from the heat since garlic doesn't need much to soften it.  I set it aside and browned the  chops (seasoned with a little garlic powder and pepper) in the same pan - just a couple of minutes on each side to brown.  I transferred the chops to a glass baking pan, topped with the sauted veggies, then topped that with ONE can of cream of mushroom soup.  Covered and baked at the temperature stated.  My chops took less time to cook, but my oven may be off.  Absolutely delicious!  Thank you for the recipe!  I will definately be making these again!

I followed what other reviewers had suggested.  browned an onion, some garlic together with mushrooms, then added condensed soup (and can of milk), set the sauce aside.  Then quickly browned chops in bit of olive oil, covered in sauce and slammed in the oven.  Had it over rice, was pretty good.

GREAT!! My husband loves pork chops and thought this was one of the better recipes I've tried. We've had it many times and like it the way it is. Some times I've added thyme, basil, parsley, oregano and rosemary and it's still wonderful! Definitely a keeper!

This is one of the easiest recipes and the golden mushroom soup makes the tastiest gravy.  I serve it over rice and my whole family asks for seconds.  I add extra slices of mushrooms and mix in a 1/2 cup of water to the gravy prior to baking.  This is a regular at our house.  Thank you for sharing this quick and easy recipe!

These porkchops were flavorful and delicious! They are fast and super easy to make. The juices and soup create a wonderful gravy that is great on mashed potatoes. I have made this recipe a few times and I will continue to do so. :)

I have made this for years.  My husband loves it, and it is easy!  I have added fresh mushrooms and more or less onions depending on what I have available or feel like doing.  I have substituted sirloin steaks (tenderized or not) and chicken breasts for the pork.  I also always use boneless meat.  I just don't like dealing with bones when serving a sauce.  We serve this with egg noodles, rice, or even baked potatoes (using the gravy as a topper with our sour cream and butter).  It is definately not low sodium, though.

I loved this.  It was really easy and did not take much time to prepare.  I will say that my husband liked it and I will make it again.  I ate some of the leftovers for lunch today and actually it was better the second day due to the sauce flavored the pork chops more.  Great!!

Really easy!  My husband loved it, but it was a little too oniony for my taste.  Adjust onion accordingly because you really do taste it.  Also, we love mushrooms and added a whole container of fresh mushrooms -- delicious!

It tasted good, and it would also be good with cream of mushroom soup.  There is a lot of left over gravy from this, so eat it with bread or rice- that also tates good!

I think I would have like this better with regular cream of mushroom soup.  I didn't like the flavor of the golden mushroom soup all that well.

This recipe was delicious in my opinion.  The only change I made was to brown the pork chops a bit before baking, just for presentation.  Both my roomate and I loved it.  I will be making this one again!

This recipe was easy and tasted great! Like any recipe you will adjust it to your palette.  We like extra onions and mushrooms. I used an extra can of the Golden Mushroom soup, it made a nice “gravy” for the mashed potatoes I served this with.  Love Allrecipes!

Use a deeper dish or better yet a foil pan for easy cleanup. My 6 chops were of medium thickness and I only used 1 can of Golden Mushroom soup and it boiled over just a bit. ( I always have some heavy duty aluminum foil on the bottom of my oven)  I also added some fresh diced plum tomatoes along with the sliced mushrooms and a generous splash of white wine. Very simple recipe but the flavor of the sauce was really good. I would make this again.

Great recipe. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used fresh mushrooms sautéed with onion & garlic in olive oil, and I browned the seasoned chops after removing the veggies. The whole family gave this recipe 5 stars. This definitely goes on our regular rotation of meals!

Definitely a keeper! My fiancé is a picky eater, and this recipe was the first time I heard him say "you'll have to make this one again!" Pork chops aren't a huge favorite of mine, but this recipe is juicy and flavorful. It tastes best with fresh mushrooms, but it's still pretty good with canned if that's all you have on hand.

This recipe was just ok....I added some garlic powder and a little bit of milk to the sauce just to thin it out a bit. My husband and I both ate it, but it was nothing to rave about. He said I could make it again, maybe in a year. Lol

AS written this recipe is only a 3.  Browning the meat before baking makes a huge difference and is well worth the extra time and effort.  I brown the meat in 2-3 batches in a cast iron skillet, deglaze the pan with a small amount of white wine, then add back all the ingredients, cover the skillet with foil and pop into the oven.

My mom used to make a mushroom gravy/pork recipe when I was young and I absolutely love it! I have been trying to replicate it for the past several years now and I think this recipe is the closest I've come. It is fantastic; absolutely fantastic! I made it exactly as the recipe suggests, except I added extra salt and that was not needed AT ALL! Make this just the way it's presented and you'll be happy. Thanks for this. I think I can stop looking now.

very good and easy.  i browned the chops first and the last 10 min added some cubed sage and onion stuffing -pepperidge farms to soak up the cr of mushroom soup.  roger said really good and a lot cheaper than stove top stuffing--i used 2 chops and 1 can of cr of mushroom soup.  served with mixed veg and cranberry sauce.

Awesome. I omitted the mushrooms since I didn't have them on hand and pan fried the pork chops on the stove top because I was low on time and it turned out great.

I liked this recipe.  Its a variation of one I usually use, but the golden mushroom soup made quite a difference.  I took the advice of one reviewer and fried, then simmered the pork chops in my electric frypan.  I also breaded this in fryin' magic instead of just salt and pepper.  Wonderful.

This recipe was very good, my whole family loved it!  Next time I may brown them on the stove first, and add some extra seasoning.  Other than that, they were great!! The onions and mushrooms make a good gravy for rice or potatos.

These are so good!  I didn't have fresh mushrooms, so I just left them out, but it was still wonderful!  My husband really liked this too!  I rubbed the seasoned salt and the pepper into the pork on both sides. I almost left out the seasoned salt because I didn't have any, but then I made my own- I am so glad I didn't leave it out! Delicious!

I added creme of mushroom soup and water as well.  Water made the gravy less thick and we ate it with rice.  The boys loved it.

Pretty good.  Both my daughter and husband loved it-  although it did have too much sauce.  I may try again with more suggestions from other reviewers.

not too bad, needs some tweeking IMHO.  pork chops should be browned a bit prior to adding to baking dish otherwise the meat is stark white and weird looking.

Pork chops came out really well.  The sauce was very thin, not sure why it came out like that.  All in all it was a good meal.

I didn't have any golden mushroom soup, so just used regular cream of mushroom. I used 1/2 of a purple onion and didn't add any mushrooms because I didn't have any. I also added about 1/4 cup of cooking sherry. It turned out great! I think it would have been even better if I'd had all the ingredients needed. My husband and I loved it!

I have made this as is but prefer it with hamburger patties. brown the patties in a regular pan so that you can scrape the carmelized meat juices then wisk the soup in and simmer until patties are cooked through. Not very healthy but we can eat veggies tomorrow!!

Good recipe - I would advise NOT using thin chops in this recipe as they overcook by the time the sauce is hot.  I ended up using 1 Golden mushroom and 1 Cream of mushroom which left the sauce a tad bland for my tastes but if I were to use just the golden mushroom it would have been much better.  I also did this in the skillet rather than baking it.

Melt in your mouth tender! After browning chops, I drained off some of oil and then used about 3/4 cup white wine to deglaze. Also used the Golden Mushroom soup. The white wine adds more depth of flavor. Family loves it!

i accidentally used cream of mushroom soup instead and it was still REALLY good. cream of mushroom soup is a little thick though, so i poured some chicken broth into the mixture to thin it out. so if u dont have golden mushroom soup handy, cream of mushroom soup is A-OK! i also slivered some garlic and put it on top of the porkchop. great recipe!

This was really good.   Next time I will saute the onions and mushrooms before baking, the onions were too strong for us, as they still seemed almost raw.  The golden mushroom soup is really good!

I did this in an electric fryer. I personally think that pork chops should at the very least be browned on the stove top before being transferred to the oven, but I only used the fryer for this recipe. I first sauted the onions, added the mushrooms then browned the chops, added the golden mushroom, and put a little honey in as well. I also threw a lot of minced garlic and garlic powder in because I'm crazy about it. Not my favorite pork chop recipe, but I have made this on a few occasions. I'm crazy about pork chops so I have to switch it up!

Made it with cream of mushroom soup and it was great.  Didn't have the fresh mushrooms, but that was okay...I saute'd some onions and added it with the soup, added a little water to thin it out a bit and I was good to go.  Made some brown rice and spinach.  Didn't have enough gravy so I made some and added it to the cream of mushroom soup, it was still great.  Thanks for posting.

I loved these. I have made them exactly like the recipe and I have changed it up a bit. Try adding a few crumbled strips of bacon before baking. Or about 1/2 cup sour cream to the sauce right before serving, it's great any way you do it. Golden Mushroom soup is now more of a staple in my house than cream of mushroom. I use it in lots of recipes now!!

I loved the sauce but the pork itself didnt have much flavor and was a bit dry even with the seasoning salt & pepper.

This is a great idea, but I did as one user suggested and browned the chops first, then added the soup and just simmered in the pan. They stayed very tender and juicy.

Delicious just like it is. Doesn't need anything. Used abodo instead of seasoned salt, and canned mushrooms. My picky husband said "Delicious" as soon as he took a bite. He never says that....

Yummy!  The kids even had seconds. Didn't read the reviews fast enough so I only browned the chops and used canned mushrooms.  Every thing else was the same.

super easy recipe. I browned the chops on high in some EVVO and then sauted the vegetables in the oil and 2 tbsp of butter. I think some added wine would make this recipe a 6 star!

Pretty good.  I did follow some other suggestions and browned the pork chops first and used onion and canned mushrooms with garlic sauted in butter.  Other than that, followed the recipe.  The pork chops were really tender and this was easy to make.  Served with rice.

This was great.  I didn't have seasoning salt, so I rubbed paprika, coarsely ground pepper, and kosher salt into the meat.  The onions were doubled and sauteed until carmelized before stirring into the mushroom soup.

My fiance and I loved this and would definitely make it again.  We added a tablespoon of minced garlic to the sauce but other than that, followed the recipe as stated.  The meat was so tender, the sauce had a great flavor and it was so easy to make.  Overall, top notch!

I don't usually review recipes, but I had to post how great this one was! I followed it almost exactly, with the exception of browning the pork chops before putting them in the oven and replacing one of the cans of golden mushroom with cream of mushroom. The gravy was awesome served over rice. The entire family loved it, which is saying a lot for us!

This was GREAT! My boyfriend couldn't get enough of it. After seasoning and pan frying the chops for a few minutes, I simmered 1 can of golden mushroom soup. I added the mushrooms and added some milk. I placed the chops in a deep baking dish and pour the sauce over, placed a lid on top. I perfer my pork chops to be baked in the oven completly covered by the sauce for extra tenderness. I use a simular recipe w/ cream of mush soup but this stuff is MUCH better! Doesnt look very pretty but it is the best chops our family has ever eaten.

My family loved this. I improvised a little. I used dried minced onion instead of real onion with some garlic powder along with the other seasonings it said to use. Also mixed 1 can Golden Mushroom and Cream of Mushroom Soup. My husband told me to definately hold on to this one.

I find that one can golden mushroom, and one can regular mushroom soup, mixed with two chopped cloves of garlic, is best.  15 minutes before I serve these, I remove the top and add frozen peas thawed, then replace the top and turn oven off. serve within ten to fifteen minutes. I like to serve this with garlicy mashed potatoes.

Split decision on this one...Pros: Quick, easy,tastey and required few ingredients...Cons: Recipe didn't specify when and where to add the seasoned salt and pepper.  It was good but not outstanding; perfect for a quick weekday meal.  I seasoned the pork chops and seared them in a frying pan before putting them in the oven.

This rates at least a 4 & 1/2. The flavors are wonderful & the meat gets so tender.  It's almost too easy of a recipe to get such great results!!

Used cream of onion (what I had on hand) and the recommendations of the reviewers and this was great. Would definitely use cream of mushroom next time, the onion was a little sweet, and served it over rice which was perfect.

Loved them!  I too sauted the mushrooms, onions and I used fresh garlic in a little bit of olive oil.  Then browned the chops and seasoned them up in the same pan.  Threw it all in a baking dish and voila, they were delicious!  Super moist and tender!

I would definitely follow the other suggestions in pan frying the pork prior to cooking the casserole. I also think 2 cans of soup is too much, we lost a lot of onion and mushroomsn in the excess gravy. Adding fresh mushrooms, garlic and onion gave it a nice flavor but scale back on the canned soup and this is a winner.

Delish! This is a regular meal at our house. It is extremely easy. I always add alittle more seasoning. Such as dried parsley, oregano, garlic, Tony Chacheres' and whatever else I'm "feeling" that day.

Not a bad way to try pork chops, but not something we liked much.  MIGHT make again, but not anytime soon.

This was okay... I first browned the meat on both sides, and then added some milk to the soup before baking for nearly an hour. It was too soupy, so I had to thicken it with some flour and water mix. then it was delicious! The family felt it was normal okay.

Good recipe.  I used 1 can of Cream of Mushroom and 1 can of Golden Mushroom,the onion and the fresh sliced mushrooms.  I sauteed the fresh mushrooms with the onions, 1 tsp of garlic and some olive oil.  Had it with Sauteed Asparagus and mashed potatoes. It was good.  Will make it again!

My fiance' and I absolutly Love this recipe. I did also add, 1/2 cup chicken stock, 1 bouillon cube, some sherry wine, crushed red pepper to the can of mushroom soup. Seasoned the pork chops with sea salt, pepper, and Seared the pork chops, on both sides. Pour the can of mushroom mixture into the casserole add the pork chops, then the saute' with the onions and fresh mushrooms mixture. Bake with lid on for 45 minutes, take lid off, I would like to add the French's fried onion strips to the top and let it get crispy. Yummy!! I would also serve this with fresh green beans, and angel hair, with gatlic and oil!!

This is a great easy weeknight main dish. In the name of speed, ease, and fewer dirty dishes,  I just put the chops in the baking pan then layered the remaining ingredients on top. 

I added a touch of dry minced garlic and used an 8 oz. container of crimini mushrooms. 

I'm sure this would be even better if you browned the chops first, but it was so good with my easy method that I doubt I will ever make the extra effort.

This was really good! I always have dried out chops when I cook them on the stove so I wanted to try and bake them.  I ended up using Cass68 method (Dec. 1)  Except I only had 2 chops so I used one can of soup.  Hubby was licking his lips so I knew he liked it!  This will be a regular. My 16 month old at most of my chop so I will make lots next time.

Cooked exactly as described and I think I shouldn't have added water to the condensed mushroom soup. I don't think you were supposed to, but I didn't know any better. They were tasty and the sauce was good over mashed potatoes, but I would probably do what others did and brown them on a pan with spices since they were a tad bland. Will probably try again in the future though since they were super easy to prepare for a college student.

I thought this was an excellent dish.  I seasoned the pork chops liberally with seasoning salt and pepper and then proceeded to follow the recipe.  I didn't have any fresh mushrooms, but they weren't missed.  I had to cook the chops longer than the recipe stated; about 30 extra minutes to be exact.  But it was worth the wait!

Wonderful dish. I did do some changes and followed others direction to braise the chops and saute the onions in butter. I didn't have mushrooms and added red pepper. I also added garlic, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2cup white wine to the soups mixture. My family had seconds and mom even licked the plate, literally. This is a keeper.

These turned out great, a nice new way to make pork chops! I did saute the mushrooms and onions first in some butter, adding some chopped garlic towards the end. I browned the pork chops before putting them in the oven. I only used 1 1/2 cans of soup and that seemed to be more than enough. Will be making this again!

Hmm.  Where to start.  I even went back and checked to see if I had messed something up.  I hoped I had.    I didn't.  I followed the recipes to a T- except I used cream instead of golden.  Too much soup.  The chops were swimming in it.  Pretty easy - and it tastes like it.

A bit skeptic at first, It was a surprise.  Like mentioned before, I don't like to change a lot of ingredients until I have at least tried it once and my family liked it.  I admit that I did brown the chops first.  A great recipe for busy evenings as it can be prepared ahead and then bake later.

I sauteed the mushrooms and caramelized the onions. No matter what you do, it just taste like pork covered with golden cream of mushroom. I gave it one star because the pork chops were tender. Won't make again.

This was a very good recipe!  I made it exactly as written except used thinly sliced chops (since that's all I had on hand) and didn't cook them quite as long.  But the chops were still extremely tender and the gravy was awesome over mashed potatoes!  Super easy and tastes great!

I really enjoyed these pork chops. I did saute my onions and mushrooms with some garlic before mixing into the golden mushroom soup. I seasoned my pork chops thoroughly with black pepper and then browned them also. I only had 4 chops so there was way more sauce than necessary, but it's great over mashed potatoes. I'll definitely make this recipe again, it's super yummy and easy.

We loved this one. I also sauteed the onions with adding garlic powdered. And then in the same pan, browned the pork and seasoned the pork with garlic powder and pepper. I used one can of cream of mushroom soup to which I added about 1/2 cup milk. I served this with frozen green beans which went perfectly with the mushroom soup all over them. Will make again. Rena

This recipe was so good! I generally don't like it when people rate recipes than change the whole thing. However, I did not have 2 cans of mushroom soup, and I did have some marsala wine that I don't know what else do to with. So I added a splash of water and a splash of wine to the 1 can of soup I had. I cut up potatoes and put them in as well and it was absolutely delicious and a keeper! Thanks!

I make this recipe all the time - well something a little more simple and we've been eating it for years.  My entire family loves it.  I use 1 can cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic, one can of milk, salt & pepper and Italian Seasoning.  I bake it at 350 for about an hour to get it really bubbly.  Soooo simple!!  The onion and mushrooms sound good in there too - but it's a little more time and there are some mushrooms in the soup.  Point is - either way is delicious and my way is good in a pinch and their way is good if you want a little more flavor and have a little more time.

I liked this recipe a lot! However, I followed someone's tip about using one can golden mushroom, one can cream of mushroom.  Also, because I don't like pork, I used turkey chops instead. Everything else in the recipe, I followed to a T.  I only give 4-stars because I found it a little salty, even though it was EXTREMELY tasty.  I served it with roasted red skin potatoes and green beans.

Its a good start and very easy to make but a little bland.  Could use a bit more flavor.  Using low sodium version of soup could be reason for bland taste.

I was a little skeptical but it had a lot of flavor.  I used cream of celery because that was all I had on hand.  Also I didn't cook mine as long as suggested.  I will definately make again!

I did as others, sauteed onions and mushrooms with some fresh garlic and then browned the meat in the same pan. I didn't have golden mushroom, so I used cream of mushroom. This meal was good...even my picky 3 year old like it.

This turned out a little more soupy than I had thought, but the result tasted good.  I had taken another reviewers idea of adding garlic that was sauteed into the dish.

Fabulous!  My husband and I loved it!  One of our new years resolutions was to try at least 4 new recipes a month so we have had alot of fun this year.  This was so easy and wonderful.  The gravy it made was great on mashed potatoes!  It is definately a keeper.

I would have to say that this is one of the better meals I've taken off of this site! It was really tasty and my husband liked it too. I hate to say it though but I also have to say that I changed the recipe. I took the advice of others and browned the meat before hand after seasoning it. But I didn't have onions and I didn't have mushrooms so I used the condensed mushroom soup and onion soup and mixed that together and added that on top of the porkchops. Then put that in the oven for about 30-45 min. Would definitely recommend this one!! The soups together made an EXCELLENT gravy for both the chops and the mash potato (and I'm not much of a gravy lover!)Thanks! Great recipe will definitely use it again!

It's a keeper!  Made the sauce go a little farther by adding a bit of dry white wine.  We also used a whole pound of mushrooms; we just really like mushrooms.  Also added slash of Lea & Perrins per other's suggestion.  Served chops and sauce over sour cream mashed potatoes.  Husband loved this dish.

I like this recipe. But I made a couple of changes, I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of the salt garlic, didn't use too much salt just a little, instead of only useing a half of onion I used a hole one because there very good for you and I love them. Real garlic is very good for you as well. I used one can of the golden mushroom soup and 1/3 cup of water and mixed it up and poored it over the, porkchops, garlic and onion(s). My 3 year old loves it too.

Tried this and I am not a fan of how salty it seemed to be.  I only bought one golden mushroom soup by accident so I used cream of mushroom as a sub but followed all else and it was ok, but don't think I will try again.

Simple, Quick, and Deeeeeelicious. This recipe has become a fast favorite at my house.  I usually cook for an additional 15 minutes to ensure the pork chops are litterally "falling off the bone".  Cleanup is a snap. Just what I need after a 10 hour work day.

This recipe is super quick and soo easy. I used a small can of canned mushrooms since I didn't have fresh, and substituted dried minced onion for fresh. 
It was VERY good, my whole family loved it. The chops were very tender, and the gravy had a great taste. 
I served this with mashed potatoes, and it doesn't make quite enough gravy for that, so I think I would use 3 cans of soup next time.

I made it for my husband and left it for him to cook (sorry, but I went out and didn't try it) and he said he really liked it, but the pork chops were a little tough.  Next time I would cook in a covered skillet on the stovetop instead.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I both thought the taste couldn't be beat.  If you don't have fresh mushrooms, the sliced canned variety works also.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

This was delicious.  My teenage daughter had friends over and they all loved it as well.  So much for picky eaters!!  The only thing I did different was that I added one envelope of dry golden onion soup mix to the golden mushroom soup and mixed it well before pouring it over the chops.

Great recipe! It's super easy but tastes really good.  There's plenty of sauch to put over potatoes or pasta (egg noodles would be good!) I used the Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom Soup to reduce calories - it was delicious.

this recipe was super easy to make...i used cream of mushroom instead, which i believe has more salt content than that mushroom soup. so i would recommend not seasoning the chops beforehand - ours came out a bit on the salty side but otherwise, it was delicious. we had it with a simple tomato salad (tomatoes, olives, vidalia onions, zesty italian dressing) and some flaky dinner croissants. i would definitely make this again!

THIS RECIPE IS PERFECT AS IS!!! HOWEVER, I ADDED 8 OZ. SLICED BABY BELLA MUSHROOMS.  YUMMY GRAVY DELICIOUS OVER MASHED POTATOES.  MY HUSBAND SAYS THIS IS DEFINITELY A KEEPER AND I MUST AGREE.  LOVELY DISH TO SET OUT FOR COMPANY, TOO.

good recipe..I used campbell soup select creamy portabella mushroom soup.  I reconstituted 1oz of dried porcini mushrooms and used about 2cups of that broth.  I also seared the chops in butter on both sides prior to baking...Absolutely yummy....

A very delicious and no fuss meal. I did add a 1/2 cup of milk with the mushroom soup to give it a creamier texture. The chops came out very tender.

This recipe turned out really good for me.  I did brown the chops in a skillet a couple minutes on each side - I rubbed them with thyme and pepper, and browned them in olive oil and garlic.  Thanks for the great recipe.

The best pork chop recipe that I have come across so far. I did brown them first by using olive oil spray with minced garlic. Just a minute or two for each side, then followed the recipe exactly. I made two packages which was 12 pork chops and my husband absolutely loved them. I never used golden mushroom soup before and I'm glad that I did because it was very good. Be very careful not to over cook and you won't be disappointed.

This recipe was very good. I made a few changes though, I used cream of mushroom soup instead of the golden mushroom soup and I added a small can of mushrooms. I also browned the pork chops before hand. I served this with wild rice.

These pork chops were okay-- nothing special.  They did get very tender, but the sauce just seemed like glorified cream of mushroom.

Pretty good. I used boneless butterfly chops and they were done in about 45 minutes total. Way too much onion, though! Next time I will use much less.

A nice change from cream of mushroom soup (which my husband hates).  I used 8 oz. of pre-sliced mushrooms and only 1/2 a med. onion. Served it over wide egg noodles, which my 6-year-old loved. However, my husband is on a no-carb diet and said the pork chop as a stand-alone was a little boring.  But adding the gravy to rice or noodles makes it good and homey.

WE loved it.  I didnt have two cans of mushroom soup, just one, but I did have fresh mushrooms, so I cheated a little.  The rest of the recipe I followed to a tee.  Huge Hit!  I made fresh glazed carrots, and mashed potatoes.  Very good comfort food.

Yes, I added apple cider vinegar and olive oil on the bottom to the mix and it gave it a nice subtle flavor.

I wasn’t all that crazy about the seasoning and thought it was  a little on the bland side. I have other recipes that are better and I am refining my recipes in each category and for the pork category, this didn't make the cut.

I will definitely make this again.  The only ingredient change I made was to add a little Frank Hot Sauce to the gravy.  Also, I cooked it on low on the stovetop  for about an hour and a half after browning the seasoned meat, onions, and mushrooms.  It came out very tender.  A pleasant change from recipes using Cream of Mushroom soup.

I make this frequently in my slow cooker and we love it.  I pretty much stick to the recipe, other than that I coat the chops liberally with seasoning salt and pepper, no measuring.  I put half the soup mixture in the bottom of the cooker, add the chops then spread the rest of the soup on top.  I cook on Low for 8 hours and we end up with the most flavorful, tender pork chops ever.  If I want gravy, I remove the chops and stir a roux into the the soup.  Perfect!

Seasoned my chops with garlic, salt and pepper. Sprinkled chopped onion over the chops, I used both fresh mushrooms and canned, didn't have cream of mushroom soup because I don't really care for it. Instead I sprinkled a packet of pork gravy mix over them, then poured a half cup of water over all of it. Baked at 350 for 45 minutes.

I've made this with pork chops and chicken.  Like the others I put my own spin on it.  I sauteed the mushrooms in onion, olive oil, butter, worchestershire sauce, marsala wine and cooking sherry.  I then cut up the chicken into 1 inch pieces (leave pork chops whole).  I then season the meat with my "Texas Roadhouse" steak rub (recipe on copykat.com), paprika, granulated garlic (it's stronger), a little salt, pepper, chile powder and Tony Cachere's seasoning.  I add the soup to the mushrooms and then the chicken to the entire mixture.  I let it cook about 15 to 20 minutes.  I then serve it over white rice.  OMG!  It is so good and so filling.  You don't even need a side dish.  Now, Hawaiian sweet rolls would be good.  The chicken is tender and you can cut it with a fork.  You have to try!

I thought this recipe was ok. I did make some changes like searing the meat then sauteing the mushrooms and onions before putting it together and baking. The next time I make it I will use one can golden mushroom and one can cream of mushroom and will not bake it as long as I found it to be too dry for me.

I was disappointed that the pork chops were rather tough. That said, the sauce is a keeper and could be used in other dishes.

I made this to a t and I nor my husband was thoroughly impressed. When he took the first few bites he looked at me and asked if I was feeling okay. We agreed it lacked flavor and needed something extra almost like it was missing a seasoning. We ended up putting parsley and some Cajun spices in it. With out all it tasted like was pork and cream of mushroom soup which I had seen coming. With some minor touches it turned into a great meal.

Made 4 thick chops, browned them first, added sliced onion and one can mushroom soup. Put all in oven for an hour. Pork chops were hard as rocks. Maybe not a fault of the recipe but I would not make it again

I have made this almost to the Tee ( even before I came across this recipe )
 I did like most, seasoned the chops with salt & pepper, a little thyme, and garlic powder. I did a hot quick sear on the stove first. after removing the meat, place it in a baking dish and quickly into the oven. 
 sauté the onions, fresh minced garlic, and mushrooms (I like shiitake mushrooms) in the same pan. add the mushroom soup just to blend and pour over the chops. cover and bake for 30 minutes at 375° (may vary depending on thickness of the chops). 
I have served this w mashed potatoes using the reserved "gravy", over Jasmine rice, and over egg noodles.
turned out perfectly juicy every time! everyone loved them !!

My family loved it.  I took the suggestions and browned them before baking, but only took half the time because I used thin pork chops.  My family get tired of the same breaded pork chops I make, even though they are good, so I decided to try this recipe and glad I did.

My husband said it was really good.  The gravy was so good on the rice.  I think next time I'll brown the pork chops and cook it longer on 350 to make the chops fall apart.

This was very good. Of course I made some changes. 
I floured and seasoned the chops and browned them in a bit of oil. I didn't use onion and I used canned mushrooms. 
I didn't want a lot of the sauce so I used just 1 can of golden mushroom soup. It was plenty. My family loved this and is a keeper.

A big hit with my family! My youngest son said he would eat pork chops like this every time. Like some reviewers, I did flour and brown the chops first in a little oil. Since I did brown the chops, I cooked them in the oven for only 1/2 hour, and they were cooked perfectly.  The second time I made these, I made more golden mushroom gravy so there would be plenty to put over mashed potatoes. This one's a keeper for me. :)

I didn't have golden mushroom soup, but had cream of mushroom in the pantry. I know, totally different but wanted others to know with the same situation as me! lol 
I browned the seasoned chops in the pan, sauteed onions, garlic and mushrooms then added 2 cans of condensed cream of mushroom + 1/2 cup of milk. Then followed the oven instructions! It's yummy!

Unfortunately I did not care for the taste of this at all and did not like the looks of it either. After making it exactly as stated and not liking it, I attempted to doctor it up with some cream of mushroom soup and various spices to make it edible.I'm giving it two stars just because I was able to fix it so my family would eat it. Will not make again.

Oh my these were definitely one of the best pork chop recipes I've tried!!  I didn't even realized I "screwed up" the recipe until later when I saw I was supposed to use golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom.  My fiance said... whatever I did, DO IT AGAIN.  I also browned the pork chops (seasoned with salt & pepper) in some butter and the onions & mushrooms along with some minced garlic.  I adjusted the recipe for 2 but still used a whole can of soup and upped the mushroom quantity by a lot (we love mushrooms!).  Baked for 1/2 hour a little cooler for 1/2 hour (350 covered, flipped the chops and turned the oven up the last 10-15 minutes and uncovered.  Making these again tonight and will experiment with some additional seasonings!

It was ok. Not a lot of real flavor to it, I felt. Simple and quick to prep, just needs cooking time. I probably will find other ways to make my chops in the future.

I love this recipe.  I made a few adjustments. I didn't hsve golden mushroom soup or mushrooms, so I used cream of chicken with herbs.  Also added a teaspoon of minced garlic and garlic powder. Oh!  And I added about 5 ounces of chicken broth.  Turned out absolutely delicious.  If you don't want thin gravy/sauce, don't add the chicken broth.

These chops were good and tender.  The soup gives the chops and gravy a rich beefy taste.

Super easy and delicious.  Had sliced, baby portabella mushrooms and can of 95% fat free mushroom soup on hand and used those.  DH gave 2 thumbs up. Made baked potatos at same time and served with cooked carrots.

My family thought this recipe was pretty good.  I made it as directed and have to say that the condensed soup didn't impress us much.  We had never tried it before and I suppose it's just an aquired taste, but I hate rating recipes without trying it as directed and then with my own tweaks.  The only thing I did differntly my way was I used cream of mushroom soup instead and left out the salt (trying to watch our sodium).  We liked it MUCH better.  Will be keeping this recipe for future meals!!

Good comfort food!  I served it over noodles with a fresh garden salad on the side.  The only I thing I would do differently next time is to add chopped garlic and maybe a vegetable like zucchini.

These pork chops are very tender and flavorful. I would recommend pairing with potato or rice to soak up a bit of the gravy. I also pair this with wilted spinach. It's great together. I couldn't find golden mushroom, so I always use a regular can of cream of mushroom soup.  These are great pork chops!!

THE VERY BEST OF THE BEST.  My family loved this.  Even the 14 year old who doesn't care for pork chops.  We put the gravy over noodles...yummy.  Definately brown the pork chops & saute the onion and mushrooms a little first.  Thanks for the great recip!!!

Awesome, my husband loved this recipe the most. I did do like other reviewers and "brown" the pork before I baked it with the sauce. I browned it with EVOO and a little balsamic and garlic. Then poured the sauce over it and baked for 45 mins. Even my 2 year old loved it! Great recipe.

My husband and I both loved this recipe.  I did brown the chops and saute the mushrooms before I baked them.  The only difference was I forgot to buy the onion so that was missing.  I'm sure the taste would be a little different with the onion but we liked it without too.  I had never even heard of Golden mushroom soup so I was reluctant to use it but I am so glad that I just followed the recipe and didn't exchange for Cream of Mushroom soup like I planned.  Thanks for sharing.

Way too much sauce for my liking. The mushroom soup was too overpowering. My husband liked it (again, he'll eat anything). My three year old and I, however, did not finish what we served ourselves. I am rating it a four, because my husband thought it to be delicious.

These were really good!  I didn't fuss with pan searing them first .. just rub all your favorite seasonings on both sides, place in the pan and add the soups!  I skipped out on the onion - but did add mushrooms!  Really good!  Thanks!

This receipe GREAT and very tender! Because I have semi-picky kids I used 1 can of golden mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of chicken and mushroom (this is 1 can but both flavors). It mellows out the mushroom flavor for kids taste buds :)

I made these last night with a couple of variations.  I seasoned the chops with lots of black pepper and a little salt.  I used one can of soup instead of two and thinned it with some chicken stock.    I thought they turned out ok my husband liked them and we have great leftovers for lunch today.

This was a pretty easy meal to make although I made several changes to the recipe.  I added chicken broth to the soup and seasoned with worcestershire sauce, red wine and a small amount of powdered gravy mix.  The fresh mushrooms were sauteed with garlic and onions also seasoned with worcestershire sauce. red wine, salt & pepper.  I added this to the pork chops prior to putting in the oven.  I served over noodles with candied carrots.  Hope this helps generate new ideas.

I thought it was just okay.  Don't get me wrong, I love cooking with cream of mushroom however it was a tad on the creamy mushroomy side.  It was good but not all that in my opinion.  I tried it by cooking it in butter, onions and garlic with a little salt and pepper and then adding the cream of mushroom with a little milk to ease down the creamy side.  Up to you, you will either love it or just find it okay like I did.  But always worth a try.

I also added sauteed onion, fresh mushrooms and 2 cloves of garlic.  I would have *sworn* I had a can of golden mushroom, but when I couldn't find it, I opted for a can each of chicken/mushroom and French onion soup.  It made a lot of gravy, but it was a hit with my husband.  Served with white rice and mustard greens.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I followed the advise of  browning the meat on the stove and then putting it in the oven.  It was great.  I never eat pork chops or mushrooms but this recipe was excellent.  Thank you!!

Great recipe. The whole family loved it. I took the suggestion from another review and cooked the garlic, mushrooms, and onions the browned the pork chops in the same pan. Came out great.

I made this for my husband last night and he loved it!  I browned the chops with a little seasonsed salt in a butter/olive oil mixture to give it extra flavor.  I also mixed a little seasoned salt into the soup mixture.  These were fork tender and the leftovers were just as tasty the next day!

Whoever gave this recipe a low rating, probably has a hard time reheating leftovers.  It was simple & great.  My husband doesn't even like pork chops but he liked this.  I did saute the onions & mushrooms with garlic.  I also used the roasted garlic cream of mushroom (only 1 can) with some milk.  I only used 4 chops maybe I would of used 2 cans with 6.  I used low sodium seasoning salt, it was quick, simple & great tasting.  A keeper.

Turned out great. I browned the chops as recommended and had to use Cream of Mushroom with Garlic, as I couldn't find the golden.  Turned out fine. A definite 
"do-again"

Pork chops are not a favorite in my house but this recipe has changed that! This now a much loved addition to the rotation of meals. I did follow other reviews and browned the chops first. But other than that I don't think it needs much else. It's great!

We make this recipe but add hominy into the golden mushroom soup mixture. This is really good. We also dredge the pork chops in a flour mixture first and brown them before adding the soup. It is soooo good.

Very good!!
I followed alot of advise the other chefs offered, but I triedcoating the chops in flour then browning. I decided that really wasn't nessasary just browning in butter would surfice. My family rated this recipe a 4 !/2 Star. So did I.

Not as tender or tasty as I thought it would be.  I would rather do a quick fry with seasoning.

According to my children this was "the bomb"!! (that's a GOOD thing!).  We really enjoyed these.  I didn't change a thing except for browning the chops a bit before baking.  Served with mashed potatoes & sweet carrots---even the leftovers were delish.  Will definitly be making this again!  Thanks for sharing!!

I really didn't enjoy this as much as I thought I would.  It took longer to bake than I thought, and the mushrooms and onions were not cooked as thoroughly as I'd have hoped.  My family liked it, though.

This was quite delicious. I didn't have condensed golden mushroom soup so I substituted condensed onion soup, omitted the onions, and doubled the mushroom. As suggested by others, I seasoned the chops with salt and pepper, dredged in flour and seared them for a couple mins on both sides in a frying pan. I removed the chops and sauteed the mushrooms. Then I added the chops back to the pan and poured in the can of soup. I put the lid on and put the whole thing into the oven. I served it with mashed potatoes and peas. Not a single bite leftover! Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recepie. I also sauteed onion, mushrooms and added garlic powder as I am out of fresh garlic, browned chops in the same pan and poured all over chops. For those of you who used regular mushroom soup, do be sure to try the golden mushroom soup next time since it is wonderful. This works great with chicken also. Thanks for an excellent update of this recipe.

My family loved this dish! After baking the casserole,I spooned the gravy over prepared rice, then layered the meat on top of that. Steamed broccoli and we had a delicious meal! 
Note: You can use low-calorie or low-salt soup instead.

I have been making a recipe similar to this for a long time. I usually cooked it in a skillet. I tried baking it this time and it was still just as delicious. I scaled down the recipe because there was only 2 of us. I added 1 tsp oregano and garlic powder. I didn't have any acutal mushrooms on hand so I didn't use them. It still was delicous. I might try to sautee the onions next time before they go on the pork chops

Perfect-the only change I made was that I used 1 can of garlic cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of golden mushroom soup.  It made a nice gravy for mashed potatoes!

Very good, although I made a few changes: I browned the pork chops in a pan on the stove then placed in baking pan.  Mixed two cans of soup, 1/2 sliced onion, salt and pepper.  Poured over chops, cover with foil and bake as directed.  I use 2 cans of soup for more sauce to put over noodles or potatoes.

Great recipe, although I did change it a bit using suggestions from other reviewers- that's why I love this site. I browned the pork chops in a skillet first. Then I sauteed mushrooms and onions in the skillet with olive oil garlic powder, oregano and italian seasonings. I added whipping cream to the pan as I was sauteeing them. I threw this mixture over the chops along with the cream of mushroom soup and baked it according to the instructions. It was soo good.

This was a hit!  I made sure to sautee the onions really well.. because I love that flavor!  But other than that.. it was really easy, and everyone liked it!  There wasn't any left over for lunch the next day, which I was kinda bummed because I would have like to eat more!! :)

I will prepare this again, but next time I will use more seasoning. I sauteed the onions and mushrooms first added salt and pepper to them, but the sauce was still a little bland.  I think I'll try them with a little garlic salt next time.

This was good.  I, of course made  a few variations.  My version took roughly 40 minutes to make.  I seasoned the chops to my liking and cooked them in 2 tsps. olive oil, onion, mushroom and garlic until brown on both sides.  I removed them to a covered baking dish.  In the pan I used to cook the chops, i added 1 1/2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and stirred.  I added a little beef stock since the soup is thick.  I put that mixture onto the chops and baked for about 10-15 minutes.  I only gave it three stars because of all the variations but i got the idea from this recipe!

This recipe was OK.  I browned the chops like other reviews suggested.  Even with the browing of the chops and the added garlic, there just wasn't a whole lot of flavor.  I might make this again if I can find some other things to add that jazz up the flavor.

Unfortunately, I made the mistake of cooking the boneless pork chops uncovered for 30 minutes before I realized it was suppose to be covered.  Based on this mistake I think I dried out the chops...this always seems to happen to me.  I will definitely try again, but based on my mistake it was not as hot as everyone else had mentioned.

Very good recipe.  I make it quite often and it's a huge hit!  I do use Cream of Mushroom with roasted garlic instead of the golden mushroom.

This is a wonderful recipe! My husband and I loved the sauce that the mushroom soup and onion mix made. I will even try it over chicken next time. This is a winner and will go into our normal routine!

Made this last night and it was wonderful! Whole family loved it! Took a couple of suggestions of browning the chops with seasoning of pepper, salt, garlic, and season all salt...also cooked the onions and mushrooms before baking...used regular cream of mushroom soup...& used thick chops. They tasted yummy over the mashed potatos I made...thanks so much for the recipe, definately making again;)

This dish is definately a keeper!  It was so easy and relatively cheap to make.  Like some of the other reviewers, I browned the pork ckops before baking and I also sauteed the onions and mushrooms with about 1 clove of fresh garlic.  I didn't find the gravy to be bland, in fact I didn't have to add very much salt to give it flavor.  My whole family enjoyed it and I think that yours will too!

This was really good.  Like other reviewers, I fried the pork chops in a hot skillet sprayed with cooking spray for a couple of minutes.  Then, I fried the onions, mushrooms, and added a couple cloves of minced garlic.  I only had one can of golden mushroom and one can of garlic mushroom, so I mixed these toghether and poured over the chops topped with the fried onions, mushrooms and garlic.  I think I'll try cooking it on the stove the whole time instead of baking it to see if it will come out more juicy and tender than it did in the oven.  The gravy was excellent over mashed potatoes.  Very tasty!

Update: It comes out better when you use thick-cut bone-in pork chops instead of boneless.  The boneless ones came out dry for me.

The onions should be carmelized first to give it more flavour since my family complained that it didn't have much.

Were good, but I think there was just too much onion in it.  No extra salt needed, either.

This is a great recipe.  I did have to change some things, because I had no mushrooms I just had to omit them  :-(
I also added onion soup mix, because that's how I like to season most things, and I didn't have enough time to cook it in the oven, so I fried it in a frying pan with the onions and then added the cream of mushroom soup and cooked it the rest of the way.  This recipe was easy, fast, and tasted good.  I'll use it again.

Although this didn't look terribly appetizing, it was pretty good. I made the full recipe for only 4 chops - maybe next time I'll cut the soup in half and add a little sour cream so it's not so "soupy". I served it with garlic butter potatoes to pour the gravy over, which went well.

I'd give this 3.5 stars if I could. This was good, but there are so many different, similar variations and this one just didn't hit the spot for me.

This was not visually appealing since meat does not brown.  It would be more appetizing to brown meat first.  This is not a dish I would make again.

This recipe is really delicious! I served it with some mashed potatoes and the hubby (who normally won't go anywhere near ANYTHING with mushrooms) ate a huge helping. The meat was a bit tough, but I think it was just the cut of the chops. I wil definately make this again! Thanks for sharing...

This was just o.k. for us. I was hoping for somthing a little less soupy with the sauce. It was thicker the next day for leftovers.

this recipe was awesome!!  I don't normally like pork chops because they are so dry but this recipe was great.  the mushroom sauce was delicious on top of the pork chops.  My husband's remark - "hats off to the chef!"
