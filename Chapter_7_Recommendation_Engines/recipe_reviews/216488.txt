This is decadently delicious!  Very rich and filling, maybe best served over a bed of jasmine rice or orzo, and with a glass of dry Reisling.  I finally found the ultimate mushroom recipe!  Thanks for sharing it.

This was absolutely wonderful.  I had to halve the recipe, and I used chicken sausage instead of turkey (I had some in the freezer).  I added a dibble of Worchestershire sauce, garlic and oregano, but then I just have to play with recipes.  My husband and I sat down and ate the whole dish while we were watching movies.  Good thing I halved the recipe!  Thanks so much for the post!

I was excited to try this recipe. It sounded so good. It was tasty, but a bit on the runny side. Maybe I didn't squeeze the spinach out enough. If I make this again, I would add at least twice as many mushrooms. OH--and I spent $6 on a tin of dry ground mustard--then forgot to add it!! Grrrr, guess I'll be trolling along in Allrecipes land looking for recipes that use it!

This is a good low carb recipe but extremely greasy!  I served it with a tomato and fresh basil salad but it was a little too rich to be served without some sort of pasta or something.

A small world! I loved that small restaurant in Northern CA. ate there often...and mostly ordered this entree! I do not post anyone's name or business online without permission.  There is another version of this recipe posted online, it says the source is the restaurant who, to my knowledge, originated this dish.  While this recipe is tasty, the recipe posted elsewhere seems to be more along the lines of the original...containing Mornay sauce.  Nevertheless thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was certainly over the top!  It's a delicious combination of ingredients, but 2 lbs. of the jack cheese just seemed like an overwhelming amount to me - maybe a typo?  Made it according to the recipe (lots of grease from the cheese) and enjoyed it, but will likely reduce the Monterey Jack next time and increase the spinach and 'shrooms.

I used to order this all the time at Shattuck Ave. Spats in Berkeley, which is probably the restaurant referred to (it's been closed for years, unfortunately).  As a vegetarian I use veggie Italian sausage (Trader Joe's brand) and halve the amount of butter called for, as it is way too rich and greasy otherwise... and add onions and garlic.  I also serve it over noodles, as they did at the restaurant.

I minced the mushrooms and served it in a quiche plate with garlic toasts as an appetizer.  I should have doubled the recipe, because it was one of the first things gone.

Loved this recipe -  I substituted turkey breast that I spiced heavily with salt pepper Italian seasoning - served over a bed of jasmine rice with a fresh green side salad - The fennel flavor is wonderful and not overpowering at all.  I agree that this is rich but the rice and salad off set that to make it delicious!  Will be making again, with the sausage as the recipe called for.
