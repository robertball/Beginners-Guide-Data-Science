The flavor was fairly good, unfortunately the recipe makes a good 10 times more sauce than needed.  This was soup with cucumber floating in it.  We used a slotted spoon to retrieve the cucumber, but it was just WAY WAY WAY too much dressing...

This was delicious.  I had been craving cucumber salad and with most of the ones that I've had in the past they were way to vinegary. But this one was creamy and perfect.  I made 1/4 of the recipe and the secret to keeping it from being to wet is the part of the recipe about salting and peppering the cukes and letting them sit in the frig to lose some of their natural liquid then further drying them with paper towels.  They turned out perfect and the dressing was neither runny nor too much.  It was perfect.

Love this! Since I'm not a huge fan of cukes, this has changed me! Will make this again, thanks for the recipe!  (PS yes, way too much dressing, it may appear to taste too salty, but the cucumbers do balance that out. TIP:Don't skip the salt your cukes step, it releases water, so the dressing doesn't get so watered down)

Good! I used English cucumbers and did not get a lot of liquid. Made all the dressing, but used about half for three Cucumbers.  Didnâ€™t use the celery salt. I think they were salty enough and celery salt can be overpowering.

GREAT flavor, the dressing is delicious (I cut the dressing recipe to less than half and still worked very well). However, even with the salting step and with cutting the dressing down, it got very watery... I guess this may be the nature of working with cucumbers though since they contain so much water. All in all this is a good recipe due to the wonderful flavors!
