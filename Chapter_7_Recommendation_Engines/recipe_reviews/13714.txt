Chef in our fav. fondue rest. said the acid will help the cheese soft & smooth also bring some extra favor. I hope this help. :-)

It's so funny that fondue has made a come back, however, in our house, it never left. I've tryed many fondue recipes, but this is my favorite. I did skip the nutmeg and I found that garlic powder gives the dish a nice flavor. We used to use day old french bread, but found that the bread is a lot crispier and lighter if warmed in the oven. Delicious, Sheila and thanks! As a P.S.; for those who found a clumping problem, we toss the cheese with the flour first instead of adding it in later. This should eliminate any clumps.

Easy and actually better than at my favorite fondue restaurant! I halved the recipe with some leftovers, and served two. Adjustments were 1 grated clove garlic cooked with the flour, also, dashes of worcestershire, mustard powder and salt, and slightly less nutmeg. Cheap cooking wine worked fine, but definitely go for the good cheese! Still, classy and fabulous for less than $12, including apples, sourdough & carrots (halved). Couldn't ask for a yummier fondue! Thx!

Help!  I made this and the cheese was one big lump.  It never really melted.  I bought expensive cheese and used a Chardony for the wine?  Any hints??

This is one of the easiest and best fondues I've ever had!  My company loved it!  I have no idea why anyone had any trouble with this recipe.  Can't be any easier! I made mine in a pan on the stove and transferred to my fondue bowl before serving. I didn't  have any trouble adding the flour to the cheese. I just used my wisk and it was fine.  Pefect in fact!  I did rub the inside of my fondue bowl with garlic.  Later when I rubbed my bread against the inside of the bowl, I could really taste the garlic and it was even better.  Next time I'll add a little more.  No trouble with it thickening either.  It didn't last long enough! It seems to me the complaints I read were about the cheese.  My guess is, the quality of the cheese makes a BIG difference!  I spent about $15 on the cheese and it was perfect.  I also used a good quality white wine.  I was told you shouldn't cook with anything you wouldn't drink.  I think that's good advise.  If you had trouble with this recipe or didn't like it, I'd look at the ingredients you used. We used whole grain baguette bread and it was wonderful!  This one's a keeper!  Thanks Sheila

If you have problems with your cheese separating, squeeze 1/2 of a lemon into the wine before adding cheese.  The lemon is NOT for taste but to help break down the cheese and keep your fondue beautiful all night long.

This is an excellent recipe.  I have failed with a couple of different swiss cheese fondues (which can be expensive) and this recipe has all the right ingredients for great flavor and it is easy. Bonus that from start to finish is in the fondue pot. A few hints for the beginning fondueist: dry wine works better such as sauvignon. If it seems runny add more flour, if it seems too thick and stringy add lemon juice (or check your sterno) I use a ceramic double boiler fondue pot.  These can be a little expesive but they will not burn the cheese.  The stainless steel pot that sits on the flame will burn the cheese. I haven't used a cast iron fondue pot but this might work too as cast iron distributes heat more evenly so the hottest part of the pot is not the bottom.

This is the first time I made fondu and it came out great.  It's not the smoothest blend but then you're not using that fake, pasterurized cheese stuff.  For the recipe I used Swiss, Edam and Guyere and added about a tablespoon of Red Cooking Wine.  I followed suggestions from other users and tossed the cheese (shredded) in flour and added a few drops of lemon juice.  I also did not use a fondu pot rather a crockpot and warmed the wine in the pot first and then added the cheese and just set it on low and let it melt on its own with occassional stirring.  The aroma throughout the house was absolutely wonderful and tempting.  I must add that this is NOT a reheatable dish - if you don't use it all, don't try to save it.

This is an excellent, easy recipe and received rave reviews from my guests.  Thank you for sharing.

This fondue is absolutely fantastic. I'm a huge fan of The Melting Pot, which is a chain of fondue restaurants. I actually prefer this recipe to the fondue sold at The Melting Pot! I'm a big garlic fan, so I add a glove of garlic with the wine. It's amazing.

Just read a review saying the FONDUE was thrown away for being "too cheesy." Too cheesy! Fondue. It's a CHEESE DIP. If you're not looking for something that tastes like cheese, don't make cheese fondue. Seriously.

Try mixing the flour with the cheese before adding it to the wine. I worked for the Melting Pot a fondue restaurant and this is an awesome starting recipe.  
If you dont want to use only bread, try using vegetables like carrots, celery, blanched broccoli and cauliflower.  You can also use brown baguette bread.
As for adding more flavor, try adding jalepenos, or add in spinach and chopped artichoke hearts.  Bacon is a great addition as well. Adding fresh ground pepper gives a lot more flavor.  
Also, instead of using wine, use chicken boulion or a light beer.
Hope you enjoy! Also check out chocolate fondue or an entree (steak, chicken, scallops, lobster tail... Its delicious!!!)

When the cheese thicken up, I added a little more wine. The biggest key is to keep the flame up high enough to not let it cool. If it does add more wine. If you like garlic, try rubbing the pot before you add the wine, VERY nice. Also Great without garlic!
This far better than best fondue restaurant here!  Thank you for sharing it!!

Another tip for smoothe cheese is to pre-flour the cheese before you put it in to be melted. After grating cheese, mix it with the flour. It's a tip I learned while working for a national fondue restaurant. Works great.

Very good! The only thing I would change about this recipe is the amount.  It made enough fondue for dipping at least two loaves of french bread, which is closer to 10 servings.  Next time I will cut the ingredients in half.

Made this for lunch for fiance and me and we loved it. It came together very easily and has a great consistency. Emmentaler/Emmenthaler Swiss cheese is especially tasty in this if you can find it. I used a Chardonnay for the white wine (any Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc would probably work well too - I would stay away from "cooking wine" since it's got extra salt and chemicals, and use wine that is especially meant for drinking). A previous reviewer suggested mixing the flour in with the grated cheese before adding them to the pot and that was particularly helpful. We ate the fondue with bread, roasted potato chunks, meatballs, steamed button mushrooms and steamed broccoli. This is going to be my go-to cheese fondue recipe. Thank you!

this was a really good recipe, however, I needed to alter it because it wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked.  I adjusted the recipe as follows:  add an extra 1/2 cup of white wine (a good portion of it evaporates while simmering).  Delete the 2 Tablespoons of flour.  It made it too pasty and glue-like.  Add an extra 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  Add a half cup of dry cooking sherry.  The next time I make it, I'll also add some minced garlic clove, ground black pepper, and lemon juice to add a bit of zing to it.  The original recipe was good but extremely mild.  A good base to work with, though, for your own kitchen experiments.  The extra wine and sherry will give it a sure kick.  I served it in a rye bread bowl, and it turned out to be more of a spread vs. a fondue (did not have room for a crock pot on the hors d'oeuvre table).  Highly recommended with green apple slices, veggies, and chopped up rye bread.

Super Easy to make.  I followed the advice of others and tossed the flour with the cheese before adding it to the wine.  I used a Sauvignon Blanc that was nice and dry.  Spend the money for the good wine especially if you are using good expensive cheese.  We dipped boiled baby potatoes, asparagus, baby carrots (blanched), red potatoes, french bread, grapes, granny smith apples and grape tomatoes.  Made this for Fondue Virgins and they loved it !  Will keep this recipe !!  I did add the nutmeg which I was hesitant about but it turned out great !

Suggestion: take a garlic clove, cut in half, and rub the inside of the pot with it before you put the wine in.  This adds a lovely savoriness.  You can use Emmental instead of Gruyere.  I also omitted the flour, because the fondue is thick enough on its own.  This is a good basic recipe that is definitely a crowd pleaser.

This was delicious!! I bought a foundue pot recently and a fondue book from the melting pot. This recipe is as good as the ones listed in the book, but far less ingredients. I made this 2 nights in a row and served with french bread and apples. There wasn't any left. If your fondue is sticking together add a little bit of lemon juice, too thick, slowly stir in more wine, too thin, add more cheese. This recipe is a keeper!

I liked this fondue a lot.  I only gave it four stars because I changed a little bit - I added 2 TBSP of lemon juice per all the fondue sections of the cooking websites out there.  I used an extra half a pound of Emmentaler cheese with the Jarlsberg & Gruyere, and I added the flour to the cheese first to avoid getting lumps.  It melted beautifully and was delicious - until the flame on our fondue pot went out.  Then it quickly congealed and got lumpy and gross and there was no bringing it back no matter how much wine we added.  But until then - delicious!  :)

OK, so I'm a guy. That will explain everything.  White wine?  I used some old White Zinfandel that my wife's been sipping at (I hardly drink at all), maybe a half-pound of Swiss and a third or so each of Muenster and Provolone. We didn't have nutmeg, so we used thyme.  No added salt; there's enough in the cheese.  I read a few of the reviews about lumping and figured I'd help my odds with a little lemon juice.  Added a dash of garlic powder just for the heck of it.  My wife cut up an English cucumber and a red bell pepper and some kind of crusty (not French) bread.  It certainly wasn't the recipe's fault if this turned out awful, but it didn't!  My wife and I are both bloated on a fine, fine cheese fondue dinner.  Folks, if I can get it right, anybody can! Enjoy.

Impressive and easy.  I didn't have any sterno for my fondue pot so I used a double boiler.  I rubbed the pot with garlic, added the wine (Bogle chardonnay) then the grated cheese tossed with the flour...slow and steady.  I also added the recommended lemon juice, about a tablespoon.  No clumps, nice and smooth.  Served at the table in the double boiler to keep the cheese fluid.  Next time I might try adding another 1/4 cup wine to thin it out just  a bit.  This is the recipe to use if you have never made fondue before.  Do make sure you use good quality cheese.  I used Swiss Emmentaler and Gruyere.

This is a great base recipe for fondue. I did add 1/2 a tsp. of Colman's ground mustard and 7 ounces of Velveeta in place of 3.5 oz's of each of the other two cheeses because the the first time I made it the recipe was a bit strong and a bit too oily for our taste. I also rubbed the fondue pot with a clove of garlic before placing the ingredients in the pot.

Also, a rule of thumb for a great fondue is to make sure to toss the shredded cheeses in the flour instead of adding it to the pot. This will prevent clumping and will make a much smoother fondue.

This was fantastic!  I rubbed the pot with garlic before heating the wine, and I omitted the salt entirely.  The trick to prevent clumping is to toss the flour with the grated cheese, and add it to the wine in very small amounts, keeping the heat low and constant.  The result was perfect!  We prefer to use apples and cocktail sausages as dippers, instead of bread.  Yummmmm.....

This was excellent. I added two cloves of garlic into the wine and will add more next time. Nice and mild - a good basic restaurant style fondue. Try creamer potatoes with a dash of dill for dipping.

This was excellent,  I doubled the recipe, I used 1/2 lb. Gruyere, 1/2 pound emmantel, and 1 lb of Jarlsberg cheese.  This served 10 people for a fondue party.  Make sure your fondue pot is double boiler style, or cheese may burn.

Fantastic!  I've made fondue numerous times.  However, the consistency was always hit or miss.  It sometimes would separate, cheese from wine.  Very rarely did it have the look of The Melting Pot's fondue.  This recipe easily duplicates that luxurious consistency and taste from a restaurant.  The only taste we missed was the faint hint of garlic rubbed on the fondue pot, prior to beginning cooking.  Of course when choosing a wine, especially for this recipe where the wine plays a dominate part, take a cup from whatever you are planning on drinking.  The wine definitely does make a difference.  If you wouldn't drink it on it's own, then you will not like it in any fondue.  Thank you Sheila, this was delicious.

I was a little let down by the oil content in the cheeses I selected. This is a great dish! I am part Swiss and had the pleasure of growing up eating this stuff and take it from me; this is a great version. The white wine and flour were new to as I usually use Kirsch instead (I actually thought this version with wine was better - Sorry Dad!).

I worked at a Melting Pot for several years in the early 90's and this is the exact recipe we used for our traditional swiss cheese fondue. It's excellent! It's also good with a smidge of Kirschwasser (cherry brandy) too.  Yummy!!

I served this at book club and only have a small candle lit fondue pot - so of course I cooked it on the stove first. I used the expensive cheese in the recipe and an $8 bottle of chardonnay.  I doubled the recipe and shredded the cheese then I put it in a gallon ziplock bag and added the 1/4 cup of flour to the bag - then added it to the wine.  It was perfect.  At first I thought it was going to be a big clump but after about 30 minutes of simmering on the stove it was great.

Very good!  The only thing I didn't add was salt and I did add 1 clove minced garlic.  Was a bit thick.  I think I'll omit flour next time.  For dippers I used broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and green apples!  The five of us ate almost the whole pot!

yummy! I used Emmantaler swiss and Gruyere. My husband enjoyed this on Valentine's Day. Next time I might rub the dish with a bit of garlic for a little more flavor.

This is the same recipe that I use, except that mine says the salt is only if you want it and I don't.  I agree with the reviewer who said that they were told to only cook with something that you would drink.  That is definitely something to cook by.  This recipe is made all in the fondue pot, but the truth is that is depends on the type of pot and the type of heating (candle, electric, etc.).  It makes a difference how hot the temperature gets and how much control you have over that heat.  It can help to make the foundue in a pot on the stove and transfer it into the fondue pot.  It also helps, as another reviewer mentioned, to add more wine when the mix becomes thick.  (Or add cream if you are making chocolate fondue.)  Also, tossing the cheese with the flour eliminates the clumping issues with the flour.  For the person who said that the cheese never melted all the way, you did not have enough heat and might have benefited from melting in a pan on the stove and transferring it whene it was melted.  Thanks Sheila for sharing this!!

I tried it with the ingredients exactly as written, and it was really good.  I did make some changes to make it perfect: 1/4 tsp garlic powder and a few drops of Worcestershire sauce. Also did as someone suggested and tossed the cheese/flour together before melting.  I had no problems with clumping.  I used Sauvignon Blanc.  Served it with french bread, a cut up apple, carrots and celery.

this was overall a pretty good recipe.  i made it twice last wknd.  it needed a little more flavor, so i added a splash of kirsch, salt & pepper, and a tiny bit of cayenne red pepper.  much better! i used emmentaler instead of gruyere & it turned out fine.  to make the perfect consistency, coat the shredded cheese w/a little flour 1st, then add small amounts at a time, making sure the cheese is completely melted w/each addition.  i also used a mini crock pot which worked great, as i was able to melt the cheese quite easily in the microwave using the crock pot stoneware.  also, have the cubes of bread cut up the night before, or the morning of to prevent them from getting too soggy & falling off into the pot--not fun to clean!  enjoy!  make sure you have some good chilled white wine on hand : )

This turned out really well for me. Not lumpy at all! It's dangerously delicious. I serve it with bread cubes and blanched vegitables. 

Personally, I prefer skipping the nutmeg and adding some mustard instead but it's no fail either way. I also rub the pot generously with garlic before I add the fondue. 

I feel for the reviewer whose expensive cheese was wasted because it turned into a big lump. That happened to me years ago. I called my mother and learned the solution; It was too hot! If you run into this, take it off the heat and the cheese will melt into the liquid. Gentle heat is always preferred when working with cheese!

Very tasty recipe!  I used smoked Gruyere, less nutmeg, omitted the salt, and added a spoonful of Dijon mustard.  I also toasted the bread.  Perfect amount of cheese for the bread, too.  Yum!

This was perfect. I noticed the recipe didn't give instructions for how to prepare the cheese, if you should shred it or something I "diced" them into cubes everything melted perfectly. One thing I found... Starunner mentioned in their review that this can't be reheated, but I found the opposite! I put it back on the stove the next day added a glug or two of Chardonnay, whisked it while it melted and I actually thought the flavor and texture was just as good! I have no idea why it worked or if it will work for anyone else, as I too was always under the impression fondue couldn't be reheated but it melted perfectly over low heat on the stove.

So good!! Not only is it basic, but it isn't time-consuming. Omitted the nutmeg out of a personal preference, and added a squirt of lemon juice as per the suggestions of other reviewers and it turned out great - I had no problems with the cheese lumping, and served this with bread cubes. Thanks for sharing!

This was good, you should like swiss if you are going to make this also.  I think I will try with apple cider next time, as my son liked it but would like to try something else besides the wine next time. My fondue pot can go in the micro, so I heated to get it to melt quicker, no problem with lumps.  We had a Fun Friday Fondue night, picnic on the floor.  We dipped shrimp, granny smith apples, bread and I had got a strip steak cut in pieces and I had fried in oil before.  If you have leftovers, use it to put in FRENCH ONION SOUP.. YUM.

This recipe is AWESOME. Since my trip to Switzerland 6 years ago, I am a HUGE fan of cheese fondue. The only difference I made was adding ~ 3 Tbsp Kirsch (cherry liquor). I added the flour to the Kirsch and then added into the cheese. Oh, and rubbing the fondue pot with garlic is a must! Thanks for sharing. Taste just like Switzerland!

Delicious recipe!  Served the fondue with a loaf of crusty bread, steamed baby red potatoes, par-boiled asparagus, and red,green and yellow pepper slices.  I should have made a double batch ~ not a drop remained.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really easy - I used cheap Swiss cheese and expensive Gruyere ($9 for a brick!?!) and the cost might make me make this less often, but it worked great.  We dipped grapes, bread, beef, broccoli, apples, and pretzels into the cheese - a fun little lunch party on a weekend.  I also had no nutmeg but think it turned out just fine!

Yum!  Melted great, but then again, I have an electric fondue pot.  Added flour to cheese before melting, as others recommended, which worked beautifully.  Also skipped the nutmeg and used about 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and a few grinds of fresh black pepper.  Due to the amount sold per pkg, used 7 oz Swiss and 7 oz Gruyere w/ 1 cup wine.  More cheese seems like it would be too thick, but don't know for sure because I didn't try it.  Will use this one again!

I'm pregnant and was craving fondue like crazy. I've had this recipe in the past, and loved it, so I thought I'd try it out. I used apple juice instead of wine and used only swiss (I didn't have gruyere), and it still hit the spot! Not exactly the same, but still delish!

Delicious!  Every bit as good as our favorite fondue restaurant.  The only change I made was tossing in a clove of garlic with the simmering wine and adding a little lemon juice with the cheese as others suggested.  Everyone loved it and it made plenty for our family of six.  Thank you!!

I love this recipe.  The first time I made it I used a French swiss cheese (along with gruyere and asiago).  It was good.  The second time I used baby swiss, and it was great!  I'll definitely use baby swiss with this recipe from now on!

I love Fondue and so does my husband, sometimes dinner is just cheese and bread and apples. This was a great recipe, nice flavor and quick and easy to make!

By far my favorite cheese fondue recipe, and I've had a few.  This is exactly how it was meant to taste.  Go to Switzerland--where it actually originated as a way to use up hardened cheese and stale bread--you'll see what I mean!  Don't eliminate/change any ingredients--it's absolutely perfect as is!

This was a good recipe, but a little thick. I had to thin it out with more wine and a little cream.

Made the recipe as is except that I omitted the nutmeg. We really liked it. We dipped pumpernickel and ACE Bakery bread (yum!). We also tried dipping apples as another user suggested. Will definitely make this again but next time we'll double the recipe!

We have fondue every Christmas Eve and this one was a hit! I added a clove of crushed garlic to the wine as it simmered, which added a nice flavor.

I like this recipe because you can change it up.  My kids don't care for Swiss.  This time I used sharp cheddar and Gouda.  We dipped sautéed mushrooms, steamed broccoli,sausage and bread cubes.  Our Valentines Day tradition.

Tossing the shredded cheese with the flour before adding (slowly) to the wine and stirring constantly created a nice creamy melt.  Easy and delicious.  I substituted a bit of garlic as others had suggested.

We spent $32 on quality cheese alone and then it ended up tasting like dirty feet! We had to try to salvage it with fresh parmesan and cheddar and it still just never tasted right! Waste of money and definitely don't recommend.

This cheese fondue was awesome!!  We absolutely loved it.  We substituted garlic powder for the nutmeg.  I agree with others when they say to use "good quality" cheese and wine.  We used a 10 dollar bottle of wine and our cheeses together cost us 22 dollars.  This is key.

the flour should be added before melting the cheese,this way prevents the cheese of separating from the wine..adding Kirsch with the wine would be the perfect match with these 2 kinds of cheese!

I think I'm partial to the recipe for Cheese Please Fondue with ranch flavoring.  I was really excited to try this, but was frustrated with the grainy texture which I tried so hard to avoid by using lemon juice and stiring the cheese in well.  I read Alton Brown's review on fondue and I think the key is LOW TEMP after adding the cheese.  Still though, the flavor of the ranch in fondue was my favorite and complimented the french bread and vege sticks so much better.

It turned out great. Key is to flour the shredded cheese before melting it. That keeps the lumps from forming. Also, not heating it too high keeps it from burning and forming burnt lumps.

Excellent and very authentic fondue!  I shredded the cheese in the food processor and then tossed it with the flour, melted it on the stovetop and added the seasonings.  THEN I added it to the wine, which I had allowed to simmer in the fondue pot first.  It took two capfuls of lemon juice to "de-clump" it, but once it smoothed out it was PERFECT!!!  Easy, delicious, and fun--you can't go wrong with that recipe!

This was my first time making a fondue. Following a few of the suggestions mentioned by other reviewers, I shredded the cheese and tossed with the flour before adding it to the pot. Other than that, I followed the recipe as stated. It was GREAT. It was served to guests and it got lots of oooh's and aaah's!

I made this last night as an appetizer for Valentine's dinner, my first atempt making cheese fondue. I'm glad I read the reviews before and just like Linda advised, to avoid clumping problems I tossed the cheese with the flour before adding in the pot. I also added a few drops of lemon in the wine. It came out nice and smooth with no clumps. I will be making this again for sure.

This was a big hit at my party! The nutmeg is so key, and I used to hate it so I was very tempted to leave it out. I'm so glad I didn't! I'll definitely make this one again and again, I've already done it twice! PS- Thanks to the reviewer that gave us a heads up about tossing the shredded cheese and flour before adding it to the pot. The first time I had not done so and found many lumps in my fondue. The next time I had a much better consistency.

I really didn't like this recipe.  First off it smelled horrible while we were making it but we though it would still taste OK.  We were wrong, it tasted as bad as it smelled.  I would not recommend this recipe!

This was my first attempt at fondue and we loved it.  I made this for myself and my husband for Valentine's Day so I halved the recipe.  I used Gruyere cheese only and I coated the cheese with the flour before adding it to the wine and I left out the salt and the nutmeg.  I did not miss the salt at all.  I wasn't sure how nutmeg would pair with a strong wine taste so that is why I chose to leave that out.  We used crusty pieces of french bread and cauliflower florets for dunking.  YUM-O!  My new fondue pot will not go to waste and I have justified this purchase to my husband.  It has been a good day!!!!

Very good--grated the cheese, tossed the cheese in flour, rubbed down the pot with garlic, use a little realemon (didn't have a real lemon) and then followed the ingredient amounts as listed.  This is a very tasty fondue that reminds you of restaurant quality.  This was my first fondue--it will definitely be a repeat!!  Four stars due to the directions being tweaked a bit for fool-proof fondue!

Very good, just like the Melting Pot.  I served mine with pumpernickel bread and Granny Smith apple chunks.  The only downside is that the ingredients for this recipe cost about $25.

Had a going away party for one of the girls at work and she absolutly loves cheese so I made Sheilas recipe.  I was a hit, everyone loved it.  I did crush a garlic clove and let it cook in cheese about a minute and then removed it.  I also added a little bit of parmesan cheese for I had that on hand as well.  I had to transport it from home to town about 25 minute drive I heated it well and wrapped in towel. I cooked it on the stove to begin with.  Once I got to my destination I just warmed it up on stove once again and it work wonderfully with a little stirring to get it back.  I will be making this cheese fondue again, maybe at the next party or my birthday that is coming up!

Wow! This is a great fondue!  Served at a party and went over wonderfully.  We did have to add wine a couple of times and stir well, when it started to thicken to much.  However, that is to be expected when it's out all night long!  Next time I make a fondue, this is the recipe I will choose!  Love It!

This is just fantastic!  My husband and I do "low carb", so we cook up some chicken, steak, and/or italian sausage chunks and then dip them in this. It is very yummy! Friends love this with bread also. I make it at least once a month.

This was OK.  Not sure if it was just OK because I was making two other things at the same time and this didn't get all of my attention, or if it really comes out "just OK" every time.  I mixed in the ingredients like the recipe called.  I think it needed a little more nutmeg and to be mixed up extremely well after adding the salt.  The bread makes a differnece as well.  I'd probably prefer the bread to be toasted next time, cut up in 1/2 inch cubes.  Will try this again to give it another shot, but if I'm afraid that if I were to be making fondue to impress someone I'd probably go with a different recipe.  Staying neutral w/ this one for now.

This was my first time making fondue with my new fondue pot.  We had friends over for New Year's Eve, and I was really disappointed in how this came out.  The cheese was very strong tasting and overpowered anything that was dipped into it.  Also, it was stringy even when first melted on the stove.  Soon after it was in the fondue pot, it became a gloppy mess.  Barely anyone touched it, including myself.  I tried all of the hints that other reviewers suggested, all to no avail.  I will not make this fondue again.  I gave it two stars because I'm hoping that I can salvage the expensive cheese mixture in grilled cheese.

I made this for Valentine's Day....my first time making fondue. I thought it was pretty good...not sure if I am a fan of Gruyere cheese though. My boyfriend liked it a lot. I used cornstarch in place of the flour. I did need to add a few tablespoons of water to make it less glue-like. Also, used juice of one lemon, which adds a little flavor. We dipped sourdough bread, raw baby carrots (my favorite), boiled red potatoes (boyfriend's favorite) and steamed broccoli.

Very good and easy.  One suggestion:  simmer the wine until almost all of the alcohol is gone.  Wonderful flavor.

This is the first time making fondue and it came out yummy. I have to confess that I used a cheap cooking wine that you can buy in the grocery store. I did this because I normally do not love cooking with wine as it can take over the flavor of a dish to me. The cheap cooking wine is not so intense. I did however spend a good amount on the cheese. I rubbed down the pot with a garlic clove for flavor. I also added a dash of worcester sauce and a few drops of lemon juice, also  a sprinkle of mustard powder. I coated the cheese in flour as recommended. This had no clumping and was very smooth. Delicious!!!!

I tried this recipe using 1/2 lb. Swiss and 1/2 lb.Edam cheese. I added a little lemon to the wine and rubbed garlic inside my fondue pot. Everyone loved it. My son said it's the best fondue I've made. Will be making this again.

The best cheese fondue we've ever had! Made it for Valentine's Day and it was a big hit. We started with a broth based fondue where we cooked beef tenderloin, chicken, lobster, broccoli, and mushrooms. We let the cheese fondue cook on low heat (2) for over 30 minutes while we enjoyed the broth fondue. With two teenage football players in the family, I cooked a total of 1 1/2 lb of cheese; 1/2 lb swiss, 1/2 lb gruyere, 1/2 lb emmentaler. With all these nutty cheeses I was afraid that the nutmeg would be too much, but at the very end it was the right decision to add it. We had cut the cheese in 1/2 inch squares instead of grating it, and the cheese was lumpy during the melting process, but I think the low heat and long cooking time helped as it turned out very nice and smooth at the end. I used sauvignon blanc as the wine. Best cheese fondue ever!

This was delicious! Had the family over for a fondue night; six adults enjoyed this as a cheese appetizer. Used green apples, bread, and an assortment of vegetables for dipping.

Made this last night to RAVE reviews :)  The only thing we did differently was we chose a citrus-ginger sparkling wine.  Will absolutely make again!

I decided on this recipe because it has the fewest ingredients in addition to the wine and cheese, of all the ones I looked at. At first, I was having a hard time getting the cheese and wine to combine smoothly and was afraid I had gotten the wine too hot or something. Even though the recipe says not to add the flour until the cheese and wine are smooth, I decided to add it then. As I whisked the flour in, the whole thing came together.  It's delicious, even better than I remembered!

Delicious!!  Tasted just like what we get at the Melting Pot restaurant.  I bought premium cheese and wine and tossed the cheese with the flour before putting it into the fondue.  I didn't have any problems with it separating.  I served it with bread cubes and fresh apple cubes.  I also rubbed the fondue pot with garlic before making it.  Fantastic, thank you for a great recipe!

This is a great fondue recipe. We use it every New Years' Eve. I shred the cheese in my Cuisinart food processor and toss with flour. I use Sauvignon Blanc, which is a nice dry wine that's relatively inexpensive. Served it with sweet pea pods, grape tomatoes, french bread, baby carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower.

The Swiss that taught me to make cheese fondue in the seventies used bread only for dipping. It's a dish for dedicated cheese lovers! This recipe is good, still you can leave out salt and ground nutmeg. You can also replace the all purpose flour with corn starch (cornflour, maizena). Less chance of clumping then. I learned to make it with half Emmenthaler and half Gruyere. For a milder taste, try Emmenthaler and Jarlsberg (not Swiss though). The Swiss traditionally use Kirsh (cherry brandy) in it as well, but then it gets really expensive. They also use a special ceramic cheese fondue pot, that can handle very high temperatures without burning. Remember to really turn up the heat before adding the cheese, and keep it high until serving! Then you can also do with small slices of cheese, in stead of shredded cheese.

I had a huge problem getting this to melt properly....it kind of clumped up and left lots of liquid ....had to pour off some of the wine and add lemon juice and some cheddar cheese to it.  Also not real flavorful....would benefit from some garlic powder or herbs of some sort.  I added some basil pesto which helped add flavor. I would not make this recipe again .  No problem with other fondue recipes.

I had never made cheese fondue before and found this recipe to be fairly easy to follow. The fondue itself has a very nice flavor and it is very thick. However it is SUPER RICH. I know it's supposed to be, but this whole recipe would be enough to feed a very large crowd. I served mine with cubed bread, grilled steak bites and steamed broccoli and the fondue flavor complemented each of them nicely. If you have leftovers, you can easily use it as a cheese sauce for vegetables or thin it out a bit and serve over pasta.

I made this for a party I threw and the flavor was edible but in no way good.I followed the recipe to a T, did not change a single thing. I will never use this recipe again and I will be removing it from my recipe box. (I did have a few friends attending the party who arrived early taste it too and they all agreed.

I shredded the cheese myself so I could get a finer shred (it took about the same amount of time it took the wine to get to a simmer).  

I took the advice of other reviewers and added the flour to the shredded cheese and used a little lemon juice (mine was from a bottle, not fresh) to help the cheese break down and not clump.  I would definitely make this again.

I give this recipe 5 stars with the following changes. 1. Add the juice of 1/2 a lemon to the mixture. 2. Coat your cheese in the flour instead of adding the flour separately. I served it with cubes of crunchy, warm french bread, raw broccoli, raw mushrooms and cut-up green apple for our New Years Eve dinner. Delicious!

the people who say it was lumpy were either impatient or didn't do something right, use good wine and emetauler cheese (pricy but awesome), we had this with bread cubes, chopped up brocolli and cauliflower, and a nice filet mignon!

This is the best cheese fondue I have ever tasted and/or made and it is so easy! I made it for a girls night fondue party and it went faster than the chocolate fondue.  I do agree with others reviews that you should use the best cheese you can find and a good bottle of sauvignon blanc (I probably was a little more liberal with the wine than the recipe suggested). A little bit of lemon juice is also a must as it really smooths out the cheeses.  I made this in a saucepan and then transferred to a ceramic fondue pot - good tip if you do this, warm up your pot first so the cheese doesn't cool and you have to wait for the flame to hear it back up.

I left out the nutmeg, and as some other recipes suggested added lemon juice to reduce clumping. But it was quick and easy and problem free

The flavor was great, I had no trouble with it being grainy or lumpy like the other reviewers said.  I used extremely high quality Gruyere and Baby Swiss.  Unfortunately, I couldn't really get it to incorporate with the wine.  Any thoughts?!  The cheese was like big lump sitting in really good wine/cheese broth.

Before I tried this recipe, I had unsuccessfully tried cheese fondue in my electric fondue pot twice. It would turn out all gloppy and the cheese would just bind up.  With this recipe and the help of the others reviews, this recipe does not do that.  The most important steps are to remember to coat the cheese with the flour first and to add the cheese in small batches.  Also SIMMER the wine, don't boil it before adding the cheese.  I guarantee my family and I will have this recipe a hundred times over!

Wow, this recipe was so delicious!!! I added a little cheddar and a dash of garlic powder and Im sure it would have been yummy without it. I made it for several girlfriends and we all devoured it. I got so many compliments. This will always be my go to cheese fondue recipe in the future. Yummy!!!

I'm embarrassed to say how much of this we ate!  It was smooth and creamy, no problems with lumpiness or stringiness, and tasted great when we dipped bread, apples, carrots, cauliflower, broccoli...  It made a perfect New Year's Eve dinner.

sooo good.  we're melting pot lovers here and adapted this recipe to make it more like the fiesta cheeese option there.  we started with a cup of light beer, sauteed and added 1 shallot and 2 diced jalepenos.  with the flour we added a light sprinkle of cayenne.  used 1lb sharp cheddar and about a .25lb of mozzarella.  served with tortilla chips, diced bread, apples, carrots, celery.  sooo good, the apples and pumpernickel are my faves.  thanks for the inspiration!

Holy amazing!!! This is the best! My Mom and I couldn't stop:) We made the recipe exactly as it is on here. We used both French Bread and Hawaiian Bread - I was pleasantly surprised by the Hawaiian Bread! And in case any of you want a glass of wine to go with it that's PERFECT, try the Kendall-Jackson Riesling. What a wonderful pairing. This fondue made my New Years perfect. Thank you!!

We literally finished this a few minutes ago - it was absolutely fantastic! I wasn't sure my children would like it, but they gobbled it up with soft pretzels from the oven.I used Sauvignon Blanc for the wine and followed the directions exactly. There was no problem with clumping. Delicious! Thanks and Happy New Year!

This recipe was OK.  You really have to like swiss to like this.  I don't think it was a bad recipe....very easy...but I guess the swiss flavor was a little too much for my taste.  I would rather have more of a cheddar flavor.

We enjoyed very much.  I added a tsp of fresh garlic to the cheese and a few drops of lemon juice also.  I also recommend making this in a small rice cooker or crock put if you don't have a fondue pot.

Wonderful recipe!  I changed my cheese around a bit...guyere, swiss and blue cheese crumbles.  Only a few blue cheese crumbles or the taste will be too much.  Served with brocolli (big hit), carrots, sliced raw yelllow squash, red & green apples, french bread, & cauliflower.  Delicious.  The lemon juice idea was GREAT and my cheese stayed a wonderful consistency the entire meal.  Thanks!

Very easy.  The wine gave it a nice flavour.  We used good cheese, which I would recommend, because there isn't anything other than the wine to really add to the flavour.

This was just excellent.  My daughter, who normally does not like anything to "cheesey" could not get enough of it.  
I had no problems with the cheese lumping.  I also added the flour to the cheese first.  As others did, I rubbed garlic in the pot and cooked it on the stove and then transferred to the fondue pot.  I did not add salt or nutmeg.  This is the cheese fondue recipe our family will use from now on!

This fondue was a real hit with my family members when I served it as an appetizer for Thanksgiving dinner.  I tossed the cheese with the flour (as was suggested in some of the comments) and used a few drops of lemon juice to keep the mixture smooth.  I even added a little garlic and red pepper to give it a bit more flavor, but the recipe is wonderful enough by itself.  It goes especially well with fresh French bread, though I also liked it with rye and with sourdough.

I had less trouble with a alcohol-fueled fondue pot than with an electric one, as it seemed much easier to regulate the temperature.  Thanks for making my first fondue a success!

A hit at my friend's party.  Not a recipe for the impatient; it took me about 15 minutes of stirring to make sure it all melted properly, without burning.  But well worth the effort.  I used fuji apples, pears, and potato rosemary bread to go along with it.

My father-in-law is French and he loved it…followed the advise to mix the flour with the cheese BEFORE tossing it in the pot..and it worked. I didn’t have any problems with the cheese but maybe because I was doing it in an electric fondue…I read about spreading garlic on the sides of the pot…well.. I am a little lazy so I used already minced garlic and it tasted delicious (I don’t know if it will taste differently if you do it with a clove). I add the nutmeg, paprika, pepper and onion salt… really a keeper…but unless you are pouring money our of your pocket. do it only on special occasions.. I think I probably spent 25 dollars in good cheese.

Oh my gosh, this was good! I splurged on pricey cheese and it melted beautifully. I made it on the stovetop then transferred to a fondue pot, which I would do again since it's a little easier to control the heat on the stove. This was my first attempt at fondue and I see much more in my future. ;) FYi for anyone who's wondering - the leftovers reheated nicely on the stove the next day.

The flavor was pretty good, but the cheese lumped together and the fondue was very oily.  We had to keep draining the oil off the top of it.

This was popular at my New Years Eve party. I did add a dash of lemon juice and spent $10 on some good cheese. I think that makes a difference. Once the cheese cooks and melts, the flavors really mellow. I used a Pinot Blanc wine.

This recipe is not great, I guess you have to like gruyere because is everything you can taste, it is very smelly and the gruyere taste and smell overpowers everything else, next time I'll try it with other cheese instead, I am giving it 3 stars because although I thought it was not great it was eatable.

This was the first cheese fondue I ever made and we thought this one was very good.  I think the wine taste was a bit strong so I would probably use less next time.  After reading others suggestions we only used about 1 tablespoon of flour and we also added in some fresh coarsly ground black pepper which added a bit of a zing to the flavor.

I printed this recipe for my sister, since it did seem to have good reviews, but it didn't turn out very well.  it came out waaaay too thick and stringy.  she has made fondue before, and tried to fix it, but it couldn't be done.

I've discovered my love for fondues.  What a great way to clean out your crisper. You can feed 2 people with a carrot, one celery stalk, an apple,a fennel bulb, and end pieces of bread.  This recipe can stretch out your food $$$.

Outrageously good fondue!  The quality of the cheese you use really matters, so spring for the good stuff.  I was a bit worried about the texture as the cheese was melting, but as soon as the flour goes in, the whole thing smooths out.  We even used the leftovers for grilled cheese sandwiches the next day!

I served this during cocktail hour of a small dinner party and it went over very well! I did add some mild cheddar, as it is a family favorite, and I also served it with cauliflower, brocolli, and granny smith apple slices. I look forward to making it for holiday parties.

Patience is absolute key when making Fondue, perhaps a little more than with other dishes, but it's worth it. Rush through it, and you'll end up adding a negative review here, likely complaining that you spent a lot of money on expensive cheese and had nothing to show for it. Or eat. :) Read the rest of this for tips on how to ensure this doesn't happen.

Regarding the cheese quantities: there should be about 1/3 more Gruyere than whatever other Swiss cheese! In other words, for every 1 cup of Gruyere, there should be 2/3 cup of Swiss (regardless of the variety you choose). (This, btw, should be all that's needed for a meal for two people.) 

Before grating the cheese, keep it in the freezer for 30 minutes. This will harden it (but not freze it ) making the grating easier. GRATE ON THE SIDE WITH THE LARGE HOLES! (Grating on the grater's small holes may seem like a good idea because the cheese will melt faster, but the necessary flour will not be able to stick to the tiny slivers of cheese.)

The just-grated cheese MUST BE TOSSED WITH THE FLOUR. Do this in a large ziplock bag. It helps if the flour is added through a strainer, in order to minimize clumps; for larger quantities, add the flour in batches, tossing in between. Shake the bag and work it loosely between your hands (without setting it down) for at least a couple of minutes in order to ensure proper coating; the more cheese, the longer it should be tossed. This goes without saying, but do not squeeze the cheese in you

You people have to try this!  
Madras Oregon doesn't have Gruyere cheese so I substituted Costco's parmigiano reggiano cheese instead.  I added a little extra wine, salt and a splash of lemon juice to the recipe.  Paired it with Costco's roasted garlic parmesan bread.  Freakin' amazing!  I ate so much it's nap time!  Goodnight.......

I tried what another reviewer said and mixed the flour with the shredded cheese. It worked just fine and was not lumpy at all. Along with the bread I served apple slices that were peeled and sprinkled with lemon juice to keep them from browning. It was a delicious dinner celebrating  a birthday.

I don't use alcohol because I don't drink it and I don't like the flavor. In place of wine I substituted 3/4 apple juice or grape juice and 1/4 fresh lemon juice. The wine is supposed to emulsify the cheese so it doesn't get stringy, the lemon will do the same. Get good cheese and coat it with the flour first. It awesome!

Took the advice of others and coated cheese with flour and added lemon juice to pot after simmering the wine. Used cheap white wine and still tasted great. Dippers included polish sausage, mushrooms, French bread, red apples, and asparagus!

Maybe there should be specification as to the type of wine used, or type of Swiss, because even with the lemon juice fix, something was off here. I followed the recipe to the letter and was left with what can only be described as string cheese, or cheese taffy maybe. I was able to salvage it by creating a roux of my own with whole milk and adding the cheese glob into that, and serving it in my double boiler. It was still lumpy, but saved my date night and kept me from having to toss expensive cheese. I'm giving it two stars because although I omitted the nutmeg, the flavor was good and complimented all of our dipping items well.

The cheese fondue tasted strange. Also, nobody could eat it because it got all thick and stringy. We added all sorts of liquids to thin it out but it was no good. We turned the heat up and it burned. The cheese melted at first but then it began to thicken. Started from. Scratch with the same two cheeses in a different recipe and it worked!

This recipe had a good consistency - but I did mix my flour in with the shredded cheese (as mentioned by one reviewer). Otherwise, I followed the recipe pretty much to a T.

What I noted, however, was that it was really "winey", a little too much for my preference. I would consider making again with less wine and something else to substitute the remaining liquid (like milk). It tasted more of wine then of cheese, to me.

The flavor on this was great, but we had an executional problem with the consistency. After sitting for about ten minutes, it all separated and was difficult to mix. Maybe our pot wasn't keeping it at the right temperature or something, but we haven't had the same problem with other recipes.

I don't use store bought shredded cheese, shredded my own.  second, I melted about a 1/4 cup of butter, and blended flour into it, cooked it on the stovetop until I got a nutty odor from it, as it blended smoother and prevented graininess.

I like simple recipes with good ingredients and this one is all that.  I didn't use the nutmeg or garlic powder or any addition.  Also, I made it with beer instead of wine which I just like better but that's up to individual taste.   I cut the bread (we used a 7 grain nutty affair) into cubes and slid them under the broiler for a few minutes for crispness and better fork staying power.  I suggest you cut the cheese into cubes and toss them with the flour before adding to the hot beer and stir stir stir.  Add just a few at a time and did I mention to stir stir stir?   It comes out creamy and deliciouseeotitites!!!

Good enough to eat, but I don't plan on making it again.  Not sure what exactly to put my finger on, but the flavor was not appealing to me.  I was snacking on the extra cheese I had before hand and was pleased with the quality of what I bought, I've used the same wine before in other recipes, and I'm accustomed to nutmeg paired with creamy/cheesy dishes, but the combination in this recipe didn't suit me.

I made this tonight and it was my first time to make a cheese fondue from scratch!  It was a huge success and easy!  I added the cheese slowly - letting each 1/4 lb melt before adding the next.  After adding the 2T flour everything blended beautifully!  We loved it - I definitely will share this with all my friends and family!

We made this recipe as an appetizer for Christmas and it was a total hit. I followed the directions for preparation exactly as described in the recipe - except we added a few cloves of minced fresh garlic - and the foundue was creamy and tasted delicious. We used a good Chardonnay, high quality, imported Swiss and Gruyere cheeses and stirred the cheeses into the hot wine in quarter pound increments. We kept our electric fondue pot plugged in and after an hour, the fondue got pretty thick, so we just stirred in a bit more wine to thin it down and it was once again very creamy. We served with cubes of crusty bread, crudités and chunks of fresh pears & apples. This recipe made enough for 6 adults to nibble on all afternoon and everyone enjoyed it.

I have tried several recipes from AllRecipes.com over the years. Mostly they have been good. I have never felt compelled to rate a recipe until today. This is the most disgusting thing I have ever smelled in my life.

This was a super easy and VERY tasty fondue recipe.  I purchased a mix of shredded gruyere and Swiss from Trader Joe's.  Tossed the cheese in the flour before adding to the wine and made it on the stove before putting it in my fondue pot, both recommended by other reviews and I think were perfect suggestions. The ONLY issue was the cheese was TOO thick with only one cup of wine, so I added one more cup of wine and it was perfect.

Excellent classic fondue. Don't like nutmeg, so I omitted that. If you have flour allergies, it's easy to substitute cornstarch or tapioca starch straight up for the flour.

This recipe was perfect!  It was really easy to make a good, homogenized, creamy cheese that was absolutely delicious with our veggies, bread, and apples.  Yum!!  Thank you!

This was a great recipe... for those having clumping problems, I would suggest putting this together in a pot on the oven first.  Bring the wine to a simmer and then gradually add the cheese and flour while whisking.  Once everything is melted and smooth, add it to your fondue pot to keep it warm and creamy.  We had it with french bread, apples, and pears and it was delicious!

Awesome!! I dont own a fondu pot, so I just used a small saucepan on very low heat and poured it in a little dipper sized crock pot.  This went fast and was delicious!  I think next time though I will add less wine, just a little bit less ;-)

Delicious recipe! I ended up halving it since it was just for 2, and it was just the right amount without overstuffing us. The nutmeg added a really nice sweetness that went well with the cheeses.

Very good.  My 12 yr old wanted to try fondue so we had a Fondue Friday while his older sister was on a trip with school.  We had to force ourselves to stop eating it was so good.  I would use a dryer wine then the one I chose.  Served it with a roasted garlic bread, multi grain bread, sourdough, hunter sausage, lightly steamed brocolli and sauteed shrimp.

I didn't read the reviews until after i had already made this and served it. It tasted great so no complaints there. My fondue did start to clump but only when I started to add the flour. I did not add 2 TBL spoons only 1 when I realized it was clumping. Next time I will try lemon juice and hopefully it works out better. Other then that it tasted fine.

So yummy!  Perfect cheese fondue!  I put both my  shredded cheeses and flour in a covered bowl and shook it up really well, so the cheese had a slight flour coat, then slowly added the cheese/flour mixture.  worked well, no clumps!  A must save recipe!

This was the first time I've made fondue, so I made sure to read some of the reviews.  I used Sauvignon Blanc and added the flour to the shredded cheese before adding the cheese to the pot.  I kept the heat on medium while melting the cheese and stirred continuously. Everything worked out wonderfully.  We dipped French bread, califlower and crab...so good.

I followed other's advice and used a vegetable broth instead of white wine, next time I will use the white wine when the kids are not here I also followed the other's advice and mixed the flour with the cheese prior to melting.  I did cook on the stove top for a bit and then added to the fondue pot.  For a truly special dish invest in the real cheese it will be worth it.

This fondue worked like a charm for me. I used a double boiler to melt the cheese in the wine and then put it in my fondue pot.

I had a block of gruyere that I needed to use so fondue was an obvious choice. Other than adding minced garlic I followed the recipe exactly.  I have to guess that a fondue pot is critical.  I did this on the stovetop, patiently stirring in the cheese after about the third handful, I ended up with a lump of stringy cheese in a pot of wine.  I used quality cheese, and a good whine.  I was very frustrated and as a last ditch effort to save the dish we cranked up the heat and stirred vigorously, which did result in a very thick, somewhat stringy, but finally melted pan of cheese.  I also tried the lemon juice trick, and it did not help.  I read a lot of the reviews and I can't quite figure out why this works for some and not for others!  In the future I'll save myself the frustration, for what I spent on the cheese, wine, and dip items the Melting Pot is much less expensive : )   Forgot to mention, this did taste good though!!

Best cheese fondue I've ever made, and we've tried a few!  It was incredibly easy and very smooth.  Some cheese fondues I've tried in the past turned out clumpy or rubbery, but this one was fabulous.

This was so simple and so great!  The trick to getting the cheese to melt smoothly is to mix the flour in with the shredded cheese BEFORE adding it to the wine.  And when adding the cheese, I added it a handful at a time and stirred constantly until the cheese was completely melted before adding more.  It worked great and the cheese was perfect!  I used Jarlsberg for the swiss, and the flavor blended really well with the Gruyere.  I will definitely make this again!

Delicious!!!!  Made for my entire family and we all loved it!  The only hard part was mastering the heat level to keep it at the perfect hot, but not too hot temp.  We'll definitely make it again.

This is our favorite cheese fondue so far! You can get away with using a little higher ratio of swiss to gruyere (since gruyere is considerably more espensive). If you add a little bit of lemon juice at the end, it will keep it a little more of a liquid. Delicious!

What a hit!  I made this last night for some girlfriends and it was gone.  I used cooking white wine (near vinegar in grocery store) added approx. 1 tablespoon lemon juice and forgot to add the flour: it still came out great.  Served with pear, apple, grapes,  pumpernickel, and french bread.

This was my first time making fondue and this recipe was easy and sooooo perfect! I did add about a tsp of lemon juice like someone else had suggested and it was very smooth! I will look no further... this was great! I served this with french bread, mushrooms, broccoli, and shrimp.

This is an excellent recipe for traditional fondue...and a whole lot cheaper than going to a fancy fondue place!  I bought an electric fondue pot which works excellent with this type of recipe!

This fondue was absolutely incredible! We followed the recipe exactly, and were thrilled with it. We had leftovers, so the next day we cooked up some pasta and made the most delicious mac-and-cheese. Don't skimp on the cheese - it's well worth it!

This tasted just like the Fondue I used to eat in Switzerland! Awesome.  Dont' worry if the cheese doesn't thicken up while it's melting. It will thicken up as soon as you add the flour

It's not often that I disagree with a recipe so highly rated, but this just didn't work for me. I gave it three stars, because I didn't go with the super high quality cheeses (didn't want to spend the $$ if the recipe wasn't good) but the recipe also doesn't call for high quality, so... If I had been rating it based on the taste that I achieved - 2 stars. The proportion of wine to cheese was off in my case. I used the stated amounts of both, and had to keep adding wine to try and stop it from becoming one big clump. Also, since DH isn't a huge cheese guy, I only used swiss, and so I really had to add salt at the end (I don't normally salt anything).  I also went with the three star rating because DH has never had fondue before, and said it wasn't bad. As someone who loves fondue, I thought it was so-so, and way to thick. I may try this again with different cheeses, but for now, I'm feeling disappointed in the end result.

Yum - good stuff.  Easy and tasty.  DO NOT add the salt, it definitely doesn't need it.  Also be careful if you substitute broth for the wine because the added sodium might make it too salty.  Also we skipped the nutmeg - no one here is a fan.

Only had swiss cheese on hand and did not have nutmeg, but this recipe turned out GREAT!  Heated 1/2 t. minced garlic in pan before adding wine and also added flour to cheese before melting it.  Will definitely make this again!!!

This is very smooth.  I (to make less dishes) added the butter to the fondu pot then garlic then  wine after a min or two slowly started adding the cheese and a little flour here and there....just keep stirring until it is smooth.  Yummy!

Awesome!  Made as recipe indicated with a squeeze of lemon juice at the end to even out the cheese. Also rubbed my pot with garlic.  Next time will throw in a couple of cloves. Served with Apples, grapes, sausage, and crusty bread. Huge hit and cannot wait to make it again!!!

I loved this fondue.  This was my first cheese fondue, and it turned out absolutely perfect.  I did rub the fondue pot with garlic before putting in my ingredients, and I would reccommend it to others as it added some awesome garlicy flavour. I ended up adding a little more wine after all the ingredients were in to thin it a bit.

I'm writing this as my dear friend suffers from eating too much- this was great, to say the least.  It started a teensy bit too thick, so I added about 1tbs of lemon juice and maybe 1/4 cup of light beer to thin it out.  For 5 people there were no leftovers.  My friends thought it was just as good as the melting pot (I've never been) for about 1/10 of the price! :)

We've used this recipe for several years as part of our annual Christmas Eve fondue dinner, and it's always delicious, always a hit. For the Swiss cheese, it's worth it to splurge and buy Emmantaler (the real stuff!).

This is wonderful!  I made this in a saucepan and then poured it into the fondue pot, and I am so glad I did.  I did add a few drops of lemon juice to help with the clumping, but I think the key is to really stir it hard and fast to get it smoothed out.  Wonderful recipe.  I'm sure I'll be making it again!

Fabulous Fondue! To save some money we used grated white sharp cheddar cheese and swiss cheese. These flavors combined well. We toasted french bread with sesame seeds with olive oil until like toast. It was a nice way to eat lightly with friends and enjoy some conversation and laughs. I definately will make this again.

This was great- I usually buy the packaged cheese fondue from the grocery store and when I couldn't find it, I decided to try this recipe.  It was just as good if not better and very easy!  Made it exactly according to the directions and it turned out great- I wouldn't change a thing!  Even my 2 year old gobbled it right up with bread cubes and cubed green apple.  Yum!

First time making fondue.  Guests were just about licking the pot.  The cheese was a little hard to find, about 10 bucks a pound for the Gyuere and 6 bucks a pound for swiss.  Worth it!  

Changes made:  Heated on stove adding about 3tbs more wine because it wasn't thining out.  Mixed the flour in w/ shredded cheese and added a couple of squirts of lemon juice.

This turned out perfect; followed it as per directions.  I always change up different cheese combos for a different variation.  We introduced our 4 year old son to this the other night and the three of us had a blast!!  Excellent recipe!!!

This was very easy and very good.  I actually took my electric fondue pot on vacation and made it in Lake Tahoe. I did leave out the nutmeg as others mentioned and added Worcestershire sauce and dry mustard. I think next time I won't get such a dry wine or use less. The wine did seem to dominate the flavor when I really wanted the cheese flavor, Not cheap that cheese is quite expensive.  I did find the Emmentaler at COSTCO at about half the grocery store price. I will definitely make again.

This is a splendid, easy cheese fondue.  I find that the taste can vary easily depending on the wine used; I use a local Chateau St. Michelle and it bring out a lovely flavor.  Next time, I plan on throwing in some English cheddar as well, for an extra cheesey umph.

Awesome, traditional fondue.  Following the other reviewers, I used a dry white wine (Sauvingon Blanc).  Perfect consistency and taste!  For my fondue pot (aluminum), I heated the wine and melted the cheese over Sterno.  Then I swapped for two lit tea lights on top of an upside-down ramekin.  That worked perfectly!  And, FYI: If the cheese burns to your fondue pot, heat it on the stove with lemon juice in it... that'll help release the burned bits.

Absolutely incredible! Good on its own, but does need a bit (2 T?) of flour dusted over the cheese and a squirt of lemon juice. I also added a dash of cayenne and fresh ground pepper and it was amazing. Fantastic flavor! 
I used this with sourdough bread, red and green apples, broccoli, etc.

This recipe was well received by my husband for Valentine's Day. He liked it so much he told all of his co-workers about it and several of them asked for the recipe. I too added the flour to the cheese before melting and rubbed the pot with garlic beforehand. Thanks for a great recipe we'll keep in our cookbook for years to come!

This was very good.  Everyone seemed to like it at a party we had.  Too much other food to be the focus, but I liked it and will probably make it again.  Didn't have any issues with lumps.  Thanks!

This turned out to be the most popular item at the Superbowl party. As suggested by many others, I tossed the grated cheeses with the flour and added a sprinkling of lemon juice. The wine I used was a Pinot Grigio.

It has been about 10 years since I made fondue and this was wonderful!  I did rub the pot with clove of garlic and mixed flour and grated cheese together. Reisling wine worked very well.  Used 1/2 loaf of Vienna bread, smoked sausage pieces, shrimp and broccoli for dipping.  No problems with clumping.  Will definitely make this again.

This was my very first attempt at fondue and it was very good!  I followed the directions exactly and had no problem with separation or the cheese not melting.  I did grate the cheese very finely so maybe that helped.  I will say that unless you're a swiss cheese lover, this may not be for you.  Thanks for the great recipe!

For years now, our xmas eve tradition has been beef fondue.  This year I added the cheese fondue and it was a hit with all generations!!  I kept the nutmeg, rubbed the pot with garlic and followed the tip about mixing the cheese with the flour and adding some lemon juice.  It was perfectly yummy!!  A definite add on to our xmas eve.

This was my first attempt at fondue, and it turned out great! I used white cooking wine (that's all I had), and did add some worchestershire sauce, dry mustard and lemon juice. Tasted fantastic...the only problem was that near the end of the meal, the cheese solidified even though the fondue pot was on. The kids loved it! Our favorites were challah and potatoes.

I decided to make this recipe based on all the good reviews.  I spent a lot of money on the fancy cheese and followed the directions exactly.  The fondue was terrible.  The wine mixture never mixed with the cheese so it was runny on the top with a big wad of cheese on the bottom.  The dip smelled bad and made an absolute mess to clean up.

Fantastic fondue!  I came across the same clumping problem that others mentioned, but just kept right on whipping and it came out smooth and creamy.  I added a little worcestershire and served with with bread, mushrooms and apples.  My husband and I loved it!

My husband loves cheese fondue, but I hate kirsh, which this recipe omits (thankfully).  I rub the fondue pot with a little garlic and add a bit of minced onion for extra flavor.

I'm sure it's just my taste, but I didn't enjoy the flavor of this fondue at all.  I doubt traditional cheese fondue is up my alley.  I would try the cheeses first to make sure you'll enjoy the final product.

Hmm...can we do six stars?  This was awesome.  Forget the pricey dinner at the Melting Pot!  I don't have a fondue pot, but cooking it on the stove and transfering it to a mini crocket pot (1 quart size) worked quite well.

Delicious!  I don't normally like the original cheese fondues made with all swiss cheese.. it's usually too bitter for me, but this one was DELICIOUS!  I did add a squeeze of lemon and a dash of garlic powder.  The best swiss cheese fondue i've ever had!

Made this for Valentine's day and forgot to tell everyone; I was nervous and ended up making this 2 hrs ahead of time!  No worries, clumping will be solved with juice of 1 fresh lemon (does not change the taste) and a little more cooking wine.  One tip: don't taste that $7 gruyare cheese before you melt--you will be tempted to devour!  We had a fabulous evening with this recipe...

This was very good - for some reason the cheese started to separate, so it had a layer of oil.  Maybe because we cooked it too long?  We bought a good Gruyere, but used leftover sliced swiss cheese from the deli - it tasted great!

I would've given it a 3 but husband and in-laws love it so much that they rate it a 5 stars.  I had to add about 2 TBSP of lemon juice and 1/2 cup of milk in addition because it was too thick.  Cheese is stringy and there isn't anything I was able to do to fix it.

I have made a few different cheese fondues before and have been successful, but this recipe was a disaster for me. It was beyond stringy. The consistency left a lot to be desired.

I was very impressed with this recipe. This was the first time that I had ever made fondue before, and I was very excited about the results. Don't substitute anything for the gruyere- this cheese is the ticket to making your fondue creamy.I served this with apples and french bread infused with roasted garlic cloves. Wonderful!

We love this recipe just as it is.  I often steam broccoli to serve with the bread for dipping.. and for the kids, hot dogs.

This tasted wonderful, but I had problems with the texture...it was very stringy and thick. I served it with cubed french bread, leftover Christmas ham that I cubed, Granny Smith apple chuncks, and steamed broccoli. Yummy! Thanks for sharing!

It was soooo good!  We followed the recommendations of several reviewers and added lemon juice, it didn't get grainy or greasy at all.  We used a half loaf of pumpernickel rye bread, cut into 1.5 inch cubes, drizzled with olive oil, and lightly toasted in the oven.  We also used summer sausage, boiled baby potatoes and steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  The broccoli and cauliflower kept falling apart in the fondue, but that's my fault for steaming them too long.  Fantastic fondue!

This was exactly the fondue recipe I was seeking - the taste was exactly what I was hoping for!  I had no problem with the cheese becoming oily, or any other problems that other users experienced.  It started to get stringy once it cooled, but that was solved with a quick trip back to the stove to re-melt (or shopping for a Sterno can for the fondue pot!).  I added a bit of garlic to the fondue and served it with hearty bread cubes, apples, blanched cauliflower and broccoli, and small cooked waxy potatoes.  Very tasty - destined to appear in our kitchen again and again.

Absolutely wonderful! For anyone who might say this recipe isn't very good, I suggest trying  different brands of cheeses. That can make a huge difference in the flavor & grease amount.  I mix the flour into the shredded cheese before melting to prevent flour lumps. I also add black pepper, fresh garlic, & about 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I serve with bread and Granny Smith apple pieces. My husband said it's better than the Melting Pot's!!! I suggest having extra shredded cheese on hand in case it needs thickening.  If it's too thick, add a small squirt of lemon juice.

This is the first time I've made or had fondue so I have nothing to compare it to. I thought it was wonderful! We ate so much we made ourselves sick! Warmed it up the next day and had left overs...just as good the second day. It's a little expensive but well worth the cost.

I found this an easy and excellent recipe. We made it for our New Years party. It has a very strong swiss cheese flavor that goes well with a very strong cabernet.

When we added the flour, the fondue suddenly became oily, but I think that helped it to stay liquid longer. We put it in a pumpernickel bread bowl and dipped bread and veggies in it.

Incredible recipe. We added 1T lemon juice to the wine as suggested by another reviewer to insure a better meled cheese consistency and everything turned out perfectly. We also substituted Emmental instead of swiss. Will be making this a monthly tradition. We served this with sourdough bread cubes, cornichon, black olives, grape tomatoes, & mini potatoes.

Simple and absolutely delicious. I made the cheese fondue on the stovetop and then poured it into my fondue pot, so it didn't take long to get the cheeses melted. We dip baguettes, miniature dill pickles, lightly steamed broccoli, pretzel rods, cooked shrimp, and more.

Liked how the cheddar made it taste a little “Swissy” but I would have preferred a little smoother or slight less think and goey. But still our new favorite fondue.

I added some heavy cream because I think I cooked off too much wine. The heavy cream added a great creamy flavor to it. I’ll use the heavy cream with this recipe in the future. It was a huge hit.

It was very easy but I wish I would have read the reviews beforehand.  My cheese didn’t separate very well   Now I see a solution, it tasted excellent even though.

This was amazing! My husband kept remarking "This is real fondue! like...real real fondue!" He was in such shock that it wasn't a big blob of sad cheese. 

I followed the top comments and added just a few drops of lemon + tossed the cheese in the flour prior to adding. I don't know if this made a difference, but I figured it couldn't hurt. This was gooey, easy to dip in, stringy, and just plain delicious!

This was SO good, Had a stay at home Valentine's Dinner - this was the star. It was perfect - easy and delicious. We tried the version with garlic powder as we had no nutmeg. Made as written otherwise. Excellent. Got raves from everyone. Will have again soon for another easy  convenient meal. Thanks for a great recipe.

The reason why this fondue is clumpy is because the flour is added by itself to the liquid.  To ensure a smooth fondue, you have two choices:  1. Create a roux first in the pot, then add the (warm) liquid or 2. put the grated cheese in a paper bag along with 2 Table Spoons of flour.  shake it well and add it SLOWLY to the heated liquid while mixing constantly.  I prefer the second approach but either way, you'll end up with a silky smooth fondue.  Enjoy!

Good recipe with a couple changes. My Swiss family uses corn starch instead of flour.  It's mixed into a paste with Kirsch and added toward the end of cooking. Also, we use a lot of garlic on the sides of the  pot, and even take the remainder of the clove, finely minced,  to add to the cheese.  Yum!

Have used this all purpose/basic recipe twice.  Great taste and texture.  I add a little fresh grated parmesean cheese, as well.  My family loves this!
I am adding to my original review and comments...My family has this as a Christmas eve tradition and for my youngest(14) son's birthday.  We all love this festive tradition!!

Followed the recipe and could only get this to barely smoooth out with constant brisk stirring - which is okay unless you want to actually serve it.  We could only eat it by applying it to food with utensil, not by dipping. It was just too thick and lumpy. Prior to serving it tried to salvage with a little lemon juice as suggested in reviews and that didn’t help at that point.  Will try something different next time.

Did without the nutmeg and added half chicken broth instead of wine, it was super tasty! Also added a touch of Dijon and lemon to keep the cheese from separating!

Made exactly as directed.  Delicious splurge type of thing!  Husband like the lightly steamed broccoli the best, followed by baguette pieces.  I saved some of the last of the fondue and included it with the eggs  in my new year's day morning frittata - really good.

Perfect! I did not use the cornstarch; used a whisk to stir the cheese when on the stove. Lemon juice was a good addition.

I needed a recipe for a LARP event a few summers ago.  I made the base ahead of time and put it in a mason jar to travel (I was making it 48 hrs ahead of when I would need it).  It travelled well and went over fabulously!  I substituted Moniack Mead for the white wine (Honey based "wine" vs grapes)  I found it lent a fuller flavour than other fondues I've made and used 1/3 lb each of Emmental, Gruyere and Smoked Gouda.  I served it with a variety of breads, crackers, meats and veg and it was a smash hit!  Even people not normally fond of things like this sang it's praises!

Made this with some friends and we had a blast. I can't stress too much about how important it is to FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS.  We got over excited and messed up following the instructions and ended up with a big clump of cheese. Definitely not the recipes fault because we did the best we could about eating it and it was delicious. Oh, did I mention we had never made fondue before?  Will definitely make again (soon) and follow the instructions.

Since my family doesn't care for Swiss cheese, I substituted sharp cheddar (along with the Gruyere). It was fabulous! Thanks, Sheila, for sharing your recipe.

This was a good cheese fondue. It was easy to make.  We ate it with sourdough bread, broccoli, and a green apple. You can really taste the nutmeg, which we'll probably do less of next time. We also added some green onions.

Couldn't eat it.  What a waste of good wine and cheese.  The cheese separated from the wine and became a rubbery ball.  I had throw it away.  I will never make this recipe again!

I've been making this fondue for 40 years, on a slightly larger scale. I've always used 8 oz. swiss, 8 oz. sharp cheddar, and 1.5 cups any dry white wine. The techniques: Toss the shredded cheese with the (3 T.) flour.  Rub a cut garlic clove around the pot before pouring the wine in (leave the clove in the pot.) When the wine starts to bubble lightly, add the cheese mixture a little at a time, stirring constantly in one direction only, until it melts in. Continue to add cheese in batches,  melting each batch before adding more. When it's all in, continue stirring for a few minutes until it's completely smooth. Don't let it boil. I've always served it with cubed French bread, broccoli florets, and chopped apples for dipping.

This is great, but I had to make on stove and transfer over to fondue pot.  Used Gruyere and Elem.

Great cheese fondue. I used expensive cheese and cheap wine, and it tasted great to me. Husband loved it. It was great w Granny Smith apples and tortilla chips.

Simple but very good fondue.  Used the grated swiss/gruyere mix from Trader Joe's.

The supermarket was out of Gruyere cheese so I used Emmentaler cheese to substitude. I used milk, cornstarch, white wine, emmentaler and swiss only and it tasted great. It was clumping at first and wasn't combing well but after I added cornstarch (mix on the side with a bit of water first) then it was mixing well.

I've made fondue many times but this is now my favorite recipe. Served it with baguette slices as well as raw broccoli and cauliflower florets. So delicious and really easy to make. Can't wait to make it again!

I used  a block of the cheese cut into one inch cubes, mixed cheese with flour it before heating.  I left out the nutmeg.  The entire family loved it.

Oh my goodness, this was horrible! It came out beautifully; very creamy, no lumps. I was very optimistic & excited to try it. Not one person liked it.  
We are lovers of a good cheese & thought making a fondue would be fantastic- we will never, ever use this recipe again.

This was delicious!  5 of us ate the entire pot!  (literally ever last bit!).  I served this with bread, green grapes, and apples.  Will make again for sure!  Mine was very smooth, not lumpy at all.  I used higher end cheeses.

I have been making this for years and it is excellent with a few different things:  I use all swiss cheese, and I toss the shredded cheese with the flour first instead of adding the flour later.  I used a clove or two of garlic using a garlic press to infuse the fondue with the flavor.  It is absolutely delicious!  Note:  to those who found it lumpy. I add the cheese a few handfuls at a time and stir with a fork until completely melted, then add more.  Mostly it comes out smooth and creamy.  I usually use  french or italian bread for dippers, toasted in the oven first for firmness, but you can also use fresh pineapple, strawberries or whatever you prefer.

Flour is what is clumping this recipe. What a waste of $30 of cheese. This recipe is costing people money LOTS. Please change it to cornstartch as THAT is what is used to make fondu. I am so PISSED. I feel this website owes me for the cheese.

Easy to make and tasted good.  I used a french white wine and mixed the grated cheeses with the flour before adding it to the simmering wine. No problems with lumps. I didn't measure either cheese  - just grated 2 blocks and added both to the wine. No garlic on hand, but that would have helped the flavor I think. Will make again.

I don't know what happened but I used the cheeses the recipe called for but they wouldn't melt smoothly.  When I added the flour it turned into a lump.  A total catastrophe.

I used Swiss raclette cheese and shredded Swiss cheese (Cracker Barrel). I also added just a squeeze lemon juice as other reviewers had suggested. The fondue was DELICIOUS! As soon as the flour was incorporated, the cheese turned soft and gooey. I did not need to add nutmeg or salt as the fondue was tasty even without it.

It may have something to do with quality of cheese, etc...,but I used high end gyuere, and Walmart Swiss. It ended up in a smooth ball of melted cheese. Hmm. Added lemon juice, then more lemon juice. Stir stir stir.  Hmm. No real change.
How I salvaged my precious fondue: added half and half, stirred until cheese mixture wouldn't let in any more liquid, then added "gluten-free" flour. Kept alternating the two until I got what I wanted. Definitely good, but I'm sure if I started with gluten free flour and more liquid in the beginning, it'd be a better, smoother product.

I admit that I am a very picky eater, and today is the first time I decided to try fondue.  This is a good recipe, but I think I would cut back on the Gruyere next time.  It's quite strong, at least for my tastes.   This first try, I cut it back to about three ounces and used  3 oz of white cheddar I had left, and even then it was pretty strong.  Although, I used Jarlsburg cheese instead of Swiss, so maybe that's part of it.   

Also, the lemon and flour advice is very helpful.  :)

I followed the tip to add garlic to the wine while it's simmering and tossing the cheese in the flour and it turned out perfect. It was the perfect valentines day dinner even my picky boyfriend loved it.

I served this at a family gathering and it was a hit with adults and kids alike! I used a Riesling instead of a dry white wine and really liked the note of sweetness from the Riesling to counteract the bolder cheeses. Will certainly make again!

Did not like this at all. The Gryere cheese is too strong, and did not even use all of it.  Girl friends did not like it either.

Wonderful! I wanted a classic fondue & this is it! I did add a tablespoon of corn starch to each of the cheeses, as I ground them in the food processor.  I added a tiny amount of lemon juice as it was cooking and used Wondra, instead of regular flour.

I made this for New Years Eve and it was fabulous!!  Easy to make too.  I used french bread, mushrooms, red and orange peppers.. and the cheese coated everything perfectly.  Yum!

Not anything like the Melting Pot even with the suggestions of using corn starch mixed with cheese and adding lemon juice.  The flavor was alright but the texture was awful!!!

I used Gouda instead of Gruyere and maybe thats why mine didnt turn out well but it never got to a liquidy smooth consistancy. It was a little lumpy and would harden on the bread :/

Made this on Christmas Day and what a delightful treat!!  Served with apples, cauliflower, all-beef summer sausage, and French bread and we ate every last drop!  I did take a suggestion from other reviewers and added the flour to the cheese and mixed it before adding it to the pot.  Also, no doubt about it...you need a little lemon juice to prevent clumping. And add a small amount of cheese at a time, stir, stir, stir and then add the lemon juice and it will save you.  My fondue pot's direction also suggested rubbing a clove of garlic on the pot once warm, before the wine was added, which gave it a nice taste too.

TIP: let the cheese melt/cook for 30-45 mins, slowly. It's best when the cheese is bubbling on the edges and the bread nearly melts into it.

This was good but I have had better. I think I might have put too much nutmeg. I also should have used some lemon like others suggested because mine was not very smooth.

I made this with chardonnay and it turned out perfect!  I did follow the suggestion to mix the flour with the shredded cheese and added it in 1/4's and waited for that 1/4 to melt before adding the next.  I also added some garlic salt and about 2 T of butter at the end.  Wowzer, nice, cheesey fondue.  Thanks for the recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly, the cheese never melted all the way, and stayed in thick lumps. Would probably have been good, but it was a big mess and didn't thicken.

I made it exactly as the recipe prescribed, and it turned out great.  I love garlic, so I may try rubbing the pot with garlic first next time just to add a different flavor.

Just came back from France.  Wanted to try a fondue recipe.  Delicious.  Very similar.  Only thing I did a little different was added a little butter to wine simmer and used a lot more wine.

I made this for Valentine's day with our neighbors. Everyone loved it! It is the best fondue I've ever had and everyone else agreed (we all eat fondue a lot, but rarely make it ourselves). I read the reviews and mixed the flour with the cheese in advance. I also added 1 tablespoon of lemon. It did not turn into a cheese brick and I will DEFINITELY make this again!

I did this for my honey for New Year's Eve and we loved it. If you follow the directions right, it turns out correctly. We didnt have any problems with it. We had green apples, french bread and some veggies with it. We are doing it again this weekend for Valentine's Day.  I think  I might add some cayenne pepper to spice it up.

This is THE best cheese fondue I've EVER had!  We are in a euchre group and I am asked to bring it every month and there is never a drop to take home!  I make this on top of the stove and put it in a mini crock pot to keep it warm.  It's stays smooth and warm.

This was delicious - but I had to add an extra cup of wine to make it 'dippable.' It was kind of annoying to have to put the fondue pot on the stove! Still, really good once it was done! Four stars because I had to add more wine than is called for.

I've tried several cheese fondue recipes and this was my favorite!  I used a dry Sauvignon Blanc (Hogue Sauvignon Blanc) from Trader Joes.  I grated the cheese and it started to turn into a big lump so I stirred it less and added several drops of lemon juice.  We ate the entire pound of cheese!

Made exactly as written except I tossed the flour with the cheese. This was my first time buying Gruyere, wow, it's expensive. ($10) It was very good. I asked my husband if it was worth the expensive cheese. He said that if we had company it would definately be worth it, but for just the two of us maybe we won't buy the expensive stuff next time.

This fondue was so good.  I am new to fondue and the bottom of the pot started to overcook, but my guests and I were still taking bites of the cheese it was so delicious!  Will definitely make again and again.

This fondue came out grit-like (grainy). I'm not a huge fan of grits, so I dont think this will be a repeat recipe. Although, we didn't use lemon and that may solve the texture issue we had. Give it a whirl.

I have made this recipe numerous times for fondue parties (fondue is just what I love to do) and this is ALWAYS the favorite. Typically I make the recipe as is, but if I'm trying to save a little or don't have enough Gruyere I have used 3/4 Swiss to 1/4 Gruyere and it still tastes fabulous!

WOW this was delicious! but man is Gruyere cheese pricey! I 1/4thed the recipe because it was just my fiancé and I eating it as an appetizer for regular fondue and it was still to much for us to finish! I barley had room for the steak and chicken we had prepared because we loved this cheese so much! The only thing we did different was to use sour dough and French bread, both were delicious and I did add a few drops of lemon juice to the wine when simmering to ensure the cheese did not have lumps. I will use this recipe every time we do fondue!

This was delicious! It tastes just like the Melting Pot version.  I used about 2 Tbs of garlic powder in addition to everything else.

This was pretty good but not as exiting as I thought it would be given the number of stars. It had a sharp taste with the gruyere cheese. Won't make again. Kids definetely didn't like it .

We love The Melting Pot resturant and this is one of our favorite cheese starters. Very close to what they serve. I'm going to pay attention next time to see if they add the garlic or not. We had granny smith apples, carrots, celery, and cauliflower just like at the resturant. I did add the flour to the shredded cheese and used the Emmenthauler Swiss along with the Gruyer. Great Recipe!

Like someone else commented, I don't see what is giving everyone else trouble. I had never made cheese fondue before and it turned out great! I don't have a fondue pot so I made it on my stovetop and transferred it to a fondue pot at the party, where it was a hit. I don't drink wine and know nothing about it, so thank you to those who suggested a sauvignon blanc--otherwise I would have been lost.

This was really good. It was my first time making a fondue from scratch and it was super easy. I did feel there was too juch nutmeg but I am not a fan of nutmeg so next time I will use less.

I made this on New Year's Eve for my husband and I and it turned out to be very yummy.  I added some squirts of lemon juice when it wouldn't melt smoothly.  It was even yummy the next day when I reheated it.

This fondue turned out fine but has a very sharp flavor in mt opinion, and I like sharp cheeses. The white wine and the swiss-make a strong combo. If you like that then its good. (Also I had to add more wine so it was thin enought to dip in).If you prefer something a more mellow but still lots of flavor then try the parmesan fondue. I made both at my last gathering and the parmesan was by far the prefered by everyone. It was completely gone while this recipe hardly got touched.  The parmesan also stayed melted better. I did use high quality ingredients as everyone suggested.

My husband and I are not big valentine's day fans so we opted out this year.  At the last minute, I decided we should do something special for dinner so we decided to try fondue.  This recipe was awesome and for once we didn't augment it.

This recipe was pretty great. Next time I will try rubbing the pot with garlic or adding a clove since I see a lot of recipes do that. I did have it in the pot for a long time, turned oily but that's to be expected with melted cheese. This makes ALOT!

The women loved this fondue and the guys thought it was pretty good. I used the lemon juice suggestion to keep the cheese from clumping and it turned out great. I didn't use the full amount of guyere cheese to ease the pungent flavor and it was perfect. I melted it in a saucepan first and then transferred it to the fondue pot.  We used bread to dip and yummy!

I made this recipe and it was the best fondue I have ever had. Very easy to make.  Just add the flour to the cheese before adding to the wine and it won't clump up.  Also simmer the wine not boil it.  Delicious

The flavor of this cheese fondue was great. Took the advice of others and made the following adjustments:
:: dash of mustard powder
:: dash of worcestershire sauce
:: replaced salt with kosher salt
:: dash of minced garlic
:: dash of lemon juice to the wine to help keep from clumping

We served this with pear wedges, baguette bread and carrots. Also cut the recipe in half, and had plenty to serve for a group of 4 adults and 3 small children.

The consistency was a bit lumpy still, but I would make this again!

Wonderful - I used the suggestion to toss the shredded cheese with the flour before adding it to the wine and added 5-6 drops of lemon juice - the fondue was creamy with no lumps. I also added one clove of garlic to the wine as it simmered, removing it before adding the cheese. Great flavor and everyone raved over it!

I couldn't get this recipe to come out right, it came out all lumpy. I'm guessing I did something wrong but I'm not sure what. I heated the wine first and then added the cheese a little at a time but I couldn't seem to get the cheese for fully melt and incorporate itself with the wine. In the end, it was lumpy but it still tasted good.

This fondue is absolutely incredible. The only change I made was tossing the cheese in the flour instead of adding it later. It turned out a little thin at first but I added a little cornstarch and it came out perfectly. I will use this recipe every time I make cheese fondue from now on.

Oh my goodness, this was horrible. I served this at a Patriots-Giants superbowl party and got very bad reviews. I had to take it away from the table! The flavor was so strong, no matter what we paired it with, all we could taste was the cheese.

I cut down this recipe to serve 3, and followed the recommendations to rub the pot (in my case, it's cast iron) with garlic and mix the cheese and flour in advance. I used a Spanish Rueda wine, which I highly recommend. It took forever to grate the cheese, but it's an easy and very good recipe. This time we ate it with sauted mushroom caps and some dark Chiabatta bread. And there will definitely be a next time!

This is hands down the best cheese fondue recipe I've ever used. It's all about the Gruyere cheese. Amazing!!! I was tempted to stand over the pot before my guests arrived and eat the entire thing. I did mix the flour w/ the cheese before putting in the pot as someone suggested. I had no problems with lumps.

This was a hit at our New Years Party.  Just a note I used Sutter Homes Pino Grigio I did not care for that type. I will try again with another wine.

I personally would use some different chesses.  Although I do like swiss this was a little overkill.  Maybe mix it up with something else.  This is a great starting point to work from.

I think my fondue pot was just too hot for this recipe; the end result was too thick, and the wine kept separating from the cheese.  Still, it tasted fantastic.  I'll be tweaking my technique in future endeavors.

I followed this recipe exactly and thought it tasted great!  I did have a problem keeping it edible though.  After awhile in the fondue pot it was one solid piece of rubber that was impossible to dip anything in.  No one else seems to have this problem, so if anyone can tell me what I did wrong, I'd like to know!  I tried the lemon juice to break it down, and that didn't work either.  The recipe tasted great, though!

Great recipe! The only thing different I would add is maybe some pepper and then some garlic in it. But otherwise it was a great hit! Perfect consistancy.

This fondue was a huge hit at my mother in law's birthday party!  It has the perfect blend of flavor and is so easy to throw together.  Perfect with french bread and veggies!

This recipe is really good but I have found that tossing a little cornstarch in with the shredded cheese has worked the best.  I use sauvignon blanc and no nutmeg.  Turns out great every time!

This was a great fondue, and very easy.  I made it without the nutmeg because I didn't have any at the time, but next time I will try it for sure.

Was a little bitter tasting to me, but the rest of my guests enjoyed it. Also, was a little thick and stringy and hard to dip softer breads into. Was fun and something different. Would make again for a special occasion.

I have made this several times.  Sometimes, it is perfect.  Sometimes, the cheese does not melt properly and then it is not so good.  Not sure what I am doing different, but results have been spotty.

Texture was grainy.  I had hoped for a smooth and creamy texture.  The flavor was fine and those that tried it at our Christmas party had the same comments.  We had leftovers because the texture was not appealing to most.  I spent good money for the best cheeses too, so I don't think it was quality of ingredients.  bummer!

Everyone said this was very good served with French bread. I serve it as an appetizer before dinner to entertain dinner guests and family.  I didn't even taste it because I was busy cooking in the kitchen.
