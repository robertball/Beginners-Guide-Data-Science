This recipe is a keeper.  We loved it!  However, I did mine in the oven.  I like to serve flank steak with a sauce and if you pour the marinade over the steak before roasting you are left with an awesome gravy that is great over potatoes too!  Also, marinating overnight is great, but you should try this even if you only have an hour to marinate.

Fajita meat was my target.  My alterations to the recipe were; using balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar, using a grainy-type mustard (I used Beaver Deli Mustard) in place of dijon and then low sodium soy sauce.  Everything went into a ziploc bag, then into the refrigerator for 8 hours.  The flavor of the thinly sliced steak FAR exceeded my expectation.  The feedback I got from my family was, "Mmm mm MMMM" and "mmM mMmmm MMmmMM!".  I think that means its a keeper, thanks Connie for a fantastic addition to my recipe collection.

This marinade recipe is the only one we will ever use when making grilled flank steak for fajitas! I did make a couple of additions. Since we were using it for fajitas I added 1/2 T. ground Coriander and 1/2 T. ground Cumin. For the vinigar I used Balsamic. We left the steak in a zip lock for 2 days and when my husband sliced it, it could have been cut with a fork! I'm embarrassed to even mention how much we ate! Thank You Connie!

I cooked this in my broiler for 8 mins. on each side, basting occasionally with marinade.  It was medium rare and quite good. Nice way to tenderize a tougher piece of meat.

This was my second time making this recipe for steak fajitas.  This time, I added 1.5 teaspoons of ground cumin and corriander, along with a small handful of cilantro leaves, then substituted fresh lime juice and added a little lime zest.  This time there were no complaints of bland steak, and the fajitas were a big hit!

This was a great way to make fajitas, I never thought to bbq a flank steak before. I marinated the meat for 48 hours (and added some slices of sweet onion, red and yellow pepper to the marinade an hour before I was ready to grill). We put the vegetables in tin foil and cooked them on the bbq as well (they took longer than the steak which we cooked to medium) We sliced the meat into thin strips with an electric knife and served with the vegetables, tortillas, cheese, sour cream, salsa, and guacamole. They were awesome!!!

WOW!  Because of the rave ratings, I grilled last night in 40 degree, rainy, windy weather.  It was well worth it!  The only change I made was I substituted balsmaic vinegar for the red wine vinegar.  Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe!  This will be one of the 'regulars' on my grill this summer.

Well worth the 5 star rating.  After reading through the many reviews, I divided the flank steak equally and marinated overnight.  One flank steak was marinated exactly as the receipe recommends.  The second flank steak was marinated using a good quality balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar and adding a 1/4 tsp of hot pepper flakes.  Barbequed them side by side and it smelled so delicious a few neighbors wandered into the backyard and stayed to have dinner.  While the red wine vinegar marinade was good, the balsamic vinegar marinade was voted far superior.  Served fajita style with roasted red peppers and yellow onions, avocado's, sour cream, warm tortillas and Mexican rice from Allrecipes.  Mix up a batch of margaritas and you have the makings of a fiesta!

THIS IS AWESOME! I have been on a mission for years to find a good home-created fajita marinade.  I love Chili's fajitas, and these are just as good!  I did add about a tbs. of sugar to the marinade since I prefer a tinge of sweetness, but you MUST try this.  Be sure to marinade for the FULL TIME given in recipe.  Otherwise, the taste may not come out right.  Good as leftovers the next day too!

Recipe delivered all that it said it would.  I marinated for 24 hours and for flank steak it was moist and not tough at all.  Since we are not big eaters, I did not cook half of the steak.  Instead I put it into a crockpot, the next day, along with mexican spices and cooked for 6 hours on low.  We had wonderful, shredded fajitas!  Thanks for sharing!

I followed this recipe exactly except added 1/2 t. dried basil and scored the steak both ways on the diagonal.  Let it stand over night  and cooked it on the grill--DELICIOUS.  A dead ringer for my Mom's recipe!  Worth every star.

This is a great recipe.  It is because it is from Weber Grill.  This poster did not "invent" this recipe.  Unless you mean copying and posting it as inventing.

I would give this more stars if I could!!  The only change we make is using olive oil instead of vegetable and balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine.  I have even used this with chicken.  I've also cooked a roast in the slow cooker with this.  I am addicted to it!

I thought this marinade was wonderful! I used balsamic vinegar simply because I like the tangy taste of it, and added crushed red pepper flakes for some heat. I followed the rest of the recipe as listed. I marinaded the steak for 24 hours. Grilled about 8 minutes each side. I let the meat rest on the counter for 15 minutes before thinly slicing. While the meat was resting, I put the marinade on the stove and slow boiled it for about 5 minutes. Once the meat was sliced, I poured the marinade over the top. I served the flank steak on a toasted hoagie bun with a mound of sauteed onions, and a garden salad on the side. Absolutely delish! Thank you for a great recipe.

This was a great marinade for flank steak! Probably the best I've tried yet. I would suggest that you let the meat reach room temperature before grilling rather than cooking it straight out of the refrigerator as the recipe suggests. It makes for a more tender steak.

Great base for your own marinade creation. We like to use flank steak for fajitas and so I needed to alter this recipe a bit. My alterations include 1/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup basalmic vinegar, 1/8 cup soy sauce, extra garlic. Otherwise the soy sauce is overwhelming and the marinade tastes asian. Whole family loves it with this changes and this is my go to marinade for flank steak on the grill.

I've made this a few times and every time people have loved it. I think I have passed along the printed recipe 3-4 times now.

The only thing I have done different is marinated at least 24 hours and in one case it was 48 hours. So amazing after that.

I used this recipe the first time with balsamic vinegar bc I didn't have any red wine vinegar. It was AWESOME! The next time, I used red wine vinegar and we didn't like it as much. So the 50 times I've made it, I use balsamic bc it gives it a better flavor. Also, I slice the steak up first and put it in a big ziploc bag to marinate. Then I lay the slices out on the counter top George Foreman grill I have and cook them that way. Pair them with sauteed onion & bell pepper, sour cream and cheese and you have PERFECT fajitas! The kid loves them and so does the picky, chef hubby.

This is a version of a recipe I have used for several years.  Try adding some rosemary to the marinade.  It is always a winner! Great for tough cuts of meat.  Also works great with top sirloin.  Here's a tip - don't overcook the meat. It tastes wonderful cooked medium rare or medium and serve with some horseradish sauce - YUM!  I'm getting hungry.

After having this (yet again!) tonight, updating my March review:  We grill this every week or so and it's truly addicting! Unfortunately, this week's heat wave made grilling uncomfortable, so after marinating, it was thrown in the freezer.  Thawed & grilled it today and was even MORE tender and flavorful!!  ************** I'd attempted flank steak only once before & it was a disaster - as it was a "two-for", we tried THIS recipe on the second steak.  OUTSTANDING!  Going into our regular rotation.  Thanks!

Marinated for 6 hours. I did this recipe exactly. Steak had a strong taste to it but couldn't finger the problem. I will stick to my own recipe next time.

This is a great recipe that I make at least twice a month.  My family loves it!  Due to personal preferences my minor changes include: cutting vegetable oil to 1/3 cup, balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, lime juice instead of lemon, added 1 tsp ground cumin, and some fresh cilantro.  Our dinner time is certainly improved by adding this recipe to our rotation!

This recipe was so easy and tasted FANTASTIC.  I always love to marinade meat in Italian dressing but this takes the cake.  Luckily we ate it all because if there was any left, I would have kept eating it.  Way to go on this easy, great tasting recipe.  I  wouldn't change a thing.

I have to admit I was a little unsure about all of the salt and acid in this marinade, but I tried it .  I'm a believer now!  This is the best marinade ever!  My search is over.  I'll be making this one only from now on!

I pierced the meat on both sides with a fork before pouring on the marinade.  I marinated the steak for 24 hours and did turn the meat a few times.  I wasn't sure if this flank steak would be too chewy but it was great.  To serve it, my husband cut it on the diagonal in very thin slices.  This would be great with a sauteed mushroom recipe on this site (Pat's mushroom saute) too.

DEEEEELICIOUS!!  Ive never made flank steak, and this is the BOMB.  My kids are raving right now.  Made fajitas with this, put the veggies in a foil packet, grilled the steak.  This is going into the family meal, and entertaining meal rotation for sure!  I used limes instead of lemons cuz thats what I had and it was superb.  Thanks for a fab recipe!!

This recipe definitely imparts a TON of flavor that stays with the beef and does a fabulous job of tenderizing. I used balsamic vinegar as many other reviewers because it was what i had on hand and marinated for 24 hours which I think is very important if you have the time. With a few personal tweaks for my family's taste, definitely a keeper!

I have a very similar recipe, but I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil because it has a higher smoke point and helps to keep the sugars from blackening too quickly.  Try it with Orange/pineapple juice instead of the lemon juice and add a small can of tomato sauce. Awesome!

this was so good and very easy.  I have tried to get this taste for a couple of years without success.  Then I tried this one and VOILA! Great taste and most all the ingredients are always in the fridge.  Should also be listed under 'carne asada'.

My kids LOVED this. For our family of four we really needed more than 1 1/2 lbs of meat but that was all we had at the time. I am going try the marinade with a different cut of meat tonight.

This is my teenage son's favorite thing to eat!  I have probably made it 30 times since finding this recipe.  I make it exactly like the recipe says except I broil it in the oven.  I boil the discarded marinade and use it as a sauce.  Amazing!

This was amazing! I only had 4 hours to marinate the steak and it was still wonderful. I tried it with chicken that we grilled last night and it was excellent as well.  New favorite for my whole family!

I served this to a crowd of 14 on Saturday night and they loved it!  Served them as fajitas with sauted green and red peppers and Vidalia onions.  I doubled the marinade for 2 - 2 lb flank steaks.  I scored them first and placed each with marinade in a 2 gallon plastic ziploc bag for 6 1/2 hours.  One steak was thinner and it was grilled for 3 min. each side.  The other took 5 min. per side.  Both were medium rare.  They were awesome.  I plan to serve this again when relatives arrive next Monday.  Thanks, Connie.

Oh my goodness.  This recipe is just awesome.  I didn't change a single thing.  We cooked it on the grill, medium rare and it turned out delicious.  If I changed anything at all next time, it would be to cut down on the Dijon mustard.  It was just a tad overpowering but certainly nothing that kept us from devouring it!

Have been using this marinade for flank steak on the grill the past two years and our family thinks the steak comes out delicious.  I use lower sodium soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce and the steak comes out great tasting.  Our preference is for balsamic vinegar so replace the red wine vinegar with that.  Thank you for submitting the recipe!

This marinade was amazing...and I stuck with the Red Wine Vinegar. We couldn't stop eating it. My family doesn't eat leftovers and we were fighting for it the next day. I did marinate for 36 hours which tenderized the meat fabulously.

A decent easy marinade. This is a good version for when you don't want a marinade whose flavors are too strong. It is a good subtle flavor that adds to the meat rather than becomes the flavor of the meat as with some other stronger marinades.

This is a great marinade for any steak and fabulous on a flank steak. I have not had fresh lemons before and subbed bottled lime juice which still came out great.  What I love about this marinade is the lack of honey and brown sugar...needless sugar. This will be our household go to marinade.

Blast flavor to your taste buds by marinating the full  hours or better. Lift marinaded meat into skillet with a suitable dredger/fork to allow it to drain and stir-fry until all the liquid has evaporated, transferring full flavor to the beef -- but do not cook until dry.

(Give the hungry pooch the raw beef marinade.)

This was an amazing marinade that I made with fajitas consisting of large soft tortilla wraps, stir-fried onions and yellow & orange bell peppers.

I was looking for a lemon marinade because I had fresh lemons but no fresh limes.

Delicious! . . . And definitely going into my recipe box as a favorite.

We have been using a recipe almost exactly like this for about 40 years!  We use it on flank steak and also on chicken that we smoke. We use about 1/2 cup worcestershire, Ponzu (lemon soy sauce) and balsamic vinegar and no lemon.  Sometimes we add a small can of pineapple juice also.  We made up the recipe as young marrieds. First used it on beef kabobs.  I think any combination of these ingredients would work. Love, love, love it!!!!!

I just started catering small parties and I planned a fajita bar because of the tight budget. I WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER MARINADE FOR FAJITAS AGAIN. It was the BOMB! The comments were awesome and the crowd of 60 clapped when they were finished. I served alongside the roasted tomato salsa from this site, frijoles a la charra, salsa verde, and a jicama salad. What a hit. I did add lemon slices and put them in with the marinade and he meat. Only change I made.

Made for dinner tonight with grilled garlic potatoes and parmesan corn on the cob from this site.  The marinade tasted wonderful.  I was only able to marinate for about 3 hours.  It was great.  Thanks for the post.

This turned out well for a grill recipe for flank steak. Use balsamic vinaigrette instead. I originally made it with the wine vinaiger and after tasting the marinade I added the balsamic. I did not have dijon mustard but I chose a horseradish mustard over a spicy brown mustard. It received many complements. Thank you.

Pretty good as written, but the second time I made it, I used low sodium soy sauce, 4 cloves of garlic, lime juice instead of lemon, half of an onion, diced, and balsamic vinegar in place of red wine vinegar. Loved this version!!

Cooked on an indoor electric grill, approx. 8 min per side. Even used bottled lemon juice and really old red wine vinegar. Gone in one dinner and one day of leftovers. Phenomenal! Marinade at least one night is the key.

I marinated the steak for a day and a half and it was tender and juicy. This one didn't have a lot of taste.

I use this marinade all the time.  It is really good on shoulder tenders that I get from Fareway.  One trick before putting them on the grill--dry them off after marinading overnight.  Otherwise they will steam and not grill.

Awesome recipe!  Definitely making this again and I am sure it will be even better the second time when I include all the ingredients.  I was feeling very lazy when preparing this so I omitted the minced garlic cloves and I also forgot to buy the lemon at the store.  Without the lemon and garlic it was amazing and so I can't wait to try it again with those two ingredients.  I marinaded it for 24 hours and then my husband grilled it for 8 minutes per side and it was incredible.  Served in corn tortillas with all the fixins and a side of steamed cauliflower and broccoli (trying to bring some healthy stuff to our table.)

Fantastic steak marinade.  I always add a little honey or agave to give it just a touch of sweetness.  Otherwise, it's perfect!

We really enjoyed this. I marinated for two days and used red wine instead of the vinegar because it was what I had on hand. I'm going to make e left overs into fajitas with peppers and onions. I will definitely be making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using Grey Poupon deli mustard instead of Dijon. I marinated it for about 10 hours and turned it every few hours. I broiled it in a gas bottom broiler about 4 inches from the heat source, 7 minutes each side and letting it rest for 15 min before slicing. The meat came out medium/medium-rare. I had a fairly thin cut of meat(on one side) so cooking time may vary. Once side of the meat was a little thinner so I served that right away as is, sliced against the grain. I saved the thicker portion for leftovers so it would allow for re-heating and not be over-done. I made quesadillas for lunch the next day. 
I liked the flavor, but it was a little mild on its own. (I tend to over-seaon though). It was better the next day because the mild flavor mixed well with the quesadilla ingredients. I think next time I will marinate longer and maybe just plan to make fajitas the first night. Definetly worth  try!

I thought this was pretty good. I had a london broil I used for the marinade. I pricked both sides with a meat tenderizing tool so the marinade would go through the meat. I followed the marinade recipe exactly just cutting the pepper in half for personal preference and I used low-sodium soy sauce. Instead of a grill I discarded the marinade and broiled it, elevated with a piece of foil, in a 13x9 pan. Once done I cut it very thin against the grain. It didn't have a dominant strong flavor, but the meat was tender which is what I desired.

Tis was so simple and easy!  I ended up marinating over night and broiling it in the oven for about 10 minutes on each side, due to inclement weather, but it was delicious all the same!  I was slightly leery of the dijon mustard, as it's not my favorite ingredient.  However, it really made the dish, and I might actually use a tad more next time!

This recipe received rave reviews from everyone who tried it.

I used balsamic vinegar rather than the red wine and used low sodium soy sauce and spicy mustard and let the steaks marinade for a total of 22 hours in plastic bags in the fridge and they were cooked so that the center was still pink (medium) and cut on a slant cross-grain after letting them rest about 10 minutes.

We'll definitely be using this recipe again the future and I'd love to try it on other cuts of steak as well.

I used this recipe for my first attempt at flank steak and it was fabulous!  My husband & I are not a big red meat eaters, but he went back for seconds, and my 5 year old daughter loved it as well.  I had to substitute olive oil for the regular vegetable oil, and some A-1 sauce for worcestershire, but it was great--I will make this again!

Tender and delicious! I ended up having my Flank Steak marinaded for 48 hours instead of the recommended overnight. It was scrumptous....so tender it reminded me of a great Filet. My suggestions are to remember to bring your meat out of the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before grilling. Also to get your grill nice and hot. Great recipe!

EXCELLENT! I didn't change a thing, except the marinade time (overnight). I also used a London Broil cut of meat. It cannot believe how much the marinade got into the meat.

The marinade is very good. I marinated a flank steak for about 30 hours and the flavor is wonderful.  I did use balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar.  My husband didn't want to mess with the grill tonight, so I baked it at 400 degrees to our desired doneness. I'm not crazy about the flank steak cut of meat, though, and plan to try a different cut, maybe a London broil next time.

This is my go to recipe for Flank steak, I always let it marinade over night. It has the best flavor and everyone in my family loves it. I don't change it at all, just as is, perfection.

This is an old recipe that has been around for years!  It is our favourite steak. the flank steak in Canada is very expensive but worth it.  I'm sure some old Alberta rancher was the first to do this.

It was OK, but there is a lot of acid in the ingredients. I balanced the acid with two tbsps of honey. It was much better.

I use a large zip-lock bag. Put all the marinade ingredients in. Lock bag and then mix up the ingredientx with my hand. Then I add the steak and pujch out all the air from the bag as I lock it. The steak gets marinated on both sides at once, and no dishes to wash!

Wow, this was so delicious! My husband started eating it while I was thinly slicing and when I was done he said he could eat the whole thing himself. I made it exactly as written. Used a 2.5 lb flank, I boiled for 8 minutes per side on a foiled sheet. It was so juicy. Can't wait to make poo-poos for the next gathering. This will be a huge hit! thank you :)

On paper, and based on all the good reviews, I had high hopes for this recipe.  I prepared it as prescribed, and unfortunately I was pretty disappointed.  I found the flavor much too strong-tasting of soy sauce and Worcestershire.  I felt it overpowered the beef flavor.

I was making fajitas so I substituted balsamic vinegar like others suggested. I put half of the mixture in a Ziplock with flank steak and the other half with chicken. I only had time to marinate for 3 hours. While the meat was grilling outside I sauteed peppers and onions in skillet on the stove with garlic powder, cumin, coriander, salt and soy sauce. When the meat was cooked to perfection, thanks to my husband, I let it rest on the cutting board to rest. I poured the juices that accumulated over the veggies and it was heavenly! Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome flavor!  This is my go-to recipe when we have guests to feed.  I sometimes use lime juice instead of lemon, and always start the marinade the night before.  Longer is definitely better.

This is the marinade that I use, except I use olive oil, and sometimes leave out the lemon juice.
It's the best marinade recipe I've found, and highly recommend it!

This was allright. Inspired by the fajita idea, my hubs grilled a 1 lb. cut of meat that we sliced and served with a mix of red / yellow bell peppers and sweet onion (FYI, I adjusted the marinade proportions accordingly). I must admit, chicken or shrimp fajitas if given a choice, but am willing to eat beef ones on occasion since my husband likes them so much (marriage = compromise lol!). It doesn't help that I prefer my beef medium well either.... Flank steak is a tough cut of meat to begin with. There is a fine line between perfectly cooked and overcooked flank steak and I think I crossed that line. :( Even so, I didn't get the WOW factor I was hoping for. My meat was only slightly seasoned and I marinated it for nearly 24 hours! The addition of cumin and / or fresh cilantro *might* have made a difference, but I didn't want to significantly alter this recipe before trying it as intended (I hate when people rate a recipe they've significantly changed). If for nothing else, I really enjoyed the veggies we grilled to accompany our fajitas. Mexican rice, chips, homemade guacamole and margaritas rounded out our meal. Maybe this will float your boat, but it didn't do much for us. Thanks anyways, GUYCON. :-)

If you are going to use Flank meat as a steak you need to ensure that you buy the best possible beef from a supplier that hangs the meat for a mimium of 4 weeks to help develop flavour and improve the texture of this fibrous cut of meat. I buy my meat from an award winning farm in salisbury, wiltshire called the traditional beef company www.traditional-beef.co.uk I would not recommend trying this recipe with meat just bought from a supermarket or cheap butcher as the meat will still be tough and chewy. Hope this helps

I also replaced the red wine vinegar with balsamic.  I added fresh grated ginger, fresh chopped cilantro & some brown sugar and marinated over night.  Turned out sensational for our fajitas.

Made one, froze one.  When I cook this, the kids excitedly say, "Ohhhh, are you making Asian food?!"  I am half-Asian so the kids know the smells of soy sauce and garlic.  I may just add ginger to this next time!! Family loves this recipe.

I moved from Houston, Texas to Boulder, Colorado and had a hankerin for some texmex style fajitas. I used this marinade on 2 lb of skirt steak overnight (12 hours). It turned out great! Made this for some friends that just got relocated up here and everyone raved about it. Definitely a favorite!

Not really crazy about this recipe. The marinade doesn't really absorb is 6-8 hours, should probably be left in overnight. Also, be careful not to overcook the meat as it will get tough quickly. You want it to be medium rare to medium at the most.

This marinade is great.  I served the flank steak as a steak salad with mixed greens, sweet peppers, onions and a little olive oil and sweet balsamic vinegar.  The family loved it.  We also decided we'll make again, but next time as fajitas.

Excellent. I didn't have red wine vinegar on hand, but using a good quality white wine vinegar worked well - it was delicious and my husband gobbled it up.

This has a super tangy flavor, and although this is by far not as authentic to use for fajita's being that I'm here in Southern Arizona, this recipe is still a great choice for parties, you can make it more spicy by adding habenero or cayenne into the mix.

Made as is, but oops, forgot the oil, so the garlic didn't really come through. Let it sit overnight in fridge. DH grilled it to med-rare and let it rest for 10 minutes, as we always do with flank steak to seal in the juices. Very tender and juicy. I'm docking 1 star because the predominant flavor was the soy sauce. I'll cut that in half next time. Leftover bits were gobbled from the cutting board during clean-up. That's a sure sign of a winning steak at my house! Thanks for the recipe.

This was probably the best steak marinade we have ever used.  We let the steak marinade for 24 hours and it was fantastic. Our kids, whom never like steak, even commented on how good it was ( no ketchup neessary).

This is just heaven! Perfect on it's own and great as leftovers on fajitas/tacos or a steak salad. Recipe is easily tweaked to taste. We marinated for several hours, 8 at least if I recall, and i was delicious!

Good marinate.  Reminds me of the taste of beef jerky.  Used tri-tip.  Probably needed 24 hour marinate.  8 hours was not enough.  Used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar.

I wanted so much to like this recipe!! It was very flavorful - but to me, tasted too much like egg salad. Will maybe try again, but use balsamic vinegar and  less Dijon. Or, might just stick to grilled meat with a chimichurri sauce.

Excellent recipe! I found it two weeks ago and this is the third time I'm using it today. This time I bought two thick boneless chuck steaks and cut into steak size pieces. The only change that I made is to add some natural cane sugar, because I like everything sweet! Amazing meat tenderizer and great flavor!

We enjoyed this immensely! Like other reviewers, we used it for fajitas--and I marinated sliced onions and red & yellow bell peppers right along with it. I sauteed the meat first and added the vegetables in for less than a minute. Yum!

The flavor was incredible. However, after i pitched my marinade, I broiled it in the oven for 8 mind on each side and it was tough!! I made a new batch of marinade, placed it back in a shallow pan with the marinade, sliced it into fajita strips, covered it with foil and cooked it for an hour. Then it was finally tender.

Wow.. I Loved this!  I didn't have Dijon mustard, so I used spicy brown... it was fantastic!   I put the remaining marinade in a pan full of cut up potatoes in the oven.  I'm so glad I made rolls too..  No juice left behind!  
I'm so thrilled to fix this for guests... I'm gonna be a star!  Thank you!

Great recipe, I added honey and changed the red wine vinegar with balsamic vinegar.  We found the red wine gave the meat too much of a vinegar taste.  I've made this several times and is always a winner at the dining table.

this is easily a great marinade.  There is only one thing I would change.  As another reviewer suggested, I would substitute balsamic vinegar for red wine vinegar.  Other than that, this was great.  Thank you so much for the amazing recipe.

It was really good-not amazing. I did get compliments on it, but I was hoping for more flavor since I marinated for over 24 hours. I used tri-tip instead of flank steak...texture was great not tough at all, like butter. We grilled it for about 30 minutes to 140F and it was medium rare.

I tried this recipe for dinner yesterday and it was great. I added 1 tablespoon of garlic powder, and extra tablespoon of dijon mustard, a dash of onion powder, 2 table spoons of black pepper and 2 teaspoons of A-1 Steak sauce. It was very tasty, the original recipe is good too, but I like a lot more flavor. I recommend that you make it as the recipe calls, then taste it and decide if you need anything else to satisfy your taste buds.

i followed this recipe to the T , with some advice from others to switch out the red wine vinegar for balsamic and added some cumin and coriander. it didn't taste good at all. the balsamic was overpowering. i'd omit that completely.

I had some year-old frozen steaks I wanted to use up, and figured they would need something to give them flavor. This marinade tasted wonderful!! I followed the recipe, except I substituted lime juice for the lemon (what I had on hand), and I also used the 1.5 Tb of cumin and coriander, since I was using the meat for fajitas. I marinated about 5 hours...Rave reviews all around! This is definitely my new steak fajita marinade!

What a super marinade!  Didn't have dijon so I used spicy brown mustard and all I had on hand was balsamic vinegar, but wow!  Even the 10 year old thought the flank steak was great.  And we only marinated for an hour.  Can't wait to see what it is like when we marinate the full six hours! Thanks for the super grilling night!

This is one great marinade. I did use ribeyes instead of flank and marinated in the refrigerator for about 30 hours.  I only had 1 T. of lemon juice so used 1 T. of lime juice as well. Outstanding, this is going right into the "Family Favorites" file.  Thanks, Guycon

This was so incredibly delicious!!  I substituted balsamic vinegar for red wine only because I was out of red wine, but I'd guess it be just as good the other way!

So good!  I used white wine vinegar, since that's what I had on hand.  I also added about 1/4 tsp cumin and coriander for fajitas, but it probably would have been good without it as well.  I used a meat tenderizer (the kind with lots of sharp blades) and marinated for 24 hours.  It was tender and soooo gooooood.

I use Kikkoman teriyaki sauce instead of soy, ketchup instead of mustard, and red wine instead of vinegar. I also add a couple of tbsp of sugar and no lemon juice. I usually buy the flank steak ahead of time and freeze it in the marinade--freezing draws the marinade in. Then just defrost when you're ready. A classic!

This was absolutely delicious! The only thing I changed was I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine and it turned out perfect!  I marinated mine for just over 24 hours and it was so tender and flavorful.  Will definitely make again!

I've made this many times with success everytime! I have found it it full of flavor in 2 hours of marinating if you get in a bind.  For fatijas I replace the lemon juice with lima juice and add a pinch of red pepper flakes for a subtle kick.

I thought this was going to be so good, but I was so wrong. I let it sit in my fridge for 24 hrs to get max effect but it just ended up tasting like vinegar. No one in my family could eat it. Sorry.

This was so incredibly tasty and MUCH better than a bottled teriaki sauce.  I fried my steak in a frying pan (on high, approx 5 mins each side) and put the marinade in the pan to cook with the steak.  Delicious!

This was awesome.  My husband absolutely LOVED it!!  I marinated it overnight and just grilled on the foreman grill.  I made some twice baked potatos for a side and it was a gourmet meal!!!  This would be great as a taco or fajita!!!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This was absolutley yummy!  I'm just disappointed that I didn't make more!!  I made fajitas.  I sliced 1/2 green, yellow, and red bell pepper and 1/2 an onion.  I used a fajita seasoning packet to season the vegtables.  Then I cooked them in vegtable oil until tender.  I served this with shredded cheese on warm flour tortillas.  So delicious!  Thanks for this recipe!

This was great.  I was looking for a good marinade to make yummy carne asada tacos with.  This is it.  I broiled the meat because I didn't want to mess with the grill, and it was fabulous.  We sliced very thin and squeezed fresh lime juice on before serving on warm tortillas with all the fixings.  Thanks!

It was unbelievably TENDER! Although I did not use the red wine vinegar, because I don’t drink nor use alcohol at all! I did replace it with a little balsamic vinegar with a little regular vinegar. But for a beginner, this is excellent! I would definitely recommend it!

This is a great versatile marinade. I used this on flank steak and chicken breast on the same night. It has a great flavor. I didn't have soy sauce so I used half Worcestershire sauce and half balsamic vinegar for the amount. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar. I added a 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning.

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using olive oil instead of vegetable oil, which we never use.  I marinated for at least 6 hours and then broiled for 4 minutes on each side.  Next time, I would broil a minute less on each side, depending on the thickness.  I thought this was very tasty and if marinated the night before, very easy for a weeknight supper.

This recipe is amazing! I did add 1 tbsp of brown sugar to help balance out the flavors and it was perfect. I also only had time to marinate for 2 hours. I then cooked it on the stovetop in my cast iron skillet, and used the marinade to baste regularly. Turned out tender and delicious. Definitely a new favorite!

The best marinade for steak!!!!  I have passed it on to friends that love it too.  We were wondering if anyone has tried with other meats.

Great on thin breakfast steaks with this on it and baked a half hour.  I used 1/2 of the amount of vinegar and used regular vinegar as didn't have red wine vinegar.

Pretty good and nothing unhealthy about the marinade.  I'd probably say the marinade I typically use with brown sugar has a bit more flavor--for that reason alone--but this definitely fits the bill when you're looking to cut sugar out as often as possible.  I broiled these in the oven, and probably at 8 min. per side.

I have never cooked flank steak before and decided to try my hand at fajitas.  This was perfect!  I did use balsamic vinegar as some of the other reviewers recommended and regular mustard as I didn't have any Dijon.  As I don't have a grill I cooked it for about 6 minutes on my George Foreman and it came out juicy and delish!

The steak will marinate easier if you have the butcher run it through a cubing machine twice.

I have been making this recipe for years from a Southern Living recipe. They add a white onion sliced to the marinade. Then grill the onions with the flank steak. Outstanding!

I have made this twice now and loved it both times.  Made it for Fajitas adding the cumin, cayenne pepper, cilantro and lime.  It was great.  Made it with flank steak and served with pasta - only sub was I still used lime juice and added cilantro.  Eating cold leftovers this morning.  This meat will be great on a salad also.

DEHYDRATE THIS!!!! And cook it as directed too! Ok, I've been using this marinade for a while but never posted a review because I reduced the amount of oil to 1/4c (followed the rest completely) from the get go (not fair to review if I didn't follow to a T) so anyways.... I put my steak in the marinade 3 days ago and this morning thought... I really should cook that (but I'm pregnant and the steak just didn't sound appealing to me today) so I wondered what I should do with it as freezing it was pretty much out of the question at this point. I dehydrated it! OMG!! I'm probably going to finish it all by myself before my husband gets home! (maybe i'll save him ONE piece)Because I did use oil in it, it came out a tad oily so I'll reduce it to 1T next time.

I think this marinade is best when used for fajitas, not served as a stand alone meat. We had it as is for dinner, then used the leftovers in fajitas.  Those were really good.  But I prefer the Barbequed Marinated Flank Steak recipe for flank steak served alone.  Great flavor though.

Great marinade.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did marinate it for 24 hours because that's just how it worked out for me.
Also, I like to set steak out at room temp for 1 hour before grilling.
Grilled at about 400 degrees 4 minutes on one side and 3 on the other for medium rare.  
Then let it rest about 10 minutes before thinly slicing against the grain on a slant.
Served with strawberry pecan salad and corn.
We loved the marinade and will certainly make it again.  
In response to some of the other reviews, this did not seem fajita-like at all to us. I wouldn't have even considered serving it as a fajita.

Delicious!!  I use this all of the time!  I use lime juice instead of lemon and I add a 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro.  Gives it more of a fajita flavor.  If I have tequila on hand I will toss a tablespoon of that into the marinade.

I followed the recipe exactly and marinated the steak for about 30 hours and the meat still wasn't that tender.  Also, the flavour wasn't as good as I was hoping for either.  Sorry.

Super easy, great flavor.  Only had the chance to marinate for 3 hours but came out tender and tasty.  Whole family loved it!

Perfect marinade for fajitas! I followed the recipe exactly except i swapped balsamic for the red wine vinegar (because that's all I had). Everybody loved this!

Excellent. I wouldn't change a thing. This was great to eat as is or would be excellent for fajitas as well. I scored the meat and marinated overnight. Really good. My husband loved it too.

Amazing! I used grapeseed oil and doubled the garlic.  I have been looking for a flank marinade for years and this is definitely the one.

This is a tasty marinade that my husband loved.  I used flat iron steak and marinated it eight hours.  Many times I'll cook down the marinade while the meat is grilling to serve as a possible salad dressing but I felt the flavor wasn't good enough as a dressing so I just pitched it.  Although there are a few marinades I prefer more than this one, it still was very good.

Loved this recipe.  Marinaded the steak overnight and it was fantastic.  On second try, I added some leftover red wine and that gave it a different taste, but still great!  Thanks!

I only use 1/8 cup of red wine vinegar because it is a little strong for my family's taste. Otherwise this is a great marinated we use very often.

Excellent marinade. The only change I made was to tenderize the steak with my Jaccard then a change of plans caused it to be marinated for 32 hours. I will be interested to do it again to see if the extra 24 hours had any effect.

This is a simple yet very delicious marinade.  We doubled this recipe to cover 6 pounds of flank steak & that was plenty.  Steak was very tender and received rave reviews from adults and children alike.  Will definitely make again!

I used balsamic vinegar and olive oil, but otherwise followed the directions as is.  I LOVED this marinade and we will be using it again.  The mustard just made it so good...the flavor was amazing.  I let my steak sit in the marinade overnight...really made a difference!

AMAZING!  This is one of the best recipes I've found on this site.  I have made it 7 times since I discovered it 2 months ago and keep getting requests to make it more often.  I've use red wine vinegar, balsamic, white balsamic, dijion mustard, stone ground mustard and even horseradish mustard....any which way it turns out great!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This tasted pretty good but I didn't think it was anything really special. I followed the recipe exactly. I used the meat as fajita meat and served with poblano pepper strips that I marinated along with the meat. I think it could use some crushed red pepper for some spice.

I made this for fajitas and realized that I just don't like fajitas after all.  It was a good recipe...though even after marinating for 2 days and only searing to medium/rare my meat was still tougher than I wished for.  The "tang" of the marinade was a bit too much for me, but the vegetables that I sauteed in the leftover browned bits from the searing of the meat were fabulous.

Awesome!  Super flavorful and extra easy.  Would be great on rolls as a sandwich.  Good without but even better with the ranch dressing.  Loved this!

Absolutely AMAZING recipe!  I've made this multiple times and it never disappoints.  As with most marinades, the longer it sits, the better.  Look no further -- this recipe will yield a tender and flavorful steak every time!   I can't wait to try this in fajitas.  Thanks so much for sharing Guycon :)

Everyone LOVES this marinade. I've been known to let it sit a full 24 hours...what a wonderful result! The oil can congeal a bit depending on how cold the fridge is, but don't let that scare you away!

Good flavor. A big hit - turned out better than expected. I did not use flank steak, but a high end sirloin round steak . My husband was convinced that it would be tough, but I sliced it real thin when it was still slightly frozen and marinated it in the fridge for 2 - 3 days prior to slow cooking. It was very tender. I used it for our fajita dinner for our son's rehearsal dinner. It was very tasty.

An excellent marinade.  I had my flank steak marinating for about 5 hours, and it was so flavorful.  I had to substitue honey mustard for the Dijon, but it was still very good.  A must try!

Fantastic! I love to cook steak, and have used and loved many recipes, and this one definitely stands out! What a great marinade for flank steak. It really brings out the earthy meaty flavor! My only regret was the I had to cut my marinade time down due to a busy schedule. The thick parts of the meat were not done marinating, so I will make sure to prepare further ahead of time next time. Definitely will add this to the make often folder!

This was a great recipe. This was my first time bbq flank steak. I left the flank steak to marinate overnight and cooked it to medium and it was perfect. Looking forward to making this again.

This was an excellent marinade.  I have to say though, I only let the meat marinade for maybe 20 minutes and it still permeated the meat with it's wondeful flavor.  Will definitely make again!

Add another to your long list of kudos.  We made a flank steak yesterday that was amazing.  I doubled the recipe exactly as written.  Now it is one I will turn to many times for summer grilling.

I didn't have the energy to adjust the marinade to our tastes like I normally do, and it's a good thing too! I made exactly as stated, and let the meat marinade for 36 hours before grilling. My oldest, who usually fusses over everything I make gobbled this up before anything else on his plate! That's enough for 5 stars!

This recipe is amazing. I needed a recipe for flank steak and when i came across this i couldnt believe how simple it was. I did do a couple things different. 1. I cooked it in the crockpot on high for 6 hours. The steak litteraly fell apart taking it out.  2. I did not have fresh garlic so i used 2tbs of garlic powder and added 1 tbs of onion powder. I was out of Dijon mustard so i used Honey mustard. And i did not use the fresh lemon juice because i was out.  This recipe will be a staple in our house. I will howver make sure i have everything on hand the next time and compare the tastes. Thanks so much for this recipe. GREAT.

More like 4 1/2 STARS.  My husband thought it was closer to 5 STARS.  He really enjoyed it!!  I was proud to hear him tell me how good it was over and over.  I marinated it for 24 hours, but it just didn't come out as tender as I thought it would.  Not too tough but not really tender, either.  If it had been a little more tender it would have been 5 stars.  Maybe marinating for 2 days would work?  The marinade was definitely AWESOME!!  I'd use it on any kind of steak.  Mmmmmm....

Wow. I never expected it to be so flavorful.  I recommend cooking to medium rare.  My husband cooked his half well and mine med-rare.  We both liked mine 1000% more.  The only change I made was using Hebrew National mustard instead of dijon.

I like flank steak but find it to be hard to grill as it can be tough. This is the perfect recipe. The marinade made the flank steak so moist.  Trick is to marinade it for six hours or more so it can set in.  I will keep this recipe for the future as it is well worth it!  Everyone in my family loved it and they are all very very fussy!  Thanks!

I marinated it for 6 hours.   I grilled some red onions and asparagus that I brushed with olive oil, fresh ground pepper, and sea salt.  My husband loved the steak with onion all in one bite.

This is very similar to 'The Best Marinade in Existence" on this site, between the two, you will never have to look for a steak (whatever cut) marinade recipe again! Delicious.

I had not cooked a flank steak for years...and this spawned my desire to do it again. I followed the recipe pretty close (adding liquid smoke to the marinade from habit). I also always use a foil pouch with dampened hickory chips to enhance the smoked flavor on the grill. I use a similar marinade for cooking deer or other game..the red wine vinegar acts as a tenderizer along with the lemon juice and removes most of the 'game' taste from meat. I like to use a vacuum seal bag to force the mixture into all of the meat if only in the marinade for several hours. Anyway the recipe is great. Leftovers made for many delicious lunch combos that week.

Used more lemon juice and white vinegar, bbq'd the steaks for 10 mins, and used excess marinade to cook veges (peppers, onions) - perfect!

This is a truly wonderful way to do Flank Steak.  I tried another recipe from this site recently and was very sorry that I had not used this one again. I decided I would not use another but this one.  It is perfect just as is.  I'd give it 6 stars.

It was very good I should have left the marinade on longer so next time I will try that.  It might have a little more kick I'll add some more seasoning to it as well.

I used skirt steak.  Didn't have balsamic, so I used rice wine vinegar.  I marinated for 24-36 hours.  The first time I used the broiler and it turned out great.  The second time my husband grilled it up and it was even better.  My 3 and 2 year olds couldn't get enough. They even ate it cold the next day.  Great recipe.

This is a fabulous recipe.  We have made this to the recipe and have followed some of the suggestions, such as using balsamic vinegar instead of red wine.  We try to let it marinade over night if we can; However, it is good even if it is marinaded the same day.  It is a can't go wrong recipe that can be changed as needed to accomodate your needs.  Thank you so much!  This has become a staple in our household.

I wasn't a huge fan of this.  Maybe it was my flank steak, but after over 24 hours in the marinade, my steak was incredibly tough (it was perfectly pink on the inside, so not overcooked...and I cut it in thin slices against the grain).  It could have been the steak, I don't know.  I wasn't entirely impressed with the flavor of this one either.  It was bordering on being bland.  I have used and had success with several other marinade recipes on this site, so I think I'll stick to using them!  Thanks, though!

I have never heard my husband rave about  fajitas until I marinated flank steak in this! IT would rival any good Mexican restaurant hands down. You have to try this but don't over cook it on the grill!! It's the only fajitas we will make now!!!

i added a tablespoon or so of brown sugar to help it carmelize.  everyone loves this!!! i poured it into a ziploc bag over skirt steak and sliced vidalia onion and marinated overnight.  i have also taken the whole bag with onion, steak and marinade, sealed without any air and frozen. as it defrosts it marinades. throw the onions in a foil pouch on the grill and after 30-40 minutes add the steak and you have a quick meal!

This was a good recipe, although I will marinate overnight for better flavor the next time I make it.  With flank steak it is important to cut it thinly across the grain.

My husband, and I made this just last night and it was easily the best marinade we've tasted!  We added 2 1/2 Tbs. of Dijon and waaay more Worcestershire sauce (4 or 5 Tbs.) than the recipe called for and it was phenomenal!  Adding A1 or any kind of steak sauce would have been a crime!  We'll definitely make this again and again...

The marinade tasted OK, I just don't care for the cut of meat.  Even sliced thinly against the grain, it was stringy and chewy. Very unappetizing piece of meat - don't make again.

This was very delicious. I didn't have dijon mustard or worcester sauce. I went without the worcester sauce and used brown mustard instead. I let it marinate all day and then I grilled it over charcoal. The edges got very caramelized and delicious! My husband enjoyed this recipe, so I will be making this one again.

This recipe was AMAZING! I added a few alterations though, I used OJ instead of lemon juice and grilled it over an open-flame grill, I also only marinated it for 2 hours. It was delicious. The picky eaters in my family ate every bite. This recipe is defiantly a keeper.

Not a bad marinade, but I think the future I will go for more of a spice rub. I needed a little more punch.

However, what I really liked is when I turned this marinade into a pan sauce. After pan searing the steak, I deglazed with the left over marinade. Added a little flour and brought to a boil (for safety and to thicken). Reduced the temperature, added some brown sugar (maybe a 1/4 cup) to sweeten it and served it as a dipping sauce for the steak. Had a great, rich flavor. Next time, I may skip the marinade part.

I substituted balsamic vinegar instead of the red vinegar. While I like the tangy flavor the vinegar gives the steak, I thought it was a bit overpowering. I'd reduce it the amount by 1/2 if you're not looking for something very tangy.

My honey looked up at me after the first bite & proclaimed "WOW Honey, this is REALLY GOOD!!!" - Best marinade I've come across.  I used it on some NY steaks (if it's not rib eye, it's gotta have some kind of marinade if you ask me) that we had in the freezer and man, truly awesome, delicious, wonderful, WOW steaks!  The only things I did differently were that I substituted olive oil, added a little more garlic than called for (I always do that) plus some white pepper.  This is a keeper!

Put my flank steak in the marinade and planned to cook a few hours later. At the last minute our plans changed and I did not get to cook the steak when I planned to. Was worried that I had ruined it, but coked it the next night anyway and it was delicious. Really moist, juicy, and flavorful!! Hubby raved and raved about this. Really good and super easy!

Great marinade for fajitas!  Only had time to marinate for 1 hour, but that was long enough to impart nice flavor - can't wait to try again with a longer marinating time and see if it makes a difference.

Left out dijon mustard, as DH does not like it and changed lemon juice to fresh lime juice - delicious!

Actually, tried two versions, one substituting with red wine to try earlier suggestion from reviewer.  The original has a perceivable "bite" or "tang" to it, so will use original recipe with red wine vinegar for fajitas going forward.

This was fantastic; the meat was juicy and tender, not always easy to achieve with this cut. Remember to slice flank steak across the grain, at an angle.

This is an absolutely wonderful marinade.  I had MUCH success with the finished recipe.  I followed the directions to a "T" with one exception...I always place my marinades in a big Ziploc zipper bag.  It really works great and easy clean-up.  Before this marinade I always bought a specialty pre-marinade skirted beef that was a little pricey.  The evening I made this I had my company taste test both marinades and this one won hands down.  I guess I will start marinading my own fajitas!

I followed this recipe to the letter--my husband & I just loved it!  The marinade is extremely easy to prepare & makes the steak super tasty.  I don't plan to change a single thing & your recipe will become a staple in our household.  Thanks for sharing this!

Absolutely outstanding recipe. I am from TX originally and have been hard pressed to find a good fajita recipe here in Kansas City. This recipe is better than any fajitas I have had in any restaurant.  We use sirloin steak with this instead of flank steak, and have impressed many a guest with this!

This was good, but, WAY too salty. I used olive oil, which was good. But, I let it marinate overnight, which I think was too long. Also, next time, I will use reduced-sodium soy sauce...but, there will be a "next time" b/c otherwise this was very good and had a lot of flavor! A dash of garlic powder and red pepper flakes add a nice touch!

Followed directions exactly and made fajitas.  Did not have long to marinade so I vacuumed sealed to cut the time and marinated for about two hours.  The taste really came through.  Family enjoyed.  Thanks

We had this for dinner last night, and when I asked if it deserved 5 stars, my 6 yr old daughter said it should get a hundred stars.  Enough said for me.  We did fajitas, and any recipe that gets the kids to try new things is great in my books!

This is a great marinade! We made fajitas with the flank steak, but the steak alone was great. I didn't have the dijon mustard on hand so I made it without, so next time I will try adding it to punch it up a little. Even without it it was delicious!

I only had about 3 hours to marinate this but it still came out great! Loved the flavor and easy ingredients. If you don't have time you could always inject it.

This was delicious!!  The only problem I had was that all the company ate all MY meat and I didn't have any left for the next day.  Seriously, I made twice what I needed and people would come back for seconds and thirds for just the meat.  We had these as fajitas.  Try it, you will like it.

This was great!  I only had a few hours to marinate, to I poked the steak liberally with a fork and put the steak and marinade together in a plastic bag.  An hour before dinner, I added some fajita veggies (onions, peppers, portobellos) to the plastic bag and let them marinate together.  I put the veggies on the grill first as they take longer and then cooked the steak for just about 2 minutes per side for rare.

I made this to use with chuck steak for fajitas, marinating (with bell peppers and onions) then grilling the meat and sauteing the veggies.  Delicious!! I substituted lime juice for the lemon juice to give it more of a Mexican flavor; if I make it for fajitas again I will add cumin for the same reason.  But it is fabulous just the way it is!

Delicious! I used olive oil instead of the veg. oil and marinated the flank steak for 24 hours. Grilled maybe 4 minutes per side and let it rest for 15 minutes. It was excellent...tender and juicy...cooked to perfection. Will use this recipe again soon!

Good taste.  We added our usual steak seasonings and used less soy sauce.  We grilled on a charcoal grill for about 5-6 minutes on each side which gave us tender and rare meat.

I'm not big on marinades for two reasons. First, I normally don't buy cuts that are 'difficult' and benefit from soaking. Two, I don't like sugar burning on my grill. But I wanted some experience with flank steak and what better way to try it out than with guests!! 

The recipe was awesome. The soy/Worcestershire balance was awesome and I let it soak overnight. We are condo dwellers now so I made it stove top. No worries at medium heat. It came to medium rare, thin sliced at the bias and we got rave reviews. It was the perfect recipe which went well with our bacon wrapped scallops and shrimp cocktail. Just the right turf to go with all that surf.

We served with a decent Trepeche Malbec but a late harvest semillon would have been awesome as well.

DELICIOUS !!  Made marinate exactly as in recipe.  Marinated 1 1/2 lbs of angus flank steak for at least 6 hours.  Grilled on our charcoal grill. Easily one of the very best, most flavorful, melt-in-your-mouth pieces of steak I've ever had!  Will absolutely use this marinate again.

It was a great marinade. I’d make it exactly as is with one addition. One I’ve used in other flank steak marinades: score the steak in a diamond pattern before marinating and it will be even more tender.

Whole family loved it. Proportions were perfect and the marinade added just the right amount of tang without overwhelming the natural flavor of the meat. Delicious. We'll do it again.

Made this for a Cinco de Mayo party where I did a fajita bar with this steak and another recipe for chicken. Everyone wanted this recipe and would not stop talking about the steak. I will be using it again and have shared it with all our friends. Highly recommended!

Great recipe!  However, after I made it , I tweaked it by adding 2 TBS white sugar and fresh ginger.  Superb.  I use it on flanken ribs (short ribs cut sideways) then we cook it on our Primo Smoker/Grill, which drains the fat and yields a tender piece of deliciously flavored meat!

This turned out great. I cut down the recipe to fit the piece of flank steak I had.  I also scored the steak on both sides. I only had time to marinate for 5 hours but it was very flavorful and tender.

Great recipe. Big hit with our family. I've made this more than a dozen times. One adjustment just because of what I usually have on hand: used balsamic in place of red wine vinegar.

Excellent recipe! I used only 1T of Worcestershire sauce and that was plenty. That was the only change made. The meat was so flavorful! 4 minutes per side made a perfect medium rare.

Oh my goodness, this is so good. I would not change a thing about this recipe just it is so tasty. I just made the marinade and tasted it. I am going to put the steak in my food saver container and seal up to get the marinade deep in the steak. Going to grill it tonight  with onions and mushrooms. With a side of Brown-Rice salad with spinach and tomatoes. I have the recipe for the salad if anyone wants it.  Thank you for this marinade.

this is such a fab recipe. I marinated it for 2 days. Hot hot grill and it cooks very fast, like 3-4 min per side.
Only minor change was 1/2 low sodium soy and 1/2 reg soy sauce.
Making it again and again and again. YUM !!!

Followed the recipe as written and it was excellent... no changes needed other than categorizing this under "Mexican"... there's nothing Mexican about it.

My husband's review was, and I quote, "Mmmmm, OH YAH!".

Until tonight I have never made a Flank Steak and I've been cooking for a very long time. I always thought it would be too tough to chew and just really didn't know how to make it so I totally discarded the notion. After tonight I will certainly make it again and again. I used this marinate and followed the recipe as written and it was pretty good. The flavor was good as was the instructions and I have now become a convert.

This was delicious!  The only change I made was I used apple cider vinegar.  In the future I would use either top round London Broil or Skirt Steak.  I felt the Flank Steak was not tender enough.  The flavor was great though.  Carmelites onions would have been a nice side.

This was fantastic! I've never cooked flank steak before, always opting for the more tender cuts, but this recipe has made a convert out of me!
I let it marinate overnight and it was crazy tender.
I accidentally had the grill a little too hot, so the cook was a little closer to medium than the mid-rare I was aiming for but that was my mistake not the recipe.
Next time, and there WILL be a next time (after we eat up all the leftovers), I will add some minced jalapeno peppers to the marinade to give it a bit of a kick, but I would make it again as is without hesitation.
We had it with potato puree and sauteed asparagus. I'm sure the leftovers will be just as big of a hit as steak tacos tomorrow night.
Thanks for sharing!

I had to use what I had on hand, which meant subbing in balsamic vinegar and regular mustard. I marinated a top round for a little over 24 hours, and cooked it on the grill. Hubby would have given it 10 stars, and my only addition for next time will be to season with a tiny bit of salt and pepper before cooking.  This will go in to our regular rotation!

Wasn't a fan of this recipe. Too vinegary.  I marinated for about 5 hours, perhaps that caused it?  I followed directions but used 1/2 tsp powdered garlic , used low sodium soy sauce,added cumin and little cayenne pepper since we had these a fajitas.  Very disappointing.

This was a pretty good recipe but I think there is too much vinegar.  Next time I would cut down on the vinegar, add some red chili flakes and keep everything else the same. I only marinated for about an hour but it still had good flavor and sat very well and heated up great the next day! Served with some grilled asparagus!

This was an awesome recipe! the flavor was so yummy! I actually used a London Broil  and substituted the red wine vinegar for  rice vinegar (because my red wine vinegar was expired) and only had time for it to marinade for 2 hours. It was delicious! I've added it to my recipe file so that I can use this recipe again!!

Added 2 oz of Jack Daniels Whiskey and add more pepper. This is our go to recipe when making fajitas and it comes out great! 
I go to costco for the meat. When I get it home, I fill a bag with marinade and stick in the freezer. Easy peasy when fajita day rolls around.

Delicious. I marinaded it for 6 hours and had to substitute red wine vinegar with pomegranate vinegar.

I didn't have Worcestershire sauce either, but I'm very happy with the results without it.

I broiled it for about 5 minutes.

Other than those small changes I made it exactly as instructed.

This marinade is amazing for fajitas!  I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine and I added a tsp of Cumin.   Will make it again for sure!

I've never made a flank steak before tonight... turned out very yummy and will definitely make it again!  Left-overs will be great in fajitas.

I use this recipe for chicken marinade regularly. It is delicious. The only changes I make are substituting olive oil and balsamic vinegar for the vinegar and oil called for in the original recipe. This is a keeper.

This is one of the first recipes I saved to my favorites back in 2013. Since I've saved it, I've made this recipe about 15 times and is always a huge success when hosting dinner parties or even with my family. I love that there is a video now too!! I love this recipe so much, I make it exactly how it's instructed.

The marinade recipe is absolutely perfect, though I have found it needs to go for a full 24 hours to really mellow everything out. Don't worry about it getting too salty - it won't.

I've used this marinade many times and love it. I sometimes change things up a bit. Today I added fresh oregano and rosemary to the marinade as it's in abundance in our little garden.

Update 9/17 - I've made this many times now and have begun adding 1/2 T each of coriander and cumin.  Really makes them into fajitas.  Extremely good.  Best if you have time to marinate overnight. 

Also - if making in the broiler, I recommend slicing prior to marinade.

Marinated about 8 hours.  Totally screwed up the cooking since the grill wasn't hot enough and had to finish cooking in the oven on broil.  Even with these mistakes, still was extremely good.

We make this at least twice a month. It is versatile and can be served many different ways. We often use it in tacos or for Thai beef salad or with mashed potatoes.

Wow,
This is good! The preparation time was quick...and I am a distracted mom of two babies. I let this marinate for 6 hours. I didn't want to run the grill so I just broiled the steak (uncut) 7-10 mins each side and let it rest for 10 minutes after. The flavor really made this dish! This one is a keeper!

This was pretty nice. I used canola oil, and since I had a very large flank steak, I cut off 3 steaks that added up to just under the listed 1 1/2 pounds. Besides that, I did everything exactly as written. I used a countertop grill, and grilling seems to take longer on it - at least 15, maybe 20 minutes until the steaks were done enough for me. I haven't marinated very many meats, and I've only had flank steak a couple of times, but this worked well. I'd tended to be disappointed with weakly-marinated dishes, but this had a fairly strong flavor. I can't say that I could discern all the components, but I liked it overall. Even just marinated for 6 hours, the first steak was nice; I left the other two steaks marinating for the next two nights, and they were just a little bit better. Not an awesome recipe, but worth recommending.

This is almost the exact recipe included with my Weber grill 20 years ago.  the only difference is Dijon mustard instead of dry mustard.  It is my favorite marinade for steak.

This was one of the best marinades I've tried!  I used it on London broil and it was perfect.  I had two steaks--one marinated for approx 8 hrs and the other for 24 hrs.  They were both great, but the 24 hour one was definitely more flavorful.  I'll definitely use this recipe again!

The marinade was way to salty.  I should have used a low sodium soy and maybe it would have tasted better.  Very disappointed.

I like spicy so I added the cumin and corriander like suggested in one of the reviews and also added red pepper flakes. The longer is marinated the better!

Wow! What a disappointment!! I had planned to grill the flank steak when my son and daughter-in-law came for the weekend. They ended up postponing their visit, so I made a practice run in order to use the steak. I'm sooo thankful I found out this is inedible before serving it to them. Not only was the steak tough, but it tasted so vinegary that I went back and checked the recipe to be sure I'd not added too much. I had followed the recipe exactly as written, but, even after trying to "fix" it the next day in a crock pot with a packet of slow cooker beef seasoning, I still could not eat it.

It was good, but a little salty for my taste.  That is probably going to happen any time you use that much soy sauce.  But the family all agreed the steak was good.

Great recipe.  I do a few things.  
- Add a bunch of green onions chopped to marinade.
- For spicy flavor, I add two Jalapenos diced.
- I also make a Avocado, Red Onion and Mango mixture (with Lemon, Cilantro, Kosher Salt and Ground Pepper) to top the steak with.  Delectable!!!

I've  used this recipe on both flank steak and skirt steak and it's a crowd pleaser every time.  This is one of my go-to recipes when grilling for a group. These cuts of meat are easy to cook on the grill - be sure to let them rest for 10 minutes to cook through - and the flavor of the marinade is wonderful.  There are rarely any leftovers because everyone just keeps eating, and you'll never get tired of hearing the compliments!

Amazing, I made this Friday night with flat iron steak for fajitas and it was melt in your mouth. Definite keeper! I did change one thing, I used aged balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. Oh and I used lime juice instead of lemon. Grilled 9 minutes per side, tented it with aluminum foil after it rested for about 5-8 minutes and carved thin and it was just fantastic. I would recommend this, try it once and see for yourself.

I have grilled a lot of marinated flank steaks. This recipe peaked my interest because it had additional ingredients I had not used together.  So I made it to see if I was missing out on something.  Sadly, the flavor did not compare to a simpler version I use that gets raves time and time again.  I think there are just too many things going on that dilute the savory of this marinade.

I used this recipe to marinate the beef for fajitas and it was just fantastic! Everyone raved!  I left the meat in the marinade for about 24 hours - I think the longer the better.

We have made this twice now.  The first time, we didn't have a ton of time to let it marinate and the second time it marinated overnight.  Of course, the second time was much better, but really, both times left us with a really flavorful dinner.  It is too cold to get out the grill here, so we broiled it instead- still wonderful.  This will be in our regular dinner rotation.

This turned out wonderfully. I ended up marinating the meat for 28 hours by accident but it just made it all that much better. The only problem was doubling the recipe wasn't enough for my family.

I changed the recipe a little to fit a no-sugar detox that I am currently on. I left out the Worcestershire sauce, used about a tablespoon (or a little less) of ground garlic instead of minced and added a little bit of balsamic vinegar. It was delicious!

This was delicious! This was the first time I ever cooked flank steak, and it couldn't have been easier. I followed the recipe, except I used balsamic vinegar instead of red vinegar. The meat was tender and very flavorful. I served it at a dinner party, and everyone loved it. Grilling it was easy, about 8 minutes a side for medium rare. I prefer it a little more done, so next time I will probably cook it a few more minutes. I also used the same ingredients to marinate veggies to grill, and they turned out great, also! Served it with rice pilaf and a salad. Meal was great! Will definitely make again! Thanks for recipe. Also, I marinated it overnight, since I didn't have time today.

Used this marinade on T bone steaks. Marinated for 24 hrs in a ziplock bag.   Used cider vinegar instead of red vinegar, only 1/4 cup of canola oil and no lemon juice. Before broiling in oven I sprinkled both sides with kosher salt.  Broiled 4 min on each side, perfect for medium. A definite keeper.  Thanks Guycon for sharing.

We had a 1 1/2 lb flank steak..and marinated it for 24 hrs.  The only change I made was I added I T. Brown sugar(I may add2next time) and there will ne a next time as we really like the recipe.  Grilled it 7 min per side on med hot grill..then let it rest 10min or so.  Added beef broth to the marinade and reduced and thickened for gravy...good also.  Although it is a great dish..I personally do not taste "fajitas" in this marinade without significant alterations.

I don't know wat makes this marinade so much tastier than other, similar recipes, but it absolutely IS!! It's the only one I ever use now. Sometimes I will sub red wine AND vinegar for the red wine vinegar, but otherwise no changes. It's perfect. Try it with a cheap skirt steak, marinate overnight, and grill just a few minutes each side before slicing against the grain. Delicious!!

I was unable to find any flank steak and used flat iron steak instead.  The meat had the best flavor but was also the most tender steak I have ever served.  I sliced it thin just like the flank steak but my guest were able to cut with just a fork.  My guest were asking for the recipe after the party

This recipe was great!  The only changes - I only marinated for 4 hours and I cooked in the oven on broil!  I really can't imagine it being any better but I will try to marinate longer next time and cook on the grill!

I can see using this as a go-to marinade for grilled steaks.

Oh my gosh!! This was amazing!! In my husband's words, "You hit this one out of the park, babe!" I followed the recipe to the T, except I substituted Braggs Liquid Aminos for the soy sauce to make it gluten free. I only marinated for a couple of hours and kept back some of the marinade to make a sauce at the end. In making the sauce, I added the marinade left in the bag from the meat to the marinade I kept out and brought the liquid to a boil, adding, maybe, a 1/2 Tbs. of cornstarch to thicken. It was good as is but a little strong. Probably will cut the sauce with a little beef stock next time. Definitely a keeper!!!

Made this recipe for our campfire snacks late at night.  It was a huge hit.  Cut flank steak into chunks and marinated for 2 days and then I skewered them when we were going to eat them.  I will make this again!

Too much soy sauce, too salty for me, reduced by half. Soy sauce is strong. Other than that it's excellent. I left it over night and the meat was super tender and flavorful.

I have finally found a marinade that even my husband likes (actually we both love it).  I did not have flank steak so I used it on a tri tip roast and let it marinate for 8 hours.  Seared it on the grill at high heat on both sides, then lowered the flame and cooked for 30 minutes as it was a very thick roast.  I basted frequently throughout the whole cooking time.  I threaded red and green bell peppers and chunks of onions on skewers and basted/cooked them alongside the meat.  I wrapped the meat in foil when I brought it in and set it in a pre-warmed oven to stay hot while I made a rice pilaf using some of the peppers and onions in the rice for extra flavor.  It was a delicious shish ka bob without the stick.  Although the meat was rare, it was tender, juicy and flavorful.  I used cilantro and parsley in place of coriander as I did not have that on hand and I threw in a small amount of basil as another reviewer had suggested. Also used the balsamic vinegar in place of red wine vinegar (again it was what I had on hand)....excellent and will use this recipe over and over and have already shared it with 4 other family members.!

This was amazing!  One of the best steaks I have ever had.  The store didn't have flank so I got a sirloin.  My family raved about it also.  Will definitely use this one again soon.

I marinated this for about 4 hours and the meat came out very flavorful!!!  I did make one change, I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar.  I can't wait to make this again.

My new go-to marinade for fajita meat, we squeezed some lime juice over the top to marinate. It was so flavorful, we want to try it again and marinate overnight.

I did not love this, but maybe flank steak is not my thing. I followed the recipe as written except I let this marinate for 24 hours. It was edible and it wasn't bad, it just was not great.

Thumbs Up. My husband is super picky about his marinades and rubs and he liked this one, so it's a winner in our house. I didn't have fresh lemon or prepared mustard so I just used lemon pepper leaving the plain pepper out and used about a half tsp of dry powdered mustard.

Easy recipe! I added 1 t. crushed red peppers to add a little spicy kick that we like. I marinated this over night, and served with sauteed onions...the flavor was great. It also made for great leftover Philly Sammy's the next day!

Not bad it just didn't "wow" me. Marinated for about 7 hours or so and broiled for 6 minutes on each side...was a perfect medium.  The meat was tender just not as flavorful as I had hope.  If I use this recipe again, I may marinade for 24 hours to see if that helps.

I used this recipe as is with exception of using light soy. It had great flavor and matched with orzo with sauteed onion and pepper and ripe olives.

Per other reviews I used balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar and I used about four cloves of garlic.  I marinated it for 2.5 days and it was delicious.

GLORIOUS!! my only complaint is that I didn't double this recipe!! I used it for fajitas. Cooked it in a skillet with the marinade. So tender!! I can't stop thinking about it! Tonight I am omitting the oil and trying it in beef stew.

This was good, I also changed a few things.  Instead of red wine vinegar I used balsamic vinegar, my husband thought there was too much vinegar taste to it.  I also baked it at 375 degrees for about 35-40 minutes(we like are meat med rare) it turned out perfect.

Reallllly good and + versatile ! Used this recipe for fajitas with sauteed onions + bell peppers and it was so delicious. Also great with on top of rice !  Let it marinade for at least 24 hours if you can. Makes a world of a difference.

This was the first time I have ever made flank steak or even bought it! The recipe was very good, although I did broil it in the oven for 10 minutes with the gravy. NExt time, I would probably remove some of the gravy before cooking. I used regular mustard instead of dijon.

This has been my go-to marinade for a while now.  Everyone who tries it loves it.  I use it not only for flank steak, but also for chicken and pork.  It's amazing with pork chops on the grill topped with a grilled pineapple salsa!

I added 1T each Corriander and Cummin as suggested by another reviewer as I was using it for Fajitas. Marinated 24hrs. Broiled in oven for 7mins per side (medium). Somehow the marinade tasted better than the flavour it gave the meat itself. Overall was pretty good but I might try it with less vinegar next time.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but for some reason my steak didn't turn out nearly as flavorful as I had hoped even though I marinated it overnight.  I've had more luck with a different flank steak recipe that contains more soy sauce.  Maybe I'll marinate for 48 hrs next time!

THIS WAS FANTASTIC! I marinated it for about 10 hours or so and it came out delicious.. my flank steak was a little on the thick side so I grilled it 6 minutes on each side over med-high heat. It came out medium on the edges and medium rare towards the middle. The marinade was great! Will probably try it with turkey breast, chicken, pork loin, and much other ! Thanks for sharing it was wonderful!

This is the 2nd time using this recipe in the last month.  Very good!

6/2010-back to say this is the only marinade I use.  I don't change a thing.  I seem to always get asked for the recipe.   Very good!

7/11 Again--I can't believe the requests I get for this marinade.  I also use it on chicken-it's great!

This is a great marinade... super quick to prepare and lots of flavor. I've made it a couple of times. It is best when the steak marinates for a long period of time (24 hrs).

This was outstanding (enough to cause me to join allrecipes.com so I could post this review).  I substituted lime juice for lemon juice but otherwise followed the recipe.  I was skeptical of the ingredients but intrigued by the rave reviews.  I was surprised by the depth of flavor.  My husband agrees with the 5 star rating.  A definite keeper!

This was yummy. I thoght I had worcestershire but once I got started I realized I was out. So I substitued A1 sauce since that was all I had. We used an electric marinader which infused this into the meat perfectly and grilled it over charcoal. I can tell that this would be good for any steak, not just flank. Give it a try!

We used this marinade for a London Broil (on sale cheap!!), marinated for 24 hours, grilled and sliced thin.  Very tasty!

The fajitas I made with this recipe far surpassed anything I could have eaten at a restaurant! I put sliced onions in the marinade, which I cooked in a pan on the stove while the flank steak was on the grill. I marinated for 24 hours in the refrigerator. I served the fajitas with sour cream, avocado slices, homemade salsa and the onions from the marinade. I also made borracho beans.

So very delicious! We added 1/2 sliced yellow onion to the marinade and let it marinate overnight.  The onions were placed in foil and grilled along side the flank.  Zero leftovers.  Next time I'll add more onions, they too were awesome.  Definately a do-over in my house.  No adjustments necessary.

i really liked this---i made it specifically to use for fajitas, but i got sidelined and it ended up in the marinade in the fridge for 5 days!  we grilled it last night and it was extremely moist, tender, and juicy (except the end bits that my husband, the grill-master, burnt)...i had stomach surgery 3 months ago and am not supposed to eat tough meats, but i had no problem whatsoever with this, and the flavour was lovely...next time i make it, i'll forget about it again and leave it to marinate for 5 days!!

I marinated this for 9 hours and although it was tasty, the meat was not as tender as I thought and hoped it would be. Maybe it was just the piece of meat? I grilled some veggies and we made fajitas. Another reviewer said the meat was so tender it could be cut with a fork...that would be my dream :) Anyway, it's flavorful, so I'm giving it 4 stars :)

It might not be fair to rate this because I used it on a top sirloin and only marinated for three hours...however, my steak was not at all flavorful nor tender so I will probably search for another marinade.

I thought the marinade was excellent. I marinated a flank steak for six hours, and it came out very tender, flavorful and delicious once it was grilled. I made one change as I wanted to use lime juice versus the lemon. Thanks for the great recipe.

FABULOUS!!!! This is just what I was after for a flank steak marinade! I did not want something "Ethnic", meaning, no Southwest or Asaian influance. All I was wanting was a superb balance of flavor that would contrast the meat well but not block out the meat flavor. Very well done!!!!!!!!!!!

This was great! I usually use a half bottle of italian dressing to marinate flank steak for about 3 days and serve it on garlic bread but I think I will start using this delicious marinade and save some money.

This marinade is AWESOME if you have the time. I put the steaks in the marinade in the morning before going to work so they ended up marinating for like 8 hours. And my husband ended up over cooking them, so they were tough, but still amazingly tasty.  I did cut the oil in half to cut back on fat, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. I'm keeping this recipe indefinitely.  I've also made fajitas with this steak and they were AWESOME!

holy jeezers was this good.  only change i made to the recipe was cutting back the oil to about 1/3 cup of olive oil.  i marinated it in the fridge for 30 hours and then stuck it under the broiler for 5 minutes per side - resulting in a medium rare finish.  amazing.

This recipe came out perfectly.  I only marinaded it for three hours, and it was still really flavorful.  The only thing I changed was use balsamic vinaigrette instead of red wine vinegar although I don't think it'll matter either way.  My husband loved it!

Great marinade!  I used low sodium soy sauce and added 1 tablespoon of good quality honey.  I poked holes in the flank steak and left to marinade for about 15 hours.  I made it after dinner adn then cooked it the next day for lunch.  I sprinkled some kosher salt on the steak before broiling.  I cooked to about medium and slice very thin.  I had it on top of a salad with homemade ranch dressing.  My son had it with mashed potatoes.  YUM! thanks for sharing.

This flank steak was excellent.  I would possibly add just a little less mustard next time as I did taste it and my husband says you should never taste any ingredeient over another, so just a bit less would be great.  It was very tender, and tasty.  I marinated in zip lock bag all day while I was at work and it took just minutes to grill. (We like it medium rare)  Thanks for the recipe.

Didn't come out very flavorful & the meat wasn't that tender. Will try again, spearing the meat with a fork. We used this meat for fajitas.

This recipe made for some excellent fajitas.  I did everything according to the recipe and just added a little cumin.  My flank steak marinated for 24 hours and was tender, moist & flavorful.  Delicious!

This was excellent. The flavor of the steak was delicious! Very easy to make. I only used half of the marinade. We toped the steak with sauteed mushrooms. It would be a great dish for company.  DH said it was better than any restaurant.

Very Good!

I used this recipe to make fajitas and they turned out great!

All I did different was skip on the mustard (can't stand it, no matter how little I use in recipes I can always taste it) and added a tablespoon of onion powder.

Great recipe!

AWESOME MARINADE! I DID NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES EXCEPT AT THE END. I PUT THE REMAINING MARINADE IN A SAUCE PAN AND HEAT IT UNTIL IT'S BUBBLING. AFTER I PLATE THE MEAT I DRIZZLE THE MARINADE OVER IT. ALSO, I THOUGHT THE MEAT WAS ALITTLE ON THE RARE SIDE, I USUALLY PREFER  MEDUIM-RARE. SO I WOULD SUGGEST 6-7 MINUTES ON EACH SIDE. I WILL DEFINITELY MAKE THIS AGAIN. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!

Five stars for the marinade!  It was so flavorful and juicy!!!!!  As far as the steak itself, I'd probably give it three stars because it was not as tender as I expected; especially since I marinated it for over 6 hours.  Maybe it was just a poor choice in the flank that I selected?  The flavor definitely made up for its toughness though.  I will definitely make this again but with a more tender cut of meat.

I happened to use skirt steak and did marinade overnight. I realized in the morning I forgot the soy sauce, threw it in but it didn't seem to make this any less tasty. I did change the red wine vinegar to 1/4 each of red wine and balsamic vinegar. Otherwise did everything else per recipe. Oh, wait, I did throw dehydrated onion in the marinade but not sure if that made any difference. My skirt steak was rather thin so only grilled (outdoor) 3 min (high heat) per side. Was very delicious and tender. Remember to cut across the grain, not with it. Will use this recipe again, is something you can tweak if you want. Thanks for the post!

YUM!! As the other reviews said, this is really good. I too used balsamic vinegar as suggested in a review and think it would have been just as good with the red wine vinegar. Either way, this is a keeper. "Flank" steak was not available at the time, butcher suggested top sirloin. Marinated about 24 hours, it was great, very tender, cut with fork. Will definately keep this recipe and make again!

I never write reviews but this was by far the best marinade I have ever had on flank steak.  I didn't change anything and the steak turned out perfect..tasty and tender.    This is a definite keeper for my family.

WOW!!! We made this marinade yesterday, I used a sirlion tip steak because I couldn't get flank steak.  We Love love love this...the best marinade we've ever had.  We had friends over for dinner and I made extra steak to have some leftover for lunch today, well....not a piece was left...even their picky eater had thirds.  So my hubby ran to the store for more steak and we are having it again today.
Thanks for a great one

This ought to be in everyone's recipe book.  The first time we tried it, the marinade was used on steak tails instead of flank steak.  The steak spent half a day marinading and a few minutes on the BBQ.  They were then sliced up and used for fajitas.  Everyone loved them!  We've used this recipe a few times since then, sometimes adding some fajita or taco seasoning, or replacing lemon with lime, to tune the taste for a particular dish.  The results are always good.  Best of all, the marinade is easy enough that a cooking klutz like me can make it in a few minutes.  Highly recommended if you're tired of store-bought BBQ sauces and want something different - and better.

I decided to make fajitas and used this recipe for the marinade. I did let it marinade for 5 hrs. Good but not outstanding. I also made the whole wheat flour tortillas from this site. Made for a nice combination. Will use this marinade again with a little tweaking next time.

Oh man, this is so good.  I added a tbs. of honey to it for some reason.  I thought it called for it but it didn't.  I let it marinate for 24 hours and then brought it with us for camping and it was a hit.  Now when we go camping it is always something I make at home and then have the first night of camping.   I made it as fajitas and sauteed some onions and bell pepper.

I followed the recipe except I used london broil. My family and I weren't crazy about this marinade. We're not used to our steaks tasting "tangy". I did tenderize the meat very well though.

This was perfect!  My kids usually complain about beef being too hard to chew....they asked for 2nds and 3rds on this.  It was pink in the middle like I like, but cooked thru on the ends like they like.  Our leftovers are going in tortillas tonight!

This recipe was fabulous!! I actually made it for my 2 sirloin steaks, and I have never used my own marinade before!! I basically followed the recipe exactly except I also used McCormick's Grill Mates steak seasoning along with everything else. I marinated my steaks for about 48 hours in a ziploc bag and then pan seared them for about 3 mins on each side, then threw them in the broiler for abut 2 mins.
Yummmmy! I will use this again and again!

this was very good! i used this marinade with very thin cut flank steak. i put it in the food saver canister to speed marinade it, i left it in there for 30 min and it was perfect. i didnt have any lemon, but it didnt really matter. i used it for fajitas so i also added a packet of fajita seasoning, some hot sauce, and some red pepper flakes. i will also use this marinade for steaks on the grill. thanks!!

Yum! I only made one adjustment...adding a bit of fajita seasoning in place of the pepper...it was very delish and the whole family enjoyed it.  I left the steak overnight and the flavor was great...will be using this all summer!

Great marinate, and like someone already said, don't need to marinate 24 hrs.

This was the best marinade.  By chance,  I happened to let it sit overnight and the flavors were intense through the whole steak.

This recipe made the most fantastic fajitas!  I used my vacuum food sealer to marinade the meat, which enhanced the flavor, then served it with sauteed onions and peppers, and pineapple salsa.  Wonderful!  We want to try the marinade with chicken next time!

Pretty good marinade.  It smelled wonderfully and I was very excited to taste the steak after grilling...but it seemed lacking in some flavor.  We made fajitas out of the steak and the saving grace, I thought, was the flavor from the peppers and onions.  My husband said it was good but I thought it could have been more flavorful.  This isn't quite what I was looking for but we were not disappointed with our meal.  It was good.  Thanks!

I scaled this to 1 lb. of meat. For some reason (due to our inability to grill anything correctly, I think), I couldn't taste the marinade much at all on my steak, but my husband said that his was delicious and that we should definitely use the marinade again. The only thing I changed was using canola oil instead of vegetable, and I know we'll give it another try.

EXCELLENT! This added so much flavor to the steak and also helped to keep it moist while cooking. I added half a diced onion and 1/3 cup ketchup. My kids didn't even reach for the ketchup bottle at the table! WOW. Thank you :-)

This was very nice!  The only thing I did different was crush the garlic and marinated it for 4.5 hours.  
My 3 year old loved it and it is hard to get her to eat dinner these days!

this was excellent, i didnt have the exact ingrediants, and kinda had to be a little creative, but the marinade came out great even with my tinkering, so I know the actual recipie must be good :) tasted very much like restaurant fajitas, next time I might add some kind of spice, like chili or cayenne just to give it a tad more kick

Just got done making this to send with my husband for his lunch.  I am so disappointed that I did not make enough for me as well.  This is excellent!!!  A must try.  Would not change a thing.  Except maybe marinate in a plastic bag.  Did not have enough time yesterday to cook, so it did marinate overnight.  Excellent.  Thank you for the recipe Connie.

Oh my! This was such a great recipe! I used it to marinate Flap Meat, very thin and flat pieces of meat. I doubled the recipe to marinate 2 lbs of meat, seperated into zip lock freezer bags and froze one.  Thawed 3 weeks later, it was just as good as the one I cooked that night!  GREAT! THANKS!

We didn't like this at all. Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but the meat was tough. At 6.99/lb, I didn't expect it to be.

Great recipe, my whole family enjoyed it. I needed to make a marinade without going to the store, and this recipe allowed me to use ingrediants from the pantry. I didnt have the six hours, so I pricked the steak with a fork before marinading and it turned out wonderful after only 3 hours of marinading

One of the best I have tried for steak, and also used for fajitas. The red wine vinegar gives a nice zesty flavor. I will recommend it and use it again.

I used this marinade on London Broil, and it was fantastic.  I let the steak marinated for 24 hours, then we grilled it outside until medium rare.  My niece literally left with my copy of the recipe, that's how good it was.  Time to print out a new copy for my recipe book!

Fabulous! I used granulated garlic instead of the regular garlic, just 'cause that's what I had, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe. My son ate almost a pound of this all by himself and said that steak sauce would have been "an insult"

This marinade was excellent.  Wanted to make fajitas last night, only had an hour to marinate and the chicken tenderlions and skirt steak were both very flavorful.  Used low carb fajita wraps, red bell pepper, yellow onion and light sour cream for a taste sensation.  Thanks for the recipe, will make again very soon.

Excellent!  The only complaint I had was that it was a bit salty - I had seasoned the meat before marinating which might have caused that.  Won't do that the next time.

I used this marinade for a roast on the BBQ.  I marinated it overnight.   It was delicious.   My husband and son loved it too.  Will definitely make again.

I used this on a cheaper blade chuck steak and they were delicious. Not ultra-tender but so full of flavor that you don't notice alittle toughness.

We enjoyed this very much.  I marinated the steak for a day and a half, and it came out very tender and moist, and smelled wonderful when it was cooking.  It also tasted great cold the next day.

Something when wrong with my meat( I even marinated the meat overnight), because it was not soft enough to eat. Or maybe it was that I cooked it on the broiler like someone else did on the reviews. Anyway the marinated sauce was GREAT!!! it has a wonderful small while cooking. I for sure will do it again but will try to use another cut of meat like fajitas and of course in the grill!!!

I added twice the garlic and marinated overnight.  The whole neighborhood was leaning over the fence while I cooked it - I made 5 lbs of Flank steak for 4 people thinking I'd have leftovers for the next day - it was gone in 20 minutes.  The best ever!

This is a very good recipe. I have used a recipe very similar to this one for years on chicken and pork (especially boston butts) and everyone loves it. I never thought about marinating steak with it. I can't wait to try it.

Wife and kid's LOVED it--I think if you can find a piece of steak that is all the same thickness it would be easier to cook.  Over all it was a great griller.  Strongly reccommend this 1!

This recipe was great.  I added 3 serrano chilis and baby bella mushrooms that I had leftover from the night before. The vinegar cut the heat from the chilis. I then put it in the oven for about 25 minutes with the marinade until the meat reached about 140 degrees.  I used the cooked marinade and juices as a gravy for potatoes.  great recipe.  it didn't need my alterations,  but I had leftover ingredients to use up,  so why not.

This is an impressive marinade.  I, too, used it with flank steak for fajitas.  My family devoured it and requested that I only use this marinade in the future.  I didn’t have fresh lemons so I used bottles lemon juice, which was fine.  Thanks for sharing!

Perfect just the way it is!  No need to modify this recipe. (although, I did use olive oil instead of Vegetable).  I marinaded it for 4 hours.  A couple more hours wouldn't hurt.

Make sure grill is nice and hot to sear the juices and carmelize the marinade. So yummy with steamed veggies and couscous.

This recipe was a winner for me. I used skirt steak from a local farm and not only was it so tender( cut on the bias), but the flavor was so good, I'm making it again a week later.

Everyone really liked this.  We used a vacuum sealer to really draw the marinade into the meat and allowed it to sit for 3 hours.  Then grilled it and served with Chef John's Chimichurri Sauce.

I made this exactly as the recipe. Just cooked the steak a little bit longer, about 5-6 minutes per side.  It was moist and delicious and my family loved it. I’m going to be using this recipe for all different kinds of steak

This marinade was amazing (I did take another reviewers advice and I added a little cumin as I was making grilled fajitas) —it was so very easy.  I’m keeping it as my go to marinade. I used it on a grilled flank steak (soaked steak for 24 hrs) my homemade fajitas tasted wonderful!!! I think it would be great on chicken too.

We served this for a party of 40 people.  I often make a recipe for the first time when I am having company. Every now and then it turns out to be a bad idea, but this time it was a homerun everyone love the flank steak recipe, And I have already shared the recipe with some of our partygoers. The flavor was amazing and that steak  turned out beautifully. We will use this recipe again and again

Very  good marinade! I forgot the Lemon juice and also I only  had low sodium soy sauce on-hand. So, a taste test called for a pinch of additional salt. I'll keep it this way. We loved it- I also sed a food sealer bag to marinade for 2 hours -I was pressed for time.

Easy, quick, super delicious! I only had 30 minutes to marinate and it came out delicious! Iron skillet on the grill for 5 1/2 minutes per side, wrap in foil when done, let it rest 10 min then slice. Perfect.

Wonderful marinade.  Does not overpower the flavor of the meat, just enhances it.  Made as stated, but used 1/4 C EVOO & 1/4 C avocado oil for the vegetable oil.

Delicious - even though we were a bit shy on the worcestershire and only had about 2 hours to marinate.  The flavor of the marinade is wonderful, and I'm sure a longer amount of time would make for a more tender flank steak.  We will definitely use this marinade again!

Made this recipe tonight along with the "Amazing Oven Roasted Potatoes" recipe, and they were both A BIG HIT! Definitely a "keeper". I did substitute a lower sodium soy sauce and added regular mustard because I was out of Dijon mustard. But the recipe was amazing...  And super easy!

We enjoyed it, but thought it had a little too much red wine vinegar and not enough salt.  I'm not sure if next time I make it I'll add more soy, more Worcestershire, or just another marinade.

The flank steak turned out well.  I needed to cook it around 6-7 minutes per side on the grill.  I followed the directions as written and the flavor was very good. I marinated it overnight.

Easy to prepare and pretty tender! As another reviewer suggested I boiled the remaining marinade until it thickened into a nice sauce and drizzled a little over the meat and added some butter sauteed mushrooms. Looked fancy and tasted wonderful!

I made it with skirt steak and it was really tasty,  next time I try marinating onions separately and grilling those with the steak.

Delicious and perfect.  I cooked it with my Sous Vide then seared it on both sides on the grill.

This is delicious!  I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar because so many others had suggested the switch.  Followed recipe otherwise and cooked on the grill.  My 16 year old son who is very picky about his steak loved it!  No fajitas here, ate it straight up....had the butcher tenderize the flank steak.  Thanks for the great marinade!

Exceptional! I made similar marinade before but want to try a new recipe and this is a keeper. My flank steak tasted perfect! I don't know if I can replicate it next time. Unfortunately, I did not follow the ingredients to the T. I had no lemon, did not measure any ingredients and added fresh finely chopped rosemary. I made 1/2 cup of marinade for 1.5lbs of steak and marinaded  3 hours.

Made it second time. Still didn't have all ingredients. No lemon again. This time used Rice Vinegar, soy sauce/brown sugar for another salmon dish. Came out delicious again.

I made this recipe and added two changes: honey & liquid smoke. I marinated a flank steak for 24 hours and grilled it. The flavor of the marinade lasted through the cooking.  I will use this recipe again when marinating meat for a long time.

I followed the recipe but marinated overnight.  It was good but a little on the salty side. Next time I would use low sodium soy sauce.

I followed the instructions, pouring the marinade over the meat, and left it in the fridge all day. This turned out really good as the meat was tender and flavourful. I will definitely be making this marinade again.

Nice marinade recipe, good for company and a no-fuss recipe. Another way to cook this is in a cast iron pan. Sear the steak on both sides and finish off in the oven.

I've used this marinade probably a hundred times over the years for grilled flank steak, sirloin steaks, and chicken. My whole family loves it. It is my go-to marinade for any grilled meat. If you follow the recipe exactly, you can't go wrong, but I've also substituted and added ingredients and it still tastes great. The longer you marinade your meat, the better it tastes (as with most marinades).  If you make flank steak, remember to slice it thin and against the grain. Delicious!

I use a little less soy sauce. I've made this recipe at least 10x now and I LOVE!! Oh and we use it on a skirt steak rather than flank. So good.

I made  exactly as the recipe said and let the steak marinate for about 6 hours.  It was a huge hit...and so simple to make.  This is now my go to recipe for flank steak marinade.

I used to make it according to the directions, always great. Now I modify it with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Its a great marinade, no matter which you use.

Giving this 4 stars because I did not follow *exactly*. The only changes I made were leaving out the mustard and using olive oil instead of vegetable as that's all I had.  It turned out wonderfully with amazing flavor! Will make again and again!

This was definitely too sweet.  If not for the sugar, it is a very good marinade.  Tried it again without the sugar,  added an extra clove of garlic, 2 tbsp of finely chopped onion and swapped the red wine vinegar for a balsamic reduction.  With the changes my family loved it!

good marinade; not great tenderizer?  i've done both 24 and 48 hour marinades (per recipe directions) on ~1lb flank steaks from costco and while the marinade flavor is good the tenderness is not (imo).  where i did find success was making a single pass on each side with my 48 blade jaccard tenderizer and then "sous viding" (sp?) for 12 hours (at 131F) with no seasoning/marinade.  post water bath flash chill for ~30mins and then place steak with marinade ( exactly per this recipe ) in zip loc bag for 4-6 hours.  pull steak from zip loc bag, rinse and pat dry, sear steak on 500 degree grill 30/secs/side for 2 minutes (don't be afraid to sear for less time); pull from grill, wrap in tin foil and let sit for  ~10 mins.  i've done both 12 and 18 hour water baths and the 18 hour was borderline mushy although it was definitely very very tender which some folks may still like.  given how thin flank steak tends to be it doesn't take much heat to over cook which results in chewy steak defeating all tenderizing efforts.  my 4 cents...

This skirt steak was amazing! I didn't have soy  and worchestershire sauce so I used  tomato sauce instead, and I substituted the dijon mustard for mozzarella cheese. I also didn't have skirt steak so I used breaded  chicken cutlets...... Best chicken parm I ever had!

I have been looking for the ultimate flank steak marinade for years and at last I have found it on all recipes.com.  This marinade is the perfect combination of ingredients that enhances the meaty meat flavor of a flank steak.  Absolutely delicious and my search is over.

Made this exactly per the recipe.  All 3 of us loved it!!  I did cook it in my cast iron skillet on the stove and sliced it up to use in steak hoagies.  Meat was tender and very flavorful.  Just bought more flank steak to do it all again.  Also would make great fajitas if you prefer a Mexican spin on your steaks.  Absolutely delish.

Super easy to prepare, smelled incredible, but was way too salty for our liking (and we like salt).    I would possibly try it again, but use low sodium
Soy sauce next time.

Turned out great. No left overs!!! Used for fajitas and cut the meat into strips before marinating for 24 hours. Cooked in cast iron skillet with peppers and onions. Add more spiced mustard for more tang. Thanks for the recipe, we will use it again!!

i'm actually really sad to say that i didn't care for this.. however bf liked it.. i ended up eating something else for dinner.. something about the dijon was too overpowering for me.. which is weird bc i love mustard in marinades.. i left out the worcestershire as i'm out and only used a splash of oil instead of the full amount.. i used this on chicken quarters.. i dont think omitting the worcestershire would make that big of a difference but i could be wrong

We just had this for dinner with mashed potatoes and salad.  The only thing I had to change was sub white wine for lemon because we were out.  I grilled it indoors on a cast iron grill pan.  This was amazing!  I will definitely make again and won't change a thing

This is an easy and delicious recipe. I tried it with Flank steak, Skirt steak and Flatiron steak, and the Flatiron is by far our favorite. I will always use a Flatiron cut from now on. This is my go to recipe when I bring it to a friend in need and it always gets rave reviews.

Love this marinade. Definitely my go to, when we're wanting to grill flank steak.  Occasionally, and especially if I don't have time to let it marinate for very long, I use the same ingredients to also make a sauce, subbing out the oil for water/unsalted chicken stock, and some corn starch.

If you want a perfectly good steak to taste like Swiss Steak or worse yet, liver, follow this recipe.  I bought 2 flank steaks at Costco, marinated one according to this recipe for 9 hours in the fridge, turning every hour or so.  I took both steaks out about an hour before grilling and put some Montreal Steak seasoning on the unmarinated one.  Both cooked side by side on the Weber grill to medium rare, some red in the middle.  The marinated steak just tastes like a cheap piece of meat, while the Montreal Seasoned steak was quite good.  This recipe might be OK with a tough pot roast or lesser cuts but not on a nice cut like a good flank steak. Waste of a good piece of meat.

I've used this marinade many times for flank steak.  Typically I make it per the recipe with delicious results.  My marinating time varies from 4-24 hours. Tonight I added 2 tablespoons of honey to change things up a bit and my family liked the addition.  Without hesitation, I would recommend trying this recipe  just as written although there are some excellent ideas in all the reviews for adjustments.

Delicious!  This is now our go-to marinade for flank steak.  The only substitution was a good quality balsamic vinegar vs the red wine vinegar.  Put everything in a ziplock bag, put in fridge, & marinated almost 24 hours.  Grilled it 7 min per side, made a sauce out of the marinade, sliced it very thin for fajitas.  Melt in your mouth tender, juicy, flavorful. Outstanding.

Meat turned out tender, flavorful, tangy.  I chose to omit the oil and didn't have any lime juice, but it turned out wonderfully.  I did add about 1 tsp of salt as I knew the soy sauce wouldn't be enough sodium. Marinated for 7 hrs and grilled on the bbq: great, easy.

I did make one change.  I only had balsamic vinegar, so used it.  It worked wonderfully and I will use this recipe again, although, I'm going to use the red wine vinegar as directed and then compare them.  But, it was delicious.

Really delicious flavor….next time I will marinate longer…probably 12 hours or a bit more.  The flavor was awesome but a bit tougher than I would have liked.  Also, the hot grill (for medium rare) was bit too long to cook (5 min, I think should be 3 minutes per side for medium rare….my steak was about 1/3 inch thick.  
Flavor was sublime….made marinade as listed.

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe. I always follow it exactly and it never comes out wrong. I have lost count of the number people I have given the recipe to. The only thing I do different now is I use skirt steak (we like it better). Even writing this review is making me hungry for this - it never fails and is a go to marinade in our house. highly recommend!!  also, marinate overnight if possible - makes amazing leftovers!! if you manage to have any...

I made the recipe as written, except I did not have lemon, so I left it out.  The result was a delicious, flavorful and extremely tender grilled steak. The next time, I will lighten up on the worchestershire sauce, since I found flavor a little too pronounced, but I will definitely make it again.

Family loved it!  It has a slightly tangy-sweet flavor.  It made this less expensive cut of beef taste like a gourmet steak from an upscale restaurant.

Loved this - made just a few changes for ingredients I had on hand. Used garlic flavored olive oil, preserved lemon, red wine, a splash of sesame oil, and a little less soy sauce so it wasn't too salty. Started it marinating in the morning and it was ready to grill for dinner. Very tender and flavorful. Will definitely make it again.

The steak turned out OK, but was still a little tough. Round steak is a better choice at the same price.

Very tasty!!! I had to sub the red wine vinegar for balsamic because that's all I had. Otherwise everything was made as written. The meat was tender and very flavorful. Definitely making again.

I've made this recipe several times as is.  The only thing that I've changed is the marinating time.  Two days is perfect. Also before you put the flank steak in the marinade score the surface lightly with a knife. Hubby grills this 7 minutes on each side and then let's it rest for 10 minutes before serving.  We've used it for fajitas and a topping for a salad.  Awesome recipe.

Amazing! Juicy and flavorful steak. Your guests will ask what you used for marinade.  I used skirt steak instead of flank -- grill for 3 minutes per side on high then let stand under foil for 5 minutes.  Substituted hot sauce due to Worcestershire allergy.

Boy oh Boy! This turned out awesome steak for our fajitas last night.  I don't think I've ever had a more tender piece of meat.  Next time I'd like to play with adding some cumin to the mix of sliced green, red and yellow peppers I also grilled but with sour cream and monteray jack cheese, we scarfed these up like it was our last meal! Will be repeating this one often. Update: Used this same recipe in a steak salad last night.  Honestly, this is really a to-die-for steak recipe and I highly recommend it. The meat practically melts in your mouth.  Try it!

A place that served the best black diamond steak , changed their recipe and it is awful now.So I searched for a marinated steak and found this one.I didn't change a thing. My husband and I fight over the charred ends and the last bits of steak. Yummy!!! I buy several flank steaks at a time just for this recipe. :)

I have use this "base recipe" for skirt steak, making a few alternations. If you have a higher grade cut of meat, skirt vs. flank, you don't need to marinate as long. The cheaper the meat, the longer the marinade is my experience. Don't overcook, I do this in a skillet on stove top and sear it, then turn down gas to very low. Flip to other side, searing it on a higher flame, then turn down for another 4-5 minutes. All depends on your taste and the thickness of the cut. As always, let the meat rest prior to cross-cut slicing. Delicious with side of rice topped with avocado, fresh diced tomato and onion.

Loved the flavor, but it was so oily! I used 1/3C instead of the 1/2C and wish that I'd used even less! Delicious flavors, though. I marinated for 6 hours and the meat was very, very tender. My picky kids aged 12, 9 and 6 all really enjoyed it.

I marinated it for 9 hours, and it was flavorful but I really had trouble with the grilling time.  My flank steak was thin on one side and thick on the other and after grilling for 4-5 min on each side, while the thin side was just pink inside, the thick side was purple on the inside.  We put the thick side back on the grill again, and after about 5 more minutes it was still purple inside. (I didn't want to overcook it!)  Each time we took it off the grill we let the meat "rest" for a few minutes before slicing into it, so it ended up taking FOREVER to cook.  It was a fiasco, and at the end it was a little chewy (maybe from our fiasco) but the flavors were good.  Served with Mashed Potatoes, gravy made from the marinade that I saved after preparing it, and Kale.

Had this for dinner tonight. Marinated it in my Foodsaver for a couple of cycles, then let it sit in the fridge for a few hours. Took it out, brought back to room temp and ran through the Foodsaver again. I've often thought of trying flank steak, but thought it might be too tough. No way. This was excellent. I did score both sides in a diamond pattern before marinating. Grilled over indirect heat for about 6 minutes per side. Perfection. The marinade was divine. Served with "Mouth Watering Stuffed Mushrooms" (giant size) from this site, and an orzo salad. All I can say is WOW!! This was a truly first class meal and we all enjoyed every bite!

Holy cow!  And by holy cow I mean devine bovine!  I substituted honey with Splenda brown sugar because I'm on a low carb diet.  I substituted the black pepper and cayenne pepper with lemon pepper and chilli powder because that's what I had on hand.  I pan seared each side and broiled on highfor about 9 minutes each side bbecause my bbq was broken.  DElish!  Melted in my mouth and the flavor was spectacular.  Will DEFINITELY make again!  Happy Hubby big time.  Thanks!

Used flap meat purchased from Costco.  Thinner cut so put it on the BBQ for 2 minutes each side on high.  While the meat did not come out medium rare as preferred, it did not matter since the flap meat was amazingly tender.  Paired it with mash potatoes and green beans with red pepper and minced garlic stir fry.  Boiled the residual marinade for 5 minutes on high to make it safe to use as a sauce over the mash potatoes and the meat.

Substituted a 12 year aged balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar as suggested by reviewers.  Marinaded the flap meat for 36 hours in ziploc bag.

Definitely will try this marinade on different cuts.  Delicious and no leftovers!

Really good, next time I might try to sub in balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar as it seemed a little overpowering.  Meat was very tender and delicious though. Thanks for sharing!

This was great. We didn't have dijon mustard so I just used mustard powder and other than than, pretty much stuck to the recipe. 
We made a sauce/gravy with mushrooms, the marinade, milk and some cornstarch. Delish.

SO GOOD.  I used a sirloin from Whole Foods (so a little better than a flank steak) but I only marinated it for 2 hours instead of 6.  My kids and husband gobbled it up in no time!  I will definitely make this again!

Absolute favorite at our house. Have made this MANY times! We salt and pepper the steak before throwing it on the grill to allow for a great sear/crust. Amazing flavor. My kiddos can not get enough of it and there are never any leftovers. We usually marinade a few hours. When done over night the meat was a little tougher for some reason.

EXCELLENT MARINADE!  The only thing I changed was the garlic. I had some that I had roasted the night before, so I added 3 large roasted cloves that I minced.  I also added a little montreal steak seasoning to the top of the steak just before grilling.  We only marinated for an hour and the flavor was delicious!

I have made this a couple times and have used balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar because it was all I had on hand. People liked the balsamic taste, but I thought it was too strong both times.

I made this twice.....first time as the recipe was written.....very bland and tasted "heavily oiled"......changed to olive oil, used sweet soy sauce, added 1/4 C ketchup, lime juice instead of lemon, more garlic, salt, cilantro and smoked paprika.....the second time it was absolutely wonderful.

This is a pretty good recipe, however for authentic "South Texas" Steak fajita's use skirt steak, I replace the Soy Sauce with Sprite, use lime juice instead of lemon and forget the mustard.  Add some cilantro to taste.

Good recipe but to save time just use Italian salad dressing and Worcestershire

I did exactly as the recipe stated. The steak had this strange acidic after taste to it that we did not like at all. Maybe it's the lemon and the mustard. Will not try this again.

This marinade, made with ingredients most people have on hand, makes a tasty flank steak!  I quartered the marinade ingredients for a 1/2lb piece of flank steak, which worked perfectly.  Even grilling on an indoor grill pan (our outdoor grill was out of propane) did not detract.  4 minutes per side, with an 8min rest, led to a perfectly medium-rare.

Did not care for this marinade at all.  There was an underlying sweetness that was not at all pleasant; DH thinks it was because of the Worcestershire sauce.  In any event, we were glad we tasted it before marinating the steak.  Ended up using a different recipe.

Delicious marinate.  Marinated all day, the vinegar and lemon juice tenderized the meat.  Very flavorful.  A definite do again!

Very good AS IS. I marinated a 2 lb skirt steak for 24 hours. Broiled for 8 minutes each side. Served with carmelized Maui onions & large white sliced mushrooms.  Spread just a bit of Dijon on Tulare rolls from La Brea Bakery. Easy! Everyone raved about how delicious and tender the steak sandwich was. Definitely use fresh lemon juice.  I prefer savory to sweet so will stick with the red wine vinegar. Next time I'll try adding the cumin, coriander and substituting lime for Fajitas as several have suggested.  Thank you for the recipe.

My family loved it! I marinated the flank steak for 24 hours to really get the flavor in the meat. Because the weather was frigid, I cooked the steak on my George Forman Grille. It was ready in 3 minutes and my family ate it all! Excellent marinade. Going in my recipe box as a staple in my kitchen!

Great recipe!  I marinated my flank steak for 3 days in the fridge and grilled it about 8 minutes/side.  I was expecting to use steak sauce or horseradish but the flavor was so great on it's own, I just sliced it and ate it without any condiments.

VERY TASTY!!! This is a keeper!  I didn't have Dijon, so I added a smidgen of mayo to regular mustard to equal 1 tablespoon. I only had to marinade for about 4 hours since I used my vacuum sealer :)

I did balsamic vinegar instead of red wine, actually used paul newman balsamic salad dressing which has a little bit of sugar and some herbs, marinated 24+ hours, used the canola, grapeseed, and olive oil mix-DELICIOUS!!!  Lisa said best fajitas she has ever had!!

sauce was good. I added a little lime juice to give it a little more zing since I did not feel it had enough. Marinade itself was just right. I marinated for 6 hours. The meat was tender and juicy with rice and side of peas. I think next time I may use olive oil instead of vegetable oil as a personal preference.

This is a fantastic marinade.  I actually used flat iron steak, which I find comparable to flank.  I did marinate for a day and half.  No sauce was needed.  It was delicious.

I followed this recipe to the letter in all but the mustard, didn't have dijon so used regular, and it was cold and raining so I browned in a skillet with the juices. I can't say enough about the amazing flavor and tenderness of the flank steak. I will try to use the rest for fajitas as suggested by others. I also can't wait to try again on the grill. I only wish I could convey more adequately how outstanding this recipe is. Bravo!

Just okay for my boyfriend and I. We did have to cook it in the stove (finished it in the oven) so I don't know if grilling would help the marinade come out more. Probably wont' make again.

Delicious marinade!  My family loved it.  I marinated it overnight in a ziploc bag and actually made it on my gas stovetop on a nonstick grill pan!  Followed the directions otherwise and it was perfecto!

I only gave this a four because the meat wasn't very flavorful.  I used this meat for fajitas and found it didn't have quite the right taste I was hoping for.  I would make again, but maybe add some more garlic and not use for fajitas - maybe sliced on top of a salad or something.

This was wonderful!  I used a flat iron steak instead of the flank steak and it turned out beautifully.  I made this steak for fajita's and there was a sweetness to the steak I didn't like for that purpose, I'm not sure if that was from the dijon or the red wine.  The steak by itself though was fantastic!  Super moist and incredibly tender.  It was hard to tell when it was done because the meat stayed so soft.  I will definitely be making this again!

I have used your recipe a number of times with good results. Thank you for sharing. I recently made the marinade recipe and used tenderized skirt steak for beef fajita. I only had medium sweet soy. I am sure I bought it by accident. Everyone raved. It has become a pantry staple. I kept everything else the same.

I made this last night and used the beef for fajitas.  After my husband's first bite, his eyes widened and he said it tasted like a restaurant fajita. He is very picky. Thanks for a wonderful marinade. I will use again and again.

I've made this twice and it was wonderful both times.  Each time I marinated the meat for 24 hours and ended up with a wonderful flavor and very tender meat.  The first time I made this, I ran out of soy sauce and ended up using about 1/2 soy sauce and 1/2 Moore's meat marinade.  I actually think the flavor was better on that one.  Either way, this is a fantastic recipe that I doubt my family will ever get tired of.

Wow, I really wanted to like this more. After reading the rave reviews, I was a little disappointed. I marinated it for six hours as suggested, but I just found it very bland. A much easier marinade I do is Italian dressing and soy, and honestly, for having to go to the trouble to concoct this mixture, it was not any better. Just okay. FYI, there is a steak tip marinade on this site by Domenici that is outstanding. I think I'll stick to that next time.

This marinade was awesome.  I made it exactly as stated.  I only marinated for 3-1/2 hours and my meat was very flavorful.  Next time, instead of throwing away the marinade I will boil it and use it as a sauce to serve on the side.  Everyone was sopping the juices off of the serving plate.

Made the BEST fajitas I've ever had.  Cut the steak into strips and put it in a skillet with some peppers and onions and a couple spoons of the marinade.  They were absolutely wonderful.  Used half balsalmic vinegar and half white wine vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar and used spicy deli mustard instead of dijon.

I didn't do the lemon juice (didn't have it) and only marinated for 4 hours.  It wasn't very flavorful.  Just O.K.  I won't make it again.

used balsamic vinegar as the red wine vinegar for more punch and subsituted lime for lemon juice as I prefer lime flavor in fajita intended meat....but pretty minor changes to suit to my taste!

I didn't care for the flavor. Some of my guests thought it was good but the majority ate only one fajita then went to a veggie only filled tortilla. That is rather telling being that I have a meat and potatoes kind of family. I won't try it again.

Husband and daughter (I don't eat beef) loved what this did what could have been a very tough cut of meat.  They thought the outside was a tiny bit dry due to the marinade browning, but loved the tenderness and flavor inside the meat.

Absolutely wonderful! The only thing I'd change is doubling the recipe!! The whole family loved it. I made this again for a fajita style meat and adapted this recipe using using balsamic in place of red wine, adding a tbsp sugar...then at the end when adding the bell peppers and onions, added a packet of fajita seasoning. Again, could not be more pleased! Thank you for giving us this wonderful recipe that can be tweaked here and there for totally different recipes.

Not too shabby.  Due to rainy conditions, we cooked it in the broiler.  Nice flavor and not as salty as I thought it was going to be using all that soy sauce.  Followed this recipe exactly and will definitely use again.

This is a perfectly fine, flavorful marinade. I doubled the recipe for 4 flank steaks, and let them marinate in large zip-loc bags overnight. We grilled them up, and everyone was happy with the results. I'm saving it in my freezer for future use (one more time before I'll discard it).

The marinade was a little strange.  And, this isn't against the person with the recipe, but this might be better on another cut of meat. I find Flank very fatty and tough.

I followed this recipe exactly. I did not care for it at all and warmed up some leftovers for dinner. My husband gave it 4 stars and had seconds. Just personal preference I guess.

I have no idea what happened, but this was tough and didn't taste very good to me on fajitas.  I didn't have a chance to let it marinate for as long as the recipe calls for, so maybe 3 stars isn't fair, or it could have been the meat.  I don't know that I will be making this again.

Great marinade. I used Top Round London Broil because I couldn't find any good flank steak. I didn't change the recipe at all. I marinated it for a little over 24 hours and cooked on the grill for about 5 minutes per side. It came out perfect!! It was a nice medium/medium rare after resting for 10 minutes. It was so juicy, tender, and flavorful that I will definitely be making it again. I used it for fajitas and used some of the marinade to cook the onions and peppers in, those were great too. For a $5 steak, this tasted just as good as a NY strip. Awesome!

I didn't know this was so easy and fast!  The marinade was great and this would taste great sliced up on a nice salad.  And easy new steak to try making if you've never made flank steak.

Great as a steak, or just saute some veggies in some reserve of this sauce and put together some GREAT fajitas!  My hubby requested that I invite his family over for them shortly after I made them the first time.

These are delicious!!!  This steak is great for Fajitas.  Very tender and delicious!  Make sure to marinade for at least 24 hours.  If you are making fajitas I would suggest to chop the steak into large strips so that the marinade soaks into the steak better and is easier to cut into bit-sized strips once it's cooked.

Very good, I served beef sirloin because I wanted to make sure it would be tender.  I marinated 24 hours and it was perfect.  I broiled it 6 mins. on each side.  Served with guacamole, homemade salsa, black beans, sour cream, and cheese for fajitas.

Was very good, as expected from the phenomenal reviews. I used less soy sauce, and I substituted olive oil and white wine vinegar. Otherwise I followed the marinade recipe exactly. Marinated the steaks for 2 days and cooked them in a skillet. Yum!

This really is a great marinade. London Broil was on sale so I used that instead of flank steak. I'm not a big fan of London Broil but this marinade was so good it made it taste great! My whole family couldn't stop eating it. Thank you for a recipe that will be part of my weekly dinners. Oh and BTW I used the suggestions and used Basalmic vinegar.

This was delicious! I marinated it for 24 hours and then grilled it on my barbeque. The only critique I have is it was a bit on the salty side, I think adding a bit of sweet to it would help. Next time I will try putting a bit of honey in the marinade. But it was super tender!

Wow Wow Wow! Absolutely perfect proportions of each ingredients to make this marinade. I made this for a tailgate and all were raving about the steak. My butcher told me to use London Broil instead of flank steak because it is more tender (& cheaper)...it was!

Great marinade! I let it marinade for just under 7 hours and it was not tough although I think overnight would help it become even more tender.

I was skeptical of all the good reviews for this recipe so I tried it.  As I suspected the steak was a little tough. I'll stick to Skirt steak, Ribeye, Porterhouse and Filet when I want a good steak.  The marinade was tasty.

Great marinade! Left it on top sirloin steaks for 6 hours and then put them on a hot grill for about 10 minutes; everyone loved the flavor. We'll be making this again.

So delicious!  Like another reviewer, I grilled half of the steak for dinner one night (delicious!) and put the rest of it in a slow cooker with a packet of fajita seasoning and 1/2 cup water for fajita meat the next night.  Both were outstanding!  Flavorful and tender!

This recipe is fantastic! The flavors are delicious and the meat always comes out tender. I do usually have to cook mine a bit longer than the recipe calls for, for just personal preferences. I will be making this recipe over and over again!

This was really good.  Used some to marinate/grill portobellas too.  My 5 year old couldn't eat enough of it!  I will definitely make this again and try as fajitas.  I can't wait to make a steak salad tomorrow with the leftovers.

This recipe is a real keeper. I didn't have time to marinate for the full 6 hours and it still came out delicious.  I also broiled mine in the oven 5 minutes on each side and served Wild Mushroom Sauce (also on this site) with Portabella Mushroom Ravioli.  Wonderful combination of flavors. We will definitely be using this marinade over and over.

I've tried this marinade on flank steak, back strap from a ram, and just now on a new york strip steak.  It has been fantastic on all of them.  I bet it would be great on hamburgers too.  This will be my go-to recipe for marinade. Thanks!

I used balsamic vinegar, and followed the rest of the recipe to a t, and it was phenomenal! Once I marinated for a few hours, and the next time, I put the flank steak and marinade in a freezer bag and tossed it in the freezer for later. (as someone else suggested) Turned out great both ways!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I buy a huge flank steak, cut it in two, and double the recipe.  Make the marinade right into two gallon size zip lock bags - one for today and one to freeze.  When I'm ready for the 2nd one I just take it out of the freezer a day ahead and it's ready to go for dinner the next night.  Easy, yummy and I'm a dinner time hero.  My entire family loves it!

4 stars b/c I had to tweek this recipe a bit b/c I thought it tasted bland.  I added 1/4 c green onion, 1/4 c. brown sugar, dijon mustard, 1/4 c.bourbon, garlic powder, black pepper.  I also rubbed my steak with cracked pepper, a few red pepper flakes, a bit of cumin and paprika.  Put it in the crock pot and let it cook all day.  Boy was it good!!! Sooo tender and juicy.  We used it for our fajitas.

This turned out pretty well, although I need to tweek it a bit for personal taste. That's the great thing about recipes though, there's usually room for allowance to meet your own personal tastes. The steak was really tender. Thanks for the recipe!

This is delicious!  I love to make this for guests when they come.  People ooh and ahhh over the flavor.  I marinate the steak for 24 hours and it is soo moist when you grill it.  I will have to try it with fajitas!

Really good but I did not have the mustard or whortshire sauce so I added 2-2.5 TBSP of cumin and 1-1.5 TBSP of meat seasoning.  It was really good.  I actually didn't even marinate it, I just cooked it all together and boiled out the remaining liquid.

This recipe was decent. It wasn't a bad flavor. Although, it didn't have an overwhelming flavor to the beef. I marinated for over 24 hours. So I don't think I will use this again.

Amazing! Marinated for 4 hours and it was wonderful - would be better with a thicker steak, marinated for longer.  This was so good my sister and I are using the recipe to cater a 300 guest bday party.  Kudos to the recipe poster -- we'll be grilling our steak at home instead of eating out from now on!

I tried this with New York Strips. It was great. The only thing I changed was I added a teaspoon of honey to mellow out the vinegar. My wife isn't much on change and she loved it. Steaks were tender, juicy and flaverfull...

Just made this today for Mother's Day and it was outstanding.  Had to use London Broil, so it took longer to cook, but it ws VERY good and all enjoyed.

Quick to prepare with a nice flavour, I cut this recipe in half as I was using 2 eye of round steaks (didn't have flank and came across this recipe).  Marinated for about 7 hours and our steaks came out tender and full of flavour.  I'm sure this marinade would be even tastier on a better cut of meat!  Served with Herbed Mushrooms with white wine (from allrecipes) and a green salad.

Very good.  My children REALLY liked.  It was easy and made a quick week night dinner.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I thought that the sauce kind of tasted like balsamic vinegar after marinating for that long. And, I was hoping that this would be a recipe that I could make when guests come over...I guess I was expecting something else.  It was still decent, nonetheless.  I'd make it again.

From the reviews, I expected that this would be delicious but was still surprised by how good it was!  I don't like mustard at all but made the recipe as written and I wouldn't change a thing.

This was pretty dang good right here.  I was in the mood to try a little something different, and this hit the spot.  Real easy, not messy, and turned out with real good flavor.  I like my food a little spicy, so I did jazz it up a bit, but all in all, this is one you should try.

What a wonderful, tasty steak recipe! The marinade is one of the best on this website.  I kept the marinated steak in the refrigerator for about 8 hours instead of 6 hours. Since I was using 1 inch thick steak tenderloin, I grilled the steak in the oven for 7 - 8 minutes on each side and it turned out medium to well done and did I say it was VERY tasty?  Hats off to the author of the steak marinade.

I made beef fajitas using this marinade last night and the whole family loved it.  My husband, who is usually very critical, and usually says things are "okay" really loved it.  I added a little Chipotle Chili Pepper seasoning to give it a little Mexican flare, and it turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe! We will be keeping this one.

Quite easy and tasteful marinate. I used a sirloin tip steak and only marinated it for a couple of hours.  Had quite a 'bite' from the vinegar,I am not sure that I would have wanted to have it in the marinate for an extended period of time.

This was a really good marinade.  I would make it more often but I don't feel that flank steak is all that cheap.  I'll pay a little more for a better cut of meat.

I followed this recipe pretty much as directed, except for using red wine instead of vinegar!!! It was OKAY, but I guess I expected alot better for the reviews it had.  I guess it just was not my taste. It was fairly tangy.  It tasted better after a few bites.  But I will not use this recipe again!!

GREAT MARINADE - thanks Connie!  I doubled the size of the meat and tripled the marinade to have extra for topping to finished meat - excellent.  This makes excellent leftovers for Fajitas or Steak Salad the next day!

The flavor of my steaks turned out fairly tasty even though I only had two hours to marinate. So I am sure that overnight marinating will be great when I try this next. My only complaint is that my meat turned out a little tough for my taste, but I believe that it is because I am an unexperienced beef cooker. I will definitely try this again.

The marinade is pretty flavorful.  The soy and worchester sauce are pretty strong flavors that you'll get here.  Not unlike just using a straight worchester. 

Not sure I agree with Flank Steak as a choice here for fajitas.  This was my first experience with flank and it's a very rubbery meat.

This was honestly the best marinade I have had in a long time! It was so tasty and made the steak so tender. I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used rice vinegar and it didn't make a difference. I will use this again!

Ended up marinating this for about 3 days as things kept coming up and didn't get around to grilling. Was very good, definitely a keeper.

I love this recipe so easy and a crowd pleaser. I wrote down red wine instead of red wine vineager but it turned out so good that I will keep the wine.

We liked the meat after it cooled down.  It was just fine when hot, but we kept snacking on cold steak (I really don't do that).  I would like this steak for a green salad recipe rather than the fajitas we tried to have.

Great Marinade!  I used this on a couple of eye of round steaks and I marinated for about 20 hours, I then grilled and sliced thinly for fajitas.  I made a few changes-used lime juice rather than lemon, as another reviewer I added coriander and cumin as well as a few red pepper flakes.  My family liked it so well they want to try it on other steak cuts.

My whole family liked this one - little ones and all.  I did reduce the soy and dijon to cater to young pallets.  Will make again with a thinner cut flank steak.

My husband liked the flavor of this.  I'm not a huge fan of flank steak, but thought I'd give this a try.  I thought it tasted very strong - maybe the wine?  I would probably try this again, but maybe tweak the recipe a bit.

YUCK. All we could taste was red wine vinegar.  Used flank steak - steak was tender but marinade ruined it.  Will definitely stick to old recipe.

Great for fajitas.  We added crushed red pepper flakes for an extra bite.  Also, make sure you cut into thin strips for fajitas to get the full flavor of the marinade.  Goes great with margaritas!!!!

This makes fantastic fajitas!  My husband loves them and said we will never go back to packet marinades again.  We do add a little bit of cumin to spice it up.

This is a keeper!  I used limes instead of lemons and only marinated for about 2 hours.  I used flank steak and top sirloin with this.  Everything turned out great and was very good!

This was a good recipe.  I think it could've been 5 stars, but I only marinaded my meat, which was venison, for 6 hours.  I think maybe with venison, I should've marinaded it for at least a day.  I had a some let over because I didn't make much meat the first time, so I poured the rest over chicken breasts and let them marinade for 2+ days.  They turned out WONDERFUL!!  5+ stars for that time!!!

Amazing!!!  The meat is so tender with lots of flavor.  Great recipe for people who prefer their meat not well done, because you can control the temperature better than traditional recipes where meat is already cut before cooking.

This was good.  The next time I will use half the amount of lemon suggested.  Maybe use lime instead. I thought the full amount of lemon was too tangy.

Wonderful flavor!  I let it marinate for a couple of days to really tenderize the meat.  Even hesitant diners (weren't Flank Steak lovers due to the toughness of the cut) were impressed with the tenderness and taste!

Guests at our party raved about this dish.  I've shared the recipe with several.  Although the exterior is a little salty, having thicker meat and accompaniments takes care of that.  It's absolutely scrumptious!

Although this steak was tasty, I was disappointed that the flavor of the marinade wasn't stronger.  I followed the recipe as written, and even let it marinate for 24 hours.  I will probably try this again, although maybe I'll let it sit longer.

VERY good.  I couldn't marinate the meat for as long as the recipe called, but I did marinate for about 4 hours.  It still came out well seasoned and delicious!  My husband, who doesn't eat too much red meat, loved this.  What's great about it is - flank steak is a pretty inexpensive cut of meat, but this recipe is still great to entertain with. 

Thanks!

I was only able to marinate for about 2 hours and it was good.  I'm sure it'll be even better when marinated for 6 hours!  Dinner guests enjoyed, even a picky 8 yr old and 3 yr old!  Can't wait to try again.

This is it! We loved this. 
We used the meat in steak and cheese sandwiches, I know, I know...not the steak I should use, but it worked well. Thanks for a keeper!

This was very good, tangy; and I don't even care much for mustard.  But we like G's Flank steak marinade better - not that this is a contest.

We loved this marinade!!!  I followed the recipe as written and served the meat with some sauted bell peppers, onions and garlic...came out great!  I did pour a bit of marinade on the veges as I was cooking them to give them some flavor.  This was really good and I only had about 5 hours to marinade the meat and had to grill indoors due to the weather...still came out great!  I'll make again...and again!

This is so good, especially if you let it marinate overnight. Also, it is so easy that my boyfriend even made it and he usually only mans the grill.

This was delicious.  I did 5 minutes per side in a grill pan and when I cut it, the meat was a bit too rare in parts.  I threw it cut back into the pan just to lose the red.  Sauteed some onions and peppers and served fajitas!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Great recipe!  I liked that the soy sauce was an ingredient, but not the main flavor.  I only had time to marinate for 2 hours, so I cut up the steak into chucks and made kabobs.  Delicious!  Thanks.

I would give this ten stars if I could.  I have used this marinade twice for fajitas.  They turned out so tender and amazingly delicious...also very addicting since I continued to eat and eat although I was very full.

I really loved this recipe.  I needed a great marinade sort of last minute and could only use ingredients onhand, so I had to make a few changes, but it turned out amazing!  Even my very finicky eater hubby raved.  I cut back the oil out of personal preference, used squeeze bottle lemon juice, a little more worcestershire because I love it, didn't use dijon mustard because my husband hates it, and had to use garlic powder instead of garlic cloves.  Also, I think I used london broil instead of flank steak.  Anyway, I was nervous about the combination of the strong flavors but it was absolutely fantastic and I'm going to use it all the time now. By the way, we used ours for quesadillas. Awesome!

Good marinade. I think marinating overnight would be best. I also would rather use a different cut of meat- flank steak is just too chewy for me. (even when sliced thin on the diagonal)

Connie you are the hero for the day at our house. Had this flank steak that I had NO idea how to make taste good. Your recipe was great. Cooked mine in the oven at 500 on a grill rack over a pan for 8 mins on each side and was a perfect med-rare. Can't wait to make again and again and again....

My family and I thought this was delicious! I usually make my husband prepare and make the steak because I'm so bad at it, but I did this one myself and got great reviews from my husband and my 2 year old son (who ate an entire steak himself. I used the round steaks because that's what I had. Very yummy! Thanks!

The only thing that we could taste was the lemon juice. Husband doesn't want to eat this again. It did tenderize the mean really well.

This was a great marinade. I didn't use the dijon because I didn't have it and I only let it marinade for about 3-4 hours and the meat was still very tender and flavorful.  Will try with olive oil next time.

This was wonderful!  I used it on two rib eye steaks and marinated them for about six hours.  I omitted the garlic because my husband doesn't "do" garlic in anything, but the basic marinade is great without it.  I'll be using this again - copper

Me and my boyfriend both think this would work better for marinating beef for kabobs.  Very good though, we just thought we should have been eating it off a stick.  lol

I prepared this recipe for my boyfriend's birthday.  He loved it!!  Said it was better than Morton's Steakhouse.  I want to try marinating hamburgers with the same ingredients.

Tasty. The flank steak was tender and very flavorful. I followed the recipe except used less oil (and used olive oil instead).

The flavor is wonderful! My husband loved this. The weather was so bad I ended up Broiling this instead of Barbecuing and it still turned out great! Thanks we will make this again!

great marinade, I added some liquid smoke and lots of Garlic, everyone liked it. The only thing I would do different is to wipe of the steaks after marinding to get some of the oil of the surface.

This was superb! I wouldn't change a thing, except to say that the longer you let this marinate, the better. Delicious.

I only marinated this for an hour and it was still great.  I was hesitant about using it for fajitas because of the ingredients, but it worked out great.

Got lots of raves for this one so I'm giving it 4 stars. I didn't think it was good for fajitas, which is what I made it for. I should've followed my instinct and used lime instead of lemon and skipped the Dijon altogether. And I'm not sure about the red wine vinegar either. Otherwise it was a nice marinade - just not what I was looking for for fajitas.

Fabulous marinade! I only let it soak for about an hour and a half and it was delicious -- i can't wait to see what it tastes like after marinating for the full time suggested. Thanks for a great recipe!

This marinade was so easy to prepare, and it is so delicious!  My husband and I ate it already three times the first week that we tried it.  It was excellent on beef for fajitas.

This was outstanding. The meat was VERY tender and the marinade was not over powering. We stuck to the suggested recipe. Only difference was the cut of meat. We had sirloin on hand.

I used this recipes for London Broil.  It was excellent.  I omitted the mustard seed and used white wine vingear and lemon pepper instead of lemon juice.  It was great!

Very good marinate.  I think it would have been a ton better if I had a beater piece of meat.  Our meat had a lot of fat.  Will try agian with better meat.

This was very, very good!  I marinated the steaks for about 24 hours.  I was amazed with how tender this cut of meat became with using this marinade.  Will use this again!  Thanks Connie.

Delish!  Served with my own roasted red potatoes and "Field Salad" from this website--awesome meal!  We did 2 steaks--one we cooked 4 minutes a side which gave us steak that was medium pink through and through--my husband did the other 3 minutes a side which gave him the rare steak he loves.  Thanks for the recipe!

By reading the ingredients I thought "yeah, Ive made stuff like this before...".  I tried it and marinated overnight.  My beloved grilled the meat as I blackened peppers and onions for fajitas.  I have to say, these were wonderful.  My beloved even said they were the best fajitas that he has ever had!  Thank you...I cant wait to make again!!

It was wonderful!!! It makes the steak very juicy and tender. The great thing about it is it doesn't have a strong taste at all, but it is just enough to give the steak a bit of flavor. Great for steak lovers!!!
