Made this for a party along with several other dips and this one was the clear winner by number of compliments . Everyone hovered over the bowl and fought over who dipped next! I made it the day before and everything had lots of time to meld together.

This stuff is so good! I first made it for a gathering and everyone thought it was great. I made it again recently and reminded myself how yummy it is. I made the recipe exactly as written.

This was a huge hit at our work potluck. I used my grandmother's Russian dill pickles which are a bit sweet and added a bit of yogurt to mellow out the mayo. Great with both chips and veggies especially banana peppers.

The raves and reviews I have received from this dip say it all! Extremely tasty and delicious! Use zesty pickles to amp up the spice factor just a bit! I've made this so many times!:)

This is good but I felt like it needed something else. So I added some chopped up some Vidalia onion and some turkey ham. Yum!!!

So easy and quick to make. We found it's better the longer you let chill. Served with veggies and chips.

This dip is addicting and was a huge hit at several holiday gatherings I attended. Super simple to make too! I doubled the amount of cream cheese to compensate for adding more pickle juice (be sure the pickle juice is not sweetened)

I found this recipe because my 91 year old father-in-law couldn't remember his dill pickle dip recipe! I had never tried it. My changes were the amounts of dill garlic and worcestershire sauce used: I cut back to 1 teaspoon of each. It was still so delicious and was quickly devoured! I have made it twice now and will continue to. The next time I will try the zesty dills as other reviewers have mentioned. Either way this is a favorite now! Thank you for sharing.

I've made this divine dip twice. The first time was with no variation. The second time (today) was with fresh organic garlic (minced) and Old Bay seasoning instead of Worcestershire. Both were winners but the fresh garlic wins hands down.

Made a tray for a bar-b-que dill pickle wedges black olives homemade black breads chunks and a big dish of Dill Pickle dip. The Dip got raves from all. Took regular veggie tray in the past and no one noticed it. This dip is a winner! Made it just as recipe was written.

I changed the pickles to stuffed green olives which gave it a bit of kick and a minced clove of garlic which gave it some more.

My friend and I have made this recipe many times, and have brought it to parties.  It's ALWAYS been a hit!  Everyone always wants the recipe and it always receives many raves!  Very garlicky... but so worth it!!  Will make again and again!  I make it exactly how the recipe is written.

The bowl was practically licked clean! Followed the recipe, except I didn't use Worcester (didn't have any on hand) and added a few cloves of raw garlic (because everything is better with garlic). I used both spicy and regular dill pickles. Deeeeeelicious  I'll be making this dip often!

Awesome dip. Didn’t think it would be this good. Made just like it’s written but used an 8-oz jar of dill relish instead of the chopping. This is a keeper!

This is quite possibly THE MOST ADDICTING dip I have ever tasted. The only change I made was using just 2 tablespoons of pickle juice. Delicious!

Tasty! We used the full 1/4c of pickle juice and it was too liquidy even after chilling. Next time I'd start with 2 Tbsp. We omitted the dill weed the dill in the pickle juice was plenty.

This dip is amazing! It's even better than the store bought one. No reason to ever buy that again! It's way too expensive and isn't as good. I think it might be fun to try this with spicy pickles too. Next time I make it, I might try to chop the pickles in my small electric chopper to get a finer chop.

My husband and I are big garlic lovers, but this was so garlicky that it was inedible. Couldn’t even taste the pickles. If we make it again, we will drastically decrease the amount of garlic and dill.

This is definitely "different" than the average dip. I wasn't sure if I liked it or not at first but it definitely grew on me the more I ate it. My husband thought it was weird though. I took it to a baby shower and got compliments on it.. they seemed to love the dill pickle flavor.

This dip is awesome! I used fresh garlic as some others suggested and let it sit for 4 hours up let the flavors soak in. I also used spicy pickles to give it a kick.

I made this dip according to the recipe. My aunt makes her dip with cream cheese, pickles, dill pickle juice, salt, and pepper. She got me addicted, when I tried her version. I cannot tell which one I like better. I will definitely be making this one again.
