This recipe is great; use 4 cups of white flour not 8 cups; if someone actually did this, not much wonder it was dry; to make it more authentic double up on the caraway.....very nice!!!!!

I was sorely disappointed with this recipe.  I've been looking for an "authentic" Eastern European rye bread, but this was definately not it.  The loaf came out dry, fairly hard, and absolutely flavorless.  I'd look elsewhere for a good rye load.

Recipe has to much flour and not enough liquid to make the bread.  4 C of flour may work but needed more liquid at that.  I have it rising now. Bread came out to be 4" tall two loaves. Used 2 1/2 cups water and 1 1/2 cup butter milk and only 4 C bread flour, and 4 C rye flour.  Tastes just fine. A little less rye flour will make it rise more. But it is fine as is.

This was a horrible waste of a lot of organic flour. When I added 4 cups of rye flour, it was so thick and heavy that I knew it was never going to work out. I was right. It never rose at all-total mess.

The recipe says to add an additional 8 cups bread flour and there is no way that much flour will work int he recipe.  I had a hard time getting 4 cups of bread flour worked into the dough.

I found this bread good but seems to be missing something. Using a sour dough starter could make the difference. I have some ideas. Will let you know.

Even though I have sourdough starter, I decided to try this version. I was disappointed. I think it would work using 2 cups of sourdough starter instead of the buttermilk mix sitting overnight and the addition of caraway seeds. It is an ok start to making sourdough rye, then adjusting.

Very nice.  If you don't have good sourdough starter, but can't wait to try this recipe, substitute a pint of sour cream plus one extra TBS (one packet) of yeast.

It work out wonderful. I used my sour dough starter (made from rye flour) followed the "formula" starting with only 4 cups of bread flour and it was spot on! banged out 6 rounds today.

Obviously the recipe is incorrect, but that said, with a few minor adjustments (more salt, more caraway, less flour), it makes a good loaf of rye.   The overnight sponge needs to be wet - like thick batter wet, so make sure you add enough water.  If you wind up with extra dough in the end, who cares?  Make a roll.  As it states, add flour until the dough pulls away from the sides of the mixing bowl and isn't too sticky to knead with your hands.  Keep adding flour as you knead, just a handful at a time, until you get the tacky consistency you're looking for.  Form a loaf, let it rise and bake as directed. Just for fun, I baked mine in the Pyrex mixing bowl.  It made a flying rye saucer!  If you like your crust chewy, brush the top with a little water after baking and removing from the baking dish.

Flavor was great. I couldn't mix in more than five cups of bread flour. Crust turned out super hard, inside isn't too bad. BUT this was my very first time making rye bread, so with practice I will get better.

Didn't work for me, how wet should starter be at tbe first stage?  My bread rose,but was very spongy and never rose in the oven, no spring so very flat.
