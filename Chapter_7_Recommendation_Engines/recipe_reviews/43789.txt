This is an absolute favorite side dish that I often serve as the entree. I use chicken broth instead of vegetable and walnuts instead of pine. I live in an area that doesn't always have the luxuries. When I serve it as a main dish, I double the amount of mushrooms that really give it a meaty flavor without the meat. I've fooled lots of friends. Leftovers are good cold, for summer outings I've added fresh diced tomatos and green onions to the cold mixture, keeping it in a cooler until serving.

Even my non-veggie hubby loved it!  Cut butter in half with no ill effect.  Skipped the green onions (felt it already had enough "onionage").  Baked at 400 for an hour since i"m at 5500 ft altitude.  The pine nuts got all toasty, and it was quite good.  I am a barley fan.  I will try using a rice cooker next time as it frees up the oven for other things!

This was a very simple, hearty, and delicious recipe.  I sauted the vegetables in olive oil rather than butter, and I added chickpeas for some more protein/fiber.  I did have to keep this in the oven longer than 75 minutes, so next time I will increase the oven temp.  This was my first time cooking with barley, and I'm happy to report that it won't be my last!

I used Minor's beef broth and pecans and almonds.  I also cooked it in my rice cooker with great results.  The leftovers were mixed with brown rice, chorizo, red peppers, tomatoes, cilantro, black beans,  etc for a hispanic twist providing a high fiber, complex carb meal

Scrumptious!  Very easy to prepare.  I used chopped almonds in place of pine nuts.  I will definitely be using this recipe again in place of potatoes and pasta.

This was very good. I cut the butter and added carrots and corn to add some color. I plan to add more veggies next time!

Thanks for the delicious recipe.  I wasn't sure what to expect having never cooked barley before.  I love this site for the reviews of the recipes. Because I read the reviews first I made this recipe adding 1 shredded carrot, 2 cloves of chopped garlic and 1 tsp of thyme.  It is so delicious that I know I will definitely be making this again and sharing the recipe with friends.

I've prepared this dish twice now.  I recommend covering the barley bake for the first 45 minutes, stirring, then cooking for another 45 minutes uncovered.  The second time I made it, I threw in about a cup of shredded carrots in the last 15 minutes and it made the dish pop with color!  The nutty flavor of the barley and the pine nuts is so lovely.  Ingenious recipe!  I love it, and I plan to use it at Thanksgiving this year!

Great! My family and I aren't vegetarians, but we all enjoyed this recipe -- even our 10 year old loved it. Would make again for a unique holiday side dish. One note: watch carefully when browning as the barley tends to brown quickly.

I have used both pine nuts and sunflower seeds in this recipe. You can also eliminate the salt without comprimising flavour. This is definately a keeper.

This is so much better than I expected!  I love this.  I added parsley and green onion as a garnish.  Great recipe!  I'll be making this again.

This recipe is basically fail proof. I didn't have as much pine nuts on hand as the recipe asked for but it still was very good. I would definitely use more pine nuts next time and I will use this recipe again.

This is such a versatile recipe.  Perfect as is, but the 2nd time, I tossed in a tbsp of garlic and a half of a minced red bell pepper (or one small jar of pimiento's) and it was delish!  Also - as a time saver:  add the broth directly to skillet after all ingredients are in and bring to a boil for 2 minutes.  Then pour that mixture directly into your casserole dish.  Bake uncovered for just 45 minutes.  Perfect!
P.S. - I actually tripled the mushrooms ....  but then again, I am a fan of the shroom.

Very Tasty.  Mushrooms gave it a great taste.  Next time I would add more.  I used the suggestion of another review and after browning in the pan and put it into my rice cooker. Pefect and easy.  Also I used seseme seeds instead of pine nuts cause of allergies.

Very tasty.  I doubled the mushrooms, omitted the parsley (didn't have any) but added a large handful of fresh spinach. The pine nuts added a great textural change & nice flavor. Like it a lot and will make it again, might add even more spinach. Thanks for a very good recipe.

I really like this!  The first time I made it I jotted down the recipe on scratch paper and accidentally used 2 cups, rather than two cans, of broth.  Needless to say, the barley was a little chewy. :)  The second time, still not realizing the error in how much broth I was using, I used one can of broth and covered the dish with foil for the first hour of baking.  Turned out great! I may just do it that way from now on,  though I'm a little curious about how it would turn out with two cans of broth.  I double or triple the amount of mushrooms when I make it.

So good! I used olive oil instead of butter but the first time it was far to greasy. Second try I cut the fat by just more than half and it was much better. Would be even better with roasted cherry tomatoes.

I ended up using mushroom broth which added to the whole dish a lot, I think. It took a long while to soak up the liquid and I didn't get it all entirely. I will probably add a little less next time. yum!

Great dish with lots of uses. I added a grated carrot along with the onion, added more scallions and mushrooms and because I was concerned about the reviews that thought it was bland, I added a whole tablespoon of dried basil and  used chicken broth. Served it with Chickpeas in Tomato Sauce With Feta and Wine from this site and it was very satisfying--whole family thought it was great! My tomato/mushroom hating son picked out the tomatoes but didn't even realize there were mushrooms in the bake : ). As an added bonus, the leftovers will be a good start for a soup!

Great side dish idea - I don't have enough good barley recipes!  I added minced garlic during the sautéing step, and finished it with grated Asiago.  Also, I waited until after it was cooked to sprinkle on the green onions.  Served it alongside roasted salmon.

This was very good.  I rinsed the barley first - sometimes the processing misses stuff.  Substituted celery for mushrooms (that is what I had on hand).  Easy and delicious. Thank you Katinhat.

I can't get enough of barley. Was so happy to find this recipe. It's easy and doesn't require much in the way of ingredients. I didnt have the vegetable broth on hand, so I used chicken. No green onions or pine nuts, either. It was absolutely fantastic! Can't wait to try it with all the intended ingredients! Will be making over and over again.

Really good!  We haven't really ever had barley, so we weren't sure we'd like it, but apparently we do.  I left out the mushrooms since we didn't have any, and used vegetable bullion with water (4 cups of it).  As someone else mentioned, the barley browns quickly in the pan, so keep an eye on it.  I have an oven safe skillet I use for things like shephard's pie, and I used it for this so I didn't have to transfer to another dish and dirty something else.  Worked perfectly.  At 1 hour and 15, the liquid wasn't quite all absorbed, so I turned the oven off and put the dish back in for another 1/2 hour, which resulted in the rest of the liquid being absorbed.  I think this is great as is and doesn't really need any modifications, although you could certainly add some veggies or meat and get a main dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good, but before I made this I realized that it might be too bland for my taste. I added two cloves of minced garlic and 2 teaspoons of toasted cumin.  This definitely added a bit more flavour.  Also, I sprinkled my portion with Frank's red hot sauce because it added some much needed heat.  Great recipe that you can modify to your personal tastes.

I like the fact that this recipe woke me up to the idea of using barley as a delicious side dish.  I thought that cooking it on the stove top would have provided just as much flavor and would have used much less energy than the long time it took to bake it.  Also, I will start toasting the pine nuts before I put the barley in the pan to toast.  Putting them in at the same time as the barley didn't give them enough time to get nicely browned.

This is an easy, no-fuss recipe. I cut the butter in half and used a little broth in the sautee process. If you've cooked barley before, you know it usually quadruples in size. However, in this recipe it does not. I added a bunch of shredded broccoli to the recipe hoping to add color but everything turns a slightly brownish color.

This was very good- even my kids loved it.  I want to play around with it though to try some different flavor combinations.  Next time I make it I'm going to add garlic and mushrooms (I was out of them this time around) and maybe sub some white wine for some of the broth.  I think the possibilities are endless with this delicious dish.  Thank you for the recipe, Kat!

Yum!  I thought this would be similar to rice pilaf, but it was really more like a risotto...very creamy!  I may have used a little extra broth (it was chicken instead of veg).  I wasn't sure whether to cook covered or not...so I didn't cover it.  I kept testing it starting at 75 minutes, and it didn't seem to get any more done after about 90 minutes, so it seems pretty forgiving re: time.  Also I didn't have parsley, so I added a pinch or two of dried thyme, which went well w/ the earthy-tasting mushrooms and onions.

I made this for a potluck as a vegan dish and everyone (even the meat-eaters) loved it!  I used portabello mushrooms to dress it up a bit, and also added some carrots I wanted to use up.  There was still some liquid in it when I pulled it out of the oven, but it all absorbed in the car ride across town.  We will definitely be having this again at home!

I'm upping my rating to five stars on this one.  This is a recipe that we come back to over and over again.  Sometimes we add meat and some more veggies to it to make it into a one-dish casserole, and other times we have it as a side.  It's always tasty and pretty easy to make.  We love Barley Bake!

This one lives up to its high review rating.   Sprinkle a bit of parmesan cheese on top of each serving.  A favorite for me!

This was excellent. I served it to a flesh eater who loved it.  I cut the butter with olive oil, half and half, used baby portobella mushrooms, almost double the amount in the recipe.  The next day it was even better.  Betsy

Awesome dish!  You could cut down the amount of butter quite a bit, and I'm sure it would still be incredibly delicious.  The pine nuts already add a lot of oil.  You can refrigerate forever, and it never loses any of it's goodness.  Add soy sauce if you like to add salt.  It makes it even better.

I use allrecipes exclusively, but rarely review recipes unless I have something to add to the discussion.  This was wonderful, I'd give it more stars if I could.  I've added barley to my diet as it's supposed to help lower cholesterol.   This will be a regular at our house!

Also, I found a very easy way to prepare it:  a small crockpot.  I used what I had on hand; which was hulled barley (it's more nutritional), sliced almonds (no pine nuts) and left out the mushrooms (didn't have any).   I followed other suggestions and used about 3 Tbs olive oil for browning.  Than into the crockpot and in about 3 hours it was done.

This is one of my very favorite recipes.  I was only able to give it 4 stars as I did modify it slightly.  I use chicken broth instead of veggie broth, added a clove of garlic, 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper and 3/4 tsp cayenne pepper.  I, like many others, cut the butter down slightly (about 1/6 cup).  It is however pretty vital to the overall taste of the dish.  The 'soupiness' once the dish is cooked that some have complained about, will be mostly absorbed in 5 minutes from removing it from the oven.  The remaining moisture assists in reheating it for the next day so this has not been a problem for me.  I will reiterate what another reviewer stated, 'never use quick barley in this dish'.  Made that mistake once; it was awful.

My daughter had previously tried this and thought it was still "soupy" after religiously following the exact measurements and baking times.  She suggested slightly decreasing the liquid.  As I decided to decrease the liquid to 1 can of broth (I used chicken), I also decreased the barley to three fourth cups instead of one. After an hour in the oven it was done perfectly.  The only other change was to use half butter and half olive oil. Super delicious!  Thank you Katinhat!

I can't wait to make this for a pot luck. I made it more economical by using slivered almonds like someone suggested. The almonds were a fraction of the price of pine nuts but gave that great bite. I also used chicken stock and more mushrooms. I baked it for a while uncovered but found it dried up too quickly so I added a bit more stock and finished cooking it covered with foil. This was delicious and different!

Amazingly good. I omitted the pine nuts due to an allergy in the family, and it was still yummy. I also substituted vinegar for lemon juice. Next time I plan to reduce the amount of butter by half. A nice alternative to rice or pasta side dishes.

Snaps for Kat! What a great way to cook barley. I did alter it a bit, I used chicken broth and almonds and red onion. I also used a 1/2 bag of broccoli slaw mix from the produce section and only 3 Tbls. of butter. Even my very picky 15 yr. daughter loved it and that makes it even better!!!

Wow!! I'm the only vegetarian in my house, so I keep a low profile,:)- but nobody asked if this was vegetarian. Simple and wonderful. Gets sticky if you store it but the leftovers make a good addition to soup.

Pretty good as is though I added herbs d provence, 3 cloves lightly sauteed garlic and subbed EVOO for butter and chicken broth for veggie broth. Good with any meat/game, Even fish though I'd replace broth with fish/clam/shellfish stock/base.Next time will add a serrano chile or at least red pepper flakes.

Delicious! I was planning to make barley soup and found this.  I love it.  Made some alternations:  Used half the butter, omitted the green onions, instead, I satay chopped leeks and diced red pepper for colour.  After baking, I broiled the top for a couple minutes and it turned out great! Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe.  This one is a keeper will be a house staple.

Awesome. I was confused about whether to cover it or uncover it... so I covered for the first 3/4 of the time and uncovered for the last 1/4. It was pretty soupy still but it tasted great and after it set for a little, most of the liquid absorbed. I cut the butter down a lot. It's not necessary. And I suggest using low sodium chix broth. I also subbed basil instead of parsley which was excellent.

I have made this repeatedly, and for company, and it's always great.  I've never had green onions.  I have subbed dried parsley and dried onion.  I didn't want to part with my precious pine nuts, so I used chopped almonds on all occasions with great results.

Delicious and easy! This was more a mushroom-barley bake for me, because I used 1.5c mushrooms (I love them). I browned the onions before adding the barley, used olive oil, and didn't add the pine nuts until after baking, because I prefer them crunchy. This was just as good without the nuts (I forgot to add them at first!). I might sub thyme for parsley and add garlic next time. A perfect dish for a chilly fall evening!

Absolutely delicious!  I had a white rice recipe which was very similar, using green onions and pine nuts.  This is every bit as tasty and way more nutritious so I'll be using it from now on as a side dish instead of rice.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.  I've never used barley in anything other than soup before.

Geez Louisiana is this good! The only real changes I made was to use olive oil instead of butter and chicken consomme instead of veggie broth. I scaled it down to two servings which left me with odd measurements (still don't know how much 2/3 of 14.5 oz is...), so I eyeballed proportions. I was worried about the pine nuts toasting too fast in the skillet but it wasn't an issue. A serving for two baked just under an hour. This will be a regular on my table!!

I made a cross between this and the "Barley Mushroom Riscotto" also on this site.  It was good.  It was at least 4 stars the way I made it, but since I didn't use mushrooms, and I think I undercooked the barley, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.

Fantastic vegetarian recipe!  I sautéed in olive oil instead of butter and used just under the 1/4 cup and would do less next time.  I know it says the mushrooms are optional, but between them and the pine nuts that's what makes this dish so special!

Great recipe. So easy and very versatile. I added shredded carrot, chopped zucchini and chopped cashews (no pine nuts). I also added a handful of sunflower and pumpkin seeds. For a little kick, I added a small amount of red pepper flakes. I also added some marjoram and parsley as well as some fresh basil. I didn't cook it in the oven, just on the stove top and it went really quickly. My husband likes a little bit of cheese sprinkled on top. I omitted the salt due to the vegetable stock.

This is a great side dish ... enough left over to put in the freezer! I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh and took the advice of another review and didn't add the extra green onions. I used vegetable bouillion so I should have omitted the added salt. I served this with the Sweet and Tangy Glazed Salmon from this site ... yummy!!!!

My husband and I LOVE this recipe!!  It's a  welcome change from the usual rice pilaf or potato dish.  The Barley Bake is healthy, can easily be varied with different veggies if you so choose, and is always a winner!  Thanks for a great recipe...

As a vegetarian trying to cut out all animal products- I thought this recipe was delicious.  I haven't cooked much with grains but thought I'd give this recipe a try based on how good others said it was.
It reminded me of a mushroom risotto (just not as creamy) but yummy just the same.
I used olive oil instead of butter (and would half that amount next time), added a few chopped carrots, and doubled the mushrooms.  An awesome recipe!

I made this dish for a pot-luck and it was a huge success.  I followed advice from other reviewers and added zucchini and carrots for more color.  (zucchini may not have been the best choice, with its green hues...) I also used less than half the butter.

Very good side dish. I have always added barly to stews and soups, it's great to have a dish that showcases the barly flavor. I left out the green onion (some of my family are not big onion fans). Next time i will substitute almonds for the pine nuts. Thank you for submitting this dish.

As a widower living at the bottom of S.F. Bay, I'm happy to see such enthusiasm for Barley Bake & esp. variations using a rice-cooker - I use my Zojirushi pressure-cooker. I grew up on beef-barley soup (my Scottish dad was Glaswegian), but am a near-vegetarian @ 71, having learned to substitute beets for beef (at Weight-Watchers/Providence in 1972.)

Very good! My hubby is allergic to barley, so I substituted buckwheat. I also used 4 cups of water plus a heaping 1/4 tsp. of miso for the broth. I used red onion since that's what I had on hand and doubled the mushrooms per other reviews. Simmered on the stove for 25 min and it was done! Will definitely make again!

A somewhat temperamental dish, depending on your quality of ingredients, but delicious when done just right.  I add chicken when making this for various potlucks.

I LOVE this recipe.  I was on allrecipes, looking for a way to add barley into my diet and this one looked promising.  It's really tasty and, when i reheat it for lunch the next day, I throw in a steamer (those bags of mixed veggies you can buy), and it's really colorful and even healthier than it started out!  I do use chicken broth instead of veggie broth, but that's because it's what i keep on hand.  Great recipe!

We've made this multiple times this winter. You can switch up the veggies - we tend to use diced carrots, turnip, parsnip, celeriac, etc. The pine nuts are genius! And though I'm sure you can reduce the butter, it's yummy.

We really loved this with a few modifications. Like others suggested, used chicken broth in place of vegetable. I also increased the mushrooms, and added shredded carrots and chopped celery. Next time I will add diced chicken for a 1 pot meal.

I saw this recipe today and thought I'd give it a try once I got home for something new! I changed the recipe alittle bit since I didn't have any pine nuts or mushrooms. Instead I used one zuchinni and one orange bell pepper. As well I used the chicken broth - 1 cup and 1 cup of tomato juice. This turned out amazing and so tasty!! We ate the whole cassarole dish! Definitely will be making this again.

I was worried about the texture of this dish being too uniform, I was so happy to be wrong! The pine nuts got a bit toasted and it tasted amazing! I added more mushrooms and had to bake it for longer to soak up all the liquid. I would bake it hotter next time.

This was amazing! My husband was very skeptical, but after trying it he just loved it. He said he wouldn't mind eating it multiple times a week!  To me the mushrooms really made the dish. I used baby bellas and they gave the dish a fantastic flavor.

Very good and very easy to make.  I stuck closely to the recipe, though I added a few sunflower seeds in addition to the pine nuts, per another reviewer's suggestion.  I also added a little bit of dried garlic, and more mushrooms than called for.  I ate this as an entree just because I was trying it out, but I think it would really be a perfect side dish for the holidays, or for any meal.

I dunno if I did something(s) wrong, but this took a LOT longer to cook to get the liquid absorbed and to get the barley at a palatable texture.  Perhaps I didn't use "pearl" barley...  Not quite sure.  So, I guess my review doesn't really count that much!  Oh, well.  I'll give this one a shot again because the flavor was good.

Excellent and very versatile!  I used walnuts instead of pine, and added some diced carrots, broccoli stems and chickpeas that I had on hand and it was wonderful!  My super-picky non-veg husband even loved it!  I foresee this becoming a staple in our family!

I've been making something very like this for years without the pine nuts. Usually I add some sliced water chestnuts and a little soy sauce to the chicken or veggie broth. I've also added sliced and quartered zucchini and/or summer squash to it (around 1-1 1/2 cups, I think-ymmv). I've also added some lightly browned cubed chicken breast meat to it or brown chicken breast filets or pork chops and then place them on top of the barley and cover the casserole with foil or a lid before cooking. I'm going to try this tonight with some almonds that I have in the pantry.

This was wonderful.  I changed it just a little.  I used chicken broth instead of veggie and omitted the parsley ( I didn't have any) .  My meat eating husband loved it. It was hearty, filling and really easy.  I baked it for exactly 1hr and 15 minutes and the barley was perfect.

Very good vegetarian dish. Sometimes I find it needs a bit more water than stated.

This was very good! I didn't have any mushrooms, so used some thinly sliced carrots for color and texture. I will say that after 1-1/2 hours, the barley was still very firm and some liquid left, so I ended up finishing it in the micro for 5 minutes, so apparently it takes more than 1-1/2 hrs. to cook. And my oven runs hot!! On the downside, my husband and son didn't like it much---and my son is a huge fan of brown rice, which is somewhat similar. So it may not be very "family friendly".

This was the blandest thing I have ever made.  Somehow my husband and I rescued it with lime and cumin after first trying it.  For the amount of time it took and the outcome I don't think I will make it again.

Five stars because my kids all loved it.  Very good recipe as written, but I can see how one might want to add some other vegies and spices.  I made it as written and enjoyed it very much with grilled chicken.  I love pine nuts and always have a bag in the freezer.  This is a much better side dish as far as nutrition and fiber go.  Try it...you'll like it!

Loved it!! However, I didn't have pine nuts or mushrooms. Used instead, diced carrot and frozen spinach. Also substituted chix broth for the veggie broth. I never had barley before so this was a terrific introduction. Thank you.

This recipe was a big hit. I replaced the onions & mushrooms with carrots & green pepper, and only used 1/2 of the butter called for in the recipe. Very tasty!

In an effort to sneak some vegetables in my diet, I added about a cup of frozen peas to this recipe and cut back on the broth just a bit to compensate for any additional moisture they would add. While the peas came out a bit discolored, the bake overall was fantastic!

I would recommend holding off on half or all of the parsley until after baking, otherwise it becomes discolored and somewhat tasteless.

This was so good.  Didn't use nuts or mushrooms, but added carrots when I sauteed the onions, and frozen corn before putting in the oven.  We loved it.

Easy and tasty.  I had no pine nuts so substituted with sliced almonds.  Also added some diced celery and garlic, some Italian herb mix, cherry tomatoes, and chopped spinach (this one only added in last 10 min of baking).  Topped off with some shredded parmesan/cheddar mix for the last 10 min of bake.

Amazing! Made this a few times.  Love the pine nuts in it.  I prefer to add more mushrooms and use low sodium broth.  I use less broth than it says because it doesn't always absorb enough in the 1hr 15 min.  Regardless, it comes out great every time - you may just have to drain the excess broth before serving.  Stays well in fridge for a few days.

Following other reviews, I used chicken broth,some garlic and thyme,carrot,almonds(didn't know I was out of pine nuts)and fresh parsley. It was very bland and I am curious to figure out how to infuse some more flavor.I can't imagine how bland it would be without adding what I did, maybe I didn't add enough?

For some reason, this takes way longer to bake than the directions for me.  Maybe it's my oven?  Regardless, this is a VERY tasty and healthful recipe.  It's a regular dish in our house.

I use beef broth, chili powder to taste, add leftover roast beef, cubed green peppers, carrots, mushrooms, almonds and, during the last ten minutes; cherry tomatoes. Sometimes melt cheese on top and serve with french bread.

This is a really hearty dish!  I did make a couple of changes but I don't think they are significant enough to be called major.  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil, and since I didn't have any vegetable broth I used chicken.  Added a pinch of oregano and lastly I toasted the pine nuts for a few minutes to bring out their flavor.  Served it with a roasted chicken and it was awesome!

6/14/10 - Update:  Made this again and added a small bit of chopped celery and carrots.  It added a subtle flavor change and the carrots made it look pretty!

I searched for a recipe using barley after learning of its great health benefits. This recipe was intriguing to me because most others were for soups. I'm embarrassed to be one of *those* reviewers who rates an altered recipe, but I made some changes based on personal preference & suggestions from other reviewers. I replaced half the butter w/ EVOO & used chicken broth instead of vegetable. I also omitted the mushrooms and didn't add any salt. Very simple prep- my 7-yr-old did most of it with my close supervision. The outcome was delicious! At the table we seasoned each serving to taste with more freshly ground pepper & sea salt flakes. I can't stop craving this & I bet I'll make make it every week!

Great recipe to start with!  I made the following changes:  no mushrooms (personal preference), added 1 can of drained, rinsed garbanzo beans, added 1 pkg of frozen spinach, doubled the barley and broth amounts.  Turned into an excellent main dish, with plenty left over for lunches the next two days for work!

I didn't use:
#  2 green onions, thinly sliced (didn't have any)
# 1/2 cup sliced fresh mushrooms (don't like)
# 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley (I used the Chicken herb mix from HerbTyme)
# 2 (14.5 ounce) cans vegetable broth (I used beef broth instead.)

Our thoughts - it was good but needed more flavor.  Other suggestions are add shredded carrot (probably not my choice) or garlic, cheese, paprika, or cumin (all may be good additions).

my fiance didn't care for the almonds (had no added flavor but good for texture) I might use pecans next time.

I would also caramelize the onions first.

Really liked this dish.  Definitely a keeper.  Didn't use butter but a few sprays of Pam to cut the fat.  Didn't have Pine nuts so I used sliced almonds instead.  Really yummy if you like it nutty.

I left out the butter completely and used cooking spray. I was out of mushrooms so I added shredded carrots and celery. I also added garlic and used white onions. Quite good and easy.

i had never prepared barley before, so i wasn't quite sure what to expect.  i read the reviews and other recipes on the site and altered this a bit.  i sauted chopped onion, carrot, celery, garlic u til softened.  then  i added slivered almonds and the barley and followed the recipe from that point on.  it was delicious!  even my picky, husband & kids loved it!

This is a really good vegetarian side dish, especially for a pot-luck.  It seems to be missing some sort of spice though, still need to figure that out.

I loved this recipe.  I served it up with apple porkchops, and it was a big hit with my guests.  It's tastes somewhat like a risotta but the barley gives it a unique look.   The pine nuts were tasty, but not necessary.  If you want to keep the cost of the dish down, you could probably substitute with another type of nut without really hurting the dish.

This is a great recipe. I've made it several time since I found it a few months ago. The only change I make is that I saute the onions until they are a little browned before I add the barley and pine nuts. I like it better when the onions are browned.

This did not turn out well.  I followed the directions, except I used 32
ounces of vegetable broth instead of 29 (because I had container of 32 and
didn't know what I'd do with 3 measly extra ounces).  When I baked it, I  
checked on it after 55 minutes (recipe says bake for 1 hour 15 minutes)
and the liquid was already absorbed and the edges were blackening.  The
taste was pretty flavorless: I couldn't taste the onions, most of the pine
nuts were overcooked (although some were decent), and the mushrooms, while
good, were few and far between.   Maybe it'll work if I bake it
shorter or at a lower temperature or in a taller thinner baking dish, but
I will not try again.

I love this recipe, but no one else that I have made it for does.  However, I am giving the rating.  So there.  I think this is a healthy, unique substitute for a starch side dish that is full of flavor and texture.  I'll make it whenever my husband isn't home.

Really, really good!  My husband and I really enjoyed this.  Be careful not to leave it covered in the oven for too long or you'll end up with barley soup instead!  The pine nuts are great in this!

What an incredibly tasty and easy recipe. I used 2 TB butter + 2 TB olive oil, 6 oz sliced baby bella (next time will add all 8 oz), 2 stalks celery, 1 cup diced red pepper.  Baked for about 1 hr 10 minutes in 375 oven (UNcovered for last 10 min of cooking).  It was so scrumptious - my husband really enjoyed it too.  We had a veggie dinner last night with Barley bake, sauteed mustard greens, and toasted oat bran pita stuffed with kosher salt&peppered avocado slices - I might've met my fiber quota for the week :)  This made plenty of leftovers for the 2 of us today and is perfect for Lent season. Thanks for sharing!

Wow!  I just can't get enough of this stuff.  It is so yummy!  I served it with beef tips and gravy but it is also wonderful on its own.  I'm eating the last of it now as a snack.  

I had only hulled barley, so I added a bit more broth and increased the cooking time by about 15 minutes.  I also added one carrot and a stalk of celery, diced.  And I had only canned mushrooms, but they worked just fine.  I did find that I needed to cover it while it baked because too much liquid had evaporated.

This is a super winter time dish and I can't wait to make it again!

I usually add two packages of mushrooms and a grated carrot. I've also added kale/spinach. This meal is always a winner. Barley is underrated!

Let's see.  I left out the mushrooms and onions because I was using this to top off Nat's Shrimp and Veggie Zucchini Boats (from this site) and there were already plenty of mushrooms and onions in the boats.  I used macadamia instead of pine nuts because I can't afford pine nuts.  This turned out very well and made a great addition to the boats.

This recipe was delicious.  I really enjoyed it with the pine nuts and mushrooms.  I also substituted the vegetable broth with chicken broth and fresh parsley with dried parsley only because that is what I had on hand.  Must try recipe.

Made it as written - boring.....  heated it back up in a 1/2 cup of white wine, much better.  Next time will replace half the liquid with a white wine.  Now up to 4 stars

This was sooooo  good, on my gosh!  I loved it so much, I wish my family felt the same.  Not that they didn't like it, but it was okay for them.  I was glad there were more leftovers for me.  My favorite way to use barley.  I used chicken broth and there was a bit too much of chicken flavor, but otherwise it was great.  Will be a staple for me!

Delicious just as written!  Next time I'll use a little more mushrooms though--probably 3 Portobello caps.

I found this when looking for a recipe with barley after reading about its nutritional qualities. I omit the mushrooms and onion (I prefer raw onion to cooked). I also use Smart Balance as opposed to butter to brown the barley and pine nuts and it turns out fine. I love this dish! This is now a staple in my side dish arsenal.

Used chicken stock, added thyme, garlic, and cherry tomatoes.  Used zucchini and carrots because I didn't have mushrooms.  Doubled the salt and it was still a bit bland.  It's missing something but I don't know what.  Liked the texture.  Cooked covered for first hour.  Husband loved it.  Lots of leftovers, but I didn't check the servings when I looked at it, so I shouldn't have been surprised.  Overall okay.

So so so good!  I made it to with my lemon chicken with mushroom gravy.  I didn't have green onions or pine nuts but made it anyway.  It was a wonderful change from rice or noodles.  I added some thyme and a pinch of cayenne to season.  I will probably make it with pine nuts in the future because I love them but won't let it stop me of I don't.  Fresh parsley on top is a real plus!  My husband keeps saying he can't believe he's never had barley before.  I have some left over and it WILL be the first thing to be eaten!

Excellent and simple! Definitely more mushrooms and green onion! Tried once with 1 garlic clove, still unsure. Made it twice in 4 days for a potluck party and other event. Was gone in 5 minutes, everyone asked for more. Both times a doubled the amount of everything, and X4 mushrooms. Storing this one in my head! Sorry no picture.

This should be called if you like baked barley you will love this!!!

This is a recipe you can add (or subtract) an infinite amount of ingredients to. For instance having a few loose ends in the fridge and I included broccoli stocks, a few leftover green beans, a carrot finely chopped for colour, extra onion because I love onions, and I used an onion soup mix as the stock which was all I had on hand and it was great (saying so myself).... :)

We absolutely love this! It's easy to put together with common ingredients, it's filling, tastes great and is relatively inexpensive to make make and is nutritious. What more could we ask of any dish that isn't chocolate?

This side dish was good, but not one I will be making again.  My DH thought it tasted like something that came out of a box.  I subbed green pepper for the mushrooms, as we are not fans of them.  We liked all the ingredients in this, but I think it was the pine nuts that threw him off.  I served this with marinated flank steak and 'Special Deviled Eggs' from AR.

Good flavor but took much longer than 75 minutes to cook--closer to 3 hours, which seems excessive for a simple side dish. Next time I will cover it for the first half. Will try with almonds next time, as my kids didn't care for the pine nuts. I also added some truffle salt and garlic salt. Thinking a splash of marsala wine would be good too. --Susan C.

I used leftover cooked barley and it turned out great. Kind of like barley risotto with mushrooms. I added a little bit of water and didn't bake it since my barley was already cooked. Pine nuts were so good in it.

This is really good.  I used only a dab of olive oil instead of the butter.  I used leeks instead of onion and put in 1/4 cup chopped zucchini and a handful of chopped spinach, too.  It  has visual appeal, smells enticing and really is quite easy.

The picture of this one describes it very well. Boring. I added celery, carrot, and kale, just to add some additional color, but the flavor had no depth. It was flavorful, but the kind of flavor you might find at HomeTown Buffet. It cooked up nicely in the rice cooker and I liked the texture of the barley and the mushroom flavor, but it needs something more - not sure what. I'll keep looking.

This is a really good side dish but I found it needed more. I added broccoli and corn then sprinkled sharp cheddar cheese on it just before serving. The pine nuts did nothing flavor wise and added a texture that was unpleasant. I used chicken stock and doubled the green onion. The next day I added the leftovers to a bean and vegetable soup I was cooking. Yummy

Very good. I would suggest roughly chopping the sliced mushrooms if you already purchased them sliced. My mushrooms were thickly sliced, and I would have enjoyed this more if I had a mushroom in every bite. We are big mushroom fans.

I made this last night with minor modifications, I sauteed celery, carrots, garlic along with the mushrooms & replaced pecans with pine nuts. I used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock. Although I really enjoy barley, I found that it overpowered the rest of the ingredients and its the only flavour that came through. Although very nutritious, I won't be making this again.

Overall, I really enjoyed this recipe but I did make a number of changes.   I had a little more than 1 cup of barley (maybe 1/4 cup?) so I threw it all in. I tripled the mushrooms to make it a meatier dish, and I used 1-32oz carton of chicken broth to accomodate for the extra barley. Apparently it was a bit too much extra! The added mushrooms probably didn't help the liquid situation either. The flavor was great albeit a bit simple. I love the pine nuts - a great contrast to the chewiness of the barley. I sprinkled the dish with a little more green onion tops when serving. And I omitted the parsley all together because frankly, I don't like parsley! :)

This is a fantastic recipe, great as a side dish or eaten alone. The flavor is great and the texture is kept interesting with the pine nuts. The only modification I made was using chicken broth rather than veggie. I also had to leave it in the oven for an hour and 45 minutes before the liquid was absorbed. Next time, I'll either raise the heat a little, or just plan for the extra time. Thanks for the recipe!

This is healthy and filling but a bit bland.  I made it for my work lunches this week and found it to be a bit dull.  I did add some chopped carrot and minced garlic to pep it up but it still seems to need something.

This was pretty good, but a little bit on the bland side. I sprinkled some parm on at the end to add some flavour. I thought the pine nuts were a nice, unique touch, though.

Lovely and wonderful. I cut the butter by more than half and used chicken broth instead of veggie broth as it was all I had on hand. Full of flavor. Thank you so much for this great-tasting, healthy recipe!

Yum, this was the best barley bake I've made.  We really liked the pine nuts.  I used olive oil instead of the butter, used dried parsley instead of the fresh, and I omitted the scallions.  Delish!

This dish was decent fresh, but terrible as leftovers. Everything ends up tasting the same, and it is a bland flavor. The texture of the barley becomes unappealing. I would recommend this only if you really want to make a big barley dish, and if you have enough people to feed it to that it'll be gone in one sitting.

Amazingly good!  I left out mushrooms because I don't like them, used sunflower seeds instead of pine nuts, chicken bullion instead of stock because that is what I had on hand.  Was cooked perfect after 1 hr, 15 min.  Used the lowest tray in the oven.

If you like pinenuts this would be great.  But for our family, the pinenuts were too much.  It also lacked enough mushroom. The recipe had good texture and flavor otherwise.  We did cover the dish when we baked it.

For non-vegetarians, I made this into a one pot meal...simply by switching out the vegetable broth to chicken broth, and throwing in some boneless, skinless chicken thighs before I put it in the oven.  Tasted even better on the reheat! (I also added a clove of chopped garlic)  There was a little liquid after 1 1/4 baking, but the barley soaked it up after letting it cool.     I gave this a 4 star, because while it's a good, solid comfort food type dish, it's not exactly exciting.

I've made this recipe several time. My changes are: I use olive oil instead of butter and I use sliced almonds instead of pine nuts (simply because I didn't have pine nuts available). It's light and tasty.

The amount of broth needs to be reduced quite a bit.  It finished cooking (meaning everything reached the appropriate texture) after an hour 15 minutes, but it was quite soupy at that point and had to continue cooking for over half an hour more.  Less broth would rememdy that.  

I don't know if it would make a difference in the cooking time/amount of broth, but I omitted the (optional) mushrooms.

Great recipe.  I used beef broth and a few more mushrooms than the recipe stated. Also, if you are trying to cut the fat/calories, definitely no need to use 1/4 c. of butter.  I used 1-2 TB and it was delicious.  Served to some family who never had barley before and they loved it and requested the recipe.

This recipe was just okay. I followed the directions exactly but found that when we tasted it, it needed a little something more. It was, as some other reviewers have said, a little bland. I highly recommend adding some type of seasoning to it. The leftovers did not get eaten and we will not make this again.

Really liked this. I will reduce the butter by half next time and increase the mushrooms by another 1/2 cup. (I used the crimini mushroom, for more flavor) The pine nuts kind of got lost in this so I probably won't bother with them next time. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Reminds me alot of mushroom risotto.

very very good, made this when a vegetarian friend came over for dinner...went very well. It did need additional bake time to absorb all the liquid. 1 hr 45 min seemed to be about right.

Nice way to incorporate more healthy grains into the diet.  I used portabella mushrooms and chicken broth instead of veggie broth.  Good with a green salad.  Also backed off the butter by about 1/2 in the interest of health.

I used to make this years ago, and was super excited to find the recipe here!  Thank you!  I always left out the mushrooms, and instead of regular onion I used the white part of a green onion or shallot... Provides a little milder taste and if I recall, I used about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of chopped green onion. This dish was one of my all time favorite side dishes.  I usually made it for company as a side dish to a chicken and avocado in cream dish and served it with warm cranberry scones!  It was always a hit.  Thanks for posting it!

Nice recipe that we will make again.  I would not consider this "super special", but it is a nice side dish for times when you want something a little different.

Whatever you do, don't use Quick Barley. Notwithstanding, the dish was rather bland.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I didn't use mushrooms, but sauteed zuccini and carrots first, used 1/2 pine nuts and 1/2 toasted almonds.

I make a highly altered version of this recipe. I leave out the butter and pine nuts; I just lazily throw a bunch of raw vegetables in the pan with the barley. It bakes for long enough. I also put chicken on top and bacon makes great flavoring. Some dried thyme is also nice. Make sure you cover it!

I thought this was really good.  It had great flavor.  I used about 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 beef broth because I didn't have any vegetable broth and ran out of chicken broth.  It was very good.  My husband didn't care for it. But I liked it and so did my 7-year-old daughter. It does make a rather large recipe, so we had tons left over.

Great recipe!! Changes: Used walnuts instead of pine nuts. Use beef bouillon instead of salt. Added more mushrooms. Used the carton of veg. broth instead of the can. Added some garlic.  Added some chopped red pepper for color. Check it with a spoon to make sure the liquid is absorbed.It was a very attractive,flavorful and filling for 
not having meat in it. My fussy DH loved it and I will be making it again for sure.

This was really easy and very good.  I didn't have any mushrooms on hand, so I used frozen mixed vegetables, and they worked great.

I have made this recipe many times as it is healthy, inexpensive and a nice change.  It works with lamb, chicken or beef or a vegetarian menu.  Reheats beautifully.  I often double the recipe as my family likes to take leftovers to their homes.

I like this recipe. -- it is intersting and different. I skipped the mushrooms altogether. I think it would be good with carrots addded for more colour and flavour. Good as a side dish for sure -- probably not a main dish.

This is a great way to make barley, very filling.  I only had to bake it for one hour for all the broth to be absorbed.  Will definately make again, but will double or maybe even triple the amount of mushrooms next time.

I didn't think this dish was anything to write home about.  Sorry.  I like barley, but though it was edible I wound up throwing out about 3/4 of this dish because no one in my family was interested in eating it again.  That's too bad considering the pricey pine nuts.

This was just ordinary.  I probably could add something like garlic and some kind of sausage to make it better but I am not sure I will try it again.

This was delicious.  Due to nut allergies, I replaced the pine nuts with diced carrots, and for more flavour, I used beef broth instead of vegetable broth.  It made a beautiful sidedish for the brisket I made, and aside from the kids, everyone loved it.  A healthier and better alternative to rice, and I'll be making this often.

Since finding this recipe I have made it several times and we just love it.  Even my picky toddler likes it.  I only use about 2 TBS butter and sometimes use chicken broth instead but it still comes out perfect.  I notice others said they cover it but I never cover it and it cooks up perfect every time!

This is really terrific!  I just made it for a pork roast side dish and it went nicely.  I followed the directions exactly (except to use chicken broth and a whole 10 oz. package of mushrooms) and mine needed to bake an extra 15 minutes for almost all of the broth to be absorbed.  If you like barley, you just HAVE to try this.

JANE- Thanks for the high-altitude adjustments, I'm up at 10,000 ft and probably would have messed it up!  Turned out great!
