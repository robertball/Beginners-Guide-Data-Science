This cookie tastes great.  Only two complaints... I followed the recipe exact, and the cookies didn't brown even after baking for 15 minutes.  Also, the recipe only made 2 1/2 dozen cookies, and I made the cookies fairly small.  Next time I will double the recipe.

I had no problem whatsoever with the dough or these cookies (like some reviews I read).  They baked perfectly and beautifully in less time than the recipe suggested (that's my oven for ya though).  I do agree that it's not about the presentation with this cookie..it's all about the taste!  They are moist and delicious in flavor.  I omitted the raisins because I don't like them, and I used a tsp of cinnamon and a dash of allspice.  I also drizzled a little glaze on top just to make them a bit more appealing to the eye.  I tried it with a sprinkle of confectioner's sugar, but I liked the glaze better.  This recipe is worth trying!

I used smart lite margerine and added an extra 1/4 cup of applesauce instead of an egg to make them even healthier and they still turned out great, thank you.

We loved these cookies.  Easy to make and very moist.  My daughter doesn't like raisins, so she substituted chocolate chips in her batch-very yummy.

These are very soft, cake-like and puffy.  One batch lasted appx 3 hours at my house, a new record for us!  These cookies are very "home-y." I needed to bake mine a few mins longer than stated.  I baked them until the bottoms were medium brown and they were just perfect.  Thanks for this keeper!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I've made it several times, now, and it also works with just about anything that resembles applesauce in texture. Of course, I began with applesauce and they were great, but it also works with cooked pumpkin, raw carrots, or zucchini grated in the food processor.   When I substituted them, because they are less acid than applesauce, I added two teaspoons baking powder. I've become very experimental lately, trying to use up leftovers in the fridge!

THESE ARE , AS WAS STATED BEFORE , NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE. I WHIPPED UP SOME CONFECTIONER'S SUGAR AND MILK, ADDING SOME CINNAMON, TO MAKE A GLAZE TO TOP THE COOKIES . IT MADE THEM LOOK MORE APPEALING AND GAVE THEM A LITTLE UMPH...THEY REALLY ARE NOT VERY SPICEY, SO I DID ADD SOME ALLSPICE TO THE RECIPE. THEY ARE OK , BUT NOT ONES THAT I BAKE VERY OFTEN.

I used stick margarine instead of shortening, homemade cinnamon applesauce, and 1/4 tsp. each of ground ginger and allspice instead of the listed spices. I omitted the nuts and raisins. 

I used an ice cream scoop and baked for 17 minutes. I got 26 moist, delicious cookies. This is the best applesauce cookie recipe I have tried.

Okay, here are my changes to the recipe. I only used a 1/2 tsp cinnamon, but I wish I'd used the 3/4 tsp listed.  I couldn't really taste the spices as much as I would have liked.  I also used 1/4 tsp allspice because I don't have any cloves and 3/4 butter instead of shortening for the same reason.  I added 1 tsp vanilla and left out the walnuts and raisins which was probably a mistake too.  I also added 1/3 cup butterscotch chips and 1 tablespoon of chocolate chips just because I had them to use up.  I left the first batch in for 10 minutes.  They came out soft and doughy but still good.  I thought they might taste better crispy so I left the second batch in for 12 minutes.  They came out crispier but still soft.  I got 4 dozen out of the batter (my cookies are somewhat small) then decided to use the rest to make 3 regular size muffins which I left in for 16 minutes.  They came out very heavy; it will be interesting to see how they taste.  Overall, they weren't as spicy as I was hoping, and I guess I should have left in at least the raisins and the full amount of cinnamon.  I gave these a 4 though because I imagine they'd taste better if I followed the recipe better...

I found this tasteless and unimpressive.  Someone thought it tasted like an oatmeal cookie without the oatmeal.  The second batch I add 3/4 cup oatmeal, and they were much better.  Granted, I did omit the nuts, which I also advise against.  My total recommendations:  add 1 tsp vanilla for flavor, add a 1.25 cups oatmeal, and add a glaze of milk and powdered sugar to add some sweetness to an otherwise bland cookie.  I would also kick up the cinnamon a notch.  The glaze is clutch.  It has potential and they are especially soft and moist and hold their shape well.  Not too pretty though - reminded me of drop biscuits.

This was most like a recipe that I remembered as a child, but I too omitted the raisins and added semi sweet chocolate chips.  I also added maple  frosting to the top.  These are definitely delicious and am anxious to make them again.

Excellent flavor, soft, very light cake-like texture.  I eliminated the raisins & nuts and doubled the apples.  Also added one cup of cinnamon chips.  Made 30 medium sized cookies.  Used Smart Balance for shortening.  No need for glaze.

Maybe it's because I used margarine instead of shortening (?), but my batter was really runny, and the cookies just came out flat and suuuper soft, nothing like the picture. Really tasty, but more like flat cakes than cookies.

The cookies are tasty but very moist. Moist to a fault. The combination of spices are nice, Christmas like. ( I didn't add raisins). It was difficult to taste the applesauce because of the strong spices.

I love these cookies! My family just loves them, which says something! I didn't have raisins so I used choc. chips instead and they came out beautifully. Next time I think I'll try both the raisins and choc. chips and see what happens. Thanks for the great recipe.

Recipe is very good, easy to make. Cookies came out perfectly the first time. They don't change too much in color, so you do need to watch the edges of the cookies for slight browning. I also like to slip a knife underneath and gently lift the cookie. If it holds it shape, it's done. If it feels a little soft, it probably needs to bake a little longer. I also made tablespoon sized dough balls, and needed to bake them a little bit longer. I'd prefer a little more apple taste, so I will try adding a bit more applesauce next time.

These cookies were good.  Not too sweet.  I doubled the recipe and baked them for about 20 minutes instead of 10 to 12 minutes.  A little powdered sugar on the top made them look more appealing.

These were easy enough to make. They seemed under baked no matter how long I left them in the oven.  My husband didn't care for them at all. I thought they were ok but I won't make them again just for myself. A real disappointment  after having read the other reviews. Thanks anyway Patricia

YUM!  My mixer blew up in January, and my new one just arrived.  I couldn't WAIT to bake something. . . but didn't have tried-and-true ingredients (choco chips, oatmeal)!  I found this recipe, had all the ingredients, and set to work.  It was very easy. . . and the cookies are almost gone -- all except those that are still in the oven!  ;+)

I make my own applesauce so that what I used.
I also doubled the raisins and added a cup of pecans with the walnuts. I used 1/4 c butter and 1/2 c of shortening.

I made them.  I must have a hot oven.  9 minutes for them to be brown. I liked the way they came out.  54 years of baking helps.

Tasty cookies but for my taste I would like a little more spice.  Next time I will increase the spices a bit. They also don't brown much - but that didn't affect the flavour.  I made them small so got about 5 1/2 dozen small cookies.  I used pecans instead of walnuts (that's what I had on hand).  Not too sweet - reminds me of a muffin flavour.  I like them though & will probably make them again.

Very easy to make I used butter instead of shortning.  Not so pretty of a cookie but very tasty. Hoping my kids love after school. I omitted the nuts and raisins as kids dont like them

I didn't make these yet, but after reading the reviews my thoughts are the usual temperature for baking cookies is 350 to 375 degrees.  That might solve the problem with the cookies looking pale and unappetizing?

Thank-you for this recipe; I misplaced it and I am so glad that you posted it. I made it every 2 weeks for about 10 years as it was my kids's favorite cookie! I had tons of crab apples that used for the apple sauce--so that was almost for free! I stored it in the largest Tupperware container possible with waxed paper between the layers so they wouldn't stick together....being almost "organic" in nature I took care to freeze them whenever possible in the summer months as they do mold if left on the counter...

These cookies were quick and very tasty.  I did change the recipe somewhat.  I use 1/2 oil and 1 1/2 cup applesauce to cut down the oil.  I only had cinnamon but I don't care for clove so I was happy with the flavor.  I also added an extra egg.    I only used 1/2 of the chocolate chips, raisins, (I boiled them first), and the nuts.  I cooked them at 350 (in Utah) and 12 minutes.  They weren't crispy but were fluffy and delicious.

I made these cookies and loved them. I planned to take them on a trip with my wife but we ate them all the night before.

I did make a couple of changes though. I used toasted almond slivers instead of walnuts and chocolate chips instead of raisins.

liked this cookie, but made the following changes:  1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and added 1 cup quick oatmeal.  My husband loves these because he does not like a real sweet cookie.  I baked them @ 340 degrees for 20 mins...could be my oven, so just watch for the cookies to start to get brown on the edges.

LOVE these! I typically don't put nuts or raisins in my cookies, but omitting them (2c total!) from this recipe without substituting something else would really alter the end result. So, I ended up with 1c oats and 1/2c mini choc chips. I also upped the spices to 1tsp cinnamon and 1/2tsp ea of nutmeg and ground cloves. Excellent results. Will definitely make again! I ended up with 40 cookies.

Great recipe!  Tastes just like my great grandmother's cookie...I could never quite find that taste until now. I added flax seed and chia seeds..about 2T...and found mine were better when I left them in for 15-17  minutes.

Agreed with others...the cookies are soft, puffy and cake-like.  Tasty and easy to make.  I followed the recipe by the letter.  I will say I think they are a little bland, but I like sweeter cookies.  I will make them again, but will increase the spices to add a bit more flavor.  Feels like a "healthy" cookie with the applesauce, nuts and raisins.  At least, that's what I'll tell myself :)

Loved these! Super simple, but I changed a couple things. I doubled the recipe, used 1/2 white & 1/2 whole wheat flour and used 2 teaspoons of only cinnamon. I sprinkled cinnamon sugar over them before baking. Will be making these again!!!

These are absolutely delicious! Like many others, we made this recipe with semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of raisins, and the cookies turned out great. They even stay moist for days! This has definitely become my favorite cookie recipe.

I was excited when I found this recipe because I had a jar of applesauce that I wanted to use up. I was not impressed with this recipe at all. When I was mixing the dough it was WAY too sticky. I added another full cup of flour and it was still too sticky. I was tired of mixing so I just spooned it out and baked it as it was. Like the previous reviewer, I too found that these cookies weren't baking up well. I removed them from the oven before the burning point and they were still doughy in the middle. A big disappointment.
