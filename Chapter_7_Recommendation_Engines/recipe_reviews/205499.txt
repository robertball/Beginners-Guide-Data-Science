Really delicious!  I skimped a tiny bit on the red pepper and it was just spicy enough for me (probably used about 1/2-3/4 of a teaspoon instead of a full).  I'm not normally a tofu lover either, but this was great!

I really really wanted to like this dish, but it was just bland. I even used the sauce for dipping sauce, which made it a little better, but not much. Unlike other reviewers, I had no problem with the coconut not sticking.

Not bad, but not amazing. I would possibly make this again. The coconut didn't really stick once they were taken out of the oven though, so kind of annoying. I would probably experiment with other causes for the dipping part too. Easy to make, so that's a plus if you're short on time....definitely edible!

I'm not sure what I did wrong but the coconut did not stick to the tofu so it was kind of messy.

the coconut would not stick so there was no crispy crust, and the tofu was more on the mushy side than firm. the flavor was okay but nothing to write home about. I will not be making this again.
