Turned out delicious. I didn't have any buttermilk, so i used 1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar and just under 1 cup of low-fat milk. It works perfect as a substitute because its cheap and easy to make :)

I was a little skittish to try this recipe because the lack of reviews but man, am I glad I did! This cornbread is perfect - just what I want in a cornbread. Moist, sweet, just plain GOOD. And it was so easy to make a batch of it. Thanks for sharing! I've finally found a corn bread recipe to suit my needs.

This was absolutely amazing! I'm gluten free and allergic to eggs, so my bread selection is about 4 in the world, and they taste terrible.  I made some subs and this was still perfect.  I used half sugar/half xylitol, Cup4Cup (gluten free) instead of regular flour, plain unsweetened almond milk + white vinegar for the buttermilk, and melted coconut oil instead of veg oil.  Oh yeah, and I added half a cup of shredded cheese, too.  I will absolutely make this again.  I used an 8"x8" pan and cooked for about 50 minutes and it was huge, fluffy, and held together so nicely.  One of the best cornbreads I've ever had, even up against "normal" breads.  

I have a bread recipe now!  And it tastes like real cornbread!  I'm so excited!  My Texas-raised dad will actually get some bread with dinner when he's over!  I might stay in the will!  I will no longer be shunned!  Thank you Lori!

Whoa!   Using the 5 x 9 pan caused my bread to overflow badly.  Thankfully, since it filled the pan so high, I put foil underneath.  It is sweet and moist with a crunchy top from the sugar.  The recipe is easy and a nice go to for regular use.  I would just use a larger pan.  I don't like really thick corn bread, so that should work nicely.

I loved this recipe.  Especially having a family with egg allergies, this is ideal.  The only thing I would change personally is the pan measurement.  When the pan is 5x9, the loaf becomes very tall.  But otherwise, this is perfect!

I was out of eggs and needed a recipe that didn't include them. This was a great one!! They perfectly complimented my chili tonight, just the right amount of sweetness to go with the mild spiciness. I used a square baking dish instead of a loaf pan and baked it for an hour which was my plan from the beginning and was glad I did after reading other reviews of the mixture overflowing.

I've made this recipe several times and it is always a hit. The only modification I did was added butter about 1/8th cup, and 3 tablespoons of milk helps the batter thin out a bit. PERFECTION!!!

Liked it but yes made minor tweaks. The biggest thing I did was halved it, once I saw it would take an hour. The 2nd biggest thing I did was cook in a skillet; added ~1/3 cup of vegetable oil directly to skillet, then poured in batter. Oil rises to the perimeter of batter, then spooned oil just over the top, until top surface wet. Learned technique from mother-in-law, but wanted to try a different cornbread.  Cooked on 425, and it only took about 30 minutes, give-or-take, and still enough for left-overs.

I really liked this, but I did cut the sugar in half, and soaked the corn meal for a few hours, was good :)

I happen to have a 10" X 4.5" "tin" bread/loaf pan I picked up years ago at a yard sale (for a quarter, I think).  Given the concerns raised by other reviewers about overflow, I decided to back this recipe in my "super-sized" bread pan. It filled it nicely (leaving me to wonder how my oven floor would have fared, had I used the standard (and called-for) 5 X 9 pan.  The recipe is easy, quick, and uses a minimum of tools and pans.  It does bake up nicely and has a nice corn flavor.  It is a tad sweet for my taste, though.  I may cut the sugar back a bit next time. Curious that the recipe doesn't call for eggs, which may appeal to certain folk, but which made for a somewhat less "rich" taste.

This recipe is terrific. The cornbread is sweet and moist. From now on, this is the only cornbread I will make.
