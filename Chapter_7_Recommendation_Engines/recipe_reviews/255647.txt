I used the ingredient search to find a soup that used a butternut squash and leeks. This fit the bill nicely. I roasted the squash in the oven and added that to the sauteed leeks. I also added: 1 teaspoon of cumin, 1 teaspoon of tumeric, 1 teaspoon of coriander, 1/2 teaspoon of ginger powder, and 2 teaspoons of curry powder. I omitted the sugar. Delicious!
