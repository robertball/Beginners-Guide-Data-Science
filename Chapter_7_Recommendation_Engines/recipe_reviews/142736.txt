It has potential, I would probably make it again, but I would use a larger dish.  I used a loaf pan, and probably cooked it for over 10 min.  I wouldd also try baking it in the oven.  The raw batter tasted terrible but after it cooked it tasted good.

This smelled better than it tasted, although for coming out of the microwave I'm not sure you could expect anything else. The texture was a little rubbery, and I left it in the microwave for 4 minutes. The insides were very moist but not raw. It was interesting but I wouldn't ever make it again.

The bread is really easy to make and moist. I microwaved it for 4 minutes total in a round pyrex dish and the center is a little gooey while the rest was perfect.
