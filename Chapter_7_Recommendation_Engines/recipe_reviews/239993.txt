Amazing!! I didn't clarify the butter. I preheated the oven at 475 with my pan in there. When the pan was hot I put the butter into my pan in the oven and let it melt and heat up. I turned the oven down to 425 poured the batter into the preheated pan with the melted butter and let it cooked for 20 min. Perfection it came out looking amazing and deflates in about 3 minutes :( but the taste is unique and super good. I will be making this again and again. Next time I am going to try a savory one.

I have made these in muffin tins. Spray muffin pan with Pam.  Add butter to each muffin.  Pour batter, evenly divided into muffin pan.  Bake in preheated 425 degree oven for about 15 minutes or until puffed and golden.  Serve immediately with honey, syrup or jam. I make batter night before, pour into Tupperware water pitcher (makes pouring into each muffin tin much easier) and refrigerate.  Don't open oven door to check as they are baking, use your oven light to watch them puff up. My ingredients are a little different.....I use 1 cup flour, 1 cup milk, 4 eggs and 1/4 tsp. salt.  I make 12 muffins.  Will try John's recipe in my muffin tin....like the addition of vanilla.  I serve them with bacon when my family is visiting.

I’ve made this German Pancake recipe for years.  My recipe calls for 1/2 cup milk instead of 2/3 cup; I use 1 tsp. vanilla instead of 1/4 tsp.; and I bake it at 400°, but will try these suggested variations.  I like lots more lemon than suggested; the last time I made it I added 1 tsp. lemon zest to the batter, and next time I’ll add more.  As far as this recipe serving four, I eat this entire pancake by myself and use the juice of at least two lemons.  

The German word for German is “deutsch,” which was corrupted into English as “Dutch,” and thus mistakenly interpreted as referring to Holland.  (The equally misinterpreted “Pennsylvania Dutch” are of German ancestry).  So this is a “deutsch pancake,” meaning a German Pancake (note the reviewer who mentions Bavaria).  The term “Dutch Baby” usually refers to a smaller individual serving (such as a muffin tin size) of this German Pancake instead of to an entire skillet full.

I rated this only 3 stars because, while the ingredients are right, the directions are not correct-- if you want your pancake to puff up correctly. With quite a bit of trial and error, here is what you need to get a nice big puff:

Warm the eggs-- they need to be room temp. I place refrigerated eggs into warm water for about half an hour.

Warm the milk-- I nuke it for about 45 seconds. Not enough to cook the eggs, but a bit more than room temp. 

Mixing-- I use a hand mixer. Perhaps a blender will work, but you need to really mix it in a specific way. First, whip the eggs well. Slowly add the milk, again ensuring that the mixture is well whipped. Add the vanilla, then slowly add the flour. The goal is for the batter to be as airy as possible. 

Baking-- I warm the cast iron pan for a few minutes, allow the butter to melt, swirl it around, then pour the batter in. 

With these steps, I get puffs of around 6 inches, which really makes the pancake. Enjoy!

Try with sautéed apples and cinnamon cooked in the skillet before adding the batter and then serve it upside down--this makes a very custardy texture with the apples as topping. Mmmmm.

Very much like my recipe for German Omelette as it was called way back when.  It's an absolute family favourite and we have it for lunch of breakfast, even sometimes a quick supper!  Mine I an double or triple.  For each beten egg, I use 1Tbsp. flour and 2 Tbsp. milk.  Sometimes I top it with peeled, chopped apples that have been cooked in butter, about 1Tbsp. rasins that I've plumped a bit in hot water and drained and about 1 Tbs. sugar, some cinnamon, nutmeg and a bit of ground cloves.  I prepare this while the "omelette" is in the oven.  Don't overcook the apple mixture, they should retain their shape and just be getting soft and nicely glazed with the butter, sugar and spice mixture.   You could use dried cranberries  or other dried fruit instead of raisins.  Yum!

This is a great recipe, quick and delicious.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a big 9X13" pan (no, I didn't clarify the butter, just preheated the pan at 475, added butter and turned down to 425, like a previous reviewer).  BUT next time I'll try the opposite -- bake the recipe in a muffin tin, sprinkle on the lemon and sugar and fill with fruit salad topped with yoghurt/whipped cream.  Voila, super simple and stunning holiday breakfast!
Update: these are awesome baked in muffin tins - just remember they are done in about 1/2 the time.

This is also a forgiving recipe: the eggs and milk weren't at room temp, the butter not clarified -- and they still turned out puffy, with just the right eggy texture -- sort of like the inside of a crueller.

So easy, and so scrumptious!  Made exactly as written with the exception of the lemon juice...(I used the last of the lemons for some yummy cocktails last night!).   I devoured my portion with Montana huckleberry syrup; my bride and my son had theirs with good old maple syrup.  Delightful... I'll make it many times hence.  Chef John, you've done it yet again!  A tip of my camo hat to you!  (My 17-year-old just came into the room and said five words:  "Dad, Dutch babies are amazing."  Enough said.)

Got to give you an "Attaboy" on this one. Never heard of these things.  Cooked it for the crew in the oil patch. Disappeared in 30 seconds flat.  "Make some more" was their comment.  That's high praise around here. Opened a can of stewed apples for the second one. I thought they were going to bite my fingers. It's rare to please everybody but this comes close.  The oil patch likes it.

I absolutely loved this! It was my first time ever eating or making a Dutch baby and it came out great. Like another reviewer did, I didn't separate my butter and ended up heating my skillet in the oven first at 475 and then turned it down to 425 when I put my butter in. My new favorite breakfast food!

4 days in a row. Almost a week ago I decided to test drive this recipe to see if it would be good for Christmas morning. It was a hit. I made it exactly as the directions say. It's easy & not much clean up. My husband and son have asked for it every morning since I first tried it. Now I'm worried they're going to be sick of it by Christmas and I'll have to find something else to make!

This has to be the easiest, best tasting breakfast deserts ever.  Follow the directions exactly, including room tempurature milk and eggs, very important.  I like to put the eggs in a bowl of tap-hot water for about 5 minutes which brings them to room temp, and you can also microwave the milk for 10 to 20 seconds   It seems to me a bit like French cooking or at least French method as I watched the "baby" get bigger and bigger.

We loved this recipe!! I put my cast iron skillet on 475 degrees added the tbs butter (I didn't clarify ) sautied a thinly cut Apple sprinkled with cinnamon sugar in the butter until Carmelized then removed the apples turned the heat down to 425 and let it finish preheating. From there I followed the directions as written . When out of the oven I topped with the 1tbs melted butter and carmelized Apples . Wow ! We kept trying to describe it . French toast custart slightly. Whatever it is it's delicious !!

I make these often, delicious!  Serve topped with  fresh fruit ...strawberries, raspberries, or blueberries.  Or sautéed apples and raisins.    Some people enjoy maple syrup, we do not.  It is my go to Company breakfast - I invested in 6 small cast iron skillets, and everyone gets their own!  A favorite family breakfast on the weekend - so easy.  I don't clarify the butter - an unnecessary step.  Lemon and confectioner's sugar is critical!  Kids love to peek through the oven window and watch it "puff".

I've had a Dutch Baby recipe for 25 years. It has been and continues to be a favorite with my kids and grandkids.  Mine is much simpler-for 2 people, whip 3 eggs in the blender; continue blending and add 3/4 cup of milk and 3/4 cup of flour; blend another minute.  Melt 1/4 cup of butter in pan at 425 degrees; pour in mixture and bake for 20 minutes. Top with lemon and powdered sugar (or fresh fruit).  Secret: For each egg, use 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of flour. Never tried it with vanilla; will next time.   C. Everroad

I made this according to recipe this morning, and my family loved it.  The video was very helpful, and I look forward to experimenting with cinnamon and whatever else comes to mind when I make this in the future, as suggested by Chef John in the video.

Kinda like a pancake, Kinda like a crepe, Kinda Wonderful!  I was looking for something kinda different for a brunch item and this is just perfect. I didn't have cast iron but used my oven proof Farberware stainless skillet. I added just a sprinkle of nutmeg and cinnamon to the egg mixture.  I did not clarify the butter but melted it in the skillet stove top until it was very hot....just a slight color change but not browned. Popped the whole thing in the pre-heated oven.....No peeking, just check at 21 minuets. I liked the finished product well done for crispness, approx. 24 -25 min.  I severed it dusted with powdered sugar along with real maple syrup. I will definitely make this again. Topping choices are endless fresh fruit compote, fruit preserves.....

An unusual breakfast dish, but quite simple to make and tasty.  I thought the amount of lemon juice would be too much, but it was great with all of it.  The extra butter on top is optional, in my opinion.

What a great find!  Snowed in so the simple ingredients were a big plus.  After getting the eggs and milk in the blender I realized I didn't have powdered sugar (and then discovered the kids had eaten all the vanilla ice cream) so I opted to make some changes on the fly.  I upped the butter to 4 tbsp and, following other reviewers, melted it in a heavy earthenware pie pan in the oven as it preheated to 475 degrees.  I added a dash of nutmeg to the batter and then pealed and thinly sliced an apple.  When preheated I removed the pie pan, reduced the oven to 425 degrees, layered the apples on the bottom of the pan, generously sprinkled ground cinnamon and a tbsp or so of granulated sugar on the apples, poured the batter on top and baked for 20 minutes.  It rose beautifully but was disappointed that the apple slices floated to the top.  The flavor was great - just sweet and buttery enough that I didn't need to add anything to it.  If you are fortunate enough to have leftovers just snack on it (cold) in the afternoon.  Yummy!

This taste just like a popover simply delicious. So much easier then a popover and not little dishes to clean. Awesome would not change a thing. I learned how and what clarify butter is. That wasn't hard to do. I Made extra clarify butter so next time this will be easier. Put cinnamon ans sugar on it my son dipped in syrup. Just awesome

Wonderful recipe. I added a teaspoon of powdered sugar to the recipe which gave the DBs a subtle sweetness and I was lighter on the dusting of powdered sugar. Also when adding the batter to the pan, I poured the batter in slowly to allow more bubbling, browning action to occur. When all the batter was poured in, I left the pan on the stove for about 10 seconds before popping it into the oven.

Delicious pancake originally made by the Pennsylvania Dutch people who settled in Eastern Pennsylvania.  In the 1700s they came from a part of Germany which was known as Deutchland.

These turned out perfect the first try. Tried a savory style. They were great too. (Shallots, cheddar, zucchini and squash- yum). Even my husband loved them. Not too sweet light slightly sweet and incredibly delicious!  Thanks chef John

My husband and I loved this! I doubled it and between the two of us we ate almost all of it. I baked it in a glass dish. I didn't do the clarified butter and I added some cinnamon and doubled the vanilla. We used lots of lemon on ours.

I have tried this multiple times and it was great every time. Depending on how you like it, you might want to add more lemon. What we have done before is make mini ones and one big one. It is amazing how this recipe tastes so sweet but the base is healthy. ( Eggs. )

I've been eating this since I was a kid. We called it "Pop-Over Pancakes". My mom taught me to place a GLASS PIE PLATE into the hot oven with the butter in it (watch the oven to make sure you don't burn the butter). When the dish is hot pour batter immediately into hot dish. Bake. My kids like to turn on oven light to see it "pop over" (don't open oven door until finished!) A cast iron skillet is best (it tends to stick to glass, and doesn't bake as well in a metal pan).
WANT YORKSHIRE PUDDING to go with your roast beef dinner? Make as directed without the vanilla in a muffin pan...voila!

I have made this recipe many times and it has always turned out fluffy and delicious, thank you Chef John! I saw one reviewer say that you have to do a number of special steps to get this baby fluffy. The only "special steps" I do is to beat the eggs separately for 10 seconds or so, then beat the entire mix about 20 seconds or so after I get the flour mixed in so it doesn't fly all over the counter. I don't like dirtying more dishes than I need to and the whole recipe is so easy, I always use a handwhisk, because why dirty an entire blender for a 2 minute job? I don't have a cast iron pan, so I usually use either a cake pan or a Corningware dish, stick it in the oven while it is heating up, then through in some butter once everything is hot. Basically as long as you actually beat the mix so it isn't lumpy and you can see some small air bubbles when you are done, this thing will turn out fluffy bo matter what tools you use. Beat, bake, and enjoy!

Made this a while back and it was great! Followed recipe exactly though added apple pie filling on top while still warm. Disappeared quickly. It was delish! Making again right now. Not looking as pretty as the first one but there's still time. I'm adding fried plantains to it this time also!  Fingers crossed. Thanks for sharing this tasty little gem!
Update: It came out perfectly!  I doubled the recipe this time so I was nervous, but it was great. This recipe is very forgiving. Topped with the fried plantains and powdered sugar and it was out of this world!

It is fabulous.  I used to do pancakes or waffles on the weekends and now only Dutch Babies.  

This is the ultimate appetizer dessert or a savory main dish with shitake mushrooms, spinach, blue cheese or fontina cheese, roasted cherry tomatoes halved, extra virgin olive oil, fresh lemon juice and lots  of fresh basil!!  There are o many combinations to choose from.  For the kids definitely the original Dutch Babies but for grownups the savory side with a nice bottle of the wine of their choice.  I'm a white wine person only (unless cooking with red) and I love Santa Margarita Pinot Grigio or Muir Wood Chardonnay year  2013 only.

I cut the recipe down to 2/3 for a 6 1/2" cast iron skillet (and 2 eggs) and one person. I loved the lemony custardy creamy and crispy eggy combination of this dish.  I usually like savory over sweet, yet I wanted to do this as written before making any changes.  The other reviews really give good ideas to run with this.  Thanks for the muffin pan idea; That will make for easy individual servings at the cabin this summer when the extended family  is waking up.  Great recipe.  Thanks all.

I made this today and it came out with a perfect creamy lemon custard filling! I added one packet of Splenda to my batter just to offset the tart of the lemon! I also don't think it's necessary to go through the exercise of clarifying the butter.  Also I did not have a cast iron pan so I used a enameled covered Dutch oven cast-iron pan instead and it worked great!

I bought a cast iron skillet just so I could make this recipe!  It is easy and delicious.  I did not use clarified butter and omit the salt because I used salted butter.  Despite mixing with a scraper, there was about 1.5 TB of flour left in the blender when I poured the batter.  This didn't seem to affect the outcome of the Baby.  *TIP:  to bring eggs to room temp faster, I placed them in very warm but not hot water for 8 min.   I also zapped the milk for >20 seconds in the microwave.

I had German Pancake many years ago in a famous German Restaurant in Chicago. It was served folded over sliced apples that had been sauteed in butter and brown sugar, with butter and confectioners' sugar drizzled on top. Superb! I've not had it with the lemon juice...want to try that!

This is my all time favorite breakfast I love to make it for company. Besides being yummy the where are you it puffs up is gorgeous and elegant. Make sure you get it to the table pronto it doesn't stay puffed up after it comes out of the oven for very long. I hope you enjoy it as much as me and my family have.

To posipat, it says at the top of the recipe to preheat oven to 425.  

I've been making this for years.  It is wonderful with savory toppings as well. When done, bush with butter then sprinkle with garlic powder and freshly grated parmesan and serve along side a soup or stew.  Wonderful!

I followed the recipe exactly. Easy, DELICIOUS.  Don.t skip the butter, lemon juice and sugar at the end. It had a nicer shape in the cast iron skillet than in an 9 x 9 glass pan, but both worked.

These are wonderful!  I had to buy a cast iron skillet as I have an induction cooktop stove but it was well worth it.  I followed Chef John's recipe exactly and my husband and I loved them!!! So easy to make and such a tasty treat!  My daughter-in-law whips these up for snacks or breakfast in no time and now I might do that as well.  I suspect they are very fattening but once in a while will be ok.  Thanks Chef John!!!

I love the variations in this recipe. My recipe, I have always used is a bit different, in order to feed the whole family.  So of course its doubled & I usually add a bit more sugar, and also cinnamon plus a splash of maple. I hadn't  used the lemon before. Its always fun to try it in a new direction. Thanks!   =)

Just made this wonderful, super easy dish today.  I substituted gluten free flour but used everything else...shear perfection!!  I think next time I might skip the sweet and go with a savory angle. Maybe a little gruyere?   Try it, you can't miss.

Fantastic ~ and NO sugar except a little powered sugar at the end of baking!!  Going to take a look at other Chef John's recipes.  It turned out so pretty that I actually sent iPhone pic to my grandkids telling them I'll be baking this for them when they come home for the holidays ~

Ive made this twice so far. The 1st time I followed the recipe exactly. The 2nd time I used a portable mixer instead of a blender and melted the butter in the microwave instead of clarifying it. I really enjoyed it both ways and I'll make it often.

Since I didn't use clarified butter, it didn't rise quite as much as I'd hoped, but that was completely my fault, not the recipe. As written, it was easy, very delicious, and a nice addition to my recipe rotation. Hubby loved it, too, and it's surprisingly low cal, considering. Served it with fresh fruit and turkey bacon.

I’m not a fan of pancakes, but my wife and kids are. So I saw a friends on Insta had made this awesome looking ‘breaky with these Dutch boys. 
Wanted to use my cast iron pan and nobody else was getting off their lazy Sunday arses so I thought I’d give this one a whirl. 
I did the same as another reviewer; I had no clarified butter so heated pan in oven up to 475 and took out added butter and the batter and then back into the 425 oven. 
It turned out phenomenal! Whole family raves and now it’s going to be a request every time.

Marvelous!
I made this today for the first time.   My husband is a maple syrup lover but I convinced him to try the original lemon.   W both LOVED it.  I think I could have eaten it by myself.

I doubled the recipe, because I was visiting my grandchildren for the weekend and it’s their favorite breakfast food. I took the 2  glass Pyrex dishes out of the oven, they both had that perfect puff going on and the smell was amazing! I set them down on the stove grates side by side admiring then when all of a sudden, one dish exploded and glass spread all over the kitchen, including the second pan. Sooo, while I didn’t taste them, I knew from previous times making Dutch Babies that this recipe was going to be awesome. I will try it again , but I won’t use a glass baking dish. LOL

My husband Jack tried this recipe and followed the suggestion of one of the reviewers to use a muffin tin. They turned out wonderful and the grandkids ask for them every time we visit. We serve them with Nutella, bananas, warmed apple pie filling along with the traditional strawberry style. DELICIOUS!

I absolutely love these.  I follow the variation pre-heating the cast iron skillet in the oven, then melting the butter in before adding the batter. I cut back on the butter some, with no ill effects. Great sweet and Savory. I've served with chicken in tarragon cream sauce to rave reviews.

I can’t tolerate gluten well, but have found Einkorn is tolerable.  So I made it with Einkorn wheat, a bit nervous, but it was delicious!

I love these! We have made these 3 or 4 times, for dinner.  I didn’t have any lemons (the tree isn’t ripe yet) and I missed them, but one of us used real maple syrup and I just used the powdered sugar. We will make them again!

I used almond milk.  Easier to make than pancakes and is a good substitute.

Make sure you watch the video to learn how to quickly bring the eggs to room temperature. Wish I had. It would have saved me about 40 minutes. Chef John’s version has a more “egg” taste which is delicious.  I did not do the butter, lemon, sugar topping but served with fresh berries and maple syrup. I also put the cast iron pan in the oven while it was preheating. Saves you the step of having to heat it on the stovetop.

I made this basically as is (I used sweet cream butter, warmed milk for 30 sec and only needed about 15 minutes in the oven) and a fresh cherry sauce to go with and it was absolutely delicious!! My son approved as well. Will make again. Thank you.

My husband is diabetic and this has become our go to recipe.  I make up the batter and pour it into the melted butter in my cast iron skillet.  That's where the changes have begun.  For brunch I blend 4-6 oz. softened cream cheese with roasted green chilies, dash of cumin, salt & pepper. Blend this up first so it's ready to put on the batter as soon as it's in the pan. Just put clumps around the pan. It bakes for 23 minutes but don't expect it to puff as much.

You can use this (without the vanilla) as a base for deep dish pizza. Pour the batter then spoon some pizza or marinara sauce into the batter (not too much) add toppings, mushrooms, peppers, pepperoni, what ever you want and cheese.  Bake 20-25 min. it  won't puff as much but is delicious and a low carb alternative when  you just have to have pizza.

Love it.  Only changes I did was used 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and added 1/8 teaspoon of ground nutmeg.  I did not have any lemon juice, but I did have lemon curd instead.

Melted 3 TBSP of butter in skillet while oven warmed at 425.  Blended ingredients and poured in and baked for 20 min.  Perfect.  Half is perfect.  Did a quarter with cinnamon/sugar and a quarter with Nutella and strawberry.

Delicious! I omit the butter, lemon juice and powdered sugar topping. The first time I made this, I put apple rings dipped in sugar and cinnamon in the pan before pouring in the batter and topped the baked pancake with powdered sugar. Today I topped it with chunks of brie, chopped walnuts and a drizzle of honey.

Super easy and I get weekly requests for it! I only have a 12" cast iron pan, but both the listed amounts, or one egg + a small amount more of the others works too (i've tried it both ways), i also used coconut oil instead of butter. I got my husband to request something with lemon on it, which is unbelievable!

It turned out great! In fact I make it like every other weekend for my family and whenever we have a brunch with friends or family... And they all love it! I normally just use 2-4 tablespoons of normal butter and it turns out fine. With some maple syrup and powder sugar it is so good just right out of the pan!

Have made this a few times. Only change is that I use ghee now instead of clarifying my own butter. Have also made larger version with 4 eggs  and 1 cup milk.
I also let the pan and ghee heat up in the oven not on the stove- you just have to carefully slide the shelf out, pour the batter in and carefully push shelf in again. 
Pix are: 3 egg versions in each of two 8-9 inch cast iron skillets and then 3 egg version in 10 inch skillet - one with added cooked apples . 
This recipe finally cracked the code for me on how to make popovers- just make sure the pan is in the oven at temperature BEFORE adding the batter.

Very easy and delicious.  Didn't do the lemon, just butter and a little powdered sugar.  My husband loved it too.  Also tried a little black raspberry jam on it.  Followed recipe as written to cook and it puffed beautifully in the oven.

Just made this for the second time. First time exactly per the recipe and instructions, and it was delicious. Second time I adjusted per other reviewers - brought eggs and milk to room temperature. Using a blender, whipped the eggs until creamy and fluffy, added milk slowly. Increased vanilla to 1tsp., added 2 tsp sugar. I melted butter in 10"x10" ovenproof glass dish. Mixture rose so high it touched the elements on roof of my oven. Even more delicious! Next time it will go lower in the oven, and I'll omit the sugar as it was a bit too sweet. Hubby just loves this, so it's a keeper! So easy and a lot less carbs than regular pancakes.

Followed another reviewer's suggestion by using a hand mixer to first mix/aerate the eggs, then the milk, then vanilla, and finally the dry ingredients. Threw some diced apple and cinnamon in the cast iron with the clarified butter. This was really good, but we felt it was heavy. Delicious, but definitely a rare treat!

Chef John you are the bomb!  I am a pre-diabetic and always looking for something that will satisfy my sweet tooth and not compromise my health.  This recipe does exactly that!  I took the advice of another person and I carmelized my apples, while my oven was heating.  Then I poured the batter over that and baked.  It was delicious!  the only change of ingredient that I made was instead of milk, I used water and butter substitution, per substitution guidelines, and it was delicious.  Even my husband, who is a potatoes and egg type of guy loved it!  I will definitely make this again!

Super yummy. 
Super elegant. 

Thank you, Chef John!

(I can't use my cast iron on my glass cooktop, so I just preheated it in the oven.)

I didn't clarify the butter, who has time for that at 5 am? Just heated an iron skillet in the oven and threw in 3 TBLS of butter to melt. Once melted I poured in the batter. I did make sure the milk and eggs were room temperature by putting eggs in hot tap water for a couple minutes and milk in the microwave for a few seconds. Turned out great! Very photographic results and rose about 6 or 7 inches. I bet this would be good with 1/4 cup cocoa powder (reducing flour to 1/3 cup), and 1/4 cup of sugar too, maybe I'll try a chocolate version next.

A nice version. I doubled the recipe and divided it between a heated cast iron skillet and 8-Inch square Pyrex baking dish that I heated with the butter in the oven.  The half baked in the skillet rose more dramatically than in the baking dish, but the centers both flattened out in the end.  I measured the "packed" flour by tapping the cup compress the flour, but this goes against my ingrained need to measure flour in the standard way, so I would just measure 2/3 cup of stirred, lightly spooned flour next time for the same result. The double recipe served 3 adults and three children at my house, the children and my husband all delighted there was enough left for  small seconds.

My grands didn't like it. I ate there's. On second one I cooked at 475. It puffed up better.

Wonderful and foolproof. I often add cinnamon and don’t brush it with butter due to laziness. I also add some regular white sugar to the batter( maybe a teaspoon). I always make a double batch in a larger pan, same cooking time.

These are always a big hit at my house. Last minute decided to make these for Christmas breakfast so had to make substitution in one batch - used half almond milk instead of all milk since I ran out of milk and made in skillet instead of Dutch oven. The almond milk skillet version was the favorite- less custard-y and thinner. So far all Chef John recipes I’ve made have been winners. (Thanks Chef John) Happy Holidays!

So much fun to take out of the oven!  I have never used lemon juice.  Also I just only do a vague attempt to clarify the butter by spooning off the foaming layer after microwaving it.  Seems to work well enough.  Also tastes great with cinnamon sugar!  Thanks Chef John!

Delicious!   Did not need quite so much butter in the pan. Puffed up beautifully.  Great results for little effort. Topped with home grown blackberries.  Did not last long here!

I’ve never made a Dutch Baby before and this was super easy! As others said, I didn’t have clarified butter (will make for future use) so I preheated cast iron skillet at 475 and put butter in pan and then swirled it around to melt it. I then reduced oven to 425. Other than that, I followed the directions exactly (even with the blender...that was awesome). Well, not exactly. I realized I had no powdered sugar so I made a cinnamon and sugar mixture and sprinkled that on top. It was delicious. I will be making this quite often!!!

I didn't clarify the butter and I should have. The lemon made it tangy and my guests loved it. It was gone in 2 minutes!! Thank you!

This recipe is So easy and wonderful! Five minute prep, twenty minutes in the oven and you're done! The lemon pairs perfectly with the powdered sugar and the texture is superb. I have five daughters and they couldn't stop asking for more :)

I made this as Emily Reubush suggested. Whipped the room temp. eggs, then the milk(also at room temp), added vanilla, salt and slowly incorporated the flour. It turned out great. The only change I made to the ingredients list was that I did opt to add a bit more vanilla and I did not clarify the butter. Just baked at 425 for 25 minutes and sprinkled with confectioners sugar. Instead of syrup we used raspberries that I had soaking in sugar this morning. It was a hit with the hubby, he still required a bit of maple syrup... he will add maple syrup to every dish if I would let him though! :)

My German grandmother used to make this all the time when we were kids. I’ve tried using her recipe many many times over the years. The results have never been this good. Her recipe is fantastic, but Chef John’s process was the game-changer. The details matter and clearly I never knew the details. Thank you Chef John for the video!  You’ve provided me with the ability t relive and enjoy a great childhood memory.

It raised and looked perfect until I took it out of the oven. It deflated and tasted mostly of eggs. I live in a high altitude so perhaps that was the downfall of it.

I’ve used this recipe so many times now, I’ve commuted it to memory. Super equal to make, and guaranteed to be devoured almost instantly. The lemon in the recipe gives this such a wonderful taste.

Followed recipe exactly. Cooke for 20 minutes. Was delicious, cooked perfectly. Everyone loved it. Next time I will increase the milk by a tablespoon in hopes that it will hit the sides of the pan and form a bowl shape.

Super straightforward and easy. Only change I made was not using clarified butter in the pan as all I had was regular butter. Regardless of the change, the Dutch baby turned out perfectly and was a huge hit with my family. Solid recipe!!

I love this recipe. I make this once a week at least. I usually will have a piece for breakfast and find it keeps well in the fridge for a couple of days. Impossible to go back to cereal or oatmeal after this, especially since its so easy! I use the microwave to bring eggs and milk to room temp. A clear keeper!!

The only change I made was a squeeze of fresh lemon juice over the top and sprinkled with fresh blueberries, we spread some lemon curd over the top. This was the first time I made a Dutch Baby, oh my goodness... simple and SO delicious! This will definitely be added to our weekend breakfast rotation. Thank you Chef John.

2 for 2 with this recipe.  Decided to brown a Red Delicious sliced apple in butter, added batter supplemented with approx 1t ground cinnamon, 1/2 t nutmeg, 2t vanilla.     Added about 1.5T butter to apple mix before adding batter.  Let mix sit on hot burner for about 30 sec, then into oven for 20 mins.  Added about 3 mins on convection cook to brown top.  Kids ate it all!

I dont give 5 stars lightly.  
I like how my kids are getting a good serving of protein from the eggs.  The whole family likes these and you can put all kids of toppings on besides powdered sugar/lemon.  These are very easy to make and you can get ready for your day while it cooks.

I have made this recipe many times. I have a larger cast iron pan so the only change I make is to double the recipe. I don't change the cook time or heat and it has finished perfect every time! It is so easy... hardest part is lifting and placing the larger pan into the oven!

Such a simple and delicious recipe. We forego the lemon juice. I prefer mine with just powdered sugar. My other half likes to add some maple syrup. Either way, you should try this recipe  at least once. If you do not have a cast iron pan, I’ve made these in a square or round baking pan.  Works just as well!!!

I increased the vanilla to 1/2 teaspoon and added 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter. Serving this with lemon and confectioners' sugar is just divine!! I also served it with sautéed apples, but it's delicious without additional toppings. Will definitely make this again and again!!

Great recipe. Super easy.  I added about 2 Tbsp. of butter to the batter.  I baked these in a jumbo muffin pan for about 12 minutes at 425°, and they stayed nice and puffy.

Very tasty!

I made it once as written, and it was very easy and delicious... but my wife and I were still very hungry afterwards.

The second time, I made the monster.... 15" cast iron pan, ingredients scaled up 2.25x. (or so, I rounded up to the next egg).  Ended up with a huge, beautiful creation, and we couldn't finish it all.   Tried to take a picture, but my phone wasn't cooperative.

This is sooooo good. I’ve made one 4 morning in a row now. The 1st one, I followed the advice of another reviewer and sautéed some apples and poured the batter on top of them before cooking it. It was good, but I added the butter, lemon and powdered sugar to a piece of that and knew that the lemon version was far superior. The rest of them, I basically followed the directions except that I add a few tablespoons of sugar to the batter, did not clarify the butter and added a little extra vanilla (because I love vanilla). I can’t even describe how good these are with the butter, lemon and powdered sugar. Good enough that I got up early workday to make myself one this morning.

Made it this morning for NYE breakfast. Since I had five eggs available, I followed another reviewer’s advice and used 1/4 c milk and 1/4 c flour per egg and cooked it in a Pyrex casserole. (Used the full oven method). Turned out great. Cooked it 25 minutes, should have taken it out a little sooner as I like it a little less browned and more custardy. Also I had no lemons, so I put some clementine zest into the batter and some juice over the top. Everyone was happy!

This was delicious. I recognized this dish although I can't recall where or when I had it. But as soon as I saw it I knew what was for dinner. I followed the recipe except for the clarified butter, because I didn't have any. I used regular butter but next time I will use unsalted as there were a few spots where the butter pooled and was a bit saltier.

Loved it.  Followed the recipe exactly and didn't find any room for improvement.  Be sure to warm your eggs and milk.
I like these better than regular pancakes for the decrease in carbs.

First time making these. Super easy. The rise was awesome, but as soon as I pulled it out of the oven, the rise in the center of the dutch baby started falling. I don't know what I did wrong or if this is the way it is. I heated my iron skillet in the oven while it was preheating and getting the mix together.  I clarified my butter, by melting my butter on low so it wouldn't burn and then removing the white layer on top - easy. I can see where fruit would be a great addition to this.

Aww, &$@%#! These are delicious!! My guys scarfed the first one. So I made a double batch with lunch which  was gone just as fast. I added a few dashes each of nutmeg and allspice . I also added 1/4c sugar to the double batch. As an experiment, I used tortilla molds which are used to bake taco salad bowls... turned out cute.  I used a ladle-full of batter in each mold. The molds Required baking only 12 minutes . Delish!! Thanks again Chef John!!

Delicious! We’ve been making these for years under the name German puffy pancake.  My fam loves them and I never can make enough. Our latest venture with this Deutsch Baby(thank you for the history Charlene!) is to add bacon w the Apple. Bacon!!!! How can you go wrong?? Oh... I need to make more!

Awesome! Added some cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. Used a deep cast fry pan for a crispier edge. I’m totally going to try this at elk camp next year in a Dutch oven.

Loved this recipe, first time making Dutch babies, made exactly as recipe with the exception of adding more vanilla. Nice and custard-y, with puffy crisp edges. Squeezed juice from a whole lemon, half as recipe called and the other half so I could add more if needed, which I did end up sprinkling extra, which other reviewers recommended.

Very good.  I prepared a single serving but adjusted the ingredients slightly to accommodate the whole egg by increasing the flour and milk slightly.  Personally, I don't care for the lemon juice on the pancake but maybe if  Meyer lemons were available here it might be different. I've also made this with a sprinkling  of cheddar just before it goes in the oven.  I think I enjoy it even more that way.  Thanks, Chef John.

Great recipe! My husband loved it. We don't eat gluten so I used gluten free 1 to 1 flour. I also used the suggestion for sauteed apples and added cinnamon sugar and walnuts. Will definitely make this again!!!

When I saw this recipe I knew I had to try it. I had dutch baby at Seller's for mother's day. I thought it was good but it was kind of soggy. I pretty much followed the recipe. It turned out so good, much better than the restaurant version. It was crunchy on the edges with a slight salty taste. I ate it with jelly and it was perfect. It is great for breakfast, lunch or dinner.

Loved this!  So easy when you need to make breakfast for several people.  We used skim milk, whole wheat pastry flour, doubled the recipe and made it in my paella pan.   Topped with fresh blue berries and powdered sugar.  PERFECT!!!

The trickiest aspect to this recipe is the clarified butter.  Although I watched an instructional video on how to do it, the first batch did not turn out correctly and I then decided to take a larger amount of butter (about 6 tbsps) to attempt to clarify then use what I needed.  I don't think I really got it correct in the end as the butter was splattering like crazy when I tried to heat the cast iron skillet.  All calmed down when I poured the batter and my dutch baby still baked up wonderfully.

My grandmother used to make these for me. Never had a Dutch oven to make for my family so it was the first item on my wedding registry. So today almost a year after wedding I made one and hubby loved it. I too did not use clarified butter. As a matter of fact I accidentally browned the butter a bit but it gave it a richer buttery flavor. Next time I will experiment with some variations/additions and see how that turns out. I am so glad I found this recipe and I will be making it again!

I made this today. I don't have a cast iron skillet so I used my glass pie plate. I think everyone changes this recipe to suit their tastes. I usually add a bit of sugar instead of salt. I most always  top them with strawberries. I found the recipe in a cookbook about 15  years ago or  and it was a specialty dessert for a restaurant in Wolfville, Nova Scotia.

I love Dutch Babies, have them often at the restaurant.  So, I made these today - in a muffin pan (made 6 large ones).  Fluffed up nicely, but they were thicker than expected - I guess because of the muffin pan.  I found them a little bland though, even with powdered sugar and lemon juice (and a little too eggy).  I found another recipe almost identical, but it has a little sugar in it.  I might need to tweek with a little added sugar to the mixture to see if it makes it less bland.  And I will try in a large pan to see if that helps with the eggy texture (probably).  Otherwise, it's a very forgiving recipe and so simple to make!  I will definitely be experimenting with it quite often.  I also froze 2 of the muffin size ones to see how they do.  Will update after a little experimenting.

Never heard of a Dutch baby before until I tried a different recipe a week ago and it was terrible; very dense.  I was reluctant to try this and glad I did. This recipe was very different, fluffy, lite almost soufflé like. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla & skipped the lemon as I was serving it to kids (ages 6,4 & 1), they ate the entire thing in utter silence stutter "ummmm". I served it topped with a little whipped cream & fresh berries. Definitely will be making again! TY Chef. John!

Easy to make, impressive and unique (relative to "normal" breakfast offerings), and delicious. I followed the recipe but didn't take too much care in preciseness. Added some more vanilla than it suggested. Worst part of the recipe was clarifying the butter. I had not done that before and it was a pain. But once that was done it was super easy. I made a second one immediately, this time adding chocolate chips to the batter. It was awesome. I'd make that again first.

Added non clarified butter to preheated cast iron skillet in the oven to melt till it bubbled. Cooked 20 minutes. It went up the sides like a bowl. Then puffed in the middle. It did have a custard texture in the middle. Very light bread texture on the sides. Sprinkled with lemon juice, cinnamon sugar and topped with strawberries. WOW!!!! So light and tasty.

These were very good & I plan to make them again as fruit and savory versions.  I didn't clarify the butter, so I used 5 Tbsps. I also did not have time to bring the eggs & milk to room temperature. They still tasted wonderful. I would say that if you like lemon, add more than the recipe suggests.  Thank you Chef John.

This is fabulous! Only change was I added a couple of teaspoons of cinnamon sugar as I didn't have vanilla.  Definitely buying vanilla for next time.  Have also researched savory Dutch babies and can't wait to experiment!

Easy and YUMMY!!  My new go to recipe for easy, light breakfast or even desert.  Next time I make this it will be desert with fruit.  Delicious!

I, like others, didn't bother to clarify the butter and it came out great, crispy and light on the bottom.  The powdered sugar and lemon juice was a nice flavor enhancer but it's good without as well.

I love this dish. Made Chef John's Dutch baby for the first time today. I was fortunate enough to have a huge Meyer lemon that some friends had given me from their backyard tree. The Meyer lemon gives it such a wonderful flavor. If you can get one I I'mstrongly recommend you use it. I really enjoyed this not too sweet pancake. It had just the right amount of sweetness and tartness to go with the rich creamy eggy base.  I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty, had a lot of pouf! I made it exactly to the recipe, but used pastry flour.  Mine was done in 20 minutes. I used a stoneware pie pan (worked great!) since I don't have the type of pan mentioned in the recipe. Next time I will use cinnamon in place of the lemon juice.

Oh man, this recipe has ruined pancakes for me. The texture and flavor of the dutch baby is so much more complex. 

You may wish to serve lemon wedges on the side instead of pouring the juice on top. The juice can ruin the appearance of the top, and can be a little overwhelming as a flavor.

This turned out GREAT, though I'll warn you should adjust the cooking time down a bit if you're stuck using a 12" cast iron instead of the 10" called for! But other than that one adjustment, I made it "as is" and it was phenomenal. I'll definitely be making this a few more times and experimenting with different toppings such as sliced peaches or strawberries in addition to the powdered sugar/lemon combo. It was really great and a quick but decadent dish to whip up, which are my favorite!

This turned out absolutely delicious! The touch of lemon really adds to the flavor! I don't have a cast iron skillet so I used a round baking dish instead. The crust stuck a bit, but all in all it turned out beautifully! My family loved it. I will definitely be making this more often!

Easy. I made no changes, and it turned out nicely. I made two this morning, the first having all the ingredients from the refrigerator (my son was hungry) and the second later, with the ingredients at room temp. There was a little difference in the fluffiness, but not much.

Oh, I didn't want to drag the blender out, so I used the whip on the mixer, beating  the liquids together first, then adding the flour and only mixing until smooth. I didn't want it to get tough at all.

I added a little more vanilla (I like vanilla), it was scrumptious. These were better than any restaurant I've been to. The family loved them. This was a very easy recipe to follow, great to try with your kids and make it a fun cooking time for all.

Very good taste even without vanilla extract (I ran out) and using eggs out of the fridge did not seem to make any difference.  I used 10" cast iron. Had to make a second batch for extra! Another special recipe that will be a regular for my family's weekend breakfast.

One of our family's favorite recipes.  Here's what I learned from making about 5 times:
- For a family of 4, we double the recipe.
- We happen to have 6-inch individual pans.  These work really well for individual-sized portions.
- We don't bother clarifying the butters as others have said.  
- With our smaller service size, these finish closer to 10 minutes.
- Otherwise, made according to the recipe.
These really do turn out as delicious, beautiful breakfast servings.
Enjoy!

Just made this and it was absolutely delicious!!  Very easy to make.  I didn't clarify the butter and it was perfect.  Mine wasn't as fluffy as the one in the picture, but it was still very pretty.

Thanks, Chef John, for a great recipe! Turned out exactly like your video showed. I have to admit that I ate more than half of the recipe because I thought it was delicious. Fun to make, too.

One of the other reviews mentioned making this in a muffin pan, so I tried it. I followed the recipe exactly, but lowered the temperature to 400. I greased a muffin pan with butter and let it get hot in the oven before adding the batter. I did make the mistake of letting it sit a little too long in the oven so the butter began to brown, so if you try this method, let it warm in the oven only until the butter has melted. Then I poured the batter equally among the twelve muffin cups. It doesn't look like much batter, but it puffs up a lot. I baked them for 15 minutes, and they were perfect! My husband loved them, and commented how light and airy they were. We had them with maple syrup and butter. A few were left over, so my husband stuffed them with cream cheese and deli meat for a snack. Yum! Thanks, Chef John, for a new favorite in our house!

Made this as written except that I didn't clarify the butter and didn't find the need to add more butter after, as plenty had pooled onto the top when I poure the batter.  Served with homemade lemon curd (another Chef John recipe) instead of just squeezing a lemon and it was amazing. I agree with John's comment in the video that we wanted more of it than splitting into 4 servings.  We had three adults and two small children. I cooked one batch and had a new batch of batter ready when the first came out.  Cut and served it and quickly popped the second in the oven to bake while we ate that one, then the second was ready right about when we we finishing that and wanting more. That made just the right amount. Yum!

This Dutch Baby was the easiest and most impressive pancake I've ever made.   I did not clarify the butter, too much trouble for me.  I heated the skillet on top of the stove, added the butter then the batter and cooked it.  Wow!  It  was beautiful.  Too bad it deflates so fast.  I followed directions with additional butter Meyer lemon and powdered sugar.  I also sprinkled cinnamon on mine.  Hubby preferred as original.  I will try with apple in the future

I'd use less butter in the cast iron (mine was really greasy) and maybe a little less salt/lemon.

Thank you for bringing back childhood memories! My mom made this quite often when I was growing up. I lost the recipe Years ago and had all but forgotten about it until I came across this recipe. Makes Sunday breakfast even more special.

It was delicious. Living in Japan, we only have access to a 6 inch skillet and a small oven. So I made one in the iron skillet and the rest in my T-Fal. The iron skillet was better. It cooked faster and puffed up higher.

Oh my gosh, this could not have been any easier! I mixed everything in my ninja blender, poured it into a regular pan (don't have a cast iron) and it worked beautifully!  Served it with a dusting of confectioners sugar and some homemade jam. Will definitely be making this again!

Delicious and super easy.  I omitted the vanilla and didn't clarify the butter but otherwise followed the recipe.  I've made it several times and it always comes out perfectly.  Serve with fresh squeezed lemon juice and a bit of powdered sugar.  Found out this morning it goes very well with eggs over  medium ;)  Enjoy!

These turned out perfectly. I just used regular, salted butter and instead of brushing it with melted butter and the lemon juice, we topped it with strawberries and maple syrup. So good! Thanks Chef John for another great recipe!

Great winter breakfast! I forgot the vanilla, but it was still very good. I had to bake it in a glass pie pan as I didn't have anything else, and it turned out great. Served with some homemade applesauce :)

A truly visual delight only second to the fabulous taste.   Very easy to make and a WOW presentation.  I made no changes to the recipe as this was my first time making it, but the next time I may add some vegetables for a possible light lunch.



I have made these "babies" many times now using my blender as the instructions say.  Today I used a wire whisk and the "babies" rose higher and lighter than ever.  I'll use my whisk and keep making these lovlies.

I added more vanilla, then cinnamon and nutmeg, plus 2 apples, thinly sliced.   It makes for an excellent substitute for apple pie.

I have been making this basic recipe for  about 30 years, without the vanilla so I am making that update to my recipe.  Got the recipe from a room mate who called it  "german pancake." Before I had a cast iron skillet I baked it in a cake or pie pan (skillet is better, but mentioning it in case someone is not making this because you don't have a skillet).  I don't clarify the butter, just melt it in the skillet.

This was excellent!  Made for my holiday brunch. Followed the recipe, no alterations. Served with a choice of warm maple syrup or cherry topping. There were 3 of us and nothing was left. It was the last item served, it was fresh and warm. All I heard was mmmmmm. Thank you, Chef John!

I've made these for years...  Putting it in the blender is a definite plus!!  I only made a couple changes.  Instead of the skillet, I simply put the butter (not clarified) in the baking dish and melted it in the oven while making the batter.  I poured the batter over the melted butter, baked it, and then it quickly disappears (eaten)!!  Everyone compliments this dish.  My son even liked this version, as it is lighter and a bit less "eggy" than some of my other renditions.

Doubled the recipe and it was all gone! Did not clarify the butter  and it was still ok. Will not double the butter next time as it was a little too buttery for my taste but family loved it! Thanks!

These are SO easy and taste fantastic. I use my AllClad 10" stainless skillet and it works excellent. They taste better than French Toast!

Made it today and my wife and kids said "you must make this again" it was delicious. I didn't use clarify butter this time but made some for next time. I used 1/2 tsp of vanilla instead of 1/4 and my wife made a cream cheese/grape topping instead of lemon. All that combined plus the confectionary sugar made this dish divine.

This came out SO great ... simple,  basic ingredients and a nice presentation.     Hubby is picky but he gobbled this up.  I will definitely be making this again.   It reminded me of popovers ... but easier to prepare.

Great recipe. I grew up eating a way more buttery version of this, what we called "puff pancake," and I have been making it for my family for about seven years. I have tried many different recipes and my daughter says this is her favorite so far! We like the thick egginess of it. I doubled the recipe, and did not wait for milk and eggs to warm up or clarify the butter. As the oven preheated to 475, I put the pan (I used a 9x13" ceramic pan, but I have used two pie pans in the past) in with the butter, one apple thinly sliced and cinnamon. Then I added the doubled batter and decreased the temp to 425 for the 20 or so min. Excellent. If my husband were home I might have tripled the recipe!

I only had jumbo eggs, so used 2.  My husband loved this recipe.  If your appetite is more than light, this is more likely a two serving recipe than four.  The hardest part of the recipe is making sure you set the ingredients out ahead of time to bring them to room temperature.  A very easy a good recipe.

I've never made this before and wow did it turn out excellent. I followed the recipe to a T. I believe what really adds great flavor is the Meyer lemon. Saute' some apples with clarified butter and cinnamon, spread on top once it's done cooking., WOW!

Wow food!  Delicious and so easy.  I like breakfast food for dinner and this is perfect.  Last week just didn't know what I wanted to eat and decided to try this.  It was all I had hoped for and more.  Great that ingredients are pantry staples.  Warmed up a piece the next morning and it was just as good!  A definite keeper!!!

Made it without clarified butter because I didn't have any. Found out Trader Joe's dies carry it so I'll stock up. Super yummy. Perfect with Meyer lemons. The only bummer is that about two minutes after I pull it out of the oven, it deflates. Still love it.

This recipe is better than the one I had been making for years.  I didn't use clarified butter and used a little less stick butter and it turned out great.  My husband always asks me to make this.

Delicious!  My first Dutch Baby.  I followed the directions but only had powdered soy milk in the house.   I didn't have a cast iron pan but I used a 10" wearEver nonstick skillet and it turned out perfect.  Baked at 425 for 20 min.  Perfection!

So, my teenage daughter insists I watch an episode of Family Guy, the one where they kill like three xmas trees and have to go out on xmas eve and end up at a diner that makes Dutch babies.  The cartoon version looked delish so naturally, I look to see what we have here.  Viola, beautiful and yummy Dutch baby, kind of like a heavier crepe only way less work.  I like mine minus the lemon with blueberry syrup.  Great easy recipe!!

Followed the recipe to a T.   Amazing and easy.  I just wonder why you don't have ready clarified butter in the US.  A sweet lemon is ideal; didn't have one and used a standard one - will try with lime next time.

Oh man this was good! I, sadly, do not yet own a cast iron skillet so I took the advice of another reviewer and doubled the recipe so I could use a 9x13 glass dish. I followed the recipe, with my glass dish being the only change, and it turned out amazing. It was the first time I have ever made or eaten this. It was custardy, almost the texture of a lemon bar (without the crust) and it could taste like a lemon bar too if you top it with enough lemon juice and powdered sugar. I will definitely make this again.

Too easy and delicious!  Followed the recipe exact but didn't clarify the butter. I'm sure this recipe has endless toppings add one. My husband still added a little maple syrup to his, but I liked it with the hint of lemon and powdered sugar just fine.

First time. Made it just as the recipe suggests. I think I could also make it as Yorkshire Pudding, skipping the vanilla, adding salt and pepper and including drippings from beef roast in iron skillet with half the butter. We loved our Dutch Baby.

I unfortunately did not have any powdered sugar but these were still fabulous with the touch of lemon and butter and some raspberry homemade raspberry syrup.  So easy and delicious; like baked crepes.

I used to make these years and years ago. I had forgotten about them until I saw this recipe. I was so excited that I made it right away.  It was delicious and brought back many wonderful memories.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you Chef John!

I haven't made this yet, but needed to say that it is not yorkshire pudding. If you ever lived in Yorkshire, England, you would know that. I will give it five stars because I've never made any recipe of Chef John's that wasn't outstanding.

Don't know if anyone commented on these being called "Dutch " pancakes but when something is German in origin it's  called Deutsch (pronounced doitche) which is German for German.  
Yes it is a Yorkshire pudding batter but seeing as Yorkshire pudding is God's food,  I say "Go for it!"

My family has been making these since I was a little kid.  I add Kosher salt to the butter before adding the mixture.  We've always eaten it with regular yellow mustard.  This and corn dogs are the only thing I seem to put mustard on.  Don't knock it until you try it.

Great simple recipe - made exactly as recipe called for - my eggs and milk could have been a little more room temperature though.  My family loved it - a nice change from pancakes or waffles.  A nice breakfast treat during holiday break!

I doubled the recipe, didn't clarify the butter and cooked for 28 mins, also didn't use lemon and conf. sugar, but used maple syrup instead  This is very awesomely buttery and rich, next time I'll make a side of something salty, like bacon or ham and maybe since I didn't do lemon, some fresh fruit..  Our 10 month baby loved it, omitted maple syrup for her :)

I didn't clarify the butter or use milk (lactose intolerant),  I used Earth Balance Soy Free Spread, and Almond Silk.  It turned out beautifully!  Topped it off with some plump blueberries. Yum!!

I have a question hope someone knows.  Is this what was called Liberace from years ago? Seems similar but can't find old recipe. We use to make as kids on stove top with black skillet and put butter and jam on it. If this is same recipe I would be thrilled so I can share with my kids and grandchildren.  Thanks

The family oved it! I melted the butter in the hot iron skillet as suggested from others, since I didn't have clarified butter on hand. 
I made this exactly as directed and it came out beautiful! 
Topped off with fresh warm peaches with cinnamon and sprinkled with powdered sugar.

Not sure about this recipe! Mine did not rise at all. Not really interested in a dense, flat version. I was looking for something that rises and a bit more fluffy.

I love this!!!!! It is absolutely delicious!  Supper easy to make. Very impressive looking all puffed up!  I find a cast iron pan is the best to make this in.  I make a lemon glaze to drizzle on top. So Good!

So easy to make.  Most of these ingredients you will already have on hand.  I did buy the clarified butter for the first time ever and am glad that I did.  It worked wonderfully and it lasts a long time.   A light and fluffy pastry with butter, lemon & confectioners sugar on top make this baby delicious!  I make mine just like Chef John.  This comes out of the oven looking very impressive.  My guests loved it.   I make this Dutch Baby all the time.   I do add berries on top if I have them on hand.  Yum!

Very light and delicious.  I prepared it as written and I don't think I would change a thing.  Oh....I did add a little maple syrup instead of the lemon juice and powdered sugar.  I definitely will make this again.

We followed the recipe exactly except for the lemons. We prefer it with powdered sugar and syrup. It was out of this world!!!!
Thank You Chef John

It didn't rise like we've seen and experienced elsewhere. So far, we believe it's the use of a blender - friends used a mixer or by hand and got the desired results where it grew above the edges of the skillet. Going to try again, this time mixing by hand and hoping it poofs up better! Otherwise, super delicious flavor & texture that made people happy. So far, I think that lemon juice is the secret ingredient everyone is pleasantly surprised by (and maybe the sugar!).

Loved it!  This is my first time making Dutch Babies and also using a cast iron skillet.  Everything tuned out perfect eventhough I didn't clarify the butter.

I made this recipe substituting regular milk for coconut milk, the milk replacement type, not the kind in the can for Thai food, and I baked them in glass pie pans. I preheated the pans along with the oven, and that worked great!  I also used Barleans Omega swirl fish oil, lemon zest flavor, as a topping along with the lemon and skipped the sugar.

Chef John nails it again...I literally just threw this together for dinner tonight because I had nothing besides pantry staples in the house and with my husband away on business, no motivation to fuss or run to the store. Only change was increasing the vanilla to 1 tsp. I did pull the eggs and milk from the fridge and put them in a bowl of hot water to bring them to room temperature while I preheated the oven and gathered the rest of the ingredients. I used a cast iron skillet that I threw in the oven while it preheated - pulled it out and put the clarified butter in (happened to have a jar of ghee on hand) and popped it back in to get super hot. Loved that I could mix everything in my blender and just pour the batter over the melted butter. When it was done I dotted the top with butter and sprinkled with table sugar. Yummy and minimal cleanup! Will absolutely make again - next time I'll add a step and caramelize apple slices with sugar/cinnamon in the clarified butter before topping with the batter!

I bought a jar of Ghee (clarified butter) so I wouldn't have to clarify my own butter. Followed the recipe as written, and here's what happened: As I was heating the clarified butter in the cast iron skillet, it got super hot and was smoking but not bubbling.  After letting it stay in this stage a few minutes waiting for it to bubble, I went ahead and poured in the batter and baked it.  It only took about 18 min. in my oven, and even then the bottom was just a little too crispy.  It wasn't burned, it was just very brown and hard.  Probably should have taken it out a couple of minutes sooner. My son absolutely loved it and said not to change a thing other than the crispiness on the bottom.  He always orders a Dutch Baby when we go to Original Pancake House, so I was glad he liked it.  Overall, it was easy to make and very well received.  I was just nervous about the temp of the butter in the skillet.

I followed the recipe as stated. They came out fantastic! However, I noticed that in my WELL seasoned cast iron skillet the extra flour was not needed. Kids loved these with syrup, powdered sugar, and a variety of pie fillings! Thanks for another amazing recipe!

I've been looking for this recipe for a long time.  My babysitter used to make these.  I kept the recipe the same except that i added 1tsp vanilla and sprinkled some cinnamon and nutmeg into the batter.  I am so glad I found this recipe, when my daughter is older i can make it for her.

I try to follow a recipe to a T the first time I make it, and tweak it if necessary in the future. This recipe needs no tweaking. It was fabulous. I filled the Dutch baby with a mixture of a cup of fresh raspberries ,1/2 cup frozen thawed blueberries ,a tsp of sugar and 2 tsp. Meyer lemon zest. I added a few dollops of vanilla Greek yogurt and a drizzle of maple syrup over top. My guest is still raving about it. Definitely will make again.

I didn't add the lemon.  I did make a wonderful filling with heavy cream and cream cheese (whip 1 cup heavy cream, fold in 8oz cream cheese mixed with 3/4c sugar).  Drizzle over the top and add fresh berries!  AWESOME!!!

I used regular butter. I also used a pie dish because I don't have a cast iron skillet.  When the oven reached 425 degrees I put the pie dish in the oven with the unmelted butter in it, then started mixing the batter.  By the time the batter was ready, the butter was melted and I just poured the batter in the dish and put it back in the oven. No other changes.  It was yummy and SO easy! Served it with maple syrup and fresh berries.

This has become a breakfast favorite.  I use a glass pie pan which I put in the oven while it is preheating.  I don't clarify the butter, just add the butter right to the pan and let it melt for  few minutes before pouring in the batter - works great.
Oh, and I also don't use the blender - just whisk the mixture really well.  
I make a simple raspberry sauce to serve with this and it is delightful!!!

I just had this for breakfast at a Belgian family's house last week...absolutely delicious!!  She's had them her entire life and serves with lots of butter, fruit, cinnamon & sugar, or whatever you have on hand.  This is now my new favorite company food. Thanks so much, John, as usual!!

Made this for first time. I added cinnamon, nutmeg and increased vanilla.  Made sure my eggs and milk were room temperature and oven was at right temp.  Didn't need to cook it past 20 min. My husband and I were very impressed with this new dish to us that it made us happy all morning long. Don't forget the lemon juice and syrup = yummy

I made these in a muffin tin and it ended up making 9 of them.  I stuck to the recipe except I added a whole teaspoon of Vanilla.  I served them with cinnamon sugar and some home made apple compote. They were delicous, even my picky 2 year old gobbled them up!

Incredibly easy.  I made it exactly as described.  Perfect.  Then, I tried it in large cupcake pan and it was great too.  The kids liked having their own 'baby' to eat.

I added a bit more salt.
Also,  I put the butter in a glass baking dish and put it in the oven until the butter was bubbly, then added the batter and baked it. It was perfect!

This was delicious. We added added berry jam because we were out of lemons and didn't add any butter after baking, but otherwise followed the recipe. It would make a great dessert, not just breakfast.

Mine turned out perfect the first time. Wow.  I was so impressed, I actually uploaded a picture (not an honor my cooking is often granted).  I changed the technique a little.  I didn't clarify the butter.   I put the butter and the skillet in the oven and preheated it all together then just pulled the oven rack out, poured in the batter and slid it back in.  I didn't have lemon and I LOVE maple so I used pure maple syrup.  Also, Chef John is right about the clarified butter.  Next time I will A. clarify the butter and B. put the butter in after the pan and oven are heated.  Because even though it was delicious, I think it would be better without the browned butter flavor; particularly if it is garnished with anything lighter than maple syrup.

This is a great recipe for German/Dutch Pancakes. I made it exactly like the recipe states - down to using a cast iron skillet...and it was perfect! Family favorite and will make it again and again.  Thanks Chef John!

We had to drown them in syrup to give them enough flavor to eat.  I made them in a muffin tin and they stuck.

Amazing and so easy! As mentioned by another reviewer, I did not use clarified butter. For this recipe, it's essential to have room temp ingredients. For best results, whip the eggs in the blender before adding the rest of the ingredients, use a HOT cast iron skillet, and don't open the oven while cooking.

Easy and delicious. The combination of vanilla, Meyers lemon, and powered sugar is delicate and light. And the presentation hot  out of the oven is impressive. Will make again!

First time and it was great. I over cooked it some but now I know how to adjust. I will definitely make again!
 I can certainly see using this as a savory too. A bit of spinach, onion, feta. Or so many things my head spins...

When I was younger I was a line cook in a pancake restaurant and we made these, but in several versions. Apple, cherry, and the plain Dutch, or German. If you make it with apples, add the apples to the pan before the batter, then half way through, add cinnamon sugar to the top and flip over, then finish and serve upside-down style.

I follow the recipe as written and they are fabulous. Made them for my Granddaughter when she visited and she raved about them. I do cook them a little differently. I cook them in muffin tins with a spoonful of homemade caramelized apples on the bottom and for timing - 15 to 20 min. Served with a dollop of whipped cream and a scattering of cinnamon. What a treat. (I did submit a picture.)

This was delicious and easy! I chose not to clarify the butter because I'm not familiar with that process. Using regular butter worked fine for me. This will definitely be on my list to make for special breakfasts.

Soooo good!  I have wanted to make dutch babies for so long and I'm so glad I used this recipe because they came out perfect!  They were so puffy and delicious alone with powdered sugar and maple syrup or with cinnamon apples served over top.  I did take other recommendations of preheating the cast iron pan in a 475 degree oven to melt the butter before lowering the temperature to put the batter in.  I didn't use clarified butter, just regular butter.  Also I do like to add just a couple TBS. of sugar in the batter for extra flavor.  Don't be alarmed that the batter is very thin, almost like a crepe batter is.  Chef Johns recipes never dissappoint.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I have never had this before but I have used Chef John's recipes and every single one so far has been perfect. I made this for Christmas Brunch and didn't change a thing. Even found the Meyer's Lemons at a store near my house.  It was delicious. I can't believe I never had this but that changed today. Thank you Chef John....I always look for your recipes and your videos because they are very good recipes and the videos really help a lot.

So easy to make, very versatile too. Im already planning on adding some toppings. Sweet or savory will work great. Right on the money Chef John. I just wish I could get the sourdough starter to work. THAT would be a great day.

This was so delicious, and the first time I ever made one, though I had eaten them when I was a kid. On clarifying the butter, I had never done that so had to look it up. Being my first time, I still think I did ok getting most of the solids out of the butter, however, after straining and adding the clarified part back into the pan, I turned it up on high forgetting the pan was already hot from the clarifying and quickly burned whatever solids I had missed. It still turned out ok though because I think I was then able to scoop out most of the burnt solids before adding the batter. Yummy tip: if you clarify your butter yourself, save the strained out solids and top the cooked dutch baby with it instead of regular butter. SO delicious!

I have made it for my family twice and they loved it both times. 
First time I added blueberries to the presentation and today we enjoyed raspberries on top. I melt a little butter with maple syrup in the microwave to serve over the top.
It was a delightful Saturday brunch. Plan to make it often.

My boyfriend requested a Dutch baby because we saw it on an episode of Bob's Burgers. My boyfriend said he thinks it's one of his new favorite breakfast foods now. He isn't saying much while eating it besides that and 'mm'. I made it exactly as it said except no lemon. If you don't have clarified butter, it's easy to make, but I'm not sure how necessary it is.

Very nice. I made it with olive oil instead of butter. I put it 20 min in the oven but it would have been better a couple of minutes less.

Followed the recipe exactly, fantastic! We split the outcome into 2 servings instead of the 4...that good! Served with sides of sautéed apples, raspberry jam, fresh whipped cream (eater's choice).

super simple and yet it looks like you spent a lot of time creating it.  I'll try it in muffin tins next time. I used coconut oil and need to be more generous with the sugar!

I looked at all the reviews and slowly matched Sharlenes but the first time forgot about the vanilla, but was still great.  I used the muffin pan - went great with my dinner as a side of hot rolls

I love this recipe for a quick supper on a busy night. I grew up eating these, and my kids love them. I don't clarify the butter either, just melt it in the oven while it's preheating.

I Love Dutch Babies & have made many friends & family & myself happy for decades! I make them in individual ramekins, however, which is a nice presentation & keeps the 'puff' up as they get their plate. I serve them with a side of strawberries & bacon usually. I melt 2 Tablespoons butter in the ramekin in the microwave & swirl around the sides. In a bowl, whip with a  whisk 1 egg & whisk together with 1/4 cup milk & 1/4 cup flour. I also occasionally add a bit of vanilla or almond extract or nutmeg into the mixture. Pour this mixture into the preheated 425 degree oven.  Bake for 25 minutes & serve immediately with a wedge of lemon. Depending on how we are seated I either pass around a bowl of confectioners sugar if at a table or small ramekins of the sugar on their plates. I firmly believe the eyes & nose eats first! I just looked at the bottom of the ramekins I use for size and it says Corning Ware F-16-B  500 ML  Chef John ~ your recipes on this site look delicious! I am trying numerous! Thank you.

Delicious and enjoyed by all.  I used a cast iron skillet and it had a beautiful crust and yet was so soft inside.
*side note: I melted the butter in the skillet in the oven while it was preheating.

I made this for a light evening meal, with fresh fruit on the side.  I followed directions exactly, except for use of a butter/olive oil combination in place of the clarified butter (accidental substitution).  It was a little smoky at first when the butter - olive oil hit the heated skillet, but everything turned out great.  Family agreed this is a "Do again!" recipe!

Made this last weekend for the grandkids. When I've got the children I prefer quick dishes with short ingredient lists and that don't require me to be in the kitchen long. Also, fewer carbs in this than traditional pancakes. Very tasty and we all enjoyed it! Pretty presentation, too.

These turn out perfect exactly as written - better than the restaurant near here famous for them!  Not something I'd want all the time but a nice change.  Very good with orange in place of lemon also.

I loved this, I pretty much followed the recipe but I did add a tablespoon of sugar. I thought the instructions were clear and I just used regular butter melted in the cast iron skillet on the stove top, poured the batter in and put it in the oven. It puffed up beautifully and I added a little more butter on top and sprinkled powered sugar on it.i have been nibbling on this all day.

Everyone in the family liked this. I couldn't find my cast iron pan, so cooked in ceramic. Might be why it was denser than I expected.

This is the best Dutch Baby recipe that I have tried.  I used a 10" glass pie pan and heated it in a 450 oven.  Then I turned the oven down to 425 and put the baby in.  It was done in 12-13 minutes, so keep an eye on it if you've got a window, but don't open the door.  It rose so high it touched the upper rack, so next time I will be sure to take the top rack out.  My son and I both preferred the taste of this to the last one we tried, (which called for 2 eggs 1/2 cup milk, and 1/2 cup flour).  This is so easy!  Great for a weekend breakfast with the family and impressive enough to serve to guests

It came out perfectly.

I substituted sunflower oil for clarified butter, since it does well in high heat. It worked like a charm.

I didn't even have a fresh lemon, and it still came out wonderful with lemon and confectioners sugar. My hubby insisted on having it for a second time the next day!

This was so easy and good; everyone loved it! I made it almost exactly like the recipe except I didn't clarify the butter.

First of all, left out of the directions is the oven temp (it's in the video, but not in the written part), anyway it goes into a preheated 425 degree oven. Okay, that's out of the way, so on to the recipe itself - scrumptious!!! I make this with a variety of flavors to suit my tastes at the time and it always comes out so light, fluffy and decadent tasting! Another winner from Chef John!!

Wehave made this a lot but used four eggs and didnt clarify butter..in fact we didnt even heat the pan before putting it in the oven....still delicious. No fail...cooked at 425 for 15 min.

Delicious. I didn't have a 10 inch cast iron pan so I used my 12 inch cast iron pan and increased the recipe by 50% (yes that's 4.5 eggs).  Also it looks like Chef John may have left the oven temperature off the text recipe. He says in the video to use 425°.  I have included a picture, however it was before we put the powdered sugar on.
