This is not your everyday side salad (at least not in this house).  This is something that I would expect to be served at a very nice restaurant.  We just really enjoyed this simple and healthy salad.  I didnâ€™t measure the greens or pineapple, just threw them into a salad bowl, and then tossed with the dressing.  The maple syrup provides a good contrast to the pungent vinegar, sweetening it just enough, perfect in my opinion.   So, can you tell how much we liked this???  Skonkie, thanks for submitting your recipe, this will be made often in this house!

Wow, this one's a winner! I made it for company and they were all super impressed with it. I had several requests for the recipe! What an amazing blend of flavors. I was unsure about the cilantro but don't leave it out! It really adds a nice touch to the overall flavor.  This was eaten so fast I couldn't even take a picture - next time though, because there will be a next time!  Super simple and very impressive!

It was AMAZING!! and I changed the recipe in that I added sunflower seeds for added texture.  This was freaking awesome as written and deserves more than 4 reviews!!  All the flavours complimented each other extremely well and the maple syrup in the dressing surprised us with how much depth it added to the over all experience!!  Try it; you'll love it!!

Instead of maple syrup, I used pomegranate sauce and the taste was great.

Such a delicious salad, and exactly what I was looking for. I brought it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I do not like red onions, because they are so strong, but I included them this time. I think next time I will leave them out and add almonds or sunflower seeds for a crunchy texture.  Definitely will make this again soon.

My store didn't have any rocket (arugula) so I had to make it with regular lettuces but I think it was still remarkable. The pineapple and cilantro made it special

This is a very tasty salad  The Urugula mixes well with onion and pineapple  The dressing  is great  Maple Syrup gives it an interesting taste    A reviewer on this site suggested adding sunflower seeds  I tried that....Great idea  I also cut the onions more.   I have made this salad at least a half a dozen times for potluck parties and it goes fast

I made this exactly as written. No substitutions or modifications. Very good and very refreshing. The dressing is just perfect and light enough to allow all ingredients to shine.

This is a nice salad for something a little different.  It is a simple salad with not too much going on, flavor-wise.  I love pineapple in any form and it's what makes this salad what it is.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

The peppery taste of arugula contrasts nicely with the sweetness of the pineapple. The dressing is just the right balance between Maple syrup and vinegar. I enjoyed trying this recipe, and will use it again.
