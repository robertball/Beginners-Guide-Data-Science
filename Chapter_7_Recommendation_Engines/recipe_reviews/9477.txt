This is so good, I will never buy the store made stuff again.  A couple helpful hints - I put the sugar, and instant coffee in my coffee grinder and gound them up to powder. Also add the nutmeg to the grinder with the sugar and that will help it dissolve better. I also added a bit more sugar than the recipe called for because I like it sweeter.  I bought little bags at a packaging store, and gave this out for christmas gifts.  I got a lot of compliments on it.
Thanks for a great recipe!

I took the advice of using 1 c coffee.  I found this too be very strong and bitter (I used Max. House).  I kept messing around with the mix and finally got it to taste right.  All told I had 3 1/2 c creamer, 1 c choc. drink mix, 1 c coffee (used food processor to grind), 1 c sugar, 1/2 c Ghiradelli sweet baking cocoa, and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  This turned out much better, as good as store bought.

This time I used French Vanilla Creamer and it is SOOO much better than the plain creamer.  This is the 3rd batch I've made and by far the best.  I left out the cinnamon and nutmeg too.

I sub'd espresso powder for instant coffee. Yummy! I gave some jars of this at Christmas in pretty baskets filled with fancy coffee mugs and other coffee related items. Everyone has remarked how great this mix is!

After reading the other reviews, I made a small modification when I made this recipe.   
I used 1 cup of coffee instead of 3/4 cup.  I liked the result -- not nearly as sweet.
I'll try this one again.

I'm in the southwest, so I wanted a mix that would work hot or iced, this one does the job. I went ahead and used 1 C. of coffee, left out the spices, and used Irish Creme flavored creamer instead of plain. My secret for smoother texture: I used powdered sugar in place of granulated, which works excellent in this recipe. I mixed this using 24 oz. hot water to 4 Tbsp. mix, put it over ice and topped it with a little shot of milk, really good! Finally a tasty (and cheaper) version of my favorite iced drink!

This is a an easy and quick gift idea. I also used a food processor to blend the ingredients together. By making a recipe and a half, I was able to fill a one quart wide mouth canning jar to the top. I covered the top with a fabric top and tied an ingredient card to the jar with a raffia ribbon.

This is so good!  I made it exactly as written and I could drink it every day.  I imagine this would also be good with vanilla creamer.

This was pretty good.  I made a huge batch to pass out as Christmas gifts but I wasn't really amazed by the result per the recipe.  It's a basic recipe that works, but didn't blow me away.  I was hoping for a little more richness in the flavor so I experimented with extra ingredients.  Definitely play with it!

I am in LOVE with this stuff. I'm not a huge fan of the nutmeg and cinnamon, but it was still good. The next time I make this I'm going to use French vanilla creamer and dark chocolate drink mix, 1c of instant coffee (I like my coffee strong, I have a toddler and need the caffeine.), and leave out the spices. The possibilities are endless.

My friend gave me this recipe long ago.  I grind the coffee granules to make them dissolve better, and you can substitute any flavored powder creamer to change the flavor.  We make this for Christmas gifts!  Awesome!

Love this! I took others advice and used french vanilla creamer. I used hot chocolate mix for the instant chocolate drink mix. And I omitted the cinnamon and nutmeg. It was VERY NICE!! Could throw this together with things in the pantry for a quick gift anytime!

Good recipe.  For those on the fence about using cinnamon and nutmeg- use it.  It makes a world of difference.

My sister in law gave me some of this mixture in a jar for Christmas one year. Her`s was 1 cup chocolate drink powder, 1/2 cup powdered whitener, 1/2 cup instant coffee granules, 1/2 cup skim milk powder and 1 tsp. cinnamon.  After I make a cup I grate fresh nutmeg(1/4 tsp) on top. I don`t add sugar because I don`t like it sweet. I think the skim milk would make it creamier.

I made this one by the book, but added a bit more sugar afterwards. For whatever reason, the whole thing smelled like nutmeg, but tasted just fine. This is a really great gift idea!

It's easy to make with the kids on bad weather days.  Also, great gift ideas for teachers and fund raisers.  everyone loves a nice warm drink.  To cut the sugar, just use Splenda.

I made this tonight using vanilla caramel creamer instead of the plain and extra coffee. It had a very nice flavor. It was so easy to make and I can't wait to try other flavors of creamers. Thanks Git.**Update** 10/31/13. Made with vanilla creamer and pumpkin pie spice wonderful.

I read all the reviews and went out and bought all the ingredients and boy, what a disappointment! Apparently, all the reviewers have never had a cappuccino. What this is is Latte. Cappuccino has foam on top of it. This does not. It tastes like hot cocoa. Yuck

The first time I tried this it was really bad. I used 3/4 cup of instant coffee after I ground it up. It was so bitter. Well I did not give up. I mad two batches today, for Christmas presents. Used 1 1/2 cups no dairy creamer, 1/2 cup instant coffee before being ground (mixed with the sugar to grind). Did not add cinnamon or nutmeg. This is great. Well make it all winter because it is so good. Thank you for posting it for use.

I am personally not a fan of cappuccino, however, my friend is and she LOVED it! I did add a little extra coffee to the mix because she said the original was a bit "weak".

For the holidays, I used the Peppermint flavored creamer, white hot chocolate mix and skipped the cinnamon and nutmeg. Sooooooo Yummy!  I got a lot of compliments from the people I gave to as gifts.

The recipe "as is" is pretty good! I am giving this as a Christmas gift to coworkers, so I had to sample before gifting ... pretty tasty. Only suggestion is to add extra cinnamon or other similar spice. Overall, good flavor!

Very Good and Very easy. I had some Baby food jars ledt over, so for Chrismtas gifts I put a half cup mix in the jar and wrapped a white strip of paper around and drew cute faces on. I painted the lids black and attatched tags that gave the directions and said " Christmas Cappuccino. They turned out so cute--and the mix it's just yummy! The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is my hubby prefers it without the spices.

I used this recipe last year as gifts to add to baskets of other "in-a-jar" recipes, and everyone loved it.  My aunt made a special request for more this year, and I am going to let the kids make some for their teachers as well.  Thank you!

I found this a little on the sweet side.  I think it needs a bit more instant coffee or less sugar.

I don't like sweets too much, so I added a little extra instant coffee to the mix.  Also, FYI, I used generic low-cost store brand instant coffee, vanilla creamer and chocolate drink powder instead of brand names and it was really good, not to mention a whole lot cheaper than it could have been.  Just experiment with the ratio of water vs. powder mix until you have the strength you like.  This recipe is a keeper.

Very strong coffee flavour but maybe that's just me as I'm not a coffee drinker. Gave it out as Christmas gifts and got lots of compliments on it but wasn't my personal favourite.

Tastes great! I made a single serving before I make this mix for jars and/or gifts. I think it's a tad bit strong for my taste. I also thought it needed a tsp more sugar. But that was my taste. I used Swiss miss mix because I didn't have any other chocolate powder. I added a splash of almond milk (maybe 1/4 cup) after my initial taste test.  Will definitely make again.

This is a wonderful basic recipe. It gives you the outline, you just need to color the picture in. If you like something with a little more "wow" flavor. I used vanilla caramel powdered creamer in place of original. Upped the coffee and omitted the spices. I will definitely continue to use this basic recipe to make many wonderful flavors of cappuccinos!

I love this recipe. I blended the ingredients in my blender to mix more evenly. I also made some changes to suit my taste. I used fat free vanilla creamer, added about 1/4 tsp. orange zest, pumpkin pie spice since I didn't have any plain nutmeg and didn't add any sugar or substitute at all.  This is my new favorite coffee. Now I am looking for some nice small containers so I can make this as Christmas presents for all my co-workers.
