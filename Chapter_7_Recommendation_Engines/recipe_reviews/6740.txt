GREAT!!!  The taste and texture were quite wonderful.  I left the butter in slightly larger pieces, which I think adds to flakiness, and I got eleven 3-inch biscuits out of this recipe.  The first person who tried them said they were much better than his wife's, and he asked for the recipe!  I've tried several other popular biscuit recipes from this site, and I like this one the best.

YUMMY!!! Wonderful -used butter flavored crisco and turned out perfect. Should have made them bigger so it would look like I only ate 2 when I really ate 4.

I lost my grandmother's recipe for tea biscuits and now that she's gone I thought I'd never have them again.  This comes pretty close!  I'm used to English tea biscuits that are sweeter or more like scones so here's my modifications: I used 1/2 c. of butter instead of shortening, added 1/2 c. of sugar, 1/2 c. of raisns, and 1/4 tsp. of active dry yeast. I didn't knead the dough or cut it. I just dropped it onto the cookie sheet by tablespoons.  They baked up nice and brown.  If you add the raisins just butter them, if not just add butter and jelly and serve with tea!

This recipe really is quick and easy.  I just made these biscuits for the second time this week and added approx. 2 cups of grated marble cheese before adding the milk.  They turned out great.  Next time I plan on sprinkling some extra cheese on top before popping them in the oven for an even cheesier taste.

These are very nice biscuits and the dough isn't a horrible mess to work with.  I often think bread recipes don't call for enough salt, so I added a little more salt.  I don't recommend doing that.  These are salty enough with the called for amount.

These biscuits were GREAT, especially drizzled with organic agave!  Per reviewers' suggestions I used 1/4c. butter and 1/4c. shortening.  Also cut back on the salt.  A great reviewers' suggestion I tried was to use saran wrap on a dampened countertop to roll the dough out on.  This really cut down on the flour mess. Will not buy store bought biscuits again.

These were very good, best when fresh out of the oven. I made 8 larger biscuits and didn't roll out the dough but patted it down with my fingertips. Followed the recipe exactly and they were done in 12 minutes. Defintily don't over-bake these are they'll be too dry. We ate these with soft butter and strawberries preserves but I think that honey would be devine! They were a bit flaky on the outside and very tender on the inside. A bit bland alone but a very good base for something sweet on top. I also bet they'd be good with sausage gravy.

These tea biscuits are fluffy, cripsy, buttery, flavourful, melt in your mouth ... In other words, absolute perfection!

Plus, they're magnificent no matter how you go about preparing them: By following the recipe exactly as it's written, by baking them as drop biscuts as opposed to rolled biscuits, by adding in chopped up onion, grated cheese, and garlic powder, or even adding a couple tablespoons of sugar and a half cup or so of raisins!

Bottom line: If you're scouring AllRecipes.Com for the perfect tea biscuit recipe, then I suggest you call off the search this instant --- Because you've already found what you're looking for!

I LOVE these biscuits!  Even better is to reduce the salt to half a teaspoon, use butter instead of shortening and half and half instead of milk.  Also, SIFT the flour first and be sure your rack is one level higher in the over, so they don't burn on the bottom!  Perfect, light, flaky-- great conduit for honey, lemon curd, or jam and devonshire cream!

These are fantastic. Light and Fulffy. I double the recipe and keep the mixture without milk in a container in the fridge. Just shake out the amount you think you need, add milk to make a soft dough and bake a fresh batch when needed.

Hey out there...I am a whole wheat fanatic and I can say that these are absolutely AMAZING when done with regular whole wheat (or multigrain)  flour.  Be sure to use less flour(1 and 2/3 cups rather than 2 cups).  I also used 1/4 cup unslated butter and 1/4 cup shortening.  Brush an egg wash (1 whisked egg and 2 tbsp milk) on the tops just before baking for the golden brown finish we all love!  ENJOY!!!

i like to make my biscuits
quick, easy, and well.
quick = [room temp butter cut in
with chopsticks held in one hand]
easy = [shape dough into a square
& cut into square biscuits]
well = [don't overmix, knead to add
flakes & pay attention as they bake]

i think this recipe accomplishes
all that it claims to.
it makes a very light, fluffy
biscuit that lends itself well
to sweet toppings.

i DON'T think they taste like
bisquick at all (check what grade
of ingredients you are using if
you think they do) i used good butter,
whole milk, and everything else
according to recipe.  i tried to make
some with a cheese topping/cheese
sauce, but that didn't turn out well.
too savory, and the fluffy biscuits
couldn't handle all that cheese-weight.
serve with sweet toppings for best
results.  the simple, unsweet biscuit
doesn't overpower the nice toppings,
or vice versa.

I came across this recipe while looking for something else. I noticed that it was the exact same as mine. I LOVE this recipe, I use it for a variety of different things, sometimes I mix cheese, or apple into the dough, or I have even used it for a crust for a pot pie. Very delicious. My personal note would be, DO NOT use butter, you must use shortning, or I use lard. That's what makes it so flaky. Follow this recipe and you will not be disappointed! Thanks for sharing!

Tea Biscuit recipe made only eleven 2 ½”x ½” biscuits, which really were not thick enough! Don’t see how you could get 20 servings out of this recipe. This recipe is very close to the biscuits that I always make. The only difference is my recipe calls for ½ teaspoon salt, 3 teaspoons baking powder and ¼ cup shortening, which I would recommend and will continue to stay with.

Ha Ha!!  Not sure what happened to these!  They never rose at all and were just flat little things.  Nobody wanted to touch them (let alone eat them).  Maybe I should have made them sit for awhile before baking them.  Any suggestions?

This is an awesome recipe. It adapts well to additions like raisins, cheese etc.
I use 1/4 cut of shortening and 1/4 cut of solid block type margarine (NOT spreadable soft tub kind) and they puffed to incredible proportions. One note to those who do not work well with pastry, less is more when it comes to mixing.

We used spelt flour (half wholegrain, half white), substituted unsweetened soy milk for the milk, and then also added orange zest to half of the dough. They turned out great!

Nice flaky texture on the outside and soft on the inside.  I spooned them into muffin tins instead of rolling them out and cutting them and they turned out great. Definately will make these again.

Good but just a bit too salty for my taste. I'll cut the salt in half next time I make these. They're best eaten still warm from the oven!

WONDERFUL!! These biscuits are so easy to make! The taste & texture are great as well! Instead of rolling out the dough and cutting into rounds, I simply pulled pieces of the dough apart and patted into 1/2 inch rounds. It saved time and turned out perfect! I don't bake with salted butter, only unsalted and the biscuits didn't come out too salty as noted by other reviewers. I also added 1/3 cup finely chopped ham and 1/3 cup of shredded cheese for a savoury biscuit - yummy! Next I'll try raisins. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I'm giving this 5 stars for such easy ingredients and instructions & my complete idiocy.  I am not a baker and have only made drop type biscuits 3 or 4 times in my entire life and i've lived a long time.  I used salted butter and this made the biscuits way too salty.  I then made a half batch and left out the salt since the butter is salted.  I added sugar to this batch because i was going to try to mix with the salty batch.  Everything went well until I tried to roll out this dough.  I ended up having a Lucille Ball episode.  The sticky dough was everywhere.  I decided to drop the biscuits into a muffin pan.  I ended up with some pretty good biscuits, but definitely not the ones they were meant to be.  I will have to try again - maybe take a rolled biscuits for dummies course.

When I made this recipe the biscuits definately did not look like the one in the picture above.Mine came out white and they hardly rose.I tried to brush melted butter on them ,before I put them in the oven, to give them a little color.But it didn't work.I actually made two batches but none of them really came out like the one above.I would really love for someone to tell me how to get that golden brown color without burning them.They still tasted good.But not as good as KFC biscuits or any other tea biscuit recipe I tried.

I have been looking for a recipe like this for years.  They tasted just like the tea biscuits my mom used to make. Thank you!  They turned out perfectly, I used butter instead of shortening and topped them with butter and jam-so good.

These were some pretty good biscuits. They had a nice light texture. I am not sure where 20 servings came from? I got 10 biscuits at the 1/2 inch. thickness, with a standard biscuit cutter, and think it would be better to do about 3/4 inch. Instead of greasing a sheet I just used parchment paper. I liked that these did not seem heavy or greasy like some biscuit recipes. TY

I have made my mom's recipes for tea biscuits for years. It looks the same as this one. One thing I did change and it cut down on the prep work was rolling out the dough. I just drop by the table spoon and they are great. Give it a try.

Simple but good! Instead of shortening (8P) I used left overs from last round of baking; unsalted butter, & becel margarine. The thickness is defintely the key - 1" for perfection! :)

This was a wonderfully light and flakey biscuit! I ended up using 1/2 cup sweet cream butter and 3/4 cup of evaporated milk instead because it's all I had but they came out wonderfully rich in flavour!

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

Fantastic!! Followed the recipe as is and they turned out perfectly. The dough is rather sticky so instead of cutting dough into circles I just used a pizza cutter to cut it into squares.

This was a great recipe.  I have made it three times.  The first time using the exact recipe, which was great. Next time, I made these changes from some of the tips I read from other reviews: I added 2 tablespoons of sugar and used 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of cold Butter Flavored Crisco.  I also used a food processor to cut in the shortening and butter with the dry ingredients, then added the milk.  It turned out even better.
The next time, I didn't have enough milk, so I used a 1/4 cup of half and half along with the milk.  They turned  out just as good if not better.
Just an all around good biscuit.  Family loved them every time.

Simple and delicious! I halved the salt as per other comments on there and they turned out perfectly. I managed to have two before my husband devoured the rest in two days! Will double the batch next time ;)

A suggestion: This recipe works great as an impromptu shortcake recipe.  I usually get frustrated with people who post about how they substituted items in a recipe and are now disappointed that it didn’t work and can’t understand why??  But I used this recipe as a base for a strawberry shortcake and it worked beautifully and I had to share it.  I was given some strawberries out of season which where pretty sour.  I didn’t want them to go to waste so I though a shortcake would be a good option.  Well, I didn’t have any bisquick or eggs or cream as all the other recipes I found called for so I thought I’d try a regular biscuit recipe and add some sugar and see how it went.  I cut down the recipe to 8pp and added 2 tablespoons of sugar and some hazelnut flavored coffee creamer instead of milk and I came out with 2 large lovely shortcakes!  Topped them with the strawberries and yummm.  Just a suggestion.

This was my first crack at homemade biscuits, and these turned out really well.  Next time I will use the butter flavored shortening or just butter in place of the shortening.  Very easy to make and the results were great.  In fact, they were so good that my husband got mad because he thought that I had gone to Cracker Barrel without him and brought him home biscuits.  He was shocked when he found out I had made them from scratch.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

I looked up this recipe tonight while I was brewing tea, and in less than an hour (tea was still warm) I had tea biscuits! Making them was a snap, and FAST. I rolled them a bit too thin (got 15 out of the batch) but they turned out well. I sprinkled some grated cheese on top of half of them. Thanks for the recipe Debbie!

As written they taste too much like shortening but the quantities are dead.   As another reviewer suggested use half butter and you have a better tasting biscuit.....happy eating.

I've used this recipe several times, and like many of the other reviews I've read, instead of using shortening I used butter.  The butter gives it a nice taste.  My family loves this biscuit!

The first time I made these they were delightful except they became very chewy overnight so the next time I made them I stored them in a Tupperware container in the freezer and microwaved them for 5 seconds to make them warm. I also usually put extra butter in to make it soft and crisp.

SO Easy SOOO Good. I didn't have any shortening so I substituted margarine (I'm sure butter would work even better). I also had a bit of cream cheese (about a tablespoon) so I threw that in as well. I added a table spoons of brown sugar and I also used whole wheat flour. Sprinkled some flax seeds on top and these babies are flaky and light and delicious! Thanks!!

GREAT biscuit! I make these all the time when I want a nice, light, plain biscuit. They are soo easy and quick to make. They can easily be fancied up by adding cheese, or rasins depending on the use. I often serve them with Chicken a la king soup, they are a great companion! Just one thing to note: be carefull not to over mix or roll to aggresively. The more you work them the tougher they get.

Very good biscuit.  The first time I made them exactly according to the recipe and I enjoyed them.
The second time, I added brown sugar and cinnamon. I loved the sweet, cinnamon taste. Served warm with butter and coffee or milk is  wonderful.  My family also enjoyed them, not to mention they are fast and easy to make.  Made fresh for breakfast is a nice treat.  It's definitely a keeper.   A definite five star.
Thanks for sharing.

I made these exactly as directed and they were so dry.  I would add a full cup of milk next time if I decide to make these again...

Great Tea Biscuit! I have done this recipe many times. I do not put any salt and put whole wheat flour instead of white. I also use low fat butter instead of Shortening. It taste GREAT!

Great recipe! It made exactly what I was looking for. Easy to experiment with, too. I added feta and green onion to one batch, and cranberries and mint to another, and they both turned out great. I've also tried with 1/2 whole wheat flour, and that worked also.

Debbie!! These are the BEST biscuits EVER.  SO so easy to make.  My DB (Dear Brother) loved them, and I will be making these again and again.  I still haven't figured out why every one says they are so salty!  This was PERFECT.  THANKS and God bless.

Loved this recipe so much! I've been making the same old tea biscuit recipe thinking it was the best , that is until i tried this one, mmm delicious! The only problem for me was that it only made 12 and not 20, and maybe didnt rise as much as i wouldve liked, but i think i cut them a little too big. But in general this is a great recipe and i would highly recommend it!

Simple / easy to make. I added a dusting of icing sugar for taste. It took very little time from start to finish. I had the recipe ready to go into the oven in less than 20 minutes and I am new to baking. Thanks for the recipe. I think it may even be better with a substitute for shortening.

A good recipe.  I liked how it tasted (used butter instead of shortening) but I added raisins because I thought maybe it would be too bland without them...  good thing I added the raisins, it's what made them 4stars (but it's still a good recipe!).  I think next time (and I will make these again) I will use buttermilk to see how it turns out... and I will make the biscuits double the size so they don't look like miniature biscuits.  (The recipe states that they make 20, and they do... but they are small)

I used margarine in this recipe instead of shortening, and added one cup of shredded medium chedder to the works as well. They turned out almost crunchy on the outside but really soft and flaky in the middle,just the way I like them :)  The best part was the fact that they don't crumble away to nothing like the store bought ones do, and having a three year old, the less messes I have to worry about at meal time, the better LOL.

I didn't do the math right when reducing this (only two of us!), added too much milk, so added flour until I thought it was the right consistancy - they were great!  I cannot wait to try these again (yes, I fixed the math mistake on the printed out version!)

These biscuits are amazing! I used the food processor to cut in the butter- put the dry ingredients into the processor, pulse for a few seconds to mix, then place the butter (cut into tablespoon pieces, and very cold) evenly on top of the dry mixture, and pulse until the mixture resembled cornmeal. This makes it very easy to mix and also makes the biscuits more flaky! Also, because I don't have a biscuit cutter, I used an inverted glass to make large biscuits, and a mason jar lid to make smaller ones.

The lge. amount of baking powder gives them a flavor I wouldn't like if they were just served with butter BUT...This is the perfect biscuit for anything savory like a gravy, or anything super sweet, like a jam or honey.  I served these with pumpkin and apple butter, and they were gone in 5 minutes.  DELICIOUS!  Also, I made the dough in my food processor, so it was SUPER fast, and easy.

These were alright...they were the right consistency for biscuits, but i used margarine and thought the taste was a bit too 'buttery' and salty.  They also seemed a little greasy.  shortening might have different results.

I haven't really baked breads that much, so I was delighted this recipe turned out so well. I don't use shortening much and I didn't want to go out and buy some so I just substituted it with margarine (taken out of the the fridge 10 mins. before use) and halved the salt. They tasted nice and buttery. Also, I made them in different thicknesses to try it out and found that if you roll them out thicker they rise a lot more than if you roll them out thin.

Turned out to be great biscuits. When making them I pop the butter into the freezer for at least half an hour first and then grate it into the flour mixture and then simply toss it with the flour, this saves time and elbow grease and it also allows the butter to remain 'solid' right up to the point that you put the dough in the oven giving an even better result.
Cheers

This is my go to recipe for rainy days or a little indulgence.  I love these biscuits warm with butter,  dipped in gravy, they never let me down.
However I find that if I make the full recipe they don't last very well, so I recommend only making as many you think will be eaten.

They are fabulous with garlic and herbs mixed in, my favorite is cheese and dill.

I liked how easy they were to make, but they were a little too... I don't know, bready or something (for my taste). They were still good, just not my style of biscuit.

My husband made these today.  He grew up with them and he said they taste exactly the same.  He used butter (unsalted) instead of crisco.    We had them with beef stew he made from this website yesterday.  Wonderful together - biscuits and beef stew!   I'm going to make some flavored butter (honey and butter) to go with his next batch.

I loved this recipe! and equally loved how quick and easy it was. I did make some changes though, just to make it my own. Instead of shortening I used salted butter (that was all I had!) and I omitted the salt, since the butter had salt in it. I added 3 teaspoons of sugar and about 3/4 cup of toffee bits. They turned out fabulously and my family has already eaten half of them (I took them out of the oven an hour ago).

I don't know what made me try this recipe. I have a good recipe already for biscuits. I was really disappointed with these and my husband thought they were inedible. They were just salty bitter hockey pucks. Sad too. I had some buckwheat honey that was collected that morning. I was really wanting a warm biscuit and fresh honey.

Made these for my co-workers - and they RAVED out them.  Served up with homemade freshly picked strawberry jam - perfect.  Even plain, they tasted great.

For my own twist, just because I'm not always a fan of salt - I cut the salt in half, and added a tablespoon of sugar just to give them a little sweet kick for those who prefer no jam.  Nothing but thumbs up from my hungry workers!

Good recipe, very quick and easy to make. I would add a little sugar next time, amybe a tbsp. Made 10 large biscuits, baking a few minutes longer than stated until they are just golden. Used for strawberry shortcakes. Thanks!

I gave this a 5 star rating, not only because this recipe didn`t need ANY adjustments, but I made my own homemade patties (burgers) and didn`t have any hamburger buns, so I used this specific recipe and cut them a little thicker than usual and when they where done, I cut them in half like a bun for a hamburger dinner. They where great. I chose to add some Parmasean cheese and some shreaded Marble cheese to it as well. Perfect, it was a hit!

I've been making the same baking powder biscuits for forty years and I THOUGHT they were pretty good until I tasted these.  Yes, a little too salty, but an easy enough fix. Very lovely tasting biscuits with a slight crispness on the outside and a light texture. Loved them!

I took one user suggestion and lessened the salt (as I used salted butter) by half. Besides that this recipe is perfect! My husband loves them plain, with butter or made with raisins baked in. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

These were super crumbly and yummy!  I served these a side dish with dinner and instead of rolling the dough and cutting out biscuits, I just dropped clumps of dough on the baking sheet and they turned out fantastic with no leftover dough.

An easy to make biscuit recipe. I did add 1/2 tsp of salt and didn't knead the dough, to prevent over handling. They raised well and tasted great with Irish-Style Stew, also from this site. Thanks for the recipe Debbie.

This recipe was great.  I served them with stew and they were a hit with everyone.  I also used the butter flavored Crisco.  I did not get 20 biscuits from one recipe.  I made two batches and got 24 biscuits using a water glass to cut them.  The double batch served 8 adults with some left for the next day.

I used margarine instead of shortening and they turned out pretty good. I used the top rack in my oven and the bottoms still browned while the tops stayed white. And while they did rise, they didn't get as tall and fluffy as I was hoping for. Still, not bad for something so easy to put together in the morning. Slather on some butter and honey when they're still warm. Yum.

This was a super recipe. I am horrible at baking and this one.. first try.. perfect.  I didn't have a cookie cutter so just used a knife.  Had them for breakfast instead of toast..mmmmm.. I split the batch in half and rolled one part in Irish Shreadded Cheddar.  YUM.  Will make it over and over again.. easy to make.

I made these to go with my Mom's chicken soup, but added shredded cheddar just before adding the milk as another reviewer suggested. They were fabulous! At the end of the meal, there was only one left, and I think there may be a fight over who gets it. :) Thanks for a great recipe - I know I'll use this time and again.

Great recipe!  I made 8 large tea biscuits and used half margarine and half shortening. I also added in some grated cheese... ummmm! I found it easier to roll and flatten balls of dough with my hands and I made the second batch thicker than 1/2 an inch because mine didn't rise much.

I've been looking for a good tea biscuit recipe for ages and this one is really good.  I think the key is shortening (instead of butter which most recipes call for).  I used butter flavoured Crisco and this was great.  Also, I used a full teaspoon of salt and this could definitely be cut a little.  Overall awesome recipe.

Very, very buttery. And I over handled the dough so they were a little dense, but still very tasty.  I might cut the butter next time, though.

and another 5 stars!  Great taste and fluffy texture.  I always add 2tbsp of sugar to my biscuits, including this one and lots of juicy raisins.

(tip:  to keep your counter clean when kneading the dough, wipe it first with a damp cloth and then spread some plastic wrap on the counter.  When you are finished kneading, just pull it up and toss! works great for pie crusts and roll out cookies too).

Finally an easy biscuit recipe!!  I have NEVER made a descent biscuit before, so this easy recipe was a wonderful surprise.  I only gave it 4 stars because it was extremely salty.  Next time I'll cut back quite a bit on the baking powder and salt. My tiny biscuits didn't rise well (maybe I rolled them too thin?).  I did have some left over dough so I molded that into 1 chunky biscuit and baked it ~ that one turned out beautifully fluffy!!!  Since we love butter, I'll probably add a bit more of that next time too.  Terrific recipe and with some very minor tweaking, it is going to be my constant go to recipe for biscuit making.

Great biscuits. Light and fluffy texture. Distinctive baking powder biscuit flavor. These were perfect with gravy. I'd make these again, son and I liked them. DH was not impressed, but he ate almost a whole one. I only made 8 of these as I used a mason jar lid/ring to cut them, so they were good sized. We all only ate 1 since they were big. These were really decent biscuits, thanks for the post Debbie.

I followed the recipe as it was written and they were a good basic biscuit recipe. Very simple and worked well for Biscuits and gravy. Also good with honey and Jam. We are at high altitude and they worked well with no changes.

This recipe makes nice, light biscuits.  They're not at all heavy like several of the other recipes I've tried in the past.  I brushed them with melted butter while baking to give them some color.  A good biscuit to go with soups.

so yummy!  I made 8 larger biscuits as did another user and they were ready right at 12 minutes.  They are so light and fluffed up wonderfully!  I used butter flavored shortening and I think it gives then a spectacular flavor!  Def one I will be usig again :)

As a biscuit these were "ok" they were very easy to make hence the 2 stars. As a Tea Biscuit they were definetely lacking something (maybe sugar and/or raisins)

Unbelievable!! Wonderfully light and flakey. It was like biting into air! I, too, used less salt like some reviewers advised. I used about 3/4 tsp. I also added about 1 1/2 tsp. of sugar. You must try these.

Great taste and texture. I usually use a buttermilk recipe but was out of buttermilk and found this recipe. The only changes I made were to sift the dry ingredients and I added a little extra milk to make the batter more moist. I will definitely make it again.

I have made these biscuits several times and I've always had excellent results.  It is one of my go to recipes when I want a recipe I know is going to please.  Today is different in that I used organic for all of the ingredients including organic coconut shortening. The results were just the same, wonderful. Next time I will try using my own organic milled flour and see what happens.  I'm sure they will be heavy but I'm pretty sure they'll still be great.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very nice basic recipe that you can experiment with. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out amazing. Only problem was, we don't eat processed foods, so they are a touch too salty for me, but that is my taste.  Wonderful recipe, thank you!

Very easy recipe with great results. Perfect for strawberry shortcake! I made one change: substitute shortening for 3/4 cup butter. You need to add the additional 1/4 cup to make up for the difference in fat content.

This recipe is quick easy and delicious!  the biscuits are flaky.I doubled the recipe and used canned milk- 1 can is 1 1/2 c which is perfect for doubling.  I also replaced 1 cup of flour with wheat flour.  Made this with BobJones gravy recipe also from this site.  They have disappeared!  My children inhaled these.  Also good with honey which was resorted to when gravy was gone.  I will make this recipe again and again and again..  :)

This is a very good recipe, the biscuit were light and fuffy although there is a bit too much baking powder. So instead adding 4 teaspoons of baking powder I added 3 teaspoons of baking powder which was better. The biscuits came out just as good without that overpowering baking powder taste.

I would half the salt. But that's because I do not like salty things. 

I also divided the flour, half whole wheat and half all purpose. Makes a delicious whole wheat tea biscuit!

I just dropped them onto the cookie sheet by the spoonful without rolling and they were amazing! So light and delicious.

Very good recipe. I grated the butter (cold or could use frozen) I use unsalted as I like to control my salt. I also added grated cheese but you could use dried cranberries and finely grated lemon zest. I don't like baking with shortening as a personal preference but also the hydrogenated fats are worse for you than the saturated fat in butter. If I am going to eat fat in moderation I'd rather have the real thing...

This was a really good recipe but salt needs depend on what you use as an oil base. If using unsalted butter or shortening you may need more salt, whereas if you use salted butter this amount may work. I will try with salted butter and see next time.

These biscuits are AWESOME. I've been craving biscuits for a few days but didn't really feel like dealing with the hassle of making them. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. These were so easy to make and tasted amazing! The only modification I made was instead of two cups of all purpose four I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of all purpose, used my stand mixer, kneaded on the counter 8 ish times and used a round cookie cutter. They were perfect in 12 minutes. They are perfect in every way. Great with honey!

Just made these this morning.  I took the advice of previous reviewers and made a few changes of my own.  Used 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  Added 1 tablespoon of sugar.  Also added 1/2 cup raisins.  Finally, did an egg wash as recommended on another biscuit recipe on this site.  Served with a little mango butter (from Trader Joe's) on top.  They are amazing.  My husband and sons loved them.  I am so happy to be able to make something so delicious with minimal effort that is relatively healthy as well.  Thanks to all the previous reviewers for their comments. They are truly helpful tips.

Ooh, these are very yummy.  I made the sweet version to use as dessert with sliced strawberries and whipped cream.  I used butter as the shortening and added 1/2 cup white sugar, otherwise kept everything the same.  They came out deliciously sweet.  Those who prefer their sweets a little more savory would be fine with an addition of 1/4 sugar.  I did find that 12 minutes was too long in my oven - I'd check them at 10 minutes to see how they're doing.  Enjoy!

These are great, this is my third batch.  The only thing I changed was adding 1/3 cup sour cream and reduced the milk by 1/3 cup.  I did have to add a bit more milk, tbs at a time.

I have made these biscuits a few times now.  They are quite easy to make and very nice, light and fluffy.  Taste great warmed with butter or jam spread on them.

My husband is English and loves his "scones".  I added a bit of sugar to the dough and baked these up.  We prefer them with jam and cream.  So good.  They make great savory biscuits too.. just leave out the sugar.  Thank you Debbie!

Fluffy goodness with a few subs. Flour: spelt. For each tsp Baking Powder: 1/4 tsp baking soda plus 1 1/2 tsp lime (or lemon) juice (added in with the milk). Shortening: coconut oil. Milk: almond milk. A fistful of extra flour balanced the extra moisture from the lime juice, and an extra tsp salt balanced the extra flour. DH loved them. Yum!

I feel that they are best when cheese is added or just sprinkle sharp cheese on top. Also, I don't roll out the dough, scoop it with an ice cream scoop - the kind that has the trigger -  and then flatten out somewhat with your fingers. It leaves a nice organic shape to them.

These taste great but what am I doing wrong. I cannot get that nice raise on them like in the photo here. i never thought of it being the baking powder, but will it really make that much difference? I have tried this and even my husband's grandma "famous" biscuits and I cannot get the biscuits to look right!

I used sweet cream butter instead of shortening and these turned out great. Very fluffy on the inside. I did let them rest for 10-15 minutes before putting them in because the oven was otherwise occupied, but I don't know if that made any real difference.

These biscuits were amazing! I was looking for something quick and easy that would go with any meal and I found it. However, I did cut back on the salt (I used 1/2 tsp) and added 2 tsp of dried parsley.

I'm giving this a 4 for now. I didn't have shortening so I used half butter and half tenderflake. I also used 1 1/2 cups flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. The texture came out just right but the taste was a little off. Not sure if it was from the tenderflake or too much baking powder. I will try it again and use half shortening/butter and reduce the baking powder a little. Tasted ok with the butter though and I'm sure with a little jam on it it will be ok too. I didn't have a pastry knife so I used a fork and it worked fine, I also kneeded the dough in the bowl then pressed it on a cling wrap like a previous post suggested. I didn't use a rolling pin because the dough was sticky. I pressed them into a large 3/4" square then cut 12 smaller squares. Seems way easier then having to dip a glass and having to roll out the dough to many times to use up all the dough. Very simple though, good job!

I  halved the receipe and added some sugar and cut down on the salt, as stated my another member.They have a wonderful flavor but I did not get much of a rise out of them .I guess I rolled them to thin. Will make again and next time, not roll them so thin.

My turned out a little salty only because I used butter, not shortening. Otherwise, they were fast and good.

Out of all the homemade biscuit recipes I've tried, this is absolutely the BEST ever!  My whole family loves them.  I've made them 3 times (exactly like the recipe) and every time they turn out light, fluffy and soft.  Perfect!

I needed to get a tea biscuit recipe to go with some chili,fast. This was the first website and the recipe was simple. They were sooo good. I'm using margerine/butter instead of shortening next time and some grated cheddar cheese. There was a bad review (Dec 9,2007) for these and I don't know why. I love them

Thank-you so much for this recipe.I have had problems for years getting a nice light textured tea biscuits.I would recomend halfing the salt and maybe adding a little sugar.They were yummy besides that.

This was one of my "can't sleep so let's bake" experiments.  I took this basic recipe and altered it to make orange cranberry scones.  Here's what I did.  I used half whole wheat, half all-purpose flour.  I added a tablespoon and a half of sugar, and a teaspoon of ground ginger.  I used vanilla soymilk, and a teaspoon and a half of orange extract (no fresh oranges).  As I kneaded the dough, I pressed dried cranberries in. I cut it into 11 triangles, and baked slightly longer than the recommended time.  They turned out light and yummy.  I'm definitely adding this one to my collection.

Nice texture, but I had to reduce the salt by half.  I prefer much larger biscuits than the recommended size, and had to increase the baking time to 18 minutes to make sure they were cooked all the way through.

Rollling out the dough in a single, flat piece and topping with garlic and cheese made for a very nice garlic biscuit to go with soups and chili.

I halved the recipe which should make 10 but I only got 8 out of it (I wouldn't want to make them any smaller). I also added a tiny bit less salt per the other reviews. This is between a 3 and a 4. The main problem we had was that they were too crumbly. You couldn't break in half to insert butter or honey in the center. I would say served hot you can melt butter on top and then drizzle with honey. Difficult to eat with your hands. Suggestions on if I did something wrong? I would say with butter and honey the  stars are up a notch though. Good flavor.

They taste good.  But.....they taste just like the biscuits I make with Bisquick!  And at the top it said it was supposed to make 20?  I got 7 out of it.  And I didn't make them huge either.  I had to cook them for 20 minutes--not 12-15 minutes. 
I'm going to keep this recipe to use for those times when I'm out of Bisquick.

These were excellent.  I had them with chili last night.  Just like my mum used to make.  Mine rose nicely, were flakey on the outside and soft on the inside.  This recipe is definitely a keeper for me.

Very good. Used half whole wheat flour and we ate it with butter and strawberry jam. A recomended recipe. It was good as is, but I like to experiment and will try replacing the milk for sour cream. Yummy.

Made this recipe as suggested then made my adjustments. I added 5 tsp of sugar to the dry mix and added a tsp of vanilla to the milk before adding to dry mix. Did not roll out - I just pressed with my fingers on a parchment sheet (no extra flour) then used a small round cookie cutter. Baked at 400 for 12min on parchment paper and an insulated cookie sheet. Recipe made a dozen and they were fabulous.

This is an amazing recipe! I didn't have shortening on hand so I used 1/2 cup butter, and I added 1/3 cup brown sugar, as per some of the review recommendations. The biscuits turned out AMAZING. I also didn't roll them out; after kneading, I would grab small balls of dough, flatten it a bit with my hand, and then cut the shape out. I got 10 biscuits, each about 2 inches in diameter from this recipe.

This recipe makes the perfect biscuits. I usually add a tablespoon of sugar, and add different types of cheeses when I make it. The best is probably medium or old cheddar. And it's super easy to make.

The texture of these was phenomenal, but the flavor was only ok.  They had plenty of salt, but yet seemed just *okay*.  I used an unflavored crisco, same as I typically use in my biscuits.  I do believe it would have been improved with some bacon fat or butter flavored crisco.
My husband said he prefers my other recipe for biscuits -  and I can't remember which one he's talking about!  I've been trying out a few new ones lately! Ha!
*I followed another reviewers suggestion to try using seran wrap on a slightly damp counter - worked great!  Eliminated the mess completely!  I didn't even add flour :)

These turned out really good.. Phew!!! :) I only say that because I took a risk and doubled the recipe (needed double the amount that the original recipe makes) Of course I made some modifications ;) reduced the baking powder to half the amount, and I don't use shortening so I used butter instead (only had salted butter so I reduced the amount of salt to half of what is says originally). I have made biscuits many times and this is the recipe I like the most... So I highly recommend it! 
Thank you for sharing this recipe, Debbie.

I found these tea biscuits very bland and salty despite it only calling for 1 tsp of salt.  I tried them with some cheddar cheese and with jam.  I brought some to my co-workers....Threw out the remainder of what I made.  Very disappointed.

Great tea biscuits!! Only change I made was using butter instead of shorting, and added 1/2 cup of sugar ... next time I think I'll use 1/3 of a cup of sugar they were bit sweet and they go great with all jams !!

This is my go to basic t-biscuit recipe. I substitute cold butter for the shortening and often roll it out flat and add a slather of butter and cinnamon and brown sugar. Roll it up and cut into 1.5" slices. Bake in a 9x9 pan. Our family favorite cinnamon biscuit roll with cream cheese icing.

The biscuits were good but not quite what I expected. These could have been any off the shelf store variety in taste and texture. Again not bad just plain in my opinion.

I Substituted with buttermilk, just because that's all I had, and 1 tsp. more baking powder, just because was afraid would be heavy.  Came out fantastic. Light and fluffy. Great recipe!

These are super simple and yummy biscuits. For a change I rolled out the dough and then spread with butter, cinnamon and brown sugar, then rolled it up and cut little cinnamon biscuits that turned out great!

Well, I never rate dishes i make. This one reminds me of my grandmother. From the southeast she made homemade biscuits quite often. This recipe is delicate the biscuits are rich and flaky. I made a double batch. It's quite superb. I also added goat cheese to one batch! With honey incredible biscuits!!

I make these for Christmas every year specially for my daughter because they are the only sweets she really likes. 

For people who are complaining that they are too crumbly if you wait until they are cool before touching them they don't practically disintegrate on you. If they do after cooling then you did something wrong. You need to nake sure you whip the batter long enough or they won't turn out well.

This is a great, quick recipe.  Only thing to note is the 'resting' time before baking.  I allowed 5 minutes, but I think 10 or more might have allowed the biscuits to rise a little higher.  Even so, these were delicious and I will definitely make them again!

Although I used butter instead of shortening.
Overall, definitely a recipe I would recommend, and make time after time.

I was looking for a simple, basic biscuit recipe to make  with my 6 year old grand-daughter - we changed two things.  We used all butter and used the drop method rather than rolling out and cutting them.  The recipe makes  a good, basic  tender biscuit.  Someone else mentioned that too much handling makes them tough - that is exactly what I learned over the many years I have been making biscuits.

Followed others advise and used half butter half shortning. I added perhaps 1/2 c cheddar chunks and tablespoon fresh spicy oregano snipped in pieces.  Next time I will pat out and not roll my hubby likes them thicker    Very tender

Made these tonight for strawberry shortcake. I cut the salt in half added 3 table spoons of sugar and increased the milk to 1 cup. They mixed well and I dropped the dough rather than rolled it out. They turned out good. However in the future I am going to reduce the salt to 1/4 of a teaspoon and reduce the baking powder as well. With a little tweaking I am confident this will be a family favorite.

As I write this review, I'm sitting here eating these warm, succulent  tea biscuits and I (immodestly) say, they're absolutely WONDERFUL !  ;-)  I've made them a few times and this time I used half shortening and half butter, which seems to have worked out very well. Tips for GREAT biscuits that  I've learned from better bakers than me include:
- Don't overmix or over-handle the dough. It should be craggy and rough, not smooth and stretchy like bread dough;
- Press your biscuit cutter straight up-and-down, don't twist it;
- Let the cut biscuits "rest" on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes before baking;
- Brush the top of each biscuit with milk before baking for a lovely golden finish. 
THANK YOU DEBBIE for this great recipe!!! It's as good as my grandmother's, and that's hard to beat.

I make these about twice a week and they turn out beautiful every time. Perfectly crumbly & melt in your mouth good. I add up to 1/2 cup sugar for shortcake.

Even after heeding the warnings about the baking powder being overpowering ... I figured I'd run the risk of going 50% less baking powder even with that amount.... the baking powder was STILL overpowering...

HUGE HIT!!.  Super simple!  I mixed up the dry ingredients and used butter.  Put it in the fridge until ready to bake.  Then added in the milk and let it rest about 10 minutes.  Rolled it out lightly and made about 15 biscuits.  Next time would roll a little thicker.

Great recipe, very simple. I used butter instead of shortening, and they turned out very flakey, I think next time I'll use a bit less salt, but overall, good biscuits.

Crispy outside with soft, warm and flaky inside, paired wonderfully with a hot bowl of soup, tea and jams!  We needed to add a little extra milk, just to bring it all together, but still lovely.

I was worried because I had no shortening. So I used coconut oil instead and was delighted. I've used butter instead of shortening in other recipes and wasn't as happy with that substitution as I was with coconut oil.

Golden outside, flakey inside. Use at least 1/2 shortening (the rest butter) for a smooth, easy to cut-out dough. Rose beautifully!  I think you MUST be certain oven is hot.

Those were SUPER easy!!  I whipped 'm up in 10 mins to go with my pot roast.  I followed the recipe and added a few shakes of dried chives and about 2/3 cup of shredded Colby Jack cheese.  I do not have a biscuit cutter so I just used the cap of my cooking spray...worked like a charm!  :)

Very dry and there is too much baking powder, which made them too salty. They would probably be better if the recipe used butter instead of shortening.

Maybe it was because I used whole wheat flour, but I followed recipe and boy were they dry.  Perhaps will use a bit more milk and maybe some butter instead of shortening.

This is almost the same as an old family favourite. The difference is that you add an egg to the milk and beat slightly to make sure it's mixed thoroughly. Add the milk to the dry ingredients.   Once you have kneaded, rollled and cut the biscuits , bake at425 for 15 to  20 minutes or until golden brown.

This is my favorite biscuit recipe so far. The only change I made was substituting about 1/2 cup of the flour with whole wheat. I got 7 biscuits using a large cookie cutter.

All we could taste was the baking powder. Even after drowning it in butter and smothering it in jelly. I felt like I was going to choke because they were so dry.  Sorry, but I won't be trying this recipe again.

Wow! Tender-crisp top and bottom and melt-in-your-mouth, flaky on the inside. Just a little salty for my personal taste so I'll cut it by 1/4 tsp next time but the texture is so amazing that this is now going to be my mainstay recipe for biscuits. Thank you Debbie!

Made these tonight to go with soup.  I read some of the reviews and halved the amount of baking powder since another reader wrote about there being too much, and I also added the marble cheese that another reader suggested and they turned out terrific :D

If your biscuits taste like baking powder, check the ingredients and get one that is aluminum free.  I use Rumford and it works great.  Also, I prefer using butter instead of shortening or even cold lard.  (Never said this was a health conscious mixture, but they are oh so good!)  I will also use 1 tbs. of sugar, 1/2 tsp cream of tartar and two tbs. of dried buttermilk mixed with the dry ingredients and instead of regular milk, I use cold buttermilk.

Too salty for me. To be fair I did use salted butter instead of shortening, but I doubt that I'll make these again. Really not what I was looking for in a biscuit.

Super easy, however.

This is a very good, reliable recipe. Like some others, I use butter instead of shortening and reduce the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. My favorite variation is to add about a 1/4 pound of crisp, crumbled bacon and a 1/4 pound of shredded Colby cheese after cutting in the butter, then mix in the milk. Bake as usual, split while hot, and pile in scrambled eggs. You're ready to go!

I just made this recipe according to instructions. I can tell you, for real, these do not bake at 220 degrees Celsius.  At the 15 minute mark at this temperature, they had started to flatten out and we're still very very soggy to touch. I had to up the temperature to 350 and cook for a further 10 minutes.  Perhaps they didn't cook at 220 because I added half a cup of sugar?  The flavor was okay, but still going to continue searching for another recipe.

Just great as-is. I use butter for more flavour, though, instead of shortening. I also like using buttermilk in these, as they get nice and fluffy. I've subbed about a teaspoon of baking soda for all of the baking powder (with a bit of vinegar in the milk to help with lift) and those turn out okay, but with a kind of baking soda aftertaste I don't wholly enjoy. Nobody else seems to notice or mind that taste, but I think I would recommend using baking powder in the recipe. Typically I don't have baking powder in the house (baking soda usually works fine and is cheaper) but this is one recipe I find isn't exactly the same with baking soda. So there's that. Anyway, great recipe as-is, but butter and buttermilk take these over the edge! :)

My first attempt at biscuits and I won't try another recipe.  These were amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly then added some cheddar cheese and garlic powder.  Can't wait to try again with a  little sugar and some raisins.

I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect. Fluffy, moist, and slightly golden brown. However they tasted so much of baking powder that we couldn't eat them. I thought maybe I screwed up, so I made them again. The second batch came out perfect looking and the taste was still just as bad as before. We had three people in the kitchen to double check the recipe so I know it wasn't me.

These turned out really well but quite salty.

I ended up using butter rather than shortening. Not sure if the butter made it more flakey but it did make it taste very buttery.  I rolled them out and let them rest for about half an hour before baking in hopes that they would rise more.

March 30th, 2013 - I tried this recipe for the first time today.  Based on all the feedback I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp., added 1/3 c. sugar, and used butter in place of the shortening.  The first batch came out of the oven lightly browned, tasty and light.  The recipe yielded 12 biscuits with not quite the height of the picture displayed in recipe.  Since I needed at least 15 I repeated the recipe.  Interestingly enough, even using the very same process, the dough was stickier.  I used a smaller round cutter in an effort to get height and yield a few more biscuits, but they came out flatter then the first batch and not as flaky.  It is surprising that a recipe can have such different results in two batches.  Overall, I'm going to try them again.  Hopefully they'll turn out like the first batch because they were really very good!

They were AMAZING! But they didn't make the 20 so I doubled it and made it 40 and they turned out so good and so thick! I brought some to work with me and everyone who had them loved them!  And they were so easy to make! Thanks for posting!

Yummy! These were simple and tasted great! I added some parmesan, garlic powder and a couple of handfuls of shredded cheddar to these and instead of cutting the dough, just formed balls that I patted down. Turned out perfectly. This was so easy I'll get my 6-year-old to help me next time.

Very good! This is the first time I have made hand made biscuits and I couldn't have picked a better recipe.  I usually turn away from recipes that use a pastry cutter, but these were not a mess at all! Perfectly fluffy and moist, just enough of everything. Great with sausage gravy. Very easy to make.

i am lactose intolerant so i made this with lactose free milk, added half a container of tofutti french onion cream cheese and 1/4 cup of veggie oil. cut my tofutti into the dough as my replacement for butter/shortening since i didn't have shortening. They turned out PERFECT! They were a hit with the family and i was asked to make them exactly the same

Great. These turned out very nice. I used spectrum shortening. As some others mention, I did not bother rolling and cutting them. I just broke the dough into 9 equal balls and put them on a baking sheet. Very tasty, especially with blackberry jam. I have very little cooking experience, but this went very well. Easy recipe! It's quick enough to make along with a fresh pot of tea. (I had them in the oven in about 10 minutes. Could do it a lot faster on a second try, or if I was more experienced in the kitchen.)

These are DELICIOUS! I have made a few with the baking soda & do not like them (not sure how people could rate this recipe when they used baking soda not baking powder). I like the baking powder biscuits. These are very soft. I used real lard. & Dropped spoonfuls as well. They are a must try!

just made these.   I used mostly palm oil (organic shortening) with a little olive oil for the fat base and substituted 1/2  c whole wheat flour for 1/2 c of the white flour.  They turned out really fluffy, crispy, yummy good.

These biscuits are quick and easy.  I changed the ingredients a bit: a 1/2 & 1/2 of white and whole-wheat flour, butter instead of shortening and almond milk instead of dairy milk.  These biscuits came out light and fluffy and I will definitely use this recipe again.  (Also, left out some of the baking powder per some complaints.  It wasn't much, went with 3 1/2 teaspoons instead of a full 4).

Great tasting, very good receipe, all I had to do was add a bit more milk as the dough was crumbly when I was trying to knead it. The tea biscuits turned out great

I love this, I add a couple teaspoons of sunflower seeds for crunch and a bit of garlic salt for flavor.  Then brush with garlic butter when they are done.  The kids can't get enough.

Well, I don't know how everyone did it, because my dough was very, very sticky. I added 1 tsp. sugar and reduced the baking powder to 2 tsp. Still, I think this needs less milk or a bit more flour. Other than that, I liked it!

i found this recipe a few years back.  it quickly became my go-to tea biscuit recipe.  i make these with my two little girls - they are absolutely wonderful fresh and warm from the oven with butter & strawberry jam.  i hope my kids will carry fond memories of these tea biscuits for many years to come.

Just great! As always I use half whole wheat flour, half regular. I also used water in place of milk because I wanted my vegan friends to enjoy them as well. Also added 1.5 tsp of honey as I was afraid they would be lacking in flavor without the milk. Listen to others and don't overmix any recipe with flour after the wet ingredients have been added, mix until combined, that's it!

I did the recipe with half all purpose flour and half bread flour because I didn't have enough regular flour. I also added 1 teaspoon of honey. The recipe is really easy to do and takes no time at all. I thought it tasted great if not a bit too 'flour-y'. I'll definitly try it again!

I was able to successfully scale this recipe down to just five tea biscuits and it turned out great! The biscuits rose beautifully. I felt there was something missing though, but that could just be a personal preference. Maybe some extract - vanilla and/or almond perhaps? Thanks a bundle for the recipe! I'll definitely be making these again!

I used butter instead of shortening and they turned out exactly like I'd hoped.
After reading other reviews, I tried to handle the dough as little as possible.
They rose perfectly.
I will use this recipe again, and won't even think of using mix from a box.

Quick, easy, full of flavor. We used butter rather than shortening. We also found that making these ahead aren't a great idea. Make and eat ASAP! Will make again and again. Thanks!

Excellent, I had never made tea biscuits before, and had understood they can be a bit tricky.  I added shredded cheese and used butter instead of shortening.  They were quite possibly the best tea biscuits I have ever had.  But I may be a bit biased.

Very bland & boring flavor, didn't rise very much at all. I'm convinced this recipe calls for too much handling of the dough. I'd recommend NOT kneading the dough at all. I won't make this again.

These had just the BEST taste!  I halved the recipe because the original says it serves 20...but then I found that I had to roll it to about 1/4 inch to get even 8 biscuits out of it.  Which is what I did. So they came out really flat, and I wasn't looking forward to the taste, but OH MY GOSH!  They were so good that I wanted to eat all of them!  Next time I will just make 4 big biscuits with half a recipe.  (I did take suggestions to halve the salt and use 1/2 shortening, half butter.)  Thanks for the recipe!

Didn't turn out quite how I like them.  A bit dry I found.  They had great flavour though.  Tasted great with a little butter and jam...

The first time I made them, I had no shortening so I used just butter and it turned out really well.  Now, I use half shortening half butter.  This keeps it flaky (the shortening) and flavorful (the butter).

This recipe has addicted me to biscuits! I use butter instead of shortening, and try to work the dough as little as possible. I recommend rolling them out a little thicker- they really puff up.

These biscuits were good, but they did NOT rise properly.  They turned out more like biscuit cookies than actual biscuits.  But they still tasted pretty good.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. The only thing I do differently, is to roll out dough thicker than recipe before cutting.  Yum!
