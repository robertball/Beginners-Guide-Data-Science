I made it in a loaf pan instead of muffins.  Turned out great.  I cut back on the sugar in the cake so not overly sweet

Not bad but you will need to double the topping, add a bit more cinnamon, a bit more vanilla and the cooking time is much to long...18-20 minutes. ...

I followed the instructions.  Used pecans instead of walnuts as that is what I had. Turned out great. Baked 25 minutes, next time I might cut it back a couple of minutes so they might be a little more moist.

This recipe had a lot of fat in it and I thought it would be moister than it was.  It could be that I used a 1/2  whole wheat and 1/2 white flour in the recipe.  I baked it for 20 min. instead of the 25.  I think I would lower the temperature to 350 and use all white flour next time.  It was an okay muffin, but really not that much different than most.

I used almonds since I didn't have walnuts. Mine were a little dry - I think I used a bit too much flour. I'll be trying this again - the muffins tasted good and my mom loved them!

These were blah and uninspiring. I'll pass on making these again.
