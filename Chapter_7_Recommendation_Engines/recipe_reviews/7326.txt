Awesome! Don't have cake flour on hand? No problem; for every cup of cake flour use 1 cup of all purpose flour minus 2 TBS. This turned out with a consistency like velvet. I used lemon extract instead of almond. I used my KitchenAid to beat very well and add air. Used a bundt pan for 1 hour 10 minutes. This only fell very slightly as I made sure not to open oven during baking. Absolutely delicious and worthy to serve to the most discriminating dessert fanatic. This is my new favorite pound cake recipe.

My family and I just love this pound cake. However I have never made it with the almond extract, since I do not care for that particular flavor. As for those who who gave this recipe less than great reviews...I wonder if they ever have had a REAL homemade pound cake? This recipe has the texture, density and crumb that a"pound cake" should have. For those having problems...check your oven accuracy and mixing methods. Remember there are none of the usual leavenings added. This cake depends on air beat into the fats and eggs in order to rise properly. For those who did not have cake flour...take 2 tablespoons of flour from each cup of all purpose flour to substitute for cake flour. I rate this pound cake as the epitome of all pound cakes. Just a review from a professional baker :-)

This recipe makes a beautiful pound cake!  I read all of the reviews/suggestions at least twice and incorporated many of them into my attempt and I am very happy with the results.  It's lovely and everyone loves it!  I used 2.5 cups of sugar as many people recommended.  My husband said the sweetness and moisture level was exactly right.  I used all-purpose flour instead of cake flour and subtracted a total of 6TB from the 3 cups, as per the conversion others gave (thank you!).  I decreased the almond extract to 1/2 tsp and added an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla (total of 1-1/2 tsp).  I creamed the butter, cream cheese, sugar for five minutes on medium/medium high on the Kitchen Aid stand mixer and it ended up a soft off-white color (like the color of Bisquick).  The batter was beautiful indeed, as someone else mentioned.  I divided and baked in two 9x5 loaf pans for one hour and 10 minutes at 325 and my cakes were perfectly done.  The cakes did not actually "fall", but the delicious crusty top that had arched up during baking caved back down after removing from the oven to a flat level - so the side profile of the cake was rectangular, not arched on top.  No harm at all.  This recipe is a winner.  I can't wait to try lemon extract and various flavored icings!  Thank you!

Good recipe but way too sweet.  Made it to a T the first time and it was tooth-achingly sweet.  Have tried 2.5 cups and 2 cups and find 2.5 cups sugar works best.  Baked in a bundt pan, but the cake fell too much after cooling.  I find baking in  2 large loaf pans is best.  Definitely overmixing is a must for this recipe.  Since this has no leavening agents, you must beat air into the butter and cream cheese until is very pale and fluffy - about 5-7 min. As well as mix well after each egg is added.  Don't peak during baking or the cake will fall.  One thing I don't like about this recipe is th appearance on the inside.  The uneven discoloration as you see in the picture that's posted.  It looks like it's uncooked even though it is.  I like a more uniform look.  But this is very moist, just cut back the sugar.

I have made this countless times for good reason. It is a moist cake, with a delicate cream cheese flavor and a pebbly, cookie-like top. If that's not convincing enough, I recently offered this recipe to a friend of mine who was looking for a cake to use to top with fresh berries for her dinner party.  She used it, she loved it, and her 10 guests loved it too. She is a professional pastry chef...

Yummy yummy!! I have made this twice already. The first time just as the recipe reads. The second substituting more vanilla for the almond extract. I think both are great, but the almond does add that extra "mmmmm" factor. I made it both times in 2 loaf pans but made the mistake the first time of taking them out to check on them after only 1 hour. Both cakes sunk in the middle. Still tasty but not pretty. The second time, I left them in or the full 1 hour 15 minutes without disturbing them and had only a slight amount of sinking after they were out. All in all, this is a fabulous cake. This is what pound cake should taste like!

This is an excellent cake.  I add approx 4 ounces of sourcream to it because I like my pound cakes moist and it makes a great cake even better

Excellent cake.  I mixed mine differently.  I creamed butter & sourcream well.  I added one egg at a time and mixed well after each egg.  Then I added my flour, one cup at a time.  

It is such an easy and tasty cake.  I taught my 10-year-old daughter how to make it.

EXCELLENT!!! I have made A LOT of pound cakes in my time as I was once a semi-professional baker. This recipe is great! I used all vanilla extract as I don't like almond in my pound cakes. Also--make sure you blend this batter long enough as there are no rising agents. I used two loaf pans as tube pans don't always yield the best results with a heavy cake (I made this for the first time on Mother's Day and I didn't want any mishaps). I filled it with fresh whipped cream and sugared strawberries for an awesome strawberry shortcake.

Made this cake this morning and just tried a piece; it turned out PERFECTLY! I followed all the ingredients in the recipe except I cut the sugar back to 2.5 cups and used regular flour so I removed 2 tablespoons flour for each cup of flour, for a total of 6 tablespoons.

In 1990 I found an article on baking pound cakes and pull it out every time I bake one. If you have never read an article on this, I suggest going to a baking web site and see what they say because there are important steps to follow. If you don't feel like going through the trouble then at the very least follow these steps: Cream the butter & cream cheese 2 minutes. Slowly add sugar and cream butter/cream cheese/sugar for 7-10 minutes for a hand mixter and 5 minutes for a stand mixer; this is a VERY IMPORTANT STEP for this recipe because the air will make the cake rise. Stir in extract. Add flour and egg alternatively, beginning and ending with flour mixture; only mix enough to incorpate the flour and egg ... don't overmix. This is a new favorite!!

OMG...this was insanely delicious!!!  I made this for a birthday dinner party and topped with Chocolate Ganache from this site - INCREDIBLE (everyone loved it and hubby wants me to make it often)!!!  Loved the delicate almond flavour.  Opted to reduce the sugar to 2 1/2 cups per some other reviewers and also usesd 4 eggs and 2 egg whites, turned out perfectly.  I had to cook mine for about 1 hr and 25 mins and used an angel food cake pan instead of bundt as noted by a few and had no issues with spill over.  Plenty of room in there!  Incredible pound cake, can't go wrong with this one!

I made this cake 3 different times this week.  I love it!  All three times I made it with confectioners sugar not granulated sugar.  It turned out absolutely amazing, it is a heavy rich tasting cake.  The first time I cooked it with 2 1/4 cups of sugar, in a bundt pan and used just vanilla, 1 TBSP plus 1 tsp.  It was amazing topped with a dark chocolate ganache.  The second time I used 2 1/2 cups of sugar, lemon extract in place of the almond and cooked in a bundt pan as well - it was amazing with a raspberry cream filling.  The last time I used the recipe as is, baked in a large sheet 10 x 15 pan for 30 minutes.  This cake I cooled overnight and then cut in half and stacked with a chocolate truffle filling then cut it into small petite fours with a poured chocolate fondant.  MMMMMmmmmm!  All I can say is this is my GO TO recipe for most of my specialty cakes from now on, I really like the cream cheese flavor and it is heavy and easy to work with cake for petite fours.  I must say that I did enjoy it with the 3 cups of sugar, and did not find it too sweet, but I know that I can definitely adjust it depending on what the filling or icing will be to compensate for different flavors.

Fabulous pound cake that melts in your mouth! I love the flavor and moistness the cream cheese provides.  I cut the recipe in half and used lemon extract vs. almond extract. I baked it in a 9x5 glass baking dish and it was perfect for strawberry shortcake.

The taste of this cake is amazing, and fairly easy to make - it turned out very well at the first try and was rich and dense with just the right amount of cheesiness oozing through the buttery flavour. A true dense pound cake that's delicious even when eaten plain. In fact, I preferred it without frosting. I would recommend this to anyone! However I've given it 4 stars because 3 cups is just too much sugar - I used 2.5cups and it was still extremely sweet. For those who don't have a sweet-tooth, I would recommend a cut to 2 1/4 cups or even 2 cups of sugar. Also while the texture of the cake was perfect, it wasn't an even colour. This is usually rectified by ensuring the cheese and butter are creamed together at room temperature, but my cake was mildly splotchy even though I did so. However it's mild enough not to be a detrimental factor unless you're baking it for a event like a wedding where the aesthetics has to be 100% perfect. This cakes also works extremely well when used for heavy fondant and gum paste decorations (I did) as it's sturdy enough to withstand quite a bit of weight. Last note: if you're not familiar with or fond of almond extract, don't use it. I cut my almond extract down to 1/2 tsp but it was still very strong and the next time I bake this I would substitute the almond for more vanilla.

When Grandma LTH requested Strawberry Shortcake for her 85th birthday cake, I was momentarily flummoxed (I prefer my cake sans fruit).  I turned to resident culinary guru Naples for help and she steered me in the direction of this recipe and I'm so glad she did!  I followed the recipe to a "T" (though I did bake in mini bundt pans, resulting in a decreased bake time...about 35 minutes) and the results were delicious!  I knew they were going to rock when I couldn't stop stealing swipes of raw batter!  I did not eat a strawberry topped cake, but I did enjoy the tidbits I leveled off to all for a smooth bottom.  THANKS for a great recipe (and special thanks to Naples for pointing me in the right direction!)!

Excellent flavor and texture! Used 2-1/2 cups all purpose flour, and baked for only an hour and five minutes. I used all vanilla, replacing the almond extract with a tsp of vanilla, as my family is not fond of the taste imparted by almond extract. Super moist with a fine crumb. Also, used Splenda for half the sugar to make more diabetic-friendly. Served with pureed strawberries sweetened with more Splenda. No one could tell that it was a reduced-sugar recipe. The quintessential pound cake.

I've spent many years making pound cakes, watching them being made and the best part, TASTING them.  I have to say that this is the best pound cake I've ever tasted and is the best I've ever made.  I left out the almond flavoring and put a total of 1 & 1/2 tbls. vanilla flavoring.  I also added about 4 tbls. of Frangelica hazelnut liqueur.  I've read the reviews and saw some complaints about the heavy texture.  One thing I think some people may not know is that pound cakes, by nature, are heavy...thus the name.  As well, it's next to impossible to get a pound cake exactly right without a stand mixer.  Making a pound cake with even a hand mixer is tough.  This cake had a marvelous texture.  45 minutes after it came out of the oven, I only had 1/2 of it left...my family scarfed it down!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This cake is FANTASTIC!!!  It has a wonderful flavor (not too sweet) and the texture of this cake is to die for.  I like to add my own special touches to any recipe I use, so after spraying my pan, I sprinkled it with a cinnamon/surgar mixture and then sprinkled some over the top of the batter after I filled the pan.  It gave the cake an almost 'crunchy' coating and the hint of cinnamon was was heavenly.  I made this cake two days ago for a family gathering.  Everyone in my family loves to cook and they always outdo themselves when it comes to our get-togethers.  This cake was a HUGE hit, they all couldn't say enough about it and they all requested and left with the recipe.

SOOO GOOD!!!! I live in Peru and there's no cake flour here, so I used 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour + 1/2 cup conrstarch. Also, I was out of almond extract so I added the rind of 2 oranges... wonderful, it's going straight to the family recipe book  :)

This is the most wonderful Pound Cake I have ever had. Growing up in the south I have tried them all. This is the greatest. One tip, try slicing it with an electric knife. All the slices come out perfect. Thanks for a great recipe.

I have been making this cake for 30+ years and it has yet to fail me!  The number of times I have been asked to bake this cake (I wished I had a dollar for each request :)    The tick to having a moist cake what I have found...I sift my cake flour 2x's (I take out what I think is a little over 3 cups of cake flour and SIFT it into a bowl, thenI take a large serving spoon and gently shake the flour into a measuring cup, leveling it  with the back side of a knife and shake , (not dump it) but shake it into the sifter. Then when the recipe calls for the flour to be added to the creamy batter, (this will be the second time the flour has been sifted)  I know this may sound like a lot of work (and it could very well be) but not to me because of all of the raves I receive...well worth the work!!!!  The recipe is sooo worth the effort put into it.  I use various  types of flavoring, lemon, coconut, I have even used lime juice!  I am not a bit fan of almond by itself (I add vanilla to mine).  Try using vanilla and lemon together!!  Ummm-ummm!

This is a really great pound cake recipe!  The texture was very good and the taste was wonderful.  Like previous reviewers had suggested, I reduced the sugar to 2.5 cups and used all vanilla extract instead of vanilla and almond extract.  I also used neufachtel cheese (light cream cheese).  I ended up baking it for 1 hour 30 minutes and it came out great.  One small problem that I had was that the cake rose beyond my pan (I used a nonstick fleur de lis pan from Nordicware) and when it cooled, it fell slightly.  This didn't affect the taste at all, but when I turned the pan over to unmold the cake from it, the part that had rose over the rim cracked a little and the bottom edge of the cake stuck slightly to the pan and broke a little bit.  This may just have been me or my pan.   I think I might have whipped too much air into the batter.  Well, I'm going to try it again soon.  Yum!

This is a great base recipe. I have used it over and over again as is as well as with variations. I generally leave out the almond as it's not a flavor I like. I've used lemon in place of the almond. My newest way of doing it is adding a bag of fresh cranberries just before baking it - the tart cranberries really go well with the sweetness of the pound cake. 

One note - the picture shows this as a bundt cake but the recipe calls for a tube pan. If you use a tube pan you will get the yummy crunchy top - using a bundt pan means the top winds up on the bottom and you lose the yumminess.

I have never ever made a successful white cake from scratch before, despite numerous attempts and a fair amount of competence with other bakery items, chocolate cake, cookies, muffins, brownies, pies, etc... UNTIL this recipe! I had my doubts but I just followed some of the other recommendations (2.5 c sugar, all vanilla) and took my time and really made sure the butter/sugar/cream cheese was nice and fluffy before starting the egg/flour process, let everything fully incorporate and scraping sides before next addition. I baked it in 2 loaf pans for exactly one hour 10 minutes and lo and behold-Perfect cake!!! I'm so excited! Thank you for this recipe! I will be making at again soon!

This is just a note on something I've discovered. I've made this exact same recipe for years.  I got it out of one of those phone book cookbooks. It didn't specify what type of flour to use and being a novice, I always used self-rising.  I always ended up w/ a large pound cake and I always put a cookie sheet underneath while baking, but I only had it overflow once.  Well yesterday I decided to do some research on poundcakes and the type of flour to use and found this same recipe and it specified cake flour or from the hints, all purpose flour w/ 2T take out from each cup, making sure to beat with my Kichenaide mixer very well.  Well I did this and my cake turned out much more "packed" then my usual cake does.  Hubby noticed it right away and didn't care for it at all.  So now I will make sure to always used my self-rising flour to get the crumbly, airy cake that we love.  I just thought I'd share! Thought it was funny/strange.

This is the most buttery tasting pound cake I've had in a long time!  I just took my luscious loaves out of the oven, and it was like a taste of serenity.  I took others' suggestions and ended up with a product that exceeded expectations!  I substituted every one cup of cake flour with all purpose flour minus 1 tablespoon for each cup (as another reviewer suggested).  Due to concerns of dryness, I baked 2 loaves at 300-325F for 1h 15m, rotating the pans half way.  I'm glad I tried this recipe.  Totally worth the few ingredients I invested into this cake!!!

Oh yeah, I cut the sugar back to 2 1/2 cups, and it was still pretty sweet.  You can probably get by with 2 cups of sugar.  Also, I didn't have any vanilla extract, so I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of almond extract....believe me, that was plenty!

I am not sure if I have ever had a real pound cake before, but if this is what they taste like I have wasted soo many pound cakeless years!!! This cake is heavenly, and if I can make it right, anyone can!! I am making my second batch right now for my daughter's girl scout potluck. The first time I used a bundt pan and it was flawless, this time I am following other users advice and am using two 9x5 loaf pans.When I make this recipe I feel like Donna Reed!! thank you thank you!!

This is a great pound cake recipe! I made this over the December holidays as part of a breakfast spread. I made a strawberry sauce with fresh and frozen strawberries, sugar and vanilla extract cooked down just a bit. It was perfect! I baked mine in 2 loaf pans and it took a little longer to bake so after the 1st hour I covered them with foil so they wouldn't get too brown on top.

Reduced the sugar by 1/2 C. and found it to be perfectly enjoyable without being overly sweet. Also, this required 15 extra minutes to bake through as a knife inserted came out still somewhat wet, so I would suggest between 15-20 extra minutes of baking, checking every 5 minutes or so. To get the dense and fluffy texture, take your time making this -- cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, and don't rush alternating flour & eggs: beat them until thoroughly incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl after every addition is mixed in. This takes time but the results are worth it.

We didn't have almond extract so doubled the vanilla. Made by my 11 year old daughter with minimal assistance, and served with fresh blueberry sauce. The cake came out tasting like a very fine, soft and toothsome vanilla sugar cookie.

Hope you try this you wont regret it!

Great Cake! I baked it once like the receipe stated and it fell. Second time I used reg. flour, 1 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. baking powder. Baked at 300 for 1 hr. 45 min. and it came out great! I will replace my old receipe with this one.

I started with 4 oz of cream cheese and modified the recipe accordingly. I reduced sugar to 1 cup and reduced butter to 1/2 cup. I doubled the flavorings: 2 tsp almond and 2 Tbsp vanilla. I didn't have cake flour, so I used 1.5 cup wheat flour. This made a loaf of cake. The cake was very dense, fragrant, and delicious!

I literally had to freeze this to keep myself from eating it. I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups like others suggested, otherwise did exactly as original poster in 2 9" bread tins. PERFECT at 325 for 35 minutes. Added lavender icing over the top.

OMG YUM.. I am eating a piece now, and I have to tell you. I was short two eggs so I had to substitute with applesauce, and I used margarine instead of butter. Yet, its STILL good.. surprisingly moist, sweet. You don't need glaze for this one folks.

This cake is fool proof!  There is no reason for the cake to fall, after it cools unless you did something wrong.  It's a heavy cake and it always turns out to perfection.  Use any extracts you like, but have everything at room temperature and it's not too sweet.  This is a cake; not a bread.  The only thing I did differently is I added my eggs to the butter, sugar and cream cheese mixture and then added the extract.  Then, added the flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition on a slow speed.  After you beat in the flour (do not overbeat), pour it into the prepared pan anad then tap the pan on the counter to get out any air bubbles that may have formed.  This cake is the BOMB!

"Rainbow's" beautiful photo of this cake induced me to try it tonight.  I made two of them for an order tomorrow morning and they turned out beautifully.  I wanted mine to look just like Rainbow's, so I followed her suggestion and reduced the sugar to 2 1/4 cups. Great cakes!  Thanks, Polly!

My first pound cake and it turned out wonderful! I reduced the sugar to 2 1/4 cups and it tasted just right! However, my cake broke apart while i tried to take it out of the bundt pan. I think i overmixed the batter. Put alot of money and effort into this cake. It didn't dissapoint me. Every1 should try it!

Wow, this is the best pound cake that I've ever made/tasted!  I used all vanilla extract and it came out great.  A few tips..DO NOT open the open to check on this, as it will fall if you do (as I found out the first time I made this)!  I also used regular flour and reduced each cup by 2 tbspns as others suggested, and make sure that you beat well after adding each egg as it will give you more of an airy texture but yet still have that pound cake consistency.  Fabulous recipe, thank you!

Wonderful cake!  I did reduce the sugar to 2 1/2 cups based on the suggestions of several reviews.  It was perfect, especially since we ate it with strawberries and cool whip!  I didn't have cake flour, so used 2 2/3 cup of all purpose flour.  I baked it in a bundt pan and did have to cook it a few extra minutes.  It looked beautiful and was moist and delicious.

This was delicious.  I did some modifications though.  I added 1/2 t baking soda, 1/2 t baking powder, used 2 sticks of butter and 1 cup sour cream and also added a little extra vanilla & almond extract - to taste.

I was so excited to make this, but after 1 hour 10 min it was nice and brown and beautiful. Within 10 min of removing it from the oven it sank to half it's height.....I flipped it over onto a plate and it looked so pitiful. I beat the cream cheese/butter/sugar for over 5 min with a handheld mixer...maybe that was the problem-the handheld mixer. I also only had 5 eggs, so used 1/4 cup applesauce for the last egg....maybe that was the problem. Oh well I will stick to my lemon pound cake yumm

Wow, this is a good, HEAVY pound cake.  I reduced the sugar to 2.5 cups and the almond to 1/2 tsp (still very almond-y) and increased the vanilla to 1.5 tsp.  No other changes.  I mixed it very well, so it rose beautifully.  I baked it in a bundt pan for 1 hour and 15 min, turned out perfect.

Made this for a party and doubled the recipe.  Decreased sugar (used 5c) and baked in loaf pans as other reviewers recommended.  Perfect flavor with recipe amount of almond extract.  Would also recommend buttering pan, using parchment, and buttering/flouring pan for perfect results.  Great recipe!

Great cake! The only changes I made were adding lemon zest and replacing the almond extract with juice of half a lemon.

I have several pound cake recipes saved, but I think I'll stick with this one.  This one is really dense and reminds me of the cake my mama used to make.  Next time I make it, I will cut back about 1/2 to 3/4 cups of sugar.  It is very sweet.  I, too used lemon extract instead of almond.  I intended to make this a lemon pound cake, but I ended up just adding a lemon glaze.  Overall, good cake and very easy to make (this is my first "homemade" cake! )  p.s.  If you don't have a stand mixer, it may be helpful to invest in one.  Mixing it with a hand mixer really gave my arm a workout! lol

Very good. I used 2.5 cups sugar. I was doubtful, but I think the almond extract adds a "wow" factor as well, but I would only use 1/2 tsp. for a more subtle flavor. This reminded me of angelfood cake. (I think this cake also takes the full 1 hour and 15 minutes, and maybe longer, as there were moist spots when sliced. I think underbaking accounts for the reports of cakes that fell.) For a less heavy texture, beating the egg whites until stiff and folding them in separately would be the answer, but I like the characteristic density.

Fantastic pound cake! I halved the recipe and made it in a loaf pan, baking it for exactly the same amount of time. I made the recipe without any alterations to the ingredients and found the cake to be extremely moist and not too sweet. I'm sure I'll make this many times in the future!

Great recipe! It simply melts in your mouth.  Bakers beware, this is not a traditional heavy/dense pound cake.  This cream cheese pound cake is a wonderful variation of the traditional cake.  I used vanilla, lemon and creme extracts totaling 4 tsp.  I found previously, that more flavoring was required for this recipe.

My husband's favorite dessert is a pound cake "like his mother used to make", as she passed away in 1976, this cake has become increasingly hard to bake.  We married in 1988 and unforturnately none of his sisters had his Mom's recipe.  After 17 years I believe I have found one he thinks is just as good and maybe even better.  I made a couple of changes.  First, his Mom's recipe was for a Pound cake with nuts, so I used 2 cups of flour and 1 cup of chopped pecans.  My nuts were medium chopped, not fine.  I used 1.5 tablespoon of vanilla and left out the almond as I used pecans.  I had to bake 10 minutes longer but the cake is very moist and not at all dry.  I generally find that you have to test a pound cake every 5 minutes after the suggested time using a cake prong, not a toothpick.  Toothpicks do not reach the middle of the cake.  Excellent recipe, the best ever and I am adding this to my family cookbook.  Thanks for sharing.

I thought this recipe was the easiest pound cake I've ever made. VERY Moist. I did have to bake about 15 min. longer than listed. I also didn't have cake flour so I subtracted 2 TBLSP. from each cup of flour and added only 2.5 cups. sugar. Everyone raved at my Women's Bible Study.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but can hardly wait. Very good reviews.  I just had a question about one step in the directions. Are the eggs beaten before they are added alternately with the flour? Don't know it makes much of a difference, just curious.  I appreciate any feedback.  Thanks

I halved this recipe because my intended use was to chunk the poundcake for chocolate fondue for Valentines Day.  I didn't need a whole cake as I had several other dippers.  This was an easy recipe to halve, and I baked it in a loaf pan and it turned out very well and sliced and chunked easily.  I chose this recipe because it looked easy and the ingredient list was already in my refrigerator.  I made a good choice with this one! This was one of the favorite dippers for the chocolate fondue. (Over strawberries and banannas) I think I have a pound cake recipe thats not just good for fondue, but trifle, layered desserts, etc., or just something thats not overly sweet.  I will hang onto this recipe-thanks!

This is a delicious cake! It is sweet, creamy, with a very smooth, fine texture.  I baked it in a rose bundt pan, it came out beautifully, and was gobbled right up with enthusiasm.  It was a little too much batter for a bundt pan, so next time I'll bake about 1 1/2 of batter in another baking dish.

This recipe was the best I have found for pound cake.  It was so flavorful and moist, unlike others I have come across.  I used all three cups of sugar, but I substituted the almond extract for more vanilla.  I took slices of it to work, and the plate was clean within five minutes!  Even my mother enjoyed the cake, and she's hard to please!  As a matter of fact, she has demanded that I make it for Thanksgiving Dinner.  Then, we'll see how Grandma (a.k.a The Cooking Queen) likes it!

Ok as is it is a true pound cake recipe so it is correct in measurements but i tweaked it to my own liking.....i decreased the sugar to 1 1/4 cups and only 1 cup of butter. With these tweaks it was more to my liking; however; if u want a ture dense pound cake this is it. Enjoy.

This is definately not a "good for you" kind of cake but I love it.  It keeps well, freezes well and holds together.  Great for kid's lunches.  (my kids are skinny and need the fat!)  The almond flavouring is a really nice and different flavour here.  I make this as 2 bread loaf sized cakes with the one recipe.

Awesome cake; this is my first pound cake ever, and it was Very easy to make, and DELISH.  rich without making your teeth sing...my coworkers loved it, as well as my family.  I didn't have almond extract, so used a bit of amarretto syrup I had on hand.  For a topping, I simply made a glaze by heating butter and blueberries (frozen ones from parent's garden) in a small sauce pan, adding in orange juice, confectioner's sugar and a small bit of vanilla.  that wasn't too bad either. ; )

I made this cake tonight because I purchased a huge amount of cream cheese to make cheesecake for a party and had some left over. I was in the mood for something sweet but without overpowering glazes or frostings. This cake fit the bill. It's got such a soft texture and just the perfect amount of crustiness around the edges. The flavors were super delicate and needed nothing else added to it. This cake was well liked by everyone in my family. It would also be good served with fresh berries and cream if you want a little fancy. Next time I will substitute the almond extract for orange extract just to play with flavors a bit. All in all a crowd pleaser!!!!

This is the only pound cake I bake with a few minor changes.  I omit the almond flavor and use only lemon instead.  I top it off with a strong citrus glaze and everyone ask me to bake my secret pound cake.  LOL

Amazing! The best pound cake I've ever had! I made it exactly as directed and it turned out absolutely perfect! I love the soft, delicate texture of the inside contrasted with the the almost meringue-like texture of the crust when it's fresh out of the oven. And the vanilla almond flavor is out of the world! I know I'll be making this again and again! I can't wait to try it with lemon and orange flavors!

I have made this cake for over 15 years but a slight variation.  I just juse one tablespoonful of vanilla and beat it with the cream cheese and butter.  I add eggs one at a time and beat well.  I add the cake flour last and just mix until smooth.

I made this for my son for his birthday and it was a HUGE hit! I am making it again for Easter tomorrow. I did follow some of the suggestions (thank you so much!) like 2 1/2 cup sugar, using 1T and 1t vanilla and no almond extract. Frosted, glazed or plain this cake is amazing. Certainly not diet-friendly but certainly worth the slurge!

This is super yummy!! Best ever. I love it just as the recipe states. I've however experimented multiple times with different extracts. My latest using this recipe....I omited the recipes extracts and I added 3 diced fresh apples, a dash of nutmeg, tsp of maple extract, tsp of cinnamon. I thought it was amazing. I have also made this using lemon extract. My favorite though is the almond extract. I always make mine in a bundt cake pan. This recipe is fantastic. You are missing out if you don't try it.

EXCELLENT!!! I put "cookie icing" on it and it was great! Also, instead of almond extract, I put lemon extract. I ALWAYS use UNsalted butter, but I did not have any and thanks to My Husband who convinced me to make it anyway, I decided to make this using salted butter. IT was still fabulous. I guess with all the sugar, extracts, it worked!!! I might even use Salted butter next time, just because it was so perfect. Eventually I'll try both butters to see the difference!

I made this with a few changes...I added tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp baking soda- I believe every cake should have a little leavening.  I also subsituted 1 tsp coconut extract for the almond.  Having said that all other ingredients and measure were exactly the same as written and it made a WONDERFULLY TEXTURED cake with a good flavor. Not too sweet as some had stated.  And for reviewers who said it was too heavy DUH  it IS a Poundcake!  You want light, go have some Angelfood cake. And for those people who complained about 'too much cream cheese flavor' I don't even begin to see where thats coming from, the flavor is great and DUH its a CREAMCHEESE poundcake.  This is a delicious 'Nana' style poundcake.  Nice and moist, you don't need to have milk or coffee, but they are nice acoutrement. This is what I make on Sunday to have for dessert after dinner and snack on through the week. Enjoy!

I think there is no better recipe than this one for a quick pound cake.  I have been making this decadent dandy for nearly thirty years now and it's still a favorite.  Goes with EVERYTHING,-- well, I'd leave gravy off of it....:) 
Hubby can't survive a thanksgiving or birthday without it. 
I'm kind of careless with  this cake because I've yet to wreck it.  I beat the heck out of the butter, cheese, and sugar until super fluffy, then alternate the eggs and flour w/two dashes of salt,and the extract, until it's very light.  When the batter reaches a light creamy color and nearly  coming over the bowl of the KitchenAid,  I dump  the batter in the tube pan and bake.  
I'm no grande dame in the kitchen and anything easy is in my repertoire! 
I've always used a tube pan for this recipe. I've tried it in a Bundt pan and it always seemed to overbake the sides of the cake, making it dry.

Used this recipe to make my daughter a Barbie Doll Cake for her birthday.  Reminded me of pound cake from my childhood. Only change I made was 1/2 tsp almond and 1/2 tsp lemon extract along with the vanilla.  I loved denser texture.  I feel if you are looking for a light and fluffy pound cake you probably don't want a pound cake at all.  Everyone loved it.  Will make again.

This is a very easy recipe, most of the ingredients are usually on hand and the bonus is -- it is absolutely delicious!  A very traditionaly pound cake.  Everyone that tried it asked for the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I loved this cake.  I needed a firm cake for my son's 3-D birthday cake mold and it worked great.  Everyone at the party loved it.  It freezes well too.  I baked it one week before the party and froze it.  I thawed it out the day before the party and iced it.  Turned out perfect.  I served it with ice cream.

This is the BEST pound cake.  I made it recently for a party as a full sheet cake.  I used 1.5 recipes worth for each layer.  I added 2.75 cups of sugar instead of 3 because I was using sweet icing. Also,I added chocolate chips.  It was perfect.  People are still talking about it.

I cut this recipe in half and baked it in a loaf pan.  It was a fantastic pound cake.  I made this for my mother for her birthday, served with strawberries and whipped cream.  Everyone really liked it.  It was a little crumbly on top, but nothing to make you not want to eat it.  Tasted even better the next day.

Excellent pound cake!  I used 2 cups of sugar,only 1/2 tea. of almond extract and 2 1/2 cups all purp. flour.  I read somewhere that for pound cakes you need to beat your butter and sugar for 10-15 minutes.  I did and I really think that's the key to a light texture.  I baked mine in a bundt pan (and 2 mini loaf pans) for about 50 minutes. Everyone loved it!

The best, the best, the absolute best pound cake I have ever made or tasted.  Perfect consistency, sweetness, and baked up with a beautiful "look".  I made it for the first time last week and it was gone in two days.  And I am currently baking up one right now.  What a delightful smell throughout my house.  The only thing I'm trying differently this time, is I'm using two loaf pans with 12 individual servings.

I am usually not one who is a great fan of pound cake, because I am of the feeling that they are too heavy and dry. I was pleasantly surprised at how moist and flavorful this recipe is.  My husband and I both love it. As suggested by others, I did decrease the sugar to 2 1/2 cups.  I substituted lemon extract for the almond extract since I felt this cake would be wonderful with lemon flavor, and it is.  Whatever flavor you desire would work well with this recipe.  I also added l T of lemon zest and l/4 c of toasted chopped pecans. Since I didn't have any cake flour on hand, I used all purpose flour and decreased the amount to 2 1/2 cups.   My baking time was closer to one hour, watch closely.  I drizzled the hot cake with a powdered sugar glaze (powder sugar thinned with water and l tsp lemon extract).  I will be serving this cake to guests tonight with a warm lemon topping as well (lemon pie filling thinned with water or milk  and warmed in the microwave), I can't wait!!

This was delicious Polly.  I received so many compliments on this cake.  I used lemon extract instead of almond, used regular flour and added some grated lime rind to give it a little more flavor.  I'd definitely make this one again.

I thought this was excellent. I made it in a dark nonstick bundt cake pan and it cooked in just the amount of time the recipe calls for at 325. I substituted all purpose flour for the cake flour (for each cup of cake flour, substitute 1 cup all purpose MINUS 2 tablespoons) and used 2 tablespoons vanilla extract no almond extract. I used 1 cup butter flavor Crisco shortening and 1/2 cup Country Crock because I didn't have any butter. It turned out dense and moist and just perfect. I will definitely make this one again.

I didn't enjoy this cake at all. The texture and the taste were not at all what I expected. Too heavy-not at all like a pound cake-more like a bread. It tasted like sugar and butter.

Absolutely a pleaser for everyone in my family (plus our friends!) I added twice the vanilla (2tsp.), plus the indicated amount of almond extract. Then drizzled fresh pureed tart red raspberries over vanilla ice cream on top. An excellent end for a hot summer barbeque menu! It was very easy and have made it several times already. I think I will continue to experiment with different toppings, but truly, this cake can stand on its own eaten just plain! THANK YOU Polly!

This pound cake is superb!  As per other suggestions I added only vanilla, rather than the vanilla and almond extract (I am not a fan of almond flavoring), and it came out perfectly!  Others said they thought it was too sweet, but my husband and I thought it was great!  Thanks!

I love this recipe.  It's so quick and easy and comes out great.  I always make at least a double batch, sometimes a triple --- I bake the extra batches in foil loaf pans and freeze them.  It's great to have on hand.  I also send a loaf or two out of every batch home with my boss -- I included this cake in a basket of home-baked goodies last Christmas, and his family loved it!!

Tastes chemical. Is it wrong to put too much extract? I put in a 9" cake tin & didn't know the center still wet. Only managed to re-bake but kind of too late. Ate some, but don't really like too much extract. Hv never had baked so failure b4. Looks like I hv to delete from my recipe box.

I am getting ready to make a birthday cake for my mom, who is turning 65 in a couple of weeks.  I needed a cake that had a great, simple, clean flavor and a nice, tight crumb for decorating.  I decided to make this recipe exactly as written the first time around, and I wasn't disappointed.  I couldn't even wait for the thing to cool off completely before nibbling at the crunchy brown top... sooo good.  I know for my own personal tastes, this is money.  But I will take some other bakers' recommendations and reduce the sugar to 2 1/2 cups next time.  This recipe has endless possibilities for flavor combinations - I can't wait to play around with it!  This is definitely the cake for my mom's birthday, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it's a cake that will have its own place in my everyday recipe collection as well.  Great recipe!

This cake has a lovely texture!! I added lemon extract in place of the almond. Within 24 hours it was gone!! I am not kidding but I am a wee bit embarrassed to say my husband and I were the only ones at home .He kept raving about it. I will bake this again. Thank you for sharing.

This is my husband's favorite cake.  Like banana bread, we think it gets better the next day.  This is heavy and dense and everything you want a pound cake to be.  I have found that the recipe also works with sour cream instead of cream cheese.  I can't tell the difference, but I guess some people can.

Perfect pound cake. The texture and density was what a pound cake should be. I made exactly as the recipe but I thought the almond extract was a bit too strong.  Next time I will try it without. I baked it for 1-1/4 hr and the top was a bit wet still. I'm not sure if it's because I used a Stoneware  bundt which may have needed an extra 5-10 minutes.

So  Good.  I took this to a funeral luncheon and had several family members of the deceased to call and ask for the recipe.  I replaced 1/2 of cr.cheese with sour cream and vanilla extract.  You will enjoy this pound cake without any doubt.

This was a good cake but not the best I've ever tasted. After reading the reviews, I cut the sugar down to 2 cups and I thought it was still to sweet. Next time I will use 1.5 cups and use less almond extract.

OH MY GOSH! This is so good. I used a little cream icing on top. I change it around a bit. I love almond. So I did 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 tablespoon of almond. It taste like wedding cake. REALLY GOOD......AND I don't like pound cake. My husband does.

OMG! This is one of the best cakes I've ever made.  Like others, I used 4 oz of sour cream because I like the flavor.  I also reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 cups.  I also used an Angel Food pan, due to the large amount of batter.  My husband came out to the kitchen and remarked that it was the largest pound cake he'd ever seen.  Served it with strawberries and whipped cream, but love it plain as well.  The outer crunch is a great texture combined with the moist softness of the inside.  

This pound cake blew our socks off!

This was very good. I took it to a cookout and it was the most popular dessert. I made as listed except I reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 cooks as other suggested. It has a great texture.  I made a cream cheese glaze to go over it, and that worked quite nicely.

This was my first time making a pound cake so I took the advice of several reviews.  I used 2.5 cups of sugar, cut the almond extract to 1/2 tsp and increased the vanilla by 1/2 tsp.  I used two loaf pans and had to bake for 1 hour and 20 minutes for the middle to be done.  Delicious!  I may use the full teaspoon of almond extract next time, but this is only going to be a cake only for special occassions for me because of all the butter and eggs!

Wow... I've never made a pound cake.  This is fabulous.  Did the lemon extract instead of almond and substitute flour thing. I'm a gadget person so used my divided rectangle cake pan.  It is larger than the advertised brownie one.  Came out perfect.  Only needed to bake 45 mins at 325  in my convection oven.  I love to make cupcakes so will try next time.  Great recipe to get creative with flavors.

This is an amazing pound cake!  I took other users suggestions and reduced sugar to 2 1/2 cups.  Also, instead of almond extract I used coconut extract.  My whole family loves this cake!  I've made it several times now with great results!  Thanks for the recipe!

MMM this is very good. I added lemon instead of almond. My first try at this, so i might be missing the moistness as i use a split oven, and used the top oven. I didn't realize it would rise so high..lol So we had to scrape off the cake from the burners and replace in the lower oven an extra 20 minutes. *It was still mushy in the middle so we transferred to the lower oven. Next time i'll use the lower oven only for this recipe. The cake is still quite tasty so i'm still happy with it.:)

I absolutely think this is by far the best pound cake recipe ever..I have played around with flavors and I like to add some lemon juice to it and hold back on the almond..I usually do about 1 tsp lemon and 1/4 tsp. almond and 1 tsp. vanilla.  I also have done it in a cold oven and it tends to give the cake the crust I like for the top. then 325  Make sure you grease your pan well and flip to top to enjoy the crust.  We take this to the beach and enjoy fresh strawberries and fresh peaches for our desserts throughout the week!  LOVE IT!

I tried this twice and just couldn't get it right.  The flavor of the batter is wonderful, but my final product left a lot to be desired.  The first attempt fell.  I thought it might have been the cake flour I used, so I tried again with regular flour.  The second attempt was a little better, but not much.  Both seemed to be very eggie for me.  I like a heavy cake, but this was too much.  However my husband liked it.  I'll try one of the variations next time.

This poundcake was absolutely delicioso!  I read some of the other reviews of people who added sour cream to the recipe.  Because I was afraid of the cake being too dry, I added 3 T of milk.  I'm not sure if this helped the moisture or not, but it was very tasty, delicious, and incredible.  I am going to asky  mysister, Adora, to make it for my husband's 40th birthday.

Came out nothing like the photo....it actually resembled a brick! (in bundt form of course) It definitely needs a levining agent (the eggs just don't cut it).

This was the best pound cake I have ever tasted, and it was my first homemade pound cake as well. It got rave reviews at work and my co-workers even fought over who could take some home!!! Will definitely make again.

This cake is awesome! I am by no means a baker, however this cake recipe has inspired me! :)  I have made it three times within a week.  I used all purpose flour and lemon extract in place of the cake flour and almond extract because I wanted the lemon cream cheese effect.  My family and friends loved it.  I couldnt seem to keep any left more than a day. I shared the experience with my co-worker.  So now I will be making another one tonight for her. I hope she want be sorry! :)  Thanks for sharing!  We Love it!

I just made this cake and it is excellent.  It has a gorgeous texture.  I did reduce the sugar to 2 1/2 cups.  This will become a standard for me.  Perfect!

This was an easy recipe to make. I used lemon extract instead of vanilla and almond extracts. I also added some lemon zest. I added a lemon glaze w/fresh lemon juice and lemon zest. yummy!

This was the second pound cake recipe I have made and I absolutely love this recipe! The cake is so delicate and delicious, I beat it with a hand mixer  and it fluffed it up nicely. I baked it in two loaf pans and baked them for an hour and 10 minutes and they are a perfect golden brown. I did not have cake flour so I took others advice by subtracting 6 tablespoons of the flour and I only used 2 1/2 cups of sugar, I did not want it to be too sweet. I had great hopes for this recipe and I couldn't be happier with the outcome. Oh and this is a great breakfast with fresh berries!

This recipe tasted great! I followed the advice of others and cut sugar to 2.5 cups, reduced almond extract to 1/2 tsp., and used 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Used strictly cake flour and baked in a Bundt pan. Many reviews suggested beating this cake to death. If you want a dense pound cake, don't over beat it! My cake was more spongy because I beat it so much, similar to angel food cake/pound cake cross.

I've been making this recipe for a couple years now and it always turns out perfect. I use a rose bundt pan which is approx. 9" across. I fill it to about 1 inch from the top and pour the rest in a loaf pan. With the smaller pan, cooking time is closer to an hour.  Absolutely fantastic by itself but I think it would be too sweet with any type of icing. Stick with a dusting of powdered sugar or berries/cream. Yummy!

This recipe is fabulous. Delicate wonderful flavor, beautiful crumb. I tweaked it a bit, I added only 1 tsp. of vanilla, and one 1 tsp. of lemon extract. I also added a pinch of baking powder. I have found through the years that pound cakes are super easy and super forgiving. The only thing really important is ROOM TEMPERATURE ingredients, mixing the butter/sugar until light and fluffy. Start the cake in a cold oven and don't check on it very often. Prior to this I had made buttermilk or sour cream pound cakes and my family loved them, but they raved over this one and I think that this one will be the one I make from now on.

This pound cake was really great!  I made it for strawberry shortbread and it beautifully dense and moist.  Next time I'll make it just to have by itself!  I also only used 2 1/2 cups sugar and that was plenty.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 cup of the butter to make it a little less fattening.  :-)  Turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was THE BEST pound cake I have ever made.  My only changes was that I substuited with cake flour and I used 2 tablespoons of vanilla flavoring(totally by accident) and it turned out great.  The outside was crispy and the inside was moist and creamy.  This recipie is defitintely a keeper!

Cake was very moist but the crust come off. I was able to make 10 mini loaves and I redid the cake and made with mini bundt pan instead... I agree that the cream cheese was too over powering for a pound cake put the taste is great...

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  I have made it many times. I recently made it for a Christmas luncheon at work and it got rave reviews.  However, I left out the almond extract (by choice) and lowered the temperature in my oven to 300 degrees.  When I baked it at 325 it came out too dark and it seemed dry.

This recipe, with a high rating, looked quite promising. Unfortunately, for our family's taste and my expectations of this pound cake, it was a bit of a disappointment. 
All the ingredients were at the proper temperature. I made sure the butter and sugar were creamed (using a KitchenAid mixer) to a light fluffy texture. The recipe was followed to the "T" and the cake ended up being on the dry....almost crumbly dry side and rather bland. 
In order to give it some interest and additional flavor I made a lemon glaze with a tablespoon of unsalted butter, 1 cup of confectionary sugar and two tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice. After drizzling it over the pound cake and letting the glaze harden we tasted it again. Still not up to par as far as pound cakes go in the moistness department.
I wouldn't make it again.

I thought this cake was pretty good.  The texture and crust very nice, but it could have been sweeter.  Next time I will add more sugar.  I used only vanilla extract as I didn't have almond.  Since I have a very hot oven, I reduced the temperature to 225 for an hour and then 250 for another hour.

I love this pound cake.  I always add all vanilla extract and no almond extract and it turns out great every time.  The cooking time was exactly right, too.  Great easy favorite!  Just make sure that you thoroughly beat in the eggs and flour to get the fluffiness you need!

i've had this recipe before, and i could live off it. i hope people aren't expecting the texture of this cake to be like regular spongy cakes. it's great toasted in the morning or at night with ice cream. the lemon and confectioner's sugar glaze is one of my favorites. one trick that has helped me make this cake is to microwave the butter and cream cheese just enough to soften it. i got the recipe from my aunt, and the crust on the top is my family's favorite part. it's the perfect cake!

FANTASTIC!!!!  Reading the other reviews caused me to reduce sugar a bit and cut the almond in half but I may be sorry when I refrigerate half of it (if it lasts that long!!!) to "ice" with whipped topping and then sliced berries since refrigeration tends to reduce flavor.  What a wonderfully moist, fine-textured cake and delicious right out of the oven!  I have made sour cream pound cakes for years and was a little concerned about no baking soda -- SO not needed!  Also, this may work perfectly without room temperature ingredients but I have always set mine out 6 hours or overnight for the tenderest of cakes; the butter and cream cheese were so soft that the batter was not too heavy on my beloved old mixer. THANKS FOR A NEW FAMILY FAVORITE!

This cake has very good flavor, everyone loved it and I had requests for the next occassion that I could make it.  The only variation that I did was added a bit of lemon juice to the batter and then glazed the cake with a lemon curd glaze and a dust of powdered sugar.  The only thing that I thought could make this better is if it was a bit more moist, mine was a touch dry, other than that...PERFECT!

I wanted a pound cake like the one I grew up with from Sara Lee. Other than not having the yellow color it was similar down to the texture and brown crust. I used the metric version of the recipe, neufchatel cheese and decreased sugar to 550g (may try 500g next time). Baked as directed in two 9x5 loaf pans.

This recipe was very good. I served it with strawberries and whipped cream, but it is also good by itself. I did half the recipe, and baked it in a loaf pan for about 50 minutes. It turned out very moist, with just the right amount of sweetness.

Great recipe!  I have made this more than 1/2 dozen times and it always turns out great.  I usually cut the recipe in half and bake it in one loaf pan.

I made this cake last year for a Christmas party at work, and everyone raved over this cake.  This cake is so moist it will melt in your mouth.  The almond and vanilla flavors just gives it enough of taste.My whole family loves it.  This is the best pound cake that I have ever made.  Making a few for family gatherings this year. Thanks.

This is an ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL cake!!!!!!!
I made this and everyone who ate it said it was the best they ever had.  I have a friend that said she would no longer use an old passed down recipe that she would now use this recipe.  I cannot begin to tell you how rich and moist it is and it DOES literally melt in your mouth.  I will always use this recipe and no other, because I honestly think I have the best recipe ever!!!!  WARNING:  You will want to hide this cake, all for yourself!!!!

I made this cake over the Christmas holiday and it was fantastic!!  The almond flavoring REALLY brings out the other flavors in the cake.  The texture was perfect and the taste was perfect.  You guess it, the finicky 2 year old LOVED it!!  Will definately keep this one in the old permanent recipe files!!

I baked this cake just as specified and it is the most delicious pound cake I've ever tasted. It's moist, too.  I get lots of compliments on it whenever I serve it.  It's fine by itself and it's also really good with berries and whipped cream.

My only problem is that the top is crumbly and tends to flake off when I cut it, but that might be because my oven is very slow and I'm not sure I've got it at the right temperature.  I made it once substituting Lighter Bake for half the butter and it was just as good.

This was my first time making pound cake from scratch and it was amazing!  I made them in loaf pans, they baked for about 1 hour.  This cake was so soft & moist.  We topped them with strawberries & whipped cream, YUMMY!  I recommend this to everyone!  Thanks Polly.

This recipe was very good!!!!!! I fixed it last night before I went to sleep and left my husband to take it out of the pan.  Once I got up this morning 1/3 of the cake was gone and I remember him waking me up about 12 in the morning going out to get milk to go with this cake!  I will keep this nearby :-)  Thanks

After all the great reviews about this cake I was disapoointed with the results of my efforts! The cake came out ok and I will probably not make it again. Even 2 cups of sugar was too sweet. The cake had a crust and was very dense. Soft texture but not at all moist. More like a dense bread. Also, even a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract was too much.

This cake is DELICIOUS!  I made it tonight and it got YUM-YUM reviews!  For some fun and to satisfy the chocolate lover in me, I mixed in chocolate chips to the batter.  I added less sugar as some suggested and more vanilla since I didn't have any almond extract.  I may substitute with lower fat ingredients next time and see how that goes.

It was delicious. Very nice texture; crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. So proud of it. So easy to make. I would cut down half for the sugar though.

I tried this as my first homemade cake, and it was PERFECT!  I admit I am not a baker, I will burn frozen cookings. But I couldn't believe how beautiful this cake turned out. It was delicious, I did ommit the almond abstract, & added extra vanilla. It was delicious!

Great pound cake! Crumb texture is very fine thanks to the usage of cake flour. It has a pound cake yet cheesecake like texture... a bit reminiscent of an Asian style cheese cake. I used only 2 cups of sugar and half the amount of both vanilla and almond extract. I didn't put in the eggs and flour alternately, I simply ended up beating the eggs in one after another, and then once all the eggs were incorporated (and the batter was fluffy as a cloud), sifted in the flour, and a half tsp of baking powder just to ensure that it would rise well, and beat all the dry ingredients in on a low speed setting. This is a lovely pound cake with minimal changes, save reducing the sugar. My cake didn't sink very noticeably after taking it out of the oven.

This is the absolute best cake recipe ever!!  I followed the recipe exactly and it is not to sweet as some other reviewers wrote.  Trust me, this recipe is perfect as written.  I do use pure almond extract from King Arthur's so I don't know if that makes a difference.  I creamed the butter, sugar and cream cheese in my Kitchen Aid stand mixer for 5 minutes.  Than using the shield over the bowl I kept adding the flour and eggs alternating between the two while never shutting off the mixer.  I baked in my convection oven at 300 degrees for exactly 75 minutes in a bundt cake pan.  It came out perfect, nice crunch on the outside and to die for moistness inside.

I made this cake for Christmas for my future in-laws and it was a hit! I was really nervous because this was my 3rd attempt. I was determined to get it right! The key to perfecting this cake is the temperature of your oven. I had to increase to 350 for 1hr then decrease to 325 for an additional 35min. Be patient and make sure to check by using tooth pick.(I used a knife) looks can be deceiving! the last time I made this cake, it was perfect on the outside but gooey on inside but after sitting for a day it was good and my nephews loved it! This is my favorite pound cake recipe. I made a glaze using fresh lemon juice and powered sugar. I will be trying different extracts and try added fresh berries when in season. Thanks for sharing!

My go to recipe is a sour cream pound cake I've made for years. It always comes out wonderfully dense & moist. However I always wanted to see if a cream cheese pound cake would be any better. Well, I won't say it's better but it's most definitely just as good. Very, dense velvety consistancy w/ that crunchy outside that I love. I did add 1/4tsp. baking powder & 1/4cup of milk and it was delicious. It took a bit longer to bake than my sour cream recipe but that may be due to the milk I added. F.Y.I If you don't have cake flour use 3/4 cup all purpose flour + 2tbls a.p. flour + 2tbls.cornstarch for each cup of flour the recipe calls for. Your results will be just as good with this substitute.

I followed the recipe as written.  It's very tasty but I wish there was more about the baking process. This was the first time to bake a pound cake and using a bunt pan.  I did spray down my pan but I filled it out too much. I wasn't sure how much it would rise. The increase was about 15 -20% which over flowed the bunt pan and landed in the bottom of my oven. No biggie, except for the smoke it created . :)  The baking  time was longer than the 1 hour and 15 minutes.  For me it was closer to 1 1/2 hour.  Then, I couldn't get the silly cake out of the bunt pan. :(   I gave up and just cut slices of pound cake out of the pan.  It tasted delicious.  I will make this again.  However, I will follow the lead of the other reviewers who split the receipt into two pans.  I would have given the recipe 5/5 stars but the baking directions need to explained more for us newbies. :)

I thought the recipe was good. I have made it before and this time was better. My butter, eggs, and cream cheese sat on the kitchen counter all day. I took a great point from another person who said make sure you mix everything well then incorporate the flour instead of mixing it well. I did add lemon flavor and squeezed juice from an orange on top of the hot cake. Very good!

A good, and not too complicated, pound cake. Cooking time is perfect - don't overdo it! The first time, I let the butter and cream cheese soften to room temperature. I think this made it lose some "fluff."
The texture and consistency was much better the second time, when I used cold ingredients and had the flour and eggs pre-measured out into separate bowls so I could combine the ingredients more quickly. It made a difference!
My changes: reduced sugar to 2c., used only vanilla (didn't have almond), and used the 1/3 less fat cream cheese.

Wow this was absolutely awesome.  Did not change a thing....which is odd for me.   The cake has been devoured. So moist and rich.  No toppings needed.  They just detract from the wonderful taste.

This was Wonderful, GREAT! I  did not give it 5 stars because it lacked one item I use with all my pound cakes (Sour Cream). Great tasting! I did use vanilla and coconut as I do not like the almond taste.  I will make again, Merry Christmas

I love the flavor and consistency of this pound cake.  However, I have a mystery: I baked my cake in a bundt pan and the top of the cake just fell and crumbled to pieces.  Too much air?  I used a stand mixer and did what others suggested: I whipped the butter, cream cheese and sugar till fluffy, then alternated the flour and eggs.  I consider myself a pretty good home baker and hoped to the a result would look like the picture...but no luck.  Any advice?  I also need a better release spray than the canola spray is used...I did have some sticking to the pan.  I'm going to try the cake again. Practice makes perfect!

other than it being too sweet, we loved it!  I'll try it next time with 2 1/4 cup sugar instead of 3 cups.  Next time I'll also try vanilla or lemon extract instead of the almond for something different.

Sounds like a winner.  Can you use a 10 inch tube pan to cook this and if so how long would you cook it and at what temperature.  I always enjoy reading the posted comments as I learn so much from them. Thanks Nanny Fran

I have made this pound cake twice.  They turned out great both times.  To give your cake a little taste of color add yellow food coloring. (Not alot, maybe 3 to 5 drops).  I only used 2 1/2 cups of sugar and instead of almond, I used lemon.  Thank you ladies very much for your advice, it was very helpful.

This recipe is the epitome of pound cake. I did not use the almond extract and replaced with additional vanilla.  I used a lemon glaze recipe from my Granny, but the cake doesn't need it.

I followed suggestions of decreasing the sugar and adjusting the flavorings.  The adjustments made this near perfect!  Next time I will decrease the sugar a bit more..it was still plenty sweet. It doesn't last long though!  Thanks for the recipe!

First of all I went exactly by recipie.  Cake was way too sweet! I am not sure if the other reviewers noticed but it says 1 TABLEspoon of vanilla which equals to about 3 teaspoons!  Cake was a weird texture and somewhat dry compared to the pound cakes I have made without cream cheese.  Sorry to say cake went in the trash after 4 people tasting.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would glady do so! Extremely tasty recipe. I follow the advise of other reviews and subtracted 6 tbsp of flour from the 3 cups I had, and I also added like a 1/4 cup of buttermilk (didn't have actual buttermilk so I added 2 tbsp of white vinegar to 1/4 cup milk) and it came out great! The hubby bit his fingers TWICE on one slice. Thanks for a lifetime recipe.

This is a very good recipe, I have used often.  However, I have also found that this recipe is good for trifles (when you cut a cake up and mix in fruit and cream) and really compliments fruit dishes.

LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!  I have made it many times now - just like it says (with room temp butter, eggs & cream cheese whipped - then add flour). I made with two loaf pans, 325° for 1 hour and 20 mins.  THANK YOU for this perfect pound cake!!!

I was looking forward to having this cake as a part of my non-traditional Christmas dessert offerings.  My intentions were to make whipped cream and strawberries as well as a caramel pecan drizzle for slices of this cake. Unfortunately, I love the texture, but I used a loaf pan and it rose and cracked, got crunchy around the edges and what not.  My son loved the crusty parts. (he said it tasted like a fortune cookie). This cake is way too sweet when made exactly as the directions say. and way too much trouble for what it's worth. As a future Culinary Arts student, I almost let my failing at this recipe get my spirits down, but alas- my quest continues for the perfect pound or 7up cake.

This is sooo good.  I substituted Smart Balance for the butter, used organic, unrefined sugar and whole wheat flour and it was fabulous.  I will make it again.

The flavor was great but the top of the cake cracked, it may have been about six pieces on the top of the cake! I've never baked with cake flour and can't imagine what happened! I will try this again, all other reviews were great!

wow.  great.. my only changes were 2.5 cups sugar and I have a container of sugar that I add 2 vanilla beans to.  Stir/shake it occassionaly.  After a month or so it flavours the sugar so well.  the vanilla taste was so pronounced.  Then use it over and add more sugar.  after 6 months is still great for baking.  also used van extract in recipie.  my family LOVED this cake.  thanks   :)

This cake is awesome! This is my third time making it in two weeks. I do subsitute the almond extract for vanilla, and reduce the sugar by 3/4 to 1 cup, and it is still plenty sweet for me. My whole family loves it! Thanks for the great recipe!

Every time I make this cake everyone loves it.  By far the best Pound Cake because it stays moist and has a perfect sad spot when baked.  Everyone always wants the recipe.  Thanks so much for the great recipe.

The cream cheese is what gave this recipe the kick. I didn't add any nutmeg extract because I didn't have any so I just replaced it with additional vanilla extract. I baked the cake in a round 9" pan and cooked it at 325 degrees F for 1 hr and 50 min. I checked the cake with a tooth pick and it was clean, but the cake "appears" uncooked, is that the cream cheese? I doesn't taste uncooked, it's delicious! For the last 30 min I placed foil over the pan to avoid the top from burning.

Awesome Pound Cake! Just the perfect denseness. Alittle too much almond for my taste. Will cut that in half or omit that next time.

Very good recipe, very simple, I made two loaves of pound cake, and everyone love it.  One thing for sure, a very heavy cake to hold.  Compare it to a store brand and found theirs a lot lighter.  But still the same, it was excellent, will definitely pass the recipe on.  thanks

this pound cake definitely doesn't taste like sara lee's, which i think most people are looking for. i thought it was too dense though, and to me and my family it tasted more like moon cake. i did like the taste, but am looking for a recipe that makes a fluffy, light pound cake.

I baked this in a dark bunt pan and the suggested baking time was WAY too long. Mine was done in under 45 mins. The flavor was good, but it was so dense that had I dropped it on my foot, I would have had to make a trip to the ER. Next time I'll use 2 fewer eggs.

"WORTH DYING FOR"...This is identical to my mother's recipe for pound cake and she has made it for years. We also call it the funeral cake because she always takes it to someone's home during times of mourning. I think she may have found it in Southern Living magazine. Nothing beats it.  Try it for breakfast, warmed up in the toaster oven with a bit of butter and simply fruit black-rasberry spread on it. DIVINE!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Definitely take note of other reviews.  Beat the butter, cream cheese and sugar until nice and fluffy (about 5 minutes).  Should you halve the recipe the following modifications may be helpful: use 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract (in lieu of the almond extract) and cook the cake in a 9X5 loaf for 1 hour and 15 minutes.

I have been making this exact (almost) recipe for years now, given to me by my sister-in-law.  She called it "Crusty Cream Cheese Pound Cake" because it does, indeed, make a nice crusty, crunchy crust.  (The only difference with my recipe is 1/2 cup of the butter is 1/2 cup of shortening, I prefer the butter shortening over regular, and it doesn't call for the almond flavoring).  When I cut the recipe in half and make it in a loaf pan, the crust rises up above the bread and breaks off in huge pieces.  Does anyone have a reason why this might be happening and what I can do to prevent it?  Thanks!

This recipe is amazing. I am used to a traditional pound cake which is sweet and dense......hence the name "pound cake." I've made this recipe numerous times, however I've made cakes in the past that called for almond and vanilla extracts and I've never liked that combination, so I used lemon and vanilla or just vanilla instead. I don't think this recipe is to sweet with the 3 cups of sugar as a matter of fact I've even made it with 3 & 1/2 cups of sugar and my family (including the diabetics) loved it....I give this recipe 5+ stars and for a variation; you can substitute sour cream for the cream cheese and it's still awesome.

LOVE this cake!  It's dense, which is I like!  Very easy to make and tastes great!  Very homemade!:)
The only change I made was an extra 1/4 tsp almond extract and I greased the pan with butter and sprinkled sugar!

I have also made this in a 10" cheesecake pan and it's great!  Big!

I made this cake for Mother's Day.  It was a resounding success...One of the best I've ever tried.  Thank you for this great recipe.  As a side note, I didn't have any almond flavoring, so I increased the vanilla extract (real) to compensate.  Great cake!

This cake turned out very good, nice and moist and full of flavour. I cut it in half and filled it with Apricot flavoured Buttercream then covered it with  rolled Fondant I turned blue and applyed edible lustre to add shimmer. I topped it with a teddy I made using Marzipan. The cake held up well for a few days especially since it was coated in Fondant. Thanks.

This cake is delicious! I did reduce the sugar to 2.5 cups due to personal taste preference. This cake is a lot easier to make if you have a stand mixer so it can whip the butter/cream cheese quicker and make it light and fluffy. For my oven, 1h + 15 minutes was just perfect. Next time I will try this again replacing different extracts or using only vanilla. I ended up making a glaze with confectioners sugar and milk and then sprinkled slivered almonds on top.

This was my very first pound cake and I was quite pleased with it.  I reduce all ingredients by 1/3 because many people mentioned spill-over as a problem and reduced the sugar by even more and still thought it was just a wee bit too sweet.  But, overall this was this reciped had the taste and texture that I was looking for.

Extremely easy to make! Followed the directions exactly and used PAM Cooking spray in a bundt pan. I also made sure to beat in the ingredients completely. 

The cake was gone in no time!

Great recipe!  This is a "classic" pound cake.  Everything you want in texture and flavor.  I did have to bake about 15 minutes longer, and it almost overflowed my bundt pan as it was baking.  Next time I would make a few cupcakes on the side.  I got many great reviews.  It would be wonderful with warm fruit topping and whipped cream!

This is a great recipe but I find that the temperature is not correct.  My cake was not cooked after 1 hour and 15 min, I turned to 200C after that, it was cooked after 15 mins.

Was looking for a cake to use up some cream cheese and ran across this.  This pound cake is excellent.  I have baked it about 5 times already and have one in the oven as I type.  I have also made it in loaves.  It is one of my favorite recipes.  It certainly deserves a 5 star rating.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though it didn't turn out right, and it had nothing to do with the recipe.  The taste is awesome!  I don't typically use almond extract in any of my baking, because I find it overpowering.  However, it works perfectly for this cake.  First problem, don't use a bundt pan it's not big enough for this.  Don't know what I was thinkin'.  The other problem has to do with ingredients.  I'm living in France and have not been able to produce a decent pie, cake or any type of baked dessert.  And I'm using recipes that I've been using for years.  Sooo, the only thing I can think of is the makeup of the ingredients must be different than what is available in the states.  I am going to try this one again though when I return.  Hopefully with better results.

I would give this more stars if I could. I am ALWAYS asked to bring this pound cake to parties/gatherings. I have even substituted the almond extract for lemon extract. Then drizzled a lemon/butter/powdered sugar glaze over it while still warm. DELISH! Cannot thank you enough for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Very good.  I halfed everything and made it in a loaf pan instead.  Took approx. the same amount of time to cook.  Next time I'll add a little less sugar, as others suggested.

The recipe makes two wonderful pound cakes in loaf pans. The taste and texture of cake went past what I was expecting. Only change was sugar, used 2 3/4 cup. Perfect pound cake, extra fine crumb. Used with chocolate fountain at party. This was the first item gone at the party for  15 people.

SO GOOD AND RICH FLAVORED!  I did add an extra teaspoon of almond extract b/c I love the flavor it adds to food... I also used 4 whole eggs and enough egg whites to make up for the other 2 eggs.  The cake is so good and moist!  I made it for our wedding anniversary and my husband, who's not a sweet freak like me, has already had 3 pieces today.

I have used this recipe for quite a while now and ALWAYS get asked for the recipe.  I never thought I'd find a pound cake that wasn't dry.  This one is not.  It's perfect with berries and lightly sweetened whipped cream.  Thanks for sharing.

This is GREAT! I didn't have to change a thing. It turns out great even i left it in the oven for almost 2 hrs!!!!! (i actually programed the clock and went out but it was not working)

the outside was a little crisp and thick but the inside was very rich yet soft and light in texture...

I love it... i think i will make them the cup cake next time.

I was very disappointed in this pound cake. The tsp. of almond extract was overpowering.  The cake tasted like flour and almond extract. Sorry, I won't make this again.

Excellent flavor and consistency.  I too cut down on the sugar (to 2 1/2 cups) and it tasted excellent, though I believe it would have tasted just as good with the full amount.  My hips just love me better this way.

Great recipe!! I have made it several times and it has always been a hit!  I found the recipe to be too much for a bundt pan alone, so I fill the bundt pan and 2/3 full and put the rest into a mini loaf pan.  A great idea if you are potlucking and want to keep a little for yourself!

This is similar to a recipe I have, but with cream cheese, so I tried it:  This recipe produced a drier, less dense version, and I couldn't taste the cream cheese at all.  Anyone making this cake might try adding a small can of evaporated milk, cutting back to 5 eggs, , and substituting 1 stick (or 1/2 cup) butter flavored Crisco for one of the sticks (or 1/2 cup) butter.  That's how this recipe deviated from the recipe I have (and, of course, the recipe I have doesn't have cream cheese).  I won't make this one again.

Very good, very moist, I made two at the same time, and both of them came out perfect.  I did cut down the sugar to 2-1/2 cups and is perfect sweetnees for my family.  I will make this again and again.

Very heavy/dense pound cake.  I normally don't care for pound cakes, but this one is excellent!  I used margarine instead of butter, and all purpose flour rather than cake flour and didn't have any problems.  It's a THICK batter though, so it's not for a "whimpy"  mixer.  Excellent!  I will keep this recipe to use again and again!

I have made many pound cakes in my time, they were all really hard to make and very time consuming. This Pound Cake was so easy to make and really good. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Very moist dense pound cake.  Just what a pound cake should be.  I have made this cake several times and it always turnes out well.  I have added toasted peacans & chocolate chips before and it was a hit with the kids.

Excellent cake!  I was looking for a good dense pound cake but yet moist...this was it!  I did make 2 changes:  Instead of 1 1/2 C butter, I did 1 C butter & 1/2 C shortening.  Also on the sugar, I cut it back to 2 1/2 cups.

My 70-year-old husband (who has never really cooked or baked anything other than steaks on the grill) made this cake the other day for a group. He received many compliments and we had nothing left to take home. The slight almond flavor was a nice change from the common lemon or vanilla flavors.

This cake is amazing, moist and delicious. My boys and hubby love it and have asked for it almost every weekend since I first discovered it a few months ago. I've made no modifications to the recipe. My hubby has always eaten his pound cake in a bowl with milk poured over it, which sounds odd but is delicious!

I made this cake for a party and it was a big hit and gone by the end of the party.  Even the kids were eating it.  I read most of the reviews and was a little nervous with it but it made a beautiful batter that was easy to work with my old ancient hand mixer.  The only problem I had was while it was in the oven it rose about a half inch higher than my tube pan.  It didn't overflow but when I took it from the oven it deflated slightly over the top of my pan which made it a little uneven.  No big deal.  I know now not to put as much batter into my pan because I will definitely make it again.  I can't wait to try variations (lemon, marble, etc).

This is very tasty.  I have made it multiple times, and it turns out wonderful every time.  I set my eggs, butter, and cream cheese out and let them come to room temp before making the cake.  I think that is the secret to it!  I have made with almond extract, but I have also replaced almond with more vanilla and it was super!

I have made this recipe 3 times.  Everytime it has worked out beautifully.  The crumb is very fine and velvety .  Melt in your mouth quality.  The fragrance while baking is wonderful.  The cake batter takes on many extract flavors very well, and I have used vanilla, lemon and orange.

Wonderful pound cake. Very rich. I put 3/4 of batter in bundt pan and the other 1/4 in a loaf pan. It was still a bit difficult to completely bake the bundt cake.

This was awesome.  However, instead of adding the almond extract, I added 2 tsp vanilla flavor, 1 tsp lemon flavor, and 1 tsp of butter flavor per my auntie's recommendation.

Cake came out great and only involved a couple of ingredients; however, it was extremely tiresome to make because it was so thick and I was constantly stirring.

Love this recipe, made it many times now.  The only change I make is using a teaspoon or 2 of lemon juice instead of the almond.  I use a lemon juice, powdered sugar glaze on top.  YUM!

I just love this cake!!! It was so simply to make. As for the sugar, I tried it with 2cups and I made it again with 3cups. Both we good but I prefer it just as the recipe given. 
  This is truly a wonderful good old fashion pound cake, texture and taste.  My family and friends loved it.

My cake didn't turned out well. It took 1hr and 30mins to bake and it is way too sweet. I should have reduced the sugar content to 2 cups instead of 3.

Excellent cake!! Simple to make, it actually baked in about 5 minutes less than in recipe. (Ovens will vary) My entire family thought it was wonderful. My husband likes his with strawberry sauce, but I think it is fine just as is.  Either way, it's a keeper.

UPDATE:  I wrote this review several years ago.  I recently tried to make this cake in a silicone pan and it did NOT turn out near as well.  Just a tip for other bakers, stick with the good ol'fashioned metal pans.  The silicone doesn't create the yummy crusty top (bottom) when inverted, and it seemed to be more dry yet not quite done.  We LOVED this cake.  My father-in-law said it was the best pound cake he had ever had.  We tried it with Strawberries and cream, but it was to good just by itself.  We'll have to find something else to eat with the strawberries.  Thank you for this recipe.

This recipe is great. i decorate cakes and most people come to me because this is the recipe i use for all my decorated cakes. It is very moist but yet has an excellant surface crust to work on. The taste is far way better than any box or store bought bakery made cake!!

Great cake but I thought it had a little too much almond extract.  I always use a tad less now.

This is a very tasty treat!  Note that the cake has a very strong almond flavor.  If you prefer, you may decrease the almond extract and increase the vanilla. But it is a very good cake.  I got several requests for the recipe.

To save myself from eating the entire ring, I make 24 muffins in oven for 30 minutes.  Freezes very well, if you have any left!

This cake turned out just wonderfully! I made it for a friend who loves pound cake and she was very happy with this recipe. I've tried to make different cakes from scratch and they never turn out good, but this one was just about perfect. I added a half tablespoon of vegetable oil just to add a touch of moisture and I used butter with a butterfat content of 82%.

Best pound cake I’ve ever made.  The texture was perfect and the fam loves it.  The crust on it is fabulous. The flavoring was perfect.  I like pound  cakes with almond extract  instead of just vanilla or lemon . Thanks for posting your recipe.

The recipe was great and easy to follow, I think I filled it to a T except for using cake flour. I did substitute for regular all purpose flour instead and it still turned out beautifully! I also had to let it bake for an additional 15 minutes.

I didn't change it at all, should have, it was way too moist!  I think 3 cubes of butter is an over kill, also to add some lemon zest would be a great addition!..  will try again and see how it comes out..

I've made many pound cakes over the years that were just lackluster.  This recipe has to be the best one I've ever made.  The whole family loved it.  This is now my go-to pound cake recipe.

I've made this a few times. It's the dryest texture point cake I've ever made, but the inside remains moist & has a unique chewy texture. Recently I made Cupcakes with it. I cut out the middles & filled with a lemon fluff from the Italian Lemon Cream cake recipe & then glazed them with the Glaze recipe on Aunt Edna's? Glazed Lemon Pound Cake. DEVINE!!

Never thought making a cake would involve so much mixing, but I'm I did it (well my mixer did it!). I wasn't sure if I would make it again until I got to taste it....YUM! It tastes so awesome, you know, with so much butter and cream cheese. If you like cheese cake, this is for you. Definitely. Yes, I. Will. Make. It. Again.

This is official my favorite non-frosted cake. Lighter than a traditional pound cake, but sooooooooo flavorful. The cream cheese really makes it.

Loved this - I made some adjustments with the extract, using a Vanilla/Nut/Butter extract and I baked it in a Bavaria-bundt for a darker, slightly crispier cake top.

Looked for an easy pound cake recipe to try out the new mixer I received for Christmas. The recipe is very easy to follow and my family loved the cake. Thanks

This cake turned out perfect! I ran out of cake flour so I used one cup of all purpose flour to complete the recipe.  additionally I used 1/2 tbsp of almond, 1/2 tbsp of lemon, 1/2 tbsp of vanilla flavouring as I had a taste for all! Also added a simple lemon flavoured glaze! My hubby doesn’t eat cake but he loves it!

Two words: simply amazing. To additional words: simple project. Final words: it is the best pound cake I have had in too long! Incredible. The slight hint of almond blended with the vanilla is the key.

This cake was the hit of our Thanksgiving meal!!! I swapped lemon extract for the almond extract. Everything else I followed exactly and it turned out AWESOME! I made chocolate ganash icing and topped it with raspberries.

It came out well. Everyone liked it. I gave some away to guests.  I added caramel icing which tasted very good and added a nice flavor to the cake. Only issue was my oven which kept climbing above 325F and then lowering itself below 325F. 

The sides of the cake were a bit too brown IMO. The cake rose more in its center than on its sides. When I flipped it over, the cake sat high on its center and the sides appeared too short. I saw this in pics of others who had similar problem. 

The cake in the above pic came out perfect - blonde colored exterior - not overcooked, so I bet it was moist. I've never made a pound cake before and mine came out tasty and moist. Evenly dispersed oven oven temp is critical.  This is a great recipe!

Believe it or not this is the very first pound cake I've ever made(I'm 76) I am not much of a baker but when I saw this recipe I had to try, it's for a ladies luncheon. 
 My oven is really quirky and was a little too hot in the beginning. Hence my cake is a little dark. Baked it for 1 hr and 15 mins as called for, in a bundt pan. Just took a very thin slice and it is beautiful Inside! And tastes awesome. 
  I read many of the reviews and did reduce the amount of sugar by 1/2 cup. I creamedthe butter, c. cheese and sugar until it was a very light yellow, to help with the cake rising. It worked!! And it never fell. I am thrilled and will certainly make this again. Can't wait for the reviews from my friends

I made an almond drizzle for the top after the cake had cooled....Small amount of milk, powdered sugar and capful of almond extract. Mixed to consistency I wanted.
Poked holes in top of cake and poured over and let soak in .
Soooooo yummy! Will definitely make again!!

It’s a very delicious, rich and heavy pound cake!  You don’t want to overlook it or it will be too dry and the moistness is what makes it!  This recipe makes a huge amount of batter. I filled two 9” loaf pans and four personal bunt pans. The bunt pans over cooked but my loaf pans were wonderful.   I kept it covered tight and it even tasted better two days later!

since I did not have cake flour on hand, I followed advise and reduced all purpose flour by 6 TBS and subbed extra vanilla for almond extract (just don't care for the almond flavor).   Otherwise, I followed recipe as written.  would definitely make again.  Great flavor and texture.....and made with ingredients I always have on hand.  house smells great on a cool fall day :)

I have not yet made this but can't wait to see it! This is driving me crazy: what exactly is white sugar?? Are they referring to powdered or granulated sugar? Someone more intelligent than I please respond! I grew up in a bakery, Daddy was a professional naoer his entire life but I've never seen this except for in Allrecipes.

This cake is fabulous!!  I made it as written with 2 small adjustments - 1) I reduced the sugar to 2.5 cups as recommended by multiple reviewers and 2) I baked it in 2 loaf pans (I don't have a tube or bundt pan).  Everything else was just as originally written.  It came out fantastic!  Unlike what seems like a surprisingly large number of reviewers, I like the flavor of almond, so I didn't change the measurements on the extracts.  I found the cake to be dense but moist, the flavor of almond present but not overpowering, and I felt it needed no icing for sweetness.  This reminds me of my childhood, when my mom would serve pound cake with fresh fruit on top.  Since I have 2 cakes, I plan to serve one at a luncheon I'm having and add sliced peaches and strawberries on top.  The other cake...well, lets just say that I couldn't wait for it to be totally cooled before I dug into it and I'm not sure how much longer it'll last!

I made no changes and I would certainly make it again.  I was surprised that it was so good without blueberries, chocolate chips, or anything extra.

I have the original exact same recipe, the newspaper copy of this recipe from my Mother in law who's been baking it since the late 70's. We call it "Maria by the Pound". It is perfect as is. I always make it with regular flour, and have tried the cake flour which gives it a bit lighter texture. She either dusted it with powdered sugar, or made a lemon glaze for it. It's a classic, most people love.

This cake is the best pound cake I have ever made.  My family requests this cake every time I go home.  I sometimes add a half teaspoon of lemon juice or extract.  Yummy!!!

Great recipe.  I also bake this in 6 mini loaf pans.  I think that way is even better.

I didn’t take a pic- yet, but my hubby loves it! Says it’s better than the pound cake I normally make. I followed the instructions as written and had no issues. I will say, I think this particular cake is probably easier to mix with a stand mixer (which I used) and the batter was very airy. Also, there was so much batter, I was able to keep enough back for a small paper bunt cake and baked it along with the bigger cake. It didn’t take the full 1hr 15. More like 1hr 10, but my oven is not correct on the temp, so I have to use a thermometer inside to make sure my temps are correct. All in all, awesome cake!!!

This was nice. It produced a lovely dense cake which we ate with butterscotch custard. Rated it down 1 star as it was a tad dry - not sure I would have eaten as much without the custard. But definitely will keep this recipe and may adjust it slightly next time.

I made it good.
Before I baked, I read the reviews. And I added 2.5 cups of sugar.
But it's still too sweet for me. I'll add 2 cups of sugar next time.
And I'm sure I am not a big almond flavor fan.

Delish! I followed the recipe only changing the following: I used 5 eggs instead of 6, added 2 C. sugar and 1 C. powdered sugar, and added 1 C. sour cream. I used 1 almost full loaf pan, and 1 round cake pan to bake it. I took the cake pan out of the oven at the 45 minute mark and left the loaf pan in the oven for the full 1 hour 15 min. I am eating it as shortcake with strawberries, sugar and milk. Yum!

I only cooked an hour and used regular flour. Following a suggestion, I used a bit less flour. It came out really good! It really sucks how many eggs it uses, but I think it's worth it!

I've made many pound cakes but this will be my go to recipe from now on! Made it just as written except used lemon extract in place of almond with the vanilla. Texture is spot on. I could hardly wait for it to cool!  I am convinced that my powerful stand mixer gets kudos for the beautiful texture and superb rise.  Make sure  your cream cheese, butter and eggs are room temp. I used ap flour removing 2 tbsp per cup. Perfect.

Love the texture of this pound cake! It is very simple and plain. But that's not bad! It's a perfect base for a fruit topping and whipped cream. One of the best things about this recipe is how long it seems to stay fresh, and it also freezes very well. Two and a half cups of sugar is plenty if you don't have a huge sweet tooth and are planning to serve it with a topping. I do beat the cream cheese mixture for quite a long time in my kitchen aid before proceeding with the rest of the recipe- this is super important. This is what I call perfectly simple and delicious!

Reduced sugar to 2.5 cups as per other reviewers, that was more than sweet enough. Tasted very buttery -- perhaps too buttery. Top was nice and crunchy but inside too dense. And I couldn't get it out of the pan without having chunks of it fall apart. Won't bother with this recipe again, even though taste was good.

Awesome cake I used lemon extract and vanilla extract. The only issue I had with this cake was that  at the temperature of 325 degrees the cake needed to bake an extra 30 minutes but that could be due to using two bread pans instead of a bunt pan

WOW. Unreal. This is the 1st pound cake I've ever made, and it is spectacular. I used 2 loaf pans, so I'll have to figure out how to get them out next time. I also used a lemon glaze from a recipe on allrecipes.com and it's amazing. Giving one to my "Single Mom" neighbor, just because.

Made as is but halved the recipe.  I used a slightly skinnier bread pan/pretty bakery box and it rose beautifully without sinking.  I baked it for an hour.

I halved the recipe and did not use almond extract, since I did not have any on hand. I used a greased 8x4 loaf pan and baked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes at 325 degrees. My pound cake came out perfect. Two thumbs up.

Made this Resurrection Sunday 2015 for family gathering. It was a hit. I reduced the sugar to 2 cups as suggested by one reviewer. The reduction did not matter. I also as the same reviewer suggested blended the butter, cream cheese and eggs for 5 minutes. I didn't miss adding salt and baking soda as I normally do for my pound cakes.

Fabulous cake! I made one loaf (75 mins) and 6 jumbo muffins (40 mins). So moist and delicious. Definitely a forever recipe! The only change I made was to add a scoop of vanilla whey protein powder. Topped it with a simple lemon glaze.

My preliminary finding is this is really, really sweet. I would recommend you cut the sugar in half, if you're not a fan of über-sweet  desserts. Otherwise, this did turn out well as my first pound cake, and it did not fall. Since I wasn't crazy over the taste I froze most of it, and occasionally ate it with peanut butter.

I made a HALF-batch in a 9x5 pan which I sprayed with cooking spray and lined bottom w/parchment. Thanks to the comments of others because they were very helpful! For this half-batch, I cut back way back on the sugar to 1 cup, and it was still plenty sweet for me. Also used 1/2 cup butter, increased vanilla extract to ~2 tblsp and almond extract to ~2 tsp. Did not have cake flour so cut back on the flour by a few tblsps and added a bit of baking powder. Tried a few slices of the cake while still warm (couldn't wait!) with some chocolate sauce and lemon curd on the side...YUM! Will try with fresh fruit and whipped cream next! Thank you for the great recipe, PSTEWART!

I hsve used this as a basic cake for years, personally snd for decorated special occasion cakes.  For wonderful compliments this cannot be beaten.  It makes a great Strawberry short cake base, can be ice cream topped and my favorite is a plain slice with black coffee.

I couldn't wait to tell you, I am eating the cake right now and it's been so long since I have eaten a true pound cake that I am in heaven. Great cake! I put a little in a loaf pan but the bulk is in my bundt pan, still baking, but lookin good. I was afraid it would come over the edge and I have a new stove, and am trying to keep it clean, hence the two pans. I let the small pan cool a little bit. At first touch it felt like it was not going to set but at last it did. Although, when I turned it out it came out it didn't come out in one piece. That's ok, I will eat it. :). I did put a pinch of soda, 1/2 tsp of baking powder, and the same in salt. Very good. A little crunchy outside, very soft inside, and no need for icing at all.

I have had this basic recipe for years and my family has loved it every time...Never had my cake to fall or anyone say anything about it being too sweet...this is the perfect recipe. I don't know why the cakes are falling but it sure isn't the recipe....this is the best one I have tried yet.

This was good, dense and easy to make.  I did heed other reviewers comments and reduced the sugar to about 2.25 cups.  I also added thinly sliced strawberries to the middle of the cake, strawberries to the top and then a glaze made with evaporated milk and confectioners sugar.  

I served it at an office birthday party and it was a hit.

Really liked this but I did decrease the sugar to around 2 1/3 cups. Would also be great with some citrus zest or more almond.

Turned a messed up cookie recipe into this pound cake - delicious!
 I had 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1 1/2 cups butter, 4 eggs, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 1 tsp coconut extract and 4 cups powdered sugar(this sugar should have been used for a glaze) all mixed together. Put the ingredients into more searches and found this recipe. Added the cream cheese, 2 1/2 tsp vanilla, 2 more eggs, and the cake flour.
I baked it in a stoneware fluted pan for 1 hr 45 min, think I should have baked it for about 15 min more. If anyone has baked this in a stone pan please let me know how long you baked it for.
Turned out wonderfully!!! Loved it!
Never throw out a mistake - you never know what you can turn it into.

I have never been a big fan of pound cake but I LOVE THIS!!!! and everyone that has tried this recipe loves it too. I have to change a few things because my son has a diary allergy and we still comes out wonderful and fluffy. I have made it so many ways with all kinds of fruit fillings, as birthday cake and just the slices of ound cake by themselves. You can't go wrong with it.

Very good! The batter alone is to die for. :) I did make it in a glass plan so dropping the temp down to 300 and keeping an eye on it after an hour is a good idea. Also used the all purpose flour method by removing 2tbs per cup and used two tbs vanilla. Im not a fan of almond. Next time I think I will try it with lemon extract and the blue berry glaze.

This was fantastic.  I added a little extra almond and followed the suggestions to reduce sugar to 2 1/2 c. and add 1/2 c. sour cream.  I can not believe how dense and rich it was.  Perfect special occasion dessert served with fresh fruit and ice cream or whipped cream.  I will be making this many more times!

I wasn't too fond of this cake at all. I was quite disappointed with it actually. It wasn't too sweet but there were other issues that I had with it. I felt as if the cream cheese flavor was too overpowering. It reminded me of a cream cheese sugar cookie. The crust hardened and split away from the cake. The taste was just not really good. I would suggest for any other people looking to bake this cake, to use a tube pan because the bundt pan doesn't work for this particular recipe.

I recently used this recipe to bake my 1st pound cake and it was absolutely delicious. It was perfect!! I enlisted the help of my 2 oldest girls who were estatic about chipping in. We substituted lemon extract instead of almond extract. We also reduced the amount of sugar by a 1/2 cup. It was moist and fluffy. My husband (who knows nothing about baking) even stated that it was not "too" dense and insists that we keep this recipe. This one is for sure a keeper!!

A delicious cake.  I'm not sure I would add the almond extract next time, but my friends loved it, and said they wouldn't change a thing.  The edge get crunchy, and the inside is moist and soft.  Really, really good recipe.

I made this pound cake for my dad because he said he used to love the store bought pound cake. He said it was 10 times better and that I should always make it. I poured it into 2 9x5 pyrex meatloaf trays instead of the tube. It turned out perfect. Couldn't ask for a better recipe. Thanks :)

I absolutely ADORE this recipe. I was trying to find a recipe that might come out like my grandmother's pound cake, and this is the one. This has the taste that I grew up with and oh my goodddddd... it's perfect. I used this to make a wedding cake and it was the perfect consistency to cover with fondant.

Yum! This was a delicious cake - I used all-purpose flour instead of cake, but everything else remained the same. My only problem was that I kept it in 10 minutes past the bake time and it still was very raw on the bottom inside of the cake. Also, I'll probably reduce the sugar next time.

This cake beats store bought ones hands down. I can't wait to make this for my mom. 
I wasn't planning on putting in the almond extract as i'm not too keen on that flavor. I was going to put in the vanilla, but completely forgot. I was so mad because I thought I ruined it. But it still turned out perfect. The best pound cake I've ever tasted. So velvety and moist. Great recipe!

I used 1 cup of low fat sour cream instead of cream cheese. Next time I will add 1/2t salt to bring out the flavor.  This was really good. I made it in a 13x9 pan and served it with blueberry sorbet.  It was a great dessert on the hottest day of the year!

Very good, but not great.  I used lemon extract instead of almond, gave it a very nice flavor.  Husband thought it was too sweet, and kids liked it ok but were not crazy about it.

I thought ths cake was just wonderful. The measurements were perfect, I did not add the almond extract because I dont like it so 2 tsp of vanilla were fine. If  u want to make it with a twist add a cup fo pecans and a 1/2 cup of coconut. It is wonderful everyone whos tried it want the recipe. I thinnk may become my signature cake.

This Pound cake was wonderful.
I followed the recipe exactly, and it isn't exactly healthy, but it's great!
I cooked it in a bunt pan, I found that the densest part was the top, or, once I turned it over, the bottom. For about a half inch it tasted more like a cheesecake/pound cake mix.
But it was very good. It's better to wait until it cools to eat it, some of it's flavor is lost on you if you eat it when it's straight out of the oven.
I also found it was good with fruit, try it with your favorite Jam. 
Anyway, Five stars!

Absolutely delicious. I usually hate poundcake (Grew up with the crappy, greasy Entemann's type) but I was feeling up for a challenge today so I decided to make this. I too, only used 2.5 cups of sugar.  Overbeating definitely is not an issue with this recipe. I beat the batter so much that it resembled whipped cream. Divided it in two and baked at 325 in two loaf pans. I think next time I could pass with only 2 cups of sugar because it was still a tad too sweet for my taste. When I fed my boyfriend my piece of half-eaten pound cake, though, he ate it all in one bite. Winner recipe indeed!

I like this recipe, but I didn't like the almond extract, so I substituted  lemon extract and a small amount of lemon zest, which basically changed it to a lemon cream cheese pound cake, I also applied a lemon glaze to the cake before it cooled all the way. great flavor.

Holy fill in the blank is this cake good!  I made it twice for a holiday party and people could not stop raving.  I could not stop raving.  So so good!  I did both bundt and loaf pans.  Bother were good.  Loaf pans were easier and more predictable.  That flaky top was "to die for."  Amazing.  This is a very rich delictable dessert that is totally worth the effort of the 5-7 minutes of mixing before adding the flour.  I used cake flour.  Don't know if it made a differenceas that is the only way I made it.  Used almond and vanilla flavor but only 1/2 of the recommended almond.
Delicious!

I really liked this pound cake but my mom and husband thought it was too dry. The Almond flavor was very nice for a change though. I may have baked it a bit too long. I will give it another try.

Absolutely delicious!  Exactly the texture I was looking for.  My very first success at a pound cake.  Yea!! I drizzled with caramel, which was still good, but could have just left it alone. Hint:  heat slices 20 seconds in the microwave at 50 % power for an extra special treat!

Wow!  This recipe is soooo delicious!  I'm not much of a baker, but this cake is so easy to make...and delicious.  My boyfriend and I just gobble it up.  We call it bread, as to not get it confused with cheesecake, but it's sweet and yummy enough to be a desert.  I also like it in the morning with a cup of black coffee.  

When I make it, I make a half batch and bake it in a bundt pan.  It makes the perfect size pieces.

My pound cake just came out of the oven and it tasted great.  It tastes sweet with a hint of vanilla.  It's a firm pound cake and a crispy top.  I didn't  use almond extract and I don't think the cream cheese made any difference.  Thank you.  I will make this again.

So easy and so delicious!  Turned out beautiful. I did make 2 additions to this recipe which I think enhanced it tremendously.  I zested an entire lemon and an entire orange and added that to the mixture.  Delicious!!!

Very, very good. I used 2 loaf pans- it took only 1 hour to bake.  A little disappointed though because part of one of the cakes stuck in the pan (my fault)- but turned out okay because then I was able to preview the taste and texture!!  Only used 2 1/2 cups of sugar- otherwise followed recipe exactly.  I plan on serving with some fresh raspberry, blueberry, and strawberry sauce and whipped cream.  Thanks for the recipe!

DELICIOUS!  I thought this was simple and wonderful tasting.  I put a little less than 2 1/2 cups of Sugar and 1 1/2 T Vanilla and only 1/2 T Almond Extract and thought is was just enough almond, anything more I feel the almond taste would over power it.  Next time I will try Lemon extract.  I cooked it a little over an hour and not the 1 hr 15 and it came out great.  Thanks!!

Delish!  Absolutely rich.  I left out the almond extract and it was still yummy.  Will make again for special occasions only.  Too much fat and calories for everyday!!

I have made this recipe every year for Christmas since I lived in Madeira Portugal in 1999.  It is amazing with a lovely fruit sauce or simply sliced.  I have also made it in a bundt pan.  Truly a WONDERFUL recipe.  Just the right amount of vanilla and almond flavoring.  Very moist, even if the outside gets a bit crunchy.  thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.  It has become a family tradition every Christmas as my mother, sister and I bake nearly 120 small loaf pans of this great recipe to share with our friends.  Truly...thank you!!!!

This is the best pound cake ever.  it even beats my grandmas!  the only thing i changed is i halved the recipe and make in in a 6" load pan (b/c thats the only baking pan i had)  makes the perfect amount.  Goes really well with chocolate fondue!

This was VERY good. The cake was GONE within 2 days. I made it just like the recipe said however, I added extra vanilla because I didn't have the almond extract and it was DELICIOUS! Very dense and moist! I poured 1/2 in a round bundt and some in a loaf pan. Definately a MUST TRY!

I have been making this cake for quite a while now and it is always a BIG hit with anyone who tries it. I don't change anything about it and would not for fear of changing the wonderful taste.

This is a very moist, dense pound cake...it was delicious!  It is a tad too sweet for my taste, but addicting none the less! Next time I'll try making it with 2 3/4 cups of sugar.

I'm not a fan of almond extract so following some reviews i changed it to vanilla extract.  I also reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 cups.  It still turned out perfect.  I brought it to the office and it just disappeared!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!  I'll definitely do another batch again!

This is such a wonderful recipe. Turns out great every time and you can play with the flavors. Our favorite is to add the juice and zest of three small lemons, 1 teaspoon of baking soda and omitting 1 of the eggs. Terrific!

I added 1 tsp of baking soda, as well as extra almond extract (Probably about 1 tblsp). I also added about 1.5 cups frozen raspberrys. (Almond and raspberry go GREAT together!) It took quite a long time to cook, I think because of the added moisture from the raspberrys, but it tasted great :)

This is the only pound cake recipe that I have ever used. I have never bothered to check out any others because for me, this recipe is the standard. My oldest son asks me to make this every year on his birthday; this is his favorite cake. No matter who I make this cake for, or where I take it, I am begged for the recipe. OUTSTANDING!!!!

oh man, this cake's so cool! I love the crusty bit, so nice and crunchy, just wished there's more crunchy bits :)
All I substituted was the flour, I used pure flour instead, as I ran out of all-purpose, dunno what it's like with all-purpose but it turned out so nice and soft and fluffy, will make it again as a base of many things to come! Thanks for the recipe :)

Dense, flavorful  and delicious!  I love the subtle almond flavor.  Next time I might try grating some orange peel into the batter for an extra flavor.  I cut 1/4 c. sugar and 3 T butter to cut the fat/calories slightly!

This cake is really delicious. I did omit the almond extract and added a little extra vanilla. I used this for strawberry shortcake and it was perfect. The texture was so fine and it cut beautifully.  This is definitely a keeper and it's hard to believe I could find a better pound cake.

I made this pound cake this weekend.  It was a huge success.  My family loved it.  My brother could not wait for it to come out of the oven.  I used others suggestions and substituted lemon extract for the almond and it was wonderful.  This was my first pound cake.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this cake on Thursday and it was gone by Saturday!  AND there are oly 2 of us in the house.  My husband REALLY loved it with his coffee.  I did use regular flour(2 1/2 C) and cut the sugar to 2 1/2 C.  Tasted much like the Sara Lee Pound Cake in the frozen food section.  Thanks so much!

I skipped on the almond extract--but I cooked this recipe for my house of 62 women.  It was a hit!  One told me that she was having a really bad day, but after a bite of the cake she felt fantastic.  Thanks!

If you just want something with lots of flavor and lots of sugar this might be for you.  I think it would be perfect with a little less sugar and a little less almond.  I was wanting to top it with strawberries, but I think they would have gotten lost.  Don't eat it hot.  It's much better cold.

This is the same as my grandmother's  famous Cream Cheese Pound Cake .  For flavoring, however she used 1 tablespoon Mace and 1 Tablespoon Lemon Juice.    I think I will try it your way  today but don't know if I can give up the MACE!

It was my intention to make this cake exactly as the recipe calls, but my poor little mixer was moaning so I added about 1/2 cup of cream.  After it was mixed, I realized that my daughter had borrowed and not returned my tube pan, so I baked it in a 13x9 glass dish.  That cut down on the baking time and although it didn't resemble the shape of a pound cake...was deeelicious!!  My fiance loved it!  I will keep this recipe in my collection.

The flavor was really good on this cake, and we liked the denseness BUT it was so dry. I am gonna try again in loaf pans and fiddle with the oven temp a bit. My oldest toasted it an put cinnoman butter on it.

This recipe didn't work out for me. It took FOREVER to bake, much longer than the directions indicated and once it finally did get done, the entire top portion was hard as a rock. I was able to cut that part off for a "short" pound cake, and it tasted good, but it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I could have done something wrong, but I will be looking for another recipe.

Excellent! My family absolutely loved this cake, even my picky daughter. I used only 2 cups of sugar, as recommended in previous posts, used 
1 1/2 Tablespoons vanilla, 1/4 teaspoon butter flavor, and no almond flavor. I baked it in two loaf pans for the entire called-for baking time, and they turned out perfect! Think I'll experiment with flavorings with this recipe, but it certainly doesn't need experimentation!

This pound cake was excellent. Nice and dense, and SO rich and filling! I didn't count my eggs before I started, so I used 5 eggs and maybe 1/4c sour cream to make up for the moisture. Mine cracked a bit, but that certainly doesn't affect the taste. I might add some lemon extract next time and see what happens - I'm so excited to have a good recipe like this that I can use to experiment.

Turned out wonderful!  I did as others suggested and left out the almond extract and used 1 1/2 T of vanilla instead.  I made a bundt cake and a loaf with this recipe and sprinkled with powedered sugar.  Put some mulling spice in some cool whip and serve on top.  YUMMM!

This is the recipe my mom makes. She is in Iraq this year for Thanksgiving and Christmas so I'll be making 3 or 4 of them. It's delicious, but make sure to add in ingrediants 1 at a time. I've made that mistake. The only difference in the one we make is 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla instead of vanilla and almond extract. (I don't like almond flavoring.)

This recipe is great.  The only thing I did differently was that I omitted the almond extract and used 1/2 tsp butter extract, and 1 tsp of creme bouquet. Absolutely delicious.

I made this cake by following the recipe exactly except I used Vanilla, Butter & Nut flavoring instead of plain vanilla and it turned out great.   I did have to bake it about 15 minutes longer in my oven.  The texture was nice and smooth.   The almond flavor was a tad strong for my taste so the next time I make this cake I will use only 1/2 tsp. and will add 1/4 tsp of orange or lemon extract.  Overall, this is a keeper and I will make it again.

This is an awesome recipe! We had a fondue party and I didn't want to make another trip to the store to pickup pound cake - so I made this recipe instead.  The pound cake was better than Sara Lee - it was moist, dense and buttery.  I didn't have almond extract, so I added 1 tsp of lemon juice instead.  Next time I'll add 1 tsp of lemon zest and increase lemon juice to 2 T for a more lemony flavor.

This recipe is great! Bit too sweet for me.  May be I'll put in less sugar and add more lemon flavor to it next time.  It worked out ok even when I cut the recipe to half portion.

This cake tasted great.  But neither of my kids finished a piece.  Two days later it just sits on the counter.  It's very heavy.  Too heavy and dense even for a pound cake.  And the outside crust is too dark and thick and dry.  I baked it exactly as written and for the full amount of time as it wasn't done after 1 hour or 1 hour 10 minutes.  I may try it again at 350 for less time.

I have made this three times in the past few weeks. 

Is perfect, moist with a crusty top. 

My mistake in making one of the three cakes was leaving the cake in the pan too long.  Make sure you take it out after 10 minute of resting.

Today I am going to change and add lemon flavoring w/lemon icing for Sunday company.  Maybe I'm messing with perfection.  This cake is wonderful as is.

A GREAT recipe to say the least!!  I did not add the almond extract and have experimented with the pans that I bake the cake in.  I found a simple loaf pan works best!
This is a very rich and flavorful cake and it is fabulous with fresh strawberries and whipped cream on top!!!   AAA+++

This pound cake is very easy to make and very tasty!  My picky husband (who said the only pound cake he's had was in MREs) liked it pretty well. It has a smooth tender texture and is pretty moist. I love the added almond extract, even though almond is not my favorite flavor it adds a nice touch to this cake. I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe, mine was done in about 1 hour and 20 minutes, but I took the oven temp. down 25 degrees since we have a very old oven...which is not too accurate.  I dusted with powdered sugar and plan to make some "strawberry short-pound cake" with it tomorrow.  Thanks for the recipe!

This cake was very moist and delicious.  I did add a little lemon zest because I like a little lemon flavor.  The cake did fall a little after I removed it from the oven.  Maybe I took it out a minute to early.  Served it with strawberries, whipped cream, and vanilla ice cream..yummy!

My family loves this pound cake.  I use less almond extract, more vanilla.

Too dense.  Too bland.  Not cooked enough in the center, even after 1.5 hours.  It was OK, but I will keep looking for a really tasty pound cake recipe.

I made this cake for Christmas but could not find cake flour so I had to use regular. It came out O.K., but was a little thick and dry. I was expecting it to be more moist, which it probably would have been if I had used cake flour. The up side is that my husband LOVED it. He practically ate the whole thing and is asking for it again. I finally found cake flour, so I will definitely try this recipe again.

Fantastic recipe!  This pound cake actually put my Nana's recipe to shame.  I'm officially adopting this recipe, and I thank you for sharing it with us.

This is by far the best tasting pound cake recipe I've ever made.  I did have one problem...the center of the cake was too moist...looked like pudding had been added.  Otherwise, excellent.

Great cake but as others have stated earlier, the sugar is overpowering.  I'm cutting down to 2cups and I'm sure that this will be a keeper!

I've tried numerous times to bake a cake and they never seem to come out quite right.  After trying this recipe I am now known as the Pound Cake Queen.  I can't thank you enough!
