These were REALLY good! -I even liked them cold the next day (great "at work" snack!) I do have one suggestion though: peel the eggplant first. It was a little tough biting through the rubbery peel. That's the only thing I'll change the next time I make these, which will be soon!  :o)  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Yummy! I used 2 whole eggs mixed with a little salt and fresh pepper instead of the egg substitute. I also peeled and cut the eggplant into rounds. I did use some Italian breadcrumbs and added the wheat germ and cheese to it. I liked the wheat germ aspect of this dish, sneaking in a little healthiness. My kids love these, and I serve them with my homemade marinara sauce.

This was so delicious.  My husband and I love eggplant.  I can't believe that the wheat germ coating was so delicious.  We both felt that if no one had told us about it we probably would have just thought it was coated with regular breadcrumbs.  I am going to try this on other things that I would typically bread.  Thanks.

I love eggplant any way you can fix it. This was so good and definitely beats the fried version when it comes to healthiness. I did have to cook longer than stated in the recipe and turned more than once to keep the browning even. Serves nicely with low-fat ranch dressing as well. All in all, a good keeper recipe. Thanks!

VERY good, and SO easy!  My kids loved them.  I have the small japenese eggplants in my garden and this recipe for them is great!  I had a marinara sauce, and I used about 9 small eggplants..........many thanks

Another tip: to give an Indian flair, try mixing yogurt, molassas and curry powder as a dipping sauce - even my picky brother liked it!  I used approx. 1/4 cup plain yogurt, 1+ Tbsp molassas and maybe 3/4 tsp curry.

Loved these, but tweaked them using a gluten free mix of crushed Glutino crackers and rice Chex cereal.  Used egg and almond milk for the liquid to dip the eggplant strips in. 
Loved them.  Loved them.  Will make again and again.

My anti-veggie kids, 2 and 4, just gobbled these up with me.  I used Gia Russa Whole Grain Italian Seasoned Breadcrumbs instead of wheat germ.  I wish I made more!

These were delicious!  But I used bread crumbs instead of wheat germ and a whole egg and cut the eggplant widthwise, rather than lengthwise.  So, we loved my version.

I didn't care for how mushy the area with the seeds was the first time I made these.  Since then I have been using the outer layers only and love love love them.

Easy to throw together, a healthy and tasty compliment to any meal or snack. I used an egg yolk (leftover from recent baking) and a little milk, that worked just fine. The only thing I'd do differently is choose a better Italian seasoning... I used Herbs de Provence and didn't love it (no fault of the recipe). I'd make again sometime.

This is quick and easy to make and very good!  I did not peel the eggplant as another person suggested, but I also did not mind biting into the eggplant skin.

These are an awesome side dish. Instead of using spaghetti sauce we used a modified spicy sauce that includes ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and pepper flakes.

ANY food that will have my extremely picky toddler asking for "MORE!" deserves 10 stars in my book!  These do take awhile to put together, but the results are worth it.  Eaten alone or dipped in marinara, these are fantastic.  I can't wait to try this method with zucchini and other soft vegetables to see if my toddler will eat them as well.  Try these, they are great for everyone!

Not our favorite recipe for eggplant. Seemed to have to broil them for at least 2 min longer to really get that crunch. But even at that some weren't as done as others. The wheat germ was a good idea though. Just not right for our taste buds.

I did not use the egg sub or egg (or wheat germ) at all... i just threw the sticks around in olive oil and  sprinkled the seasoning on them (which i added a lil plain bread crumb to).  I broiled them longer than 3 minutes each, probally about 5 - 6 and they were a lil crispy.  The tomatoe sauce was spiced up with a little hot sauce and cayenne pepper and garlic.  Very good idea...it felt like i was eatting french fries, which i havent ate in years so when i get the urge...i will cook again...thanks

I must have not followed the recipe correctly because they turned out a bit rubbery and flavorless. I will try them again, maybe use zucchini and add salt and more garlic and herbs and cook a but longer. I'm sure this was an operator error, not recipe.

THe thinner the slices the better. I didn't have cooking spray so i just drizzled some oil on the cookie sheet and on top as little as i could. Definately would have been better with thinner slices and oil spray. Easy on the italian seasoning. Seemed a little much for me. Serve warm. Not as good cooled off.

These were FANTASTIC! i subbed crushed fiberone cereal for the wheat germ. and used egg white, and couldn't tell the difference from store-bought bread crumbs. I had no problem biting through the skins, and these totally satisfied my cravings for french fries. This recipe totally got me hooked on eggplant, and even my mom (an inveterate eggplant hater) fell in love with these BA snacks. Makes a great lunch on the go, or an awesome starter recipe for someone just starting to eat healthier! (also tried these with the yogurt-curry mix mentioned earlier, it was great!)

I have never had eggplant before and this was a great way to try it. Yum!  I used a beaten egg instead of egg substitute and italian bread crumbs instead of wheat germ.

I found these to be very satisfying.  Three sticks were plenty to quench my cravings leaving many sticks left over.  They were still firm when cooked, I feel they needed more cooking time.

Made these tonight, and they were ok. I only cooked half, so the other half I will sweat out first by sprinkling with salt on the eggplant to take away the bitterness. Mine turned out nice and crispy but just seemed to be lacking something-haven't been able to put my finger on what though. Not bad as a healthy side, but def needs marinara for dipping!

These were good but not as crispy as I wanted them to be. Next time I'll cut the eggplant earlier and let it sweat to get some moisture out.

A very good way to serve up the eggplant I bought at the farmer's market.  I actually didn't have enough parmesan cheese - I had about 1/6 of a cup and it was actually grated romano, parmesan, and asiago blend.  If I made the recipe again, I would use the same amount as the cheese flavor came across just right.  I was impressed with this as it is easy and yummy.

I feel this recipe lacked something in taste. the eggplant just was not impressive. I would probably not add Parmesan cheese in the bread crumb mix and then fry the sticks in the pan instead of broil or bake.

We are not eggplant eaters, but I got one in my co-op farm box, so I needed to use it.  My kids tried this, but didn't like it.  I will have to try other eggplant recipes to see what we like.  Although I think people who generally like eggplant would like this recipe.

YUM!  I really enjoyed this recipe!  I had an eggplant I needed to use and this was just what I felt like.  I didn't use wheat germ however (I didn't have any) so I subbed in wheat flour and it turned out great!  I also increased the garlic and italian seasoning to my preference.  I'm guessing the original recipe is just as good!

This was good and due to the wheat germ and a quick broil also healthy.  Next time I will omit a bit of Parmesan cheese as the taste was a bit strong.

these turned out really well.  i love the wheat germ, it tastes just like bread crumbs!  i had a lot of eggwhites laying around so i used that instead of egg substitute.  a great afternoon snack!

the seasoning could of used some more flavor.  Very cleaver way to skip the bread crumbs.
