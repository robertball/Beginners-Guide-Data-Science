It was too strong with Soy Sauce flavor for my taste. It did make the meat tender and juicy.

The only thing I left out was the honey.  I thought the brown sugar added enough sweetness.  The best thing about this is that you already have all the ingredients in the pantry. I whipped it up before church, put the steaks in it, and put them on the grill when we got home.   Excellent marinade!  I think it tastes as good as any of the store-bought ones for a lot cheaper.

I really liked this recipe, my girlfriend said it was probably the best steak I've made.  It was a little on the sweet side, but very flavorful. I used some pecan wood chips to give it a little extra smoky flavor.

A little too sweet for my taste. It overpowers the flavor of the steak.
