Very Nice! While I kept faithfully to the ingredients, I changed up the presentation and cooking method. First, I couldn't find any red bell peppers I liked, I used orange - the recipe works with any bell pepper. And instead of putting the mixture into a whole bell pepper, I cut the peppers in half lengthwise, so the egg part is more visible. I think its prettier presentation. I also used crumpled foil to keep the peppers from rolling when putting in or taking out of the oven. All in all, a great idea - I will put this on my regular rotation!

Love this! And it's a great way to add both protein and veggies to your diet at breakfast time. I made several and reheated them over the next couple of days to have a quick, veggie-filled breakfast before work each morning.

I also changed it up a little bit based on what I had. I substituted tarragon with thyme and feta cheese for cheddar. Goes great with a black bean soup! Thanks!

This was a simple recipe that turned out very tasty.  My whole family like it including my two young children.  A nice change from other stuffed pepper recipes!  The only change I made was increasing the amount of cheese - which I would highly recommend.

We really enjoyed this, and it is easy to put together. I did not have any tomatoes, but I added some sliced fresh mushrooms. I will be making this again.

I added cooked sausage and followed another reviews advice by propping up bell pepper halves with tin foil. This was a hit with the family--and so much better than regular boring stuffed pepper recipes.
