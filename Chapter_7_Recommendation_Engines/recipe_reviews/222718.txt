The major components of this salad are great!  Lettuce, Tomato, Avocado, & Steak!  However, the reason I give this a 4 instead of a 5 is because as an "Asian" salad, this dressing is all wrong.  My family and I lived in South Korea for 8 years and loved all of the Asian flavors and salads we were served.  There was one particular restaurant that I felt had the BEST house salad in the world!  Amazingly (they are SUPER accommodating in Korea) , they gave their salad dressing recipe to a friend of mine and then she passed it on to me.  Actually, the foundation of the dressing for this allrecipes salad is pretty close, although way too sugary.  If you cut the sugar down to 1 TBSP and then add at LEAST 3 TBSP of soy sauce and a little minced garlic, it turns this salad into something very close to what we had in Korea and we LOVED IT!  Also, if you like a little more kick, I'd suggest adding a bit more red pepper flakes.  I used the Korean brand found at our local Asian Mart.  The suggestion of adding arugala sounds really tasty.  And, next time I make this I will add a side of garlic bread to help round out the meal.  You can also soak up the extra dressing with the bread and it is SO yummy!

What a nice summer meal.  This would also be a great way to use some leftover grilled steak.  The dressing was a little sweet for me so I cut the sugar in half.  Next time I am going to grill the romaine with some garlic olive oil and then chop that up for the salad.  Very nice, light and tasty recipe.

Perfect summer salad that can be a way to use up leftover grilled (or otherwise prepared) steak.  Arugula leaves can be used instead of romaine.  They contrast nicely with the steak and Asian dressing.  I only used a pinch of sugar in the dressing.

Yes, cut the sugar to 1 T. For "Asian" dressings, marinades and dips we always add a little fresh or powdered ginger, more garlic than this one calls for and a bit of sirachi ("Rooster") sauce.  As one reviewer said, the sesame sauce is pricey but it is SO rich that you only use a little and it lasts a long time.  There really is no other substitution for that delicious and unique flavor!

Made as is, and this was the best salad I have ever concocted.  Maybe even best I've ever eaten for that matter. The grilled and smokey flavors of the steak melded beautifully with the Asian dressing and creamy avocado.  Will be making this on the regular now to get myself to eat more greens.  You HAVE to give it a try.  Can't believe this recipe doesn't have more reviews.

Delicious and super easy to make! I couldn't find sesame oil but I think the dressing came out great. I also was out of soy sauce so I improvised with teriyaki marinade and it was delicious! Will definitely be making this salad again!

This salad was very tasty and I also agree with the other comments. The sugar can be just a tsp. I had to substitute white balsamic vinegar and it went well.

This salad was tasty!  We omitted the sesame oil because it is rather pricey and used thin cut steak.  The dressing was light and refreshing!  Will make this one again!

This is awesome and everyone loved it.   The flavors were wonderful. Don’t leave anything out. My only sub was a fresh clove of minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I also reduced the sugar in the dressing by half on the recommendation of other reviewers. I doubled the recipe and served it on a large platter with the meat topping the romaine in the center and the other veggies grouped around the edges and the dressing to the side. It made my picky eaters happy to choose their own combinations. A big hit!

This is a delicious salad.  I have made it a few times and it turned out great both times.  I love the homemade dressing, but cut the sugar in half and add some low sodium soy sauce (since I prefer things to be saltier than sweet).  The avocado adds a great heartiness.

We really enjoyed this - it will become a regular dinner in our house, I'm sure.  I made three minor changes to this recipe . 1.  I forgot to sprinkle the steak with the lemon juice.  2. I added fresh strawberries.  3.  I cut the sugar in half, and I think that was right for our tastes.  The dressing was sweet, but not overly.  Even if we don't make the entire salad very often, I will be making the dressing to use on green salads.

Super easy recipe!  At first I was skeptical, thinking it was far too simple to be tasty. I marinated a flank steak overnight & did not grill it (bf didn't feel like firing up the grill.)  Additionally, I did change the dressing based on reviews.  I used one tablespoon of sugar & added one tablespoon of soy sauce.  This recipe is definitely a keeper, so much so that I went out & bought another flank steak so it's ready for marinating!

This made a wonderful, lighter summer meal.  I did use someone’s suggestion of using some fresh crushed garlic and ginger as well as some soya sauce in the dressing.

Added 3Tbsp soya sauce and only 1Tbsp of sugar  to dressing as noted by another commenter. Added snow peas instead of avocado as that is what I had on hand. Avocado would have been good too. Might add scallions instead of red onions next time. Kids loved it!

We really liked this. I used leftover steak from a BBQ the night before. And I cut the sugar back by half. For the amount of romaine lettuce, I will double the avocado next time. And there WILL be a next time.

This is a tasty salad for a hot summer day.  We opted not to pre-dress the salad but allowed everyone to use what they wanted.  We also served the steak and avocados on the side.  My family agreed it's a little heavy on olive oil and needs more rice vinegar.  With these two adjustments could be a five-star recipe.  But will make again and adjust to our liking.  Thanks for sharing!!
