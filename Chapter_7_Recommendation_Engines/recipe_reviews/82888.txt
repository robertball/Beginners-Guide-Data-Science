Was ok.  Too many olives for my taste. Reminded me of pizza.  Wasn't sure what to serve it with.

This was so good! Like pizza, but without the dough. Very cheesy - can't go wrong with cheese when it comes to my family! ;) Will be making this again.

Made as written and left out the optional jalapeno because it seemed out of place to me. The green chile seemed out of place too but it worked just fine. This was some serious cheese gooey madness and the first to disappear on the SuperBowl.
