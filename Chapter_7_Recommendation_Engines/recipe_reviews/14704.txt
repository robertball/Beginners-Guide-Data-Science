Original review 12/20/06

These were sooo good. It's really hard to find decent Chinese food around here so I made my own. I made a few changes. Doubled the ginger & garlic powder, & used 4 cups of shredded coleslaw mix. I sauteed the cabbage mixture a little in 2T water & 2T soy sauce then added the pork & 1/2  t. chinese five spices. I used 1/3 C filling for the inside. We made 11 eggrolls not 8. Peanut oil is rather expensive which no one mentioned, I might try a different oil next time to save a few bucks. I found the egg roll wrappers in the produce section near the vegetables if anyone else had trouble find them, ( I looked in the Asian section initially then had to ask a store employee). My husband LOVED these. I served them with Fried Rice Restaurant Style & Broccoli Beef I from this site. Thank you!


Edit 12/10/12
This is how I now make these: Doubled the ginger & garlic powder, & used 16 oz bag of shredded coleslaw mix in the filling. I sauteed the cabbage mixture a little in 2 T water & 2 T soy sauce then added the pork & 1 t. Chinese five spices. I used 1/3 C filling for the inside. We make 15 eggrolls. We brush them with vegetable oil then bake them on a sheet pan at 425 degrees for 20 mins, turning over after 10 mins. Much healthier to bake them & less of a hassle than frying.

I took the reviews advice and added twice the called for garlic and ginger and also added soy sauce as many said these were bland.  They were fantastic and very easy to put together! I also used another recommendation and used the cole slaw mix (carrots and cabbage) and this recipe took no time to put together.  I have many children and this recipe was a hit with all of them! I will definately be making this again, and again and ...

This recipe is excellent.  We were a little concerned because some of the reviews said the egg rolls were bland.  We made no modifications to it, and it was outstanding.  Our guests were very impressed.

We made an extra dozen and froze them.

These are the easiest egg rolls I have ever made, and they are tasty.  Next time I would add a little more seasoning to the filling. I also used a bag of cole slaw.

i JUST MADE THESE AGAIN AND I USED SPICY PORK SAUSAGE VERY GOOD!!!

These were the first egg rolls I've ever made and I must say they were impressive. Instead of chopping everthing up (carrots, etc.) I bought a bag of coleslaw mix and used that. They were delicious, but they are not very "jazzy." To quote Emeril, "You gotta kick these up a notch or two." We experimented and added hot sauce to the mix, and next time (we WILL make them again) we are going to add garlic, etc. We don't like things crazy spicey but these egg rolls as is are just way too bland. We give the author 4 stars because we never would have made these without her help and ideas. Thank you!

These are great, although after making them a few times, I would recommend using canola oil to fry them in.  I got a much crispier egg roll using that instead of peanut oil.  Also, I added scrambled eggs, and extra cabbage.  Beware, this recipe makes a lot of filling!!

These are good.  I tried them with Lumpia Wrappers instead of egg roll wrappers and they were even better!  The lumpia wrappers come out nice and crispy the way my kids like them.  Lumpia wrappers are hard to find, check asian markets for them.  They are much thinner than eggroll wrappers and look a bit like an egg crepe.  They fry up very crispy sort of like Filo does.

Good egg rolls but I think I'll have to play around with some spices to make it taste better.  Possibly lemon pepper seasoning.  Also, instead of chopping up cabbage and carrots, I used 2 cups worth of pre-shredded cole slaw...same results and saves on time.  I'll try these again to see if I can find the right spice combinations.

These egg rolls are the best I've had.  I used minced garlic from a container you buy at the store instead of the powder.  I also used a package of coleslaw for the cabbage and carrots, made it much easier.   I mixed the cabbage in with the meat after it was cook to help make the rolling easier.  I also added about 1 tablespoon soy sauce to the meat mixture as other reviews suggested as well.  

I tried deep frying, frying in a skillet with a little oil and baking in the oven.  I found that deep frying them make them very greasy.  baking in the oven made the egg roll wrapper rubbery. Frying in the skillet with just a little oil was the best, they weren't too oily and were still crunchy.  

I've made these with both the seasoned sausage and plain ground sausage and I prefer the plain.  These rolls are very meaty and with the seasoned sausage it was just too over powering.   I uploaded a picture of one of the egg rolls I made picture #26.  It shows you the inside of the roll so you can see how meaty these guys are.  I was thinking about adding more cabbage, but my family protested saying they liked them the way they are, nice and meaty.

I made Sweet and Sour Sauce II from this site to go with these egg rolls and it was the best sweet and sour sauce too!  I will differently be making these over and over again! YUM

My best friend and I made these one night.They were so great! My children are 2 and 5. They loved them. We did add lemon pepper, soy sauce and minced garlic to the pork when browning the meat.

This is a good basic egg roll recipe. I like to add a little soy sauce to the veggies while they're cooking, along with garlic and onion powder. You can add anything you like to spice up the filling. Once fryed, we like to dip these babies into vinegar.

These were great thanks so much for the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was bake them at 400 for 30 minutes instead of frying them.  Next time I might add some shrimp as well like they do in the restaurants. :)

I worked in a chinese restaurant in college, and I could tell by the recipe that these were very close to the one's we used to serve.  Turns out I was right, these taste identical!  I forgot the peanut oil, so I mixed canola and sesame oil (next time I'll do it right), and they were fantastic.  A little time consuming, but not too bad, especially since I'm an 'experienced' egg-roller =)  The only thing I did differently was that I boiled the cabbage for about 3 minutes before rolling, just to soften them up a tiny bit.  They were great!

I love egg rolls but hate paying the high price of buying them at the grocery store. So I was happy to find this recipe to give me an idea of how to make them myself :) I used a beaten egg for "the glue" instead of the flour/water mixture. Also, after cooking my meat I simply added my cabbage, carrots, and 2 tbs. soy sauce, 2 tbs. water and cooked it all together until the cabbage was tender. I used a package of pre shredded angel hair cabbage; I dunno if it was because the cabbage was sliced so thin or what but I had to use twice as much as this recipe called for. Anyway, they came out great!

Double up on the spices and these are fantastic. I also add a little soy sauce and celery seed, and cook the cabbage/carrot mixture with the meat for the last few minutes. I am constantly being asked to make these for parties!

I've made these a couple of times now but had to make several changes because they were very bland and REALLY meaty.  I used 4-5 cups of cabbage (entire bag of premade coleslaw :) which sounds like a lot but the orignaly recipe ends up being too meaty.  Also I added a bit of low-sodium soysauce (1/2-1 T) AND onion powder (1/4-1/2 T).  The onion powder and soy sauce gives these so much flavor!  You HAVE to boil the cabbage for a few minutes before mixing everything together.  Yes, and I fried the first batch and they were greasy like whoa.  My husband and I ended up steaming them for 5-6 minutes and they end up like giant cabbage wontons. They are so good steamed and a lot less fattening.

I never thought homemade eggrolls would be so easy but alas, they are! They taste just as great with ground beed or turkey too. My only suggestion is too add more cabbage. i didn't think there was enough, but then again I prefer more cabbage than meat in my eggrolls.

Definitely listen to the reviews on seasoning. I took "snowflakes" advice and doubled the garlic and ginger added 2 tbs soy sauce and 1/2 tsp Chinese five spice. Gave the filling a really good flavor. Plus using the slaw mix is a no brainer but you need more like 3-4 cups per 1 lb of pork or the ratio is way off. I also deep fried mine at 350 so the edges didn't burn. I'm always stuffing things into egg roll wrappers but this is my first traditional style and is going to remain my go to recipe with the above mentioned alterations.

these were good, not sure they were "the best" but certainly better than what most take out places offer.

I used half a pound of ground pork, a few chicken tenders I had and a few shrimp.  I chopped all the meat fairly small (maybe even considered minced?).  Chopping it smaller really helps to A) make the meat go further, B) not bite into pork and wrapper and C) IMO cuts down on the "greasiness".  I upped the cabbage--maybe doubled?  I cut off 2 cups of cabbage and didn't like the meat to veggie ratio (too much meat) so I kept adding until it looked better.  I had a small amount of cabbage leftover to use as a side the next day so no idea how many cups but basically a whole head of a small cabbage.  I chopped it up small and seasoned and cooked for a bit as others suggested.    Because of the extra cabbage, I upped the seasoning.  I used the thin wrappers (not the thick, tortilla like wrappers) and had just enough for 25-30.  I put the ones I did not cook in a freezer bag and froze.  Love the convenience of just going in and frying a few at a time to go with meals

Just an update...I made these for a second time...used 1/2 pound pork and 10 shrimp...cut up very small...used less cabbage because some of it was going bad and still got nearly 30 eggrolls.  Upped the seasonings a bit and added some onion powder.

Fabulous!  My husband, who considers himself somewhat of an egg roll connoisseur, declared they were as good or better than the Chinese restaurant recently rated the best in our Metro area!  Not as hard to make as I was expecting.  I found that using 1/3 cup of filling, I was able to fill 12 wraps instead of 8.  (Note:  do not attempt to fry in a deep fryer - they constantly roll over onto the fried side).  Thanks for a great recipe, Angela!

My family gobbles these up whenever I make them! Must use Sweet Chili Sauce for dipping for an over the top authentic asian taste!! Chili sauce goes PERFECTLY with these even though I know it's a Thai condiment. (Mae Ploy is brand I use and can find it in my local Walmart).  I too doubled seasoning as it tasted too bland as called for. Also, no need to make flour paste. Dipping your fingers in water and smoothing on seams does the exact same job. Lastly, I mix the seasoned pork immediately after cooking with the cabbage & carrots ahead of time and let sit so the flavors blend together. It also makes the vegetables limp so they're fully cooked after I deep fry them. Canola oil works just great if you don't have peanut oil or if allergic. I keep the pork mixture in fridge for a few days and can assemble and fry in no time for a quick snack.

Have made these twice.  Doubled the seasonings and added soy sauce and 5 spice powder.  The family loves them and using slaw mix makes them pretty easy to make.

In the future I will cut back on the meat and add more cabbage/carrots but that is totally a personal preference issue, not a recipe issue.

They aren't as good as our favorite Cambodian restaurant's but they are a very good substitute.

I tried a little bit of everyones suggestions on this recipe and the fans went wild. The ginger added something my others attempts lacked. I like this variation.

My hubby and I just loved these!  I cooked the pork mixture in the morning (cooking the carrots and cabbage w/it, and adding a few TBS. of chopped onion and a dash of soy sauce).  Then I put it in the fridge until dinnertime, when I was ready to make dinner.  The folding directions were really good on this recipe- which was good for me, since I've never made anything like these before.  I loved the flour paste too- it was just like glue and my egg rolls stayed shut tight.  These made way more than 8- I don't know how many egg wrappers my package had, but I believe it was about 20, and the pork filling was the exact perfect amount for the 20 egg wrappers.  I fried these in my small 8-inch skillet in about an inch of canola oil- 3 at a time.  I kept the temp of the oil steady (with the help of my instant-read thermomter).  We had these with fresh pineapple, sweet and sour sauce and fried rice (both from this site).

We love them!!! I used cole slaw mix, added some chinese 5 spice and some bean sprouts. Served them with ginger/sesame soy dipping sauce and sweet and sour sauce.

These were a great beginner egg roll recipe.  I'd read a couple reviews and made my own variations, as well.  First I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp crushed garlic.  I am a garlic lover so to me just garlic powder didn't seem like enough flavor.  I also only added slightly less than 1 tsp of ginger and did add 2T of soy sauce.  I did the coleslaw mixture, too, but added 2 1/4 cup instead of just 2 cups.  This made 12 egg rolls instead of 8.  We loved these dipped in sweet and sour sauce!!! Also wanted to mention, make sure your oil isn't too hot or else you'll have a big gust of smoke rise up when you throw your first egg roll in :)

These were really good!  I doubled the veggies and added some red pepper flakes to the cabbage mixture.  I kept the meat seperate incase we didn't like them - so I wouldn't waste it.  I'd just put a scoop of the veggie mixture and then a pinch of meat, and a gob of flour paste at the top and roll it up - worked great!  After they were fried I placed them on a  dinner plate that had the sesame seeds on it.  Next time, I'll do this but line the plate w/ a paper plate first.  I pan-fried them in an electric fry pan about 3 mins on each side, into a elongated triangle, sorta.  It was good!  For dessert, I took the leftover wrapper I had, slivered up part of an apple, sprinkeld with cin/sugar and put  a gob of cream cheese in it and folded it in half (into a triangle) and sealed w/ the flour mixture.  Fried it.  Ate it.  YUM!

DO NOT WRAP THESE UNTIL RIGHT BEFORE FRYING!!!  I wrapped them mid-afternoon, covered, and stored in the fridge.  They were a mushy mess, ripped and gooey, that I had to re-wrap. Oh - and don't use the store bought carrots if the shread is too big as they are too brittle that way and poke through while wrapping.  I gave a 4 as the only recipe change I would make is to double the cabbage.

Love love love love them! I do recommend adding half an onion to the cabbage and carrot mixture for extra flavor. Like another reviewer recommended, sauteing the veggies with the meat is a must to make them a little softer! One other thing,if you don't want to end up with 20 eggrolls in one sitting, you can store the extra mixture and in the following day or two you can easily pop the fresh from the fridge mix into an egg roll wrapper and it will be just right once its done frying (Perhaps even more flavorful after the seasonings have set in)!

These were really quick and easy to make.  They tasted a bit bland so next time I will add some minced garlic and onions and some soysauce to the meat mixture to jazz it up a bit.  They were good though with spicy mustard.

I am writing this while still chewing my first homemade egg roll. Even those I am an extremely experienced cook, I have to admit I've been afraid to make them myself. I purchased some store bought pork dumplings which were very tasty, but really expensive for what I got.  So I decided to try my hand at them so that I could eat as many as I want.  I made my first bath of potstickers and was not impressed with my results.  When I purchase the dumpling skins I purchased egg roll wrappers too and thought I'd give it the old college try.  I followed this recipe and some of the suggestions of other reviewers - add a little soy sauce, and about a cup of bean sprouts.  After I cooked the meat I added the remaining ingredients to the skillet and cooked down any of the water coming out of the cabbage, then I rolled and fried them. Heaven!   I was so excited they were perfect!

I must admit that this was my first attempt to make egg rolls. Grocery store brands were lacking in flavor and substance so what did I have to lose. I tried this recipe. Preparation was easy. The flavor is second to none. I am very impressed with this egg roll and plan to include it in many future meals. Family and friends alike were equally impressed! Thanks Angela and keep up the great work.

Good basic go to recipe.  I tweaked it a bit, but I do that with many recipes.  I like green onion and do increase the garlic and ginger.  I also add just a splash of aromatic sesame oil in the filling just before adding/rolling  it in the egg roll wraps and frying.  I serve it with a trifecta of three sauces :  A decent sweet and sour sauce as well as a wasabi based - mustard sauce.   I also serve it with a jazzed up version of soy sauce too.    Perfection.

Really good!!  I added some Sriracha to the mix to spice it up a bit.  I also baked the egg rolls at 425 for 10-15 minutes with a little nonstick cooking spray on them rather than frying to make them a bit healthier.

I should have read some of the reviews before making these. They really need extra seasoning b/c they are kind of bland. Even though I drained on paper towels as suggested mine retained alot of the oil. Sorry, this was not a keeper for me!

Excellent.  I used a prechopped and washed cabbage from the salad aisle.  Be sure not to overfill the rolls or they will not turn out quite as good.  These are great frozen and then reheated in the oven.

These eggrolls were great! I did quite a bit of tweaking, but it's a good recipe to kind of go by. I used chicken instead of pork and I fried the cabbage and carrots. Then I threw in the chicken. I also used a lot of seasoning and it was a hit with my family! I will definitely make them again!

Will sub eggs for meat ( just fry a couple up with the cabbage and sprouts) 
Also can be baked by spraying cooking spray or brushing with olive oil at 325

I followed the examples of other people.  I double the ginger and garlic.  Did not use sesame seeds.  I used the whole bag of cabbage with carrots (16oz) which I minced up more.  I also added a can of small shrimp.  They were awesome and easy to do.  Marie

I've made this recipe 3 times and only spiced it up a little to suit our taste. I added pepper flakes to the sausage and a little soy sauce to the cabbage. 
To freeze: Fry until golden brown, cool, wrap 2 in wax paper, and wrap in foil or place in a plastic container. When ready to eat, thaw and warm in toaster oven heated at 350 for about 10 minutes. 
Wonderful! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Easy recipe; but extremely bland. The balance of ingredients were nice; but not the flavor.

A couple of notes. I used fresh rather than ground ginger and ground garlic.. 
Also, I added hoisin, sesame oil, and a dash of fish sauce. Also, using fresh ginger and garlic; I added a lot more. I tasted the pork and continually added the ingredients until I got a nice flavor.

One tip that I like to do is that the pork should be rendered very slowly, so it doesn't dry out. I cooked the pork in just a bit of water, simmer slowly. The water evaporates, but leaves you with a very fine moist ground pork.

It is a nice recipe for ease; but extremely BORING in flavor

These are amazing! And quite simple! I had never made anything like this before so I was a little nervous. I used coleslaw mix (and boy did that make this an easy recipes). I not only seasoned the pork with the ginger and garlic powder but I also seasoned the coleslaw mix with it too.  It was wonderful! I have made these many times and my husband and children rave about them. I also took them to a couple's night and everyone wanted the recipe.

These were great!!  They weren't hard to make.  When I told my Mom I was making Egg Rolls, she wished me luck.  None was needed!  The original recipe is great as is; the second batch I made I played around with the seasonings to my family's preferences.  I did, however, cut back on the amount of sausage and, afterward,  wished I had not.  For making egg rolls my first time this recipe was right on the money and gave me inspiration for trying it with different ingredients.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This is great recipe to help start you out. I added a can of cooked shrimp and a mixture of soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of creamy peanut butter and pinch of sugar to the cooked cabbage and pork mixture, very yummy, the whole family goobled them up and asked for more. This was a great recipe to help feed my chinese food addiction. Thanks!

Very good. I used a chicken and pork combination on mine and added chopped waterchestnuts, more ginger, more soy, a little sesame oil and a little dry hot mustard. I had some cruddy wrappers, so wrapping was an issue (but totally separate from the recipe). Thanks - I don't want to do this again for a while, but only because I hate wrapping. :)

I marinated the pork in soysauce first for an hour.  Also make sure to drain the cabbage and carrots (I also added some celery) REALLY WELL to prevent soggy egg rolls.

I think these would have been better with a little bit of tweaking.  I usually make the egg roll recipe that is on the back of the egg roll wrappers that I buy, which includes a lot of other vegetables that gives the egg rolls a little bit more substance.  I added more cabbage than the recipe called for, but still ended up with an egg roll filled mostly with pork.  If I were to make these again, I would add in a lot more cabbage and carrots.

These came out fantastic after I made a few modifications. I only used half a pound of ground pork (seasoned with garlic, ginger and soy sauce) and it was plenty.  I also added a few finely chopped scallions and some finely chopped bamboo shoots. I seasoned the whole mixture to taste with more garlic, soy sauce, and a few dashes of sesame oil. This is a really great base recipe, but definitely needs more seasonings to really bring out the flavors. Next time I'll try adding a can of tiny shrimp.

These were fun to make, but I found them to be a bit too bland for my taste even though I used way less meat, lots more cabbage, flavored wok oil, scallions, sugar, sesame oil and lots of salt.  My toddler thought they were great.  Although I will look for a recipe that I enjoy eating more, they were lots of fun to make.  Thanks for the jump start.

OMG this recipe was PHENOMENAL.  I have never written a review before but I had to because these egg rolls were to so yummy. The only thing that I changed was the type of oil I used.  (I am allergic to peanuts so I substituted with canola oil instead.)  This recipe is quick and easy and my family wants them again tonight.  Thank you for this recipe.

Just made these for my family and they were a hit!  My 3yr old gobbled them up and my 4yr old wants them made for his birthday!  I used brussel sprouts and ground beef in place of the ground pork and cabbage because it was what I had on hand.  Also used fresh ginger and fresh garlic instead of dried.  Super yummy!  Can't wait to experiment some more with this recipe.

as written, this is no more than a two star recipe.  I agree with other reviewers about the egg rolls being bland and not full of flavor.  

The second time I made them, I adjusted the recipe so much, it's now completely different and so much better.

I finely chopped up two chicken breast and sautéed them with diced onion, chopped garlic, fresh ginger, salt, onion powder, garlic powder and a couple of dashes soy sauce.  I added this to the shredded cabbage, added a bag of mung bean sprouts and re-seasoned to taste as necessary.  Modifying, or rather changing the recipe made it five-stars.

I made this tonight but did a few changes . I used minced garlic, Added 2 Tablespoon Soy Sauce, 1/2 tsp Salt 1/2 tsp Pepper ( probably could add more seasoning to taste. I didn't want to over do it the first time) and 1/2 onion. Did not made flour paste just used water. I also Baked them at 400 for about 14 minutes. Baking them won't be as crispy as frying but I am staying with the healthier route. Served with Sweet and Sour Sauce.. Turned out great.

Awesome recipes! Decided to cook the veggies in olive oil for about five minutes to 'soften' them. After mixing the meat and veggies together made a 'sauce' to pour over the mixture for added flavor. In a separate bowl mixed: 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of sugar and 2 tablespoons of sweet and sour sauce. I poured this 'sauce' in the meat and veggies mixture prior to filling the egg rolls. This provided a lot of flavor and there was no need for extra sauce to dip the egg rolls in.

These were wonderful!  I will use this recipe often.  I made a couple of changes.  I used 2 cans of chicken breast meat, browned in margarine with a little black pepper and onion powder.  I used half a bag of coleslaw mix, sauteed with soy sauce and lemon pepper seasoning until wilted.  Then I used canola oil to fry them since I didn't have peanut oil.  They were so easy and full of flavor!

These are very good egg rolls if you'd like a simple recipe for them.  These taste fantastic steamed instead of fried and dipped in Sweet and Sour Sauce 1 from this site.

I appreciate the straightforward directions in this recipe, because I'm always wary of making fried things. These wouldn't have been all that tasty if I hadn't incorporated other reviewers' suggestions, though, so I appreciate those as well. 

My adaptations:
fresh grated ginger (1 tbsp) instead of the dried, fresh minced garlic (1 tbsp) in addition to the garlic powder, black pepper, numerous splashes of soy sauce, double the cabbage/carrot mixture (and I threw it in with the meat for a minute or so to wilt it a bit), and 1/4 cup green onions added to the filling mix after it was cooked. 

I don't know if doubling the veggies and using extra lean ground pork gave me twice as much filling as other reviewers or what, but I ended up getting 21 fat eggrolls (using the 7-inch wrapper, as specified) instead of the specified 8. The more the merrier, I guess! 

The recipe that came with the eggroll wrappers mentioned that you can bake these. I'm sure they're not as tasty that way, but it'd sure save on the cost of oil. Peanut oil is $$$$$$!

I make this recipe with chicken instead of pork and its excellent that way too. The peanut oil makes for a lot of flavor. Just a hint: After taking the egg rolls out of the oil, prop them upright to set the oil drain off, otherwise its a greasy soggy mess. I don't recommend reheating these the next day. They become soggy mush.

This is wonderful.  I love egg rolls, but had never tried making them from scratch.  I used leftover pork roast and omitted the sesame seeds, as a family preference.  They were loved by all.  I do think next time I will add a bit more garlic, ginger, and some soy sauce to the meat mixture.

Made these today. I followed reviewers advice and doubled garlic, ginger and added soy sauce.  I cooked pork with garlic and set aside.  Cooked the carrots, cabbage, ginger and soy sauce in a couple of tablespoons of water until just wilted.  Mixed all together and wrapped in eggroll wrappers then dropped into deep fryer with peanut oil.  I halfed the recipe and one package of 30 ea eggroll wrappers was exactly right,right to the last wrapper. I didnot try them, not a big eggroll fan, but my daughter, who loves them and I made them for her, jumped right in and gave them 5 stars right off the bat.

Awesome starting point recipe. I added extra ginger, about 1/4 cup soy sauce, a can of bean sprouts and celery. I doubled the recipe this time because of my 4 teenage sons. They can't get enough. I also used chicken. Next time I'm going to use shrimp.

I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 simply because it sounded just a bit to blan for me. I changed the recipe to my liking but cannot rate this recipe for my creation. This recipe however is a great starting point for those who have never made egg rolls before.

These were very easy to make. I did add oriental 5 spice & soy sauce to the pork mixture, which made it suberb!
 I use the chinese 5 spice a lot in my cooking, and it can be found online, or find the recipe here at all recipe. It is a mixture of anise seed, cinnamon, ginger, fennel, clove.

So delicious!  Like others, I added 1 Tbsp soy and doubled the ginger and garlic.  Instead of cabbage and carrots, I simply used a pre-shredded coleslaw mix.  (Use the whole bag!)  When I compared to the recipe on the egg roll wrappers, their recipe included oyster sauce, so I figured I'd give it a shot.  The addition of the oyster sauce puts it over the top!  Absolutely amazing.  The only thing I'm changing next time is fresh ginger and garlic.

really really good as written - I tweaked by adding 1 T of crushed garlic & a few T of stir fry sauce & soy sauce and then baked them at 425 in a cookie sheet smeared with vegetable oil - cooked til crisp on bottom, then flipped til crisp on the other side.  Really really good! :)

Two problems for me.  One, very bland recipe as is.  I ended up adding more spices and soy sauce.  Two, I had a hard time cooking up the egg rolls.  This is the first time attempting to make them, and didn't know that I needed to moisten the spring roll sheets first (there wasn't instructions on the package either).  They also didn't turn golden brown when fried, instead they turned out crispy white.  I love egg rolls and hope to try making them again.  This recipe gave me a foundation, but I think I needed more guidance in frying, and will research better spices.

These were great.  I added Asian seasoning and a bit of Oyster Sauce. I did not do the flour mixture, but just wet the ends with a little water.  Also, I BAKED them in the oven at 425 for about 12-15 minutes. Be sure and oil the pan (mine stuck)  :(  I did not use oil b/c I read if you do not add oil on them they will be crispier out of the oven. Next time I think I will add some green onions (I didn't have any), hot chili paste, and fresh garlic. I really liked the Ginger in it!  Thank you for the recipe!!  (PS ~ I also used a leftover pork chop. I chopped it up finely with my handy chopper tool!)

These are delicious! They are a nice basic recipe that can be added onto. I make mine with chicken, extra spices, pinch of sugar and a splash of soy sauce. I also make my own wrappers, which really makes all the difference. For two rolls, I use 1 tsp egg yolk, 1/2 c flour and 1/8 c cold water. For lots, I do 2 yolks, 2 c flour and 1 c cold water. Mix them all, knead for 5 minutes. Let rest for about 15-30 min (I make the filling while the dough rests). Pull off balls about 2 1/2 inches in diameter. Roll out on cornstarch in the shape of a square until desired size and thickness (about 7 inches). These are delicious, soft and you can't find them at any restaurant! Well worth the 45 minutes it takes!

Great recipe except I did change a few things; I used pork sausage, fresh ginger, and added onions that I sauteed with the sausage till semi opaque. I did add a few extra shakes of garlic powder and probably had about 3 cups of cabbage total. Instead of peanut oil we used sunflower oil(something new out there..healthier for us!). My husband thought they were better than any he's ever eaten at a restaurant. Lots of flavor in ours maybe because we used the sausage and fresh ginger.  We forgot to add soy sauce like some reviews suggested.  These were awesome!

these are excellent. If you are looking for a little more seasoning - try adding a tablespoon of Oyster Sauce to the ground pork mixture. A little richer than soy and adds quite a bit of flavor.

I have always bought egg rolls ,with the economy the way it is I decided to make my own and found this recipe. Oh My Goodness !!!! what have I been missing.I have never had a egg roll so good anywhere. I did add 3 cups cabbage, 2 stalks of diced celery and I didn't have spring onions so I grated a tablespoon of valdia onion and sweated it with the cabbage mixture. I also used beaten egg to seal my wraps.The recipe made 20 and I served them with sweet and sour sauce.Want be buying them in the store any longer these were so good and easy. Yummy....Yummy. next time I am going to add tiny shrimp and mushrooms and water chestnuts.

My husband and I were trying to figure out what was wrong with these, because something was significantly different than the kind you would get at any Chinese place.  The flavor was fine after I followed reviewers' advice to double the garlic and ginger and add soy sauce.  Then we realized that the problem is that these are WAAAAY too meaty.  And this is coming from some meat-loving people!  Most egg rolls are mostly veggies with a little meat mixed in, but a whole pound of meat for only 8 little egg rolls?  Proportions are way way off.  I would cut the meat down to a half or quarter of the amount and up the cabbage and carrot mixture significantly if I made these again, and definitely still adjust the flavors as I indicated earlier.  One star lost for proportion, the other lost for the need to soup up the flavor.

I've tried these baked and fried and they're definitely better fried.  If you're gonna have egg rolls, then have egg rolls and fry them.  I also increased the spices and added a little bit of hot pepper sesame oil to the meat/veggie mixture. I also used ground turkey instead of ground pork.

You only have to read the ingredients to know it will be bland. But I'm giving 5 stars as this is an excellent base recipe. You can add whatever you want to your own liking. I used 4 cups cabbage, added 2 green onions,sesame oil, soy sauce and fresh garlic.  I omitted the flour water mixture and used a raw egg to bind the ingredients. I used another egg to brush along edges of rolls to make it stick together better. I didnt roll with the point toward me. Did them as a square.  They were really fast and better than some restaurant ones I've tasted.

Without any sauce in the meat - the innards fell out when eaten.  I added 2 tbsp of Szechuan sauce to the meat, which binds everything together perfectly and give a great flavor.  I have used to recipe with both ground chicken and ground pork.

I usually make 2 batches at a time and fry half the batch at just 3 minutes.  They go into the freezer and are reheated at 350 for 5 minutes.  Prefect crispy taste!

These came out wonderful. I was slightly intimidated by the idea but had picked up the wrappers on a whim and decided to give it a try.   I actually had an "oops" when too much powdered ginger fell into the pot - but it was not a problem. I think you have to remember that the vegetable mixture is not being seasoned so the pork mixture is better when heavily seasoned. I also added about a tablespoon of soy sauce to the meat. I threw in a whole bunch of sliced scallions too since I had some on hand.  My husband is picky and he felt these were just as good as any Chinese restaurant would serve. Will definitely add to the recipe arsenal!

Excellent alternative to eating out. Very flavorful. This was the first time I had worked with egg roll wrappers, so I didn't wrap them very well the first time, but I caught on by the second time I made these. Tip: If you do not want to cook the whole batch the same day, only wrap what you want. I leave the wrappers in their package and the filling in a bowl, both in the fridge until ready to make more. If you make them up and stick them in fridge, wrapper gets sticky and rips easy.

Excellent!  Even my 6 year old at these and he is very very picky!  The only change I made was that I used 2 cloves minced garlic instead of the powder, I used a bag of coleslaw, and added a handful of green onion.  I also didn't use the flour paste mixture I just used a little egg and water to seal the rolls. WONDERFUL!!

These are awesome!  Every cook is going to tinker with the spices to their liking, otherwise we wouldn't be good cooks.  Since I have a 2 & 5 year old, I put all my veggies & meat in the food processor to chop it fine, so I didn't have to see the danglies hanging from their faces.  THEY TURNED OUT GREAT with the kids and hubby begging for more.

great start for an egg roll recipe but i use bean sprouts in my egg rolls along with the cabbage and carrots. coleslaw mix would be a great substitute as the ratios of cabbage to carrot doesn't need to be calculated. i also add fresh ginger, fresh garlic, soy sauce and oyster sauce to enhance flavors. i dip these "lumpia," as we call it in filipino, in a vinegar/garlic dip.

This was our first time making egg rolls, and they came out just ok. When we make this recipe again we will cook the cabbage ahead, and perhaps add some onion for a different flavor.  These were definately NOT like the egg rolls from our favorite take-out place.

My little brother always refused to order or try an egg roll, but these tempted him too much and he broke down. Not only did he try one and like it, he ate three. My whole family enjoyed these and my boyfriend made me use the leftover wrappers to make him more the next day(I was out of pork so I substituted chicken strips)and he loved them both ways. This will deffinately be made again and again! Thanks Angela!

I thought these were pretty good.  I ended up using shredded chicken and sauteed the chicken, carrots, cabbage, ginger and garlic with about 2 tablespoons of soy sauce for about 20 minutes.  After reading reviews mentioning the "bland" factor, I added some red pepper flakes and a pinch of cayenne to the mixture and thought it tasted great.  The ginger and soy sauce were the perfect combo of sweet/spicy and tasted great!  I also used rice paper wrappers instead of egg roll wrappers but I wouldn't necessarily recommend that to others.  All in all, good bones but just needed some tweaking.  Thanks Angela!

I've made these egg rolls several times; they taste wonderful(not bland at all). I did add extra
cabbage, carrots and thinly sliced green peppers. I however used vegetable oil instead, and omitted
the sesame seeds. A good recipe, but I'd have to say mine are abit better. I'll have to submit my 
recipe. Cindi Bauer - Marshfield,WI.

I made this recipe while we were camping and wow what a hit they were. I added more garlic, ginger and included soy sauce.  I made a dipping sauce of spicy mustard and ketchup which sounds gross but its really good for some reason - they serve it like that at a Chinese restaurant we frequent.

This recipe is wonderful and very versatile! So I basically cleaned out the fridge put it in an egg roll and baked it!:) Well, not exactly. So I mixed a roll of mild ground pork sausage and a roll of ground turkey, browned together, put in my other ingredients~chopped cabbage, carrots and spices. Once that was in my egg roll wrappers, and brushed with small bit of oil, baked at 400° for 10 mins, turned and 5 mins. Watch out! These puppies bake fast. Served with dipping sauce! And yes, they freeze wonderfully too! Super delish!:)

I liked how easy these were to make and surprised I haven't tried home made egg rolls before as much Asian cooking as I do.  Because of that, I have plenty of condiments to spruce up the flavor!  I used the slaw mix and added a bit more shredded carrots, added a Tbsp. each of soy & Mirin, used a large minced clove of fresh garlic instead of powder, and increased the amount fresh ginger called for. I added a squirt of Sriracha sauce for kick.  Hard to stop eating these!  (These can be frozen!)

Liked this recipe, I made it for my Scandal viewing party, it was a hit with my guests. I made turkey ones for my non pork eaters, strangely enough the pork ones were the first to go. I Have to make it with the peanut oil next time because the canola oil was way to heavy for this recipe

I loved the basic recipe, and have fooled around with it a lot.  Based on what is available in the house, I have used ground beef instead of pork, a bag of coleslaw in place of cabbage/carrots, and the frozen ginger and garlic cubes.  I once threw in some sliced mushrooms and scallions and it tasted great.  I also added a Tbs of BBQ Hoisin sauce to the sautéed meat and now I do it every time.  

The recipe was such a hit that I found my picky, weight-watching brother-in-law with his head in the fridge, looking for a THIRD helping.

You can freeze and reheat them in the oven - and they taste just as good.  I would recommend not reheating on a high temperature.  The outside can burn before the inside is defrosted.  20-25 min on 250 should be fine.

I now assemble egg roll nuggets together in a jIFFY! I make a huge amount @ once then freeze portions amounts to how many i want to make each time i want em! 

HUGE yummy taste adjustments: use fresh ginger peel/ cut & mince amount desired to your taste, use 2 tablespoons of oyster sauce in mix, save time by using already prepped dole cabbage bag (shredded carrots&cabbage) these additions make for a SUPERIOR mouth smackin egg roll recipe!

Cheaper and better than takeout. The recipe was ok but I use fresh ginger and garlic and add some hoisin sauce, sesame oil, green onions and soy sauce to the ground pork.

Had to add couple tbs of soysauce and teriaki sauce to it inside filling. Also added onion I also added egg to the inside that made it slightly better. These are definitely better the next day because the cabbage is more flavorful.

as it stands, this recipe would be pretty mediocre. but as most reviewers have said, with the proper seasonings it's pretty tasty. i added garlic and teriyaki sauce to the cabbage/carrots and let them saute a bit. i used vegan chicken instead of pork and an orange sauce for dipping.

Love these. This recipe is easy to follow and versatile. I used roast pork instead of ground. Fried in veggie oil. Added green onions and 2 Tbs of Oyster Sauce to the pork mixture. Excellent!

Ratio of meat to  cabbage was way off.  We added a lot to make this work. During the cooking I got curious so I looked up other egg roll recipies on other sites and decided to doubled the cabbage, added soy sauce, added some scrambled egg, etc. Still seemed like too much pork.

Excellent! Not 5 stars, because I did make some changes. I used fresh ginger, instead of dried. I also doubled the pork mix, and then split it in 2 bowls. In 1, I used a coleslaw bagged mix, in the other a broccoli slaw bagged mix. Then, I sprinkled some soy into each bowl, maybe a Tbs, and some sesame oil, maybe a Tsp. Used canola oil. These are so easy and SO delicious!

This was just an okay recipe. We made it exactly as written and it was just missing something. Maybe next time I'll make some adjustments, but if I do that, then it won't be this recipe any longer. They were edible, but not the best we've ever had either.

So good but I made the following changes: I scrambled 2 eggs with mild pork sausage. Doubled the ginger and garlic powder. Used a coleslaw mix. And made the following dipping sauce: 3/4 cp sugar, 4 Tbsp ketchup, 1/2 cp vinegar, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, 1/2 tsp garlic powder.

Yum!! I had to change things up a bit though. Taking advice from other reviews I added onion and sauteed it with the pork. Also added 1/4 tsp 5 spice plus 1/2 tsp. onion and garlic powder. I also added some 2-3 tbsp. soy sauce, for more flavor. Some reviews also said they were bland so my kicking it up a notch made them even better! I would recommend this recipe definetely if your add a little more to the mix. I would rate it a 5 with my extras but overall a good start to eggrolls!

Very good simple recipe.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and added a bit more seasoning.  I also added finely diced red bell pepper to the pork and chopped scallion, bean sprouts and water chestnuts to the cabbage mixture.  Turned out great.

These were amazing! We used the coleslaw mix instead of shredding cabbage and fried them in veggie oil. The only thing I'd do differently is add less soy sauce to the cabbage mix. Yum!!

Great basic start,try using the slaw mix,add some fresh sprouts,like the onion,or broccoli sprouts,they look like fine hairs.Try steaming the veggies to soften slightly before adding to meat and seasonings..cook fillings early in day,cool,adjust flavorings before filling the egg rolls,cooling the mixture makes rolling easier,also convenient to put extras away for later.Peanut oil has a higher smoking point,works well with all frying.The sauce I like to use is the plum type,or sweet and sour.

Good recipe.  I made as recipe states, but next time I will decrease meat by half  and increase cabbage to 3 cups and add some bean sprouts.   Overall a really easy and tasty recipe, Thanks!

Made this for New Years - great flavour.... everyone really like them!  The only thing I would do next time is only fry a couple at a time, because they stuck together, but that was my mistake.... the actual recipe is great!

I am giving this recipe a three.  Yes, it was tasty, but two things really turned me off.  One being they were way too greasy even after letting them sit on a paper towel to drain.  I did use my Little Daddy Fryer, so if I try it again, I would probaby opt to fry them in a pan with less oil.  Second, way to much pork for my taste.  I think half pork and half cabbage mixture would be a better mix.  I used the coleslaw prepared bag and it worked out super good and would definetly suggest it.

With the changes I made, this was definitely 5 star! 1.) I doubled the amount of spices. 2.) I subbed the cabbage with shredded zucchini, added some shredded green bell pepper, and green onions along with the carrots, which I sauteed a bit to soften before assembling. I also put a bit of teriyaki sauce in the veggies. 3.) Instead of the pork, I used shredded teriyaki chicken. 4.) I didn't deep fry, rather I covered the bottom of a pan in olive oil, and cooked them until brown and crispy. I served with Sweet and Sour Sauce, white rice and sesame green beans. Thanks for a wonderful basic recipe!

I found out, after I'd made my shopping list, that my grocery store doesn't carry ground pork or egg roll wrappers.  I checked another grocery store, and they didn't have them either.  I used to make egg rolls with my grandmother ten years ago, and she lived in a very small town about forty-five minutes from here and they sold them there.  ?!?  Oh well.  So, I used ground turkey and made my own wrappers.  I also used fresh garlic instead of the powder.  The homemade wrappers didn't turn out so well, but the egg rolls were good.  They were three stars with my wrappers, but I'm sure they'd easily score four with the real thing -- so I'm rating four.

I used this recipe as a base for my egg rolls. I had some shrimp I needed to use so I scaled it down to 2 (for 4oz of shrimp) and ended up using a little more cabbage and carrot than it called for.  I added 3 green onions, fresh garlic, fresh ginger, and a drizzle of oyster sauce.  I chopped up the shrimp and added them raw to the mixture.  It ended up making 7 egg rolls.  I used olive oil in a very small skillet.  I froze 4 and fried up three serving with Sweet and Sour Sauce I (from allrecipes) and were wonderful.  Will make again, maybe with the pork as called for.

I used this recipe as a base.  I used a napa cabbage, soy sauce and a splash of oyster sauce, bit extra garlic, green onions, bean sprouts and bamboo shoots. I didn't want to fry them so, I boiled them in chicken broth flavored with soy and oyster sauce and green onions.  It made the best soup.  It almost tasted like my favorite soup "Won-Ton soup"  I also didn't wrap them like egg rolls, instead I folded them like pot-stickers. Thank you for theidea.  I will use this again for eggs rolls next time (with my changes)

After fainting at the price of buying grocery frozen I am a first timer for making egg rolls. I re-rolled my first one several times before I got it right. I got faster after that. If you try to roll the filling up fairly tightly the first point of the wrapper (toward you) inevitably gets tucked and folded over (also toward you) inside. Your first roll over has to have wide coverage of the filling and the edges of the wrapper sides, the envelope style folds, must overlap the center somewhat to hold in the filling. I didn’t bother with the flour paste glue, just used a little water to stick the last point down. The wrappers are pretty easy to work with after you get the hang of it. I used pre-cooked pork butt I had (a lb. seemed like too much though, used about 1/3 lb. and mine still made 9 rolls in the end) and and added some sesame seeds to the filling and a little soy sauce to the rest of the basics (not enough to make it overly wet) and was impressed with the restaurant flavor of the filling. I rolled them ahead, covered and refrigerated them until time to fry. Edible but not restaurant suitable was the color and texture of my fried wrappers. Dark brown, not golden, and a bit chewy. I will tinker with my frying next time. Oil temp may have been too high. Used veg oil but I would like to try peanut next time. Those little extra special flavors make it truly restaurant worthy when it is not something you usually do at home. Not the recipe’s fault but didn’t care for my Kikko

these are FANTASTIC! I say it in all caps, because I cannot stress how wonderful these egg rolls are. If I could give them 10 stars, I would. I use my deep-fryer to cook them...and they are just so darn good. Everyone who tries them raves. Excellent recipe.
EDIT 7/10: I still make these all the time! I've found however that over the months I've gotten up to a point where I add a lot more garlic and ginger than calls for, which is ok. It gives it more flavor. Also, I add soy sauce to the coleslaw mix instead of water, and let it simmer because I like it cooked more. 
My husband's employees have a monthly sales contest, and the winner gets a batch of egg rolls. They're just epic. Thanks so much Angela.
EDIT:  2/26/11 STILL making these golden nuggets! To save time I now cook the pork, garlic and ginger in a dash of canola oil. Then drizzle with soy sauce and add a bag of 'coleslaw mix'. Quickly saute and set aside to cool. It takes about 10 minutes and it saves so much time. Also, i cook them in Canola oil. Allergic to peanut, and Canola is the best option that I've found. Try them with Tastefully Simple's Asian Honey Mustard. These are just beyond....

This is a really good recipe. I added salt to the somewhat bland meat/veggie mixture and the natural flavors popped right out. I love the fresh ginger flavor. I used the ready-made cabbage/carrot bagged mix from the store and added a few more carrots. It was great. I also cooked the veggies in with the ground pork so they would wilt a little; we like that texture more than crunchy, stiff veggies. I may tinker a bit with the spices again, but either way, this recipe is a five-star appetizer. We had these before fried rice and sweet and sour pork. I am so pleased that I will probably serve these over the holidays a time or two.

These were very easy and good. I used davoy cabbage and only half pound ground pork. I used half a carrot and 3/4 head of cabbage. Used 1/3 cup in each roll, I'll try to tuck more in I think. I used a thermometer to gage my oil. Next time I think 350 will be hot enough. Mine were dark crispy. Put the oven on at 275 to keep them warm. Made pork fried rice and used the same mixture to have two items. Used 3 TBSP sake and 6 TBSP mirin, 2 TBSP sugar, and 6 TBSP soy sauce, to flavor and it was perfect! A squeeze of garlic chili, and about 2 TBSP hoisin. Thank you very much!!!

I didn't use any pork (I just used a little more cabbage), and I added bean sprouts (about 1/3 cup), fresh ginger (about 1 tbsp), fresh garlic (2 cloves), chives (about 1/4 cup) and a dash of soy sauce, and these came out fantastic. Also, as others recommend, using pre-cut cole slaw mix makes preparing these so easy. I used a flour and water paste (the same one as in the recipe) around the edges of the wrapper to make a tight seal.

Very good! I used the pre-shredded cabbage and carrot mix that you can buy in the produce section of the supermarket. I will make these in the future, but will play with the ingredients. Bean sprouts and shrimp, maybe? Thanks!

Basic recipe good. Doctored up the filling with more ginger, garlic powder, onion powder, and a little Montreal Steak seasoning (for the pepper and salt.)  Taste filling before rolling up the egg rolls and season according to your taste. I steamed the cabbage also.  Be sure to shred cabbage and carrots almost to a minced texture for ease in rolling. I also used regular vegetable oil.  They fry instantly so watch carefully!  Yummy!  I will make them again.  My kids loved them too with packaged sweet sauce from the Chinese restaurant.

These were very good egg rolls. The only comment I have is there is too much pork in recipe for a true egg roll. Next time I will use less pork and add more cabbage and carrots. Recipe is a keeper. Will make these often.-----Thanks

My family and I really enjoyed these fabulous egg rolls.  I added a few extra ingredients of my own and it turned out great.  I put in half a pound of salad shrimp, 1 scrambled egg, half a teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of pepper.  For the sealing paste I used corn starch and water.  I cooked them in a Wok with the same amount of oil.  I have been looking for a couple of months for a yummy recipe and I think I have finally found it.  Thank you so much for submitting this recipe.

We loved this recipe.  Remember to let the filling cool to room temperature before preparing the roll, otherwise, the egg roll will be soggy and won’t fry up crispy.

Super easy.  Didn't use peanut oil to fry because I didn't have it! Used 8 cups of  premix coleslaw mix  and hot sausage because that's what I'd inadvertently pulled out of the freezer. The coleslaw mix reduced in volume the minute the warm cooked sausage was combined.  Doubled the spices and added chopped cilantro and green onions. Very good and easy, peasy. Made far more than the 8 rolls predicted in the recipe -- about 16-18 rolls.  My family was eating them as fast as they were fried!  Decadent too but sometimes we all just need that ! Need to find an easy dipping sauce now; the one I threw together was good but needed improvement. Thanks for sharing!

We loved them. The only thing different that I did was make them completely dairy casein free.

I too cooked the cole slaw mixture with water and soy sauce before adding it to the pork. I added green onions as well. I cooked it with brushed peanut oil in the oven for 20 minutes at 425 and the crunch was not that great. I think corn oil would be better.  I forgot to turn them 1/2 way through. But the flavor was good. The boys gave me a 6 rating.  I then wrapped up the rest of the mixture with spring roll wrappers and also added scrambled egg inside of it.  It was more flavorful but the wrappers were too thin and broke.  It might work if I double wrapped it with spring rolls. Corn oil did crunch it up better. Update 9/19 You need an awesome dipping sauce for this. Mix together 6TBS Light soy sauce, 3 TBS rice vinegar, 1 tsp chili garlic sauce or even sriracha sauce, 1-2 tsp fresh grated ginger root,  2 TBS brown sugar or white, 1-2 garlic cloves chopped, 1 TBS sesame oil. and a few green onions chopped if you have them. YUM.

I did a batch of pork as well as chicken and got rave reviews.  I used a  bag coleslaw instead of carrMarioots and cabbage.  I think it added extra flavor and  an extra crunch factor.  Super easy and very GOOD!

This is a great base recipe. I always look to it again before I make eggrolls to get an idea. But I do change it up a bit. I make mine with ground beef, just because that's what I have on hand. I use extra garlic and ginger and add soy sauce as well as a tiny bit of teriyaki or fish sauce for more flavor. I cook the cabbage and carrots as well as onion at the end with the beef. And then take it off the heat and add another cup or so of cabbage and carrot for some crunch. But the biggest thing is tasting and adding seasoning to your liking. We all have different ideas on how these should taste, but this recipe gives a really great start to eggrolls. Also cooking them is something you have to perfect. I use very little oil but am watching them constantly. Remember don't crowd the pan and watch the heat. Mine always come out crispy and delicious. Use your best judgment and favorite tastes when making these.

As with some other reviewers, I doubled the seasoning and added some soya sauce to the pork mixture and used a whole bag of coleslaw mix instead of cabbage and carrots.  The taste was AMAZING, but we found them overly oily, so I will likely bake them or pan-fry  in just a tiny bit of oil next time.  Because there WILL be a next time!

These were very good. Family loved them. I only had 1\2 lb pork so that is what I used, left everything else the same maybe a little extra cabbage was the only change. And I used canola oil to fry them. Fairly easy and quick! I made a sweet and sour sauce to dip. Thanks for the recipe Angela!

This recipe was delicious!  It was not only easy to prepare but also easy to cook.  The only thing I will tweak in the recipe will be the use of the peanut oil.  I'm not sure the flavor warrants spending the extra money. I too, double the garlic and ginger.  I also used already shredded cole slaw mix.

these were delicious.. like Snowflake, i added some chinese 5 spice and like DEBK68 i used pork sausage (mild), i used fresh garlic and fresh ginger so we didn't have any issues with it being bland and probably added more carrot than called for.. we made 10 egg rolls in all and at the end i was adding a lot more stuffing b/c we only had 10 egg roll wrappers to use.. didn't add the flour and water mixture and also didn't precook the ingredients.. just mashed all together and added in raw.. the frying cooked it through (checked with meat thermometer).. ty so much for this recipe

This recipe is a great base! I'm sure it's bland if you follow it exactly, so read the reviews for additions! I cooked 1 lb. pork in a small-ish spaghetti pot. I seasoned it with 1 tsp each: ground ginger, garlic powder, onion powder, celery salt, Chinese 5 Spice (McCormick), and a few dashes of soy sauce. I then added a 16oz bag of coleslaw mix; it filled up the pot. I then re-seasoned again, the same as above and stirred to mix the cabbage and pork. Filled as directed, wetting my fingers with drops of water to seal instead of the "glue". They kept flipping themselves in the oil, but I had better luck by putting them in sealed-side down. Next time I won't add as much of the Chinese seasoning to the cabbage, probably only 1/2 tsp. It has cinnamon in it. However it did make a huge difference in making the egg rolls taste "Chinese". I made a total of 17 egg rolls with the filling.

We ended up using the cole slaw mix, doubled the spices, used minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and skipped the flour mix to seal them. Water by itself works just fine. My Chinese food hating hubby ate 4 of these and asked me to start making them regularly. My only problem was how greasy they were but after research figured out what I did wrong. If the oil temp drops to much when you place them in to cook that happens. Delish!

These are pretty good.  Only change is that I used the coleslaw mix.  These seemed to be lacking something, not sure what it is. I put soy sauce in the mixture and they still seemed bland.

I have to rate this low. I couldn't find egg roll wrappers, so I used spring roll skins, which was all I could find. Also didn't have peanut oil, or canola oil, so I used vegetable oil. Mine turned out a greasy mess. Possibly my fault for the substitutions.

I liked these quite a bit.  Daughter thought they were "ok".  Slightly precooked the cabbage/carrot mixture.  (I bought a bad of coleslaw mix).  I did add about a tablespoon of sesame oil to the mixture before filling the rolls. Didn't have peanut oil, so used vegetable oil. Easier to make than I expected.  Would play with adding different veggies in the future perhaps.

These were ok. I didn't like the ground pork, it was too much like ground beef. I think next time i would use pork strips marinated in ahso sauce. Also I felt like it needed more seasoning, I also made vegetarian eggrolls using this as a base recipe but I added the ginger and garlic to the cabbage and carrots. I also added a tsp of soy sauce to the mixture.

These were alright. I was a little disappointed because the reviews said they taste so authentic, but not similar to the ones I have at our favorite, local, Chinese restaurant. There was something missing and I will try to find the ingredient that makes the difference. Satisfying but not extraordinary.

First of all-Wow! This was my husbands father's day dinner request, since he grew up eating his Mom's. Naturally I was hesitant to try these since the MIL is such an amazing cook. But now I can say I have found the ultimate egg roll recipe! My first try making it and they turned out amazing! The husband heartily approves!

This was my first time making egg rolls and I thought they were just okay but they are better than Chinese take out - I'm used to my mom's Vietnamese egg rolls. No one can make them like mom can! I did add soy sauce, fish sauce, mushrooms, ground shrimp and used fresh garlic instead of powder. My husband thought they were great

The best egg rolls I've ever eaten were made with mung bean sprouts and some cabbage and a good amount of black pepper.

Very easy, very yummy!  My whole family loved them.  My husband said they were the best he's every had.  I shredded the cabbage vs using the slicer on my processor.  It gave them a finer texture which my family liked compared to the stringy cabbage from take out.

Used shredded cabbage and added fresh garlic, a little more ginger and some soy sauce. Pan-fried with just a little bit of oil-  AWESOME!  Entire family loved these.

Make it even easier. I use a bag of premade cole slaw mix from my grocer's fridge. Just don't put in the dressing! Saves so much time and tastes just as good.

As is?  Too meaty and too bland.  After realizing this, I added bean sprouts, a teensy tiny hit of sesame oil and some plum sauce.  Money.  Used fresh ginger and some broccoli slaw and regular cole slaw instead of just cabbage and carrots and chose to cook that with the pork.

I enjoyed this recipe but next time I will cook the cabbage a little because the raw cabbage wanted to poke holes in the wraps.  I did add more seasonings and soy sauce as suggested by other reviewers  they were delicious.

We loved these egg rolls, I made them with pork sausage, so skipped any seasoning and found they were very flavorful and very simple.  Will definitely use this as my go to egg roll recipe!

AMAZING! Time consuming, but worth it. I tripled the recipe. I got 20 eggrolls (which is exactly the amount of wrappers in the package). I also used a bag of shredded cabbage with carrots, plus 2 extra shredded carrots. Doubled the garlic, used fresh ginger and ground ginger. Excellent! Will definitely be making these again.

I'm giving these babies 5 stars because they are a perfect and an easy staple recipe. I did add a lot more ginger and garlic powder; organic tamari sauce(like soy sauce) some salt, pepper, and onion powder. Nice thing is you can season to taste because you fully cooked the meat. Brilliant! I am going to freeze some wrapped up ready to fry. Try it with my sweet and sour recipe. Jelly and salsa!

These rolls are real easy, but I did some things to help them out some.  I minced green onions, doubled the ginger and tripled garlic, threw in some dried onion flakes, red pepper flakes, and added about an eighth cup of "Panda Express" brand kung pao sauce, I mixed it real good into the meat before I cooked it.  It turned out phenomenally.

Good egg roll recipe.  I did add more seasoning as suggested by other reviewers, such as 2x the ginger and garlic to the meat, and a couple tbsp of soy sauce to the cabbage.  I used the shredded cole slaw mix, worked wonderfully!  I thought the filling tasted great by itself.  After frying them in a pan of shallow oil, the filling didn't taste as great, I guess it could have used more seasoning.  But otherwise a great recipe to build on!

This is my first time making egg rolls! They were delish! I follow the reviews of others and added spice to the meat. The ground pork really has no flavor so heres what I did to make it 10 stars! I mixed 1 tbsp of soy sauce to cabbage mixer. Now to the meat -1 tsb lemon pepper, 1 tbsp of fresh lemon juice, 2 clove of garlic, 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp papika, 1 tsp pappys,  1/2 cup onion.Dipped with Franks red hot sweet chili sauce yum! My family loved them. Next time I'll add more cabbage and carrots. Thanks for sharing, And God bless!

Just made these with a group of older 4-H members(age 14 and up) with great success.  I could put a bit more seasoning in them but we had some more cabbage than it called for-maybe 3 cups.  They were a little cautious when filling them so we ended up with 14 egg rolls.  Definitely could have had 10-12 with plenty of filling.  Will make these again for family and friends.

First time making egg rolls. These were very good, however... followed others suggestions and used coleslaw mix, sweated it before adding. Thought the meat:veggie ratio was too high, needs more cabbage. After frying, rolls were a bit too oily for me. Will try to drain oil better. Overall, good first attempt, but will try to make them better next time.

can i just say...yum! this was the 1st time I ever made egg rolls and i was impressed! my husband loved them too! i did do a few things differently though. I didn't have ginger so i added onion powder instead. it made the filling very flavorful! and i also steam/fried the filling before putting into the egg rolls! they turned out delicious.

Loved this recipe.  I doubled the garlic powder, sauteed the carrot and cabbage just a bit before mixing with the pork.  I added salt, pepper, and used canola oil instead of peanut.  This is a great base recipe because you can tweak the filling to taste exactly how you want before rolling them up.

EASY!  And very tasty!  This was the first time I have ever made home-made egg rolls.  What a treat!  I added fresh garlic to the meat instead of the garlic powder, and used canola oil instead of peanut oil.  Also, I added a bit of black pepper to the mix before filling the wrappers.  I got 16 egg rolls out of this recipe using 1/3 cup filling per egg roll.  Even my 9 and 5 year old kids asked for seconds!!  A definite keeper recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing.  :)

My husband loves to eat egg rolls as a quick snack. I usually buy them, but decided to try my hand at making them...so glad I did! My husband raved at how good they were:) I used a coleslaw mix plus onion, added 1 t sesame oil, lower sodium soy sauce, extra garlic & ginger. For the flour mixture, I used white whole wheat flour. I made half the rolls with turkey & half with shrimp; didn't use near as much meat as the recipe called for. I fried the rolls in a mixture of olive & canola oils(don't care for peanut oil). Served with a sweet chile dipping sauce. These were so good...even my picky kids loved them. They are a great side to a chinese dinner, or a quick snack. I went ahead and made another batch to stick in the freezer. Will certainly make again..thanks for sharing!

A great base for homemade egg rolls!  I followed the recipe but also added soy sauce (to taste) as well as a bit of Hoisin Sauce.  I fried 1/2 of them & baked the other 1/2.  Yum!

These are wonderful!!! Finally an egg roll recipe that doesn't use oyster sauce. I use veggie sausage and a cole slaw mix but otherwise followed the recipe. Even my kids loved them!

After reading many reviews calling these plain, I upped the seasoning quite a bit.  I cooked the pork and then wilted some coleslaw mix with the drained pork and seasonings for a couple of minutes.  I wouldn't suggest adding liquid to the mix because it can make the wrappers turn to mush.  Also, only wrap a few at a time or the wrappers get soft and soggy.  These are so tasty and it's a lot of fun rolling them up.  Thanks for the recipe, Angela!

These are great!  They reheat in the oven really well!  The only thing, I would saute the filling to avoid some air pockets.

These were incredibly easy to make. My husband has been asking me when I'll be making them again. My kids loved them too. I used canned chicken (it's what I had on hand) and just seasoned it and mixed it all together and it turned out great! Thank you... this one's a keeper!!

I made these last night and they were very good.  I know some people get upset when people leave comments on a modified recipe but I love reading people's modifications.  I followed another reviewer and used a hot and spicy pork sausage and it definitely added a kick.  I cooked the sausage and drained it and then threw in the carrots, cabbage and ginger (because I didn't want the ginger flavor to be lost when I drained the fat off of the sausage).  I also added a few dashes of soy sauce and cooked this mixture about 2 minutes so the cabbage wouldn't be super crunchy.  I shredded the cabbage and carrots on my cheese grater and it made short work off it.  The rolling up the egg rolls was much easily that I thought.  If fact the whole recipe was easy and not very time consuming.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I had never made egg rolls before, but will now.  They were delicious and inexpensive to make.  I made mine without the pork and precooked the cabbage/carrot mixture, but think it would be great with the meat as well.  We have Meatless Monday at our house, so I had to modify since I made these on Monday.

YUM!!! It's great to know I don't have to go all the way to the restaurant just to get one of my favorite foods. These egg rolls were delicous. I followed this recipe as the base. I used a little finely chopped chicken breast instead of pork. There was more cabbage/veggies than meat. I took the suggestion of others here and used Chinese Five Spice. Thanks for sharing this!

Used a bag of coleslaw mix and added extra carrots. I also added a little bit of soy sauce for some extra flavor. This was enough to fill the entire package of egg roll wrappers so I froze the rest of them.  I tried them both fried and baked, I will only do fried from now on! Must have sweet and sour sauce to go with it!

A bit bland for our tastes, plus, I feel like the cabbage mixture should be stir fried just a bit for the best results.

Yum, great egg rolls!  I cut the pork in half and left everything else the same since we like more veggies than meat in our egg rolls.  Served with some wonton soup and it was great!!

So good and so easy. My grocery store didn't have cole slaw mix but shredding and carrots and cabbage, which I more chopped was a breeze. I sauteed the veggies a little before putting in the egg roll wrapper. I never used egg roll wrappers before, some one them I double on accident, didn't realize how think they were so they were not as cruchy but that the cookes error! Still great!

These were fantastic!  I used a pre-bagged shredded cabbage & carrot mixture, mild pork sausage and canola oil for frying.  I served them with the "Sweet & Sour Sauce II" and my husband and I couldn't stop eating them!

I did stir fry the carrots and cabbage for a few minutes just to soften them a bit, I added some soy and oyster sauce then mixed in the cooked pork before assembling the rolls.  We dipped these in some sweet chili sauce which was perfect. Served with Szechwan shrimp and fried rice.

These were really good. I used left over pork roast from the Roasted Pork Loin recipe from this site. I diced it very fine, subbed fresh ginger (3 Tbsp) and fresh garlic (2 tsp) for the powders, and just sauteed briefly to meld the flavors. I added coleslaw mix for the cabbage/carrots, a splash of sesame oil and a splash of soy sauce. I let the cabbage soften just a bit and took it off the heat. Wrapped as recommended (first time doing it...not hard at all) and fried in a skillet with vegetable oil. The family LOVE these. I think the fresh ginger and garlic made a HUGE difference on these. Very bright flavor for sure. I served them with Sweet and Sour Sauce 2 from this site. I received the best compliment possible a cook can get in this house, "Please make this again, Mom....sooon!" Leftovers going in to the lunch boxes tomorrow!!!  Thanks for a really good recipe! (4 stars for the change in spices)

This was the first food I've fried (besides our rare chicken fried steak) in literally five years, and they were very good.  My husband really enjoyed 'em, but I'm not a huge fan of egg rolls.  I did eat a whole one, and that's saying a lot.  They were super easy to make, but they're not as good as my mom's so that's why I gave it 4 stars.  I used fresh grated ginger, a bit more garlic than called for,salt & pepper, and a drizzle of sesame oil in the ground pork.  Served with Fried Rice Restaurant Style, and Sweet, Sticky, and Spicy Chicken from the site.  My son told me we need to have this more often! =)

Wow!  I have never even attempted egg rolls before and these looked impressive and tasted awsome!  I did read all the reviews and decided to use the Chinese 5 spice, I also decided to "kick it up" and I used a few shakes of Emeril's essence and I also used fresh garlic and garlic pwdr.  I skipped the ginger since it's in the Chinese 5 spice.  I bought the cabbage/carrot mix, wilted that a little with water and soy sauce as suggested.  I doubled this recipe and got 40 egg rolls.  My 15 yr old daughter and 12 year old son say it's better than the Chinese restaurant so I guess we'll definitely be doing this again!

My husbend and I love chinse food but living in a small town its hard to find good chinse food.  I found these and made them and they were an instint hit!  We make them all the time.  I double the batch and freeze some to have on hand.  When reheating them I recommend doing it in the oven, this way they get nice and crisp all over again!

Great easy egg roll recipe.  This was my first time making egg rolls.  My husband loved egg rolls he used to get at a resturant that is now out of business.  He thought that these were better than those ones.  High praise, trust me, he talks about those EVERY time he eats Asian food.  Simple and easy, I used chicken instead of pork.  Tasted wonderful.

Tasted great and was super yummy! I took the advice of reviewers before me and purchased coleslaw mix and sauteed it in a soy sauce/water mix.  Instead of frying I sprayed them with cooking spray and baked in the oven. Gave them the crunchy outside without the grease.  Will definately make again!

These were so good and they were easy too.  I have put off making egg rolls for years b/c I thought they would be hard to make.  I cooked the pork and then when that was finished, I threw in the cabbage and carrots - they kind-of steamed in the heat of the pork.  I didn't want them to overcook.  Then I stuffed the wrappers and fried.  Be sure not to have the grease too hot.  I had to use regular bottled ginger b/c I didn't have powdered ginger - it turned out fine.  Thanks!

Found them to be alittle bland as well I'll tinker alittle more with different seasoning.Added soy sauce like other readers did. Like Curtislee did I put the cabbage/carrot bagged mix with the pork so it would wilt alittle. Added bean sprouts just love them. Will make again nice and easy to wrap :)

The filling doesn't have enough flavor. Definitely needs the addition of salt. Also missing something crucial to making it taste authentic, but not sure what it's missing. This just isn't it.

I followed other reviewer's suggestions and added more seasoning to these. I added onion, celery salt, 2 fresh garlic cloves, and soy sauce. I can't say that I loved these, I wish I could. I did have a slight problem with the first 3 that I fried, apparently I did not roll them and seal them well because they completely fell apart and made a huge mess in the oil, oops! That was my fault. The next batch turned out perfectly, but I just was not crazy about the finished product. I have had homemade egg rolls before and I guess I was expecting a much different flavor, I guess. I did not hate them, just didn't love them. They were okay.

Good basic recipe, I changed a few things. I minced my pork and cooked it in some sesame oil, added my cabbage/carrot (I used a pkg of cole slaw mix).  I also added about 1 cup of bean sprouts that I chopped a bit.  I  sprinkled a few tablespoons of soy sauce in my cabbage mix and then grated a little fresh ginger root, seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, a dash of cayenne and sesame seeds.  I think it helps keeping them from getting soggy if you precook your veggies and drain in a colander for 15 minutes.  If you don't want a sweet dipping sauce, try adding a few T soy sauce to about 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar.  :)

This was a great and different change that the kids as well as hubby loved.  They had a great flavor and were not too complicated.  Served with Husion sauce, hot mustard, and Soy sauce.

It is definetly a good start.  It needs more flavor though.  I will try the soy sauce next time and more spices.  And I think I might cook the cabage and the carots with the meat at the very end to tenderize it.  But they were good.  :-)

This recipe is a good start, but I agree with the other reviews that the meat mixture was way too bland. After adding soy sauce to the meat, and doubling the other seasonings, it tasted much better. And the flour mixture was completely unnecessary- we just sealed the wrappers with water. Worked perfectly.

Yum!  I didn't find the flour paste a necessity--water on the seam held fine.  My guests (and I) loved these.  They warmed up nicely for leftovers too.  Thanks for sharin.

Absolutely loved them.  I can't stop eating the darn things.  I added more ginger and garlic, plus 1.5 tbl of soy sauce.  They were easy to make, although I did it the long way...shredded everything myself.  DELISH!

These are ok. I used fresh ginger and garlic then added about 3 tablespoons of soy sauce and a pinch of chinese five spice. The taste was still a little bland and I did not like the texture (the filling was falling out). If I make these again I will mix everything together in a bowl and roll them up while the meat is still raw, then fry them. I think this will help the texture problem. Salt might help also.

I know that a lot of people have liked this recipe which lends me to believe that perhaps I did something wrong (although I did stick to the recipe). But my Fiance and I found these egg rolls to be bland, mushy and all around not to our taste.

These where so easy to make. I used cole slaw mix and left over pork chops. Make sure when you take them out of the oil you drain them vertically for a few seconds, my egg rolls had lots of hot oil inside of them. I guess I need to roll them tighter, or put the paste mix on the ends too. Still very good.

These were very good. Very easy, went together fast, and took only a handfull of ingredients. Great for really picky eaters (like me)! This made 13 good sized egg rolls. A big hit here, so thanks Angela for posting this!

OK - We're New Yorkers who love Mott Street Chinese food and VERY hard to please.  These actually came out BETTER than any we've had anywhere.  I have to admit we deviated from the recipie but was it  SO worth it!  We used pork loin leftovers from another all recipes recipe: Roasted Pork Loin (has garlic, rosemary white wine). We course ground the pork in the food processor with fresh garlic (even though there was gobs of garlic in the original recipe) and fresh ginger.  I reheated the ground pork added cole slaw mixture and added sesame oil as well as about a tablespoon of oyster sauce (another recipe had this) and a few splashes of soy sauce. We used NASOYA egg roll wrapers and a mixture of olive/peanut/vegtable (what was in the fry daddy)

I think using fresh grated ginger instead of powered would really freshen these up.  I also use 1/4 cup soy sauce and l tsp sesame oil to the mixture before rolling.  Always great.

Loved this recipe!  It's so easy. I just think of the egg roll skin as an envelope with one point facing me. I filled the middle,(left to right) folded in the corners,rolled and sealed the point(with flour paste) then deep fried for 12-20 seconds a side! The filling is already cooked! (I added an extra clove of minced garlic to the filling, but that's just for my taste)
You can't go wrong with this recipe! When the egg roll skin is a golden brown all around, it's done! I loved them and would do them again, anytime! You can find egg roll skins in the ethnic/asian isle of any supermarket, as well as 5 spice powder,ginger, etc! Enjoy!

These are good, a bit bland for my taste, but once I tweek the spices, I think I'll be all set. I'd love to try this w/ shredded pork loin. This is also one of those recipes that would be good for "Couples" or "Parent/Child" cooking as it goes much faster/smoother w/ 2 ppl (one to roll and one to fry). Thanks :-)

Great recipe! I did tweak it a little bit. I added pure sesame oil and hot chili sesame oil to the pork with a little soy sauce. Next time I will not make this ahead of time, for you can't stack them on top of eachother. I also might try to cook the veggies a little bit next time. I will definitely make these again. Everyone thought I bought these from somewhere. Thank You!

I have made these twice.  Really you can play with the ingredients as to the way you like them.  I shreaded approximately 3c. of cabbage and two good size carrots.  I fry the 1lb. of sausage but I use fresh minced garlic instead of the garlic powder the second time.  I also added the chinese five spice approximately 1/4 tsp. too.  I added to cans of shrimp also  I think they are 5 oz cans.  I drained most of the liquid out of them.  I ommitted the flour to seal the rolls.  Water worked just well.  I made the mistake of making them ahead and piling them on top of one another on a plate.  When I went to fry them they had severely stuck together.  Clearly the chef's mistake (lol).  Next time I will keep them on a cookie sheet seperated from one another so they do not stick.  But really a great recipe.  Kids and husband want them again.  Thanks so much!!!

My boyfriend and I made these egg rolls over the weekend and they were great!  We added shrimp, bean sprouts, chives and extra seasonings (black pepper, MSG, and fresh garlic) for extra flavor. We used egg roll wrappers AND spring roll wrappers and found that we really liked the spring roll wrappers best because they were thinner and crispier.  Our batch turned out 30 egg rolls.  We will definitely make these again.

These came out excellent. The idea of making egg rolls was a little daunting, but they came out great. They make your house smell like fried food though. Next time I am going to try to go them outside somehow.

Very easy recipe that whipped up fairly quickly.  I did add 1/2 cup of finely minced onion and 1/2 teaspoon of Chinese 5-spice powder.  I made up the Oriental Dipping Sauce recipe on this website to serve with the egg rolls.

These were so good and easy.  I used ground turkey, a bag of the shredded coleslaw mix and wonton wrappers, served it with white rice and we were all very happy.

Great base receipe!  I used  left over turkey breast instead of pork and mixed some poultry seasoning, salt,pepper, and a few dashes of low sodium soy sauce. Also light Hellmanns mayo to hold it together.  But not much.  It was AWSOME!!!

My family did not like the ground pork it just didn't have the flavor and texture I was looking for in an egg roll.  I do think I will try this one again however, but maybe use another type of meat. I may use the Sesame Beef recipe to make a stir fry beef to use in the egg roll. It really needed more flavor for me.  I am glad I tried this one because the options are endless based on your taste.

Good. I diced leftover chicken and sauted all of the "stuffing" ingrediants in butter and soy sauce. They turned out very good. Still room for some tweaking though.

Used italian sausage that I minced in the food processor, bagged shredded cabbage/carrots, garlic powder, soy sauce, dash of sesame oil. Was successful in REALLY stuffing the eggroll wrappers and not tearing them too bad (not an easy feat with my high maintanance acrylic lifesyle) and Guido did the dirty deep frying deed...  These had a strange reaction to 350* oil, they spun and created air pockets. I think next time I will cook ALL of the filling together and let it cool, then roll. It might be that the cabbage shrunk too much as it cooked. Also, they were a bit greasy. I guess we goofed by leaving the produce raw.  Will try it again someday. Guido says 'fageddaboudit'...

I prefer this made with smaller wrappers like a spring roll, but I think the filling is great. Unlike those who say it's too bland, I think it's just right. I've never had an egg roll that was spicy, typically they are mild and you dip them in a sauce for additional flavor. Be sure and shred the vegetables very fine.

THE best I've ever done. Very easy. I did throw in my cabbage & carrots while the pork was cooking though, being from the south we like our veggies cooked. Now I make sure I have what I need on hand so I can make them anytime!

makes 20 rolls, so invite guests!  Also, dont overcook.  Will make these again soon!

These were great! Next time, I think I’ll double the cabbage because I like a lot of cabbage in my egg rolls and less meat. The entire family enjoyed these though and that’s saying something with two picky kids! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I just made this recipe and followed others suggestions to add more garlic and ginger. I also added some salt as the recipe itself seemed a little bland. It was absolutely tasteless. The best part about these “egg rolls” is the fried skin. Never making these again

I would definitely make again!  I made a couple changes, but nothing drastic: I used leftover chicken cut into bite sized pieces. I sauteed mushrooms and onions and added the cabbage with soy sauce and cooked together, before adding the chicken and other spices and cook it all.
I also followed what another review suggested, and brushed them with oil and baked them at 425 for about 20-25 min (I can't remember!). I turned them after a about 13 min, but I don't think that's necessary.

These are great! Doubled the recipe and used packaged coleslaw mix which already included the carrots plus a package of bean sprouts. Then I added some hoisin sauce and chili garlic sauce for extra flavor. Delish!

Air frying worked well!  Put a single layer of 6 egg rolls at a time, turned them after 5 min at 390F then cooked another 3-4 minutes.  I also sprayed the egg rolls with cooking spray before air frying.  You can taste the difference of not frying in oil but it's worth it.  Less calories and less mess to clean up!

This is very close to a recipe I had many years ago.  I add two more ingredience.  First I added rice noodles.  I boiled them for a several minutes then drained.  I ran a knife through them to cut them up.  The second ingredience is Sesame Seed Oil.  I added till I got the taste we like.  I never did get any of them to the freezer because my husband kept eating them and taking them to work for lunch.  Also, adding the rice noodles helped make more egg rolls.

Lessons learned. I did not roll them tight enough, but served with Thai Sweet Chili Sauce and they were yummy. Used leftover pork roast diced pretty small and coleslaw mix. Will increase the spices next time to double. Mine made 13 rolls, so leftovers again. Very good!

I followed the recipe, but I did double the ginger and garlic powder + adding in minced garlic. The flavor was not hitting right for me and the egg rolls felt empty on the inside because the cabbage shrunk so much.  I will do what another reviewer suggested and cook the cabbage first next time. I will also be looking into a different arrangement of spices or just working out a better one myself. I am rating this three stars because I did watch the video multiple times for help with rolling.

Bland, boring. Needs a lot more flavor. I give it 2 because it is a decent base to add onto. I'm still tweaking my flavoring a bit.

I already made twice it was quick & easy & tasted fantastic. 
My mother also asked me for recipe 
I did add a couple of drops of sesame seed oil in veggie mixture.    Next time I might add some shrimp into existing mixture   I used good egg roll wrappers 
Dipping sauce was sweet chili sauce with a little soy

Super awesome base recipe! And I didn't think it was hard or particularly time-consuming (though it's not a 10-min dish). I did make a bunch of changes, of course. I’d say 1/3 head finely chopped cabbage, 1 shredded carrot, 4oz finely sliced tofu, 1 minced green onion, 1tsp grated ginger, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp sesame oil, 1 tsp sesame seeds (mixed into the veg), and I think I also put some minced jalapeno and turnip in there. Make sure you seal the egg rolls with cornstarch/water. For much, much lower fat content, pan fry in batches in 1tbsp oil on 4 sides til brown. I also made a dipping sauce: 1tbsp each gochujang, honey, ketchup, and 1tsp soy sauce (which is actually a nice general purpose sweet/spicy sauce!). DEFINITELY making this again.

I use about 3/4 bag of cole slaw instead of chopping. I used vegetable oil instead because I didn't have peanut oil. I've made these 4 or 5 times and they are so good! Rolling is tricky and they fry really quickly so don't leave them too long.

I used 2 bags of coleslaw mix  and also used a yellow onion and a bunch of green onions. My family likes onion. I used left over pork, chicken and some shrimp  I also added 1 Tablespoon of peanut butter mixed with a little vegetable oil. I also upped the ginger and added 5 Spice. I accidentally bought won ton wrappers so when frying the egg rolls I cut the won tons in strips and fried them too. The family loved them! Excellent! I’ve been told I will make them again! I froze a few that were left over. I’m sure they will be just as delicious as when first made.

This is great base recipe. For those looking for more flavor, a couple of Tbsp of oyster sauce and a couple of Tbsp. of soy sauce really perks the flavor up.

I was expecting it to take a long time to put together, but took no time at all. Will be great for a week night dinner. We loved them. While eating my husband and I started talking about different things we could do with the recipe. Won't go into it now, but if we follow through I'll let you know.

I added salt, fresh ginger and hoisin sauce to the pork, otherwise they would have been very bland. I believe peanut oil to fry them in is the secret! Very good!!

easy to make.under whelmed by seasoning. added to it.... I like strong flavors. I did add some terraki sauce to it to make it different, no pork sub. ground , chicken, used fresh ginger 1tsp= 1tblsp fresh. Daughter said these were terrible. we should not eat them but she said not to throw them away she'd take one for the team. I think I liked chef John's egg rolls better.

loved this!!!! everyone loved it. After I cooked the ground pork with the ginger and garlic I put the carrots and the cabbage, garlic powder, onion powder and put a few teaspoon of osyter sauce and cooked it for a few minutes. I let the filling cool and wrapped it in the egg roll wrapper. cooled the the egg rolls and then fried them in vegetable oil. yum!

I followed the recipe but they turned out bland and a little oily. The egg rolls looked good but otherwise were edible. I was able to salvage the filling by scraping it out and making mock moo shu.

The first time I made these I followed recipe except I used minced rehydrated garlic and ground chicken.   FABULOUS!  Everyone loved them.  

I am now on my second batch of egg rolls.   My kitchen smells deliciously of onions, garlic and ginger!  The garlic is from a fresh garlic bulb; the ginger (again) is from Lighthouse Herbs (reconstituted) ginger.  This ginger saves a lot of time in prep and works equally well.    Again using (as suggested by previous readers) a coleslaw mix to which I added more shredded carrots.  Used  a pizza cutter to shred the coleslaw and carrots finer.  Worked great.   When mincing the garlic I put Pam Cooking Spray on the blade of the chopping knife.  What a great idea!  (Don't remember where I read this)   Keeps the garlic from sticking.  This time I will be using a small electric fryer.  The first batch of egg rolls I fried in a regular sauce pan and what a mess!    Will see how the fryer works.

Best egg rolls ever!  I loved them. 
On the advice of others I added Hoisin sauce, red pepper flakes and some green onions. A few reviews said it needed more flavor.

I'm giving this a 4 for being a good start.  I worked in a Chinese restaurant all through high school and spent a lot of time rolling egg rolls and wantons.  I do love egg rolls with bbq Chinese pork, but used minced chicken this time.  I marinated it in pineapple juice, teriyaki  sauce , with fresh minced garlic and fresh minced ginger for a couple of hours before cooking it.  I also lightly stir fried the veges till softened (cabbage, carrots, bean sprouts, green onion, minced mushrooms & bamboo shoots) before putting it all together for the egg roll.  Water works just fine to seal your egg rolls, no flour paste needed.  These were a real hit with the family.  They freeze well too (reheat 400 for 10-12 minutes) I used Chinese hot mustard and Sweet Chili sauces (from this site) for dipping.  Yum!

They were very dry and bland; suggest adding a little stir fry sauce or soy sauce to moisten and season before rolling up egg roll.

These were horribly bland tripled the seasoning. Added soy sauce and green onions. The meat to vegetable ratio was way off. I would try these again and use only half the meat. I brushed them with peanut oil and put them in the air fryer. They came out super crispy. I served with the sesame ginger sauce from this sight

easy to put together but made one and then tasted it.. It was missing flavor. the ginger and garlic were not enough. I added another tsp of both ginger and garlic, chopped onions and 3 tbsp of low sodium soy sauce.  That did the trick. I also made mine in an air fryer, eliminating the need for deep frying.

Best egg rolls ever!!! I made these last night and my husband liked them so much he asked me to make them again tonight. Super easy to make. I doubled the amount of ginger and used fresh minced garlic. To make them healthier I baked themin the oven at 350 for 14 minutes instead of frying.

Recipe seemed just OK so I made it again with a couple of changes. The recipe fell short to me because of the use of dried, powdered ingredients. Why? I used fresh ginger and fresh garlic and added a little moisture to the filling with a little soy sauce. 100% better.

This recipe is a great starting point, but I agree with other reviewers that it needs more.  I added soy sauce, minced garlic, more garlic powder, fresh minced ginger, and green onions.  I just kept tasting as I went and tweaked it as needed.  I am trying to eat healthy, so I used ground turkey or chicken, and just ate the filling and didn't make the actual egg roll.  It was a great way for me to get a healthy Chinese food fix.

No.  I was in a hurry and thought this recipe looked faster than what I usually make and I should have known better.  It needs fresh ginger, fresh garlic, some soy sauce in the mixture, and the cabbage/pork ratio was way off.   Also, instead of cooking the meat and veggies prior to rolling, it should be rolled raw.  Use a couple of teaspoons of salt and salt the cabbage in a bowl for 20 minutes.  Using a clean dishtowel, squeeze the liquid out, then mix the cabbage with the carrots, pork, fresh ginger and garlic, and about a quarter cup of soy sauce.  Using lumpia wrappers is better, too, and make the egg rolls themselves a bit smaller (similar to spring rolls) and it'll cook more evenly.  Lesson learned, when making Asian foods, I'll stick with the recipes passed down in my family by actual Asians, even if it means more work, lol.

Will definitely be making this again. So scrumptious. Added more soy sauce to meat also oyster sauce. I cooked the cabbage a little bit with some more soy and oyster sauces. You will not be disappointed if you try this one. Thanks for posting it.

Only used about a 1/4 of pork and 1 16oz slaw bag. Mixed 1 tsp each of salt sugar, and sesame oil to 1/4 c of soy sauce and added to meat. After mixing meat to slaw, drizzled a little more sesame oil and  another mixture of the sauce to the whole thing. Fried in vegetable oil . Made about 10. These were delicious!

I'm giving it a high rating because I loved the filling... but you really need to use the right ingredients. 
It was my first time and I didn't know what I was doing, make sure you either know what your doing or at least look at a video first.
I used rice paper for my wrapper thinking that was the same thing as egg roll wrapper, I am certain now that it was not.  It didn't look like any of the pictures, and the egg rolls were so oily but the flavour was still good.  
Caution needs to be added, I did get splattered on the face, surprisingly it didn't hurt like a burn usually does, but it scabbed and if it had been any lower, I'm sure I would have lost an eye to it.

Pretty good recipe but felt like it could use celery and maybe some onions to make it pop.  I liked the seasonings though although I think I would like beef better.

I ended up using 1 small head of cabbage, 2 large carrots and the pound of pork.  They turned out very good!

Like others, I doubled the ginger and garlic. I also mixed in 2T of water and 2T of low-sodium Soy Sauce to the cabbage mixture (pre-made coleslaw mix) and they were fantastic!! Will be making again!

YUM!!! This was awesome! I did read some reviews and add a tsp of ginger and garlic powder to the pork as it was cooking, along with a dash of sesame oil and soy sauce. I also sprinkled some salt on them as they were cooling off. Better than a lot of restaurants egg rolls I've had.

Recipe is very simple and easy to follow. The filling was extremely bland so I added soy sauce, fresh lime juice, agave syrup, more ginger, and red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit. I used shredded red cabbage and matchstick carrots from Cub and they added a nice crunch and fresh element to the egg rolls. I also made my own dipping sauce (I use Hoisin, sesame oil, soy sauce, mirin, agave, rice vinegar) and I think that the egg rolls were BETTER with my homemade sauce.

Used fresh garlic and ginger and supplemented with powders. Also soy sauce in place of salt when seasoning the meat and veg. Added bean sprouts and scallion to veggies and a dash of oyster sauce....

So after making the egg eggroll mixture with double the garlic & ginger i also added 10 cocktail shrimp cut up 2scallions and 3 celery stalks then i thought it way to much meat to amount of cabbage so i added 2more cups of cabbage and it still seemed like too much meat so i added the rest of the head of cabbage some salt ,pepper a little sugar a teaspoon if hoison and 2Tlbs soysauce and they were tasty i love eggrolls and i think the extra cabbage and celery make a hugh difference

Apparently I am not a big fan of ginger. I doubled the garlic powder. I, also, wish the person who suggested adding soy sauce to the cooking pork had said how much to add. Overall, these egg rolls are pretty bland (other than the obvious ginger flavor). They aren't bad if you smother them in sweet and sour saucezzz

These are really good.  The only thing I will change next time is my husband said the pork needed more seasoning added...so I will add the basics first, (salt and pepper) and then go from there....WILL make again!

Very good recipe for egg rolls that's easily changed to your taste. I use pork sausage, and it really adds to the flavor. I add a couple tablespoons of soy sauce when I add the cabbage mixture. Also, I have never had to use flour to keep the egg rolls together, just a dab of water on the wrapper.

Made these for the first time tonight and they were great! I used ground chicken instead of pork. I also took suggestions and used Cole slaw. I also used a tad more ginger and put garlic powder instead of chopped garlic. I seasoned my ground chicken well with a little seasoning salt also and mixed in some soy sauce. Fried them up and dipped them in sweet and sour sauce and yummy! Will indeed make these again.

These are so good. I altered these a bit tho. I had a package of 15 wrappers so I used 2pds. ground pork. I salted and peppered it and sauteed this until pink was gone. I was out of fresh ginger so I used 4 pieces of crystallized ginger and 4 cloves of garlic. I added the garlic and ginger to the pork when it was almost finished cooking. Then I added 2 tbsp soy sauce and 2 tbsp Chinese cooking wine. 5 min before assembling the rolls I added the cabbage and carrot mixture to the pork. I cooked it on high for 2 to 5 min just to warm it up and get the flavors combined. I used a 1/4 cup per roll and instead of using a flour paste I used 1 egg and water as my glue. These turned out crispy and delicious. My kids and husband loved them.

Delicious, I used Snowflakes review/comments. - Specifically his edit on 12/10. We always use left over shrimp or pork from other dishes we have made. Next time I will try using a bag of slaw mix as suggested.

Delicious!!!!!  Didn't have pork so used very small pieces of chicken we seasoned and stir-fried in small amount of oil in a skillet.  Used Terriyaki instead of soy, simply because I LOVE the stuff!  Loved all the fresh cabbage and carrots.  Will definitely be making these again!

I wanted to spruce these up a bit. I added some diced shrimp and chopped Shiitake mushrooms. After cooking the meat I added the other ingredients with a dash of chicken stock (and just a dash) to steam the coleslaw/carrots and marry the flavors. I also added some Chinese 5-Spice. Once cooled I rolled and fried the egg rolls until crispy. The mushrooms and Chinese 5-Spice add wonderful flavor. Careful, though it can be over-powering if you add too much.

DELICIOUS. I made changes by adding salt to the mixture before putting it into the eggroll shells.   I thought it might be a little bland if the meat wasn't salted. Firs time making eggrolls and it was fun and delicious. EDITED: I just read the other comments and saw that others experienced blandness too... I'm glad I added the salt before I made em. I would've been SO MAD if it were bland afterward. Otherwise, good roll...

I would definitely recommend more seasoning and cooking the cabbage and carrots first. I might cook them with the pork in a roaster next time. If you do bake  them,  LIGHTLY brush oil on them, 425 for 15-20. I cooked mine at 350 and they didn't get crispy enough.

I used left over pork butt and chopped it fine. Also used the bagged of shredded cabbage and carrots.

This was my first attempt at homemade egg rolls, and my entire family enjoyed them including my six-year-old, who doesn't generally care for take-out egg rolls. I did skip measuring my cabbage and carrots and eyeballed how much I mixed with the meat, so the amount called for may have excessive had I used it all. 

Some reviews have suggested adding more garlic and ginger. The ginger in this was just right for me, but I often find it overwhelming when we eat out. I do love garlic though and could always add more! Perhaps it was the mild flavor which appealed to my kiddos.

The store was out of peanut oil, so I substituted grapeseed (for it's high smoking temp and mild flavor). The only thing wanting was my frying skills in maintaining oil temp. :) Thanks for a great recipe!

My daughter introduced me to this recipe, and I must say these egg rolls are wonderful!! I made a few changes as per her suggestion. This is what I added more ginger and garlic powder (have no fear because the veggies are bland so can use the seasoning). I also used ground turkey (personal preference), cooked the meat till done then added quite a bit of soy sauce and cooked it off till the liquid was absorbed by the meat. This step also helps flavor the veggies mix. Tossed the meat mixture into shredded veggies and mixed thoroughly. this step helps to soften the veggies. I used egg roll wrappers & did not need the flour paste mentioned in this recipe as dipping my finger in water and rubbing onto the edge of the wrapper seals it nicely. None of my egg rolls opened up while cooking using the water method. I wrapped my egg rolls as I cooked since you need to be sure the uncooked egg rolls do not touch each other or they will seal themselves together! I used regular vegetable oil and cooked till golden. These egg rolls are better than what I have previously enjoyed in our favorite chinese restaurant! I will definitely make again. I had a few wrappers leftover so I filled with a 1/2" strip of cream cheese and sealed all edges with the water and cooked. Yummmm Thank you for this recipe!!! Love it!!

I may be unfair giving only 3 stars, because I changed quite a bit. First of all I am mostly vegetarian, and after searching all over for a good vegetarian egg roll recipe, I decided to modify this one. I did not use pork at all. I bought a 16oz bag of coleslaw mix (cabbage and carrots) and shredded a bit more carrot into it since there wasn't much. I followed other reviewers' advice and used 2 tsp ginger and garlic powder instead of one. I mixed those two spices in with 2 T light soy sauce and 2 T water and sautéed it with the veggie mixture. I then added some pre-soaked rice noodles (because the most recent--and delicious--restaurant egg rolls I ate had that in them). I refrigerated the mix overnight to make the next day. I fried them using Smart Balance oil instead of peanut oil.

Results:  Too much ginger. I would stick with the original 1 tsp. or maybe 1 1/2. The soy sauce was definitely needed, because I can't see how they would have had much flavor otherwise. The water/flour mixture did not hold the corners in place. The wrappers I bought (Frieda's brand) are kinda thick and didn't fry the inner layers all the way through. The wrappers also did not fry flat and super crispy like egg rolls are supposed to be. Got lots of air bubbles and overall texture was more like a fried thin flour tortilla. Peanut oil might have helped? I'll keep tweaking to get it right! Overall it's very quick and easy! Hubby liked them ok with dipping sauce.

I made these tonight & my family devoured them.  I did double the ginger & garlic like other reviewers.  And I used half a pound of pork & half a pound of ground beef. This is definitely a keeper.

I defiantly agreed when I first made these they where bland in flavor, next time I made these I decided to add more ginger and it was over seasoned with ginger. It really needed something more than just the two season. But Ill take the advice of playing around to make them taste a little better. So I will try soysauce, lemon pepper or so.

I made this recipe using a coleslaw mix instead of cabbage and carrots.  We thought they were a little bland on their own, but were great with a dipping sauce.  I will try adding a little more ginger and garlic next time.

These were good. Try adding 1tbsp of oyster sauce to the mix.  It adds a unique taste. Also, instead of using the flour paste, use eggs whites.

These were fantastic! The first batch we deep fried and that's the best way to do them. We had put the others into bake.....not near as good. We will definitely be making these a lot!

Tried it several times. I used Napa and Savoy cabbage at different times. I've also used onions, scallions, celery, and carrots when I didnt have cabbage. Delicious either way! Its foolproof...and easy..have also made my own wrappers..easy to make.

This was good. Only thing I did different was I added soy sauce and oyster sauce to the pork and instead of water and sugar I put cabbage carrots white onions in a pan sautéed and lite soy sauce then added the cooked pork to that. Also added cheddar cheese to the mixture

Double the ginger and garlic, fine shredded the carrot and use bagged fine shredded cabbage.  Cooked the ground pork, and the spices to bloom the spices, the the cabbage and carrots, added about a quarter cup water and cooked down, about 5 minutes. Use about a 1/4 cup per small egg roll a wrapper, 5 inch.  Deep fat fried, 350 degrees, and my wife loved it.  Third try at this recipe and nailed it!

These are really good, the only thing that's off is the seasoning; the egg rolls were a little bland. But everything else was great! I multiplied this recipe to serve at Christmas and they were a hit! I'll make them again for sure but i'll make some tweaks to the seasoning.

I found the amount of pork asked for in this recipe to be too much.  It kind of overpowered the other flavors. I will try it again using less meat and more vegetables.

Loved this quick and easy recipe!  I followed others' suggestions and doubled the ginger and garlic and used cole saw mix, which I lightly sauteed in a bit of water and soy sauce.  One addition I did make to the pork was to add a tablespoon of oyster sauce.  Made them for some friends and they said they tasted just like what you'd get in a restaurant!

Easy and delicious!

Like most other reviewers, I added a bit more flavour. I used fresh minced garlic and grated ginger (2 Tbsp each), enough soy sauce to keep it a bit moist and ground beef (as I didn't have any pork on hand).

My husband says they're the most delicious egg rolls he's ever eaten. I will definitely be making these again as my go-to recipe for egg rolls.

Loved the egg rolls!  I have made them numerous times.  I make them with turkey sausage and salad shrimp. And,  I always add a tbs peanut butter mixed into the slaw with all the other spices.

This is the first time that I made egg rolls. I made a dozen of them and every one raved over them. To be honest I didn't use the ground pork this time so they were actually spring rolls. Next time I'll add the ground pork and I'm sure they will be just as good. Note: I used a thermometer to check the temp and 375 deg. was a little to high as the first batch got a little to much of a tan.

this recipe was easy and it worked well. The egg rolls came together quickly. Just don't overfill them. Using the flour and water to seal them worked perfectly.

I doubled the spices like it said to try in some of the reviews, but it was still a bland filling. It makes a lot of filling, and I only had won ton wraps instead of egg roll wraps- took way too long to make that way for a sub-par finish. Maybe I did something else wrong, but they weren't that great...

I followed the recipe without any changes. It was really good, but bland. I could only taste the ginger really, and the garlic was hidden. I'll be making this again, but with suggested changed from comments.

The recipe as written was bland, so we bunched it up a bit. First, we cooked the ground pork in a combo of garlic, salt, ginger, and chinese 5 spice. Then when the pork was almost cooked, we tossed in the cabbage and carrots, and stiry fried until the flavors were well intergraded and the cabbage translucent. Then we assembled the eggrolls sans the flour paste, using water on our fingertips instead to seal the eggrolls and they came out perfect. I wanted to add some salad shrimp to give it a little more flavor, but we'll save that for the next time. It's a good "starter" recipe to jump off from.

Since everyone in my family loves egg rolls, I decided to try my hand at making them at home, and I'm glad I did.  I made them according to the recipe the first time,from then on, I improvise with what I have on hand.  I never have peaunut oil, so I just use canola, even though peanut would be better, just too expensive. I also love to use fresh minced ginger and seasame oil.  Since chicken has been cheaper these days, I poach a breast and shred. There are so many variations you can try, once you know the technique on how to make them.  My family loves them with homemade egg drop soup.  I have also used any left -over stuffing to make fried rice.

Very easy to make. A trick for cooking this recipe in oil: put in 3 at a time to cook fast. I let the meat rest a night, and made it easy to do the dishes! I was planning to make the wrappers, but I didn't want a huge mess. This is a recipe that doesn't make more than 8 if you use a 1/4 of a cup for the carrots, lettuce/cabbage, and meat mixutre. Good for parties with knowing it came from you kitchen!

The name of this recipe fits it completely.  I made them for dinner tonight and they are the best that I have ever had!  I altered it slightly by adding finely chopped green onions and water chestnuts.

Wonderful recipe.. however, I never make egg rolls without adding some Chinese Five Spice blend.  For those who feel there's not enough flavour, try it.  I also use grated fresh ginger & garlic.  I've served these to Asian friends and even they have asked for my recipe!

these really were the best egg rolls and were so easy to make...I didn't add sesame seeds at the end and did add alfalfa sprouts to the cabbage mixture but they were still awesome!!! My family and co-workers are already requesting for me to make them again...

These are so easy to make and taste amazing. For a big group I just add in more cabbage and carrots to stretch it out. I also don't make the paste of flour and water, plain water works fine to seal the edges.

This was my first attempt at egg rolls.  Though I didn't follow the directions exactly, they were so simple and really delicious.  I used canola oil and I didn't use pork, but seasoned chicken with garlic powder, onion powder and soy sauce.  My family loved them.

I'm giving this recipe four stars because it was good for homemade but very time consuming and hard to make so if you love the chinesse restraunt food don't try to make because no matter how much you try they won't even get close to the real thing plus the wrappers are hard to handle if you made them homemade like i did but they use very little ingredient i will not make again

This recipe needed a little more jazz for us.  It was on the bland side but we had a flavorful dipping sauce which we thought saved it.

So yummy!  I accidentally put 2 cups of carrots in instead of 2 ounces.  It was still good though.  Very flavorful.  I will be making these again.

I would like this to have more spice. I had to add a bunch of salt to the mixture before I started wrapping - which is odd because I typically don't add extra salt to anything. I also added a bunch of fresh cracked black pepper - and that was wonderful. I think this recipe is a winner - but it needs a little tweaking for my taste.

Yummy!!!!  Everyone thought so as well, I hate that I made so much though however this was great.  I precooked my mixture and added extra garlic powder and soysauce.  I didnt make the flour paste however I have made Lumpia many times so I kinda just went with it.  I did double the cabbage, I think the best wrappers are the spring roll wrappers I get from the asian market (wow it stinks in there) we also made pancit with this.  Great combo!!!  Served with hot mustard, sweet sour and duck sauces

Really good recipe! I did what others said and steam the cabbage a little first and I basically double, maybe tripled the amount of veggies since we were having meat as the main course.

These are the best egg rolls, at least a good starter recipe. Way better than what you get at a restaurant. We make a really great dipping sauce from soy sauce, garlic, rice wine vinegar and green onions - delicious!

I have never made egg rolls before and I must say that this recipe was pretty easy! Based on other reviews I too tweaked this recipe using part of the beef egg roll recipe from this site. I used 16 oz bag of coleslaw. When heating this I used 1/4c water, 1T canola oil, 1 t sugar, 2T soy sauce, 2 T sherry, 1/2t Chinese 5 spice powder. Also used fresh garlic and ginger and a handful of finely chopped green onions! I only used 1/4 inch of canola oil for frying and found 30seconds a side was perfect! Family loved them. Will make again! Thanks!

Haven't made them yet, but like the review about using the Lumpia wrap  thinner crispier. I might give them a try. A friend of mind had made eggs and he used the rice noodles I really really like them in a egg roll

Very good, I added more garlic and ginger and also added soy sauce like many other reviewers. I also just used a pack of cabbage and carrots sold for cole slaw. This made up 20 egg rolls.

Very easy and very good.  A bit bland for our taste, but with some sauce - delish!  Made them with my kids and we all enjoyed the process and the finished product!

The instructions were great, a fantastic springboard recipe.  I used spicy ground pork and doubled the meat (I am surrounded by males in my family :)  Everyone thought they were fantastic!

Really basic starter recipe, filling needed tweaking to be flavorful. I added more garlic, some hosin and soy sauce and it was better. Reduced the amount of pork, it overpowered the veggies and no need to pre-cook.

i did like everyone else and doubled the ginger and garlic. I added some sweet and sour sauce and "rooster" sauce (hot asian sauce with a rooster on it) to the pork and cabbage mix.  It came out great; a little sweet, a little spicy!

Very good. I added a bit more seasoning to the roll, pepper, garlic, ginger, salt, & sesame oil. Made large batches and froze the extra. Reheat easily in the oven to crisp.

They were really easy to put together (they just look like they'd be complicated to make!) and they were delicious! I totally forgot to put in the garlic powder, so I can only imagine it'd make them even better. I used grapeseed oil and deep fried them, and they were done in a snap! We dipped them in duck sauce and dug right in!

I am not a fan of the egg roll but my husband is so I made these for him.  He said they were very good but too heavy on the pork.  He suggested cutting the pork in half and using more cabbage (cole slaw).  Pretty easy and also pretty fun to make!

Hm....not convinced this is the best egg roll recipe.  I added extra garlic powder, ginger, salt and pepper.  The filling still tasted bland.  Also added alittle green onion and soy sauce.  Worst of all the inside of the wrap was not cooked through.  I had to finish in the oven.  The only upside is the family enjoyed filling and rolling.  This recipe is an ok base but needs tweaking!

Although this recipe was a bit involved, the end product was great. The taste and texture was great. I even had too many cooked egg rolls to eat that night so I froze them and reheated them in the oven a couple weeks later and they were still just as good. They froze great.

SOOO E Z!!! Took the comments about spicing it up to heart. Used Breakfast sausage- I liked it, the wife said it was okay, couldn't really tell b/c we doubled the ginger and the garlic (used fresh). Added a few splashes of soy to the mixture along with some salt and pepper. Didn't realize that the wrappers were doubled up- first 3 or 4 out of the frying pan were pretty doughy until we figured it out. Now we're going back to the store for more wrappers. MMMMMMMMMM!!

These were really good and easy.  The outside consistency was perfect.  The inside was good, but I too, would try to tweak to give it more flavor.  A really good "jumping off" point for egg rolls.

This recipe is a good basic recipe. Like the other reviews I use coleslaw as the cabbage substitute. I also use spicy breakfast sausage for the ground pork.

The only thing that kept me from giving this recipe 5 stars was the ginger in the recipe.  I didn't like the way it made the filling taste, so next time I will omit it completely. Thanks for sharing.

These were good, but not like from my favorite restaurant.  I will try another recipe or modify this on a lot.

We've never made egg rolls before and these were easy & delicious!
I used colelaw mix and added shrimp to one batch.  We dipped in soy sauce and sweet & sour sauce.  Amazing such a simple recipe is so good!

This was the first time I've ever made eggrolls and I found this recipe extremely quick and easy.  They weren't at all bland as some users have mentioned.  I did find them a bit dry, however, I used a ground up leftover pot roast instead of ground pork.  I will definately make these again.  I do plan to play with different spices though.

I gave this recipie a 4 cuz i beleive that  it was ok bu thte filling was very bland. what i did to make it better tasting is i added prob. another tsp. of garlic and ginger. i also added about a tsp. and a half of soy sauce. Then i added season salt and "mrs. dash" table blend to taste.  Once i did that and made them.. They were AMAZING!!! would definitly make again!!!

I thought this was very bland. However, the directions were every easy. I wouldnt make this again unless I "doctored" it up somehow. Very disappointed.

very good taste and very simple to make. however, it isn't the most authentic recipe. i put more chili flakes, more ginger and garlic in mine and i put shrimp into the mix too. the filling tasted too similar to gyoza filling. not particularly vietnamese. i need another recipe for the filling, but again, not because the taste was lacking, just because i want something more vietnamese tasting. i say the recipe is a winner and for those who like spice, add yours to taste and it won't be bland like all the other reviwers are complaining it is.

These were pretty easy to make a little time consuming but quick once the prep work is out of the way.  I felt that the flavor was good but a bit bland.  Next time I will jazz these up a bit.  Seem to be missing something, not sure what.

These are so quick and easy to make, once you figure out how to roll them up. They taste wonderful! My boyfriend asks me to make these all the time.

I tried this recipe because I have a friend that doesn't like the sping rolls that I usually prepare. Needless to say this went over very well. Plenty of flavor. I was asked to make this one for the next chinese new year party that I give every year.

It seems like it takes forever to make your first one...after that time flies by.
