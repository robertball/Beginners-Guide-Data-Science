This was really good!  Healthy & hearty.  Changes I made: used rotisserie chicken and pulled it apart to save time, used real garlic when I sauteed the onions, and added a can of rotel tomatoes with chilis because I didn't have any bell peppers on hand, also added a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes with juice in the end because I felt the dish needed more of a tomoato-ey flavor.  Oh, and I added 1/2 tsp. of ground chipotle for an extra kick.  Served with tortilla chips, shredded Mexican cheese, sour cream and avocado.  Delish!!!!

Loved this recipe, very delicious! Great meal to cook up ahead of time. To help make a little more healthy, I cooked up my own tomatoes instead of using canned, didn't take much longer to do. I also added chili power to make it spicier.

I am always looking for  a different way to cook healthy, to keep from becoming bored.  I tried this recipe, but put my own spin on it. Instead of Crushed Red Pepper, I used canned Chipolte Peppers, (add to taste, not the whole can unless you like super hot). And I also added a cup of  Sun Dried Tomatoes in addition to the can tomatoes. Just because I like the flavor and use them whenever possible. I also used real garlic. I served it over rice and it was excellent!

This is a great recipe ! Made it last night and it was scrumptious. The only things I changed was adding a little seasoned salt and fresh ground black pepper. Used real garlic instead of powder. Instead of canned corn, I used fresh corn on the cobb (I always do) and cut the kernels off. Then I took the stripped cobb's, and put them into the chili while it was simmering for added flavor ! My wife and sons loved it !
 I love pleasing my wonderful wife and 
my three "sunshine's ever day". 
They're 10, 8, and 4 and AWESOME !

I loved this one! The only thing I would add is some fresh chopped cilantro and a dab of sour cream on top of each serving.  Lime zest would be good too to add on top.  I also made a sweet cornbread recipe I found on allrecipes to go along with this.    I will definitely make again!

Loved this! I am always for stretching meals because we have a family of 7, so I added an extra can of beans and an extra can can of tomatoes a little more seasoning and a little more chicken and used real garlic. So good!

Really liked this soup. The only change was to use a can of pinto beans instead of the great northern beans. Thats all I had. Will be making this again. Easy and quick recipe, thanks.

I made this on a Wednesday night for a group of friends. I didn't have all the seasonings available or enough diced tomatoes so I substituted with rotel tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce. They absolutely loved it and ate it over spaghetti. This is a great and fast last minute meal.

Thank you so much for this recipe. It was wonderful! Sooo satisfying. I used 2 cans black beans. Forgot to get the great Northern beans. I am a diabetic eating healthy, lots of beans. I am currently not taking any diabetic meds. Thank you again. Looking forward to trying it with the white beans next time.

This chili was great! It had nice flavor and texture. I left out the peppers and black beans because of what we had and used 1/2 cup of chicken broth. Easy, healthy, recipe!

I was trying to figure out something to prepare with two ingredients, chicken breastcutlets and black beans. I knew I wanted a hearty recipe for this cold weather we are having here in the Midwest. So I used the ingredients link above, and I found this. My son is scraping his bowl as I am typing this now, I would say it's a HIT! I doubled the recipe and omitted the Northern beans and used fresh garlic. Great recipe, thanks!

This chili didn't have enough flavor, which is surprising due to the varying spices called for in the recipe.  Won't make again.

Used this recipe as a guide. I found I needed to add more spice. Used 1 tsp smoked paprika and probably nearly a tsp of chipotle chile. Added a can of tomato sauce too

This is ok. In the video she kept saying that it has a lot of flavor but I thought it was very blah. I added more seasonings and it came out ok. I will not try this again. And lastly it needs salt!!

I used 1 can white navy beans, 1 can lentils, 1 can black beans and doubled everything else.  I added mushrooms, shredded zuchinni and 1 tb. of tomato paste for a richer thicker sauce.

Really good.  To kick up the spice added 1 can of rotel tomatoes with habanero peppers along with the diced tomatoes, and used yellow instead of green bell pepper to balance with sweetness.

We did make a few substitutions the first time we made it, due to ingredients we didn't have. This has become a common meal in our house, it's delicious.
We did try it following the exact recipe and found it didn't match up to the changes we had gotten used to, but I would definitely recommend it to everyone!

I'll be doing all the no salt and low sodium footnotes.  I can use my own potassium chloride salt and another seasoning.  This is for my heart failure.  You can cook with no or little salt and it's still delicious.  Wish restaurant cooks would cut down on salt.

Love, love, love this recipe!  I made it many times over the winter months and my family always enjoyed it.  It is easy to 'tweek' by using favored spices and it is still wonderful!  I have used Rotel tomatoes and more hot spices when cooking it primarily for my husband.  For myself, I add a little tomato sauce but no tomatoes and more beans as tomatoes do not agree with me.  It is great as is too!

I loved this... easy, healthy, and yummy.  I only give it 4 stars because it wasn't a favorite meal for all in my family.  Will probably make again though.

Very good and I added extra beans to it, just to make it go farther. My husband loved it too and it got him eating a little healthier.

This was so healthy and crunchy. Going to try it for a chili cookoff at work.  Nice to have something that does not weigh you down or make you feel sleepy after lunch.  I used ground chicken I needed to use it up, instead of the chunks of chicken.
