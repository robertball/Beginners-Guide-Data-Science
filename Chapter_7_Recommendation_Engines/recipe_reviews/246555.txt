Awesome! Use this in any recipe that calls for saut√©ing a bit of onion and/or garlic. It adds a new dimension to any dish. I froze most of it in silicone mini muffin moulds. Once frozen, just pop them in a resealable bag to grab when you need them. Thank you for the recipe.

My mom used to make home made sofrito all the time and this tasted almost like hers. (I did not use cilantro because I did not have any and I was in a pinch) but other than that the flavor and the smell was really good.

I have not made this yet but had to add a rating in order to submit this review. 3 pounds of onions??? Is this correct?? I think it should be 3 onions and when I make it gonna add three or four romano tomatoes.

With 2/3 of a pepper, I scaled down much. It worked fine in All Recipes Habichuelas Guisadas.
