I love amareto fudge. Probably my favorite fudge ever!  This turned out just as good as anything I’ve bought at the higher end candy stores. Five stars!

It didn’t turnout grainy at all   It’s the best amaretto fudge that I’ve tried so far.

This fudge tasted so wonderful and had a perfect blend of chocolates and Amaretto.  However, I did have difficulty making the sugar dissolve.  Hoping the author of this recipe will share her trick for making that happen.  Regardless, I will still make the fudge again.  Everyone that tried it LOVED  it despite the graininess from the sugar.  Would definitely be a 5 star recipe if I could just figure out how to dissolve the sugar.

This didn't work at all. It was all grainy from the sugar in it!
