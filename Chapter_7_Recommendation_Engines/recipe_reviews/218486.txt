Simple and straightforward marinade for shish kabobs! I used olive oil vs. veg. along with low sodium soy sauce.  For the mustard, I used dijon left out the salt and cut the pepper in half. I reserved some of the marinade for the veggies and marinated the meat all day in a ziploc bag.  I skewered the veggies (adding some cherry tomatoes) and meat separate basing the veggies with the reserved marinade.  Overall, very tasty!

Worcestershire and soy sauce have a lot of salt to begin with, so when I saw adding more salt, I passed.  This was a good call.  In addition, unlike some marinades with soy sauce, this didn’t impart an oriental flavor, which I’m not fond of with steak; another plus.  The flavors came together well with none dominating  another and with that good old beef flavor coming through.  I’m a recent convert to marinades, preferring simply seasoned meats, but I’d make this again.

Great beef marinade, the lemon adds a nice twist and some nice flavor. I only had an hour to marinate, so I let them sit in fridge for 1/2 hour and on the counter for 1/2 hour. My kabobs turned out great!! Thanks for a great recipe, I’ll be using this marinade for plain steak too.

I made this for an outdoor dinner party for 8 people and doubled the recipe.  Used low sodium soy sauce and switched the vegetable oil for olive oil which was perfect! I also added more veggies such as yellow squash and zucchini and yellow, red, orange and green peppers. I served the kabobs with basmati rice, a Greek salad and a baguette of freshly baked french bread.   Not only was the recipe a beautiful colorful presentation, my guests loved it and actually asked for the extra sauce that was the marinade.  Definitely would make again!

Our first time making kabobs. 

We marinated the meat (but not the mushrooms) in a vacuum-seal bag for 2 hours and ditched the leftover marinade rather than saving for basting. Turned out great!

The only change I made was to leave out the mushrooms since my family doesn't like them. We marinated the meat a total of 8 hours and served over a bed of wild rice.  My eight year old had seconds and said this recipe is "a keeper!" We all loved it! Thanks for sharing this delicious summer BBQ treat.

I did everything I could to mess this up and they still tasted great. I only had 4 hours to marinate so I went with that. Then it started raining and I didn't grill. I ended up putting the veggies in a pan and cooking half way done. Then I threw in the meat and browned it. Poured the marinade over brought to a boil and did a quick stir fry. It was delicious and even my picky husband liked it. I served it with Classic Rice Pilaf on AR by Chef John. Perfect pair. I wouldn't change a thing.

There is a mistake that most people do, the shish kabob are no the one in the photo. Actually the shish is the thing that we use to grill meat (the wooden stick inthe picture). The kabobs, in arabic kabab, is ground meat with garlic and special spices for the kabab. Anyway the one in the picture is simply called grilled meat, and we usually grill with it onions. Bon appetit.

Made this last night - a huge hit!
I marinated the beef (used tenderloin) and mushrooms separately.
I too left out the extra salt and no one added salt at the dinner table.
I also used separate skewers for the meet and vegetables, so I could control the cooking a bit better - veggies cooked at medium and beef on high. The butcher mentioned that the tenderloin could get tough if overcooked - cooked it for about 10 minutes and it was perfect - medium rare.
Used the marinade from the mushrooms for basting on the grill.

It was ok but I'm sure my (not so great) cooking had a lot to do with it.  My meat manager suggested using a sirloin steak that was on sale. That cut wasn't hearty enough. Can anyone suggest the cut of beef for kabobs?  Thanks.

Super easy marinade! All of these ingredients are staples in our household. I currently have filet chunks marinating for kabobs...everything smelled great, so I expect they'll taste even better. I ditched the additional salt since the soy/'shire/mustard combo have high salt contents.  Ready to fire up the grill...

Perfect marinade!  I've used this a couple of times now and everybody loves it!  The only change I make is to reduce the salt--I use a heavy 1/2 teaspoon.  I marinate the meat as long as I can--sometimes just a half a day and it comes out tender and flavorful!  Definitely a keeper!

Love this recipe. But good meat is a must. We bought a steak the first time, marinaded it for 2 hours and it was amazing. The 2nd time we used a roast, marinaded it for 24 hours and it was too chewy for us to finish.

The flavor is good, but quite strong.  I would go with just marinating and no basting, or no marinating and only basting.  The veggie skewers (which I did separate from the meat), I basted a couple times through grilling and they were perfect!

Very very tasty.  I didn't have lemons, so I used lime juice instead.  After grilling, I squeezed extra lime juice over everything which definitely made it better.  Served with rice.

VERY tasty marinade!

Made several times, each a big hit with everyone. Changes I made was omit the salt, added a dash of hot sauce, and added some red pepper flakes. Definitely a keeper.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I almost got lazy and threw out the excess marinade, but I was so glad I didn't.  Heated up, it made a great gravy. I actually used my broiler instead of a grill, but it worked perfectly.

When my husband took a bite of this he just stood there, wide-eyed and his mouth agape in disbelief at how good this was. Definitely going to be making this again and again. It was already very salty without adding the salt. I also put some summer squash and cherry tomatoes on the skewers. Top round worked really well for this recipe.

Oh MY Gosh! This is absolutely crazy good. Don't hesitate to try it. I love that it's just everyday ingredients we all have in the house, no special trips to forage for weird ingredients. Just good ordinary food. I can't wait to make this again.

This is probably the best recipe I have found on this website! The marinade is so versatile. I use the marinade on just the vegetables most of the time and it comes out so fantastic. I have relatives over and they all wanted to take this recipe home with them. I recently used the marinade on some pork loin and beef for kabobs and it just infuses the meat with so much flavor. My only tip when making this recipe is to cut the vegetables in giant chunks so that when you start to get to the bottom of the bowl, you don't loose the ingredients in the marinade. This is because there will be a lot left over on the bottom. Like I said, I love this recipe and I will be using it for my upcoming wedding!

memorial day hit, marinated the steak for 1 1/2 days and turned everytime I opened the fridge.  Meat was tender. I used sirloin steak cut into cubes. Very good will make again for sure.

Awesome!  I followed the recipe as written, w/the exception of the black pepper (I hate it) and I chose not to marinate my veggies, just the beef.  Awesome.  Did I say that already?  Our meat was even a bit tough (not the best cut of meat to use for this) and it was still awesome.  Great flavor that enhanced the natural beef flavor.  This will be a staple beef marinade in the LTH house.  THANKS so much mnmike!

These are amazing!  I used to use a different marinade but I wanted to try something else and I'm so glad I did.  I just loved this marinade and so did the rest of the family.  Due to a few people in our family having sodium restricted diets, I used 'sweet soy' and left out the additional salt.  Someone asked what type of beef to use for shish kabobs and I always use stew meat.   This will be my go-to recipe from now on when grilling shish kabobs.  It's important to use the rest of the marinade for basting, like the recipe suggests.  It really put it over the top!

Keep this one handy. It's a definite keeper. We used NY strips the first time then ribeyes the second time. Both were excellent.

Marinated overnight and added the mushrooms (as well as some eggplant cubes which I salted and allowed to "sweat" before adding to the marinade) in the morning.  Super tasty

Was so easy and really yummy. I used sirloin as well as LAMB (so so good!!).  I added a bigger selection of vegetables; listed veggies plus whole mini red, yellow and orange bell peppers, zucchini and snap peas and bacon wrapped whole pearl onions (yum).  I also used separate skewers for the meat and veggies to better control cook time for each.  Served over jasmine rice and all my kids and husband loves them. Will definitely make these again!!!

The marinade tasted awesome,it gave the meat a really good taste.
We cooked the shish kebabs on a small charcoal grill,so it took a bit longer(like approx. 45mins).
Thanks for the receipe idea!

I love this recipe! This has become my go-to marinade. I’ve made it countless times over about 5 years. Everyone is blown away when I use this marinade. I do recommend using a meat mallet on tougher meats though

Only change I made was to NOT add the salt.  Unless the original recipe called for low-sodium soy sauce, no extra salt is needed.  In fact, we thought it was still on the salty side so next time I will try it with low sodium soy sauce and add only salt to taste.  I skewered the mushrooms and meat together and the onion and pepper seperately so the veggies could cook longer. Everyone here enjoyed this after about 10 hours of total marinade time. Definitely making this again!

This was an excellent marinade!  We pretty much followed it verbatim and used some different veggies.  I would probably use reduce sodium soy sauce the next time we make it however because it was just a little on the salty side for our taste, but it was still very tasty.

Was hesitant to follow this recipe, only because it didn't have as many reviews as another recipe, but I'm glad I did.  It was delicious.  Used all the ingredients exactly as listed except mushrooms, and only marinated the top sirloin about 4-1/2 hrs.  I also didn't baste the meat, but didn't need to, it turned out great.  Used green peppers, onions, Campari tomatoes, yellow squash and green zucchini.  Will use this recipe again.

I didn’t add the salt, thank goodness. It’s still a little too salty but that could be my pregnancy taste buds because this is pretty close to my own steak marinade. Anyways, I added five or six shakes of basil,  cut down on the lemon a tad bit and added two cloves of garlic. All in all my whole family was very happy with it, and so that makes me very happy with it. (Minus the super salty flavor, but again I blame the pregnancy)

Great recipe as is.  Longer marinating time makes the meat more tender.

The proportions are off in this recipe. I made 9 skewers and there was not enough marinade for all of the beef and vegetables. Marinade is also very boring so I added 1 tbsp of sesame oil, another 1/4 cup of olive oil, lime juice and zest instead of lemon (lime and beef go much better together than lemon), 1/2 cup of water, 1/2 cup of Asian Sesame Vinaigrette salad dressing, 1/4 cup of brown sugar. This was a drastic flavour improvement and also increased the amount of marinade. Do not skimp on the salt and pepper, the meat and vegetables need the seasoning. A large bowl works fine, there is no need to waste plastic bags for the marinade. 

I parboiled the onions and red peppers for about 5 minutes to soften them a little otherwise with only 15 minutes on the grill you end up with raw vegetables on your skewers which I think is gross. I do not enjoy biting into a chunk of raw onion.

Trust me on the parboil method. You do not want to boil them to mush or you can't skewer them. By doing this, the onions and peppers finish cooking on the grill and the onions in particular can start to caramelize a bit. I only used vidalia onions, mushroom caps and red peppers as green peppers can be too bitter. 

15 minutes on the grill and the marinade turned into basting sauce, these ended up very good. It would not have been a success if the vegetables went on the grill raw. 

Be sure you boil the leftover marinade if you plan on using it as basting sauce or you will be basting your skewers

just made this recipe tonight and did not change a thing! Everybody loved it !  The meat was very tender and the flavor was amazing. The edges of the meat and veggies were brown and crispy while the rest was perfectly cooked. Tip: If you are using skewers that are larger than the thin bamboo ones, make sure you cut your veggies pretty large.  And make sure you get large mushrooms. I sliced an average red and green bell pepper into fourths and then cut each one of those in half. If veggies are too small they split and fall of skewers. I will be making these again for sure.

I've used this marinade dozens of times to rave reviews every single time. I prefer to let the meat marinade for only 2-4 hours. I find that it only tastes like marinade if I let it go the 8+ hours the recipe recommends. I like meat to taste like meat. Using a shorter marinade time just enhances the flavor instead of changing it. I normally use it with beef but it also works well with chicken.

This is a great recipe! I skewered the veges separately from the meat and mushrooms, Grilled the veges for 6 or 7 minutes  then moved them to the other side of the grill to finish cooking away from the coals. I put the steak and mushroom  skewers on and cooked them for about 4 mins on each side. Soooooo good! Thanks Mnmike, your Mom was right on!

Like others on here I used olive oil vs vegetable oil, I used low sodium soy and sea salt vs table salt...the marinade is one I will be using for EVERYTHING now...so good, I marinated overnight. My only problem was my veggies weren't as done as I would have liked them(I used zucchini, summer squash, red bell peppers and onion and potatoes) I par boiled the potatoes before I skewered them so thankfully  those were perfect! Also has anyone tried stew meat for this? Our meat got a little too tough, The cut I bought was Texas style something because they didn't have sirloin.

Very delicious! I did not add any salt as no need with some of the ingredients being salty enough, used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, dijon mustard, low sodium soy sauce, sirloin steak. I did add pineapple and cherry tomatoes to the kabobs. We all loved the flavor! Will definitely use this recipe again! Thanks for sharing!

This was a last minute decision to have beef kabobs so I could only marinate for 2 1/2 and it was still very flavorful.  I followed recipe except added pineapple chunks instead of mushrooms since I didn't have mushrooms.  Put everything (except pineapples) in zip bag, seasoned with Goya seasoning, then added the marinade and let sit in fridge for 2 1/2 hrs.  Put them on skewers and broiled in a pre-heated broiler for 8 minutes each side.  Served over beef flavored rice.  Added corn on the cob as a side.  Really quick meal and even quicker if you are marinating the day before!  This is a keeper.

Made this a few times now, and the whole family quite likes it.  The other times I only marinated the meat for a couple hours and the mushrooms not at all - this time, however; I marinated the full time and the mushrooms as well.  I will definitely marinate the mushrooms from now on - so much better!  The meat I found was too salty marinating for the full time though, so I think I'll cut the salt in half next time.

Made these for our camping trip and they were a hit! I had the beef marinating in a ziplock bag and the veggies all washed and cut up in another ziplock. When I got there I put them on the skewers and they cooked quickly and were delicious!

My family really liked it, although we all agreed it was a tad too salty, and that was after I reduced the salt.  I would suggest completely removing the salt from the recipe, as most soya sauces are salty enough to carry this recipe.
I think I will add a little more zip to it next time with some dried chili peppers.
All in all though, quite satisfactory.

I liked this marinade a lot. It is very strong. No need to marinate. Just mix the ingredients and cook.

Followed the recipe and it came out great with a strong flavor. Only marinaded the top sirloin cut up into cubes for 4 hours and that was plenty of time.

Used lime juice instead of lemon and low sodium soy sauce. I cubed beef and then marinated to save time.

There's a reason this is the first recipe that comes up in a Google search for shish kabobs.  It's amazing. Marinated for 24 hours. Really delicious.

Super tasty! My family loved it. I did substitute Tamari for soy, olive oil for veg oil and zuchhini for mushrooms. Will definately make it again.

Wonderful!!! Next time, I’m deleting the salt. My husband said it was perfect. It was a little salty to me. I did add squash to the skewers. It was a hit!

Excellent recipe! Followed the directions. Enjoyed this very much. Very easy. Great results. I would make this one again, and again. Really enjoyed it. Just make sure that you marinate your meet long enough (depending on the cut). I would definitely serve this to company with lots of veggies on the skewers. Thanks for posting!

It was pretty good as written. I feel it could be monkeyed with a bit to suit individual taste fairly easily, but not necessary by any means. Will make again.

It’s just okay. I so wanted to like this recipe. I followed some of the other reviewers advice and omitted the salt but I think it needed the salt. It was rather bland. I marinated in the sauce for about 12 hours and then grilled them. Whatever leftover meat and vegetables I didn’t put on the grill, I combined with the chicken and vegetables from the “yummy honey chicken kebabs” recipe and marinated another several hours. I then sautéed these together and added hoisin sauce and oyster sauce, salt, sesame oil, minced garlic, and olive oil. It was better. I doubt I would try this again.

I wasn't sure whether the marinade would be too salty or have much flavour as it is.  It sure did and was delicious on the beef and  veggies!

I cannot even describe how wonderful this was. So so so TASTY!!! Only changes I made were used olive oil instead of vegetable and used a 1/2 teaspoon less of salt than what was written, and didn't use as much black pepper because my pepper is really strong. Otherwise, followed ingredients list exactly and marinated in fridge for 24 hours along with two bell peppers.

Good basic recipe  that I will keep as a base for adding other spices as desired.   Made double batch of marinade - 1 for the meat and the other for the mushrooms, onion, bell pepper, Italian squash.  We used tri-tip beef.  Marinated the veggies and beef for about 12 hours and didn't need to baste while cooking, so saved time reserving and cooking down marinade.  It all tasted great!  Wanted to take a picture but it got eaten up pretty quickly.  Thanks for submitting your recipe.  : )

These were absolutely delicious! I didn't have a grill so I broiled them in the oven for 13 minutes and they were still so perfect. Absolutely delicious, juicy, and perfectly flavoured. My new favorite BBQ recipe. Thank you !!

Last summer I wanted to do more Bar B Que and love kabobs so my first recipe was this one.  The only subs I made were low sodium soy and Worcestershire sauce. It was amazing and my family members loved it.  Now on my list of favs.  Thanks for sharing.

Tried this on a whim with chicken and pork kabobs...OMG!!! My fiancee and I loved it!!! She even wants to bring it to the hibachi we normally go to because it's that good! I am not one to normally leave reviews, kind of weird because I scour reviews before I purchase items, eat at restaurants, or do several other things; but this was great! Give it a try, it's made with things that are readily available in anyone's kitchen! You won't be disappointed!!!

This is an amazing recipe!! We've made it twice now and it turns out amazing. I didn't marinade the meat for the full time recommended the first time I made it, and should have...when I followed the recommended time it turned out even better. Highly recommend!!

I made this last night and it was delicious!  I only had time to marinate for a couple of hours, so I imagine it would be even better with more time.  Highly recommend.

If I make this again I will definitely leave out the added salt, as it was too salty and tangy for our taste.  The mushrooms were my favorite part.  May try making a vegetarian version with only the peppers and onions and lots of mushrooms!

This is delicious!  However, for the marinade the soy sauce (I used Braggs) has enough sodium to negate the need for additional salt.  I saw another review that suggested leaving off the salt and I wholeheartedly agree.

I used Sirloin Tip and marinated over night with the mushrooms. To die for. So happy for this recipe. I will do this again. Honestly, can't wait to do it.

Mine was a little too salty, maybe because I let it marinate for 12 hours instead of 8.

this marinade is perfect.  It didn't cover up the delicious flavor of the rib-eyes on the kabobs, but enhanced the vegetables and pineapple beautifully.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe is a definite keeper! Loved it! I took the other reviewers  advice and reduced the salt to 1/2  teaspoon.  I also did not marinate the mushrooms.  I used flat iron steak for the meat and it was so tender!

Our family really enjoyed this recipe, adds nice flavor to our less savory cuts of beef (we have our own meat butchered privately so it's sometimes a challenge to find ways to use all the various cuts up).

I made it exactly as it is written and it is definitely 5 stars as is! I used London Broil and it was perfect in 11 minutes with a 5 minute rest. We kept the meat and vegetables separate and cooked them to their respective doneness. We definitely plan to make it again.

Didn't really get the flavor of the marinade coming through with just 8 hours. Maybe I'll marinate over night next time.

This was really good- I made it as directed only skewering the vegetables on separate skewers so I could cook them longer than the meat and mushrooms. I added chicken and shrimp also. My husband recommended that I add some ginger and brown sugar next time to the marinade. I brushed marinade on the vegetable skewers as they grilled. I used asparagus, snap peas, grape tomatoes, peppers, and onion wedges. I will make this again! I didn't add any salt to the marinade and used lite soy sauce. It was plenty salty but not overly salty.

Reduced salt to 1 teaspoon. Par boiled red, orange peppers  and purple onion until almost tender to reduce cooking time of kabob + I don't  like crunchy vegetables, I only had time to marinate meat for 3 hours.  Used petite sirloin cut into chunks.  Since the sirloin wasn't real thick, I only cooked it for 10 minutes which was too long, it should have been only 8 minutes. DELICIOUS!

Divine!!! Only changes made are that I used whole grain mustard, olive oil, and did NOT cook until brown on the inside - we prefer medium rare. Tender and delicious.

I made this recipe last night, using olive oil & low  sodium soy sauce. Marinated 8 hrs and then grilled. I was really pleased with how they came out. Both my husband & I loved it! This recipe will be grilling staple this summer.

I made these shish kabobs for tonights dinner. 100% delicious.  The only bad thing i have to say about this is, i didnt marinate long enough. Only 5 hour because of time. I will definately make this again.

I decided to decrease the amount of salt by almost 1/2, Most cooks know soy & worcestershire sauces are salty to begin with. I still felt I could have decreased the amount further. Next time, I'll go for 1/4 tspn. Thought lemon in this marinade was a strange ingredient, but was pleasantly surprised. Also pressed a large clove of garlic. In retrospect, 16 hours of total marinading time seems a bit excessive, will try adding the meat & mushrooms together for 8 hours total marinading. LOVED the mushrooms marinated this way, why couldn't I marinade ALL the veggies? Hmmmm? I will make again, will tweak to my personal tastes. I can see this being a good base for other meats & veggies.

Why would you add so much salt when you have already Soy Sauce which is very salty to begin with?  Also why would you use vegetable oil instead of olive oil? Also you need some balsamic vinegar or cooking wine vinegar to balance this out. The lemon juice will not be enough.

This was delicious. I marinated the beef and mushrooms together for 8 hours, as I forgot to start them the night before.  I also forgot to save the marinade to cook down and baste with. I cooked over hot coals for four minutes, then turned them over for another four minutes. Beef was medium rare, which is just the way I like it. I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil.  Was surprised how great the portabella mushrooms were. Will make again soon!

Absolutely wonderful, my favorite beef kebab we've ever made.  Didn't remember to put in the mushrooms for more than an hour or two, and they were still awesome.  Used some sirloin steaks cut up

Grant will eat more mushrooms than a grown adult

These are delicious and the whole family loved them.  The marinating process takes some time but is well worth it.  Like many of the other reviewers, I plan to skip the salt next time.  The other ingredients contribute plenty of salt to the recipe.

I made this today. I thought it was very good. Like some of the other reviews I did not add salt. Next time I would try low sodium soya sauce.  This is a keeper.

This tastes fantastic! I used top beef sirloin. The only thing I did differently was marinade both the meat and mushrooms together for about six hours because I didn't have enough time to marinate as the recipe states.

Very similar to the same marinade I grew up with. In addition to the listed skewer ingredients, I didn't change a thing in the marinade and it was awesome. What I did do was add a few more ingredients to the skewer itself; bacon, whole green olives, and pineapple. I just put a piece of bacon, the same size as the meat, right next to the steak. Then just added the olives and chunk pineapple to the skewers.  I think it adds that salty/sweet combination family loves. In the end, great ingredients, good variety, and my family goes nuts for it!!

Fabulous! We devoured every morsel. I also boiled the marinade to use for dipping. The only thing I would change is not add salt next time.

This is delicious!!! I love the flavor of the marinade. I actually splurged and made this with filet mignon. It was so easy to cut the meat and the kabobs were super yummy. Great recipe.

I followed the directions but changed the salt to 1 tsp. It was still way too salty and not enjoyable. I am going to give it one more try with no extra added salt.

I will make this again but I will not add salt and lower the soy sauce. I always like to give a cook the benefit of the doubt and follow the recipe but it was way too salty. Flavor was great but the salt was so much my husband couldn't eat it.

This was really good and I did chicken as well because I have a athlete in the house that doesn't normally eat beef.  The chicken was better than the beef and I think I will add my steak seasoning next time, but overall a big hit.

I've made these a few times and they are awesome!  I marinated for a few hours and added the mushrooms for 1 hour.  I didn't have a lemon the last time I made them and used a lime and they were even better!  I used low sodium soya sauce and didn't add salt.

This was an awesome marinade.  I did it with chicken for eight hours and followed the recipe with everything else.  Looking forward to doing this again.  Thinking about doing shrimp for 30 minutes.

Great marinade. Like others, I cut out the salt and it was fine. I have always had problems when I skewer meat and vegetables together since the veggies cook so much faster than the meat. So, I now use two separate BBQ baskets and put the beef into one and the veggies into the other. I baste them and turn them separately and it's much easier to handle that way. Use pita or serve over rice. Really good!

I made these for Mother's Day! Everyone loved them. I used London Broil and it was delicious. I marinated the meat and veggies overnight, in separate bags. We also used the marinade for brushing on while cooking. This was great for a party when people are coming different times. We just grilled what we needed and then grilled more when the rest of the guests came. Also, the food store cut the meat into cubes for me.

That marinade is so delicious! I used avocado oil and the only mustard I had was dijon but it turned out great. I cut up some sirloin steak and marinated it overnight. I am so glad I tried this recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us.

Made this tonight for dinner.  I only marinated the meat for 6 hours and due to my own mistake I did not marinate the mushrooms.  I also added a good pinch of red pepper flakes to the marinade and used low sodium soy sauce.  I also cut back on the salt due to health issues.

Dinner was awesome.  I used a trip tip roast and included zucchini.  The meat was awesome and came out medium.  

I served this with a whole baked onion and warm bread.  It was delicious.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

Followed  the recipe exactly with the exception of the salt.  I felt the soy sauce added plenty.   Delicious!  Will definitely  make again.

The only changes I made was added twice as much beef and mushroom as I love mushrooms and the beef is to help get more protein out of this recipe; I had to make twice as much marinade.  I used select sirloin beef.  This was the most delicious shish kabob variant that I have ever witnessed.  Wife was completely blown away at how this turned out.  I made the marinade just as described.  Thanks for posting this!  I will forever be making shish kabobs with this recipe.

I thought it was so-so. Followed measurements correctly, but I think it was a little too Worcestershire saucey for my taste. My Girlfriend really like it though. I might try it again, minus Worcestershire . Any suggestions for a replacement condiment?

This was so good! I tripled it for 12 people, and they ate all of it.  Will make it again.  The steak and mushrooms in the marinade was delicious. This marinade really brings out the steak flavor, The only change I made was on accident I increased the Worcestershire sauce and it still came out great!

I was looking for a healthy marinade.  This was simply perfect.  Not sweet.  I used Filet pieces, olive oil, low sodium soy sauce and left out the salt.  Marinaded the filet overnight then added the mushrooms.  They were such a hit!  We entertain a lot in the summer and this will become one of our regular rotations!

I made this yesterday. It was delicious!!  I made the marinade as described minus the salt. I divided the marinade up between a bag of meat and then a bag of vegetables. I used red onion, red pepper, and zucchini. I marinaded them for about 4 hours in the fridge and then skewered and put on grill. Loved it!  Thank you for the great recipe!

We doubled the recipe and marinated 4 pounds of top sirloin chunks overnight. We made more marinade a couple hours before cooking for the peppers and onions. Got lots of compliments on it! Definitely a keeper.

Fantastic exactly as is!  I've used this marinade for pork tenderloin as well, really good.  I'm also incredibly lazy so instead of making proper kebabs I've recently started mixing everything in a 9x13 pan with some of the marinade and broiling it, turning over often.  Great flavor, will use again and again and again!

Made it exactly as written.  Yes it was salty, but I served it on pitas with http://allrecipes.com/recipe/cucumber-gyro-sauce/ which tamed down the saltiness nicely.  Also used grape tomatoes and chunks of zucchini on the skewers.  Excellent!

Way too salty.  If I make it again, I will cut way back on the soy sauce.  And I even used a low sodium one!

We LOVED this!! I only had a small ziplock bag, so I just marinated the mushrooms separately in Zesty Italian dressing. These were so good! Would definitely make them again! I also only used about 1/2 the meat/veggies, as I only had enough for 4 kebabs. Delicious!

Very tasty and simple.  I had very little time to marinade, so I doubled the mustard and garlic in order to ensure those flavors were we incorporated.  And I left out the salt on the advice of others and could not agree more.  There was no need for added salt.

I love salt....people often complain I use too much.  But the saltiness in this recipe was even too much for me. It wasn't too bad on the veggies that were just basted with it, but the meat that was mmarinated in it was like taking a huge bite of straight salt.

I took the advise of other reviews and left out the salt.  I also used low sodium soy sauce.  It was perfect for our tastes.  We really enjoyed it and I think the longer it marinates - the better it is.  Served over seasoned rice.  The leftovers were just as good.....maybe even better Yummy!!!

I used this recipe for my memorial day beef shish kabobs. They were my family's favorite dish! The only changes I made was to use olive oil, liquid amino, instead of soy sauce, and used organic honey mustard. I marinated the steak and mushrooms overnight, separately. The vegetables I used were squash, zucchini, red and orange peppers and red onions. This recipe WILL be used again.

I was searching for a marinade that sounded good and this hit the spot.  I, like many others, omitted the additional salt and I was running low on lemon juice so I used less than what was called for.  Also, because I really enjoy ginger, I added several tablesppons of fresh grated ginger.  The recipe adjuster made it very easy for me to tweak for the group I needed to cook for (kabob for 50+)!  Very impressed with the marinade and I anticipate I will use it frequently in the future

Made it last night with my wife. We only let it sit in the marinade for about 30 mins. We used beef stew chunks and reduced serving size to two. We also added a little bit of onions to the marinade just for a little extra goodness. We both loved it and it will definitely be on the menu again. One of the most mouth watering marinades I have had.

This was very tasty ! I usually just marinate the beef in italian dressing, but this was a million times better. Was not sure about the soy sauce (I dont usually care for the taste}. But this was amazing!!  Will definitely use again for other beef recipes.

I've been making this for a year and I never posted a review on it. It's well overdue. This recipe is perfect! I only marinated a total of 8 hours and I added the onion pieces with the mushrooms for the last 4 hours. It was beyond delicious! My husband devoured it. The taste was simply outstanding! My in-laws request this when they visit. Thanks so much for sharing. This is in our summer meal rotation for the 2nd year running.

I tried this marinade last night and it was a big hit with my family.  Both of my extremely fussy children had second helpings of the steak!  I made a few tweaks by omitting the mushrooms, doubling the lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce, and cutting the salt in half.  All in all an excellent recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Thought these were great!! Did not add the salt. Never add Salt to anything that uses that much soy sauce.  Also chose to use low sodium soy sauce.

The marinade was a-mazing! Incredibly simple and tasty. I used Tri-Tip steaks cubbed up and marinated over night(the day of I marinated the bellpeppers and red onion and hour before grill time)! They were a hit with my family, my 4 year old ate 3 kabobs.
