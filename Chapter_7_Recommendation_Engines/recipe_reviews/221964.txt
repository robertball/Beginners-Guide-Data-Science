To the people complaining about the peanut butter: don't let the name fool you, this is Thai-flavored.  It's meant to have a strong peanut taste, and if you don't like that you should be looking for another recipe.  

I love the sauce just as written.  It gives the wings a lot of meatiness that they normally don't have.  I've made these for regular dinners, parties, and functions, and they've always been a huge hit!  When I put them alongside more traditional wings, this is always the plate that runs out first.

The only thing I change is that, after a lot of experimenting, I've found 30 minutes of initial cooking (turning half-way through), and then 5 minutes afterward gives me a much juicer product.

To Oesi:  I would use a mildly flavored jelly, such as apple jelly (not grape/berry or your appelstroop) and a tsp of chopped fresh hot chiles and a few drops of vinegar to achieve the flavor or jalapeno jelly.

These were amazing!
I made my own pepper jelly for this, what an amazing combination. I am about to make this for about 10 people tomorrow and am feeling pretty good about them!

Sounds great, as I absolutely love satay,  but what can I use instead of jalapeno pepper jelly? Nowhere to be found in the Netherlands.

Definitely will do this again! Since I don't have jalapeno jelly I used smuckers jam and added fresh jalepenos and pounded them all down with motar/pestle. Before adding the PBJ mixture..I tasted the baked wings. It's just as good on its own..and I agree-It does taste like satay!

This was an instant hit at my house.  I used my homemade cherry-jalapeno jelly, a lot more siracha, and used the sauce to coat chicken tenders to cut calories.  If you like thai this recipe is for you.

I tried this recipe this weekend. The peanut butter was overwelming, just way too much.  I made the sauce first and wound up doubling everything but the PB or I would have thrown it out. Depending on your love of peanut butter I would half the measurement or add to taste. The Jalapeno jelly is actually sweet and slightly spicy, not hot at all. I added extra Sriracha because my family loves hot wings. I didnt have fish sauce.  I looked on the internet and used 1Tbls Soy sauce and 1Tbls lime juice as a substitute. In the end this was pretty good and the kids got a kick out of eating PB & J wings. I'll probably make it again but without peanut butter.

Step 3 doesn't work and doesn't match the video.  I ended up with a clump of stuff.  I went back to the video and sprinkled those ingredients on the chicken and it came out well.

I used chicken leg quarters instead of wings.  I cut the peanut butter down to half because I didn't want it to be overpowering. They came out delicious and it was pretty easy to make.

Everyone enjoyed this recipe & most didn't know wings were seasoned with peanut butter. I didn't have fish sauce but thing it would have added more flavor. I baked wings 20 minutes on one side & 10 minutes on the other. Wings were juicy & my double recipe was gone in no time.  A bit labor intensive but worth it. Geri

Made my own jalapeño jelly, otherwise followed instructions to the letter. It's not like I need another hot wing recipe, but this one is unique, interesting, tasty, a dinner topic in itself and therefore a keeper. Thanks Chef John for posting yet an other keeper.

This was my first time making chicken wings. This recipe sounded good. While traveling to Nevada I found some Jalapena Jelly in a Gift Shop. I thought this would be the right type for this recipe. Since I never made wings before I was tentative in how spicy to make them. They were on the mild side but I thing next time I will add more "heat". It takes a little time for all the preparations but it is certainly worth the effort. Everyone wanted more.

This is GOOD!  You could even leave the jalapeno jelly out and replace it with something that has a good sweet/sour combo... like half a cup of fresh raspberries or blackberries (some of them unripe)... but you'll still have to replace the salt and hot of the jalapeno jelly.  :)

Hands down my son's favorite wing sauce (and he's tried them all).  And this recipe for baking the wings is the final word on the perfect baked wing that tastes crispy/fried.  I make all my wings with this recipe, regardless of the sauce choice.

Love these Wings and all of Chef Johns recipes!! I have never made the Peanut Butter and Jelly Sauce but use a barbecue sauce to coat them. They turn out great!

Made this after I viewed the recipe and reviews, but didn't have wings so adapted for a whole chicken cut into parts by half, used legs, wings, some breast parts and (gizzard, lol) as I was only preparing for two so adapted recipe accordingly, our tastes found it a iittle salty but understand need salt to give it that uumph, next time will add all spice but cut down on kosher salt, as usual, Chef John, you have the touch, Bravo, only rating 4.5 stars because of the salty taste :)

Sauce is good, but I used my deep fryer. A lot less fooling around than trying to "fake" the deep fried texture and taste. Also did this with drumsticks. Excellent. Way more meat and CHEAPER!

Ok, but I wouldn’t see this recipe again. I took them to our family’s annual chicken wing contest, where they were voted “most unpleasant” out of the 10 entries. I didn’t think they were so bad, but definitely not a hit.

I keep making these for parties, pot lucks, and any get together where someone says they love party wings. They never fail to be a huge hit! This last time, I cooked up 6 lbs of wings and drummettes for about 20 people at a potluck, and they barely lasted 20 minutes! Next time I'll double the recipe. Sooooo good!

If you enjoy peanut or sesame noodles, you will love this recipe! This recipe has some heat, but just enough; easy to make; and, my kids loved them. I didn't add salt.
