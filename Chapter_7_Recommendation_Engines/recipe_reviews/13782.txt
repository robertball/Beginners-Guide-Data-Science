Tried this recipe using fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Used 3 large tomatoes and only 1 cup of sugar. Forgot to put the cinnamon on top. Thought it was fairly good though it could have used even less sugar. Picky veggie eating 12 yr-old son even liked it. Also it was have been even better if my bread hadn't been so fresh or next time will try a "thick & hearty" type of bread. All in all will try again with mentioned changes.

I have been looking for a recipe like my grandmother's baked tomatoe for years as she didn't write anything down. This is the closest I have found. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned & cut the sugar back to 1 cup. Next time I will use 1/2 cup sugar as it was still a little too sweet. My oven will not go to 325 so I baked for 75 minutes @ 350. It was a hit! There was not a morsel left. Everyone loved it. My father was scraping the sides of the pan to get all the crunchy/crispies stuck to the pan. My son asked when am I going to make it again. This is definitely a keeper

Went easy on the sugar and doubled the tomatoes - good thing as there wasn't anything left. Short time under the broiler gave a "crunch" to the topping

This recipe was really tasty I cut the sugar in half and was sweet enough I don't think you need anymore of that. I used canned tomatoes.

Served this at our Thanksgiving and it got good reviews overall. I use canned whole pealed tomatoes. I had cut the sugar back to just 1 Cup and it was still quite sweet. Only less-than-good reviews it got were from those that thought it was too sweet which came from people that are not big sweet eaters. Next time I'll cut the sugar back to about 2/3rds or 3/4ths of a cup.

1.18.17 I wanted a side dish with a little sweetness and this recipe piqued my curiosity. I knew with our taste preferences some things needed to be altered and although I rarely do this on a new recipe I did make some changes. I scaled this down to 3 servings which then called for 1 cup 1 tsp sugar and I used 1/4 cup...you still could taste plenty of sweetness. I wasn t exactly sure what crumbled bread was supposed to be so I coarsely chopped the bread in my mini chopper (used 1 slice not 3). Finally I dotted the top of the casserole with about 1 Tbsp of butter (not 1/4 cup 1/4 tsp) and baked it at 350ºF instead of 325ºF. Don't skip that little sprinkle of cinnamon because it really added some interest to this hot tomato side dish. I know I know please don t judge me for making a lot of changes but I knew as written we would be disappointed. Modifying the recipe as I did resulted in a tasty new side that I will be making again.
