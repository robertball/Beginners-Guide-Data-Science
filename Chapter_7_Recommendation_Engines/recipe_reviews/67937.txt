I had to give four stars as the recipe was written.

The taste is 5-star, but the instructions resulted in two little dry blobs of white flour in one of my mini loaves!!!  Unacceptable!

I would have been mortified had I served this to company!!

I think the steps need to be amended as follows:  CREAM butter and sugar, ADD eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition, MIX in mashed banana, MIX in DRY ingredients to WET in three batches, scraping down after each, STIR in nuts.  It makes no sense and serves no purpose that I can see to *stir* in banana, eggs or dry ingredients.  They need *mixing* to be thoroughly incorporated.

I added 1 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp cinnamon. Used dark brown sugar/white in a 3:1 ratio.  Pecans instead of walnuts.

Have not tasted anything this great in a LOOOONG time!  The crust is fabulous, banana flavor is great, moisture is awesome!  And I read it will be better tomorrow!! 

Amazing.

FINALLY! Someone who KNOWS what banana nut bread is supposed to be! Like others, I added 1/2 tsp baking powder, used half white and half dark brown sugar, and used pecans instead of walnuts. This is JUST LIKE MOMS! Thank you so much! I had tried two other recipes from this website and they turned out to be more like banana nut dessert cake, THIS is banana nut bread, it has substance! I used 3x8 loaf pans (it filled them just right), reduced the temp to 325, and cooked for about 70 minutes. They were a little too brown on the top, but that's just my bad electric oven, the humidity, and the combo of unbleached flour and dark brown sugar most likely. Mom would be proud of this bread! If you want something healthy to snack on, eat a luna bar, if you want something tasty, eat this bread! PS: If anyone wants to save a bowl and skip a step, I just mixed the wet mix as directed, then dumped the salt, baking soda, baking powder, and flour on top and mixed it all in at once. It turned out FINE.

This is a great recipe for banana bread! What I love about it is its intense flavor. It's is unlike most banana breads in that it is very dense and quite moist. You can taste the butter in this bread along with the bananas--it practically melts in your mouth! My house smelled so YUMMY as the loaves baked. My family and I went through both loaves in just two days. Caution! It is highly addicting and hard to stay away from! The only changes I made to this recipe were #1. I added 2 tsp. vanilla #2. I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts & #3. I baked for 55 minutes instead of 60-70 minutes (this would have overcooked/burned the loaves)I have a 4 year old oven that bakes evenly/accurately. I would check the loaves of bread at 55 minutes before allowing them to cook any longer. This recipe easily earns 5 stars! My kids & hubby can't wait for the bananas to over-ripen! It would be hard to flub this recipe!

ok.. stop rating recipes if you change half the ingredients!!  I made this exactly as written... baked for 55 min. and it was totally "Bomb Dizzle!!!"  Holy Cow! The only thing I did different, and I highly recommend trying, is, instead of greasing and flouring, grease, and coat with cinnamon sugar!  Makes the whole crust taste like a muffin top!  this stuff is amazing!

Wonderful recipe!  I, too, added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, and an extra 1/2 cup of walnuts.  I also split the sugars between white and brown.  This made 3 8x3" loaves (baked for 1 hour).

Oh me, oh my!!!  In the name of watching my girlish figure, I substituted Splenda for the sugar, Smart Balance Light for the butter, and Egg Beaters for the eggs ... and I STILL can't stay away from it!  Best of all, it's only 90 calories a serving with these alterations.

I couldn't resist this recipe for some reason.  I passed on the one from this site with over 2000 reviews to see if this was as great as everyone said.  The reviews on the "other" one were really mixed not like this which were mostly 4 and 5 stars unless something went wrong.  I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 of brown.  Used 1 tsp. each vanilla and allspice and had just barely 2 cups of bananas (4 whole bananas)I mixed the butter sugar mixture really smooth and added 1/2 the bananas to that as well so some were chunkier and some smooth and i also whipped the 4 eggs with the beater to get them fluffy.  Made one with walnuts and one without for picky family members. just by the smell and picking off part of the top i already knew it was going to be a hit! I was concerned with the amount of sugar but looks like i had nothing to worry about because it's fantastic!! Mine took exactly 1 hour and could have used about 55 minutes.

REDUCED FAT variety!! Holy COW is this GOOD!It's scary good! I have never in my life had better banana nut bread!I used Smart Balance instead of the butter, and I included the 1 tsp of baking powder, 1 tsp of cinn. and 1 tsp of vanilla as recommended by others. I made it in two loaf pans and it was done in 45 minutes. It is incredibly moist and not at all dense... very light. Perfect in every sense!Everybody who has had a slice immediately goes mmmmmmmmm...I had to force myself to stop eating it long enough to write this review!

After viewing some of the suggestions, I added a teaspoon of vanilla, a teaspoon of cinnamon, replaced half of the white sugar with brown sugar, decreased the oven time to 55 minutes at 335 degrees.  Dark, moist, dense, flavorful, and delicious!  Great plain or with cream cheese.

This banana bread was delish!!!! We couldn't stop eating it, especially my 5 year old!!! I used pecans instead of walnuts, and it was still good.  ONE THING I STRESS THOUGH, WATCH YOUR BANANA BREAD AFTER ABOUT 40 MINUTES OF BAKING.  I checked on mine at 45 minutes, and it was perfect, any more time, and it would have been dry like other people have complained about.  I forgot to state that I added a tsp of cinnamon and vanilla to it too.

Yikes. I have been making this recipe for three years now and I just discovered I had not yet reviewed it. This IS, by far, the best recipe ever for Banana Nut Bread. I have been baking for years and I don't dish out 5 stars for so-so recipes. For those of you who did not like it, you must have done something wrong- this is worthy of more than 5 stars in my opinion and any other person I know that has tried it feels the same. If you have a problem with darkening of the tops of the loaves, place a sheet of foil over the two loaves about 15 min before it is finished baking. It also makes great tea sandwiches by cutting small thin squares of EBNB, spread with mixed cream cheese and confect. sugar. Then place very thin slices of strawberry between two slices of EBNB that you have put the spread on. Beautiful and classy presentation, as well as delicious...

This banana bread is a heavenly decadent treat.  Cannot say enough.   I used brown sugar instead of white sugar.

This bread is pretty good. Its a little salty but I kinda like that I think. Maybe because the butter I used was salted instead of sweet? I only had 1 1/2 cups bananas so I put 1/2 cup applesauce. Anyway I like it as far as banana bread goes. I would use this recipe again but with more banana and sweet butter.

I've made this twice now and both times it hasn't risen into a bread but rather sat there and bubbled until it gets dark. Seems like there is wayyy toooo much baking soda in this recipe. It has really good flavor but I am never doing this recipe again.

This banana nut bread is aaaaamazing. I followed some of the reviewers suggestions and added baking powder, cinnamon, and vanilla. 1 tsp of each just to make it easy.    As long as you combine all the wet ingredients together first and then slowly add the dry ingredients in 2-3 increments, you cannot go wrong.    wet: mix room temp butter plus sugar thoroughly first, then add beaten eggs and vanilla, followed by mashed bananas    dry:flour, salt, baking soda and powder, and cinnamon -give it a little stir    Finally add walnuts or pecans, then bake.    -I found that mixing brown + white sugar yields the same results as just using white sugar.     Thanks so much for the recipe and suggestions, my co-workers couldnt stop raving about it =D

This recipe might be a practical joke. I doesn't rise, turns dark brown, is much too sweet, too dense and leaves your fingers greasy. I've baked a lot of banana bread, and this was terrible. The worst part is, in addition to the time you'll waste, you'll also waste 1/2 lb. of butter, 2 cups of sugar and 4 eggs. I had a small slice 20 mins. ago, and I can still taste the sugar. My 2 sons will eat it. They'll eat anything.

Holy Moly is all I can say...I only had enough banana's for one loaf so I cut the recipe in half.  I'm going to the store today to get more banana's so they'll be ripe this weekend - this was amazing!!!  I can't STAND when people rate recipes they've changed, but here I am doing it (but they're just slight changes!!!).  I added 1 tsp vanilla, a dash of cinnamon and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.  I also changed the mixing "order" by adding the dry ingredients into the wet as it's easier to thoroughly combine that way.  The only bummer for me was the 350 degree oven cooked the bread too quickly so the outside was very dark.  Even with the bread being too done on the outside, this was hands down, by far, the best BNB ever.  I can't WAIT to make it again next weekend and lower the oven temp to get it JUST perfect. I'd give this 6 stars if I could!

Found this recipe easy to make and even easier to add my own spin to it.  I would not recommend using banana extract as it overwhelms the taste of the bread and nuts.  A dash of vanilla extract was good.  And the recipe as written is enough to make a large bundt cake.  I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white.  Also lined my bundt pan with nuts and a little brown sugar before pouring in the batter.  I'll try to upload a picture.  You can add dried fruits like cranberries, raisins or little chunks of raw apples to this mixture with excellent results.  I really liked using this recipe and I want to thank Saseigel for posting it.

I'm a beginner at making things by scratch and cooking, and this recipe is easy and amazing!!!!  My mom always makes this around the holidays and I was worried that wouldn't be able to come close to making it as good as she does, but this is so easy, and such a perfect recipe, you can't go wrong!!! LOVED IT!

This recipe prompted me to join allrecipes.com because I was so incredulous at its superlative rating.  First and foremost, let me state that, in my opinion, it is greatly over rated.  I mean no disrespect to Saseigel (or her mother) but this recipe - as originally submitted - turns into a greasy, overly-dense blob.  It does not rise.  It browns to an alarming degree.  It would be milk-toast bland had I not added a teaspoon of vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  New cooks and seekers of  the perfect banana bread - beware.  Intermediate cooks, and above, this may be worth your consideration, but you will have to reformulate it, and, by then, it will be a totally new recipe so why start with a base that is so fraught with shortcomings?  I really wanted to embrace this recipe but, in all good conscience, can not endorse it on any level.

This strange recipe makes wonderful banana bread that somehow taste light, in spite of all that butter, so you are tempted to overeat it.   I followed the recipe faithfully except I added the tsp of baking powder and I creamed the butter and sugar together as one cook recommended.  I am always cautious about over beating a quick bread batter especially once the eggs are added so I did NOT beat the eggs 'to make them especially fluffy' as another cook advised.  It is possible to toughen the crumb of a quick bread by incorporating too much air.   I blended carefully.  This bread was a huge hit at our house.

i did add the 1/2 tea spoon of cinnamon and nutmeg, and i had not enough butter so i used olive oil mayo and i only had two reeeaally ripe .... black... bananas but it was sooo good. i read earlier that some people were having a hard time to get the bread to rise, the problem is in the stirring the recipie says to stir just until the ingredients are mixed thats cause the baking soda acts immediately and if you stir too much youll pop the bubbles  and all that baking soda will be for nothing and the end result will be .... flat

I have made banana nut bread my entire life. I decided to try this recipe because there were so many great reviews. Big mistake! There definitely were not enough bananas in this recipe and way too much sugar and eggs. This bread falls in the middle. I do not recommend this recipe.

If I could give this 10 stars I would!!! OMG this is by far the best BNB recipe I have ever made. I did, as well, add some vanilla extract, but other than that I followed the recipe as it reads, and it turned out perfect. For the longest time, I used the Starbucks BNB recipe, no longer, this has become my new favorite.  Thanks so much for a fantastic recipe.

Very good banana bread recipe, if you like it SWEET.  My walnuts sank to the bottom, I must have done something wrong.  I've never had that happen in banana bread before.  Overall, I think this is one of the better recipes but not exactly what I am used to.

Best Banana Nut Bread ever...The first time I made this bread I sift the flour. I've made it a million time since then... Sifting is not necessary. It taste just as wonderful, plus one less step.

Excellent, dense, full of flavor, very rich. JUST like moms! Note to others... if you want a "cake-like" light banana bread this is NOT the recipe for you. This makes a VERY heavy dense rich dark bread, think pound cake, except denser, or fruit cake, except tastier. If you like pound cake (or fruit cake, does anyone eat that stuff?), you'll probably like this banana bread. This is not an afternoon tea cake, this is a curl up by the fireplace with a mug of coffee (or milk) kind of cake.

I had a little trouble with collapse in the center of each loaf, but delicious.  I got rave reviews and that's what counts.  I used the small individual loaf pans, four, and one large.  The small loaves take only 30 minutes and are really tasty!  Thanks

I've made this several times and it always turns out great.  The first time, I made it as written and it was yummy.  Now, I usually add a tsp of each baking powder and vanilla, about 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and probably extra banana as I never measure the banana...just use what I have.  Sometimes, for a special treat, I'll toss in a cup of chocolate chips for fun.

May 1, 2009 -  I gave this recipe 4 stars because of it's presentation.  I made this recipe last week for a breakfast function and got rave reviews for it and not one piece was left after the function. A few of my colleagues have already asked me to make it again.  I made these early in the morning and discovered that I did not have any walnuts, so I used pecans and raisins. However, I thought that it was too soft and it did not rise good enough.  Next time, I would use some baking powder with the baking soda.  Even though I sifted the dry ingredients, I still tasted the sharpness of the baking powder in some places.  I tried them in cupcakes but they were very flat.  Otherwise, the taste was great.   ******************************************                                      May 28, 2009 -  Voila!! I made a few adjustments and now I have the right texture. I decreased the butter to 3/4 cup and the eggs to 3.  I also used 1 teaspoon baking soda and two teaspoons baking powder.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg each.  The batter was a little more stiffer and the loaves rose nicely.  I doubled the recipe and made three 9 x 5 loaf pans.  Again I got very good reviews.  One person who had a piece the last time commented that the texture was better.  This one is a keeper.

Wonderful. I had let two bananas get way too ripe, which was the perfect amount for one loaf. I halved the recipe and everything turned out great, using about 1/4c brown and 3/4c white sugar. Thanks for sharing :)

thank you for posting such wonderful recipe! i was looking for banana nut bread recipe and yours was the first one i saw on google, with so many rave reviews it is proof its a great recipe. Although i did accomodate it for my own tastes, like chef sandra i used 3/4 cup of butter and slightly less sugar, only 1 and a 1/2 cup. I also added vanilla and pumpkin pie spice. I baked it at 325 because my oven tends to be very hot and let it bake for 50 mins. I covered the loaves with foil fifteen mins before the time was up because they were already a deep brown and i didnt want the top to burn before the inside was done. With the tweeks it tastes perfectly sweet not to sweet, and it has a yummy banana flavor and very moist! it is a lil dense so make sure not to over mix the dough because it can make it too chewy and dense. love it! it would make a good breakfast with some milk whenever your in a hurry! I love it with a glass of orange juice!

WATCH OUT! There is no way that picture represents THIS recipe! My bread , with recipe followed EXACTLY, came out almost black! And it was raw in the middle. I took it out at 50 min because it looked burned already. I don't even want to eat it. It didn't rise, it's sticky and greasy on top, and it smells like burned sugar.What a disappointment.

I am not much of a cook or baker.  But my mother was, so I appreciate good recipes when I come across them.  I really have no skills what so ever when it comes to baking.  This turned out perfectly.  I mixed the wet ingredients, then tossed in the dry right on top of each other.  I did add two tsp. of vanilla.  These two loaves turned out perfectly and were delicious.  No dry spots, no rising problems, no problems at all.  If anyone has a problem with clumping and dry spots, I recommend mixing a bit longer.  Thank you for this recipe.

5 star rcipe. This recipe is wonderful. All my friends and family loved the bread. My 80 year old grandmother said it was the best she had ever tasted. I made a homeade cream cheese spread to go with the bread. This recipe is a keeper!

This is a pretty good banana bread for those  who prefer dense breads. It is similar to other recipes except it includes much less flour. I read the reviews about it not rising well, so I replaced the baking soda with baking powder because soda requires an acid in the ingredients to activate it. Mine did not rise much, but it did not sink in the middle either. After greasing my pans I did not flour them, but coated them with cinnamon sugar, and the point everyone commented on was the crust-it was yummy. I chose to use half white and half brown sugar and switched out the walnuts for pecans, adding some vanilla and cinnamon (which everyone liked). I lowered the oven temp after a little while and covered them with foil and they cooked through perfectly, not mushy or wet inside but still moist. The banana flavor was definitely present and I may make this one again with these modifications.

Awesome Recipe!  Turned out great, like others I added a bit of Vanilla Extract and mixed equal parts of white and brown sugars.  You definitely need more than 1 cup of nuts, probably closer to two.  I mixed walnut and pecans which was a good idea if you ask me.  Also, I added Semi Sweet Chocolate chips (about 3/4 of a standard bag), then sprinkled some additional nuts and chocolate chips on the top after I poured the batter into the pan.  They turned out tasting like the Banana Chocolate Chip muffins from Paradise Bakery, only with nuts.  Just a wonderful recipe overall though!  Highly recommend it.  Remember, because of the way this recipe is constructed, the bread will turn out only about 2 1/2 inches high, which increases the density and the moisture, so don't expect it to rise to the top of the pan. Convection ovens are great and will make this bread finish at the 50 minute mark at 350 degrees.  Cook a little longer for a stronger "crust" like top.  Thank SASEIGEL whoever you are!

This was the best tasting bread ever! I should have pureed the bananas as suggested because the chunks are a little too...ew...My husband loves it but I think it would give it a little something extra if I had pureed them.

I added the cinnamon, vanilla, and split the 2 cups sugar into brown and white. It was perfect.

This bread was 'Extremely' greasy! I was looking for a rich and moist banana bread recipe, and I guess my personal definition of 'rich & moist' is way off because this is not what I had in mind. Sure, it is rich and moist, but not in a good way... It's just so greasy that it ruins the experience of enjoying this bread. It does, however, taste delicious, but the taste alone is not enough to make up for the very obvious flaws and first impression. Also, followed the recipe EXACTLY, and the loaves didn't rise and sank in the middle when I took them out. I was planning on sending these to work with my husband, but not anymore... I would rather not be embarrassed by their terrible appearence and extreme greasiness! I think this recipe, because it tastes so good, could be salvaged with a bit of tweaking... perhaps either more flour, or less butter, and the addition of baking powder to help with the rising, as baking soda just wasn't powerful enough. Overall, I'm very disappointed with the turn out, but am atleast consoled by the fact that the loaves are edible and I don't have to waste them... they just can't be seen by ANYONE other than my husband and I. (yes, they are that bad!)

I have baked this banana nut bread but after years of cooking and almost as many years using another banana nut recipe, I couldn't bake it without making a change in the ingredients.  I believe I found an error in them.  I think the baking 'soda' should be 'baking powder'.  That's why some people are getting flat bread because it's the baking powder that makes it rise. At least that works for me and I thought I'd pass it along so you can use it if you wish.

Not the best banana bread I've ever made.  Very little rise to it, so it was particularly dense, and I adjusted the baking soda/powder ratio.  There isn't really any acid in the recipe for the baking soda to react with, so if I were to make it again, I'd probably use all baking powder, no soda, and maybe a little extra than is called for.

This was the most disappointing banana bread recipe I have ever used.  I followed the instructions and it is wayyyyy too sweet and the tops fell.  I have never ever seen a banana bread that the tops fell.  I wouldn't recommend this recipe to anyone and I certainly wouldn't give it away as a gift or present on a buffet table to guests. I've never rated any recipe on here before but felt that I had to for this one.  I also have no idea on how to use the stars on here but if I could I would give it 0 stars.

I made a couple of adjustments but it was still very good, moist and quite banana-y! I used half whole wheat flour and half unbleached flour. And I used half brown sugar and half Splenda.

Reading the reviews, I was so excited to try this recipe.  It is a greasy, goopy, soupy MESS.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The greasy butter bubbles atop a wet, sloppy mess.

This is the best Banana Bread I have ever had. I did add a few more ingredients this has to be the tastiest Banana Bread  ever  I added 1 tsp pure vanilla extract 1 cup of sour cream 1/2 cup honey and instead of 2 cups of white sugar I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of dark brown sugar. Well this recipe makes 2 loaves of Banana Bread and I cant keep it in the house for more then 24hrs. Thank you for posting the Best Banana Nut Bread my family and I has ever had.

This is such a great recipe.   I made a couple of changes.First I used only 1/2 cup of butter and then added 1/2 cup of applesauce to decrease some of the fat,  (You cannot taste a difference) and I added a tablespoon of cinnamon, (you can also use nutmeg or allspice) and 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  This bread is just wonderful and everybody who has it allways asks for the recipe.

Absolutely the best banana nut recipe ever.
It is better than recipe I have been using for 40 years...the only thing I changed was instead of flour to coat pans, I used butter, sugar and cinnamon.

I decided to make this banana nut bread because it had such great reviews. The only thing good I can say about it is it was very easy to make. That's why it got 3 stars from me. But in saying that I think that's where the problem is. Sometimes you have to put a little more effort into something to make it special. This was not special. First of all I noticed right away that there was no vanilla listed in the ingredients. I don't like to rate anything unless I've followed the recipe to a "T". So I left it out. Big mistake. This bread really didn't have much taste at all. Especially not banana! Disappointed. Also, an entire cup of butter is TOO much! I could have probably used half of that. The bread was very greasy as well. Along with no taste and the grease, I threw the entire thing in the trash. Sorry. I don't understand what all the fuss is about this recipe. I'll stick to my more complicated recipe that has lots of flavor and much less grease.

OMG! The best recipe ever.  Because my husband is diabetic I lowered the sugar by replacing 1 cup of sugar with 1/2 cup each of brown sugar splenda & regular splenda.  From prior readers recommendations I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp baking powder.  I only had two ripe bananas so I filled the 2 cups needs with pulp I had from my juice I made (apple, oranges, strawberries,tomato & carrots).  It turned out wonderfully moist and tasty.   Now I have a recipe to fall back on when my bananas go ripe instead of throwing them away.  By the way, I made this bread in a bundt pan and baked it for 55 minutes.

With so many reviews I just had to try....I took some of the ideas that everyone listed & tweet it for my needs.  To cut down on calories, I substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 cup of butter.  I also divided the 2 cups of white cane sugar & used Splenda, Dark Brown Sugar & White Cane Sugar.  I also added 1 teaspoon cinammon, 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract, 3 dashes of nutmeg, 1 teaspoon baking powder, 4 oz mini chocolate chip morsels(all I had) & 1 - 1 1/2 cups of pecans.  PERFECT mixture for bundt pan & mini muffins & OH SO YUMMY!!!  TY all for sharing & happy baking!!!

Years ago I had an amazing recipe for banana bread but I loaned the recipe card to a friend and she lost it and I have been trying to duplicate the recipe ever since with no luck. UNTIL NOW!! what a great recipe! I made it with two cups of Splenda (I am diabetic) and 2 cups of whole wheat flour and everyone in the house loves it. I have to hide it to be able to have any Lol! Dense,moist and fragrant....the best!

Quite Yummy & hubby loved it! Didn't see the salt, so that wasn't added. Did add vanilla & cinnamon & will add more spices in the future.  My 3 large bananas didn't measure to 2 cups, so filled out w/sweetened /cinnnamon applesauce.  Also, used soft marg & ran out so finished that cup out w/the applesauce, too. Then was trying to get it in the oven & added choc. chips instead of chopping nuts. Also added some baking soda.Rose nicely,& was done in 55 minutes-5 minutes less might have been even better. I will definetly be using this again.Also used half white sugar, half brown sugar. Thanks for a great recipe!

All the previous reviews are right, this is habit forming and addictive, I made these for a neighbor who is always doing nice things for us (and used half of the batter for some for us)  I followed the recipe exactly but made them as muffins and cooked them at 350 for about 20-25 mins (I just kept an eye on them and took them out when a fork inserted in the center came out clean)I think it made 23 or 24 muffins. I thought the recipe adapted perfectly to making them as muffins which usually doesn't happen for me when I try to change anything about a recipe.   It is ridiculous how many I ate!!  Thank goodness they are all gone so I can stop now.  
Thanks for a great recipe!

I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla and used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar as suggested by others here and it was done in about 50 minutes. GREAT RECIPE!

After researching quite a few recipes on-line, I decided to try this one and boy am I glad I did! I decided to modify the recipe as stated above and I knew if the bread tasted as good as the batter did, we were in for a great treat tonight! I was a little worried about the dark color the bread was becoming while it was cooking, but appearances can be deceiving!

My husband and 14 year old son couldn't wait to taste the bread...they had tasted the batter and the smells from this bread cooking were awesome! I couldn't cut it fast enough after it had cooled down enough to handle...they each had 2 big slices (and I had one) and it was amazing! Can't wait to try it tomorrow after all the flavors come together! Good job Saseigel!

GREAT RECIPE! Not the typical heavy banana bread. Perfect consistency, no matter what substitutions you use.  Works good with 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar, oil and butter combos, and/or adding vanilla.  I have made it as written and with modifications and always great.  I always omit the nuts due to nut allergies in our family, but never a bad batch.  I add a sprinkling of cinnamon sugar atop for a flavor touch to the crustiness. DON'T LISTEN TO THE COMPLAINERS THAT THERE IS TOO MUCH SUGAR!  If you don't want sweet bread...don't make one!  Pretty hard not to be sweet when it is a sweet bread with 2 cups of sugar. Duh!

Excellent recipe. I didn't change the ingredients, however, I did change the order in which the ingredients were mixed. I creamed the butter and sugar together, then added each egg and beat the mixture thoroughly between each egg. I then added the bananas and then the flour mixture. The walnuts were last. I am going to try to add some vanilla to kick it up a notch next time. This is a wonderful recipe - it came out moist and tasty. I definitely recommend!

My husband absolutely loved it!
Here's what I did:
Cream butter(not melted) and sugar with whisk until light and fluffy. Then, add and beat one egg at a time. Add and beat 4 ripened bananas. Add and beat sifted dried stuff into the 1/4 wet mixture. Repeat this 4 times. Add 1tsp Vanila and beat. Pour the mixture into the mold and baked at 325 degree(mine is conventional, so had to lower the temp by 25 degree) for 60 mins. It came out great! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This banana bread is AMAZING.  Like other posters, I used 1 cup Dark Brown Sugar and 1 cup white sugar.  I also used 1 tsp (or more) vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg.  Also, 1/2 cup extra chopped walnuts and 1/2 tsp baking powder.  I usually go a little over on the bananas too and the fat content is a little more than necessary (I use 10 tbsp butter and 3 tbsp vegetable oil).  The base for this recipe is incredible though.  Even if you make it exactly as the recipe says, it's still great.  I literally melt when I eat this bread.  Excellent, excellent, excellent.

OMG My house smells amazing!!! ok so i may have jumped the gun rating but i couldnt resist.
i did have to make a few adjustments because i live at high alt. i only put 1 1/2 tsp baking soda, and added about 1/8 cup extra flour , cut the sugar (1/2 brown 1/2 white) by a half cup and raised the oven temp to 360. if it doesnt come out right, it is due to my error trying to adjust for the altitude. but AMAZING recipe :)



UPDATE- It came out PERFECT! will be making this again
Anyone living at high altitude shuld make the adjustments i did and you will not have a problem
-bake at 365-65
-cut sugar by 1/2 cup
-cut soda  by 1/2 tsp
-add 1/8 cup MORE flour

the easiest and best recipie I have found for banana nut bread.  I can't tell how many times I've passed this recipie on now.  The only changes I made is mixing the drys together and the wets together, but thats just baking sense and not really a change. I highly recommend trying this recipie.

I make this every year for Xmas gifts and I would not change one thing about this recipe.I do put in one Tbles of cinnamon in it . I use small loaf's and it makes 10 loaf's.When I spray the loaf pans I sprinkle cinnamon and sugar all around and when they come out they have a nice crust of sweet cinnamon and sugar on the outside.I then wrap them and put them in the freezer and then give them out for Xmas.All my family wait for these loaf's and all my friends.If you want a good Banana Nut Bread this is the one to bake and you will be baking them every year.

This recipe was really good!  My new favorite banana nut bread recipe this is a real keeper.  I did however mix it up differently.  I first cream the butter then added the sugars  I used half brown half white sugar, then add eggs one at a time twhen mixed up alternate your dry ingredients in thirds until incorporated.  I also added some extra flavor like teaspoon of Vanilla and teaspoon or two of cinnamon.  The crust was great.  In fact off to the kitchen to break into second loaf!

O.k., so, don't laugh, but I halved the recipe which was the perfect portion for us.  This is the change up that I made to this....I added 1/4 tsp of ground cinnamon, and used toasted pecans in place of the walnuts...Now...I baked it, served it with cream cheese...yummy...BUT the BIG surprise and the best thing in the world, use this for pancakes...I made pancakes, and served with a warm pecan butter syrup....I had to make extra...wow...double wow!!

Wow made as is this is dense and wonderful. It also has enough liquid to hold up well to adapting using gluten free flour. It is so good. I debated over the addition of cinnamon, etc. I am tired of everything tasting the same because of the cinnamon, etc. addition so I left it out of this. And I'm glad I did. I did add a hefty tsp or so of vanilla. This is a great bread. I didn't add baking powder and perhaps it would have helped it to rise, but I believe it is intended to be dense and it is so yummy made as is, with the addition of vanilla, and using the walnuts as indicated. Glad I made as is. YUMMY! 5 STARS! Thanks for sharing!! OH and for those who are wondering the butter should be softened and could even be melted (i suppose). I used it softened. Perfect!

I've made this bread about 5 times in a month and a half, everyone who tastes it absolutely loves it.  I can't make enough! I bake it in (3) 8X3" pans to stretch it out and just reduce the cooking time by about 5-10 minutes and its just great! The best I've ever had for sure!!!!!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is the best recipe!!  I have never made banana bread, and I tried this recipe, because I am going to be making a variety of bread to give out as christmas gifts this year.  This is definately a keeper!!  The only thing I did differently is added a tsp. of Baking Powder.  Turned out great!  This bread was super moist, and I gave a loaf to my mom.  4 days later, she had a piece left which I ate and it was still just as moist as the day I made it.  Definately worth making.  Health warning is right though...it is hazardous at home and don't eat the batter!! LoL. It is hard to control yourself.

Fabulous recipe! My whole family loved it, even my daughter who dislikes nuts. I substituted whole wheat flour since we try to stay away from the white. It turned out great. I also substituted pecans for the walnuts. I mixed together all the ingredients except the whole wheat flour and then slowly added the flour without over mixing since I wanted the bread to rise. I have had baked goods rise poorly when I stir too much. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe. I am taking it to my Bible Study tomorrow and I know they will love it!

I have made this recipe twice now, and it's turned out well both times.  The first time I made it, I made the following changes:  1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, 1tsp vanilla.  The bread had good flavor, but was really greasy.  The second time I made the bread, I only used one stick of butter and added two cups of natural applesauce.  It turned out great!  I recommend this recipe to everyone, especially new bakers as this was really easy to follow.  My only recommendation is to cut back on the butter.

I went with the rating on this recipe. I made the bread as directed, unfortunately it wasnt anything like the users raved about it. I have had better banana bread before. This one definitely went in my garbage. It was hard, too much butter, the taste it left in my mouth was very greasy.

This is the best banana bread I have ever tasted and my husband just loved it.  You are so very right the one loaf was gone in one day, and it is just the two of us.  I like experimenting so this is what I did and it was fantastic.  I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of light brown sugar.  I only had 1 1/2 cup of bananas so I used 1/2 cup of drained crushed pineapple, and also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and some flavoring 2 teaspoons of homeade vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon of banana extract.  It was great and wrapped in the aluminum foil to keep in the moisture was a great tip.  I just put a batch in the oven, but used smaller pans, like that I could share or put some in the freezer to enjoy another time.  My husband likes his with a little ice cream.

This was a great recipe.  My husband and his friend loved it, and said it was the best they had ever had- and my husband has always been a banana bread fan.  Following other reviewers advice, I added one cup of white and brown sugar, and added a teaspoon of cinnamon. *The cooking time seemed way too long, my loaf was done in 45 minutes.

very good recipe. did someone forget to use baking powder? i added 1 teaspoonful to recipe and it was excellent. i also added 1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract, but can't say it really improves recipe. using butter instead of shortening or oil makes my old recipe obsolete.

This recipe EASILY gets 5 stars from me. It's perfect in every way. So buttery, nutty, and rich! I have to give half of it away so I don't wind up eating it all myself. I tweaked the recipe to my liking a tad: split the sugar in half equally with white and light brown sugar. Added a tsp of good vanilla extract, and a tsp of ground cinnamon. Also, added about another cup of chopped walnuts. Didn't want the rest of the bag going to waste, and who doesn't like more walnuts? I probably ended up adding an extra  quarter cup of mashed bananas. Had a two left I didn't want to waste. Gave the loaves a turn half way through cooking for a more even bake. All in all, I won't be using any other recipe for banana nut bread. The boyfriend is in LOVE with it, and he doesn't like banana bread! Highly recommend.

This recipe is great! Easy to assemble, and baked beautifully. The only changes I would make would be to reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp vanilla. The bread is moist and delicious. Will definitely make this again in the future!

This was so good I am making it again tomorrow. To be on the safe side I ran the baking soda and baking powder through a sifter. The recipe does not call for the baking powder, but I added it based on other reviews. FYI, 4 medium bananas is two cups of mashed bananas. 

I did not make the loaf, but rather a batch of jumbo sized muffins, and a batch of regular cupcake sized muffins.  Make sure and spray Pam to keep muffins from sticking.

You'll have to bake for a shorter time, but I just sort of eyeballed the muffins and tested them when I felt they might be done.

This is probably the best recipe I have ever found anywhere. Thanks for a great recipe!

Oh my god, this really IS amazing! I just made it tonight, and tossed in a handful of chocolate chips too. I did make the mistake of trying it... now I want to eat the whole loaf!

Another hint- if you are like me and decide you want to make banana bread at the last minute and don't have any overripe bananas, gas stations are a great place to get very ripe bananas.

I made this the first time ever and it is just perfect! Mmhhh, this lovely smell in the kitchen:) I didn't change much, just added a hint of cinnamon. I mixed the walnuts in last, coating them in a little flour before so they don't sink to the bottom. I used half the dough to make a bread and the rest made 12 muffins, just so I could eat some while they bread was still baking:) It was rather light and fluffy, maybe because I only had cake flour left, but still very good. The only thing I might change is using other nuts, the walnuts are rather dominant in taste! But still, a great and easy to follow recipe!!!

This bread was so greasy!  The flavor was good, but it got VERY dark, wouldn't come out of the pan, and I even had the oven at 325 degrees and covered it the last 20 minutes with foil.  I doubt I'll ever make this again, even substituting applesauce for the butter.  We actually wrapped it in paper towel to absorb the grease!  I was very surprised this received so many positive reviews - we have made many pans of banana bread in our baking experience, but this one is not a keeper for us.

I made the recipe as-is except for adding maybe 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and was maybe a little too happy with this recipe because I ate a little over half a loaf in about 10 minutes!

I made banana muffins (no walnuts, sometimes chocolate chips) + a banana loaf (with walnuts) with this recipe (instead of 2 loafs). It was terrific. It's the first recipe I tried here and I liked it so much I haven't bothered to try another. Thanks for the recipe.

I've been a good cook for 50 yrs and never made a banana bread, but have eaten it many times and loved it. I decided to try this one since it had so many rave reviews and I had 4 bananas ready to do something with. I am hugely disappointed. I didn't change anything except for adding vanilla. It rose beautifully, but was way too brown after 30-mins. I lowered the oven to 325 and cooked til a total of 50 mins. It was too done. too brown, and not nearly flavorful enough. I can't imagine why all the praise for this one. Maybe a lot of today's cooks don't know what it's suppose to taste and look like. I just know I'll be more skeptical of reviews in the future and will be hitting my friends up for their recipes for banana bread soon. Happy baking!

The only change I made to the recipe was to add 1 tsp. of vanilla extract.  Also, copying from another recipe for muffins on this site, I baked one with crumbled  butter, brown sugar and flour mixed together over the very top of the bread which gave it more moistness and an added sweetness, but really you don't have to change a thing about this recipe because it's great as is!!

This bread is absolutely delicious. At first I thought that this bread was a flop. It didn't rise appropriately, which I believe was because I should have added 1/2 cup more of flour due to our high altitude. I will definitely try it again with adding more flour.

My first time making this recipe. I added 1 tsp. of nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla extract and instead of 2 cups of white sugar I did 1 cup of white and 1cup of brown sugar. Made this recipe taste great. The recipe calls for baking it for 60 minutes, but I would watch it depending on your oven. It only took mine 40 minutes don't get it too brown...do the tooth pick test to see if its done. Follow the cooling directions and enjoy!

Phenomenal!  I haven't compared this to my traditional recipe to see why it tastes so great, but it's addictive! I ran out of white sugar, so used 1/2 brown sugar which gave it a nice rich color.

This is definitely a great recipe.  I did as suggested and added the baking powder, and used half white/half brown sugar.  I also took the suggestion to use cinnamon and brown sugar coating after I sprayed the pan.  Adds a nice little extra!

Just made this tonight. Amazing! I changed a few things from reading previous reviews. I added 1 1/2 Cup white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 tsp of Vanilla. Baked for 55min on 355. Let it sit for an hour before slicing it otherwise it was gooey.

Love Love this bread....the only thing I did a little different was I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of lowfat vanilla yogurt (yes yogurt can be used as a substitute) for the 1 cup of butter.  I also used one cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg and about 2 tsp vanilla.  With this recipe I made 1 5x9 loaf and 37 mini muffins.

We liked it very much warm, somewhat less if it's room temperature, and not at all cold. This is probably because I replaced half the butter with applesauce. Then again, we like cold applesauce..so who knows. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla because really..no spices? None? I baked this recipe in a bundt cake pan for 50 minutes and it was perfectly done and moist. (Dusted the top with powdered sugar--may do a glaze next time.) I have to wonder if all these people raving about this recipe made it as written or if they read the reviews and changed things, because as written, it's pretty bland...

This is a great recipe. I followed the lead a few other people and I used 1tbl spoon of baking soda and powder. I also used brown and white sugar. I added nutmeg. Next i am going to try this with pumpkin instead. This is a great bread base.

Ok i have to say that i agree with everyone on this page haha. First of all this is the best banana nut bread i have ever tasted!!! Absolutely scrumptious! I gave it 4 stars simply for the fact of having the same problem as others...it did not rise properly, actually is sank in the middle! I took some suggestions and added some vanilla and a teaspoon of baking powder. Like i said the taste is superb but i wonder if maybe i mixed it too much? It is very light and fluffy yet very moist!I took it out at 45 mins and it was perfect, also i added the dry ingredients into the wet bit by bit! Any suggestions on the rising problem anyone??

Sorry, didn't think this was as great as everybody raved about.  First of all, it stuck in the greased and floured pans.  Secondly, I can taste the butter, but not much other flavor.  That could be my bananas, as there were very ripe, but not what I would call OVERripe.  I even followed previous reviewers' suggestions and added cinnamon and vanilla.  I did substitute part of the baking soda for baking powder to help with it rising a bit.  I used the correct size pans (even measured them).  The bread did not crown in the middle, as usually happens.  It is thoroughly cooked, much darker than most banana bread, but I attribute that to the excessive amount of butter and sugar.  It is not burned.  After about 45 minutes, I covered it with foil to keep it from browning too much, but it is a nice, rich dark color all the way through.  Like I said--way too much butter, the bread itself is greasy, and nothing to rave about.  I'm deleting it from the "saved" recipes.  Sorry for the ingredients involved (1 LB of butter, 4 EGGS and 2 Cups of sugar) I would expect more.

This was an outstanding recipe. My search is over for the perfect Banana Bread Recipe. So quick and easy to make. And definently habit forming.My 2 loaves were ready in 63 minutes exactly.The only changes I made were: adding a teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg,a teaspoon or 2 of vanilla extract and one cup of each, brown and white sugar.I never added the nuts to the batter. I chopped up some pecans and mixed them with a couple tablespoons of brown sugar. I then took that mixture and sprinkled it on top of the loaves before baking. The first time I made this recipe I used some vanilla and banana extract. Today I found some french vanilla extract at the store and tried it. Can you say yummy!!! My stomache is still smiling. In the past 2 weeks I have made this recipes 3 times. And I plan on making it again tomorrow night.Thanks for sharing!!!!

Made this on a whim since you can use melted butter, thus no pre-planning.  I couldn't find my loaf pans which are packed away somewhere. Instead I made muffins.  They were terrific.  I filled the muffin cups almost to the top and it made 2 dozen.  Since this recipe doesn't rise too much they turned out perfect.  I baked them for 17 minutes at 375 degrees, but next time I'd lower the temp to 350 and play it by ear on the time--the bottoms were slightly overdone.

Delicious recipe.....I made it as written just substituting pecans for walnuts.  I really like that the banana flavor shines through without the brown sugar and spices to compete. Thanks for sharing such a good recipe!!

This recipe is exactly what it says, extremely delicious, easy, and adaptable to your tastes.  We didn't have any butter and I was forced to use vegetable oil and the recipe still came out delicious and moist.  Also, since I'm in Colombia, Brazil nuts are cheaper and more readily available here so I substituted those out too.  It was a complete success.  I grew up eating banana bread because I'm from the USA, but no one here had ever had it before and EVERYONE was begging me for the recipe.  I have a gas oven and I, too found that the cooking time was more like 55 mins.  Also, here most households have azucar morena, which is basically raw granulated sugar (the brown kind) and I always substitute the raw sugar for any type of sugar, white or brown, and all of my recipes come out perfectly. I do a lot of baking and sometimes it's hard to find specific ingredients being outside of USA. That's why I was so glad this recipe was very basic.  Everyone has these ingredients in the cupboard. Next time, I think I'll try to use butter and make the extra additions of vanilla extract and cinnamon that other people have mentioned.  This is a great basic recipe  and it tastes just like my Mom's. Thank you!

This is the absolute best banana nut bread ever! I've made it about 10 times now and will never use another recipe. (I'm getting ready to make it again today.)

UPDATED 12.12.09: While I still agree that this recipe is THE best one ever, I decided to make a few modifications based upon some of the comments. From the start, I split the sugar so it's 1 cup each white & brown sugar. I also added 1 t. vanilla extract & 2 t. cinnamon. Today I decided to also add 1/2 c. of rolled oats and 1/2 cup of dried, unsweetened cherries. I also upped the overripe bananas to 2.5 cups. Baked it for 65 minutes (altho I checked it at 50 minutes w/a toothpick, then again at 60 min - be sure to reset your oven to 350 degrees after checking because it loses heat during the process!). I let them cool, wrapped each in plastic wrap, then alum. foil. Put one in a zip freezer bag & put it in the freezer for Christmas. The other one went in the fridge for a couple hours. We just pulled it out to try it & decided to KEEP these new additions. Thanks SASEIGEL for posting the original version!!

What a wonderful quick bread. Easy to do and fantastic taste. Gone in a matter of moments.I also like asking for a specific amount of banana ie:2cups rather than 2 large bananas.For our family,I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp vanilla. The bread has such a delicate wonderful taste that those family that used cream cheese lost some of the flavor. The addition of the cinnamon and vanilla just made the flavor stand out a bit more. Great, Great Recipe!!

You have to add more bananna to taste the flavor and be careful when baking, it does not require 60 minutes at 350.

By far the BEST! Kept recipe the as stated but, was shy about 1/4 cup banana. The bread still turned out the best I have ever had. Not too brown either as some other users claimed, mine was nice and golden. I did drop temp by about 25 degrees. Just got done making it and wondering how it could possibly taste any better in the morning then it did tonight. Thanx will make this my only recipe.

This was a delicious bread.  My only problem was that it fell when I baked it!  I added 2 tsp of banana flavor to it and put it in small loaf pans, planning on giving it as part of my Christmas goodies gifts, and it sunk in the center.  I think I'll use 1 tsp. baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder next time.

I am giving this a four because I changed a few things. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 applesauce to cut back on the fat a little. I also used 3/4c white sugar and 3/4c brown sugar. I made one loaf and 12 muffins. They are really moist and so tasty!

My seven year old and I make this all the time.  It's quick and easy...and tastes great!  I line the loaf pan with parchment paper (available at most grocery stores) so we don't have problems getting it out of the pan.  My whole family (and neighbors) enjoy this receipe. A g-r-e-a-t "in a pinch" receipe. Easy for a novice. I cut the receipe in half, when the family wants a little something sweet.

Update: I tried this recipe again, and during the last 15 min. I covered with foil & reduced temp. to 300. Excellent! I have tried so many BBs over the years, but my 9 year old asked me not to make anymore except this one. He ate a whole loaf by himself, BTW!I guess my quest for the The Great Banana Bread has ended, LOL! Original review: I have made this one a few times, the only reason I give it a 4 is because the crust on it always comes out really dark! But the taste is 5, I don't make it very often  because I can't stop eating it!

This BNB is truly amazing but talk about sugar-bomb!! As others have said, you really can only have so much of it.  I halfed the recipe and since I couldn't find my 9x13in loaf pan, I made 8 mini loaves with half the recipe.  I took others' advice by using half white/half brown sugar, added 1 tsp vanilla extract and pecans instead of walnuts.  I sprinkled some cooking oats on top before baking to make them look pretty.  I baked the mini loaves at 325 deg for 35 min.  So moist and sweet, it was definitely a winner at my household!

Wow!  This bread is fantastic.  I have made it for friends and every time I hear that this is the best banana bread they've ever had.  I've been using a 100 year old family recipe, but no more.  I first made it just like the recipe's instructions.  Then I made it with freshly ground soft wheat flour and sucanat with honey.  Even my white flour friends loved it with the whole grain flour.  I love this recipe!  Why eat the bananas when you can let them ripen and make this bread?!

I have made this countless times, and every time people go crazy over it!  It is absolutely the BEST - even better than my grandma's (and my mom agrees!)  It's become my signature recipe, I make it for all sorts of occasions.  Oh - and I add a crumble topping that really gives this an extra something special :)

An excellent and tasty bread. I used half white and half brown sugar and put a tsp of almond extract in. Delicious. Resist eating too much, it's very heavy in your tummy. Also, be sure to let it cool for the 2 hours in the fridge. Eating it too early makes it seems almost greasy. Follow the instructions and this bread can't be beat!

This morning was the 27th time I've baked this bread. To enhance the flavour I toast the walnuts, add a tbsp of vanilla & use half brown and half white sugar. Tried recipe with margarine...UGH there is no substitute for butter. I also add about a cup of high quality chocolate chips...ahhh heaven!!

Holy Moly!!  This was too good!!  I was skeptical of the description and reviews so I had to make it to see what all the fuss was about...and now I know!!  I can never make this again because I ate too much of it!!  I made one loaf with nuts (pecans) and one with out nuts (I preferred the one with out nuts).  Both loaves were beyond excellent!!  The sweet butter and banana taste was delicious!  I followed the advise of another reviewer and baked the bread for 55 minutes, which was just right.  Forget your diet for a couple of hours so you can enjoy this yummy yummy bread!!!

OH MY GOSH...this recipe is LETHAL.  Heed all warnings...it IS addicting.  I also added a little vanilla extract and used chopped pecans instead of walnuts *southerners don't do walnuts, we do pecans*...I have grown up on banana nut bread but this one is the best by far.  I used half butter and half oil, but think next time, will just use all butter.  It's TO DIE FOR  YAWL!

Alteration: Used (slightly less) 1.5 sticks butter, only 1 cup sugar, 4 overripe bananas, pecans in place of walnuts, added splash of vanilla.

Still, plenty sweet! Delicious and aromatic.  Versatile recipe. My loaf ended up on one pan and it is pretty dense. I normally have fluffier banana bread but the crunchy exterior has a nice texture and a satisfying crispiness to it that does very well when paired with a shot of espresso.

I had an extra banana so I added it and a little extra of each of the other items. I also added a Tsp of vanilla. I cooked only 60 minutes and with the extra batter I made some muffins and cooked a bit less about 20 minutes. They all turned out great!!

Also added less sugar and half that was raw brown sugar.. Baked it at like 320 for 35 minutes and it turned out really moist and delish!

I thought this to be very good on it's own. The next time I made it, I sifted in 2 teaspoons of cinnamon with the flour and added 2 teaspoons of vanilla to the creamed mixture. Only because I love cinnamon! This recipe stands on it's own merits as it is presented! Everyone loved it that way too!

I had been trying to find a recipe that was like my grandmother's. I was so happy when I came upon this one. It sounded very similar and when I made it, I knew it was the one! I love, love, love it & from the empty loaf pans, so does my family!! I did add vanilla, cinnamon, and 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar because that is just a preference of mine.

This recipe has WAAYYY too much baking soda. Baking time was about 45 minutes, and even then it was too brown, almost burnt,(and i baked them in Air Bake muffin pans). Awfully greasy too. I don't understand why you wouldn't add some baking powder to give it a little rise. Cut out some of the butter, and maybe add some buttermilk. Anyone who thinks this a good recipe hasn't had a good banana nut bread. Very disappointed.

I'm not sure how the recipe "as is" might turn out.  I was not inclined to make the bread until I read some of the reviews.  With the changes, it was totally deee-licious.  I creamed the sugars and butter; added 1 tsp. of baking powder; split sugars between granulated and brown; added eggs one at a time, blending after each one; used a very full 2 c. of banana (I freeze bananas that have gone ripe----in their skins); Added dry ingredients about 2 cups at a time on blend speed of my blender; I used my blender throughout. Stirred in one cup chopped walnuts.  It turned out so great that I can't stop eating it.  Was a huge success at a meeting I just hosted.  Thanks for a great start with the original ingredients.

I used Baking Powder instead of Baking Soda and added 1 tsp vanilla and a few shakes of cinnamon and it came out great.  HOWEVER, I screwed up and realized after it was in the oven that I only added TWO EGGS, not FOUR! Silly Me.  It still came out great!  And for me it only filled 1 cake pan, so I just have 1 big loaf of goodness.  :-)

EBNB - WOW! This was delicious - heavenly! It was flavorful, very tender (don't over-mix, which causes gluten to form), as well as dense and moist (it is not supposed to rise a lot - like brownies). Creaming the butter and sugar is important for a dense, moist crumb and for a slight rise: when you cream them, they can hold gas that arises from the baking soda. Melted butter will make an even denser bread and cold butter will make it more cake like. I added vanilla (2 tsp) as recommended by other reviewers. I prefer raw granulated sugar to more moist brown sugar for this recipe, which gives it a delightful crisp on the crust. If your bananas are very, very ripe (sweeter and therefore, less acidic), you might get a better rise with baking powder, but you will have to use more (1.5 tsp per cup of flour, or 3 tsp for 2 cups). This was a keeper, and it's hard not to eat the entire loaf in one day. Thank you for the recipe!

Love this recipe.  I made it today and it came out perfectly.  I cooked it at 345 degrees for approximately 60 minutes.  I sifted the flour 3-5 times because I used all purpose flour.   I also used organic walnuts which I had to crush myself. I used the kitchen-aid stand mixer to whisk everything together. 

I would agree with Virginia Sista that you must cream the butter.  Sift the sugar and then add it to the butter.  Continue to beat it until it's nice and smooth.  Although the ingredients didn't say to do this - I generally cream butter when making pound cake from scratch so I just figured that it would work well in this case.

Also I notice that when using the stand mixer that I still have to stop the beating and manually stir the mixture to make sure that there isn't flour sitting at the bottom of the bowl.

I used half butter and half margarine, used sea salt instead of granular, used all brown sugar as well as half and half, as well as white only
 This recipe is basically fool proof.  just start creaming butter and sugar first.  Best bread ever- husband eats one loaf before it is even out of the pan

Haven't read all the reviews, so I may be repeating some. Just took the loaves out of the oven an hour ago, so all I've had is one nibble--great, as expected. Substitutions I made: Had no baking soda, so used 2 Tbs. of baking powder. Didn't have enough butter, so used half butter, half olive oil. Instead of 2 c. white sugar, I used 1 c. plus 1/2 c. molasses. Didn't have 2 big enough loaf pans, so I used the one I had plus a smaller one and a small Pyrex casserole dish. Everything tested as done after 45 minutes, so out they came. Lots of alterations, so my rating applies only to the resulting hybrid. Bottom line, at least for me, is that you can adjust this recipe--and doubtless many others--ad lib to suit what you have on hand and your preferences. And still end up with a winner!

I just took it out of the oven and for some reason it did not rise like bread normally does, it was not even to the top of the bread pan...maybe it is suppose to be that way, as I saw another with the same complaint...have not tasted it it...oh and my baking soda was new so that couldn't be the problem.

This was wonderful! I've never made banana nut bread before and it turned out great. I did change a few things:
Instead of 2 c white sugar I did 1 c brown sugar and 1 c of white sugar. I subbed 1/3 c butter, 1/3 c coconut oil and 1/3 cup apple sauce to make it slightly healthy (less butter) added 1 tsp of vanilla. I added 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder and didnt use any baking soda. I also baked them in muffin pans at 350 for 32 min. Be sure to cream sugar with butter and beat eggs before mixing them in the sugar butter mixture. Will make again :)

This recipe is so simple, and the bread is delicious! We don't like nuts, but often sub chocolate chips. I always use 4 medium bananas. I can use all of the batter for 4 mini loaves (start checking at 30 minutes), or 2 mini loaves and one regular loaf. Yum!!

I loved this bread. I followed the suggestions from a few users and added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon and used 1 cup each of brown and white sugar. These were great ideas!
I also swapped 1/2 cup of the butter for virgin coconut oil, swapped out 1/2 cup of the white flour for 1/2 cup a mix of whole wheat flour with 1 tsp each ground chia and flax seed. This added health benefit but did not compromise the moisture or flavour at all!

I did add baking powder and cream the butter/sugar so I think that is what made it so light since many people said it was dense. I will only be using this recipe for banana bread now, so good. I made one loaf and 12 muffins (they baked in 25 mins)

Hi everyone! I'm mexican and love cooking. I have many american friends as well as canadian and I know they can bake whereas most mexican women cannot do it as nicely.

So I met my first banana bread some 3 years ago and my friend, Yolanda Brunner, helped me to learn to how make it. Sadly, though, I lost the recipe, and then I googled it, encountered this recipe, read the reviews and venture to bake.

I've made the EBNB twice and absolutely loved it!

In the altituted of my hometown, it takes only 50-55 minutes (Aguascalientes, city). I cut the sugar to 1.5cups to 1.75cups and added almonds since it's what I had available. I added 2/3 (or so) teaspoon of baking powder, reduced the amount of the salt and soda to a little less.

Well, thanks for sharing this and eventhough I agree instructions are drafted a little messy, most people can understand what they should do as long as the love baking.

Tania, from Aguascalientes, México.

Thanks again

The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because it looked almost burned when I took it out of the oven. However, it was moist and tastes delicious. For full disclosure, I used 3 overripe bananas, not sure how that measures out.

This recipe is great.  I did add a tsp of vanilla and a little cinnamon and 3/4 tsp. baking powder and decreased the baking soda to 1 tsp.  I did not have two loaf pans so I baked in a bundt pan at 350 for 50 minutes.  Turned out great.  Inverted on to cake plate and slice just like you would if it was baked in a loaf pan.

I was dissapointed when I couldn't find the recipe for banana nut bread that I've been using for years. I tried this recipe and couldn't be happier that I lost the old recipe! I've made bread & muffins using this recipe and they have both come out absolutely wonderful. Thanks for posting this recipe

I've made this several times without changing the recipe and it has turned out great!! The only thing I did do differently was as soon as it got firm while it was baking (about 40 minutes in) I covered it with foil so the top didn't burn! And it is true, you may want to print out the recipe and just have it on hand, bc I have given it out as many times as I've made it!

this is by far, the best banana bread, just don't forget to add the cinammon left out of the recipe. You end up with moist, flavorful bread that will NOT last.

This receipe takes a bit longer than 20 mins to prep, but is worth the extra time.  I also added a pinch of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg to the recipe. The crust is delish, but is moist in the middle.  I would recommend this recipe and will be making it again.

I've been searching for a good banana bread recipe that would work at high altitude for almost 15 years. This is the only one I have finally had success with!  Of course I did have to make a few small tweaks for my 8'900+ elevation, which are the basics of baking at high altitude: adding more flour and liquid and decreasing the sugar and leavening.  I also added a pinch of baking powder, two tsp. pure vanilla extract and used pecans. I could tell as the loaves were baking that this was finally it! The loaves didn't bubble over or stick to the pans like all the other recipes I've tried. They are a dark loaf, and mine came out with  concave tops, so maybe not the most attractive loaves - at least in my case - but who cares when they taste this good?

Where's the liquid in this recipe? No milk, buttermilk, yogurt, sour cream or even water! 2 cups flour and 1 cup butter? Sounds more like a roux than a quick bread. Just looking at it I wouldn't even try it. No wonder most of the 4 & 5 star reviews also modify this to the point that they are baking a completely different recipe. Because if they're baking this one, they're lying. I gave 5 stars so my review goes to the top of the list. Check out the 0 and 1 star reviews at the end of the list, you'll see what I mean.

I will say I had to try this when I saw the words unhealthy!  So far no one other than us have been able to try it.  In two weeks I have made it 3 times, today will be the 4th time and I am going to add blueberries in it!  Best I have ever eaten, just like my grandmas!

I followed someone elses advice and cooked for 50 minutes and added an extra tsp of vanilla and it was perfect!! I used a hand mixer for the butter, sugar and then eggs and vanilla-added the dry ingredients and mixed it all together. Pecans instead of walnuts.

This recipe is insanely delicious!!!!! The measurements are right on point and super easy to make! Use no less than 4 bananas. I tried 3 before and decided I prefer at least 4 for full flavor. I make mine into muffins and top with Duncan Hines (not the other brands) cream cheese frosting...SO GOOD!! This recipe yields a batch of 18 muffins which takes 17-18mins to bake. By the time you put everything away and clean up, they're done! They never last a day in my house...they are EXTREMELY ADDICTING!!! Enjoy!!!

I creamed the butter and all light brown sugar and added the eggs, FOUR bananas,  and dry ingredients. I then proceeded to add vanilla and some cinnamon. I used the bread machine rather than the toaster oven.

Wonderful recipe.  This is the best banana bread I've ever had and I make it often.  It's very moist and dense as it says it is in a good way.  For fun, I added about 3/4 chocolate chips the second time I made it.  This too turned out great.  I ended up using six mashed bananas both time with excellent results.  Thanks for the recipe and warnings.

This is without a doubt the best banana bread I have ever tasted.  I did as one reviewer suggested and creamed the sugar and butter together and then added the eggs one at a time.  I did add 1 tsp of vanilla, although I am not sure it would have needed it with all that yummy banana flavor.  I added the 2 cups of mashed ripe bananas (about 4-1/2 bananas), and then added the dry ingredients that I had previously stirred up.  I mixed that up and then added the nuts.  I could not find my loaf pan, so I simply greased and floured a 9 x 13 cake pan and baked it for 50 minutes.  We ate it in squares instead of slices and it was simply perfect.  This is the only banana bread recipe I will ever use.  Thank you so much for sharing such a wonderful recipe with us.

LOVE this recipe. I usually always make carrot bread for x-mas but wanted to make something different this year & stumbled up on this recipe. My first banana nut bread and I have to say that this beats my carrot bread by far.
I made a few changes though- I put 1/2 Cup vegetable oil 1/2 cup butter. All dark brown sugar & to make it extra moist I blended 1/4 cup of pineapple, 1/4 cup of peaches to the 2 cups of banana & added 1tsp. vanilla extract & blended together to make the bread extra moist & smooth. Then grinded up the walnuts and toasted them at 350 for about 15 minutes & added it to the dry mix. 
Everyone raved over this EBNB. My boyfriend even liked it better than my carrot bread & that says a lot. Thanks!

I had been using a different recipe for years until I tried this one. This makes such a dense, moist, flavorful banana bread. My husband and neighbors love it. This is my new favorite recipe. The more overripe the bananas, the better the taste. I follow the recipe except I don't add the nuts. I think I will try adding baking soda next time as others have suggested. My second batch really fell when they came out of the oven for some reason. But this is a keeper, will certainly make it again.

Just made this recipe and it is sooooo wonderful!  After reading other reviews I added a couple of dashes of cinnamon, a teaspoon of vanilla, backing powder, and coated the pan with Pam baking spray and then coated it with sugar and cinnamon.  Best I have ever made!

I would give this recipe a 10 if I could. I have made it twice and took it to work and got rave reviews and people asking me to make more. What I really like about this recipe is that it reheats well. Once taking out of the refrigerator, I can microwave a loaf for about 2 minutes and have moist, warm banana nut bread. Thank you!

I just made this banana bread this evening and I have to agree with some of the others that it is to greasy, to sweet, very dark and mine also sunk in the middle.  But it did taste good.  I have checked a lot of banana bread recipes and I believe the flour amount is incorrect.  Most recipes called for 1 1/2 to 2 cups flour for one loaf, this recipe is for two loafs.  I will try it again but increase the flour.

Hands down....the best banana nut bread I've ever eaten!!! .  The loaves came out of the oven  with a beautiful, dark golden brown color and the consistency was spot on!  The first two loaves didn't last a day in my house. This one is a keeper for my family!

This  banana bread would be great for a bake sale or for holiday giving!

Update: I tried 45 minutes this time and it was still already done and very brown. I guess I'll try 40 minutes next time .....Original post: Very moist and tasty but I had to adjust the cooking time.  I checked it at 50 minutes and it was done and even a bit more brown than I would have liked.  I'll try 45 minutes next time,

Taste was good but for some reason baking time was WAY off for my loaves.  I smelled burning at 38 minutes.  They were ok, just dark, and they didn't rise at all. Might try as muffins next time.

So far, best banana bread I have ever had!  Like, others, I added a little vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg, and changed out walnuts for pecans.  SO delicious!  Very moist and flavorful.  I also pulled it out of the oven at about 50 minutes and brushed the top with melted butter, brown sugar, and a few more pecans to create a crusty top.  Delicious!  Thank you for sharing!

Best BB ever!  I usually use this recipe and tried a different one recently and was very disappointed.  You can stop looking for a BB recipe here!  You can alter this with good results every time.  I used 6-7 bananas since I had that many that were super ripe, used butter crisco, half ww flour and 1/2 white flour, added 1 c wheat germ, 1 c old fashioned oats and a few heavy dashes of cinnamon.  Made 10 muffins along with my large loaf.  I added chocolate chips to the muffins only and now wish I had added them to the loaf as well.  Didnt have nay walnuts, still delish w/o them!  I also found I needed to lower my temp to 325.  About 20 minutes for the muffins and 65 mins for the loaf.

Wow! Watch out you will eat the whole loaf. I had to refrain! No kidding~Mine too 70 minutes to bake in Glass pans~I did take out 1/2 of the butter and added 1/2 cup of Applesauce to take a bit of the fat out. Added a touch of nutmeg1/4 teaspoon) & cinnamon (1/2 teaspoon). I just don't know how you stop eating this~ I can't make this too often for I will be as big as a house. It really is that good! Thank you for sharing it! LOVE IT! :) Yumm-0

My husband and I love this recipe. I followed it exactly, but instead of dividing the batter into two loaf pans, I poured it into my Breadman and used the "batter bread" setting. Since there was a lot of volume, the Breadman didn't mix it too well, but I had already mixed the batter (including adding the nuts) before pouring it in. When it was done, the center had caved in and I was expecting raw batter and a flop of an idea,  but the loaf was wonderful. It was dense and very moist. I will definitely use the Breadman to make this tasty banana bread!

This was incredible. The only problem I had was the fact that I only have one bread pan. But obviously, the problem eventually solved itself. This is seriously one recipe I will give to generations to come.

I wanted a new recipe and saw this.  
Of course all good cooks modify their recipes (laughing).  My major modification was putting on my Great Grandmother's apron because I needed help!  I didn't have the butter at room temp and it was a mess!  As soon as I put on the apron - I think my Great Grandmother took over.  

First, I only had 3 ripe bananas so I 1/2'd the recipe and used 3 mini loaf pans.

I also did the recommended:   1/2 brown 1/2 white sugars, 3/4 tsp. vanilla, and 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts.  Now for the kicker - I had bought a bag of culinary lavender sugar and sprinkled that on top of the batter before baking.  I took a photo but I do not see anything here about inserting a photo.  They are BEAUTIFUL!  Smell is wonderful, and I can't wait to cut into it.  

Thank you for sharing this recipe - I printed it and quickly hand-wrote in the modifications that I made so I can repeat it.

DELICIOUS!! I modified the ingredients and followed the directions from a review submitted by "Virginia Sista"  Follow these directions and modifications--You are bound to have the perfect batch!! --CREAM butter and sugar, ADD eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition, MIX in mashed banana, MIX in DRY ingredients to WET in three batches, scraping down after each, STIR in nuts. It makes no sense and serves no purpose that I can see to *stir* in banana, eggs or dry ingredients. They need *mixing* to be thoroughly incorporated. I added 1 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp cinnamon. Used dark brown sugar/white in a 3:1 ratio. Pecans instead of walnuts.

I need help with this recipe. Everytime I make it, it generally falls in the center after cooking and does not look the same as the photo, mine is much darker.  We love the taste and moistness.  Any suggestions?

Very sweet, dense and awesome!


6-4-11  Making this again this morning for my family home for the 4th...so easy to make but I prefer just to cream the liquids then add all the dry and let it mix well in my stand alone mixer...so awesome I'll be making it for the holidays.

ETA:  I went to make this again this morning and started creaming my ingredients only to find I only had two bananas...so I took the author at her word and used the two I had and substituted 10 oz. of store bought Fugi Apple preserves (it's all I had!!) and reduced the white sugar by 1 cup.  I honestly thought that I was crazy to try this but it made the best muffins EVER!!!  I plan on using this as a base recipe for other jams...I'm thinking strawberry banana!!

This bread is really good!  Eating a piece fresh from the oven as I write this.  I made according to the recipe, but used pure cane sugar and oil (how did I run out of brown sugar and butter!?) ; also added some vanilla.  Next time will try with brown sugar and butter...how can that not be good? :)  Definitely a keeper! i've tried several banana bread recipes from this site and others, and this one is closest to the perfect bread I've been looking for.

I made this recipe twice.  First time as listed and I thought the baking time was too long and the bread was too flat.  The flavor is just as good and better texture when the baking time was reduced by 15 minutes (always check for doneness),  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla (almond extract would  work too)  Greatly improved  the bread's texture & was still nice & moist.  Also using healthier butter replacement worked fine.

Truly the best banana bread! I used half brown sugar and half white sugar. Added 2 teaspoons each of vanilla and cinnamon. Coated bottom of pan (that has been greased and floured) with layer of cinnamon sugar. Used only 1 teaspoon of baking soda. It's to die for. Directions a bit quirky, but the bread is fantastic so it deserves a 6......out of 5.

I have tried many banana bread recipes and this is by far the best. The only changes I made was use 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar and a splash of vanilia. and I use 4-5 bananas.

This is EXCELLENT!!  Check bread at 55 minutes.  Mine was ready, and I"m glad I didn't leave it in for 5 or 10 more minutes (like I planned).  

Blend in ingredients slowly and one at time.  I recommend blending completely after you add each ingredient.  

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  
This is a keeper!

I moved in 2009 and lost my recipe for banana nut bread.  I found this one which looked close to my old one.  I am delighted to report that it went over great, both loaves were gone in less than a day!  I used whole wheat flour, added vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg and I'm lucky I got a piece at all!  Making more today, yummy!  Thanks for sharing!  PS: I also use the sugar in the raw, it's expensive, but real butter and good sugar make a huge difference!

So good! I used whole wheat flour and it came out amazing. I took the advice if another reviewer and added in cinnamon, baking powder and vanilla. I also added the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. I baked it for 47 min. I only made one loaf for  my husband and I but  I might just have to make another one.

OK I was a little disappointed, not with the recipe, but with the fact that by the time my daughter and her friends were done with it, I almost got a taste:) Very easy to follow with great results. Cook time for me was a bit less, but may be because of glass pans. The flavor was wonderful, and trust me you dont need to pile it with butter. Very GOOD!!! TY

This is a great recipe but I modified and would like to modify further.  Thanks to all the other reviews, I did as suggested.  I added 1 tsp baking powder, cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp, sugar to 1.5 c, reduced the butter to 3/4c and used 3 eggs.  I cooked at 350 for 50 mins.  It came out  great but still a little sweet for my fiance and my taste.  I will use 1 cup of sugar next time but thanks for the recipe and all of the reviews!!!

If you have trouble getting it to mix, have your kids use their CLEAN hands to do it.  My Grandma used to let me do this as a child and I loved it!  Do this when you make meatballs too.  Also, if you are having trouble with it rising, it is probably because the recipe omits baking POWDER.  Add a half teaspoon and that should do the trick.  Happy Thanksgiving!

I cut this recipe in half to make one loaf.  I creamed the butter and sugar, added eggs separately as suggested and sifted the flour, soda and cinnammon.   I mistakenly added two tsps of cinnammon to the one loaf, but it was great.   Thanks for an awesome recipe.    Next time it will be two loaves.

I concur with Virgina Sista regarding the write up but if you are a baker the basics of creaming, mxing, folding always apply.    That being said the only modifications I made was splitting the sugar white/light brown.  I added 1 tsp of cream of tartar.  I increased the amount of walnuts by 1/2 cup since my family enjoys them. I cooked approximately 58 minutes which was perfect.    The aroma throughout the house is palpable, the flavor, texture and density of this bread is spot on.    Thank you for posting it, you've earned 5 stars from this household!

I'm afraid I cannot even give this recipe a star, it was a complete disappointment.  I had to cook it too long and even then it came out goey and greasy.  It either needs more dry ingredients or the "wet" ones reduced.

I have been looking for a banana nut bread recipe and came across this one. I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I couldn't wait until it cooled down all the way, it smelled tooo good. I added a bit of butter to the warm bread. YUM.

Read all reviews and used most ... this is excellent and so moist ... changes made were sugar 1 cup white 1 cup brown, added 1 tsp ea. vanilla, cinnamon and baking powder, set oven at 325 and baked for 65 minutes.  I used my KitchenAide blender with whip hook to cream sugar and butter then added the vanilla and cinnamon, next went in the room temp eggs ...changed to mix hook then added bananas (used 6 that I had frozen after ripening, thawed then mashed).  Sift remaining dry ingredients and added slowly to wet mixture. I used Bakers Joy to spray on my 2 pyrex loaf pans. Afer baking for 50 minutes I checked on the little jewels then let go for another 12 to 15 minutes.  Could not wait for it to cool .... by far the best one I ever ate!

I agree this is the best Banana Nut Bread, very moist, smooth and a great banana flavor.  I freeze my bananas once they go brown in the skin. I accumilate several in a gallon baggie before using and when you one the top they slide right out and do not acculilate a lot of extra moisture.

Wonderful Recipe! Get compliments every time! Super moist and not too sweet. I'm asian and most American recipes seem to be just too sweet for the asian palate. This recipe is just nice.  I did add 1/2 tsp baking powder and substituted walnuts with pecans. I also baked it in pyrex loaf pans that are 8.5" x 4.5" to give it a more "breadish" dimension, instead of having it look too flat. Baked it a few times at different temperature and realized that when it is a little on the burnt side, it tastes better... so I just stuck with 350 F at 60 minutes... just nice!  Try it! You won't be sorry you used this recipe!

The walnuts are tasty and this is a good banana bread.  It's not my favorite, though, as it's a little greasy and over-sweet for my taste; kind of drowns out the banana.

Nice and moist.  Tasted great!  I added cinnamon and vanilla, but it would have been good without them too.  I baked at 325 because I used glass pans--took just over an hour till finished.

Wonderful Recipe!! I did modify it a tad. I used 2/3 cup brown sugar in place of some of the white. I creamed the butter and sugars together. Added in the eggs, and then the bananas. Then I mixed the dry ingredients slowly into the wet. After that was all mixed I blended in the nuts. The only thing I think I will do differently next time is set the oven to 325 instead of 350. The outside got a tiny bit too dark for my taste. I will totally make this again.

This has a wonderful flavor and great crust. I added freshly grated nutmeg and cinnamon and substituted half the sugar with brown sugar. A word of caution, I tried to make this as muffins and they cooked very quickly -- were in fact burned in just 25 minutes. I think this is best left as a bread as originally written.

followed the recommendations in Virginia Sista's review, and it was great!!  halved the recipe to just make one loaf, didn't add any nuts.  the crust on this is AMAZING!  buttery and brown!!  might have been since I only baked one loaf, but it only needed to bake about 55 minutes.

update 10/17 - I still love this recipe, it is my go to!  I have made my own variation.  First, I always use Kerrygold salted butter, the best, and second I use all brown sugar, no white (I always do this with cookie recipes too).  I love to rub the loaf pan with extra butter, then toss in 1 tablespoon white sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and coat the pan with that.  Gives the bread a great buttery crust!  Also, I always buy fresh cranberries in the fall, and keep a bag in my freezer, and this bread is so good loaded with fresh cranberries!  They burst while baking, and you have these little tart bits running through the sweet bread!

This one turned out AWESOME!!! I couldn't help but add a little extra banana. With mixing the dry/wet, I putmy Kitchenaid mixer on low, and slowly added the dry to the wet. It leaves no dry clumps and always leaves an even mixture. If you add wet to dry, the wet will encompass the dry, resulting in clumps.

This is the BEST!! I have made almost all Banana Nut Bread's on this site and this is my favorite. That said ...I did make some changes. I added vanilla and cinnamon, a tablespoon each. I changed the sugar amount, because I think this way is sweet enough..  3/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. 40 minutes in the oven did it for me. I sprinkled some nuts on top before putting it in .... just for "good looks"

Made this for best friend's birthday.  She said it is absolutely the best banana bread she had ever eaten.  I sprinkled the bread pans with a cinnamon/sugar mixture after greasing and then poured batter in.

I gave this recipe 5 stars with my changes. Instead of butter I used butter flavored crisco sticks.  I substitued 1 cup brown sugar, for 1 cup white sugar. Also added 2 tsp cinnamon and a tbsp of vanilla and I used 1/2 cup chopped pecans instead of the walnuts.

Recipe is great BUT I oly had 3 riped bananas so I had to get creative. I took a can of pinneaple chunks and crushed them in food processor. Wao at 1st I was not sure but it came out great because the pinneapple made it nice and moist and you couldn't taste the pinneaple at all, it just helped with texture. I also added 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of nutmeg. I did 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar.  The color and texture were beautiful, nothing like the recipe picture. Enjoy, I highly recomend this recipe. ooh before I forget, I roasted the walnuts and I think gave it a nice flavor.

This was pretty good, but defiantly lacking in flavor. If I were to make this again I'd add vanilla extract and cinnamon.  The directions are a little strange too. I suppose it would turn out okay if made as written but I creamed the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, added the eggs until well incorporated and stirred in the bananas (I didn't use nuts). Sift all the dry ingredients together, and add it in about 3 batches to the banana mixture. It came out fluffy and moist with a crusty top but not very flavorful.

this was a good recipe for BNB.  I love the fact that the recipe yields 2 loaves, because my old recipe only makes one loaf.  I'll definitely be making this again, except I'll use a smaller pan (the bread came out too rectangular, and I prefer mine more square).  Other than that, it was perfect.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe would have 5 stars if the review were based on taste alone.  Wow - the flavor of this banana bread is fantastic!!  After reading the reviews, I tweaked the recipe by adding 1/2 tsp of Baking powder, 1 tsp vanilla and exchanging 1 cup of the granulated sugar for dark brown.  Unfortunately, the center of my bread sank like the Titanic!  It was only about 3/4" thick in the center!  I have no idea why it would sink with the addition of the baking powder; I was thinking that should keep any of the rising problems at bay.  Anyway - if you don't mind possibly having funny looking bread, the taste is impeccable.  Give it a try!

MARVELOUS!! This was an exceptional recipe! I made it twice in the last week. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. And it was a little too greasy/buttery for me. So then the next time around I nixed 1/2 cup of butter and added chocolate chips.. OMGosh! Wonderful, everyone loved it and it will make a great gift for the holidays.

I made this last night and kept the recipe as is. I would not change a thing! It took very little time to make and I left it in the oven for about 65-70 minutes. That gave it a nice brown patina! I loved the taste--oh so moist too! I will keep this recipe around for those days I want some comfort food.

This was so good!  Thank you for such a great recipe.  I made some other changes as recommended by other reviewers.  I added 1 tso vanilla to wet ingredients, and added 1 tsp baking powder and 2 tsp cinnamon to the dry. Also used 1 cup packed brown sugar and only 1/2 cup white, for a total of 1 1/2 cups sugar.  I thought it was plenty sweet enough.  I creamed the butter and sugar, then added eggs one at a time, mixing after each.  Then I mixed in the mashed banana, and after that added the dry ingredients to the wet in three batches, scraping the sides after each.  I didn't use nuts, had none, and cooked for 45 minutes and it was perfect.    It was darker than in the picture, but did not affect the flavor at all.  AWESOME!!

Wow!  This is wonderful!  The smell in my house was so warm and inviting not to mention the flavor.  After eating it, the flavor just kind of stays in your mouth.  It's so comforting!!  My oven is pretty new so it cooks fast.  I cooked it at 350 for 30 min. and then 325 for 30 min.  The top got pretty brown but it's perfect!!  
Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe!

I have made this bread several times.  I've used the variations suggested by other reviewers and I've made it exactly as the recipe calls for.  This recipe is great no matter what you do.  I always do the one bowl method though - I use my stand mixer and cream the butter and sugar, then add the eggs one at a time, then the bananas, then the dry ingredients and finally the nuts.  Depending on humidity and altitude and whether I use brown sugar or not the cooking time varies from 45-70 minutes.  This bread makes a great gift if you have mini loaf pans.  I always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  This one is truly awesome and deserves more than 5 stars!!

The taste is amazing.  However it never really rises.  I LOVE the look of a bread that has a nice crown on tip.  This doesn't do that.  It's a very flat bread.  I used smart balance (out of regular butter) and added 1/2 t baking powder and vanilla.  I've tried making this as written and it doesn't seem to do much different.  Oh I also used 1/2 Brown sugar and 1/2 white.

I love this recipe, but I usually use the darker metal loaf pans, but recently my EBNB is getting burned on the outside, and not cooked in the inside.
I usually put chocolate chips in my EBNB.
I am wondering if I should be using clear glass loaf pan.  Has anyone had any success with the bread cooking in glass loaf pans?
Thanks in advance for advice.

After an extensive search through old family cookbooks,popular classic cookbooks, and the internet, I finally came across the perfect recipe for banana nut bread. Just scanning the list of ingredients made my spirits soar; I was sure that I was looking at a recipe that would yield the heavy, moist banana nut bread that I so longed for. I'm delighted to say that I was right. I've made this banana nut bread on four occassions and it came out perfectly each time. I baked it most recently in a bundt pan for 45 minutes(no change in temperature), my husband commented that this one was the best I had ever made. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!

I really hope someone reads this and it helps them because I ruined my first batch!  I set the timer for 55 and checked it every 5 minutes after that it took about 62 minutes to be perfect. You also need to add only HALF the salt (even less if you use salted butter) it asks for - it tasted salty as a potato chip! I used 2 medium-large bananas and they measured out to be one cup mashed. If you add too much banana you will get a funny texture and it doesn't cook in the middle. I am sticking with this revised recipe because it makes a super buttery, moist and delicious banana bread :)

actually 4.5.  This is a wonderful, moist BNB.  Friends just love it and ask for more.  I didnt feel like baking all the batter and put half in the refrigerator overnight and baked it the following evening.  It was better than the first batch!  MMMM good!

This was a delicious recipe! As other reviews have stated, I would mix the ingredients thoroughly, not stir them in as just stirring them in produces unmixed spots in the finished loaf - and it didn't rise as I would have liked... but it tasted excellent and was a huge hit!

I made this into muffins and did a crumb topping and was sooo good! I love how it is more dense and almost cake like. It is not mushy like most recipes. LOVED IT! Making it again today actually!

This is to die for! I make this all the time, with slight changes; I use 1/2 brown sugar and add loads of cinnamon and vanilla, plus some nutmeg. I also make a topping out of brown sugar, flour, butter, cinnamon and oatmeal, which really gives a nice crunch. EVERYONE loves this, even the picky kids. Stays good for days and freezes well - that is, if you manage to hide it. Absolutely delicious. Thank you!

I came back to change the original review I left back in October.  I halved the recipe last time and it came out dry and overdone, not moist and delicious like other reviewers raved.  But I made it again today because I had 8 bananas that were turning brown.  IT WAS WONDERFUL.  It was moist and delicious, and just spectacular.  I obviously calculated something wrong when I cut the recipe in half last time, because I followed it exactly this time, and it was the perfect bread.  I loved it!!!

This is so good even I like it (I don't usually like fruit bread recipes).  It tastes even better cold and has a really banana-ey taste that is addictive.  Like others, I used part whole grain flour. Thanks so much for the tasty recipe.

Yum!  This recipe is a definite keeper.  I never use nuts in my bread recipes, so I planned to substitute chocolate chips, but I made some without the chocolate chips just to see what it was like.  To my amazement, I actually prefer it without the chocolate (and I'm a die-hard chocolate lover)!  This bread tastes so good on its own that the chocolate just seems to interfere with the taste.  It has a very moist and buttery texture that I love (although it serves as a constant reminder of how unhealthy this stuff is).  After reading the reviews, I added a little vanilla (which probably didn't make much difference) and started checking for doneness after about 45 minutes in the oven (it was done a little early).

This is absolutely the best banana bread we've ever had! It's the first time I've made something that's better than my mom's!  The flavor is perfect, and the bread is so moist! I skipped the nuts and did 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white, with 1 tsp cinnamon.  Yum!

I've searched for a long time for a banana bread recipe that I liked.  I like really moist, dense, bread with a heavy banana flavor.  This recipe is the best! I will never need another one. I did add a teaspoon of vanilla to it, and made it with half white and half brown sugar, but it would be heavenly with just white sugar too.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. It is absolute banana bread heaven!

I love this recipe!!  I'm a college student and I make this for thanksgiving every year in my dorm.  EVERYBODY goes crazy for it!  I tend to add a lot of vanilla and cinnamon (2-3 tbsps).  Also, to make it in a pan (13x9), just follow the recipe and cook for ~30 min.  Make sure the bananas are very ripe for best flavor.  Frozen ones are ok too.

UNBELIEVABLY DELICIOUS!  I halved everything in the recipe, added about a tsp of vanilla, and used half white and half brown sugar.  Made 12 muffins (baked at 350F for about 20-25 minutes). They didn't get much of a crown on them, but the outer "crust" was soooo yummy (as was the inside!)

This is an excellent BNB!!!!!!  My husband loves BNB and he LOVED this recipe.  This has become a house hold favorite!  I did take the advice of others and added 1 teaspoon cinnamon and vanilla.  I also only cooked it for 50 mins at 350.  Thank you very much for the great recipe.

I adjusted the recipe as others suggested - 1/2 white and brown sugars and added a teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla. Yummy! I like this better than my previous banana bread recipe. Watch the cooking time. Mine was done in about 45-50 min. The recipe can also be halved easily which I did since I only had 1 cup of bananas.

I've made these twice now and both times they came out great!  The first time, I didn't have quite enough bananas so I added 1 cup of chocolate chips. I also used a mini-loaf pan (which makes 4) and it was a little too much batter. Therefore, they ran over a little on the top and burned.  Still excellent though, but I didn't want to rate them with my screw-ups.  Tried them again today and they are excellent, both with and without the screw-ups :) BTW, I used 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar both times.

I took the advice of many of the reviewers and made a few changes to this recipe. I added a generous teaspoon on vanilla, some chocolate chips in one loaf and a few dashes of cinnamon. I also cut the sugar down to 1-1/2 cups and mixed half white and half brown sugar. I inadvertantly used only half the butter that the recipe called for and it came out great. It does appear very dark but don't let that cause you to take it out early. One loaf cooked in 50 mins and the other with the chocolate chips cooked in 55 mins. It seems like a versatile enough recipe that you can change things to your liking without messing it up. It was still plenty sweet with less sugar. I think any more sugar would make it  unappealingly sweet for our tastes. And definately wait for it to cool for maximum taste. Happy baking!

This is excellent banana bread, I have made banana bread for the last 4 years trying one recipe after another looking for the one to keep and this is it. Sometimes I add pecans or walnuts and chocolate chips. This is the one I will make over and over. It's definitely a KEEPER !

Its very yummy! I tried to make it a little body friendly. I subsitute half cup of butter with a fine grated apple (looks about half cup). Used 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 7 packets of splenda (I don't like things too sweet). 3 eggs, yolks go in first. Whipped the white seperately till medium peak and fold in the batter. Added a dash of cinnamon and vanilla. Grabbed a handful of walnuts, chocolate chips and shredded coconuts. Unfortunately my husband only left me 2 large banana to work with, it yielded about 1 cup plus little more. Couldnt find my 9x5s used a bundt pan instead. Took me 1 hr and 30 mins to fully cook it.Extra bananas would definately be better.I gotta say... this is soooooo moist, not oily.  My friends literally inhaled it!!

Really good bread.  I halved the recipe and used 1/3 cup brown and 2/3 white sugar and added a small amount of vanilla.  I wasn't aware that the bread would get so brown though!  I took it out way too early and had to put it in again (which turned out fine) but I think the recipe should mention how dark it gets.

This was a very tasty banana bread that can still turn out great even with a few small adjustments. Since I only had 2 and a half bananas, I halved the recipe so I'd have enough banana flavor. I substituted 3/4 cup of brown sugar for the 1 cup of regular and it still came out plenty sweet. The flavor was very good, and the bread was perfectly done at 55 minutes in my oven.

What a great use for old bananas!  I thought this was very good.  Be sure to chill it after it bakes as the recipe suggests -- for some reason it improves the flavor.  Also, I only had a cup of mashed bananas so I halved the recipe, and it baked in about 40 minutes.  I will hang on to this recipe and use it again.

I was nervous when I was getting ready to put the dry ingredients in - it didn't look like it was going to be thick enough - but the whole thing turned out great!  It bakes up very dark on the outside which worried me, but turned out not to be a problem.  I put a dash of cinnamon and some vanilla as suggested, and some of the Hershey's cinnamon chips instead of nuts - mmmmm.  (PS - those are way hard to find - did they stop making them?)

My son loves this bread and it makes for a great breaksfast when you are crunched for time.  The first time I made it, I cut the recipe in half and the bread came out way too dense.  This last time, I used the recipe serving size and it is delicious!

WOW!! This is DELICIOUS!!!!!!!  I meant to half the recipe but screwed up on an ingredient and had to make 2 loaves.  Glad I did!!  I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon. Also, it didn't take as long--only 50 minutes. Husband loved it and I can't wait to share it with everyone!!  Thanks so much! :

Just wanted to say I tried the recipe and it is FABULOUS... she is not joking to say this bread is habit-forming.  I baked some for my co-workers and they all said they loved it and wanted to know where I got the recipe.  Thanks for submitting this, it will be in my recipe box to pass down to future generations of banana bread eaters!

Yum.  This was delicious.  Made some last night.  The bread did come out dark but there was absolutely nothing wrong with it.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla like the other viewers.  Made a loaf of bread and 12 muffins.  Had one muffin right out of the oven and then had another one the next morning.  I've gotta say leaving the muffin to cool just makes it yummier.  This will probably be something I'll make on a daily basis.

YUMMY!!! I followed the recipe exactly (except my baking time was just under 60 minutes).  I must admit that I was surprised at how dark the bread came out, but after tasting it, I was blown away.  Twenty minutes after I took it out of the oven, I ate three pieces.  This morning, I had it for breakfast.  It is 10 times better the next day.  I recommend letting it sit overnight (if you can resist temptation).  I'm supposed to give a loaf to my friends, but I don't know if it will last that long.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This really is the most delicious banana nut bread I've ever made.  I've made this recipe several times using butter flavored crisco instead of butter, but I just made it using real butter, and that makes all the difference.  Also, I add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and a little more banana and walnuts than the original recipe calls for.  I sprinkle the tops of mine with granulated sugar and pecans, and I only bake it for about 56 minutes.  I don't bother creaming my butter and sugar together, I just sift all the dry ingredients together and then fold the wet into the dry, and this seems to work really well.  I hope my tips help!  Good luck baking!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I like that it makes 2 breads.  Very moist and delicious.  I used light olive oil in place of the butter.  Will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks!

"this is the best banana bread you have ever made" said my husband.  i have to agree - this was amazing and so easy.  the only thing i did different was to roast the walnuts before adding to the batter.  i do have to add a #6 to the tips list - do not make right after having the flu and barely eating for 5 days - yep - that was me - my family doesn't know that this recipe made 2 loaves!!

I didn't change anything about this recipe and GLAD I didn't! I'm not a baker, this was my first banana nut bread. My best friend had made one from her grandmother's recipe that was well over a hundred years old it was ~delicious~but I didn't get the recipe from her and she's gone back up north. She is a Great Baker, so I started looking for a recipe that looked like her bread that I was just crazy addicted too. So I started looking for a recipe that would  resemble her bread. Needless to say this recipe tasted just like hers only better????

Going to tell a story on myself.  I followed the directions to the letter.  After popping the pans into the oven to bake, I was cleaning up.  I came across a bowl of flour and wondered where it came from.  I FORGOT TO ADD THE FLOUR!!  My "bread" had been baking for 15 minutes when I pulled it out of the oven.  My wife said "stir the flour in.  You have nothing to lose at this point."  It didn't rise as much as I thought it would but it was DELICIOUS.  Will definitely make again but will be sure to add all the ingredients.  I'm sure you figured out that I'm pretty new at this baking thing, but it was fun.

Great recipe! Very moist and flavorful.   Made as written.  Watch your baking time , mine were done much less than instructions. Both times I made this I had difficulty with releasing the loaves from the pans.  Next time I bake I'll put a piece of parchment on the very bottom.

Totally 5 stars!  I’ve tried many other recipes for Banana Nut Bread, but I’m tellin ya...this is the one!  I too used 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar.  It’s the perfect amount of batter for a bundt pan if you don’t have 2 loaf pans. Delish!

Hubby says it's very good. I am gluten-free so I am leaving it up to him for the rating.  I made the bread exactly (I don't believe in changing a recipe on the first try, not fair to do that and give a rating when changed) and he said it's very most and flavorful. It is a keeper. (Half the loaf is gone, and it wasn't even cool yet.)

Made this tonight and it's super good and moist. I did the half white sugar half brown sugar and added a touch of cinnamon, but otherwise, stuck with the recipe as is.  Very tasty and moist. Will keep this one.

I've made this several times. I've made it exactly like the recipe but I've also made adjustments over time. I add vanilla extract, cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. I omit the nuts and add dark chocolate chips instead. Also, I do not sift the dry ingredients. I add the dry ingredients to the wet in batches. It's always so good and doesn't stay around long.

I substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 cup of butter. It was really moist and very very good. I will definitely make it again!

I have made it three times.  The best was the last but ALL were excellent.  The first making, I used the larger 9X5 loaf pans.  The edges were too brown when the center was done.  The last making I used three 8X4 loaf pans.  They were done after 30 minutes with the center done.  The crust was lighter, the bread moister and tastier.  This is more of an adaptation to my  oven than a critique of the recipe as all three makings were short lived and delicious!
I did alter the procedure a little but did not change the mouth or the taste.  As a cake maker, I cream the butter and sugar, add the eggs, walnuts and mashed bananas.  Lastly, I added the sifted dry ingredients.  This doesn't change the taste at all but made the texture less coarse with about the same density.  I do think this prevents the dry flour lumps another rather mentioned.
Again, I am very pleased with all makings.

The best one I've ever made!  With all the sugar you might think it'll be super sweet, but it isn't.  As others had suggested,  added vanilla extract, cinnamon, and baking powder.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

a few changes to this, but its great as is. I use whole wheat flour for about a third of the total flour listed.  i also cream the butter and sugar before mixing in the rest of the wet ingredients. then slowly add the dry to the wet in batches stirring completely before each dry batch and making sure no clumps. i've always been taught to add the dry to the wet. it makes for a better consistency and rise.

Well  ,it turned out so good , and got eaten so fast, that I ripend   Green bananas in the oven so I could make it again . heheh ....I found no need nor desire to change  anything but pecans instead of walnuts. Its perfect !!!!!

This recipe is wonderful! Not cake.. a quick bread.. love it.  I was using a different recipe for more than 20 years and I've replaced it with this one.  If you want to change the recipe to add or subtract things then don't rate the recipe... create and post your own. Its insulting to the cook/chef/baker to rate them on your new creation... off soapbox

My first time making this and it turned out perfect.  I mixed the dry ingredients in a bowl, adding 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and the rest I mixed in the food processor, using 4 bananas and 3 eggs.(all I had)..  I slowly added the dry ingredients into the wet and it was all mixed so quickly and easily.  Baked 50-55 min.  The dark color may make you think its overcooked but it comes out perfect.  I froze one loaf and had to take it out a couple weeks later, it was so moist and fresh tasting still.  .

Addressing the review about changing the recipe 50%. The only reason we sub ingredients is because of dietary needs, hoping it will help if someone wants to try recipe but can not use those ingredients. How else are they going to know, if those of us who have tried it don't write about it. You are fortunate to be able to follow as written without making yourself and or family sick.

Well, that's it.  This will be my go-to banana bread recipe from now on.  It is excellent!  I added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. cinnamon.  Other than that, I made as directed.  Awesome!  When I greased the pan, I didn't flour it, but coated with cinnamon sugar instead (yum!)

I have made this recipe too many times to count over the past several years and it has turned out perfectly every time! And other than sometimes adding a bit of vanilla or cinnamon, I follow the recipe as written. 
The loaves might get a bit darker than a "golden" brown but they taste dense and moist and amazing!

This is the best banana bread I have ever had!  I had to reduce the temperature and it only took about 45 minutes and was still too dark on the outside but the taste and moistness inside was delightful!

The only change I made was using 1 tsp. baking soda instead of 2 tsp. otherwise, it falls in the middle. This change works for both high altitude and sea level.  It's the best, hands down, no questions asked banana bread recipe there is. I'm giving this recipe again, and again to people that I have baked for. Super easy and makes me feel like a real culinary genius! Haha... If they only knew how incredibly simple this is. Also, whenever I make this banana bread, I make about a dozen loaves and they never last more than 2 days! Crazy Good and Even more crazy that we can eat that much! Thank you, thank you to the creator for sharing this recipe. Dannielle, Mother of four

Amazing & moist. Only changes I made was adding another 1/2 cups of bananas, creaming the butter & sugar then mixing in the eggs one at time, after that I added the bananas, then walnuts, mixed all throughly, finishing with the flour.

FABULOUS! The only change I made was 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 1/2 cups white sugar and `/2 cup brown sugar. Oven set at 325 to start and then halfway through, upped it to 350. Used pecans and baked for 55 minutes. This bread is NOT a high riser, so check after an hour with a cake tester.

This recipe is described as a "very flexible" recipe, but it did not take well to baking in muffin tins for 20-25 minutes like most banana bread recipes do. If I had watched the video tips and noticed how very little rise this recipe has, I would not have tried it. The muffins actually sank into the tins!  The bottom of each muffin stuck to the tins despite greasing and flouring the tins. And the flavor that everyone is madly raving about? Salt and sugar. This is a very salty, cloyingly sweet banana nut bread. It was moist, and had a nice crunch to the top - for that, the recipe gets two stars. Otherwise it was a waste of good ingredients and I would not bake it again.

Awesome! I had some over ripe bananas that I didn't want to throw away, so I went looking for a recipe and found this little gem.  After reading the reviews, I cut the butter to 3/4 cup, and added a tsp each of cinnamon, baking powder, and nutmeg, and about a tsp and a half of vanilla. I couldn't help but add a few shakes of pumpkin pie and apple pie spice. I also substituted pecans for walnuts (since I didn't have any walnuts), and added raisins. It made enough for 24 muffins. I used 1 cup of white sugar, a 1/2 cup light brown sugar, and a 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar. I baked at 325° for 30-35 minutes. Like many others, mine didn't rise much, but the texture and flavor was perfect. I may add more baking powder next for more rise, but they are super yummy. Will make again! Thanks, OP, for a great recipe! :)

Fabulously dense and rich recipe. I'm not one for sweets, but my husband raves about it. I've had a few bites and know enough to praise the taste and texture. I always use pecans instead of walnuts. I add dry to wet ingredients and mix on medium low speed. The fourth time making it, due to what was on hand, I used 1.5 cups white sugar/.5 cup brown sugar, 1.5 cup bananas/.5 cup plain Greek yogurt. Came out wonderful. Good to know the recipe is top drawer even with minor modifications if you run short of ingredients. Thanks for sharing!

This is a fantastic recipe! I did follow others and used 1/2 white and 1/2 light brown sugar as well as added 2 tsp of vanilla and being the chocolate lover that I am added 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. Wow!!!

I have been making his recipe for the past 8 years, at least, and it is fantastic!  I have followed the recipe to the letter and have always been told how great the bread is.  I notice that many other reviewers add spices or baking powder to the bread, but it really is perfect as is!  The description, after all, does say that it is a dense bread.  Don't let that scare you off.  It is also the moistest banana nut bread I have ever had.  LOVE IT!!

I have tried several banana nut breads in the past but this is the only one I make now, it is simple and delicious.  The only thing I do different is add a splash of vanilla, I have made it numerous times and it always turns out perfect.  I once made french toast out of it for something different and it was a big hit with my coworkers.  

Update:  As my husband developed a gluten allergy in the last year I tried this with gluten free 1:1 flour, it may have been better than usual, not quite as heavy.  This is the best recipe ever!

This is a great recipe. I only used 1 cup sugar and used half cup olive oil and half cup unsweetened applesauce in place of the  shortening.  This time I baked it in mason jars at 325  for 50 minutes. It's is just as good as the loaf and you have  servings for one or two in each jar as well as cute gifts.   PS  There is one MAJOR problem with this recipe -- cannot stop eating it. LOL

I tried the recipe and it turned out AMAZING. The taste was good but it didn't rise. It even had the texture that I wanted. Does anyone know why this might happen? The only changes I made was I added a tsp of vanilla, did half and half with brown sugar and white.

I rarely leave a review but wanted to comment that this recipe, as bare bones as it appears, is absolutely perfect just as written.  It does not need any vanilla or cinnamon competing with the divine flavor of buttery nutty bananas.  The texture of these loaves really separate them from other recipes I have tried.  It truly is the best in my opinion.  I have made it many times and it is the only BNB I will ever make.  THANKS for sharing this recipe!!

I could only make one loaf because someone had eaten one of my bananas without telling me.  The way that person is eating up said loaf, I'm sure he's now regretting eating my ingredient.  I love it because the banana flavor is fresh, yet not overpowering.  I'll definitely make this again.

OMG, this recipe is fantastic.  I substituted half of the sugar with Coconut sugar, it added a lovely caramel flavour!  Definitely a winner.

Great recipe.  Just like others I added  white and brown sugar, tsp vanilla extract, tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp baking powder. I added dry into wet ingredient and mixed.  The best banana nut bread ever!  It disappeared quickly.

Yes. Amazing. Best recipe for banana nut bread I've found! Few changes: more rough chop walnuts, 1/2 sugar, 1/2 brown a sugar, 1 tsp extra baking soda. Line pans well with butter and flour and the crust will be amazing!

Used this recipe as my first attempt at banana nut bread. As my grandmother use to make it all the time but due to old age and Alzheimer's she is unable to be the woman she use to. But using this recipe and adding 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1tsp vanilla I think she would be quite proud.

This was a hit in my household. Instead of making two loaves, I used a cake bundt and the rest I was able to make 6 muffins. This was my first time making it and yes, I did give myself a pat on the back.

This is...THE BEST...banana bread I have ever made in my life. And I've tried quite a few recipes. It is EXACTLY like the banana bread every older, female member of my family made when I was a kid: thick and moist and sweet and very banana-y. Love it. LOVE IT.

Also, for reference, I followed the recipe exactly; I used six medium-size bananas to make 2 cups mashed; and in all the recipe made three 8X3 loaf pans. Kept one in the fridge and froze two, and can report they freeze and thaw perfectly.

This was a very pretty loaf of bread, but it didn't have quite enough flavor. Not sure how I could bump that up...maybe some extracts? 

It was almost overdone at 50 minutes of baking in dark non-stick pans. So, if your pans are like that, I would check it at 45-50 before letting it bake longer!

Loved this recipe. So moist! Good foundation. I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 cup oatmeal. I split the sugars 1 cup brown, one cup white, because I was short on white sugar. Also someone else suggested greasing the pan then powdering with cinnamon sugar. That was a delicious idea. Made a flavorful crust. 
I cut the oven heat to 300 degrees. And baked for 55 minutes.

Love this recipe.  Easy to make & delicious.  Like others who tweak the recipe a little, I used 1 cup applesauce instead of butter or margarine.  Delicious.

The flavor of the finished product is wonderful, but my loaves fell when they were almost done.  I used new baking soda and wonder if it needs some baking powder.  It wasn't pretty, but it was tasty!

AAAAAwesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This the first time I have ever left a review.  I have been cooking and baking since i was young nearly fifty now.  Use this site all the time but always end up changing the recipe so much it is hard to rate it with all my changes. Not this one perfect as written.  Although mine was done in 45 mins.  I have tried alot of other Banana Bread recipes from many different sources as well as this site.  They were all edible but nothing great.  Don't wast your time with other recipes this is a keeper !!!!!!

My secret banana bread that no one can resist! Of course I tweak a few things. - I split the sugar between white and brown, add 1tsp vanilla, 1tsp pumpkin spice, extra banana (I use 5)and sub pecans. Also only cook for 55 minutes... PERFECT. BTW, best cold keeps for weeks, and a great dessert warm topped with ice cream. :)

This bread is wonderful! As usual, I tweaked it a bit. I used 100% whole wheat flour. 1 1/2 cups sugar and an extra banana. Perfect!

Definitely a keeper! Was skeptical because I thought the butter was a huge amount and some reviews said it was a gooey mess. Not so! I have been looking for the perfect banana bread recipe and have tried several but this is the best! The only thing I changed is I added 1 teaspoon of allspice just because I wanted the extra flavour. I also used frozen sliced bananas that I get at a speciality store.  The bag is enough to make two batches so I am making more now. I also lowered the temperature to 325 and it took exactly 70 minutes to bake.  I usually burn, well, everything, so thought this was safer. Oh, and I did half white and hald brown sugar only because I had limited white on hand.

OH MY GOODNESS!!!  This is fabulous!  After reading other reviews, I have settled on these changes.  Use only 1tsp of baking soda.  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla baked at 325 for 60 minutes.  I've done this twice and it's come out perfect both times!  It's true, you DO have to HIDE it from yourself.  The best bet is make it and give it away!!!!!!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!

This is the best banana nut bread I have ever had!  This was my first attempt at baking from scratch and it was a big hit! My husband was drooling as I was mixing and even more so as it filled the house with its delicious fragrance. I made this recipe following the directions given by Virginia Sista.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract, pecans instead of walnuts, and cinnamon. I will be buying bananas soon and desperately waiting until the over ripen (paper bags help!).

I'm going to give this one 4 stars because the outcome could quite possibly be my mistake somewhere in preparing this. It was easy to make and the taste is not bad, but it didn't rise and it didn't taste as banana-like as I like in a banana nut bread. But it was still good tasting and perfect with coffee. :)

I always make a recipe as written. I only tweak it to my taste if it was good enough to make a second time and needs  more or less spices.
No tweaking here. Excellent! Just the two of us, therefore I simply cut the recipe in half and made one loaf. Should have made the two. Very moist, flavorful and probably the best banana nut bread I have ever made. 
Thank  you for sharing!

I've never had a bad banana bread and this was okay. Definitely not the best I've ever had.
I am a bit confused at most of the low ratings. I am not a baker but I never encountered the issues many were having. The bread wasn't flat. It was a bit greasier than I was used to but nothing off-putting. I used half white, half brown sugar and the bread did turn out really dark, but I don't see how that is a problem. It's not like it was burned. I like the sweetness. The edges were even good, almost caramelized.
I did think it lacked some flavor. Some of this would have been better if I had had the whole 1 cup of walnuts (the best part of any banana bread), but I was surprised that there weren't any spices in this recipe. I have never made a banana bread so I wasn't sure. One thing for sure, this bread requires no butter on it.
So, it's a good eat but I think I will try and get my stepmother's recipe if I make banana bread in the future.

Gluten-Free works! I used Bob's Red Mill All Purpose G-F Flour in the same quantity as called for here, and it worked well.  I am always working to reduce sugar; used Agave Nectar and 1/2 the quantity -- 1 cup. Loved it.  Am going to incorporate 1 tsp. baking powder next time as my loaves do not rise very much. The ebnb i have made wiyhout the baking powder fits nicely into one loaf pan. This recipe is excellent! And because it works well with G-F flour, i, too, can enjoy it with my family.  Oh, and I use Earth Balance dairy-free, soy-free "butter" as i have dairy allergies as well. It works! Thank You for a great recipe.

I've made it so many times so many ways! I have followed the recipe exactly, and there are times when I followed the reviews. The thing is brown sugar, or white, vanilla extract or none, cinnamon, or nutmeg, or nothing... it tastes terrific. In my house it is gone in no time. Thank you for sharing the recipe :)

Absolutely loved this recipe! This was my second attempt at a banana nut bread and I am so very pleased with the results! I followed it exactly without changing any ingredients at all. It did take longer to bake, but the bread still turned out so moist! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

SO GOOD! Based on other comments, I only used3/4 C butter, added a touch of vanilla, 1/2 C more banana,  cinnamon, and used half brown sugar half white. I suggest putting parchment paper on the bottom of the loaf pan.

This is HEAVENLY. YUM!

Giving it 4 stars but the taste was 5. Reason?  I changed it up a bit and it tasted much better. I replaced 1 of the cups of sugar with brown sugar, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla, and replaced walnuts with toasted pecans. My boyfriend said it was the most perfect banana bread he had ever had, and he is a banana bread snob!

I can't see how anyone could mess this up; it is easy and quick. I LOVE this recipe. It is absolutely delicious!! The only thing I did differently was add cinnamon and use 1 cup brown sugar/1 cup white sugar (because I prefer brown sugar). This recipe has NEVER failed me!! I am no professional but this recipe has always turned out perfect. LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!! Thank you for sharing!! (^-^)

It was the best in the world. I can't describe it other than amazing. You should try this recipe.  The only thing I added was a cup of chopped pecans which to me just makes banana bread complete.

Ok, so I couldn't find my "Nanny's recipe for banana nut bread so I went looking for a temporary replacement, hoping to find hers someother time. WOW... I've made it 3 times I believe and its a huge hit! I've made it with butter and oil both delicious! Made it with white and Brown sugar still delicious! Accidentally added 2 cups of nuts the first time I made it and it became my twist because my family went "nuts" for the nuts! Added an extra 1/4 cup of bananas cause that's what I had when I was done mashing most certainly still delicious! One time I was 1/2 cup short of ripe banana so added 1/2 apple sauce and you couldn't even tell, gotta love a recipe that's this flexible. Bread looked pretty dark when it was done but it was not burnt. The top was a little crispy but again was not burnt, I even enjoyed the texture change... However If u don't care for the crisp top, wrap it in plastic for a few hours if u can manage to wait that long. I still hope to find "Nanny's" recipe in her writing for heirloom reasons but this is the only banana nut bread recipe I need!

After searching the internet for a new banana nut bread recipe,and after eagerly reading most of the reviews, I decided  try this one. I added a tsp of baking powder and a tsp of vanilla as others had suggested and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. I also decreased the oven temp to 325 instead of 350. I cooked it for exactly 50 minutes and it was done. The taste is very good. It is moist and not dry at all. I am a little disappointed as I was looking for a more dense version and this is not as dense as I was led to believe. I would consider the texture and sweetness of this bread to be more like that of a "cake" than a bread. Over all, it is good, and was easy to make. It just wasn't exactly what I was looking for.

I made this two days ago and used one cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar and also added vanilla and cinnamon.  I also mixed my ingredients differently from the directions -- used a mixer to cream the butter and sugars; then added eggs, dry ingredients, and mashed bananas; lastly stirred in chopped nuts.  I think this works better than mixing by hand or stirring.  My whole house smelled wonderful the day I baked them and the next.  Very moist and flavorful and will definitely be making it again!

I am not a baker like my Grandma, who has perfected peanut brittle, ginger snaps, pumpkin roll and chocolate sheet cake to name a few!  I only had 2 round pie pans and I did half the batch without walnuts for my baby boy.  I used a whole cup of walnuts in just half the batter and it was perfect for us because we like it nutty!  4 large bananas mashed down to 2 cups.  Warning, do not add butter to your piece after baking, this recipe makes it so you don't need to!!!  I ate a piece fresh after baking, it was delicious!  My edges did end up too brown, but I assumed this would happen.  I have made this before with loaf pans and it was perfect then, too!  Do refrigerate to keep fresh, I did not and it made a difference.

Read the reviews first. Did half white, half brown sugar, teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla. Sifted the dry ingredients and creamed the sugar and butter, added the eggs and mixed them well, then the bananas, then added the dry ingredients. Baked at 325 for about 50 minutes but checked often.  Awesome!!

I have to write this! I wanted 3 loaves so I had it adjust the amt. of ingredients.. then I "tweaked" it the way I like it. It worked perfectly! Switched out smartblend for butter, 1 cup splenda and 1 cup dark brown sugar for all the white sugar, added cinnamon, cranberries and chopped walnuts.. oh yeah didnt want to use 6 eggs, so I used 5... still came out delicious. So what these loaves don't rise like regular breads- still the bomb...this is the most flexible recipe I have ever found. Enjoy :-)

OMG This is the BEST banana nut bread ever. I am not a banana nut bread lover but I had two large bananas that were too ripe to just peel and eat. I found this recipe and and tried it because of all the wonderful reviews. The only thing I added that wasn't in the recipe was 1t vanilla,1t cinnamon and used pecans instead of walnuts. I halved the recipe for I only had 2 bananas which when mashed was a heaping cup full. I foiled lined a bread pan(mine are old)and baked the bread for 55 minutes. I cannot describe how good this tasted, even for me. I WILL be baking a lot more of these breads in the future. It baked perfectly. You must try this recipe, you will not be disappointed. Thank you very much, saseigel. You did good!!!!

This is a toughie to rate.  Made just half the recipe for one loaf: Timer went off, knife came out clean, but after I let it sit a few minutes and it was time to take out of the loaf pan, the middle of the loaf came flying out onto my hand while the sides stayed in.  I greased and floured well so not sure why this happened.  When I made the batter, it looked VERY wet and heavy.  The middle was well cooked and delicious so my husband and I ate it anyway, but I was bummed not to have an actual loaf I could slice.

Awesome banana bread! It is plenty sweet so if you don't like it that way you could definitely cut the sugar some. I also recommend using real butter and creaming with the sugar. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white just out of personal preference. Thanks!

Will definitely be using this as a starter to my banana mut breads.  I reduced the recipe to make one loaf instead of two and it came out perfectly.  There were a couple of changes I made, that I will remember for next time: (1) I didn't bake for the 60-70 minutes but more like 40-50 (2) I used half white sugar and half light brown sugar (3) I like surprises in my banana breads, so I throw in an extra ingredient or two.  This time I made blueberry banana nut bread.  Next time, I will try adding coconut and pineapple, nutella or chocolate chips, or even pumpkin and spices for a fall version.  Message me if you have any other ideas!

Really great start to a banana recipe.  Definitely easy to follow!  Thanks!

Absolutely the best banana bread I have ever made or eaten.  This is the ONLY recipe i use anymore and get requests all of the time to make it.  I have given the recipe out so many times it's crazy.  I put everything into one big bowl and mix it together have NEVER had a single issue with this recipe it is truly fool-proof!

this is my new favorite and only recipe I will use in the future! so delicious.  I did follow some advice of others and added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp baking powder.  I cut the temp to 325 and only had to bake it for 45 minutes.  I had a slight cave in, in the center but not too bad.  I got 2 loaves and took one to work.  It was gone within 15 minutes!!!  They all asked when I would be making this again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good recipe. I also split between white and brown sugar. Added a little cinnamon and vanilla extract. 

It was excellent with coffee. I am tempted to go buy some old bananas from the store.

I made this as directed except I added 1 tsp. vanilla & 1/2 tsp. baking soda.  Also I baked it in a Bundt pan. My dh & I were really disappointed in the taste.  It was moist, but we thought it had little banana flavor.  I'll go back to my own recipe.

I was very excited about the great ingredients and I wasn't let down the recipe turned out fantastic.  But next time I have to change the baking time.  Maybe it was my oven but checked it at 60 min and it was starting to get too brown.  I will next time check the bread at 45-50min.

I made this recipe this morning just on a whim, and I was pleasantly surprised at the results.  It is a little dense for me, but the taste is very good, and it's much more moist than I expected it to be.  This is a keeper!

I have made this bread many times in the past and it turns out perfect for me every time, Tonight i made it in a bundt pan and topped it off with a glaze i found on another sight and it was over the top delicious! I took others suggestions and always make mine with 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar and add in a tsp of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon for flavor.

I accidentally left out the baking soda.  It was divine!!  Dense and addictive.  The crust was crunchy-chewy.  I ate a whole loaf before it had a chance to cool.  I will try that again!

Great recipe! Easy, yummy, I was so impressed I made it twice in one week! (because I, and my family, ate all of it so fast!). Here's the kicker - I burnt the bottom! I only had to cook mine for 30 minutes - I used a glass 9x13 casserole dish - as I didn't have a loaf pan handy. This change in dish altered the cooking time. Even though the bottom of the bread was 'slightly blackened' - I just sliced it off and served the perfectly uber moist, delicious remainder of the bread. It was /so/ good, that we didn't mind eating around the over toasted part. It's a keeper! Even burnt! Hah!

This is my first time trying this recipe. The batter was delicious, but the outcome, was horrific. We put it in ate 350, but it came out sank, and burnt. Is there a special way you do this? It did not work out for me, but even though the outside is burnt, it still tasted great!

I have never liked banana nut bread but I made this for my hubby that does.  He LOVED it and so do I. I made it again today.  It is awsome. I use pecans and add 1 tsp of cinnamin and vanilla.

This recipe is Awesome!!  It is moist, dense and has an amazing banana flavor.  My son told me to take it away from him because he wanted to eat the whole loaf in one sitting.  As for the directions...use your common sense.  Mix wet first, add dry and mix together.  Pour into pans and bake.  This is a very simple and easy recipe to make.

This was by far the best BANANA BREAD I have ever tasted.  It is actually the first banana bread i have ever cooked so that made it even more fabulous.  I did add a tsp vanilla and tsp of cinnamon as some of the other reviewers suggested.  Thanks for a delicious recipe !!

This banana bread was certainly tasty, but I don't think there's any reason to be so hysterical about it.  I tried this both warm and chilled; I think you can taste the banana better when it's cold. 

As an adult, I'm used to reduced-fat baking.  This bread tasted much like the kind of bread my family used to make when I was growing up.  So, again, it certainly was tasty, but the way the recipe is written you'd think SWAT teams would bust through my windows the second I cut it!! :)  

I added 1 tsp. each vanilla and cinnamon, though I didn't explicitly taste them in the finished product.  I baked for 60 minutes total (checking after 45 minutes) and needed to tent with foil because by 45 minutes the top was more than browned enough.

As other reviewers noted, this bread does not rise -- but it won't matter once you take a bite! YUM.  I did change the recipe a bit:  instead of white flour, I used 1 1/3 cups whole wheat & 2/3 cups quick oats; I used 1 cup white & 1 cup brown sugar, & added 1/2 t baking powder, 1 t vanilla & 1 t cinnamon.  Oh - also, used 1/2 cup butter & 1/2 a cup apple sauce instead of 1 cup butter.  Baked 4 small loaves for about 45-50 mins, and the leftover batter as mini-muffins for about 18 mins.  Also, sprinkled brown sugar & oats over the tops.

With moderate additions and substitutions, this has become a Saturday-night-only treat - cuz you gotta go to confession in the morning!

Like other people do:
add 1/2 tsp baking powder (total 2 1/2 tsp)
add 1 tsp cinnamon

Also:
add 1 tsp vanilla
add 2 tbs black rum (Goslings, etc)

Eggs: do not use 4 jumbo - use AA size.  If Jumbo, use only 3.

I pour into one single loaf pan and add 15 minutes baking time (total 75 minutes).

Great by itself.  Also good:  toasted with orange marmalade or cream cheese on top.  OR: Thinly sliced and layered with bannana cream pudding to make a sort-of torte.  Top with rum-laced whipped cream.  Chill couple hours before serving.

Mine came out very burnt :( it cooked for 50 mins and ended up quite dark. I do have an electric oven so maybe that's why. Even being almost black it's delish though!  Next time I will turn the temp down to325 and see if that helps.

I have tried so many recipies and this recipe over shines the rest. I had made this for high tea and got away with the most compliments ever. I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2 cups and it was perfect. Added cinnamon as recomended by one of the reviewers. It was light and not dense as many recipes I have tried. Sould follow the footnotes otherwise the cake will be done before you serve ;)

This is the only Banana Nut Bread recipe that I  use going on two plus years now. I'd altered it a little the other week by adding crasins (dried cranberries) and adding walnuts that are not so fine as I prefer them bigger than chopped up finely. Perfect dish for church or gifts.

This is THE best banana nut bread.  I made it a couple of weeks ago and it was all gone in a day.  Then used my old recipe and boy what a difference...my old recipe has been thrown away. This is the only recipe that I will use in the future.

Too good!

I used the recipe to make muffins. (shorten the cooking time if you do this). These are AMAZING...I just ate one to test the recipe (I'm not big on sweets). So delish... thanks SASEIGEL. 

I baked these for little grab 'n go breakfast bites for Hubby who has an 0'dark-thirty kinda job. 

The only thing I changed is I added 1/2 tsp of b. powder to make sure they'd rise. 

Thanks so much...a keeper!

This is the real deal folks.  A great banana nut loaf, requiring very few tweaks to make perfect.  I added 1tsp Vanilla Extract and it made the flavor perfect.  I also used my Kitchenaid mixer to incorporate all the ingredients.  It was just too difficult to do it by hand and I ended up with some unincorporated lumps of dry ingredients.  Put it in a mixer and let it do the work.  In any case, perfect flavor, perfect consistency and great moisture.  I would also be sure to watch cooking times closely.  The 1hr10min timeframe is way too long.  Mine were done in about 35 minutes.  Of course, that is probably dependent on the type of oven you have, but that was my experience.

I have tried many BNB recipes and this one by far is the bestest ever!  My theory is "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  As a result, I didn't add anything to this BNB recipe.  Didn't last very long as I have an open door policy in my kitchen and it never closes.   Bj Futrell, San Antonio, TX  5 stars

This gets top rating, though, I haven't tried it myself (not a fan of banana bread). The peeps at work loved it! I just wanted to try making it. The only changes I made to the recipe were: I halved everything, and only mashed up 1 large banana (I didn't bother measuring it). I had to adjust the temp down, slightly and just watched carefully to make sure it didn't burn. Still, great results (apparently) and I'll keep this recipe for future batches!

I'm not a baker but made this recipe during the Thanksgiving holiday and wow! was I hit with the family. They want me to make more for Christmas and since I'm on such a tight budget, I'm certainly going to give these as Christmas gifts. Directions were easy and recommend that you try this recipe once.Thank you SASEIGEL.

I made one batch with half regular sugar and half brown sugar.  I made another batch with 2 cups of white sugar.  Couldn't tell the difference.  Great recipe.  My son started eating it as soon as the 1st batch came out of the oven.    Everyone loves it.

OMG!!! THIS IS THE BEST BANANA  NUT BREAD EVER!!!!!!! like other's I revised it with 1cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. But I have tired both ways and both tasted great. No need to change the recipe its prefect! My mother who isn't a Banana Nut Bread Fan loves it. And everyone wants the receipe. Pay attention after 30minutes though because my stove cooked it fast! about 45mins. And its EXTREMELY ADDICTING!!!!! CAN EAT THE WHOLE PAN BY YOURSELF IF NOT CAREFUL. :)

I have made this several times and it is wonderful.  I substitute 1 stick of butter with applesauce to make it a bit less greasy.  It also freezes very well.

VERY good but I added, like I usually do. The bread came out moist, mildly spiced, and with a bit of zing from the cranberries. I usually do raisins (sultanas) but couldn't find my supply. I really think I prefer the cranberries. Overall I would have to mark this a 5 as a good base recipe for banana, zucchini or carrot bread or other variants.

This is the best banana bread I have ever had!!  Many of the other recipes I've tried have always been dry and not enough banana flavor.  This bread is super moist and has the best banana flavor and my husband can't get enough of it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Easy, moist cake, I used a bundt pan and chopped and additional 1/2 cup of walnuts to lay in the bottom of the pan prior to adding in the batter.  It made for a nice topping to the cake when I turned it out to a plate.

This is the BEST Banana Nut Bread recipe ever! I make it all the time and every time it comes out great! People love this and always ask for the recipe.  The only thing is that I have to bake it in the over for about 50-55 minutes, over that makes the edges burn.  So just keep an eye on the time clock.  I highly recommend this recipe as it is.  No need to change any of it!

I get rave reviews every time I make this bread. I omit the nuts out of personal preference, but otherwise follow the recipe. Using butter is preferable to margarine.

Great stuff! A big hit with me & my guys.  Followed the ingredient list almost exactly, except added 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1/8 tsp nutmeg.  Followed another reviewer's recommendation to assemble more traditionally:  cream butter & sugar, add eggs & vanilla & mix well, add dry ingredients 1/3 at a time, then fold in nuts.  Did not have loaf pans, so I made 12 cupcakes, baked 35 minutes and one 9" square pan, also baked 35 minutes. This one is a keeper!

It was good but a little on the sweet side.  Hard to find the bananas in the flavor.  I might suggest halving the  sugar.

So yummy!!!! My husband (who, BTW, does not get excited about my cooking very often. Ha!) said this is the best banana bread he's EVER had. :) I took the advice of others and substituted the 2 cups sugar for one cup white sugar, one cup brown sugar. I baked at 325 for 60 minutes (my oven cooks faster than normal) and it was perfect.

This is my go-to banana bread. It's more like cake than bread; an awesome comfort food. I also add vanilla, cinnamon. I love nutmeg, so I add a little of that too. As long as you don't mess around with the basic proportions, you can customize this recipe a lot.

AMAZING. I've made this several times following the recipe exactly. I've found its best to wrap in foil and let it sit. We usually eat one loaf and save the next for the second day. Its even more delicious the next day!

The BEST!  I followed the recipe to the letter, well I omitted the nuts (Granddaughter has nut alergies :().
My three Grandbabies (8-3 years of age) ate almost an entire loaf.  No need to customize, in my opinion.
Even better with nuts though.  Footnotes say it all. Thanks for sharing SASEIGEL.

Delicious! All my coworks and family loved this bread. I did want most others did by adding the 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp baking powder, and 1 tsp cinnamon. Watch your loaves around 45 minutes, that was perfect time for mine to cook.

This banana bread is DELICIOUS!  I made it twice already.  The first time I followed the directions exactly and and the flavor was gread but I found it to be too sweet and it didn't really rise.  
The second time I tweeked it just a little by decreasing the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added 1 tsp of baking powder (as suggested by others) and it was perfect! This is definitely a keeper!

I just decided to rate this after using this recipe since 2008.  It's great.  I just say that I have to shorten the cook time  as well as lower  the cook temp to about 325.  I love it. For the people who rated it low, make sure you are doing everything  correct  such as sifting as well as using  all purpose flour instead of self-rise.  This makes a big difference.

Delish!!  I made this with some of the changes suggested... And some of my own.
1st of all, I used whole wheat flour!!  YUMMMM!
I added the tsp of baking powder, 1tsp cinnamon, 1tsp of vanilla and used half brown sugar and half white sugar...I also added chocolate chips.  
I served this at my home fellowship meeting and am so glad I hid a few slices for us to have later... Love this stuff!!  :)

Absolutely delicious. I did add a little vanilla and cinnamon. I also used almonds instead of walnuts simply because they're the only nuts I'm really a fan of and it was a nice twist. I will almost definitely have to start making this in bulk because my family has been munching on it since it came out of the oven.

I'm a chef at a major university. This is a recipe I've made many times and have it memorized since it is the best banana bread recipe out there. I usually make it as a cake, using half white and half brown sugar, pecans and chocolate chips and I make a sweetened cream cheese icing to go with it. The icing I make tastes more like cream cheese than frosting so its not too sweet. I made the cake for some of my co-workers (others chefs and cooks)and everyone who tried it said it was the best banana anything they've ever had. One woman said she even dreamed about it that night and people talked about it all week. This is the perfect banana bread.

AMAZING recipe! My boyfriend and I could not stop eating the bread! Just as a note, 2 cups of mashed bananas is about 4 med-lar bananas. I would also say depending on how hot your oven gets, check the bread about 50 minutes into cooking. My oven gets extra hot, so it was done after about 55 minutes. It was actually a little overdone, but I LOVED the crunchy outside. This is going in the recipe box. I definitely will be making it again. I am actually looking forward to when my bananas over-ripen. I will not be throwing away any more! :)

I made it as is, no changes. No kidding. It WAS fabulous! Only problem is I can't stop eating it! The bread is moist, no need for butter and the outside is browned and perfect. Fantastic!

Yummy!   It was a big hit!   I did add 2/3cup more flour because the batter looked runny but, that's it.  My family and I loved it!

I loved this recipe, though I did change it up quite a bit based on other reviews.  I found the perfect baking time for me was 335 for 55 minutes.  If you want a slightly darker crust do it for 60 minutes.  In addition, I use 3/4 cups of white sugar and 3/4 cups of brown sugar.  Using 2 full cups was way too sweet for me.  I use 5-6 medium bananas.  Add 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1tsp vanilla.  I also add 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1tsp baking soda.  Helps the bread rise.  I also only use 1/2-3/4 cup of butter instead of the full cup.  Again, just preference.
Great foundation for the recipe, just needed a little tweaking.

O.k., I panicked. When I mixed everything it was real runny. So I added a scoop of flour, remembered a reviewer said they added baking powder. So I ended up putting in probaly a half cup more of flour, a small teaspoon of powder. I also added mexican vanilla. (My family's secret ingredient in everything!) I have one pan the size it called for, but I have two in glass. I hate cooking in glass, always turns out weird. But they were a gift from my sister so it's what I had! The loaves look REAL dark, but were not done in the middle. So I turned it down to 325* and baked them for 10 min more. I have yet to taste the finshed product, will update when I do! Smell gooooood! Batter was yummy too.

Tastes good and very easy, but for some reason mine turned out VERY dark brown (I thought it was burned) after only 60 minutes, and the middle was still not done!  The only change I made to the recipe was to half it (I only needed one loaf), and to use shortening instead of butter. I am baffled, and even double checked the recipe to make sure I didn't miss something...

This EBNB is awesomely rich. It gets a nice crisp crust because of the butter. We toast it in the toaster oven after it's been in the fridge and it tastes heavenly. I followed the recipe to the letter (except left out the nuts because my daughter won't eat them).

EXCELLENT!! I like others used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup light brown sugar, 1tsp cinnamon and 1tsp vanilla. FYI the brown sugar makes it look extra brown but it was cooked to perfection in 55 min. Just in case you're wondering like I was, 2 cups banana is about 4 whole bananas. I actually didn't even notice that it said 2 CUPS banana until after I baked it. I only used 2 whole bananas and while it was delicious this way it was even better with 2 more bananas.  I used pecans instead of walnuts. This is by far the most delicious EBNB I've ever had!!

This a really good. I had several bananas that needed to be baked so I double the recipie and added 1 teapson of cinnamon. Came out great. I have another that my family like a little better (has a crust on the top and sides that they adore but this one is a close second and will not leave you dissapointed. BTW...I am not sure why someone else posted what they did about it not rising because mine turned out fine. I only cooked my for 55 minutes at 350 degrees and it came out nice and done.

Awesome. I did as some other suggested and added cinnamon and I loved it. When  i took it out I let it cool for about 5 minutes before i turned it upside down and let it fall on aluminum foil. I take soft butter and let a little melt into the bread and the top of the bread before I wrap it and stick it in the fridge. the makes a very moist outside and adds flavor.

Great recipe! I gave it four stars because the cooking time is too long. Cooked at 325 for about 60 min and it was still a little too long. Next time I will try 45 or 50 min. Don't understand the "greasy blob" reviews... I also added 1 tsp of vanilla, baking powder, and cinnamon.

super simple to make.  since it makes 2 full loaves I made one full loaf plain and 3 minis.  i filled the minis with the plain batter and then mixed in walnuts in one, pecans in another, and chocolate chips in the last one.  It was a HUGE success.  Co workers loved it.  I didn't want to share!

I thought this was a very good recipe..best one i ever used..very moist and flavorful. i did make a few changes..i didn't measure banana's.i mashed 4/5 sm/med banana's.this probly was 3cup..i added 1/4 tes vanilla and 1/4 cinnamon,i used 1cup white and 1cup brown sugar. I covered with foil the last 20 min.( found it was getting to dark) and baked 60 min..and it came out great..other ovens will vary,so it's something you will.have to watch. this is defenitly a keeper recipe.

Recipe was great, bread comes out moist and you can taste the butter and banana. HOWEVER the cook time needs to be adjusted, I watched the loaf as it cooked, and 60-70 at 350 is way too long. Try 50 or 55 perhaps or reducing down to 325 when you have about 20 min left

This banana Nut bread is really good and I will make much more of this recipe but I gave it 4 stars because I have actually tasted better. I was disappointed because I expected the best banana bread I had ever eaten or at least as awesome as the banana nut bread I adored from my past. Thanks so much for this recipe. Next time I will take the advice of the other reviews.

I have made this twice within a couple of weeks, my husband just absolutely loves it.  I did substitute the walnuts with pecans, had those on hand & it was still awesome.  We're more pecan eaters than walnut eaters anyways.  On this last batch , I also sprinkled litely cinnamon, can't go wrong with a little cinnamon. Again it turned out super delicious !!!  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. Very Very moist

Bread turned out lovely. I cut the butter in half, used all brown sugar and it turned out very moist. I baked 2 small 9x5 loaves for 45 mins. at 335. I also added cinnamon, vanilla extra, raisins, and more banana than the recipe called for. Serve with yogurt or cream cheese, but it is divine plain too. My new pregnancy craving!

With all of the very positive reviews, I expected much more from this bread. I was extremely disappointed with how it turned out. I followed the recipe, and imo it tastes like you're eating a stick of butter with some sugar on it. :(  I might try it again, with less butter, but I imagine it will not be as moist (which is fine with me).

This is really a great recipe. Its definitely a heavy dessert but well worth it! I love how the sugar makes such a sweet brown crystalized crust. I put a little extra banana and walnuts in mine. We loved it! I'll definitely be makin this again soon.

SPOT ON! I made one loaf and approx. 14 muffins with this recipe. 1/2 the muffins I added vanilla, cinnamon, & nutmeg to just because I love those flavors with banana bread and they were SO GOOD but the ones I made following the recipe were just as great! Moist and delicious! This is now the ONLY banana bread recipe I will be using!! Thanks!!

Very good- mine caved in the middle, not sure why, did anyone else's do this? Besides that, it is yummy! I will def make again. Added tspn of vanilla and a few shakes of cinnamon per other reviewers suggestions. Used 3 bananas, didn't mash them, just threw them in the kitchenAid along with the wet ingredients. Bananas weren't even overripe, actually they were perfect for eating. May have to go get a slice right now!

I just made the best banana muffins of my life I think!  I will say I tweaked it a bit for what I had, but I think these would be great just as written. my main changes were that I used half butter flavored shortening and half sour cream for the fat, added a bit of vanilla, 3/4c white sugar & 3/4c dark brown, I added 1t baking powder.  I started with the eggs, added the sugars, shortening sour cream, then added the bananas without mashing, vanilla and then the dry ingredients and finally the nuts, all in my mixer, in that order and they came out yummy!  oh, and I cooked the muffins at 400 degrees for 15-18 min.  (and a real yummer that some in my family didn't even notice, but I thought was delicious- in one pan I mixed in a bit of rhubarb that I had diced, sugared and microwaved for a minute or so.  mmmmm.....)

This is  a great bread and very moist but I would like to know how not have it dark on the top of the bread.  It was soo good though. I might not use as much baking soda next time because me and my husband can taste it. Thank u for the recipe.

I'm very surprised that this recipe has gotten so many rave reviews. It tasted very bland to me and my family. I have several other recipes that have cinnamon and/or sour cream in them and they are much tastier. Sorry, but two stars is the very top for this one.

Tip number 1 in the footnotes section is SERIOUSLY invaluable advice. The bread is still on the cooling rack, but there is now only half a loaf left seeing as I'm trying to get work done in my kitchen, but the EBNB keeps beconing me to eat it! Supposedly it's better tomorrow, I just hope it lasts that long!  Absolutely awesome! Moist, banana nut perfection.  I made the following adjustments:  reduced to 12 servings ghee instead of butter 1 tbsp. vanilla 1/2 cup dark brown sugar 1/2 cup white sugar 2 cup banana 3/4 cup white flour 1/4 cup wheat flour 2/3 cup chopped walnut 5 tbsp. flax seeds  bake at 350 for 65 minutes  Also, I followed Virginia Sista's mixing instructions.  There's going to be a little banana bread competition later at my boyfriend's house, and I'm going into it pretty confident.

This was my first time baking bread.  I messed this one up.  After reading the reviews i added the vanilla and cinnamon.  Mine turned out burned on the outside and undercooked a bit on the inside.  I have no idea what went wrong.  The inside was good but not what i expected.

The best banana bread I've ever made!  It could use a touch more flour - say 1/4 to 1/2 cup, and I did add some vanilla extract.  It didn't rise much in the oven (I'm at 5,000 ft. above sea level) but the flavor is awesome!

It was very good (never made Banana Nut Bread before) but I should have read the reviews first.  I baked for 55 min and it was too long.  The middle was still moist, but the outside was kind of hard.  Had a great flavor though.  Next time I will cook it for 50 min at 325 and see what happens.

This is so good!!! My family loves it. I followed Virginia Sista's advice and oh, yummy!!! We don't like nuts and it is still to die for. I have made this twice and it is gone within days and there is only 3 of us. This is a keeper!

This is truly the best banana nut bread ever. I make it with all brown sugar and it's now my standard for holiday baked goods gifting. I even wrap it in wax paper and then foil, freeze it solid, package it in an airtight container and ship it to out of state family to enjoy. It's thawed and delicious on arrival. Just have them store it in the fridge upon receipt since it would have been made several days before. Delicious microwaved before eating. Rave reviews! Thanks for such a terrific recipe.

I love banana nut bread, but this is the first one I have  ever made.  I had several browned bananas that needed to be used.  I made 2 changes.  The first change was to follow several of the other comments and used one cup white sugar and one cup dark brown sugar.  My second change is that I did not have any baking soda so I used SELF-RISING FLOUR.  It made the bread a little lighter and fluffier, but not too much.  If you like more dense BNB then use the all-purpose flour.  The bread is very good, but I think it could use a little more flavor.  I will make this recipe again and use more bananas and either cinnamon or all spice like others have suggested.

This recipe is awesome!!! It is very easy to make and very tasty. I am very bad at baking, but this recipe still came out good. I completely credit it to the simplicity of the ingredients and ease of making.

I made this recipe because it was a basic one.  I ended up making several of them for xmas gifts.  My husband who does a lot of critizing all the time was blown away at how wonderful it tasted.  This was the absolute most delicious banana bread we ever ever ate. This recipe is the one to keep.

The flavor was all there!  BUT, at 45 minutes the outside of the cake was already starting to burn (I used 2 standard bread pans).  And for some reason the middle of my cake didn't set very well and kind of sunk in... can anyone tell me what I did wrong?  With one of the batches, I added some semisweet chocolate chips - try it if you're a chocoholic like me!

This is really good bread.  but the cooking time is way to long. I only had to bake mine for 50 min. and it still was a little over cooked.  60 to 70 like the recipe states is way to long.

This is a wonderful recipe! This recipe actually lived up to it's description! The only thing I changed was the sugar. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup Light brown sugar. I like other reviewers used 2tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla, but also added a snack size box of raisins as this is how I grew up on Banana nut bread. It only took 55 min to bake, I used smaller loaf pans and got three loafs out of this recipe. If you have a newer oven definitely check on your BNB at the 55min mark. I love this recipe and can not wait to share it with friends and family, or maybe not. :>

This was an amazing recipe for banana nut bread!  The smell emanating from the kitchen has been to die for for the past 2 hours.    I didn't have enough ingredients so I cut the recipe in half but it didn't hurt it at all.    I will definitely be making this version again and see no need to try and find another recipe for banana bread!  Thanks so much!!!

Excellent recipe, only made a few changes, as other reviewers.  Did cream butter and sugar and added the eggs one at a time and mixed after each addition.  Mixed the mashed bananas to wet mixture.  Added the dry ingredients in three batches and added in the nuts.  Cooked 50 minutes and they were perfect!!!

i made my own healthy banana bread and my family also wanted banana bread so i made them this. it didn't rise up very much like the recipe i used for myself and i didn't taste it but everyone said it was really good, my mother thought it was a bit overly sweet though.5 for simplicity and 4 for taste.

I followed the recipe exactly. My bread did not rise very well. It did not have much of a flavor except butter. It's moist, but not very good. Thanks for sharing, though.

I just made this and it is really good.  I added a little extra banana.  It did sink in the middle but that could be my fault.  It didn't sink until I pulled it out to check it.  When it shook it collapsed.  I did use pecans instead of walnuts but that is just my preference.  Be sure and watch it while you are cooking it I only left it in for about 40 to 45 minutes and it was already done.

This recipe turned out great.  I did make a couple of changes.  I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and did a 3:1 ratio of brown and white sugar.  These gave the bread a nice darker color.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the wet ingredients and 3/4 cup of oatmeal to the dry mix.  I reduced the amount of baking soda to just 1 teaspoon because I like a slightly denser bread.  That is just personal preference.  I baked the loaves only about 50-55 minutes, but that is something that you have to gauge yourself.  I would start checking after 45 minutes so that you don't overbake it.  It turned out great.  The oats and the nuts gave it a nice crunchiness.  This was my first time making banana nut bread.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I make this recipe often but do change a few things to make it the best recipe ever. I add 4 bananas instead of just the one cup. I also add 1 cup of white chocoalte chips and 1 cup of milk chocolate chips. It never lasts long in this house as people stop by to pick some up when they know I have baked it.

I made this bread just the way the recipe is written.  This bread is fabulous.  I am not a big banana nut bread lover - I was making it for my son-in-law - I just had to taste because it looked so good.  It is great!!!! I highly recommend this recipe.

This banana bread was very tasty, I added just slightly more than 2 cups banana's. And oddly enough, I only made one loaf with this recipe, one normal sized loaf. So I wouldn't say that it makes two unless they're really tiny.  OH and I did a little research amd found that baking soda shouldn't be used in recipes that require long bake times because the chemical reaction that occurs when you use b. soda happens immediately after you add it so it must be cooked quickly. That could be why some people report unleavened breads. At the same time that could be what helps the density of this bread, i would add that extra tsp of baking powder, or even substitute one tsp of soda for powder.

I did follow the advise of the first & third reviews - I blended as directed in review one, adding 1 tsp vanilla & 2 tsp of cinnamon as suggested there - I also added 1/2 tsp of baking powder as suggested in review 3. I didn't have any brown sugar handy, but it wasn't neccesary...  OMG! I actually ate two loaves of 'EBNB' in less than a week. There wasn't enough for friends! Save this recipe as noted - and you will be a very plump happy camper!

This was excellent. Recipes this good go into my hand written recipe box. I did add the tsp cin. + vanilla like others suggested. I also bake in a cake pan instead and it came out just fine! Terrific recipe, thank you!!

Delicious! Only thing I did differently is instead of letting it cool completely, I left the outside to cool while the inside was still warm. That's when I wrapped it up in foil and refrigerated it. My husband and I had quite a few slices for breakfast; he even took some to work!   I will try Star_Raven's suggestion to coat my pan in the cinnamon and sugar!

This recipe is now in my personal recipe book. I've already made it 4 times, and it just keeps getting better. The only thing I added was 1/2 tsp vanilla and a couple sprinkles of cinnamon to the mix. Perfect!

This banana bread is INCREDIBLE!  I took the advice of some reviews and I add 1 tsp each of vanilla and allspice, and I also use half white and half light brown sugar.  The results are out of this world!  It really is super super moist if it is refrigerated for a few hours.  I make 2 loaves a week for my boyfriend - thank god he can eat anything and not gain weight!  This bread has made me the talk of the town!

I have made this over and over again. I always cream the butter and sugar. (using a KitchenAide) I do use pecans, but that's the only change I made. This is my "go to " recipe...it is very good and NEVER lasts! I'm making it today for a friend...I'll keep one loaf and give the other away. It's really the only way to keep from eating both loaves in very quick succession!

I made this for Father's Day and it was good. The edges were hard, but the inside was really moist and delicious. I only baked it for 50 minutes and that was too long. Next time I will add more seasonings to boost the flavor.

I've used this recipe for 2 years now. It's the best recipe - no changes or alterations. I do make sure I have enough - between my husband, myself, our children and the neighbors and their children - it goes super fast!!! But the taste is wonder and it's a super easy recipe to follow.

This Banana Bread is AMAZING. The only things that I like to add are 1tsp Vanilla extract, & a dash of nutmeg, ground cloves & cinnamon.   The only reason I coudln't give this 5 stars is because the baking times are WAY off. I've made this more than once, and it only needs 45 minutes to bake. My oven is quite accurate & thankfully I thought to check this before the 60 minutes had passed or they would have been burnt for sure.... so beware of over cooking the loafs!  Other than that though, this recipe is FABULOUS & one I plan to use over & over again.

I was really disappointed in this recipe after the great reviews.  First, it did not rise right.  I made muffins and the batter spread all over then sank in the middle.  I do live at high altitude, so that may be part of the problem.  Also, the butter taste was overwhelming.  Other people commented on this, and I thought, how can a butter taste be bad?  Well, now I know.  I felt like I was eating a greasy butter muffin instead of a moist banana muffin.  I won't be making this recipe again.

WOW! This recipe is AMAZING! I have made it twice in three days. Both times it turned out GREAT! I cut the batch in half for just one loaf, baked for 60 minutes and it was perfect, just as written. Thanks!!!

A little patience goes a long way with this recipe. With my gas oven it takes about an hour to bake. I cut down on the baking soda, which keeps it a little more dense. Which is the way I like it. Be careful though, DO NOT use the very course coffee sugar, unless you like your bread a little crunchy. If you want to try something different with this recipe, try these two things. 1) don't mash the bananas, just slice them and add them as you mix it all up. 2) Add a teaspoon of ground nutmeg. Believe me, it takes it to a whole new level.

Eating this as I type! This bread is delicious. I halved the recipe and only made one loaf, I know it's going to go fast. I used a 1/2 cup splenda and about a 1/2 cup brown sugar. I didn't have nuts so I added a handful of chocolate chips and a handful of oatmeal!! YUM YUM! Mine also only needed to cook for about 40 minutes.

EBNB SCORES!!!!! We have made your recipe three times, right now as we speak and its a winner every time.  I have added 2 tsps of Mexican vanilla but your recipe is buttery, nutty, banana-ree and GONE! Out of all the recipes in the world I'm glad I found yours.

This is a delicious banana bread I've ever baked. Just added 2 tbsp of sourcream and 2 cups of choc chips. I increased flour to 2 1/4 cups...half the recipe was gone when my husband saw it! Thanks Saseigel :)

First tried this recipe during a study abroad year, when another friend and I were craving banana bread and when I made it for my family and friends after coming back, it immediately became a family favorite. Really easy to make, perfectly moist and wonderfully banana-walnut flavor! Definitely recommend this one! It also freezes really well, just take it out of the freezer the night before and in the morning you have fresh banana bread for breakfast. Yum!

It's a good recipe, however, another 1/2 cup of mashed banana makes it even better.  I also added vanilla & sprinkled some additional walnuts on the top before baking.  Nive...very nice!

AWESOME!!  This was the 1st time I made banana bread and I am so glad I chose this recipe.  I used pecans instead of walnuts and 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar.  Everyone loved this recipe.  I made muffins and baked for about 18 minutes and they came out perfect.  YUMMY!  But they are very addicting!

Delicious banana nut bread.  Didn't have walnuts, but it didn't matter.  Great texture and banana flavor.  I think my hubby and I may have eaten the whole loaf within 24 hours, whoops.

OMGoodness, this recipe is awesome. I also made muffins with this recipe and they cooked in about 8 minutes. In addition, I used half brown sugar and half white sugar + 1 tsp of vanilla. As the writer states DO not taste before your serve. If you do, you will be reluctant to stop eating!

Oh my...this is the best tasting banana nut bread i've ever made.  My family ate it piping hot out of the oven and finished a whole loaf within an hour!!!I too made some adjustments which just made it taste even beeter...I added 2t vanilla, 1/2t baking powder, and 1 t allspice...delicious!!! Also, after reading another review...I beat the eggs intil they were foamy and then added to the butter and sugar, this seemed to help with the rising.  My family requested that I make more the next day, and my son refuses to let me give any away :o)  Definitely the best recipe ever!!!

Haven't tasted yet, but they look awful! I used mini pans since I wanted to give them away. They rose up very nicely and got brown quickly. I did cook shorter time than called for b/c I was using smaller pans. With toothpick test, they were done, but after taking them out of oven, the centers have fallen/sunk in completely. Not sure what I will try differently next time or if there will be a next time!

Everyone who tasted this LOVED it. It was probably the most well-received of all the banana breads I've tried; my only contention was its high fat content. The bananas add so much moisture on their own, I have found lower-fat recipes to be almost as good.

Oh My Goodness!! Thanks to this recipe, I am now called the Goddess of Banana Bread in my house!! (I have to admit, I almost made a critical error in tasting the batter before I slid the loaves into the oven, but my enormous amount of will power finally prevailed!) The only thing I did to change the recipe was to do as suggested, I added 1tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. baking powder, and 1 tsp. vanilla.  My family loves me! Thanks for this delicious recipe!

Awesome outcome. I swapped one cup of white sugar for brown sugar and added one tablespoon of cinnamon. I made mini-loafs (5 per recipe). AND, I tossed my 20 year old banana bread recipe away and put this one in its place ! !

Everyone wants this recipe! I add 1 tsp. vanilla and 2 tsp cinnamon to the dry mixture and I throw in a handful of raisins or chopped frozen cranberries or blueberries. I work in an office of 7-8 and I always take a whole loaf (1/2 the recipe) to work and it's gone in an hour. VERY moist. Great with spreadable cream cheese if you want to throw caution to the wind!

I was desperately looking for a receipe for Banana Bread. I've gotten the best Banana Bread in the whole wide world. It's just fantastic. All of my friends and colleagues here in Germany love it. It's easy to bake even for somebody who has such little experience in baking like me. Thank you for posting this receipe :-)

Real Crowd pleaser!
I added the 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp baking powder suggested by others,substituted a cup of brown sugar for the white sugar and used 2 whole eggs and 2 egg whites.  I would also suggest if you want non-dairy, super moist bread, use half a cup of oil (I used olive) and half a cup of applesauce (I used natural, but sweetened works too).  It may take a few extra minutes to bake, but the bread doesn't dry out as much.

OH MY GOSH!!!
This is the best ever banana nut bread.  I can't stop making it.  My relatives beg for the recipe.  My neighbor came and stole it off my counter.  (It's ok, we are great friends) All my friends love it and want the recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing this most moist and delicious recipe. Sorry though, I can't thank you for the extra pounds I gained when I first began making your recipe. Hehehe

I made no changes to this recipe. Super easy, only took me about ten minutes and that included cleanup. 

Probably one of the better banana bread recipes I've found on this site. Really rich. I wouldn't make it very often not only because of the fat content but because it IS addictive.

This would make great Christmas gift bread.

Warning!! Highly addicting! I only made a few changes I added 2 tsp of vanilla , and 1 tsp of almond extract.  1/2 white 1/2 brown sugar and then 1/2 walnuts 1/2 pecans. And baked it for only 55 mins It came out perfect. Everyone will enjoy.  And dont worry abt the calories we are all entitled to endulge once in awhile. Enjoy!!!

My neighbor made this & I could have eaten the whole loaf!  I rarely leave reviews, this one was worth the time.  My grandmother made the BEST banana bread.  Her's was called Hawaiian Banana Bread supposedly from the White House.  This recipe is the first time in over 40 years I have a recipe AS good AS my grandmothers.  Though it is not the same recipe it sure tasted every bit as good.  Excellent!

Out of the many banana bread recipe that I've used in the past, this one takes the cake.  It was by far the most flavorful and delicious.  I substituted one cup of white sugar for brown sugar, added a tsp of vanilla extract, and used pecans instead of walnuts because I didn't have any.  I also used a bundt cake pan instead of bread pans which worked great, I just reduced the temperature of the oven a little and kept it in for 10-15 minutes longer, keeping an eye on it.  I just made this yesterday and already it's almost gone.  It toasts in the toaster beautifully but is just as good untoasted.  Excellent banana bread!!

This receipe is a hit!!! Everyone who's has tasted it wants the receipe.  I do prefer to replace one of the two cups of granulated sugar with 1 cup of brown sugar.  I have also added vanilla and spice to some of the batches I made.  Either way, it's wonderful!!

This is the BEST banana bread recipe I have ever made.  EXCELLENT!  The house smelled so good with this bread baking!  I was not a huge fan of Banana Nut Bread, but I had ripe bananas and did not want to throw them out. I will definitely make this bread again.  The texture is wonderful.  I followed other readers advice and added  cinnamon, vanilla and baking powder and reduced the oven temperature to 325 which was a good thing as my bread baked in less than an hour.  I can't wait to make this again!

I made this without changing a thing.  About halfway through, it had fallen in and smelled like it was burning so I pulled it out.  I ate it anyways and it tasted pretty good so I tried it again adding baking powder as some suggested - with the same results.  Does anyone know why this is happening?

Loved it!
I was worried about using half the flour of my normal recipe, but this was great. Now I almost discourage my kids from eating bananas so that they can get overripe for this recipe!

Oh My Goodness!  Ok, it took trying about 6 recipes from various websites and THIS IS THE ONE!! Stop the bus, this gal got it right! Only variation I made was to add a little extra bananna by accident, but it worked out great.Also, I added 2/3C sour cream. I do this to all of my quick breads and it makes them sooooo moist. Oh so bananna-y yumalicious bread! Thanks for the winner!*dont use margarine, go for the butter*

Oh My Gosh! This is the absolute best and I have been making banana nut bread for over 50 years. It's nice that the recipe makes two loaves. As long as the oven is on for 1 hour, might as well make two. My bread is a bit on the dark side, which is fine as the bananas were tossed into the freezer with the peels on for a few weeks. I also used 2 cups of walnuts. 1 cup of butter seemed like a lot so next time I will use 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup apple butter. The texture was perfectly moist, firm and baked in the exact time suggested. I did line the bread pans with waxed paper which allowed for easy removal. Nice large loaves too.

This recipe was Fantabulous!!!  I altered it a bit by adding a dash of vanilla, using 3 cups of banana instead of 2...(I like a very VERY banana flavored bread) and dur to teh extra moisture, I added about 1/4 cup more flour. I baked it in four mini-loafs at 325 for one hour!!!!  So yummy!!!  Oh, per my kids, I omitted the nuts!

I was asked for this recipie from 3 people who tasted it.  The 4 dozen muffins that I brought to work were gone in minutes. It is rich and buttery.  Extreme is an apt description.  A real winner with my co-workers.

Upon reading the reviews of people, this is the one I chose to do.  I used 4 bananas.  This is the very BEST banana bread I ever made.  One whole loaf was gone before I turned around.  It is almost like Lays Potato chips....you can't eat just one.
I chose also to use 1 cup sugar, and 1 cup brown sugar.   Turned out to be a great combination.

The recipe turned out great. I took the warnings of the loaf not rising and added 1 teaspoon of baking powder and that seemed to do the trick pretty well. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon which compliments the flavor nicely.

I've only made banana nut bread once before and it pales in comparison to this recipe. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I added 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp vanilla butter and nut flavor and cinnamon. I also mixed eggs and butter separately, then added to all dry ingredients, then added mashed bananas and nuts last. It was FANTASTIC! My finicky 3 year old loved it and my 13 year old thought it was great too. Very moist, perfectly sweet...delicious. I will be making this again very soon!!!

Made as is and it's wonderful!! Even my Banana-nut-bread-hating husband ate half the loaf! We'll be using this recipe from now on. Of course, I'll have to hide some of it now from my husband so I get some! HaHa! Thanks for a great recipe!

Finally tried this recipe.  
All I can say is AWESOME.
I omitted the nuts, used 4 very ripe bananas (measured out at about 2 1/4 cups) but changed nothing else.
Very, very good!  SO moist and delicious!
The house smelled wonderful afterwards....I can't wait until I have some free time and a few over ripe bananas to make this again!
Thanks for the super recipe!

Excellent recipe!! Like others, I added one tsp. of vanilla extract and cooked on 350 for about 45-50 mins. After the bread cooled, I also whipped up some cream cheese frosting and applied to the bread. It was so YUMMY. Bread was great w/out frosting as well but we like our cream cheese frosting around here! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe :)

This bread is incredible... very sweet, but incredible.  Also very moist.  Definitely be sure to wrap it in foil as it's cooling to hold in the moisture.  I added more nuts.  I will definitely be making it again.

This was just okay.  It's tasty, yes, but nothing phenomenal. I bake well, and I followed the recipe to a T, but found that it didn't rise much and was done and nearly burned way before the timer went off.  It has good flavor, but no better than other recipes I've tried.

Previous poster :  Did u use real butter or margarine not "spread"? Sometimes what makes a cook a "bad" cook are the products they use. Quality products produce quality foods.  If u skimp, it will taste like it. Try the recipe using real butter and exact measurements and see if it turns out better for you.

I make this bread every year for Christmas. No one in my family can ever get enough of it. The only thing that I do differently is put in a bit of vanilla and only cook it for about 50-55 minutes, otherwise it is a bit too dark. I always have fun making this bread. I hope that you all will enjoy it as much as my family does.

It is perfect! made it 3 times everytime...everyone loves it!

***Update.. I've made this soo many times. I find that by adding a pinch of baking powder and mixing this in without a mixer (yes by hand)and it comes out with the best texture...worth the extra work. I also seperate and beat the egg whites to fold in last. Also, if I feel that I want to cut down on the butteriness I cut the butter to 1/2c and use 1/2 of oil instead. I still love this recipe...and so does my roommate who is has a deathly irrational fear of bananas.. lol. He likes it so much that he asks me to make it but will refuses to acknowledge what its made of. Also, its always gone within a day or two.

To up the ante on this, instead of using flour to line the pan use a cinnamon/sugar mixture. Try it once and you'll never go back to flour again. OMG this is the absolute BEST!!!!! Every time I even suggest making this, people start coming out of the wood works asking for a loaf. I once had to make 20 loafs in one day (that was fun) and they were all gone in before they could cool. :) Very easy to make and ohhhh sooooo goooooood. If you want to fall in love with Banana Nut Bread make this one!!!!

I froze a few bananas last month and used them on the recipe. I defrosted the bananas and mixed them with a few other ripe ones. It worked perfect. I made 5 small loaves and cooked them about 50 minutes. Great recipe. Patsy

I have looked for a good BNB recipe for years.  It seems every one I ever tried was dry and tough.  I told my daughter, this is the last time I am going to try making BNB if this recipe is not good.  I am extremely pleased to say this is now going into my recipe box as the best Banana Nut Bread EVER!

After reading reviews about this bread being too greasy, I used half butter and half applesauce.  It was still plenty rich.  I added some vanilla, used half brown and half white sugar, and also used half ww flour and half all purpose flour.  I made half of the recipe since I only had two bananas and made two mini loaves.  With one loaf, I added a generous handful of chopped pecans.  The loaf with and the laof without nuts were both very good.  My three small children loved it--I'll make it again!

This did not work out for me.  It was way overdone well before the timer went off (usually I have the opposite problem, so don't think it was my oven).  It was also much greasier than I expected.  Definitely not a worthwhile use of a whole cup of butter!  There was no way could I take it to work for treat day.

I make banana bread a lot.  I have never really found a recipe that I can say "this is the best I have ever tasted!!"  I can now say I have found THE BANANA BREAD RECIPE.  I made sure my banana were near black.  I pureed them with my mixer.  My ingredients were at room temperature.  I made sure all my ingredients were well mixed like the recipe calls.  I dont like a dome on my bread so I only grease the bottoms of my pans.  This allows the bread to crawl up the sides.  I let the bread sit about 5 min after cooking time and assuring it was done, then I took a knife and made sure the bread was loose from the sides of the pan.  I let is completely cooled... Of course not before having several samples... Darn this was great banana bread and very easy to make.

muy delicioso! Tweaked a few ingredients though...I added one jar of Gerbers Banana baby food I KID YOU NOT! they are perfect for banana bread because they are ripe and pureed..it made my bread so soft and moist (I was able to reduce the butter content by almost half because of this step. As well used half butter half shortening. Used half brown sugar half splenda/sugar mixture. Added 1/2 tsp extra salt to accentuate the buttery taste without having to add extra butter. Excellent recipe!

This recipe is excellent!  It made the most perfect banana bread that has ever come out of my kitchen.  The only things I changed were that I added a little bit extra banana (probably about an extra 1/4 cup), and I added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I made my first batch 4 days ago and am making another tonight!  Thank you!

This is the best banana nut bread I ever made!  There's no way we could let both loaves cool completely & wrap with foil & refrigerate for two hours.  EBNB is my new, one & only banana bread recipe from now on.  I'm passing this one on to friends & family!

I have made this recipe with and without the nuts and it comes out crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.  Wonderful warm with hot melted butter.  
We went to a chain resturant that serves Banana Bread as a substitute to dinner rolls/cornbread and were not happy that it did not compare to this recipe.  (Yes we asked for dinner rolls, instead) 
I add extra banana mash it I have it, even did not mix exactly as directed, this still comes out marvelous.  
Thanks for this recipe...and to the local grocery that sells overripe bananas for next to nothing.

I have always made banana bread, constantly trying out new recipes.  This is the last recipe I will ever try.  It was so good. the best I have ever  had.  I took others advice and added baking powder and vanilla.  I also did 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar.  I bought more bananas just so that they can ripen and i can make more.

Halved the recipe and used a muffin tin because banana bread loaves never work for me.  I liked this.  I might try to add more banana next time, or strained banana baby food to get more banana flavor.

At first, I had reservations about this bread. I made it in a tube pan for my boyfriend's birthday. When I was done, it was still warm and had a slight burnt taste to the edges and it was a little undercooked on the bottom/top of the cake (it was a tube pan, so it was actually the bottom). It ended up cooking as it cooled, so that was fine.

It tasted much better at room temperature the next day, and even BETTER cold in the fridge on the third day!

The bread was moist and delicious.

I followed the advise of others here by adding a tsp vanilla, cinnamon, and half white, half brown(gourmet) sugar.

With no icing, this was a really good banana bread. Not the best I've had, but really good and I would make it several times again.

I also only baked it for about 45 Minutes.

I've NEVER made banana nut bread before this & it sounded easy enough.  Yes!  It was!  Absolutely delicious too!  I did add the vanilla & used half brown sugar with half white sugar.  I think next time I may also try a little cinnamon but I thought it was great as it was.  Forget trying to wait & save any!  That won't happen!  I kept going out breaking off another piece.  :)  Delicious!  Thanks Saseigel for a wonderful recipe.

Wow!  I tried this along with two other recipes and this was a hit with the entire family!  It was nice and moist on the inside and a perfect small, thin layer of buttery crunch to the crust.  I sent ot over to two neighbors who asked for the recipe!

This is the most delicious, moistest banana bread I've ever had. The only thing I added were 1/2 t vanilla and some raisens which made it even moister. Mine took an extra 10 minutes to firm up.

Hi, The cake sank in the middle and I am not sure why. The only thing that was different was I used extra large eggs as that was all I have.   Otherwise the cake was yummy!

This recipe is awesome! I read the reviews before I made it and used half white sugar, half brown sugar and added 2 tsp. of vanilla. I made some for us and for my sister-in-law and her family. We all loved it very much!!

Wow this bread is awesome.  The only changes I made were to use pecans instead of walnuts.  And I used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  My family and friends ate it up and begged for more.  Thanks.

Very good.  I used half brown, half white sugar, and I added some cinnamon.  I halved the recipe and only made one loaf.  It took about 45-50 min to bake through, and it also ended up a little dry for my taste.  Maybe a little extra butter in the future.

I added vanilla (1 tsp) also and cooked at 350 for 55 minutes which was just right.  As others said, it's heavy, not light and airy.

Made this for my family - they devoured it!  I made the recipe just as is - was VERY good.  Was a dark bread - and was sweet - but that is the way we like it.  A keeper for sure!  Thanks for sharing!!

Yummy!  Very moist and flavorful banana bread.  I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and pecans to half the batter.  A little dark around the edges so I think next time I will reduce the temp to 325.  At 350 it was done in 55 minutes. A keeper.

There is just something about this bread that I didn't care for.  I followed others advice on half white sugar and half brown sugar.  Used pecans instead of walnuts (all I had on hand).  Maybe I'm just not used to "So Much" banana flavor?!?

This is the best BNB ever!  I used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  Baked it in two square pans. Put one in the freezer and the other was gone before I could blink my eyes.  My granddaughters are very picky eaters but loved this BNB!

Best banana bread I've ever made & I've made many! I halved this recipe which worked fine, & instead of using all white sugar, I split it into white & brown. I also buttered & sugared the bread pan and added honey & additional sugar to the top when it was done baking for a sweet bonus.  This is such a moist & buttery bread..almost like a dessert!

Have made this many many times and i just love it. The bread is moist and the banana flavor is great. The one thing i do like to do that is diffrent is to spred the top of the lofe with honey about 10 minutes befor the bread is finished. I like a bit of crusty with my bread. Thanks for this recipie friend it has made many a person smile

Obsolutely to DIE FOR!  I cut down butter to 3/4 cup and add 1/4 cup of unsweetened apple sauce.  Next time I will try half and half.  Did add 1tsp vanilla and cinnamon.  It's so good that half the loaf is gone before it is even cooled.  Thank you!!!

This recipe is now a staple of mine, it is so moist and delicious my boyfriend and coworkers are always begging me to make it! 
A few "healthier" substitutions I make.. I use 1c whole wheat flour and 1c regular flour (rather than 2c all purpose flour) and instead of 2c of white sugar I use 1c white sugar and 1/2c splenda baking mix

I have been waiting to try this recipe for a week.  I had to wait for my bananas to "ripen".  This was the best banana bread that I have had in a long time!  So moist and delicious.  I followed the other suggestions and added 1t of vanilla 2t baking powder and half white and half brown sugar.  I can't wait to buy more bananas!

I don't know how the bread in the picture came out so nicely. Mine was very greasy eventhough I had it in the refrigerator for hours before I ate it. There are much nicer (and healthier) banana breads out there.

i loved this recipe. I added 5 large size banana's and a tablespoon of mayonaise to the batter to make it more moist and it turned out wonderful. I baked it in a 9 x 13 size pan instead of bread pan and cut into squares. Will definetly make this more often. No worries, you can't taste the mayonaise in the completed bread, it just helps to make the bread moist. Thankyou for a great recipe. My family will enjoy it over and over again.

This is our FAVORITE banana bread now!  The others here that have gotten 5 stars pale in comparison.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. rum flavoring and lots of cinnamon.  I also added sugar to the grease/flour pans step.  This makes a kind of crunchy-type bottom.  My boys and I have made 9 loaves (3 big and 6 little) of this yummy bread in 2 days!  The neighbors are lovin' our little loaves.  :-)

I reduced the butter to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup low fat sour cream. I also added flax seed for the omega-3 they provide. The recipe came out great and I will definitely use it again and again.

I love this recipe! I made it and sent it to my husband in Iraq. It is great for sealing for at least up to 2 weeks.  He said it tasted GREAT!  He keeps begging me for more. Highly recommended.

VERY delicious, but I found it to be a little on the sweeter side - so next time I make it, I will put a little less sugar.  Also, I'll try to use only 1 stick of butter because I could taste the FATS as my teeth sunk into these delicious treats!

I am RE-RATING THIS RECIPE!! This is truley the best banana bread recipe.  I have tweaked t my way but the end result is awesome. I would like to share my tweaks; I make 3 loaves not 2. Here is my substitutions. I do use the 1 cup butter not marjarine. I still use 1/4C Mayonaise for extreme moisture. I do add however an additonal full cup of flour now. I add chunky applesauce 1 Cup 1 Tesp Cinnamon or allspice. No white sugar I always use 2 cups dark brown sugar. I also sometimes add chopped pecans about 1/2 cup and some occasions I mix in about 3/4 cup pf dired berry/cherry blend of dred fruit. What I love is that this s the best base recipe for doing your own thing it never goes wrong. Your moms recipe is indeen EBNB and I highly reccomend using this recipe. I just made 3 more loaves.

SO SO SO GOOD! I made today for Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE hit. The only thing that I would say though is that you definetly dont need to add any butter when you eat it! Thanks SASEIGEL,  I will certainly make this again.

This recipe is just the best sweet bread recipe out there! I made it a LOT when I was pregnant in the spring of this year, I always stored one of the loaves in the fridge for later! I also added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and used half white sugar and half brown sugar....excellent! Definitely recommend this.

Really deserves a 10 Star rating. I bring mine out of the oven after 55 min.
Always try to have extras in freezer for a quick gift.

I had some over ripe bananas and thought I'd try a new recipe.  I saw this one and it sounded good.  I was short 1 cup of bananas though.  I thought about adding applesauce, but decided to try 1 c. of yogurt. (Pina Colada Yoplait).  It turned out so moist and good, and not dark at all.  Great recipe.  I will use it again!

I picked this recipe because it was a dense bread, and it was.  However, it got way to dark for my liking and I think it just tasted too buttery.

If you are looking for a moist, delicious, flavorful banana nut bread, look no further--this is it! My family loved it so much, we made it twice in one week. Each time it was devoured within a day or two. It was an especially big hit with my 4 year old--even with the walnuts, which I doubled. I added about a tsp. of cinnamon and a tsp. vanilla as well. This is  the only banana bread I'll ever make.

This is a great recipe.  I added a tsp of baking soda like another reviewer did.  I also added chocolate chips and made a stuesel with brown sugar, butter and walnuts for the top.  Totally delicious!

This was good bread, but not what I am still looking for.  It came out very dark, and I wish it was a little moister with more banana flavor.  I will keep looking. All in all its a good bread, we enjoyed it but it didnt live up to its hype.

A very tasty banana bread. It doesn't have as much banana flavor as my usual recipe does although it has more banana than mine. The family didn't like it cold as it gets a wet rubbery feel to it. Hot it was really good but not a take along for my family.

If you love a dense banana bread this is the one for you! I've made this a few times and everyone loves it. I have made a few changes to suit my own tastes, I add about 1 tsp. of each vanilla extract, ground cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. One morning I decided to make this when it was my turn to host playgroup at the last minute and I was out of walnuts, I threw in about a cup of raisins instead and it was very good that way also. Good alternative if you're not a nut person. Freezes well.

A slice of heaven! My husband is the biggest banana nut bread eater on the planet, and he couldn't believe how EBNB melts in your mouth. I did add 1/2 cup extra walnut and 1 tsp. of vanilla as suggested by another reviewer. Also, it doesn't take as long to bake as instructed so watch for doneness.

I just got these out of the oven. They are awesome! I made one loaf of bread and made muffins out out of the rest. I used 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white. Also, 1 stick of butter, and 1 stick of margerine.

This is the very first time I have ever made Banana Nut Bread and it didn't turn out like a BRICK!  It was the best ever!  I used Butter flavored Crisco in place of the margarine/butter, and I used Walnuts that were chopped fine for ice cream toppings, and I used whole wheat flour.  This turned out so moist and so yummy!  It was hard to keep the family from cutting into it when it was cooling, and it was really hard to make them wait a couple hours while it chilled in the fridge.  I then let it come back up to room temp and pretty soon we all devoured the first loaf.  Nice to know the family can enjoy something yummy and good for them as well!  Thanks!

**Absolutely perfect and delicious** The only thing I did different or added, I sprinkled the top with cinnamon/sugar, and I'm so glad I did! My husband is not a fan of this kind of stuff. With a little convincing he took a small bite of mine. A few minutes later he was back asking for a slice. Thanks for the recipe. I'm looking forward to another warm slice and a cup of hot tea!

I have never baked banana nut bread before.. In fact besides chocolate chip cookies, I have never baked. I am a newbie to cooking in general and was looking for some recipes for my family to enjoy. I came across this one and made it that day. This is a AWESOME!!!! recipe. It is easy to make and absolutely great to eat. I followed it exactly and it came out perfectly. Please do wait the 5 minutes to cool otherwise the bottom will not come out smoothly..(ooppss!)

The flavor in this recipe can't be beat.  I cooked the bread for 70 minutes and it was still really moist - almost too moist (wet)!  The outside was getting too brown so I had to remove, maybe I'll cover the loaf with aluminum foil half-way through and cook it longer next time.  Other concern is this bread is really fattening - but really tasty!

The only people who were disappointed with this recipe seem to be the people who attempted to make alterations to it.  I was MORE THAN SATISFIED with this recipe and happy that I came across it!

I too made this for riding out the hurricane. I made mini loaves and used pecans as well.(It's a southern thing) I want to sincerely thank the recipe contributor for this one. In the early morning hours, as we sat in the dark and listened to the wind roar, we were comforted by this absolutly wonderful bread. This in my new keeper recipe. I did cut the suger a little, using 3/4 cup each of white sugar and brown suger. Excellent bread!!!!

I halved the recipe thinking 2 loaves were going to be too much...I was sooo wrong!  One of the best banana breads I have ever tasted.  I use pecans instead of walnuts for a change. I do have a problem with it burning though...mabye cook it longer and at a lower temp.

Absolutely sinful! I made 4 loaves of this to survive the Hurricane and they were all gone before the storm was! Undoubtedly the best banana bread I've ever eaten, try it you won't be disappointed.

This is not at all what I expected.  The print hype made it sound fabulous, I found it to be OKAY.  There simply is not enough flavor and I added cinnamon to the batter.  Do cut the bake time down.  My loaves would have burned after 45 minutes.

Cut the recipe in half and baked in 3 small loaves for 40 minutes.  Also added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  The bread turned out wonderfully.  An easy and tasty recipe.  It is definitely a keeper in my recipe box.

I've given this a second try and was more satisfied than the first.  I find this quite greasy and next time will decrease the butter slightly to see if it is ok.  I made mini loaves (5 of them) with this batch.  It's a great way to make it so that you don't have a whole large loaf on your counter, calling your name!  Also, I used pecans because that's what was in my cupboard, but I ground them first.

I make this all the time for bake sales, they are great. The recipe will make 8 mini loafs (I think the size is 5 x 8). My kids also love to take them to school. They are just small enough for 2 kids to split the small loaf. Thanks

I only had two (very, very ripe) bananas and just enough flour for half a batch ... and I wanted muffins.  It all worked fine.  I did add baking powder as other reviewers suggested, but I didn't grease and flour the muffin tin.
Overall, I found it a bit sweet ... but we ate them just the same!

WOW!!! This was better than the usual bread I make. We finished one loaf for desert and the other loaf was cut up for everones lunch the next day. I have to find more over-ripe bananas so I can make more. I used pecans and added vanilla as suggested. Thanks SASEIGEL for a great recipe.

I halved this recipe since I only wanted 1 loaf. I used sliced almonds because that is what I had. The bread was flat & not very thick.( not much batter ) I thought the taste was fair. I have other banana bread recipes that are better. I LOVE how you submitted your recipe, however!

Love this recipe! Definitely followed another reviewer’s recommendation on creaming the butter and sugar first and adding the eggs. Then mixing the dry ingredients (sifted flour, baking powder, salt) in portions. I also added some vanilla

I made this yesterday and it is very good! When I found this recipe I read lots and lots of reviews which helped me to know to add a tsp of baking powder to help with rising. I also don’t have loaf pans so I just used my glass 8x11 and it was rising after 20 minutes! For those whose bread didn’t come out right you did something wrong. It’s sweet but it’s not really that dense to me. It doesn’t matter because my family loves it and I’m having to fight them off as I’m doing this review. Thanks a bunch for the awesome recipe!

This is a great recipe! My small tweaks included: 1c of coconut flour to sub for 1 c of regular flour, 1 tsp of all spice, 1 tsp of vanilla, and at least 1/2 to 1 c of more walnuts. It was amazing.

Made this two times now.  It makes a dense, dark, but extremely flavorful banana bread.  Made it once with walnuts and then with pecans.  I like the pecan version best!  Can see it with chocolate chips for a younger audience!

OMG SOOOOO MOIST AND DELICIOUS!!! It’s the first time I’ve ever made any kind of loaf bread and I am kind of shocked at how good it is because it’s my first time. 
A tip of the hat to the owner of the recipe, we are in love with this banana nut bread.

I have a banana nut bread recipe I have used for 40 years.  But, I'm out of town and wanted to make some.  I combed the internet looking for recipes that seemed like mine and found this one.  I wondered about the 2 cups flour (usually more flour than sugar in recipes).  But followed recipe exactly.  Very disappointed.  It did not rise and crust has an almost sugar coating.  Left aftertaste in my mouth.  Probably going to throw both loaves out :-(.  Maybe there should be 3 cups flour, not 2?  Maybe baking powder instead of baking soda?

I've used this recipe for years and it's the ONLY banana nut bread recipe I will use. This recipe is MOUTH WATERING & ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.  Definitely addicting.  Don't make if you are dieting. Thank you so much for sharing. Everytime I make it, anyone who tastes it, agrees it's the best bnb they've ever had. LOVE IT.

I make 2 batches and put in 3# aluminum loaf pans to freeze in 1 gallon freezer bags and give away or bring to work as needed..delicious recipe...for sure alway make it now at 1 hour and 10 minutes..it will look like its getting too brown but if you remove it based on color it will still be uncooked in the middle so at least 1 full hour at 350 and longer if in bigger pans.  The crust will seem overdone at first but soften..i like to sprinkle decorating sugar on top or turbinato for a crunchy fun topping.  This is a wonderful recipe.  But as with any baking soda quickbread you will learn how full to fill your pans and it gets better the 2nd time but deff stick with this!

This is the best!  I make it often.  I sometimes leave bananas to ripen just so I can make it.  I have a stash of over ripe frozen bananas in my fridge to make when I don't want to wait for the bananas we have to ripen.  It is addictive.   Perfect recipe!

The BEST Banana Nut Bread ever! I use 1c brown sugar and 1c white sugar and it really changes the taste and makes it just  a little better. the brown sugar gives it a richer flavor. Ive been searching for a recipe like my great grandmas bread and this is very close!

Jeez Louise this recipe is awesome. I tweaked it a bit using oil instead of butter and made one loaf plain and one load with a half cup of salted walnuts. That walnut loaf was amazing!!! The regular loaf was delicious too but something about those salted walnuts made it so good. I tasted the batter despite the warning and I could tell before it baked it was gonna be one hellavu treat!!

I was never popular at work before I started bringing this in.  As written the recipe is fine.  I cook exactly 60 minutes and never more than that.  If kept refrigerated and wrapped, it is still good after 9 days.  Everyone else puts spreads butter on it.  I like it better without.

I, too, made a few changes:

I used 2 teaspoons baking powder (as someone said, this is the right amount for 2 cups flour).
I used 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.
I used pecans instead of walnuts.
I used 2 teaspoons vanilla.
I used 1 teaspoon cinnamon. 
I added 1/4 cup dark coffee rum.

In my oven, 65 minutes was perfect! The bread is moist and delicious! Next time I will add more rum, I think.

Oops, almost forgot. My bananas weren't big enough, so 4 fell about 1/2 cup short, so I added 1/2 cup apple sauce.

This is obviously a very forgiving recipe!

I didn't change a thing and this is AMAAAAAAZING. It is a bit on the sweet side, so you could probably cut half a cup of sugar and still have it be plenty sweet enough. I made a double batch and used slightly smaller toss away loaf pans, so I cooked it just a wee bit less,,,,,,,doubling the recipe gave me 5 of the smaller loaves. The loaves turned out nicely after 5 minutes of resting, no broken loaves :)  I cheated though,,,,,,,couldn't wait a few hours for it to cool and we ate it warm,,,,,omgosh, with real butter on top, FABULOUS.

I made this recipe as written, or so I thought I had.  I only used 1 cup of sugar.  I am baking this for work tomorrow so I had to  taste it and it's fabulous!  I will make this mistake from now on.  I did use 1\2 teaspoon of salt as my butter was salted but those are the only changes I made. This will definitely be my go to recipe from now on.  I definitely want to try the suggestion of greasing the pan and using cinnamon and sugar to coat the pan.

This is the best ever just like it's called!! I also made them with walnuts.  Since it is that moist I also made it with raisins.  The raisons are the best out of all because it gives the bread a whole new twist!

Before baking you should know that this recipe yields for TWO loaves!

I did not alter anything except how I added and mixed. 
For those who are not in the kitchen much, just use your stand mixer to cream the butter, eggs, and sugar.  Then add your dry ingredients, mix for about a minute or two on slow setting,  and fold in walnuts. 
Bake time as instructed (can vary depending upon altitude/oven).

This recipe was so awesome! My husband doesn't even want me telling people we made some so that he doesn't have to share. I used more vanilla and substituted some of the sugar for brown sugar. And I also used pecans and added 1.5 cups. Amazing, moist, flavorful recipe.

Delicious!  I will definitely make this again!  It has a really nice moist flavor. I was out of shortening so I used oil to grease the pans. Except for it not rising as much as I would like....it was a huge hit!  Very moist.

The recipe I’ve been trying to find, I knew it had to exist! Added 2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 baking powder. Baked in mini loaf pans.  After
Reading another review I creamed butter and sugar, mixed in beaten eggs and vanilla.  Stirred in dry ingredients, then added the bananas and nuts. makes 18 mini loaves...

I made it exactly like the recipe! Was really good. I did use my bananas from my own tree, which are smaller and sweeter. Still, better than any other recipe I’ve made!

My son and I LOVE banana nut bread and so does my mom. The first time I made this I gave my mom a loaf and we kept the other. I finished it by myself in a matter of three days. My son was in his picky stage. The next time I made it, I froze one loaf and my son and I devoured the rest along with my mother who took a hearty slice. I love that it makes two loaves. We love walnuts and it gives it that push into greatness!

Great recipe, I've added Craisins or dried Blueberries  or Dried Cherries on different occasions to mix it up a bit.

Just a note about HIGH ALTITUDE baking. I have used this recipe for years and I think it is definitely 5 star.  I use pecans and add a little cinnamon like some others on this sight.  Then, I moved to 8000 ft. Altitude and have a problem with sinking in the middle.  Be sure to add 2 Tablespoons more flour than the recipe and do not open the oven door until time to take it out.

The flour to baking soda is wrong. It should be a 1/4 tsp of baking soda for every 1 cup of flour so a total of 1/2 tsp of baking soda should be used for the two cups of flour. My cake  went flat half way through baking it. :(

I loved it, but it was so sweet it almost tasted like candy. Next time I'll try it with brown sugar the way others suggested. I added 1tsp of vanilla and 2 tsp of cinnamon. And mixed the ingredients in a different order. I also used a bundt pan instead of 2 loaves. Great flavor, moist inside and a light crisp/candy crust.

I changed to  5 bananas, about 2 1/4 cups mashed bananas added 1/3 cup sour cream, added an additional 1/4 flour and changed sugar ratio to 1 3/4 cup white sugar  1/3 cup brown sugar and used butter extract instead of vanilla.  Instead of walnuts I used pecans.  Soooo good!!!

I made this twice just to be sure — the second time is when I cut some batter for testing in my muffin pan. This is actually not that good as banana bread, because for some reason it works better with less surface area to cook through aka as a muffin (Or maybe the expectations are different? I'd give it 3.5/4 stars as a muffin)! I found it to be wholly less than bland as a BB —without vanilla, greasy even with the soda overload, and just hard to get done at the already lengthy specified time.

Well, I found this recipe yesterday and I made it today at work for my coworkers.  We bring fruit to work and had some bananas too ripe to eat and a coworker said, hey, these would make great bread.  So...of course I had too.  It made the building smell yummy.  Perfect with cold front blowing in.  I did read most of the comments and I did tweak it a bit as most did.  I added vanilla, cinnamon and baking powder.  I also had never thought of doing what one said, grease pan and instead of flour coat with cinnamon sugar.  OMG!  This is by far the best banana bread recipe I have ever used.  So far, I have given two copies.  But I posted on FB, so more copies there.  Thank you.  Deliciousness!!! Have a wonderful blessed day!

I added about 3/4 cup of some leftover pumpkin purée that I had a couple teaspoons of nutmeg and a teaspoon of allspice. I used toasted walnuts which is always a better flavor. So so so good. I will be making this a lot!

*****  This is a 10 star recipe!!!  The very best banana bread I've ever tasted!  Followed the recipe with three additions:  added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 1/2 tsp.  baking powder added.  I don't think the baking powder made a difference in the rising.   It did not rise!  I set the timer for 45 minutes and when I checked it, it was done!  This is my only recipe from now on!!!

Found my kin!  I made no changes. This was exactly like my grandma’s!  I specifically searched for “dense banana nut bread” and found this recipe. I have tried to make many banana nut bread recipes before and they usually turn out like banana cake. For people not happy about it not rising, I would say that it’s not supposed to. The description at the beginning is completely on point. I thought my family would eat 1/2 of 1 loaf that day and then we would have 1 1/2 for other family members coming for dinner the next day.  Well that didn’t exactly work out.  The footnotes at the end, (which I thought was an exaggeration) are absolutely true! This is perfect and has made my whole family happy!

Absolutely delicious! I added some chocolate chips for sweeties, but will make it again without,  It wasn't necessary,  I too had a few white spots but Im sure it was because I didn't sift my flour as stated.  Just make sure its well blended. This recipe is perfect!

I add mini chocolate chips instead of nuts. I also do half brown sugar. It's gobbled up.

Great recipe! Followed suggestions from other reviewers and added vanilla and cinnamon. I also added 3/4c dark chocolate chips. For future batches, i'll reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp as that was a bit too much for my taste. I also used Truvia in place of the sugar to keep it more diabetic-friendly for my hubby. :)

I love this recipe! I've been making it for years now. The only thing I do differently is add a splash of vanilla and some cinnamon, perfection.

I made this twice it comes out great! I followed the instructions but added the dry to the wet instead (it’s just easier to me). I cooked the loafs for 60 minutes but halfway through added some pecans with cinnamon and sugar and a little butter to the top.... delish!!!!

Didn't change a thing.  Baking time was 55 minutes for my oven.  I did not let it cool completely before I ate 3 slices.  Good thing I have a second loaf.  Will make again.

OK.. definately a 5 star recipe.  But, as the author suggested, "use what you have on hand"...  so I did.  I didnt have any bananas but I did have 1/2 of a butternut squash , roasted and ready to go.  I pureed it and used it instead of mashed banana.  I added cinnamon, ginger and allspice as well.  2 tablespoons of homemade vanilla just because it is so yummy and 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar.  It turned out better than I could have hoped. It is a forgiving recipe as well.  I added way to much puree, maybe 2 1/2 cups because I didnt want it to go to waste  I think this means not only do I have a new "Go To" banana nut  bread recipe but also a new pumpkin bread recipe.

This banana bread was delicious! I used honey instead of sugar and added more flour. And used a little bit less bananas (because I didn't have enough!) and they tasted amazing but not like banana bread, So I just called it honey bread. Really moist and delicious! And so yummy!!!

I added some cinnamon and fresh blueberries. I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a 9x13 for about 25 minutes.

I made this, this past week!  It was fairly easy to make!  It came out looking just like the pictures. The problem comes in the moistness!  It was dry and sugary tasting.  It did not resemble any Banana Nut Bread I have ever had.

This bread was amazing. So dense and moist. Easy to make. I cut down on the baking time. (My oven runs very hot). I checked the bread after 50 mins. It was still a little gooey, so I put it in for 5 more mins. Perfect!!

This is a winner for sure. Easy to make. The banana taste is not overpowering. I made it into cupcakes to take on a bus trip. I doubled the recipe and it make 36 cupcakes.

It was delicious! In fact this was the 2nd batch I've made in the last 3 weeks. The only change I did was I had a large bag of over-ripe bananas from the store so I went way past the recipes recommended amount.  :)

Considering that I'm a bit of a dyslexic and I made this recipe backwards for the most part, it turned out great!  I've tried other recipes for banana bread but this one is just right. Moist and sweet but not too much.

I now make this bread at least once a week.  Sometimes I use pecans, but that is the only variation.  A great, dense, moist crumb and just right on flavors.  A stand mixer makes it a snap to make.  Thank you for sharing this.

I've made this recipe several times and it never disappoints.  It's always moist and tastes absolutely fantastic.  This recipe also works well as muffins!

Definitely worth the effort. Very nice bread that doesn’t crumble away. Person choice to add 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup sour cream  to all ingredients. Yummy!!!

It makes no sense and serves no purpose that I can see to *stir* in STIR in nuts. It makes no sense and serves no purpose that I can see to *stir* in banana, eggs or dry ingredients. They need *mixing* to be thoroughly incorporated. I added 1 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp cinnamon. Used dark brown sugar/white in a 3:1 ratio. Pecans instead of walnuts. Have not tasted anything this great in a LOOOONG time! The crust is fabulous, banana flavor is great, moisture is awesome! And I read it will be better tomorrow!! Amazing.

I have used this recipe for about 5 years now. It really doesn't get any better than this, for a tasty dense banana bread. The 2 cups of banana is usually about 4 bananas, but for guaranteed denseness I go for about 6 bananas.

Amazing flavour and texture!! So moist and bananyyy!! My family loved it so much that I’ll be baking another batch soon. Followed tips from other reviews;  I added 1 tsp each cinnamon and vanilla extract. This banana bread taste even more amazing the next day. And the next.  Lol but it’s really soo hard not to finish it up all at once.

Wonderful recipe!  So moist.  I've made this recipe twice now.  It's my "go to" recipe.  I added a bit of vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon to the second batch, but that's just me.

I followed one of the reviewers suggestions. I feel the instructions provided by the originator neglected some very important clarifications. If someone unknown to baking had tried to follow the recipe it would not have come out well.

This is the worst banana bread I have ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I set the timer for 60 minutes but checked it at 45 minutes and it was already too done.  It has hardly any banana flavor.

Followed the recipe exactly as written, but after tasting it  I probably won't make it again.  Nothing special about the flavour. Don't waste your time on this recipe, there are definitely better ones out there.

I would make this again. It was dense but we expected it to turn out this way and were ok with the texture. The flavors were a teeny bit on the bland side but still good. We had leftovers.....  something deserving of 5 stars needs to get gobbled up as many people live at our home. The extras got tossed. Will most likely add more salt and sugar/flavors next time and spend the extra couple of bucks for pecans rather than walnuts. Will update when I tweak the recipe to let everyone know how it goes.

I made this with high expectations, but found it was just OK. It's very tasty and buttery for sure (mine look exactly like your main picture), but with a name like extreme banana nut bread I guess I expected more. You won't be disappointed. It's good banana bread. This recipe is NOT exceptional.

Making it right now and it smells SOOOO good. I love to try all types of banana bread recipes, already seems like this one is gonna be a hit! Update: I added chocolate chips to half of the loaves I made, since that's what my kiddo likes, and everyone LOVED this bread both ways. I got requests for loaves for the next time I make it, which is today.

This is an excellent Banana Nut Bread recipe.  Very easy to make and the taste is spot on.  Very moist and flavorful.  Like others, I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and for my Son, some chocolate chip morsels.  A great recipe that I will make over and over again.

I have had another banana nut bread recipe that I have used for years but while out of town I didn't have my recipe book with me and I am terrible about being able to remember how to make recipes without instructions.  Anyway.... I looked up this one and it turned out great.  I will be using this recipe from now on.   The bread was very moist and had great flavor.  I even found that the bottom and top of my crust caramelized well.  Loved it!!

Everytime i make this, it gets eaten instantly! The only thing I'd do is use a little less than a tsp... Last couple times i used a tsp i could taste the salt in multiple slices of bread. Other than that it's perfect!

I have made this a couple of times and it does not last long.  It is a very flexible recipe.  I used half white/half brown sugar.  The last time I made it I followed a suggestion that instead of greasing and flouring the pan, you grease (spray) the pan and coat it with cinnamon sugar.  It made the bottom sweet and crunchy.  Recipe is also perfect as written!

I’ve been making this recipe for years now and it’s the best I’ve come across.  For an extra scrumptious treat try adding a layer of chocolate chips just before you add your remaining batter.  Yum!

I can't keep this around.  It's gone almost before it cools.  I have made this recipe with Pecans (personal preference) and Raisins.  I am getting ready now to bake my 5th batch in the last 45 days.  This time it will be a double batch.

Made it 2x's because the first time was so good.  That means something coming from me, because I don't care for bananas!  I really don't like walnuts, and didn't have any on hand, so substituted the walnuts with Planter's pistachio/almond/cashew mix. I just beat the whole nuts in a plastic/paper bag with a hammer to break them down a little. I love that this recipe doesn't have to be EXACT like in the butter area.  Had to substitute because I ran out. Used a cup of margarine/oil.

The best I've ever had! The only change I made was by cracking the eggs directly into the butter/sugar mixture, then creaming it until it got fluffy. I put half the batter in a pyrex pan, and half in a metal pan. Both came out perfect. This tastes like the stuff my mom used to make. I'll make it again.

Totally delishious and addicting, best eaten the day you make it if you like crispy top. It gets soft after a day.
I only had 3 eggs so I alternated with another 1/4 cup of mashed banana. Of course I put way more than 1 cup walnuts

This is actually the best banana bread recipe have ever found; and I have tried a lot of recipes. I have made it twice, and the only change I have made is to put sanding sugar in top.
My husband RAVED about it; so did the neighbors. I recommend this whole-heartedly!

YAAASSSS! So good! I do what the others have said. 1/2 & 1/2 white & brown sugar.  1-2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1-2 tsp cinammon, pecans. I coat the pans with spray then cinnamon/sugar mix, it's done at 350 in 55 minutes, never more. Just doubled it & made 8 mini loaves and 2 big loaves. Delicious! Recipe great as is, just always tweaking things.

Thank you for sharing your mom's EBNB!  Truly the best I've ever made.  And the bonus was that it made 2 loaves. My husband and I munched on the first loaf and froze the 2nd one.

This is a keeper.

A very good recipe.  I made some substitutions to 1 3/4 c 100% whole wheat flour, used pure unrefined organic coconut oil, cut down the sugar to 1 c brown + 1/2 c white sugar, added 2 tsp of real vanilla, 1 T of Ceylon (real) cinnamon, and added 3/4 cup of bittersweet chocolate chips.  Cooked it at 340 for 75 min.  It was perfect!  The boys next door said it was "bananalicious" lol.

This was sooo good. Followed advice of others added 1/2tsp baking powder, 2 tsp vanilla extract, used pecans instead of walnuts as the husband prefers pecans, and then did a butter crisco pan coating with  cinnamon sugar mix in place of the flour. Sent 2 loaves to work which received great feed back and a coveted its pretty good from the husband who can usually find a flaw or a reason to pick at a recipe. The seal of approval from the dog as well who kept trying to steal my bread anytime I turned away from my plate for a milisecond.  That being said. One of if not the best banana bread I have ever had and as such my new banana bread go to recipe. Thank you so much for posting it and thank you to the others as well who posted the modifications.

I was in a hurry so I made this recipe as muffins; it made 3 dozen. The author was right, substitutions worked fine: I didn’t have chopped nuts so I substituted 1/3 c hazelnut flour, 1/3 c flaxseed meal and added chocolate chips. I glazed them with a little brown sugar melted in hot coffee. They were quickly devoured by a group of hungry teens. My banana bread is always on the dry side, but these were super moist and springy. This is a keeper!

This was a good recipe. I used chopped hazelnuts- excellent in it. I used a small loaf pan and the center fell but I used a square pan 8x8 and it came out great. I think with all the banana I would use a shallower pan rather than the loaf pan. It's hard to get things to set up anyway when it's so deep. Great recipe!

Love this recipe! I have made this so many times.  I always put my bananas in the oven (peel on) for 20 mins to get them good and black..really brings out the flavor of the bananas. I also use the juice as well. Thank you for this awesome recipe!

Yes, I modified the recipe, per an excellent review, that substituted some brown sugar for white and added cinnamon and vanilla. Because it makes a dense bread, you can spread cream cheese on top without tearing it.

This was an excellent recipe. My daughter didn't even wait to let it cool before she started eating it. The only thing different that I did was 1 1/2 cups of sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Other than that followed the recipe. I made 2 loaves yesterday and made another 2 this morning. I will definitely be making more very soon.

This is the only recipe I use. When one of my stepdaughters came into my life with her nut allergies, I eliminated the walnuts. It still tastes amazing. Thank you for the recipe.

Turned out delicious. Best banana nut bread I’ve ever had. I made the mini loafs because it is just my husband and I. I would be surprised and disappointed if it not just as delicious after freezing because this recipe made several small loafs.

This is a really great recipe. I did however add a tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla, just a personal preference. It’s the best banana bread I’ve ever tasted. I also checked after 55 mins and mine were done. This ones a keeper!

Lovely receipe. I am guilty for always taking a receipe and putting my own twist on it. Not this time. Follow the recipes as it states and AMAZING! The only thing I did near the end of the baking time is I laid a sheet of parchment paper the over of the bread pans. So that the bread loafs didn’t get to dark. My family really enjoyed the recipe as well. Thank you for a great share!

This recipe came out way better than we expected but we did a few things different. The first thing we did was add a teaspoon of vanilla to the wet mix right before adding the dry mix in. We also used two 4x8 loaf pans instead and baked them at 350 for 50 minutes each. We will definitely be making it again. 

P.S. listen when it says to cool completely, wrap, and refrigerate for 2 hours. It was good warm but waking up this morning and trying it after it sat in the fridge tasted 10x better!

This is fantastic! Just as described. I used all brown sugar to get that carmelized crust and added a little bit of cinnamon  and baked it in a bundt cake pan which made it look pretty as well. I have been looking for a long time for this type of dense banana bread. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. We love it.

Amazing banana nut bread recipe. I have been using this recipe for the last five years (I found it on here, but had not thought to review it until now).  Everyone that has tried it has commented on how good it tastes.  I follow the recipe exactly  as written. On occasion, I have omitted the walnuts (for friends who can't have nuts), with the same great results.  Once it cools, I wrap it in Saran Wrap and leave it on the counter.  It is great served the day it is baked, and is even better the next day! You can even freeze it, for up to one month, let it thaw at room temperature and serve it (still amazing)!

Used 1 C brown sugar and 1 C white sugar instead of only white sugar. Added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp vanilla extract and an extra 1/2 C flour.  Put entire recipe in a Bundt pan and baked at 325 in convection over for about 1 hr.  It came out great! 5 stars

It came out amazing. I added just a little cinnamon and vanilla extract. It was just enough flavoring but not too much.

THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST BANANA NUT BREAD RECIPE I have ever made in my life, or even ate for  that matter...  I love banana flavored anything. But This bread is so moist and it has the best taste and texture . When I make this EBNB  recipe, I always  add a few teaspoons of banana extract or flavoring  to it just to give it a more extreme  banana flavor.. It tastes  great without the extra flavoring tthough, but I do it  just to bump it up a notch.. I have to quadruple  this recipe EVERYTIME 
I make it because everybody is always putting  in requests for it.  I WILL NEVER USE ANOTHER RECIPE FOR BANANA NUT BREAD EVER AGAIN!!!! THIS IS "THE ONE & ONLY" banana  nut bread for me!!!!!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!!

My daughter-law-law buys bananas every week.  She always has overly ripe ones by end of week for me to take home to make this recipe!!  I make one for my husband and I and one for Lynn!!  I freeze them and have it ready for times when her family doesn’t have any for me!!  We love this recipe.
I only bake it about 40 minutes

This recipe is the FIRST banana nut bread I've ever tried to make.  It was so easy to follow and turned out so good!!!  I followed it to the T.  Not sure why people give it a low rating and then wonder why it didn't turn out good when they didn't follow the recipe. It's great!!!  Will absolutely make again!!

I made it exactly as the recipe. I used real butter.  I checked at 50 min, not done. 10 minutes later knife came out clean.  Entire family loves it. I've never made banana nut bread before but I've eaten plenty of others. This is better than everyone else's.

I made this EXACTLY like the recipe instructed and it turned out amazing! This recipe isn't ment to rise much and mine was very soft, sweet, and full of flavor! I did turn down my conventional oven to 325 and baked it for 55 minutes with the loaf in the metal pan and and 65 minutes with my stone pan.

I went strictly by the recipe and used real butter and King Arthur cake flour. I will definitely be using this recipe from now on!! The best I’ve ever had! I do advise everyone to read the footnotes;) I didn’t heed the warnings and the first loaf is almost gone(there’s only myself and my husband):):)

I made this with gluten free flour. It was divine!!I stored it in the fridge, and I heat it up when I want a piece. It still tastes fresh and just as yummy!  I can’t wait to give some to my family members.

I loved it and I took the advice of the others by adding vanilla and cinnamon and coating the pan with cinnamon sugar. I halved the recipe thinking my 4 guests would only eat 1 piece each but they all wanted 2! I gave my husband a piece so I only got one bite. I will make it again! The Lord blessed me with 3 pounds of ripe bananas for $1.00.

At least my 9 or 10th  time following the recipe.  Any variations in final product all on me; more/less banana, sometimes slightly less sugar (one time with a bit of honey), finer/coarser walnuts...each time a success!

Taste was wonderful. I tried making it in three small loaf pans, but should've used 5-6, so it overflowed and we had banana nut "cookies" which were a delightful, tasty treat! This recipe is going into my faves to make again...and again.

I love this recipe, however I only used 3 eggs, no salt and added vanilla almond milk. In place of walnuts which I didn't have I used dried cranberries. It came out very moist, also added cinnamon. Cooking time for me was 45-50 minutes on 350..

I Love This recipe!  It’s very moist and the best tasting banana bread I’ve ever made.  I substited brown sugar for 1/2 of the white sugar called for and sometimes I add chocolate chips to the batter.  I also used chopped black walnuts  for the nuts and added 1 tsp. Of vanilla.

I made two changes to this recipe, and it was absolutely delicious! Instead of 2 cups of sugar, I used 1 & 1/2 cups of sugar. The banana bread was still very sweet and delicious.
The second change is actually more interesting, I substituted Pillsbury gluten-free flour for regular bread flour. If you didn't know it was gluten free it you wouldn't have known it by eating it. It was wonderful. As I have a good friend that's gluten-free, I thought we'd give it a try. Getting any kind of good bread is a real treat. She was thrilled. I will be posting this on a gluten-free baking website also.

I liked this recipe very much. I made it with no substitutions. The only comment I have is that this is by no means a traditional banana bread. It is very moist and nutty with great flavor but it reminded me more of a cake. A nice moist nutty cake.

This is my go to recipe for BNB! I have made it at least 20 times now and I have always used sliced almonds instead of walnuts. I just don't care for the taste of walnuts. This time I substituted half the serving of butter for  plain apple sauce and I couldn't tell the difference.

I've always loved banana nut bread, but have never been much of a cook.  This recipe was my first attempt ever.  It was so easy and turned out amazing.  Unfortunately, it didn't last very long.  2 days later and I'm making my 2nd batch now.  LOVE IT.

AllRecipes has never let me down!  And this recipe for banana bread was no exception.  I baked it not knowing what to expect. The only change or addition I made was after reading the many reviews, I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1tsp of vanilla.  I think the 1tsp of baking soda may have been a quite bit too much as the bread did not rise.  To cover this up, I cut and arranged the bread on a platter.  This bread is awesome! Everybody that tasted it, enjoyed it and while it lasted many came back for seconds.  Its amazing, moist and I love it. I will be making it again, and again!  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Total hit in this house!!! I do have a few things that I change. I only use 1tsp of baking soda seems to help keep it together a little more for my family. I also add dried cherries and pecan since walnuts are greatly disliked by this crew. All in all Todd loves it and that truly is all that matters. Since I truly can't stand bananas

Making it the second time through since one loaf was demolished within a day. The other loaf I hid in the freezer for a day I didn’t feel like baking. Amazing turnout when following instructions. The only changes I made is I cut out the salt and added slightly more walnuts and bananas.

Second time making it.  No changes needed, no lumps of flour. Just followed directions closely. Last time I made it I gave a loaf to my daughter. A couple of days later she called. Her first words were "I hate You" She then said she had eaten the whole loaf by herself.

Delicious! I made this two ways, as written (for ingredients) but I incorporated the dry ingredients into the wet in a stand mixer which was excellent and gluten and dairy free which I loved! I used 1 1/2cups 1:1 Bob's Red Mill gluten free flour(at Whole Foods) and 1/2 cup almond meal and coconut oil in place of the  butter and it came out delicious. I also added a 1/2 cup of dark chocolate Guittard chocolate chips (happens to be dairy free) and nearly a cup walnuts. My kids love this as well!! Great recipe. It baked in 50 minutes at 350 for me.

This is exactly what I had in mind when I was searching for a banana bread recipe.  Typically I don't give 5 stars to a recipe that I modify, but the only switch I made was using 1/2 brown sugar (Splenda actually), and 1/2 white sugar.  This recipe makes a delicious, dense, very moist banana bread that was quickly devoured.

Like another reviewer, the mix didn't cook well - I thought perhaps I had forgotten to add enough flour!  Tastes good but  it doesn't rise correctly.  I will never make this recipe again.

This definitely deserves a 5 star rating. Its a must share, otherwise you will be tempted to eat it all!  Everyone raves about how good it is.  I've tried several recipes and this outshines them all!

I made this bread last week. I added half walnuts and half pecans, over ripe bananas and cinnamon.  I made a crumb topping of butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, walnuts and pecans with some flour. Turned out Awesome!

Well, not quite sure how to rate this one. I added vanilla and substituted pecans for the walnuts (I'm a self-respecting southern gal, after all).  Checked the oven at 54 minutes and both loaves were flat and burned. Toothpick tested done. Took them out in disgust, since this was to be the desert I'm taking to a Christmas party. Started writing a 1 star review, but then I sliced and tasted. Delicious, in spite of being burned.  So....... 1 star for appearance and recipe trustworthiness (because the specified cooking time would have yielded something that looks like charcoal) and 5 stars for taste.

DLISHUSH!!! The best banana nut bread that I've had the pleasure of eating. My co-workers think so too as a took two loaves to work last night.  We all enjoyed them completely. And you're right, they are bugging for more.  I will definitely give them the recipe and also show them where to find the recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

I gave the bread two stars because it has a great taste. However, it does not rise and it is way to dark. It looks like a rectangular disaster.  Not happy at all will never use this recipe again.

I've been using this recipe for several years and I love it. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1 tsp allspice. I used nearly 2 cups of pecans instead of walnuts. I also did things a bit differently by first beating the bananas until they were completely smooth. Then I creamed the butter and sugar and added the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. I baked it for 55 minutes, then took it out, checked it, covered with foil, and baked for another 15 minutes.

A very dense flavorful banana bread. I would make this again but I would definitely cut the sugar in half. It was VERY sweet , too sweet for my liking. Ripe bananas are already very sweet.  I did add 1 tsp vanilla and used only 3 eggs.......delicious!

Horrible, thought I would try something different than the recipe I usually use but I won't make that mistake again. Did not rise either. It's making me select a rating so it's not really even a 1.

I've been looking for a great recipe for banana nut bread and this recipe did not disappoint me. My goodness it's great. I will always use this one from now on. I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the recipe and that did the trick for me. I printed the recipe for my coworkers and they are going to make it too. We have found nothing like it. It's perfect. Thanks for sharing your mom's recipe.

This is not a bad recipe, but it needs some help, IMO.  First I cut back the sugar by half a cup. I also doubled the walnuts.  I added a quarter tsp of vanilla and half a tsp of ground cardamom.  Next time I'll double both of those things and add a tsp of cinnamon as well and I think this will be perfect.  As written though, it's a bit bland for my tastes, but it is really moist and it has a nice crumb.

A Winner!  Every time I make it, people love it and are asking for the recipe.  I have also tried two variations which are a hit as well.  For both, I use pecans instead of walnuts because I prefer the taste. For the first version, I add 1 cup of butterscotch chips.  For the second version, I use coconut flour instead of all-purpose flour, and I add 1 cup of dark chocolate chips.

I don't know why this is called "NBNB" when it uses half the amount of bananas from any other recipe that I've used. Also tasteless. I had to add more bananas,vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg. Also the egg amount is double of any other banana bread. So it feels more like a cake.

I've made this recipe more times than I can count!  It doesn't fall in the healthy cooking  category but it does fall in the delicious and simple one!  A great use for the bananas I forgot I bought.  I  usually double batch and then freeze for later.  Great recipe with no changes needed!

This was SO good!! I was actually making for someone else, but made two extra loaves for me and my husband. Big mistake! We ate half of one loaf and he took the other half to work, while I'm at home trying not to eat the other loaf! The only thing I did differently was add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Delicious...will DEFINITELY make again and SOON!!

I have made this about 10-12 times just as written. EXCELLENT!  I have tried some of the little additions others have suggested (vanilla/cinnamon/etc.).  Nope!  I always return to the original recipe.  Do not try to mess with the original recipe. The original gives the option of brown or white sugar. I find doing half and half of each is the best.  It freezes well, but I cut the loaves in half for freezing. (Hides better from nighttime hungers LOL).

I gave it a 4 stars. The recipe was well written, easy to follow that anyone can make this banana bread, I made a half recipe while adding  a little  cinnamon,  little extra walnuts. I didn't have a problem with it the bread rising, loved the smell of the bread baking, smelled my home for hours lol,  I checked bread half way baking to make sure it's not burning(I had issues in the pass using recipes and they come out over cooked) I like my bread moist.  Taste is definitely delicious!

I only gave it a 3 because I haven't tasted it yet.  I had a problem with it not rising like other banana bread recipes I've made in the past do. It isn't pretty but we'll see what it tastes like. It sure smells good!

I made this exactly as the recipe says baked it for only 40 minutes though on 350 degrees and it was the best banana bread I have ever eaten or made.  It browned on top to perfection.

Well, I can't say I wasn't warned..... the submitter of this recipe gave a health warning.  I made no changes to this recipe and after having a slice I had heartburn for over an hour.  There is just too much butter in the recipe, too much isn't better.....it's just too much!  When I inverted the pans to put the loaves on a rack, my hands were greasy with butter.  I do use butter straight from a farm dairy so it has a very high fat content more like European butter.  The butter also masked the "flavor" of the bananas.  The loaves were heavy, probably a pound and a half each.  My husband liked it but then he loves anything baked and the greasier the better with no ill effects.  
I will try it again sometime but will cut the butter to one cube and use 1/2 cup less sugar.  Someone complained that the loaf didn't rise like a normal nut bread, again I think it's because of the butter content, mine lacked that "dome" shaped top too.

I love the flavor of this.  My biggest disappointment was the fact that this didn't rise.  Also the directions to add the wet to the dry didn't make sense to me.  I did it in reverse.  It blended well that way.  I was surprised that there was no vanilla in it.  I added vanilla.  If I make this again I will add other spices to it and use baking powder instead of baking soda to see if I can get it to rise.

Amazing! This is the real deal.  I follow the recipe exactly using a 9x9 pan in the convection toaster oven and it comes out perfect every time. My coworker asked me to bake some so he could use it in a fight with his mother in law about cooking. I did, because I'm petty and can think of no better compliment!

This is by far the best banana bread recipe I've made. I always add a cup and a half of chocolate chips to this along with the cup of chopped walnuts I let it sit in Saran Wrap over night in the fridge and slice it the next day. Everyone I've made this for loves it. So dense and moist and yummy! Make it!

I used 1 cup of unrefined coconut oil (smells like coconut) instead of 1 cup of butter, and added a tsp of vanilla.  
Best Banana Nut Bread I've ever had, can't wait to make them again.

This is an okay bread.  It is, as stated in the intro, very dense.  It is also a bit dry and bland for banana nut bread.  I did add a teaspoon of vanilla, which I think helped a bit, but I don't think I will keep this recipe.  There are others that seems they may taste, at least a little bit better.

I'm confused....?? How can you rate a recipe a 5 stars and you completely change the "WHOLE" recipe??? Doesn't that mean you didn't like it as is?  As for me.....I've made this recipe 3x  "completely as is" and it is great!! My husband  and other family  members devour it.  I can't keep it in the fridge!!  It will be my banana bread recipe from now on.....I have it memorized now. Lol

This is a great recipe.  I made it for a school function and everyone loved it. The only thing I would change is  maybe reduce the sugar to 1 and 1/2  cups instead of 2 cups. I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon.

I am getting ready to make the Nut Bread today. My goal before I got here was to find a recipe that was full on rich and good. If I make something I don't want diet this, and low fat that. I can buy that in the store.  This looks yummy!!! Thanks.

I have made this recipe many times over the last year or so and it is truly my favorite banana bread recipe. I have always noticed the center sinks in, so when I made this recipe last night, I decided to add the recommended 1/2tsp of baking powder but this made no difference in the rising. It still sunk in the center. Regardless, the intense banana flavor and nice dense texture makes this bread absolutely fantastic!

I can't beat my family away while I'm making this bread and letting it cool. I slept late afternoon waiting for a loaf to cool cause the other two were wrapped already, and when I woke up at 6:24 to tart dinner half the loaf was gone. So my husband called my  19 year old son  out of his room and asked him why he took such a big slice! He said he didn't,  he said he started with one small slice, then went back for another small slice, then another and another, he asked dad if mom put crack in the bread or something? Because you can't stop eating it. And I made this with bananas from Christmas. I was with the homeless Christmas Day and after all we're fed I was offered a case of really ripe bananas and I said what do I do with them, they said you freeze them then use them later! I never knew that! No more over ripe bananas will be chucked in my house ever again! This EBNB is to die for my family says. I told them it's very unhealthy so don't expect it often.

I thought this bread a bit bland.  It needed a few spices.  I'll tweek it next time.  Also  it was too dense and dried out  quickly.  I'll try adding some oil or apple sauce.  It's worth a second try.

Made as written. It didn't rise at all, had an inverted top so perhaps it was the altitude (Denver area) or it needs a little boost of powder. I planned to give one of the two loaves away but didn't because they looked sad :/ The taste is much better the second day as noted and very moist. Although certainly flavorful, it was more cookie bar than bread in my attempt. Will try again the next time I have extra bananas :)

This was pretty scrumptious. I liked it.
I had to change it up one time so this is what I did on a double up...

    4 cups all-purpose flour...
    2 teaspoon salt....
    4 teaspoons baking soda...
    2 cups unsalted butter...

    4 cups white sugar....
  (  1 1/2  cups mashed overripe bananas  ).....
  (  2 Cups fresh Pumpkin mash ).....
 (( 1/2 cup of oranges - (6 mandarins - no rinds)))....
       5 eggs, beaten..(not 8)

Followed Extreme Banana Bread recipe. It took nearly 95 minutes in my gas oven as I put it all into one very large loaf pan.   13x9x2"
33x22.9x5.08 cm for my Canadian Friends

One of two things are wrong with this recipe.....it's either not meant to make 2 loaves or is it missing 2 cups of flour!!
I made it according to recipe and the batter was like water! Added 2 more cups of flour and it worked perfectly.
Also, I used all brown sugar and when I baked it I always make sure to put a pan of water in the oven while they bake, creates lots of steams and no dry bread :)

I made this with no substitutions other than half of the sugar I used brown sugar.  I only left them in the oven for 50 minutes and they were very overdone, to the point of being dried out.  It's probably a good recipe, but be sure to check the bread well before the 60-70 recommended minutes.

Loved this recipe.  I did follow another suggestion with greasing the pans with Crisco and instead of flour, use cinnamon and sugar for the coating. But the ingredients are perfect, don't need to change a thing. Moist and delicious. I made 5 mini loaves, baked for 50 minutes.  Thank you for the recipe,

I only gave this four stars because with the name Extreme Banana Nut Bread I expected to experience an amazing loaf.  Although a good recipe it is just plain old banana bread - nothing special about it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The flavor is good but by no means extreme, It is moist  and it is easy to prep and bake.

I did not modify the instructions or the ingredients, made as written.  The taste was really good with the banana flavor.  The loaf didn't rise very much and was too moist.  I know the baking soda I used was fresh and the eggs used were large (whipped really good for a good rise in the bread).  I will play around with the ingredients as the flavor was good.

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would.  It was one of the first recipes I made from this site.  It has been a big hit not only at home but when I bring it - anywhere!  I love making it for friends as well as my family.   This recipe was just what I had been looking for.  I will no longer buy the "box" of banana bread mixes ever again.  They pale in comparison.

I omitted the walnuts; and per suggestions used 1 c brown sugar and 1 c white.  I also added some vanilla and cinnamon.  Baked it in one large bread pan for about 55 minutes, then because it was getting pretty dark but was still not baked through, I put tinfoil over it and baked it for another 10 minutes.  I'm absolutely over the moon happy with the results.  Next time I will add raisins - but it's absolutely delicious as is.  I will definitely make this again.  Frequently!

I have made tons of banana bread recipes and this is the best ever.  The Crust is crispy and gets very brown.  The middle is really moist but cooked all the way through which I have found, is difficult to find a recipe that does that.   This will be my "go to recipe" from now on

By far the best recipe I've come across yet.  Very dense and moist.  I have people  bring me their over ripe bananas to make it for them now.  And forwarded the recipe to a few people at work.  Everyone who has tried it states it's the best they've had.  Thank you for sharing!!

First it is important to note that I hate sweets - have sugar, I'm out but made this for my wife and my daughters family because we had bananas past retirement. Did sub pecans for walnuts because I just moved to Texas (duh). I took a small bite because I NEVER serve anything to others before tasting. Very good banana nut bread! Instructions could be a little cleaner.

I made this recipe with few changes.  I was short about 1 banana but had 1 soft pear, I also substituted margarine with unsalted butter and added 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Very moist and huge hit wth my picky husband.will make again.  Thanks for sharing family recipe.

I made it as written, I blended my bananas first then added everything else to it one at a time ending with the flour, plus a splash of my secret ingredient it was amazing. I actually sale these at my church and job, I sale out every time.

I will definitely make it again.  This was the best baked goodie to come out of my lopsided oven in a year and a half.  It could be because I used butter, not oil, in all my previous recipes.

Good gracious this is amazing!  I changed/added a few things, but the bones are still there.  I subbed applesauce for 1/2 the butter, added cinnamon and nutmeg, coated the loaf pans with cinnamon sugar, sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top, and added toasted pecans to 1 loaf (this made 2.) The finished product was rather Bananas Foster-esque, and wonderful  Everyone loved it.

Excellent, excellent, excellent.  Took Naples suggestion and creamed the butter and sugar until light and fluffy; it makes a difference IMO.
I doubled the recipe as I was making for gifts.  Next time I will split the sugar between white and brown.  A very good recipe for banana bread.  Thanks!

This bread is awesome!  I make it just like the recipe except I bake it in mini loaf pans.  The only problem, if you can call it a problem, is that as soon as my family smells it - it is gone!

No changes made to recipe.  Disappeared so fast.  Everyone that got a slice, at work, loved it.   Super moist, great flavor.  Definitely will be making this again soon.

This won't rise up very much so don't expect two full, puffy  loaves in two standard 9x5 pans. But that's ok! And keep an eye on the baking time-mine were done and were starting to develop a slightly burnt edge after 40 minutes. 

I followed the advice of some other reviewers: added a dash of ground cloves, a bit of cinnamon, half a teaspoon of baking powder, and I split the sugar between brown sugar and white sugar. The result was moist and SO delicious. Will definitely use this recipe again!

PERFECTION!  I have to agree...finally a banana bread that is what banana bread is supposed to be!  This rivals my Great Grandma Jenny's old old recipe...possibly better.  

I also have to agree that it is addictive, and is going to lead to trouble lol.

I used bananas that were more black/brown than yellow skin, made sure they were mashed very well. I made it using Pillsbury's Gluten Free flour blend - used the same measurements for the flour and everything else.  I used individual loaf pans, since I am the only one in the house who must be wheat-free.  Waiting until the stove was pre-heated, then added the dry ingredients to the wet, stirred only enough to get everything moist.  It turned out very well for a gluten-free product.

Forgot to add the vanilla and cinnamon as suggested but I don't think it needs even one tiny change. I did cook it for only 55 minutes as others recommended and it was perfecto.  I just ate both crispy ends off of one loaf. Yum!

I've made this banana bread a few times and used 3x8 disposable pans, they turn out perfect, moist, and all around delicious! I'm making it again, but only had 3 eggs, and no baking soda so I used powder, and baking in a cake pan, I hope it turns out as delicious as the exact recipe does!

I made the recipe as listed and the bread was good, but not great. After reading the reviews, I added cinnamon, vanilla, substituted sugar for dark brown sugar at the recommended 3:1 ratio, and a half cup of crushed pineapple. The bread was fantastic and moist.

I have made this bread several times.  Super moist rich in flavor.   
Great for anytime of the day.   Follow the directions and put it in the frig.  For some reason that makes a huge difference.   They flavor really comes thru.   Note to self, don't over bake it.  Its easy to do because the bread is dark to begin with.  Enjoy!!!

This turned out great. It was moist and very flavorful. I did add a generous teaspoon of vanilla extract. One of my loaf pans is glass and the other is metal. I know from experience that items baked in glass become over-baked and dry if I use the temperature stated in a recipe, so I used two different ovens and set the temperature 25 degrees cooler (325 degrees) for the glass pan. They were both ready in one hour. This will be my new go-to banana bread recipe.

I would definitely make this again.  I used 4 bananas, like the video version instructed.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla.  I kept it classic and still used walnuts.  I had absolutely no problems.  Does this bread rise so it's light and fluffy like what you'd buy in a grocery store to make a sandwich on?  NO.  Absolutely not.  It doesn't rise a ton, but it does rise a little.  And that's ok.  This is a breakfast/snack/dessert bread.  It's not going to act like other breads because its purpose is different.  I fully enjoyed it (I think a big part of the secret is the butter ;o), and I consistently got responses from the people I work with that it was delicious.  I have absolutely no complaints here.  This is a great banana nut bread.  I deducted a star only because I feel the original recipe does lack a little instruction.  I'd really give it 4.5 stars, but that's not allowed.

I looked this recipe up years ago and since then I have made it at least 20 times (no kidding). Everyone that I have ever made it for raves about it; this bread never fails to be a hit. I do alter it slightly. Some of the changes I make are:
-I prefer to use pecans instead of walnuts 
-I always add chocolate chips 
-I add a twist of lemon to the mashed bananas and I always put in more bananas than the recipe calls for
-I substitute half the sugar for brown sugar and add a little extra salt
-I beat the eggs with the butter, sugars, vanilla and salt. Then I add the chocolate chips and nuts to the flour and baking soda before adding that into the wet. Once it is all combined I add in the bananas last.
Serve this as is, with powdered sugar or a scoop of vanilla ice cream! You can wrap it up tightly in plastic wrap and then a ziploc bag and it stores well in the freezer. That is, if you have any extra  ;)

We used Hudson Cream Self-Rising Flour and cut out the salt and baking powder. Use really, really ripe bananas and mash them and stir them up to a gravy-like goodness. We've made this at least a dozen times :)

I've made this bread a few times, it gets better every time. The family absolutely loves it! The only thing I've made an adjustment on, instead of using just flour in the pan, I use a cinnamon and sugar blend to coat the pan and it adds a nice crust that's sweet to the bread.

Bake this for only 70 minutes, not the 80 minutes that recipe calls for.   Fantastic!  I make bread on Sat mornings for my men's discipleship group and this one got a "thumbs up".

This is the recipe I followed to make banana nut bread for the first time ever!  I didn't have enough bananas for the full recipe, so I just made one loaf.  I'm so proud of myself.  It is an easy recipe to follow and I will definitely be making more!

I used half peanut butter, extra chunky, and half coconut oil in place of the butter. I used half brown sugar and half white. I also added a teaspoon of baking powder and a teaspoon of cinnamon. It works well. I also baked them into muffins instead of loaves. Yum. They really are hazardous in the house.

I've made this several times now and it's totally the perfect banana bread. Someone said it didn't rise right so I added a tsp of baking powder.  I creamed the sugar, butter, and bananas together in the stand mixer, added the eggs and ran it again until they disappeared, then added the dry ingredients. Today I added a cup of chopped dates, last time I added a cup of fresh blueberries.  I've taken this to parties and it has outshone much fancier desserts.  This one is a winner folks. It also freezes well so that second loaf  can just be wrapped in foil and saved for later. It might even be a little bit better after it's been frozen a while.

Exactly the recipe I was hoping to find.  I added some chocolate chips as well, though not necessary!  The only reason I didn't do 5 stars was because the cooking time was off.  I usually rely on the smell test when it comes to baking, but with the bananas it was hard to rely on that.  At 59 mins it was way over baked.  So just pay attn to the time and check it at maybe 50 mins.  It was not burnt but the crust was too hard.

I'm not sure how to rate this.  It's very dense, did not rise at all, but moist.  It's not sweet at all.  And really not very banana-y tasting.  I did modify a bit according to other reviewer's suggestions, including 1/2 tsp baking powder (it didn't rise for other reviewers), 1 tsp. vanilla, and 2 tsp. cinnamon.  I also split the sugar, 1 cup packed brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar.  It was good, but not at all what I expected, more savory than sweet.

I make bnb ALL. THE. TIME. Old bananas end up in my freezer like many others said. I followed is recipe almost exactly but I used 1/2 tsp salt since I had salt added butter. I also put the whole batch into a bundt pan and baked at 300 for 70 min. It came out perfect and my husband commented that it was the best I had made ever! I'll be sticking with this recipe from now on.

Worst banana nut bread ever. It didn't rise. I compared the recipe with many others and this one calls for twice as many eggs and baking soda.

Recipe is great! Although I will use 1 1/2 cups of sugar next time (for my taste).  I sifted the mixture, so the texture was great. It was an easy recipe, moist and delicious!

I have made this several times and it is wonderful.  I save over ripe bananas by mashing them and putting in the freezer until I have enough to make this.  My husband thinks it is the best treat ever. We eat one loaf and slice and freeze the other for later. It is so moist and tasty.

Followed to the T.. EXCEPT:
1) added to the wet ingredients: 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. AND instead of 2 cups white sugar, I did 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar.
2) added to the dry ingredients: 1/2 tsp baking powder (If you don't have baking powder, combine 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar plus 1/4 teaspoon baking soda for every 1 teaspoon of baking powder.)
3) delish!

I did make a few changes: I made it in a 13x9, I added cinnamon and had no nuts.  I also used brown sugar and whole wheat flour.  I will make it again!!!  My husband and I loved it and the whole house smells so fragrant!!!!!  It's a keeper!!!

My kids didn't want to wait for the bananas to get overripe like I thought they had to be for decent banana bread but this turned out incredible anyway! Deep golden through and through - not grayish like some - and oh so yummy! Moist inside with a crispy crust. Two loaves gone in one afternoon!

such a great tasting bread could deffiently beat the ones in the supermarket. I would say the only changes I would make is to lower the 2 cups of butter , down to one, it's too butterly that the only complaint other then that's it's delicious !

Seriously delicious, old fashioned, moist, dense-and did I say delicious?!-banana nutbread!!!I am not kidding. ..if you want a "high rising, low fat, diet friendly" recipe keep looking because this could not be further from the recipes that substitute apple sauce for fat.. I absolutely love this recipe...with the addition of some vanilla and cinnamon and substituting dark brown sugar for half the granulated sugar it hits all the notes for me.  In short I believe this comes the closest to the banana nut bread that my southern momma used to make.

I've made this recipe twice now. I added extra bananas and used both walnuts and pecans. The bread doesn't even make it out of the pan I just stick a fork in it and it's gone within 2 days. I did add a smidgen of vanilla extract.

First time making a banana nut bread and we are so thrilled! It tasted so good and will definitely make it again.  Added 1 tsp of vannilla extract, cinnamon, baking powder as recommended by others here. I also used brown sugar instead of white and sprinkled some cinnamon and sugar on the greased pan and baked it for 40 mins, then covered it with the foil  like others recommended and baked it for another 15 mins.

HIGH ALTITUDE - I live in CO, so to combat the altitude, I add an additional egg white, a little bit more flour (1-2 tb), and bake a little hotter for a little less time (~55-60 min at 375', turn it down if the top is browning too much). I also go slightly over on the amount of banana to keep things moist. 

For flavor, I usually add a half tsp of cinnamon and 1-1.5 cups chocolate chips to the entire batter. For my loaf (half the batter), I also add .5 cups pecans and .5  dried cranberries. Yum!

I've made this several times now, in pretty huge batches because it vanishes almost instantly. I swapped out a tiny bit of banana for a can of crushed pineapple once and it went over really well too. Definitely my favorite recipe.

This bread is amazing! I made it exactly like the recipe instructions. The only thingI would change next time (and there will be a next time)is I would cut down on the sugar. I have a very sweet tooth but found it woul be even better with maybe 1 1/2 cup sugar instead of 2.

I decreased the sugar to 1 3/4 cups, and increased bananas to 2 1/4 cups with great results. Great banana flavor. Will definitely make again.

I don't make banana bread often but this was good. The only thing I changed was omitting the nuts. We (2 adults) ate  the 2 loaves in 1 week. It got better with age.

So moist and fluffy! I made a few tweaks to it. I've actually followed this recipe 3 times, and this time, I had to double the batch because it always runs out so quickly! I used whole wheat flower instead of regular white flower, and instead of doubling the salt, I actually lowered it a teeny bit, because my father has heart problems. But boy has he got a sweet tooth! He loves it, and so does everyone else in my house! Can't wait to put it in the toaster with some butter!

I love this recipe I have been making it for about 4 years now I have changed it a few times I have deleted the nuts and added.chocolate  but do not mix them in just drop on top they will work thier way down and the same if you use nuts and I do not use the flour in the loaf pan I use wax paper and they just fall out then when it's still hot like 5 mins cooling then remove the paper because with the chocolate it really sticks to the pan and they are very hard to remove. I have even made it larger like one cup of flour  more with 1 tsp more baking soda with 1 more cup of banana and 1/2 cup sugar and 1/4 stick more butter.  So change it up and play with it very friendly recipe. Just remember it might not come how you want it but your mistakes still taste great

Only changes I made, was doubling the recipe (SSSSOOOO GLAD I DID) and added a smidgen of vanilla extract.     Otherwise, I followed to the "T"  DELICIOUS!!!  My best banana nut bread EVER!!!  

I am reading the reviews.......some say blob of floiur in the middle....didn't rise right......etc...   I think the instructions were perfect!!  If people are having problems wit the mixture, I would say to turn your blender on low BEFORE adding eggs and bananas.  It allows it all to mix better.  And as for not rising.......   I'm reading that this is a DENSE banana nut bread.  It's NOT going to rise much!!  

I have to give a 5 star rating!!  So glad I stumbled across it!!

I made some adjustments in adding vanilla, cinnamon, ginger & allspice.  Very flavorful.  It's way to greasy!  I baked the bread at 325 knowing my oven bakes a little hot, after 35 minutes, I was shocked at how dark it was. It did not taste burned, actually had a crispy top that was good.  It did sink in the middle.

It tastes amazing, but mine always SINK big time in the middle! HELP! I live at about 7,000ft altitude so it probably has something to do with that.

Stop looking for banana nut bread recipes - this one is a keeper! I followed the modified instructions posted by Virginia Sista.  I mixed the butter and sugar (half brown sugar and half white sugar), then eggs one at a time, then banana. I used 4 very ripe, blacked skinned bananas. Then added a bit of vanilla. Finally adding my dry ingredients to the mix, with a little cinnamon as well.  Lastly, I added the chopped nuts (pecans and not walnuts). I lined my 2 bread pans with wax or parchment paper, so the dense/sticky bread comes out of the pan easier. Cooked at 340 for 65 mins. It came out perfect. Better on day 2!

I would give this 4.5 stars. I did make the adjustments others noted - used half white /half brown sugar and added 1tsp each cinnamon, baking powder and vanilla. I was afraid it would be too sweet, but it wasn't. Will definitely make this again.

I have made this a few times and the only change I've made is I added half a cup of sour creme.

I admit I added baking soda and cinnamon to the basic recipe, after reading the reviews which said that it didn't rise and tasted flat.  I also threw some raisins in, and used half brown sugar and half white.  It did rise, but only up to flat, not rounded, and I took it out at 45 minutes because the edges were burning which left the center pretty soggy.  It looks bad and I wouldn't give it as a present.  Nevertheless it's delicious and I'd make it again, probably with more flour and less sugar.  I think this is a recipe that needs to be played with to get it the way that works for you and your oven.

This is very similar to a recipe I've used for the last 20 years. My recipe doesn't include salt and has an extra 1/2 cup flour. But yes, it is the most moist, delicious banana bread ever!

I made this twice and both times the loaves didn't rise.  The first batch burned to a crisp.  I chalked it up to me being out of practice; however, when I checked the second batch more than half way through baking, to be sure I didn't burn it again, it too, had sunken in and had started to burn.  I compared this recipe to my old tried and true recipes from the past and I believe the most important ingredient had been left out of this recipe - baking powder.  I really wanted to love this recipe because I love this app.

Fabulous flavor! Truly addictive and unhealthy, but awesome treat for the holidays. I used pecans rather than walnuts, and I coated the greased pan with cinnamon & sugar, as suggested by another reviewer.  People are already asking for more, lol.

I'm about to make this recipe for the 3rd time.  In my opinion, it's the best recipe for BNB I've ever used. The one cup of butter really bothered me, so I use 1/2 c butter, 1/4 c applesauce, & 1/4 c coconut oil. Works great. When I'm short on bananas, I've added pears or apples. The recipe is very forgiving. Thank you for sharing

I followed the recipe with the exception of substituting pecans for the walnuts.  The result was a dense bread, full of flavor.  This is the banana bread I will be making from now on; it's a winner!

I use pecans instead of walnuts, and for a healthier twist, a stevia baking blend instead of white sugar (use 1/2 the amount called for in recipe).  This recipe is ALWAYS a big hit - I've been making this for 3 years!!

Simple easy recipe . My husband said it's the  best banana nut bread he has ever had.  I would have liked to see  more detail instructions. ie. should the butter be used cold, softened, melted?  I will try next time the suggestion of sugar and cinnamon in the pan from one of the other reviewers.  Also, my bread did not rise much but  I think it's normal since in the description it did say this is a dense bread. Thank you for the recipe.

Great recipe!  I made one loaf and eight mini loaves to give away.  All turned out excellent.  I did add 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, as someone suggested.  I couldn't wait for it to cool off...so yummy!

Finally found a recipe that makes banana bread like my mom used to make. Delicious! I didn't change a thing (oops I did omit the nuts for health issues). I've made it quite a few times already. My husband, kids and grand kids all love it! Thank you for sharing you're Extreme Banana Bread recipe!

Made it exactly as stated besides adding one tsp of vanilla.  Very good! Very sweet and buttery and dense.  I would make again but looking for a lighter version that doesn't make me feel so guilty!

I halved the recipe to make one loaf.  I added 1/4 teaspoon baking powder per a previous review.  I added pecans instead of walnuts.  I has so pleased.  This is a very good tasting bread and not as dense and heavy as others I have tried.

I have only made this one time but it was absolutely fabulous.  The only minor change was pecans for walnuts.  It was moist and had a fantastic taste.  I am printing today to make again with some sad little bananas I have on my counter top.  Everyone who tried it loved it.  I froze one loaf because I couldn't be trusted with it just laying around ready to eat.  But it didn't stay frozen for long.  Very good recipe.

Awesome flavor and smells amazing! The best banana bread I have ever had! The only reason I did not rate this five stars, is that it is not a very pretty loaf. It doesn't rise much and bakes up flat on the top...other then that, it is excellent!

Excellent banana bread!  I was a bit concerned when taking it out of the oven because the crust was darker than what I was anticipating, but it perfect.  Followed the directions exactly and had no problems at all.  The crust had a nice little  crunch and the interior was moist and tender.  Absolutely delicious! This is my go-to recipe for banana bread from here on out.

Loved this recipe. I halved the recipe and took some suggestions from other reviews and added a teaspoon of cinnamon and half cup brown sugar/half a cup white. I also substituted dried cranberries in lieu of nuts as I did not have any on hand. I also made muffins in lieu of loaves. Baked in lined muffin cups at 325 (gas oven that has high heat) for about 35 minutes. Turned out great!

I made this one last night and it is yummy!! Lots of reviews on how to change up the recipe. I made it as shown substituting only walnuts for pecans due to items on hand (i only had enough bananas for 1 loaf so I halved the recipe since it makes two) and it is DELICIOUS! My boyfriend always buys banana nut bread from a group that comes by his store and he said he won't be able to buy it anymore because this EBNB was so great! I do recommend!! I will concur with some others in regard to watching cooking time. I think this is pretty common based on ovens and such, but my one loaf (could also make a difference) only took about 45 minutes.

I think what does it for this recipe is a whole lot of butter and whole lot of bananas in it.  It is wonderful and I'm definitely going to make it again.

I used to eat Elfin Loaves (mini banana bread loaves, not made anymore) by Keebler in my school lunches when I was a kid, and THIS recipe mimics almost the exact taste and texture of those mini loaves, which is so neat!

I used five very sugary meduim sized bananas.  I also used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup light brown sugar.  

I didn't use any nuts in the batter because I don't like them.  I have a heavy duty aluminum mini loaf pan and was able to fill all 8 wells halfway, and they rose beautifully in the oven.  At the same time, I put the leftover batter in a well buttered 8 inch cast iron skillet, and topped it with some pecans, as my mom likes nuts.  It didn't rise as well in the cast iron and baked much, much darker than in the aluminum...but it's still very moist and still got rave reviews and I'm sure I'll have to make this again.

Excellent recipe, thanks so much!!!

This is by far the absolute very best most awesome banana bread!  I buy bananas to overripen just to make it!  I made the change of adding 1/2 tsp of baking powder...but that's it!  

I've been short on bananas and have added applesauce or canned pumpkin to bring to the exact fruit measurement...have added chocolate chips, coconut...make little bears and hearts for my kids...it's the bubba gump of recipes to add try and they are all delish!

This is so delicious. The crust is out of this world! I make it with coconut oil (which is in liquid form- much easier to mix) and Pamela's Gluten Free Baking and Pancake Mix instead of flour.  I've made it probably 20 times and I think it has better texture when I mix it by hand.  I've had so many people ask for the recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing this!

This Banana Nut Bread is so easy,  you don't even need to drag out the hand mixer. It's almost as easy as a boxed mix, but NOTHING beats the homemade fresh baked flavor.  It a winner!!!

I would defiantly be doing this often. Best flavor ever. Super moist and just unresistable.  I did not change anything on this recipe.  It's perfect just the way it is!

To say this recipe for banana nut bread is "spectacular" is truly an understatement. To eat a slice of this (or a muffin, which I like to make--bake for 30 minutes instead) hot from the oven is to hear the angels sing, to rethink your existence on this planet, to marvel at the goodness of the universe. Seriously, this recipe is a game-changer. I.kid.you.not. I am a foodie with a serious food blog. I've probably made banana nut bread more times than you have made a hamburger. This is the one--the single most amazing recipe that will tame screaming kids and make potential mates fall in love with you immediately. Save this recipe to the food hall of fame. I don't want to analyze it--is it the extra butter? The extra walnuts? Don't know, don't care--but you must try this and hoard this recipe as it IS a bit of magic you can use to create a small piece of happiness.

This banana bread is AMAZING! I think I left it in a little too long (the 60 min the recipe called for) and they are really brown...so I would recommend 50 minutes and then go from there.

Oh my wow!  Made the recipe, as is, using the half white, half brown sugar option.  Changed nothing.  It is perfectly moist and dense, plenty of nutty, banana goodne s and is great warm or cold. This truly is the moist,  delicious banana nut bread I have been looking for!  I will make it again and again.  And yes, self restraint is required.

Ok the taste is very good however I cooked this at the correct temperature and put in oven and set timer for 45 minutes and it came out way over cooked not sure if I did something wrong or what but I was really disappointed because I was making for company coming over. And yes I am absolutly positive the oven temp and timer were correct I always triple check espeacially when baking bread and cakes.

I liked the flavor of this bread, however, the recipe seems to be a bit off. I baked these in a 350 oven for 40 minutes and they were done. Had I baked them the 60-70 minutes called for, they would have been toast! 
Beyond the incorrect timing for this recipe, I felt that it was missing something so I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the mixture. I also noticed that this bread did not rise much, if at all. Though most banana bread is dense, I felt this recipe was more so than normal and not in a good way. Like I said, the flavor was good but it needs a bit of tweaking in order to be a rock star recipe.

I created an account just so I can review this recipe! I felt I had to since I have made this banana bread just about 102 times since finding it in November 2012! This is the best banana recipe I have ever made. If you're expecting a "bread" then this is not for you. It is in no way airy or light. This is more of a dense bread very rich and moist if done correctly. I always make one loaf at a time since my oven doesn't distribute heat evenly. I add in vanilla and use 3/4 C. white sugar and 1/4 C. light brown sugar. I follow "Virginia Sista's" recommended steps. Like I said I have made this well over 100 times, and it's perfect every time! Sometimes I buy extra bananas at the grocery store (knowing we won't eat them all) to have an excuse to make banana bread! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Does not raise properly.  Adding brown sugar makes the loaf taste burnt and I only added half a cup. Cannot recommend.

This is the only Banana Nut Bread recipe I will ever use again.  No, it doesn't rise like a bread, but I'm totally okay with that, because the taste is amazing.  In fact, we picked off the crunchy top while trying to wait for it to cool, and it occurred this might make wonderfully delicious cookies.   I've made it twice now, both times with no changes to the above recipe, and it was still delightfully delectable.    Start checking it at 55 min though.

This is THE BEST, MOST DECADENT, YUMMY Banana Nut Bread, EVER!!! My family loves it, and my spouse hides it from the kids - LOL Enjoy! I even make it with 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour, and 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and it's a huge hit. Do keep an eye on baking time, as I found it didn't take as long as the recipe says (maybe 40-45 minutes for me)

My loaves are cooling at the moment, but I had to try a taste as soon as one was cool enough to cut into.  These were exactly as Saseigel stated.  Delicious taste and texture.  I added a splash of vanilla, but otherwise made the recipe as directed.  My loaves were pretty level and not domed up as other banana bread recipes I have made in the past, but who cares?  They tasted fantastic and that was what I was after. I wonder if some of the criticism about falling in the middle might be the fault of the baker's oven.  Not all ovens are created equal and some have hot and cool spots and some are not even close to the temperature they are set to.  An oven thermometer will help you see if that might be a general problem with any baking project. Thank you for sharing this great recipe.  I will be making it often in the future. Mine were done is a little less than one hour.

This recipe was so good! I made half the batch (ie. one loaf pan only) and I used half white and half brown sugar, and added 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp cinnamon. I used walnuts, as the recipe suggested. It was so delicious, and would probably be even better toasted. I shared it around at work and only received positive responses (despite asking for critical feedback!) 

I made sure to incorporate each ingredient well before adding the next, starting with wet and then adding the dry. The result was smooth and consistent thanks to Virginia Sista's suggestions!
I also baked the loaf at 350 F for 55 minutes and the knife came out clean at that point. It was the perfect moistness, and I refrigerated in foil overnight after about 1.5 hours of cooling on the benchtop. It was great the next day at work - didn't dry out!

Thank you to everyone who gave tried and tested reviews! This banana bread was killer!

Really good. I prefer a sweeter banana bread which makes it closer to a cake and this delivers what I wanted. I cut the recipe in half and it worked fine. Substituted pecans for walnuts because that is what I had on hand.

I used half white and half brown on the sugar.
And you do need to mix very very well to break up the flour bombs but it came out without a problem.  A keeper recipe

Ridiculously amazing - dense, moist, addictive. I've made it several times and it has turned out perfect every time. I recently asked my husband why he wasn't eating the bananas and he said "I'm saving them so you'll make that banana bread!" At a condo rental, w/o a sifter, I discovered that a whisk does just as well. When we travel we either take the bread or the recipe!:)

The only thing I changed was using only 1/4cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I baked it on 350F for 45 min. Afterwards,I checked to see if it was baked all the way since some reviewers suggested that it might be too dry if baked too long. However, it was still not cooked inside so I wrapped foil on top and turn down to 325F and bake for another 10-15 min. The final result: it was really burnt, especial at the corners. My suggestion to bake on 325F for 60min.

Very good. Followed the recipe, however substituted 1 cup of sugar for brown sugar and used more walnuts (personal preference). I had no problems with the mix being dry.
I baked the bread for 65 minutes, but might need to bake it for 55 minutes as it came out slightly crisper than I'd have liked.

24 servings?   You have to be kidding!  We MIGHT get 8 slices per loaf, but that's because we are trying NOT to eat the entire loaf at ONCE!!!!  I guess we COULD slice each into 12 and just grab 2 or 3.   LOL   This is GREAT!!!

I love the flavor and moisture of this bread. I creamed butter, eggs, and mashed bananas, which i added to sifted dry. I used ¼ c less sugar. Great, as is, but pecans would be nice too.

Love this bread. I followed advice and substituted baking powder for soda and added some cinnamon and vanilla and a little applesauce. I give it five stars because I'm sure it would have been delicious even without the small tweaks.

Great recipe. Living in the Keys I tend to put a tropical spin on things so  quite often I add chocolate chips and coconut to the recipe just to add to the calorie count. If you're going to be bad, go all the way!  When baking, I usually save at least a few calories by substituting half the fat in a recipe with apple sauce. Works in almost everything.

I made this today since we were forced in doors. It is really good the
only thing was the timing was off, Mine was done in 33 minutes, my oven is not a great oven so it could be right for a normal oven,  but we all loved it. Thanks for sharing!!

This was good. I mean, it was fairly boring, all of the flavor came from the bananas and nuts, but I guess that's how banana nut bread is supposed to be (so my husband says, I've never made this before). Although if I do make it again, I think I'll be making the changes according to the number 1 commenter. By the way, for anyone curious, 2 cups of banana is about 4 1/2 regular-sized bananas. I wish someone had posted that before I bought the ingredients for this, because as I said, I'd never made this before so I had no clue how much 2 cups of bananas was, so I just guessed and bought five. Glad I did!

First time ever making Banana Bread.  I liked the high banana content, I used close to 2 1/2 cups(5 large banana's) and like others I added 1/2 tsp of baking powder.  Did it in reverse as I added the dry to the wet and blended thoroughly. I used 1/2 cup walnut and 1/2 cup pecan as well as I like both in my banana bread.  Had to cook for over 70 minutes, nice crusty outside and moist delicious inside.

This is the best banana nut bread recipe!  It is moist and delicious.  I have made it several times and this recipe is consistently good.  Everyone I make it for tell me I make the best banana nut breat.  It made easy Christmas gifts this past Christmas and everyone was happy to get it.  I did use 1 cup of light brown and 1 cup of white sugar for the 2 cups of sugar.  Also, I let it cool on a rack and then wrap the loafs in plastic wrap , then in tin foil.  Put in refrigerator for several hours before cutting.  It really makes a difference.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I have made this recipe twice now. The only thing I have done to it was sub pecans for walnuts and then when I mix the wet ingredients with dry I put a little hole in middle of dry and mix them together a little at a time. I made three big loaves the first time and it was gone the next day. My family absolutely loved it.

Just made this with my 3yr old. Super Duper Yummy!!!  I did beat the eggs separately with my electric beater though. Then, I mixed everything with my electric mixer. 60 to 70 minutes would have burned the ccakes (I made a dozen cupcakes and one 9" round cake), so i kept a close watch and removed cc at 50 and rc at 57 minutes.

I needed a fast and easy recipe and decided to try this one.
It was great!!! My husband asked for a second slice! He never does that! We sliced into it before it had time to cool. Soooo good. This isn't my first time making banana but bread but my first time with this recipe.
I'll be bookmarking this one, excellent on first try. 
With all the sugar I thought it was going to be too sweet but it was perfect.
I did use 1c white sugar and 1c light brown, also added a few dashes of cinnamon and 1 1/2tsp of vanilla.
Author is right you can change it up however you like, it's nearly fool proof and comes out great!!! Mine didn't come out as dense as I thought so I'm giving it 4 stars. Mine came out slightly on the lighter side which was great too

I just finished baking this bread. It isn't your typical light banana nut bread. I used half brown sugar/half white sugar and added a teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla as suggested by other bakers.  Because of the butter brown sugar combination there is a caramel crust on the top and sides of the bread which makes the outside chewy and very addicting! It's definitely a keeper.

I've made this recipe a couple of times now, and I LOVE it! I baked it in a 9×13 pan for convenience, and dusted it with a little powdered sugar. There's a pan in the oven now; and this time, I've added a cup of golden raisins...

I follow the directions exactly and it comes out perfect every time. I've used this recipe about 6 times so far. I love that is is dense and nutty and is delicious for breakfast. My family literally eats through a loaf and a half as it's cooling. Seriously, the BEST banana bread I have ever had. Thanks for sharing!

I halved the ingredients and made two loaves: 1.)one with butter and 2.) one with vegetable oil.
I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 12 packets truvia for each loaf (the conversion chart for truvia shows 12 packets = 1/2 cup sugar). As other reviewers did I used 1/2 tsp baking power, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp vanilla for EACH loaf. Baked at 335 for about 60-65 minutes checking frequently at the last 5 minutes mark. Anything made with both Truvia or Splenda needs to be baked longer and at a lower temp. 
The loaves turned out perfect. My significant other said they were great and that he loved that it was both dense and moist. He does not like an airy textured banana bread. I thought the oil was the better loaf taste and texture-wise.  
A note: Strangely, though the ingredients for both loaves were IDENTICAL in quantity and materials (excluding the fat= oil vs. butter), the butter loaf did not rise as high as the oil loaf and was significantly smaller. I measured each loaf's ingredients separately so there was no error in amount of ingredients per loaf. I am not sure why that happened but, again, the butter loaf simply came out significantly flatter than the oil loaf. Both were delicious.

I have made this bread so MANY times...just made it again today.  The only change I've made is substituting one cup of the white sugar with brown sugar.  People beg me for this recipe every single time I prepare it for friends, family or co-workers.  People cannot believe I found this on a recipe site.  They think it is an old family recipe.  Thanks to whomever posted this.  Awesome!

This recipe is great. The walnuts add great character to the bread. I would be careful with the amount of sugar used. I would put 1 cup first and then put more to taste. Also note that refrigerating it will make it dry. The best thing to do would be to make half the serving and try to eat it fast before it goes bad. Overall a very nice recipe...thank you!!

I have made this recipe over & over for my family member's..
We all love it!!!. The only thing about the recipe is I found you've got to leave it in the oven an extra 10 mins for it to completely rise..
Everyone begs me to make it, weather there's a special occasion or not!!!
Moist & delicious...

This recipe was very good!! this was my first attempt at making banana nut bread and it was a success! For the most part I followed the recipe while also taking advice from previous reviewers. Instead of 2cups of white sugar I use 1 cup of white and 1cup brown sugar. I also added 2tsp of vanilla but other than that it was terrific! My husband did not like banana nut bread but he does now lol

This has been the best I've come across. Instead of butter I used 8 oz of applesauce to be on the healthier side. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract for added flavor. It was super moist and just amazing.

This is the only banana nut bread recipe I have ever used! It was so good the first time that I never felt the need to stray away. I, too, added a touch of vanilla and I extend the baking time by about 15 minutes. Beautiful! Everyone calls it my 'famous' banana nut bread.

My family went goo goo gaga for what I think is the best tasting banana bread I've ever made or tasted.( sorry Mom )
I used butter flavored shortening,split the sugars,brown and white.I too added 1tsp of cinnamon and vanilla.Next time I'll try it with pecans.I read all the reviews and only cooked the standard size bread pans for 50 min.but my larger bread pan loaf took 60 min Thank-you Saseigel for your mom's recipe and thanks to all the mom's for their ideas.Foot Note: my bread rose just fine... -Desert Rose

This is the best Banana bread i had! I am not a fan of banana bread but using this recipe and adding the nuts is just a wow! My husband loved it. My mother-in-law loved it. We all loved it! I used honey roasted nuts as alternative nuts and it came out yummy. I wonder, can I use this recipe for a muffin? Do I need to add something else?

I generally do not write reviews, but I have been making this bread for years and it is ALWAYS a hit, and we found a gluten free adaptation that is just as delicious!  A family member was recently diagnosed with Celiac Disease, so imagine the disappointment when they realized no more "EBNB".  I made the recipe exactly as described except I substituted Namaste Perfect Flour Blend for the all-purpose flour, slightly less salt (personal preference) and I used 1 cup white and one cup light brown sugar.  It was just as good as the regular recipe I have been making for years, and the kids did not even know they were eating gluten free!

Wonderful! I took this BNB to a family party and it went over so well. The prep is so easy and the taste is out of this world. One mistake I did make was not printing out extra recipes like this recipe said to do. everyone wanted a copy of it.

This is fantastic! I made the recipe with 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla added. I also baked it in a 10 inch bundt pan at 325 degrees F for about 55ish minutes (until toothpick came out clean) and it turned out amazing!!! Going in my recipe box for sure.

Unbelievable!!! My variation was to make muffins.  I am so glad that I did.  This was soooo good that the muffins kept me honest.  If I had used the loaf pan, there's no telling how big my slices would've been!!! I agree with previous reviews.  The flavor was intense and it was scary good!!!

Really delicious! I love this recipe because it's easy to halve and just make one loaf. Super dense and yummy. I typically leave out the nuts just out of preference.

delicious. I was concerned about the amount of butter so I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1 cup sour cream. I also read the reviews and added 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon since my bf's mom is not particularly fond of it. The result was a perfect crunchy crust, moist inside and not too sweet! Will definitely make again. Everyone loved it.

Love this! I altered the recipe slightly by adding 1/2tsp nutmeg, and 1tsp cinnamon to the dry mix (flour, salt, baking soda), and 1tsp vanilla extract to the wet mix. 

Also important to note, I made sure to cream the sugar and butter SUPER well with my hand mixer, and then also mixed my eggs and my mashed bananas in separate batches with my hand mixer as well as to get the banana flavor completely throughout. Then of course I mixed in the nuts and the dry mix. 

Let me tell you, these make BEAUTIFUL muffins as well, this bread disappears instantly!

I use coconut oil with 1/2 brown/white sugars. Otherwise leave this wonderful recipe as it is. PERFECTION! I love the dark crispy slightly chewy crust. Adds another dimension that other recipes do not have.

I have made this countless times now. I follow the recipe exactly..except I make it in a bundt pan (just easier for me). I have, on occasion, added chocolate chips and that was good too. It's always delicious and my kids beg for it often. Thank you for sharing! This is "our" Banana Nut Bread from now on.

This is the best Banana Bread I have ever tasted. The banana flavor is so tasty. I too added 1 tsp of cinnamon 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp vanilla. I made 16 mini loafs with this. They did not last long. Will be making again. Thank You for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Amazing! I've made this a few times already and it has gotten rave reviews! You literally have to tear yourself away from it. I split it into 3 small loaves. It is the most incredible tasting recipe ever! Quick question, How would it taste gluten free? Has anyone tried? My sister cant have gluten but I want her to have some too!

I just made this recipe as 2 dozen muffins with pecans, allspice, and about 3/4 cup of chopped dates I needed to use up added. I made a terrible mistake in that I ate one just now. All I can think about is that a big glass of wine and 2 or 3 more muffins sounds like a terrific supper tonight. Fabulous recipe. I need to put most of them away in the spare freezer for my husband's morning coffee treats before I grow clean out of my fat pants over them. Tastes uncannily like my late grandmother's nut bread!

This recipe is exactly what i was looking for!. A not good for you but crowd pleaser dense bread.  I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon & 1 tsp vanilla. That's it. And if I didn't have that, it would still come out awesome. I tried making it once with half brown sugar and half white sugar, it was much better with all white sugar. Baked for 55 minutes in 2 loaf pans (even though i only had 1.5 cups of banana. Got very brown on the outside, which had me scared but no worries, cuz it was excellent. Made in 2 loaf pans. Don't let the bananas get too dark. This was a hit!!!  PS: Some ppl assume brown sugar is better for you than white sugar. It's not. Brown sugar is white sugar with molasses added to it. From a health stand point sugar is sugar, so might as well go white ;)

The most fabulous banana nut bread ever!! Made it for Thanksgiving and was a huge hit! I also reduced the temp to 335 for the last 10 minutes of cooking and came out great! I used 1/2 tsp of baking soda along with 1 cup of brown and one cup of white sugar. Incredible as French toast too the next morning! Jess

I followed the directions, ans was very pleased with the results.  Next time, I will lower the temperature to 325, because I used glass loaf pans.  Also, a little vanilla, cinnamon, and baking powder might improve the flavor & texture.

I've made a lot of banana nut bread because it's my son's favorite and this is the best one I have ever made!  It is moist and the outside is crusty and delicious.  I made it in a tube pan because I didn't have 2 loaf pans. This is awesome!

The best banana bread ever.  Threw away the recipe I had for years.  The hardest part about making it is making sure I don't eat it all.

Everyone LOVED this recipe!! Intense banana flavor. Very moist. The only thing I would do differently, would be, less butter. In the center it was pudding like in a small amount. It still was fantastic! This bread does come out browner than what I've made before, but this is the moistest and flavorful banana nut bread I've ever had. 
Two thumbs up from everyone!

Turned out very well. I added a little extra vanilla and walnuts, 1/2 tsp of baking powder, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and divided the sugars into half white/half dark brown sugar as I saw suggested in the reviews.  I had some trouble figuring out the timing for baking since I used the mini loaf pans (pan made for four mini loaves). I baked it at 325 for 40 minutes, took it out, but realized it was still not cooked in the middle. Since I had to reheat the oven and cook them longer after everything had somewhat cooled, I don't want to put an exact time on what it took for me. But, I can say, even though the center was still gooey, it was fabulous!!! Very happy with this recipe!!

I have tried many many banana breads out there and this one by far is the best one I have used although I tweaked the recipe a bit added this and that, that the recipe didn't call for and it always comes out great. 5 stars for this recipe. Instead of adding butter I added coconut oil same amount as recipe calls for and also a bag of white chocolate chips from wal~mart the smaller package and also 2 teaspoons of baking powder. The family and neighbours make me make it at least once a week

I have never written a review before and never baked a loaf of any type of bread before.  My bread turned out super delicious!  I did add cinnamon, vanilla, and Kahlua.  Next time I think I will also add sour cream.  Great recipe!  Theresa

This is my favorite. I used frozen bananas. The liquid that was left over from when they defrosted I used to make a cream cheese frosting.

Seems like the recipe is better suited to smaller pan s.  I added freshly crushed cardamom seeds and took to work.  I was told it is the best banana bread a friend ever had!  This was from a frozen loaf.  I love the flavor and wrap my  breads warm to keep in the moisture. Will certainly keep making it.

I made this yesterday and another 2 loaves this morning.  It's the best banana bread ever.  I made it exactly as the recipe states, and it's wonderful.  I didn't change anything.  I tossed out my old banana bread recipe and replaced it with this one.

Great recipe! I used 1 cup homemade applesauce (with no sweeteners added) in place of the butter. I often substitute applesauce for oil or butter/margarine in brownies, cakes, banana & zucchini breads. It tastes great and is healthy. This was moist and delicious! My kids loved it. Thanks.

Excellent!  Look no further for the best Banana Nut Bread recipe because this is it. I halved the recipe and made some changes due to what I had on hand and what other reviewers suggested. I used part organic coconut oil part butter, I added a little local honey since I was low on white sugar. I added 1/2 tsp baking powder, a few dashes of cinnamon, pure vanilla, and extra black walnuts. I greased and dusted the 9x5 loaf pan with cinnamon and threw some black walnuts on top. I baked the loaf at the recommended 350 degree temperature for 48 minutes and it rose nicely. I just polished off a slice and will cut off a couple slices for my husband and take the rest to work for the coworkers to devour. Two words for this recipe--Yum Yum!

Great recipe for all the reasons noted. It also adapts nicely to what is on hand and one's fear, to wit:  I had 4 cups of overripe bananas (cleaning out freezer), so I added one cup of flour.  Have to watch butter, so I cut that to one stick and used a cup of pear puree.  Had pecans, so I roasted them and added them after pouring batter into pans (I forgot)--this made a nice praline-ish top even though I swirled them into the batter. Finally, I subbed for one cup of sugar with sweetener substitute.

Came out great on my first try! I did half brown sugar, half white and added a tsp of allspice. I would not cook it longer than 60 minutes max. It was perfectly toasty on the outside, and moist in the inside. I will make this again for sure!

I love this recipe. I just got finished eating two slices right after it cooled down enough. Crust was crispy and gooey at the same time, not hard, just soft and chewy. Inside so moist. I would definitely make this again!

I've been making this recipe for years after finding it online here. This is by far the BEST bnb I've ever had!! Like others I adjusted a few things....mixed light brown sugar, dark brown sugar, and a little white sugar. Added vanilla extract, and half baking soda baking powder. Also use pecans instead of walnuts. I usually bake mine for 59 minutes at 350 degrees and it comes out perfect! Just tried in my new oven and it was a little brown so I will try 325 degrees instead next time to see how it works. Overall this recipe is always a success and my entire family loves it!! Will be passing this down to the next generation ????

I have made this recipe more times than I can count over the last 4 or 5 years. In fact, I just converted it to metric and copied for our Australian visitors who raved about it. They informed me that my stepson confessed that when he lived with us, he would hide bananas until they browned just so I would make a batch. I add 1 tsp of vanilla, but do not like the cinnamon added. I have tried it with Splenda, but it just isn't the same in my opinion. Another tip- if my bananas are brown and I don't have time to make bread, I put them in the freezer, peel and all. When I'm ready to make bread, I take them out to defrost for about an hour or so. They come out of the peel already mushy and make delicious bread. This recipe is definitely worth a try if you are considering it.

This is a big hit with my family. I love it with the nuts, but my kids don't, so sometimes I use them, and sometimes I don't.
The last time I made this bread, I only used 1/2 the sugar that the recipe called for (I only used 1 cup) and I sprinkled a little sugar on the top before I baked. It turned out great! I think I will keep that modification for my family.

The taste is absolutely awesome but I have the same problem with the breads rising.  I have made the recipe six times and it has been perfect four times.  The other two time it flopped in the middle but my family still ate it.  My most difficult task with this bread is getting it cooled before they start to devour it.

One word: Freaking Good! OK, that's 2 words. This is a very, very good banana nut bread, possibly the best recipe here or elsewhere. But, but...I had to change it a little to suit my preference! In the past, I have made many, many different type and never seemed to get it to the right density, consistency, as the way I want it. This one came close! So, instead of using all purpose flour, I used yellow cake flour (like Swan Down or Hines...) and let me tell you, it made a big difference. Very moist with the right density and very good on the next day (if you can wait that long). I also add half a teaspoon of cinnamon, but no vanilla. This is much better than the dry-log banana bread at Starbucks. Enjoy!

This is great Banana nut bread. The only difference I add a teaspoon of Banana Extract. (Hard to keep Bananas in my house long enough to let them over ripen).

This bread was super moist and buttery.  I thought I had plenty of bananas (3 large) but I discovered that 1 large banana equals 1/2 cup.  But even with just 1 and 1/2 cups this tasted awesome.  

I used two 8 x 4 loaf pans and cooked them for 55-60 minutes.  They were done without being dry.

Best banana nut bread I have ever tasted. I used brown sugar and it gave the bread a slight caramel flavor. I used pecans instead of walnuts, I prefer the taste of pecans. This did not last long. Thank you for an excellent recipe that was easy to make.

I have been making this recipe for years now and it's my favorite! It's gone in no time when I make it for company or even just my husband and sons. Yum. My kids don't love nuts so I don't always add them but either way, recipe is a winner in my books.

Love this recipe!! This is the first recipe I tried the first time I made banana bread and it's the only one I'll ever use! I followed the advice of others and use vanilla and cinnamon every time. Today, however, I realized that I did not have enough butter!! As luck would have it, I had plenty of extra virgin coconut oil to spare ^_^ So! I put the coconut oil in the oven so that it would soften (ended up leaving it in there until is was completely melted). DO NOT use the microwave to warm up your oil, defeats the purpose of all those nutrients! I tasted the batter and OMG! It was delicious! It's still cooking and so far it smells delicious!! I love this recipe and (hopefully) this alternative to butter. Next goal is to sub a good sweet source so that I don't have to use sugar.

I personally have not tried this (too many WW points for me) But have made it twice for my husband in two weeks.  He has taken it into work and everyone who tries it says it is the best Banana Nut Bread they have ever had.

I love this recipie! I had been looking for the perfect banana bread for awhile. I found this one and love it!. I did use a 1/2 cup dark brown sugar and 1 and a 1/2 cups white sugar instead. I also tried a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. It adds a nice flavor.

This is the best recipe for banana nut bread that I have ever found. My husband told me to throw away all the other recipes I have for this bread, this is definitely a keeper. It is WONDERFUL! Thank you for sharing.-

This is an excellent recipe alone, but I had to add a few things.  I added a teaspoon each of vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon.  My bananas were overipe and I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream, as well.  I added half the dry ingredients, then the sour cream and ended up with the last of the flour.  My family loved it and I'm making another one right now, in a bundt pan.  Always remember to have all ingredients at room temperature when baking, unless otherwise stated.

I basically halved the recipe. I also substituted 1.25 cups of brown sugar, added 1tsp vanilla extract, 1tsp ground cinnamon.I used 1.25 tsp of baking powder since it did not rise the last time I tried it.  I used chopped almonds instead since thats the preferred nut in the house. I made one loaf which I baked for 35 mins.

Awesome banana bread - I skipped the nuts and it was delish! Other than the nuts, I followed the recipe to a tee - it was moist, rich and had a almost nutty flavor.  This will be my banana bread go to recipe from now on!

Fabulous...made the recipe as stated and my family just devours this, and asks for more.  I have made this over and over and this is my go to recipe for banana nut bread.

October 2017:  Another update....Continue to make this and now freeze the loaves for later use.  I make double and triple batches, that way I can share.

No joke, this bread is like CRACK! Luckily, I always seem to have a surplus of over ripe bananas to get my fix. Great recipe. (I recommend what others said - 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar...that is the only change I make!)

My family loves this recipe. It makes enough for me to have a loaf at home and take one to work. My kids complain when I take one to work, but my co-workers will start asking when I'm going to make some more if I take to long between time that I bring it in. Everyone asked for the recipe whenever i make some.

I'm not a banana fan, but my husband and toddler daughter are. Finding myself with several overripe bananas, I sought out a BNB recipe. This did not disappoint!  I used finely chopped walnuts and upped the amount to 1.5 cups. I added a tablespoon of canola oil to keep the bread moist and I threw in a few dashes of vanilla. Hubby and little girl loved the bread!  Next time I think I'm going to add a few handfuls of mini chocolate chips.

I make this all the time.  It is my go to recipe when my bananas have been unloved in the fruit bowl.  I think my daughter purposely does not eat the bananas for she knows this bread will be the result.  The recipe is posted on our frig in the hopes maybe someone else in my house will make it for me!

OMG!  Never made any nut breads with butter before and this was absolutely awesome.  I was afraid it wouldn't come out since I didn't have a mixer--only a whisk, but the results were still wonderful!!!!  I will definitely be making this again!

The best banana nut bread ive ever tried! I have been making this delicious bread for 2yrs now and i, as well as my family and friends, absolutely love it. I never alter the origninal recipe as its perfect for us the way it is. I have read reviews of others adding various spices and fruit to theirs ...to each its own. Its such a great base,cant see it harming it, but how do you perFect PERFECTION???

This was a good, moist banana bread. Classic taste, texture. Enjoyed it, but didn't find anything "extreme" about it. I will make this again.
I toasted the walnuts before adding to the batter.

This is the best banana bread I've ever had! I exchanged 1 cup of white sugar for brown sugar because I like the caramel flavor. This is an AMAZING recipe. I've made it twice in the last week!

Always turns out moist and delicious for me.  I do make a couple of tweaks by using 1/2 butter and 1/2 canola oil.  I also beat the butter, oil and sugar until creamy and then add the eggs one at a time, beat and then add the OVERRIPE bananas.  I slowly mix in the combined dry ingredients.  I only use 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  I also add 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract.  I spray my glass loaf pans with canola cooking spray and then dust with flour.  Bake in preheated oven on the middle rack for 55 minutes.

My favorite banana nut bread recipe!! Everybody raves about  it! I've used this recipe for years. I tried it verbatim the first time and tweaked it a little after that. As everyone had suggested, I added a tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon, half white/half brown sugar, and a drizzle of honey. Thank you SASEIGEL for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I've made this dozens of times since finding the recipe.  It's great as is, and I've added everything but the kitchen sink to it: coconut, dried fruits, nutmeg, cinnamon, mace, almonds, chocolate, lemon zest,  a splash of rum.  And I always split the sugar between dark and white, and sometimes substituted honey for the sugar and applesauce for the fat.   No matter what you add, it's going to be great.  I like to soak my raisins in any of the following: red wine, sangria, cherry juice, orange juice, rum, or whatever I have handy.  Also, as in all recipes,the cooking time is a guideline: watch for doneness regardless of the clock.

This is the best banana nut bread I have ever eaten. Granted, it is full of a lot of sugar, so I don't make it often. I found that dividing the batter into two loaf pans made very short loaves.  I took it out of the oven after 50 minutes and thought it was burned.  My son called it "caramelized". Indeed it did have a sinful crunchy top but the inside was perfect.  Keep an eye on it in the oven.

Love this bread! I've changed only a couple things...1.  Cut the sugar in half and added an extra cup of bananas instead. I've made it both ways and it still comes out the same. 2. I added chocolate chips because everything is better with chocolate 3.Pecans not walnuts personal preference

This was a really easy recipe that my kids loved! The reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there was just too much sugar for my taste. If I ever make this again I think I will cut the sugar in half.

I make this for my hubby and his military buddies! They LOVE it! I went along with what others said and added 1/2 tsp. of baking powder, along with using 1 cup of brown sugar and just one cup of white. I also add 1 tsp. of vanilla or 1 tsp. of almond flavoring. Always have recipe cards when giving this bread out!

My bread came out slightly overdone after cooking it just 55 minutes, though this might be my recently fixed oven's fault. However, my roommate gave it an A! If I make this recipe again I will cook for only 45 minutes.

I decided to take the advice of previous posters and only put my bread in for 55 minutes...  with 9 minutes left it was REALLY dark and starting to look burnt on top.  It also did not rise very much... the tasted was nice, but I have the same problem with every banana nut bread I've ever tried, it doesnt seem to fully cook in the center and leaving it in longer burns it.  I used baking soda as the recipe said, but am wondering if baking powder would be better?

Hands down the best banana bread recipe I have ever tried.  The bread is super moist, dense and full of banana flavor.  I did like all the others and added vanilla 2 tsp and cinnamon 1 heaping tsp. and yes, I could not stop eating it.  Yummmm.

I just made this today....I was wondering if the recipe was meant to be "1 stick of butter or margarine" rather than "1 cup" ?   It is amazing....but does not look like the loaf pictured

Wow!!  This recipe was wonderful!  I also tweaked it a little--half white/half light brown sugar, pecans instead of walnuts, and 1 tsp. each of cinnamon and vanilla, and always adding dry to wet ingredients.  I baked up one loaf (60 min.) and a dozen muffins (30 min.) at 325 degrees.
I was going to bring the muffins to work tomorrow, but I don't think they'll make it  : ) !!

I made half the recipe to test it out.  It disappeared very fast.  Now I need the full recipe and have to hide one loaf to make it last longer.  It's perfect!

Exceptional! I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups; it seemed it would be sweet enough with bananas and chocolate chips and it was. The husband gobbled it up in 1 day...instead of the usual 4-5 days on all other breads I've made! :) I will be making multiple loaves for friends tomorrow. I can't wait for their reactions! This is truly a GREAT recipe!

Just tried this, and can't figure out what went wrong.  Definately does not look like the picture... came out very dark brown, almost looks burned after 60 min in the oven and has a strange taste.  I have gone over the recipe and am sure I added everything.  My daughter tried it and liked it, but will rate as 3 as it does not look or taste what I expected.

I changed the ingredients just a little.  1.  Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.  2.  2 1/4 cups over ripe bananas, and 3. Honey roasted almond slivers instead of walnuts.  
4.  I tested after 50 minutes and my test knife came out clean and I took the two loaves out of the oven and let them cool.  My family said, "This is the best banana nut bread that you have ever made."

WOW!! Really REALLY really BIG hit at my house. Between my 11 yr old son and I, we finished one loaf within the sm hour it came out of the oven! Perfect recipe!  I did take advice of reviewers and added another half tsp baking soda. Since I didn't have two full sticks of butter, I used one and 3/4 sticks and about 3/4 cup of applesauce that I had on hand.  Also used half/half white and brown sugar, a  tsp of cinnamon and vanilla. Except for the fact that I (used bigger loaf pans than recipe called for) over baked them to a very browned crisp, we still can't stop eatting it up!  Wonderful banana bread recipe! Running back to the store now for more butter so I can get it right.

Don't tell my mother that I said this... THIS is the BEST banana nut bread I have ever tasted in my entire life!!!! It's perfectly moist and has the perfect buttery flavor and the banana taste was just right. I will be using this recipe from now on. It wasn't "cakey" like so many other recipes are. I followed the rcommendation of others and added 1/2 tsp vanilla.

O.M.G!!!!!!!!!  Absolutely the best banana nut bread I have ever tasted! I made two loaves and mini muffins over the weekend and I probably have SOME muffins left!  This recipe is a keeper! I did use half brown half white sugar as well.  I will definitely be making more to give as xmas gift goodies! Thanks for passing it on! :)

Oh My God!  This bread is delicious, my daughter who is 9 made the bread according to the directions down to the "p".  It turned out wonderful, delicious, amazing.  All five of my kids agreed that the banana nut bread was delicous, they rate it thumbs up with never ending gold stars. We agreed this is our new family dessert. Thank you very much for your moms "EBNB recipe". I agree it is habit forming. Our two loaves became 3/4 of a loaf left. :) Thank you from my family to yours. _mrs. john_

I love this recipe. I double the amount of banana and use pecans as opposed to walnuts as I find pecans have a less bitter taste than walnuts sometimes do. I've also swapped out chocolate chips for the nuts for my family members who don't like nuts.

This banana nut bread is AMAZING! I made it today with my little daughter and it's so delicious. We're keeping one loaf and giving the other to a friend who just had a baby. We added about half a cup more walnuts and about 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips. This made it even better!

This is a fantastic recipe! I have to admit I made some changes to the recipe. Since my mom is a heart patient, I substituted butter/margarine with Smart Balance Light Buttery Spread with Flax and used only egg whites. Just tried to make it a little healthier. Oh and my dad and I love raisins to I added Raising and Walnuts to the mix. Really Soft and yummy :)

Today tried this recipe and mine turned out terrible.  The 2 stars represents my experience and was surely something I did.  I used a cheap Wal-mart margarine and that prob was the problem.  My Nut Bread tasted "salty" and was not real flavorful.  The bananas were not over ripe and could have caused that.  With all the other 5 stars I must have screwed up somewhere.

Excellant Banana Bread!!  My family waits for the bananas to turn just so I can make more banana bread!  Used some suggestions from other people.  Used cinnamon and split the sugar between white and brown.  Everyone loves it!

I've been looking for a good banana bread recipe for years and finally found one I LOVE!  I know the recipe suggests you not cut into right away, but I couldn't help it!  It smelled so good, I had to.  YUM!  I did as other suggested and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white, 2 tsp of vanilla and 2 tsp cinnamon.  Thanks so much!  I can't wait to try it again tomorrow for breakfast!

I used the main recipe then tweaked it with the changes that the last two people who commented made. I baked it at 325 for 60 min. Since I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugars i would only bake it for 55 min. My loaves were a little darker than what i prefer. I have a gas stove and it's usually right on. I have only made banana bread once and don't remember how it tasted. i know it was good. My husband said good job , it was really good. It was soft and not too sweet. The real test will be tonight when my dinner guests try it! I will let ya'll know how they liked it.

Out of this world!  I didn't have enough mashed bananas so I used half plain yogurt and half bananas.  Worked great.  I will plan for more ripe bananas next time around.

Best banana bread I have ever tasted. Took others suggestions and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. I meant to add the vanilla too but forget - still turned out beautifully. Also, I only had 3 bananas on hand (about 1.5 cups). I can't wait to make it again with the full 2 cups of bananas and vanilla!

This is WONDERFUL.  Moist with a great buttery crispy crust.  I added  t. vanilla, 1/2 c. coconut, 1/2 c. chocolate chips and used pecans instead of walnuts since my daughter is allergic.  THE BEST ever banana nut bread I have had in my life.

Hubby has been after me for two days to make banana bread.  So I got online this morning and found this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to slowly add the dry ingredients to the moist ones and used my mixer to blend it.  Did not let cool the two hours as hubby refused to wait any longer.  This one is a keeper, we will indeed have it again and again.  Thanks for sharing it!!

This recipe is really good. I cooked it less than the time it recommended however and it was still more brown than I prefer. It was super yummy and super moist however.

OMG!!! I love this recipe and have been using it for the past 3 years. I get so many requests from my husband and all of his friends to make this. It comes out moist and dense and full of flavor!! The only thing I do differently is use brown sugar.

I just got finished trying this recipe. As others have stated, it was one of the best Banana Nut Breads I have ever tried. I did  switch out 1 cup of applesauce with 1 cup of butter. I doubled up the recipe. 
We have banana trees growing all over the Florida Keys, and my neighbor had given me a bag full of ripe bananas. It was simply delicious!!

Fantastic recipe - I've thrown away all the other banana bread recipes and kept this one...good for zucchini bread too!
I added a brown sugar/walnut crumble to the top and now my neighbors want more.

The bestestest Banana Nut Bread ever created.  I have always loved banana nut since i could remember.  Sometimes you can think of a food and literally taste it but when you eat it it's not quite the same. Well this one exceeds even your mind's taste buds!!!

Wonderful recipe - this is my first time making any sort of bread.  I modified the recipe using the suggestions of 'Virginia Sista,' but using a 1:1 ratio of brown and white sugar.

My loaves cooked in about 41 minutes.  They fell some in the center, but I think it's due to testing its doneness too soon.  

I'm absolutely thrilled with my first go at this recipe!

Best ever Banana Bread recipe!  I sometimes add more bananas and it comes out great! If I am wanting to sweeten it up I will sprinkle a little raw sugar on top before baking.

Wow.. quite good. My only suggestion is to wait for the bread to cool. That was very hard for me to do!! I felt that it was better the next day after being in the frig over night. I did altered the recipe a bit 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown. I also used pecans (2 cups) instead of walnuts because my fiance like pecans better. I put in 3 cups of bananas to increased flavor. It turned out fantastic! 
For me it was a bit on the sweet side- but everyone else LOVED IT!!

I have tried several banana nut bread recipes and they all either turned out to dry or had no banana flavor. This recipe gave me hope in the perfect banana nut bread. It was moist and oh sooo yummy. My little girls don't really care for sweet breads with nuts in them but this recipe sure changed their minds. My three year old kept sneaking in the kitchen for more..

I love banana nut bread its my ultimate favorite bread. This is a very easy bread to make. I however used 3 bananas instead of two which I think is ok. Theres nothing wrong with a little more banana flavor.

This is the best banana bread I have ever tasted. sometimes I also fold in 1 cup blueberries after combining the wet and dry ingredients, and it makes the bread even better. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

I just got finished making this recipe, and I followed what other suggested to add to the bread. This was my 1st time and was very easy to do. I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon of baking powder. I feel like there should be more bananas in there, but other than that it was yummy.

Awesome, just like Grandmas. Used 1tsp vanilla and substituted 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce for banana because i was short. I also used 1/4 c butter and the rest margerine as thats all i had in the house. The bread cooked for 60 min and i thought it burned because it was brown. To my surprise it was delish, moist and very banana tasting. Crust was sweet and picky family loved it! Thanks for this recipe!

This was excellent! I too used half white sugar and half brown sugar....personal preference. I had 4 bananas (medium size) and that gave me just under 2 cups...but the bread still turned out moist and wonderful!

Thank you for sharing this recipe!  I did use some of the other reviews advice about using a mixer and I only had 1 1/4 cup of banana's... still delicious!  Can't wait till I have some more ripe banana's so I can make again, this time I will use 2 cups!

It was delicious!  I also added nutmeg and vanilla for a bit more flavor.   I have to say this is even better than the banana-nut bread that I get at Starbucks

I think "Extreme" is not appropriate.  Should be "Insane" banana nut bread.  I did put just a little over 2 cups of bananas (about  2 1/3 cups all together) and doubled the walnuts to 2 cups.  I also added about 1 tablespoon of vanilla.  Oh my, oh my it was sooo good.  My mom who says bnb is not her favorite couldn't quit eating it.  Me either.  Hide it from yourself.  It is that good.

My husband and children loved this recipe! Not at all healthy but very tasty. I added pecans and chocolate chips instead of walnuts and one cup white sugar and one cup of brown.  I also made muffins instead of banana bread. Deelicious!

I'm not a fan of Banana nut bread....until now. Followed what most suggested to add: 1C Brown Sugar & 1C white, cinnamon, vanilla & baking powder & baked for 55 mins.  Texture was great and the smells wafting through the house alone was worth making this. But I had one problem which I hope someone out there can resolve. I used 2 smaller 8x4 aluminum pans. And the centers caved in. Did not affect the taste, but looks bad. Any help appreciated.  Thanks in advance. -Richard

I make this one all the time.  I also do it with the half brown half white sugar, makes a much darker loaf but very good.  Also try toasting your walnuts for 15 mins at 350 then break/rub them so most of the "paper" comes off of the nut, this will also prevent the nuts from graying the bread.

I made this for our Holiday Bake Sale at our Church.  Of course we had to taste test it first.  Very good!  I sprinkled the bottom and sides of the pans with brown sugar mixed with cinnamon instead of the flour.  I used 1 cup each of white and brown sugar.  Added 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  Did not use the walnuts (Personal taste)  Awesome! the crust is to die for.  Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled this because it had easy ingredients. I happened to run out of enough banana's, so to make up the last cup I used a cup of coconut milk. I then added shredded coconut to the batter, it was excellent and VERY moist! I also used 1/2 brown sug and 1/2 white, added cin, ginger and nutmeg, as well as some vanilla ext... it had a wonderful deep taste. This is a great base for creating your own as long as you stick with the basic wet/dry measurements.

This is really good banana bread.  I left the nuts out because my family doesn't like them, but it was still some of the best bread i've ever made.  However, i didn't cook it as the recipe stated.  I pulled mine out at 55 minutes, and it was almost too done.

This is an excellant recipe, i did split the sugars, half white and brown and added the 1 tsp of vanilla, the cook time for my oven was to long but i cut it down to 50 mins, and it came out perfect, i took it to work for my co-workers to have with their coffee and it was a big hit and yes i did have to write down the recipe, just your footnotes said...... :) thx

I can attest, it didn't last long. Made two loaves for breakfast but only one loaf made it to the morning. I added a couple dashes of mexican vanilla to the creamed sugar. Add the eggs slowly and suggest whipping them beforehand. Then add the bananas, then add the walnuts last. Lightly heat up the walnuts with butter and sugar, I used Hawaiian turbinado sugar but brown sugar is good too. The caramelized effect of the crust of the bread is great so don't undercooked it.

This recipe makes really delicious banana nut bread! Mine came out with the crust a little burnt on top the first time (I am not very familiar with this oven yet) but otherwise perfect so I would turn off the heat a few minutes early next time. I used half the ingredients to make one loaf, and the other half to make delicious banana nut muffins cooked for ~25 minutes. Yum!

This is a great recipe, the only thing i did different was 350 for 45 min, it came out perfect. My kids loved it and so did the neighbors they could smell it cooking. the only thing i'll do different next time is not so many bowls!!

This bread was SO good!!! I read thru some of the reviews and decided to also try mine by adding 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and used one cup brown sugar with one cup granulated. I also used pecans instead of walnuts and increased them by half a cup. I took the advice from one review and lowered my oven temp to 335 and baked for 55 minutes. Mine did not rise as I expected it to but who cares?! It was moist and looked wonderful. After it turned out perfectly I will never alter it again! Unfortunately, I ate the majority of both loaves....my bathroom scale is not pleased....

Made a batch of EBNB tonight--I've been trying to duplicate the recipe my mom used from the 1983 Better Homes and Gardens cookbook.  This was EXACTLY what I wanted...only better!  I had no issues with being too doughy or dry, and it was buttery and delicious when baked!  I halved the sugar and did half white and half brown, added a splash of vanilla and a teaspoon of cinnamon as so many others have recommended.  My only complaint was that I set my timer for 60 mins, and it was already browner than I liked at that point (my oven is true), but it thankfully didn't affect the taste.  I will do it exactly the same next time, only set for 50 mins and go from there if needed.  Definitely a keeper!

Let me begin by stating that I do not cook nor bake. I am learning and having fun using allrecipes.com This recipe was my second to make and well it was perfect my boyfriend loved it so much he wouldn't take it to work to share:-) I'm on my way to become an amazing housewife thanks to this recipe. I did change it per other reviews by mixing brown sugar and white sugar great idea!!! I hope everyone enjoys the banana nut bread as much as we have!!! Good luck:-)

This was delicous! OMG, so good. I love it, but tweeked it just a bit to fit my bf's and my taste, but barely.  To be a lil bit healthier we used Egg Beaters instead to cut the cholesterol and added about an extra 1/2 cup or so of walnuts to the top of the top. came out great! i've made it multiple times and it never lasts more than 2days b/c its just OH SOOO SOOOO GOOD! Great recipe thank you :D

This isn't the best banana nut bread I've ever had but it's not bad at all. This is the first time I've ever made banana nut bread and I'm happy with the way it turned out. I like that the ingredients are basically what you find in the normal household pantry. I hate having to go buy a bunch of things I will not use again. I did change some things by adding 1 tsp of baking powder, 2 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of vanilla and instead of 2 cups of white sugar I used half brown sugar and half white. The bread turned out better than I expected.

This is my go-to banana bread!  I add 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamin, and usually substitue the 1 cup of walnuts for small semi-sweet chocolate chips, pecans, or omit them all together. Every which way the banana bread turns out great! Careful when mixing the wet and dry ingredients, make sure its fully incourporated, and enjoy the results!

Absolutely fantastic. Followed the recipe as-is and the bread came out moist and full of flavor. Especially given the little amount of work it required to make it, it is fantastic!  Now to decide if I should take some to work with me tomorrow or hoard it all for myself!

Exceptionally simple recipe!  Exceptionally delicious results!  The bread was soft, moist and just the right amount of sweet. We were short of 1/4th cup banana and substituted 1/2 the butter with extra virgin olive oil. Turned out really great and we might stick with the oil butter mix going forward. Apologies to the purists! :)

I just made this recipe.  I made 1 loaf and 6 muffins.  The muffins were done in 30 minutes and the loaf was done in 55.  I did follow some of the changes, used baking powder, vanilla, cinnamon half white/brown sugar and pecans.  I used more bananas becuase my husband loves the flavor of banana.  The muffins came out about and there are already four of the six gone and I have only had half of one....the rest my husband ate.  He works at Texas Motor Speedway in the food and beverage area and he said that this is better than what they sell there.  Love it!!!  OMG it is moist and soft and delish!!! Thank you!

I love this recipe! It's very easy to make and my family really enjoys it. I like to make one loaf and the rest of the batter into muffins. I have to say though, I did add 1 t. vanilla only because I love vanilla. I've made this recipe a few times and it's great both ways.

I made banana bread for the first time ever last night, and this recipe turned out to be amazing!  This was probably the best banana bread I've ever had. This is a moist banana bread, so if you're looking for a dryer bread, this is not it. The only thing that i did different was i did one cup white sugar, and one cup brown sugar and also added 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp vanilla.  Definately will add this recipe to my recipe book.

This is truely a wonderful recipe!  I have made this many times as written and it is delish, but I think my favorite way to make this is to sub. 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1/2 brown sugar, add vanilla to batter and choc. chips to one of the loaves and it is GREAT!!  I have gotten many requests for this bread!

EBNB is to die for! I half the recipe. Used 1/2 cup of white sugar and the other 1/2 cup brown sugar. Added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and vanilla extract. Dash of nutmeg. Everything else the same. Used a glass loaf pan, cook it for 50 mins, not enough. The top was sooo brown but the middle was still soggy. Next time will at least cook for 65 mins and adding foil to top towards the end to prevent the top browning so fast. Thanks for the recipe.

This is abosuletly addictive! Very easy, and most of these ingredients are on hand. I cut the recipe in half and baked in my perfect brownie pan at 325 degrees for 40 minutes.

This is a fantastic recipe!! I keep missing some of the directions though. First I didn't put enough bananas, and the second time I put a TON of bananas. I'll try this again soon, and maybe I"ll get it right!

I've been making this bread for about 4 years now.  It's the most requested food that I make.  Soooo incredible, moist and gone in minutes.  Perfect for back-packing trips and camping.   Thank you so much, Lori  Mom of 3 (I don't use nuts, my kids are picky)

I have made this recipe a hundred times and what I love about it is that the flavor is only enhanced by refrigerating before serving.  Yes, your bread should/could be served cold.  Many recipes are only "good" hot out of the oven while this recipe is fabulous as a "gift" because it tastes so moist and dense and very banana-y served cold.

Omg!!! I made this last night.  It is soooo good that I could/can not stop eating it.  I actually reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and added an extra banana because I had one to many and did not know what to do it with it.  Wow! Is all I gotta to say :)

I halved the recipe because I only have 1 loaf pan.  Added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla like someone else recommended.  Didn't have any walnuts so omitted them.  Baked about 48-50 minutes.  Tasted very good.  My kids, 2 and 3, loved it.  Tastes even better after being refrigerated.  Will make again.

I seem to always come back to this recipe. I like to add a little vanilla to the mix, maybe 1/2 tsp. Also makes great muffins! Fresh out of the oven, with a little butter on top, HEAVEN!

Wonderful recipe!  After reading reviews, I made a couple of adjustments & it turned out wonderful. I used 1 cup white sugar & 1 cup brown sugar.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla & 1 tsp cinnamon.  I am not a bread baker, but this recipe was very easy & tasty!

Very good.  Made it with Olive oil and 1/2 egg whites and 1/2 whole eggs.  Added some cinnamon and maple syrup.  I should have either added flour or cut back on the wet ingredients, but either way it was very tasty and 3 year old calls it cake, and it's so much better for him than cake!!

I've been using this recipe for years, and it is always a hit, though indeed quite rich/sweet/greasy.  These days I use only half as much butter & sugar, and I don't feel it hurts the flavor at all.  If you are having issues with burning, try lowering the temp to 325 instead of decreasing cooking time... worked like a charm for me when my newest (gas) oven was burning my breads.

I love this bread and have challenged family members to a bake-off using this recipe.  I always cover in foil directly out of the oven and it makes for a stick-sweet muffin top-like quality.  Highly recommend recipe as is, although sometimes add vanilla extract (1 tsp) and double nuts (pecans) for may own preferences.

I just made this yesterday!  I went with reviewer suggestions and used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar, used 4 bananas, and added 1 tsp baking powder.  It was not dense at all, very moist, fluffy, delicious.  I did not have 2 loaf pans and so made it in 1 bundt pan.  I was worried that it wouldn't cook through, but I baked it for about 1 hr - 1hr 10 mns and it was perfect.  Let cool completely before inverting onto platter.  This one is a keeper :)

Delicious! I added cinnamon and allspice, but left the rest of the ingredients the same. I only needed 50 minutes in the oven before it was done. This was my first time making banana bread and it was a success!

I use this recipe for my holiday baking as gifts and it is an excellent banana nut bread- very dense and flavorful.  I, personally, would like it better if it was a little softer or maybe moister- but the recipe is still great and I haven't found a better one yet!

This was awesome. I changed it a bit.  Instead of 2 cups of white sugar I added 1 cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar.  I also added about 3 tablespoons of vanilla extract and 2 tablespoons of cinnamon. I think I may add nutmeg next time. I agree that 1 hour is too long because it starts to burn.  Also I spread my batter into 5 mini loaf pans. Taking it to all my Christmas functions tomorrow!

Very good recipe! It was easy to put together too. It was gone quick at my house. I added walnut to the top of half of my loaf because my husband likes them and I dont. Very moist!

This is the best bread recipe ever.  I always thought my mom made good bread..no longer! I can't make enough of it. At our family holiday gathering, I have to bring several loaves.  Each year for Christmas I make at least 30 loaves.  It's moist and delicious.  Thank you for posting this amazing recipe.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Thank you!!

This recipe seems to be missing something. The bread did not rise and looks too brown. I followed what is written completely. Consistency before baking was also very fluid.

I have good banana nut bread before but nothing in the world as good as this. I thought the review for this was very funny about not cutting or eating this until the party has started however they were so on the money with it. Delecious is not good enough to describe the taset, flavor and texture of this great bread.

I made it exactly how the recipe called and holy toledo it was amazing! I used a decorative bunt cake pan and it put just the perfect outside to it. I didn't save the recipe just in case we didn't like so I just searched through 160 different recipes until I found it again! I knew it was the one because of the foot notes!

My family won't eat overripe bananas so I freeze the bananas once they start getting too brown and save them for making banana bread. The thawed bananas when added to a recipe makes a moister product. This is a great recipe but I make one loaf out of it, filling my 9x5 loaf pan 2/3 full. There is a little left over but I add chocolate chips to it and make muffins.

This was VERY good! I used pecans instead of walnuts since I do not like walnuts, and added cinnamon since no recipe is complete without it - it was to die for! It makes two loaves and thank goodness it does! The first loaf was gone in about an hour between myself, my boyfriend, and his friend that was over. The boys went crazy for it! And as other reviewers have said - it was even better the next day!

This bread has a nice, dense texture, but lacks flavor. I would not make it again - there are much better banana nut bread recipes available.

Due to hard water, I used apple cider instead of water. Also added nutmeg, lemom juice, along with cinnamon. it was rich and decandant, and topped with whipped cream

I made the recipe just as it is written, then I read the reviews. The loaves came out dark and I thought they were burned, but they didn't taste burned, just brown. The loaves did not raise as high as other recipes I've tried.  I made 4 loaves and they all seemed to settle in the middle a little, but there was no evidence of "falling", like an unset center. My family loves the bread - it is rich and flavorful and moist.  I will make it again trying some of the changes in the reviews.

Like everyone else, I modified the recipe a bit b/c it seemed almost too plain. I added a cup of whole wheat flour, a cup of brown sugar, 2 tbsp of vanilla, 1 tbsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of nutmeg and I used 4 bananas instead of 2. I baked this recipe about 30 minutes ago and both loaves are almost gone!!! LOL  I would recommend "creaming" the sugar & butter, and slowing adding the eggs one at a time. Also...watch your bake time. My loaves baked for about 45-50 minutes, and they were done.

This was SO GOOD! The only thing I changed was I added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. I also omitted the nuts (my family doesn't like nuts in breads/muffins). My entire family loved it! Thanks!

This is the best banana nut bread I have ever had.  The flavor is fantastic.  The only "oops" I have made is that I let the butter get too liquified when I was trying to soften it in the microwave.  The difference that made in the recipe was incredible.  Just softened butter works just fine.

This was awesome! I did make a few changes and substitutions, but I think it would have been great as written as well.  My changes were:  Whole Grain wheat-free flour blend substituted for the AP flour.  I make my own flour blend out of several different WG flours plus xanthan gum. It works in recipes about like Whole Wheat flour would. I find that when using whole grain or whole wheat flours, you need to increase the rising agents. So I used 6 eggs instead of 4 and 3t soda instead of 2. I was out of nuts in the house, so I used steel cut oats and only added 1/2 cup, because I wasn't sure how they would do. It was wonderful! I probably over did it with the eggs and soda, but it rose so much, it was so soft and fluffy.  Just perfect! this is exactly how I'll make it next time!

I've made banana bread a few times - but nothing spectacular - I've made this one 5 times in the last month.  Changes are: 1 C brown sugar, 1 C white sugar, add 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon. Bake 53 min. at 350 degrees. Everyone wants it!  Baked in a buntd pan.

This was delicious!  I made a few changes based on other reviews:   1)  I used half white sugar, half brown sugar. 2)  I added 2 tsp. vanilla 3)  I used 1/2 tsp. baking powder My own changes: 1)  I didn't have any nuts, so I omitted them and I added a bag of peanut-butter chips instead. 2)  I ran out of margarine/butter, so I used 1 cup of Crisco and a tsp. of butter flavoring.   3)  I added a streusel to the top before baking.    When I mixed, I creamed the Crisco and sugars, and then added the eggs and vanilla and used the beaters on them.  I added the rest of the ingredients with a spoon.    Oh, this was so good...especially with the peanut butter chips!  Oh...goodbye diet (at least until this bread is gone)!

Excellent BNB.  Made 6 batches to give away and take for a beach trip in August. I never even got a smell!! (other than the piece I had at home before the trip) Wonderful comments and was asked for recipe.  Making more tomorrow for company that is coming from South Carolina. I have put this in my favorite recipe folder.

Fabulous BNB!  I did not make any changes in the ingredients other than using 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown and I used margarine because that's all I had on hand.  I baked 2 9X5 loaves for about 40-45 minutes.  I did completely flub up the mixing of the ingredients.  I was in a hurry and hate to admit I did not read ahead.  The ingredients went into the mixing bowl in order of appearance.  Of course, I realized my "mistake" before baking and was afraid I'd messed up big time.  If it comes out better by actually following the instructions, I don't think I'll be able to take it.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE This recipe and can't stop talking about it or eating it.  I've never tried adding the others recommendations because I just can't imagine it being any better but I do add chocolate chips to most of it so I won't eat it.  I even joined allrecipes just so I could say how fabulous this recipe is.  Thank you to Saseigel's mom for sure!

I made it exactly as is and it was the best banana nut bread I've ever had! It was packed with bananas and just delicious! I didn't realize that the recipe was for two loaves, but now I see why... within minutes of taking it out of the oven half of the first loaf was gone!!

The best banana bread I have ever eaten.  I have eaten a lot of banana bread.  I halfed the recipe because I only had one bread pan.  My bread was the most beautiful and best tasting ever.  I did not add any nuts.  Everyone that tasted it, LOVED it.  I am amazed and it is sooo simple to make, Thank you, Thank you.

It's good but the only problems that I had was that it stuck to the bottom of the pan and it didn't rise all that much.  Next time I might put more batter in the pan and make a smaller second loaf or muffins.  I did modify it a little.  I used pecans and walnuts but only because I ran out of walnuts and had the pecans on hand.  It turned out yummy!

ABSOLUTELY the BEST I've ever made :)!!!  Since I don't want to wear it on my hips for years to come, I did alter the recipe for a healthy guilt free breakfast bread...1/2c LIGHT butter & 1/2c applesauce; only 2 eggs; 3/4 cup sugar (applesauce adds extra sweetness); 1/4c wheatgerm; 1/4c fibersure (~45gms.of fiber!); butter, vanilla, banana extracts & lots of cinnamon & pumpkin pie spice!  Still fabulous but not dangerous...Note-Other than the extracts and spices, the original recipes stays as is for parties since I'm not the dietician of that gathering!

This is by far the best banana nut bread I've ever had. I first used this recipe about 6yrs ago. I make many loaves and give them out for Xmas. Everyone LOVES it and begs me for the recipe but I say no way Jose this recipe stays home with me. I did change one thing though. instead of the regular bananas, I used the tiny Ecuadorian bananas. those have a much more banana flavor then all of them I think. It's funny to see people arguing over the last slice.

This is wonderful!! Definately not for the calorie counters out there! My parents request this often, not like I mind :) Watch baking time after 45 min - mine is usually approx 52 min. This does need time in the fridge for flavors to "ripen" Thank you!

I wish I had read the reviews about adding 1 tsp. of baking powder.  Both times I made this, the breads had deep valleys down the middle, with no rise at all.  I like a dense bread, but this was too much.  I may give this one more shot with the baking powder, because it has a good taste.

Great bread! To save myself some time, and because the bananas I had were still green, I used Gerber organic banana baby food instead, and it turned out wonderful! Seriously some of the best banana bread I've ever made!

After years of making one bad banana bread recipe after another I decided to give this one a try - and all the reviews really helped me decide too.  All I can say it - delicious!  The very best.   I did add some cinnamon and since we live in an RV I just made half the recipe but it turned out just great.  This is not my only recipe that I will use for banana bread.  One day i will try using Splenda too!  Thank you all for your reviews and thank you SASEIGEL for sharing.

So I combined the bread in a jar idea with this recipe. it turned out great! I used small wide mouth canning jars.  my mom took it to work and heated it in the microwave.  she said it tastes like it just came out of the oven.  Will definently do this again for friends and family.

Awesome Banane Nut bread recipe! Very moist and delish. The only changes I made was dividing the sugar in half (1cup white & 1cup brown sugar) I also omitted the nuts. This recipe is a keeper!

This banana bread is very good.I made a couple of changes.The recipe calls for 1 cup butter or margarine, I used 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup applesauce.The recipe also calls for 2 cups white sugar,Used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup splenda.I also put a powdered sugar glaze on top.The bread was very moist and flavorfull.I also used pecans in place of the walnuts.I only baked it for about 50 minutes and it was done.Great recipe that I will make again.

I have been making this recipe for the last 2 years or so and it has never failed me! I made it for a bake sale a few times. Once I gave a sample of it to a guy and he bought every loaf I had after he tasted it! I add 1 tsp baking powder, 2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 white sugar 1/2 brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon. To cut some calories, a few times I've done 1/2 cup smart balance and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. Came out perfect. Definitely watch this bread the closer it gets to being done or it will get overly brown. Craisens are really good in this recipe along with just about anything you have in your pantry. I think I've tried it all. This is a weekly bread in our house. My 3 and 1 yr old daughter's love it!

I love banana nut bread and have made lots of different recipes but this one was one of the best. I used sunflower oil in place of butter and it still turned out great. I will try it with choc. chips next time .

this is the only banana bread recipe I will use from now on! I used half white flour and half whole wheat flour. I added another teaspoon of baking powder, used butter flavored shortening instead of butter, and added half a teaspoon of vanilla. I also sprinkled sliced almonds on top while baking. These loaves came out absolutely perfect.

This banana nut bread is a show stopper everytime.  I have been making this recipe (using 1 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, plus adding 2 tsps of cinnimon and 1 1/2 tsps of vanilla) for the past two years and everyone loves it.  I have never had any problems with it not raising.  In fact, last night I made 12 loaves for I had that many request from people.  My suggestions for those who say it has burned...turn down your overn to 325 degrees and start checking the bread around 45 minutes.  I have never cooked the bread at 350 degree for my oven cooks high and I have learned to watch it because of this. As for it being dark...no worries for the bread is still very good.  Happy Baking and Enjoy

I am suspect when someone says that their whatever is the best, however, this banana bread is Extremely good.  It made a very dark bread that did not rise much but the taste was out of this world.

This is my first time making banana nut bread and I must say that this recipe is fantastic! Very moist and flavorful :) It was a huge hit with my boyfriend's mom!  I did however make a few changes, based on the recommendations I found on the site.  I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla and did 1c white sugar and 1c brown sugar. Absolutely delicious!  A side note, I made a second batch the following day for my coworkers--and this time, they bottoms burned before it was even closed to being cooked.  The only thing I did differently, was that I baked two muffin tins at once, instead of one.  Could that have affected the results?

Hi, new member here.  I've made this recipe at least six times in the past couple of months.  I substitute Splenda for sugar and Blue Bonnet Lite for 1/2 to all of the butter.  The only time it turned out dry was when I used egg substitute.  I've made it in a 13x9x2 pyrex and in a 12" cast-iron skillet.  I bought two loaf pans yesterday just for this recipe.  Now I'm off to the kitchen to go make it again!

OMG! This recipe is sooo yummy. I'll never even try another.  The suggestions were right on.  I made the mistake of tasting the batter - let's just say one of the 2 loafs was small.  Also, I made it in my daughter's kitchen- she is of this new generation (32yrs) who doesn't have the time or inclination to cook and didn't have a cooling rack.  What I did was to take it out of the oven and put it on a cooled gas stove unit which is elevated.  It was Extremely Delicious

Love this recipe!  It tastes just like my Grandma's!  I did add 1 tsp. vanilla and divided the sugars 1/2 C. brown sugar and 1/2 C. white sugar.  Super good banana nut bread-this recipe is going into my favorites!

Wonderful!  My husband loves it too and he is picky.  We gave the second loaf to friends and it is their new favorite too.  I did like others said and added vanilla to the wet and cinnaman to the dry.  I will ad more cinnaman next time.

I'm sorry to say , it was just okay. Not bad, but not at all great. It is too dark, didn't crown, kind of greasy (all the butter), and is lacking something I haven't quite put my finger on yet. I followed the directions to the letter. I don't think I'll be trying it again.

Out of this world good! I have 2 in the oven right now and this place smells so yummy.  My son and husband says it's the best they've had so, I give you 5 stars and would add more if I could. It is an easy recipe to follow and I followed it through. We really enjoyed the banana nut bread and thanks for posting it!

This turned out great! I did split half brown sugar and half white. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. Everyone in the family loved it from a 5yr old to a 60yr old. :)

Delicious!  I have never been able to make good banana nut bread so was a bit nervous.  I did muffins and they were great; you can't eat just one.  These turned out so good that in discussing our Christmas morning recipe my daughter said I better not show up without these!  I did change recipe a wee bit. I used 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar. I blended sugars and shortening first, then eggs, then bananas, then dry, then add 1 tsp cinammon, 2 tsp vanilla, mixed well.  Then stirred in nuts. A definite go-to recipe for us!!

This has got to be the best ever! I also added vanilla and cinnamon. Just a word of caution - HIDE THIS....from yourself and from anyone within sniffing distance. I made a trial batch yesterday and am now making more to give out as client gifts....it's wonderful.

This week my son (8 years old) made this recipe as "muffins" for the county fair.  The judge's comments were "Delicious flavor.  Just the right amount of banana flavor.  Intense.  Moist - just not too moist."  He won a blue ribbon and GRAND CHAMPION!  Thank you for sharing this family recipe.  It will be forever in our collection.  You can now say what he calls it "Grand Champion Extreme Banana Nut Bread - GCEBNB"

Never tasted a banana nut bread/muffin this good. This is the second year we've made these, the only thing we tried different was the suggestion on a few reviews of splitting the sugars (half light brown & white), and throwing in a few golden raisins. If you don't like recipe, something is wrong with your taste buds or you didn't read the recipe well, after all, the positive reviews speak for themself.

This recipe is fail proof. I used butter flavored crisco,self rising flour (was out of all purpose), and brown sugar and it still turned out perfect. I made 1 loaf and then with the rest of the batter I threw in a cup of chocolate chips and made muffins. The muffins only took about 25 minutes to bake up. 

Since I used self rising flour, I omitted the salt, and only added 1 tsp of baking powder. Overall, a great recipe, and I really like that you don't have to have the exact ingredients...makes it easier to make on the fly.

This was too dense and flat for me, but that didnt stop me and my bf from splitting a loaf for breakfast. I like mine more like bread and not like cake, but was still good! I had a 9 by 5 metal and 9 by 4 smartware loaf pan. The metal one sank and the other one didnt. Maybe try a mini loaf or muffins for presentation purposes. The 9 by 5 might just be too big for this heavy batter. Bf LOVED it so 5 stars since i made it for him.

I did not want that much bread at one time, so I cut the recipe in half.  The one loaf I made is very good, but did get too brown on the edges.  Several others have talked about a lower temp, and less baking time.  I will try that next time.  I was looking for a dense, moist, flavorful banana nut bread, and this is it.  I always have a few overripe bananas in the freezer, so this is a great way to put together a great treat.

This recipe is the best banana bread I have ever had.  I am usually not that crazy about any of the "sweet" breads, but I really love this one.  I did use baking powder instead of baking soda, but only because I was out of baking soda.  Recipe is wonderful as is.

This recipe makes two loaves - I halved to make one loaf.  Adding the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients didn't sound right, but I did it anyway.  I just cut a piece and see a little bit of flour in the bottom of the loaf.  I would add the dry ingredients to the wet next time (if I ever make this again).  The loaf didn't rise like I'm used to - it stayed flat on the top.  I found this to be dense, somewhat oily and had a "rubbery" texture.  The walnut sank to the bottom half.  Took only 50 minutes for one loaf to bake.  Good taste, but I prefer the Best Ever Banana Bread recipe from this site, which calls for buttermilk (but you can sub 1/2 t. lemon juice and regular milk for the buttermilk - because who keeps buttermilk in the house?!).

I've made this three times and the texture is somewhat wet.  I think I prefer something a bit less damp.  And the flavor is a bit lacking.  My bananas were saved in the freezer after getting brown, so maybe that has something to do with it...

The flavor was incredible. The bread did fall, I am guessing it is because I live in Colorado which is high altitude and I'm not sure if this recipe is for high altitude. But the flavor was still amazing.

That is the best Banana Bread I've every eaten!  Even my mom liked it.  I did add 2 teaspoons of Vanilla, and I only cooked it 55 min. That was fantastic! On a scale from 1-5, I'd givit a 6!

This recipe sounded great with all the good reviews, but I found it to be just okay. I have used much better reicpes. Like other reviewers the sides got extremely dark and somewhat burned. It also did not rise hardly at all. The taste was okay but it lacked something.  I think I will stick to other recipes.

This is a great recipe-- the bread comes of moist and rich in flavor. What do you expect with 1 cup of butter and 4 eggs? :) The only things I do differently are I add about 1/4 cup extra nuts, which gives it even more crunch and richness. You should be careful not to overcook it though. I usually stick a toothpick in the center about 15 minutes before the established time and I usually take it out if it comes out clean. That way the loaf is moist and nicely golden in color. Also, depending on the ripeness of the bananas, I subtract some sugar. If the bananas are almost completely black, I take out about 1/4 cup, for instance.
GREDIENTS

    * 2 cups all-purpose flour
    * 1 teaspoon salt
    * 2 teaspoons baking soda
    * 1 cup butter or margarine
    * 2 cups white sugar
    * 2 cups mashed overripe bananas
    * 4 eggs, beaten
    * 1 cup chopped walnuts

If this banana nut bread tastes half as good as it smells in my oven  right now, I'll never need another recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added real vanilla extract (1 tsp), and 2 tsp of cinnamon. I also opted for brown sugar over white.

This was so easy to make. I actually put in twice the butter (unintentionally) but it tasted so good, I ate half the loaf in two days.

Literally amazing. Followed the recipe exactly. Accidentally bought hazelnuts but they still tasted great, despite the fact that I usually hate them. Make this bread NOW! Drizzle some chocolate sauce on them, while you're at it :O) It tasted like a sundae, that's how rich, moist and  delicious this bread is.

I made every mistake with this recipe possible.  I found myself short 3/4 cup bananas and ended up using vanilla yogurt as an emergency substitute.  I used raw sugar (light brown color)since I didn't have white, my loaf pans were too small and I ended up using 3 instead of 2.  And yet... it turned out wonderful.  This is a very forgiving recipe.  I highly recommend it!

We are a family of banana nut bread lovers.  And this recipe was alright.  We all felt that something was missing.  I think next time I will take the advice of others and add vanilla and cinnamon.  But it was a pretty good BNB.

As my name implies, I'm new at baking.  Though I've been cooking meals for quite a while, baking is an entirely different story.  That aside, I was looking for a recipe for Banana bread, since I had about four very overripe bananas just sitting in my fridge waiting for me to do something with them.  My mom has a killer Banana bread, but I wanted to try something new... so I looked around online and found this.  I baked my first (experimental) loaf and all I can say is it was amazing!  I added vanilla to the recipe, and a few more walnuts than was required (I'm a bit of a nut for nuts :D) I just wanted to thank you for this delicious recipe, I couldn't be happier with my first banana bread baking experience!

This bread is really good. I'm only giving it 4 stars though, because it turned out pretty dark when it cooked. I cooked 1 loaf in a dark pan and 1 loaf in a clear glass pan and both were equally dark. Perhaps if I lower the oven temp another 25 degrees? Other than that though, this bread is fabulously moist and wonderful. Don't over-beat your batter, and the bread will rise while cooking (I accidently beat mine too long, so the loaves didn't rise at all).

This recipe was sooooo amazing!  My husband and I love it!  I even substituted half the sugar with Splenda and substituted half the eggs with Egg Beaters, and it didn't even taste like I had made any substitutions.  We loved it!

I have made this several times now to nothing but rave reviews. A definite hit in our family and it does not last long once it is out of the oven. I did add some vanilla and because of my oven have to cook it a little less than the time posted.  Thanks for the great recipe!

YUM! The only thing I changed was I added 2 tblsp of real maple syrup and instead of 2 cups of sugar, I did 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar to it with a dash of cinnamon and I used butter instead of margarine. This is definitely not for dieters! My husband loved it! Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe! I would definitely suggest a tad vanilla and a little bit of cinnamon, just to enhance the flavor. Other than that, be sure to check the "doneness" after an hour, my oven needed a bit more time (it's a little older). This makes exactly two of the aluminum foil pans worth of bread and its all gone. ALso, I used roasted walnuts and it was a great addition, the salty to the sweet. EXCELLENT!

Anyone who had trouble with this recipe, doesn't know how to bake!  I only had 2 bananas so I cut the recipe in half.  It still came out fantastic!! My daughter HATES bananas or anything that has to do with bananas and I caught her sneaking a piece TWICE!!  I did mix all the wet ingredients and then added the dry ingredients slowly. I used half brown sugar and half white sugar and I added a 1/4 tsp. baking powder (I would use 1/2 tsp. for full recipe) and a dash of 
cinnamon.  FABULOUS BREAD!!

Excellent!  I made this and took a loaf to work and it was devoured in no time.  I love how it was so moist and so sweet.  It was also so easy to make.  My three year-old daughter and I had so much fun putting it together.

This was awesome bread.  I usually have a lot of bananas left over and I'll freeze them to make bread later and made about 3 loaves of this and loved it.  I took to a volleyball game and nothing was left when I was ready to go home!

Yum Yum.  An excellent and not ordinary banana bread.  It's definitely a keeper. I only changed the sugar to half white and half brown sugar as suggested in other reviews.  I omitted the cherries, hubby doesn't like them but I don't think it altered the recipe that much.  There was loots of batter, enough for a 9 inch loaf and an 8 inch one.

Other than halfing the recipe, I followed it exactly and just didn't really care for this banana bread.  It's not bad exactly, but not nearly as good as others that I've had.  It's very dark in color and the bread is very thick and heavy.  Other reviews loved the consistency of the bread, but it's just not what we're used to.  I'm not sure I'll try this recipe again, but certainly didn't mind giving it a shot.

This recipe was super moist and was a HUGE hit with my big family. I didn't print out the recipe ahead of time (as suggested) for others to have and am back now doing just that and writing this review. Thank you for a great Banana Nut Bread!

This Banana Nut Bread is PERFECT! My Grandmother has made everyone in our family BNB every year around Christmas.  She passed away last year so we didn't have any bread this year. Now, thanks to this recipe we can have good BNB again.  My mom made some last week and it didn't last 2 days. Very close to Grandma's!

I just cut the first slice of this recipe! It is wonderful! I did change the recipe a little based on the reviews. I replaced half of the suggested butter with unsweetened applesauce, I only used 1 1/2 c. sugar, and I added vanilla, nutmeg, and cinimmon.

This bread is amazing! It tastes wonderful and is very easy to make.  

I have made this bread many times, and i found the cooking time to be wrong on the recipes.  My bread burned when i followed the cooking time.  For me, 45 minutes bakes the perfect bread

I'm not quite sure what happened. I think the oven temp is to high, the top got VERY dark before the bread was even close to done. For the next loaves I reduced the temp to 300 and it turned out better. Otherwise this is a delicious banana bread and I'll definetly make it again.

Awesome!!!  I make 3 loafs and they were gone in 6 hours. The Hubby loves banana bread and has fell inlove with this recipe. I added 1tsp cinnamon, 1tsp vanilla and split the sugar by doing half white and half brown. EXCELLENT!!

By far the best banana nut bread I have ever had. I actually threw away my old recipe that I have been using for years. This recipe is so yummy and moist. It may be my oven, but I only bake it for 50 minutes. 60 minutes is too long.

I have made this several times and have come up with healthier versions using 1/2  wheat flour, using 1/2 splenda, and canola oil.  I also use part applesauce or mash a pear if I don't have enough bananas.  It always turns out yummy and it never lasts long.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

My first attempt at baking for 23 years...This was great and really easy to make. I am a complete novice (OK so I used to bake with my mum when I was a kid but that doesn't count). I also do not really have the "tools" for cooking so I tend to use what ever is handy. After using many small bowls and lot of elbow power (making an extreme banana mess) this cake came out lovely. I used butter and only brown sugar (because i forgot about the white sugar) and baked the mixture in a small roasting dish (it was all I had) for 2 hours this cake came out amazing...it also rose a bit which means I probably got confused between baking soda and powder. It was fabuolous everyone loved it and it lasted and stayed fresh for over a week (I guess I made too much). it truely is impossible to get it wrong. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent flavor and texture.  I used pecans instead of walnuts and only 1 3/4 cups of sugar.  Next time I will try 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  Great receipt and a definate KEEPER!  Thanks for sharing.

This is an awesome recipe for banana nut bread. Turns out very dense and yummy. I covered the top with foil for the last 10 minutes so the top wouldn't burn, maybe that is my oven though. Thanks!

Made 2 loaves; one for our family and another for friends. I was worried that it was baked for too long because it was a very dark-looking bread. Luckily nothing was wrong and everyone loved it. Good, rich flavor!

I have made this twice in the last month for family get togethers, It truly is gone in seconds.  My bananas are usually gone within a few days when I bring them home from the grocery, but now I think my kids and my husband purposely let them overripe, so that I will make some more EBNB.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is the best banana nut bread I've made.  It never lasts long at our house.  I usually add ground flax seed to the recipe and make a mixture of cinnamon, brown sugar and ground flax seed topping that I add about half way through baking.

I'm not a great cook, this banana nut bread recipe made me look like I was!  I LOVE this recipe!  Don't change a thing, read the instructions and follow them to the "T".  Wrap the bread in foil, and watch it disappear.

I don't generally make banana bread, simply because every recipe I've used tends to run on the dry side, but this one is amazing! It was so moist and even my 18month old loved it. This is one I will be using time and again.

AMAZING!  If you want buttery moist banana bread then this is your recipe! I added 2 tsp vanilla extract and substituted wheat flour to make it a bit more "healthy" and it came out great.

Since I first tried this recipe over a month ago, I have made about fifteen loaves! This is the best BNB I have ever had! I also added 3 tablespoons of cream cheese to the batter and it made this bread even more rich! I would not suggest this for healthy eaters! Thank you so much for this recipe! God bless...

I was concerned about the amount of butter in this bread, so I substituted 1/2 cup of pureed cauliflower for one stick of butter.  Sounds strange...I know, but I try and sneak in veggies whenever I can.  The bread was delicious.  You would never know that I had made the change.

WAY too sweet. The added sugar kills the natural banana flavor. Ok to try once.

This is the best banana bread ever.  The whole family loves it.  I use 1 c whole wheat flour and 1 cup white.  I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and I add 1 tsp of vanilla.  I buy extra bananas often just so I can make this.  It makes 4 mini loaves to give away.

Oh wow what an excellent recipe! My husband is a very very picky person when it comes to desserts he is not much of a sweet tooth until this recipe came along, he thought it was so good he ate 1/2 the loaf by himself! thank you for such a great recipe I am actually making another three loaves today for him to share with all his Navy guys.  Thank you again! Kudos to you!!!

This was just o.k.  Nothing phenominal.  I have used a few other recipes that I liked way better.  I will not use this one again.  The cinnamon and sugar around the outside of the bread dish was awesome though and will definately do that on EVERY banana bread I make.

I followed the advice  to add 1t. vanilla, 1t. cinnamon, half brown sugar, half white, and 1/2t. baking powder.  The flavor is amazing, however, my loaves flopped in the middle. I may need to tweek the baking powder/soda amounts and try again!

This is the best banana bread - not the healthiest, but so great... My husband made this bread and added 1 more whole banana and it was soooo good! He put most in a loaf pan then the rest in a muffin pan - he burned the muffins a little but it was actually very good as the sugar became a little crunchy on the outside.  This will be my staple banana bread recipe for a long time to come.

This bread is amazing!  Its the closest I have ever gotten to the bread my mother used to make.  I followed some of the other reviewers and added some vanilla extract and cinnamon.  I also put in half brown sugar, half white sugar and used pecans instead of walnuts.  I will absolutely make this bread again!

ohhhhh my!!! Heaven! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! I have already made it twice! Your warning of getting addicted should be taken seriously! The only thing I changed was that I used smartbalance butter instead of the real thing. So it cut some of the calories, and I am not a big nut fan, so I didnt add those. I know thats probably sacrelig, but hey I was cooking it! : ) My husband and our family are now addicted to it, I made one tonight for him to bring to his office. Its just soooo simple!

This recipe ROCKS! I've been making banana nut bread for years but this is by far the best recipe.  The bread was really dense and moist.  Family and co-workers loved it.

First of all, let me start by saying that I altered the recipe somewhat.  I did do the 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar as suggested by previous reviews and that did make a nice difference. I didn't have walnuts, but threw in all different kinds of nuts (unsalted) from my pantry to make up a cup and the candied walnuts were terrific in this recipe - I'd like to make it again using just those.  I think this would also be delicious with some chocolate chips added.  Overall, I think that this recipe is very easy to tailor to your own tastes - it was a bit on the greasy side for me though and maybe not enough banana taste.  I may try to make again using 1/2 butter and 1/2 applesauce.  I did add vanilla extract, I think next time I'll add more banana though (maybe an extra 1/2 cup or so) or find some banana extract.  Will definitely make again with alterations.

I made this with a gluten-free flour (celiac) and it worked wonderfully. Delicious and moist. This is better than my mom's banana bread recipe which I've been making for years. My kids ate a slice when it was warm out of the oven, another slice for dessert, and they're begging for more. I'd call that a success - thanks for an excellent recipe!

This is the BEST Banana bread, I split the sugar 1/2 brown & 1/2 white & added  extra crushed walnuts on top as well incorporated into batter. Found out really important to mix the wet really good & add dry a little at a time. Lowered overn to 325 & it lasted almost 24 hours in my house (because I hid half).rich moist dark & very flavourful

After reading several of the reviews and slight variations, I tried this recipe with pecans instead of walnuts. I took a loaf to work and my co-workers devoured it within minutes. Definitely will make this again!

This was delicious. It is easy for a novice baker. I split the batter into 6 small loaf tins and it came out great. My husband ate 5 out of the 6 loaves. This is one of his favorite snacks now.

It has been awhile since I made this, but I do remember that I accidently overcooked the recipe. Overall it was good, but Bob Evan's banana bread is still the best I have ever had.

This is awesome. I had to distribute it immediately because I would have eaten it all by myself. I was low on butter and had to use what will now be my secret ingredient and it still came out incredible. I found that the full 60 minutes wasn't necessary for my oven. If you know your oven is a little off, keep an eye on it so it doesn't burn. As soon as I get more bananas, I'm going to try to make a (slightly) more health conscious version.

This is exelent stuff! Moist, delicious, everything you could want in a banana bread recipe. I used half whole wheat and half white flour, and half white half brown sugar. When it came out of the oven it was kind of flat, and I thought maybe I screwed it up, but I was wrong. Easily the best banana brerad I have ever made.

It really is delcious! Probably the best I've made. After refrigerating it, the bread became so moist and tasty! The only thing is the sides and bottom of the bread came out a little burnt but that is probably due to my oven. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with us!

This recipe is awesome! It's so easy to make and it is SO moist! I tried brown sugar instead of regular sugar. It was good but a bit on the sweet side for me so next time I'll just reduce it a little. My kids went bonkers over it and I can't wait to have it for breakfast with my coffee....YUM!

I made half of this recipe, it is excellent in taste and appearance. I added 2 big spoons of cinnamon, and it came out of the oven a beautiful rich, dark brown in color.Next time I will use chocolate chips instead of nuts.

This was extremely delicious, and it did taste better the next day after refrigerating, the flavors melded together very well.  But I won't be able to make it very often due to health and diet considerations.  I'll keep looking for healthier BNB options.

EBNB is definitely extreme.  I had a little trouble getting it to cook through, but that very well could've been my fault for either not cooking it long enough, or adding too many bananas!  The bad thing is, I didn't find out it wasn't done until the next morning, after the loaves were already wrapped in foil.  I was hoping to have a slice for breakfast, but found out it was still very wet inside.
However, the smell overtook me, and I did take a little nibble off one of the COOKED corners (ha) and it was great (that's why I gave it 5 stars).  Maybe I'll try cooking them through later tonight, or I could just try the recipe again with half the bananas.  Either way, I'm glad you posted this recipe and I'll definately keep trying it until I get it right.  It smelled too good to give up now!!!

I would rate this a 4.5 if I could only because we found a slightly better banana nut bread recipe (Banana Nut and Ginger Bread).  I will make this one again if I don't have all of the ingredients on hand for the other one.

Very good. I also used 1/2 brown sugar and a teaspoon vanilla. Also cooked for just under an hour. Would recommend 55 mins. Will make this often.

Made this in a half quantity with metric measurments. Turned out lovely. My French friends who have never tried banana bread before were impressed, and when it comes to all things culinary, they are not easily impressed. Easy to make, basic great recipie.

Fantastic recipe!  I doubled the recipe and made two 5lb loaves.  As such, I upped the time to 1hr 45min at 375.  It was PERFECT!  I also added chocolate chips to the mix and it was YUM YUM YUM!  Thanks!

Made this exactly to recipe and it was PERFECT! I was a little concerned about how dark the outter edges were turning so soon in the oven...but it was excellent. It was a much darker loaf than I normally make, but the dark crust had a nice chewy texture to it. 

I used chocolate chips instead of walnuts as I didnt have any. I will definately be making this recipe again!

Very tasty and was gone in a flash. Gave a loaf to my brother who also seemed to like it. Noticed it was very dense, loaf wasn't as tall as normal. My mistake? Either way was yummy!

oh, my!!!  i've made banana nut bread before and it was good, but was looking for something new.  my sons (who are not fans of banana bread) loved it!!! I LOVE it.  I used 1 stick of margarine and 1/2 cup butter flavored crisco, and 2/3 cup splenda for baking and 1/3 cup splenda brown sugar blend.  i also added a bit of cinnamon.  I like a bit of a chewy crust so i turned it out of the pan as soon as it came out of the oven.  thanks, i'll DEFINATELY make again!

Awesome!  This was my first time to make banana nut bread... it was so easy!  I only had 3 bananas which came out to be  1 1/2 cups but it still turned out great!  I will definately make this again.  My 1 year old son LOVES it!

Absolutely unbelievable!!!!  I've had tons of banana bread in my life and this is the best, no question!!  My husband LOVES it and we make it all the time.  Heed the warning, however, it's totally habit forming... usually it disappears within two or three days.  DELICIOUS!!  I omitted the nuts and added more sugar.

I love this recipe! I'm not one to normally eat banana nut bread, but this recipe is awesome! I've made it numerous times since finding it on the site. The first time I made it, however, it came out a little too done, so now I don't bake it quite as long.

Terrific banana bread.  Wonderful taste and texture.  I made 2 batches, one with walnuts and one without.  Both were great.  The only problem I had was that they all stuck to the pan pretty badly.  I don't know what I could have done differently--I sprayed the pans, etc.  Will definitely try again.

Wonderful recipe! The loaves came out very dark and I thought they might taste kinda burned but they were heavenly!!! I shared one loaf with a new neighbor and we inhaled the other loaf. Must make more soon. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was a great recipe!  I'm always trying different banana bread recipes to find the "one" and this is almost it!  I added about 2 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, 3/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 light brown sugar and ommitted the walnuts.  I made 1 loaf and 12 muffins.  Yummy!

This recipe was good and is my go too banana bread.  Very moist bread and tasty.  I use only 3/4 cup of butter instead of 1 cup, and 1 cup sugar total 1/2 cup dark brown sugar,  1/2 cup white  and a little bit extra banana.  I also added a tsp of cinnamon, and a tsp of vanilla extract. I also put cinnamon sugar in the pans instead of flour. I doubled the recipe and made 5 medium loafs and they were done in about an hour.  The family loved them!

WOW.  This bread turned out PERFECT.  I only have one 9x3 pan, so after putting about half (or a little more) of the batter in that pan, I made the rest into exactly 12 muffins - it measured out perfectly!  I put the muffins and the bread in at the same time, but the muffins were done after only about 25-30 minutes, while the bread was done in about 55 minutes.  It took me about 3 large, over-ripened bananas for the 2 cups worth.  AWESOME RECIPE!!

A good bread, but the flavor of the butter almost overpowers the banana.  It is very moist which is great as I hate a dry banana bread.  I also made some muffins with this recipe and they turned out good.

my mother the biggest food critic defined these as "very elegant, not the old fashioned grandma banana bread, but something that you would find as desert at a fancy restuarant."  that made me feel great inside.  I topped off the bread with some brown sugar, oats and almonds on the top.  Very moist!

I found this to be very good.  I liked the texture and banana taste.  Added 1 tsp baking powder and 2 tsp vanilla as was suggested by earlier reviewer.  Made 4 medium size loaves, next time will just make 3, as this doesn't raise as much as some.  Will definitely make again.

Easy to make and tasty, however I did not find it to be as life-altering as some of the other reviewers have. I will try again to see if I just didn't get the full effect or something. Otherwise, I am still searching for the One True Banana Nut Bread Recipe.

Everytime I use this recipe it is gone within minutes. USE WITH CAUTION and always hide some for yourself later.

Best banana bread ever! Added another 1/2 cup of nuts and 1 tsp vanilla. Also, keep a close eye on it, it didnt take as long to bake as the recipe states. Do make 2 loaves, you will need them!

Awesome and easy. I halved the recipe to make 1 loaf, and used one overripe banana which I did not measure. Added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp vanilla; used half white sugar and half brown and used real butter. :P Also upped the walnuts to 1 cup. This is a dark bread, kind of crisp outside, moist inside. Will definately make again. Thank you and your mom!

The first time I tried this it came out a bit darker than what I am used to though it did not affect the delicous flavor. The second time I tried this, I baked it for 50 min instead of the 60-70 min as instructed and not only did it turn out lighter, but extremely moist and flavorful. I purposely buy more bannanas than what I need just so I have a reason to make this! Great recipe....

Wonderful! We all gave it thumbs up in my home. It was nice and moist. It was also great to actually TASTE banana. The only thing I would do differnt next time is add more walnuts. Can't wait to see how it is after being frozen and thawed. Thanx for the fantastic recipe!

Really good!!!  I'm a banana nut bread novice, and my first batches turned out just fine.  I added a little almond extract and cinnamon as another member recommended, which was good but not a major change.

I halved this recipe for one loaf and the middle didn't cook well.  It was far too buttery-tasting, too.  Maybe my oven was off, but I think more than 1 cup of flour is needed for one loaf.

I used macadamia's instead of walnuts - this bread disappeared really quickly and was very easy to make.

This recipe is fantastic!  It is so moist and flavorful, and is very predictable!  I just add a little cinnamon for extra flavor.  The neighbors loved it for Christmas!

This Banana bread is THE BEST!  I took it to work and it was gone in 10 minutes.  My co-workers were eating it with cream cheese and loved it!  This has to be the best banana nut bread I've ever made!  Yummy!!!

Very good , and yes, very addictive.  I used butter and half brown/half white sugar.  You can fell the sin.  I was also put off by the dark color of the bread, but once you take a bite you won;t care.
