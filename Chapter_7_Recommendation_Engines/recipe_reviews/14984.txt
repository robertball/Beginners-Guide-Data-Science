We love this cake! Followed the recipe as written, but used a 9x13 pan, and baked at 350. Topped it with a simple brown sugar glaze. The batter seems very dry at first, but when it cooks, the moisture from the apples makes it perfect.

The batter was dry.  I thought there was a wet ingredient missing.  I would advice that you mix all the wet together first and then combine.  The end procuct was delicious and moist.  Very tasty.

This is an outstanding apple cake.  I have taken it to several affairs and everyone wants the recipe.  It is so fast also.  My son and daughter have also taken it to church and school events and received many compliments.  As parents of young children they have little time for baking and appreciate how fast this recipe is.

This cake was not good to me, something was missing; substance. It tasted gooey. Too many apples and cinanmon for my taste buds. Try my recipe for comparison.

This is a great recipe - all the flavors of fall. Wonderful with a little whipped cream on top. I used an 8"x8" pan (smaller than the pan called for in the recipe), but everything fit - it just needed a slightly longer baking time. I used pecans, instead of walnuts, decreased the oil to 1/4 cup, and added 1/2 cup of applesauce. It was wonderful - really dense and moist, just like a recipe my mother used to make.

This recipe was pretty good.  My husband, not a huge sweets fan, really liked this one.  I did make changes, however, so I'm not sure how true the 5 stars are.  Rather than refined sugar, I used Turbinado (that's all I use), and rather than vanilla, I used honey (it's all I had!).  I chopped up a batch of apples given to me by my neighbors, so I have no idea which type they were, using a baby food maker.  This works great b/c you can basically do it in one-cup increments and adjust to your taste.  I did have to cook it a bit longer than the recipe calls for (using all 5 1/2 cups of apple, I cooked in a 9x9 for 55 minutes @ 325)but it turned out great.  It's dense and *very* moist, like a wet sponge.  But the flavor's great, and the kids loved it!

A great cake! I used crab apples from my backyard tree and the cake turned out great.  My family prefers more cinnamon with apples so next time I would add 3 teaspoons.  The batter did seem quite dry until I mixed in the apples using my hands. After that, the moisture from the apples helped.  I would make this again and serve it with Cool Whip. I also used an 8 X 8 pan and it worked well.

was kind of puzzled because the "batter" was dry, but when you add the apples it looks like a batter. Family just loved it. I baked it in a Bunt pan and sprinkled brown sugar, cinnamon and apples on the bottom before pouring the batter in and baked for 1 hr to carmelize the brown sugar and apples.

Starts off a little suspicious due to quantity of batter, but after adding apples is excellent.  Recommend not using thick apple slices.  Use your peeler to shave apple slices into the batter, creates consistency in the apple pieces.

Glad I didn't listen to the reviewers that gave this a poor rating.  As I was mixing the apples and walnuts into the batter, I thought "this can't be right...there are entirely too many apples and not enough batter!".  But I'm not too proud to admit when I'm wrong.  And was I wrong!  This cake is moist, chocked full of apples and walnuts, and definitely a keeper.  The only note I would add is that I greased and floured my 9x9 baking pan, since I am used to doing that anyways.  I'm glad I did.  The cake pops right out.  Try this cake!

What an awesome harvest cake!  So moist & hearty, just delicious.  I did make a couple of changes, some as suggested by other reviewers.  #1, I added a 3rd egg.  #2, I used cake flour instead of all-purpose flour.  #3, I topped it with a simple glaze (2 c. powdered sugar, 1/4 c. melted butter, 1 tsp. vanilla extract...then add skim milk to thin to desired consistency).  Our family ate it up & our guests went on & on.  Will make again for sure!!!

I had been craving an apple cake for ten years and this cake hit the spot. I devoured the cake in one day...by myself! Don't be alarmed by the dry batter. The finished product will be perfect.

I searched for an apple cake to use up some apples going bad.  I have made this recipe twice so far and my family loves it so much I can’t keep it any longer then desert and breakfast. DOES not need any more moisture.  When you mix your ingredients it seems dry until you add the apples. Make as is and mix apples as stated until all are covered and your mixture turns a light tan color.  I use a 10” round pan. I wouldn’t use anything smaller.

I have made this so many times now.  It is absolutely wonderful!  You do have to be careful when picking which kind of apples you put in it though.  Some of them just don't taste good at all.
A lot of people say that the batter is entirely too dry.  This isn't the case.  True, before you put in the apples, it's about the consistency of a crumb topping.  And once you put the apples in, you think there's no way you're ever going to get them all coated, but keep at it.  It will get better.  Once it's fully mixed, it still looks like there are too many apples in it.  This is fine.  It will still bake up into a beautiful cake.
I've used cream cheese frosting on this, but I've also found that leaving it plain and then having the caramel cream frosting (recipe on this site) as a glaze is quite good too.  I put the glaze in a bottle off to the side and squirt it on whenever I need it.
Even though I give this 5 stars, I do have one complaint.  It always takes so much longer to cook than indicated here.  For instance, one time I made a 3 layer cake, cooked it for 90 minutes, and at that point it was just hot batter.  It baked for 4 hours before it finally got done.  This oven has never had any problems before or has had any problems since.  Only this cake has issues.  All I can guess is I've been getting super juicy apples.
Not a huge complaint as long as I allow for plenty of time.

Very moist, very tasty! I added 2 Tbsp milk to batter, increased apples to 6 cups and decreased sugar to 3/4 C. I also, topped cake with a brown sugar glaze. Mix 1/3 C Brown sugar splenda, 2 Tbsp butter, handful walnuts and 1 Tbsp milk in pan. Heat until bubbly. Pour over cooling cake.  This is probably the best cake I ever had!

This was so amazing!  My kids love it so much I make it and put it in their lunch for snacks.  When I made it the first time I thought the recipe would not turn out as the batter is so thick and there is so many apples, I was wrong.  Don't be decieved by this.  Mix the apples very well in the batter, it will cook better this way.  If it does not turn out then you did something wrong, try again!  I've made this 12 times and have yet to have it not turn out.

This recipe is great! I used butter rather than oil, and baking powder rather than soda. In any case, it was delicious. Figs, raisin or other additions could be made if desired. Baked at the recommended temperature in a 8x11" pan for 40 minutes.
Yummm!

i've done this twice, once with two granny smith apples (unpeeled), once with four. i swapped the white sugar for dark brown and added a cup of liquid (i used plain water, but milk or juice is fine) to create a more fluid, smoother batter. i read one review that claims the juice from the apples adds enough liquid, but i kind of doubt that works. GS apples definitely don't add liquid. but if i made this twice, even with the changes, that means it's good and easy, and it is. we love it.

I liked this cake, but made a few adjustments.  I substituted 1/2 cup melted butter for the oil because I like the taste of butter and decreased the sugar so that I used 1 cup total. I also substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for 1 cup of the white flour.  The second cup of flour, I used self-rising flour, because it was what I had in the cupboard.  With the use of the self-rising flour, I decreased the leavener so that I used 1 tsp baking soda total.  Finally, the batter was dry, so I added about 1/4 cup milk.  I baked it in a bundt pan (open cylinder in the middle).  The final result was very tasty... cakey but had a nice density to it (from the whole wheat flour) and not too sweet, but definitely sweet enough.  I also think the whole wheat flour complemented the rustic apple nature of the cake.  I will definitely make this again.

This turned out amazingly well.  I was concerned however when there was twice the amount of apple in the bowl as there was batter.  I was going to put in the walnuts but didn't see how they'd ever fold in. No matter though, once it baked, it nicely formed into a cake, the baking soda and eggs doing their thing.  And there definitely wound up being plenty of room for walnuts.  Hot out of the oven, the cake was kinda dry.  Three days later, it's moist and tasty, and you'd think you got a deal if you paid $3 for a piece at your local cafe.

This cake is really good! The recipe as is, is really dry, so I added 1/4 cup of milk (for serving for 6) and it came out perfect.

My family and friends think I'm a really good cook.  However, they don't usually give me high marks for my baking and frankly I don't blame them. It's really not my thing!  I made this Amazing Apple Cake and an amazing thing happened.  EVERYONE loved it.

It was ridiculously easy to make and soooooooo tasty, I recommend it for a simple, no fuss, nutritious and easy recipe. I just felt that it needed more oil or water to the ingredients mentioned as the batter was very dry initially.

Very dry mixture.   I followed the recipe exactly.  This mixture did not turn into batter.  It turned into crumble.  I thought it might fool me and bake up into a cake, but basically I got an apple crisp that tasted fine.

Moist and fluffy! An easy and yummy recipe.  I didnt have enough apples, so I used 4 cups of apples and a third of a cup of applesauce. Didnt have walnuts either so left those out.  Came out wonderful! Will make this again for sure.

This cake was good but I think it had too many apples in it.  I had to cook quite a bit longer than the recipe called for.  If I make it again, I would put less apples in.  But the taste was great!

Very good recipe if you like a strong cinnamon taste (which we do).  I chopped up 4 small apples and that seemed to do the job.  I was lazy to measure the apples but 5 c. + seemed a lot to me.  Moist and yummy!

Absolutely delicious! I added extra cinnamon as a previous reviewer suggested.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts.  I recommended blending the mix in a food processor for the best results.

I guess I'm not a huge fan of apple cakes in general; this seemed a bit soggy and was not a huge hit at home.  I grated the apples which definitely took care of any moisture problem.  I only used a half-recipe because 5.5 cups of grated apples much more than it sounds.  Also, grating the apples makes them oxidize all over and after I'd grated about 2 or 3 cups they were turning pretty dark brown, so I had to use them right away.  I didn't have any nuts; maybe that was a problem.  I did layer sliced apples over the top and sprinkled cinnamon sugar--it helped the presentation a lot.  After my boyfriend & his roommates didn't eat this cake, I took it to work and everyone loved it.  So I wouldn't say it was bad, just ok.

To make up for the dryness of the batter , I chopped the apples in the food processor , so that they would be a finer dice , but produce more moisture , too . I then use my hands to mix the batter , which releases even more juice from the apples ! Try this - it really worked wonders for this cake . It needs a bit more time in the oven than this recipe states , I also found . Overall though , a good cake .

This cake is absolutely fantastic.  I made some tiny changes:  I subbed light brown sugar for white sugar.  I only put in one tsp of cinnamon.  I subbed melted butter for oil.

This is a very very apple-y, superdense, moist cake...just how I like 'em!!!  Yes the batter looks bizarre when you have everything in there but the apples, but just DO IT and put the apples in...it works.  I cut the apples into really tiny pieces and that made it moist.  To save some time, I used a corer/sectioner that divides into 12 pieces then sliced the sections very thin and small.  I used I think 3 medium Granny Smiths and one red delicious.  I baked it in a 10-inch Lodge cast iron skillet.

This recipe will be in my permanent collection.  It's everything I love in a fruit cake!!

Excellent apple cake! It's very moist and came out perfect.  I added a brown sugar crumble topping (sugar, flour, butter) and a brown sugar glaze (sugar, water, vanilla) after it had cooled to make it more like a coffee cake. Put it in a 9x13 pan and baked for 40 minutes in a 350 oven. Came out delicious!

I really don´t understand people who said this wasn´t a great cake or didn´t care....whaaaaaaat?, it´s absolutely AWESOME, sweet enough, moist, so yummy! and if you add a bit of nutmeg and raisins will be even better. Yes the batter is dry, but it turns out great. I´m not in the US, I´m writing from Peru, Cusco, so this recipe works everywhere.

Excellent cake.  I made it as stated except I used only one teaspoon cinnamon.  It really needed the extra teaspoon.  I found the batter to be very stiff, so I added about 3/4 cup apple juice.  This recipe is very similar to a very old recipe my MIL gave me, and I had to add apple juice to her recipe, too.  I baked the cake in a 9" springform pan.  I'll use a 9x13 next time.  I withheld the extra star because it really does need more liquid.

this was amazing!  we made it with granny smith apples and it was delicious!  i don't like baked apples but i loved this cake.  it's not too sweet which is nice.  if you want to sweeten it up, just add white frosting to it and it's perfect!

Ummmm... not sure what happened with this recipe, very disappointed. When combining the ingredients it seemed like there were way too many apples for the amount of dry ingredients. Cooked it a warm piece right out of the oven was good but later that night and the next day it was a gooey, soft, mushy cake Yuck. Sorry.

I have been cooking for 20+ years. I say this only because this review is from an experienced cook.  This receipe was a disaster.  I cooked it for 25 minutes more than the recommended time and it was a gooey, mushy, mess.  I followed the directions exactly so I have no idea why my cake came out so differently than everyone elses. How could I improve it?  I have no idea. But for starters, too many apples for a 9 X 9 pan, too much cinnamon, too little flour? I wish I would have gotten the same results as everyone else but I didn't.  Good luck with this one.

Delicious. As others said, the batter seems dry, but the cake ends up very moist. I only used 2.5 cups of apples and it still tasted great. Kids loved it and asked for more!

There must be an ingredient missing from the recipe.  I had to add milk to thin the batter down.  The apples did not cook thoroughly even though I baked it for an additional 10 minutes.
It was not moist.

I made this for the ladies in my investment club along with some cherry almond biscotti, my husband was hoping there would be some of this cake left over......sorry, there was none.
This cake was so wonderful plus, so easy, it was no problem to make another.  It's a great way to use up those apples that have been lingering in the fruit bowl, just chop them up finely, half inch pieces are too big. I also used a big teaspoon of cinnamon, don't worry about the dryness of the batter, it all works!

I made it exactly as the recipe called for with the exception of using pecans because I didn't have walnuts.  I put it in my angel food pan because it has straight sides whereas the bundt is sculpted and I wasnt sure how it would turn out. It was very dry!! to salvage it I made a butterscotch sauce to pour over.  Would not make this recipe again but if I did I would add applesauce.

Add 1 tsp of salt to the dry ingredients to bring out the flavor better. Without salt the taste is a little flat. I agree - 350 degrees is better. It took an extra 20 minutes at 325. I used a deep pie dish and substituted pears for apples and it was wonderful. (I wanted to make a cake and pears were all I had!)

Delicious, moist, flavourful! The only modifications I did was decrease the oil by half ( I used cold pressed olive oil) and the sugar by about 2 tablespoons, also and made a streusel topping to cover the top. I also added a bit of grapefruit rind to the egg mixture for fun. :) Here's the recipe I used for the streusel.  

3/4 cup sugar
3/4 cup flour
1 tablespoon water
1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
1/4 cup butter, softened

Mix all ingredients until crumbly.

This apple cake is amazing.  I was looking for a recipe that used a 9X9 pan and ran across this recipe.  The batter is very dry before adding the apples and I ended up using my hands to mix the batter and then again when I added the apples-I wasn't sure what the outcome would be but the cake turned out delicious.  I've made it twice using only 1 Cup of sugar and about 4 cups of apples but next time will use the full 5 1/2 cups of apples.  I've always used the apple cake recipe from the Betty Crocker cookbook and I thought this recipe was much better.  More apples, less batter and it was very moist.

I followed this recipe to the tee, with the exception of the pan size.  I used a 9"x13" pan which was the only one I had that was closest to the 9"x9" pan size called for in the recipe. This turned out GREAT!!! I too thought it would be dry as it had no texture to hold it together when I dumped it in the pan. Alas! It all held together perfectly and was very moist. Was great topped with ice cream. Will definitely make this every apple season!

Something was missing.....Momma would say it tasted too "fresh." I wish I had either used self-rising flour or thought to add a pinch of salt. I made up for it by adding a brown butter glaze and the kids ate it up!!

The mixture was too dry, and I hate to add orange juice to moisten.  I also cut down the sugar to one cup.

A very good recipe. I used a little less sugar and oil and added applesauce making it a bit healthier and it also helped making it mix easier. It wasn't dry at all and like other readers found it to be better the next day. I used pecans instead of walnuts because thats what I had on hand. I served with powdered sugar & a some whipped cream.

Sadly, I didn't think this was amazing.  It wasn't good and it wasn't bad.  I just didn't think was memorable.  It smelled great when it was baking.  It's missing something flavor-wise.
