I made this as a smaller dish and it came out great.  I didn't have mushrooms, so I increased the other veggies.  Used homemade spaghetti sauce.  I will make this again and possibly add more seasoning.

This is so good! I split my final product (pre-baking) into two casserole dishes. This way i was able to take one to a party, and save one for another day!  I just threw it in the fridge and it baked up beautifully two days later. It might even taste a little better too, because all the flavors have had a chance to mingle together. This is such an awesome recipe! Everyone asked me for my secret... haha

Very good pasta dish even after tweaking the amounts to a reasonable serving size.  I will probably work on it a little more, but will definitely have it again!

Could you use any more dishes is this recipe?? Load a full dishwasher after dinner... That aside, maybe I'm not made for vegetarianism, because this was.only okay. Certainly not something I'll try again. It needed more cheese, and I did do this scaled down to 12 serving.

This was good!  I did make a few changes, reduced the recipe to 3 servings as it's just 2 of us.  I ended up using a 26oz jar of pasta sauce which is more than the recipe calls for, but we really like our pasta saucy.  I also added a little more ricotta cheese, just because!  Sautéed onions and cooked those with the carrots.  I also added more onion powder, garlic powder, basil and oregano because the pasta sauce I had on hand was a little bland.  Do not over boil the noodles, I was busy prepping other things that I didn't take it out of the boiling water right away and my noodles were too tender!

My wife is a vegetarian and so is my 2 year old son so I found this baked ziti recipe to try and liked that it was healthier than just your typical baked ziti with just sauce & cheese. Here is what I changed-  I halfed the pasta just one box (and use Barilla's protein plus penne) , omitted the carrots, added 1 onion, doubled the garlic,  Instead of using Italian seasoning, I added 3 tablespoon fresh basil & 1 teaspoon oregano.  doubled the ricotta cheese, added I cup shaved parmesan cheese on top. I used regular mozzarella instead of Italian cheese blend. ( I don't know how 2 boxes of pasta would've fit it barely all fir in the baking dish as it was with one box.)  I ended up sautéing the veggies longer so I only had to bake it for 45 min. I thought 1 1/2 hours seemed to long anyways. The family loved it! It was a big hit!

I thought it was fairly bland.
