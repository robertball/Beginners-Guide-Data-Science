I had a taste of soybean bread once in a little Mom and Pop diner, and haven't been able to find it anywhere (bakery or book) since, until now! This is a lovely recipe, quite easy to make (I am a first time bread maker), and it has a delicious flavor. Thanks Bob!

I tried this bread because it sounded interesting and different, but I found it to be a little strange. The taste and preparation was kind of weird, although I really liked the crunchy crust on this loaf. The rest of the bread was very dense, and I just didn't like the taste.
