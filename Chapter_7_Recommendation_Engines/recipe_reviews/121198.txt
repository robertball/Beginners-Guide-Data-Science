This was great!  Instead of mayo I used sour cream and also subsituted parmesan cheese for the cheddar (because of what I had on hand).  Tasted even better the next day.  Thanks!

This is an excellent casserole that I will make over and over again!  I added a can of diced water chestnuts that brought just the right crunch to this dish.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I used fat free sour cream instead of mayo, healthy request soups and weight watchers shredded cheese. This casserole was so good I couldn't even tell it was reduced fat.

I made a half batch of this since there is only 2 of us.  The change I made was to use fresh broccoli rather than frozen and my soup was fat-free.  I just pre-cooked the broccoli in the microwave for 3 minutes before adding it to the casserole.  The results:  a nice, warm, filling meal that was loaded with flavor.  This is very good - you should give it a try.

Two cups of cheese was way, way too much for us, so the second time I made it, I just sprinkled a handful of cheese over the top of the casserole. It was MUCH better. I also left out the almonds because I don't like them.

I was intrigued by this recipe but leary of using a whole cup of mayonnaise, so I substituted light sour cream.  I also used a full pound of broccoli, 3/4 cup romano cheese instead of cheddar, half the butter for the cracker crumbs and and made a white sauce with milk, flour, salt, pepper, garlic powder and summer savory because I didn't have any cream of chicken soup. In spite of the changes, the gist of the recipe was the same.  It turned out great, my boyfriend loved it and went back for seconds!

My family loved this!  I used fresh broccoli on place of frozen.  That was the only change.  Love the crunch and taste the almonds add.

I used fresh broccoli, sour cream (instead of mayo), and cream of mushroom soup because those were what I had in the house.  In my opinion, this was far too cheesy and liquid.  I thought that it lacked substance.  I won't make this again, sorry.

I love the addition of the almonds!  I've been making this recipe for years, but I put a layer of steamed white rice down in the casserole dish first, then layer it with the chicken and broccoli mixture.  Yummy!!!

I have been making this for years -- as Chicken Divan Casserole.  I only use one can of the soup and 1/2 cup mayonnaise (and I have used the light mayo with no problem), and probably only 1 1/2 cup of cheddar -- Some mixed with the chicken and broccoli and some on top.  Instead of the crackers, etc, I use French Fried Onions.  I serve it with rice and it is great.  A lot of reviewers changed the mayo to sour cream -- I think that would give the recipe an entirely different taste -- try it with mayo, you'll love it.

This is almost my mom's recipe for Chicken Divan.  With that you add 1/2 t curry powder and 1 t lemon juice to the mayo/soup mixture.  Instead of crackers/almonds on top, sprinkle fresh bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese after tossing them with melted butter...delish.

this turned out pretty good, I reduced the fat though by using light cheese, low-fat/sodium soup and low-fat mayo (against the editor's recommendation) and it turned out great.  To add flavour because I reduced the sodium, I used a no sodium seasoning blend (herb & garlic blend), like I said, it turned out great!

One of my favorite ways of using the left over turkey and certain to be a winner after you carve the bird.  I have not used the crackers / butter topping but will try...for me the layer of cheese adds enough to the flavor mix.

This was a very easy dinner to prepare.  The mellow flavors will comfort any guest you may have over.  I shared this with my mom for her picky eater friends.  This will be made many more times in my home.  Thank you!

It was pretty good and defitnitely full of flavor. If I can recommend anything different it would be less cheese. The recipe ask for 2 cups and I used a little over 1 cup and I still felt like it was way too cheesy. My husband and kids were not too thrilled with it because they're not big fans of broccoli. I probably won't be making it again but I'm glad I tried it. And on a side note to the person who gave this recipe 1 star because it wasn't healthy and full of fat. Maybe you shouldn't make it if you don't think it's "healthy" enough. This website is for people who want to try new recipes not for people to judge and how many calories you'll stack on. Just saying...

Loved this.  I did season the chicken with garlic pepper, used fresh broccoli, sour cream instead of mayo and a Mexican cheese blend.  Easy and yummy!   Have now been adding water chestnuts and diced red pepper when I make this casserole.  Always get rave reviews.

we love casseroles and so when i read this recipe, i thought my family would love it and they surely did! the only thing i did differently was added a little garlic salt and pepper to the chicken before i poured on the soup mixture. we only had ritz crackers and it turned out awesome! especially over rice. the second time i made it, i didn't put on the garlic salt and pepper to the chicken and i felt it was just a little bland. but definitely still good.

Awesome! I followed some other notes on cutting the fat some, but you HAVE to use butter. I think any substitute will make it flat on flavor (probably why low-fat versions get low ratings). I substituted the mayo for fat free sour cream, the cheddar for reduced fat cheddar, and I used only 3 TBS of butter instead of the 4. I decided on fresh broccoli which I steamed for about 5 mins before I put it in the dish. Also, I sauteed about 4 small shallots in olive oil which I included in the broccoli layer.

Ok, so I made two versions of this dish side-by-side, one with fat-free sour cream and the other more or less according to the recipe. I cook for a friend's celiac daughters who could use a little meat on their bones, so the version that was made closest to the recipe was made gluten-free, substituting cream of chicken soup with a GF white sauce (made with butter, cornstarch, chicken bouillion, and heavy cream). For this version, everything else was according to the recipe with the one other substitution of GF cornflakes instead of the crackers.  Very yummy, I think the girls will really like this. 
The other version was for my family, and since my husband and I are watching our fat intake, I used fat-free sour cream instead of mayonnaise. Personally I prefered the taste of our's better than the girls' as I found theirs a bit too tangy from the mayonnaise, but obviously this is a matter of personal taste.
For ours, I also substituted white sauce for the cream of chicken soup (impossible to get in Spain), using skimmed milk instead of cream. 
The end result was delicious but as I had to prepare the sauce first, it wasn't such a quick recipe.
One other thing- does anyone else find it odd that the recipe calls for COOKED chicken, and then to cook it for nearly an hour??? I used fresh cubed chicken breasts, lightly floured it and sauteed it for about 3-4 minutes and then baked it in the casserole, in total, 40 minutes. Came out perfect.

This dish was wonderful. I will be taking it to holiday potlucks. Amandine is a French cullinary term used to describe almonds as a garnish. Keep everything original & you won't be disappointed.

For a twist I peeled and diced up some sweet potatoes and layered the bottom of the pan with them. Then I threw the broccoli(fresh not frozen) and chicken(used rotisserie) on top. I made my own cream of chicken so I was able to add additional spice to it such as onion, garlic, etc.. I dumped the soup on top of mix in the pan, sprinkled some paprika on it for additional flavor. I did not have crackers or almonds on hand so I skipped those, and just sprinkled bread crumbs on the top. I also skipped the mayonnaise. Turned out really really good, everyone ate it up. I used a bit too much cream of chicken, but it wasn't an issue. In fact I would do it again but make some dumplings and bake them in the dish as well... yum!

I thought this was delicious! I gave it only four stars because I listened to a lot of other reviewers and seasoned my chicken with poultry seasoning and onion powder and then used quite a bit of garlic powder in the soup mixture. I think it would have been quite bland without these extra seasonings. I also used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 freshly grated parmesan, which seemed to work well. I halved the recipe and baked in a 8x8 pan and used 1 can of soup and only about 1/8 cup sour cream. I'll definitely make this again. It would probably be good with cream of mushroom soup, too.

very bland and boring flavors; totally uninspiring. You could add spices to try to "up" the flavor of this dish, but I am rating it based on "as is."

I rated this lower not because it's a bad recipe, but because the Mayo taste made it yucky for us.  I think sour cream would have fit us better.  Other than that it was easy

This was a good recipe to add to the casserole stash.  I added a can of mushrooms and used french fried onions instead of almonds and butter crackers.

Great taste.  Pretty rich, but we finished it.  Did not change anything except we made half a recipe, forgot to precook the chicken and so left it in the oven a bit longer.

This was just fantastic! I used cheddar instead of parmesan, and mixed one cream of mushroom with one cream of chicken( because I like mushrooms) i used frozen broccoli florets because i couldnt find chopped the ritz/butter and almonds add great crunch! I seasoned my chicken the way i like it( with chili, garlic, and onion powder, italian seasoning, worchestersire, black and white pepper) It was devoured, completely! Thanks for the fantastic recipe, I will definitely make it again!

I made this recipe just the way it is so that I was fair on rating it. My husband loved it!! My daughter on the otherhand thought it was a little too creamy..But overall it was great tasting and easy to make for a busy family. I will definately make this again but a little less mayo and soup mixture to please my daughter. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this on a whim last night.  I used sour cream instead of mayo and Panko instead of crackers.  I also added hominy. I baked it covered for 35 min then uncovered with panko and cheese added for 15 more and might I say the dish was gulped down in record time.  My hubby went back for thirds!  It was a bit hit, even with the kids!

Really good. I made a couple minor alterations, such as fresh broccoli, onions, and extra cheese. I did, however, use sour cream instead of mayo, but only cuz I don't like it. Thanks for the recipe, I thought it was delicious!

I made this recipe for the first time tonight, and its a keeper for my house. The combination of cream of chicken soup, and mayonnaise gives the casserole a delicious flavor. The ritz cracker topping is another great addition to this casserole. I made rice and a salad to go along with it, and there are enough leftovers to have again tomorrow night.

Like others, I used sour cream and made a white sauce, and the dish was delicious. The most significant change I made was to sprinkle in curry powder as the butter and flour were cooking. That face the dish a slightly richer set of flavors but didn't make it (curry-style) hot. I supposed you could add more if you wanted that effect.

Everyone in my family enjoyed this.  2 cups of cheese is a bit too much.  I just covered the top of the casserole and that was plenty.  Don't leave off the almonds.  They add a nice crunch.

This meal is a great twist on one that I've made before.  Even my (very) picky husband said, "I have no suggestions at all," which happens about 1 out of 20 recipes.  Even my 3 sons who do not like casseroles or veggies loved this.  

I sub'd one can of cr. of celery for one of the cr. of chicken soups, green peas with pearl onions (yum) for the broccoli and used mayo with olive oil (because that was what was in my kitchen) and there were no problems.  I increased the cracker/ butter mix because I know my boys love it, and included the nuts in it.

Normally I would have mixed the chicken and veggies in with the soup/ mayo mix, so layering made for an interesting method that worked great.  All in all I decided that this is a very flexible recipe that can be tweaked to utilize items that are on hand... and it will be used in the future!  Yum.

Love this recipe! I have adjusted it a few different ways throughout the years. Use half mayo and half sour cream. I also use fresh broccoli; I chop  it and microwave with a small amount of water for about a minute before putting it in casserole. Delicious!

Too saucy. More chicken, less sauce makes it a lot better.

This sounded great on paper, but when i followed the directions it just didn't taste right. There was too much "sauce." The mayo and condensed soups were too much. maybe if you cut down on the amount it would work better....luck to anyone who attepmts.

I also made a few substitutions..I use sour cream instead of mayo., green beans instead of broccili and fried onions on top without the butter.  Great for lunch the next day.

This was delicious as written. Next time I may try substituting light sour cream for the mayo as others suggested. I will make this again.

yumm! i cut mayo in half and added 1/2 cup reduced fat sour cream and a little bit of milk to thin the cream sauce out. The only thing i would do differently is season the breadcrumbs or season the chicken more when I cook it. The cream of chicken soup was a little bland. I'll definitely be making this again!

I subbed in peas for brocolli, greek yogurt for mayo and french fried onions for crackers. Definitely keep the almonds as it adds a nice crunch. Recommend toasted bread and a glass of white wine for a nice meal.

Good, but very high in cholesterol and salt. Based on other reviews I used low fat sour cream, Healthy Choice Campbells soup and fresh broccoli. Two cans of soup is too much, reduce to consistency you like. Found this to be too soupy and I guess the butter crackers I used in combination with the cheese made it too salty, but I do not use alot of salt anyway. Good taste otherwise.

With all the positive reviews, I was looking forward to an extra yummy dinner.  I followed the recipe except I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise (I don't like cooking with mayo) and skipped the almonds (son doesn't like nuts).  What I got was a bland casserole, it was okay but definitively not great.

When I made this I used the frozen Broccoli and really wished I didn't.  I might have gotten a bad bag but I had mostly stems.  I also made a MAJOR mistake while preparing this for the oven, after reading the reviews I decided to use sour cream kind of option, BUT I mistakenly used 2 cups instead of 1.  It was still fantastic, I can't wait to make it the right way to see if it is any better.  But I will definitely use fresh broccoli next time.

This was tasty. I added some sauteed onions in which upped the flavor.  For the person who said it's 'almondine'......actually, 'amandine' is correct.  It derives from the French word for almond, 'amande'.

I would give this recipe 3 and half stars. I liked the recipe but the mayo was over powering. Next time I will use less mayo and more chicken. Or maybe I will use sour cream or just opt out of the mayo all together. Other wise it was great!!!

This was really good.   I was leary with 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and mayo but the end result is quite tasty.  I would definitely make again.

Been making this dish for years with a few changes.  use miracle whip mayo in place of reg. mayo, 1 can of cream of mushroom in place of 2nd can cream of chic and instead of crackers use cornflake crumbs.  line bottom of dish with broccoli then chicken, sprinkle cornflake crumbs on top, then cheese, then add soup/mayo mixture on top and sprinkle with a bit of cheese.  the miracle whip gives it a different flavor, i never use the stuff for anything else...

Just okay. We thought it was a little bland - not as good as some other chicken casserole's we've had.
