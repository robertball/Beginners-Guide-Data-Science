This is almost identical to what I make.  I read a review that the Italian dressing was overkill.  I would like to suggest that you allow people to add their own dressing.  We also serve the parmasean cheese on the side, because people like different amounts.  

We found that "Newman's Own" Oil and Vinegar is especially well liked by most people.  If you like it a bit spicier, try the salad seasoning you find in the herbs & spices section as well.  Also, we find that halved cherry tomatoes are prettier and often have more flavor than most tomatoes we get up north.  Also, you can try sliced black olives for color contrast & variety.  

It's really a great recipe though, both as suggested and with your own touches.  People have varied tastes and by letting them add their own seasoning, they can adjust amounts with ease.  You won't have the chance to "marinate," but for company, dieters, diet-restricted, and/or a husband like mine (who won't use dressing at all), it's essential!

I'm giving this perticular recipe only 4 stars not because it isn't delicious, but because I make it slightly differently.
First, I use whatever pasta we have a lot of... Right now the Family Fav is "Whole Wheat" pasta, incuding some spaghetti, broken up to look like "worms". (We have boys, any questions? LOL)
I use anything in the fridge that needs using; including- any fresh veggies, ham, bacon, pepperoni, cubed or shredded cheese (any cheese I use, I add at serving time, as it can become slimey). 
Olives in our house are a must: green or black & I use them whole (drained). Fresh onions & garlic: finely chopped & chushed, respectively, also.
I leave the whole salad rather dry, using only a small amount of olive oil & red or white wine vinegar, shaken together, to keep it moist. 
**The rest of the family adds whatever Italian-type dressing they want at serving time.
My preference  is "Good Seasons- Zesty Italian" dry salad dressing mix made with balsamic vinegar & olive oil. However, I've also used fat-free Italian dressing with good results, but keep in mind that "Fat-Free" dressing absorbs/dries out quickly and should be used at serving time. Add some crumbled Feta instead of- or with the Parm. (But then again; I've never met a Feta that I don't like...)  ;-)
Oh yeah- I serve the peppers on the side becaucse I hate the damned things.

Oh boy, definitely overkill on the italian dressing!! This is the kind of salad that you can add whatever makes your taste buds dance. I didn't use the bottled dressing, however, used balsamic vinegar and olive oil along with my own spices. I also added green and black olives, red and green peppers and herb feta cheese. Yum!

I took this to a pot luck over the weekend and it was a HUGE hit. I doubled the recipe and didn't have a bite left (approx 20 people). I didn't measure any ingredients, I just added veggies until it looked right. For the double recipe I only used one bottle of dressing. Two would've worked but it would've been much too oily for me. I'll be making this again at the request of the other guests!!

I tried this recipe because I wanted a tasty pasta salad that didn't have eggs & was easy to prepare.  It is great!  The only changes I made were: 2 bottles of Italian dressing???!!  I only used 3/4 cup of dressing and it seemed plenty and coated well.  I added a tad more Parmesan to taste and I thought it lacked pepper big time.  Other than that, this is a keeper!  I will post a picture of it shortly....enjoy!

Very yummy salad! Please do not use 2 whole bottles on this salad one is more then enough. I added cubes of provolone in this and both green and black olives. Gonna try pepperoni in this or salami the next time. Family said this was best Pasta salad they have ever had.

This was a hit at my group picnic!  I took the suggestion of some of the other reviewers and only used 1 bottle of Italian dressing.  I also chopped all the veggies fine because it was easier and I just like it better that way. It was very easy, tasted great, and looked good, too. =)

We had a bunch of people over for a big BBQ this weekend, so I kicked it up a lot.  We only used one bottle of dressing, and added Gorgonzola and Blue Cheese as well as Bacon Bits and some mushrooms.  It didn't last long!

We really enjoyed this. I made is exactly with the exception of using about 3/4 bottle of a lite italian/cheese dressing and adding sliced olives. Lots of chopping but worth it. Served with Sloppy Joes 2, made with ground turkey breast. Yummy! Lots of leftovers!

I've been making this salad for years with a few variations.  I only use 1 bottle fat free zesty italian (mid size bottle) then I add garlic powder, black pepper and some salad supreme seasoning to taste.  Without these seasonings it was a bit flat.  I tend to use the same veggies plus broccoli but is good with any variety of veggies.   I've made both with and without cheese and have also added pepperoni and olives, depending on who's coming to dinner.  A great hit at potlucks and cookouts (have had requests for it for summer wedding receptions also)  I usually make this with tri color spiral pasta but have also made it with spaghetti noodles broken in half....calling it spaghetti salad..generally I use peppers, celery, onion, tomatoes, olives and pepperoni with that version.  Add cheese just before serving or will get gunky.  I prefer cubed but have used shredded.  I make mine the night before, mixing a few times so flavors blend well, then mix well just before serving.  This salad has always been a great hit and I will make it for many years to come!

Not bad, but, as another reviewer said, this really is just Italian dressing on pasta.  I do like the veggies though.  I used pre-shredded carrots from a bag to save time.  I also felt that 2 entire bottles of Italian dressing was way, way too much!  I mixed all the other ingredients together first, then added the dressing slowly and kept tasting it until I felt it was just right.  The Parmesan is a nice touch.

This is a good basic recipe.  I did Good Season's Itialian dressing where you mix oil, vinegar, water and the italian season packet.  I put in sugar snap peas and frozen thawed peas.  Also, and this is a MUST, add fresh dill, fresh flat leaf parsley and 1-2 fresh basil leaves.  If you grow your own this works great!  I also added garlic salt, lots of fresh ground pepper and lemon juice (gives it a little zing).  I am asked to make this all the time for pot lucks or family gatherings.  If you are feeling especially generous add small fresh mozzarella balls.....people go nuts for them!  Hope this helps!  :)

This is basically the same pasta sald recipe i use.. i use tri color rotini, black olives, tomatoes, cukes, green peppers, pepperoni, sharp cheese, itailian dressing and my trick is adding the spice salad supreme to the salad let it set over night to absorb all the dressing.

This is a nice salad for spring/summer.  A chance to use those fresh veggies!  I added broccoli and various spices as suggested by other reviewers.  I used the Zesty Italian dressing and only 3/4 of a bottle.  I agree with one reviewer that more veggies should/could be added.  The next time I make it, I plan to leave the veggies chopped more coarsely, instead of diced.  Good recipe!

I have been making this for years and it is always a big hit at picnics, etc. I use McCormick's Salad Seasoning (I don't measure - just sprinkle to taste) and about 2/3 of a bottle of Italian salad dressing. YUM!!!

I use wheat pasta 1# box, adding all fresh veggies, carrots, celery, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, red onions, zucchini, black & green olives, cukes (optional) 8 oz package of cracker barrel cheese cut into chunks, 1/2 bottle lite cesar dressing 1/2 bottle lite italian dressing and about a half a bottle of McCormicks Salad Supreme (or to taste) this really makes it. This is the best, let me know what you think :-) Adding only 4 stars since mine is different and 2 bottles dressing is way to much.

A little heavy on the dressing, so next time I will only use 1 bottle. Otherwise it was great, and a big hit at our BBQ.

Kraft makes a Tuscan House Italian dressing.  It tastes SO much better than most.  It doesn't have that bitter aftertaste.

I used Romano cheese and bottled Italian salad dressing, adding enough dressing to season until I was leaving for get together and then added more, as it had all been soaked up by pasta, and carried in a large zip loc bag.  The cheese adds a salty flavor so be careful if you season.  I cut grape tomatoes in half and also added broccoli florets and black olives to other veggies.  Quick and easy.  Loved it.

This is a great pasta salad recipe.  We made it for our Labor Day cookout and everyone raved about it.  It is best to make it the night before and let it get cold in the fridge.  I omitted the tomato and cucumber and I used the Good Seasons Italian dressing powder.  I eyeballed the dressing until the pasta was well coated but not drenched.  Also, I some kosher salt and grated fresh parmesan cheese.

This salad was pretty good. I left out the celery and only used one bottle of dressing. Next time I am going to shred the carrots so they are blend with the salad better. It was even better the second day!

Super good!  I used barilla plus rotini pasta.  Instead of regular italian dressing, I used Good Seasons dry italian dressing, used olive oil and balsmic vinegar.  I also added some shredded carrots, and black olives.  SO YUMMY!

Great pasta salad! The only things I did different was omit the celery (kid's don't like and I did not have on hand) and for the bell pepper I used red, orange, yellow and green (there was a special last week at the store) and instead of fresh tomatoes I used a can of petite diced. The veggies I did have on hand I added more than the recipe called for but wonderful anyway. Oh .. and the dressing I had on hand and used was the Pesto Italian ... very tasty.

I also enjoyed this recipe because the ingredients are items I generally have sometimes with slight variations.

I'll be making this recipe often.

Wonderful! I also only needed one bottle of salad dressing. Two full bottles would have been way too much. If you're planning on having leftovers you may want to have an extra bottle on hand, because the pasta tends to soak up the dressing the longer it sits in the fridge, and you may want to re-moisten it a bit. The salad was fabulous, flexible (which I love), and a total hit with everyone at the party. Thanks!

I agree with Linda.  Two bottles of Italian dressing is too much.  Of course you can add more dressing if it is to sit over night, you like it spicy, etc. since it does soak into the pasta after sitting. 

I've made this salad often but a bit different in the past.  

I like the idea of the Parmesan cheese and will try it. 
Sometimes to give it protein I have used cut up small squares of a mild cheese. You could use a sharp cheese.  Cut up olives are good.  Tuna or cold Turkey left over sausage is also good. 

I used Ranch dressing mixed with Mayo but add it just prior to serving to keep it creamy.  Italian dressing may be mixed with Mayo also.  I've used both dressings with Mayo to give the dressing a bit of punch. Of course there is always the Mayo and vinegar standard dressing. 

I use frozen peas (thawed) and sometimes left over corn (thawed) .  instead of peppers I use Pimentos to add a bit of red color.  I used left over cold broccoli florets in the past. It has always been a salad which I've used for left overs, etc. 

This salad has a lot of variety of vegetables, cheese, dressing, left over cold sausage or meat, etc. one can add.   

it is a good change from the usual potato salad at a picnic.

Used only half the bottle of Newman's own family recipe Italian dressing because I found the entire bottle to be too much oil.  I omitted the celery because I'm not a huge fan, but added a bit of celery salt to incorporate the flavor.  Used colorful bell peppers and added garlic powder, celery salt, red pepper flakes (just a bit for some kick!), black pepper, and oregano.  This was a fresh and delicous salad and kept well in the cooler when we took it camping!  Huge hit, thank you for the recipe.

This recipe is so versitile.  I used cukes, green onion, tomato, green & red peppers, cauliflower, broccoli and black olives, along with a sprinkle of garlic powder, accent and italian season.  Another viewer was right tri-color pasta comes in a 12 oz box so I added 2 addtional cups. Lastly ONLY use 1 bottle of dressing.  GREAT RECIPE!

Good, flexible recipe.  2 bottles of Italian dressing would have been extreme overkill, so I used 1.  Next time I will probably add some olive oil to the mix.

I'm so glad I read reviews first.  One bottle of dressing is plenty.  I didn't measure the veggies, just dumped in whatever I chopped.  Sliced black olives would add nice color, I didn't have any but will use them next time.  I added shredded cheese instead of grated.  Great recipe for a quick pasta salad!

Very good. This is a great recipe for potlucks, cookouts, etc. because it appeals to most. I made a big batch of it for my fiance to take to work and the container came home completely empty. Only changes were to omit the onions, went a little easy on the dressing, and used halved grape tomatoes. Thanks!

Great recipe especially for a summertime picnic! I added sliced black olives, which were really tasty, although I couldnt imagine 2 full bottles of salad dressing. I used about three quarters of one bottle and it came out perfectly.

This was good, but I only added about 3/4 of a bottle of italian dressing...2 bottles would have been way too much.  I had leftovers the next day and added little chunks of ham and cheddar cheese to the salad...it was MUCH better that way.  It was quite delicious anyway, but the meat and cheese added some extra flavor that I really enjoyed.

My family loved it. But I recommend you use just one bottle of dressing. I prepared with Italian dressing and one without. Both were delish!!! Nice honest reviews from everyone. Thanks.

Great Garden Pasta!  We nearly skipped over dinner and just ate the garden pasta.  We didn't use as much dressing as the recipe calls for, only about half and it was great. Added black olives and pepperoni.

THANK YOU for this recipe as I lost mine a few years ago. I look forward to using this soon, but with the added peppers & very few olives.  It can be changed or anything to suit people's varying taste needs....VERY GOOD..

Excellent recipe. I use a small can of diced olives to sub for the carrots, and I use one 16-oz bottle of whatever olive oil-based salad dressing I have around. Two bottles would be WAY too much. Sometimes I throw in some spinach or I use gnocchi instead of spiral pasta. You can sub in pretty much whatever you like. The people I work with request it for our solstice and equinox parties every year!

This is a great recipe. It's now my husband's favorite side-salad. I was a little pressed on time, so I took a shortcut by putting all the vegetables in my Ninja and processing it for a second or two. The salad didn't look as pretty as it could, but it saved me a lot of time. I also only used about half a bottle of Italian dressing and thought it was great. Additionally, I kept the Parmesan cheese on the side so people could add as they wanted it. We had leftovers for a few days and I think it tasted the best on day 3. Thanks for the recipe, it was easy and a great summer salad.

4 stars but only with changes...This is a great idea for a salad, but for me there's too much pasta for the amount of veggies, and absolutely too much dressing.  I made it with about 3/4 the pasta and a little less than half a bottle of dressing... perfect for my taste!

I also added fresh broccoli but let it boil in the pasta for about 1 minute to soften. I've made simillar before and everyone loves it. Would also agree about the dressing. Add 1 bottle then add additional just before serving to taste.

Always good, always loved at our BBQ's or potlucks, and super easy to make.  I generally use grape or cherry tomatoes, instead of dicing tomatoes, so that it is easier to pick out for those non-tomato eaters.  and sometimes I add other fresh raw veggies, but always goes fast at the parties.

Awesome!! I cut this recipe in half since there's just 4 of us. Due to personal tastes I left out the celery and parmesan cheese. I used red onions for extra taste. To be different, I used orange peppers instead of green. To cut fat, I used fat free house italian dressing. I will be making this more often!

I have made a salad like this for years and it always disappears quickly.  I usually put cut up broccoli and cauliflower and carrots for the veggies and kidney beans for protein.  I use the Good Seasons dry dressing mix.  If you do have leftovers you will have to add more dressing to it because it will get soaked up by the pasta.   This is a quick and easy salad and nice to have something lighter as a side.

I have a similar recipe.  But I use less dressing, I also add broccoli and if i use bottle dressing I add some Italian seasoning.  And if no one is coming over who's allergic to shellfish I add shrimp. It always a hit.

Too much salad dressing, way too much, I try to try every recipe as written, and this was over powering with salad dressing. My biggest gripe is with measurements.

I really liked this recipe, however, as everyone else said, it is a little heavy on the dressing. I suggest a little ginger, maybe some garlic and a heavy handful of sunflower seeds. Or a TINY shot of hot sauce. Not to make it spicy so much as to bring out the flavor of the veggies. All around a GREAT recipe!

Nice and crunchy. Too much dressing, I cut it back. Why does the picture show black olives, but the recipe doesn't call for them? It has plenty of ingredients without them anyway!

I have never made pasta salad before and tried this, and it was pretty good, I used the cherry tomatoes, cut in half as one reviewer had suggested, and used Italian dressing by tasting how much was enough, added a few black olives, was very good, I will keep this recipe for making again, thanks so much for posting it.

Great pasta salad. I always add itty bitty pieces of pepperoni and cubes of provolone. Usually only use on bottle of dressing and it is plenty. I put out a second bottle for diners to add more if desired. Delicious!

I added green olives, grape tomatoes instead of the big ones, red and green peppers and shredded Parmesan cheese.  I brought this to the office and got loads of compliments and requests for the recipe.  We've been brainstorming on all the other things we could add as well.  Oh, and the 2 bottles of dressing?  Definately overkill, half a bottle at most.

A really, delicious and refreshing salad.  I did find it better with Italian salad dressing rather than "zesty" Italian salad dressing, which I used the first time I made it - it seems to be too vinegar-y with the zesty dressing.  I will make this salad regularly - every one in my family loves it.

Yummy and simple recipe, but 2 bottles of salad dressing is WAY too much!  I made this using the same amount of pasta and vegetables called for but with only about a cup of dressing and that was plenty.  32 ounces of italian dressing???? That's crazy!  The salad would have looked more like soup and I can't even imagine what it would have tasted like!

It is a great pasta salad especially if you love fresh veggies... but two bottles of dressing is definitely too much... I only added half a bottle and that was plenty... just put the bottle on the table and people who like more dressing can add more... also next to the bottle set a pepper shaker... pepper adds something fantastic to this pasta... ENJOY

I'm only giving this a 4 star because there was too much dressing. The second time I made it I made a few changes: first, I used only one bottle of dressing; second, I added a small can of sliced black olives and some mini pepperoni.

Pretty easy to make, and quick, if you're in a hurry. I prefer A Twist on Pasta Salad, from this site, which doesn't use bottled dressing, and is a lot healthier. Thanks!

This is very similar to my mother's pasta salad recipe that I love! As written, I give it four stars. With a few minor adjustments it's a five star recipe. Two bottles of dressing is overkill. You definitely only need one. I also omit the carrots, celery, and bell peppers. I substitute swiss cheese for parmesan cheese and add chopped pieces of pepperoni, hard salami and one can of sliced black olives. This is a good recipe for baby showers and other parties.

Great recipe.  I made a lot of changes, but it's a good recipe that can be customized easily.  I only used one bottle of dressing after reading other reviews, and it was plenty.  I used fat free Italian and added more right before serving because it dried up a little.  For vegetables, I used carrots, cucumbers, green peppers, and red peppers.  Everyone loved it!  I'll definitely make it again, maybe switch up some of the ingredients next time.

I really enjoyed this.  I left out the celery and onions (personal preference), used one extra large tomato (instead of 2) and one small cucumber, and grated the carrots.  Also, I only used maybe 1/2 c. dressing and just served the rest of the dressing on the side.

Amazing!  Omitted the celery, added black olives and blanched broccoli.  Made it this weekend to share with friends, they kept the leftovers, so I had to make it again 2 days later.  Delicious!  Be sure to use Newman's Own Olive Oil & Vinegar dressing and wait until the pasta has cooled.  YUM!  Tasted great fresh and great 2 days later.

DO NOT USE BOTH BOTTLES OF DRESSING! I used half the amount and even that was a bit too much!  I added some sliced black olives and next time will add about a third of the dressing.  I ended up draining the pasta salad to get rid of all of the extra dressing, after that, it was delicious!

I hate to give this 3 stars, but if you really use TWO 16 oz bottles of italian dressing, half your salad will be floating in it. That's why I love this website so much because the reviews give you a heads up not to add a second one. Also, I was kinda surprised that black olives were not included in the ingredients. They're kind of is a must for a tri color pasta salad.

This was a great pasta salad. I had doubled the recipe for our BBQ. It was a great addition to our feast that we had. We had only a little bit left over for the next day. I did add a little bit more veggies---different color peppers.

WARNING DO NOT USE THE INDICATED AMOUNT OF DRESSING! I know that it had to be a miss print, just use as much as suits your tastes. This recipe is a variation of a typical pasta salad. I love pasta salad b/c it is so versatile. I have made this version and prefer mine without celery and carrots. Try roast red bell pepper, basil, green, calamata, or black olives, tomatoes, green onion, feta,  parmesan, ham,roast beef, pepperoni, genoa salami or pepperoncini the possiblities are really endless.  One tip for making left over pasta salad great is to drizzle with additonal dressing and mix up before plateing b/c the pasta tends to soak up the dressing over time and can dry out.

Love the veggies and you can chop them fine enough that the kids won't squawk but needs a little something....next time I would definitely follow some of the other reviews and add chunks of cheese, salami, olives, etc. USE LESS DRESSING! I used about 3/4 of a 16 oz bottle and that was really a bit too much.

Great recipe, very versatile. You can add just about any veggie. Way too much dressing though, I doubled the recipe and only used 1 16oz bottle for the double recipe and it was great.

I used this one as a starting off point for my own variation. What I added was: pasta, carrots, black olives, green olives (with pimentos), grape tomatoes (left whole), red pepper diced, parmesan cheese and newman's own italian dressing. everyone enjoyed it, and it was a great side dish for tailgating!

This is one of the best pasta salad recipes. I think what makes the difference is the fresh Parmesan cheese. I agreed with the other reviewers and chose to use less dressing. Everyone loves it.

This was a huge hit at our house.  I used whole wheat pasta, which had a different, less "slippery" texture than regular - we all like it better.  I followed another suggestion and used Paul Newman's Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing.  I made the salad ahead of time and added a bit more dressing just before serving to get the right consistency for the salad.

My modifications:  I only used 1 cup of italian dressing - 2 bottles is far too much.  I used white flour rotini - it was all I had on hand.  I omitted the onion (my preference).  I added 1/2 cup each frozen corn kernels and frozen peas, 1/2 cup of sliced black olives, and 1 cup of broccoli florets.  The olives really improve the taste.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was very good. I made it for the 4th of July and everyone loved it. I grabbed a bottle of Newmans Balsamic vinegar dressing and it was delicious.

I cut the salad dressing in half and used fat-free Italian...still tasted great.  Brought it to work and everyone raved about it.  Great light summer salad

This is great basic info.  For those that love broccoli but not the raw flavor, I learned that if you put it in the bottom of the colander, then pour the cooked pasta and water over it, the veggies come out perfect.  I run cold water over all, throw it in the bowl and put the rest in.  I really like it with slivered pepperoni and mini-cubes of cheese, lots of extra herbs, and a tight-fitting lid to rotate the flow of dressing as it's absorbed.

I really enjoyed this but I only used 1 bottle of dressing and I think that was plenty. Next time I might even cut back on the dressing a little more.  I loved all the vegetables and I added a thin slices of kubasa instead of the cheese because my daughter is lactose inteolerant.   Would definitely make this recipe again as it is so good, colorful and easy to make.

Good basic platform for creativity.  One bottle would be way more than enough unless you like your pasta swimming in dressing. Add some chopped fresh parsley and basil,chopped summer squash, olives, steamed broccoli, etc. I make it with tortellini-and that's yummy too.

I love this.  I usually make half at a time for myself using macaroni pasta.  I don't always have carrots on hand and I usually substitute red bell pepper (high in Vit. C) and use much less dressing.  My point is-this recipe is such a forgiving recipe.  It always turns out great.  Thanks for taking the time to share.

It was pretty good, but i think the dressing i used wasn't quite perfect. Next time I'll use the dry mix like others have. I omitted celery and didn't use nearly as much dressing. A little rice vinegar was a small addition for the veggies to soak in before adding them to the pasta.

I love this recipe! However, I used only 1 bottle of Italian dressing because 2 was too much for me (and it reduced the sodium and calorie content) and I also substituted broccoli for the cucumber and bell pepper and it came out great! My family and I love this pasta salad.

We thought this was just okay.  We brought it to a Super Bowl party and it didn't go over that well.  A nice, basic pasta salad, but there are so many more interesting pasta salads out there that I wouldn't make this one again.  It also seemed like a ridiculous amount of salad dressing.  If I am going to eat that much oil and fat, I might as well have something really good (like a dessert)!  On the plus side, it is very quick and easy to assemble and most of the ingredients we had on hand.

I was thrilled to find this recipe the other day when I was in last-minute panic mode for a pasta salad.  As a salad dressing lover, I do have to agree that two bottles of dressing would be WAY too much.  I used one, and thought it was more than enough.  The salad would be literally swimming in more than one 16 ounce bottle (and I even added extra vegetables).  Thanks to L. Gale for posting the recipe.  :-)

So good! Used only 1 bottle of Italian salad dressing. I think that the key flavoring came from the dressing, which was a special mix from trader joes. Also doubled parm cheese. Everyone at the BBQ raved about this recipe

Two bottles of salad dressing? Geez ... I'm giving it four stars and not five because I think if you actually added two bottles of dressing, your salad would be swimming ... but the salad itself was a great combo ... thanks!

I'm a novice cook but I still found this easy to make.  I only used 1 bottle of dressing as suggested by other reviews, I also skipped the carrots and cheese.

I added cubed cheddar and mozerella cheese. I also added 3 tbsp of supreme salad seasoning. I also cut the italian dressing down to one bottle. It was great!

Excellent salad!  I used whole wheat rotini. We had a serving before adding the parmesan and actually liked it better without, so will leave that out next time. This recipe goes into my favorites file.

This is delicious!!! I used more veges than it called for, and actually leaving out the green pepper cause I don't personally like that one raw. I added mushrooms, olives and chickpeas as well to the mix. I also added cheddar cheese chunks  and really only used 1/2 of one bottle of dressing. It is so good and I have a feeling it will be even better tomorrow! :)

It's good!  I've made similar versions for many years.  You can't mess it up - unless you use too much dressing.  I usually only put 1/2 the bottle on when making and add the other 1/2 just before serving, as the pasta tends to absorb the dressing and it will seem too dry.

I made this salad for about 50 women at a sorority party--about 6 boxes of rotini pasta. I added an crumbly herb feta cheese, crumbly gorgonzola cheese, and I only used 4 1/2 bottles of dressing total for the whole batch. I also used half fat free and half regular Italian dressing. It was gone in minutes!! They loved it!!

I hate to give this recipe a 1, but I feel betrayed by the Allrecipes rating system.  This is a disaster if you actually follow the recipe.  WAY too much dressing.  I should have read the other reviews.  A good use of summer vegetables otherwise.

Made this for the first time for the office year end potluck. 
The taste was so good, we ate it cold and also warm (just heat it in the microwave). And , i used Brocolli instead of Celery.  Tasted so yummy and so healthy!

I made this for a womens prayer meeting, everyone loved it. I did forget to add the shredded carrots :( I'm sure that would have added some flavor. But over all it was awesome take it from someone whom had never tried any kind of dressing.

I didn't have any Italian dressing, so I used Cardini's Caesar salad dressing and left out the parmesan, since it's in the dressing already.  It turned out really great. Salad had lots of flavor and a nice crunch.

I agree - just use one bottle of dressing.  But, otherwise it was tasty and an easy recipe to make ahead of time or to transport to a picnic.

Great recipe!  Used penne rigata pasta and Kraft Sun Dried Tomato dressing as that is what I had on hand.  Like the majority of other reviewers I used significantly less dressing and was very happy with the results (1/2 to 3/4 of a 16 oz bottle).  Also used a variety of vegetables as I thought this would be a great recipe to clean out the veggie drawer/use up the garden veggies, (several varieties of tomato, broccali, carrots, celery, cucumber,even adding a small amount of lettuce.)  Family loved it.  Will definitely make again perhaps using some other dressings recommended by other reviewers.

I took the advice of other members who rated this and cut the dressing in half. It was a very delicious pasta salad, and easy to make in a hurry.

I cut the dressing in half, doubled up on the vegetables, and switched the tomatoes and onion for peas, broccoli, and chopped snow peas. With those changes, it turned out extremely well. Big hit at work

I took this to a barbeque and it was a hit, even with people that ordinarily do not like vegetables like celery.
I added some pimentos from a jar as well and slices grape tomatoes in half. It looked great.

I used Newman's Own Light italian dressing, about 3/4 of the bottle.

I made it another time with normal zesty italian dressing from a different brand. It was too oily for me. The type of dressing is important.

This is great.  I used 1 bottle of the Italian dressing to 12 OZ of pasta and used some fresh cilantro (just a little bit) instead of cucumber b.c. that's what I had.  Yummy!

This was great and everyone loved it!!  Be careful when buying the tri-color pasta many of the packages are only 12 oz and the recipe calls for 16 oz!  Like many of the reviews suggested, I also only used one bottle of zesty italian salad dressing and it turned out great!

I used halved cherry tomatoes, and unpeeled, thinly sliced cucumber, along with a can of drained and rinsed sliced black olives, and ONLY ONE bottle of zesty Italian dressing.  This came out YUMMY!  A hit at a potluck BBQ! I will definately make this again!

I think most people must be extremely generous when it comes to the rating system of this web site.  I agree with the first reviewer, if you love bottled salad dressing over pasta this is the recipe for you. On a positive note, it is a colorful salad and cheaper than the grocery store version.  PS I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding more parmeson cheese in the vain attempt to liven it up.

I had already been doing something like this already. The difference is I used red bell pepper as well as green. I chop up a fair amount of spinach in mine. I shred my carrots, but don't use celery or cucumbers(thinking of trying them both next time). I mix Zesty Italian and Creamy Ceasar for it. No parmesan.

Excellent and one of the best I have tried! Also, being in high altitude, making it just exactly as the recipe was, it didn't sink in the middle! I was very pleased and will make this every time!

The ingredients were fine but there was way too much sauce.  I made this recipe for a summer garden party and no one ate it.

Very nice for summer time! I didn't use near as much Italian Dressing though....only 1 bottle is all that's needed.

Delicious and super easy - I skipped the onion and added black olives.  We added the dressing at the table, so each person could add the amount they wanted.

Great for cleaning out the fridge.

Super yummy!  I made it basically as it is written, but added a lot less salad dressing.  I also added some chopped parsley.  Lovely!

I have a great tip if you have picky eaters- Such a great, HEALTHY recipe (I had 100% whole wheat spiral noodles on hand).  I made the salad as described, but I didn't have any Italian dressing- so I made my own concoction- and made some for my kids who didn't like mine.  "Mature tastebuds" dressing: 1/2 c. olive oil 1/8 c. red wine vinegar 1/8 c. garlic rice vinegar 2 TBS olive oil mayo (okay, heaping TBS :) 1/2 tsp. salt 1/2 tsp. pepper 1/2 tsp. onion powder sprinkle of Italian seasoning (optional, I could have done without this part) 1 tsp+ of garlic powder  Shake it, stir it, dish up your bowl and add 2-3 large spoon full of your dressing and mix around.  Kid Friendly dressing: 1/4 c. olive oil mayo 1 TBS mustard 1 TBS pickle juice  Or whatever your picky eaters like. My kids loved this and it has so many cancer fighters/preventers in it.

This was a huge hit! I served this at an event I was catering. I used tricolor tortellini instead to make it a more filling salad. I omitted the celery, I didn't think it texture would go with the other ingredients. I added sliced olives and opted for halved grape tomatoes. I also used less dressing as others suggested. Delicious! People came back for third and fourth helpings.

This recipe is wonderful! I made it last year for a volleyball tournament, and everyone loved it. It is so flavorful and filling, but not too heavy (which was good for the team because we had to go play). I am making it again for another volleyball tournament, and I'll be doubling the recipe for the 15 of us that are going to be there. I found that adding sliced black olives, feta cheese, and sliced up peperoni was good. Like other reviewers, I only use 1 bottle of dressing per batch, so I'll use 2 when I double it. I'm sure this will be a hit the second time around too!

Very good, probably really a 4.5 for me.  Not a 5 because it needed a higher vegetable to pasta ratio - even though I think I nearly doubled all of the veg, but this is easy to fix!  Makes a pretty big batch.

This is good, but instead of 2 bottles of Italian dressing, do half italian and half ranch. Also I add zucchini, cherry tomoates, cucmbers, pablano peppers and cheese. Assiago is great with pasta.

I followed this recipe to a "T". I have made many versions of this in the past, however, this recipe was perfect. We went wine tasting and took this and another AR recipe (broccoli quiche) both were excellent and carried well. Thanks.

The reason for the 4 stars is due to the fact that it calls for so much dressing. As many have said, 2 bottles is overkill. I actually only used 3/4 of a bottle and allowed guest to add more to fit their tastes. I added red peppers, and corn and it was lovely. With those adjustments, I loved this recipe.

Made it with red oninons, black olives, broccoli, and grape tomatoes and I only used one bottle of dressing and that seemed to be enough. I made it for a bbq and it was all gone. My father-in-law said he went back for 3rds and everyone seemed to enjoy it.

Used bowtie pasta instead of corkscrew, so the two bottles of dressing made it very soup-like.

I just finished making this and used only 3/4 bottle of dressing. But I also find something is missing, maybe it is pepper. Think I will toss in some more parm. It is a keeper though. Thanks L.Gale

I need a great pasta salad for a party I'm hosting in 2 weeks and with all the great reviews, I thought I found it. This recipe needs something. Not sure what. I followed it to a T, and took a few other suggestions from other reviewers and although we ate it, it was not what I expected from all the great reviews. I guess I will continue to look.

I love pasta salad but I didn't love this one.  I used maybe 1/2 the recommended amount of dressing.  This was more than enough oil but not enough flavor.  I added some turkey pepperoni and that made it better.

Yum! I tweaked this just a bit. I used grape tomatoes, instead of chopped (keeps the soggy factor down), and used one bottle of dressing (Newman's own, olive and vinegar). Every one RAVED about it!

This is the recipe I make, but I also adjust a little.  I add broccoli cooked crisp, and tiny fresh mozzarella balls called "pearl" size.  Then I put Ken's raspberry walnut vinaigrette dressing on it and it's out of this world delicious.

I agree with the other comments,way to much dressing,one bottle of your favorite dressing is more than enough.It will soak it up the longer it in the fridge,i actually liked it better the next day.Its a good base recipe.

I have been making a variation of this for years, after being served something similar in a restaurant. If I'm in a hurry, I'll add a box of frozen mixed vegetables (green peas, corn, diced carrots & lima beans) that have been thawed. I also like a lot of grated sharp cheddar cheese (sometimes Gouda too!) and always add chopped scallions. I like a garlicky homemade vinagrette - takes 3 minutes with a mini food processor - just mince a clove of garlic, add vinegar & Grey Poupon mustard, salt & pepper and after mixing that, slowly drizzle in your olive oil.  Fresh dressing makes the salad "pop"! You don't need much - why pile on claories? I just use a little. In summer I make a lot of this pasta salad, because it keeps well in the fridge and is great to have on hand and serve on a hot day with a green salad.

I estimated on all amounts, and added the dressing only a little at a time until it was the amount I liked. I also added cubed motz cheese.

I have prepared this staple and it is always well received but I use canned chopped tomatoes not fresh.Follow the directions in the recipe,substituting 1 large can of chopped tom's for fresh; do not add dressing. Allow the pasta salad to stand overnight (or about 4 hours) in the 'fridge to absorb flavours and moisture from the canned tom's.  An hour before serving,add bottled dressing,tasting as you pour and stir(as some commercial dressing is saltier and thcker than others I add a touch of fresh lemon juice to the contents). Add Parmesan or Romano cheese, stir and serve.

This was pretty tasty. I made a TON for a party I had. I agree with others on using grape or cherry tomatoes and halving them. I also made three times what this recipe was for and only used one bottle of Italian dressing. It needed a little more- so I added oil and red wine vinegar to taste instead of another bottle of dressing. It was great!

This was easy and tasty.  I made as directed, except forgot the onions and parmesan - oops.  I also only used 1/2 the called for amount for dressing.  1/2 the dressing is the right amount, as others have indicated.  I made the recipe one hour in advance and when we ate it, it had a great taste (wasn't too overwhelming with the dressing).  

I had purposely made extra so we had leftovers and enjoyed it the next day as well.  27 hours later, the veggies were still crunchy and the pasta was still the appropriate texture, so you can definitely make it in advance, but you will need to refresh it with more dressing because the next day the dressing flavor was much less discernible.

This recipe is the best!  The only thing I do like to add some shredded cooked chicken, broccoli and olives to the salad.  Add some crusty bread and you have a light summer meal that is filling and very flavorful!

Excellent recipe--my fiance and I enjoyed it very much. Tasty, colorful, and healthy.  The only thing I did differently was to use a red pepper instead of green, and broccoli in place of the celery.  For the dressing, I used only one 16 oz. bottle of Lite Italian dressing, added about 1/2 c. of mayo in a separate bowl, and whisked the two til well-blended, and added to the salad.  It made for a slightly creamier dressing. I only give this 4 stars because while it's a very good base recipe for a veggie pasta salad, it didn't "wow" me-- there are no herbs/spices in the ingredients list. Still, very good--will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe!  I use a larger amount of dressing when I add broccoli or cauliflower because they seem to really soak it up.  Nice staple to have for a crowd.  Another interesting option is to add a little dried mint leaves--adds a fresh taste.  Thanks for sharing!

I am a special ed teacher and we made this for one of our weekly cooking lessons.  Everyone, including the students, loved it!  We didn't follow the recipe exactly, adding more veggies than it called for and we ended up using only about 1/2 a bottle of dressing.

Great salad, we really enjoyed this.  About three quarters of a bottle of salad dressing is more than enough, two full bottles would have been overwhelming.  I used fresh Asiago cheese instead of Parmesan.  I added nsome sliced fresh mushrooms and next time I'll add some sliced black olives as well.

Very tasty and very colorful! Easy to make - didn't take very long even with chopping all of the veggies.  I used minced red onion (appx 1/4 cup) and only used one carrot very thinly sliced.  Be sure you cut back on the amount of dressing - I used approximately 3/4 of a 12 oz bottle of Girard's Old Venice Italian, and that was plenty.  My family really enjoyed this, and leftovers tasted even better the next day!

Excellent Pasta Salad!  This is so fresh and light, it's excellent for summer. I didn't have any leftovers which I was sad about so I am making extra again next weekend for more company. I used Good Seasons Italian Dressing packets. A new summer staple.

My sister in law made this salad, it was so delicious that I had to make it myself- it was yummy and so easy. Everyone raved about it! Try red onions for extra color!

We used Whole Foods Italian Dressing and also chose to halve grape tomatoes.
This was very popular. Only thing I'd do different is add more veggies.

This is a good pasta salad.  I also cut the slad dressing to one bottle and it was plenty.  I used Paul Newmans Oil & Vinegar.  I skipped the bell peppers, used shredded carrotts and cherry tomatoes quartered.  I also added a bag of Kraft Itaian cheese crumbles (mozzerella, assagio, ect).

I added a red pepper (for the color) and was very flexible with the amount of vegetables -- added the amount I wanted, until I liked the consistnecy and mix. Following the recommendation of others, I only used 1 bottle of salad dressing -- 2 would have been way too much.  I took this to a party, and got many compliments.  Will make again.

This is a great basic pasta salad and you can make it 100 different ways.  I used a balsamic dressing and much less than called for.  Also I added some red peppers and some broccoli.  Yummy and I will make it again!

A great, versatile pasta dish. I added chicken and cut the dressing in half. I made it the night before and served it to my lunch group the next day. It help up well overnight. I also kept out the tomatoes and served this with a caprese salad. Great! Thank you!

I made this pasta for an Easter Dinner Saturday and an Easter Brunch Sunday using Easter shaped pasta(enough for both). It does need a whole bottle of Italian dressing which absorbs well overnight. I left out the onions and substituted a red bell pepper for green. Also, I'd recommend adding pepper for flavor.  Everyone loved this pasta.  Its very colorful and tastes great!

I thought this recipe was very good, use some caution in selecting your dressing, as it will be the main factor in the taste of the salad.  I chose one that turned out to be less than exciting, i countered that by adding some balsamic vinegar and some fresh ground black peppercorns, and some mushrooms for garnish, as well as black olives.  This all combined with the origional recipe to provide a great dish that was a big hit at the party.

Try this recipe with creamy italian dressing!!  Even better!  Also, like red, orange or yellow pepper better, they are not as harsh tasting as the green pepper.

This is a favorite at our summer, family gatherings. I prefer to omit the bell pepper (and usually the cheese) and everyone still likes it. One bottle of Italian dressing is plenty, although if there are leftovers my sister-in-law likes to add some additional dressing when she serves them. If you prefer to use fat-free dressing it is still very good the first day but is not very good as leftovers. I love this recipe and love its versatility!

A great summer recipe.  I used almost all of one small bottle of balsamic dressing and almost all of one small bottle of Italian dressing, but I like my pasta salad wet.  I added a bit more parmesan cheese, and substituted green pepper for red.  It went really fast at the barbeque I brought it to, and people couldn't stop raving about it.  It was a pretty presentation, light, and very easy to make.  This one's a keeper.  Thanks!

I add black olives, cubed provolone and pepperoni to this recipe.  I also only use 1 bottle of dressing.  I have another bottle on hand, as sometimes the salad can get dry when sitting out at a bbq or the leftovers the next day(the rare times that there is any leftover that is).

this was fantastic.  I took this to a family bbq and everyone loved it.  I used the veggies I had on hand instead of what was in the receipe.  I used a can of italian tomatoes, fresh mushrooms, cucumber, and fresh basil and I topped it with shredded mild cheddar cheese and used sundried-parmesan dressing it was great.  Will make again and again.

FANTASTIC! Didn't change a thing and everyone was raving about it.  I chilled over night though I actually didn't have room in my fridge so I put it on the patio in the snow. It froze and made me nervous but I think it made it so it wasn't soggy for Thanksgiving dinner. Thank you so much for your recipe!

Good recipe. Too much dressing is called for. Double the recipe and cut the dressing by half and its about perfect. Add some olives and you've got yourself a salad full of compliments.

Good recipe as a starting point, but you can definitely get away with only purchasing one bottle of salad dressing and then tasting it as you add small amounts. Even one bottle could be too much for some.

decent, I used three packages of italian dressing with only two packets worth of oil and vinegar for the dressing.  We still had to add garlic powder, oregano, cayenne, salt, and much more vinegar to get the flavor right.

Yummy!  You really only need 1 bottle of Italian dressing.  I add sliced olives and pepperoni for something extra.  Also, I use red onion for the 1/4 cup chopped onion.  My family loves this one, even my 2 year old.

Very yummy, fresh pasta salad! I halved the recipe and omitted green pepper and onion and ony added about 1/4 a bottle of Italian Dressing (which is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 - had I used the full amount of dressing it would have been SWIMMING in it!) I loved this! Super easy to throw together and so tasty and simple!

Great salad - I cut the Italian dressing in half, as well, and added blue cheese crumbles, provolone cheese chunks and bacon bits which all added a ton of flavor!! YUM!!  (I also left out the onions, but that's just a personal preference)

I DOUBLED this recipe and only used 2 bottles of dressing and I think THAT was a bit too much.  Also, I forgot the carrots so it did not have that crunch.  I did not add celery as the whole family hates the stuff(LOL) but added extra cucumber.  Other than the too much dressing part, the flavor was AWESOME and I will use this recipe again.

This is a great pasta salad, but too much salad dressing for my taste. I didn't measure, but probably used only 1/3 cup of dressing, I omitted the tomatoes and added some corn.

Easy and nutritious but I made it even healthier:  Use whole wheat pasta instead of enriched pasta, skip the grated cheese, use light salad dressing and two whole bottles is NOT necessary.  I used approx. 20-24 ounces and the salad is still moist and delicious.  Also, don't be afraid to up the veggies.  I used a whole sweet onion, and almost double the amount of all other vegetables.

This recipe is a big time saver! Although it did take a little bit to prep, the work was worth it. I made about 2 pounds of this pasta salad last weekend and it turned out perfect. It was nice to be able to get one of the sides ready before the holiday weekend. The next time I make this I will be adding more vegetables, also I did serve the dressing and Parmesan cheese on the side as other reviewers suggested.

The basics of this salad are excellent. My version is quite different though. I agree with everyone else, 2 bottles of dressing is overkill. I use one bottle (12 oz) of italian dressing. My family actually loves creamy italian on this one. I also cube up dry salami. Another difference is like to steam my vegetables and them chill them. Slightly cooked but still crispy they compliment the rotini quite well. Whatever is in my crisper at the time. Some of my family's favorites are brocolli (trees, a must), cauliflower, zucchini, and asparagus. I've actually never put raw vegetables in mine preferring them to be slightly cooked. It also helps the body absorb the nutrients better in my personal opinion. And I cube mozzerella cheese into it. Makes for a very italian fare. I have quadrupled this recipe for potlucks and still not had any leftover!!!

A bit too much dressing for my tastes... I only used 24 oz and still found it "drenched." But after letting it settle for an hour or two it wasn't quite as bad... I would just use much less dressing.

Great recipe!!! REALLY easy.  My husband and daughter loved it, and I'm sure our guests at the lake tomorrow will too.  I used the Zesty Italian dressing, and only 1 bottle.  I also used cherry tomatoes and sliced those- thought the presentation was prettier.  Next time I will add some black olives for contrast.

I'm only giving this four stars since it indicates to use italian dressing. I followed another reviewers suggestion to use Newman's Own Olive Oil and Vinegar then season with Salad Seasoning. Other reviewers also suggested using less salad dressing and letting people pour more themselves. Great tip!!! I used half a bottle and sat it out if people wanted more. I made this last night and its all gone. I also sliced some peperonni on top. Delicious!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe. It's a keeper.

Mushrooms are a must have for me along with garlic(minced) red peppers,olives, and artichoke hearts.  Try making it with 3 cheese tortellini as your pasta and the bowl will barely make it to the dinner table!  I use "Cheese Fantastico" salad dressing which is like a kicked up version of Italian.

Way to much dressing! I have been making this for years and I love to add chunks of pepper jack cheese and some sort of meat. Pepperoni is usually a huge hit.

I think this is a great pasta salad. Definitely way too much dressing though! When I make it I only use one bottle of dressing (instead of the two) and it's still plenty. Makes a good amount; great for bringing to a picnic or just making for leftovers for lunch.

This was a great recipe, but I often end up adding too, so for me it was a basic.  I used only one bottle of zesty italian low fat dressing.  I also added green onion, 1 can rinsed and drained black beans, 3/4 c frozen corn, raw broccoli, zucchini instead of cucumber, small grape tomatoes instead of regular, red bellpepper, black olives and would have added frozen peas if I had them.  I like mostly veggies in a pasta salad! :)
I also added S&P, garlic powder and one elephant garlic cloves as well as some cayenne pepper.  This is where I went just a tad overboard!  So then I had to add some sour cream and shredded cheddar to tone down the cayenne, next time I'll go lighter on that stuff! :)  Took it to a 25 yr anniv and everyone loved it!

Refreshing!  We used about 3/4 of one bottle of dressing as the other reviewers suggested (thanks!). We also left out the tomato and celery and added a little more grated cheese.  It was a hit at the BBQ.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The best pasta salad our family has eaten! DH doesn't usually care for any type of pasta salads, but he LOVED this one! The only thing I changed, was using just ONE bottle of Italian dressing. You can always add more at the time of serving. And, personally, we all felt that the one 16 oz. bottle was just fine! Very good! Thanks for sharing!

Great basic pasta salad recipe. Like most others I used much less dressing. I had leftovers for days (it's just my hubby and I) and I added some dressingtoeach bowl to freshen it up. The pasta absorbed the dressing as it sat (but I used a lot less than called for).**Updated- my husband has asked me to make this several times. He loves it.

Way too much dressing, when i tried it with less dressing, it was bland.  Onions were very strong, i suggest rinsing them before adding.

This is a no fail potluck recipe. You seriously can't really mess this up as long as the pasta is cooked right and you can add virtually any vegetables you have on hand.

I made this to go along with pulled pork sandwiches that I made for sunday dinner.  This recipe is sooo easy and turned out really great.  I used good seasons italian dressing (the kind that you have to mix yourself) and I only used one bottle's worth and I thought it was moist enough.  I think 2 bottles would be a bit overpowering.  I also added shredded carrot, chopped tomato, and chopped cucumber.  I didn't have a green pepper or I would have added that as well.  I forgot to add shredded parm cheese..that would have made it taste even better, I'm sure.  I did, however, add some sesame seed, celery seed, paprika, and salt and pepper.  This really is a nice, light pasta salad that works well as a side dish and is soo easy to make.

Use a italian dressing that you really like, or that is very flavorful because thats where most the seasoning comes from. My husband really liked the salad.

Delicious!  However, I don't know how anyone could use 2 bottles of dressing.  One was plenty.  I also grated some asiago on top.

Pretty good salad. I used different vegetables from what the recipe called for, and varied the amounts. My salad dressing was not good quality and it probably would have been a lot tastier if I had better dressing. I also added in some pepper which was tasty. I think feta cheese would be good too, so I might throw some of that in.

Didn't have bell pepper or cucumbers so subbed sliced zucchini instead.  Also added fresh grape tomatoes out of our garden.  Only added one bottle of salad dressing and it was plenty for us.  Could have probably done with less.  Really good though.  I like all the fresh veggies in it.  Will try it with bell pepper and cukes next time.

This salad was quite easy to make and is tasty. It definitely does not need 2 bottles of italian dressing. I did do 1/2 fat free with 1/2 regular italian dressing to lighten it a bit. Colorful too.

This was ok.  I used Barilla Plus Rotini and added additional veggies (broccoli, sugar snap peas, etc.)  I also used cherry tomatoes which I halved and reduced the amount of salad dressing to 1.5 bottles.  I actually prefer my own pasta salad of tossing the pasta/veggies with garlic and extra virgin olive oil and parmesan cheese.  It is much lighter and healthier.......

Very good!  I made this for my lunches that I bring to work and the veggie combination was great.  I added a bit less onion because I don't like when it overpowers...and way less dressing.  I bet it's probably tastier with more dressing, but hey - this is healthy!

I used a mix of macaroni so that the veggies would stand out...great presentation.  This tasts better the the "day after" as it can really absorb the Italian dressing flavors.  I prefer a stronger dressing and about 3/4 of the bottle rather than the whole bottle (it's easier to add a little more than drain it!).

I increased the ingredient amounts and made this to bring to a birthday party that had 40 guests.  There were many compliments on it.  I made it the night before and saved some of the dressing to add the morning of-because the pasta tends to soak up a lot of it overnight.  I added black olives and celery and substituted red bell pepper for the green.  I also shredded/grated the carrot instead of slicing it.  It was very good.  There was none left by the end of the day.

Yum! This was great to take along on our picnic.  My husband, not a big fan of pasta salad, went back for seconds.  Even better the next day but since I didn't add all of the dressing called for per other reviews, it was a little dry by then.  Overall, a GREAT version of pasta salad.

I loved this recipe. I've made it twice now and both times it's been great. I made my own Italian dressing from the package (only made one package) and used what noodles I had on hand. I also used a red and yellow pepper instead of the green. Wonderful recipe!

My husband hates pasta with a passion and he gobbled this up like he hasn't eaten for days!  I'd give it 10 stars if it was available.  I did omit the cheese cuz we're not cheese fans & I added only 3/4 bottle of dressing.  Other than that, AWESOME!!!

I used regular fusili instead of tri-colored pasta, because I find the tri-colored pasta, cooks faster and gets too mushy.  I also made a double recipe - but still used 2 bottles of dressing instead of what should have been four, there was plenty to absorb - and it lasted forever...which was great because I didn't have to cook dinner for 2-3 days, just salad.  I substituted yellow pepper instead of green.

We absolutely loved this recipe. Will definitely make again, I will be bring it to a bridal shower in a couple of weeks.

This was a great pasta salad. The family loved it and have asked me to bring it again. I did have to add a little more pasta to soak up the dressing and I uses a Italian cheese blend that made it excelent.

This recipe calls for way too much Italian dressing!  I added one 16-oz bottle and it was too much.  I ended up adding about 10 more ounces of pasta, more veggies, and some ranch dressing to tame the tangy Italian dressing.  Otherwise, it was good.

Very easy and delicious! I usually make pasta salad from a box, but this was SO much better. I took it to a potluck and got many compliments. I followed others' advice and used only 1 bottle of salad dressing and it was plenty. I also used red onion, which had great flavor. The only time-consuming part of making this was chopping up all the veggies, but it was definitely worth it to have something so fresh and delicious!!

Really good-especially if it sits for a while in the fridge and has time for the flavors to blend.

this was great! I omitted the tomatoes, my husband can't eat tomatoes. no one likes celery here so I used celery flakes instead. I decided to use olive oil and vinegar instead of the italian dressing. great as a cookout side dish!

I would suggest cutting down on the salad dressing. The amount originally listed is way too much. Otherwise nice simple salad.

It turned out well. Big hit at the family dinner. I made a few adjustments based on recommendations  I found here.  First, I only used one bottle of dressing. And it was plenty. I made mine with tortellini, just a personal preference.  I also added fresh basil and Italian parsley. And topped it off with cubes of cheese. I only gave this 3 stars because of all the tweaking of the recipe.

Our taste has our version with only 12ozs of dressing and double the veggies.  If made precisely by the recipe, mind the amount of dressing. add it in gradually to taste - way too much in my opinion in the recipe.  12-16oz is more than enough.

This is a perfect summer dish! I tweaked the recipe a tad with great success. My box of pasta was only 12 oz but I kept the amounts of everything else the same and enjoyed the higher veggie to pasta ratio. I only had a half bottle of dressing and it was plenty! Even if I have more on hand in the future, I’ll use less than one bottle. I also swapped black olives for the celery based on preference. The beauty of pasta salad is how easily you can customize!

Good recipe and easy to toss together! From experience, 2 bottles of dressing are too much even when using regular pasta. Recipe is very flexible to add as much dressing as you like or add other veggies too. If making the day before, add less dressing initially (8oz), toss salad, add more dressing just before serving, toss again. I lightly sautéed some frozen broccoli and let cool before adding to the pasta; used 1 yellow bell pepper and 1 cucumber (small). Made this GLUTEN FREE (GF) by using GF Fusilli pasta (Aldi “live Gfree” brand) and Walden Farms Italian dressin. GF Pasta Tip: Bring water in large pot to a boil with 1 tbsp salt; add pasta to the water along with 1 tbsp olive oil; set your timer for 2 minutes before recommended cook time. Stir frequently the first few minutes of cooking.  When pasta is al dente (taste test your GF pasta and adjust cook time by 1 minute only—quick to overcook and bad if really under cooked), strain and rinse pasta in colander with cold water. Transfer to a bowl and toss pasta with a couple swigs olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and leave out at room temp. Then, prep your veggies and add to bowl with 4 oz. dressing; toss salad, cover bowl and place in fridge to chill. To serve, add 8 oz dressing, toss salad. LEFTOVERS (GF ONLY): Reheat slightly (about 45 sec. total, toss pasta half-way through reheat time) and add additional dressing. Leftover cold GF pasta will absorb too much and get pretty dry. So, adjust portion size accordingly to se

Pretty good recipe. I find that the amount of dressing it asks for is about double what I prefer, so I cut it back significantly. Still tastes good.

Left out the parmesan cheese and olives, and cut 2 bottles of dressing to 1. I also use a red or orange bell pepper instead of a green. Great vegan option with lots of compliments!

Easy recipe to follow and quick to make.  The grocery store didn't have tri-coloured pasta, so I used Rotini instead.  I added mushrooms, broccoli, ham and feta cheese. I cooked the ham and veggies, with the exception of the cucumber and tomatoes, just slightly so they were soft but still crunchy.  I also used creamy poppy seed dressing instead of Italian.  Kids loved it!  Great summer time meal.  Will definitely make this again and again.

Great recipe! This has the best combination of veggies out of any pasta salad I've ever tried.  I added more veggies than what it called for and it still turned out great. Like many of the reviews said, you only need 1 16oz dressing.

Called for waaay too much Italian dressing. I cut it down to 1 bottle, and even that seemed like it was excessive. Seems like it lacked something to make it stand out. Added shredded cheese to amp it up a bit.

I heated oil in a skillet with minced garlic (don't let the garlic brown).  Added and sautéed carrots, red bell peppers and zucchini squash, so they are slightly tender (lessen the crunch to be more in line with the soft pasta).  I then mix together the veggies, pasta and Paul Newmans, and then refrigerate for a couple hours so the flavors can mesh.  ***garlic is a must***

i followed the other reviewers' advice and went easy on the Italian Dressing(used a fat free version)but found the salad to be just a touch bland. Added some zest with sliced black olives and cubed mozzarella. This recipe can be adapted well to suit different tastes. next time will try it with a creamy dressing.

Delicious salad that got raves when I served it for company at a barbeque.  I took the recommendations to use less dressing, adding 1/2 the amount called for and then a few splashes more later once the original amount had soaked in.  We will be having this again and again.

So easy!  I used a little balsamic dressing, then some regular italian dressing.  Realized at the last minute I didn't have time to chill, so added leftover mixed veggies and cheese and served it warm.  YUM!

I did not use  bottle dressing, but my own.  I also substituted a variety of vegetables.  This was a hit!  Thank you.

I used whole wheat pasta sprials & only 1 bottle 16oz of low-fat Italian, and there was more than enough dressing. I left out the pepper because I didn't have one, and used some broccoli in it's place.

Great dish. I gave it only 4 stars b/c it wasn't necessarily phenomenal. I used only about 1/3 a bottle of dressing and it was PLENTY. I also skipped the onions and celery b/c I have kids.

We loved this recipe!  My husband ate three bowls of it!  We did not add any onion, and used LOTS less italian dressing, but it was good!

Disappointed with this pasta salad. Used red pepper and 1 bottle of dressing, but still not very good. Took it to a fam reunion and someone brought another pasta salad and everyone ate that one instead.

Yummy!  Made it for Easter with bunny and egg shaped pasta - the chunky shapes held up well to the veggies.  I wanted to use red instead of green bell pepper and forgot to pick up either, but the salad didn't miss it.  I also used Gerard's Olde Italian dressing (less than one bottle) - perfect!

I would disagree that this is more than just pasta with dressing. Yeah the ingredients are just the combination of the two but if you are looking for a easy pasta salad, this is eat. To cater to personal tastes, we added black olives and only used 3/4 a bottle of salad dressing. Will use again, though i will try with a red onion next time.

This is an easy, delicious way to use fresh garden vegetables.  My husband and daughters especially liked it.  It tastes so good on these hot summer days.

This was an awesome salad for a hot summer day.  I added black olives and a little three cheese ranch dressing because I was short on Italian. It turned out fantasticly and all my guests loved it.

Definitely use only one bottle of dressing, and I agree with an earlier reviewer that you can add and delete what suits your tastes to make this work for you. We did the recipe as it is except only one bottle and no onions. Black olives would be good as well! Delicious!

Good Pasta Salad. I added chunks of Muenster cheese and some sopressada. One bottle of salad dressing was more than enough. This recipe called for a fair amount of prep work.

Very fresh and summary taste. The only alteration I made was I added 2 table spoons of red wine vinegar and added only ~1 1/2 cup of italian dressing instead of 2 bottles. It was perfect!
