Really yummy!!  I used brown sugar in place of Splenda. I personally think 1 hour is too long in the oven, mine was done in 40mins and it was perfect.  My five year old devoured it! and I loved it as well  Definately will be making again soon!

This was delicious. I was a little worried, because I didn't have ginger, and only had white vinegar, but it came out beautifully. I cut the thighs into bite-sized pieces and just rolled them around in the sauce pan before popping them in the oven, which cut the cook time by 10 minutes.

This was absolutely wonderful - it was exactly the flavor I was hoping for!  I used low-sodium soy sauce and two big cloves of garlic as my only changes to cater to our personal tastes.  Soooooo good!  Will definitely be made many more times.

This is an excellent recipe! I am originally from Hawaii and have had my share of teriyaki dishes and this one rates up there. I made this last night and it came out wonderful. Only changes I made was I used La Choy regular soy sauce ( I am a salt nut what can i say) and used brown sugar instead of sugar substiute. Other than that, I kept to the recipe. Served with white rice and some egg rolls, yummmm!!!!

Very yummy!  Very easy too!  My husband and I are on a lower carb diet and the Spenda was a nice touch.  I used 1/2 regular Spenda and 1/2 Brown Sugar Splenda.  We inhaled our meal.  Also...this would be an AWESOME wing sauce!

Wow! I cook a lot and this baked chicken recipe is a keeper for repeats often!  I had all the ingredients on hand, used brown sugar instead of Splenda as others suggested, baked for 45 min.at 425 deg.  I cut the recipe ingredients in half except for the garlic, only had four chicken pieces. I covered the baking pan with Release* foil so no clean up problem.

All I can say is YUM! This was really good. My picky son made a comment when it was cooking, "hope it taste's better than it smells" cause he could smell the vinegar. He loved it! All he ever says is "its okay" when I ask how the meal was...this time he said it was really good. I made this exactly as the recipe is written, no changes, no substitutions.

Excellent recipe!  As it was a 103 degrees today, I elected to grill the thighs vs heating the oven.  I was apprehensive as the recipe clearly states to bake the dish but it turned out wonderful and the smokey flavor from the coals only enhanced the dish.  Used brown sugar in place of the Splenda (didn't have any) and low sodium soy sauce.  Served with basmati rice cooked in chicken broth and an Asian Salad from this site.  Family loved it!!!

I made this recipe using boneless chicken thighs and substituted brown sugar for the Splenda.  Everyone loved it.  No leftovers!  A big thumbs up.

Replaced the artificial sweetener (yuck!) with sugar and it was the most delicious thing I've made in a long time.  I used pre minced garlic, used wine vinegar because it was all I had, and only had some dried ginger.
It was fabulous, and I loved that the teriyaki sauce was homemade without all the chemicals that pre made gives!

This is awesome. My husband and six year old son loved it. I didn't have cider vinegar, used white instead, and I don't use artificial sweeteners, used brown sugar in place of Splenda.  The first time I used skinless thighs, and it was very good. The second time I used chicken drumsticks (with skin), reduced the soy sauce because even with the low sodium variety I found it salty, and added a bit of maple syrup. The second time was MUCH better! I wonder if I could freeze some chicken with this mixture on it, all ready to cook when I defrost it? Well I'm going to find out!

YUMMY.  I substited brown sugar and use d fresh grated ginger and 2 cloves garlic. Instead of brushing on I poured a little on top every 10  min and then rolled chicken in it and then after 3 times I just poured remaining sauce in and let it cook. Sauce came out great and kids put it on their rice. My daughter is the pickiest eater ever and I expected  her to pass on this. She took one bite and her eyes popped out and she gave a thumbs up. This recipe is a keeper!

I have tried this recipe twice now. The first time I prepared it as written. The second time I changed it up a bit based on recommendations.  Both times I would rate it 5 stars! For the modifications, first, I used pineapple juice and brown sugar instead of vinegar and splenda and made 1.5 times the sauce.  I used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and marinaded the chicken in a ziploc bag for 3 hours.  Then I baked the chicken at 400 degrees for 45 minutes basting and turning every 10 minutes.  Also, I would highly recommend lining the baking pan with aluminum foil otherwise, clean up would be difficult. My extremely pick 4 year old exclaimed, "Mom!  This is DELICIOUS!"

This was good, though extremely salty.  I used boneless chicken breasts and made with long grain brown rice.  I doubled the sauce to use in the rice and it just came out overbearingly salty.  I tried to cut it by adding extra Splenda but I didn't want it to come out too sweet.  It was great on the chicken, but not so much on the rice.  I also halved the sugar to half Splenda and half brown sugar, and added a quartered onion to the sauce.  It was good; I will definitely make again, I'll just make sure to use a lower sodium soy sauce next time.

Wonderful recipe. My husband asks for it every week, and the leftovers are great as well. No need to cook sauce first. Just omit the water and cornstarch, combine the rest of the ingredients, and pour half of the sauce over the chicken. Baste with the remaining sauce during the cooking time.

This chicken was so fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly except I bake the chicken for 15 minutes longer because my family likes chicken thighs a little drier. The cold leftover chicken is great made into a chicken salad. This will become a monthly dinner staple.

This was excellent!  I used brown sugar in place of the sweetner (only b/c im pregnant and aspartames a no no) and that was the only change.  This is super flavorful and definitely a keeper!!!

Excellent recipe. I was worried about cooking the meat for the full hour. It was so flavorful, tender and looked as good as it smelled. 5 stars for sure.

This is great and fast to prepare. I followed the recipe with one exception. I added 1/4 cup of dark rum simply because I like the taste of rum with baked chicken, delicious. I also tried it without the rum, not as tasteful as with the rum. Thanks for sharing.

I use this recipe over and over and my family cannot get enough.  I use some recommended changes and it is a five star recipe with the following changes.  1/2 C Brown Sugar instead of Splenda, 1/4 C Orange Juice instead of vinegar, add 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper, 2 cloves of garlic.  Pour sauce over chicken thighs and let sit for an hour.  Bake it in the oven with the sauce on it, uncovered.  400 degrees for 35 minutes. Serve over sticky rice with a spoonful of the sauce and your favorite vegetable.  Delicious!

This is a family favorite I make almost once a week.  It is a real kid-pleaser!  I however, prefer to make with 1/2 brown sugar rather than Splenda.  I also like to remove the skin before baking.  I like to serve with white rice and scoop some of the marinade over the rice.  Sometimes I even double the sauce.  It's good on pork  in the crock pot too.

I used a whole fryer cut into 10 pcs (breast into 4pc) and left the skin on. 

Replaced Spelda w/brown sugar & vinegar w/ pineapple juice
I marinated the chicken (1-2 hrs)in the UNCOOKED sauce.

Baked in UNGREASED casserole dish for approx 45 minutes, after 5 minutes I reduced the temperature to 375, basting 2 or 3 times over the cooking process. 
This was easy & excellent!

Next time I will try brining the Chicken 1st and grill on the bbq.
Photo to follow.

Happy Eats! 

Notes: If you cook your sauce (no need to) completely cool/chill your sauce b4 marinating your chicken

Great recipe! I made a few changes. I added more garlic and ginger than called for (because I love both) and a teaspoon of toasted sesame oil. I also used brown sugar in place of Splenda. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of thighs, and baked them for about 40 minutes, brushing on sauce as recommended. I used half of the sauce on the chicken and added the other half to some stir-fried veggies and brown rice, then topped the dish with toasted sesame seeds. Delicious! I will definitely make this sauce again, and will likely use it on other things.

This was great & very easy to prepare.  Made sauce exactly as written... had BONELESS, skinless thighs... so I wound up reducing the cook time a little... The sauce thickened up a little too much on the stove, but once spread on the chicken, it thinned out.  I goofed & didn't baste every 10 min, so I didn't get a nice saucy "crust" that I might have been able to achieve... I will remember to do that next time.  But the flavor was awesome....and so tender...thighs were a good choice for that...and de-boned/no skin.... the visible fat was VERY well trimmed.  Just 1 piece leftover & most importantly... NO COMPLAINTS from ANYONE!!  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good overall. I doubled the sauce and had a lot extra to pour over rice and noodles. I set aside the extra sauce for the meal. Made broccoli stir fried in soy sauce as a side.

This recipe is a keeper! I used white sugar instead of SPLENDA and cooked it differently (skin side down, covered for 1/2 hour, flip and cover for 1/2 hour, flip and uncover for 20-30 minutes, basting a few times). It came out so tender and the sauce gave it such a nice flavor. Thanks for sharing!

One of the best chicken dishes I've made so far. Added a little hot sesame oil for a kick. Used the left over sauce (after doubling) on broccoli with toasted almond slices. A repeat of this recipe in the very near future.

I used pre-bought teriyaki sause to save time. It was awesome!  I also used chicken breast instead of chicken thighs.  Mine cooked in 30 minutes; not an hour as the recipe suggested.

We just loved this recipe as a starter, but My husband Bob changed it somewhat. He says that the other reviews said something about ending up with a crunchy crust from brushing the sauce over the chicken pieces while they cooked, but he went a step further and (like another review said) doubled the sauce in order to marinate the chicken for a couple of hours before cooking.He poured half the sauce over the pieces in a slightly smaller casarole dish and put it in the 'fridge. He sloshed the thighs around so some got in each. Then while making the sauce, he added some honey and changed the Splenda for brown sugar(again from another suggestion in a review).Then before cooking, he changed the casarole to a bigger one to separate the pieces more and allow for more crunchy crust on each. Then while cooking, He decided that turning the pieces over in their overly abundant juices would defeat the purpose and disolve the crustyness already built up, so he poured out of most of the juices in the casarole after they had cooked for 30 minutes and didn't turn them over. He also didn't use the sauce that the pieces marinated in to avoid cross-contaminating the chicken and only used the remaining half of the sauce for basting. That was probably not too important since it cooks in such a hot oven, but better safe than sorry.It probably cut down on the saltiness also, as we didn't notice it.We used the sauce over rice. FANTASTIC!!

I made this yesterday to bring to a school Christmas/Pot Luck dinner. It was delicious and one of the first dishes to go! I was concerned about the 1 hour cooking time, but it was spot-on. The chicken came out moist and juicy. The marinade/glaze was perfect. I cut the chicken thighs into smaller pieces since it was a buffet dinner, and that seemed to be a perfect portion. If you are looking for a quick and delish dish to bring to a pot luck, this is a great choice (especially if you can score the chicken on-sale like I did!).

Just made this and it came out great!  The only change I made was I threw in a big scoop of some sweet marmalade jelly that I had in the fridge.  I also couldn't find any ginger so I omitted it, but it still came wonderful.  The sauce thickened up quickly and coated the chicken very well.

Super easy and super yummy!!!  I used red wine vinegar and brown sugar instead because that's what I had.....I also used boneless/skinless thighs instead of the drumsticks....very moist and tender!My family loved it.  Served it with steamed brown rice.

I have made this both in the oven and on the stove (our power went out and the stove top was all I had left for finishing the meal). Both turned out great. We use extra garlic and skip the corn starch. It's a wonderful meal. My boyfriend is so very picky and he RAVES over this meal. This one will be in our rotation for years to come. Thanks for sharing!

I used only 8 chicken thighs and I think if I had 12 there wouldn't be enough sauce. I let mine marinade over night and it turned out really well, used a fried rice off this site as well. It was requested again in the house.

I used chicken legs instead of thighs (kids like eating them more) and white sugar instead of splenda for no artificial sweetners.  I also doubled the sauce and used half of it as a marinade.  Very easy preparation for a great taste!  Everyone from the eighteen-month-old to the adults loved it!

MMMM. This was very flavorful. I omitted the cornstarch and water. Used half white and half brown sugar. The sauce never thickened but it still basted chicken well. I baked at 350 for 50 minutes on foil lined cookie sheet. No mess. Served with Oven Brown Rice from this site and it was awesome. Thanks for sharing!

This was great. I made the sauce the night before then marinated chicken and had my husband grill it. I also made a mistake and m is measured the vinegar, it was super easy to fix though. Both kids liked the chicken as well, husband requested that i make again. Only change i made was to use reg brown sugar not splenda. Will make again.

Very good. I'm glad I used non-stick foil to line the pan, it was nice & sticky when done. I subbed brown sugar for the splenda.

Great recipe, but definitely leave out the Splenda (yuck!) unless its necessary for your diet. I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar in place, added an extra garlic clove and tsp of ginger. Also added about a half tsp of crushed red pepper. Delish.

This recipe zoomed right to the top of my 10 best foods list.  The Hub and I had this along with the Pineapple Fried Rice II recipe on this site.  Hit a homerun with this one.  The Hub remarked at least 3 times how good it was.  I made double the sauce so he could put it over his rice.  I prefer mine without the extra sauce

This has such a good teriyaki flavor.  Can't think that I've ever tasted better in any oriental restaurant. I will be using it on the grilled foods this summer.   I did use brown sugar as suggested by other members after discovering I was all out of Splenda. Also knocked 15 minutes off the baking time.

I too, covered a baking sheet with aluminum foil and sprayed it with pan release.  Worked like a charm.  No getting out the chisel and jackhammer, just washed with detergent and water to remove some fat that leaked through.  I have to confess I left the chicken and sauce overnight in the pan to set up.  This morning I just picked up both ends of the foil and dropped the whole thing in the trash can.  Might not work so well for those of you in warm states.  I live in Wisconsin.

Thank you DeeStLou.  it's a great recipe and you can bet I'll be making it often.

This was great!  I did not use Splenda but used brown sugar as a substitute.  I made sauce, cooled, then added to a zip lock bag with chicken and left it in the frig for a few hours.  Baked for 40 minutes.  Make SURE to line your baking dish with heavy duty foil sprayed with oil - makes clean-up a breeze!  Will definitely make this again.  Leftovers are great for a chicken caesar salad the next day.

I used brown sugar instead of the splenda (don't trust anything artifical).  This is the bomb!  I used less brown sugar than what it called for with the splenda!  So easy and perfect and delicious!  Also, I dunked each thigh, and then proceeded to pour the rest of the teriyaki sauce over it and baked it that way.  Turned over halfway thru the cooking time.  We loved it!

This was very good! The only changes I made were as follows: brown sugar instead of Splenda, fresh ginger instead of powdered, teriyaki sauce (the brand that starts with a K) instead of soy and I added a splash of sesame oil.These changes were due to personal preference. I often sub teriyaki for soy in recipes and I always use fresh ginger as I prefer the taste of it to the powdered. A great tip for keeping fresh ginger indefinitely: Peel a knob of ginger and either slice it into coins or manageable chunks then place in a jar filled with vodka so that the ginger is completely covered.This will keep in the refrigerator a very long time. Any vodka will do (I use the cheap stuff) since it won't affect the flavor of the ginger, it only acts to preserve it. Over time, the ginger will flavor the vodka and you can also use it to flavor marinades or sauces.

This is a great recipe. I follow it exactly with one exception, I bake the thighs 10 minutes on each side (total of 20 minutes) this cooks off fat and excess liquid which thins the sauce. I then drain off the excess liquid brush with sauce and finish with 20 minutes on each side. Teriyaki perfection!

This was a fantastic homemade teriyaki recipe. I followed as is and it turned out perfect. The only comment I have is that an hour was way too long to bake the chicken. 40 minutes was perfect and the chicken was perfectly moist. Will use this recipe again and again!

We really enjoyed this chicken dish, and fairly low fat and healthy.  However, I did substitute brown sugar (1/3 cup for full recipe) for splenda.  I made half a recipe and it was done in about 40-45 minutes.  MAKE SURE YOU LINE YOUR PAN WITH FOIL AS THE SAUCE BURNS ON YOUR DISH.  2 days soaking to clean.  But sauce was very yummy.

I especially like this Teriyaki Chicken dish! The sauce is fantastic, and I made absolutely no changes to the ingredients. I only adjusted the cooking time the second time I made it. I cooked it in a glass dish for 22 minutes per side (while basting every 11 minutes). A full 60 minutes of cooking time (the first time I made this), the chicken was a bit dry. Great job, and thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!    - Gary

This didn't taste very good to me.  It had a very harsh, almost bitter taste.  My stepkids (ages 6 and 8) didn't like it either.  My husband liked it though.  I used chicken breasts instead of thighs and brown sugar instead of Splenda.  

Here's a tip.  Save yourself a TON of work and put foil in the pan!  I was cleaning and soaking the pan for 2 days afterward.  That sauce would not come off!

This got an A+ from my husband; definitely a keeper!  I did make one change, but it was more of a cooking method change than an ingredient change (although I did use brown sugar instead of Splenda, since I don't buy artificial sugar).  I doubled the sauce, used skinless/boneless thighs, and cooked this in the slow-cooker (on high), for about 4 hours.  For the last hour or so, I took the cover off so the sauce would thicken more, but that could probably be accomplished by slightly increasing the cornstarch.  Served the chicken and sauce over brown rice.

Excellent!

A little tangier than I associate with Teriyaki (probably due to the amount of vinegar), but delicious all the same. I used organic chicken drumsticks and thighs and served as 'finger food'

Second time around, I made double the amount of liquid and used half as a marinade (without the corn-flour) overnight. The other half I used to baste the meat while cooking. The left-over marinade was then boiled up (with the corn-flour) and used as a dipping sauce.

Wish I had taken a picture as it looked great too!

Great recipe - authentic teriyaki flavor from a dead easy technique. I'm not a Splenda fan so used a cup of regular white sugar which worked out fine. Thought the cooking time was a little much so baked mine at 350 for 40 minutes and the chicken was well cooked. Even my incredibly fussy 13 year old loved it. I agree this a bit of a salty recipe but I confess I heart salt. This is a definite addition to my repeat recipes.

We really enjoyed this. I used brown sugar in place of the splenda. I cooked mine for 40 minutes and basted it with sauce every 10 and flipped them over half way through cooking. Turned out great. When I first made the sauce I thought it was going to be too salty but once it cooked it was fine. Will make again!

Similar to something I have made myself for years.  I used wings and boiled them in the sauce for a bit first then put them into the oven to crisp up.

This was a hit! I did change it a bit though: I used a few squirts of honey b/c I had no ginger, I used brown sugar, I added dried chopped onion. If you are a saucy person like I am, after you have made your sauce leave a little on the side to throw on the chicken after it's done so that you aren't cross contaminating. I also found that the cooking time was a bit too long...I say stick with the 40min as stated above but check chicken with a thermometer to make sure you aren't over cooking. I think next time I may use the sauce as a marinade and then cook as stated! Will be making this one again for sure!!!

Awesome! My son (with juice dripping down his chin) said 'Mom, this chicken is FINE'.  I accidently used ground cloves instead of ground ginger. I didn't catch my error until the second time I made this dish. Because I got such wonderful praise the first time around, I didn't correct my error.

This chicken was absolutely delicious. I didn't have any ginger, and it was still amazing. The only thing was that my chicken came out very very dry. I would decrease either the heat or the cook time to get juicier chicken.

This is really good.  I really didn't think it would turn out this good.  The sauce burns pretty bad in the oven.  The pan is going to be really fun to clean!  The chicken is seasoned just right.  I didn't use splenda, I used brown sugar.   I didn't have the cider vinegar so I used white.   I also only cooked for 45 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Yummy recipe, but difficult to clean baking pan afterwards.  Perhaps that is because I use real sugar rather than splenda.

Because Splenda changes chemically when it is heated, I refuse to use it.  I doubled the recipe using a combination of regular and brown sugar, poured it over the chicken and baked it, turning the chicken a couple of times.  Low calorie isn't worth putting poison into your body.

I've made this several times and before I made it the first time, I read some of the suggestions and decided to use pineapple juice and brown sugar. I put it all together and marinated it for a couple hours in the fridge then put everything in a baking dish, turning it over after 30 minutes and baking an additional 30 minutes. I served it over a frozen brown rice/veggie mixture and drizzled some of the juice over it. It's one of our favorite things!!

Great teriyaki recipe. I did add another 1/2 T of cornstarch to the sauce.  It was not thick enough to brush on as the recipe said. With the extra 1/2 T of cornstarch it thickened and stayed on the chicken as it cooked. I will make this again

Ill admit that the sauce was delicious, but unfortunately almost none of the sauce ended up on the chicken by the time I took it out of the oven. No, the sauce wasn't watery. Also, the sauce burned while on the wings. Not sure what went wrong there :/. Next time I will change the recipe by putting the sauce on the wings AFTER they've cooked. (Tip: use brown sugar instead of splendor)

This sauce was amazing. I used brown sugar instead of splenda and it was very good. I wanted to make teriyaki chicken and fried rice so I cubed my chicken and coated with flour and fried them in vegetable oil until browned. I put them in an 8x8 pan and poured this sauce on them and baked them on low until the sauce caramelized and served with fried rice. It was wonderful. My husband was impressed =). Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Super tasty! Per other reviews I did half Splenda and half brown sugar, but will omit the Splenda completely next time as I didn't care for the aftertaste. Only other thing I'd change is the cooking time as I used boneless skinless thighs and I think they were a little bit overlooked. My family loved it and this will definitely go into the recipe rotation!

Great! Next time I'll try cooking for 45 minutes instead of 60. Also liked the idea of using brown sugar.  I had to use regular sugar, no Splenda here. The sauce was AWESOME. I used boneless, skinless breasts.

Super easy recipe! To not have to bake it as long, I like to cut breast in half, then cut it in half down the middle along the skinny side. I poured the sauce over all and basted a couple of times. For a  yummy light dinner cut up the cooked saucy chicken, put over cooked rice, mix around and add to salad and toss. So good.

I paired it with a vegetable pasta salad. I am not too fond of sweeteners so I used brown sugar instead. It did make it a bit darker but very delicious nonetheless. Thanks for this recipe, definitely one of my faves.

I just made this today I used pineapple juice instead of the vinegar I also used splenda blend brown sugar instead of the regular splenda I used chicken legs I made the sauce but omited the cornstarch & used half to marinate the chicken legs.  Then I used the other half & added the cornstarch & cooked on the stove to thicken up & used as a baste while I grilled on the bbq...It was really really good.

It was easy and tasted great! I just added the sauce to the dish and stuck it all in the oven. Basting it worked just fine. May add some green onions to give it a little more oomph next time.

This was really good. I made a double recipe for a large pack of thighs. I cooked at 425 for 10 min turned basted and coocked for 10 more. I poured off excess juice and basted returned to oven turned off and closed for 10 more or so.

Such an easy recipe, yet tastes like you had to put effort into it.  Took others advice and marinated it about sn hour or so before baking - did not bother cooking the sauce.  Baked about 45 minutes and turned pieces over halfway through.  Chicken was amazingly tender.  Definite keeper - hardly any leftovers left.  Added a bit of maple syrup - in looking over the recipe now I actually forgot to add the 1/2 cup "sweetener" (was going to use the brown sugar alternative), and it was still good.  Will try to remember to use it next time.  Also highly recommend lining the cooking pan with foil, otherwise clean-up will be the hardest part of following this recipe.

So delicious!! Best teriyaki chicken I've ever had. I only make three simple changes - I use brown sugar in place of the Splenda, I use two large cloves of garlic and I bake it for about 45 minutes instead of an hour and it's done to perfection. I serve it with either brown rice or fried rice and either broccoli or green beans. Yum, yum, yum!!

I made the sauce as written, but halved the chicken. There was enough sauce to spoon over rice. I think the reason it takes an hour to bake is because of opening the oven every ten minutes to baste. I don't have the time for that. The end result was good...flavorful and juicy chicken. We loved it!!

I really liked the way this turned out. I was afraid of it because it smelled very vinegary, but that dissipated in the baking. I did change the Splenda to 1/4 cup brown sugar (don't like fake sugar) and I didn't cook the sauce ahead of time.  I marinated the chicken in the sauce for a couple of hours then baked all together.  It was very good.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!  It was a big hit with my dinner guests. I skinned bone in thighs and had to use nutmeg and brown sugar leftover from holiday cooking as substitutions. Otherwise I followed the recipe as indicated. Because of the size of the thighs I  cooked them for an hour and turned them at 30 minute intervals.( I think bone in thighs with skin tend to be larger but cost less). Once the thighs reached the required cooking time and were removed from the oven, I let them come to a complete rest before serving. The thighs were moist and tender and the sauce was extremely flavorful,. All ingredients blended perfectly! The chicken was served alongside brown rice and roasted veggies.

Had this tonight!  Actually had teriyaki sauce so I didn't have to make the one listed.  And we only had chicken breast tenderloins so the cook time was decreased drastically, =P  The taste was incredible!

Teriyaki chicken sounded good so I was anxious to try this.  I made the recipe as written except that I substituted brown sugar for Splenda.  I was afraid the cider vinegar would be too assertive and my fears were confirmed.  I think this would be better with no vinegar or half of the vinegar.  Also, fresh grated ginger has 10X more flavor than ground ginger...I'll never use the ground ginger again.  Teriyaki flavor was pretty good....just needed some extra flavor somewhere.  Also, 1 hour was WAY too long.  I cooked half of the thighs with skin on and half without skin.  Even the pieces cooked with skin on were starting to get too dry.  45 min would be plenty.  I think this recipe is a decent starting point but I'm shocked that it has so many 5 star reviews.

Very good, we ate more than we needed it was so good.  Although, Teriyaki is the wrong name for it since there is no teriyaki in it.  It came out very sweet and moist, falling off the bone!

This was delicious and so easy to make! I used the recipe for the sauce and it turned out great. Thickened up pretty quick. I did change the baking time, because an hour at that temp seemed to be too much. I baked the thighs for 30 minutes, turning half way through. Could have probably baked them 20-25 minutes though.

This was a big hit with my family.  Even my very picky 9yr old loved it.  I used brown sugar instead of splenda.  Also I made an extra batch of sauce, I ran out with the measurements of the recipe.  Tasted great. Will do again.

This was superb.  At first I was concerned as the sauce smelled very vinegary.  I also used brown sugar as I didnt have Splenda. This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I love chicken thighs but I also think that this would be great on breasts, especially if they were marinated first.  The sauce over the chicken and rice....  yummy!!!!

made this recipe with whole chicken thighs, as that's what I had on hand....made the sauce ahead of time, and used finely grated fresh ginger instead of powdered, 2 cloves of garlic instead of one,  and used brown sugar instead of the fake stuff..also added a good pinch of red pepper flakes for a bit of heat, and used a lower sodium soy sauce..simmered on the stove until thickened, then let it sit for 30 minutes..baked chicken as written, basting every 10 minutes..this turned out delicious, and the skin was dark and crispy...will definitely add this to the keep file, and will make this for company, it's that good!

I made both thighs and legs. So good!  Used brown sugar instead of splenda and didn't have anything but minced garlic (it works!)...great sauce!  I did as another reviewer and poured the sauce over the chicken after I brushed both sides.  The sauce is good over rice.  Great recipe!!!!

I made this tonight with chicken legs.  The only change I made was that I used brown sugar instead of Splenda based on another review.  I also made the sauce twice.  The 2nd batch was poured over the meat and put on the top rack to make it a little crispy.   The taste is Divine!!

I made this last Tuesday (10/14/14) and it was amazing!  Had enough sauce left over to make another batch of ckicken for dinner tonight! ??. I will use this teriyaki recipie from now on and not even bother with the bottled stuff!  I did make a few changes, as i did not have corn starch on hand but used quick cooking tapioca instead, and only had white vinager, but was delicious!

I would rate this five star. Very easy to prepare; a  lovely dish. I too substituted the Splenda with brown sugar but did use the cider vinegar. I will try the pineapple juice in the future just as a variation

As a Diabetic, I am thankful to be able to use SPLENDA. For those who do not need to watch their sugars, please do not judge the need to use alternative food products - be thankful for your healthy body.

I followed the recipe (using low sodium soy sauce) and it was delicious. I also sprinkled toasted sesame seeds and chopped green onions as a garnish on top when served. This was a nice touch.

Thanks for this delicious recipe. Made it a few weeks ago and my family rated it a 5 star. I used 1/3 cup Splenda brown sugar Blend because hubby is borderline diabetic and needs to cut down on sugar.  This chicken is super tasty and pretty healthy too!  Might try grilling it next time.

My family wants me to make this weekly!  They are pretty picky and usually get tired of anything I make weekly....except this!  The only changes I made were using brown sugar (as suggested by another viewer) in place of splenda and boneless chicken breasts.  I usually do dinner prep in the morning so I poured the sauce over the chicken and refrigerated it until I was ready to bake it!  UNBELIEVABLE!!  I also made extra for dipping sauce...couldn't get enough!!!

We used chicken breasts, so it wasn't quite as tasty as thighs would have been, but the sauce was great -- a little salty-- but the whole family enjoyed it!

This was a huge hit with my children and is the most requested meal!  I used coconut flour instead of cornstarch, brown sugar instead of Splenda, and coconut aminos instead of soy sauce.  I also cut it into small pieces and stir fried in a frying pan.

Very easy to make and WONDERFUL to eat.  Everyone fights for the left overs.....if there are any!  I use brown sugar vs the splenda and a dollop of honey.

I made the following changes for a smaller portion ( used wings)....halved soy sauce and vinegar. Added two tablespoons of wild honey and one of brown sugar. Used one tablespoon cold water with 1 T. Cornstarch. Used half tsp. each dried ginger and black pepper. Two cloves crushed garlic, shake of cayenne. Heat on stove til bubbly; pour into large bowl. Add wings n toss to coat. Bake at 410 degrees for 45 minutes. Outstanding! Sorry it's not the original....author's recipe was my inspiration :-)

Super easy and really flavorful.  As others suggested, I used brown sugar instead of Splenda, increased my garlic and used a teaspoon of minced fresh ginger instead of the powder.  The chicken was baked in 40 minutes.

YUMMY!  My only substitution was to use brown sugar in place of the splenda.  I did bake it at 420 degrees because my baking dish could not exceed 425 and I didn't want to chance breaking it.  I set my timer for 10 minute intervals 6 times, so not to miss basting.  We really enjoyed this recipe and I will make it again.  Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe! I made it exactly as written and couldn't have been happier. I used bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and found the cooking time of 60 mins total was perfect.

This sauce is to die for!!!! I suggest doubling the sauce since it gets thick and I like my chicken saucy. This is definitely becoming a staple in my recipe box!

I went ahead and made this recipe with regular sugar, and it was terrific! The sauce is easy to make and truly delicious. I'm making it this evening for the second time. I have found that adding a tablespoon of molasses gives it a slight taste as if I had used brown sugar. I just put that in at the beginning with everything else. Great recipe! Thanks!

Delicious! I followed the recipe, but used brown sugar in place of the Splenda. The only change I would make is to cook at a lower temp and for less time.i cooked for about 45 minutes and it was dry. Fantastic teriyaki sauce, though! Served on a bed of rice. This one is a keeper for sure!

This was a huge hit!!  I did not have ginger so I substituted allspice.  I also had chicken breasts thawed so I used them...1 hour was a little too long, but it was still delicious!  Love this teriyaki sauce recipe....will definitely use it for other purposes (wings, veggies, etc.).

This was a hit with my family...all 7 of us!  I liked making my own Teriyaki sauce, knowing what I am putting in our food.  I used sugar instead of splenda and served it with my "fried rice".  It was easy and delicious!  Thanks!

I have a very, very picky teenager who turns her nose up at anything new or different that I make.  I didn't have high hopes that she would like this recipe, but I was pleasantly surprised.   Everyone enjoyed this meal, even my picky teenager. The only deviation was I used regular sugar as I didn't have splenda.  I give fours stars for the sauce.  Will definitely make again.

AWESOME!!! BEWARE: I brushed every 10 mins for the first thirty  mins. Then I flipped them and only let them cook for ten more mins.  I took the temp of the pieces and they were DONE! If I cooked them for the additional twenty mins on the other side, they would have been overlooked. Beware! The finished chicken was perfect! My hubbie said it was better than restaurant chicken.

I thought this was really good! The whole family loved it! I did use bone in chicken breasts and a few chicken legs. Also subsituted brown sugar rather than splenda. I followed every thing else to the T and loved the outcome. I will make this again.
I'll probably lay foil in the bottom of my casseroles when baking next time though. I was scrubbing my dishes the next day cause it does blacken them up!
Thanks for the yummy recipe.

My husband loved this! Said it was probably the most moist chicken he has ever had. Used brown sugar instead of Splenda and pineapple juice instead of cider vinegar. Also used 2 breasts in place of some of the thighs.

Good, but next time like another user, I will likely use brown sugar instead of splenda and not let the sauce get quite as thick.

Sauce turned watery even though I dried the thighs well with a towel so had to take chicken out and empty liquid halfway through. Then it turned out perfect with last half-hour of baking and basting. Any ideas anyone as to watery situation? Very tasty chicken!

Since I discovered this recipe,  I make this constantly; it has become a staple in our family. I use honey or brown sugar instead of Splenda, as the original recipe called for. So tasty, my kids cannot get enough of it.

Delicious and easy to make gluten free by using wheat free soy sauce/tamari.  I also substituted brown sugar for the Splenda.

I can't tell you how many times I have made this...it is always a big hit. I also use brown sugar instead of the spenda, and I do add some fresh garlic to the glaze. Definately set oven temp to 400. Love it !!

Fantastic!!  Just made a couple of minor changes cause I didn't have everything on hand.  I didn't have enough brown sugar so I split brown & white, I didn't have ground ginger so I grated up fresh.  I used apple cider vinegar... and cooked for about 40 minutes basting every 10 minutes, turned out perfect!  My two (9 & 5 year old) little boys loved it! my 5 year old is especially finicky, ate his whole piece of chicken!  I served this with white rice and niblet corn....yummy!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I did not have Splenda as we live in Greece and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead. It was slightly too sweet for my taste, although delicious

This is delicious!  I followed the directions but was worried about the hour in the oven.  Not a problem..chicken was moist (from basting with sauce every 10 minutes).  Yummy...even kids ate with no complaints!

I love it. Used brown sugar in place of Splenda and less than called for. Used garlic powder instead of a clove because I'm lazy. Coconut aminos in place of soy sauce because my son is allergic to gluten. With bone-in, skin-on thighs, I convection baked for 30 minutes covered; flipped them and baked another 15 minutes and then uncovered for a final eight or so minutes. Cheap, easy, quick, and totally delicious!

I could say great things about the chicken but my wife thinks the sauce is the key ingredient.  In fact she ate the sauce before I had completed the dish and had to prepare more.  Guess I will have to make it by the gallon...

Substituted brown sugar for Splenda. These were really good. Messy clean up but well worth it.

This is by far my husband's favorite chicken recipe, and he's not much of a chicken fan.  It's simple and delicious!  I use the boneless chicken thighs, but I only bake them for abut 45 minutes.

I made this with close-to measurements. I used 8 drumsticks and no ginger, but I really think even without ginger it was pretty fabulous. When I turned the chicken halfway through cooking, I brushed the extra sauce on top. The only issue I personally found with the recipe, the sauce took FOREVER to thicken and bubble. I has it on the low setting for a good 30 minutes before I sped it up and turned it to medium heat for that last push to get it bubbling and thickening. Most of the household loved it, one said he "doesnt like soy sauce", the cats tried stealing it.

I used reduced sodium soy and added a fresh chopped orange to the sauce.  I then stuffed the thighs with the teriyaki orange pieces.  Baked for 45 minutes at 375 and it was great.

Very good.  I always do a lot of tweaking.  For this, I used Coconut Aminos since Soy Sauce is way too salty (even the so-called low salt).  I also use Raw Agave instead of white sugar,  just be careful since it is much sweeter than white sugar --follow the conversion.  You can also use Organic Coconut Palm sugar which is very good.  My oven cooks very high  so convert if need be  . This about the 3-4 time I have used this recipe, a keeper.

Used organic sugar and reduced the amount to taste, approximately 1/3 cup, for the sauce and cooked it on the Traeger.  It was fantastic!!

I follow this as directed and it always turns out! I make this meal about one to two times a month and my five kiddos are always excited when it's on the menu. I have been in a dinner group and often get asked for this recipe. It's an easy one to make in the morning and stick in the oven after a long day. I find this to be one of my least expensive meals to cook too. Drumsticks are usually really cheap and I couple it with rice and an Asian cabbage salad for a complete meal.

11.6.16 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/142974/oven-roasted-teriyaki-chicken/ ... As the least positive reviewer said, salty.  Asian is salty, but tasting from the pot, I couldn't see it not being too salty with the chicken.  I added 1/2c pineapple juice & an additional T cornstarch.  It's good; probably still a bit too salty for some.  'Glad I tried it.

I've been on this grilling kick lately so I decided to make the teriyaki sauce, let it cool down and then marinate boneless/skinless chicken breast (cut or pounded a little thin) for 24 hours and then grilled it for about 6 minutes on each side.  It was EXCELLENT.  I served with Burnt Butter Rice, and could easily serve with grilled zucchini, carrots, etc...  I made a big batch so my kids could snack on it thru the week, but it only lasted the first night... will have to make even more next time! :)

I double the sauce so we can put it on rice.  The only change I make is to use brown sugar instead on Splenda.  I only have packets of Splenda at home.  The family loves it.  I do it with thighs or breasts, sometimes in the crockpot.  It's all about the sauce.

This is a very good recipe.  I substitued brown sugar for Splenda and increased the garlic to two cloves.  Be sure to mix the corn starch together with the cold water prior to adding the other ingredients.

I changed the recipe as some of the other cooks did. I changed the Splenda to brown sugar. The only other change I did was marinate it for an hour (as did someone else) and then baked everything together. 
The chicken was moist and the sauce was thick...not goopy, but substantial.

I didn't have cider vinegar so I used cooking sherry instead. I also used Stevia instead of Slenda. Stevia is a natural, no calorie sweetener which is much healthier than Splenda.

I used the splenda/brown sugar mix and my husband said it was a bit sweet so I will cut the amount down to 1/3 cup next time. I also used 3 garlic cloves. I used regular chicken thighs (8 of them) and found that I only needed to cook them 40 minutes and even had to reduce the oven temp to 400 then 375 for the last five minutes. I combined the pan drippings with the leftover sauce and brought it to a boil since I was using a brush to apply the sauce to raw chicken. I skimmed off excess fat and then used the marinade/drippings on brown rice. We loved it and will definitely make again with those modifications. My husband and I both had second helpings and I am looking forward to the leftovers tonight (for which I may have to fight my husband as to who gets to eat them)!

My Hubby loved this and  that says it all! I did what others did and used brown sugar instead of splenda, (didn't have) I also mixed teriyaki and soy sauce together rather than all soy because sometimes its too salty!  had 4 bone-in with skin chicken thighs cause its only the two of us these days, but left the required amount of sauce so we had plenty in the pan to scoop up. Very yummy this is a keeper! thank you

Wow! My whole family loved this! The only change I made was swapping real sugar for the Splenda. I served it over ginger rice and it had everyone wanting seconds

Followed recipe directions, but used brown sugar in place of Splenda, as someone had suggested. Very good, but felt like it was still missing a little something - not sure what. Will continue experimenting...

We had this for dinner last night- serverd it over rice with asparagus and it was very good! We had 6 skinless chicken thighs and the sauce was plenty, with some to spoon over rice. If I were baking 12 thighs, I would double the sauce especially if you like the idea of serving the sauce, too. I was afraid the meat would get too crusty/dry, given the chicken was skinless so I covered the dish with some foil and cooked for about 25 mins. Then basted the thighs with sauce and cooked covered for another 15 mins or so, basted again and finished with the foil off so a little gooey crust could form. My husband's 2 boys were quiet for the first 5 minutes cuz they were devouring this!! definitely will be making this again! You could also use just chicken chunks mixed in the sauce. Very yummy!

Very good.  The front end prep does take longer than I expected, maybe about 1/2 an hour.  It took 45 minutes in the oven total.  I substituted the brown sugar as well, which tasted great.

I doubled the sauce (for rice), though I found I didn't need to. Plenty of sauce! I used boneless thighs, and baked 30 minutes total. Wonderful!

The chicken was horrible even when you follow the recipe. It was too salty and the amount of ginger gave a bitter taste. It was also extremely sweet,.

I prefer to marinate the chicken overnight, but this was a good sauce for when I didn't have the time to marinate the chicken. I used brown sugar in place of splenda. Otherwise I followed this exactly.

This is the one!  Perfect, delicious chicken.
I used 1/2 c brown sugar and grated fresh ginger. I did bake it for one hour and lined the pan with tin foil.
This will be my "go to" recipe for teriyaki chicken.

I made this super easy recipe last night and it turned out really good :) I made the changes that others have recommended, such as using brown sugar and I only baked the thighs for 40 minutes, b/c an hour seemed just too long.  Served with white basmati rice and my husband and 13 month old loved it.  Hubby also said it makes for good leftovers, as well!  Stuck it in my recipe box and will definitely be making this again, cleanup was so simple!

Just fixed this dish tonight. I followed the recipe exactly except substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar for the Splenda as we don't use artificial sweeteners in our house. 

I think the bake time is off. I checked the thighs after 45 minutes and they registered well over 170 F. The coating got a little burnt, too. As some have remarked, cleaning the pan is going to be rough.

The recipe would have been better with fresh ginger and more vinegar, in my opinion, as well as a lower baking time. Next time, I may tweak it an try the thighs on the grill.

followed the recipe except we don't use artificial sugar so I used brown sugar instead.  This sauce burns your dish and makes a mess even with Pam. We liked the dish but I have tasted better so only 4 stars.

Tender, juicy, amazing flavor!  You can't tell it's Splenda, and it's so nice to see a recipe that avoids sugar.  It was fine with low sodium soy sauce, too.  I used all of the sauce for 6 boneless thighs - you might need more sauce if you're making 12.  I thought one hour was a long time to cook chicken at such a high temp, but it was perfect and not dry at all.  Really fantastic recipe!!!

I made this for dinner last night and even the picky eater cleared her plate. This was phenomenal! The only change I made was a used white vinegar only because I didn't have cider vinegar. It was easy to make and made the house smell SO good! I would defenitley recommend lining the pan with foil first. That saved me so much cleaning!

Mmm this was so yummy! What I did was I used rice vinegar in lieu of cider vinegar and used brown sugar instead of Splenda. I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and sauteed in in a pan. Mu husband said it was allot better than a Japanese restaurants we have out here. Thank you for sharing, I*'ll be using this recipe any time I make chicken teriyaki

Loved this recipe.  Be sure to use low sodium soy sauce to avoid the too salty complaint some reviewers made.  I used boneless thighs and reduced the cooking time to 40 min.  Next time I will double the sauce so it can be served over the rice I make to go with the chicken.  So very good!

This sat in my recipe box for 2 years - do not make the same mistake!  I made this tonight with no leftovers!  I used 3 cloves of garlic, cooked 6 thighs for 40 mins, and topped with chopped green onion.  My husband and I LOVED it!!!  I also used brown sugar instead of Splenda.

This is a very yummy, simple, and quite easy dish to prepare. I wanted more of a BBQ vibe so I added a tablespoon of molasses to my splenda to make; brown sugar splenda........ Delish! Though to be honest its not fancy nor gourmet, it is however perfect for an every week goto when you're wiped from a long day. It is tasty!

So delicious and super easy! I left out the ginger (not a fan). Per another comment, I shortened the cook time by 6 mins on each side (in a convection oven). They came out beautifully.

The recipe is Great!! One recommendation I do have is that (at least in my convection oven) 1 hour is FAR too long. I flipped them after 15 min and they were done in another 15 (30 in all).

let me just say, that this is a good base all by itself.

However, since I have made it this way before, tonight i switched it up some...
I added juice from one lemon
and a few drops of liquid smoke.  Those two changes transitioned this into a smokey citrus teriyaki, and I must say.  It was stupendous!  I baked the chicken thighs covered for 15 minutes at 375, with some lemon pepper, paprika, and olive oil on it, then I took it out, slathered on the sauce and stuck back in the oven to finish (occasionally adding more sauce so it would glaze nicely.  great stuff.  Served with jasmine rice and broccoli!

I LOVE IT! Tastes wonderful. I did add more water though. The syrup the ingredients turn into didn't really look like it was going to spread the flavor love to all the chicken. :)

Normally I do not like teriyaki dishes but I decided to try this one because I looked good and I thought it would go nicely with a watermelon cucumber salad I was also making along with fresh corn on the cob.  I figured I would not really enjoy it but everyone else would...so I made it.  Well was I ever wrong.  I loved it. Everyone loved it !  It was so flavorful I even ate an extra piece of chicken!  I did use brown sugar instead of Splenda, and added an extra clove of garlic and about a half tsp. of ground coriander.  With the left over sauce I added a little wine ( I used Marsala because I had that ) brought it back to boil to make sure it was safe after basting chicken and I had a wonderful sauce to pass.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this recipe with cut up boneless chicken breast and boneless skinless thighs. The smaller pieces meant the chicken only had to be cooked about 7 minutes per side at 425F, which made it a super quick and delicious meal. I also used half brown sugar and half Splenda, and used a low sodium soy sauce to keep the saltiness at bay. Highly recommended and we'll be making this again. Serve it with steamed rice and broccoli for a healthy fast meal.

Thought I had to try this recipe, it looked delicious.  It smelled wonderful when I made the sauce and the chicken was in the oven.  However, the taste just didn't live up to my expectations.  I used chicken breasts and the original recipe except 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar in place of the Splenda. My family was not interested, husband said it looked like a tv dinner.  It wasn't terrible but I won't be making it again.

Used red wine vinegar, low sodium soy sauce, and half the garlic.  Basted every ten minutes with additional sauce.  This turned out GREAT--moist and juicy, even after an hour in the oven.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks!  Great recipe for two or a crowd!

Wow! Actually followed this recipe and was very impressed with the turnout. Only downside is cleaning the pyrex dish, may use more PAM spray next time. That sugar turned the glass pitch black! Will be making again and again, thanks for another recipe for the binder!

Excellent sauce, however we used brown sugar as recommended by others. We baked half as directed and grilled the other half.  Hands down, grilling was the best!

Made this tonight and substituted honey for the Splenda and I used low-salt Soy.  My family really enjoyed it.  I will make again with boneless/skinless thighs.  Served with brown rice and sauteed spinach.

Excellent! I used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend, bottled minced garlic and boneless, skinless thighs because this is what I had on had. This chicken was perfectly done, moist and flavorful after baking 20 minutes per side. This is a keeper. We didn't have any leftovers!

Also doubled the sauce and poured over thighs. Used brown sugar instead of Splenda and pumpkin pie spice instead of ginger! (Out of ginger!)
Covered for 25 min at 375, uncovered for 20 min.
Served over rice with extra sauce.
AWESOME!!  I'll use the pumpkin pie spice next time, too.

Alright, so my teenagers say 4 out of 5 stars.  They really liked the taste of the Teriyaki sauce. I did use brown sugar in place of the Splenda but added a touch more of the apple-cidar vinegar as it was tasting a bit to sweet for me.  After it was cooked, wasn't as sweet as I thought, was really perfect.  I served this with Garlic Asparagus and Yellow Rice.  Very good meal, fed 5 hungry people.

This is the best recipe for teriyaki chicken I have tried, and I have tried a few. Due to my youngest son's food sensitivites I had to switch out wheat flour in place of cornstarch and brown sugar/stevia blend in place of splenda. The rest I kept the same. i did bake it at a lower temperaturem,375, for longer, 1.5 hours, and everyone loved it. A keeper!

Used brown sugar instead of Splenda.  Cooked 30 minutes covered then 30 uncovered. Chicken was delicious and fell apart it was so tender.  Will put this in the regular rotation.

Five stars because it is so flavourful and simple to prepare. My kids devoured it. It's in the regular rotation now. I used brown sugar instead of Splenda as some other reviewers suggested. Just personal preference. Served with rice to soak up all the juice with steamed asparagus. Also used boneless chicken thighs to reduce the cooking time. Nice one!

My family LOVED this! When it went in the oven I was kind of worried as it was still runny but it thickened up well. I used hind quarters cut up, and just turned the chicken rather than basting it.

I have made this recipe about six times.  My husband really loves it.  The teriyaki is good however I double it cause I like my chicken saucy.  I use boneless/skinless chicken thighs.  Don't need to cook 30 minutes on each side.  20 minutes on each side is enough.  I made with the Oven Roasted Asparagus and rice.  Was great meal for company.

I made this receipt with a whole chicken EXCELLENT the flavor was GREAT the chicken was juicy & tender. My family LOVE  it. It was easy to make, be sure to keep brushing the sauce over the chicken to allow the flavor to sink in. Next time I will try the chicken thighs.

This was yummy and quick and easy to make.  I used brown sugar instead of Splenda.  I brushed remaining sauce onto chicken (for a thicker coating) twice when it was in the oven.  The chicken came out moist and tender.  Will definitely make this again!!   I paired the chicken with broccoli and carrots for dinner.

I fixed this for supper tonight and it was a hit. The only thing I did different was to use Stevia in the Raw instead of Splenda. I served it with stir fry vegetables and rice. I think the sauce will be great this summer for a grilling sauce as well and will be looking forward to trying it out.

Great moist chicken-recommend doubling the sauce for rice or noodles. I used white sugar, chopped up fresh ginger.  Easy to make-looks like a million!~!

Found this recipe while I was looking for something to do with leg quarters.  Used white sugar instead of Splenda and leg quarters instead of thighs.
It was a hit!  Even my pickiest eater (my husband) loved this, and he usually likes white meat only.  The sauce was easy to make and absolutely delicious.  I'm thinking on using the sauce on veggies, to get my kids to eat them.

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  Followed the recipe to a "T" with the exception of using boneless, skinless thighs and brown sugar for the splenda.  Makes for great leftovers to munch on. Will be making this dish again.  Maybe place in a crockpot and take to a party.  YUM....

I used a mix of white and dark brown sugar instead of the Splenda and fresh ginger. Otherwise, followed this exactly.  The sauce/glaze is excellent.  I didn't find it too salty at all, but that might be because my soy sauce is low sodium. I do think that next time though, I will cut the chicken into small pieces and stirfry it instead of baking the thighs.  This just seemed to me more like a teriyaki-chicken-and-vegetables-over-rice type of dish.

Lightyears away from anything remotely teriyaki. This was just not for us. For some very odd reason, the sauce got lighter when we baked the chicken so it looked more like gravy. The taste was off.

Great recipe.  I used brown sugar in place of splenda and marinaded for an hour or longer in sauce. Plan to increase marinade time next time I make this.  Son and husband both loved it.

Really an excellent recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I had 8 thighs instead of 12.  The entire family loved it!
Edited Addition - Added 1/4 tsp Chinese Five Spice to sauce and baked 20 minutes on each side.  Still excellent!

This is super good! Like others, I used brown sugar instead of splenda and regular vinegar instead of cider vinegar.  Also, cook for about 40-45 min.  Finally, if you have skin on your chicken either cover with tin foil or flip the chicken half way through to avoid burning the skin.  This was soooooo easy to make and super delicious!

Restaurant style chicken teriyaki. Served with rice, broccoli and carrots. I didn't have a brush handy so I poured the sauce into the pan on top of the chicken and flipped the chicken in the sauce every now and then. Use foil to line your pan if you are going to do this. Works great with brown sugar and extra garlic. Use lemon for cider. A+

This was a fantastic recipe and the chicken turned out wonderful.  Like many others that reviewed this recipe I substituted Brown Sugar for the Splenda.  Also, cooking time was only 40 minutes rather than one hour.  First time I have tried to make home made Teriyaki sauce and now I am hooked on it.  I will definitely do this one again!

I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar in place of Splenda (don't like the after taste), white vinegar instead of cider and omitted the ginger cause I had none. I also reduced the cooking time by ten minutes. It came out fabulous! It was not overly salty if you use the low sodium soy sauce too! This novice cook will be making this again! Yum!!

Excellent.  Just as described and full of flavor. A little high-maintenance,  with all of the basting every 10 minutes,  but worth it.

not bad! would have been better if I hadn't forgotten the soy sauce, DOH!! Used cubed chicken breast, a little dry but probably my fault. Will try again with thighs and I will remember he soy sauce!

This recipe definitely deserves 5 stars! My husband raved about it. I used 'chicken' strips made from chicken breasts and then followed the recipe. Instead of using minced garlic I used powdered garlic. Other than that I followed it to a tee. The chicken came out tender and delicious. I put in the same oven a pan of cut up potatoes, peppers and onions and roasted them with a little olive oil and salt and pepper to serve with the chicken. It was fantastic!

We really enjoyed this recipe. My husband said it was better than a restaurant's, and asked if I would make it again. I used brown sugar instead of the sweetner and only baked it for about 45 minutes. If I had gone any longer than that, they would have been overcooked.

I did use brown sugar to replace the artificial sweetner. The sauce is perfect. I used it on chicken legs and on long grain rice. I will make this over and over again. Thanks for sharing.

I made the sauce just as it is explained in the recipe. I used chicken breasts and only cooked it for 35 mins and it came out perfect. Even my picky 2 1/2 year old liked it.

Swapped out the Splenda for brown sugar, but did everything else the same.  WOW!  That is far and away the best chicken recipe I have ever made!
