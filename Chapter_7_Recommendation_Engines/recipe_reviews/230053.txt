I scaled it down to one, using a jigger each of the peppermint schnapps and creme de cacao and a splash of half-n-half and grenadine. Delicious!

Delicious!  Don't use more than a splash of grenadine though.  Too much and it looks like pepto bismal.

If not for the candy cane, the drink would have lacked flavor and pizzazz.  I could barely detect any alcohol, much less the peppermint schnapps.  It was only when the candy cane started to melt in the glass that I could  taste peppermint.  Sure,  I could have added more schnapps, but I just couldn't get into it enough to start tweaking.

These were tasty, but sweet.  Definitely a dessert martini.  I used 75% non-fat milk and 25% whipping cream instead of half and half, other wise followed the recipe exactly.  I do plan to make these again.  I'm going to crush a candy cane, and rim the glasses with the crushed candy cane.  Yes, it'll be sweeter, but the presentation will be worth it!  Thanks for the recipe.
