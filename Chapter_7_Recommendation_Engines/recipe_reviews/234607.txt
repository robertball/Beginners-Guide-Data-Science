Each year I try something new to add to my "must make" list for the holidays. These meatball were at hit! Not one left over. I made these exactly as the recipe indicates. No need to switch thugs up. I will defiantly make these again.

I only used 1/2 a teaspoon on allspice and it still was a little much. I followed everything else per the recipe. This is a good meatball recipe. I would recommend that you broil the meatballs for 2-3 min after cooking.

I used grass fed beef, no sausage, and a different brand apple butter. We really liked these, even my 2 and 4 year old kids! I would make more sauce next time though.

PARTY!! This was a party in your mouth! I made this for supper tonight, yes, for supper ; not for a party. I made them entree size instead of the tight little balls they talk about. I did everything but put the apple butter in them or use allspice, I used garlic powder in them. I also didn't use  apple butter in the sauce and both turned out KNOCKING!!
