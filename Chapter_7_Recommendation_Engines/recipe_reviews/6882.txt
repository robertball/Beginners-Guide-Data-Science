Quick disclaimer...I loved this recipe; great crust with a soft, yet, chewy center.  With that said, I'll poke some holes in the instructions.  First, the recipe does say 2 and 1/2 half packages of yeast--there was some confusion among previous reviewers.  So...1 pg. of active dry yeast = .25 ounces or 2 and 1/2 teaspoons per packet.  I used 5 teaspoons of yeast in my trial batch and it went well.  Secondly, most people (like me) may want to add more salt and some butter.  The trial batch came out a bit bland.  I'm going to add another 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of butter.  Since butter is only 15% water, one tablespoon shouldn't affect your total liquids that much.  One last note, the first rise in my trial batch doubled in 30 minutes.  Luckily the bench proof added another 40 minutes to the rise.  With those adjustments made, this recipe is definitely a keeper.

All I can say is "Wow".  I tried this recipe twice.  The first time I made this, I found the bread to be a bit too dense, but the second time, I added a pinch more yeast and only used 5 cups of flour.  I made a nice long baguette and brushed the loaves with just a beaten egg white (left out the water) and I got a nice crust and a lighter loaf.  Has come out perfect every time.

This is a very good & easy french bread recipe.  I first made the bread exactly as described and ended up with dough that was a bit too dense.  The bread was good but a bit thick and a little on the bland side.  Being an experimenter and something of a perfectionist, I decided to give it another try and proofed the yeast in the warm water with a little bit of sugar before making the dough.  I also decreased the flour (noting that the 6c in the ingredient list was more of a guideline and that the real goal was nice, elastic dough) to ~5 1/4 c.  I also  increased the salt amount to 1.5tsp as other reviewers had mentioned.  This batch was considerably lighter and more tasty than the original recipe. While bread making is up to taste, I'll be doing it the second way from now on!  Great recipe and thanks very much for sharing it!

I'll put it to you this way, this recipe made 2 loaves, I planned on serving it with dinner.  When I took it out of the oven I "decided" that I had to be the guinea pig, or pig if you will,  because I ate half of 1 loaf.  Then the kids came home from school & they polished off the first loaf, and the second was a quarter gone.  Hubby came home from work & snagged a chunk (suprising because he's not the biggest bread fan), & before I knew it, the four of us (baby had regular bread..egg alergy) were sharing 1/4 of the second loaf with dinner; all staring at it, nobody wanting to "grab" because deep down we all knew that we had eaten our share.  This was AWESOME, I sprinkled sesame seeds on the top after adding the egg white.  LOVE IT, THANKS MUCH Jenn!!!

Very easy to make and who doesn't like hot fresh bread right out of the oven!
I took the time and read most of the reviews, and based on their suggestions the bread came out perfect! So that you don't have to read them all yourself, I've combined them here:  5 cups flour instead of 6, 2(.25 oz) pkgs active dry yeast, 1 Tablespoon salt, and made the cuts in step 4 after the 3rd sentence.  If you use Pure Spring Water(not to be confused with distilled water) and Fine Sea Salt(make sure it's Fine sea salt and not Coarse, and it will dissolve perfectly in your dough), it will make it even better!  Kneading bread is great therapy...it's a great place to take out your frustations!  Don't skimp on kneading time. Set a timer if it helps. If the dough is under-kneaded, the gluten will not be developed enough to allow the dough to rise during fermentation.  Yeast:  1st check the expiration date; old yeast could be dead or too lethargic. Proofing always helps. To Proof yeast: In a medium bowl combine 1/2 cup warm water (100-110 F), 2 teaspoons sugar, and the 2 pkgs of yeast this recipe calls for, let stand 10 minutes. If mixture doubles in volume, the yeast is active. This leaves you with only 1-1/2 cups water to be added to the flour. Great recipe Jenn!  Thank you!!!

This came out just as I intended, crust was nice and golden, crispy, crunchy and crusty on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Exactly what I wanted. Thanks.
 I did add an extra pinch of salt, and a table spoon of suger in hte first step. If you want less dense bread let is rise longer. Also, if you cut the lines in the top of the bread BEFORE you let it rise the second time, that prevents it from falling in (and becomming more dense) when you bake it.
What I think might be really great is to coat the bread with garlic butter, before rolling it up. I think it would make wonderful garlic bread.

Oh my!  This bread is wonderful.  I bake bread almost every week, and decided to try something different.  I did change a couple of things to suit my family's taste.  I proofed my yeast with about a tablespoon of honey in the water.  Also to gain a soft and chewy crust, about 5 minutes before the bread was done I melted about 2 tablespoons of butter and stirred in a tablespoon of honey.  As soon as the bread came out of the oven, I poured this over the top, placed a piece of foil over it, and placed a damp towel over the whole thing.  Let this sit for about 15 minutes and the result will be an amazing bread.  I just hope I don't eat it all before my family gets home for dinner!

I have always been so intimidated by bread making! Well, the first batch was a total disaster! So, knowing there must be some tricks to French bread making, I researched online. Trick no.1: I found out that by adding natural dough enhancers (1/2 tsp soy lecithin added to the liquid ingred., a pinch of citric acid and a dash of ground ginger added to the dry ingred.) you get a fluffier bread that will stay fresh and soft longer. Trick no.2: kneading and flour qty. I used 5 cups flour. The kneading for 10 minutes is a must if you want fluff in your bread. Trick no.3: let it raise!  The dough needs to double (this could mean 15-20 min up to one hour) and you test for doneness by sticking a finger in the middle of the raised dough, making sure the indentation stays and it does not spring back. If it springs back and it is not double in volume, it needs to stay longer. Trick no.4: Roll it thin in the rectangle shape and then roll it up tight forming a thin "baguette". After trying many different ways, I decided my breads looked best when I made my diagonal cuts at this step, then I let it raise again for about 10 minutes. One remark: French bread requires a water wash and baking with steam to come out crunchy, eggs are a no-no on this type of bread. To get the steam, simply put an oven safe container on the bottom shelf of the oven and use a water spray pump to mist water over the loaves twice while it's baking, instead of the egg wash the recipe mentions.

Perfection! Beautifully fine texture and creamy taste.  I have sensitive teeth however so the hard crust was a little too hard for me.  For a softer, yet still deep golden crust use this as an egg wash.  Mix together 1 egg yolk and 1 tbsp milk, brush over entire loaf before baking.  It's only slightly softer and actually comes out more golden and glossy.  I loved the rolling trick too!

Terrific! I made two loaves and they came out exactly as Jenn stated: crisp, crunchy crust and slightly chewy center. Everyone loved them and I'll be making this again. Very easy and quick. (I kneaded the dough in my mixer with a dough hook for ease.)

I've done quite a lot of baking, but for some reason never tried my hand at bread making.  This recipe sold me.  It worked beautifully.  I proofed my yeast before hand with 2 packets, 1/2 cup warm water, and 2 tsp sugar.  I then added the flour and 1 1/2 cups more water.  I used extra salt and only about 5 cups flour.  I used a whole egg instead of whites.  Also I cut the slits right before the last rise.  It's true, don't skimp on the kneading.  All of these 'tweaks' were submitted by other users, I thought I would put them into one post to make things easier for the next newbie.  Thanks for the recipe, and thanks to everyone who added their own input.

THE best french bread recipe, and I've tried many!  This is the only french bread recipe I use anymore...always comes out great.

Some tips...sometimes I use my large crock pot to help the dough rise, especially in the winter.  I'll turn it on for a minute, then unplug it (just to get it everso slightly warm), then I'll oil the inside and put the dough in with the top on.  This makes it rise a little on the fast side, but it does a good job, especially in a coldish kitchen.

Sometimes when I make this recipe, I brush the top with olive oil instead of egg white.  Othertime I've tried water.  The egg white makes it the shinest of the three.

Also, I tend to brush whatever I use on it right before baking instead of after shaping the loaves (per recipe)...I do this because whatever I cover the loaves with sticks to the egg white and pulls the top of the dough off sometimes.

A really great recipe...so easy!  Oh, also, I love to eat this bread with honey butter (just equal parts blended in a mixer) so yummy!

This was fun to make, but the end product was dense and the flavor wasn't that great.  I'll keep hunting.  I think a little sugar would have helped.

Great french bread recipe, used 2 tsp salt instead of 1.5 tsp and 5.5 c. bread flour - also made bread using the following tips from those in the know: Once dough comes together, knead with dough hook 2-3 min, rest 7 min, knead again 2-3 min, rest 7 min, knead again 2-3 min for better dough texture, also once you put the bread in the hot oven, throw 1/2 to 3/4 cup water on the bottom of the oven, this will create a great crispy crunchy crust. I cut dough into 8 pieces and shaped into smaller sub sandwich size rolls, baked at 375 for 10 min, brushed with egg white/water mixture and then baked another 8 minutes for perfect bread. This is now my favorite bread recipe.

I brought this recipe with us to an island over spring break, because we planned on eating in every night and groceries were very expensive. I made it exactly as written, except that I added a Tbsp of butter, as suggested by another reviewer, and I didn't have a bread machine (nor a stand mixer) so I proofed the yeast in the water for ten minutes first, adding about a tsp of sugar to feed it. Then I mixed in the rest of the ingredients (by hand...I have developed very strong arm muscles over the course of the last week!) and picked up the recipe from there. Out of the eleven of us that were staying together, it was a huge hit with all of them. So much so that I ended up making it four times!  Who would have known that delicious fresh baked French bread could be so easy!  Thanks for such a great recipe!  UPDATE:  This morning I was looking through a bread cookbook that a friend of mine had let me borrow, and guess what I found!  This exact recipe!  In case anyone was wondering, it's on page 11 of the 1979 Better Homes & Gardens All-Time Favorite Bread Recipes.

The first time I made this bread it turned out wonderful.  I have made it two times since, and it has been a disaster.  I don't know what I am now doing wrong.  When I go to cover the bread with a damp cloth to let it rise again, the cloth sticks to the dough and as I pull the cloth off, the dough flattens.  I have followed the recipe precisely both times so I am not sure why the cloth is sticking to the dough.  Can anyone help?

This is an easy french bread recipe, just right for personalizing. I use this as my standard Italian "soft" dinner bread. I do add approx 1 T of softened butter while it is in the KA. Its so predictabe that I walk away from it while the KA is doing its job. I have spread diced green chili and chedder on it before rolling (to go with chili), as well as smashed roasted garlic and asiago, as well as having added garlic powder, Italian herbs, EVOO to the dough. I have yet to have this fail- regardless of what I do to it! I also makes the best pizza dough, rolling it out after the first rise and baking on a stone. Thanks for sharing a great and versitle recipe. I use this so much I don't even have to look it up anymore.

Great recipe!  Easy and simple.  However, the test version I made was kinda blah.  I compared this recipe with others, and it seems to be WAY undersalted.  Today, I made it again with 1 tablespoon (not a teaspoon) of salt, and it was perfect.  Gotta rate it a 4 for blandness.

It's not quite french bread. I gave this a 4* not because it makes bad bread. In fact, the bread tastes quite good. It's just not "french bread". True french bread has only 4 ingredients. Flour, Water, Yeast, and Salt. Add anything else and call it "French Bread" gets you the guillotine. Or at least makes the spirit of Julia Child cry. And you shouldn't do that.

But since it's incredibly hard to replicate the crust without using eggwhite and since the dough is sticky the cornmeal comes in handy...and since most of us don't live in france, it's pretty darn good french bread =)

Thanks, Jenn for sharing such a WONDERFUL recipe.  My husband and I have not had french bread this good since we lived there!

I also processed the dough using the "dough only" setting on my bread machine, and removed it just before the final rising cycle, then shaped and completed the final rise conventionally.  I placed the loaves in a perforated french loaf pan, and brushed with water just prior to baking, and VOILA, C'est Magnifique!  Bet you can't eat just one...

I've made this bread about fifty times, the first time as is and the second time following several reviews. It's the latter which always hits the mark, every time. Basically, first I proof my yeast --using the two cups of warm water, 5 tsps of yeast, and then throwing in about 2-3 tsps of sugar. Then I add the flour, salt plus an extra teaspoon, a tablespoon of melted butter, and I follow the rest of the directions exactly. Turns out great every time!

Bread is a finicky thing and everyone has different ideas about what is "just right", but this is an excellent base recipe. I've used it about a dozen times, experimenting with slight variations to get it just the way I like it. Today I used bread flour (Robin Hood "Best for Bread") instead of all-purpose for the first time and what a difference! The crust is lightly crispy (not chewy) and the inside is a lot fluffier. I also used 2 tsp of salt, only 5 C of flour, and a pure egg white wash (no water). Making the cuts before the last rise is also a good idea (as another reviewer suggested). Thanks the the original poster and also the reviewers for such great tips!

I make this bread on a regular basis and everyone loves it. I use 5 teaspoons yeast and only slightly less than 5 cups of flour. People who say it's too dense are probably using too much flour. Put in the 2 cups to start, then mix in 2 more cups with a spoon. Mound up 1 more cup on your work surface, turn the dough out on top of it and knead the last cup in until it's a stiff, elastic consistency.  I've used both all-purpose and bread flour and it comes out much better with bread flour. I also increased the salt to 2 teaspoons after making it a couple of times -- just a preference. You don't have to proof the yeast, I think people who recommend this do it out of habit, which is fine but not necessary for the recipe. I'll be bringing it to Christmas dinner this week. Contrary to other reviews, I don't find it "bland" at all (even before I increased the salt). It's very yeasty and reminds me of the fresh loaves we used to get at the panaderia in Spain.

I would recomend this recipe to anyone interested in baking bread!  Fantastic texture and simple to make.  I have recently began cooking/baking as a hobby.  This recipe is not only simple, but it makes for a perfect side to evening dinner.  I made a different recipe last weekend for my wife and she had to help because I am still rather clumsy in the kitchen.  She was not impressed to say the least. I made this for my wife and the little ones and they now think I am the god of bread making.  My wife liked it so much that she was jealous and tried to out-do my accomplishment today by making her own recipe.  I only altered the recipe by sprinkling a few granules of kosher salt on the top as I painted it with egg whites the second time (everyone loved this final touch). I am making it this weekend to have with baby back ribs.  I can't say enough about how grateful I am that you have shared this recipe.  It has not only increased my confidence in the kitchen, but it also allowed my wife to have confidence in me while I am making dinner for the family!  Thank you again!

There is nothing 'traditionally French' about this bread. Traditional French bread has a very crisp outside with a very airy, light inside- there's barily anything to it. While this bread browned beautifully and LOOKED like a French loaf, the inside was way too dense for any good bread, tasted a little too much of yeast and leaves a very unpleasant aftertaste in your mouth. It was more like a low-quality bagel in loaf form. Less than 15 hours after it was made, it was practically inedible. The dense center was barily chewy when it came out of the oven and was even less chewy now. The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is that slices of it toasted and with cream cheese, like a bagel, are pretty good. Overall, though, it was not good at all.

I gave this a 4 because I had to make several changes to make it flavorful.  1.) We are not big salt fans, but it did need extra salt.  2.) It needed a dab of sugar.  3.) It needed either butter or EVOO.  I used butter.  
Here is what I plan to do next time:
a.) 2tsps salt instead of 1.5.
b.) Add 1tsp sugar - use it to proof the yeast 
c.) Add 1.5 tsps EVOO
d.) Score the bread before the second rise instead of after.
e.) Skip the egg wash.  Instead, preheat oven to 500, add the bread, add 1cup water to small pan to create steam.  Lower the temp to 450 and bake for 12 mins at 450 then rotate the pans and bake for another 15 to 25 mins until the bread reaches an internal temp of 200degrees.  This should yield the crispy crust that we prefer at our house, without the egg wash.
Note: Based on other recommendations, I also tried the accelerated version, where the bread is left to rise 10 mins, then shaped, scored, and immediately washed with a whole-egg wash, then left to its final rise.  This method worked pretty well, but it resulted in too fine of a crumb, whereas I prefer more holes and a looser crumb for Frend Bread.  It really needs the full first rise and the full second (shaped) rise to make that happen.  The full two rises also add flavor due to the fermentation time.

Excellent!  I used my bread machine for the beginning of the recipe (makes a lot less work) and it worked out just fine.  I did not need the entire amount of flour.  I suggest decreasing it by 1/2 cup.  Also, I steamed the bread for the first 15 minutes of baking by putting ice cubes on a cookie sheet on a lower rack.  My husband is a bread guru and just kept saying "delicious."  He ate 1/2 of a loaf by himself.  Chewy, cruchy, beautiful...YUM!

Yum!  This was a delicious and easy yeast bread.  I added a little honey.  I will definitely make this one again.
After the first rising, I froze half the dough.  When I wanted to use it, I put it in the fridge to thaw for a few hours (overnight it fine - I did it in 5 hours) then pulled it out shaped it, and let it rise for a couple of hours (until doubled) then baked as directed.  It turned great!

This is the easiest french bread I have ever made, and it turned out perfect.  I ate half of the first loaf as soon as I took it out of the oven!  Even my hubby loved it and hes not much of a bread eater.  It went great with my spaghetti dinner!  Thanks for sharing:)

I needed six cups of croutons for another recipe, so I decided to make baguettes.  This recipe made four, and they baked up beautifully.  I read the reviewers' suggestions and decided to follow some of them.  I used 5 tsp of active dry yeast, 2 tsp of salt, and cut the flour back to a total of 5 cups; the dough was very easy to work with. This french bread is as good as any I've ever had, with perfect texture and fantastic taste.  Definitely going into my Favorites folder.

FANTASTIC bread, and such an easy recipe.  The only change I made was to add 2 tablespoons of melted butter to the warm water, then mixed the yeast in with that and let it proof for about five minutes before mixing it with the flour.  Also, some people have said they didn't put the whole 6 cups of flour in the dough, so I used only 5 cups.  But in working the dough and kneading it, I kept adding flour to take out the stickiness, so I probably used at least 5 1/2 cups, if not the entire 6 cups.    Next time I think I'll leave off the egg white and instead spray it with a fine mist of water two or three times while it's cooking to make the crust crunchier.  The recipe on here for Italian bread gives that as part of the instructions, and the crust was fantastic.

One of the better tasting French breads. Easy to make with excellent flavor. Half milk/water can be used for softer texture.

Great recipe.  It was the first time I made a yeast bread and it was easy!  We had friends over for dinner and they could not believe I made it myself.  Today, it does not taste like day old bread.

Bravo! My husband made this bread for a Christmas Eve party. It was absolutely wonderful, and I highly recommend it. We added some olive oil, and when brushing on the last of the egg, some sesame seeds. Also, six cups of flour may seem like a lot since stirring it in soon becomes too difficult. We determined that at the end the flour needs to be kneaded into the dough. Although this may be obvious to advanced cooks, the recipe directions don't make this clear. Thanks for the great submission!

Perfect! I've tried a lot of french bread recipes. I've had ones with soft crusts, dense middles, greasy loaves, and even an unfortunate 'soda cracker' bread. This is -finally- what I've been searching for. The crust is thick, the center is chewy but soft and has intermittent pockets, and it tastes great. I only had to use 4 ½ cups of flour, the first rise was only 15 minutes, the second rise was around 20 minutes - but these are factors related to the humidity and temperature. 2 ½ packs of yeast is equal to 6 ¼ tsp, if anyone else uses jarred yeast. I opted out of using an egg wash, and put ice cubes on a pan on the bottom rack to create steam and develop the crust. Do follow the steps to roll up, as it makes a pretty loaf and creates holes. Good luck, everyone! This one is awesome!

This is my standard Italian/French bread.  I make it whenever I require either, just shaping the loaves a bit differently in either case.  This does need a bit of sugar added to it.  I add about 1 1/2 t. to the warm water before adding the yeast, then I allow the yeast to proof for a few minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I have a French bread pan from Williams Sonoma also, so between this recipe and my pan, I ALWAYS get perfect bread from this!  The last time I made this, I added about 2 t. Italian seasoning, a little black pepper, and about 2 t. rosemary (like Jo's Rosemary Bread from this site, which I love but it tends to get soggy after resting), and it handled the herbs very well and was delicious!!!

This was exactly what I wanted.  Amazing recipe.  I added more salt (2 1/2 t) and a tablespoon of sugar for the yeast.  Rose beautifully I could tell when I was shaping it how nice it was going to turn out b/c the dough was great to work with.  Crispy, crunchy on the outside, soft and slightly chewy on the inside.  Thanks!

I'm curious if I've done this wrong.  I felt that I'd followed it exactly, but my bread turned out flat.  I mean flat!!!! It rose very nicely until I formed the loaves and then it was terrible.  I'm sad to be leaving this note as I had high hopes, but I'll be trying it again and I'll come back with another note if it's better this time around.

The "rolling" up, after first rise, was a new trick I didn't know.The texture was great!

What a great recipe! Restored my husband's faith in my bread baking. I have been making it two times a week for the last couple months. I make the dough in my bread machine and bake it in a French Bread Pan (Chicago Metallic from amazon.com).  I use 2 c water, 2 1/2 tsp salt, 5 c bread flour, 2 Tbsp active dry yeast (super cheap 2 lb bag from Costco).  When the machine is done kneading, I let it rise in a big greased bowl, otherwise it would overflow. I let it rise for close to an hour. Step 3 just like in the original recipe, but I often skip the 10 minutes rest. I grease the pan, don't use cornmeal. I found that it is best to make the cuts BEFORE the second rise, otherwise it will deflate the loaf. I cover it with a DRY cloth and let rise for a whole hour. The egg wash I do AFTER the rise, and my cloth stays clean for the next use. For the eggwash I use a big 2" PAINTBRUSH that I got from the hardware store especially for baking this kind of bread. The bristles are natural, and I chose black color, in case a hair falls out, I will see it. Happened only one time.  I bake it as in the original recipe: brush it again after 20 minutes, the second part of baking I found to be 25 minutes. Also spray some water into the oven at the half of each baking sections (at around 10 and 30 minutes).  I let it cool right in the perforated pan. Jenn, thanks SO MUCH for submitting this! Half of all the bread we eat these days comes from your recipe!

This was my first time making a homemade bread with yeast and I was shocked at how well it turned out.  My fiance and I finished off an entire loaf during dinner because it was so good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It doesn't need any changes.  This will definitely go in my recipe book for life.

Very tasty and very easy to make!  I made the whole thing in my KitchenAid mixer - no kneeding involved!  The dough was so smooth and just plain perfect.  The loaves baked up beautifully and with a wonderful flavour.  They were so nice and crispy on the outside, and the inside perfectly moist and doughy, just the way I like it.  I don't make bread very often, but I'll be making this one again!

This was so good!  I wanted to make garlic bread but couldn't get to the store, so I made this recipe.  I cut the recipe in half (now wished I had made the whole recipe!) to make one loaf.  I used one cup of whole wheat flour and about 1.5 cups of white (didn't need the last 1/2 cup).  I didn't taste it plain but it made great garlic bread!  Will make again next time I need French bread!

This came out exactly like the description. Now I know why the words "fluffy" and "delicious" are no where to be found on this recipe. You can get better french bread at the grocery store for less than the cost of one .25oz package of yeast.

This was great plus it was so easy!!  I only needed five cups of flour and I put a damp towel on the bread right after taking it out of the oven as another reviewer suggested.  I crushed garlic into olive oil and we dipped our bread in that!  Oh my was it good!  When my husband came home and saw it on the counter, he thought the bread came from a bakery!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great easy recipe.  Not too dense or yeasty.  I think the "too yeasty" comments are because of mis-measured ingredients.  The recipe calls for 2 1/2 OUNCES not 2 1/2 packages!  Try it, you'll love it.

I halved this recipe for two people. I used 3 cups of AP flour. I dissolved 1 pkg of yeast into 1 cup of warm water plus I added 1T honey. I let it foam up for 5 minutes. To the flour I added 3/4 tsp salt and mixed it into the flour. I slowly added the flour into the yeast mixture. I kneaded the dough following steps 2, 3, and 4. It took exactly 45 minutes for the dough to double in size just as the submitter stated. I placed a 9X13 casserole dish filled with water on the lowest oven rack. I greased a baking sheet covered with aluminum foil with a little olive oil and sprinkled some yellow corn meal. Next I placed the loaf seam side down. I scored the top of the bread 4 x's diagonally across the bread with a sharp kitchen knife and placed the bread into the preheated oven. After the first 4 minutes I spritzed the top of the bread with water using a spray bottle, then every 3 mins after that a couple of times to achieve that golden brown crust. During the baking I noticed the top of the bread turning a nice brown color. The wonderful smell of fresh bread baking while amazing did make my mouth water thinking of eating the bread right out from the oven instead of serving it with dinner. =D This indeed produced a nice golden brown topping-very eye appealing. It's like bread you would buy from a bakery only BETTER! The bread has a nice crispy, crusty outside while the inside is soft and chewy. It is not heavily dense, just perfect!

This is the 2nd french bread loaf I've tried from AR and we really enjoyed it as well! I did think it was fairly bland and might add a touch more salt next time, but the texture and everything else was great!

While this is a solid french bread recipe, I prefer my french loaf with a little more air pockets.  This is a dense loaf, even with many of the modifications recommended by others.  I think the problem is likely the rise time.  Mine only took 30 minutes to double.  I think this loaf would have been much, much better had it been allowed to rise 3 hours, or even in the refrigerator overnight.  However, if a dense loaf is your thing, this is your recipe.  It gives nice carmelization on the crust, which I can only imagine would improve with a longer rise time.  I'll make this recipe again, but I will certainly allow it to rise for a much longer time.

This is the BEST bread! I used 5 cups of all purpose flour, 5 teaspoons of rapid rise yeast, a teaspoon of sugar to kick start the yeast. I also added a tablespoon of butter to the batter. When the bread was done, I poured a tablespoon each of melted butter and honey on top of them, covered with foil and a damp towel for 15 minutes. It made the bread soft and delectible. Thank you all who put their tips online, this recipe is going to be one that will be made often in my house!

Awesome Recipe!!!!  Perfect blend of crusty outside and chewy inside.  The only change I made was to add 1 tbsp of sugar to the water and yeast to proof first, and I added 1 tbsp of butter into the flour and crumbled it first...then added wet to dry.  My family loves when I make bread and usually the first loaf is gone as soon as if comes out of the oven....this one was no exception!  Thank you!

We are hooked on this bread!  It handles so easily, makes a perfect crust, and fills the house with wonderful aroma!  I use 5 tsp yeast and 2 tsp sugar to proof in the water.  Then I add 2 tbsp vital gluten and 2 tsp salt to 3 cups of the flour.  When all that gets mixed together really well in my trusty old Sunbeam with dough hooks, I add the next two cups of flour and then turn out to knead.  I end up using only about 1/4 c more flour.  I grease the inside of plastic wrap to cover it with (with both rises).  I highly recommend using a lightly floured rolling pin to roll it out--about a 15" by 11" rectangle suits us just fine.  Then all the rest is the same.  Oh, man!! Thanks, Jenn Hall!  Update:  I forego the egg wash now.  Instead, I use a spray bottle with water and spray the inside of the oven and the bread itself about 5-6 times during the baking.  It makes a wonderfully crunchy crust!

I did not care for this recipe.  I wish I had thought about it before I made it:  The only thing in the bread is flour and water.  It tastes like exactly that.  Eat a spoon of flour and if you like it, then you'll like this recipe.  Otherwise, it is not worth the effort.

This is a barely passable bread recipe. I made it twice. The first time it was very yeasty, quite dense, and had no flavor. The second time I included recommendations from the other reviews. I doubled the salt (2nd half after mixing first two cups of flour) and proofed the yeast in the water with 4 teaspoons of sugar. With these changes, the bread was less dense and less yeasty, but still far from true french bread. Also don't egg wash before cooking. I applied the 1st after 5 minutes of baking and gott the nice chewy shiny coat that is typical of real french bread. If you don't proof the yeast rasie the water temperature to 120-130F.

Excellent! My husband thought it was even better than the store! After 20 minutes of baking I did have to flip the loaf to even out the cooking a little as I was using a convention oven.

Sooo yummy! I mixed a bunch of garlic powder in with the dough, and then when I rolled it out, grated cheese onto the dough before I rolled it into a loaf, so when I took it out of the oven, there was a cheesy swirl in the middle. Was DELICIOUS with goulash!

Absolutely wonderful bread! So easy and turns out a great product. I slathered the top with melted garlic butter when it came out of the oven and it was a hit!

Great recipe!

As per review recommendations I proofed the yeast in the warm water first, with 2 teaspoons of sugar. 
I used 5 teaspoons total of highly active yeast, to cut down on rising time. I also sifted together 3 cups of whole wheat flour and 3 cups of unbleached white flour to add whole grains.

The highly active yeast (also called "bread machine yeast") changed the rising times by about half (45 minutes for the first rise and 25 minutes for the second rise).

As others have written, I found the recipe tastes better with double the salt and less flour. I also add a Tbs. of extra virgin olive oil and a Tbs. of vital wheat gluten per loaf. I use highly active yeast that I proof with a tablespoon of sugar dissolved in the warm water. I mix in the gluten with about 1/3 cup of flour and let the yeast start bubbling before adding more flour and the salt.

After kneading the dough, I let it rest for 10 minutes and then immediately roll and stretch it by hand into a loaf, slit the top, and apply the first coat of whole egg w/out water. I let it rise 30 minutes and then bake it right away for 20 minutes and apply the second coat of whole egg and then bake it another 20 minutes. This produces a deeper golden brown and crisper crust with bigger and less even-sized holes in the bread, which is what I want in French bread. The center of this bread comes out lighter and fluffier than the original recipe. This method also takes less time!

Finally!!! A delicious, artisan-style basic bread recipe that you do not need a bread-maker for, nor do you need more than 2 1/2-- 3 hours or so from start to finish. Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly until it was time for the brushing on of egg whites before/during cooking. I hate egg whites--I can detect them even after they have cooked on top of something. So, I brushed on melted butter before cooking and then mixed up a nice melted butter, olive oil, sea salt, rosemary, thyme, and asiago cheese conconction to brush on when there were just about 20 minutes left to cook. Excellent, excellent, excellent!

My local bakery wasnt keeping the same consistency with their French Bread.  So I decided to look up a recipe and found this 1 and stopped here!!! It comes out wonderfully everytime!!! In a way I am a little sorry 'cause my husband and kids dont want any other bread and so I'm baking sometimes 3 times a week.  I would increase the recipe for more loaves and less baking, but it is SOOO much better fresh with sliced cheese and ham. I tell you, if there wasnt anything else in the house but French Bread, the family wouldnt starve or complain!!! yeah, it's that GOOODDD!

Very good recipe, this was my first ever time baking bread and it came out just right! My family ate it fast. Others have mentioned it's density, but if you've had French bread before you know it's meant to be chewy on the inside.  Made this exactly to recipe, except when I rolled it into a rectangle I brushed on fresh minced garlic, butter, oregano, and basil, and it was amazing! It tastes just awesome buttered on the side of pasta.

Making my own french bread was easier than I thought!  It turned out beautifully and tasted great with a smear of butter or nutella.  The texture was very dense, though, and because the dough has no oil, it went stale very quickly.

The changes I made were:  1. 1 tsp sugar 2. 4 tsp instant yeast 3. 4 cups flour 4. 2 TBSP unsalted butter 5. 2 cups water 6. 2 tsp salt  Throw the whole lot into a Professional KA mixer and knead for 5 minutes. Let rise for 45 minutes. Shape into two loaves and place in french bread pan. Let rise for 30 more minutes and bake at 350.  **The flour content is individual for each person because it depends on location. Start off slowly and add in however much you need. Everyone is going to need different amounts of flour!**

CAUTION! HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!  This is my first try with this recipe and it came out perfect.  I did proof the yeast before adding the first two cups of flour.  I preheated the oven to 500 F and splashed a 1/4 cup hot water onto oven floor when I put the loaves in.  I immediatly lowered the temp to 375 F and baked as per the recipe.  Those were the only changes I made, and I couldn't be more pleased with the results.  (Crusty outside and soft inside) I love the rolling tehnique. It makes beautiful loaves.  I'll try that with other recipes.

This was great. I baked it with 5 1/2 cups of flower and a touch more salt.  After we baked it I cut it length wise and we spread butter, garlic and salt on it and then melted it under the broiler.  It was awesome.  This whole process from start to finish took about 4 hours though.

Perfect. I do proof my yeast beforehand (warm water, dissolved yeast, and a couple spoons of sugar, let set, if it foams the yeast is good). I learned my lesson the hard way to always check the yeast. Also don't let it over rise, it will fall and get flat and dense. This turns out great even though it uses all purpose flour. I make my three slashes before the second rise.

Great recipe! Like many others, I reduced the flour to 5 cups and then added about another 1/4 cup during kneading to get it to the perfect consistency. I only used 2 packets of yeast (couldn't justify using half of one) and it worked great! I also doubled the salt and mixed in a few tablespoons of melted butter prior to kneading. I also brushed butter on the tops before baking and sprinkled lightly with kosher salt. Baked with a pan of water on the bottom rack of the oven to help form the crunchy crust. The results were PERFECT!

Second time making this, I split it down into 4 smaller loaves, each about 18 inches long and 1.5 inches in diameter.  Scored them too horizontally the first time and it was dense so this time I scored them more vertically and they actually spread out better that way and it makes the crumb inside fluffier.  baked it with a hotel pan full of hot water on the bottom of the oven. actually proofed it in the fridge overnight to develop some more flavors but my fridge was a little too cold so it stopped rising. once i took it out of the fridge it took 4 hours to start proofing again and another hour until they were ready to shape.

Perfect!!!  Even on my first try, the bread came out perfectly.  My family went crazy over it, and it was gone before it was totally cool!  I've stocked up on supplies so I can make it all the time and keep it on hand.  It's so good -- pretty, too!

I thought that this bread was great!  I followed Linda McLean's recommendation and profed the yeast first.  This was only my second try at making a yeast bread.  But with the help of The Quality Cook and my friends there this turned out wonderful!  I couldn't wait for dinner to taste it and had it with honey butter right out of the oven.  And it was just as good with Garlic butter alongside Beef Stew for dinner.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I didn't care for this recipe.  The crust very very, very tough, but it was not over cooked or burnt.  Just tough.  And the flavor was very bland, even after I added herbs, and garlic.  I will not make this recipe again. Sorry.

Although there were several conflicting reviews on this bread Jenn, I must say that I'm very happy I decided to make your recipe. I'm certainly no expert on French bread, but I found it to be nice and crusty on the outside and lightly chewy on the inside. I made this for my daughter Tyler's upcoming birthday party for a crostini appetizer. As I said, I'm no French bread savy, however, I do make a lot of homemade bread without a bread machine. (More comforting to me) No matter what a recipe suggests, I ALWAYS proof my yeast. I place the yeast and water into my mixer and then add sugar or honey. I then let it proof for about ten minutes. That's just the way I think it should be done; but it's just my way. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Great Bread! After reading several of the reviews, I decided to follow the shaping directions exactly by rolling it out for the first loaf and with the other loaf, I just shaped it. I couldn't tell a difference. Both loaves tasted wonderful and looked about the same.

This French Bread recipe is a great recipe, but there are two things I do differently.  I make the cuts in the bread after forming the bread into loafs and I put the egg wash on the last 5 minutes of baking.  The reason is, if you make the cuts and add the egg wash after it has risen the bread sinks.

I have been baking bread for over thirty years, and this is the worst recipe I've ever made.  It had no taste; and even though it raised beautifully, it came out of the oven more resembling a baseball bat.  Indeed, it could have been used as one.

I thought this was an excellent recipe, it has been years since I made bread without my machine and it turned out really well!! Because I wasn't too sure about the amount of yeast ( the recipe says 2.5 pkgs?) I went with 4.5 teaspoons which is the equivalent of 2 pkgs and the bread rose well without tasting too yeasty.  This was a winner in my house, most of the first loaf was gone before supper!

Wonderful!  Great directions and along with the eggwhite wash, I sprayed inside the oven with a water bottle periodically...a trick I learned from "Emeril".  The rolling trick really makes the loaves look like authentic french bread.
Thanks for sharing it Jenn.

This took quite a bit of time but was well worth it for its great taste! It's much better than most French Bread in stores. My family ate all of both the loaves in about an hour. This bread was Very Tasty!

This recipie is fantastic.  I scaled it down by two thirds and it still worked perfectly.  This recipie gives you what you're looking for in good french bread.  It gave me the best homemade loaf of bread I've tried to date.

I tried this recipe twice, thinking maybe I had done something wrong the first time.  The dough never pulled together properly, the bread was entirely too dense, and it had very little taste, if any.  I have made many other breads with no problem, but for some reason, I couldn't get this one to work.

I am not an experienced bread maker, but I got a new stand mixer for Christmas and tried this recipe.  I followed other suggestions and started the yeast with two teaspoons of sugar in the 2 cups of water, using 5 tsps yeast.  I also added 2 T of butter to the dough.  It came out perfect.  I am making it for the second time this week as the first two loaves were eaten in one day.  I let the mixer do the mixing and the kneading, and this could not have been easier. Thanks for a great recipe.

Geez!  I have made the hat trick of breads tonight- this is the third recipe I have made, and they are all so wonderful!  This I followed exactly except I did halve the recipe, and I also added one tablespoon of olive oil (as was suggested to me on The Buzz).  When I got to the part where it directs you to divide the dough in half, I did that, forgetting I had halved the recipe.  No matter, I ended up with two small loaves, which is actually pretty perfect for my needs.  The cornmeal imparts a nice, crunchy outside, and the inside is moist and delicious.  I am very happy with this bread!  Thanks Jenn :)

This is one of the better french bread recipes that I have made. Don't try to rush the rise times and don't put cold egg white on the bread, it will collapse.

I adore this recipe. After making 2 loafs and giving 1 to my sister, I am now making it for her family too ! I used 5 cups of flour instead of 6 but WOW!!. PERFECT. I wanted soft crust so when it is hot from the oven  I slather it in butter and pop it right into a bag and into the fridge to cool. AMAZING STUFF!

This was good. I only did half the recipe, but used the same amount of salt, and it tasted great. Make sure you cut the slits deep enough and let the dough rise a second time. I was running late, so I only let it raise once. My mistake. The dough rose too fast while it was cooking and pulled apart. Still tasted good, but the look could improve.

This was a good "no poolish" french bread (I prefer a bread with a poolish that has been out overnight, but this is very nice when I didn't put anything out the night before!) with the following changes: 1. I used less flour - more like 5.25 cups. I imagine it will need more when the weather is more humid, but I have a hard time imagining it will be 6 cups. 2. I increased the salt a bit - possibly up to 2 full teaspoons. 3. I added a little bit of citric acid (about a half teaspoon) to help give the bread a little bit more of that sourdough-y tang you get with french bread made with poolish. 4. I let the dough rest a short while before kneading. I add five cups of flour before kneading and reserve the additional to add in while kneading. The dough is very wet and sticky at this point, and letting it rest a short bit aids in the gluten development so it's a little less sticky when I start to knead it.

This was good except that I think it calls for too much flour.  About 2 cups less of what it called for would have made the dough a lot fluffier.  It was good, but a bit too dense.

This recipe was simple and easy to follow.  I kneaded it using the dough hook on my Kitchenaid on medium speed, and it did the job perfectly.  I live in a dry climate and didn't need the full 6 cups of flour.  I used just under 5 cups.  The bread came out just as I'd hoped and was as good as a bakery's.

This was a very easy, right out of the pantry recipe.  I did use my bread machine for the dough cycle and it turned out perfect.  I halved the recipe and had one large loaf of french bread.  I did put a small sheet pan with about 5 pieces of ice in when I put the loaf in the oven.  I think putting the ice in made a very hearty crust.. and it's a dense loaf, not soft like the big ol' Walmart french bread.  This is the kind you get at an artisan bakery or in a top end restaurant.  Thanks for the great, simple recipe.

I made this recipe on a whim to serve with a stew, and couldn't be happier with the results. This was my first time making french bread, and it turned out perfectly... beautiful golden color, crunchy crust, chewy and lovely inside. Definitely best when fresh out of the oven :)

Very easy, and so little ingredients that I added a few.  I added a teaspoon of sugar and a teaspoon or so of olive oil--the sugar to help the yeast and the olive oil for elasticity.  Very simple, very easy, and baked up well.  I cut the baking time a bit to keep it soft, but if I'd baked longer it probably would have gotten that crust that french bread is known for.  No, this is not flavorful, but it's just a basic white bread, and it went well with the Spicy Vinegar and Oil Dip from here.  Thanks for the recipe.

I would give this 20 stars out of 5 if I could.  Best bread I have made and I have already made it 5 times and people want to ORDER it from me!  Much better than the store.  Put cornmeal on the top too and that helps.  It doesn't matter if they are ugly and it is hard to make them a perfect shape, but they are still delicious.  They are cheaper and tastier than the store. YUUUUMMMMM!

Love this recipe!  I followed it to a T except adding the 1 tbsp of sugar in the first step as other reviewers suggested.  I am new to making bread, so I approach each new recipe nervously.  I found this recipe easy to follow and very easy.  I served this with the "warm mushroom spread" on AR and it was awesome together.  I'm serving the other loaf tomorrow with Christmas dinner.  Thanks for such an awesome recipe!

Good, but the directions were a little unclear when rolling the rectangles. I wasn't sure how close, wide, etc I had to roll. Will roll them much looser next time for a larger bread. Otherwise, great indeed.

I just took this bread out of the oven 1/2 an hour ago and I've already eaten half a loaf!!  I also proofed my yeast in water with a little sugar, upped the salt and used a little less flour.  

Spritzing the oven a few times with water while the bread is baking creates steam and helps to make the crust crispy.  Also if you use a clean razor blade instead of a knife to slash the loaves they won't deflate.

I found that the loaves were a little pale baked at 325 so I raised the temperature and the result was perfectly golden tender on the inside crispy on the outside  loaves of heaven.

My first time baking this bread, and I halved all ingredients to make just one loaf. Turned out perfectly crisp and brown on the outside, and chewy on the inside. Very little work required, so easy to bake! I'm starting on another loaf to share with my co-workers tomorrow! I'm also using all organic flour.

Made this bread while I was visiting my parents this weekend. It was amazing. I followed the directions exactly but for one of the loaves I added fresh garlic butter in the middle and it came out great. We ate the first loaf when it came out of the oven, just fresh with butter and we saved the garlic loaf to eat with our spaghetti that night. We ate every bit of it and I can't wait to make it again. Thanks for a wonderful recipe

I always have reservations when trying new bread recipes - I'm an avid baker, and getting bread just right takes a extraordinary recipe and a little know-how! This one passes with flying colors.  I did tweak it, based upon reviews I read which were very helpful.  I added a bit extra salt, and I topped the bread with egg white AND a couple tablespoons of melted butter; also, I did not stop to re-apply this mixture after 20 minutes, but allowed the bread to bake straight through for 40 minutes before taking it out (my oven bakes fast.) My family was so impressed, they thought I'd purchased my loaves at Panera.  For dinner last night, I topped it with a homemade bruschetta made with my garden tomatoes! It was wonderful! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers, and I'm glad I did!  Definitely, 5 1/4-5 1/2 cups flour is enough, and going with 2 tsp salt and 5 tsp dry active yeast is perfect. My husband is a bread lover and is a bit particular (having been raised on fresh bread daily), but he loved this recipe so much he wants to know how to make it himself!

I want to give this recipe 4.5 stars. I think it lost half a star for me because of my own error (I'm new to bread baking). The taste was fantastic, but my bread turned out a little bit tough. My husband loved it and said it French bread is supposed to be chewy, but I would have preferred it to be a bit softer. I brushed it with whisked egg yolk, melted butter, and milk so the crust was very soft. It was wonderful bread, we used some of it for sub sandwiches and the rest for delicious garlic bread. I'll tweak my technique next time I make it for a softer bread.

For some reason, I found this to be really bland--even with putting in extra salt.  I'll stick with my usual recipe.

I've tried bread a time or two in the past with poor results....actually poor is being kind.  I got brave and tried this recipe and finally hit one out of the park.  The bread was delicious.  I do agree with some of the comments and will try a little less flour next time and maybe a little butter but...YUM.

I used this recipe last night..and it came out better than most of my other French bread recipes.  I'm used to using a starter along with several different types of Artisan flours. But now...in a pinch, this is a definite go-to recipe that I will use over and over again. I sliced this for grilled pannini's filled with  thin slices of turkey breast and several  grilled veggies. The sandwiches were  incredibly light  using this  bread.. I do have to say that I let it rise for over an hour though...which I feel makes a  huge difference in any rise. Perfect crunch to the outside, and light as a feather inside.Don't forget to either mist the loaves while they're baking or toss in those ice cubes for that crispie outer crust! Thanks for the recipe Jenn..

Made these for french dips last night and this was exactly what I was looking for. Perfect for dipping. The crust was nice and hard and the insides soft and moist. This'll give the baker a run for his money. The recipe is a bit bland even after adding sugar and butter, but a good starting point.
**Update** 25.1.2011
Used 1 1/2Tbsp sugar to proof the yeast, 4.5C flour and added more while kneading(so maybe 5cups?), 2tsp sea salt, 1/3C unsalted melted butter mixed in while mixing the flour. After risings, baked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. After 15 minutes, basted with olive oil. PERFECT! We like our breads on the soft side with a soft crust. So good! Now I know what everyone was talking about how they couldn't stop eating the bread. I don't have a mixer, so I did all of this by hand!

This was the best french bread I ever made! Granted it was only my second attempt at french bread. The first recipe I tried was from the joy of cooking. Compared to the joy of cooking recipe this was far less time consuming, and less complicated in its procedures- even though it came out much fuller, and wonderful. I used them as the buns for phili steack sandwhiches, and it held the filling in very nicely, and broiled to a gorgeous golden brown; it even worked as a good lunch the next day. I took the advice to shorten the flour to 5 cups, which I think was good, as it seemed like anymore would  just be too much. Other than that I followed the recipe. I didnt find it bland like a lot of ppl complained about, but then again I used it as sanwhich bread, not as a stand alone.The only mistake I made- which didnt seem to impact it too much, but was just annoyng- was that I tried to brush all of the egg white mixture during the first phase of burshing the bread, when I realized later down the recipe that it was suppose to spread for two sessions of brushing. I guess that could have been avoided by reading the instructions more thoroughly first, but for anyone else who might want a heads up, it might help! :)

I made this French Bread for hundreds of people last summer at summer camp. It was a huge hit! Easy to make and I only had to make a few adjustments to compensate for the large batches made. I upped the yeast and salt as well as proofed the yeast in warm water and sugar first. I also had to reduce the amount of flour but that was good for my budget!   I served this with spaghetti or stew and it was usually the first thing to go when everyone came back for 2nd's!   *note* I did notice that the thicker the dough was, the chewier it was if you didn't add extra proofing time! Some people loved it chewey, others thought it was weird. Either way, it disappeared really fast!

My mom is an expert bread baker, so the bar is set high.  I have always had so-so results and have never been excited about my bread... until I tried this recipe.  It was perfect! Crispy crust and such a light and airy center... I was literally amazed it came out of my oven.  I did proof my yeast with honey for about 15 minutes, and added probably a TBSP of salt, and only needed about 4.5 cups of flour (bread is kind of about how the dough "feels" so you may need more or less).  This is a definite keeper (coming from someone who has tried for 10 years to make a decent loaf ;)

I halved the recipes as a trial and used only 2.5 cups of flour plus some flour while kneading, and 1 tsp salt.  I left to double for an hour initially.  I don't have a dough attachment and simply mixed the dough in a bowl before kneading it.  I have never made bread before, and I found this dough quite easy to work with.  It also looked lovely coming out of the oven.  It was well received and I think had a nice texture, but unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations of french bread - the flavor and texture are not quite there.  I reviewed the Julia Child recipe for French bread and it seems that a longer doubling time may help to make the dough more airy, which I think is important.  I will probably make again with a longer rise time.

Didn't use egg wash because I thought it was unnecessary.  This recipe is very forgiving, I was off the day I made this because I halved the recipe, but forgot to half the water so I had to add a bunch of extra flour to make it not sticky but it still turned out perfect.  Made two large loaves even though I only used 1 package of yeast and less than 6 cups of flour.  Put ice cubes in the oven with the bread to make crust crunchy like other reviewers suggested.  My husband and I ate one loaf for dinner two nights ago and used the other to make French Toast Casserole(also on this site) tonight for dinner, was awesome both ways.

Like other reviews have said, the original recipe is on the bland side.    I prepared the yeast in a bowl with the water & let it soak for a minute or two while I set up my stand mixer.    I used two tea spoons of salt -- but I would probably use more.  I also used a tablespoon of melted butter.  Instead of using a wooden spoon, I went ahead and did all of the mixing in my stand mixer, you just have to occasionally scrape off the dough hook.  I might try using the hook to knead the dough next time, but I actually like the therapy of kneading the dough myself.   The dough rose quickly -- but I had turned my oven on to the lowest temp at the start of my prep & turned it off before kneading the dough. Since it was chilly, I let the dough rise in the warmed oven.  When the loaves needed to rise, I left them on the stove while the oven heated.    It was very nice to have the smell of baking bread in the house, everyone's been eating the bread up!!!  I'll definitely be making this recipe weekly, unless I get a good sourdough starter started :)

Delicious!!  Made half the recipe using 2 to 2 1/2 cups of flour, just enough to make a soft and firm dough.  At the suggestion of others, I added 1 T of soft butter and 2 T of sugar. Brushed loafs with melted butter instead of egg white. Baked two medium size loafs for 25 minutes at 350 degrees. I never thought that homemade french bread could be so easy.

Can't give the recipe a 5 just for the fact that I had to tweak it a bit:  I used only 5 c. of flour (thus, the bread is not so dense as some reviewers have said).  I added a little sugar (2 tsp.) so the yeast will rise better and also for taste.

This is so easy and so good.  I only make half the recipe at a time because there are only 2 of us to eat it.  After the first rise, I divide the dough in 2 and form 2 smaller loaves.  One is allowed to rise again and is baked, the other I wrap well and refrigerate for fresh bread tomorrow.  I do not use the egg wash.  Instead I put a pan of water in the bottom of the oven and let the steam form the crusty top.  Great recipe, thanks Pam 3 Boys Mama for suggesting it.

As listed, this is basically a double recipe so you can simply cut it in half and use 1 pk yeast.  What would you do with a partial package of yeast that is leftover, probably just throw it out?  1C water/1pk yeast/~3C flour + other items will work just fine.  Bread making is more art than science.  If using your stand mixer, proof yeast/water & 1/2C flour, then reserve 1C of flour and add the rest.  Continue adding flour until mixture is no longer sticky.  I find that letting rise 'until doubled in size' is the way to make bread, since dough will rise faster in a warmer summertime enviroment than the middle of winter.  How many loaves you get will depend on how much the dough rises and how large you make each one.

Very chewy, delicious bread! I used only 5 cups of flour and increased the salt to one Tablespoon after reading previous reviews. I also added the yeast to the water and added a shot of honey to it. Let mixture set a few minutes to soften the yeast. Also, brush with egg white alone with no water added and cut lines in loaves immediately so you don't have to disturb them after they have risen.  Best the first day, the next it is far too heavy for my liking. Use leftovers to make your own bread crumbs or croutons and store them in the freezer. Just slice the bread (thicker for croutons, thinner for crumbs) and butter or brush with olive oil and your seasonings of choice. Cut into cubes for croutons or leave slices whole for bread crumbs. Put on a cookie sheet and bake at 375 until toasty brown. Place cooled bread in blender or food processor for crumbs. Croutons are delicious the next day on top of soup. I am going to try this one next time for french onion soup. The bread would hold up very well on top of the individual bowls and topped with swiss or provolone and toasted under the broiler. Yummy!

This was my first time making bread and it turned out great.  I've since tweaked the recipe a bit and now it's totally perfect.  My changes are 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt and using a whole egg for the wash instead of just the white.  I also split the dough into 4 loafs instead of 2.  PERFECTION!  Thanks for posting this.  I now have to make bread for myself, my husband, and his parents who are incredibly picky!  Hopefully Santa will bring me a stand mixer for X-mas.  In the meantime I'm gaining major upper body strength from making all this bread by hand, lol.

I am finally able to bake good bread, because of this recipe. I usually don't bother with the egg wash when I make it for sandwich bread, but if I'm going to set it out and want it to look prettier, the egg wash is nice.

SO GOOD! I changed a few things or else i would give it 5 stars hands down. I halved the recipe, used half a cup less flour in the end-- so just 2 and a half cups white flour. Added a pinch more yeast as someone else advised. But then I still made two loafs- almost the length of an medium sized cookie sheet. So I had plenty for just the two of us here, which is good! We have almost eaten a loaf before dinner! Definatly recomend trying this recipe

I made these French loaves today in my bread machine.  I let the bread machine mix the ingredients and then I removed the dough and put it into a 4 QT glass bowl and let it rise in my warm oven for 1 hr.  Brushed melted butter and garlic powder before I rolled it into a loaf and added the egg wash twice as stated in the recipe. It turned out with a crispy crust and soft inside.  There is only 1/2 loaf left this evening-so AWESOME.  Thx for sharing this easy recipe.

This is so yummy! I made it last night and followed the directions exactly. The only problem was that I didn't have a baking sheet long enough for my loaves, so I ended up just putting them on the oven rack covered in foil with a sheet of parchment paper on top (instead of greasing/cornmealing a cookie sheet). Very good bread! Definitely a keeper recipe.

My bread came out heavy. The crust on it was hard as a rock. It tasted very good though. I will try it again, maybe I did something wrong. Very good

This was good!!! I followed someones suggestion and used the yolk of the egg and some milk to brush on...this made the outside really hard. I will make this again, but I will try something else, as I like crispier outside but not hard. I like it like the store bakeries make them. I didnt think this tasted like that.

I got lots of compliments on this bread...and it looked beautiful too!  I used 5 teaspoons of yeast and a cup less flour.  I also added some garlic and onion powder and a tablespoon of butter in the dough...gave it a good flavor.  Next time I may make 4 smaller, thinner loaves...more like baguettes.

Great bread recipe.  I used the rapid rise yeast which cut the rise time in half (or more).  Also, adding a touch of sugar does help it rise.  I agree with the others who commented that this recipe does need quite a bit more salt and possibly a little butter for taste.  Even my husband, who does little/no baking tasted the bread and commented that it needs salt.  Awesome recipe that needs a few tweaks for taste!

I made this for my husband who loves French bread..he thought the crust was great..it had that crusty exterior indicative of French bread, but the inside was too dense..it should have been lighter..maybe I should have used less flour (?)..I managed to work 5.5 cups of the flour in..maybe I did something else wrong..I'm not an experienced baker.  Thanks for sharing.

This was really good.  Because there wasn't any sugar it took a little bit longer to rise, but that's ok,  I had the time.  I have made this at least a dozen times and have had excellent results everytime.  When I don't have time I turn to a recipe with a little bit of sugar,  but I prefer this method!

I've had "traditional bread" in France, and this is not it - but it's still darn good.

I too added a pan of water to the bottom rack of my oven while it cooked, and poured some melted butter over the top of the bread as it came out of the oven. I am glad I added the 1 tbsp. of salt as directed by a previous reviewer because without it it would have been too bland.

My husband loved it. I will make it again.

This is a great recipe!! I cut back on the flour (5 cups), and it worked beautiful.  My husband has requested that I make it every week, and I do. Just like the French bread we used to get at our bakery..crunchy crust and dense inside.

I made half the recipe because I only wanted 1 loaf and I substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour and it still came out great.  I'm new at baking bread and my husband was really impressed with the loaf.  He thought I bought it from the store.  It really tasted great!!!

be careful not to add too much salt, that is used to slow the growth of yeast. you should let yeast grow in warm water , before adding to batch. do not let the salt and yeast come in direct contact with each other.kill the yeast. 38 year exp baker

This is the first French bread I've made and it was perfect. If you follow the directions exactly it will turn out.  If this is your first attempt with bread, make sure the dough feels like play-dough.  Getting the dough:water ratio is what it all comes down to.  You don't want it too stiff or too runny. It should hold its shape and be easy to play with.  Don't worry if you have to add more flour.  You gotta feel it out, watch a youtube video if you're not confident. 

Tips:
I let mine rise on top of our cast iron heater.  (you want warmth not heat) 

I sprinkled some mixed herbs on top (lavender/rosemary/etc) and would definitely recommend that. 

Also I used HONEY as a substitute for egg whites before putting it in the oven!!!  It makes the crust golden and crunchy and also adds some natural sweetness. Yummmm

The bottom was a bit soft so next time I'll use a thinner cookie sheet.

For all those who thought this was bland and too dense and crusty: This is traditional French bread, how it's made in France. What we are used to buying here in America is actually Italian bread...soft and moist with sugar and oil in it. So if you're looking for a homemade alternative to buying, this is NOT it. If you want REAL French bread, look no further.

Excellent recipe!!! I proofed the yeast with a 1/4 tsp of sugar first for 7 minutes, then added the flour and salt, the salt I increased as suggested to 1 1/2 tsp and I cut back on the flour like other reviewers, proably about 5 1/4 cup. The best bit of advice that I learned in a baking class is to not add more flour as you knead. If you keep kneading through the sticky phase the dough will eventually relax and the moisture will balance out. If you keep adding flour when it gets sticky the cycle never stops and you end up with a heavy, dense and not very pleasing loaf. Get a dough scraper to help you scrape it off the counter while it is in the sticky phase, and keep kneading until you pass the "window pane" test - where you can stretch the dough without it breaking and light shines through - then it's been kneaded enough. If it breaks before it's that thin, keep kneading. I followed what I learned from the professional baker with this recipe and it turned out fanstastic. I also baked it on a pizza stone and dumpbed a cup of water into a pan on the bottom rack while it baked to increase the humidity in the oven.

Thanks to the reviewers who suggested only 5 cups of flour.  That was plenty.  Flour is fine; don't buy cornmeal especially for this.  Also thanks to those who suggested scoring the loaves before the second rise.

Didn't change a single thing in this recipe and the bread turned out perfect.  Nice crispy crust and chewy center.  1/2 a loaf was gone within minutes of being pulled from the oven.  Served with real butter and farm fresh honey.  Awesome!

I made it as written and other than thinking it needed a bit more salt for flavor I really liked it. The texture was perfect. The density was exactly like French bread should be. Adding real unsalted butter to a fresh slice made it even more perfect.

I followed a suggestion by another reviewer and let the yeast sit in the warm water with a tbsp of honey for 15 minutes before following the rest of the recipe. Turned out delicious!

Followed other user comments and added 1Tbsp of sugar while proofing the yeast, then added 2tsp of salt and only 5 cups of flour.  Managed to make 2 very large and very tasty loaves.  I added some shredded asiago to one of the loaves after 20 minutes of baking and it was fantastic!  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

New French bread recipe! My husband made this and was his first time making bread, it turned out GREAT! Was alittle dense but that can be due to cooks error! Took the other loaf to work and was asked were I bought the fantastic French bread at! Thank you for a great recipe!

This produced an amazing bread!  The outside was crisp, the loaf had a hollow sound when tapped.  The inside was soft (not moist) and chewy.  I have made this several times with all sorts of herb combinations, dried veggies and everything added.  It comes out PERFECT every time!

I never review unless I really like a recipe- and I REALLY like this recipe. My family eats only homemade bread- and this is my staple recipe now. I use a double baguette pan, so thus omit the cornmeal, and if I am feeling really decadent I first proof the yeast with a few tablespoons of honey, and then I add a half a stick of melted butter.   That said- this is truly a recipe, as is, for real french bread and it is absolutely perfect. Thank you so much for sharing!

Really good, easy recipe! I increased the salt and added 1 T sugar as others have suggested. The crunchy crust is the best part, very good with pot roast.

My family are enjoying a loaf of this delicious bread right now, after we all enjoyed the first nibbles when it came out of the oven. I must admit, I tried this recipe last year and it was too dense for our liking. My husband recently bought me 'French Bread Flour' and WOW what a difference the flour makes. The bread is perfect. I took others suggestions to cut the slits in the dough before the 2nd rise, and I never cover my bread with cling film when it's rising....I just spray it with a light coating of oil. This way I don't have the troubles of deflated dense bread.

This bread is amazing! After reading comments,  I decided to proof the yeast first with a teaspoon of sugar. I also decreased the flour by one cup. The crust was perfect! This is a keeper!

I added 1/4 tsp more salt as others suggested, made and compared it to Liz Langston Recipe from this site on the same day using same amount of yeast for both (2 pkgs.).  This one was excellent  in taste, the other not as good (this one crust crunchier -I threw ice cubes in oven for both recipes, as some suggested, and flavor here better than my favorite bakery texture overall was better with this one) Have to say jenn's recipe a little harder to mix as I don't have a kitchen aid machine. Her dough seemed heavier but hands down the family picked it "Blind taste test"!!! This is my french bread recipe from now on!!!!

Nice, chewy inside with a gorgeous golden crust! Can't wait to use it for Bruschetta! Only used 5 cups of flour...and I threw a few ice cubes in the oven after about 15 minutes.

I made this last night on a whim, and it came out just perfect.  I did a half recipe, using 3c flour and 1 package of yeast.  This made two small baguettes.  The tops were a lovely golden brown and center was slightly chewy as advertised.  My husband said that this was as good as the fresh bread at our favorite Italian restaurant.  He was quite impressed.  Thanks for the recipe.

Really nice. This was my first successful yeast bread. I didn't have a bread machine, so I proofed the yeast in warm water with a tspn of sugar and kneaded for about 15 min by hand. I halved the recipe because I didn't need so much bread, and it was fine. I ended up using about 2 and 3/4 cup of flour. I doubled the amount of salt as some others suggested. I didn't use melted butter because I hadn't seen those reviews yet, but I may use it the next time just to see what everyone else is talking about. I don't eat eggs so I sprayed olive oil on the bread to get it crunchy. I also kept a pan of hot water in the oven while the bread was cooking, at that helped it to get nice and crunchy too. My bread took 40 min at 375. Well, it may have been somewhere between 350 and 375. Nice bread. Thanks a lot!

I followed this recipe exactly and was deeply disappointed with the results.  This is not French bread;  it's average white bread with a hard crust, a dense, boring center and an incredibly yeasty flavor.  I wanted something less time-intensive than the Julia Child recipe I usually use, but this wasn't even worth the few hours I had to put into it.  2 stars because it's better than store bought.

I proofed my yeast in warm water with a T of honey, as that's how many bread from scratch recipes suggest.  I also only added enough flour as needed to make elastic.  I would def reccomend increasing the salt like others suggest, i don't like salty, but it needs about 1/4-1/2 tsp more.  I would also only brush the top of the bread once with egg white, as it gave it too much of an eggy flavor twice; maybe alternate with butter instead.  I covered with aluminum foil for the last 15 min to prevent overbowning as well.  Great bread and amazing fresh.  These make BIG loaves!

This was pretty good. I let it rise for way too long before the last step, so it became too flat, but the taste was really good. I used just 5 cups of flour and five tsp of dry yeast. I ended up using it for Cajun Bread Pudding recipe on the site.

We really liked this bread. Sliced well. Nice and chewy. Especially good warmed up in the microwave with a little butter spread on it. The only thing I did different was to do it all by hand (no KA mixer) and I omitted the second application of egg wash. I didn't want the outside to be too crunchy. Thanks for recommending this one, Mominator!

I made a version of this yesterday and it turned out to be the best French bread I have ever eaten.  I changed it a bit. After looking atother recipes, I added 2 tablespoons of sugar to the dough. I also just mixed everything together all at once in the mixing bowl.  I basted the bread with the egg wash before I baked it and then again after the first 15 minutes of baking. This bread turned out to be dense but very soft and with a nice texture.  I will defintely be making it again.

Very easy to make, added a little more salt and yeast....Also I used my kitchen aid mixer for all the mixing...Took out and kneaded on a floured board....

this was a good bread, but very bland..needed more salt.  Also, it was too dense...will add more yeast next time.

Excellent! I changed it to be even more simple. Instead of all-purpose flour I used 5 cups bread flour, Increased salt to 2t., no cornmeal, no eggwash.  Followed instructions but divided into 4 loaves baked it on a pizza stone on 450 degrees until golden brown.

Clearly you can add me to the "must have done something wrong" list.  I've made bread before and NEVER had results this bad.  My bread isn't even out of the oven yet and I knew before I even put it in that this was going to be a bust.  It rose nicely up until the end and then it went flat.  I even cut it prior to rising the last time as a reviewer mentioned.  I think I'll stick to Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day.  At least then I knew my less than thrilling result (but nowhere near as bad as this) was due to improper handling of the dough.

Excellent recipe! It makes 3 large loaves, I normally roll mine flat put different fillings (fresh herbs, garlic, olives, cheese, bacon) on it before I roll it into a loaf.

What a fantastic recipe! I did follow what others had done like add extra salt, cut back on the flour, and proofed the yeast in a couple of tsp of sugar. This was the second time I made French bread and it is by far the better recipe. I don't think I'll ever buy French bread again. The only mistake I made was falling asleep and forgetting to put the bread on the cooling rack! It's the pits to get OLD!!!

I used this recipe as the base for the first french loaf I've ever made and it turned out better than I even expected. I did use half wheat flour, and a bit extra yeast after reading some of the reviews,and the result was a very beautiful, tasty bread.

My husband said "Better than the bakery!"  I did most of the work in the mixer bowl (didn't incorporate flour with the wooden spoon), and I only used 5 cups of flour.  Worked great, and we'll definitely be making this again!

Was too dense and too salty. I ended up using 5 1/4c flour. Did not change the other ingredients. However, the bread just had a salty taste. The crust was crunchy though. Have to give credit for that.

I've made this several times now.  I haven't done the egg wash at all, and the first time I tried to cut into the bread as the recipe says, it started to fall, so I gave up (I used a very sharp, pointed knife, so that wasn't the problem).  Regardless it has always come out well.  A double batch lasts less than a week at my house, my husband and daughter can't get enough.  We frequently mix up an olive oil 'dip' to eat this with.  I don't follow the directions exactly; I proof the yeast in the water with a bit of agave nectar or honey (we don't use sugar), then stir in the salt and flour.  I don't measure the flour; I just stir it and knead it until it feels right.  I have done this with whole wheat and spelt flours as well.  For a coarser whole wheat flour, I use about half wheat/half white.  For a finer ground whole wheat, I use only that.  It is a bit heavier so I add a little more yeast to compensate (I always buy loose yeast so it's no big deal to measure).  It rises well, bakes well, tastes great.  It doesn't keep quite as well as I'd like but I think that's a lack of preservatives.  Honey should help that some.  Freezing works well too.  We have also used this bread to make homemade croutons out of, it is also good for that.

This was wonderful and I'll be making it again.  The only thing I did was add 1/2 tsp more salt.  The only kind of french bread that I like is dense, that is part of its appeal for me.  The dough does look a bit tough to start with, however it gets through that stage and rises and bakes beautifully.

This is such great bread!  I've been looking for a simple French Bread recipe for a while - one that didn't take strange ingredients or equipment and didn't take a ton of time.  This bread was easy and SO good.

This is a great recipe! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I changed it slightly by taking the suggestion of several previous reviewers and added more salt, and proofed the yeast with the water and some honey prior to adding it to the flour. I also sprayed the inside of the oven with water every 10 min or so to make the crust extra crispy, as I have read elsewhere. It seemed to work! Enjoy this one:)

Wow! This was my first attempt at making bread. I was really nervous and read alot of reviews. My loaves didn't look pretty, but they sure tasted heavenly! On one of the loaves I brushed it with olive oil and minced garlic before I rolled it up. The other I spread with cinnamon,sugar and butter. YUMMY!

This recipe produces a french bread that is extremely dense. I followed the directions exactly and was very disappointed with the outcome.  Very very chewy and thick.  Will not make again.

This french bread recipe was good, however it came out way too dense for my taste. I was looking for a lighter texture. I will definitely make this again, but cut back on the flour for sure.

Great recipe.  The bread came out a bit on the bland side - I would recommend adding more salt and butter to the recipe.  I did not use all of the flour recommended.  I would suggest adding it little by little as many environmental factors can influence how much flour your dough will need.

Following the recipe exactly, it's always great! Usually we scale it down for only one loaf and have no problems. I think the sesame seeds would be a good addition as suggested by another reviewer. I would like to try to replace half the flour with whole wheat but haven't yet.

Yum! To avoid bread that can be pulled apart like a cinnomon roll, lightly coat the top side of the dough with water before rolling it into a loaf. Let the bread rise for a long time on the sheet and you'll get delicious french style bread!  Thanks for the recipe!

Just trying some new bread recipes and stumbled upon this one.  I bake a LOT of bread so I honestly didn't expect to find anything new but this is the BEST french bread my family has ever had.  Yes, I put swapped out some of the water for milk and butter and added a little salt but left it alone other than that.  The crust is the perfect thin, crunchy crust that french bread is supposed to have while the inside is dense but light and chewy.  Actually throwing out my own french bread recipe in favor of this one.

I'm continue to have a problem making yeast breads!  I read most of the reviews to get pointers.  I also made sure to have the right yeast.  I followed the recipe as stated but did start the mixing using my kitchen aid.  I only needed 5 cups of flour and kneaded the dough 5 minutes.  First rise was good. I divided the dough into 3 small loaves but the 2nd rise really didn't happen (was in a warm place).  Maybe I rolled the dough to thin or too tight?? I was not happy with the result of the cooked product.  Only one loaf even looked like french bread and the taste was slighty dense and not light.

This is a great recipe for French bread.  I have made it several times now and I love it.  This recipe yielded 2 very large loaves.  I froze one of the loaves and it was just as good after heating in the oven.  Great recipe!

This is my favorite recipe by far, period.  It's so easy to make, love that it only has 4 ingredients in the bread.  I make it 1-2 times a week, and we never tire of it.  It seems to raise really quickly as well, which I love!

I made this recipe twice in the past two days I love it so much! It makes a wonderfully crispy crust with a great, chewy center. 
The only problem I had was getting all 6 cups of flour into the dough. I just didn't feel comfortable adding more flour after 10 minutes or so of kneading. I could've been there all day kneading if I wanted all of the flour in there. But the loaves turned out great so I guess it wasn't a huge problem!
I would suggest this recipe for anyone who is a beginner. It is a very easy to follow recipe and everyone loves it!

Wow!  I've been craving French Bread and had never made it before so I decided to try.  This was absolutely delicious.  I read some comments so used an extra pinch of yeast, 1 less cup of flour and didn't mix water with the egg white.  It turned out perfect.  It's so good and I'm so proud :)

Great recipe!  We made this bread after failing with a few other recipes.  It was really good, better than any grocery store baguette, but maybe not quite as good as a fancy bakery.  USE KING ARTHUR FLOUR--the regular stuff wasn't as good.

Great bread, but only used 5 c. flour. I made it in the bread machine to dough stage, then baked on cookie sheet.

I also omitted one cup using 5 cups of flour and it was still a very dense bread...but it is delicious. I'm definitely keeping this recipe.

I've tried many french bread recipes in the past and this by far is the easiest to make.  THe end result for me was a nice crispy outer crust with a nice chewy inside.

Thanks

I read some suggestions, then made the bread. Halved the recipe and used one package of yeast, and put in a tablespoon of salt. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out great!!! The egg whites make for a REALLY nice crust. That night we all had dreams about french bread.

Not too bad.  The family loved it, but it was a little bit too dense for my taste.  Makes great french toast!  

Update:  I must have misread the recipe the first time made this wonderful bread.  I've made it several times since I first reviewed it, and it has been perfect every time.  I'm changing my rating from 3 stars to 5.

I just got my factory refurb Kitchenaid Artisan mixer and decided to test drive it with this recipe. It came out very good considering this was my first attempt at bread of any kind. Here are a couple of observations/questions:
The recipe calls for too much flour (sort of) It says 6 cups, but really if you read it, it says add flour until the dough is elastic. That was a judgement call and I suppose part of the fun of doing it yourself.
The first rise of the dough went fine (I put it in my dehydrator set to 100 degrees to rise). After forming the loaves, I let it sit for 40 minutes and when I tried to slice the tops, it seems like the loaves deflated a bit. When the bread was done, it appeared to be a bit "flat". Maybe I needed to let it rise some more.
The cooking time did not lead to a "golden" loaf. 30 minutes after the second application of egg white it was still not brown. So I turned the oven up to 400 and baked it an addtitional 15 or 20 minutes. The loaves appeared done at that point with a nice hard crust and moist chewy center. 
My question is, the recipe refers to doing a "bread test". What exactly is that?

Thanks

This recipe was extremely easy to follow.  Although it had quite a few steps, the bread turned out so good!  The crust on the outside was shiny, the inside wasn't dry at all.  This bread was delicious!

With the exception of baking on quarry tiles instead of a baking sheet, I followed the directions exactly and was pleased with the results.  The bread turns out similar to grocery store French bread but has better flavor and texture.

Many raters have noted that 5c. flour is sufficient and I agree.  Many have also noted that the flavor is yeasty, and I agree with this too.  Next time I'll use a little less yeast or let rise for a shorter period of time.

I created two loaves about 20 inches long and they did not fit my quarry tiles.  Next time I'll make three shorter loaves.

Super easy and super delicious. Allow plenty of time for the dough to rise if you want an airy, light texture on the inside. Or follow the directions and just let the dough rise for 40-50 minutes each time and you'll have a denser moister interior.

if i could i would give this six stars! its so amazingly delicious, and has next to no fat, and tastes great with jam or cheese or whatever you want! As I was making it, I was thinking it would never taste as good as real french bread, but i was wrong. YUMMY!!!!!!! And the fact that my family scarfed it down in less than a day is probably a good sign! :D

Excellent!!! This was my first attempt at French bread, and it's wonderful.
I had a hard time with shaping the loaf, but the bread itself was great, and I'll make this over and over again.

Thank You Jenn

It is a good "chewy on the inside", "crispy on the outside" baguette.  Not the best I've ever had, but probably the best I've made and easy too!  I like mine with a bit more salt, which I'll probably do next time.

Wow!  What a great loaf of french bread!  I used my bread machine on the dough cycle and substituted rapid rise yeast (6 teaspoons) for the active dry yeast and it turned out great.  My husband keeps asking for me to make it again and again!  Definitely a keeper!

Fantastic texture, nice crispy crust even without all the spraying water during baking that other recipes call for! My bread tasted a little yeasty, but I may have let it rise too long anyway. Will definitely make again. Also, egg substitute works just fine instead of egg white...

This bread was absolutely delicious! I cut the recipe in half and put it in the bread machine for the first rising. Then I punched it down, let it rest, and then rolled it out into a rectangle, etc. To me the end product looked a lot harder to make than it really was. My husband was very impressed. I will make this recipe again and again.

Reaaly good bread, I think it's best the same day. I also wrapped it in a damp towel right after it came out of the oven for about a half hour to make the crust chewy too. very good

Fabulous!!!  Just turned out wonderful and my whole family told me this was the best French Bread I had made.  I used bulk yeast - 2 1/2 Tablespoons and it didn't taste too yeasty at all.  I'm not sure the rolling makes a heck of a difference so I'm going to try just shaping next time.  Very good recipe!  Thanks for sharing it with us!!!

Because I'm baking at sea level, I reduce the flour to 5 cups, working in the last cup as I knead the dough. My family loves this recipe, and I make it nearly once a week.

This bread did not turn out for me despite following the directions very closely.  It was okay to eat right away with a meal, but the leftovers were like little rocks.  I've had better flavor before and will keep looking.  The loaf made good bread crumbs when dried and chopped though.

I followed this recipe to the T and had HORRID results!  The bread was way too dense and didn't rise enough even after doubling the rise time in a very warm area.  I have to say, I'm experienced when it comes to bread, and have tried several variations of bread recipes on this site, but this was THE worst.  There's nothing better than hot french bread, so I was really looking forward to trying this recipe.  I'll stick to picking up a hot loaf of french bread from the grocery store!  It's a whole lot easier and you know you'll get good results.

I found this bread much too salty and the crust wasn't very crispy. But I do think there is a bakery in town that uses the same recipe...

I found this bread very quick and easy to make.  And, wow!  Did it ever turn out great!  I've never made french bread before, and it was way better than the stuff you buy in the store!  The only problem was trying to keep the loaves for more than a day!  They get eaten right from the oven!  Fabulous recipe!

My family loved this bread!  It tastes like breads baked in a stone oven.  I also add pesto to one of the loaves to make pesto bread, it turned out great as well.

Excellent recipe! Made two loaves today and they turned out perfect! I made adjustments based on other reviewers' suggestions. I used 5 cups of flour and two packets of yeast. I increased the salt a bit and added some sugar. Instead of kneading by hand, I used the dough hook attachment on our Kitchenaid for 10 minutes. After shaping the loaves I cut the diagonal slices and then let rise under a damp towel. I didn't use egg wash, just water. When baking I also had a pan of water on the bottom rack. This is a fantastic recipe and with some tweaks it is easy to customize to your specific taste. Thank you for posting...I'll definitely be using this recipe going forward!

I've made this recipe about 5 times now and this last time was the first time I've made a few changes. The original recipe is good but I've been baking a lot lately and have learned a few tricks. I added a touch more salt, 1 tbsp butter and most importantly I used gluten. If you substitute 1 tbsp per cup of AP flour you get a version of bread flour. This makes the bread nice and chewy. Bob's Red Mill makes a wonderful kind.

This was my first attempt at french bread and it turned out perfect! I make bread monthly, so I was happy to read other reviewers  pointers and took those all into consideration. When it came to the yeast , the recipe said 2 1/2 pkgs, I didn't want to try and half that little pkg so I used it all (3 pkgs). After reading the reviews about the flour I decided to measure out all 6 cups in a separate bowl, using  2 cups to start and then with the 4 cups left over, stir in what I could and then knead in some more until consistency felt right. Like another reviewer said there was flour leftover. I let mine rise for a 1 + 1/2 hrs. This recipe did make 2 good size loaves. When my loaves cooled my end use for this was garlic bread. I got the garlic bread recipe from Brown Eyed Baker posted February 2015 Delicious!

I followed the recipe and mixed all together in my Bosch. I put in 5 cups of flour expecting to add the last cup gradually. I had a big, dry mess. I added a little more water and turned on my mixer, figuring it could beat it in to shape. I mixed it on the highest settings for nearly 10 minutes. It seemed moist enough, just a bit clumpy. Anyway, at that point it looked questionable but worth a try. It rose well and my loaves looked nice. I had a line to taste it but I was still a little concerned. Well, it was fantastic! I could have eaten a full loaf!! Next time, I'll add more salt and will put in 4 cups of flour then add more gradually. (Way to go Bosch! My old Kitchen Aid could never have pulled together this particular job.)

Very good! I took the advice of some other reviewers and used 5 cups of flour, added a little sugar and increased the salt to about a tble spoon. It had a nice crunchy crust and soft, chewy inside.

Crusty on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Very easy to make.  Baker's note: I used hot wheat cereal (e.g. Cream of Wheat) instead of cornmeal & it was perfect.  Our family devoured it straight out of the oven.

I bake bread every weekend because two family members have food allergies. I frequently try different recipes and happened upon this one. I'm so happy to finally have a great French bread recipe! This bread turned out beautifully with a crisp crust and soft chewy center.  It's delicious. My kids asked me to make it again this weekend. I did make a couple changes: I proofed my yeast with about 2tsps of sugar for 10 minutes before adding any flour and added about 1/2 tsp more salt. This is definitely my go-to recipe for French bread!

Excellent, doubled the salt as suggested and added a tablespoon of sugar and it was perfect. Thank You!!!!
Made this again yesterday and per another reviewer I didn't want the crust too hard so after  20 mins, instead of a second egg brush I brushed the top and sides with melted butter. Came out perfect!

I followed the recipe exactly except I cut in half and made only one loaf and I added the entire amount of salt despite halving the recipe. I thought my dough was too dry and it didn't become as smooth and elastic as I thought it should have. I was a little worried. The end result was really good though, nice flavor and a crunchy exterior without a bread stone or spritzing with water.  Next time I won't roll out the dough into a large rectangle and jelly roll it into a loaf. My loaf stayed jelly rolled on the inside, it didn't become a proper loaf. I recommend you roll and stretch  the dough ball into shape by hand on the board.

Made this bread last night and it looked wonderful! Though I was a bit worried because it was super hard on the outside. I was preparing for it to be a lost due to it being a brick, but once we cut into the hard crust it had a soft inside. As for taste it didn't have much. :( It was very bland. Perhaps more salt in the recipe? Not sure if I will be making this bread again. If I do I will take a couple of reviewers suggestions, including putting a tablespoon of salt instead of the 1 1/2 teaspoons. Going to give recipe 3 stars because taste is very important.

Tried it according to the original recipe and it came out very dense and bland as others stated. The second time, I ended up reducing the amount of flour, adding a little bit more salt and a TBS of butter. It came out a million times better. I brushed on melted butter as soon as they came out of the oven and it was a big hit at the dinner table.

Great recipe! I followed other reviewers and decreased the flour, used 2tsp of salt,1 tsp of sugar, and 1tbsp of butter. I threw everything in my KitchenAid, starting with 5 cups of flour, and I found I still needed a bit more water. All flour absorbs water differently, just start with less. I also used egg yolk because I like a a nice golden loaf. This made two large gorgeous loaves, thank you!

Mine came out wayyyy too dense.  I had better results with the 5 minute no knead bread recipe.  Guess I will continue to search for the perfect light n fluffy french bread loaf recipe :(

I read the reviews and took suggestions into consideration. I proofed my yeast with 1.5 tsp of sugar and the 2 cups of water for 8 minutes before adding 2 cups of flour. I also increased the salt to 1.5 tsp. I wound up only using 5 cups of flour which was all-purpose flour. This was my first time making french bread and it turned out great.  I ended up covering my loaves with foil after the first 20 minutes and only had to bake an extra 15 minutes. I am glad I added the sugar and extra salt because the flavour is perfect for me. I'll be making these again.

I've made this bread twice now.  My kids and Ex husband (hehe) love it!  I would add a bit more salt.  I put a pan of water on the shelf under the bread to make the crust crisper as well as sprayed the bread every 3 minutes for the first 12 minutes of baking.  The crust came out great!  I also slit the top before final rising.

I loved this recipe. However, I baked it on 425 for 15-20 minutes. I also used the entire egg. It was so good and I was so proud to show my family.

I am quite impressed with how this bread turned out!  I did use only five cups of flour based upon the consistency of the dough.  (The recipe does imply that you should only add flour until the dough cannot be stirred.)  Good work!

Well, I'm on my fifth try, 0-4 so far. Where I live in Asia, we don't have yeast packages and it looked like the recipe called for .25 oz total, so I used equivalent .1oz yeast/package. Ended up with 2 bricks. After I figured the .25 oz was per package, the second batch rose the size of a basketball. The first rise that is... After I punched it down and followed the rest of the recipe, it stayed down and didn't rise again, another set of bricks. Third batch, I went back to the store to get some other makes of both flour and yeast. Then realized all I get is INSTANT yeast here, not active dry yeast. So converted to instant yeast, a half batch to stop wasting flour, then forgot to rescale the ingredients and added twice the amount of salt, it actually deflated quite a bit after I put it in the oven and still really dense but somewhat usable (used some of it on the French onion soup as croutons and the rest for French Toasts this morning). I'm trying it once more, half batch, then I give up on this one. Don't have a problem with other types of breads, but this one is really testing my patience (and putting a serious dent on my ego...).

This was an amazing recipe. I read a couple of reviews, and added in a bit more yeast then it called for, and also an additional handful of sugar, to help the yeast along. It turned out fantastic. My whole family loved it. Moist and and crunchy.

This was the first time I ever made French bread and it came out wonderfully! I combined what other reviewers said and used:
5 c. flour
5 tsp. active dry yeast
2 tsp. salt
My boyfriend's exact words were, "this is heavenly" :)

I love this recipe......  The only thing I would add to hints is that I take a 9x13 pan and fill it with boiling water and put it on the bottom rack of the oven while baking.   The steam will give you a very nice crispy crust.

I really loved this. I am new to bread making. This was my fourth attempt in as many days (all with different recipes).  This was by far my favoitire.  I halved the recipe (yeilding one loaf) because I knew that it would be dangerous for me to home with two loaves of yummy bread :) I used only 1 pkg of yeast (half recipe calls for 1.25 pkgs).  I proofed the yeast in water with 1tbsp sugar.  I kneaded in my mixer with the bread hook.  Made cuts in loaf prior to the final rise (as suggested by many reviewers). I didn't have cornmeal, so skipped that step. I also didn't use egg mixture.  I just put a pan of water on the botton rack in the over and placed the loaf on a cookie sheet on the rack above.  I baked it for about 20 min at 375, then another 10 at 350 (because I am new to bread and was scared to over cook it but didn't want to over cook it).  I seriously can't beleive that I made this bread!  yummo!

I loved this bread and so did my family.  But I admit I changed it a little.  I proofed the yeast with a little sugar and only put in 4 cups of flour.  The last time I made bread,  6 cups was way too much.

This is a great recipe that can be used with bread flour or whole wheat flour. I use a pan of water on the bottom rack to add steam while baking the bread. Gives an awesome hard crust : )

This recipe came along just in time!  After blowing several batches of sourdough I was about to give up trying to teach my self to make a half decent loaf.  Enter this fantastic and easy recipe and I'm saved.  I did let the yeast bloom for a while, and used a little warmer than just "warm" water, more like 110 degrees.  And I swapped the egg white for a mister of water every 5 minutes.  The crust just comes out better that way.  Yes, egg makes it shiny.  But misting it and keeping the oven more like a real French kitchen makes a crust to die for.  Both changes are something I just learned yesterday.  Trust me...they work.

This was my choice for first bread making experience. This was a win-win, great taste, beautiful to look at and the smell in the kitchen was wonderful. Both loaves disappeared in 2 days-- just for eating with a couple of meals, french bread-french toast in the morning, and toasted bread tuna buns tonight. Great recipe--thanks

This is a great recipe.  I have made it twice.  Both times doing things that I shouldn't like rushing the second rise in a warm oven and it still turned out great.  I did proof the yeast as others recommended and added sugar when proofing.  Also, just added flour until I liked the consistency (probably about 5 cups).  Thank you so much for this recipe!

WOW! fabulous! I just made this for the first time. My family LOVES bread, and I have tried many recipes.....finally I have found "THE ONE" .I did the whole recipe by hand, not with a mixer. I added about a tsp more salt, tblsp. melted butter and only used  about 5 1/4 c. flour. Cant describe how wonderful this is.

Just perfect!  I halved the recipe (there are only 2 of us) and made the dough in my bread machine.  It's a super easy dough to work with and rose beautifully.  I topped it with sesame seeds before baking.  We both love it.  Served it with Classic Goulash.

This was great.  I read all reviews and used 5 cups of flour, and then at the end I brushed with the egg yolk and milk tip.  I then sliced and made for deer sausage brushettas.  So good, the bread was perfect.

I've never baked bread before (except for banana bread) and I'm happy to say that my first time was not a failure! Actually, it's very tasty! The only thing that I did differently was proof the yeast for about 5 minutes because I only had 2 packets of the yeast. This is a very forgiving recipe, too. I ended up using about 5 1/2 cups of flour, and no cornmeal (because I forgot). We also used a whole egg for the eggwash (because son wanted to learn to separate eggs and it didn't go so well).  Bread is still very edible after all the abuse we gave it, so 5 stars!

Do not make this if you are on a diet! I ate almost a half loaf myself with tons of butter, of course. I made all the suggested changes, more yeast and salt, less flour and it was wonderful. I baked mine in traditional loaf pans because I wanted sandwich bread. I think the bread will be gone before any sandwiches get made!

Simple and yummy. I reduced the flour to 5 1/2 cups. And I proofed the yeast with the water and a tsp of sugar and increased the salt a bit. But all of that is just a matter of trial and error. Great recipe.

This made the best French Bread! It was soft inside and crusty outside; not "dry" like some recipes I've tried in the past. My family wiped it out in no time flat! I will be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing.

My first time making bread on my own and this recipe was wonderful! I did up the salt to 2tsp as per a reviewer's recommendation, but I kept the amount of yeast the same (two and a half .25oz packets) and I rose my bread by placing in a large, ceramic, greased bowl, draping with plastic wrap and placing a steaming hot towel over the top. Both rises for me were about 40 mins. Bread was amazing, both loafs gone within 24 hours!!

Great recipe. But don't think you can just up and walk away. This bread needs alot of TLC. I had an extra loaf and gave 1 to our friends. I asked them how the bread was. Apparently, it never made it to the dinner table. Gobbled up at the kitchen counter while it was still hot. :)

Made this today, the bread is oh so yummy!!! I did add a little more salt than recipe stated just from what I read on the reviews. I also added 2 table spoons of butter. The results were great. One of the loaves never made it to dinner table. LOL

I have never had a problem making bread before, but this one turned to flat and solid! I didn't kill the yeast either. Everything was perfect right up until it went in the oven. Then, like it got in a fight with a steam roller... flat as a pancake.

This was my first time making bread with out my mother standing over my shoulder and it was a big hit with my family. It was easy. I did only use 5 1/2 cups or flour as suggested in some other reviews.

maybe its my flour, but following the instructions, and giving it more time to rise, clearly more than doubled, cooking it more than 40 mins, the bread still came out heavy and doughy and tasted like yeast.

I halved the recipe to make only one loaf, and it still worked out very well! (wish I would have made both now, though!!!) It is exactly what I was looking for... simple, traditional crusty bread. YUMMMMM!!!!!
The only thing I changed was adding a bit more salt...

I would give this 4.5 stars.  Part of why I wouldn't give it 5 is beacuse it still seemed a little too dense for french bread.  I did rush the rising a bit as I was running out of time to finish it.  I would definately try again and make sure it has all the rising time called for.  Great flavor.

I don't know what went wrong but my bread turned out really crusty, almost crack your teeth crusty. And very dense. I will attribute the dense to adding too much flour. I chose to mix the flour in using my Bosch, so I kept adding flour after the six cups thinking the dough should clean the bowl, I don't think that is the right way to make this bread I think I should have stopped with six cups. But I don't think this would have made the crust too crunchy I am wondering about the second egg wash during baking, I think maybe there were too many egg washes. I did an egg wash before letting the shaped loaves rise then again after they were risen and after cutting slits, then again 20 minutes into the baking. I think I will try the recipe again making some adjustments and see if it comes out better next time.

This is better than bread at a bakery! I've made it twice so far with a few changes. First, I bloom the yeast in warm water about 10 minutes before adding to the flour and salt. I add about five teaspoons of sugar to the yeast mixture to "fuel" the yeast. I added a little less than five cups of flour so that the dough will be on the "sticky" side but not sticking to the bottom to my Kitchen Aide. I let rise in a warm oven (turn oven on for a few minutes and then off and open door of the oven to cool off before putting bread in) and covering bread with a tea towel wet with warm water and wrung out. Roll out extra thin rectangle before rolling into loafs. Sprinkle a little kosher salt on the egg-white wash. Before heating your oven I added two Pyrex 13x9 baking dishes with water half way up the side on the bottom rack of the oven for steam. Be sure to be careful when opening up the oven because of the steam- it will give a rude awakening when opened if not careful (I open oven from the side). I baked about 35 min. total and put butter on the cooling loafs. Amazing!

This recipe was so easy to make! I followed the suggestion of others and reduced my flour by a half cup and added an extra half teaspoon of salt. This made 2 wonderful loaves and I'm using the leftovers to make a french bread breakfast casserole. Bravo Jenn, Thanks!!!

I ended up making half the recipe and it turned out beautifully. But it didn't taste like French Bread ... it tasted more like my mom's homemade Italian bread that she used to make when I was a kid (awe, the sweet memories that came back when I took that first bite). The bread was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I ended up making crostini by thinly slicing up the bread, toasting them, and adding different toppings like red and green pesto, gorgonzola cheese, salami, EVOO and garlic, etc. They made a simple and delicious appetizer! Thanks for sharing this recipe, Jenn! I will definitely be making this again!

Super easy for a person such as me who doesn't bake a lot. I did add a Tb of butter and tsp of salt as a previous reviewer suggested. His/her estimate of 5 t of yeast was right on as well. Yummy and great job of mopping up sauce from the lasagne I served with it!

Very delicious bread. I agree with other reviews that the bread is a little dense but it has a wonderful taste. I just made it for dinner and don't know if I can hold out from eating the rest of it until then!!!

I made today and it was pretty good.  I like the outside crust, esp. the bottom.  Mine spread out more than up and I would have liked it a little denser.  I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and did 5 cups of flour, 1 1/2 tsp salt, sugar and a little butter.  On the second rise with the damp towel the dough was stinking so I stuck it in a low over for about 10 mins.  I think I have problems making breads so I would definitely try this one again.

I have made this recipe 4 times, and I have loved it each time.  Anyone who has tried this bread also loves it. The bread bakes very well, and the crust is the perfect brown at the end of 35 minutes.  I often make the baguettes too thin and long so that they don't fit on my baking sheet.  Howver, the leftover makes a perfect mini loaf which bakes for half the time and works perfectly.  The bread also goes great with jam.

This was my very first bread recipe EVER and I must say I am very pleased with the result.  I read all the helpful suggestions before adjusting the ingredients to about 5 1/4 cups of flour and I proofed the yeast with honey.  I added extra salt, but I think it would have been better with the original 1 1/2 tsp rather than 2.  My kneading skills are non existent and what I know of t came from watching Little Women, the movie.  yet, I think I did phenomenally thanks to this great recipe.!

I made the French Bread and it was a big hit.  My  husband and sons could not wait for it to cool.  I served it with Lentil Soup.  There wasn't a crumb left.  I had to promise that I would make it again. My husband has been talking about it non stop.

This bread turned out fabulously on my first try. Though many people said to use 5 cups of flour, I ended up needing almost the whole 6. I did add an extra 1/2 tsp of salt (but I didn't measure). Also, I used my bread hook the WHOLE time and didn't bother hand mixing and kneading. The bread rose BEAUTIFULLY the first time, and not as much the second time. Didn't have eggs, so I didn't make a wash and it was still amazing looking. The bread was soft and tasty and I didn't think it was too dense at all. After it was done, I made garlic butter and spread it over the loaves. We ate 1/2 of a loaf and I froze the rest for later. Hope it "re-bakes" okay!

YUM!  I made this the first time exactly as the recipe stated (except that I used my KitchenAid to knead for 8 minutes rather than hand knead).  The loaf was good but denser and blander than I liked.  The second time, I used 5.5 cups of flour, sifted it and doubled the salt - those are the only changes I made.  Absolutely delicious!  Next time I'll likely use 2.5t salt as 3t was just a bit too much.

Since I discovered this recipe a couple of years ago (has it really been that long?), I have been making delicious loaves of bread. I often switch it up just a little bit by adding herbs, cheese, or some whole grains to the recipe. Yum! Thank you for posting this.

This is the first time that I've made a loaf of bread in years and also without using a bread machine - it was so easy! I proofed my yeast first with about a T. sugar and upped the salt by about a 1/4 tsp. Next time I make it I will probably experiment and reduce the flour slightly as the flour I use is an ultragrain flour (found at Costco and is a whole wheat blend) and it resulted in a very dense, albeit soft and tasty, bread. The 6 of us ate through the first loaf while it was still warm, will be saving the other one for tomorrow night's dinner.  All in all, a very good and simple recipe. Thanks!

Fantastic!  So easy to make, and this tasted and looked just like the french bread I've bought at specialty bakeries.  I followed one reviewer's suggestion of adding 1/2 tsp more salt and 1 Tbsp butter, as well as proofing my yeast with a tsp of sugar.  Otherwise, made exactly as directed and could not be happier!  This is definitely a dinner guest-worthy loaf of french bread, sure to please and impress.

I am extremely disappointed with this bread.  It came out flat, dense, and as hard as a baseball bat.  I wish that I'd spent my night a bit more productively.  Cleaning up the mess from this horrible failure was a total waste of time.

I am super excited! I found this recipe today & decided to try it. After reading all of the reviews, I made it with 5 1/4 c flour. I got 1 large loaf, and 2 smaller ones! And they are great! And the reason I'm this excited is that this is the first time I've ever made french bread! Way to go, Jenn! Thank you!

tasty, but crust was thick(which is good if you like that). i didnt mind but in combination with how dense the bread turned out it really hurt the bread. next time i am going to add more salt and activate the yeast prior to adding.

This is *the* best bread recipe I have tried on allrecipes so far.  I make it once a week!  Throw 2 ice cubes in at the beginning and again toward the end of baking for a wonderful crunchy crust.  Thanks to the person that suggested that, it really makes a difference!

My family and I loved this bread!  I'm the resident dessert baker, and am just starting to try my hand with breads...this one will be a staple in our house.  I couldn't believe I made French bread that was beautiful and flavorful enough to exceed what I can pick up at my local store.  My husband and kids made sure every crumb of the two loaves were eaten!   To reheat on the 2nd day after baking, I wrapped the loaf in foil and put it in a 350 oven for 10-15 minutes - perfection!

If anyone can botch a bread recipe it is me.  This was easy and actually rose, twice.  The killer is when I cut the top before baking.  The bread totally deflated.  Better to cut before rising the second time.  The taste and texture were good.

Let me start by saying that I totally butchered this recipe from the get-go.  It wasn't intentional, it was just a momentary lapse into "blonde world" from my ordinary brunette days...  First of all, I added all six cups of flour to my mixer, along with the salt and yeast.  After I added the 2 c. of water, I kept thinking "hmm this is awfully stiff!"  Oops.  So I added about 1/2 c. more water.  It was still rocking the mixer awfully hard and it just kept looking "not right," but I stuck to it and kneaded it in the mixer for about 8 min.  After I pulled the beater out, I realized I'd been trying to knead with the flat beater, not the dough hook.  Poor ol' Kitchen Aid.  It was TRYING to tell me.  Sigh.  From there on out, I followed directions.  Except for the egg wash.  No eggs!  I just brushed with butter whenever it said to brush with egg.  Despite my day of clumsy mistakes (other recipes suffered too...), this bread turned out light, fluffy, and totally delicious.  I'll make again and again!

Made this exactly as described and it came out very delicious.  BoyfriendGuy and I had several hot slices with Nutella on them and then ate more with my special Mediterranean chicken salad.  I will most definitely be making these again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I love this bread.  I had a previous favorite....that is no longer.  I used 5 cups of bread flour and 4 1/2 tsp of bread maker yeast...yes, I said bread maker yeast, I made it in the bread maker (till it rose too much, I pre heated the oven slightly and turned it off, anticipating that I would have to relocate the dough) I added 2 tsp of sugar as well.  I did not do the egg wash as I did not have any eggs, I used olive oil.  I read somewhere that if you put ice cubes in the oven while baking french bread, it will help crisp up the crust, I did this as well.  I will make this recipe again....with my mods:)  Love, love, love this bread.

This is the first bread product I've made that really tasted good! It wasn't too dense, it was nice and chewy on the inside with just a little bit of a crunchy outside. I made it to with "the worlds best lasagna" from this site and it was a fantastic meal! In the future, I am going to try to make my bread the day before a meal though so I don't have to worry about timing. This is a really good bread recipe- thank you!!

I have used this recipe for Pepperoni Bread (also on this site), with great results.  Tonight I shaped the dough into  seven mini-loaves of French bread, baked them for 12 minutes, split them and used them for BBQ beef sandwiches.  Way better than hoagie rolls, and easier to make, too.

Don't let all the instructions fool you. This bread is simple go prepare. Following others reviews I added less flour and more yeast. Also, it definitely needs more salt. Other than that it would have had 5 stars. It was easy and cheap to prepare. I served it fresh from the oven and it was polished off.

Enjoyed this it was my first time making homemade french bread.    I think I will get better the more I do it.  It did not turn out as nice as the picture but the taste was wonderful.

I'm not an experienced bread baker, but I was not crazy about the way this turned out. It was ok, but too dense for my taste.

Came out perfect without any modifications at all - except I omitted the cornmeal, I have a two year old so the fewer crumbs, the better!  Will definitely be keeping this recipe!

this recipe makes me feel like I can make french bread every weekend.  The first batch was so good, I made another one right away for rolls.  I also forgot to add more salt as recommended in the reviews so I added salt to warm water and used that to brush on top--no egg.  turned out great!  thanks for a great recipe!

This was my first time baking bread to that french bread. I love this recipe though it does take long because you have to let the dough rise but its worth it. Highly recommend this recipe, don't be shy to try it.

This recipe is fabulous.  As someone who's always a little nervous when it comes to baking bread, this recipe always turns out.  If you're a novice, you can still make loaves that look like the photo!  I took the advice of other reviewers here and only used 5 1/4 cups flour, 2 t. salt, and proofed the yeast in the 2c. of water with a big pinch of sugar, letting it sit in the bowl for 10 minutes before adding the flour and salt. I also added a tablespoon or two of melted butter to the ingredients before mixing.  Turned out tasty, crusty and amazing...this is my go-to baguette recipe...nobody can resist it!

a bit bland. I think next time I will add more salt and some butter.  doesn't really have the taste that I was expecting- like the bakery at the grocery store. I will try this again though.

I made this bread twice in the last two days, with some slight modifications.  I decreased the flour, after kneading (I do mine by hand) in about 4 1/4 cups the dough wouldn't take much more flour so I didn't try any more than was on my bread board, so about 4 1/2 cups was about all that I used.  I worked my yeast in 2 tsp of sugar, just because I'm old school and like to do it that way.  I proofed it as the recipe said and baked it as indicated as well.  This bread was lovely, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.  My first batch didn't last through the day so I made another double batch the next day and it came out with rave reviews.  Great recipe all around.

Yum... The first time I made this I thought it was a little bland, so the second time I added 1 TBSP of melted butter and it was perfect! I will definitely make this any time I need french bread! I toasted this in the oven with olive oil and garlic powder and spread artichoke/spinach dip on it. Amazing!

I got a baguette pan for Christmas and wanted to try it out.  I figured it would take all morning to make the bread so I started early.  By the time Lunch rolled around I had made 4 loaves.  What a great recipe!  Also, it is truly a budget saver.  With only four key ingredients (all inexpensive if bought in bulk) I could make enough to give away to friends and those in need.

i used the best bread machine bread recipe from this site for the dough so i am only rating the baking method. it worked fabulously. i used the foil for the 2nd 20 min baking increment and it really helped the crust from overbrowning. the wash made for a really nice crust. the only thing i want to practice on is getting the slit marks to look better. they just about disappeared during baking. the hubs and i shared 1 loaf w/ Sausage Soup from this site and i am freezing the other one to make parmesan crostinis for my holiday party

Exactly as the creator described, this recipe yields a perfectly crisp crust with a fabulously chewy and moist center. I followed the recipe as written (using a dough hook to knead)... I will be honest and say, as a novice bread baker, I was worried it wouldn't turn out when I wasn't getting "the window" when I stretched the dough. However, I am happy to report I am quite proud of the results! Thanks Jenn!

Fantastic!  This is the second time I have ever made any type of yeast bread the first time was a disaster. (hamberger buns that came out like heavy biscuits)  This was so easy.  I even made a couple of mistakes and it came out great. (forgot to grease the pan.  I just used cornmeal and I used a whole egg for the top instead of the white.  oops!)It looked like it was from a bakery.

This was my first time making bread. And it turned out great. I wished at first that it had more of a kick but then I realized that this bread would be amazing with a great soup or chili. It is has just the right crunch on the outside and gooood chewy center. My little sister loves it. :) ( I didn't have regular flour though...I only had bread flour that I got for experimenting this summer.)

One word describes this: Perfection.  Truly worth making (again and again and again and again!)
Update: Have been making for a few years now from this recipe but side note, if you adjust the servings to 36, it is an even 3 packets of yeast. I do proof the yeast prior to adding too.

Mine turned out very dense. Once cooled, it became crumbly. The taste is okay, not crispy. Instead of spraying water on oven wall, I put boiling water in a jelly roll pan under the bread when it was baking. I was hoping it would add some moist. I probably did but did not work perfectly well. Will try again since it's a really easy way to make French bread. I will try reduce the amount of flour used and spread water on oven wall next time.

Everything about this recipe is a winner!  I made this for a potluck alongside bruschetta, and everyone was raving about it.  When I first got there, someone even commented that it looked like it was a fresh bakery baguette.  I made the dough in the bread machine, but otherwise followed the instructions to a T.  I love that this recipe has the directions on how to shape the loaf; I have never been able to figure that out on my own.  This recipe was so straight-forward, easy, pretty, and delicious!!!  Definitely a winner!!

This was my very first time making bread, and it came out great! Even looked pretty. Will definitely be making this again. Just wondering, in case anyone feels like responding -- how come one of my loaves rose more than the other, when I did the exact same thing to both?

Made this last night for dinner.  So very good and easy I may not ever buy French Bread again!  Followed the recipe exactly, 'cept didn't add water to the egg white and only applied it once.  Makes 2 huge loaves!

Wow.  This bread is amazing!  I was looking for a use for some leftover garlic butter and had some yeast on hand.  I halved the recipe (only had one packet) and I wish I had had enough for the full!  It needed a little flavor on its own (didn't add the extra salt) so the garlic butter was perfect on it. Am making it again tonight with the extra salt!  Didn't add all of the flour either time--dough was beautiful and elastic after just over 5 cups (or just under 3 for the half recipe).  This was the second time I've ever made bread and I look forward to many more!  Thanks for the great recipe!  Edited: Didn't need to cook the full time--when I went to do the second brush-on, the bread already sounded hollow and so I only baked it 5-7 min more.  Still delicious!

This was my very first attempt at making French Bread.  The bread is tasty and looks great!  My husband thought it was a little dense, but he still scarfed up an entire loaf!     I will admit, when I first took the dough out of the mixer and started kneading I thought I did something wrong!  It was rough and hard to work with.  I kneaded for about 10 minutes though and it came together perfectly.  I also put a few ice cubes in the oven to create some steam and I think that really helped create a nice crust.

Per other reviewers suggestions, we added extra salt and 5 cups of flour provided us with beautiful dough.  We also added 1 tps of sugar.  One loaf we baked with egg white spread over it.  With the other loaf, we made a garlic butter/basil spread and put it in the loaf before we rolled it up.  Then after letting it rise, instead of putting egg white on top, we spread more of our garlic butter/basil mixture.  Delish!  The inside of our bread is more dense than traditional french bread.  How do we combat this?  We are rookie breadmakers, so we're sure this is something that can be improved upon.  Thanks!

5 stars for giving an excellent starting point, but minus one since I had to make some changes. I didn't need 30 servings, so I converted the recipe to 12 and went off that. Going off the new numbers, I actually omitted about 1/3 cup of flour and worked in about an extra 1/4 cup of water. I also added an extra pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar as well, and I made the slits before the last rise. All of these revisions were made based on the previous reviews this recipe was getting (fyi, I'm definitely not an experienced bread maker). That said, I probably should've stuck with the original size of the recipe because I totally ate it all.

This bread turned out so great! I made one large loaf, and then two small ones. On the small ones, I put some butter on one before I rolled it up, and then on the other I tried some garlic butter. Both are so delicious!

This was delicous! I made it the first time without changes and it was fabulous! The second time, for a change I used a whole beaten egg over top of the bread, and this made it even more crispy and golden yellow. I made this for my inlaws, my parents, and my sister and they loved it!  Definatley a keeper!

This is the easiest and most versatile recipe I have ever tried. And no matter how I tweak it, it always comes out perfect. I have substituted wholewheat flour, flaxseed and ground almonds for two cups of the white flour and it made two loaves of wonderful toast and sandwich bread. Tonight I divided the dough in two and made a loaf of french bread and a round of focaccia. Both were excellent and not a crumb was left after the meal. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Love it. Just one little caveat, the original recipe really needs a tad more salt. No matter how I tweak this bread, I always add one tablespoon of salt. Without the extra salt the flavor is bland.

added a bit more salt, and spritzed with water halfway thru, left egg white out since true french bread doesn't use this, lovely crusty bread. don't skimp on kneading or rising time, it should triple in size to get the real texture of french bread.

This is a great recipe for french bread. I modified it though by " proofing my yeast with the water and 2 table spoons of brown sugar for 10 minutes like I do with all my bread. I also added 1/3 cup of sugar( it won't be too sweet) and doubled the salt so the bread wouldn't be too bland. If you are having problems with your bead being bland, add a little more salt. I use bread flour instead of all purpose flour. 2 loaves of this do not last long at all in my house, my kids tear it up fast!

Finally, I can make real French bread. My first try was a bit too dense becuse the pan popped in the oven and deflated the loaf a little, but that was no fault of the recipe - and it didn't stop us from eating it all when it was still warm!

I doubted all the rave reviews, but decided to try the recipe.  It was wonderful. I cannot believe how good my bread came out-  crisp on the outside and steamy soft on the inside.  Yum.  I'll be making this again often, but will probably add olives, herbs, and garlic powder to get to my own version of artisan.  Thanks for sharing this recipe and for all you who reviewed it and added your own suggestions.

I actually forgot to do the third rise and it still worked out just fine. It was probably a bit more dense because of that, but I like it that way anyway. It does give 2 good sized loaves even though it doesn't look like it will at first. Great recipe, will make again. Oh, and butter on it is a must (for me)!

yummy, came out with a cripy crust that develops as it cools. dense, chewy, and the  inside is rolled looking. I did a half recipe, with 3 cups flour, and I added 1 tablespoon of butter. I dont know how large it was suppose to be, but mine was like the size of wine bottle. 

delish, thanks!~

A little bland to eat alone but really good for sandwiches or buttered.  This was SO easy to make.  Really a fool proof recipe.    I got adventurous a few days later and added whole garlic cloves and oregano.  Fabulous!

Really really good...I think it could use a bit of sugar, but other than that, a very easy and delicious bread.  The dough will be very dense but will rise nicely the second time.  Thanks for a good bread recipe!

Crust was really good and crispy, but the bread was a little too dense.  Maybe use less flour and more yeast next time?

Wonderful recipe. My first time making french bread, and it turned out perfectly! I went ahead and made four loaves, with a tbsp of butter and a little less flour, and it couldn't be better.

I am really not good at any breads and this turned out well.  I used almost 5 cups of flour and I did add 1 tbs of sugar.  It was good.

Really great basic recipe.  I added an extra teaspoon of rosemary salt (blend fresh rosemary and kosher salt until it is a fine powder), and a tablespoon of dried parsley.  I also proofed the yeast first with a bit of sugar.  Like others, I also used only 5 cups of flour.  
Turned out beautifully.  Will definately make again.

This was my first time baking bread & I was very impressed with how easy this was. I did change/add a couple things as others suggested. I only used 5 cups of flour, 2 1/2 tsp of salt and I added a Tbs of butter. I also used warmer water (about 125-130 degrees F). It turned out fantastic. Not quite the consistancy of french bread, but still tasted great. My family loved it and I've made it again since! Thanks

This is one of the best that i have made and i have foind that it is easy to manage to get long loaves. How ever i used the whole egg instead of the white alone. All who i shared it with loved it.

A good, basic bread recipe. I customized the recipe to 1/2 and then added ingredients into my bread machine, starting with 2 cups of flour, then adding about a cup more until the dough wasn't sticky. I thought it was very nice, with that signature chewy crust.

Excellent recipe..have not tried the corn meal..I have added a barley that was boiled and passed inside a Tiny Food Processor w/Basil or Oregano(allow the Barley to soak all available water)..its a large recipe(6-cups flour)..I always add a whole wheat to my bread recipes..Wheat Germ..Wheatena Cereal..or all of the them..great recipe.

I liked this bread, but I agree with some of the other reviews about its problems.  It is a little too yeasty tasting, and not very fluffy (even though it rose beautifully) and airy the way most french bread is.  I proofed the yeast with some sugar and didn't brush it with the egg white until I put it in the oven.  I still thought it tasted pretty good and I loved the cornmeal on bottom and how crispy the crust was.  It was also really easy to make, which is always nice.  So anyway, it was good, but not the amazing french bread recipe I've been looking for.

This came out alright...I think I should have cut my last twenty minutes by a couple of minutes (recipe said 15-20), and I did for 17 minutes. The crust was just a little to tough. One of the loaves I added Asiago cheese, because I was having a craving. I just bought a loaf of Asiago cheese topped french bread from a local bread shop and wanted to recreate. I don't know how they do it, but the inside is not so "doughy." This came out kind of heavy inside...I am not sure if it is me, or the recipe. Thanks, I'll practice I guess.

I had no bread at home until grocery day and was wanting some good old warm bread.  This is my first attempt at bread, succesful attempt I might add!  Gotta say that after reading the other reviews I was a little afraid of the outcome.  But was pleased with the result. For next time I will do some changes to the recipe to make the bread a little more tasty and less dense, and less yeasty, other than that good.  My five year old wanted more and more until I had to say "no more after that" :).  Enjoy!

The BEST bread I have ever enjoyed. I use my breadman bread machine rather than a "stand mixer" to kneed the dough. When the machine beeps after a few moments, I shape into a ball and place into a greesed bowl. I also use 3 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast.

I have spent many years trying to make bread of any kind,(and never succeeded) however I tried this french bread recipe with new found hope! Its perfect, the taste was tangy and delicious. I put a cookie sheet underneath on the bottom rack filled with water and I of course used a clay cookie sheet for the bread - 2 thumbs up!

This recipe is great. I never made bread before because I never had the patience for waiting for it to rise. Since I did not have a stand mixer so I added 2 cups of flour, 2 cups of warm water, and the yeast and mixed it with an electric mixer for 30 seconds on low speed then beat it on high for 3 minutes and added the remaining flour with a wooden spoon.

This came out great!  I did put in a pan of boiling water on the bottom rack while it was first rising, made sure the "warm" water was between 120 & 130 degrees to activate the yeast (instead of 110) and used egg yolk & 1 tbl of milk. Loved it!

Wonderful recipe - effortless, precise and very, very tasty! If I had known french bread was this easy, I think I'd have made it a lot sooner! The only change I made was to add a pinch or two of sugar, as I like the balanced, savory flavor this imparts.

I just made this bread and i have to admit at first i was very skeptical since the recipe is pretty much just water, flour and yeast. WOW, this bread turned out great! i can't even believe i made it. I took others suggestions and reduced the flour to 5 cups. It wasn't rising very well so i boiled some water, put it in a pan on the botom rack of the oven, covered the dough and set it above the water closed the door and it rose beautifully. Followed the rest of the instructions to a T and it turned out great!

I would not use full amount of flour at first, because 6 cups ended up being too much for me (perhaps due to altitude). 5 1/4 c. was a more accurate measurement. Otherwise good stuff!

Easy recipe. Itmade a good french bread.  The only thing is that I like my french bread to be less doughy.  Two loaves the length of a cookie sheet was too thick for me.  Next time I'll divide the dough into three or four skinnier loaves.

I will make this again.  Even my very picky, francophile husband loved this bread.  I halved the recipe and made one loaf, which was great, but I might try halving the recipe and making to "flutes" next time for lots of crust!

Not at all what I expected.  When it was done baking, it reminded me of a pretzil.  I don't think I will try it again.

Wow! I just finished baking this bread and it turned out amazing. The crust was crispy and inside was nice and fluffy. I can't wait to make it again for the holidays.

I love this bread!  The first time I made it I steamed them but used too much egg white and the crust was way too hard.  This time I cut back on the egg and steamed them again and the loaves turned out beautifully!  The way I steamed them was by following another reviewer's suggestion by putting about 6-8 ice cubes on a cookie sheet on the rack directly below the bread.  I left it in for the first 15 minutes of baking then removed the pan.  It works great!

This recipe is almost exactly the same as the one in the red checkered BHG cookbook.  The only difference is that the BHG one only calls for 2 packets of yeast.  The rest of the recipe is the same down to the rolling it out and the serving amounts.

What a great French bread.  I really love the way it tears apart (I'm guessing that's from shaping the loaves by rolling them up).  And the chewy texture is wonderful.  It was best fresh out of the oven (with the Ginger Crab Cakes recipe from this site), but the second loaf has complemented eggs, turned into croutons for soup, and made nice little raclette cheese sandwiches.  A very easy dough to work with, too--fairly quick rising.  I'll definitely make this again.

These came out almost perfect, just a little dense.  I'm not an avid bread baker, so maybe I'm just doing something wrong.  Anyhow, it tasted great.  I'll be saving these to make croutons and french toast tomorrow.  Thanks.

This bread turned out okay as my first attempt at a yeast bread, but I think it could be a little better. I was looking for something a little less dense and with a little more flavor. However, I may try proofing the yeast with a bit of sugar along with the warm water before adding it.  I just don't think it rose quite enough.  And I am going to use egg yolk instead of egg white to develop the crust, as I like it a little more golden.

Also- are these supposed to be baguette-type loaves?  I was looking for something a little larger...

Other than that, the bread is satisfactory.  Just the smell of it baking in the oven was worth the effort!

I was really looking forward to making this bread, but I was a bit disappointed!  The loaves looked wonderful after baking, but they were SO dense!  They still had a good taste though, but I think 6 cups of flour is way too much.  Next time I will only be adding 5 cups.  This was also fairly easy to make, I just put all the ingredients in my bread machine and on dough mode.  I will be making this again, but will adjust a few things.  Thanks Jenn!

This bread is awsome!  It was very easy to make and tasted incredibly good!  I don't ever want to make bread in my bread machine again if I can make great bread from scratch as easy as this.  My entire family loved this bread!  Thank you for sharing this recipe with all of us.

Great bread! Fairly easy recipe although time consuming. I only ended up using 4 1/2 cups of flour, doubled the salt, and added a tablespoon of butter. My bread came out a little dense but is still delicious! Probably not the recipes fault either. I will definitely use this recipe again!

This recipe is a keeper.  I did modify a few things per other reviewers suggestions. I only used slightly over 5C flour.  I did proof the yeast in a tablespoon of raw honey with the warm water.  I also used 3 tsp salt per suggestions. I made 4- 8” loaves and used an egg/milk wash with sesame seeds.. made the tastiest and prettiest sandwiches!  Making more tonight.

This is my go-to recipe for fresh bread. I have used bread flour, all purpose flour, and whole wheat flour in various combinations and usually add in some ground flax seed and it always comes out great. I am lazy so I usually mix it up one day and then let us rise overnight and then divide it and bake it in the morning. This also gives it a little bit of a sour dough-like flavor. Also, I always weigh my flour (760 g) instead of trying to use cups to measure. I find that it’s hard to accurately measure flour consistently unless I weigh it. I use frech bread pans to bake it on so no cornmeal is needed and it crisps up nicely. I love this bread warm with some butter.

I won’t go as far as to say this was bad, but it wasn’t good either.  The only thing I felt like we could taste in this recipe is the doughy yeast and it’s far too dense.  I wish I would have read other reviews first, specifically the ones proclaiming they reduced the flour and upped the salt.  I might try this again with modifications, but as a first time bread maker it was a big let-down for all of the effort and time involved.    Might just stick to paying a few bucks for a finished loaf at the store.

I've made this countless times with great results. I use 5 cups flour, not 6. Five (5) tsp yeast. 2 tsp salt, 2 cups warm water. Follow instructions as written and everything is spot on every time.

Per previous comments I added an extra 1/2 tsp salt and 1 Tbs butter.  I also added a folding step and  another 10 minute rest before rolling out and  making final loaf.  Folding gives you a  tight loaf and nice rise.  Great recipe!

Wonderful bread!  Nice thick crisp crust and soft inside.  I made a few revisions.  I mixed a cup of warm water with the yeast and added a tsp of honey until the yeast was foamy.  Mixed 5 cups of flour with a tbl of salt (this may be too much for some, I am a salt fiend!); then added the yeast mix and an additional cup of water to the dry ingredients.  During kneading, I ended up using about another cup of flour.  I let the dough rise twice, kneading in between and making sure dough was covered in oil,  then baked in the oven with a pan of water in the bottom at 375.  The bread turns out with a nice crust and browns well without having to add the egg or cornmeal.  I baked in one large round loaf in a stoneware dish and had to increase baking time by 20 minutes.  Lovely with honey or saucy dishes!

This made very good French bread. I topped the bread with Tastefully Simple Onion Onion seasoning and the Garlic Garlic seasoning. That added the right touch.

Wow! I have been baking bread for years but this just came out so nice I think it’s the best I ever made. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except I added about a tablespoon of melted butter. Using Hudson Cream bread flour this was just like from a high-end bakery!

I cut the recipe in half (using 1 packet of yeast) and I added 1 Tbs of butter and doubled the salt. It's tremendous! I love it. But I couldn't give it 5 stars since I tweaked it (following other comments)

So I actually had my husband make this recipe before me and it was fantastic! My husband comes from a homemade bread family and has wanted to try to make French bread because they only ever made the traditional loaf pan bread. He’s not much of a cook but with my help this was very doable for him. The taste and texture was great. We have made this a few times and we love it.

Amazingly easy! What a great recipe for two loafs of steamy hot, crunchy on the out side soft on the inside. Had to use a hair more flour to get everything to come together but when it did it was nice and light and the elasticity was amazing. The egg white finish was new to me also but g ave the bread an amazing crust. Next nice I will make 4 baguettes.

Made this in my bread maker on dough setting. Adjusted recipe to 20 servings. Came out perfect. We buy our yeast in bulk, so I added 2 tsp.  This has become my go to bread when I want a crusty bread.

Excellent - I've been baking for over 40 years and this is a 'keeper'.   I needed a recipe with just basic ingredients, 'no frills', as a gift for a friend with dietary restrictions.  This was perfect.  I made a few changes after reading some reviews.  I used 4 1/2 tsp. of Red Star yeast that I buy in bulk, (the 'F' brand stopped working well for me 2 years ago!)  I made the cuts in the tops of the loaves halfway through the 2nd 'rise' and I waited to brush them with the egg white/water to just prior to putting them in the oven.   They look and taste great!  Thank you for this recipe!  I will be making this again - just for us!

like many others I changes a few things.  Put in about 1/4 cup of sugar and 2 teaspoons of salt.  Also, I used about 4.5 cups of flour total.  The bread came out with a thin crust.  I wish I new how to make it with a nice thick crust instead.

This bread turned out great. Since there are just the two of us, I made up both loaves, baked one and frozen one. I did not raise the dough the second time before I froze it. Have done this with other breads and works great.

first time I made it , it was too dense. I tried the 5 cup recipe and probably too much yeast. I was softer but didn't have good flavor. I might try it one more time.

After reading other reviews, I proofed the yeast (2 2.5 oz/5 tsp. quick rising) in 2tsp sugar and 1/2 C warm (110 deg) warm water, reduced flour to 5 1/4 C, increased salt to 1 Tbsp, and added 1 Tbsp flour.  I also scored the loaves prior to the second rising.  Finally, i always use bread flour over all-purpose flour, as I like the texture and rise much better when I do.  If you don't have bread flour, or don't want to purchase it - google the instructions for adding some vital wheat gluten to all your bread/roll recipes, you'll be glad!  These edits worked great!

A great recipe, with some suggested updates found in the comments.  I reduced the flour by about .5 a cup, and increased the salt a bit.  Easy, and delicious!

Good recipe.  No sugar for authentic French bread.   I used a mixer to make the dough and probably only used 5 cups of flour.   Note for all those who complained about the density, but didn't read the recipe: add enough flour to get the right consistency.  No more.

Tasty and not too hard to make. I was a little frustrated that it was really too much dough to use the KitchenAid for kneading the dough.

This is as authentically French as one can get without actually travelling to France.  Other reviewers have posted that they added sugar or butter to the recipe.  Don't do that.  Truly European breads hardly ever use any fats or extra sugars.  They like their bread crispy on the outside and chewy dense inside.  To achieve that, the yeast has to feed from the gluten.  Which anyone who is or cares for a diabetic knows creates sugar.  Adding other sugar sources ruins the texture of the bread, IMO.  Also, to decrease the density of the loaf allow it to raise longer.  The longer this bread rises the less dense it shall be...

This bread out great.  One of the complements said "this tasted like bread you get at the store".  Now that's what consider a success.  I usually just make dinner rolls, but this time I wanted some crusty bread to go with some cheesy potato soup.  This turned out great and was very easy to make.  I started it the night before all the way up to before the 1st rise.  The next day, around 3 o'clock I took it out and let it warm up for 2 hrs.  Then I followed the directions as stated.
Oh! BTW I increased the salt by 1/2 tsp., proofed the yeast for 10 min. with 1 T of honey and omitted the cornmeal because I used a parchment lined pan (no sticking!).
Thanks for the great and easy recipe.

Very good! I used 5c flour per viewers suggestions. I also proofed yeast with warm water and sugar and used 2 tsp salt. I brushed whole egg on top and when it came out of the oven I brushed it with melted butter. Next time I wont brush with butter as it didnt need that!
Made this in my kitchen aid mixer and let it "knead" in the mixer for 10 minutes

This bread was easy to make.  I was a little surprised that the bread didn't have sugar in it.  I did take the advice of some of the other reviewers and added a little extra salt and yeast and I only used about 5 1/2 cups of flour.  I also added about 2 tsps of olive oil after all of the flour was added.  My Kitchen Aid mixer did most of the kneeding.  The only problem I had was after shaping the dough into a loaf, I put a damp towel over it  to raise the last time and it stuck to the  bread dough.  The dough deflated some when I pulled the towel off, but it still baked up well and had a great flavor.

great recipe -  i add a little sugar and I make the dough from this recipe. Then I flatten and add broccolli and sausage and cheese and roll it to make a stuffed bread. I liked the taste of this bread recipe better than others I have tried.

This was easy and awesome! I used 3 cups of flour, brushed with butter not egg and put a bowl of water on rack below bread, crust was perfect and crispy. Recipe made two decent sized loafs. I will make this more often.

i really hate when such a highly rated recipe fails for me.  it doesn't happen often but for me,  this recipe missed the mark.  I'm not going to change the recipe then rate it according to all my changes.  i made this recipe EXACTLY as written.... and the result was a tasteless,  boring bread that was so heavily dense that i could  use the loaves to beat people with.  i should have known something was off when the yeast was mixed with other dry ingredients instead of mixing it with warm/ hot water for proofing.  this was not my first attempt at bread baking,  other attempts were successful,  but unfortunately this is not a recipe I'll be trying again.  thanks for the recipe anyway... it seemed to bring joy to many others

Delicious! Rises well. Works with no salt and whole grain flour for a heart healthy diet. With whole grain I can only fit about 4 1/2 to 5 cups of flour. Great with soup!
Baked with a pan of water on the bottom rack. Makes the crust crispier.

Excellent recipe! Based on the reviews here, I increased the salt to 1 tablespoon, and I also added 1 tablespoon of sugar as I proofed the yeast. I increased the yeast to 2 full TB as well since I was using the kind from a jar. For flour, I only added 5 cups, and then I kneaded it by hand and easily sucked up another quarter cup during that process. They baked for exactly 40 minutes at  375°F and I took them out halfway to put on another coat of egg wash. We’ve almost devoured one loaf already between my husband, one of my teenagers, and me.

This bread tastes yummy and is not super hard to make. When I made it we were out of cornmeal so I didn’t use any it turned out fine.

I thought this would be harder than it actually was. Both loaves came out deliciously crusty and ready for garlic butter. Yum! Thank you for sharing.

Made this bread exactly as presented and it was really a great bread for the stew we had for dinner.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that more salt is needed.  Other than that, great recipe and easy to follow.

It was the longest bread which I cooked.  It looked good but I didn’t like it. Because it didn’t taste good. Maybe the reason of this was I made it wrong.

I baked french bread last week. The dough is so hard when I was trying to squeeze it, so the product was also very hard after the baking. But I love it. I will try it again.

I made this for one loaf of French bread. I followed the recipe exactly and the bread came out very well. Half of it was eaten about 45 minutes after removing it from the oven. I used the rest of the bread to make Baked French Toast (the recipe is posted on this web site). I will definitely make this again.

This bread is amazing. Like others, the only change I made was to use a few teaspoons of sugar to activate the yeast, other than that, I stuck to the original recipe. Will definitely be making over and over again.

For my very first time making bread, it turned out really well! I think the instructions for shaping the rolls could have been a bit clearer, and it probably could have used more salt and butter, but otherwise it came out great!

I added less flour, a little more water and yeast to make it fluffy, and also some sugar to help the reaction of the yeast to rise the bread! I am a big fan of french bread. It is very popular anywhere in Brazil. When I see a good bread, I know is truly good! It's hard to find good quality bread in here. So, I prefer to make myself at home. This is the best receipt I found so far for french bread. The crust didn't come out as crunchy as I was expecting. Next time, I will not add any water (from the egg mix) on the top of this bread. It should come out just the wonderful french bread served in Portuguese bakeries from Brazil. My Mother is a baker and she said for a perfect french bread, you don't need to wash the bread with egg whites, or anything else. I will try that next time.

I loved this recipe.  I added just  1/2 tsp more salt, only used 5 cups of flour didn't have cornmeal so I used parchment paper. Delicious! I want to unload a picture but not sure how.

Love this bread.  I make it all the time.  Quick, easy and delicious!  Not quite the bread they make in France, but very versatile as large loaves, smaller hoagie rolls, and sandwich rolls.  I've found that 4 tsp of yeast works quite well instead of the amount in the recipe.  I also add extra salt and about 2 T of vital wheat gluten.  I grease the rising bowl with olive oil, but I find that the bread better has a better texture without any other oils.

This was great. I halved the recipe using the whole package  of yeast. I did forget the egg wash but everyone raced about the bread. I will be making this again soon.

I love at 6500ft altitude and this still turned out perfectly. I added a little salt and olive oil for my own flavor preferences and the loaves were fluffed and crusty. This is my new go-to recipe for bread!

Turned out great! One of the problems I ran into was I adjusted the serving size to 10 but the instructions didn't change. Unknowingly I added 2 cups of water when it should have been 3/4 cup. It wasn't a disaster because I just kept adding flower until it thickened to dough. It still rose and proofed just fine!

I changed the water for home brew kefir and it gives the bread amazing lightly sour dough flavor.

Perfect bread!! I was skeptical about not adding any kind of oil, but besides the dough being a bit on the sticky side, it turned out awesome. On the flavor aspect, I thought it was soooo good. The crust was rich and delicious (I used a whole egg for the wash... not just the egg whites).

First bread I've EVER made and I didn't make as big a mess in the kitchen as I had feared.  This was fun and easy to make, and the final product turned out way better than I expected. I followed the amended version posted by Sabra Bartlett, and voila, 2 perfect loaves of French bread.  Can't wait to attempt some others.

I will never have to buy French bread from the bakery again. The only change I made to the recipe was to use bread flour instead of all purpose, add 2 tablespoons melted butter to the dough, and brushed the loaves with melted butter instead of the egg wash. My pans were not big enough for those long loaves, so I ended up making six smaller loaves and cutting ten minutes off the baking time. They didn't last a day between two people, and I couldn't be happier.

This was my first experience ever making bread from scratch. I followed the very helpful tips from reviewer Sabra Bartlett. I had no clue how to 'proof' yeast so that tip alone was great! My husband and I both LOVED this bread. I served it with seafood chowder and we demolished one loaf between the two of us. I will definitely be making this in the future. I think this is a perfect recipe for someone who is new to bread making, like myself.

Fabulous, easy recipe, especially if you have a stand mixer with a dough hook.  I added a bit more salt and a little bit of sugar the second time I made it, and it was even better than the first time.

It was a good bread and close to the French bread that we've made before but needs something to punch up the flavor a little bit... like a little butter and maybe a teaspoon of sugar...

First time making a French bread.  Came out great.  Watch the video twice and you'll be just fine.  I am going to try only 5 cups of flour and a bit more yeast next time on the advice of another reviewer to see if I can achieve the slightly chewy inside.  The crust came out picture perfect.  I disagree that this bread doesn't have flavor per others.  It tastes exactly how French bread should.  Served with Chicken Noodle Soup from this site.  Hard to say which was more the star of the show, a fine meal.

I loved this bread I did add a couple tablespoons of sugar and a little bit of coconut oil about a tablespoon or two .  If  you are worried about the water you can just work in a little more flour this is a versatile and wonderful recipe

This was my first time ever baking yeast bread, and it turned out great! I only had 2 packets of yeast, so I modified the recipe to include 4.5 cups of flour. This bread + butter = heaven. Next time will probably try with rosemary or garlic!

Mine rose very quickly on the first rise and tasted a bit more like yeast than I expected, so I might reduce the yeast to 4t next time.  Otherwise, it was delicious, moist, and airy!  Also, didn't put the egg wash on since I like more of a tender crust.

Loved it. I suspected it might need a little suger to help the yeast along and added one tsp, but I followed the rest word by word. The first time I've actually managed to make bread with a crispy crust and a slightly chewy texture. Great recipe!

2 cups whole wheat, and rest AP flour, 1 T sugar, added half t. of salt. No eggs wash... Super yummy. Makes big loaves. I made 1 large loaf for my family of 6 to enjoy and 2 smaller loaves that we have away to friends.

A simple and delicious French Bread.  Here are some thoughts:

* 6 CUPS of four seems like  a lot - unless you weigh your flour.  A cup of flour weighs about 4-1/4 oz, so 25 -1/2 oz is the ideal weight for 6 cups and works perfectly.

* I used a Kitchenaid to kneed the dough; cut the time in half and it worked great.

* I added 1 tsp more salt

* I added 2 tbsp softened butter to the dough while kneeding.

* For a softer crust, use less egg white; for crisper crust - use more.

Only thing I changed was The shape of the loaf. I made two round loaves instead of the more traditional "French" or bagette loaf. This recipe worked well and easily for me.... and this was my first homemade bread ever not made in a bread machine.

This was really simple to make. However, the end product was a dissapointment. The bread was to dense, and the crust was way too thick.

Who knew french bread could be this easy? Saw many recipes that seem to complicated and so i skipped trying to bake french bread. After seeing this one the attempt was very well received. Crusty outside, chewy inside:) Pass on the store bought ones and go for gold with this recipe.

This turned out great!  I used 5 tsp active dry yeast & 1 tbsp honey in the beginning.  After 20 minutes in the oven, I followed the instructions and coated again with egg wash, but took it out again after 15 minutes (rather than 20) because it was getting soooo brown.  One of my loaves didn't rise after shaping it into the loaf, but the other one is just gorgeous.  As soon as this bread came out of the oven, I broke the cardinal rule of bread baking and snuck a piece off the loaf that didn't rise - the middle was thoroughly baked through and chewy, while the outside was nice and crispy.  Only giving 4 stars because of the modifications made :)

This recipe was a great starting point. What I did differently- I miXed all the dry ingredients, minus the yeast, and then added 1/4 c of sugar. Then to the warm water I added 2 tbsp of molasses. Then I emptied two packets of the active dry yeast to the water and molasses. Then I mixed it all. When everything was mixed, I added just a little oil to make the dough feel right. Let it rise for an hour. Then rolled it out and shaped it. Let it sit for another 20-30mins. Then followed the baking instructions posted. I didn't have eggs, so instead of egg wash, I brushed the top with Sea salt and olive oil. It came out beautiful, and yasted great. Next time I'll see how I like it with half of the sugar and molasses that I added. Just to cut back the sugar a bit, but the flavor was gr w at, and so was the texture. Thinking with the way I have it now, It'd be great with walnuts and dark chocolate chunks for a dessert bread/breakfast treat. I made it a second time with 2tbsp of chia seeds. Maybe do the chia seeds with the chocolate and walnuts. Not sure. My stepdad said th flavor would be great with raisins too. The recipe is definitely a good starting point. I've tried making bread before, and it wasn't as good. This recipe was a huge help, so thank you.

This was SO DENSE! This recipe is not for bread, it is for baseball bats. I followed the recipe TO THE LETTER and still ended up with a miserable and disappointing result. Will have to go buy a loaf of bread to make up for this disaster.

I added 1 tablespoon of  salt instead of the recommended amount.  I also "bloomed" the yeast with the warm water and about a teaspoon of sugar.  I also added 1 T of melted butter to the mix.

I listened to the others. I used 5tsp yeast. But I weigh my flour for accuracy while baking. So I weighed the equivalent of 4 cups and needed more flour. It was about 4 1/2 cups. 2tsp of salt. It is great!

Perfect.  I halved the recipe, as written, and loved it.  Baked golden brown, crunchy crust and chewy center.  Next time I plan on not halving the recipe, but instead, after the first bake freezing one loaf for later use.  I can use the 2nd bake to finish it off from the freezer with no problem, I think.

made by hand followed others suggestions.proofed the yeast, put a pan of water in the oven, 2 tspns of salt, used 4 cups of flour and some of the last two, kept it to a min just enuff so it wasnt sticky but still easy to knead. got lazy only used one pan yah they fit. i buttered and floured the pan and brushed only water. delicious my only correction will be to lower  the cooking time as they came out a lil dry. check the bottom as well as tap test. anyway very easy to do by hand just a bowl and a counter. p.s. also cut before final rise and washed after so towel dint stick

Ever since my local bakery went out of business I have struggled to find a nice firm bread for stuffing. I usually bought a French bread for the stuffing. After many fails of new bakeries I decided to try making my own. Since many people said this bread was dense, which is what I like for stuffing bread, I tried it. I was not disappointed.  I only used different steps. I proofed the yeast in a half cup of water with a little sugar. I mixed the rest of the water (1.5 cups), salt and 2 cups of bread flour in my Kitchen Aid Mixer. After the yeast was proofed, I added it to my KA bowl and mixed it in. Then I continued to gradually add flour until the dough was no longer sticky. For me that took five cups. I let the mixer knead the dough for 12 minutes. Then I continued with the recipe.  The dough was easy to work with and it made two beautiful loaves. I did  use loaf pans. It took about 30 minutes to bake.  (Instead of the egg wash I used melted butter. I brushed on butter right after forming the loaves and putting them in the pans. Then I brushed with butter again after baking. The crust stayed relatively soft, which is what I was hoping for.

Follow almost exactly - added 1/2 ts salt and 1 T butter. Cooked for gathering with Jambalaya. Very good and well liked. Could use even a little more salt (just slightly bland).

Actually the first bread recipe I've made that actually turned out perfect. I reduced the amount of servings to 24. As some readers mentioned, I reduced the amount of flour to 4 cups but kept  the amount of yeast the same. I also activated the yeast according to the package instructions before adding to the flour. I mixed the yeast with 1/2 cup of warm water which I then added to my bowl of flour. The recipe called for 2 1/2 cups of water. I only added 2 cups to the flour as the other 1/2 cup was what I activated the yeast in.

It came out a little bland.  It's a great basic recipe to grow from and modify.  Try tweaking the ingredients and see what you come out with, that's my advice.  Honestly, I think that the recipe would be good with a half cup or so of asiago cheese in there, but to each his own... And the recipe needs more salt or something.  It's so bland.  I love the texture, but the taste...

I did as recommended & added 1 tsp salt, an extra 1/2 tsp yeast totaling 3 tsp or 1 TB, & 2 TB cubed butter.  Let rise in warmed oven 40 minutes, everything else as per instructions with the exception of 360 on convection instead convention.  Very very good bread recipe.  I've used several French bread recipes & this is my go to recipe now on.  Tweak it here & there but great recipe.

I made this to go with our spaghetti dinner today and it didn't make it to the table. I made a half recipe to try it out. After reading the other reviews I decided that I would only increase the amount of salt called for and leave the rest of the recipe alone this first time. It turned out delicious but a tad dense. I will reduce the amount of flour next time by 1/4-1/2 cup. I did also scour the bread at the beginning of the second rise as this is how I've always made bread. When the bread came out of the oven, I slathered it with butter transferred it to a cooling rack and put a kitchen towel over it to cool off slightly before gorging myself (and the kids) on delicious homemade french bread. 

Next time I will reduce the flour a tad, keep the increased salt, and make the full recipe because one loaf isn't enough for 4 people apparently :D

I didn't like it. It was bland and the crust is very hard. I followed the recipe, it wasn't over baked. I read the reviews and added extra salt but it was still very bland. I'd personally add at least double the salt.

I prepared the dough in my bread machine, I had to add a tablespoon of veg oil and maybe 1-2 tablespoons of water to get it all together nice. Then transferred the dough to a very large oiled pot and allowed it to rise, rolled it out and rise again. Baked it. THIS WAS AWESOME. I have made a ton of different bread recipes and this was by far the best. My family and I all thought it tasted like it came right from a professional bakery!

I loved how this turned out with the modifications that were posted. I did 2 tsp instead 1.5 tsp, 1 tbsp. sugar, 1 tbsp. of butter, I even smashed and added my own roasted garlic cloves. My husband and kids went nuts over it!! I just made this for a second time and made 4 small round loaves and they were perfect size for clam chowder bowls.

I have made this bread twice now and both times it was absolutely delicious. So easy that anyone could make this. I did let my dough rise longer the second time I made this (only because that is what suited my schedule!) and did not notice much difference from the first time, so this is not a terribly fussy recipe, very forgiving for bread Try it, you will not be disappointed.

Delicious! Will be my go to for a quick and easy tastey bread. I did cut the flour down to five cups. Used 5 teaspoons yeast and made diagonal slices before last rose as per previous reviews. I also slathered some melted butter on for the last five minutes in the oven and covered lightly with tin foil. Turned out gorgeous

I made the recipe according to the directions, and it was good. I changed things a bit for the second try. I replaced one cup of flour for Malted Barley Flour, and increased the rise time. I added one egg, replaced half the water with Organic Half and Half, added 3 tablespoons of olive oil. The second try was OFF THE CHARTS ! Yummy, not too dense, and full of flavor and moist.

I love this recipe but did change a couple things. After trying this recipe a couple times and reading reviews I found what works best is using bread flour and adding a pinch of sugar to yeast mixture, only using 5 1/4 cups flour and not adding salt until late into the kneading. I also increased the salt to 2 tsp. I let it rise in my oven with the oven temp around 90. I also prefer omitting the egg wash during baking just using water gives it a nice crust but not quite as crunchy. I also add the ice cubes in the oven twice during baking as another reviewer mentioned. Fantastic fluffy bread with crisp crust. Nothing better.

I am a breadmaking newbie. This was the first really good bread I've ever made. The recipe can be varied a bit according to my resources. My bagettes, and a dz small rolls turned out so good I wanted to eat them all myself. I used KA  Bread flour. Will try Gold Medal AP next.

This is a nice easy recipe. Our bread came out nice, I made it specifically to make bread pudding and it turned out wonderful for that. We made french toast out of the second loaf.

This bread was delicious. Great texture--chewy crust, soft center. Only 4 stars because I edited the recipe. Started with bread flour, not all purpose. Increased salt to 2 tsp, added about a tablespoon of olive oil, and decreased flour to scant 5 cups. After baking, rushed with olive oil. If I weren't using for sandwiches, I'd skip the final step, but I wanted a slightly softer chew. Not dense at all (thanks to ample kneading and reducing to 5 cups of flour) and made very fine bahn mi sandwiches.

This was a wonderful recipe! Very easy to make and resulted in a nice soft crumb and crunchy crust. The only change I made was to sub one cup of flour for whole meal and added a tbs of sugar. I could hardly wait until it came out of the oven to tear in. I would certainly make it again!

This was very good and had a very crisp crust and soft inside! I took the advice of another commenter and used almost twice the amount of salt and a teaspoon of butter. I also used flour instead of cornmeal on the baking sheet, which didn't seem to make a difference.

This came out great!  My family has been to France so, they know what bakery fresh French bread tastes like, and they loved it! It's not a difficult recipe, but does take more time than listed.  I need to get a little better at forming the loaf.  Make sure you cover all the bread with the egg wash.

I made did this recipe this weekend, and its FANTASTIC! With a few tweeks it turned out just perfect. I have the worst luck with most breads but this one turn out amazing. Like a few other reveiwers said I did use less flour, reduced it to about 5 cups. (Plus flouring the surfaces and sprinkling while kneeding) the consistancy was perfect. I did add a little spices to the egg white when brushing the second time i made it. But it was so tastey just plain. I also really liked the colour after the first 15 in the oven so i did as suggested and covered with tinfoil for the second half of baking. Im glad i did cause the browing was great. I do recommend following all the rest and rise instructions it made for a really soft and light inside. And the final rest on the pan once you brush woth egg white make sure you thouroly brush and then let it sit, the crust was delisious. A definate keeper

I added a little more salt and a tablespoon of butter. It still needed more salt. I didn't add all the flour. It's pretty bland, but so are most french breads.Next time I'll add an extra teaspoon of salt. It was very pretty bread, nice crust and soft inside.I'll make it again.

This is a great recipe, the only hing I did different on the second go around was substitute 2 cups of bread flour and 2 cups of APF and it turned out awesome. The APF just made it super dense.

This is the second time I've made this recipe and it's  good. BUT you have to double the salt, coat it in olive oil before the egg wash, and then after the egg wash let it sit for at least another five to ten minutes before baking. The olive oil keeps it moist, the five to ten minutes lets it rise a little more after shaping it and patting it down with the wash, and the salt is because it's very bland without it being doubled. The first time I made it I just put the amount it told me to and unless it had some serious salt sprinkled on top it was yucky.

If by french bread you mean baguette then I'm sorry but this is not baguette. The crust is... Not a crust! Way too soft. Won't make that again.

I think the method is great, and produces a great loaf if you allow the yeast to proof first with the warm water and a teaspoon or two of sugar.  I also add just a touch of olive oil or melted butter, seems to make dough more "workable" when rolling out.  Make sure you have good yeast, and make sure to allow for full rising time, this is how you ensure you do not get a "dense" loaf of bread.

Just pulled these out of the over about 3 minutes ago and couldn't wait to taste! It turned out delicious! Only thing I did different was to proof the yeast before adding the flour and it turned out just fine. This is a great way to stretch your baking legs a bit ^_^

Tried the recipe and, as per most reviewers, it came out thick and dense. But the inside's really soft and chewy, my family loved it. On my next try, though, I'll take note of the others' insights and suggestions and hope to finally make the best baguettes for my family! :) Thanks for sharing this recipe and to those who share their tips on how to make it better! I'm a newbie in baking and am really learning a lot in here :)

Didn't do it for me, my loaves came out dense like a bagel.?  I tried another recipe which proofs the yeast first (as well as other differences), and it came out much much better.

This bread need more salt also it's too dense and 6 cups flour is too much . it would be better if Yeast measured in TSP rather than package very confusing.

I have made this a few times now. Great bread! The only thing that I changed is that I proof the yeast in the water before I add the flour and salt. That is how I was taught to make bread so that's why I did it... Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it comes out amazing :)))

Gave it a four because I used Tony Kollman's modification (one of the reviews). I've never made bread on my own and this came out great. My husband and son love it.

This bread is both aesthetically pleasing and delicious!  My husband even commented how beautiful it was.  A couple if things. It rose well but next time I will add additional yeast (wish I would've read the reviews about that issue before mixing it up.) The suggestion to brush with butter and honey, placing foil and a damp cloth over was an awesome finishing touch. I'll be keeping this recipe!  Final note, I used my dough hook to do all the kneading and it turned outgreat )always have a babe in arms so having both hands to knead is a rare luxury! )

Wow, this it the first french bread recipe that I tried that gave me the perfect crunchy, flaky crust.  Loved it!!  Recommend kneading for the full 10 minutes.  It made all the difference.

Easy and tasted really good! I weighed the flour rather than measuring in a cup. Also used 2tsps salt and added 1tbl butter. Used my kitchen aid and I am so pleased.

I made this wonderful bread this morning for lunch. It was excellent and picture perfect.  I sprinkled sesame seeds on the top of each loaf.  Beautiful to look at and heavenly to eat.  The work time was minimal and it took the normal time to rise.  This goes into my "winner" file.

I had never made bread of any kind before this recipe. Thanks for the excellent instructions. It came out very good even with the mistakes I made. Both the heaviness and the chewy crust are qualities that I enjoy. If you like this type of bread and actually know what you are doing, you should be in good shape with this recipe.

Great recipe.. I read other reviews but did not at more salt -- salt retards yeast & too much can kill yeast all together.. I added tablespoon of olive oil and 2 table spoons of mixed italian herbs ( parsley, basil, garlic & oregano).. Dough came out awesome..  I think the oil give nice texture.. I also cut before its has risen and brush egg only once.. Nice crust and held up to meatball subs nicely :)

Great and easy....my kind of bread!!  Made a 1/2 recipe single loaf last weekend that lasted about a hour. My husband has been asking for more all week :). Full recipe batch is rising right now. This two-loaf recipe took only 20 min to make it into my rising bowl - and that included pulling my stand mixer out of the cubboard, finding the dough hook, grabbing the few ingredients AND a full 10 min knead,  Awesome!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic! It's soooo good! Best eaten right out of the oven while it's still fresh, hot, and crispy. I'm so proud of my accomplishment with this! I'm no baker, and certainly have not tried anything with yeast before. I followed the directions and I took a cue from one of the comments who said he/she had basted the bread with a mixture of honey and butter after taking it out of the oven. I went a step further and made a honey butter mix to spread on it. - Mix room 4 TBLS of room temperature butter with 4 TBLS of honey. Unbelievably GOOD! Brie cheese works well too. Made four loaves and they were gone within an hour. Just myself and my husband Yum Yum!

This is a great starter recipe ~ Thanks for sharing, Jenn! 
I did proof the yeast first in 1/2 cup of the warm water with 2 tsp sugar, added 1 heaping Tbsp of Vital Wheat Gluten to the flour/salt mixture, and ended up using just 5 cups of A/P flour. I also used my Ankarsrum mixer to do the kneading after it mixed it, and divided the dough into 3 baguettes instead of 2. It smelled amazing as it came out of the oven, so much so that my husband and kiddos got to the hot bread before I could take the photo ~ and it was so delicious that the first loaf was gone in minutes ~ that is why the photo shows only 2 :-)

This recipe is a first bread for myself. It came out light and fluffy with a great crust to it. However, it lacked in flavour and was quite plain. I'd add sugar or something else to give it that kick. I used four cups instead of six, I couldn't figure out how the other users used more than that. I could barely knead the dough afterward. It took me quite a long time to make as there was so much wait time in between for the bread to rise. Overall, a fine start to a bread enthusiast!

This is an easy and tasty bread.  I scaled the recipe in half, used fresh milled hard white wheat berries, added 3T of vital wheat gluten to help with the rise (since I used whole grain flour), and kneaded in grated parmesan, olives, and fresh rosemary. It was very good and is going in my recipe box to be made many more times in the future. Looking forward to making paninis with the leftovers tomorrow.

Great recipe. A little too dense and bland first time. Second time I followed suggestions of others. I used 2 TBSP yeast, the water, and 2 tsp sugar to feed the yeast. I let it bloom for 10 mins. Then added the salt (bumped it up to 2 tsp) and gradually added the flour. The last cup I added and mixed by hand. It seemed dry but after mixing for about a minute it came together. I kneaded it for 8 mins then put in a bowl, covered and let double. Punched it down then separated it out. Let it rest the 10 mins. I worked in a bakery & we would pull/gently whip the dough while holding both ends to stretch it once it was a log shape. Once it is about the length I wanted it I wet the bottom using wet hands, then placed it on cornmeal and transferred it to a sprayed baking pan. Wet the top of the dough with wet hands or a spray bottle to keep from drying  out, then let sit. In the bakery we had a proof box that was kept around 80'F and was very humid. Moisture is important so the top doesn't dry.  Once the  dough is starting it's final rise, PREHEAT the oven. Big mistake is to not do it enough in advance. Once the bread reaches a certain point during the rise, it will start to fall & collapse, & causes a more dense flat bread without nice air pockets. After 25 mins I used a sharp knife and put the cuts in the bread, the next 5 mins of proofing they got a a little bigger. For the cheddar jalapeno one I wet the top/put toppings on. Use pan of water in bottom of oven for crispy crust.

I added some 4 tbsp of sugar and proofed my yeast. I also added about 1/2 tsp extra salt as others suggested. GREAT bread. Will definitely make again.

Turned out great. Only ended up needing 4 of the 6 cups of flour. I added 1 tsp more salt and 1 tbsp of unsalted butter, per other review suggestions. 

My new favorite! Loved it!

This bread works out perfectly well using only 2 tbsp of yeast.  Follow directions to the letter otherwise and it's a no fail recipe.  I add toasted sesame seeds to the egg wash and absolutely love it.

Tasted good but was very, very dense.  I proofed the yeast (5tsps.) with 1/2 cup water and 1 tbps of sugar.  Followed the recipe from there but reduced flour to 5 cups.  The dough just never seemed to rise after the first round.

Made this tonight and it turned out alright.  Followed the directions till the end where I substituted milk for water in the glaze mixture.  Flavor was alright, but the bread was very dense and the crust was nearly rock hard.  I don't know if it was something I did or not but it didn't come out as I had expected.  Not bad, but not quite what I was looking for I think.

To dense, may increase the 2nd rising time. And maybe the temp wasn't high enough for a proper rise. A bit blamd.

I've tried this recipe on two occasions and both times I've ended up with a super dense log that just doesn't taste quite right.  I've used differing amounts of yeast and flour with the same results.  Its easy enough that I would make it again to go with a soup at home but would never serve it to guests.

After following this recipe exactly, and attempting it twice, the bread turned out very dense and hard. Maybe I need to let it rise for longer, as in a few hours.

I read some of the reviews (good & bad), then decided to reduce flour  to 5 c. & used less than 1/2c more to knead it, 1 T. sugar and upped salt to 2 t.  It was so easy to make and fast (well kinda).  My old oven runs hotter than most & it baked in less than 30 min.  My son & girlfriend thought I bought it at the store.  We loved it.  Yes it was a little dense but it tasted like it had some volume, not all air. We will make this recipe again.  Thank you Jenn for sharing a great recipe.

This was so easy to make, and it tasted delicious.  I am new to making fresh bread, but I will have to try more now.  It was a lot a fun to make my own bread, instead of buying from the bakery at the store.

I went with a couple of the suggestions and did the cutting 'before' the second raising and also put 'garlic butter' on just prior to rolling. Also, I sprinkled some Kosher salt on top of the butter. Cooked at 375 for 20 minutes and then only 15 the second time. Came out perfectly done.

This bread is yummy and easy, which adds up to fantastic!  
With just a few changes, this recipe made two large loaves in less than two hours: I added 1/2t extra salt and almost 2T butter for a little extra flavor, and since my KitchenAid was busy with cupcakes, I just kneaded the dough by hand for about 8 minutes.
I made my family and friends very happy!

Tasty.  Maybe if I would have let it raise twice it would have been a little bit better/less dense.  But as is pretty tasty.

I made just as it is. The result was just as it promises, crispy/crusty outside  and soft/chewy inside. My husband loved it and asked for another loaf two days later.

FIRST-TIMER here! Love it, I had a great time making it, and it turned out absolutely perfect. i ended up making 4 smaller loaves so they'd fit on my baking sheet. I also used a little over 5 c. flour, not quite 6. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside! Great recipe, THANK YOU!

This is the french bread recipe I've been looking for all my life! Like other bakers, I added more salt, but that's the only thing I changed. It's beautiful! Crispy crust and soft insides; this isn't going to last until dinnertime!

This was absolutely a hit in my household. We have some left over (recipe makes 2 good size loaves)-- I'm considering making french toast out of the 2nd loaf. I live over 6,000 ft and didn't have to modify this at all. It was great bread!

Very easy to make and tastes great.  This is my recipe when I do not have a whole day to spend making bread.  I add some dried basil to the dough for some extra flavor.

Outstanding Recipe.  the second proofing while in the loaf form really turned this from a baguette to a loaf of crusty and soft french bread.  Really stellar recipe for use in the home.  Although, you really DO need to place a very shallow baking pan underneath filled with steaming hot water.  Your oven should be venting steam if done right.

Great Bread!  Easy to make.  The crust came out a little too tough, even with putting foil on top.  Other than that it was great with my homemade stew!

Great Recipe!  I halved it, added an extra 1/2 tsp salt, added 2 tsp honey, used bread flour, and added 2 tblespoons of butter after the flour mix & water were incorporated.  Also placed a pan of water under the bottom rack where my pizza stone was situated.  Loaf was crusty on outside with chewy center.  Next time I may try subing milk for water for more rich flavor. Yum!  Thanks for great recipe!

My family loved it. When kneading the dough, my strong 15 yr old son was a great help. After the bread was done it did not last for the following day:)

We thought this was better the 2nd day, but that is probably because the 1st day it was almost right out of the oven. W've used for garlic bread & w/basil, tomato & moz cheese grilled. Think next time I'll make 2 loaves & try to freeze one. Not as easy as some bread to make - more time consuming, but will diffinitly make again.

I made this and let my stand mixer do the kneeding.  It worked out beautifully!  I did add a little more salt and 2 tbsp of melted butter when it was mixing.  It's a little more dense than French bread I like to get in the bakery of the grocery store but still very delicious!

This is a nice bread recipe, even if its a little flavorless.  Also, maybe I made a rookie mistake...but do NOT put the towel directly on the bread for the second rise.  I suspended mine over a cooling rack on top of the cookie sheet the SECOND time I made it, because it STUCK to the bread the first time and ruined it.  But, its a pretty "friendly" recipe, and I'll try to add more flavor next time.  I've already added more salt, a few TB of sugar and butter, and used 1/2 milk 1/2 water.  But it needs more salt, no matter what...

I made this bread exactly per the recipe and it is the best French bread I have ever made or had in a restaurant.  My husband loved it.  Came out perfect and very easy especially for anyone with bread-making experience.  I will be making this bread on a regular basis.

Tried this recipe twice in a week.  First time I followed the recipe exactly as listed.  I was impressed and as suggested I added a bit more salt for taste.  I did however find the bread to bit a bit dense.  

I tried the recipe tonight and used one cup on beer (Bass Ale) and one cup of water.  Turned out wonderful.  

Anyone have suggestions as to how to make this bread less dense?

So easy once I got the hang of kneading the dough by hand. You can use a Kitchen Aid stand mixer to do all the kneading with the dough hook and it turns out pretty much the same for me. I added 2 tablespoons of milled flax seed and didn't use water for the egg-wash. Husband and I love having this bread around for sandwiches and soups. Will save this recipe for future use!

I tried both baking and steaming the bread. steaming it for 15 min turns the bread into great chinese buns, even better than other Chinese buns recipes I tried. The only thing is I used 5 tsp of yeast and I found the yeast taste and smell is too strong. Next time i'll add some coconut powder to cover the yeast taste. I also added a TBS of honey as I like sweeter bread.

Love it! Rolled the dough into baguettes/hogie buns and baked them on my pizza stone. Perfect. I freeze the mini loaves and then just pull one or two out when I want them.

Good basic recipe, I followed it exactly but just made half. Agree with the other reviewers though, it is a bit bland and needs some salt and sugar.

Recipe calls for too much flour and could use to be punched and allowed to rise at least once more. A little dense but good flavor.

This was a wonderful recipe, I wish I would have read the comments first, as it came out a bit heavy and I had to make the hubby pound it out a little for me... but it turned out delish! Thanks Jenn!

I really like this recipe. I added a little more salt and a Tbsp of sugar for more flavor and it seemed like it could take a little more of both. However the crust was deliciously crunchy and crisp and the inside was soft and chewy as advertised. Will make this recipe again and again.  Yumm!

very simple, delicious, and beautiful. crusty outside, chewy inside as said. I will be using this recipe many times after today.  Oh and to the woman with the baby w/egg allergy.. you don't have to do the egg wash. I was out of eggs when I first attempted it and the bread was still golden, delicious, crusty outside and chewy inside :)

This recipe was my first attempt at French Bread, and I was nervous I would inevitably foul it up. When the two loaves came out of the oven, I was AMAZED! If I hadn't made it, I wouldn't have believed it was homemade *blush*  I did follow a suggestion from another reviewer and added an additional 1/2 tsp. of salt (I used sea salt, not iodized table salt) and it came out with just the right level of saltiness.   This is a KEEPER!

I consider myself a pretty good bread baker, but I couldn't get this recipe to turn out as well as the supermarket french bread that my family loves. I tried it twice - using suggested variations and it still turned out really dense. The flavor was good, but the texture was wrong. Too dense and the crust was never right. I'll be taking this recipe out of my box and looking for another one. Until then it's back to the supermarket.

This bread was very, very good! It had all the qualities that I look for in a good French bread: it had a golden crust that was crispy to bite into, but the middle was soft and chewy. My husband and 2 year old son absolutely loved it. Thank you so much for posting a wonderful recipe, this will be my go to French bread from here on out!

This was my first foray into making bread.  It turned out fabulously.  I didn't change any of the ingredients.  However, I didn't let it rise the full 40 minutes after I punched the dough down (was running out of time) and just threw it in the oven as it was.  It still turned out better than most french bread I've bought from a store.  Will definitely make this again and let it rise fully the next time.  Thanks for sharing!

I did the recipe with my mom's help and it turned out pretty good, but the center was a little googy instaed of fluffy. And the crust could be a little crunchier.  That or I could've baked it longer.('u')

Nice crust, easy recipe.  Just still isn't the right texture inside.  Looking for the white chewy center like I have had at a French place in eattle.  This was a bit more course.  Used bread flour, high grade.

This bread is very dense and flavorless. I just took it out of the oven- which is usually the best thing ever, freshly baked bread- this is like a giant flavorless crouton.

This was my first attempt at baking French bread. The only thing I did differently than the recipe stated was since I didn't have the time to let the loaves rise after I'd put them on the cookie sheet, I baked them right away.  The bread was delicious & received rave reviews from my family. It seemed to taste better the next couple of days than it did the night I served it. I will be making this often in the future!

Mmmmm!  Made into garlic bread. Halved recipe.  Added more salt, less flour, 1 T butter, 1 pkt yeast.  More dense than I was hoping. Egg wash: 1 egg yolk, 1 T milk.  Made crust softer, but still crispy.

My sister is a pastry chef and when I told her I was making this recipe she highly recommended bread flour which I have never used before but my bread turned out delicious. I took others advice and added more salt.

I love to make yeast bread...but french bread has always intimidated me!  I finally got brave and gave this a try.  For my first attempt, I was very pleased.  The dough is beautiful to work with.  I used just a little over 5 cups of flour, and used a kitchen-aid with a hook attachment!  Thanks for the great recipe.  My family thanks you!

Great bread!  I cooked it in the oven with a lasagna so it got some beneficial steam while baking making the crust super crunchy.  I added a 1/2 teaspoon of extra salt and proofed the yeast as other reviewers recommended.  The bread came out great!!

I only used about 5 cups of flour and the bread was still pretty dense, but that was fine with me because I'm making little sandwiches with the slices.   I'll definitely use this recipe again and look forward to experimenting with it!

Excellent! I made a few modifications: I added one egg yolk and two tablespoons of melted butter to the dough while kneading. It did not seem to slow the expansion of the dough, as inclusion of fats can do. I used approximately 5 1/2 cups of flour instead of 6 (just started with 5 cups, and added as needed while kneading). Delicious!

so yummy and so easy! I find that I am often too lazy to operate a rolling pin, but I did fine forming the loaves by hand. Make sure to do both egg washes if you want a nice crispy crust. I sprinkled some salt on with the 2nd egg wash and I think that improved the flavor and added interest. This recipe could easily be modified to add herbs or olives or sun dried tomatoes for something really special

It is a bit dense, but that's what makes it so good!  I only made half the recipe, but will make the full batch next time.  My husband request that I make this weekly and my extremely picky 2 year old asked for more.

this is a great recipe...really simple and easy to make.  it has a slightly different texture than i had imagined "french bread" to be...a little more dense but still really tasty!  next time i am going to try adding more salt and possibly sugar as suggested by other reviewers but still really good as listed!  thanks for my new go to bread recipe!

I have made this recipe again for the second time.   This time I used just two packets of yeast and prooved it first.   I initially decided to follow the advice of several reviewers and use only 5 cups of flour.   However, it was way to sloppy and it took up the full six cups without any trouble.  The first time I made the recipe, I followed it exactly, including the damp teatowel ... this stuck to the bread (should have known this would happen) after it's second rising and deflated it.  Hence I decided to try again, this time I covered the shaped loaves with oiled clingfilm and that was better.   However, I agree with one of the reviewers who said that you really need to have the proper shaped bread pans for baggettes as, even though mine rose well, they still splayed out across the flat pan.  Still at the end of the day, even with less yeast, the bread is nothing like a french loaf, it is far too dense as had already been said.   I think it is going to be difficult to achieve the right result, fluffy and crusty at the same time, somehow this recipe needs to get more air into it ... I will try it one more time, using 5 cups of flour and one packet of yeast, and really try pulling and turning during the initial kneading to get the air into it ... watch this space.  p.s.  if the bread is not as edible as you would like, don't throw it out - turn it into breadcrumbs - much better than store bought.

Really a great recipe. It made 2 large loaves. I took a couple people's suggestions and  1. mixed teh ingredients and let sit int eh kitchen aid for 10 minutes before adding the salt then mixed for another 5.  2. I used only egg white on the top of the loaves. 3. I didn't use cornmeal.  **4. During baking about every 5 minutes I sprayed water into the oven for a perfectly wonderfully crunchy crust!!

I have made this bread twice. The first time I didn't enjoy it. It was too dense. Then I realized it was due to my developing too much gluten in the dough and nearly destroying it anyway. I added 4 cups flour at first, 2 tsp. salt and egg washed 5 minutes into baking and it turned out absolutely gorgeous. The recipe is wonderful and easy to follow with just minor changes. I've been using this recipe with my chili to dampen the heat.

very easy recipe to make. I found 6 cups of flour to be way too much.  I used about 3 1/2 cups that seem to be a lot better.  Although it does say add as much as you can. This bread is very good dipped in balsamic vinegar

Wonderful,EASY bread! This is my first time ever attempting french bread and this recipe made it easy for me! I did use other reviewers suggestions though. I used only 5 cups flour, only 2 packages of yeast and 1 whole Tbsp. salt.. I also made the cuts in step 4 after the 3rd sentence. Perfect outcome!!! Will make this all the time now :)

I've made the recipe several times now, and I think the only person that likes it more is my boyfriend! He loves coming home to the smell of fresh bread!   I've been cooking the bread on a pizza stone though (with parchment paper-or else it will stick!).  It gives the bottom of the bread a nice crisp finish.

This recipe worked out great! I did boost the salt up to 2 tsp.  I made one loaf plain and the other I added garlic salt, italian seasoning, and parmesan cheese then rolled it.  I put italian seasoning on the top of the seasoned loaf so I could tell the difference.  Today, I sliced the seasoned loaf and put roast beef and provolone cheese and toasted it in the oven. It was amazing and such a simple dinner after all that effort making the bread. This will now be a staple recipe in my recipe book.  I might try adding cinnamon and sugar for a sweeter loaf and maybe make french toast out of it.

Very minor tweaking (1/2 tsp more salt per previous review), but this is a perfect recipe for French bread! My dad taught me years ago to make bread in a Cuisinart, it handles all the kneading and everything perfectly so I made it (like all the breads I make) all in there, no stand-mixer, through the kneading and it was perfect! It made 2 gorgeous loaves! Highly recommended!

I tried making this multiple different ways as suggested by other members before posting and basically didn't think any of them were necessary. the recipe as written makes wonderful bread. This has become my "basic use all the time for fresh bread" recipe and I use it at least once a week. Thnx!

I have been making bread for years and always try new recipes.  This one is crusty and chewy and all that a good french bread is.  All I did is use the three packets of rapid rise yeast I had and it came out great!  Thanks for sharing.

This is very good french bread.  It's hard to believe that so few ingredients could produce such a tasty loaf, not to mention the great texture.  I make sourdough bread all the time, but lately have been buying french bread in the stores, so I thought I would give that a whirl.  I only made half the recipe because I thought it might not be that good.  Boy, was I wrong!  I'm going to double the recipe next time and freeze some loaves.  Thanks Jenn for this great recipe! -Sonja Allen

I don't have anything to say that hasn't already been said, but I've been trying to make good French bread for about a month now.  Until I made this bread, my bread was only so-so.  Using this recipe, my bread is A-MAZ-ING.  Thank you so much to the poster!

this was a pretty good recipe. i think using the correct pan would give the bread proper height. a flat pan allows the bread to spread outward(more than it should). thanks for sharing!

I needed French bread for my Bruchetta, but I had no money to buy it. This recipe made my Bruchetta an appetizer to remember (though of course it's so good you could eat it plain). I didn't have packaged yeast, so I used the kind you have to activate in a cup of warm water. I may need to use more next time though, since the middle was a little doughy. I also used 2 cups of whole wheat flour because we ran out of AP flour. This was good because although I didn't feel like I was eating real French bread, it felt healthy, and that's a plus. Also, since I only have one baking sheet, the bread was really fat, which is not French  bread, so next time I will halve the recipe or borrow another baking sheet from a friend. Then I can roll it thinner.

I used only half the recipe and made French Bread Pizzas. The bread/pizza crust was very good. Hard outside and chewy inside. *UPDATE* Used this recipe to make 1 big loaf for Mascarpone Stuffed French Toast with Peaches. It was great!

I absolutely love this recipe! It's very simple and easy! I usually halve the recipe and use about 2 1/2 cups of flour. Everything else I leave the same. I've made it with egg wash with no water. This gives a really nice crispy crust. I've also made it with an egg yolk and milk, another reviewer's suggestion. It's a softer crust but still very good. My boyfriend likes the crispy crust better, so that's the one I'll stick with. I'm never buying French bread again! Thanks!

This was my very first time ever making 'real' bread (not like batter breads like banana bread). I was really nervous so I cut the recipe in half just in case it didnt turn out I wouldnt waste that much. I followed the directions very carefully and cut a few minutes off each cooking time since I made two breads out of the half batch. I was really happy with the results. Lets just say one of the breads is already amost gone and my fiance just keeps cutting off slice after slice. This is definatley a keeper!!! Thanks for the recipe!!!

The flavor of this bread is wonderful! It tasted perfect. I'm not sure what I did wrong here but my loaves unrolled while baking. I did seal them with water. I'll be trying this again soon. Thanks!

This bread is really good, and so easy to make.  I taught my pastor's 15 year old son to make this bread, and his family loved it.  The only change I made was the egg wash on the top of the loaf.  I didn't like the egg wash, so I brushed the dough with olive oil and a pinch of salt, lightly before cooking and midway through.  The oil allowed the bread to brown and gave it a better flavor than the egg.

This is the first time I made bread from scratch. It turned out GREAT!I followed some of the other reviewers advise by increasing the salt by 1/2 teaspoon, adding soy lecithin, ginger I didn't have citric acid so I added a small amount of lemon juice, I washed it with an entire egg yolk and white after slicing the top before the second proof.  Served it with chicken and 40 cloves.My wife and mom enjoyed it, They said for it being the first time I made bread it turned out GREAT!

Wow.  This was my first crack at making homemade bread, and it was a hit.  The only thing I did different was to add some dried rosemary on top of the bread, which added a nice flavor to the crust.

Pretty good.  I made 2 loaves and a dozen buns.  Then buns turned out perfect.  I covered the loaves with a damp towel and it stuck, making my bread fall and become dense.  I usually cover all my rising dough with Saran wrap and I never have any problem.  This is a recipe I will make again for sure.

EXCELLENT crust and texture inside!!  But the bread itself was very bland tasting.....next time I'll add salt to the dough.  I also proofed the yeast in water with about 1 tbsp of honey- and then threw it into a warmed oven and went out all day to run errands.  I came back and shaped it into loaves and followed the recipe from there.  I can't wait to make it again with some salt- I think then it'll be 5 stars for sure!!

It was a wonderful recipe.  I followed the instructions and also took into account the reviews that I read.  One thing that I did do was to melt unsalted butter and combine that with the egg white and water for the egg wash.  It made a nice crispy and light brown crust.  My picky kids even ate it.

This bread turned out amazing.  I've made breads before and they've turned out ok but this recipe is perfect.  The breads I made with this are on par with what I used to buy at bakeries.  Thank you for saving me the money, now I can make my own crusty french bread!

What a wonderful recipe, so easy to make.  I don't have a bread machine or a stand mixer so I had to make it the old fashioned way, by hand.  But it didn't take long and was a snap.  Made Homemade Broccoli Cheese Soup to go with it. Yum

Tastes almost as good as the kind we had in France! I didn't use the cornmeal and it was fine. We got in a hurry to eat it and I didn't let it rise as much as it said to but it really took shape well in the oven! I had store bought french bread from a can this week and it was so nasty!! This is a simple and easy recipe!! I was confused also by the amount of yeast so it was really helpful to see what another reviewer wrote!

This turned out fantastic!!! The only changes I made was to use 5 teaspoons of yeast, additional salt, a little butter and only enough flour to make a nice dough (maybe 5 1/2 cups). Such a versatile bread too - made everything from meatball subs to grilled cheese sandwiches with it. Delicious fresh out of the oven with a little butter. I will definitely be making this often!

I did this recipe exactly as directed and it came out PERFECT. I used RapidRise yeast so I cut the rise time (just eyeballed it by size). It made two nice size loaves and they were great.

Fresh French bread is a treat so I love to make this recipe.  The made these two changes: I wet the rolled loaf with water before rolling to ensure a tight roll and I refidgerate this loaf overnight after rolling to enhance the flavor.  I usually bake bread with a sour dough starter that I have had for years, but that is a time commitment which is why I love this recipe.        I have found that refridgerating a loaf overnight gives the bread a richer flavor so when time/my preplanning permits I do it.  Try this loaf it is easy and you will love it.

Good recipe on the first try.  May give it a 4 latter if it gets better. Definitely double the salt.  The egg wash is a must.  It made the crust very crunchy.  Where I didn't apply it evenly, the crust was only so, so.  I used my stand mixer to mix and then I had it knead the dough for 5 min.  I hand kneaded for 3 minutes.  May try this again and knead just a little longer.  I also added about 5 1/4 c flour.  The only  other modification I made was to add a little sugar to the mix (2 tsp) since I only used 2 pkg of yeast.  I am in search of a bread that is really light on the inside.  This was almost it.  May reduce flour a little more.

Just ok bread. Needs lots more salt. I used 1 tsp for 1 loaf and it was not nearly enough. Also wasn't very airy. I'll keep looking.

I REALLY LIKE THIS RECIPE.I DID LIKE ONE OF THE OTHER COOKS AND ADDED ONLY 5 1/4 C FLOUR AND PROOFED THE YEAST WITH SOME SUGAR BEFORE MIXING THE INGREDIENTS TOGETHER.THE ONLY THING I WOULD CHANGE WOULD VE TO ADD MORE SALT.THANKS FOR THE RECIPE.

I tried REALLY hard to get this right. This was my first attempt at baking bread. I read all the reviews but my bread taste more like ciabatta bread. Not bad but the loaf doesn't look right either.

FABULOUS! I could not believe how well this turned out.  I am not experienced in bread making at all and this turned out amazing, just like from the bakery.  I followed some adivce from others and put 5 tsp yeast with 1 tbsp honey & 1tsp sugar in the warm water for 7 minutes first, then added to the flour.  I also let it rise the first time for about 1.5 hours.  I divided the dough in 4 loaves instead of 2, and therefore decreased the baking time by about 10-12 minutes.  I also used my toaster oven so that may also be why I cooked it for a shorter amount of time.
Chewy outside, Soft inside, fluffy - fantastic!

Yummy. I added 1/2 tsp more of salt and used my kitchenaid to mix and knead. It was a cinch and came out perfect. I didn't have any eggs, so I didn't brush the top with egg white. Still came out crispy and crunchy on the outside and tender and chewy on the inside. I did throw in a handful of ice cubes while the bread was baking which may have helped crisp up the crust without the egg/water mixture. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

This recipe is excellent! I would suggest adding a little more salt than the recipe calls for. In addition to bread, the dough can be made into dinner rolls, which are delicious and easier to serve that a loaf.

Really very good.  I started with 5 Cups of flour and kneaded in about 1/2 C to make a perfect balance between a typical french and a more dense artisian bread. I also added 2 T of butter and doubled the salt giving greater flavor.  Topped with coarse salt and sesame seed. A great basic recipe to build from.  I gave one loaf to my neigbor and they loved it!

I wish I knew what happened but I did not care for this bread.  I made it twice just to be fair and both times it was flat and unattractive.  The texture was off.

This is amazing!!!  There I was with a hot pad in one hand and a knife in another cutting the first slice.  I couldn't wait longer than the .2 seconds it took to get it out of the oven.  I only brushed the top with egg, and I do agree that the longer you let it rise the fluffier inside it gets.  Mine needed a little more time than what was given in the recipie.

I made this yesterday, and served with World's Best Lasagana(recipe off this site). The bread was perfect..crunchy on the outside, and soft on the inside. I served with garlic butter. Will definitely make again! Thanks for sharing.

Soo good! I made and gave out as Christmas gifts to neighbors - They loved it!! 

If you want to make smaller loaves you can even divide into three. 

I usually use my bread machine - but it was a nice project to work on with the kids, too.

The bread was okay, but it doesn't remind me of french breadat all. I wouldn't eat this loaf cold, it was only enjoyable fresh out of the oven. The taste is pretty bland. the bread is way too dense and yeasty. Next time I will try adding a bit of sugar, less flour, and letting it rise another round before baking it. Until then, still looking for a French bread recipe.

I added a pinch of rosemary into the dough, and had enough to fashion them into 4 good sized bread bowls.  The combination of the bread and my broccoli cheese soup (recipe V on this website), was simply divine.

This recipe makes a HUGE loaf which is perfect for my family.  I gave this recipe four stars because the first time I made it, it tasted yeasty and bland.  I did try again and followed a couple of suggestions from other reviews and now I make it all the time.

Oh. My. Gosh.  This creates a spectacular tasting bread...perfectly chewy on the inside yet crusty on the out.  I used the suggestion of another reviewer and used my crock pot as a means for the bread to rise - worked fabulously.  Just had a hunk of this for lunch and I cannot wait to make it again.  Thanks for making me feel as though I am a baking extraordinaire!

WOW - What a great recipe – followed the directions exactly (didn’t proof the yeast – normally I do) this bread was so great, I couldn’t believe I actually made it. 
The only thing I didn’t do was brush the top, because I wanted a crisp crust
I cooked it on a pizza stone. Crust was awesome, inside was moist
This will become a family favorite for sure. 
Thanks Jenn for posting the recipe
Made it for lunch with homemade beef stew.

This is a great recipe.  Very easy for bread.  A suggestion I have is to roll out the dough and make like a pizza.  Roll it up and bake it.  I have done it with pepperoni, tomato sauce & cheese.  I have also done it with a sundried tomato & artichoke paste I made.  Comes out like a foccacia bread.

very good bread. great fresh out of the oven, and just as good sliced and toasted.  i made a half a recipe since it's just me eating, and made two smaller loaves with it.
i also found that 6 cups of flour was too much--just about 5 cups worked out well for me.  i also used one cup of water and one cup of whey (leftover from some homemade ricotta).  delish!

The bread itself turned out perfectly, the crust was that delightful crispy texture but without being crunchy, and the bread itself was just that little bit chewy, perfectly textured for French bread.  While that turned out great, I found that the bread itself was a little bland and tasteless.  I think with a little tweaking and a few additional ingredients for flavour, this bread would be perfect.

I will definitely be adding it to my repitoire and experiment with it.  than you very much for the lovely recipe.

This was so good! I made this, and turned it into"parmesan garlic bread" from this site. I took advice from another reviewer, and mixed 1 egg yolk, and 1 tbls. milk to brush over top before baking. Very delicious recipe, thanks!

This is the first time I've ever made the bread. Everyone in my family loved it. The recipe is simple and easy. After removing the pan from the oven, i covered it with foil and damp cloth like some other reviewers said. The bread was so crunchy and chewy/soft in the inside. I made two loaves. They are delicious! a good recipe to keep. Thanks for the recipe and thanks to other reviewers for some wonderful tips.

Nice texture, and good flavour. I proofed my yeast first, as I always do! I halved the recipe because I just needed enough to make cheese bread. It turned out very nicley.

I made a half recipe for one loaf and found that it didn't need as much flour. This was tasty but didn't really seem like french bread. Still, yummy bread in general.

I did this in my bread machine set on the Dough cycle.  After it was done, I put it in a bowl to rise or if you only want to make 2 loaves just leave in and finish rising on the dough cycle.  I then proceeded to make the loaves and bake in the oven.  Great results!  I have a bad shoulder and this saves me all the kneading and I can make the traditional torpedo shaped loaves.

Is not exactly the french bread texture I am used too, more dense than fluffy, but still good. Made one into garlic bread and served with the Spaghetti and Marinara Sauce recipe from this site. I initially froze the other loaf but ended up taking it down the next week!

I thought this came out very well and my family agreed. It was a bit dense but not too bad. I sprinkled a bit of sea salt on top halfway through cooking, probably not french but it was still pretty good.

This bread is the closest to french baguette I made, but it still not *it*. I heard it has to be baked in a steam oven, so I placed some ice cubes on the bottom of the oven. The rack wasn't long enough, so the bread ended up too high and didn't cook all the way in the middle. Be sure to make it quite long. As a bread, it's very good, but it's not quite a baguette.

This bread was easy to make but a little on the bland side. I sliced it up, buttered the pieces, sprinkled on garlic salt, oregano and parmesan cheese and broiled it for a few minutes and it turned out very tasty.

Ok I tried King Arthurs, Julia Baking Cookbook, Marthas etc...THIS RECIPE WORKED!!!  I use the 1Lb yeast sold at BJ's Costco, Sams...and I think that yeast is QUICK RISE.  When I only used one proofing I got a GREAT loaf.  (other recipes call for two proofings..if you get "wet dough" or small risings then its the yeast and use only ONE proofing) Great Recipe

My sister-in-law said this was the best bread she'd ever had...and my mother-in-law liked it so much she asked me to make a couple loafs for her birthday. By the way, I tried adding a half-cup of cinnimon & sugar to the dough right after rolling it out, but before rolling up the loafs and it came out great!

This turned out great!  Very easy to make and very impressive to serve.  My husband thought for sure I had purchased it. I never thought home-made breads could be so easy.

A decent recipe but I'm still looking for that perfect one.  I think the key to getting the bread closer to perfection is to use one of those perforated bread pans.  Although, I haven't tried it yet.

This turned out fantastic.  The aroma was wonderful and it tasted better than store bought. Just make sure you grease the paper well, because if the bread touches it ungreased, it sticks.

I found this recipe to be WAY to yeasty.  The yeast was all I could taste.  I'm a relatively new cook, but I don't know many breads that use 2 and a half packets of yeast.  Would just one work?  Even though my boyfriend and me didn't really like it, our friend did, so maybe it's just us

I halved this recipe and made one loaf last night. The only thing I did differently from the recipe was to disolve the yeast in the warm water and then place it and the remaining ingredients in my bread machine to let it knead the bread for the recommended 10 minutes. I then placed the dough ball in an oiled bowl to rise and finished it out as the recipe stated. The bread is(was)delicious!! My picky teenage daughter loved it and ate several slices today with cream cheese spread on it. It turned out just as described: crunchy outside and a good chewy interior. The only problem I had was when I covered the formed loaf with a damp kitchen towel for the final rise, the towel stuck to it. Other than that, it turned out perfect. To soften the crust, I placed the baked loaf (still warm) into a large ziplock bag. Thanks for a great recipe!!
