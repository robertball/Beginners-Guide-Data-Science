This did not work at all for me.  It was way too thick, with pumpkin being the only flavor.  

I ended up making a lot of changes last minute.  I adding at least another carton of broth, some brown sugar and an entire pint of half and half.  Once everything was said and done, I got a lot of compliments.  The small pieces of garlic and onion were wonderful.

I will make this again.  But with the changes mentioned.

Amt. are not right 3 cans of Pumpkin (29 Oz)total 87 oz, versus 32 oz. of broth -fluid. Soup way too thick even after adding 2/3 cup of cream. Added milk until it was the right consistency. Used cream cheese instead of cream.

Completely awesome!  I used a block of cream cheese instead of the cream (that's what I had in the house at the time), which worked ok, but I'm making it again tomorrow with cream and am looking forward to it.  This is a hit!

I made this soup with a fresh pumpkin, I cut into half, deseeded and rubbed with melted butter, then baked for about 40 minutes until golden. I scooped out the pumpkin and and combined with the broth. I also added a cut up and roasted ruderbager for a extra bite of flavor as pumpkin is a very lightly flavor vegetable once baked.  I had my doubts about the flavor when I first made this soup. I made in the morning and reheated it that evening and all the flavors had blended together.  It was wonderful.

Made as stated in the recipe. This was not one of those slightly sweet coconutty pumpkin soups, I like those, but this isn't that.  It was great comfort food, kind of a potato soup.  I served with a spoon of greek yogurt on top and a dash of chili powder.  At the table, I had to salt it, but hubby did not.  I might play around and season it up some more next time, but it is good wholesome food as is.

The quantities are wrong. It came out like paste. I dumped in a couple cups of milk and water to make it more like soup. Also I did not care for the seasonings.

I made this recipe 2 ways...the first time I used the quantity of pumpkin listed and the second time I used  3 cans of 15 ounces each. Both were tasty but the first version was definitely too thick and was more like eating butternut squash than soup.  The second batch was wonderful and perfect for a cold winter day and made the house smell amazing!

I made this yesterday and my family loved it! I used the pumpkin puree we had in the freezer and I eliminated the ham. We had baby bella mushrooms so I sweated those in the pan with the garlic and onions as a type of meat replacement. I used low sodium chicken broth, but and had to really salt the soup time get the flavors to develop. I also added about a teaspoon of fresh ginger, since we had it, in addition to the spices suggested. I used half and half and added a little more at the end to thin it out, but even my soup hating sister liked it! Oh, it may have been our puree but I the pumpkin would sink to the bottom so I whisked it vigorously during the cooking and before serving it. Another sister said it reminded her of pumpkin soups she'd had in Jamaica. Thanks for the recipe!

Great result however I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin. Everything else the same and it was delicious and consistency was not to think but not to watery. Thank you!
