These are fantastic.  I don't know anyone who can eat only one helping...very addicting.  I prefer to make mine in the crockpot so they don't burn.  The texture seems to be better as well this way.

This turned out very well.  I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I think I might substitute drained black beans for the butter beans for a more interesting color contrast.

This was much too sweet for my family's liking. The catsup is already sweetened ao a cup of brown sugar is too much. I think 1/2 cup would have been better. Also, the bacon is a nice addition but if I make this again I will fry it first then brown the beef in the bacon drippings and add the crumbled bacon to the dish just before serving.

Good beans! Great taste, easy to throw together and very inexpensive. I made a few minor changes based on what I had on hand and personal taste. First of all, I cooked the bacon alone untill it was browned, then I added the onion and ground beef. I know from past experience that cooking the bacon with the ground beef makes for bacon that is too underdone for our taste.We like it very done. Next, I did not have kidney beans or butter beans, so I used black beans and pinto beans instead. (I think almost any bean combo would work.) I also cut the amount of brown sugar in half and am glad I did as it was plenty sweet for our taste with 1/2 C. Next, I didn't have mustard powder so I used 1T yellow mustard,also had no white wine vinegar so I used plain white vinegar, omited the celery and added a little liquid smoke to the mix aprox 1-2t. I do not own a 4 quart casserole, so I just simmered it on the stove for aprox 1 1/2 hrs. I served this with sweet corn bread and we had a very tasty meal! I will definitely make this again and again. My picky husband even gave it the thumbs up! Thanks Kathy! Note..I give this recipe 5 stars only after cutting back on the brown sugar, I personaly think that 1 C would have been way too sweet. I would advise adding only 1/2 C, then taste before adding more.

I made this recipe exactly, and thought it was just ok.  This is something that I would probably only make twice a year.  I probably won't use celery next time.  I might just use less brown sugar next time too because it was very sweet.  My boyfriend said it tasted like pork and beans with meat.  My other friend who ate it put sour cream in it, my guess was because it was so sweet, but I'm not for sure.  I didn't ask him what that tasted like though.  I'm usually a big eater, but I was only able to eat one bowl of this, and not even a full bowl. We did eat all that I had made though.  I'll try it again sometime with a couple changes.

Years ago I worked with a really good friend and for every potluck she brought these beans.  I loved them so much it was usually all I ate at the potluck.  As written this recipe is the bomb so meat eaters try it, you will love it.  Since then i have become a vegetarian. So is my son and kinda picky so here is what i did to tweak it for us.  No ground beef, used 1 cup tvp. No pork in beans, just veggie baked beans. No ketchup (my son hates it), so drained a can of diced tomatoes, pured and used 1/2 cup of that.  No bacon and for the smoky flavor I used 4 chilpolte peppers in adobo sauce, pured. My son also hates mustard of any kind so for that mustard tang i used1 small can of diced green chilis.  I also used apple cider vinegar because I love it better than white. Everything else was the same as the original recipe.  Yes, that was major tweaking on this otherwise awesome recipe but WOW!  It came out very very yummy.  For you veggie peoples give this tweaked version a try :-)

Delicious! I used less sugar and malt vinegar because I didn't have white wine vinegar. No celery & I only had hormel bacon pieces. Thanks for sharing!

A budget-friendly family favorite.  However, I do make it a wee bit more economical by starting with dry beans, and cooking them in water with a ham bone from our last ham dinner.  Once the beans are cooked, I remove the bone and let it cool.   In the mean time, I place the beans in my crock pot with all of the standard ingredients, sometimes going lighter on the ground beef and bacon.  Once the ham bone cools, I remove any usable meat from the bone and put it in with the beans.  Let it cook for several hours on low.   The dry beans don't have the additives that canned beans have, so its a bit healthier, and I usually get enough tasty meat from a ham bone that the family doesn't notice that I used less bacon and hamburger.  A win for everyone.

My mom used to make this when I was a child, only her recipe was labeled "One Pot Dinner". This is a phenomenal dish for those winter months.   I do believe that the 2 cups of brown sugar are bit much, and use half of that and it's plenty sweet enough.  Mom always added just a wee bit of liquid smoke to it, and I find it so much better that way. I suppose you could substitute your favorite bbq sauce for the ketchup for the same effect.   I make it in the crockpot, on low for 4 hours or so; it's a HUGE hit at potluck suppers or barbecues :)

Excellent recipe. I loved it and I don't even like "regular" baked beans. I will make this often for picnics or large gatherings.

This recipe was good and easy.  I used a package of the pre-cooked bacon instead of cooking it with my ground beef.  After ground beef was cooked, I put it all in a crockpot and let it cook for a couple of hours.  I wouldn't see any reason why it couldn't cook all day either.  I might try cutting back a tad on the brown sugar because it was a little sweet, still very good though.

The absolute easiest base recipe.  I have cooked as written (which is great, although a bit sweet for our taste) and also changed everything from the amounts, the type of meat, how its cooked and the kind of beans and I've always had it turn out great. (Always use baked beans, though.) Some suggestions for alternates: use shredded roast in place of hamburger, use full cup of brwn sugar but exchange tomato sauce for ketchup, use sausage and 1 lb bacon.  You really can change this recipe to totally suit your family's taste or to make it a sidedish instead of the main dish.  Also, it freezes well: put leftovers in ziplock baggie to freeze- pop in microwave or heat on stovetop for quick meal. THANK YOU!!!!!

I found this recipe in an attempt to replace a misplaced family favorite we called "Carnival Beans."  This one was very close to our recipe and only required a few changes to fit the taste we remember.  I omitted the bacon, beef and celery.  I increased the dried mustard to one tablespoon.  I swapped the small can of pork-n-beans for a large can of vegetarian baked beans.  Not that it makes much of a difference, but I used apple cider vingear instead of white.  I also added one small can of chili beans.  Everyone was pleased with the outcome!  Thanks, Kathy!

Really great basic recipe you tweak to your liking. I usually omit the butter beans (hate them) and double up on the kidney beans. It's a bit sweet made as written so I also cut back on the sugar. Really good if you add some garlic powder and a bit of paprika too. My 22 month old loves it with steamed rice. Thanks, Kathy!

Excellent, but far too sweet for our tastes. No big deal though, I just cut the sugar in half and it was so good. You can throw any beans you want in and it's always good. Family wants this at all the BBQ's. Thanks Kathy

This was very good! I made several changes so I know it's hardly fair to rate it but here goes... I used one can of chili beans, one can of kidney beans, one can of black beans and one can of great northern beans. I sauteed the onion with the ground beef. I let the meat cook a little before I added the onion so I wouldn't need to add any oil for the onion. I only used 3/4 cup of sugar and eliminated the bacon. I'm sure the bacon would have put it over-the-top amazing, but I didn't want to bother to defrost a whole package from my freezer to use a little here. I will be making this again. Very tasty!!

I make this for all our family gatherings by request and my family loves it.  I mix the beans up sometimes when I can't find the exact beans it calls for.  I have noticed that brand name pork and beans lend a better flavor than the generic ones.

TASTY! These were a huge hit at Easter Dinner! (I accidentally rated the wrong Calico Beans recipe - ignore my other one!) This is the one!!! There was hardly any left over! I did brown the bacon first, and then the hamburger and onions together. Made exactly as stated and it was a wonderful alternative to the usualy baked beans! Everyone went back for 2nds! Thanks for the post!

Wow!   WAY TOO SWEET!!!   1.  I needed to stretch this recipe so I added 2 more cans of beans.  2.  Based on other reviews, I halved the brown sugar.   Even with the extra beans 1/2 C brown sugar was too much.  3.  1/2 C ketchup also seems to be too much.  Too ketchupy.  4.  As far as I can tell, Lima beans and butter beans are the same thing (ingredients list on the back of can of butter beans says "Lima beans"!).  This was particularly confusing as the recipe wants me to drain the Lima beans, but not the butter beans!!!   :-)

The best baked beans we've ever had.  Took them to a party last night and got rave reviews.  Instead of baking, i made them early and put them in a crockpot for 6 hours.

Really, really good!  Made exactly as stated...I thought it odd at first that this could be something that you could bring to Thanksgiving, a cookout or a pot luck....but it really is just that kind of a dish!  My son said it was the "bestest" meal I ever made!

Awesome! My husband swears this tastes just like his grandmother's cherished family recipe. I have also made this with a mixed variety of beans, always with success.

This recipe is identical to my grandma's recipe that I have been eating for over 25 years (minus the celery). Very good. I make this for all the yard parties I have in the summer and always get asked for the recipe.  You can use most any combination of beans when making it, not just the ones listed. If you use kidney beans make sure to drain and rinse them. I have made them in the oven, on the grill, a crock pot, and even my smoker  and they turn out great no matter how you cook them!

LOVE THIS! A friend brought these to a picnic we threw a few years back. She wouldn't give up the recipe, so I logged on and came across this. It is exact! I've been making ever since and everyone loves them. I also cut back on the sugar and add a bit more vinegar and  mustard powder. I also usually leave out the celery, and use butter beans, cannellini beans, baked beans, and black beans. This is a bean dish, folks, it's supposed to be 'beany' and it's a side dish... Great at a barbecue for potluck. It is too sweet for a just a heaping bowl of it. It's best then next day, also. I am requested to bring this to many summer picnics. Love it!

Easy, excellent, and inexpensive to prepare for a gathering. Always-- I take home an empty pot, and i double recipe for potlucks. (I take in a crock pot to keep warm.) Very pleasing to the plate and tummy! Will keep on making for years to come. A meal alone with a green salad!!

OH MY!  Everyone in the family LOVED these beans.  I made a double batch for Christmas Day and they were gone the next day.  It can be a meal be itself. I precooked the bacon and ground beef the night before, so in the morning it put everything in the crockpot and let it cook for three hours, then put it on low for the rest of the day.  They ate them all day long.

This is a great recipe for calico beans.  I did use pinto beans instead of lima and butter beans.  I decreased the brown sugar to one half cup and that was perfect for our taste.  I baked these at 325 degrees for almost two hours.  They are always even better the next day.  Great recipe Kathy.  Thank you.

I just made this and it is very very sweet.  I recommend you start with a 1/3 cup of brown sugar (and if you need more, add sugar sparingly).

I LOVE this recipe! I must have made this 100 times by now (don't know why I didn't rate this sooner) and each time I make it I get compliments and requests for the recipe.  About 2 years ago, my hubby went vegetarian so now I make this without the meat and bacon and it still is a huge hit!   It's nice to make and bring something that both vegetarians and others can both enjoy!  I make this at least once every 2 weeks for him in his recipe rotation and he (we) never tire of it.  Try this recipe!   Oh, and I use whatever beans I have on hand - as long as you use the pork and beans (or baked beans) the rest of the beans can be any combination and it always tastes great!

Addicting!  We reduced the sugar and added a bit more smoke flavor and upped the vinegar just a bit for more zing.  Get's rave reviews every time.

Great!  I omitted the celery and pork and beans, and used cans of kidney, lima, pinto and black-eyed peas.  I also added a little more bacon, and some of our favorite Rudy's BBQ sauce, great for BBQ get togethers!

Loved it!  This recipe seems universally popular for potlucks, etc. I love it because it's so easy to make.  It can be a little sweet, but you can always adjust the sugar as you need to.

This has always been a favorite of mine! I did change a few ingrediants, though. We are trying to reduce our cholesterol, so I used ground chicken instead beef. It was delicious and barely changed the taste. Next time I will try turkey bacon instead of pork. I also added 2 Tbsp. of Molasses and 1 cup of ketchup. I accidentally opened black beans instead of kidney beens. I think any combination of beans work, but don't ever leave out the butter beans! Everyone who had a serving enjoyed thoroughly.

This was good - but I did have to make quite a few changes. I used a 1/2 lb. of bacon - so not sure if that equals to a 1/2 cup or not. I also added an additional can of pork and beans. I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, reduced the vinegar to 2 tablespoons (and used apple cider vinegar), increased the mustard powder to 1/2 tablespoon and added a teaspoon of salt. I omitted the celery. I sautéed the bacon for a bit on it's own first and then added the ground beef and onion. I mixed up the sauce in a separate bowl. Then, I added everything to a 13 x 9 x 2" baking dish and combined it. Covered it and baked for an hour as stated. Making it this way, I LOVED it! Thanks for sharing something I could build off of.

Made this for the 4th of July! So far today (the next day), I have had 3 people email me for the recipe! It is great! I used a combo of butter beans, great northern beans, pork and beans and light kidney beans. Next time I would probably use black beans instead of the butter beans for a little more visual contrast. I also added a little splash of liquid smoke to give them a more smokey taste. I cooked them uncovered and really enjoyed the "crust" that formed on top.  This recipe is a definite keeper! Thank you!

I made this for a large group of friends over the weekend.  Everyone loved it!  I made it in the crockpot, as suggested.  I couldn't find the butter beans I purchased,(the boy child helped unload the groceries) and I left out the celery and onion intentionally because so many people don't care for them.  This is my new favorite side to my BBQ meals.  I will, however, make it next time with the butter beans.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I made this over the weekend and it turned out really well.  As per other's suggestions, I subbed black beans for the lima beans.  I also added chili powder and Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning to give it a little heat.  Without the heat I think the recipe would have been too sweet for us.  I cooked it on low in the crock pot all day.  Easy and good, thanks!

I have been looking for this recipe for years now and I found it! My mom used to make this, but like her other recipes, it was in her head and she is gone now (please write down your family favorites for your children). I saw other Calico Bean recipes but none of them where like hers.  This one is perfect. 

I make it with dried beads (except for the Port and Beans) and it never lasts. A miracle since my family hates beans any other way.

This was one of my favorite dishes to eat as a kid, but I hadn't had it in years and years until I tried this recipe. What a nostalgic trip for my tastebuds! My mom would take calico beans to picnics and potlucks and now I do, too. I don't always add the ground meat (I use turkey when I do) or the bacon in case my vegetarian friends are joining us or if I am serving the beans on the side. I also add roughly 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1/4ish tsp of celery salt if I don't have fresh celery on hand. Otherwise, I make it as is and enjoy it every time!

This recipe is very good.  It was a little sweet the first time I made it so I used 1 cup ketchup and 1/2 cup brown sugar the next time I made it. My husband really enjoyed it and he doesn't really care for beans.  This is a keeper!

I found this waaaaay too sweet for my taste. I would definitely cut the brown sugar back to 1/3 or even 1/4 cup, add more vinegar and swap 1/2 of the ketchup for tomato sauce.  Worth making again for sure and it is easy to tweak it to your personal taste.

I have made this since I was a very young woman. I use whatever cans of beans I have on hand. Usually, pork & beans, kidney beans & chili beans unless I see something at market that looks interesting. I use way less brown sugar about a TBLSP. I use a tsp or two of vinegar & the rest the same. Perfect on cold winter nights with corn bread & fried potatoes.

Holy cow!!  This was way too sweet!!!  I've made this twice now: first time as per the recipe, and the second time, I cut the sugar to half a cup and it was still really sweet.  Will make again, but next time, the sugar is getting cut to a 1/4 cup.

Better with chili sauce as opposed to ketchup and use less sugar.  Omitted celery and added 1 C. chopped onion.  Cooked bacon then cooked onion in bacon fat.   Also, there is so much liquid from the beans that I baked it uncovered.

I don't use the hamburger only a pound of bacon and once I'm done frying the bacon I pour off some of the grease and add all the other ingredients to the pan . The grease gives it a little extra flavor. I also add a little extra brown sugar. I have people requesting my beans for parties all the time. I think the hamburger gives it a weird texture and flavor! Try it this way u might like it!!

I made these when I needed to get something in the crockpot quick.  I used a ring of polska kielbasa instead of burger and bacon.  Only used a can of baked beans and the lima and butter beans.  Added no brown sugar at all, not needed, and just a squirt of ketchup.  This was good and I will make again in a foil pan to throw on the bbq when camping.

Good overall, but overly sweet for our tastes... Even with the use of the recommendations to halve the brown sugar and use tomato sauce instead of ketchup.  I found myself adding chilie powder to give it some other flavor but SWEET, but it was still just OK.

Due to popular demand, I make these beans for both Easter (they go great with ham, deviled eggs, and potato salad) and my family reunion every year. The only thing I do differently is cut the brown sugar by about half. Great recipe!

I made a double batch in a crockpot for a family party-it was a great hit!  To keep it vegetarian, I omitted the pork&beans, hamburger and bacon and added black beans and 2 tsp liquid smoke.  I also cut down the brown sugar by 25% due to reviews that said it was too sweet.  Definitely will make again.

This is excellent. I actually made some changes due to personal preference, but 5 stars to this one. Instead of lima beans, I use great northern beans. I added a can of pinto beans, as well. The only other change I made was I omitted the celery and sauteed the onion in the bacon/beef grease. Again, personal preference. Give this one a try!

I could have done cartwheels when I tasted this! I took other's advice and used black beans for a more calico look. Did not use pork and beans tho. My husband (who hates baked beans) begrudgingley tried these....and LOVED them!!

This is delicious and hearty bean dish.  I decreased the amount of brown sugar to 1/2 cup & the vinegar to 2 Tablespoons and added a can of black beans to the mixture.  By decreasing the sugar the falvor of the beans come through.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the alterations I made.

This casserole, with a pan of "Golden Sweet Cornbread" (also from this site), is one of my husband's favorite suppers. I often omit the bacon to reduce fat and calories, and it's still delicious!

this is a great recipe...i did modify it somewhat though...i doubled most of the ingredients, slow cooked it in a crock pot, added hot sauce, used black beans instead of lima beans and added a little seasoning salt and cayenne pepper.  I also added two cans of diced tomatos.  Its great if you life spicy foods.  To make it even tastier, sprinkle shredded cheddar cheese or lay a slice of pepperjack cheese on top of the chili when you put it in a bowl to eat.  I also used the sweet corn bread recipe on this site to go with it.  My friends, roommate and family beg me to make this recipe constantly.

I love this recipe. My grandma makes it a lot and I got it from here once and it is almost exactly like this one except no celery.

What I like to do though is not include the bacon and the ground beef and use ground turkey instead. In my opinion ALL The flavor comes from the beans, ketchup, spices, and sugar. You usually can't even tell the bacon is there and the meat is just a textural element, so might as well make it significantly helping there by getting rid of those two things. 

It also makes it easier to make if you leave out the bacon since you don't have to mess with it. I just brown the turkey and dump everything in the crockpot, it can cook all day. In fact I like it better after it HAS cooked all day.

These beans are great, I always make a double batch!  Since I double the recipe, I do drain one of the cans of butter beans so as to not have them too runny. I brown the hamburger and then mix all the ingredients in a large bowl. Because all the ingredients (besides the hamburger) are "ready to eat" I put it in my crockpot set on low heat and forget about it until I'm ready to serve. This has seemed to work well for me and the consistency has always been perfect, not soupy and not stucco like; just perfect!  This is a great recipe for a family gatherings or when you need that perfect side dish.

This was really good.  I took the advice of a couple of the other reviews and cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 cup.  Everyone loved it and had a second helping.  Will most definitely make this one again...thanks!

This was a good recipe and the kids really liked it.  It was a nice improvement to baked beans, and it turned out quite colorful.  Never thought I'd eat a lima bean, but I got the baby ones and they tasted pretty good.

This is such a crowd pleaser.  My stand-by for pot lucks at work.  I mix it all together in a crockpot. Bring it to work and turn it on. By lunch, it is perfect and never any left!!
Thanks

This is a very delicious recipe for baked beans.  I left out the ground beef and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup a couple of times.  I have had to take copies of the recipe with me because I get so many requests.  This is a keeper.

This was SO SO SO yummy. I sautéed the onions and boiled the celery to make it soft (that’s the only way my kids will eat it). And i used 3/4 cup of dark brown sugar and about 1/3 cup of ketchup so it would be just a little bit less sweet.  Those are the only changes I made. It came out sooooo good. Served it with some yellow cornbread

I've been making this recipe for years, and was glad to find it here on All Recipes. It has a wonderful sweet/savory blend of flavors that's just fantastic. My entire family loves it.
I do make it with a couple of tweaks. Typically, I also add a can of drained green beans and a can of drained wax beans. Really, any type of beans will work in this casserole! I also use just regular white vinegar, and often substitute prepared mustard for the mustard powder.
A really hearty, fiber-filled dinner option!

I make this every time we have our annual Women’s weekend. All the ladies love it and this year it was requested by my niece, she wanted to be sure I wasn’t making anything else. It is well loved and eaten by all. It’s absolutely the easiest and tastiest bean recipe I’ve every tried. Nutritionally, beans are very high in protein so, have at it everyone!

I made these as a replacement for Boston style baked beans to accompany BBQ Ribs. Just wanted something different, these fit the bill perfectly. I deleted the ground beef and added a can of great northern beans I had on hand, I made no other changes. These were a big hit with everyone at the gathering. They were a little soupier after baking the first hour covered than I really wanted them to be so I baked them another 30 minutes uncovered and the consistency was perfect. We all love all kinds of beans  so next time I may add more kinds of beans, but that will be the only changes I make, these will be added to the rotation as a Casserole with the ground beef but also as a substitute for other baked beans. Very versatile recipe, loved it.

I made this two different ways...one regular and one veg. I used large butter, black bean with jalapeno and lime, vegetarian baked beans and cannellini all undrained mixed in a bowl. One pot  had 3 strips bacon that had been browned then removed, then added beef, onion and celery including tops! The other pot I heated EVOO and added the onion and celery …. browned everything in each pot....followed by half the bean mixture to each. I used BBQ for the veg version ( wishing I had liquid smoke )and half BBQ and ketchup for the other, red wine vinegar because it was low and I'm trying to use it up and mustard powder. ( I added a little extra ketchup and mustard powder to the meat version because the man is a fan of both). Also, chopped the cooked bacon and threw it in the meat pot.  I did not add any sugar because I was making sweet cornbread....I simmered on the stove covered for ease of preparation. This is fantastic!! Thank you Kathy!!!!

This recipe is yummy and preferable compared to other Calico Bean recipes. The Lima beans contrast nicely against the sauce and kidney beans. I reduced the sugar to half a cup. The white wine vinegar adds a unique tartness to the dish. Can be used as a main dish and goes nicely with raw vegetables or a green salad.

I made it in one cast iron pot.  Cooked hamburger and bacon; drained, then added other ingredients.  A little sweat.  Next time I might use only 1/2 cup brown sugar.

I was about to give this a "menh" rating, because it was so flat tasting. Then I realized our cans of beans are 19oz, not 15oz. Extra beans need extra sauce. Bumped up everything in the sauce by another half recipe. Added 1/2 cup smoky Bbq sauce instead of more ketchup, and 1/4 cup of maple syrup instead of brown sugar (3/4 cup brown sugar used). Used prepared mustard instead of dry mustard (2tbsp). Added 1/2 cup of red peppers.  Very happy with the results!  Next time I'll use one less can of beans, so I won't have to tinker with the sauce so much.

This recipe was so easy to make and soooo good. I took it to a family potluck and it received great reviews. I'll be making this one again. I followed the recipe and did not make any adjustments, there was no need.

Super tasty. I followed the other recommendations to decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup and I'm very glad I did.

The end result tastes good. If I make it again, I would cut the bacon into smaller pieces that what I did this time. The hamburger cooked faster than the bacon. I did not think this recipe was too sweet.

This has become one of my go to recipes and we all find it delicious. I follow the recipe to the T. Occasionally I cut the amount brown sugar. I hope you like it as much as we do.

I made this with two changes based on other reviews.  I decreased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and omitted the lima beans.  We liked it, just not sure what to serve with it.

I don't think I know anyone who doesn't like this. It's our favorite dish to have with burgers. It's even great in day two or three if there's any left.

I like to cook the bacon separately so it is crisp and then crumble it into the recipe. I always use garbanzo beans and either baby butter or baby lima beans (if I can find them). I have used white kidney beans and or navy beans in a pinch .  I like the light red kidneys better than the dark.  Be sure to add the vinegar so the beans break down a little & flavors mix. Always a big hit and my husband requests them often.

As other reviewers have said before me, you can mix any beans & achieve a great dish.  I didn't have all the beans listed - I used northern beans, pinto beans, a can of mixed beans & baked beans.  I also replaced ketchup with tomato sauce & some sausage for the bacon.  I cooked it all in a crock pot.  The recipe is not something I would ever have tried but it popped up when I was looking for something else.  I read quite a few of the reviews and decided to go with what I had to make it as close to the recipe as possible.  Really glad I did.  I'll be making it again with all the ingredients as listed.  Thanks to the poster.

Far too sweet. I doubled everything in this recipe except I reduced the brown sugar to 11/2 cups instead of the 2 cups it should have had.  I suggest 1/2 cup brown sugar for a single recipe - other than sweetness it was good.

Turned out great but I made a few changes...I switched up the beans and used only 3 cans...black beans, cannelloni and pinto. I substituted rice wine vinegar for the white wine vinegar, used regular mustard instead of mustard powder and eliminated the celery completely. It turned out perfectly, not watery but just right. I served it with a loaf of freshly baked bread and the family loved it.  Economy wise it was also fairly cheap, I only used 1/2 pkg bacon and everything else I had on hand! Great potluck recipe too!

This is close to a recipe used by my mother years ago.  I was happy to find it because she never wrote hers down.
This is a VERY good recipe as-is, however the next time I make it I will cut back on the brown sugar by about half and add some sort of hot sauce.  I used Sriracha on it after my first taste and enjoyed the kick it gave it, but that may be too hot or garlicy for some.   You would have to be careful not to 'over sauce' this however as there was still quite a bit of liquid (soupy) when done.  Maybe cut the ketchup in half and replace with Franks or Sriracha and cook the last 10 or 15 mins uncovered on lowest oven rack.
Regardless, even if you make it as the recipe calls for, it's excellent and my entire family asked why I had never made it before.  They loved it.

I'd give it a four & a half if I could.  Tasty and easy, but definitely too much brown sugar.   I exchanged the large butter beans for black beans, which I think was a good move.  I will for sure make again with a few adjustments.

I love this recipe... full flavor and easy... I usually don't use the ground beef.  I love to put extra bacon.  I cook the bacon out very crispy so as not to add the fat, just the flavor.

We make this with pork for our Christmas lunch/dinner each year. It's a great recipe if you leave out the brown sugar and celery, especially if you are not partial to sweet beans.

I've made this several times.  Always a little different depending on what is in my kitchen. This time I substituted ham for bacon and added a healthy teaspoon of liquid smoke.  I cook it covered on top of the stove on low heat for an hour and let it sit overnight.  Yum!

This was a big hit at our family reunion yesterday. I doubled the recipe and after browning the burger and onions together, I combined it all in the crock pot, set it on high for 2 hours to get it going, then set on low the next 2 hrs. It was perfect in time for the reunion, and I had 3 people ask me for the recipe. The only thing I left out was the celery because I'm not a big fan of it. My 3 guys were a bit disappointed there weren't any leftovers to take home! I will make this as a main dish at home again because its tasty, very filling and especially very economical!

This recipe is so good! I make it without the lima beans (I hate them) and celery (my husband hates it) and substitute apple cider vinegar for regular vinegar because that is all I buy. I make this for dinner at least every few weeks and serve with cornbread and take it to potlucks. I always get requests for the recipe. Even people that don't like beans like this.

Great basic recipe. I agree with others that you only need to use half the amount of sugar.  Very easy to play around with by changing the types of beans and meat.  I used seasoned sausage, white vinegar and added in some extra baked beans and chili beans to fill a crock pot for a family reunion.  Turned out great.

My boys loved it. I followed the review's and cut down the brown sugar by 1/2.  I also added some barbecue sauce. I have kids that wont eat onions so I used onion powder. We dont like lima beans so I did 2 pork and beans. I did brown the bacon first and then the beef. It is very good. We will make it again.

For this recipe there is never a spoonful left. I have used different combinations of beans, usually what I have on hand and it always seems to come out great. This has never failed as a passing dish.

I only gave 4 stars because I made adjustments to the recipe.  I only used half the amount of brown sugar and it was still a tad sweet for my taste, but the vinegar helped to cut it.  I also used red wine vinegar because I didn't have any white wine vinegar.  I used ground turkey and let is simmer for 1 1/2 hours on the stove instead of putting it in the over.  This created more juices so I served it over brown rice and it was a hit.  Not the prettiest dish in the world, but tasty none the less.  Thanks.

I had this the first time on the 4th of July at a friends. I was immediately addicted to this dish. I used pinto, baked, black and butter beans.I noticed that some people said that could not find the lima or butter beans. In my store they are not with the kidney and baked beans but near the green beans.

Loved these beans! Didn't find lima beans at the store, so I picked up a can of pinto. Also, I used 3/4 cup brown sugar and they were plenty sweet. I omitted the hamburger, because it seemed like too much meat making these as a side dish for BBQ ribs! Our new bean recipe - the best I've tried!

I have been making this for years and it is well received everywhere..
I prefer to make it in the crockpot and let it cook for 5-6 hours without stirring but once.
I also put a touch of liquid smoke in mine to add to the "outdoor" flavor.

Don't be put off by the large amount of brown sugar - it MAKES this recipe! I've made a very close variation of this recipe for years- the only difference is that I use prepared yellow mustard (same measurement as ketsup) instead of dried. To this day, this is the ONLY bean recipe my 14 year old will eat!

I thought this was good.  My kids didn't really care for it though.  I think if I try it again I will try it with bbq sauce intead of ketchup like some other people suggested.  I also didn't put in the celery since we don't like it.   I think these would be good without hamburger meat too.  Some people said it was to too sweet with the amount of brown sugar, but I thought it tasted good like that.

This was good, but not great.  I couldn't find butter or lima beans, so I used white beans and black beans instead.  It was pretty sweet.

I loved these beans! I made them as a side dish for an Easter get together. I left out the ground beef and used bacon bits. Thay turned out great. I cooked them at 275 degrees for 2 hours.

This recipe is awesome.  My stepdaughters request it all the time.  Easy to make and clean up.  I cut back on the brown sugar to 3/4 cup and added more ketchup 3/4 to 1 cup as others have suggested.  YUM!!!

Thought I had a disaster on my hands because I drained ALL the canned beans, then was left with a dry mess in the casserole.  (And I used a 10-oz box of frozen baby limas instead of canned.)  So ... I added about half a can of beef broth.  Still was a little soupy.  I added a can of beanie weenies.  The texture was right, but even after adding another can of beans I found it a little sweet (should've read the reviews!!!).  I added another teaspoon of dry mustard and a little cayenne pepper to punch it up a bit.  It was terrific, my husband said "a keeper."  Thanks!

Served this right before Hubby went to work.  He loved them, but suggested He would prefer black beans and Navy beans rather then kidney and lima.  He liked it even better that way. i also added a very generous dash of Frank's hot sauce.

You can't go wrong!  Use whatever kind of beans that you have in the pantry.  It turns out great everytime!  Freeze the leftovers as it makes a lot!

This was great.  I would leave the bacon out though.
