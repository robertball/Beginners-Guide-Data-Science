I don’t know how to review this, I am giving 4 stars for now.  I plan to make again next week with the recommended soy milk and try again.

So I have creamy yogurt.  I used organic natures soy and yogurt. Both sweetened vanilla.  

Put in two jars and cooked in Instant-Pot with loosely applied lids for 13 hours.

Here is the fun part.  When it took out the jars there was goo floating in water.  This yogurt first timer was a bit freaked out.  I didn’t dump it I’m not a quitter....

Left in refrigerator overnight and today I strained my yogurt aka goo through some cheese cloth like ricotta.  

Well once I stirred the heck out of it I now have yogurt.  

It tastes ok....for those of you like me that like sweetened soy get the unsweetened and add something.....honey... maple....both.  The sugar becomes a little odd.  Just my recommendation 

I will make again next week and report back with a comparison
