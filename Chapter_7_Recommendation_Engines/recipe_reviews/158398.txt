I canned several pint jars of this relish.  Took some to a hot dog cookout and everyone loved it.  Two people asked for the recipe.  It was good on the hotdog as well as a dip for chips.

I needed to use up some jalapeno peppers and was glad to find this recipe that didn't require bell peppers (not a fan).  However that seems like an awful lot of black pepper.  It is canned and we'll see how it tastes in a few weeks.  I got 5 1/2 pints out of the batch.
