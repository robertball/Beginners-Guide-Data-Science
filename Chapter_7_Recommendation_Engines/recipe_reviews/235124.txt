Delicious! The lemon really brings out a really great layered flavor! Only change I made was I wrapped the prosciutto around two stalks to make it go farther. My huge family does NOT eat vegetables and everyone loved these!!!

Did not get a picture they were gone so fast.  used a whole fresh lemon of juice. served with a reverse sear ribeye and a nice glass of white wine.  10/10 will make again, might add a bit of lemon zest on them for visual pop.

I swapped the goat cheese with mozzarella because the goat cheese was too sour.
