After reading the reviews and seeing that a few people were having issues with the orange pith, I decided to leave out the orange.  Instead I increased the amount of orange juice to one and a half cups.  I added the honey but wouldn't have needed to and next time I will leave it out as well.

This smoothie has a fabulous flavor, but my only complaint was that the pith of the orange didn`t blend wery well, so I felt the small parts in the smoothie. Or  maybe I had to blend longer. But overall very good recipe with tender and fruity taste.

Very nice flavor. I have never tried a whole orange in a smoothie before. It's a perfect match with nectarine. My nectarines were very sweet, so I cut back on the banana which happened to also be very ripe/sweet, and omitted the honey. It was still quite sweet, so make adjustments according to the ripeness of your fruit. Unfortunately, my kids didn't like the 'bits' from the skin of the nectarine and the pith of the orange. Aargh! But that's kids for you. Thanks, Sarah-May, for sharing your recipe.

This was lovely. I used Stacy's organic nonfat  vanilla yogurt and Dole's strawberry/banana/orange blend juice. I didn't add the honey only because I'm out right now. We really enjoyed this. The nectarine really made this smoothie extra tasty.

This is seriously one of the best smoothies I have ever made (and I've made several).  LOVED the flavor of the nectarines!  My nectarines and orange were very ripe and sweet and I used 6 oz. of yogurt.  My daughter and I both thoroughly enjoyed this.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful smoothie recipe, Sarah-May!

Perfect sweet/tart combination.  I did not add the banana because my kids don't like the flavor, but instead added a cup of frozen strawberries.  I added 1 nectarine and some leftover peaches.  Unfortunately I didn't really measure anything, so it will be difficult to duplicate again, but it sure was good this time!

The flavour of the nectarines and orange almost become one; but it's a pleasant taste nonetheless! I like the idea of adding strawberries to this to create an orange-strawberry-banana smoothie. This would definitely make a great breakfast smoothie. Leaving on the skin from the nectarines and some of the pith from the orange lend to the smoothie being more "filling".

Really yummy.  I didn't have an orange so I just omitted that.  I didn't have vanilla yogurt so I just put plain with about 1-2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.  I also put less honey, about a teaspoon.  It was good.  My husband loved it.  I would've liked it colder.  Maybe next time I'll put it in the fridge for a bit before drinking it.

Sarah-May, this is delicious! I had seen this on the RE a while back and was grocery shopping yesterday and saw some nectarines on sale, and I thought I would try it. Unfortunately I didn't have any oranges, so I used a mango instead, which is really good! I have to admit, I didn't really think I would like this, because I thought it would be too sour for me, but it wasn't! I just slurped down my second glass in 10 minutes. Yum!

This was very tasty and refreshing!  I used plain nonfat yogurt, so I added a little vanilla, and I also had a few strawberries I needed to use up so I tossed those in, but it really wasn't enough to change the flavor all that much.  I love the orange flavor - it really wakes you up!  Nice smoothie, Sarah-May! We enjoyed it!

Sarah May, just saw this on the RE board and I had all the goodies for it so I whipped it up for my gang and they liked it a lot! I am slurping down the last of it as I type this out. Really great flavor:) Thanks for helping me create a yummy drink for the teens/hubby.

The contributor Sarah-May said it all: It's tart yet sweet and a perfect way to start the day or to have a quick on-the-go lunch.  Loved it, and I didn't even need the honey!

I used honey peach Greek yogurt since that's what I had on hand and omitted the honey.  Very tasty!

Made a half recipe.  No oranges so substituted 1/4 c. orange juice for the 1/2 orange.  Good recipe.

I use Allrecipes for inspiration and it never fails.  I searched for nectarine recipes and this came up - duh! Make a Smoothie!  Of course I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to make some changes.  I used more nectarines because the organic ones I bought were rotting fast.  I didn't have OJ or oranges so I used a couple pineapple chunks and coconut milk. I did have a frozen banana and yogurt.  I omitted the honey and added ground flax. So I'm not sure my review is actually for this smoothie recipe per se but it  gave me the inspiration I needed and was really good!

Left out the yogurt because my roommate ate it all before I got to make the recipe, hah! I swapped out the orange for a cup of fresh sliced strawberries after reading some of the reviews. I squeezed it for the fresh orange juice part instead. This was soooo good. An absolute favorite now.

Really delicious! If you don't have an orange, use frozen mango and a nonfrozen banana.

Very nice and smooth. Didn't have orange juice and only one orange but it was still good with the one.
