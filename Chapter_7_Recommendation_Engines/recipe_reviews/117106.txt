My family loves this recipe!  I've replaced the onion soup mix with taco seasoning and the peas with black beans and corn and it gives it a whole new kick.  Both ways are great!

This is a great basic recipe that's easy to make and easily adapted to personal preference.  I did want to point out that the servings per recipe is  OFF for this recipe.  Any time I see a recipe that's only 4 servings, I always double it for my family of hearty eaters.  I doubled this recipe and it FILLED an 8 quart stock pot!!  It is DEFINITELY an 8 serving recipe.  It makes PLENTY for a regular family of four to eat at one meal. Doubling it gave me enough for my family of four to eat (myself, husband, 18 year old son and 13 year old son), enough for my husband and me to take to lunch tomorrow AND I froze 4 HEARTY servings to eat at a later date so the leftovers wouldn't go bad!

This filled our empty stomachs, but it seriously needed flavor. I ended up adding quite a bit of hot pepper sauce to it to add something as it was rather bland otherwise. Sorry this one did not make our favorites but it is a good base for what could be a decent meal with some doctoring up.
UPDATE 02/15/12 I switched out the rice for elbow macaroni and added in a can of tomato soup and a can of cheddar cheese soup. This turned out 4 star and very good after a few tweaks.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe; you  must love onion soup though, because it is the dominant flavor.

I added a few elbow macaroni noodles just like the photo, for more kid appeal.  It was delightful!  I was so thankful to find a recipe that was low cost per serving (though we only had 1/2 lb. of hamburger it still was great) and very filling.  Thank you for such a flexible recipe, that was easy too.  Ohh, and next time I'll add the peas after everything is cooked, for more color.

This was easy but it was lacking flavor.  It might be a good base to spice up yourself, but I won't know because I'm not making it again.

Ok, so I made some changes, but I think the recipe is great for doing just that -- making alterations and still coming out ok.  My changes?  I used 1.25lb ground turkey instead of beef, a can of diced tomatoes instead of stewed, taco seasoning instead of onion soup mix, and fresh corn instead of peas.  :)  So yeah, I agree, almost an entirely different dish.  I wish I had gone with my instinct tho and cut the rice back to at most 1 cup.  The  meat to rice ratio was off and yes, this makes A TON!  We ate it as taco filling or scooped it up with tortilla chips.  I froze almost half of it after we finished eating (2 adults, 2 kids), I packed hubby's lunch and I had the rest for lunch.

I think when I make it again, I'll for sure cut back on the rice (water too then, of course) and maybe add a 2nd can of tomatoes.  I used a homemade taco seasoning and I  may add more of that as well.  Give it a try and make it your own!  Thanks for the jumping board recipe, Carol!

This recipe is VERY good! Not bland AT ALL!! The onion soup adds flavor. My family really enjoyed it and it will be one that I keep going back too.

Very, very bland.  Sounded great in theory, but was very disappointed.  The kids did like it quite well.

Ihave been looking for this recipe for days.  My mom use to make it when I was a kid.  I loved it.  She couldn't find it in her recipe box.  We knew all the ingredients but one.  Thank you!  It was the stewed tomatoes.  FYI-  my mom used the canned Veg All.

My whole family (including picky daughter) like this recipe.  I substitute petite diced tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes.  It is a great all-in-one-pot meal!
