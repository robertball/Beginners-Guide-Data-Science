Fun to prepare and a joy to eat. Unquestionably 5-star worthy in every respect, from the choice of ingredients to the preparation. Elegant, as the National Pork Board put it, is an apt description.  No doubt fine as is, with no changes, but as a matter of personal preference I deglazed the pan with some marsala as well as the lemon juice, then swirled in a dab of butter for a smooth, velvety sauce.  Served with "Lemon Pepper Pasta" and "Asparagus with Garlic and Onions," recipes also from this site, it was a flawless dinner.

Needed a quick meal for pork tenderloin, and this definitely fit the bill.  And, everyone absolutely loved it.  Very easy and tasty.  Definitely something we will have again.  I must say though, I don't measure stuff, and basically eyeballed the Worcestershire sauce, mustard, and lemon....

3 stars for ease of preparation which is what I am basing this review on.  My family gave a thumbs down to this dish and I have to agree. Followed the recipe exactly and found it to be somewhat sour with strong flavors that just didn't seem to marry well.  Had high hopes for this dish, but will not make again.

This recipe was excellent!!  I did triple the lemon, worcestershire and soy and added a touch of red wine.  This made the moistest pork tenderloin!  Definitely give this one a shot.

I've had Steak Diane before, but never Pork Diane.  This is certainly a guest-worthy entree with nice presentation.  I think I pounded my medallions a bit too thinly, so I'll be sure not to do that the next time. The lemon pepper is key to this, so don't eliminate that for any reason.  The only thing that I would do differently is double the  sauce.  This takes only minutes to prepare, so your side dishes can be ready to go on the table and then you can prepare your entree.   Another side benefit to this dish is how it breaks down nutritionally.  It leaves some room if you want to pair it with a more decadent side dish or you can keep the side dishes equally healthy, as well.  Either way, this is a keeper.  Thanks for the outstanding recipe.

This recipe gets five stars simply because it is so easy!  Only thing I did differently - Didn't have lemon pepper so just used plain pepper and I put the tenderloin back into the sauce and simmered for a few minutes to infuse the flavor into the meat. So easy and delicious!

A+ - everybody loved! Added chicken broth to lemon juice, worcestershire sauce and mustard to make a little more sauce and cut tanginess. Served with rice and asparagus - very pretty plate!

I also would double the sauce . I did think it was a little strong so I added a bit of heavy cream at the end . The cream gave it a real gourmet look (and taste too!)

Very good.  Tangy/tart, but it works.  Added green onion, might add a touch of garlic next time.  Used the juices that were left on the plate when pork rested and added it to the sauce to thin it out a tad.  Also tripled the "gravy" ingredients.  Good recipe, will be making again.

If you enjoy a tangy sauce then this is for you. I followed the recipe as written and  after the sauce was done i tasted it and it was a tad bit too sour for me. So I added a little chicken broth as a few others had suggested and 1 chicken boullon cube. This balenced out the tang and just a table spoon of heavy cream to thicken it up because we prefer a thicker sauce. I also used the drippings from the resting plate and let the chops sit the pan with the sauce on low while i finished up my side dishes just so they could absorb some of the sauce. This is a pretty good recipe if your in mood for something different. Will be making it again!

I just made this dish for dinner tonight and it was excellent.  I did add a few things to the sauce thought.  First, I sauted 3 minced shallots and 2 cloves of garlic in the pan after cooking the pork.  Then I de-glazed the pan with some white wine and let cook for a couple of minutes to reduce.  Then added the rest of the listed ingredients listed.  This was a very easy recipe to make and it tastes great!  It is a keeper.

My whole family loved this.  The only changes I made were to use the center of boneless pork chops and yellow mustard instead of Dijon. Another meal my whole family loved.

Decent. My entire family likes it. After browning the pork, I poured the juice, Worcestershire and mustard mixture in the pan where the pork still was. I turned off the heat and let it meet.

This recipe did no go over well with my family.  I followed the recipe exactly except for tripling the sauce because, otherwise, the meat would have been too dry.  I regret doing that, however, because the sauce was not good.  The combination of flavors was odd & my husband ended up rinsing off the sauce & just sprinkling salt & pepper on his pieces.  My son refused to eat any of it.  Also, cooking the pork for only 3-4 minutes on each side left the centers raw.  My slices were less than an inch thick & I was cooking on high.  The only reason I am giving this a generous 2 stars is because it was easy to make.  Still, I'm disapointed to have wasted an expensive pork tenderloin on this.

This was so delicious. I changed a few things around. I seasoned them with SYM (slap ya mama cajun seasoning), fresh cracked pepper, and garlic powder.  After they were cooked, I also sprinkled shredded (finely) hard Romano cheese on it. It was aged cheese..very good.  When I made the sauce, I doubled the mustard and Worcestershire sauce but NOT The lemon juice.  I also added some pepper and minced fresh garlic.  I added the parsely (dried) to the sauce too. NOT on top of the meat after it was done.  I also added some chicken broth to the sauce. IT was very yummy. I poured the sauce over the meat and again added some of the cheese I stated above. LOVE IT!

This was really amazing. I doubled the sauce and then put my cooked pork back in the pan and simmered well the rest of my dinner finished up. Made au gratin taters and garlic green beans with this and my hunny told me this was probably the best meal I have made when it came all together. Other than doubling the sauce I made exactly as stated and will plan on making this again soon.

O.M.G!!! is this good. I did deviate from the pork portion of the recipe and roasted a pork tenderloin that I rubbed lightly with Dijon mustard then sprinkled with salt, pepper and rosemary. Sliced and served drizzled with the sauce (made 3x amount). The sauce is to-die-for good! A little goes along way and the flavor is outstanding. I'll make this every time I make pork tenderloin that is how incredibly good it is!!

This is pretty good! Better than I thought it would be, just reading the ingredient list it didn't sound like it would be all that exciting. It doesn't make nearly enough sauce though. I had only 1/2 a pork tenderloin, made extra sauce and there still was hardly anything to 'pour' over the pork. It tasted good though. A touch too tangy for my liking but I think I put a little too much dijon.

This was delicious; fast and easy.  I had to substitute lime juice for lemon juice and I doubled up on all of the glaze ingredients and added 2.5 oz of beef broth and a tsp of butter.  Really, really good.  This will definately be made over and over again in my house.

This was very good.  I tripled the sauce just to make sure there was plenty.  I cooked the pork for considerably longer than the time stated in the recipe.  I did not remove the pork from the pan before adding the sauce, but rather cooked the sauce with the pork.  Very flavorful and tender!  Thanks for the recipe, National Pork Board!

Great dish! However, we like our pork more well done, so I browned it longer(on medium low)...about 6-8 minutes per side. As others have said, double the sauce; that is what "makes the dish!"

Followed the recipe exactly, but no one in the house liked this - not even a little.  The cook time was off.  I sliced the pork and flattened it, but after cooking the instructed amount of time, the centers were still raw.  We didn't care for the combination of flavors either.  There are too many other great recipes for pork tenderloin.  We won't be using this recipe again.

Really quite tasty.  The sauce is kind of a deglazer and since I don't cook with alcohol, this combination of ingrediants worked out very well.  I just followed the recipe.  The only minor variation was that I mixed the mustard, worchesterchire, and lemon juice in a small bowl before adding it to the pan.  Both my teens liked this so I will be making it again.

This adds such good flavor to pork, I just added in some minced garlic and white pepper.  Served it with mashed potatoes and garlic bread.

I thought that this was a great way to make pork tenderloin.  Usually we grill, but it was raining and so I had to rethink.  THis was simple but delicious.  My kids even liked it, and the neighbor boy called it "the best chicken ever".  I made it as is and didnt change anything.  Thanks!

My family absolutely loves this recipe (and I have a teenage son who is extremely picky).  The first time I made it, it was a hit.  I did tweak it the next time by quadrupling the sauce.  And now I add plain yogurt to it - it makes it creamier without the fat and tones down the sharpness of the dijon.  I also prick the pork and sprinkle with meat tenderizer - oh man, is it EVER tender!  After making this tonight, my son asked me to serve the sauce on the side with his hamburgers!

Excellent. I agree with previous reviewer, need more gravy but deglazing the pan with red wine is a good idea. I just put a dollop of gravy on each plate and arranged the pork around it -- very pretty! Husband and daughter both loved it. Served with french onion soup and a green salad.

Wonderful! I bought some tenderloin because it was on sale, but had no idea how to cook it. This recipe made it so easy! I used half butter, half olive oil for cooking, and substituted 1 tsp pepper with a pinch of salt as I didn't have any lemon pepper. I think it would have tasted even better with lemon pepper. The pork came out so tender and juicy. I could easily see restaurants charging $15 or $20 for this delicious entree. Thanks for the great recipe!

My family of two adults and two young teens really enjoyed this!! Used my cast iron skillet. Not sure if I did something wrong, but we all wished for way more of the “sauce.” There was barely enough for just a tiny bit on several medallions. Will definitely double it next time. Super easy, super yummy, reasonable cost!! Great weeknight meal, served with mashed potatoes, green beans, and salad. Going in the rotation for sure!! (Should also add, I made this as written. Only change was a stone ground mustard instead of Dijon because it was what I had on hand. I secretly like that better anyway ;)

I love a recipe that can be done in under 30 minutes. I followed the recipe as is, cooking my pork to just over 145 degrees and tasted the sauce before serving on the pork.  A little bit tangy for us so I toned it down by adding a teaspoon or two of honey, just enough to take the tang away. I added the juices from the resting pork to the sauce, added the pork back into the pan, turned to coat both sides, kept warm for around another two to three minutes while finishing up the side dishes. Very good quick easy recipe easily adapted to suit our taste buds. This will be added to my quick dinner list.

This came out perfectly.  I added chicken broth to the sauce to get a little more volume out of it.  Definitely a keeper!

Based on other reviews, I quadrupled the recipe for the sauce and still didn't have too much.  However, the sauce was little too tangy for us as written.  Next time I will add a little chicken broth or cream or butter as recommended in other reviews.  Very easy to make, so it worth investing some time on getting it to your liking.

Very good tasting and very easy to prepare.  I wish I would have had more sauce though.  Thankfully, the sauce is concentrated with flavor so a little goes a long way.  I will be making this again.

I only had a lemon garlic tenderloin. I used that and made sure to pour the juice from the package in the pan. Since the tenderloin was lemon garlic, I didn't use lemon pepper. I just used black pepper. I did triple the butter and sauce. I also put the pork back into the sauce and let it sit on low heat while I finished up my sides. It turned out DELICIOUS! My kids 13, 9, and 2 all ate their pork without a fuss and before anything else! A KEEPER! :)

Wonderful! Simple to prepare, 4 min each side turned out a perfect meat.  Let them sit, covered, while I prepared the sauce.  Deglazed with sherry and tripled the sauce because I knew my guys would want more of it. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and the peppered corn recipe I found on this website. We were all quite pleased with dinner.

I loved this recipe.  It was exremely easy to make and had wonderful flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly except to double the sauce.  I rarely follow recipes exactly, prefering to add my own touches to it but after reading a lot of reviews, felt that it was good as written.
I served with boiled red potatoes and peas, very simple but delicious meal!

Easy and quick, the kids said after dinner to keep this recipe in the "make again box"!! I read the reviews and made a few changes. After cooking the pork I doubled the sauce, added a can of vegetable broth to deglaze the pan, along with 1/2 lemon and 1/2 pineapple juice (we were having pinapple with dinner) used yellow mustard and Chinese spicy mustard (no dijon in the fridge) worcestershire and thickened with cornstarch and water it made plenty of sauce for the meat and the rice. We will make this again.

I made this for supper last night. Great. I did make 4 X the sauce, but it wasn't enough to put on the whipped potatoes I served with it.

My husband really enjoyed this. It has a lot of flavor. I did not have lemon pepper so I grated some lemon zest and mixed it with pepper and coated the pork with that. Easy to prepare on a weeknight. Will definitely make it again.

So easy to make and very delicious.  I actually do not eat meat, but my live-in bf does and so sometimes I make meat dishes.  Since I never know the end result, I look for easy, well-rated dishes and this tops the chart for me.  Very easy to make, low-cost, and it got rave reviews!  Love it!

This is an excellent recipe!!! Doubled the sauce and added a couple teaspoon of sugar to offset the tanginess. Was mad i didn't make more. Served with sweet potato casserole and asparagus.

This is a very easy week day meal to make. It also is a very upscale type meal with little effort. However, I would deglaze the pan with a Sauvignon Blanc, allowing for more pan juices. This wine also goes very well with the meal, complementing the sauce.

I made this last minute last night and my husband and I loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly, but would definitely at least double it the next time.  It's quick and easy but good enough to serve to company.  Will make it again soon.

This was very tasty,tender, and so fast as compared  to grilling or roasting a whole pork tenderloin. The only thing I changed was doubling the sauce and throwing the meat back in for a couple minutes. My husband went back for seconds.

My husband loved it and said it was a repeat.  I wasn't sure what to think at first, a bit too lemony for me, but the next day the left overs tasted better and the sauce thickened.  Like other reviewers, I also doubled the amount of ingredients for the sauce.  Think I'll cut down on the lemon pepper next time.  Overall was good and will repeat.

Love, love, loved it! Only thing I did was drizzled a little olive oil on the tenderloin an sprinkled with kosher salt, cracked black pepper and garlic garlic along with the lemon pepper and let it sit for about 30 minutes. I made 4 times the amount of sauce.

I have made this about 3 times in about 6 months. Each time comes out better than the last. This time I used Spicy brown mustard, and threw the sauce mix in with the medallions to cook everything together once the meat was browned instead of removing them and pouring the sauce over it. (I had some pork tenderloin from last night so I didn't have to do the first 2 steps at all)I also added mushroom in the last 3 minutes of cooking. OMG delicious. The best yet!

We love Steak Diane....so when I saw this recipe my antennae went right up! Problem was, we already had some leftover grilled pork that I was afraid would dry out. So I just made this sauce, sliced up my pork very thinly, and tossed it around for a few minutes. The result was terrific! Like some of the other reviewers, I am an "eyeball" type cook, and I think I did add a tich too much Dijon. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I didn't follow to the letter. Next time "eye'll" try to be more exact!

I love, love, love steak Diane so I've had this in my recipe box for a while just waiting to try it. I didn't like it as much as the steak and will add a dash of cream to the sauce the next time. I tripled the sauce and that wasn't even enough. I thought it was a  smidge too much lemon flavor so will knock that back a bit too next time. I deglazes the pan with Marsala wine and think that added good flavor.

I really liked this and so did my husband who hates pork! I tripled the sauce like others suggested and then sauteed the pork tenderloin for another minute in it so it could get coated. It is very tangy so if you don't like that i suggest sprinkling a bit of brown sugar on it to cut the twang. Overall, a great recipe.

I made this recipe over the weekend and everyone loved it. Including my very picky, picky son whom has to smell his food before he tastes it. The only thing I changed is increased the sauce. The meat was very tender and had a nice tangy taste. I served this with mashed potatoes that had crumbly bacon, fresh chives, sour cream, and sharp cheddar cheese, peas, and dinner rolls.

Delicious! I wanted to be sure the pork had lots of flavor so the night before I made a rub of seasoning salt, dried thyme & rosemary, garlic pepper, and garlic salt and let them sit in plastic wrap in the fridge overnight. I made 1.5 times the sauce and left out the parsley and added a tsp of minced garlic (also made the sauce the night before). When I got home from work I was able to cook the meat in a snap! I made a brown/wild rice and vegetable side dish that complemented this really well! My husband said it was the best pork I have ever made! **UPDATE**7/15/10** My husband requests this recipe frequently. He recently said he would pay $500 for a piece of this pork. That being said, TRY IT! :)

This recipe was pretty good. I think some sugar in the gravy mix would've added a better flavor to the dish overall, but without sugar is was still pretty good. I didn't have any dijon mustard so just used spicy brown mustard instead and it turned out just fine.

This was a different way to make pork tenderloin. When I mixed the lemon, Worcestershire sauce and Dijon mustard, I noticed this was way too sour. I adapted the sauce-I tripled the Worcestershire sauce, doubled the Dijon mustard and cut the lemon back to about a teaspoon or so. It really cut back on the sour taste and made this quite tasty.

I wish I could say I liked this but I just wasn't a fan. My husband enjoyed it, however, and it was easy, hence the 3 stars. I found the sauce to bitter and bland. So after tasting the sauce as written, I did season and then add some chicken broth to help dilute the strong flavour and finished it with a TBS of butter, which did help somewhat. I love pork tenderloin and make it all the time but unfortunately, I won't be making this sauce recipe again.

After reading the other reviews, I substituted chicken broth for the lemon juice. A very easy quick recipe to make.  The pork was moist, flavourful and looked great.

This was great! The only thing I did different was that I doubled the sauce. Next time I may triple it so I can pour it over mashed potatoes. Thanks!

This recipe is a keeper. I forgot I had made it a long time ago, but did not write a review for it. Now, I had to add a bit of liquid to mine as my pork loin was a bit long and game me about 12 medallions all a little bigger than 1/2 and inch thick. I added an extra tablespoon of white wine,worcetershire sauce, and lemon juice and it was just perfect. I did not have fresh parsley so I added 1/2 tsp of dried one. I would still reduce the amount of the lemon pepper as it is a bit too spicy for me and it can upset my stomach. If you like things spicy, use the amount the recipe calls for. I rectified the salt content to my taste.

Hubby loves this.  Kids and I think the sauce is a little strong. Will try to add in broth next time, as a reviewer suggested.  The pork does come out unbelievably tender!  Super fast recipe, for those times when I forget to marinade the pork!!

As I have learned the hard way, I used a meat thermometer to let me know when the meat was done. Other than that, the recipe was made as written, and was delicious for dinner and later for leftovers.

We thought this was very good. I used pork loin instead of tenderloin. I deglazed the pan with one cup of water with a chicken bouillon cube after searing off the pork.  As other suggested, I quadrupled all of the sauce ingredients except the lemon juice, which worked well. I also zested the lemon and added a pinch to the sauce at the end. We thought this was very good, but I think next time I will add a pat of butter to add a little mouthfeel to the sauce before serving.

Very good! I used a plain packaged pork tenderloin and followed all directions except as follows: I subbed chicken broth for the lemon juice and also doubled all the sauce components.

It is extremely quick to prepare.  Good for the working person who wants to eat tasty and soon.  I do agree that one must be careful with the lemon, but surely that is the same with salt, pepper etc.  I followed it exactly(being careful of lemon).  I did add salt as the recipe didn't seem to have any and ate it with small baby potatoes.  I was cooking for one, so the sauce was sufficient, but certainly not enough for more people.  I have never heard of lemon pepper and certainly cannot find it, so just used ordinary pepper.

I made this tonight and it was tender and very tasty! My husband loved it too! I wish there was more sauce so next time I might double that.  I put the meat back in with the sauce for a few minutes while I made my side dishes and I think it picked up more flavor.

Served this for dinner with company last night.  As suggested by Naples34102, my menu included Asparagus with Garlic and Onions, and Lemon Pepper Pasta.  After browning the tenderloins, I deglazed the pan with Marsala wine, but then also added chantrelle mushrooms, previously sauteed in olive oil and butter, to the sauce.  This made for an "over-the-top" addition.  Everyone raved.  Simple to prepare, but soooo elegant!

This is definitely a keeper! 

I usually laugh at people who review a recipe, then admit they changed everything. I changed VERY LITTLE and believe that this will make the recipe even easier -- and fast enough for a weeknight.

First, I cut the tenderloin in half instead of into several slices, rubbed it with lots of lemon pepper and set it aside in the refrigerator for a couple of hours (probably not totally necessary). 

I browned the halves well in an ovenproof sauté pan, then put the pan in a 375 degree oven for about 45 minutes. I learned this cooking method a while ago, and it keeps the tenderloin nice and moist no matter which rubs or flavorings you use.

It is a MUST to triple the sauce (lemon juice, Worcestershire and mustard)!!! I added 1 cup of chicken broth as others suggested, cooked it down, then swirled in 1TB of butter off heat at the end. That definitely cut the tartness and made a very complex, rich and delicious sauce - enough for the whole tenderloin! The sauce ingredients do look weird, but they work very, very well together.

Even our finicky son loved it and wants it to go in the family cookbook, which it will! I had all I could do to resist seconds!!!! 

The mustard is the wild card, and if you triple it, it will become more prominent - something you may adjust up or down according to your preferences. I used about 2-1/2 teaspoons instead of going all the way to three.

I was looking for a recipe for pan cooked pork tenderloin when I ran across this.  I used a tenderizer mallet just a bit to flatten.  I didn't have lemon pepper so I just used coarse ground pepper.  I also left the meat in the pan after browning and added the sauce, then covered and cooked on med-low until done. Very tasty and easy!

I made this last night in a smaller portion and it was very good.  I found that it didn't make much sauce but since I only had two pork tenderloin steaks (2 servings) that was OK.  I also added some red wine to the sauce.  The sauce was a bit tangy with the lemon juice and mustard but we like tangy.  Next time I might use less lemon juice and / or less lemon pepper and more red wine.

Simple and delicious.  I forgot to grab the Dijon, so just used the spicy mustard I had on hand.

This is an easy way to use pork tenderloin and it makes the pork really tender! It has become my husband's favorite way to have pork now!

Made this tonight and we enjoyed this very much! What I loved the most was how quick and easy it was to make. I'm always in search of recipes like that and this one fits the bill. You definitely should at least double the sauce.

This recipe was great! My husband usually turns up his nose at any pork but fried pork chops or country style ribs. I made this, added fresh mushrooms at the end of cooking the pork, then continued with the sauce. Next time I will double the sauce as it really made the dish!

I made this with chicken breast instead of pork and I followed the recipe exactly.  I loved it and will definetely make again.  Do not use cheap balsamic and make sure you taste as you go, especially when adding the lemon.

This was really good. I tripled the sauce (except for the lemon) and I still had barely enough to cover the pork. The sauce was very good though, no real complaints about that.

One of our favourite meals ever.  So quick and flavourful - it's like having a "Sunday night meal" any night of the week!  We follow this recipe to the "T" and have always had it turn out perfectly.

This is good.  I should have tripled the sauce.  My kids loved it and it was incredibly simple.  I made all my sides before hand and this made everything even simpler.  It's a definite keeper.

Loved them!  My kids (10, 7, & 4) ate these like they were candy!  I used thicker cut of pork & needed to cook 4-5 minutes on each side.  Used a bit more lemon pepper & a whole tbsp on dijon as well.  Turned out amazing.  Highly recommended

You might want to use more butter because 1 tablespoon cooked almost all the way off for me, but maybe because I cooked the tenderloin in two batches. Great flavor!

I made this recipe as written, but I tripled the sauce as suggested by others because my boyfriend enjoys worcestershire and dijon.  The sauce is quite tangy and has a lot of flavor, so if you don't love the tastes of worcestershire and dijon I wouldn't make more. A little goes a long way. Next time I'll probably just buy thin sliced pork cutlets instead of a tenderloin. It saves some time and it won't affect the taste.

Very good.  I didn't have any lemon pepper, so I just used a mixed seasoning rub I had.  It was still really good.  My kids really liked this "chicken" and even had seconds!

Way too salty and tart for my liking! I had to add some brown sugar to tone it down a little and that made it quite yummy. And for the record, I followed the recipe exactly, except I used garlic pepper instead of lemon pepper. Kinda glad I didn't add more lemon to the mix though. I can't even imagine how much more tart that would've made it. This recipe has potential, it's just not great as is!

Yum!  I am no fabulous chef, and I have a hard-to-please family.  They loved this, which means it was a winner.  So simple, even I didn't mess it up!  I did triple the sauce recipe, as recommended by several reviewers, as well as use a little red wine in the sauce.  My family wanted to know who I sneaked into the kitchen to cook this:)

Very fast and easy!  I increased the sauce ingredients as well, but be careful with the worcestershire as it can really make the dish salty.  Awesome recipe!!

This was great! I'm normally not a huge pork fan, but this had such good flavor. I will definitely make again soon!

I found this to be kind of "eh".  I made it for a few friends, and while none of us disliked it, only one person really liked it.  I also found that it didn't make enough sauce.  Not a bad recipe, but more trouble than it was worth.

Very good...and very easy to make.  I think next time I will make a little bit more sauce because that was the best part.
