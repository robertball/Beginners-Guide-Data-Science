This recipe looked good but i didn't have all the ingredients so i improvised. I cut the sugar in half, used 1-1/3 cups white vinegar and 3/4 cup apple juice for the apple cider vinegar, and also used 2 tsp cinnamon, 2 tsp allspice and 1 tsp dried ginger for the apple pie spice, and used fresh golden beets( about 4 medium sized). To this I also  added 1/3 cup dried gogi berries. i then proceeded to braise the whole mixture on the stove in a frying pan on medium heat. when the beets were "al dente" i stirred together 1 tsp cornstarch with 1 cup cold water then added it to the beets. when the sauce thickened i removed from stove and served.

I was looking for something to do with my canned beets and found this recipe.  Very good intenons- I would just suggest cutting the sugar, it was a bit too sweet for me.  I also cut the seasoning just a bit and added some freshly grated ginger and broken pieces of ramen noodle uncooked.  Definitly good, we ate it all!

Fixed it last night and followed it exactly.  Easy and excellent.  We love harvard beets but this is even better.

Just made this recipe.  It hasn't chilled yet and I wanted to try it chilled, but smells great.  Warm was o.k. but not special to me.  I love spiced, chilled foods.  I just wanted to give a hint to new cooks, after you microwave the cider and spices, stand back when you open the microwave!  It will open your sinuses .
 I'm giving 5 star for ease and cost.

I used fresh, just steamed beets, and a chopped up orange, so didn't make exactly the same recipe. Oh, and 45 seconds in my microwave was very sufficient; if I'd done 2 minutes, I'm certain I would have had a rock crystal... In any case, I had doubts, especially right after microwaving the mix. I thought "oh, this is going to be horrible..."  but I was WRONG!  It turned out really, really good.  It will definitely become a regular during the growing season.

Can't say that I cared for the addition of the oranges in this.  I used a saucepan on the stove top, not microwave. I reserved about a half cup or more of  the beet juice to stir into the cornstarch.  1/4 cup vinegar didn't seem like enough liquid.  Husband liked it.

This was a really tasty surprise. Looking at all of the ingredients it is kind of hard to imagine how they could go together. It was almost like pickled beets with a citrus twist. I chilled this and we ate it as a cold salad. I would definitely make again.
