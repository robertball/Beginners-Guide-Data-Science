For a faster prep you can substitute 4 cups of cooked instant mashed potatoes (1 pound of potatoes equals 2 cups cooked mashed potatoes). This will cut your prep from 20 minutes to about 5 minutes. Other than that I find these to be very good and tasty and they don't really require any sauce though my household seems to prefer ranch dressing for dipping these in.

I made exactly as written. After tasting them I tried many things to Doctor them up - adding bacon frying them etc. still horrible. I'd give 0 stars if I could
