Everyone loved these. The second baking took a 
little longer than the recipe indicates.
I've also tried this using raspberry preserves.
Great easy recipe.

These are great!!!  I did change the recipe a bit though.  I did half with the apricot preserves and half with strwberry preserves, Iwas curious to see how it came out with something other then apricot preserves.  Well both rocked, I liked the strawberry better and hubby preferred the apricot. Win, win!  Can't wait to try with cherry or raspberry preserves!  I also put an oatmeal, brown sugar crumb topping instead of the nuts on top.  I will cook the crust longer next time.  WARNING!!!!  If you arn't a fan of very sweet foods than this is not the recipe for you.

EXCELLENT!! These are so incredible - people just rave over these when I make them. Thank you Marian for this delicious cookie bar!!
P.S. Not sure what the last lady did...but I bet money is was the turkey NOT the cookies.

This is a keeper.  I, too, had to bake the 2nd go-around much longer, as the crust was too soft.  But the end result was worth the extra time.  I used toasted almonds in place of walnuts, as hubby is allergic to walnuts.  And, I used fresh apricots mixed w/sugar blended in a food processor and cooked for 5 minutes in lieu of preserves.

These were really really good. Made my own quick preserves to put on top...didn't have any nus so I put coconut on top...really yummy...like shortbread with an apricot/coconut topping...will do again with other toppings

Have tried with lingonberry preserves with a oatmeal/brown sugar toppng...these came out wonderful...tart yet sweet...perfect for a Norwegian potluck!

These were very good.  I did add a pinch of salt to the flour mixture and I used non-stick spray to prepare the baking pan.  Think I'd prefer to toast the nuts and just put them on the cut bars instead of sprinkling them on the top and THEN cutting.

These were delicious, but like other reviewers noted the crust needs extra bake time.  I used homemade strawberry preserves topped with toasted sliced almonds.

It is hard to stop at just one! I used almonds rather than walnuts, and baked it longer the first time (it just looked un-done). Next time I make these, I probably will grease the pan too, because they are hard to get out once they've cooled! I can't wait to share these little gems!

YUM!  These were terrific. I made them as the recipe directed, but I did add extra pecans (not walnuts) on top.

Awesomely delicious!  I put 1/4 t. almond extract in the base and almonds on top, made half w/raspberry and 1/2 w/apricot.  Quick & easy!

I really did not care for these.  I halved the recipe and cooked in an 8 in sq. pan.  I did not deviate from the crust recipe at all and thought it was bland and flavorless.  I was surprised by the omission of salt -- that would have helped.  And perhaps adding additional extract, maybe almond, would be an improvement.  I thought the texture was fine.  I also increased cooking time by about 5 minutes on each portion per previous reviews.  I used half apricot low sugar preserves and 1/2 preserves that were sweetened with splenda.  The apricot was the only tasty part of the bar!

I found these very dry and almost impossible to get out of the pan without digging them out. Directions to return to the oven for "Up to 15 minutes" was very vague....

These taste OK but the crust doesn't seem done enough even though after turning oven down to 250 degrees, I left it in 23 min. rather than 15 and it still doesn't seem done. If I make again, I will bake for 30 min. on 350 before turning down.

YUM! The crust is absolutely fabulous! I may try it without the walnuts next time though. Or maybe with almonds instead.

I tried these to use up a huge jar of apricot preserves and some pine nuts that needed to go.  I toasted the pine nuts during the first bake (dry skillet on medium for a few minutes, shaking & flipping about every 30 seconds). I thought the bars were pretty good.  Two flaws for me: 1, they're a little too sweet for my taste and 2, the baking times didn't work for me - the bars *looked* nicely done with the instructed times, but the middle was still really soft and gooey when I cut into them. I did forget to score the bars before the second bake, so maybe that's my issue. They're back in the oven again (missing one piece!) and I'm afraid to burn the edges while trying to get the middle cooked.

I made this for my sister (she is on a liver transplant list) because it is so VERY VERY low sodium -- only sodium is from the egg. I used one whole egg instead of the 2 yolks and 1/2 graham flour and 1/2 white. Used 1/2 jar of apricot preserves and sliced almonds.  It was great!  Next batch will be with seedless blackberry preserves and chopped walnuts that I have on hand, but I'm afraid the sliced almonds (and maybe the part hertier flour) really made this. I made 5 batches of low/no sodium cookies and this was the best to me.

Very good even though I used non dairy marg. (I'm sure they'd be much better with butter but I'm allergic to dairy) and a can of solo brand apricot filling. Baking times didn't work for me though, baked 2nd time for > 30 min. and crust was still moist and too soft in middle although the bottom was golden brown. Could be that I had it out of oven too long between 1st & 2nd baking. Well worth another try, think next time I'll increase 1st baking time to 25 min. or until the crust appears to be almost done. Thanks Marian.

These are very addicting for me!  My family members didn't love them as much, but I have to be careful in having them around!  I have tried them with pecans also, but really like English walnuts better on these.  Thanks Marian!

I added a little salt and used apricot syrup the neighbor made and canned. They were very good, but not something I'll probably crave or make again soon (I will probably try with raspberry). Anyway, the dough (before adding egg and we did add vanilla) was quite awesome, and I made a second batch up until that point and made them into cookies (baked 15 minutes @350), and my kids and husband went nuts over them!

I made these and they were exactly what I was looking for.  They turned out delicious!  I made a second batch using Raspberry Preserves in place of the Apricot, just because not everyone likes apricots.  They were both a huge hit!
