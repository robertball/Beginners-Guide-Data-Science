Really really tasty soup. Hearty and filling. My 2 bunches of leeks totaled 5 leeks. I added salt and pepper (definitely needed S&P ). At the end I used my immersion blender to thicken up a bit.  The kids were drooling over the pot with bowls in hand. This recipe makes a gracious plenty.  We also topped it off with a little shredded cheddar and bacon bits:)

Unfortunately, the onion soup mix overpowered the lovely delicate flavour of the leeks.  Next time, I'll omit and use fresh chopped onion instead of the onion flakes.

Big hit with the family. My husband said it reminded him of his mom's potato soup.  I didnt like the onion soup mix in it (used 1/2 package), next time I will leave it out, and up the quantity of leeks.

This is phenomenal.  Only change I made was half & half instead of heavy cream.  I'm a rookie but this turned out awesome.
