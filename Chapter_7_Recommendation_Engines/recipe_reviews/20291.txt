I enjoyed this recipe.  I didn't love it, but that is just my taste.  I still gave it 5 stars because those at the picnic who like a cool citrus dessert enjoyed it a lot.  I baked my angel food from a Betty Crocker angel food cake mix because I think it is so much better than store-bought.  I used orange juice concentrate (straight from the can, thawed & undiluted; I do this whenever a recipe calls for orange juice if I don't have fresh because I think this gives a great clean orange flavor).  I would have enjoyed more pineapple the next time I make it--perhaps tidbits or even crushed.  I was leary about folding in the hot custard to the whipped whites, but it worked nicely without any hiccups.  The recipe worked beautifully, and it practically dropped out of the pan when unmolding which was a welcome surprise.  The cook time on the custard took me about 10 minutes.  Thanks for sharing.
