Yummy. However, one ground-up stick of cinnamon in that water-brown-sugar-lemon mix makes it even more unholy. I also served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and ignored the whipped cream concept. I love desserts with both hot and cold textures.

Wow.  Really nice!  I tried both green and red pears (don't know their proper names).  The green were a bit better---softer skin, I think. My teenaged boys gobbled them right up!

I made this pretty much as written except for using vanilla yogurt.   Also after baking for 25 min. I turned the pears and filled the core with the nut stuffing and baked for additional 5 minutes or so.  The next time I am going to cut down on the sugar to 1 T. in the topping as it was a little too sweet for our taste.  But, otherwise it was a good recipe and so easy to prepare.  Has a nice presentation topped with the whipped cream and a sprinkling of cinnamon.  Thanks Dakota!

Excellent!  I did add a pinch of cinnamon to the sauce and bake them for 20 minutes then turn over and put the filling in and bake another 5 minutes per others suggestion. Served with plain whipped cream.  Delicious!  Will make again.

This was a hit! Very tasty, light dessert. I added a splash of brandy and a few dots of butter to the baking liquid and basted it a couple of times throughout the baking process to get more of the flavorings into the pears. I think next time I would do what some others did and turn the pears right side up in the baking dish, add the nut mixture and bake again for five minutes. I also sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on top of the whipped cream before serving. But all in all a great dessert!

I baked for the recommended time, and thought it needed at least five more minutes. I added cinnamon to both sauces, but overall the taste was wonderful. Vanilla ice cream works just fine. Would make again.

This was easy and good, not too heavy after a big dinner.  We loved it.  I tried to follow the recipe exactly, but turns out we didn't have the yogurt and I substituted sour cream, which was fine.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts because I had them already.  I did not add anything extra to the whipped cream.  Really nice dessert!

Sooo delicious and light!! I followed the recipe as stated, except I followed GotRecipe?'s suggestion of baking 25 mins, then adding walnut mixture and baking another 5... I also didn't make the whipped cream but substituted in vanilla ice cream instead... YUM! Next time I will try the whipped cream just to see what it tastes like... great recipe though! I polished off 2 in one setting and my roommate had one and she really liked it! :)

I served this as an alternative dessert for some vegetarian guests, and it was so good, I will absolutely use it again.  Very easy to prepare, and very attractive!  The only thing I would change to not to put the brandy in the whipped cream, to me it's a little too much.  I will use a dash of vanilla in the cream next time.  The pears are delicately flavored, and the brandy sauce is enough to compliment them without overpowering them.
