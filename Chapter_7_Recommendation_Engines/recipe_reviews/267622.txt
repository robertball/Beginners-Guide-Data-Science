So good! Followed the recipe pretty closely except used 2 fresh jalapeno peppers seeded and diced and sauteed with the onions. Came out amazing! Definitely will make this again!

This was really good.  I put some tortilla chips on the side of the bowl to scoop a little as well.  High recommend.  No changes made.

Delicious!  Served over rice with sour cream and avocado on the side.  I used regular (not Hatch) canned green chilies and substituted paprika for the chipotle pepper powder.

I scaled this back, using 6 oz. of dried black beans (as this was just for my husband and me). We also did not eat this as a soup, but instead served this over cilantro lime rice as a side dish to a cuban pork roast that I had made. My beans might have been old, as it took another 20 minutes under pressure to get them to soften (my bad). These were so flavorful, and exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was fantastic! We didn't have Hatch chilis available at our supermarket, so we just used a regular can of diced green chilis. We served it with a squeeze of lime juice and, as suggested by another reviewer, a dollop of sour cream mixed with a little chipotle powder. The combination of flavors - the creaminess of the beans and sour cream, the smokiness and bite of the chipotle pepper seasoning and the brightness of the lime juice was delicous!

45 minutes was not enough.  Some of the beans were still hard.   I had to cook it longer.   I will cook it for an hour next time.

This was an inexpensive and easy to make dish/soup that was healthy and tasty. It goes on our 'cook it again' list. The spices gave it that extra something (for those who like a bit more pizazz). I did not give this 5 stars only because my taste standards are high. This is well worth cooking, but perhaps not as a main dish unless you have a smaller appetite.

This recipe works perfectly. It’s chock full of flavor. You really could just serve the beans as a side dish without puréeing if you wanted. As a soup it was perfect with quesadillas for lunch on a cold afternoon. Thank you for the recipe.

Will certainly make this again.  I did not use any garnish.  Kept the spices as written in the recipe and might have been a little more generous with them.

I would make it again. I used a poblano pepper I had in the fridge already along with the yellow pepper, and I added some sour cream mixed with a bit of chipotle powder as a garnish.
