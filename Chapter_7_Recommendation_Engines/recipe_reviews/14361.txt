Would have given this 5 stars except that "Marilyn" got it wrong. This is an old French recipe that should have 3/4 c oil + 1/4 c lemon juice with only 2 garlic cloves and salt & pepper for the dressing. Prepared the tradtional way, it's definitely worth all 5 stars.

When made correctly this recipe is heavenly. To make the dressing...mince the garlic cloves, then put them in the blender with lemon juice, 3/4 C oil, and salt & pepper. Blending it makes it kind of frothy and  mixes it well. Everything else I do the same, except I put more bacon and I have never tried croutons in it. We call this salad Dragon Breath, and it is a hit at parties.  My friend gave me this recipe and she masters it every time. Enjoy

The oil is missing in this recipe.  It is too bland without oil.  I have made this before as it is a french salad but I can't remember the french name.  The dressing should have 3/4 cup of oil with 1/4 cup lemon juice and 2 cloves of garlic as 1southerngirl also mentions in her reveiw.  This made more than 4 servings.

I reduced the recipe to two servings so maybe something got lost in the translation. It was way too dry and too salty (I think this was due to the type of Parmesan cheese that was used). Anyway, we had to pull out the ranch dressing to eat this. I did think the lemon/garlic dressing gave it a refreshing taste BUT it needs oil.

Not bad for a last-minute salad.  The bacon was the best part.  Will use a lot more salt and pepper next time.

This salad has been sitting since 2006 since its last review.  I made the salad portion as written, but had to change the dressing.  I do believe 1SOUTHERNGIRL posted the correct version of this dressing, as it does need some oil and LESS garlic.  I used ¾ c. oil; ¼ c. fresh lemon juice; 2 garlic cloves; and s/p to taste.  I mixed it in the small blender to make it frothy.  The heads of romaine I used were not overly large and this salad made 6 hearty servings.  I served this with 'Broccoli Pizza Pie' from AR.  My family very much enjoyed this salad and I won’t hesitate to make it again, with the dressing I used.
