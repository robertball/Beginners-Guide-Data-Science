The flavor of this recipe is perfect.  This is what pumpkin pie is supposed to taste like!  I tried this once with canned pumpkin and again another time with fresh pumpkin, and it turned out terrific both ways!

I couldn't wait until Thanksgiving to try this.  It lives up to it's name and the smell while its baking is wonderful.  This will be my Pumpkin pie recipe.  Terrific!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year. I doubled the recipe, and made 4 pies (I didn't use deep-dish shells). Two are currently in the freezer to save. The flavor of this was great. This may just be my pumpkin pie recipe from now on.

The taste was okay, but it was still runny, almost raw in the middle after baking time + 10 minutes. I will try again, perhaps cut down on the milk some and bake a bit longer. I like spicy and dense pie. This has potential, it's not "fluffy," but as written it's not quite cooked at the end of the baking time.

I made this recipe for my pregnant wife and she absolutely loved it. I added a little extra puree and cinnamon and made two pies.

I think with the cream and milk it was lighter than the normal condensed milk version and it was much superior to the evaporated milk versions I have tried, where the evaporated milk is easily identified with the pumpkin and spices. My pie was very bland but I am certain this had something to do with the lacklustre canned pumpkin I used. I will try it again and use fresh pumpkin next time. I will also use all brown sugar to bring out the spices. I found it was (too?) sweet, but needed more spice to give it that pumpkin pie warmth we expect from a pie.

Delicious and perfectly spiced. I used 2c of evaperated milk instead of the milk and cream, which was slightly more than 1 can. Worked out fine but was a bit creamy for me. Next time I will use 1 can. Taste was perfect!

I make this pie every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas and I love it. I get two pies out of it with 9" deep-dish pie crusts. I definitely up the spice quantities too. I eyeball it, so it's different every time, but I go anywhere from doubling to tripling the quantities. I also melt some butter with some of the spices and brush the pie crust with the spiced butter before pouring the pie filling in.

I think regular pumpkin pie can be very dull, so this lively version was definitely tasty!

This is THE pie recipe you want: fully flavored, smooth and delicious. The generous spices do the trick! I won't go back to the other recipes I've used, my husband said this was the best pumpkin pie ever.

I made no changes and would make it again! It took more like 1 hour, 30-40 minutes to really finish. Delicious!!

Just like the description says - this is for all people who don't like Pumpkin Pie. This is a really yummy recipe, and I've made it 6+ times as written. It makes a large amount, so you can make either 2 fairly shallow pies, or one large pie with a little left over for a mini pie. This year, I'm going to 1.5 x the recipe to make 2 hopefully just right size pies.

This seems very similar to one of the Pumpkin pie recipes in the 1950's Betty Crocker Picture Book.  Good dark and spicy pumpkin pie.
