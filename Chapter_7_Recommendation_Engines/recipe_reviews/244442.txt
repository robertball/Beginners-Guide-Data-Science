Quick, easy, family favourite treat for any occasion. I have substituted milk chocolate for the white chocolate and it is also quite good.

Grab the kids and get them to help with this easy to make recipe, no doubt you'll be a hero and they will love the flavor. This is a perfect balance of white chocolate and cookies. The entire recipe is spreadable in a 1/4 sheet pan.

What's not to love here?? This works perfectly with gluten free ingredients. Thank you for the recipe.
