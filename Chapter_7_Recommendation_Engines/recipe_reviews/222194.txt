I LOVED this. I used Callebaut 70% and a super-fruity olive oil. I think using a very flavorful, fruity olive oil is key to making this work, along with using a very dark chocolate, as the submitter specifies. The only thing I did differently was to only toast each side of the bread for about 1 minute, until barely golden; I wanted more of a chew than a crisp crunch.

Amazing...I absolutely loved this!!  You do have to use high quality products...olive oil and dark chocolate from Whole Foods worked well.  It definitely is unique and will have everyone talking about it.  And the simplicity of this recipe makes it even better.

Weird concept. Embarrassed to serve as an app. They were hardly touched.
