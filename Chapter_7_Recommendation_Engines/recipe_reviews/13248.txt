I've made this soup following the recipe, and also with my own changes.  Both were delicious.  To change, I used cooked orzo pasta instead of rice and replaced the seafood with chicken.  Note though, the orzo soaked up a LOT of the liquid and got so big and fat that the soup turned into a stew.  Still very yummy though!  Oh, and I also added a splash of white wine to the veggies when sauteing them, as I always seem to have some leftover wine in the fridge.  It gives the finished product a nice depth.

One of the best tasting soups ever! For a vegetarian meal I left out the scallops and used a homemade veggie broth.  I also changed to brown rice (because that's what I had).  I had to add 1 more cup of broth and it still turns out very thick but my hubby and I prefer it that way.  For a bit more flavour I doubled the basil, so tasty!!!

This was really good. I added some garlic to the vegs. Instead of 2 cups chicken broth I used 3/4 white wine and the rest chicken broth. I added about a Tbsp of lemon juice before adding the scallops. I didn't find this thick at all.

My wife insists on 5 stars but she is not yet ready for the scallops!  I added a bay leaf, two strips of finely chopped green pepper.  I used a 10 ounce can of condensed fat-free chicken consomme (don't forget to add one can of water) plus one more can of hot water with one heaping teaspoon of chicken broth powder (don't add any more salt).  It made the soup more liquid and less stew-like.  This is now my wife's favorite Tomato Rice soup (after her mother's of course!!!).  It tastes even better the next day after being refrigerated.

I made this into a creamy soup.  I blended the tomatoes, used 1 can of chicken broth, and 2 c skim milk. I also cooked the veggies longer until they got soft tender. I omitted the scallops and the soup is delicious.

This was SOOOO good and really healthy. I by used quinoa instead of rice and added some garlic with the veggies in the beginning. I also threw in some spinach and lemon juice at the end. I used frozen scallops because that is all I had and it turned out great. Really solid lunch recipe!!

I thought this soup was really great.  Honestly, I think you could omit the scallops.  The scallops were nice, but they didn't really add much flavor or depth.  I will definitely make this soup again!

I made a number of alterations, as I used this recipe last minute on a snow day, my husband said it was one of the best soups he'd ever had.  I used shrimp instead of scallops, had no celery, added one clove of garlic and some white wine, orzo instead of rice and last but not least dried basil instead of fresh - very yummy!!

I'm not a fan of this recipe.  I didn't care for the taste.  The soup was more like a stew.  It was not what I expected.

My family loved this recipe.  Even my 3 year old twins.  The only change I made was I added a can of corn with the juice to it.  The sweetness of the corn balanced out the acidity of the tomatoes.

Excellent!!!  Needed a meat-free dish quickly for the first Friday in Lent, and by doing an ingredient search on this site for what I had on hand - scallops and basil - came up with this.  I was a little nervous, but it is outstanding!  Hubby raved; I already can't wait for lunch tomorrow so i can have leftovers.  Filling, delicious, and the scallops add such an elegant touch.  You could serve to company.

Great recipe! Quick, tasty and healthy. I made some modifications - I added a few minced garlic cloves to the olive oil and I pureed the tomatoes in a blender before adding to the veggies/stock mixture - it gives the soup a nice texture. I used peeled shrimp instead of scallops. (Next time I think I'll try spooning on some lump crabmeat before serving!)   Thanks!

This was delicious soup and easy and quick to make.  The scallops were a great addition.  I added 3 cans of water because we like our soup less thick.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed the recipe with fresh tomatoes from the garden. It was very good and will probably freeze well for fast lunches in the winter. Picked 44 tomatoes today so I will make it again.

Easy recipe, tasty soup.  I used vegetable stock and omitted the scallops to keep it vegetarian. Also added a bay leaf and used basmati rice. It all turned out well.

This recipe has become a family favorite.  Sometimes I substitute a big bag of mixed seafood (calamari, shrimp, cod, etc.) for the scallops.

This is one of the best soup recipes I have ever eaten.  I don't care much for basil, so I didn't put much in.  I can't wait to share this recipe with others.

Overall pretty good, nothing super fancy but it's tasteful and filling- can be used as an apetizer or a meal.

I found this recipe easy to make and delicious.  The fresh basil at the end is the best touch.
