This is the most awesome bread you could use to make cinnamon sticks!  Just slice it & butter it & put cinnamon sugar on it.  I didn't add the chocolate chips & I doubled the brown sugar because you use 1/2 as much Splenda as sugar & changed it to a tablespoon of cinnamon.

This bread was fantastic. I ate it with Nutella smeared on it and it was divine. Thank you for submitting this one.

Thia bread was pretty tasty.  Very moist and mushy in the middle.  Not dry or crumbly.  I even added some whole wheat flour by accident and it still tasted good.  My only other change was to replace pb chips with butterscotch chip.  It was tasty but I think next time I want to try all just choc chips and see how that comes out.  Definitely a keeper.

Delicious!  Makes a beautiful bread. We made 1/2 recipe for our 1 lb Welbilt bread machine. Not too sweet, great for kids.
