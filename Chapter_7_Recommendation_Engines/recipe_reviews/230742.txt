Delicious! I used more heavy cream and parmesan than called for b/c I wanted more sauce to serve over pasta. Also I used an 8oz. pkg. of sliced mushrooms instead of a can and reduced the oregano per personal preference. This came together in no time and was enjoyed by the whole family. I will def be making this again YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)

Great recipe at its base. Double the sauce and simmer in the pasta = perfect!

I served this over spaghetti squash...HUGE HIT! I used more wine cream and Parmesan because we like saucy dishes. No leftovers!

I made it with the suggested changes such as double the cream and Parmesan and I never use canned mushrooms so 10 oz of fresh. The only suggestion I can make is drain a bit of the oil from the sausage. It seemed a little too greasy. I had mild sausage so I added a bit of red pepper for a kick.

Big Hot with the family. made this as the first meal in our house and invited my in-laws to join us. I doubled the recipe but also didn't have any measuring utensils since those were not unpacked yet but it still came out fabulous. Definitely on my girls make again list!

Like many others I doubled the sauce ingredients which actually made what is the perfect amount of sauce for the extra noodles and sausage I had. I doubled the mushrooms and used greasy as personal preference. I also removed the casings from the sausage before cooking so it was ground for the sauce instead of bite sized pieces. This was a good meal with lots of leftovers for the two of us. My husband certainly liked it a lot as the leftovers are almost gone in under a week!

We all liked it. Much lighter than we expected. I like my pasta a lot saucier so next time may double sauce ingredients. Couldn't taste the wine at all in fact my husband was shocked when I told him there was wine in it. I also used fresh mushrooms as I do not like canned. I also used 1 T Oregano and 1 T dried basil. (instead of 2T Oregano) Nice way to use sausage. I think I would definitely love it with more sauce.

The first time I made this with fresh mushrooms and bottled sauce and extra wine. Very good. Second try was out of sausages so used frozen meatballs and threw in swiss chard to up the veggies. some oregano and some basil. This recipe is great and is flexible enough to tweek for what you have.

I love the hidden kick of heat from the sausage. I did double the garlic cream wine and parm. Next time I will hold off on adding the parm till I'm ready to serve it gooped up on me while the cream was heating up. I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. The reason for the 4 was that even though the sauce had flavor and yes I did taste the wine (yum) the pasta seemed bland even though I mixed it all together at the end. I added some onion powder and garlic salt and it was perfect!

My favorite dish these days; I make it for my wife when she comes home from overnight duty at the hospital. I pretty much follow the recipe. Sometimes I use red wine if I don't have white still tastes good. I use a little less cheese and butter for health sake. Great recipe. Love it.

Too much oregano for my taste. I think it should be 2 teaspoons.

SO DELICIOUS! Everyone loved this so much. We will definitely be making this again! The next day I added fresh diced tomatoes to the leftovers - yummy! Will probably add more mushrooms next time too. Per other reviewers we doubled the sauce.

This is a new go to recipe! I did double the sauce knowing my family would want it saucier. Otherwise no changes. It was amazing. Great flavor and super quick to make.

I think this fell pretty flat. And probably too much oregano. Not bad not great.

Yummm. I tripled the sauce since I used about 10 ounces of fresh mushrooms (a mix of button and baby portabellas). I also added a small amount of zucchini and diced green pepper. I winged it with the oregano since people said it was overpowering -- I just did what I thought would taste good to me. Served over pasta.

We added a little more wine and a little more cream. We also decased the sausage and added shrimp too! I was worried it wouldn't be enough sauce but this was more than adequate for one whole box of pasta. This was so delicious!

I chose to double up on the wine and cream. I also used light cream as a personal preference. Came out great. Sub the hot sausage for polska kielbasa too (personal pref). Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.
