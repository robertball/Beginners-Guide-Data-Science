I love this recipe.  I  have an October birthday and my mom always used to make this as my cake for me when I was growing up.  My only suggestion is to use Milano cookies as the gravestones, but that is just a personal preference (they are the best!).

It was pretty tasty.  However the consistency was more like pudding than cake or pie.  Next time, I plan to put a grahm cracker or oreo cookie crust on the bottom of the pan.

This recipe is a Halloween favorite.  I use Pepperidge Farms Milano cookies instead.  You could also add gummy worms for additional effect.  Very good!

This was so easy and VERY tasty! I will make it again for sure. I found that using a piping bag for the cool whip ghosts worked best & I used vanilla waffers for gravestones. Thanks.

This was so easy, cute and delicious.  I made 2 this year for 2 different parties.  For the 1st one I followed the recipes, but for the 2nd one I changed it up a little bit and used Oreo Pudding/Pie Filling.  It was delicious and everyone kept saying it tasted like dirt cake. I used the Milano cookies for tombstones.  Instead of the cool whip for ghosts, I made ghosts out of meringue.  I also used the little candy corn pumpkins to decorate and cut little slivers of green fruit rollup to have little sprigs of grass around the tombstones.  Will be posting my pics soon.

My husband makes this every year for our kids.  Everyone loves it, even us!  We use Milanos for tombstones and they look just as good!  Delicious and fun!

My family loves this--it has become a Halloween tradition.  My daughter calls it "dirt dessert."  This can also be fun served in individual serving cups with a ghost or tombstone on top with a pumpkin.

This was fun.  My 9 years old daughter was able to make it pretty much on her own. The result was great to look at and just as great to eat! She wants to make it again next year :). We used ghost peeps to make it a bit easier.

This is a fun cake to bring to a party and the kids love it. I buy different kinds of cookies and things to make the headstones. I also found the gel food coloring that lets you draw right on the cookie. *I just discovered that Pepperidge Farms makes mini Chessmen cookies in 100 calorie packs. A couple of the cookies actually have crosses on them...plus crowns and other shapes. Pretty cool.
