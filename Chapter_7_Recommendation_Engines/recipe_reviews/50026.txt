I just cooked this dish, and this was quite possibly the best meal I have ever eaten.  I love the richness, I love it.  I love anything with andouille, chicken, and cream.  The only thing I did different was make homemade alfredo sauce instead of canned/jarred, which only took a minute (2c half and half, 1 stick butter, 3c parmesan, and 2 tbl minced garlic).  I love the cheesiness, and it is not watery like some lasagna.  You can actually get the first piece of this out without it being destroyed!  I found it to have the perfect amount of saltiness and spice.  I LOVED this recipe.  In fact I am going to get some more now!

After reading the helpful review given by Louisianagirl I tired this recipe again using homeade alfredo (2c half and half, 1 stick butter, 3c parmesan and 2 tbsp minced garlic). What a difference!! Turns out the first time I reviewed this recipe what I did not like was the flavor of the store bought alfredo sauce, not the richness. Thank you for your review Louisianagirl - you turned what I originally rated a five star recipe into a ten star recipe!

This was an easy and very tasty twist on the same old lasagna! I prepared it as followed and it came out perfect! If your picky about your alfredo sauce than go the extra step and make your own, however even with the jared "stuff", this was one of the best dishes I've made on this site! Thanks again!

I have prepared this reciped twice.  It is great. The only thing I changed was to use no cook pasta. I just put a little of the plain sauce on the bottom of the dish before the first layer of noodles.

This was delicious and simple to put together! I actually scaled down the amounts to fit a 8x8 pan and still used 2 cartons of sauce.  I just let the lasagna sit for about 15 minutes before cutting into it and it served up beautifully. This is rich I admit, but looking at the ingredients I knew I couldn't go wrong!  I also added some sweet corn to the meat mixture and it gave a hint of sweetness to compliment the spiceness of the andouille.  My husband licked his plate clean.....literally! Don't forget to scrap up all the bits left behind from browning the meat when sauteeing the vegetables since it will add to the flavor. Thanks for this recipe, its a keeper.

Mmmmmmm...... This was good.  Like others have said you only need half the box of noodles and I used hot italian sausage and it turned out great.  It is even better the next day because it holds together better.  Try adding more alfredo and putting over spagetti or fettucini noodles.

This lasagna is great!! I changed a few things however to make it slightly less heavy. I used 1/2 lbs of chicken andouille sausage and 1 1/2 lbs of chicken and instead of two jars of alfredo sauce , I used one light alfredo sauce and 1 jar of spicy pasta sauce. he lasagna also needed to cook a little longer than 1 hour.
Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

Super easy recipe!  I made it with store bought (pre-cooked) chicken, and this cut down cooking time.  It was really good with a salad and bread!  Thanks for the great one!

EDIT::  I have made this into a pasta toss,using bowtie or penne, instead of the lasagna, and LOVE IT!  I totally recomend trying it this way.

This was the BEST recipe I've ever made. Alfredo sauce in a jar isn't very good, so it's best to make it from scratch and it's easy.  My husband loved it too!  Leftovers were just as good.  Worth the price of all the ingredients listed as is!

This was so creamy and melt-in-your-mouth. I have made this for dinner parties and get lots of compliments. I do put in slightly more Cajun seasoning than suggested, however, as I like my food with a lot of spice. I also have expirimented with Texan Chilli flvoured sausage, which is also very yummy.

I am not fond of chicken so when I made this dish the only thing I changed was I replaced the chicken with shrimp.  Our friends now think I am a "super chef" and this has become "the special dish" that is requested for me to make at all of our get togethers!!  Willow, Daleville, AL

I followed pfister62 alfredo sauce recipe and it was great.  YUMMY  I did not use lasagna I had elbow noodles that needed to be used and just layered it up the same way.  I boiled the water and put the elbow noodles in and turned the fire off when I was finished preparing ingredients and making sauce, it just all come together so great.  I made enough and that left overs tasted even better.  I have a family of 8 boy can they be critics and they raved!!!!!!!!!

I halved the recipe, reducing the cooking time to 40 min(since everything in the recipe is already cooked ahead anyway??). This was just awful. Didn't care for the flavor & the andouille was very dry & chewy(overcooked) & the noodles dry also.....no sauce whatsoever after baking. Won't be making this again. Sorry:(

Absolutely delicious. The only change I made was to use the oven ready lasagna noodles and to add a layer of cheese. This was outrageous!

Not great.  I made a homemade alfredo sauce (based on another reviewers comments), so maybe I should have made more, but it wasn't covering the entire dish. Plus I feel like this recipe was lacking in veggies and, in general, ingredients other than meat....

I'll use jarred roasted red peppers along with fresh the next time I make this. Possibly some sun dried tomatoes too.

I thought this just ok.  I did not like the sausage in it.  I also thought it was kind of dry and I followed the recipe as posted.  My husband liked it though, but I will not make it again.

This dish is AMAZING! I did make a few minor changes. I did not preboil my noodles, just spread 2/3 cup alfredo sauce on the bottom of the dish, and poured 3/4-1 cup of water around the edge of the dish right before baking. Perfection! I threw diced green bell pepper in. Couldn't find andouille, so I used sweet Italian turkey sausage.  I used two full 15oz. jars of Classico Creamy Alfredo. Changes for next time: use less chicken (just one whole breast) and shred it. I also will not use the entire 19.5oz. package of turkey sausage. I would like to add some seasoned diced tomatoes to the mixture. Definitely adding this gem to my regular rotation! Calorie-dense, so it's good for a day when you worked out for an hour at the gym in the morning, and shoveled snow for an hour after work!

This was a great recipe.  I followed the reviews on here and used the recipe for homeade alfredo and YUM!  Soooo much better than the store jar stuff.  The sausage in this was really good, too.

I left out the celery and bell pepper as we don't much like it cooked. I browned the chicken and sausage, then just added in the onions and garlic - worked just fine. If I were to make it again, I would add some canned corn, as a previous reviewer suggested. The only other change I made was to put it under the broiler for five minutes to make the cheese really brown and bubbly. This was a rich, tasty and spicy dish. Thanks!

The recipe was excellent. I just made some minor changes. I didn't use the sausages and chicken breast. I used ground chicken (lean) and whole wheat pasta noodles and it tasted fantastic. My husband loved it!

This is so sinfully good!  And even better the next day!  I didn't have andouille sausage so I subbed hot italian sausage, which I removed from the casing before browning.  I used reduced fat jar sauce, which tasted fine but would like to try making my own next time.  I used off-brand no-boil noodles, they didn't get soft enough; won't do that again.  Overall, a very tasty dish.

My family love this combination of flavours! Most recently, I made some changes to suit what I had in the house. I didn't have lasagne pasta, so I used bowtie pasta instead. Also, I used two garlic brats, 1 chicken breast and turkey kielbasa. Rather than measuring out 1/2 a cup of a vegetable I just used two small/medium onions, 1 red bell pepper and 2 stalks of celery, and 3 pressed cloves of garlic this yields a bit more veg, but as I wasn't layering a lasagne, it wasn't a big deal. In place of fatty Alfredo Sauce, I used Campbell's Healthy Choice Cream of Chicken Soup with 1/2 can of Fat Free milk and topped the whole lot with 1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese. Baked it as per the directions, and viola! We had a lovely Cajun Pasta Casserole. Yum!

This was awesome. The texture was perfect and the taste was great.  This is a keeper!  I had to use mild turkey sausage in place of the Andouille because I just could find it.  It came out excellent with this lean substitution.

The idea and the flavor was delicious. I tried to make my own alfredo sauce and it just fell apart and was practically noodles and butter. I hate to say it but perhaps I will use the pre-made alfredo next time...

Yummy! I made some modifications based on what I had, but I am confident you will have great results following the recipe, which is why I give it 5 stars even with my changes. Skipped the sausage and celery and used a variety of bell peppers. My only *complaint* is the method for cooking the chicken-I should've used my common sense but didn't: some pieces were kind of dried out because they were cooked thru and then baked... I would use a lower heat when cooking and be very careful to not overcook at all. **BUT it was still excellent!!

Dh and son loved this. Used Ragu Alfredo Sauce and because we LOVE cheese I added cheese to each layer. My prep time was longer than 15 min but this is a very easy recipe. Dh says to put this one in the "Keeper" file.

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe as did my six-year-old step daughter and picky boyfriend. I made it as close to the receipe as I could - using 3 stalks of celery, one whole red bell pepper and half of a small yellow union. Thank you for this fun and simple recipe!

This is the best lasagna I ever had.  I used the alfredo sauce recipe that was submitted by B. Mason.  I can not wait to cook this for a group.

Holy Cow was this good.  I am certain I will die sooner for having eaten it.  Cream, Butter, 2 Cheeses, Sausage.  Oh man!  I used the top rated Alfredo sauce on this site.  Did I mention how good this it?  Don't be like me and have a second piece.

This tasted great!  My husband loves Cajun food and he seemed to enjoy it.  The only thing I didn't like about the recipe is that it called for a 16oz package of lasagna noodles which would leave a lot of waste if you follow the directions.  I actually had a 13oz package.  I cooked the whole thing and ended up throwing away 6 or 8 noodles.  Too bad because I could have used them the next time.

I loved this recipe.  You can adjust seasonings to fit the spice level you prefer.  Next time, I will make my own bechamel sauce (I don't like using store bought sauces).  Great recipe for something different, and easy to put together.

This. Was. Wonderful!  I am so completely full right now from eating far more of this than was good for me!  I highly recommend making your own alfredo sauce and I added sweet corn per a suggestion from one of the previous reviewers; but I think without the corn it would still be outstanding.   My husband ate about two bites of this and told me I was going to be making this one again.  The dish is really rich so I won't be making it on a weekly basis or anything; but it was SO excellent that it will be on our table again soon.

My son and I made this lasagne for a school project. According to him the kids and his teacher loved it!  We had trouble finding the andouille sausage, but the guy in the meat department pointed out that Johnsonville New Orleans sausages was andouille sausage.  It says so right on the package.  This lasagne smelled wonderful baking!  It doesn't take a whole package of noodles, and I would use more alfredo sauce next time.

This was yummy! I did not have andouille so I used smoked sausage. Also, I used 2-15 oz. jars of Classico light Alfredo sauce and no salt added Cajun seasoning.  I sprinkled extra seasoning on each layer of noodles for extra zip.  The whole family loved this.  I will definitely make again!

I served this to 24 people and everyone just loved it.  I did have the N.O. Andouille in the freezer which made it perfect.  I would not hesitate to make this, exactly as the reciple dictates.  I just would suggest covering the casserole with tin foil for the first 40 minutes becasue it it so dense.  I also used the "oven ready" noodles which were fine.

Oh, this was so rich and wonderful.  I used no-boil lasagna noodles, just put a little Alfredo sauce in the bottom of the pan first.  I covered it with foil for the first 30 minutes because I was afraid it would get too brown.  It was a total hit.  Will definitely make again!

This had way too much meat in it.  I would do half or less of the andouille, and maybe try it with ground beef, instead of chicken, just to mix it up a little.  The flavor was great, and it tasted better the 2nd day, but my husband didn't seem crazy about it, and he loves spicy things.

Really liked this dish! I couldnt find andouille sausage, so I subed hot & spicy brats. I also used penne pasta to save the time of layering the noodles. It was full of flavor! We'll def. eat this one again, although it was a bit spicy, so I'll probably play around with the 'spicy' sausage to find the right one for us. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I'm a recipe follower...but when the grocery store did not have andoiulle sausage, I had to compromise. I used kielbasa sausage and it turned out wonderful! I used the Knoll's Alfredo packet with non-fat milk and the sauce still turned out creamy. Most lasagnas are heavy, btu I felt this one was a perfect blend of meats, cheese, sauce and vegetables. I did cook it at 350 for 45 minutes though...we were in a time crunch. Will make this lots!!! Great as leftovers as well.

Wonderful recipe.  I followed it exactly, except that I didn't have pre-mixed Cajun seasoning, so I mixed my own blend using another recipe.  In so doing, I upped the heat factor a bit by adding extra ground cayenne.  My family and friends loved it so much, I've been booked to make it for them again!

Good, however I found the flavour with the alfredo sauce to be quite overpowering and rich. If I make it again, I think I will somehow dilute the sauce. I also replaced the sausage with YVES Bavarian vegetarian sausage, and it worked out great. My husband loved it.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  He doesn’t like regular lasagna much because of the ricotta cheese in it, so this was right up his alley.  I added a bit more Cajun Seasoning because I decided to use smoked sausage in case it was too hot for us (we are wimps when it comes to heat in foods plus I couldn't find andouille sausage).  But next time I’d like to try ground chicken and ground sausage instead of the chunks of meat.  Very good!

Excellent Recipe!! Served to my Husband and kids(teenage boys), it was gone in minutes.
I sprinkled it with a little cayenne pepper on top of the cheese. I will definitely cook this meal again!

Interesting combination of flavors; not horrible, but I wouldn't make it again (altho hubby says he'd eat it again). Too many noodles; not enuf sauce as written.

There are too many noodles or not enough sauce in this recipe.

First, let me say the taste is incredible!  However, next time I'll probably try it with a penne pasta instead of layering and baking.  I did 3 layers of noodles - there wasn't enough sauce (probably my fault for not interpreting the directions right).  Had it been a tad juicier it would def be 5 stars.  I too used homemade sauce rather than the jarred stuff (I don't care for those).

Overall this is a delicious dish, I just need to find the right wet/dry balance.  :-)

This was Delicious!  We've never had a lasagna other than the traditional tomato sauce or vegetable lasagna's.  So this was a nice change.  Like others say, the definite key to make this good is to make your own alfredo sauce.  Its a must!  The jarred stuff is just gross!  I halved the recipe and it makes plenty for 3-4 people.  It is just my bf and I, so we still had some left-overs for the next day.  I also recommend, if you like your lasagna saucy to add some more sauce than the recipe says.  When putting in the oven the noodles will really soak up a lot of your sauce.  For half the recipe I only used 12 noodles total.  I also added a little chopped tomato into the sauce before layering, and some dried basil.  Andouille sausage is hard to find sometimes and expensive.  So I just used a good quality spicy italian sausage in casings for this.  I really think I liked this italian sausage in it better than the andouille anyways, and it's a whole lot cheaper!  Other than all that, I made everything else the recipe said the same.  This is an excellent recipe and is at the top of our list to make again and again!

Rich, creamy, tangy - what a great combination.  I will definitely make this again.  Spoon some alfredo sauce in the botton of the baking dish before putting in the first layer of lasagna.

I had to make some modifications based on what was in my cupboard - no bell pepper, I used cooked chicken and added at the last minute, made the Alfredo sauce and used smoked sausage and added hot sauce to the Alfredo. Also used Swiss cheese for the mozzarella. It was still great.

Very yummy!  The alfredo sauce you use, along with the cajun seasoning can make a big difference though.  Many popular cajun seasonings are very high in sodium, so I go with a low sodium one because there is plenty of sodium in the sausage and alfredo.  I think it turns out better if you don't use no bake pasta as well.  Another suggestion would be to cook the chicken seperate from the rest and blacken it.  The spices and flavors cling to the meat after baking it in the lasagna.

This was absolutely amazing.  My husband said he could eat it 5 days a week.  I used Classico red pepper alfredo which was very tasty.  I also used mild italian sausage because it would have been to spicy for my kids.

It was a hit at my house, the Ragu Alfredo was a negative.  I used celery salt  instead of real celery but other than that followed the recipe to a T.  Will make again.

I've never had a chicken lasagna before this one.  It was yummy, but was pretty much just noodle, cheese and chicken, I could hardly teast the veggies in it.  I guess if you don't like vegetables  it would be okay.  I don't think I'll make it again, it wasn't that great. And for those of you would want to try it I would really recommend ADD MORE VEGETABLES!!!!!!!

If my rating was based on smell alone, I would rate this 5 stars.  But, the receipe needs some tweaking.  More vegetables are necessary.  The amount listed gets lost in the lasagna.  Plus, you must not use boneless, skinless breast of chicken.  It dries out too much.  I ended up using 3 times the peppers and onions, and could have used more.  Plus, as others have mentioned, make your own sauce.

If I could give this ten stars, I would. I made this for the superbowl gathering and everyone raved about this dish. My very fussy 11 year-old even loved it, which surprised me very much. She usually hates anything with a "kick" of spice to it. Everyone agreed that this recipe is perfect as is with no need for modifications. The flavors meld together so nice and have just the right amount of kick. I will be making this over and over again! Thank you so much for posting this recipe! Update: I can't believe that people are knocking this recipe because their homemade alfredo sauce failed... Ask your grocery store butcher if you can't find the sausage. Most do carry it, but they tend to keep it in unusual places. This recipe is to die for if you follow the directions as written. Note: I'm making this again and realized that I forgot to mention. I use 2 - 15oz. jars of the sauce instead of the 2 - 10oz.  the recipe calls for.

Absolutely delicious! Andouille is difficult to find in my area so I used another type of spicy sausage.  I don't normally rate a recipe unless I follow it exactly.  However, knowing it would be even more delicious with the Andouille, I gave it 5 stars!  My husband and kids loved it!

WOW - this was wonderful. To make it a bit healthier I used whole wheat noodles and butoni light alfredo sauce, I also poached the chicken in spiced water (bay leaf, sage, greek seasoning and pepper) then shredded it and it was fabulous!  This is a definate keeper. The spicey andouile with the creamy alfredo is a delicous combo.

I was lazy and  tossed this w/ pasta and baked it.  I did make the alfredo from scratch. I added sun-dried tomato and garlic to the alfredo and blended.  I had two andouille sausage links in the freezer that I used.  It would be good w/ shrimp added to or instead of the chicken.  I will make again for sure!

I just made this and it was wonderful.  I will add more veggies next time and more garlic.  I used the jar alfredo sauce and added some more spices to it.  I will make my own sauce and add more sauce next time.  Otherwise it is a winner.

I left out the celery & sage. It didnt really taste much different than fettucini alfredo, just with alittle more kick. So if you like fettucini alfredo, you'll like this.

Very filling. It was a nice change, but since I made the Quick & Easy Alfredo Sauce from this site it took a long time to put everything together. Will make again, just not very often because it is very rich.

I did also the make your alfredo - it took about 10 minutes for everything to melt without burning so I made a note for next time to start that earlier.  Will try reducing the amount of butter in that recipe too next time.  Just as good as leftovers! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I wanted to make this for quite awhile so I jumped at the chance when I finally found andouille sausage.  While I liked the flavor of this but it was quite a bit of work.  I think I would prefer this on top of fettucine or something rather than go through the trouble of layering again.  I used store bought alfredo and I think that may also play in the 4 stars I gave vs the 5 stars most other people gave.  Definitely adding more veggies next time and cutting the meat back and cutting it into smaller pieces.

This was so good! I substituted whole wheat lasagna noodles, and turkey sausage to attempt to make it a little bit healthier, but this is still a recipe you have to be careful with because you're going to want to eat it all! In the future I will use about half the amount of meat and add a lot more veggies. On a whim I added broccoli and it tasted wonderful.

This recipe was very tasty! I cut the recipe in half since I am cooking for two - the only complaint was that it didn't stay together very well. I used no bake lasagna noodles and covered dish with foil while cooking - that ensured the noodles were cooked and prevented the cheese from burning. I will definitely make this one again!

Yummy.. This won $400 in a pasta bakes category in 2001 (Better homes and Garden)I only needed about 9 noodles for a 9x13 pan and used 3 tsp cajun seasoning with only 1/4 tsp sage. Also used 2 jars (15 oz each) Bertolli alfredo sauce. True cajun flavor!

So much flavor packed into one pan.  We love this even more than traditional lasagna now.  It's very rich so be warned.  I ended up using 3 jars of sauce when I was in a hurry or 1 1/2 times a standard alfredo recipe when I make my sauce from straight, which I usually prefer to do when I have the time.  For an extra treat, I add 3/4 lb peeled, deveined shrimp and 2 cups chopped mushrooms to the sauce. Let stand for 10-15 minutes before serving and then it won't fall apart on you.

Very good, it really does get better for leftovers.  I added double-triple the veggies.  I used my own mix of spices for the "cajun" spice.  Made my house smell very yummy.

This was a w dinner indeed, I live in a room mate situation where I am the only one who knows how to cook, living in the situation I have a roommate who is a to most anything under the sun, and the two things in this were the Onions and the Bell peppers. In substitute I added a bit more g and I added some red pepper and l salt. Even with out the Onions (the most I to me) and bell peppers this dish came out v well done, next time though I would not used cooked pasta but add more sauce to the bottom of my pan before placing the pasta in as well as I all the layers.  I will d make this again for my funny group of kid's to me all being my kids because its all their f time away from h and I am now there adopted dad.  Thanks to this web site I keep every one on their toe's with what's for dinner.

Won a "Hot N Spicy" contest with this great recipe!  Easy to assemble.  I used jarred alfredo sauce as fresh wasn't available and I wasn't in the mood to make it... This one's a keeper.

This was awesome. Surprisingly easy using no-boil lasagna noodles. Great new twist on a classic recipe. Like Jambalaya and Lasagna combined! So, so good.

I made homemade alfredo sauce with heavy cream, butter garlice, and fresh parm it was delicious. Cooked as directed exactly and butter seperated and was at bottom of dish the noodles were dry and greasy from butter. The top layer was flavorful but not sure why sauce seperated maybe because I used the cream?

One of our favorite recipes with MINOR changes only. I use ground chicken breast and toss with penne or rotini. Also, I put in half the cajun spice and then people who want the extra kick can sprinkle a little extra on their portion.  Even my 2 and 4 year olds like it this way!

After my husbands first bite he said this is "a make again".  That is when I know I have done well and made something he likes.  He is usually our cook.  This recipe is awesome, definitely not a diet food.  I loved this.  Only change was half the sausage and chicken so it was about one lb of meat total.  Great, thank you!

I think I may just be a little out of the loop, but I had no idea what andouille sausage was and couldn't find it anywhere. Grrr. I just used half a roll of the hot ground sausage instead and it was pretty good- it added the right flavor to a cajun recipe. I added a few things to my sauce that were really good to make it go a little further. I added about a 1/2 c. half and half and a few big tablespoons of sour cream. I also added some lemon pepper and basil, which was also good. Good recipe though- maybe next time I'll search a few more sores for some andouille sausage...

I tried this tonight.  I made the homemade sauce version.  My sauce seperated and all the butter ended up at the bottom.  Since there wasn't enough sauce to soak into the noodles, they were burnt and dry.  The kids ate the meat and I picked at what I could.  It was a waste of ingredients.

This was wonderful!  I made it for a Mardi Gras dinner party.  I did triple the vegetables and probably doubled the mozarella cheese as I did sprinkle between the layers.  I intended to make the alfredo sauce myself but was running short on time.  I used the sauce sold in the refrigerated section of the grocery and it was wonderful in the dish.  I highly recommend!

A big hit at dinner!  I made my own alfredo sauce per reviewers but it wasn't thick enough, didn't seem like enough for the filling and the butter separated out making the dish look really greasy when it came out of the oven.  Next time I'll use the jarred stuff or I'll make with rotini pasta and not a lasagna.  Also, I used smoked sausage instead of andouille.  Will make again.

This was a pretty good recipe. Couldnt find any andouille, used spicy sausage. I did make my own alfredo, but I was lazy with everything else. Tossed sauce, cheese, sauted veggies, and meat in one pot with cooked bowtie pasted, mixed together. Poured in pan topped with cheese and baked. Husbahd said it had good flavor, but was a little too greasy. Haven't tasted leftover yet, but Im thinking it'll be good.

I and my entire family loved this lasagna. Great recipe. We despise premade alfredo so of course I made my alfredo. I did use Lousisiana girls recipe instead of my own, however, I used heavy cream instead of 1/2 and 1/2 and used an extra cup...was too thick with cheese otherwise. I gave a chunk to my cousin and she said it was the kind of thing she would buy at a restaurant. Great!

This was a terrific idea! I did the homemade alfredo and added a teaspoon of Tabasco sauce to the alfredo and it is amazing! I'll be making this again and again. I know it's got plenty of calories, but you don't have to have a gigantic portion to enjoy it.

This was great!  I used whole wheat penne pasta and added some shrimp.  I used jarred alfredo sauce and it turned out fine.  Hubby loved it, will definitely make again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is one of the best recipes I've gotten from this site.  As other reviewers suggested, I made my own Alfredo sauce.  I added Mozzerella to each layer not just at the top.

Very delicious! I would have given 5 stars if the time estimates would have been accurate - took way more than 15 minutes prep time.

The dish was just too rich. The Cajun seasoning, garlic, onions, and chicken were delicious but the sausage made the meal just too heavy on the meat side. It needed something for balance... Tomatoes? Corn? Maybe even rotelle? I plan to serve the chicken mixture with rice next time - it was very yummy.

3 Stars, ONLY because I was unable to follow the recipe exactly.  I used 1 jar of alfredo, 1 jar of marinara.  I did not have any sage.  It was delicious, my kids ate it, and my husband had a 2nd helping!

Definitely a true cajun dish if you make your own sauce (a stick of butter, loaded with cheese and saugsage!).  I think I would've preferred it over fetuccine with a bit less cheese.  (The hubby and kiddo were fans!)

The flavor of this was very good, although I used no boil noodles and I think that is where I went wrong.  The noodles abosorbed the sauce therefore mine was dry.  Anyone else used these type of noodles?

Amazing! The best recipe I've found on here yet! I used smoked sausage instead of andouille because I couldn't find it, used a whole red pepper, whole onion, and more Cajun seasoning than it called for. Perfect!

This was amazing! I love cajun food and this had just the right amount of spice. Next time I will make my own alfreo sauce, but its still great with the Ragu Garlic Parmesean sauce! Definately a favorite and will most definately make again!

This was very good and different. The only thing i was confused about in the recipe is that it called for 16 oz package of lasagna noodles and to only cover the bottom with 4 and then add some filling and repeat layers covering the top with noodles too. which accounts for 12 noodles... half of my package went to waste.
I think i added more cajun seasoning than it suggested and i think if i hadnt it would have been plain, but i also used lowfat sausage not andoulle so i bet that omitted much of the flavor.
My Bf loved it... he 1/3 the first night and the rest the second night.

I used Johnsonville New Orleans stlye Sausage. I cooked chicken for 6 min then added sliced sausages for 3-4 min. I used a whole red onion, a whole red pepper and 1 Jalapeno along with 3 celery stalks. For the Alfredo sauce I used 2 15oz jars of Bertolli Garlic Alfredo sauce. 2 C of Provel cheese. Pretty solid dish and not alot of labor involved. A fun different way to prepare Lasagna.

Great, creamy lasagna.  A bit spicy for the kids, but the adults loved it.  I will definitely make this dish again.  Maybe next time served over fettucine as suggested.

This was good.  Got lots of compliments from the guests.  very rich.  i used hot italian sausage instead of andouille because my grocery store did not have it.  everyone liked it.  also you do not need that many lasagna noodles.

This was very tasty, it smelled so good when it was cooking, I could not wait for it finish.  I adjusted the amounts as I made a smaller portion, and instead of celery I used red pepper.  Very rich with the sausage and alfredo sauce, but worth it every now and then!

One word - fabulous!!!!   My 10 year old son rated it a 100 on a scale of one to ten and my husband kept asking for seconds (twice).   It was easy to prepare and looked great.  I think I'll serve it for my son's first communion party in April!

Very good, unique lasagna.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed this dish last night, and he declared that it is his new favourite food!  I decided to add to the presentation by spooning some reserved alfredo sauce over the top after slicing and placing on a plate, and sprinkling with 1 tsp. of parmesan cheese and a dash of parsley just before serving.  The only thing I would do differently next time would be to pour a thin layer of sauce at the bottom of the baking dish before layering (I used oven-ready noodles).  I will definately be making this again.

very good! I did not use the whole package of noodles, don't know why it calls for a whole package. I also just used one jar (16oz.) of sauce.
I made this for the 1st time last night while my in-laws were visiting and they liked it! It's full of flavor and spicy!! I will be making again.

I really enjoy this lasagna. I made it a bunch of times, but not recently as my wife doesn't eat pork, so I can only make it if someone else is eating it too. But really good, very flavorful. The spiciness of the sausage goes real well with the creaminess of the alfredo sauce. It is a very rich lasagna.

Turned out great! Made homemade Alfredo as another user suggested. Added a little paprika, nutmeg and a day if lemon juice to the sauce. Halved the recipe in 2 - 9x9 pans and froze half for another day. Used the oven ready lasagna noodles and cooked a little over a half hour in the smaller pan.

This tastes very good, but it is kind of dry which is very odd for lasagna.  More alfredo next time, I guess.

I made quite a few changes, so even though I would give what we ate 5 stars, I will give the recipe 4 for being a good place to start. I didn't really measure any of the veggies, just sort of used what "looked" right.  I had 14 oz jars of Alfredo instead of 10, and 12 oz of Andouille instead of a pound. I also used WAY more cheese. I put a thin layer of sauce (from the second jar, not the sauce/meat/veggie mix) at the bottom of the pan, then layered noodles, meat sauce, cheese, four times total. Then I topped it with the rest of the jar of sauce, more cheese, and the parm.  We inhaled the results. I will make this again and again!

Wowwww, the flavors are wonderful! I halved the recipe, except for veggies, used listed amounts because they'll cook down and I love them. I did use a quality jarred alfredo (LOVE the idea about making it fresh but didn't have the ingredients on hand;-), added 1/2 tsp each of poultry seasoning & thyme,  kicked it up with "Slap Ya Mama" Cajun seasoning & rubbed sage, & substituted "Super Green" pasta instead of standard lasagna. It's perfectly balanced as others reviewers mentioned, not runny & easy to serve. GREAT JOB SAIDANDDONE!

This recipe tasted delicious, but I ran into two issues that need to be remedied when I make this next time.  First, I ended up with a ton of oil separating out of the sauce.  The whole lasagna pan was full of oil on the bottom and sides.  I used a slotted spoon and pre-plated each piece of lasagna to drain the oil out of each serving.  Additionally, the top layer of cheese browned way too much and became too hard and crusty a layer.  Normally I love that crispy top layer of cheese, but this was way too much.  I had not set knives out, but had to provide them for cutting through the top.  Unsure how to bake the lasagna through (for full hour) without this happening except to reduce amount of Parmesan or perhaps timing of final layer of cheese?

Everyone that tried it LOVED it. 
I used rotisserie chicken that I had from the night before and didn't do all the separating. I cooked the onions, garlic and peppers in some butter till soft then just added the chicken, sausage and seasonings. I also added Cayenne Pepper. Gave it a nice kick. Alfredo came last along with more Cayenne. I didn't have mozzarella, so I used Colby jack... along with shaved Parmesan. It worked very well.  

I'll definitely make this again. A real crowd pleaser and a nice change from the norm.

I've made this several times, never failed me once. The first time was for a large gathering, so I made two pans, with homemade Alfredo and no celery. I almost didn't get any, it went so fast. Now when I say I'm making a lasagna, this is what the family assumes I mean....

I make it the same way every time. It disappears the same way (at the same speed) every time!

This dish was so wonderful! I made homemade alfredo as other users suggested, some of my measurements were off but it still came out delicious.  Just next time I won't use as much cheese, which was my fault lol. My husband loved it and had to stop himself from eating to much before going to bed. Overall this is a superb recipe and new favorite in my house!

I made this almost exactly as written.  I just made my own alfredo sauce and used penne noodles (Because I have children who don't eat sauce on noodles, they ate the extra penne with butter), which I cooked 3/4 of the way and then mixed it together and put it in a covered baking pan with mozzarella cheese on top.  I baked it for 25 minutes covered, took the lid off and baked it for 5 more minutes and let it sit for 10 minutes.  

This was very good and different, just what I was looking for.

I used oven ready lasagna noodles but I will use regular noodles next time.  The top layer of noodles bubbled up kinda goofy like otherwise I would have taken a picture.  But it was very delicious!

No I did not make any changes except I used green bell pepper instead of red. This is one of my most outstanding meals that I have ever cooked. Yes I will do it again & yes I will refer this to family & friends.  This recipe gets a five star rating from me. *****

I made this as one of my Thanksgiving entrees and my family absolutely loved it.  I followed another reviewer's comments and made my own alfredo sauce.  (2 c half and half, 3 c parmesan, 1 stick butter and finely chopped garlic).  When I make this sauce again I would use less parmesan cheese and make certain that it is low salt.  In terms of the original recipe my family likes a hearty lasagna so I would use  1 1/2 pounds each of the sausage and the chicken breast.  You can adjust the chopped vegetables accordingly.  
Definitely one I will make again!

I made this dish for my family and they loved it. I omitted the onion and celery and added stewed tomatoes (cut up) and mushrooms. I also added a layer of cottage cheese.I also used ready-to-bake lasagna noodles to save time. Turned out fantastic!

I made this recipe twice in one day.  I took other reviewers advice and I found this WAY too salty.  Use turkey sausage if you make your own Alfredo.

Amazingly good. Took the advice of a reviewer, making the sauce myself. Even with botching the sauce  (got distracted and let it cook without stirring enough), this meal came out fantastic. I served it to our women's church group  (botched sauce and all), and ended up emailing several ladies the recipe on the spot. I cant imagine how it could have tasted any better! A definite repeat for years to come.

Yes! Idk why I haven't reviewed this yet, but it has been a huge hit for years in my family. I use Johnsonville hot links, Ragu garlic Parmesan Alfredo, and no onions as my husband won't eat them. It's definitely heavy on the calories, but for a treat meal it's the perfect one!

This was Amazing!!! 10 Stars!! I made a couple changes but not enough to change the recipe that much. Omitted sausage, my son didn't want it, omitted sage, not my favorite spice. Added mushrooms, asparagus, and made my own Alfredo as other reviews suggested. Mixed it all together with penne and put in a baking dish. Sprinkled about two handfuls of mozzarella  cheese on top and baked for about 30 minutes. Topped with fresh chopped tomatoes to serve.  I used Asiago Parmesan for my Alfredo and added Cajun seasoning to both the chicken as directed and 1 tsp to the sauce. Could have used more!   This was heavenly!! Served with salad and fresh baked garlic rolls I found in the freezer section. I cannot wait until leftovers tomorrow!!!! This is a keeper!!!!!!!

Made this according to the directions, but subbed ground Italian sausage (hot), because it was half the price of andouille, made homemade Alfredo (thank you LouisianaGirl), and used oven ready (no cook) lasagna noodles.  This was fantastic.  Terrific combination of flavors - creamy and perfect level of spice!!  Not for the extremely health-conscious or everyday eating (so fatty!!), but superb for special occasion.  Much thanks!!!

Love! Love! Love this recipe!  My husband is an Alfredo Sauce freak, so He loved it too!  I actually changed it quite a bit (just because I didn't have all the ingredients)  I left out the sausage and onion.  I added chopped carrots and Italian salad dressing mix.  And I mixed all of the Alfredo sauce in with the chicken and veggies!  It was sooo creamy and delicious!  I will buy the ingredients and follow the recipe next time!!

I made this recipe tonight and it was FABULOUS!!!  Probably the best lasagna I have ever had!  I changed a couple of things though.  I couldnt find any andouille sausage, so I just used regular Jimmy Dean hot breakfast sausage, and I left out the celery.  I also made my own alfredo sauce
. I tripled my alredo sauce recipe and still only had enough to do 2 layers, so I will 4x it next time.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!  Its definately a keeper around here! Its out of this world!!!

Very good variation for lasagna.  Based on prior reviews, I prepared my own Alfredo Sauce (Quick and Easy) from this site and increased the veggies.  Also had some leftover ham and shrimp in the fridge, and added those as well.,  Very rich and tasty!

This had a good taste but did not make enough sauce for lasagna.  I ended up making extra sauce.  I did not use sage or nearly the amount of onions, peppers, celery or garlic as it called for and it still turned out very tasty.  Next time I will serve it over fettucine noodles instead.  Oh, and I used chicken thighs instead of breast meat and it tasted great.  I will make this again but it is very rich so you can't eat much of it at one sitting!

This recipe was awesome. Tried it for a small dinner party and they ate every single bite. Would definitely cook it again.

It was just okay for us.  My husband told me I could leave this one out of the recipe box.  I probably won't make again without making some major changes.  I like the idea of this recipe, though.

This was wonderful, the only changes we made was I did use homemade alfredo sauce and cut out the sage.  Total Total comfort food.  Thanks for the great post.

I substituted some of the spices for other spices, and sausage for pepperoni but those are just personal preferences. It freezes wonderfully too. If you have to reheat in the microwave try putting some alfredo sauce on top to keep it from getting dried out and gross from reheating.

This was amazing! I made it for five people, including myself, and we devoured all of it! However, the texture left a little to be desired, as it had a tendency to fall apart and not stay together like a traditional lasagna would. In any case though, it was delicious and I would definitely make it again! One more note: I would definitely add more vegetables to this dish!!

So delicious and impressive!!!  Very rich and creamy - the sausage does add some spice!!! I served it with a simple salad and warmed herb bread. This is a great dish for company and fairly easy - not for those on a diet...!!!

I cut the recipe in half for 2 of us and we had leftovers for 2 more meals. My boyfrined loved this. It was rich and creamy and sure had a kick, even with substituting italian sausage. It's very filling...so pace yourself. :) Thanks for the recipe...I'm sure we'll have it many times to come.

Excellent recipe - spicy but not too spicy.  If you like pasta and Cajun food, this is a must try!

This is an awesome recipe, but, I would suggest using Italian sausage instead of the Andouille sausage because it's super spicy when adding cajun seasoning to it. The Italian sausage keeps it spicy enough without having your mouth watering and on fire the whole time.

Ohh my ohh my! A rich creamy meal that is worth very calorie. The market did not have the andouille sausage, so I used Emeril's spicy smoked sausage. BAM! What a meal!

Ended up going the fettucine route...We loved this! I did think it would come together a bit quicker but it was very warm and satisfying after sitting out in the cold watching a soccer game. Will make this many more times. I think next time I will make my own alfredo sauce.
