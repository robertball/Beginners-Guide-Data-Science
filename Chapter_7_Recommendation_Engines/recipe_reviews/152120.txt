Hi.  I'm the creater of this recipe; here are some helpful hints:

For those of you who tossed the batter because it was thick - so sorry!  It IS thick - pumkin and pudding mix do that.  For those of you in the future who get worried, don't!  
*****
Some people have commented on the difficulty of finding crystalized ginger.  It's the same as candied ginger, sugared ginger, or ginger chips - they are all just different names/sizes.  The two best places I can always find it, and really inexpensively, are Publix, in the bulk items ($5 a pound) and World Market - $3 for a jar or the ginger chips by the Ginger People (they sell them on their website, too, but they are a little more$).
*****
If you are getting more of a muffin than a cupcake, you're not creaming your sugar and butter long enough.  It should be really fluffy.  You'll probably want to scoop the batter into the tins.

I loved these. I followed the recipe, minus the crystalized ginger. Still VERY good! Moist, delicious cupcakes with the taste of the season in them. I made a simple cream cheese frosting with 4oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup butter, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon. What a hit with everyone!

I set out a pkg. of cream cheese to soften while the cupcakes cooled. We decided to try a couple while we waited. They were so good and moist, I put the cream cheese back in the fridge. I'll use it for something that can actually be improved by frosting it. The best cupcake I've ever tasted! (Maybe a light dusting of powdered sugar for those who want to dress them up visually, but as far as flavor goes, they're perfect.)

Wow, these cupcakes are outrageously delicious.  I made a couple of modifications: (1) instead of using 1 cup butter, I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce; and (2) I only used 3 large eggs, not 4.  Also, usually when I bake cupcakes, I lightly spray the inside of the foil with vegetable oil so the cupcakes don't stick too much to the wrapper.  Baked them for twenty minutes.  I used a vanilla frosting and then decorated them with Halloween themed sprinkles.  I think these would be perfect for a holiday party.  They are scrumptious - so moist!  Thank you for the recipe.  I will also make them around Thanksgiving.

Just as a warning, the mixture had tons of tiny flecks of butter-sugar no matter if you use room temperature eggs or cold ones.  Go on and add the dry ingredients and the lumps will disappear. I left out the crystallized ginger (couldn't find it), so upped the ginger to 1/2 tablespoon.  The first time I made this recipe, I baked it in a bundt pan for about 45 minutes, then frosted it with tinted store bought cream cheese frosting to look like a pumpkin- covered an ice cream cone in green frosting for the stem.  The cake turned out really, really well- so moist and with great flavor and really cute.  The second time I actually made it into cupcakes!  I frosted the cupcakes with cream cheese frosting made by beating together 8 oz softened cream cheese, 1/2 cup softened salted butter, 3 1/2-4 cups powdered sugar, and 1/2 tablespoon butter flavoring.  I know the butter flavoring sounds bizarre, but it somehow mellows out and brings the other flavors together.  The wonderful frosting on the fantastic cupcakes made these some of the best cupcakes I've ever had!

If I could give this more stars I would!!!  It's AMAZING!!!  I was out of crystallized ginger so I used 1 1/4 tsp. of ground ginger instead, but didn't change one other thing!  Moist, delicious and my family gobbled them up!  I also used the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" with this...it's also quite amazing!!

I tasted the batter before I baked these and my first impression was that I would be leaving a 5-star review.  The flavor is great - tastes just like pumpkin pie!  The cupcakes baked up nicely too.  But... first of all, the yield is off - this recipe makes more than 24 cupcakes, so plan ahead. Second, 20 minutes is not enough cooking time.  Plan on about five minutes longer.  Last, and most important, while the flavor is wonderful, in large part because of the peppery, crystallized ginger, the texture is a little "gummy,' for lack of a better word.  A little TOO moist, maybe, and even a little too sweet - I suspect the pudding mix is the culprit. I'm sure this recipe, minus the pudding mix, would produce a far better result.

These are fantastic!!  I didn't have any butterscotch pudding so I used vanilla but other than that I followed the recipe as written.  Everybody LOVED them! My stepdaughter even said they were better than the ones they sell in the coffee shop where she works!!  I frosted them with the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site (which is also fantastic) and decorated them as eyeballs for Halloween.  A huge, huge hit!  These are definitely a keeper.

I made this as a cake, and it came out unbelievably moist. I used a mix of unbleached and oat flour, and I used fresh pumpkin, which I baked and then pureed with the wet ingredients. The market was out of crystallized ginger, so I used fresh. This is so moist and delicious, it doesn't even need frosting, but I'm sure it would be great topped with whipped cream--just like pumpkin pie.

Wow! These are amazing and easy to make. I halved the recipe, and made mini cupcakes instead of full sized ones (adjusted the baking time down to 16 minutes). I also didn't have any cloves, so I left them out - they were still delicious! Might try adding some nuts to the batter next time, but will definitely make again.

I just made these cupcakes and they are very good. I didn’t have crystallized ginger on hand so I used 1 1/4 teaspoons of ground ginger instead .The batter yielded 30 regular cupcakes (filling the muffin liners half full). Filling them half way gives you plenty of room to cover the cupcakes with frosting so the cupcakes don't dry out. They came out  very moist and fluffy. The next time I make them, I am going to use ½-cup butter and a ½-cup applesauce. I used cream cheese and butter frosting with cinnamon and vanilla … yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!
If your cupcakes fall during the baking process it could be because…
* your butter is not room temp (do not microwave)
* you don't cream the butter until light before adding the sugar
* you throw many things in at the same time
* you don't scrape down the bowl a few times while butter & sugar are creaming
* your eggs are cold when you add them to the butter-sugar light fluffiness
* you add all your eggs at once
* you don't sift your flour and leavening
* you dump all your dries in at once

Amazing cupcakes!  Moist and tender, great flavor.  The crystallized ginger adds just the right amount of kick.  I forgot to get butterscotch pudding mix at the store, so I used what I had in my pantry - french vanilla pudding mix.  I loved the result!  For those not familiar with crystallized ginger, it is ginger that has been dried and sugared.  When you first bite into it, it has a sweet lemony flavor, but then as you start chewing, you are hit with a peppery zing.  A very interesting ingredient, and a perfect addition to these cupcakes!  I found that I did have to bake the cupcakes more like 27 minutes (my oven runs cooler, so I actually baked them at 355, but it still took 27 minutes for them to be done).  They are wonderful unfrosted, but I couldn't help frosting half the batch with "Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting" from this site.  The combination is amazing!

100% perfection. I followed the recipe to the letter...there's not a thing that needs to be changed. The zip and texture of the crystalized ginger makes this recipe for me. I frosted them with cinnamon cream cheese frosting and sprinkled on a bit of cinnamon and sugar to finish. Absolutely wonderful...I make a LOT of cupcakes and this is going into my favorites folder!

Hit of the party.  I had someone say, "These are to die for!"  The guests @ the party also said that these were easily better than a local cupcakery (that charges a small fortune for a cupcake)!  I did replace 1 stick of butter with appplesauce and used extra ground ginger instead of the crystallized ginger.  Used vanilla pudding instead of butterscotch b/c that is all I had on hand.  Frosted w/ a cinnamon cream cheese icing - 8oz crm. chz., 1 stick butter, 2tsp vanilla, 2tsp (or more) cinnamon, and 3c powdered sugar.  Amazing!
**Update** Short on time and made this in a 9x13 pan @ 350 for 40ish minutes.  Still delicious!!!

These cupcakes were fabulous. I was looking for a new way to use up fresh pumpkin and these were it! I used Splenda and no-salt margarine instead of the sugar and butter and noticed no difference. I also used nutmeg instead of the all-spice and left out the crystallized ginger. I topped with canned cream cheese icing and that took these over the top. They were easy to make and baked up perfectly. Will definitely make them again.

I agree with the reviewers that these were very moist and the spices were nice.  However, the end result was a bit sweet for my liking - especially when iced.  Admittedly, I have a sensitive sweet tooth.  I don't like very sweet things.  I used a cream cheese icing for these cupcakes.  Perhaps a dark chocolate icing would be better?  Or, maybe try this without icing.

I just made these for the first time for my family's Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow. They are possibly the best cupcakes I have ever had in my life.  The local grocery store didn't have any crystallized ginger, so I used 2 tsp. instead of 1/2 tsp of round ginger, and added a tablespoon of sugar to the dry ingredient mix.  I rubbed butter on the cupcake/muffin pan before putting the batter in. The batter was extremely thick, almost like a cookie dough. They looked like blobs of cookie dough when I put them in the oven, but formed nicely while in the oven.  I removed them after performing a "toothpick test". When removing them, I simply had to turn the pan over and most came right out with no additional effort. They are beautifully even inside, very soft and fluffy. I shared them with my brother and my mom, and they were both extremely impressed.  The recipe yielded 1 dozen cupcakes and 3 small loaves of Pumpkin Ginger Cake.   There are only two regrets I had with this: 1. The one thing they could be improved with is a little bit of cream cheese frosting. 2. I'm very sad that I didn't double or triple the recipe. I would love to eat more before tomorrow, and I'm sure the the holiday will yield NO LEFTOVERS in this department.  I will definitely be making this recipe again, and next time I'll be sure to make a LOT more!

LOVED THESE! I made these for my son's first birthday. I wanted to make something that had some nutritional value, so I made these with a few modifications. I used about 1/2 Quinoa flour and made with all organic ingredients. It was hard to find an organic butterscotch pudding, but I was able to find one at Whole Foods. These were a huge hit!! Most people ate more than one! I will double the recipe next time because they go fast!!

these are wonderful as is that is why i am giving this a 5*. i will make these again and will cut back on the sugar to suit my taste to help balance a cream cheese icing. this would be a great base to try to transfer into a carrot cake recipe. great spice level. thanks for the recipe.

These cupcakes really are good.  Everyone loved them; including the grandkids.  I wouldn't leave out the ginger, that's what made them special. I did use 1 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice plus cinnamon for ease and the second time I used crisco butter flavor shortening with no difference.

I also left out the candied ginger.  Not the easiest thing to find in the store and I'm not a huge fan.  VERY, very moist and tasty recipe though!  I made them for my baby shower and EVERYone loved them.

I am so disappointed!  I must have done something wrong since everyone else seems to have had such fantastic results on these.  I followed the instructions and the amounts of ingredients.  The batter tasted SO good!  Unfortunately, it was incredibly thick.  Just trying to drop it into the muffin cups was a nightmare and I could not smooth it out.  The recipe says to "pour" the batter into muffin cups.  This was impossible as the batter was so thick it was like mud.  Needless to say, they did not bake up well and now I'm stuck with nothing to take to a party tonight. :(

very good!  I would not frost these since they have the texture of a muffin and not a cupcake.  Don't shy away from the crystallized ginger... it does not overpower at all.  Tasty... I ate 3 today!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and these came out divine.  I did use fresh pumpkin.  The crystallized ginger is a super addition.  Thank for the recipe.  My little boy devoured his cupcake!  I plan to use this time and time again.  I think cream cheese frosting would be great on them too.  :)

I didn't have any crystallized ginger, but they were fantastic without it. I made an orange cinnamon glaze (powdered sugar, cinnamon, orange juice, milk) instead of frosting and they were so moist and delicious!

These were really good.. I topped them with cream cheese frosting. I accidentally bought a can of the pumpkin pie filling, so I left out a little of the evaporated milk.. In addition, I added some pumpkin pie spice rather than the individual spices.

Delicious! These are very moist and flavorful. Mine took longer to bake - closer to 27 minutes. After baking the tops sank somewhat. I made up for that with the frosting. I topped these with Maple Cream Cheese Frosting from this site. I also added a little crystalized ginger to each. I took them to work and they disappeared quickly. Thanks for a great recipe!

Super delicious and so light with a little crispy crust. I tried half the recipe and need to make more tomorrow. It made 12 regular size muffins and 12 little mini ones. I baked those for just 10 minutes. Kids love the little bite size cupcakes.

Fantastic Pumpkin recipe!  I was a bit worried with the stiffness of the batter but they came out perfect.  I used the Crystalized Ginger and not shyly and think it is the perfect spicy counterpoint to the the earthy tastes of the pumpkin and aromatic spices.  Love Love this recipe.  Thank You!

This stands at three stars right now. 5 if flavor was my only concern. I cook for a living and followed all the steps to the letter. My issue is that this recipe seems to make more than 24 and take longer than 20 minutes to bake (and I have an oven thermometer that says the temp is right on). I tried it twice. The second time I didn't even put all the batter in the 24 cups, yet it still was too much. I started checking at 20 minutes and kept them in several longer but they still were not done. My recomendation would be to definately try this recipe but don't try to fit all the batter into 24 cups, and to bake at least 25 minutes. ALSO, be warned that these are incredibly sweet. If you want to ice them I would think that a very  lightly sweetened cream cheese would be best. I often cut my sugar in cream cheese frosting in half and think that would work well on these. Good luck!

The best cupcakes i've ever had.  I could not find crystallized ginger so I left it out and I iced with a basic cream cheese icing.  Ive also made them using cheesecake pudding mix (so i didnt have to run to the store).  They are moist, flavorful, and perfect for the holidays.  I probably made 4 different batches this year...all delicious.  Highly recommended!!!

I make these every Halloween & my family just loves them.  I prepare them in patterned Halloween muffin cups to add to the Spooky Festivities!  I've even experimented with increasing the spices and that works well too!

Just to let people know you can now find Crystalized Ginger in most grocery stores in the spice aisle. It is expensive though so you can also get it at a Chinese/Japanese grocery store for a about 1/4 of the price. I make a pumpikin bread like this and can't wait to try the cupcakes today!!!

These were delicious!  I made them for Halloween and everyone loved them.  I took the advice of a previous reviewer and substituted half of the butter for applesauce and they were very moist and wonderful.

Absolutely amazing, fantastic, fabulous cupcakes! This is by far my favorite recipe on AR and deserves every bit of the 5 stars. The only change I made was substituting half of the butter for 1/2 cup applesauce + 2 tablespoons of veggie oil. The consistency, texture and flavor are perfect. Thank you so much for the recipe!

these were very good.  Very moist, they got better after the first day for some reason. I just sprinkled powder sugar on the top.  I will leave out the allspice next time. I don't care for that spice. But even with it they were tasty!

I used this recipe last night after reading all of the great reviews and I have to say that I was not disappointed. I didn't have the crystallized ginger, but I used the ground ginger and it turned out delicious! The cupcakes are very moist, so you don't even need an icing, but I'm sure icing would taste great.

Holy Moley were these GOOD!  I've made about 4 batches of these now.  My favorite were the ones that I filled the cupcake 1/2 way, dropped in a dab of cream cheese frosting and spooned batter on top.  Came out fantastic and were SO easy to pack in lunches.  YUM.

These were awesome!  I made mine with wheat flour and we cooked them in mini bundt pans.  No icing or anything, we ate them as they were for about a week.  Dad took them with lunch, I ate them as dessert.  Wonderful, moist and full of flavor!

These are great.  A coworker told me that they are his new favorite cupcake. They smell terrific when baking.  I had to substitute vanilla pudding for the butterscotch pudding but otherwise I made them just like the recipe states.  I frosted them using the cream cheese frosting II recipe from this site.

Fantastic. I made these as regular and mini muffin sized, both were terrific. I did use the crystallized ginger, but will forgo it next time, as it is too expensive to use when simply adding more ground ginger would create the same taste. I also added glazed walnuts on top, which were great also, and helped add texture (also negating the need for crystallized ginger). Wonderful, everyone that had one raved and ended up having several more!

best pumpkin flavored thing i've ever put in my mouth! just made these. sampled one mini cupcake.... had to have 2 more immediately after. totally doesn't need frosting but i'll probably make some cream cheese frosting II just to dress them up. I omitted the candied ginger (though, if diced well - i can see how that would be amazing in these!) and my supermarket only had sugar free butterscotch (which didnt come in a 3.4 oz package) so I subbed seasonal "limited edition" pumpkin spice instant pudding. YUM! the batter def wasn't "pour"able but it was still pretty easy to handle. I got 24 mini cupcakes, 6 reg cupcakes and a small pan out of one recipe. also, batter doesn't rise THAT much - fill the tins 3/4 full. So excited to get back to eating these, and bringing them to work tmrw!

I made these by family request for an Autumn-like dessert. I wasn't that keen as the spices aren't a favourite flavour for me. Wow! What a wonderful  delicious surprise. I was able to make 30 cupcakes - Bonus.

VERY Good!!  My family and friends loved them. I made these a couple of weeks ago, and I am making them again. I used a cream cheese frosting and decorated with halloween sprinkles. Big hit at my house.

These were the most AMAZING cupcakes!  Easy to make and so much flavor!  Like other reviewers said - even if you are not a fan of pumplkin (because I'm not) - you'll like these. I topped them with cream cheese frosting and took them to work - they were a hit!  Definitely will make them again this year!

LOVE IT!! I made minor adjustments due to what I had on hand. I omitted the crystallized ginger and substituted 1 1/4 t pumpkin pie spice for the ginger, allspice, and cloves. I topped them with the cream cheese frosting II recipe from this site to which I added some pumpkin pie spice and after a couple of hours in the fridge they are perfection. I ate one (actually 2) while they were warm and they were good, but chilled with the frosting was wonderful. Can't wait to try it with the ginger.
UPDATE: I still haven't tried it with the crystallized ginger, but wanted to say I make these just about weekly. I was a die hard chocoholic, but now I crave these just as much. Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

I made a test batch of cupcakes, set them out to cool, and when I got home they were gone!  I will make a cake with them today topped with the Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting for a dessert auction.  They're really are that good!  Thanks.

Followed the directions and didn't care for the results. Batter was really thick, kind of ended up tasting like the bread from starbucks. I wouldn't make again.

Tried these Nov 2010.  Moist and good.  Ginger took me a couple of stores to find.  Put pumpkin candies on top and all the kids wanted one :)  Wished I had candy corns, it was for a Thanksgiving luncheon.

I loved these! Made cream cheese frosting to go with. Only thing is - could not find a 3.4 oz package of pudding mix... all I could find was 1 oz packages. Anyone encounter this?

So moist and flavorful.  Doesn't need much in the way of frosting, will overpower the wonderful flavor.  The cupcakes were a big hit.  I noticed that the leftovers were being eaten for breakfast by my visiting family!

I booboo'd I think! I actually made the butter scotch pudding and use it in the recipe! Since it didn't turn out well I'm thinking I was only supposed to use the powder...wish the recipe specified that...DON'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE! But am trying again tomorrow...oh, and the Ginger I got was real sticky after cutting it...how do you fix that? Will update soon. **Made them again and used just the pudding mix powder instead of making the mix first and WOW!!! I totally love these and so did my in-laws! I did not use the crystalized ginger and I added about 1/2 a teaspoon more of vanilla and then I sprinkled the tops with powdered sugar then iced with Pillsbury Cream Cheese frosting then dusted the frosting lightly with cinnamon. MMM-MMM-MMM!!! 5 STARS!

Wow! These were a complete hit at the Halloween Party we attended. I only omitted the cloves because I didn't have any. I topped them w/ a cream cheese frosting and dusted the tops w/ graham cracker crumbs. Thanks!

Man o man!  These were good!  I highly recommend.  Loved by ALL the adults at our Halloween party.  The kids were mixed the next day (one licked the icing off & one only wanted the cupcake), but being an adult, I was VERY happy.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!!  I put a cream cheese icing on these & they were phenomenal.

I followed the recipe exactly except for using pumpkin pie spice in place of individual cinnamon/nutmeg/allspice/etc.  I also topped mine with the Cinnamon Cream Cheese frosting that can be found with the Pumpkin spice muffin recipe on the site.  They were an absolute hit!  They disappeared so fast, I only got to try one of the whole 2 dozen that I made.  I think the frosting really put these over the top from great to irresistable!

I didn't have the c. ginger, used more ginger as suggested. Also, used some pumpkin spice instead of allspice and a pkg. of sugar-free french vanilla pudding instead of butterscotch. Hard to tell when they were done due to tops of muffins being sticky/moist...but definitley needs more cooking time. That being said, these are divine muffins. But I do think it is more of a Gingerbread or a Ginger Muffin......the pumpkin is basically a "secret moistening ingredient." I also think cream cheese frosting would be too heavy for these...I was in heaven with a topping of (fat free) Cool Whip.

Delicious!  I made them for a Halloween party, and iced them the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site.  I used French Vanilla pudding mix, as my local supermarket did not have butterscotch, and I omitted the crystallized ginger.  They were a big hit!  Thanks!

I made these last night, I made no changes except I didn't have crystallized ginger, and they turned out SO GOOD! I could have eaten all of them right out of the oven! It's a great fluffy batter, lots of flavor! I did make a simple cream cheese frosting and they are perfect with it. YUMMY!!!

Another perfect rating for a perfect cupcake.  I omitted the things I didn't have, which were the crystallized ginger, allspice, and cloves.  I added nutmeg and upped the ground ginger to 1 tsp. since I didn't have the crystallized stuff on hand.  Soooo good.  I made a cream cheese icing from 8 oz. of 1/3 fat cream cheese, about a Tbsp. of shortening, and enough confectioner's sugar to make it a good icing consistency.  Heaven!

These were great! They were the perfect density and moist. The icing was wonderful as well! If anybody has ever had the punpkin log that has the cream cheese filling, these were of a similar taste just in cupcake form. I will definitely be making these cupcakes a fall staple at my house!

These were amazing!!!!! I liked them without any frosting, while the rest of the family (who are all sugar lovers) liked them with cream cheese frosting. This recipe is definately a keeper.  These would be great served with a nice cup of coffee or other warm beverage. Thank you!!!!

I can not say enough about this recipe! Wonderful!! Followed exactly as written - with the exception of the crystallized ginger, which I left out and used 1 1/4 tsp ground ginger as suggested by others. Topped with Allspice Cream Cheese frosting! WOW!!! AMAZING!!!

I made these cupcakes recently & they were very good!  I too did not have the crystallized ginger.  I doubled up on the ground ginger instead.  I will definitely make these again!

Great flavor and super easy. The first time I made them,  I made exactly as stated even though I wasn't sure about using the butter.  I only made twelve, for a Girls Night Out. The second time I made them, I used the rest of the pudding mix to make a 8 x 8 cake and tried to make it more healthy by using half applesauce and half vegetable oil, egg substitute for the whole eggs and I added some ground flax.  The 8x8 cake came out really moist and with great flavor but a little on the heavy side. It wouldn't make a desirable cupcake but does work for a little snack cake. The pudding in the recipe really brings out the pumpkin flavor. My crystalized ginger kind of disappeared. Not sure if it is supposed to do that or not.

These cupcakes are soooo good and moist!  I made these for a Church outing and everyone raved on how good they were.  One lady told me that I must have had her in mind when I made them (I smiled)  I also topped mine with cream cheese frosting and glazed walnuts.  My Daughter told me "yum-o"  Thanks for sharing!

Because of the Pumpkin shortage (how is that still going on?) I used sweet potato filling. They took 35 minutes to bake, but I think that's because of the substitution I made. I'm going to have to learn how to cooke a pumpkin instead of just carve them I guess. Still, they turned our amazing and tasty.

These are AMAZING!  I omit the crystalized ginger and add a whole bag of Nestle Tollhouse MINI chocolate chips (the larger ones tend to sink to the bottom) at the end of mixing.  They are an absolute favorite at every get-together I bring them, too.  If you want to be extra decadent, top them with the Cream Cheese Frosting II posted on this site.  Yummmmm.

Great. Moist and very flavorful. The ginger gave it that extra something that brought them up another level. The best pumpkin cupcakes that I've ever made, and I bake a lot.

Absolutely delicious. Only change I made was 2T extra flour for high altitude.  So tasty they don't need frosting though I have served both ways and they were a hit.  I used a cream cheese frosting.

These were a big hit! Mine took a little longer to fully cook, aprox 24min per batch of 20. I topped them with a cream cheese frosting and some orange sprinkles.   The frosting I used this time had almond and vanilla extract, next time I will just stick with vanilla.  The almond didn't do anything for the pumpkin ginger flavor.

These cupcakes are delicious with or without frosting...I substitued vanilla pudding for the butterscotch and left out the crystallized ginger since I couldn't find either in the supermarket...I used the allspice cream cheese frosting on this site to go with these....I had some batter left over after making 24 cupcakes so I baked the leftover in an 8x8 and used this to make cakeballs with....They were great also.....This recipe is a keeper....

These were the BEST cupcakes I've ever eaten.  I made them for my birthday.  WOW, happy birthday to ME!  I found crystallized ginger in the spice aisle at my local grocery store.  It was a little expensive, but worth it,  makes the texture perfect!  I would give this 1000 stars if I could!

Yummy!   Okay, so I couldn't find crystalized ginger. Instead I used 1 1/4 tsp of ginger as others had.    Other than that I followed the recipe, except for one mess up....I had already started to pour the batter into the muffin pan when I realized I had completely missed the step with the pumpkin puree and vanilla! Oops! So I had to go back and add those.  Very tasty!  Topped with cream cheese frosting and a couple candy corn.

These were delicious. My boyfriend and i made these together using the exact recipe minus the crystalized sugar, substituted vanilla pudding for the butterscotch, he kinda complained when I told him we would me baking from scratch because he didnt believe the work was going to be worth it. But, boy did he shut his mouth when he tried them. His description was that they tasted like pumkpin flavored clouds. :) These were delicious.

These were awesome!  Didn't use the crystallized ginger, but doubled the ground ginger.  Made them for my mother-in-law's birthday because my son was set on making her cupcakes.  Even my husband, who doesn't like cake, had three!  Different enough for adults to think they are great, and the kids loved them too.

I LOVED these cupcakes!!!! I am a HUGE fan of pumpkin and these cupcakes came out perfectly! It was the first time I baked any sort of cake from scratch and the recipe was easy to follow and left me with moist, flavorful cupcakes. I did make some minor changes, I omitted the ginger since I'm not a huge fan of it and replaced the other spice with 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. Even with my changes these cupcakes were delicious. I will definitely make them again!

These are amazing!  I don't usually like pumpkin spice flavored desserts very much, but these were super delicious!  I did skip the crystalized ginger b/c I didn't have it, and the cloves b/c I don't like them, but otherwise I made them per the recipe and they were a huge hit.  My boyfriend ate 3 before I could finish frosting the rest!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These were delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, only I used candied ginger instead of crystallized ginger (the ginger pieces in the cakes were my favorite part!).  I topped it with Chai Tea Buttercream frosting (basically added some instant Chia Tea Latte mix from Trader Joes into the “Special Buttercream Frosting” recipe from this site). One of my friends said they were about the best cupcakes he’s ever had.

Just made these for snack after my daughters soccer game tonigh.  Of course, I had to taste one.  They are so moist and have tons of flavor.  I did leave out the crystallized ginger (not a big fan).I will make these again. It's going into my family recipe box.

I made these to take to the office.  I used King Arthur Flour mini ginger chips for the crystallized ginger.  Frosted them with caramel frosting.  Hubby, who doesn't like sweets, loved them.  My colleagues thought they were the best they'd ever tasted.  This is a keeper.

These are fantastic!  I ended up using butternut squash (baked and pureed) instead of pumpkin because I had a ton of it on hand that I needed to use.  They still came out very tasty!  I made some Super Mario Bros fondant toppers to go on it for a friends birthday.  Definitely will make again!

This one is a "must dp". I made it in a decorative cake tube pan and then iced it with a cream cheese frosting. I found crystallized ginger with the spices at the supercenter; however, it was quite expensive, so I bought Sugared Ginger at the oriiental market. This worked well, but remember to chop as finely as you can. Delicious!

This was a delicious recipe!  I agree with some other reviewers that they are more like muffins that cupcakes.  I made some with Cream Cheese Frosting II and left some plain.  Both were good but these can definately stand on their own.  I made the recipe exactly as stated but agree that if you don't have the crystalized ginger they will still come out great.  Everyone enjoyed them and this will be a keeper in my recipe box!

Great recipe! I used pumpkin pie spice instead of allspice and cloves and reduced the ginger so they weren't as strong. Picky eaters have come back for more so I will definitely make them again.

These tasted good, but something happened when I tried making these. The tops collapsed and it was like they couldn't bake long enough for them to be done. The centers were still gooey after 30-35 minutes...this recipe says 20 minutes, but the need to bake longer than that. Did anyone else have this problem? If not is there something that you did differently?

This recipe is excellent! I had to make a couple of adjustments and was still delicious. My market didn't have canned pumpkin so I substituted canned squash and it worked fine. I entered these cupcakes in a competition today and they won 1st place! They taste more like a gingerbread and were very moist.

These were fabulous! I admit, I just bought cream cheese frosting from the store and stirred in some cinnamon and nutmeg.  Everyone loved them!

The only problem with this recipe is that I couldn't quit eating the batter before I even cooked them!  Easy and amazing!  I used cream cheese 2 frosting recipe for the top.  Everyone always thinks I'm the most amazing cook and all I do is get easy recipes like this one that taste spectacular!!  (An obvious note:  fill cupcakes half full.  I did that but at the beginning I was afraid they weren't going to rise, but they do.)  Perfect!

I followed this recipe closely (not perfectly--I also got butter-sugar flecks when I added the pumpkin puree shortly AFTER the last egg, but that didn't hurt ultimately). I am suprised no one mentioned that this recipe makes quite a bit more than 24 cupcakes, more like 29 or 30. Maybe no one cared, the cakes taste so great!

AWESOME!!!  Everyone who tried them thought they were gourmet!!  I followed the recipe exactly and frosted them with the allspice cream cheese frosting from this site (however, read the reviews of the frosting first to fix some of the measurements).  If you can, try not to skip the crystallized ginger.  It is fairly expensive ($7.99 a bottle -- which really only makes about 1 1/2 batches) but 100% worth it.  I found it in a jar in the spice isle.  I cut some of the bigger pieces to make it go farther . . .  I ended up making one full batch (24 normal sized muffins) and a half batch (32 mini muffins).

This recipe will not let you down! Don't even debate making these -just do it. It is perfect as is. If you don't have the crystallized ginger, it still comes out beautifully. As listed, the recipe makes exactly 24 cupcakes, and my household devoured all of them in less than two days.

Great recipe - I added 4 tbsp of flaxseed and left out the cloves. The cupcakes turned out wonderfully soft and sweet. Fantastic!

The BEST cupcakes I've ever made!  The perfect blend of spices and pumpkin. Don't wait for  the Fall  time to make these. Perfectly moist too ! I used lightly sweetened whipped cream for the frosting as the cupcakes are a bit on the  sweet side  and the cream balances out the flavor..I will make this agin and again !!!!!!!!

They turned out just as good as the reviews state. Only thing is...I couldn't pour my batter. It was thick, and I did cream the butter and sugars until light colored. Guess it doesn't matter. They're awesome! Thought I would frost them, but there is no need to so why add extra calories??

This is a awesome cupcake recipe! I could not get crystallized ginger where I live so I did without. I have made this for a bunch of people and it has done very well. It's great duringthe fall/winter when you want pumpkin but also want a cake dessert!

These are so delicious!  I thought I'd messed them up by adding double the cloves and I was concerned with how runny the batter was with the four eggs, but after adding the flour it was fine.  I also made them with 1/2 c Earth's Best Soy Butter and 1/2 c of unsweetened applesauce (for my son with a dairy allergy) and they still taste so good!  I did have to increase my bake time to 25 minutes.  I made Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting to go on top with some crystallized ginger, but tried an unfrosted one and it was so good!  I'll make these all the time; thank you so much!

I've made these during the fall & Thanksgiving the past 2 years & they're always a HUGE hit! I've yet to make it with crystallized ginger, maybe this year. I half both sugars since the pudding mix is already sweet & they end up with just the right amount of sweetness. These are light, moist, not too sweet, and are gone before I can frost them!

Updated review– first one was made exactly as the recipe states. This time I wanted to make pumpkin ginger muffins (unfrosted) instead of cupcakes, so I changed a few things. First, I added half the amount of white sugar in the mixture, since muffins are less sweet than cupcakes. Secondly, I mixed the butter/sugar mixture much less than with cupcakes, and left the overall mixture a bit lumpier. I filled the tins more than I would have for cupcakes so they would overfill lazily like muffins do. 

For some reason this time the crystallized ginger is a little chunkier than I would like, but I think that's because I improvised with chewier candied ginger since it was cheaper. That's more my fault than anything else, but luckily the bite of the ginger was cooked out and is not offensive.

Thanks for the recipe!

Great Recipe! Like others I was unable to find the crystallized ginger so I substituted it with mini chocolate chips and added a whole tsp of ground ginger. I used the pumpkin spice instant pudding mix so cut back on the other spices a little bit more.  

Adored that the batter itself was almost mousse like and that after baking the cupcakes kept the light and fluffy texture.  

I did 2 mini cupcake pans at 350' for 10min and actually had enough left over batter to make 12 regular cupcakes. 350' 15-17min

Frosted with Cocoa Cinnamon Cream Cheese Frosting (1 8oz pkg cream cheese, 1stick 1/2c butter both at room temperature whip together and then gradually add 2cup confectioners powdered sugar, added 1-1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/3cup cocoa powder and whip whip whip till light and makes peaks) loaded up a freezer ziplock bag, snipped off the corner and pipped it on to the cupcakes. 

Of course I had to go all out, so grabed my frozen dark chocolate lindt bar and shaved a blizzard over the frosted cupcakes and went over the top by grating some gingersnap cookie crumbs to dust. 

Check out the picture, these little bites of yummyness don't stand a chance at our office thanksgiving potluck.

Best cupcakes I've ever had.  My family BEGS for me to make them. The whole cup of butter kinda grossed me out thinking of all the fat it added. So the second time I made them I tried 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce and 1/2 cup of butter and they still came out yummy.

I creamed the butter and sugar well until it was really fluffy. The batter consistency was both thick and wet. They baked up perfectly forming a nice brown color and beautiful round top. I baked them for 20 minutes and ended up with 27 cupcakes. These were moist, tender, flavorful and perfectly spiced! The cake is light and fluffy. The butterscotch pudding really brings out the pumpkin flavor and moistness of the cake. I noticed the flavor of the pumpkin in my initial bite followed by the zing of the ginger. The crystalized ginger is just the perfect addition to these pumpkin cupcakes adding a sugary flavor with a gingery zing. Crystalized ginger is the same as candied ginger, sugared ginger, or ginger chips. Hubs said that the pumpkin taste counters the zing of the crystalized ginger balancing each other out. I topped these with, “Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting, “ also from this website. I minced some more crystalized ginger and sprinkled it over the cream cheese frosting. The cream cheese frosting put these cupcakes right over the top! The sweetness of the frosting complemented the cupcake spices. I was pleased with the way this turned out and I wouldn’t change a thing in this recipe.

This cupcake has a good pumpkin taste, but the butterscotch pudding adds a sweetness that is unnecessary. I felt the consistency was a bit too moist, and I had to bake the cupcakes about 4-5 minutes longer than instructed. The candied ginger chunks are a nice texture add to the finished cupcake. I will try this cupcake base again without the butterscotch next time.

These are very tasty, delicious with a cream cheese frosting (I got lazy and bought the premade stuff)...and the little bits of crystalized ginger are ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL to bite into..extremely tasty...my husband and toddler give it 5 stars as well.

This was delicious. I was bored at home yesterday so I decided to cook something for me and my boyfriend and his family. 
THEY LOVED THEM!I'm not a big fan of pumpkin but they really like it and at first I was reluctant to try them, but after seeing how they ate them I decided to give them a try and I really liked them.

I am known to family and friends as the woman who makes great cakes/cupcakes, and this recipe completely solidified my reputation! 

I followed the recipe to a T with the exception of the crystalized ginger (couldn't find any). These were the most fluffy, moist, flavorful cupcakes to ever come out of my oven. 

If you want to frost them, I'd say go with a good cream cheese frosting - nothing too sweet or sugary and just frost these lightly. They don't need anything to distract from how amazing they are on their own.

If you're looking for a treat to serve in the fall, or any season really. Make these and knock everyone's socks off!

These are incredible cupcakes! I have made them using fresh pumpkin that I boiled, drained well and then whipped with a hand mixer. The key ingredient that makes these extra good is the candied ginger. So yummy!!!

Made this recipe this weekend. It was my first cupcake attempt and it turned out amazing. I candied my own ginger in spiced rum (YUM!) and I also topped it with a bourbon cream cheese frosting with orange rind! OMG they were a hit at home and at work. They were light and delish w/o frosting as well. I will make them again and again!

Everyone raved about this recipe. I turned it into a cake to save time. I didn't have crystallized ginger so I just sprinkled sugar on grated ginger. I also didn't have butterscotch pudding so I used vanilla. It was still amazing! Most of the guests said it didn't even need icing.

Wow these cupcakes are fabulous. I could not find the crystalized ginger, so I increased the ground ginger from 1/2 tsp. to 1 tsp. other than that I followed the recipe to a T. I have made these 3 times now over the Xmas holiday's, everybody loves them. I have made regularcupcakes as well as the mini version. After icing them I sprinkle them with red & green crystalized sugar, they are just so cute. Thank-you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

These cupcakes were totaly awesome!  I halved the butter and sub'd applesauce for the balance.  I don't think it compromised this cake at all!  Wonderful texture, fantastic flavor.  As a matter of fact, right now I've got a banana version baking in the oven . . . .  hope it works just as well.  Simply switched banana, well ripened (but not black) and mashed, for pumpkin -- using weight as common denominator to sub.

Yummy!!! These were so good. I am the worst cupcake maker ever, I love cupcakes but can't make them without them being too dry. These cupcakes have redeemed me. lol. They came out so soft and moist. I did not add the crystallized ginger though, just didn't seem like my thing. I made a "browned" butter cream cheese frosting. They were eaten up very quickly. I will make these again and again! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

The first batch is in the oven right now. I'm not very optimistic, because I've never seen such THICK batter.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe, so I don't know why the batter is so thick.  "Pour" into muffin cups?  The consistency is like mashed potatoes.

Wish I could rate these higher!!  Mine did turn out like muffins, but I'm known for my muffins anyway.  Hubby requested adding nuts to the next batch.  I did not top with anything.  I might try a very light whipped topping sprinkled with cinnamon.

I had a dessert challenge with friends today. I tried 3 different desserts and wasn't satisfied with any of them.  I looked on line and saw this and tried it last minute.  I came 2nd!  I thought the spices in the muffin was a little too strong and needed the cream cheese frosting for balance.  When everyone did their taste test (there were 13 different desserts) many said "that's really nice" right after trying it.  So, how did I lose?  I lost to a classic ginger bread which is a staple in my country.  So, thanks for this recipe and I will definitely make again.

I made these exactly as is, and they were a big hit. I also made a batch that I added chocolate chips to, and I think that was even better. The baking time was perfect. Got lots of rave reviews at the baby shower I took them to, and my husband loved them as well. They're good as is, and even better topped with a great cream cheese icing. We'll definitely make these again.

This is a fantastic cupcake! Everyone loves them! The pumpkin keeps them moist for several days longer than other cupcakes. I do not like to use pre-packaged food items, so I left out the pudding mix. Still super delicious!

These are fabulous! I'm not sure what it is - perhaps the pudding mix - that makes the texture just right. They are moist and delicious!  Everyone LOVED them!

I made them for my daughter's 1st birthday with all organic ingredients, plus dairy-free (and soy-free) for her. I replaced the butter with coconut oil (refined as to not affect flavor). 

I used Dr. Oetker's butterscotch pudding mix. It's a cooked pudding mix but I had no problems with it (though I don't know what the instant varieties do).

In one batch I used the crystalized ginger, but didn't have cloves so used some pumpkin pie seasoning. They didn't have as much spice as I was expecting, except for the bites of ginger. I made the second batch without the crystallized ginger but increased the powdered ginger to 1-1/4 tsp as others recommended. I also had purchased ground cloves by then. That made a nice difference in the spice level.  

I was really impressed that each batch made at 24 perfectly sized cupcakes.  The second batch (room temp coco oil, no crystallized ginger) actually made more.

I used Dr. Oetker's vanilla icing mix with organic shortening, powdered cinnamon, and meringue (to stiffen). SO GOOD together!!

These are awesome, they were a hit.  I don't think I creamed the butter and sugar enough, so they were a little muffin-like.  That seems to be an important step for cupcake consistancy.  They were a little more dense and not so fluffy- my fault, but they were still sooo good!  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, including the crystallized ginger- which I was able to find at Wal-Mart in the spice section.  I used a recipe for Red Velvet frosting from a different site (my go to frosting), and added just a tiny bit of cinnamon extract. I also used another reviewers idea to use glazed walnuts as a garnish (I just melted butter and brown sugar and stirred in walnut halves then cooled on wax paper).  I will be making these again I'm sure.

I love making these, the caramelized ginger makes these!  I've even made them with squash and sweet potatoes instead of the pumpkin and they are great every time!

WOW!  These are so good and moist, you don't even need frosting.  I made these today, and will be making another batch to take in to Hubby's office next week. I did mini cupcakes, and it made a LOT! Something like 6 dozen, I believe.  They are very moist, the flavors blend perfectly, and it tastes so good!  I will make this often - we all love pumpkin at our house.  I did not have any crystallized ginger and could not find it at the store, so I just doubled the amount of dry ginger. I'll be making full size ones for Hubby's office, and will probably put a light cream cheese frosting glaze on them, although they really don't need it.  These would also taste great with walnuts in them. Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

I made these last fall for a 4th grade classroom party. This was my first attempt at any type of cake from scratch and we were not disappointed! Followed the directions to a T and they were perfect. We used a silicone muffin pan in the shape of little pumpkins with eyes and a nose. We used orange frosting and filled the eyes and nose to help minimize the amount of sweets we were adding to all the Halloween candy. These were a BIG hit among adults and kids alike!

Wonderful Cupcakes!  I didn't change a thing and they were lovely.  My 6 year old even said the cake was better than the frosting.  I used cream cheese frosting.  She NEVER says that.  She usually licks all the frosting off and leaves most of the cake.  Thanks for the recipe.

These cupcakes are fabulous! I have been making all sorts of cupcakes lately (my new obsession) and these are one of my favorites. I used the cream cheese frosting from this site as well, and it just enhances the flavor. I didn't have any ground ginger, so I guess my cupcakes were more of just pumpkin. I think next time I make then I will add more cinnamon just to make it a bit more flavorful. I will most definitely make these again, for sure at Thanksgiving! :)

Very delicious! A hit at work! I followed the recipe completely except for the ginger. I replaced the ground and crystallized ginger with about 2 tsp of chopped ginger (in the jar). Next time, I'll use a full tbsp of chopped ginger. I made maple cream cheese frosting - very rich but that way you need very little. The cupcake batter will be thicker than most recipes, but don't worry, they'll turn out just fine!

THESE ARE A HIT - even with ½ the sugar - no white sugar, and applesauce cutting the butter in half (made for a goofy looking mix -as applesauce does not ‘whip’  like butter at all.) I did not have crystallized ginger but had dried solid ginger from spacesage.com, ground up – put it in a blender getting it to powder- it was SO STRONG – so good – I think this ginger made the cupcakes. I also ground cinnamon from sticks and the cloves. I did not have allspice on hand. The spice was NICE. I used Rick’s Special Butter cream Frosting on half for a birthday party – these don’t need frosting – look forward to the next time. I did get some candied ginger from King Arthur Flour Company – I’ll put ginger in a frosting and cut the cupcake sugar in this more. Cupcakes were very sweet even with ½ called for sugar. Follow up: Reading reviews cutting sugar with dry ginger ground up I think kept mine from being gummy or too sweet. Butterscotch pudding, especially for butterscotch affectionados adds added flavor dimension. Fresh ginger would add intensity grinding dry ginger adds, however fresh ‘wet’ ginger might add to gumminess. I learned about the ‘Ginger People’ here and how to purchase candied ginger for lower price. I use very tasty candied ginger in garnishing & frosting. This makes superior cake balls.

These may be a little pricey to make but don't take any shortcuts. I bought a bottle of the crystallized ginger and have shared it with others in my office along with the recipe. I have added these to my holiday tradition recipe collection.

I was nervious about using the crystalized ginger because I never worked with it before. I am so glade I did! It tasted delicious! I will make this again, but this time for my family for Christmas! It took much longer then 20 mins however. Anyone else have that problem? I don't know, maybe it was my oven.

These were delicious! Lots of pumpkin flavor and very moist. The little pieces of candied ginger made very tasty little surprises when biting into the cake. Perfect paired with a cream cheese icing. Still amazing after being stored in the fridge for a week.

I made the recipe exactly as written. It was out of this world! My son says it rivals the vanilla bean gourmet cupcakes in town. So light and so fluffy. I recommend not putting a sugar sweet frosting on this cupcake. It would do it an injustice. I used Whipped Cream Frosting (that includes sweetened cream cheese as an ingredient) by Tom Parker http://allrecipes.com/recipe/whipped-cream-frosting-2/Detail.aspx. I added vanilla extract to the heaving whipping cream and some pumpkin spice. This light and creamy Whipped Cream frosting complimented (not competed with) this delectable cupcake. Bravo, OVIEDOGIRL!

Made these for Thanksgiving.  They were a huge hit with all of my in-laws!!  They are so moist and easy to make.
I didn't frost them just sprinkled powdered sugar on them.  They taste a lot like Starbucks pumpkin bread but waaaayyyy more moist and better!!  Making them again for my X-mas treat tins:)

So very, yummy :).  I made two accidental substitutions and one purposeful substitution. 
HAPPY ACCIDENTS:
1. Saw that butterscotch pudding (mix) was needed. This item was not at my local grocer; I bought vanilla pudding mix and made it with buttermilk prior to reading the recipe through (the recipe calls for dry mix)
2. Mixed up cloves and all spice in my measurements. Cupcakes are superb, despite the mix up.
3. Used 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup the "butterscotch" pudding referenced above.

ON PURPOSE SUBSTITUTION:
1. Used 15 oz of real pumpkin, previously baked and pureed. 

With Gratitude, Oviedogirl. This is a wonderful recipe.

These were delicious, but they tasted more like muffins than cupcakes.  I will add more crystallized ginger next time.  Put Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site on them, and it tasted great.  The people I made these for raved about them, so I think I was the only one who cared that they weren't more traditional cupcakes.

These cupcakes are so good!  I had doubts because the batter was a lot thicker than other cake batters, but they turned out so moist.  These cupcakes are so moist and delicious!  They're good with or without the frosting.

A huge hit with the kids! Followed the recipe except for crystallized ginger, used a tsp of ground ginger instead. I ended up with two dozen cupcakes, and another 18 mini cupcakes...could've filled the liners more. I definitely recommend this recipe! Super moist and not overly pumpkin-y!

Excellent recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was easy to make and turned out beautifully.  I used organic crystallized ginger and topped with simple, cream cheese frosting.  It made 2 dozen cupcakes which is too much for my husband and I.  We gave the rest to our neighbors - they were delighted.

These were super good!!! I followed the recipe exactly except I used cold eggs and I forgot to pick up crystalized ginger so I took the advice of another reviewer and increased the ground ginger by 1/4 tsp. Everyone loved them.....I liked them better with out frosting too.

This gets a solid four stars. I didn't really have a problem finding the crystallized ginger. It was in the ethnic section at Publix. I couldn't find it ground though, so I had to use the food processor. It actually broke the blade off of a Kitchenaid food processor, so I had to substitute with ground ginger. The cook time had to be adjusted. I left one batch in for the full time, and they got a little "overdone". I used a cinnamon butter cream frosting. Everyone said they tasted great without the frosting, but they were more like a muffin. They were pretty good, and they looked super cute after I decorated them, but they didn't really pack the WOW factor I was going after.

Omg, what can I say about these cupcakes besides that THEY ARE SCRUMPTIOUS! I followed the recipe to the T, and they came out moist and delicious. I made them for a party for some of my friends who were visiting, and everyone loved them. It's definitely a recipe worth making again and again.

Made these exactly as the recipe says.  I also added the cream cheese frosting that so many people suggested.  They turned out great, everyone loved them!  They are very moist and sooo yummy.  Will be making them again for thanksgiving.  Even my stepson who is such a picky eater loved them.  He asked me to make them for his birthday!  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Absolutely adore these cupcakes! Don't let the thick and heavy batter fool you, they turn out super moist and light as a cloud. The spices are perfect for just enough zip. I followed the recipe to the T except for the crystallized ginger. Didn't have any on hand so I increased the ginger to 1 1/2 tsp. instead. I'm not a fan of cream cheese frostings so I used a vanilla frosting instead and they were great with and fabulous without anything at all too. Next time I'm going to make them in an oversized tin because one regular sized one is not enough. Usually cupcakes are sweet and sugary, but this has just enough sugar to make it good but not too much that you can't have 2-3 at a time. Lastly, mine also took more than 20 minutes to bake, like previous reviewers said. It took more like 25-26 minutes. I wonder if baking them in a convection oven would bake them faster.
Perfection! Thank you so much for posting the recipe, my entire family loved them and I plan on making them for my baby shower soon too!

Simply delicious, moist and flavorful! Per review mentions, increased ground ginger to 1 1/4 tsp in substitution of crystallized ginger and used french vanilla instead of butterscotch pudding. Also used nutmeg in absence of allspice.
Topped with cream cheese frosting: 8 oz pkg cream cheese, 1/4 c butter, 2 c powdered sugar, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon. YUM!

Great cupcakes. I only had 1 1 oz pack of the butterscotch pudding, and it didn't seem to matter. I used 1/2 cup butter + 1/2 cup applesauce as others mentioned, and only 3 eggs.  I do wish it had a little more pumpkin flavor though. Paired it with the cream cheese frosting II recipe, and it was great.

Not exactly what I was expecting, but AWESOME nonetheless. (I did substitute applesauce for half the butter.)  It was denser and wetter than I expected, but the flavor and the texture was amazing.  Topped with a dollop of cool whip, this was like pumpkin pie in cupcake form.  DELISH.

Fantastic!  The only changes I made were that I couldn't find butterscotch pudding mix in the stores I went to, so I used vanilla and added 1/4 C of butterscotch chips and I used cake flour instead of AP.

I made these this week-end for a cider pressing party.They were great. I did substitute 1/2 cup butter for 1/2 cup applesauce & there was no problem.  I added a bit of the crystalized ginger to the cream cheese frosting. Really yummy!
Jello has a seasonal Pumpkin Spice instant pudding in the market now, I bought 4, next time I may substitute the buttersctoch pudding for the pumpkin.

So amazing.  Pretty addictive.  I only used ground ginger like other reviewers and I don't know how these could be any better.  Topped with cream cheese frosting with cinnamon in it.  Killer combo.

These are terrific cupcakes!  I have made them twice in two weeks for different events.  I have emailed the recipe to several people.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe when making the batter.  The first time I made them, I got 30 cupcakes and then the 2nd time I made them, I got 23 regular size cupcakes and 24 mini cupcakes.  I fill the liners about 2/3 full.  Awesome recipe!!

Outstanding! Everyone loved them. I didn't have the eggs at room temperature and the cupcakes turned out wonderfully but I will try to get them to room temperature next time to see if it makes a difference. I paired these with a Cinnamon Cream Cheese Icing.

These were insanely off the chart delicious. I didn't have any crystalized ginger to add. I will find it and make these again!  Topped with cream cheese frosting II from this site and they were gobbled up by my coworkers in no time at all.  Thank you for this memorable recipe!!

Love these.  Even great as a breakfast muffin.  I did not frost these but would use a maple butter cream if I did.

What a great seasonal recipe! I was low on crystalized ginger, so I used ground ginger (about 1-1/4 teaspoon). I made cinnamon cream cheese frosting, adding a small dollop to each cooled cupcake. I finished them off with a small batch of caramel rum glaze drizzled on each one. Everyone loved the cupcake. It was so moist, rich and delicious. It will be put in the regular rotation.

This is as good as a pumpkin muffin gets! Even folks who don't like pumpkin desserts like it. Has a similar consistency to Amish Friendship Bread. Used vanilla pudding because I didn't have butterscotch and increased ginger to 1 14/ t and no crystallized ginger because I didn't have that either and it was delicious. You don't have to add the icing unless you want to have the extra sweet/calories! No one will refuse them without the icing. Throwing in a few chocolate chips or raisins can work too.  You should make this.

These were delicious! Made them about a month ago and people are still raving!  I only had cook & serve butterscotch pudding and it seemed to do the trick.  They stayed fresh long and did I mention they were delicious! Also I didn't have any crystallized ginger so just omitted this part!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made these for a Halloween party and added a whipped cream cheese frosting. Make as directed and they were very moist and the crystalized ginger added just the right depth of flavor. These would comlpliment any fall menu. Very easy to assemble and they made the house smell great too!

I made these for halloween and my coworkers gobbled them up! I was feeling really iffy on whether or not to use the candied ginger. My coworkers palates aren't exactly the most advanced lol and I thought it might be a little off putting. But I HIGHLY suggest using it. It just takes them over the top. I left some without icing and iced the others with cream cheese icing. Heavenly.

These are moist and delicious, I made them for a movie night with friends and everyone loved them! For icing I made a maple/cream cheese frosting, which complemented the tastes well. Be sure to chop the ginger pieces very finely, though!

I used fresh pupkin puree and slightly less candied ginger because I didn't want too strong of a ginger flavor.  They were excellent. I will be making them again very soon.  This recipe is a keeper.  Didn't get 24 cupcakes out of them and Im not sure why.  My family devoured them and are asking for more.

Frost these with cream cheese icing and they will be a hit.  The texture is moist and soft and they have nice flavor.  I made a batch for a bake sale and they got good reviews.

The flavor was great, but the muffins did not cook in 20 minutes.  Mine took about 30 minutes, and even then the centers were suspiciously uncooked in appearance and texture.

WOW!!!  These are incredible cupcakes.  They are exactly as the submitter describes - light, fluffy, and spiced just right.  The crystalized ginger is just a perfect addition to these pumpkin cupcakes.  I topped these with my own cream cheese frosting recipe and some fall sprinkles.  I took these to a small party and received many compliments.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Wow, these turned out wonderfully!  I did not want to have too many cup cakes around so I halved the recipe to make just 12 cakes but kept everything else the same (except I did have to bake for 25 or more minutes). These cakes were so light and fluffy and so flavorful and really did not need any frosting.  Will definately use the other half a can of pumkin and butterscotch pudding for another batch in couple of days!  I might try making this as a bundt cake.

These were amazing. I would say they are more like a muffin though then a cupcake and in being such we didn't use any frosting. It tasted like a spice cake. Will be making these again. The only thing that was odd I used spelenda instead of the sugar so it did cream well but it all came together with the egg and pumpkin.

Made these today and I will be lucky if I get the whipped cinnamon cream cheese frosting on them before they are gone. I followed the recipe but used a teaspoon and a half of pumpkin spice and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. The flavor was perfect and the cake was very moist. Couldnt be more perfect for Fall!

I could not find crystalized ginger so I used 1 tblsp ground ginger inplace of the crystalized ginger and the ground ginger measurement. I think these taste alot like Starbucks pumpkin muffins especially once you add cream cheese frosting. I took note from others that had reviewed this recipe and I used a whipped cream cheese icing. I will be making these over and over.

I prepared this recipe exactly as listed and it was FANTASTIC!!!  Super moist and extremely flavorful.  The finely chopped crystallized ginger really adds a tasty dimension.  The only change that I made was to bake the batter in a bundt pan.  It worked very well in my bundt pan.

Completely fabulous!  I followed the recipe exactly and they were moist and perfectly spiced.  I frosted them with the Allspice Cream Cheese Frosting recipe from this site.  Great combination.  I found the crystallized ginger in the Asian aisle at my grocery store.

I accidently put only 1 oz of butterscotch pudding mix.  But still tasted very yummy!   The pudding mix was sugar-free and used splenda blend to cut some sugar calories.  Used 1-1/4 tsp ground ginger total and didn't have any crystalized ginger.  I'm sure they could have been even better if I followed the recipe exactly!

These cupcakes were great! They are moist and a little more dense than the typical cupcake. I tried baking some in the foil cups on a cookie sheet. They definitely need to be baked in the cupcake/muffin pan or they end up a funny shape. I made a spiced cream cheese frosting for on the top. Just a little dollop is all it needed. Perfect! I'm already getting requests to make them again!

This cupcake is dense for a cupcake. It's like a muffin. If you like muffin-like cupcake, then this is a 5-star, but I prefer light and fluffy cupcakes. I think the dry to liquid ratio is too high, causing the batter to be very thick and the cupcake to be dense. The flavor is good as I like the ginger flavor but it does over power the pumpkin flavor. I didn't have crystallized ginger so I followed other's advice and added additional 1 1/4 tsp ginger. I also replaced half the butter with unsweetened applesauce. The cupcake is quite sweet, but I'd have to say my son loves it.

UPDATE: The second time I made it, I halved the sugar and added 4 oz of buttermilk, and it turned out REALLY moist and fluffy, and not as sweet.

I made these for our neighborhood's annual chili cook off and cupcake wars.  The biggest problem I had was chopping the crystalized ginger!  I had to stop midway through the ginger pile to clean and resharpen the knife!  While chopping I kept thinking that it couldn't possibly add that much to the cupcake to offset the labor involved.  I was wrong.  The ginger makes these cupcakes -- I love that little bit of heat when you hit one of those tiny pieces of sugary ginger.  I paired these cupcakes with a variation of maple cream cheese frosting that I added a few pinches of allspice to.  Delicious!  I lost the cupcake war to a chocolate number with a flashy frosting, but for a non-chocolate cupcake, these are tops!

These were phenomenal. Not overly sweet, but balanced wonderfully by a cream cheese frosting. Very seasonal.

5-star review, recipe followed to a 't'-- except I made the Crystallized Ginger from scratch. If you have an extra hour (+cooling time), it complements the recipe with stronger flavors coming from the ginger w/o overpowering. Recipe is easy to follow, the resulting cupcakes are aromatic, taste like Christmas, have texture that is firm and incredibly moist, they really are perfect and I've had consistent results from the batter time after time. I dropped off a few with each of my friends, everyone loved them and asked for more. Most grabbed a sample as I walked in, and ultimately (in between bites) all I heard was "mmm" and "ohmyGodyum!". Definitely saved and making these again, just wanted to pass on "Thank you so much!" to Ovie...

As many of you I went sans crystalized ginger, but these little cupcakes are still great. I can't get enough of this recipe! I want to try to add some shredded carrots...think that would rock. Thanks for the deliciousness!

OMG out of this world!! and I don't even like pumpkin. Topped them with cream cheese maple frosting (recipe found on this site) and they were a huge hit. I LOVE Allrecipes.com and I love this recipe.

These cupcakes were as good as described.  I couldn't get the crystallized ginger at the store I was in so I didn't use it.....no problem.  I didn't frost because so many people said they were great unfrosted and who needs the extra calories.  They were great.  Took them to a Halloween party.  Will make them for Thanksgiving.  Definitely *****.  They took way more than 20 minutes to bake though.....more like 30-35.

Wonderful!! These are amazing! Made these for a party, and everyone loved them. As others had said, I didn't have crystallized ginger, so I just used 1 1/4 tsp of ground ginger. A cream cheese icing enhances these already perfect cupcakes.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as described but made mini-muffins instead.  They are moist but light at the same time and absolutely delicious.  There are a couple of odd things about the way the recipe is written, though.  First of all, you probably won't see that butter mixture change color.  Just beat until completely incorporated.  Also, you won't be POURING the batter into baking cups but spooning it.   It's really thick.  Fill the mini cups just a little over 1/2 full.  I ended up with 80 mini cakes and baked them for about 15 minutes instead of 20 - check with a cake tester.

These are amazing!  I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup and used 1 1/2 TBL cinnamon and 1 TBL pumpkin pie spice.  Topped them with cream cheese frosting.  They are so moist and a great addition to the fall line up.  Thanks for sharing.

Got rave reviews from everybody at a birthday gathering! In an attempt to cut down on processed sugar, I cut both sugars down by 1/3, and added a little maple syrup instead. Replaced 1/2 the butter with applesauce, and cut down the eggs by one. I lightly frosted with a cream cheese frosting. YUMMY! Great for a special treat. One guest said she could eat one everyday!

These cupcakes are amazing!  Followed the recipe exactly and it made 24 perfect cupcakes.  The pumpkin and spices are a perfect combo.  Wouldn't change a thing.  I made the whipped cream cream cheese frosting to go with them.  So, so good together.  Thank you!!

I love this recipe and I've made it many times since. I made a variety of 300 cupcakes for a church event. This recipe was requested the most. I couldn't find the crystalized ginger so I omitted it and the cloves ( don't like the taste). I did replace it with pumpkin spice. I topped it with a cinnamon vanilla frosting. I cooked an extra 5 mins for a more firm cupcake. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.

I made mini cupcakes.  Set oven to 350 degrees for 15 mins and they were fabulous!   I used store bought cream cheese icing and it was  easy and yummy.  Very moist and really good pumpkin flavor.  Could not find crystallized ginger so I added an extra teaspoon of ground ginger and a little sugar and it worked.

I thought these were really good but the only problem is they are so sweet they dont need frosting and thats one reason i like making cupcakes is decorating them. So they became more like really sweet muffins but everyone loved them anyway. They stay very moist and are perfect for a fall treat. I will probably make them again for thanksgiving but with less sugar.

why are there not more stars for these??? I followed the direction exactly and wow. They are so moist and delicious. I found the ginger at Target which someone else had mentioned.I was nervous  about how much it would be and I paid less than $5 for the 3.2 oz bottle which was just enough to do the job. And to be honest, if people hadn't given such good reviews I probably would have passed on the crystallized ginger. I made them yesterday and went to target to get the last bottle of ginger today but it was gone lol. I can't wait to make these again!

These were so delicious and yummy! I just bought the betty crocker whipped cream cheese icing for ontop.  light and fluffy and the pumpkin is not too strong tasting. The crystalized ginger is also a very nice touch. I was debating not adding the crystalized ginger because it was taking a long time to chop it, but it was so worth it! I found the crystalized ginger at the local supermarket in the bulk section. You don't need that many pieces.
 Everyone at work loved them! They are easy to make.  
fool proof if you follow the instructions.

I didn't realize I was out of cloves, so I didn't use that, but I did add some pumpkin pie spice.  I also couldn't find crystallized ginger.  Instead of butter, I used 1/2 light margarine and 1/2 applesauce.  I used 3/4 C of egg substitute.  Topped with cream cheese frosting.  So, so good!  Very dense, but moist cupcake.

Great recipe. I couldn't find pumpkin in my local grocery store so I used yams instead. The cream cheese frosting II recipe compliments these cupcakes. I have made 2 batches in 1 week for different events and they are a HUGE HIT!

These were very sweet but not overbearing. I was a bit skeptical about this recipe going in but they turned out great. I don't have a stand mixer so it was tricky to get the right consistency but I don't think the cupcakes suffered. Also, I forgot to measure out the chopped ginger. I have a chopper that I threw a bunch of the ginger into figuring I'd measure it out later but I poured the whole thing in. Again didn't ruin the cupcakes. They were very well received at Christmas.

Everyone thoroughly enjoyed these!!!!  We're always looking for new pumpkin things to try this time of year, and these were a slam dunk!!!  A helpful tip:  crystallized ginger is found in the Bulk food area of the grocery store, usually the bins where the dried fruits/nuts/trail mix/candy is found....I had no idea, I sure there's a few of us out there that had the same problem

I'm not really fond of pumpkin at all, but these cupcakes are fantastic!
Couldn't find crystalized ginger at my grocery store,so, I left it out and my family loved them. Will be using these for our church's Octoberfest and am sure they will be a hit!

Delicious. I didn't use frosting,  only a sprinkle of powdered sugar as some other reviewers suggested.  The house smells heavenly during baking. These would go great with ginger cookie crumbles on top of a light cream cheese frosting. I will try that next time!

Fantastic! I halved the recipe and eliminated the pudding so that these wouldn't be too sweet. I did not expect these to be so light and delicate. The cupcakes don't really need frosting, but a cream cheese frosting--either homemade or store-bought--would work very well. Halved, this made 15 cupcakes.

Amazing. Seriously. I am a cake snob and these were incredible. Super moist, not too sweet, not too gingery... the butterscotch pudding is a genius addition. 

For the frosting, I used 1 stick of butter, 8 oz of cream cheese, 1t vanilla, maybe 1/2t cinnamon, about 3/4 bag of powdered sugar, about 1/4 pkg of butterscotch pudding mix and enough milk to give it the consistency I wanted. I sprinkled crystallized ginger on top of the frosted cakes. The man took a bunch to work and said they disappeared in a matter of minutes. 

I will DEFINITELY be making these again, and they'll be in the lineup every fall from here on out. Spectacular.

Everyone enjoyed this recipe. I gave 4 stars rather than 5 because the recipe calls for far too much sugar. A great recipe doesn't need it. I did make a few changes. Because of the instant pudding (1st ingredient being sugar)and using cream cheese frosting, I reduced the brown sugar to half a cup and totally eliminated the white sugar. I used coconut oil rather than butter and I added a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. Great taste for fall.

There is one one rating word for this recipe:  DELICIOUS!  I made a minor adjustment--1 used 1 stick of butter and 1/2 C of prune butter (can also use applesauce, or any fruit puree) and therefore omitted the white sugar (otherwise too sweet).  Everyone loved it!  I made a bundt cake instead of cupcakes and so baked it for 45 minutes.  Perfect!  Thank you for this recipe.

These cupcakes blew my mind!!! They were so good I ate six of them in one day! I gave some of them to my friends and they all loved them too. These cupcake were probably one of the best I've ever had.  As recommended by another reviewer, I used the cream cheese frosting 2 recipe to make the frosting, and the frosting went perfectly with the cupcakes.  I couldn't find crystallized ginger, so instead I used candied ginger snacks.  It was a wonderful replacement because there were bits of candy ginger in the cupcakes.

Fall fabulous cupcakes! I used vanilla pudding only because I didn't have butterscotch... will use it next time; I'll be making these again and again through Thanksgiving, I'm sure. Topped them with homemade cinammon buttercream frosting. They were a HUGE hit. Thanks!

Wow!  This was great.  I used pumpkin pie filling instead of pumpkin, so I cut the sugar in half.  I probably should have cut the butter down, because I felt so guilty feeding my family a cake made with two sticks of butter, frosted with another stick of butter mixed with cream cheese...but...they loved it, so why spoil it for them?  I am looking forward to making it again.  Oh, I also used vanilla pudding mix, instead of buttterscotch.  I did add the crystallized ginger to the cake mix, and I think it really helps add to the cake.

The batter will be THICK! But do not worry, they do come out very moist and tender. I made a cinnamon cream cheese frosting and grated some fresh ginger in the batter as well. Absolutely delicious! Really does taste like the fall

I look forward to autumn each year so I can make these season-appropriate cupcakes!  I topped these cupcakes with whipped cream cheese frosting which I added in some cinnamon and nutmeg.  Delicious with dark roast coffees!

This was delicious!! I added more of the spices than it called for bc I like my cake spicy. I was nervous making it into a cake instead of cupcakes, but it stayed moist and amazing. I also put pieces of the crystallized ginger at the bottom of the pan to ensure each piece had some ginger since it was kind of clumping together in the batter.  I received so many compliments on this cake! I'd definitely make it again.

Nice fall recipe!  I didn't have crystallized ginger or cloves, so I added a little nutmeg to even it out.  The cupcakes came out nice & moist even baking at a high altitude.  I topped with a cream cheese frosting & then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar for a touch of pretty.  They tasted even better the next day after the frosting had stiffended up a bit.

I work in the maintenance department with a large group of men, and brought these in for them. They absolutely loved them. Some of the guys came back for seconds and even thirds!

I also topped these with a cream cheese frosting. The tang of the cream cheese perfectly balanced out the sweetness of the cupcake. Like a few other bakers on here, I also had to bake mine for about 25 minutes. At 20, they were still a bit wet inside, but everyone's oven is different, so just do the toothpick test after 20 minutes. So moist, flavorful, and taste just like fall.

I cannot believe how moist and tasty these are!  You really don't need any kind of topping or frosting, they're like a mix between cake, cookies and cupcakes.  I metled the butter before adding it to the sugar because I didn't have a mixer on hand and there was no way I was sitting there for hours trying to make a mix by hand, and it still turned out perfectly fine (I don't know anything about the science behind baking, so I'm sure I changed up something along the way :)).  Definitely going to make these for Thanksgiving and Christmas!

I didnt know how I would like these b/c I am not a fan of pumpkin...but based on other's reviews went ahead and tried it. OH my goodness, they are delicious. I substituted 1/2 of the butter with applesause and used a little more ginger b/c I didn't have the crystalized ginged..I also left out the cloves. They were phenomenal and very moist. I used the cream cheese frosting II from this site and it was delecious. It was just really soft and made it difficult to pipe onto the cupcake. Great recipe!

These cupcakes are awesome! I was so pleased with the way they turned out that I posted a picture on my Facebook page and told all my friends about them. I followed the recipe completely and frosted them with a buttercream frosting. This recipe is a definite keeper!

A very moist and delicious cake.  I used sugar free pudding only because that was the only kind I could find.  The minced crystallized ginger was the best part!

This recipe was delicious!  I received rave reviews from people you don't particularly care for pumpkin.  I did leave out the crystallized ginger--I don't think it is needed because they have so much flavor already.  Very light and fluffy.  I frosted with Cream Cheese Frosting, but they really didn't need it!  Will definitely make again!

These were amazing!!! I followed the advice of a reviewer and added some more cinnamon instead of crystalized ginger.

Tasty, easy. I didn't have any crystallized ginger on me (though I bought some in the bulk area of winco for next time). I didn't use any frosting for this at all- the cupcakes were delicious by themselves, moist and sweet. I instead sprinkled powdered sugar on them to pretty them up and give them some flair. Thanks for sharing!

Super Yum!  Added Cinnamon to the frosting - amazing!  Only problem was over mixing - cupcakes sunk and were a little muffin-like in their texture.  Will definitely make again!

SO GOOD!!! I followed the recipe exactly, except I baked it for 25 minutes. They turned out perfect and were absolutely delicious. I certainly make them again for Thanksgiving and during the holidays. They also taste great with pecans mixed in or sprinkled on top. Thank you for a wonderful recipe! YOU HAVE TO MAKE THESE!!!

Delicious! I baked them as backup for a friend's wedding in case she didn't have enough cake. She said everyone at the wedding kept asking for cupcakes over her pumpkin spice wedding cake!

Ahhh Amazing!!! I ripped apart Save - On looking for crystallized ginger - and found it! I was so intrigued. I didnt have cloves - so I used nutmeg. I also used half margarine and half butter - as I find that margarine helps keep cupcakes moist. My friend works at Starbucks so I added some of their pumpkin spice latte mix into the cupcakes. Other then that followed the recipe exactly - It made 33 huge cupcakes and I just had one without icing and it is heaven- Thanks for the recipe!!! Im keeping this one!

My husband swears these are the best cupcakes ever!  I frosted with white chocolate ganache and topped with lightly salted toasted chopped pecans.  Recipe made 30 cupcakes (filled 2/3); baked for 25 minutes.

These sound yummy. Has anyone tried freezing them after completely baked and frosted. I have noticed more grocers now days selling gourmet cupcakes in the freezer case.

These are the best.  I made these for a party yesterday (and frosted them with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site).  I had people literally swarming me to tell me how good they were.  These are just so moist and delicious--the perfect fall treat.

These cupcakes are so flavorful,moist,light and fluffy they really don't need any frosting at all.All the perfect ingredients for a perfect muffin.I read that on the reviews before I made them and thought "yeah right" because I love cake and frosting but truly they are EXCELLENT as is =) I think even a lightly flavored cream cheese frosting takes away from the cupcake (muffin) I put some on my first cupcake and scraped it off (never done that before!!) These muffins are perfect for the fall.This recipe should be in everyones box!! I will say I dod not use crystallized ginger because I had no idea what it was and I used a 1/2 cup of splenda instead of a whole cup of sugar and had to bake them for 30 minutes.The batter is very thick and you get to fill the muffin cups to the top.I was a little tired so my eggs and butter were still cool and not yet room temp but no matter they came out Ahhh-mazing! very easy to make =)

Couldn't find instant pudding, used cook and serve instead and worked just fine (of course I don't know how they taste using instant). Based on other's reviews, I also used half butter/half apple sauce. I made my own cream cheese based frosting with a cooked flour/milk base (so I wouldn't have to use much sugar) as previous posts indicated the cupcakes were almost too sweet. My family is loving these. Wish the ginger were a bit more previlant. Maybe next time I would add more of both gingers.

These are as delicious as everyone says they are!  This recipe is definitely going into my cupcake repertoire - my family loved them.  I like to rate recipes exactly as they are written, but with this one I made two small changes.  I used vanilla instant pudding in place of the butterscotch (I am just not a big butterscotch fan, plus I had vanilla on hand), and I did not use the crystallized ginger.  I upped the ground ginger to 1-11/2 tsp. The cupcakes are moist and taste like fall. I topped them with a cinnamon buttercream and they are so yummy.  I love it when a recipe delivers the taste you expect it to!  :)  I got 30 cupcakes from my batch, and they were perfectly done at 20 minutes as stated.

I used the base minus the ginger(i didnt have it) and added about half a cup of strong coffee to thin the batter a bit. They are soft, fluffy, and moist and baking left a slight crisp caramelization to the top which my guests LOVED. One of my guests doesn't like cream cheese frosting, so I paired it with a simple vanilla buttercream and it was delicious. They also didnt crumble all over the place when we took the bottom part off to make a "cupcake sandwich" (easier to eat). Easy and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. This is my go-to pumpkin treat

I made these cupcakes as written with the Crystalized ginger and it was unbelievably delicious.  I fould the ginger in my supermarket in the bulk nuts and spice area that many places are now including.  I did find that some of the cupcakes were baked well and others were a bit dense.  I couldn't find instant butterscotch pudding so I used the cook & serve version.  This may have cause the inconsistency in the results.  I will definitely make again and use instand pudding to see if this helps.  I did find Pumpkin pie spice instant pudding that could be another variation (but maybe cut back on spices)   Nevertheless, the results were delicious.  I really feel the ginger makes a big difference, so do try to find it if you can.  I topped the cupcakes with a Swiss Meringue Buttercream recipe from this site, adding some cinnamon to the buttercream for kicks.   This frosting is less sweet than the powdered sugar American buttercream and holds its shape very well, even when it's hot out.

I'm not a fan of pumpkin anything. I wish I was because the aroma of all those spices mixed with pumpkin is amazing, but for some reason the taste is entirely different then the way it smells and it makes me gag lol. All to say I decided to try this recipe for a thanksgiving potluck for all those pumpkin lovers and it was a hit. I followed the recipe to a T and I topped them with a cream cheese frosting. I decided to try one myself and they were so delicious I decided to have another. This recipe will definitely be added to my cupcake recipe collection!!

I love these!!  And I make several times a year and keep some unfrosted in the freezer to pull out a few as needed.   A helpful cost saving tip for you:  Skip buying your crystallized ginger in the regular spices section.  Go to the Ethnic Food aisle to the Mexican Food section.  You'll find the same thing for about 1/4 of the price.

These are great! I bought the candy ginger but it was MIA when it came time to make them. I just added more ground ginger as other people did. I also didn't have the cupcake liners just spayed bakers joy and they came out marvelous! Will make again and again. Everyone loved them!!!

Best cupcakes I've ever made.  Made them 4 times in the past month.  Made them last night but ran out of butterscotch pudding. Substituted Pumpkin Spice pudding.  Can't believe they tasted even better.  Delicious!

Missed making this last Fall. Absolutely worth every extra step- bringing eggs and butter to room temperature before beating, finely dicing the crystallized ginger(very inexpensive at most Asian food stores), beating after adding each egg and then carefully folding flour and creamed butter & eggs. We LOVE the results. Thank you for sharing this, Lisa!

This one of the best tasting pumpkin muffins I've had.  I sub white whole wheat flour, double all spices, use I-can"t-believe-it's-butter sticks (probably need to use applesauce for half of this), & either cheesecake or vanilla-flavored pudding mix.  I usually just do swirl of cream cheese glaze.  Don't forget to add pinch of cinnamon or ginger in glaze.  They freeze great.  I can just pull one out whenever I want one which is often.  Love it!

I won a pumpkin bake off with this recipe.  I made a cream cheese frosting and mixed some pumpkin pie spice in it.  Topped each cupcake with some chopped up butterscotch chips.

I would like to try it.  I'm writing because the video says "vanilla pudding" and the recipe says "butterscotch pudding".  Please clarify, thanks. :)

Yummy! I didn't have the crystallized ginger so I just added a little extra ginger. These came out so moist and pumpkin-y. The perfect autumn cupcakes!

I did make this recipe yesterday and had somewhat a flop!  Suspect that was because I used my own pumpkin which is much moister than canned and I did not make an adjustment for that.

Wondering why baking SODA in this recipe?  Usually that is used with sour cream type liquids.

I made this as written, and they are delicious. I love the ginger bits inside. I also made a cream cheese frosting with a pinch of nutmeg, which rounds out the autumn spice flavors nicely. I am not much of a pumpkin-baked-goods fan, but these are delightful.

Really good cupcakes. I thought the crystalized ginger was going to melt or something but it doesnt so make sure you cut them up really small... or just dont add it at all :)
These go great with cream cheese icing.

Excellent! Followed directions exactly and came out perfect. None of my friends like pumpkin and were sure they wouldn't like these but assured me that they would try them to make me happy.  They are converts! All of them said how fluffy and moist and tasty they are. They even took some home. Doubled the recipe so I can take some to work.

Awesome cupcakes! These were extremely moist and tasty. I didn't have crystallized ginger on hand, so I just grated about a tbsp of real ginger into the wet ingredients. I also didn't have separate spices for the cloves, ginger and allspice, so I just replaced the same amounts with pumpkin pie spice and it tasted great! Next time I might ground 2 tbsp of ginger for extra kick, but not necessary for great tasting cupcakes.

These are possibly the best cupcakes I have ever tasted!!!!  I changed three things though: 1.) I didn't add any candied(crystalized) ginger; couldn't find any, and it turned out I definitely didn't need it! The cupcakes taste like a scrumptious pumpkin pie cake, I couldn't imagine ginger. 2.) I used 1/2 cup of unsalted butter and 1/2 cup of unsweetened apple sauce instead of 1 cup of butter, and it's extremely moist and savory, plus I have a clearer conscious. ;) 3.) I didn't use any ground cloves. I only had whole cloves, and ground cloves were too expensive. Instead I just used a dash or two of pumpkin spice. It came out perfect.        These cupcakes are so sweet and tasty and delicious, you don't even need frosting! I didn't want it to be too sweet, so I bought a can of cream cheese frosting and whipped it with some whipping cream and cream cheese to taste.

This is the third year that I have been making these fabulous cupcakes!  Why would anyone want to remove the ginger?!  That is what makes these so unique and amazing. I do not modify this recipe in any way, as it is perfect as-is. So good indeed, that I have been asked for this recipe from countless friends and family members.

All I can say is....amazing!  I read the reviews, halved the sugars, and replaced half the butter with applesauce and boy was I happy with the results. One reviewer said not to icing them, this is so true. These are wonderful all on their own.  I took these to work and they were gobbled up in no time. I was lucky to get one!

These are so moist and burst with flavor.  The recipe is easy to follow and always turns out fabulous.  They've been a hit everywhere I've taken them and are often requested.  Try them you won't be disapointed except for how quickly they disappear.

A coworker made this recipe a few years ago for a Halloween party. The office died, they were so good. Since, I've made it for tons of events, and people always rave. It's the top request I get when I ask what I can bring to other's events, and my grandmother even asks for them as her birthday presents. They are super moist, which is great, because I hate airy anything.

This is the best pumpkin recipe I've come across. I've been making it for a few years now. I bake it into mini loaf pans instead of cupcakes. The only substitute I do is use 1 1/4 tsp of ground ginger instead of the crystallized ginger.

I can only echo all of the wonderful comments.  These are FANTASTIC.  Only frosted half with cream cheese frosting.  The other half we ended up eating like muffins.  Delicious both ways.  I was wary of the amount of ginger called for - for me ended up being a full bottle of crystalized ginger in addition to the powdered ginger - but proportions were on the money.  
I also used part of a sugar pumpkin I had roasted instead of the canned puree.  Turned out fine.  Around 2 cups seemed to be about 15 oz.  
Make these right now!  You will not regret it!

Oh my goodness! These are the lightest, fluffiest and most moist muffins/cupcakes ever! The first time I followed the recipe exactly and just needed to leave them in the oven for an extra 3 minutes (23 total) for them to fully cook. I then slathered them in a simple cream cheese frosting with a tsp of cinnamon mixed in and a sprinkling of more candied ginger on top...divine!

 The only complaint I had was that the candied ginger sunk to the bottom (no big deal, really), so the next time I filled the muffin cups halfway with batter, put a teaspoon of cream cheese in the middle and a sprinkle of ginger bits on that. Then top them off with a bit more batter and WOW! Best muffins EVER! Just make sure to give them lots of time to cool if you do this or you'll end up with a burnt tongue. Worked just as well with fresh pumpkin puree I had made.

Absolutely phenomenal. They disappeared immediately. I used the cream cheese 2 icing recipe, but they didn't need the icing.

I really liked these. I didn't have the crystalized ginger but I did add extra ground ginger and I topped them with pumpkin pie spiced cream cheese icing. Very moist! I will be making this again!

I've been baking these cupcakes every Autumn for four years now and they still are my favorite recipe to bake.  The yield is slightly more than 24 cupcakes, despite what it says so do plan accordingly.  I find I need to bake double batches anyway because they fly off the table everywhere I serve them.  Thanks a ton for sharing these--sorry I forgot to rate sooner!

Very, very good. Topped them with cream cheese frosting. These garnered rave reviews. I didn't have time to candy any ginger root and  so I just used a little add'l ginger. I like my cupcakes to be uniform in size, so I used my Pampered Chef cookie dough scoops. I used 2 med and 1 sm scoop batter for each cupcake cavity.

These were delicious, even better the next day. Although crystallized ginger can be substituted, the crystallized ginger gives it that over top edge, in flavor. Even better the next day. Even my picky children loved these

Excellent.
Note to those using the metric system, the small box of pudding mix is equal to 3.4 oz. 
As suggested by another, I cut the butter to 1/2 cup, added 2Tbsp of Olive Oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce.
Flavourful, fluffy, dark and light.
No icing, we eat them without it.

the best cupcakes I've ever made. SO moist! I followed the recipe but I made 1 adjustment as a previous reviewer suggested - used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce. I used the Cream Cheese II frosting and added a touch of cinnamon. absolutely delicious. I will continue to make this recipe, guaranteed!

So yummy and rich! I followed the recipe exact, except I added chopped walnuts instead of crystalized ginger. The walnuts added a little crunch that everyone enjoyed. Absolutely one of my favorites.

Very delicious! They are super moist, and I think the amount of spices is perfect (not overpowering) Did not put in any crystallized ginger or candied ginger (in fear it would cause a sticky or gummy texture) Passed on adding frosting, and simply sprinkled on some powdered sugar. Also added mini chocolate chips to a few of them, and of course they were good with the chocolate as well. Thanks for sharing this great and simple recipe :)

I didn't have the candied ginger but went away and did it anyways. I halved the recipe and it made 12 cupcakes for me! Well they are more like Muffins, More dense then a Cupcake. They are very moist and heavy. Really a treat! Was a great recipe to make and not at all difficult. I topped mine with a Chai Tea Vanilla Buttercream Frosting! MmmmMmmm!

These are fantastic.  Made them exactly to the recipe except I didn't have candied ginger.  They were delicious and smell like pumpkin pie when they are baking.  There wasn't a single one left after our event.  Terrific

Love this recipe and so does everyone who has tried these!  The crystalized ginger is such a great addition.  I normally top with cinnamon cream cheese buttercream frosting.  The cupcakes also freeze well (without the cream cheese frosting) - I pulled some out of the freezer recently from almost a year ago, and the cake was still moist and delicious!

These cupcakes were excellent! I got rave reviews from my family and friends, and they couldn't believe they tasted good w/o all the "real" sugar. I used wheat flour instead of white all-purpose flour, 1/2 c butter + 1/2 c applesauce instead of all butter, Truvia sweetener instead of sugar, Splenda brown sugar blend instead of brown sugar, and 3 eggs instead of 4 eggs. Use crystallized ginger -- it really makes all the difference in the taste. I will be making these again! Oh, and use the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe!

Followed exactly.  They were very moist and the flavor was excellent.  I did as another reviewer did and made a frosting with 4oz cream cheese and 1/2 cup butter creamed together with 1tsp vanilla and 1tsp cinnamon added and 2 cups of sifted powdered sugar. Excellent!

I've tried this twice. Both times got rave reviews. Here's some of my observations. The first time, I made the recipe exactly as written. Delish! I easily found inexpensive crystal ginger in the Asian Aisle at my local health food store. I hand chopped the ginger & loved how when eaten you get tiny pieces of ginger "gumdrops" with each bite :-) The 2nd time I made these, my local store did NOT carry butterscotch pudding mix, it was late, I was in a hurry so I grabbed a vanilla. A friend gave me this tip: to expedite things along, just throw the candied ginger in my vitamix for about 15 seconds..that's what I did.So, the 2nd batch came out totally delish again, the vanilla pudding mix really did not make a difference. perhaps if I could taste one made with butterscotch at the same time as the one made with vanilla I would be able to discern something. However, by putting the ginger in the blender, I was disappointed. The cupcakes tasted awesome and the friends I made them for were none the wiser but from now on, my personal preference is to hand chop the ginger. I really missed having those little gummy pieces in several bites. Yum! I just used a cream cheese frosting from this site...thanks for the recipe! Delish!

I made this recipe into 2 9" layer cakes, and frosted it with cream cheese frosting.  Delicious.  I thought, though, that it would be a lighter textured cake; it was denser than I expected--like pumpkin bread.  Still very tasty; I'll make this again.

This was absolutely perfect.  I was a bit worried that the batter didn't look like the same consistency as boxed cake mix (the only other cakes I've ever made, I'm new to baking), but the cupcakes turned out so moist and tasty nobody could eat just one.  I did have to use dry ground ginger instead of crystallized, but it still tasted great.

OMG are these amazing! The moistness, flavor and consistency were amazing.  I, like others, just increased the powdered ginger in place of the crystalized ginger. Simply FANTASTIC cupcakes!

Good, especially liked the use of crystallized ginger. Made this for my friend at work who loves ginger stuff for his birthday. Very well received. I made a spice cream cheese frosting along with it. Will stay in my recipe box.

These were really good and easy to make -- and it made a bunch!  I followed the directions exactly and baked half of the batter in mini-muffin tins (48 total) + 1 regular sized tin (12).  I also made the whipped cream cream cheese frosting from this site and piped a dollop on each cupcake without the crystallized ginger since they were for my 10 year old son's classroom Halloween party.  I put the leftovers in the teacher's lounge and they were gone within minutes and everybody has been raving about them.  I will absolutely make these again -- love fresh, made from scratch foods!

Absolutely fabulous!! Someone else wrote that they knew that they would be leaving a 5-star review already during the baking process. I felt the same! I followed the recipe exactly as it is this time, except that I left out the ground cloves (as I did not have any). I also made the pumpkin purée and crystallized ginger myself. Next time, I will definitely add ground cloves, but will probably reduce sugar. They are by no means too sweet, but I prefer not to use too much sugar in general. But other than that, the muffins were perfect!! They don´t need any icing or topping, but for a party, it would of course add to the aesthetic value. And if adding an icing, then I would all the more reduce sugar.

This recipe is so easy to follow and they turn out amazing!!!  I have made these many of times during the Holiday season and everyone that tried them loves them.  At first they say ginger yuck!!!  But as soon as they try it the fell in love.  The only thing that I would recommend to do it to mix butter and sugars until it becomes light in color like the recipe says.

These were amazing. The pieces of crystalized ginger really made these cupcakes even better.  I loved this recipe as written and will make them again.

These were so good! I did find the crystallized ginger in the Asian section of my grocery store. I think it added a nice flavor and a nice garnish on top. I love these. I also made a cream cheese frosting for the top that just made these perfect. They are sweet, but the cream cheese frosting really helps to mellow out the sweetness and compliments the pumpkin perfectly. Will make these again!

I thought these cupcakes were PERFECT! The crystallized ginger put them over the top, so anyone who skips that ingredient is cheating themselves. I made them for a cupcake contest and took second place, second to a doctored-up box mix cupcake! Silly judges!

I've been making this recipe for three years now. My family absolutely LOVES it and it's a must-have for Thanksgiving and Christmas in our house. My husband also asks for them for his birthday and July. I usually don't use the crystallized ginger because it's been hard for me to find, but even without it these are amazing. I also add a few chocolate chips to some of the cupcakes for me and my daughter - delicious!

I just made them and they were wonderful.  I added a cream cheese frosting with 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  It tasted like a pumpkin roll that I make.  I changed the spices a little to suit my taste and added 1 C. walnuts.  I think the secret to the great taste is the pudding.  I can't wait for others to try them tomorrow.  It did make 32 cupcakes and I cooked them for 25-27 minutes.  They are good plain or with a small spot of frosting.  I will have to try them with whip topping, I think that would be great for Thanks Giving.  I will definitely be making them again and probably very soon.

decadent and delicious. hailed as "all-time best-tasting cupcake" by three different family friends from three different families. I have been searching for the perfect cupcakes to serve at a bridal shower and so I wanted non-family reviews for some honesty! I read through a vast amount of reviews and decided to skip crystalized ginger. I increased ginger powder to 1 tsp. I used seasonal Jello pumpkin spice pudding and 3 eggs. They were not light and fluffy for sure. Very moist and somewhat dense. I filled each muffin liner to just below the top and got exactly 24 cupcakes. These are absolutely perfect without any frosting IMHO but per husband's request I used a simple cream cheese frosting of 5 T butter, 8 0z. creamcheese (1/3 less fat), 2 cups of powdered sugar, 2 t. vanilla and 1/2 t. cinnamon. holy buckets...I am still on the search for the other 2 flavors of cupcakes but THESE HAVE MADE THE LIST...for life!!! sorry, one last thing. Baked for 27 minutes and they were perfect!!!

Absolutely amazing, best cupcakes I have ever had!!! I followed the recipe/cooking time exactly and they came out PERFECT and made 24 delicious cupcakes.  They didn't even need frosting but I used the cream cheese frosting from the Gingerbread Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting recipe and they were even better which I did not think was possible. Awesome!!!

I loved this recipe.  The cupcakes were moist, delicious, and made my house smell wonderful.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I omitted the crystalized ginger, and therefore felt I couldn't accurately rate this dish as written.  I hope I'm not being unfair to the chef, since I LOVED the non-crystalized-ginger results.  I will be making these for years to come.  As a side note, I made these as mini cupcakes (bake for 15-16 minutes) and topped with a cream cheese frosting.  Fantastic!

amazing flavor. The batter came out too heavy though. Even after baking. Since the flavor was so good I did play with it and found using half a pkg of pudding and 3/4 oil instead of butter yielded a better texture

Absolutely divine. Couldn't find butterscotch pudding so I used vanilla. Other than that I made them as directed. I frosted them with cream cheese frosting. I made a double batch to take for a group of people, but my husband made me keep a bunch if them at home for him to eat. Everyone who tried them loved them.

I cannot believe that I have not reviewed this recipe before! This is my favorite pumpkin recipe and very high up on overall cupcake recipes. I slightly change the recipe each time (always leaving out the crystallized ginger) and it has turned out great each time. I just made them tonight and used a lot more pumpkin the the recipe calls for because I got the large can and they still taste great. It usually makes more than 24 cupcakes. 
I have taken them to school multiple times and people keep asking for them. The head of my school loves them. 
I alternate between using a cream cheese icing and serving them plain. The flavor is so good and strong that I prefer them plain but most of the kids love the frosting. This is a great, easy, perfect recipe for fall (and the rest of the year when I start craving it).

Yummy! Made this minus ginger,topped with cream cheese frosting sprinkled with Sweet Cinnamon Sprinkles from Pampered Chef. I gave a few neighbors a special treat that day.  Too many to keep at my house, I would have eaten them all!!

This made the most unusual batter and yes, it does have the tiny flecks of the butter in it until you add the flour as a prior reviewer stated.  The consistancy of the batter is almost like a mousse when finished.  I just used a 1/3 cup utensil as my scoop and filled the liners that way.  So moist and delicate and they filled the house with a wonderful fall smell.

Love these!!!  Have made them twice, minus the crystallized ginger and they are still delicious.  I always forget to sit out the eggs and butter ahead of time.  A simple solution is to run the eggs under average temperature water for a bit and microwave the butter for about 30 secs.  They are good with or without icing, however, I like to add a cream cheese icing and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar.  It decorates them up a bit for taking places.

FANTASTIC. These muffins/cupcakes are amazing! I followed the recipe exactly and they are just wonderful! Thanks for the recipe! I topped these with a cream cheese icing but they are terrific on their own. Added bonus of making the house smell absolutely heavenly while baking. ;)

This recipe was absolutely a hit in my household!  Made two dozen and they were gone instantly.  I added a bit of cream cheese filling and frosting, a little too sweet for my taste, so next time just the frosting will be enough.

This was a hit with everyone!  Moist, flavors were great. No need for changes to the recipe.  Baked for 13-15 minutes.  I used the "mom's buttercream frosting" from allrecipes for the frosting.  Didn't last long!

Really nice.  Smooth out the tops of the cupcake batter or they'll bake into weird dollop shapes.
I topped these with a cinnamon cream cheese icing and a sprig of candied ginger - awesome!

LOVED this recipe. This was my first time baking from scratch and it came out PERFECT. I didn't use the ginger, but that's okay. I frosted them with the Creme Cheese II icing. They were a hit! Even people who didn't like pumpkin scarfed them down. :)

Tried this but will be skipping the crystallized ginger next time. It was a bit hard to find in my area and it's an acquired taste.

Absolutely fabulous! I crystallized the ginger myself by simmering 5 oz thinly sliced ginger, 1 c sugar, and 1/4 c water for an hour or so. My coworkers now call me Betty (Crocker).

Okay - I agree that these are delish!...but...I tried to check them at 20mins and they were not done, and continued to check them every few mins - they needed closer to 30mins (usually my oven runs hot).  Then I ended up with concave cupcakes :( (I made them with my girls - they didn't seem to mind).  They don't look very good, but they taste yummy.  I am definitely a baking amateur.  Do you think it was the opening the oven, or could it be because I microwaved the butter (I forgot to take it out of the fridge earlier) and it was quite runny.  Anyone know why the concave cupcake??  Love the taste of them though - so good!

Absolutely delicious -- moist, creamy and rich! The crystallized ginger was available right at Target and was a different twist on a classic recipe. I topped them with a cinnamon buttercream and walnuts, which were a nice touch. Huge hit at a holiday party and at work!

I don't even like pumpkin, but these are INCREDIBLE. They are rather sweet, in addition to being heavy and extremely moist, so I usually use more of a cream cheese glaze, as opposed to icing.

I made these for my  granddaughter’s 4th  birthday which is in October. Used  a cream cheese icing. These are the best! Moist, full of flavor, spices and crystallized ginger. The adults and children loved them! I will definitely make these again and I’m not waiting till the fall.  Great anytime of year!

These were a huge hit at a recent party.  I used crystallized ginger that didn’t have sugar on it to keep the tart and zing of ginger prominent.

I made these cupcakes and added a Cinnamon Honey Buttercream (from this Sopapilla Cupcakes Recipe, -https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/237439/sopapilla-cupcakes/).  These are amazing! My family loves them too. I will be making these again and again!

These were amazing, don't listen to the naples review. Stuff those cups full with batter, and you won't have extra. Cook it 20 minutes in a oven that works, and they're done. Make it exactly as the recipe is written and they turn out delicious. Add cream cheese frosting and you'll have a cupcake no one can resist (besides weirdos who don't like pumpkin and ginger). Enjoy!

Amazing!  Texture of cupcake was outstanding.  I used butterscotch chips with vanilla pudding mix because I couldn’t find butterscotch pudding mix.  It was “10 out of 10” from my husband and kids!

I have made these at least three or more times already, and I follow the recipe exactly except once I didn’t wait for the eggs to come to temp, and they rose even better that time. 

I just made them again, with a new container of baking soda this time, but they didn’t rise like that one time I used cold eggs.  I am careful to just mix everything up just until it looks mostly incorporated, then I finish mixing it up by spatula to be sure the flour gets into the wetness. (Less mixing usually makes them rise more. )

They are still moist and delicious!  I did candy my own ginger root this time, though, using a recipe on this site, and I always frost them in Vanilla Chai Buttercream Frosting by Spice Islands on here. 

They are really good without any frosting, too. My youngest couldn’t wait to snag one before I frosted it this time. 

They freeze wonderfully! The flavors get even better over the next few days, too. Confidently make some at Halloween and freeze half of them until Thanksgiving, just be sure to cover them up well in the meantime.

I happened to find pumpkin pudding mix and used it. Per suggestion in other reviews I only used 3/4 c sugar. These were delicious! I also used the cream cheese icing II recipe (which I halved everything except the sugar amount).

I left out the crystallized ginger but sprinkles a bit on top and also used vanilla pudding instead of butterscotch. Still an excellent cupcake. Will make again!

Amazing cupcakes. Mine turned out more like a muffin and I followed the recipe exactly including the tip to beat butter and sugar together thoroughly. That did not matter to me however because the flavor is so good. No need for frosting. Yum!

YUM!  I only have one cupcake pan so I made 12 cupcakes and 1 loaf.   (In the oven together, the loaf takes a good 30 minutes longer to finish baking).  I frosted everything with a favorite brown butter frosting, and my guests gobbled them up!  I did use the crystallized ginger both in the recipe and as a pretty garnish on the frosting, but only because I had it on hand and wanted to use it up.  I think it makes the cupcakes a little extra special, but the recipe can definitely stand on its own without it.  I’ll be making these again for sure.!  Thank you Lisa!

These were a hit with everyone, even my husband who is not a big pumpkin fan.  I changed the pudding from butterscotch to lemon.  This is a good change if you don't like your desserts extra sweet.  It also gives a very subtle lemony taste.  I did not frost these and they good as a breakfast treat as well as other times of the day.

I substituted minced ginger in a tube for crystallized, 1/2 the butter & subbed cream cheese in the recipe and made 1/2 the batch as cupcakes and the other half in a loaf pan. Took it to a potluck and it was a big hit. Delicious, really moist.

Excellent!  1/2 recipe = 15 cupcakes (filled 1/2 - 3/4 full).  Followed the very helpful baking suggestions in the review from cupcakegirl2.  Used cream cheese frosting (1/2 recipe).  (Split the pudding mix in two portions, saved 1/2 to use next time.) Will make again.

This recipe was seriously amazing! I didn't have any allspice but it still turned out perfectly. It's very thick and almost muffin-like, but the butterscotch inside makes it really gooey. These are best when warm and right out of the oven. I left out the crystallized ginger as well, but I bet that it's a nice touch.

Delicious.  I made it exactly as the recipe says except, I left out the crystallized ginger.  And got complemented by everyone that tried them.   I put a whipped cream cheese frosting on them.  Perfect.  It wasn’t too sweet and went perfect with the cupcake.  Heavy whipping cream, cream

I was super excited to try this recipe because I have a school cupcake  contest coming up.  I made it in advance in case it didn't turn out for some reason.  I think I messed up though, the final texture was gummy; maybe I overmixed the batter while adding the dry ingredients; maybe the flour started developing gluten; which might explain the gumminess.  Also, I feel like there was an overpowering ginger aftertaste.  The crystallized ginger (for me) was a bit strong.  I don't want to say negative things, this recipe was really attractive for me because of the high ratings and reviews, which means it was probably me that messed up somehow.  Good job on this recipe, but my experience was only 4 stars.  Also I used the cream cheese frosting recipe on this site which turned out nicely.  Have a blessed day and happy baking!

My sister starts asking me to make these starting in September every year!  I never use the ginger because I couldn’t find it the first time I made them and didn’t miss it at all.  I have made this with canned purée and fresh and it is fabulous both ways!  I also don’t use icing and treat these more as a muffin-then it’s healthy, right?

The only change I made was of necessity.   I can't find butterscotch instant pudding in any grocery.  I used vanilla.  These are very well received.  I take them to meetings.
I get 30 cupcakes out of this recipe.
I have made them without the crystallized ginger.   They are quite mild flavored then, but good for preschoolers.

These cupcakes w/cc icing or muffins are scrumptuous. Yes the batter is thick . I bake 23-25 minutes. I have made this recipe several times and my modified version is this: for 1/2 c. Of butter I substitute 1/3 c. Applesauce. I also reduce the amount of overall sugar. I used kitchen shears instead of a food processor and it seemed easier this year; less of a gummy mess.  Usually 1/4 c. batter in each muffin tin produces 24. So good either with or without icing!

Walmart had the crystallized ginger in the spice section.  At $9 for a little jar it made these expensive but I can get two batches out of the jar. Recipe made 28 -30 cupcakes and I had to bake for 30 minutes.  I did not change any ingredients.  I am in the minority by thinking these were just ok.  I think pumpkin spice might add to the flavor.  My daughter likes just the cupcake and my husband and I both added cream cheese icing.  They were good but not drop dead delicious.  I will make again - sometime unless I find some other way to use the ginger bought especially for these.  Thanks for the recipe - it was fun to try them.

These are AMAZING.  I couldn't find butterscotch instant pudding, so made them with Vanilla instead.  Also, I followed the creater's tip to beat the mix EXTRA long, which worked to make my cupcakes light and fluffy. 

So good. Will definitely make again.

These cupcakes are delicious, full of flavor and bake up much lighter than you think they will. I used another reviewers suggestion to use a cookie scoop to fill the cupcake papers and it was very helpful. Although the batter is very thick, you'll notice when scooping that it's very light if you've properly creamed the butter and sugar, then slowly added the flour only mixing until no dry ingredients show. I didn't have crystallized ginger at the time so upped the dry ginger (my tween daughter loved them) but recommend using the candied ginger for the extra kick of flavor.  We frosted with orange tinted cream cheese frosting and used a black piped icing around the edges that we pulled thru (using a toothpick) to look like spider webs for Halloween. A keeper.

I made these yesterday following the recipe as written.  I topped them with cream cheese frosting.  They were really, really delicious!!  I already have plans  to make  them again for Thanksgiving.  Just a note: they do not rise as much as regular cupcakes and I will fill the tins slightly more next time I make them.   Thank you for this recipe- it's wonderful!

I made these cupcakes for a family get together recently mainly because they seemed perfect for fall.  They were great and even the kids liked them.  Because of the kids, I cut the ginger in smaller pieces but next time I won't as the ginger seemed to almost disappear.  It is important to make sure your sugars and butter are mixed til light and fluffy so don't give up if it seems to take a while.  I made a whipped cream cheese frosting and piped them high to make little ghosts with mini chocolate chip eyes, very cute and yummy!  I'll make them again.

These pumpkin ginger cupcakes are TO DIE for !!!  Just a few, small adjustments to the recipe were made substituting Instant Vanilla pudding for the Butterscotch (because the store did not carry Butterscotch pudding), and omitted the crystallized ginger and upped the ground ginger to 1 and 1/4 teaspoons.  I used the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe from Allrecipes as a PERFECT frosting to complement these cupcakes !!!  Everyone RAVED about how delicious these cupcakes were and they were GONE before I could get a second bite !!!!  Thanks for sharing !!! BY FAR the best cupcakes I have ever eaten !!!!!

I LOVE this recipe! This is my favorite thing to make in the fall because it has such a variety of taste. I normally make it with one of the cream cheese icing recipes on AllRecipes and everyone goes nuts for it!

These were a HUGE hit with everyone- especially with Fall around the corner.  The only modification that I used was that I was unable to locate crystallized ginger so I purchased the uncrystallized slices from Costco and chopped those up. They worked out just perfectly.  I might even put more in to give it more ginger flavor.  There's no frosting with this recipe so I doubled the cream cheese frosting  recipe that one of the other reviewers gave.

Very sweet and rich, does not need an overly sweet icing.  Made it with basic cream cheese icing but cut sugar in half.  Batter filled two standard muffin pans.

Made exactly as written except for the candied ginger because I was out.  Everyone RAVED about them topped with a simple cinnamon cream cheese buttercream.  My pumpkin-hating friend who has owned several restaurants spent several minutes telling me how great the texture and spice level were.  This is definitely a keeper for my family!!  The batter was extremely thick but it baked up nice and light!

These are amazing!! Mine are more like muffins than cupcakes. These are probably the best muffins I have ever made. We made a single batch yesterday so today we are going to make a double batch. We made it as per the recipe except that my daughters wanted to use fresh pumpkin puree so we switched that. Great recipe!

With a pair of leftover roasted sweet potatoes to use up, I chose this recipe to modify.  Based on reviews, I decided to skip the frosting and add a streusel topping.   I was out of candied ginger but had a bag of Trader Joe's spiced pecans, which I chopped and used half in the batter and half in the streusel -- it worked out brilliantly!

Perfect. I did omit ginger and replaced it with CHOCOLATE CHIPS! Everyone loved it. Then, I made a second batch same way but GLUTEN-FREE by using all-purpose GF flour along with 1/2 tsp xantham gum. Again I threw in a handful on chocolate chips. They are sooooo delicious!

I’ve seen this recipe pop up several times over the past few years, and finally decided to give it a try.  I followed recipe exactly, except didn’t have the crystallized ginger- so I used an extra teaspoon of ginger, and I didn’t have butterscotch pudding mix- so I used vanilla pudding mix I had on hand.    This made exactly 24 cupcakes, and the cooking time was perfect, despite a previous comment I’d read.  As for the cupcakes:  they are delicious!   Perfectly spiced, moist, and a great texture.     For the icing, I didn’t want something super sweet, and  I don’t like cream cheese, so I found an article for a recipe entitled “Pioneer Woman- that’s the best frosting I ever had”.   It’s made with granulated sugar instead of powdered sugar, and it’s amazing!   Added cinnamon to it, and it was the perfect accompaniment to the cupcakes!

I'm not a huge fan of cupcakes but I had left over vanilla cream cheese frosting from another bake and found this recipe. I also couldn't find the candied ginger and opted for 1 1/4 tsp. ground as others had.  These have to be my new favorite. Will definitely be making again....and again.

Made them twice. 
First time with the pudding mix as suggested. Very tasty but a little goo in the middle. Almost seemed like they were under cooked, so. . . . 
Second time I made them without pudding mix. Still very tasty but fluffier without the goo. I did however cook them for more like 35-40 minutes to get a good spring back when touched. 

Also - putting one small piece of the the UNCOOKED crystallized ginger on the top of each muffin really adds a *PUNCH*! Yummm!

I used vanilla pudding since I'm not a butterscotch fan and was unsure how the butterscotch flavor would be.  I had to bake mine for 25 minutes and should have gone even a couple minutes more. They turned out great and I will definitely make again.

I made these cupcakes for Thanksgiving.  I thought the ginger flavor masked the pumpkin flavor.  I also agree with Naples34102 that there was a little "gumminess" for lack of a better word.  If I make it again I will  eliminate the pudding mix and add butterscotch chips, and cut back a tad on the ginger (for my families liking).

Very good and very moist! I cut down the sugar to 3/4 cup and didn't have ginger candy. I frosted with fluffy cream cheese and whipped cream frosting. Delicious! I will definitely make it again.

This are fabulous! Everywhere I take them people just rave. I have found that the ginger needs to be very well minced, it's to strong if you get a large piece. The batter is very thick but that is how it should be, I use a cream cheese frosting but it's not necessary.

My brother asked me to make something for his luncheon at work.  I didn't get a chance to make these for their bake sale, so thought I would try them for this.  He thought they were moist and delicious.

The only thing that I changed was to use vanilla pudding rather than butterscotch.  I'm not a pumpkin fan, but I did enjoy my little taste of the batter.  The ginger adds a great peppery kick to the flavor.  I thought the batter was a great fluffy texture that worked well using a scoop.  I did get 30 cupcakes out of the batch.  

I decided to go with a cream cheese frosting and added some allspice to it from the title of a recipe that I saw on the site.  I used a 1/2 tsp.  Bro couldn't taste it so I added some more until I could see a bit of flecks in the frosting.  Still, the flavor was not overpowering.  I don't like creme cheese and thankfully had Bro to taste-test it for me.  I'm sure they will be a hit at the luncheon.  UPDATE:  They loved them.  some said that they were the best cupcakes ever.

I made a couple of changes. i only had 10 oz of pumpkin puree so i made it up with 5 oz of unsweetened apple sauce. i also used 1 cup ap flour and 1 cup wholewheat flour. i didn't have any butterscotch pudding, so i used vanilla pudding. These were VERY moist. i probably could have done without the applesauce and they still would have been very moist. These are also very flavourful. if i make these again, i would stick with vanilla pudding as i think the butterscotch may get lost with the cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and ginger (imho) i frosted some with a Browned Butter Cookie Buttercream and the others with a White Chocolate Buttercream. Delicious!

These turned out really good. I followed the recipe exactly except had to bake them a few minutes longer. Next time I will leave out the crystallized ginger. It was very expensive and I think they'd have plenty of ginger flavor without it.

Mum wanted a spice cake for her birthday yesterday, and I found this recipe, hoping it would turn out OK as a bundt cake. It was wonderful! It was very moist and full of flavor. I made two changes- my supermarket did not have butterscotch pudding, so I used pumpkin spice, and I used mixed spice from England instead of allspice, because it makes me happy!! I made a quick glaze with Bacardi Gold, water, vanilla, and confectioners sugar. Mum said it was her best birthday cake ever!! I will definitely make it again!

I made these exactly as described.  Since they're so heavy, I made a light vanilla whipped cream frosting, decorated with crushed butterscotch chips and extra crystallized ginger.  They were fabulous.

I had a little difficulty locating crystallized ginger - never had heard of it and looked it up, but didn't feel like making it myself. Called my granddaughter for help with that and she told me it could be purchased but not to finely dice it by placing in food processer as it would get gummy. These cupcakes were delicious and I will be making them again as soon as I get some more pumpkin. I had my son finely chop the ginger for me as I don't have a sharp knife. Had to reward him with one of the cupcakes.

I just made these today, and wow -- these are so good! Hubby pronounced them good as well. I changed the sugars to Stevia and coconut sugar because I'm diabetic, and the AP flour to Swan's cake flour because I'm curious to see if it made a difference. I tried to not over mix in my stand mixer, because of the cake flour; it was a very moist, substantial batter, and I'm glad I piped it into the muffin liners (sprayed w/Pam), as it made it a faster clean up, and you can see from the photo I posted, it baked up very nicely, and would look picture perfect if frosted. The only thing I would do differently, is add more candied ginger, and maybe throw in chopped pecans. 
It took roughly 15 mins in my oven @ 350F, and the tops did spring back when touched lightly. It was so moist, and flavorful that I did not bother to frost it because I ran out of time. 

Thankfully, my Navy commissary sells candied ginger because of the upcoming holidays, so I stocked up, and will be good for a while. Thank you for sharing, this will be my go-to recipe for delicious pumpkin cupcakes.

Terrible recipe- made it twice because I thought I screwed up the first batch. It is a dense Batter but doesn't have the cupcake consistency, more like a dense muffin that doesn't rise with a flat top. Had to throw them all out

I absolutely love this recipe! Fall will never be the same without these cupcakes. I have tweeked the spices here and there as well as an addition of honey. 3/4 cup granulated sugar 1/4 honey.
I make a spiced cream cheese frosting to top them off with. Just follow a regular cream cheese frosting recipe but add the same spices you use for the cupcakes. Or just cinnamon is really good too!
Also, I live in a high elevation area so I have to cook the cupcakes for an extra 15-20 min.

Friends talked me into entering a cupcake contest at work and I don't bake!  I litterally googled 'best cupcake recipe' and this one came up.  I make them, everyone loved them (including the judges) and I won!!  Amazing cupcakes.  Topped with a whipped cream cheese icing.

These were excellent. Mine turned out a bit more like muffins, but I probably didn't beat the butter and sugar long enough.  I only had pumpkin pie filling, not canned pumpkin, but it worked fine.  They had so much flavor!  I used a very light cream cheese icing on some and left others un-iced, for breakfast!  Yum!  Huge fan of this recipe!

I didn't have butterscotch pudding, so I used vanilla.  I don't like crystallized ginger, so I left it out. These are amazing. Soft, moist and excellent with buttercream frosting. :)

Love these cupcakes! This recipe is  a keeper worth repeating! I followed the directions exactly, the only ingredient omitted was the crystalized ginger because I couldn't find it. These were a big party favorite where I served them. Delicious!! I used a whipped cream cheese frosting, it was perfect!

These are undoubtedly the best cupcakes in existence.  I would like to suggest to other cooks to definitely USE the crystallized ginger.  It's a bit of a hassle to chop, but completely worth it when you bite into a cupcake and get that tiny burst of ginger.  I also topped with a modified version of Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site, which is the perfect combination.  I would make these every week if I could.

These are delicious. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but here are my tips: I found the crystallized ginger at Publix in the Asian Foods section made by Houkan. I've never used it before, so I decided to throw it in a food processor to cut it up... within 5 seconds I had a huge gummy ball of ginger haha. I still measured out 1/3 cup and slowly added it to the wet ingredients later on in the process. For thought that had tough, muddy batter, they probably didn't let the wet ingredients get to room temp- it DOES matter. Also, make sure you cream the butter and sugar together long enough- I let my kitchenaid go on the highest level for at least 10 mins. I had a great, workable batter and the cakes baked up beautifully. I frosted with the "basic cream cheese frosting" (with an added heavy shake of cinnamon) from this site.

Amazing!!  I couldn't find the crystalized ginger so I doubled the ground ginger and they were perfect!! I didn't change a thing and recommend that you don't.  Super simple and huge flavor.

These are amazing! I made them twice (practicing for a cookoff at work) The first batch was without the crystalized ginger  and with 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. My BF LOVED them! Needless to say I made them again a few days later for my "cookoff" and used the crystalized ginger to give them an extra special edge over other pumpkin recipes and won 1st place! I used the recipe from Taryn It Up for the cream cheese frosting and added a little more powdered sugar to set a little better. Perfection! Make these. You will love them!

Just make them exactly as is, they are perfect!  I can never find crystallized ginger so I omit. You don't even need frosting. They are that good!  I make them for the teachers and they always get rave reviews!

I loved the crystalized ginger bits in these, but they were heavy and very moist.  I love the combo of pudding and pumpkin in quick breads but I guess I think cupcakes should be lighter and less dense.

Lisa is right. My friend who doesn't like pumpkin loved these as much as we did. The blend of spices and bite of ginger is amazing. I'd give them 10 stars if I could. They really don't need icing. A dollop of whipped cream is a perfect finish. Thank you, Lisa, for a new family favorite.

I have made this both with and without the crystallized ginger.  Both were very good!  I combined it with Ina Garten's cream cheese frosting and people at work ask for them every fall.  At Christmas, I make them with a little less pumpkin and call them Ginger Spice cupcakes!

I didn't expect to love these so much because I'm not a big pumpkin lover, much less ginger, but these cupcakes are the most delicious cupcakes I've ever tasted.  I had store bought cream cheese frosting and added cinnamon. Got a lot of compliments on these, I couldn't find the crystallized ginger so it wasn't added.  I'm making it again today for someone's birthday and I'll be using the crystallized ginger this time and homemade cinnamon cream cheese frosting.  Thank you for such a delicious recipe!

These could not be any better.  Did not have crystal ginger so increased ground ginger to 1 1/2 tsp.  Made cream cheese frosting and added 1/2 tsp . pumpkin pie spice.  I bet I will be making again before the week is out.

I used 1 tsp fresh grated ginger instead of crystallized ginger. Topped cupcakes with maple cream cheese frosting. Used Pathos57 directions for Glazed Walnut garnish. Moist, tender, delicious cupcakes. Thank you Lisa Lewis for sharing this recipe.

These are delicious cupcakes!  I made right by the recipe, but made mini-cupcakes for a reception.  10-12 minutes was all they needed, and it made 9 dozen!  They are delicious as is, but cream cheese frosting will really make them special.

Followed recipe exactly. Yield: 30 cupcakes. Used Cream Cheese Frosting II and tinted it orange. Also added a small amount of orange extract which gave a light orange flavor that compliments these cupcakes very well!

The cupcakes were very moist and came out great this is the either 3rd or 4th time am making them. They are great. Reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup each white and brown sugar amounting to 1.5 cups of sugar instead of 2 cups of sugar. My friends had lots of good things to say about them. And I actually ended up sharing the recipe w/ them.

I used fresh ginger and fresh pumpkin. They are great!  My husband takes them to work in the morning for a healthy breakfast. We can't leave them alone.  It made exactly 24 even cupcakes. I like that, no waste. This recipe goes in my stash if recipes. It's diffinetely a keeper!

This is absolutely positively the best pumpkin anything that I have ever made or eaten and I'm not a pumpkin gal at all. My cupcakes came out more like muffins but it doesn't even matter because they were perfect. I only used half of the packet of butterscotch pudding and one heaping tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice in place of the other individual spices. I sold these at a bake sale and came away with fifteen orders for the holiday season. I found some pumpkin cinnamon cream cheese spread that I converted into a frosting but it truly wasn't necessary, so I saved it for something else.

Like another reviewer my batter came out extremely heavy but unlike that person I certainly didn't throw it out.  I added a some milk to lighten it a bit - they ended up taking about 40 minutes to bake.  I had no crystallized ginger so I put in about 2 tbsp powdered ginger.  Next time I'll do what another person did and put the grated fresh ginger into the batter.  The flavor is good but not outstanding.  I'll try one tomorrow and see if more of the flavor develops overnight.

These are wonderful cupcakes! I subbed applesauce for half the butter, omitted the crystallized ginger (afraid my family wouldn't like it), and doubled the ground ginger, then topped with a cream cheese frosting that wasn't too heavy on the cream cheese. My husband who doesn't like "anything pumpkin that isn't pumpkin pie" loved them, and one of my daughters thought they might be the best thing I've ever baked. Thanks for the recipe!

These were very good.  Moist and flavorful. They were great without frosting.  But  I frosted them with prepared cream cheese frosting to which I added a tsp. of allspice.  Wonderful!

These were very good. SUPER moist! I didn't think it was very...pumpkin-spicy, if that makes sense, but the cupcake itself was very unique.

I didn't have the all spice or crystallized ginger, but other than that I made this recipe exactly as written & it is AMAZING!! Better than the cupcakes at the specialty shops!! I originally made this for my husband because I'm not a huge ginger or pumpkin fan, but these turned out so good & moist. By far my favorite cupcake now! Thanks so much..def a keeper! ????

Huge hit. Made these for work party, batter made 24 cupcakes and 20 mini cupcakes. Used cream cheese frosting from this site. Paired perfectly. I also made sugarcraft flowers to go on top. Presented beautifully

Absolutely delicious. It was very moist and paired perfectly with the cream cheese frosting II recipe on this site. (I didn't have crystallized ginger so I increased ground ginger to 1 1/4 tsp)

I made these cupcakes for our family dinner.  I didn't frost them, just topped with a large scoop of whipped cream as they were served out individually.  They were a huge hit and I will make them again.  I will say, that now (two days later) they are very moist to the touch; almost too moist in my opinion.   I may try to adjust the recipe for this in my next batch.

These were absolutely amazing!  The tiny pieces of crystallized ginger you taste when biting into the cupcakes was delectable.  I ended up not even putting any icing on them because they were so good.   They were also incredibly moist and stayed fresh for at least two weeks after I baked them.

OMG these are so good. And the long they set the better they are. The only thing I did different was I mixed the dry ing. And ginger in a food processed to easily chop the ginger. It was so easy. My new go to muffin/cupcake.

Yummy! Will try the applesauce sub as I felt the cupcake wrappers were soaked in butter after sitting overnight. I, too, had set out cream cheese for icing but never thought about it again after tasting the cupcakes plain.

If I could give it 10 stars I would!!! Took these to Thanksgiving dinner and they were a total hit.  VERY moist and full of flavor.  I topped them with a cream cheese frosting.  If I could change anything... I would add more crystalized ginger!!  YUMMMMMM

Absolutely outstanding!! Made them for thanksgiving and they were gone in a matter of minutes. Should have made more! Used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of a whole cup of butter and it turned out amazing!! Used Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe!

OH MY GOODNESS! These are the best pumpkin cupcakes I've ever had.They are soooooooo moist. I didn't have the crystalized ginger,but just as good without it. I would get it more than 5 stars if I could. I think next time I am going to add a handful of raisins and walnuts to the batter.Every thing taste good with nuts in it. Thanks for a great recipe. I will be making it often.

Very yummy! I even only used one cup of sugar ( since the pudding has sugar in it already)then made a cinnamon-ginger cream cheese frosting.. Mmm!!
I didn't have the crystallized ginger but followed everything else.

Delicious! Very moist and wonderful with cream cheese frosting. I made this recipe with fresh pumpkin so I added a bit more floor to compensate. Did not have all the spices so I used pumpkin pie spice and extra ginger because I did not have the crystallized. I even changed the pudding from butterscotch to vanilla (that's all I had in the house) And they still came out tasting yummy! It seems that you cannot go wrong with this one, it's a winner!

I made these yesterday and brought to work today...they are all gone!  Absolutely amazingly moist, fragrant and delicious!!  I made them exactly as the recipe stated, except I cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup each.  It made 24 beautiful cupcakes.  I used Cream Cheese II frosting from this site, and added 1/2 t. cinnamon to the frosting as I always do for spice or carrot cakes.  Everyone in my office asked for the recipe!  We'll be baking 100 of these for Thanksgiving/Christmas.  I'll freeze until needed, thaw and frost.  Thank you SO MUCH Oviedogirl, for an amazing and unique recipe!

These were absolutely delicious! Even people who don't normally like pumpkin loved them. I didn't include the crystalized ginger because I wasn't sure where to get it, accidently forgot to add the 4th egg, and used the regular cook and serve pudding instead of instant (I noticed only after they were in the oven). All those mistakes aside, they were fabulous. I can't imagine that they would be any better if I followed the recipe exactly. You can't improve on perfection. I used the cinnamon cream cheese frosting also found on this website. Delish!!

Wow! We had a pumpkin-themed bake-off at work and this recipe made it on top. The cupcakes were moist, not too sweet, and the ginger was not overwhelming and competing with the pumpkin. I used the "whipped cream cream cheese frosting" by Tom and garnished with a piece of ginger candy. The presentation was awesome.  I followed the recipe exactly minus the allspice...as someone mentioned use nutmeg instead. This recipe is perfect and fail proof. Thanks for sharing!

A wonderful fall cupcake!!! I made two batches for my daughter's school staff. Had ladies saying these we're...Divine! 
Didn't use crystallized ginger, just added a little extra ground ginger (1 1/2 tsp total) Still perfect!
Used the Wilton Cream Cheese buttercream recipe & topped with crushed pecans. Would do same again & again!!

Some of the best cupcakes I've ever had! I might reduce the sugar in the recipe a tad but that's just personal preference. Everybody loved them just the way they were. 
Does anyone have a terrific Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting recipe to share?

This was an excellent pumpkin cupcake recipe! I didn't have crystalized ginger on hand, so I skipped this step.  It was delicious and tasted better the next day! I also made a cream cheese frosting to go on top of this and I think it complimented the cupcakes very well.  WIll definetily make again! thanks!!

Good, but more dense like a muffin than fluffy like a cupcake.  I deceased the sugar by 1/2 cup and could decrease by another 1/4 cup probably.  Did 1/2 cup butter and 3/4 cup applesauce.  Used crystallized ginger (0.03 lb. and should triple that at least to get 1/3 cup but I don't think the crystallized ginger is necessary??). 
For the frosting: 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/2 cup softened butter, 2 tsp. vanilla, 3 tsp. cinnamon  and 3 cups of powdered sugar;  perfect amount for the cupcakes, but too runny therefore add more powdered sugar

OMG, loved these although I didn't have any ground ginger I did add just a little more crystallized ginger, when we were making these my 2yr old and I taste sampled 3 of them without adding anything to them, and that's an accomplishment in its self, considering I have an extremely picky 2yr old that examines everything thoroughly before he eats them, will make again for the church Halloween party, love, love, love these

I made this recipe for the first time yesterday and there is nothing left.  I made a bundt cake instead of cupcakes and used a 1/2 cup of butter instead of the full cup and used a half cup of apple sauce, which made the cake nice and moist.  I also baked the cake for 42 minutes and dusted with powder sugar.

These cupcakes are fantastic!  I made them for a dinner party - my neighbor ate four (he was sneaky but confessed before he left).  You may have to shop around for the crystalized ginger (for price) but is really makes the taste. Also make sure to pull a recipie for the frosting as it is not included in the recipie.  

I am checking out the other recipies submitted by Ovideogirl as they look very good as well.

This is absolutely delicious....the best. It asks for instant pudding....wondering if I could substitute a regular jello pudding, the kind that needs to be cooked.

Made these for a Halloween party and they were a hit!  I did cut out the crystallized ginger because I just don't care for it and added a little more ground ginger instead. I will make these again!

INCREDIBLE recipe. These taste like they came out of a cupcake bakery. My boyfriend liked these so much that he requests them for any holiday or special event. The candied ginger adds a great chewy touch.

These turned out really good. I didn't like taste of ginger so I used very little in the mix, next time I will leave out all together & only use as a garnish if gifting them. I followed suggestions by other users - creamed butter & sugar well and was able to scoop batter into cups. Also used suggested frosting: 1/2 cup unsalted butter, 4oz cream cheese, 1 tsp vanilla & 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon (mixing cinammon well into sugar first). This frosting was AMAZING! Cook time in my oven was 18 minutes & yielded 30 cupcakes.
Thanks for sharing!

Oh my goodness! My coworker was going to make cupcakes a couple of months ago and I had seen this recipe on Allrepices' twitter page. She made them and they were some of the best cupcakes I've ever had! I bake a lot as well but have yet to try making them. At least I know they taste great for when I decide to make them myself!

She made them again this weekend as a "going away" gift for me and yep - they're just as wonderful as before!

I loved these! They were so light and fluffy as said in the description. I used cool whip for the topping and it was excellent! I am not an artist so the cool whip was not very beautiful but they tasted splendid! I would definitely recommend!

Amazing!  These were so moist and very, very good.  My kids couldn't wait for them to be frosted and ate them without and were quick to let me know that they were so good that they didn't need frosting.  I will definitely be making these again!

I tried the recipe as is and we loved it I'm not a fan of pumpkin but my husband is. I made some big that I had to cook a bit longer but the normal one were perfect in the 20min suggested. they reminded me of a carrot cake, without icing so I triedd with cream cheese icing and they were glorious.

I have made these 4 times now and I keep getting asked to make them again.  My nephew is 4 and it is the first cupcake that he has eaten and not just licked the frosting off of it.  I have a batch in the oven right now that I am going to freeze and serve with a dusting of powdered sugar on top as muffins for Thanksgiving breakfast!  I usually make a cinnamon cream cheese frosting to go on top.  Fantastic!

These are the best pumpkin cupcakes! The crystallized ginger is difficult to chop, and sometimes there are chunks in the cupcakes, but it tasted good!

I just loved these cupcakes. I followed the recipe as it is and it was moist and very good. My friends loved it. The second time I used fresh buttersquash puree replacing the canned pumpkin, and a teaspoon of fresh ginger. It was delicius! Tasted even better. I used cream cheese II icing and added ground ginger and cinnamon to it. WOW!!! - SC

What a great recipe! I don't normally eat cake or pumpkin desserts, but I ate a few and loved em. They do take much longer than the recipe stated, and also would have been nice to notate the room temp eggs in the ingredient section, I had to end up waiting after I got everything out. Didn't notice in my pre-read that it needed t be room temp. I also did what others suggested and only did half a package of butterscotch pudding mix. Delicious!

These cupcakes were amazing. I followed the recipe, iced them with a cream chees icing and put a small piece of crystalized on each one. My husband and my daughter, who do not like pumpkin, even liked them.

These cupcakes were amazing! Love this recipe. Like other reviewers, I replaced the crystallized ginger by adding more ground ginger and topped it off with cream cheese frosting along with glazed walnuts. Great recipe!

I love these cupcakes! I don't use the crystallized ginger, but I added extra ginger as one comment suggested. I also did half butter and half applesauce as suggested. They are amazing! I baked mine about 25 min. Very moist. I topped them with a browned butter frosting.

OK, so I made this recipe over the weekend...didn't have crystalized ginger either so put in 1 1/4 teaspoon of ginger as recommended by another reviewer. They were delicious!  
I did end up having to bake them for about 30-35 mins but just kept an eye on them and took them out when they were cooked thru. We ate some without frosting and then I made up some cream cheese frosting last night and they were even better! My husband took some to work this morning to share and was already asked for the recipe...
Thanks for sharing, will definitely be making these again and again!

I made these cupcakes for a crowd during our annual
Grape Harvest and they were delicious.
I did not change a thing and I was very pleased with the results.

Great fall taste with a ginger punch. It was very dense and moist. I doubled the recipe but only only used 3 sticks of butter and one 1/2 cup natural applesauce. The crystallized ginger is a staple at WholeFoods and really does ramp up the taste! I used the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting as it is not that sweet but a great compliment to this cake!

I tried one from the first batch out of the oven and immediately started making another!  I made them two weeks ago and everyone is still raving about them.  I took half to work, and my kids and their friends ate the other half.  My son proclaimed, "Mom you should sell these and make lots of money!"  They are by far some of the best cupcakes I've ever tasted.  I topped mine with simple buttercream icing, but I'm thinking of getting more adventurous next time!

Delish! I followed the recipe exactly minus the crystallized ginger. I'm incredibly happy with how they turned out. I'm pretty picky about the outcome of my cupcakes, and these were perfect. I topped them with a light cream cheese frosting.

These cupcakes are to autumn like sugar cookies are to Christmas!  LOVED THEM!  I even forgot to cream in the brown sugar and added it in at the end.  They still turned out moist and SOOO much flavor. Try not to skip the crytstallized ginger!  Icing is optional for sure but I am still going to try it with the icing.  This is a keeper!

These were a big hit at the office.  I substituted nutmeg for allspice and omitted the  crys. ginger because I didn't have either on hand and they turned out perfect!  Used Cream Cheese II icing which was so yummy on these.  I'll be making these again and again.

I made these for the October birthdays in the office and everyone commented on how moist they were.  They also said that these were the best pumpkin cupcake/bar they have ever had.  For the frosting I used a cream cheese with cinnamon.

I made these exactly as instructed except I used 1 1/2 teasp ginger instead of chystalized ginger (because I couldn't find it).  The taste and texture were very good but the batter was too much for the 24 cupcakes it described. I only baked it for 20 minutes (as instructed)they were completely cooked but the cupcakes didn't raise properly in the middle. I think that if I only fill them 1/2 full it might raise just to the top of the pan as desired. Many have said that they were too dense. Mine were just right but I think that was due to beating the sugar and butter for a very long time, until it was "light and fluffy". I will try these again but just fill the pans half full and hope they rise in the middle this time. These cupcakes will make your house smell wonderful.

These cupcakes were AMAZING. I would give them 10 stars if I could. Moist and delicious. I normally don't like the taste of ginger but I can't stop eating these. I didn't change a thing, and I don't think that they need icing because they are sweet enough.

They turned out ok but burnt on most of the bottoms even though I baked at 350 and I had to add 5 minutes in order to cook them all the way through. The taste is fine but they are fairly mushy not like real pumpkin bread. Next time I'll reduce the heat to 325 bake for 30 minutes and minus the pudding mix. Instead adding another 1/2 cup flour and an additional egg to make up for the moister.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly but when I saw how stiff the batter is, I decided to try making only 12 cupcakes and scooping the rest of the batter into my "perfect brownie pan".  Worked pretty good, but will reduce the oven temp to 300 if I try it that way again.  No need to change any ingredients.  These are just what I was looking for, pumpkin with a little kick.  Thanks!

I made these cupcakes for a family party. I was doing too many things at the same time and didn't realize I had missed the baking soda until the cupcakes were in the oven. Yikes!   I couldn't wait to taste one as soon as they were out of the oven to see if they were ok. Yum,Yum!
End of story. Everyone loved them. I plan on making these again and will include baking soda.

Reviews were right, this is a wonderfully moist flavorful cupcake.  I didn't add the crystalized ginger to the recipe, but used as garnish. I'm glad I left it out because it tasted like soap.

These were soooo good.  Grand kids got the first ones before I could frost them.  The frosting didn't make much difference as these were the best cup cakes ever. I followed the recipe exactly.  Will make these for

Very tasty recipe!  I ended up baking these cupcakes for five minutes longer than the recipe called for, which is unusual for my oven.  I also let them sit for 15 minutes before removing them from the pan as they seem way too hot after ten.  I topped them with a "basic" cream cheese frosting and then added a Hershey's pumpkin spice "Kiss" at the top. They were a huge hit at my house today and made the house smell GREAT!

This recipe came out amazing for me! I was careful not to over-mix my batter, and cut the butterscotch pudding mix in half(I don't mind my cupcakes a bit on the sweeter side) according to some other commenters. I also added five minutes onto the cook time, although I rarely had to use it. I used the toothpick test method before I took any of the batches out of the oven, and it came out fine!

The cupcakes are loaded with spices and pumpkin(both of which I adore), and the cream cheese icing balances the taste of it out perfectly. I will admit that they might have too much spice if I didn't have the icing on, but together it is perfect! I was uncertain about the crystallized ginger in it, but it gives these cupcakes just a bit of a bite to them.

The result is flippin' fantastic! I will definitely be making these again.

This has become one of my favorite cupcake recipes!  The extra effort is well worth it.  Paired it with Cream Cheese Frosting II by Janni.  Perfect!

These cupcakes are AMAZING! They were not the easiest cupcakes to make, however. The batter was very thick and impossible to "pour" into the cupcake tray, because of this my cupcakes came out very uneven. Regardless, they tasted delicious and my boyfriend and I both love them so I can deal with them not looking perfect!
