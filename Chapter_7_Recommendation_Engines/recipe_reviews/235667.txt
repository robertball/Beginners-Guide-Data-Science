These were a huge hit in my house! I've also made them using Greek spice instead of Italian, it was very scrumptious....mmmmmm

The flavor of these meatballs was delicious but the texture was rubbery.  If anyone knows how to avoid this, I would be interested to know.

I didn’t have onion soup mix so I feel mine turned out a little bland. And instead of feta, I used cubes of semi frozen marble cheese. They weren’t frozen enough because they had melted through. Next time I will try with feta and it will be glorious.

These were amazing but a. It to much pepper for our tasting. Second time around I used half the pepper and they were perfect. They make a Great addition to any Italian meal or by themselves they are just as good. They even freeze well so you can make a bunch ahead of time.

My husband loved it. I did change some of the ingredients, and also the temperature: (1) plain bread crumbs instead of Italian-seasoned bread crumbs (2) 1 pc. fresh medium size onion instead of onion mix (3) Veal instead of beef (more tender) and (4) 160 degrees C instead of 220 degrees C (same: for 30 minutes)

I didn't change anything except I used plain bread crumbs as I didn't have any italian style on hand.  These are pretty good meatballs, and not very hard to put together.  I rolled them by hand then poked my finger into them to make a little hole to drop the feta in and then pinched the meat back together and gave another quick roll to round the meatball back out.  It made 24 good sized meatballs.  Would also be great with some marinara sauce and provolone on subs as the feta isn't too overwhelming.  I served them with broiled zucchini spears and was a great low carb dinner.
