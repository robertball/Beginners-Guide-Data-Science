I LOVE a good kitchen-sink recipe. Because I don't agree with changing a recipe then rating it, I made it exactly as written. Great healthy soup that tasted wonderful. I'll be making this one again.

The soup was very good but I did do a few things differently. I doubled the herbs, garlic and onion  for more flavor as well as adding in other seasoning. I felt like the stock would have been bland without the extra. Great soup, will definitely be making this again!

I followed the instructions to the T and after it was finished I tried it and was so sad.  I was super bland!! So I added red robin seasoning, same thing as seasonal all essentially, and still felt like it was bland.  I let it sit over night and the next morning it was AWESOME!!! I guess after sitting and all the ingredients integrating over time was just what this recipe needed!! My 7 month old who is barely eating baby food loved this!!! I mashed it up a bit and he can't get enough!! Yum!! I broke the recipe into thirds too.  Two frozen containers for dinner two later times and one third now.  Yum!

Really good flavour by using the whole chicken. It all disappeared, so we all liked it, including baby.

This soup is pretty fantastic! I made it as written, but w/o cabbage. My 3yo son smelled it and declared he was "starving for this stew!" Only change I would make next time is to use all dark meat, as the breast meat got a little tough.

This was super yummy! I have never had kohlrabi and had no idea what to do with it. I came across this recipe knowing that I wanted a soup of some kind. It was perfect! My children and husband all ate seconds and agreed that we should make it again. Wonderful blend of veggies.

I’m not the best cook but this came out fabulously. I had our butcher cut the chicken in 8ths instead of 4ths, and I cut the celery too small so just left it in. I didn’t have parsley or green beans, but did have kale and spinach so I threw that in. I omitted black pepper and tomato since my hubby has GERD and these ingredients trigger it for him.

Decent, but I appreciate using veggies I don’t normally buy, like kohlrabi. I doubled the herbs as well. I would love tips for some extra zing!

Delicious! Wonderful for mending and healing the tummy! I didn't have kohlrabi, and chose not to use corn, and it still turned out delicious!

This was perfect for a lot of my veggies from the garden. The only substitution I made was squash instead of potatoes. Sooo yummy!

Hearty and chock full of veggies, this soup is a MEAL!  I did add more liquid, as well as bouillon, seasoned salt, and black pepper.

Very healthy and great for those on low carb. I used turkey thighs instead of chicken and also used veggie stock (Swanson) to cook turkey in. Extra turnips instead of spuds, too! YUMMY!

I love this soup! I used a chicken stock as base and switched potatoes for zucchini to make it a bit lighter.. It is very healthy and super fast to make! Fresh green beens and fresh corn taste amazing, makes me never want to go back to frozen veggies!  I will definitely cool it again. Thank you for sharing  the recipe!

Wow.  Just wow.  I did not have kohlrabi, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.   This was absolutely FANTASTIC!
