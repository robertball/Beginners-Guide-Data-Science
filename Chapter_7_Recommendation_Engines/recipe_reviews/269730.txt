Self-rising flour huh? That explains what I've been doing wrong all these years. I've made plenty of beer batter but have always used AP flour because that is what I keep on hand. While it always turns out good, it doesn't stay crisp more than 10 minutes. Self-rising flour is the answer. This turned out great and held up well. The one thing that did not work for me as written is that 1 cup of beer was not enough liquid to get a batter. I'm not sure how much I ended up adding in the end but if I were to have to guess I'd say I doubled it. I can't wait to try this with fish. Thanks for sharing!
