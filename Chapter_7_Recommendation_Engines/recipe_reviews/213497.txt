This was a good recipe that I will use again.  Since the recipe called for vinegar, I used Apple cider vinegar. I also love Garlic so i used fresh garlic not power.  The sauce was great over mash potatos and stuffing.

I was wondering what to do with pork chops that I hadn't already done. This was a great recipe. I used a mushroom gravy and added fresh mushrooms. I also paired it with with mashed potatoes and roasted cabbage. It was delicious!

This dish is oh-so-good!  Other reviews were spot on when they said the sauce is great on mashed potatoes... the pork was Super!  Thanks so much for sharing.

This was really good!  The chops were nice and tender and the gravy was delicous.  When I first whisked together the gravy ingredients the smell of the vinegar scared me a little bit.  It seemed strong.  But I went with it and am so glad I didn't try and do something to "fix" it because it was just perfect.

These were really good!  I almost didn't add the brown sugar because I thought it was strange and I don't really like sweet entrees.  I'm glad I did though, it wasn't sweet and they were delicious!

This was a huge hit with my family.  I doubled the gravy ingredients, then browned my chops and added them to the crockpot with the gravy.  I cooked them for 5 hours on low.  I added cornstarch at the very end to the thicken the sauce.  Served with mashed potatoes, it is a winner!

I tried this recipe "as is" and it was very good.  The second time I made it I had forgotten the brown gravy mix, so I substitued i packet of Lipton Onion soup mix and it was fantastic!  My family loved it and so did I.

Just finished this recipe and OH MY GOSH!!!It has rave reviews in my household full of picky eaters. I substituted brown gravy for brown onion gravy and it blended together nicely.  I also served it with Red Garlic Mashed Potatoes, another recipe I found here and the sweetness of both complimented each other very well. This is a keeper!

Our pork chops were a cross between chops and steaks.  You could really smell the apple cider vinegar while mixing this all together. After just one bite you will be glad you followed the recipe.  Next time, I will double the gravy because it does start to crystalize.  Paired this with "garlic and herb mashed potatoes" from this site.  Great and easy meal without all the fuss.

Delicious. DH does not care for pork chops but said these were very good. I used canola oil instead of veg. oil because that is what I have. Made a mistake and added onion powder instead of garlic powder. Came out great. The gravy is so tasty, poured some over our mashed potatoes. Will be making these again.

These porkchops are fork tender. I always double the gravy because I want plenty for my mashed potatoes. This is the best recipe for pork chops I've ever tried, my only regret is I didn't discover this recipe 10 years ago.

I made this recipe again and this time I doubled the directions for the gravy and added an 11.5 ounce package of a brand name refrigerated pulled pork and let it simmer for about 20 minutes. I served it on hamburger buns. No leftovers! Thank you, Cooking Mama.

I tried this recipe last night for dinner and it was an absolute hit with my family. The only thing I will do different the next time is NOT add the brown sugar, I'm not a big fan of sweet sauce. I did add onions and mushrooms to my sauce and it was DELICIOUS!!!!!!!

I followed the recipe and it was great.  The only thing different was I could only cook 3 pork chops at a time. So after I fried them I put them in a 9x13 pan, then I thickened the sauce in the frying pan where I had the pork chops, poured the gravy over the chops covered with tin foil and stuck in oven on 350 for 30 minutes.  Turned out great.

I made this recipe and followed the recipe as it is written. It was delicious and very fast and easy! I will definitely make this again and again. The only thing I think I will try is adding some sauteed mushrooms and onions because I think that it would be a nice addition to the delicious sauce this recipe makes. Don't be afraid to try this one, you won't be sorry!

The chips were very very tender. They were quite good but I think could have used a little more season. I think I will add Adobo next time.

The meat was tender, and the flavor was ok, but nothing all that spectacular.  I would make it again since it was so simple, but I'll probably continue on my search for a better simple pork chop recipe.

This was a great recipe! Los of flavour. I made it without any changes and it was a big hit with the family. It kind of had a German taste which we love and I will make again as it is so quick and easy.

This was very tasty, my family and I enjoyed it. I used boneless pork loin chops. They stayed nice and moist. Will make again. Very easy too!

Good one! Easy as can be! Tender pork chops, perfect gravy. This fits in well with a low carb diet.

We loved this. I made some changes. Used pork gravy pack,fresh garlic, a can of cream of mushroom,and a can of Franco America beef gravy. It was oh so good! Very very easy.  Served with mash potato and corn. The pork was so tender. I will make this again, again and again. If you get my point.  lol Enjoy people! :)

Oh so good..that is such an apt name for these pork chops...made them exactly as the recipe called for.  Did use apple cider vinegar as someone had mentioned.  Soo good and sooo easy!!!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!
