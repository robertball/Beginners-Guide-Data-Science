This was really good, a few alterations for my taste: I used aborio rice (I don't know what carnaroli rice is, and always use aborio for risotto). I left out the apple juice and the corn (because I thought corn was a weird add, and my husband is allergic to apple juice). It was a great way to eat tofu.

Very yummy recipe--I made this for christmas dinner and the family liked it as well, even with the tofu.  I found it easier to simplify by cooking the rice any way that is easier (I used instant) with the stock, which does add a lot of flavor.  Then, I just added everything in.  Mushrooms may taste good added in. (I'll try that next time)

Very yummy. Didn't work too well with brown rice, but I'm still learning how to cook with that. A nice intro to tofu dish.

Super Delicious!  I stuck to the recipe and it was to die for.  Whole family loved it.  Definitely will make this again.

I used aborio rice, i couldn't find the other one. It turned out kind of bland, i dont know if i will make this again. I liked it but it was not a big hit with my family.

I really like this dish. It's very filling, and all of the broth makes the rice delicious. I use stars or pastatini (from Barillo)and don't use corn.

This was a very bland dish and was too dense for me.  I will not make this again

I added mushrooms and used white wine instead of apple juice. Also used sea salt and pepper. I bought a big can of artichoke hearts. very good!
