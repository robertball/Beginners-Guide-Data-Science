I've made these 2 times now.  Very tasty.

I replaced these ingredients:
* 1/2 cup finely shredded cabbage 
* 1 small carrot, grated
with store bought Cole Slaw mix.  Then used what was left over from the package to make Cole Slaw.

This makes the making of them much easier.

I also don't usually have BBQ Sauce in the house.  I made my own using
2 parts Ketchup
1 part Honey
1 part Hoisin Sauce

I serve them with Hoisin Sauce and Duck Sauce for dipping.

These are great.  They were easyt to make and tasted yummy.  I sprayed mine with Pam and baked at 400 for about 40 minutes/turning them over half way, instead of frying and they were a hit.  I also only had one can of the chicken in the house and that was okay too.

The filling is nice and light and the flavor is great. I added some fried onions to your recipe and used KC Masterpiece honey barbeque sauce.  Also, I do not like to deep fry â€¦ its too greasy.  I just put them in a lightly greased foil and pan, and brown ~ viola ~

Very tasty. Great for teens get togethers, when my kids want something a little different but not to different I make these.

Not a fan of can chicken. Our test batch proved that we needed to add more flavor to drown out the can chicken taste. So we added peanut sauce and it turned out pretty good.

Good recipe. Next time I might tinker a bit by adding some additional ingredients, celery, more onion...

These are great, however,I didn't include some of the ingredients such as carrots, barbecue, and hot pepper sauce, but, I added lemon juice, fresh ginger, fresh garlic and extra soy sauce. I also substituted cabbage for Napa cabbage, and, chunk canned chicken for chicken breast. Anyway, these were delicious, and everyone who tried them liked them! I will definitely make these again!

I used chicken breast, chopped into small pieces which I them cooked in "Kathy's Award Winning Barbeque Sauce" from this site.  My loved the cooked chicken, but I found deep frying the spring rolls made them come apart, so I baked half of them and they stayed together perfectly.  But my hubby didn't care for these he said all you could taste was the Barbeque sauce and the texture was off.  It might have been okay if I didn't add any more Barbeque sauce like the recipe said to add.

I thought these were ok, but not great. The flavor was pretty bland, and the filling was kind of soggy. I won't be making these again. Thanks anyway.

The recipe was easy but I was alittle thrown off by the bbq sauce, it took away from the authentic taste of a spring roll.

These were soo good. I made this with sesame chicken and egg drop soup. My husband said that it was one of his favorite meals that I cook! I liked the barbecue sauce in it but next time I may do a little bit less and add more soy sauce/worcestershire sauce. I also added more of hte mixture to the spring roll paper and made bigger egg rolls instead of tightly roll egg rolls to cut down on the fying. I will definitley be making this again!

probably wouldn't make this recipe again just because it tasted like barbecued chicken in a fried wonton.  Not bad- just not what I was looking for.

Not bad, the BBQ sauce gave it a different taste, in an alright way.

very tasty and easy to make. no exotic or expensive ingredients. I used some leftover roasted chicken breast instead of canned and cut the BBQ sauce down. also I don't deepfat fry so I pan fried them in peanut oil and they were wonderful!  will definitely try them again!
