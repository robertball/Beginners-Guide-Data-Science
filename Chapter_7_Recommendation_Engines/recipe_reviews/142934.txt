I thought I would try this recipe because the unique ingredients in the glaze.  I think there needs to be some adjusting to the ingredients.  You definitely don't need 6 eggs, and there wasn't enough glaze.  It was plenty sweet but a little bland for my taste.  I added some teriyaki sauce after.  It was a lot of work and mess for something that really just didn't deliver.

This was a great dish, I really liked it. However, I made it with just 2 servings of chicken, for my boyfriend and I, but we used the original quantities for the sauce and that was just enough. So I would say that there just isn't enough sauce for the amount of chicken. Otherwise, a really good dish, with plenty of flavour.

Things are going well. The stir fry is cooking up nicely. The glaze needs more sauce, increase everything incrementally and it would turn out better. I also think the batter portion only needs about five eggs. I also substituted pork instead of chicken, and that turned out okay. Like the other reviewer, I will add soy sauce to help flavor it.

Some changes I made:
Added teriyaki sauce
Added Red paper flakes for some oomph
Added regular milk instead of condensed
Added brown sugar
Added crushed peanuts
I doubled almost all of the ingredients for more glaze/sauce
Only needed 3 eggs for 2 chicken breasts cut into cubes
Added green and red bell peppers
Don't need that much flour. only enough to coat the chicken
I also added cooked white rice into the chicken and glaze and stir fried
And with the left over egg I poured it into the pot and cooked it with everything.
YUM!

I made this and was not impressed. The chicken was nice and tender, but the sauce lacked flavor. This is one dish I will not make again

I pan fried the chicken with salt and pepper. I doubled the sauce recipe, added some soy and Worcestershire sauce, about a TBS of red pepper flakes, I deglazed the pan with orange juice and added the drippings to the sauce. Mixed with the chicken and sauteed onions, peppers and garlic, topped with scallions. FABulous! This is a great base recipe that can be use  in many variations.

The chicken had no flavor, the sauce did not mix well and we ended up throwing the whole dish away. What a waste of 2 lbs of chicken :( I am pretty upset because usually I can go off of all the reviews and judge a good recipe, but unfortunately this recipe is not it. I will not be making this dish again and I recommend no one else tries it either. What a waste.
