Raquel these were super yummy! The only thing that I did change was I used saltines instead of bread crumbs because I was out and too lazy to make some. I love the addition of potato, it gave the cakes a great flavor! These were super simple and quick to make. Thanks for a great recipe that I will continue to use.

I made these the other night for dinner. They were excellent. The only change I made was to add 3 cloves of minced garlic in place of the garlic powder b/c I didnt know I was out of it. Even my kids who hate fish liked these. Thanks Raquel I will be making these again.

Great Recipe.  I omitted the potato and used panko breadcrumbs instead.  I also made a lemon aioli to go on the side for dipping.  Very good dish with no complaints from the family nor leftovers!

Hey, I am the recipe submitter. This recipe was featured in the daily videos on Jan 8th, 2013 and I just want to confirm that video is made by AR and not by me, so if there are differences from what is actually written here, that is not my doing. Either way, have fun and play around with your ingredients! :)

Delicious with a few changes.  I used thin-sliced scallions in place of onion. Used 2x finely crushed corn Chex in place of breadcrumbs to make it gluten-free. I also mixed in a little shredded cheddar cheese (yum).  I refrigerated the mix for a while to make it easier to make patties with. Fried in a little butter, served with lemon juice on top and garlic aioli. Soooooo good!!.............................PS.                 
If you find them hard to work with, a couple things to keep in mind.  Drain the tuna and potatoes thoroughly to remove all excess moisture.  Also, refrigerate the mixture before cooking.

AWESOME! This is my first review but I had to because this is a tasty inexpensive lazy dinner night type recipe. Added 1/2c. green onion, couple shakes hot sauce, heaping tbsp. Mayo for smooth consistency and I baked on foil lined cookie sheet sprayed with oil, at 350 for around 20-25 min...my husband told me I needed a raise because he isn't paying me enough. Used albacore tuna and had no problem at with dryness.  Thanks Raquel

I tried it both without and with the potato, and I have to say, the potato really makes this recipe. The patties hold together a lot better than with flour and egg alone. I also used a quick sauce made from equal parts spaghetti sauce and real mayo + 1tsp of fresh squeezed lemon juice. Perfect! If you microwave the potato, the whole meal can come together in under 10 minutes!

I loved this! I added about 1/4 cup shredded raw spinach leaves for some hidden veggies, and served with a little ketchup. Even my 19 month old daughter loved this and ate her entire tuna cake! Thank you for such a non "fishy" tasting tuna recipe.

I used an albacore tuna and that was a mistake. They were very dry and fell apart in my pan. Don't get me wrong, they were DELICIOUS!! But I'll use tuna that is more moist the next time.

Made this for evening meal tonight.  Very different from the usual fried tuna that my mother made.  Next time I will cut back on the Dijon mustard and Garlic powder.  And eliminate the cayenne pepper.  Too spicy for us old folks.  It also took quite a bit more olive oil before they were browned.  Otherwise a nice change from the usual fare.

I would have given this recipe a 5, but I didn't use a potato. I followed the recipe closely with the exception of reducing the amount of cayenne pepper and increasing the amount of breadcrumbs. I did not add onions, but it didn't seem to matter much. Great easy, fast recipe that involves most ingredients you have. I used an ice cream scooper to make scoopfuls of patties, then flattened them while they were in the skillet. This prevented them from breaking.

This recipe is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. I just finished making it and eating and it came out PERFECT.

I also substituted the garlic powder with 3 garlic cloves, just cause i love authentic garlic flavor. My dad couldn't helping smelling them while i was cooking and he loved the finished product as well.

Definitely recommend and will be making again. GO LENT!

delicious! Boyfriend loved these, and not too spicy at all! Served with dipping sauce- 2 parts mayo, 2 parts sour cream, 1 part plain yogurt, some onion powder and a pinch of cayanne pepper. Needed the sauce as it was a bit on the dry side. for next time I will try and make these thinner so they will turn out more with a crunch on the outside. Overall- very good, and you should give a try! Only took me 30 minutes start to finish too, made 7 medium patties the size of my palm.

I made this using canned salmon instead. I reduced the cayenne to a pinch or two (actually, I used chili powder but it is so much hotter than it should be, hotter than even traditional cayenne so I always have to cut back) and added the hot sauce as posted by the recipe submitter. We thought they were tasty and not too spicy; I am considering using jarred crushed chilies instead of the hot sauce and cayenne next time. Served this with "Corn and Rice Medley" and "Quick Tartar Sauce" from AR.

I felt that this recipe was just ok for me.  I felt that it was lacking texture and flavor.  I served to with a lemon caper sauce which did help.  It really think this recipe has potential though.  I will try it back again but next time I think I will add some black beans and corn to the mixture and serve it with a chipolte sauce overtop and see how that works

Eat your heart out, crab cakes!  I made sure to strain all the juice out of the tuna so they wouldn't be soggy.  I used instant potatoes instead of taking the time to peel, slice, boil, and mash.  The flavor of these cakes was excellent, but next time I think I will replace the cayenne pepper with a few dashes of hot sauce.

I was looking for something different with tuna and I'm glad I tried this.  I really liked it and my son devoured them.  I served over a bed of rice, a light sauce would have really complimented them, but still very good on their own.

I usually try to stick to recipe, but didn't have a potato, so I used instant mashed potatoes like someone else did.  I used 1/4 of a cup.  I didn't have an onion either, so I used 1 tablespoon mince onion.  Everything else I followed with recipe, and we loved these.  I made them a second time still had to use instant mashed potatoes because I didn't have potato.  I did use fresh onion, but we liked the minced better.  Tonight!! I am using a fresh potato:) So happy I finally have one to try.  We just love this recipe, so I know the fresh real potato will make it even better.  Enjoy! And try the minced onion because it is a time saver, and we like it better too.

I'm always looking for easy and nutritious lunch ideas that will feed me and my one-year old and this was perfect. Made it essentially as written and they turned out really good and held together fine throughout the entire process. I did drain the tuna really well and let the potato "steam dry" like the recipe says. Don't omit the potato because you'll miss out on what I think makes this recipe special. Without the potato you're just making regular old fish cakes. The potato mellows out the fish taste while leaving the cakes meaty, moist, and quite filling. I had mine on a bed of lettuce with homemade tartar sauce, and my one-year old had an entire cake himself. Next time I'll be a little less shy with the seasonings. Great recipe! Edit: Made these a second time and again they were excellent. This time used a heaping Tbsp of Dijon, a tsp of dry Adobo seasoning instead of the garlic powder and Italian seasoning, and added some dried dill and just a tiny sprinkling of the cayenne - tasted perfect!

This was a great change from the usual. I did sub 1/4 cup dried potato flakes for the whole potato and served with a great tartar sauce from this site along with some green beans from our garden. We really enjoyed these and will make again. Thanks so much for this recipe!

I like the general concept but they were not nearly spicy enough. I also think some parsley and green onions would have improved this recipe.

This was really yummy!! For the potato, I just added about 1/4 of instant potato flakes. I also added extra garlic powder, onion powder (not chopping onion), and omitted the cayenne pepper(but only because I forgot to tell you the truth). Also, my cans of tuna were only 5 oz each, so I added an extra can and about 1/3 cup bread crumbs, They came out great!! Thank you for giving me something else to make beside tuna casserole with all that tuna in my pantry!

Mine didn't come out quite like I'd hoped, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a great recipe. I omitted the breadcrumbs because I think my potato was much larger & so I didn't need the crumbs as a binding agent, but then my patties didn't have quite the texture I hoped for. I am sure they will next time -- and I will use this recipe again. I served this with AR's "Roasted Asparagus with Balsamic Vinegar" and a mixed greens/blue cheese/raspberry vinaigrette salad. (Husband dipped these in the vinegar sauce from the asparagus, for the record, and liked that.) Thank you for sharing!

while i wouldn't call these spicy, they were pretty good. i used up some leftover mashed potatoes instead of cooking up a new one, and i cooked them in garlic butter mixed with olive oil. i served them with a yogurt/cucumber sauce, and my 2-year-old granddaughter loved them!

Made as written, adding quite a bit more bread crumbs.  Whole family liked it, some more than others.

I've fried and baked these and I find baked is easier, about 25 minutes at 350 will do it. I have a generally hard time frying fish cakes without them falling apart a bit. This is a good choice if someone in your family is not a big fish fan, it is the chicken of the sea after all.

This was tasty.  I added green onions that I needed to use- otherwise made as written. I was surprised at how easy this was and how tasty.  Believe it or not my kiddos ate this.  I told them that is was crab cakes (sneaky- for sure) and then revealed it was tuna when they were all done. LOVED the addtion of the potato!

This is easily one of the best lunch dishes I've every made. I like most my food a bit spicier than most people I know, so I added a bit of crushed red pepper and upped the cayenne just a bit. I also minced half a jalapeno pepper and threw it into the mix. I then formed the patties slightly larger and flatter to be more appropriate for a sandwich. Once the cooking was done I toasted some Italian bread, added the patty, spread some mayo mixed with a bit of sriracha sauce on top, and then added a bit of iceberg lettuce to finish it off. I am usually very critical of my creations, but I can say with great confidence that this sandwich is easily restaurant quality and one of the tastiest things I've ever made.

I made this for dinner tonight and they turned out so good and were very easy to make.  I am very tired and wanted something quick and easy and this recipe caught my eye. I accidentally used Mayo and accidentally forgot the egg (I am tired ,remember? LoL) ...added a dash of hot sauce because I LOVE spiciness.  Being from Maryland of course I had to add Old Bay and I feel like that pulled it together perfectly and really just made it taste like a crabcake which is awesome since my husband is not a fan of Tuna.  I will be making these again. We both have satisfied bellies and tastebuds. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great last minute recipe, I too made some alterations, just using what I have on hand.  I made up some quick potato pearls, and, finding no bread in the house just used some cheese crackers.  We also made up a quick lemon aioli sauce, thanks to the reviewer that posted that!  We have 6 children and they love the cakes.  Oh, I also used a Large cookie scoop to just drop cakes onto skillet and flattened them a litte.  5 stars for a kid pleaser!  If you are not a 'spicy' lover just tone down the cayenne a little.  :D

We liked the flavor of these, but didn't really care for the texture.  I followed Raquel's advice and added dill and hot sauce to the mixture and that really made the flavor of these fantastic.  Also, I discovered I was out of Dijon mustard, so I used stone-ground horseradish mustard instead.  In addition to the small amount of bread crumbs inside the patties, I breaded the outside with bread crumbs to help get a crispy coating on the patties.  I had a bit of a problem with the cakes falling apart when I tried to flip them and the finished product was a little mushy.  I definitely want to try these again, adding a little "something" to help with the texture.  I served these with "Dill Sauce" from here on AllRecipes, buttered green peas, and "Tomato Bread", also from here on AllRecipes.

This recipe was awesome. I cut the recipe in half because I thought I would be the only one eating them. Once I gave my daughter and her mother a taste they were all over them. Seeing as I hate mayo the potato was the perfect binding agent and gave the cakes a very flavorful taste as well. I'll be making these a whole lot in the future. Thanks.

I used my last egg this afternoon, and this was on the menu for supper tonight but I went ahead anyways.  I used about an egg size of light mayo, and just hoped that would help bind it.  I also didnt have cayenne pepper but I had some cajun.  Overall, I thought these were pretty good.  My husband really liked them.  I figured I would like them because sometimes when  I am trying to eat ligther, I top my baked potatoe with tuna and no-fat ranch.  I topped this cake with ranch as well since I was already putting it on my salad.  Will keep this recipe in the rotation for fish night which is on a 3 or 4 month cycle now, so we shouldn't tire of them too fast.  Thank you for sharing.

I made these tonight for supper. Here in southeast Louisiana, we make crabcakes a lot. I did not think these would be this good. Next time I want to top them with a creamy sauce. Thanks for a great new way to cook tuna.

I've never put potato in this type of recipe before.  I like it.  I used mackerel instead of tuna and upped the onion and red pepper.  It gives then a nice kick.  Next time I will use more mustard.  One tip, if you have trouble flipping them, they are too thin.  I tried making them like a potato pancake.  That didn't work well.  Once I started making them thicker and let each side cook closer to 4 minutes, it was no problem.

Great! - this gets 5 stars for the ease and method. I do see there are a few people who just don't care for the tuna potato mix... this is still a great balanced recipe - I think for those who just can't like the tuna potato mix, try replacing with croutons...crushed, but not into powder! you can also try cooked cold egg noodles (I like egg noodles) if you think about the way you would like these to taste, then try it!! I noticed some people had a problem frying too.. falling apart.  This is common for nearly every single fish/seafoud type cake on the planet.  I generally form my patties, make sure they're thoroughly chilled and carefully fry, or I give them a really good spray with olive oil spray (can brush it on too) and pop them under the broiler (lower rack) This is a good idea, and easy and the really good part... cost effective! Thanks for the recipe!!!

Delicious! I used canned salmon instead of tuna and didn't have any Italian seasoning but they still came out great. I also found you need more oil when frying or else the patties break apart easily. Went great with mashed potatoes (since you mash one anyway) and creamed spinach. Will definitely be making this again!

Very good! The whole family liked it. I do wish it had a little more tuna flavor, but I loved the texture of the potato with the fish. I imagine you could substitute cooked, chopped chicken or other meats for the fish. 
I did make a few changes. I used minced garlic instead of powder and sweet and spicy garlic festival mustard instead of dijon. I also omitted the cayenne because my 2 year old is sensitive to spicy foods. For the adults, I served it with a miracle whip, mustard, and hot sauce dipping sauce.

I loved this recipe. We are on a low cholesterol diet and I was looking to jazz up our menu. My daughter loved this because it took the fish taste away, my husband liked it but he told me there was nothing wrong with my orignal tuna patties recipe. I served it with a lime and tabasco mayo along side it. Will make this again!

This was very yummy! I substituted onion powder for onion and added some Old Bay for some kick.  Had no problem with them falling apart. My 7 year old formed the patties for me and they stayed together nicely.  I think i added a little bit more bread crumbs though. Very tasty, will be adding to our rotation of faves!

I was looking for a way to use leftover mashed potatoes for lunch.  Boy, did this fit the bill.  I, too, used albacore tuna; but even though I left out the egg (I only made a single serving), the cakes came out perfect.  Next time I serve mashed potatoes with dinner I'll be sure to make extras so that I can make these again.  Thanks, Raquel.

This was excellent and easy to make. Its a great option to have in any recipe box! The potato added a great texture to the cakes, great idea to incorporate it in this recipe!...  My husband made a sriracha mayo to go with these for an extra kick, and it was great for an extra kick!

These were edible, but barely. They didn't hold together at all when flipping in the pan, and the texture wasn't great. The taste was essentially bland something with a hint of cayenne pepper.

They fell apart like crazy and trying to turn them over in the frying pan was a disaster!  Using one tablespoon of olive oil wasn't nearly enough -- I ended up using a total of three tablespoons! .

I made these as-is for dinner last night. They were really good, but they seem like they were missing something. Not quite sure what though. My dad LOVED them. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe. :)

Wow this was really good. Added 1T mayo and  generous amount of Old Bay Seasoning, I am in Maryland after all. Fried 5 with olive oil and baked 5 on parchment paper 350 for 20-25 min as someone else said. Sprinkle some paprika and Franks hot sauce on top.

These were great!!  The family loved them.  I used 2 potatoes and swapped out cayenne with Chef Paul's fish seasoning.  I also made a point to not squeeze out all of the juice from the Tuna to try to retain the moisture.

These tuna cakes were good, my family agreed they are in the "do-over" category, but we all think they need more of a kick, more onion and perhaps some finely diced celery and perhaps some hot sauce.

Excellent. The flavors were great, and who would have known that one mashed potato would do so much magic.
I did prep these a couple hours early, added some dill and took them out about 1/2 hour before cooking.
The only negative point is 1 tablespoon of olive oil, is NOT going to cook these. I added a couple tablespoons of olive oil and some butter. Delicious. Next time I may add some crunch with some sweet peppers. Thank You for Sharing.

I did make some changes based on some of the reviews here and with those changes....DELICIOUS! To the 3 cans of tuna I used (my husband likes to eat haha) I took the dry instant potato flake idea from 
Lindseye117 which worked great; no added moisture. Used crushed cheese crackers in place of the breadcrumbs, two eggs, minced some fresh onion and celery (didn't want to waste my celery, it was getting old), dried parsley, used OLD BAY seasoning in place of the italian seasoning. Didn't use cayenne pepper because my daughter doesn't like spicy things. Next time I think more OLD BAY is called for, but otherwise these were great! They did not fall apart either. Served them with Tartar Sauce I from this site, cheesy rice, and mixed baby vegetables. This will DEFINITELY make an appearance for dinner again SOON!

I wanted to like this recipe because I usually enjoy fish cakes but these are lacking....something. I found them to be bland and a tad mushy inside, I even gave them some extra time to crisp and firm up properly. I'm not sure where I went wrong, perhaps it has something to do with the texture of my mashed potatoes? The seasoning definitely needs to be bumped up, imo.

An awesome recipe, which can also be considered the poor man's spicy crab cakes. It was super easy to prepare and was a huge hit for my wife and I. I followed the recipe however we both found there was just a tad too much cayenne, which we will tone down the next time we do this dish. Otherwise it is an excellent recipe, quick preparation time and delicious outcome. Thank you.

totally takes the flavor out of the tuna for those who don't like tuna. I served it to my boyfriend who hates tuna and I just said they were fish cakes. he had no idea and when I told him he did not believe me and had to look in the trash to see the empty tuna cans. 

I made a Chipotle sauce to put on top as well

Spicy Tuna Fish Cakes Haiku: "Wet & fell apart. The flavor also fell flat. Doubt I'd make again." For the trouble of making these, we weren't blown away w/ the final result. They fell apart when flipped and were too squishy on the inside; the cakes just didn't crisp enough, and I followed the recipe as it was written. And the spicy factor didn't wow either, so I dipped mine in ketchup mixed w/ Sriracha.

Really yummy! Bake your potato in the microwave instead.... much faster! We only reduced the amount of cayenne by a little  since we have little kids but I think it would have been great with what the recipe called for.  It did also require more olive oil. Will make again with a lemon aioli sauce!

I am always trying to find new things to do with Tunafish (love sandwichs and casserole but need to change things up a bit!).  My family and I really enjoyed this recipe!  I used italian tuna packed in oil and I add a sriracha mayonnaise.  Next time I may try and bake them to see if there is a difference.

Quick, easy, & delicious. I have not made tuna cakes before with mashed potato, but these turned out perfectly. I made the following changes: two small potatoes, 1/2 tsp. onion powder, 1-1/2 tsp. dry mustard, 2 Tbsp. bread crumbs, 1 Tbsp. minced garlic. I followed the recipe otherwise. I used a large cookie scoop to make 12 equal patties. I baked them at 350F for 25 minutes, turning them over after 15 minutes. I served with fresh lemon juice and lemon aioli. If you are having trouble with the patties falling apart, be sure to drain the tuna well and you can put the potatoes back on the stove after draining for a few seconds to evaporate all the excess moisture out. Thanks Raquel.

These were good but make sure to make them small to get the amount the recipe calls for. Also, make sure to leave them for amount of time that is called for so they brown.

I made this before with tuna and it was fantastic, and craved it today, but only had crab meat, so i subbed it in. I accidentally put a tbsp of cayenne in because i wasn't paying attention, the recipe was just as good.. albeit spicy! ... delish!

This recipe was very good, but it needed a lot more spices. I didn't mind this, I added much more than what was suggested, along with some steak seasoning and all purpose seasoning. The cakes held together great and were delicious alongside roasted asparagus and mushrooms.

Thought these were very good!  I cut back a little on the cayenne because the kids were eating them but followed everything else.  I wonder if those who mentioned they were mushy perhaps made them more thick than I did...mine weren't mushy at all but I can see how they might be if you didn't flatten them somewhat.  I served with homemade tartar sauce.  I preferred these over salmon patties.  Definitely a nice change of pace.  Thanks for sharing!

I liked them, they just seemed to me to be missing something. My wife liked them better than me and she is not a tuna fan so maybe I don't know what I am talking about. I will make them again.

Very good. I make a similar tuna fritter using Bisquik and evaporated milk instead of the potato. This is an interesting and delicious variation. I always serve mine with a cheese sauce -- béchamel with grated cheddar if I'm feeling ambitious, a can or two of Campbell's Cheddar cheese soup if I'm not. The addition of a bit of cayenne is brilliant.

I probably dumped a ton more spices in than the recipe called for, because that's just how I am.  My husband loved it too!
Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I loved these!  A great way to perk up regular old tuna fish.  The olny thing I would change is I'd use 2 eggs instead of one.  They tended to fall apart the next day. Yummy!

These were phenomenal! My crew hates canned tuna but they gobbled these down. This is one recipe that will definitely be going into the rotation. I knocked about 15 minutes off my cook time by microwaving my potato. Works just as well.

i think this is just great. extremely tasty, and a quick meal that's super filling. i didnt have cayenne, in fact, i live in china so i'm very limited! i used some chinese dried hot pepper and it was awesome. tuna was the only thing available around me, so im glad i found this recipe. the dijon mustard i subbed for some peppercorn mustard, and hardly used any oil to fry the patties. do-able even abroad to kick the comfort food craving. thanks a lot for the idea!

This was pretty good!  I follwed the basic recipe and made a few additions.  I cut back the cayenne pepper to about 1/8 tsp and then I added 1/2 a finely chopped jalepeno pepper.  I added a 3 Tbsp of finely chopped red pepper and 3Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro.  Excellent!!

these were ok. I actually think they could use a little more spice to them because i found them to be a little bland. Maybe i used a little too many potatoes which is why they turned out (flavor wise) the way they did

We're in the middle of a Whole30 month so we tried these with Almond Flour instead of bread crumbs. They turned out pretty good! I didn't add enough salt though and they were a bit lacking, then we added bit of Inglehoffer thick and creamy horseradish on top and OOOOH WHEEE! That hit the spot! a litte extra salt and garlic powder on top helped too. :)  Next time I'll make a triple or quadruple batch and freeze a bunch for lazy meal nights.

i really enjoyed this recipe  which I made as directed  It is suggested to be served with mayonnaise or hot sauce. I thought the hot sauce would work better so I tried a little on a small piece of the fish cake. I discovered it was unnecessary. The result of following  the  spicy tuna fish cake recipe had just the right amount of tangy spice. I will be making this again ,and suggest you do too.

My family liked the taste however I was not able to keep them in a patty shape (they broke apart). I only used 3 cans of tuna and I substituted the Dijon mustard with regular mustard. Perhaps next time I will use fresh bread crumbs and then maybe they will hold their shape.

If you are using Italian Bread Crumbs, don't add the Italian dressing too.

I wanted this to be great, but it seemed so dry. Weirdly, they were dry and crumbly and falling apart in the pan. So, I added more bread crumbs and they seemed to hold together a bit better. The flavor wasn't really there, either. I didn't want to oversalt them. Next time, I will modify and add maybe some grated carrot, minced celery, dill, and lemon.

Giving this 5 stars --- because of the minor changes that I made.
I used Albacore Tuna, and only used 3 cans bc it's meatier than regular tuna.
I sauteed the onion with the Italian seasoning until the onion was tender.
Also, I microwaved the potato in a mcrwv-safe bowl for 5 mins! (Perfect!)
Lastly, I felt that I needed more olive oil to cook the patties, but in the end, all was very good!  I will make them again!

I will definitely make this again!  I made it just as the recipe called for, except I did use 3 cloves of fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  Everyone loved them.  Served them on a bed of spinach with some fresh lemon squeezed on the top of the spinach and tuna cake.  Did chill for about 20 minutes as other reviewers suggested.  That did make it easier to roll into patties.

We liked them as a different meal. But, I cooked them in 2 batches  in a small skillet.  Bad Move!!  By the time I got  to the 2nd batch, the cakes were somewhat dried out, so they broke apart.  Next time, I will use a bigger skillet or add a bit of water to the 2nd batch.  My hubby enjoyed his as is, while I made a sriracha mayo to go with them.   Will make them again!!

I've made these spicy tuna fish cakes many times now and always followed the directions as written. They are very, very good. I like that I have most of the ingredients on hand making them inexpensive to make. They have just the amount of "kick" we like with the cayenne pepper. 
Thank you for sharing recipe.

Definitely will make again, though I think that there was a bit of an issue binding it all together, so it made the cakes hard to flip without breaking. Otherwise, delicious!

Good simple recipe. Would recommend a sauce though, perhaps a hollandaise or remoulade. They’re a little on the dry side otherwise. But good flavor!

Decent enough. It does have a nice spice to it. Open for other possibilities for more or less heat. I used salmon as that’s what I had on hand and therefore didn’t  have to make a trip to the store. Per someone else’s review I used pandora bread crumbs as I had  that on hand as well. I really didn’t want to go to the store for just a potato. I did find this to be on the dry side. Could it be the salmon or the lanky? I don’t know, but I will make these again and do it per exact recipe instructions to compare the two.

Excellent. To make this even cheaper, I doubled everything but the tuna. I also threw in some ground veggies I had left over 
from juicing vegetables. My family really enjoyed these patties.

I absolutely hated these ... but to my horror, the hubs really liked them (hence the rating).  The texture was just gross.  One thing I can say for sure is the potato is essential (thankfully I used two large), it was the only thing that made them edible to me.  But like I said, my hubs slathered them in hot sauce and called them "poor man crab cakes" and even had seconds!

I somehow overlooked the egg which would explain why they didn't hold together as well as I would've liked. I used green onion instead of regular onion in them and some prepared whole grain mustard (I was out of Dijon), and After tasting I added another 1/8 tsp of cayenne (this surprised me because in most recipes I cut back the cayenne if anything). wonderful flavor. That reviewer that complained about the texture I have to disagree with. I thought they were great in spite of a few of them coming apart (which was my fault).

Very good. I followed the recipe more or less. I didn’t mix the breadcrumbs in (I mixed up the ingredients in the morning so I would have a quicker prep time at dinner time and I didn’t want to bread crumbs to get soggy) I just formed the patties and then slapped some crumbs on them, fried them and served them with cheese on potato rolls. No complaints. No leftovers.

I'm always looking for ways to prepare canned tuna other than sandwiches and noodle casserole so was happily anticipating this recipe. These cakes turned out very good; although I didn't have any potatoes so I used some leftover Idahoan Instant Mashed Potatoes (Loaded).  Otherwise, I followed everything else exactly. It made too many for just me, so I shared with my neighbor (she made sandiwches out of them) and she is still raving about them. She even called her dad just to tell him about them. A+ on this recipe.

Did not care for these tuna cakes.  I felt they were missing something flavour wise, very blah even with a lemon aioli.  Maybe a tartar sauce would have been better.

Followed recipe exactly except I don't have Italian seasoning and used dried oregano, basil and fresh thyme.  Next time I will omit the fresh thyme - although my favorite herb it's too strong for this recipe.  Also used a 12oz can Solid White Tuna.  These were very good - my husband loved them and a simple meal with a stocked pantry .

I was quite pleased with the results. Cut the recipe to serve 2.
Used crushed up Hint of Lime Tostitos from the bottom of the bag. Instead of tartar sauce served them with some left over honey mustard. They were quite tasty. Have enough left to do it again.

The spice was just the right amount and the tuna patties were very good.  I felt like it was lacking something as far as flavor.  Will definitely make again but will add some fresh parsley or some other seasoning.  I felt it was almost perfect but still needed something.

Was okay right off the skillet - not so good the next day.  If you do not like cooked can tuna; you may not like these.

Had halved the recipe, but still used 1 egg.  Put in 2 shakes of cayenne pepper...wasn't hot at all, so could use perhaps a little more.  Forgot the Italian seasoning and the garlic powder, so sprinkled it on top.  It was a little dry ....had used Albacore, but served with creamed potatoes and carrots, it was not bad.  It tasted quite good, but next time want to make sure, I put the garlic...will use fresh and the Italian seasoning into it to make it even better.

These tuna fried cakes are really good! I did not have any onions, so I used onion powder instead. I got this suggestion from a previous review.  I did not have any olive oil, so I fried them in canola oil.  It doesn't need any cayenne pepper, in my opinion. I just wish I had a dipping sauce to go with it.  Not tarter sauce because I don't like it. However, it could use some kind of dipping sauce. I have to do some research in this area. This recipe is super easy! I'm glad I found a new way to eat my canned tuna.

I did not care for this recipe. I followed the recipe very closely, but they fell apart. I needed WAY more oil than the recipe called for, and the texture was very unappealing.

I used gluten free panko, 3 cloves garlic instead of garlic seasoning , added an extra egg because it was dry and Albacore 12 oz can . I wouldnt do as much garlic next time-too overpowering. Next round will be with regular tuna. Also need to make sure to make thinner patties unless you use more oil.  I didn't have any Italian seasoning so just left it out   We dont do onions so left that out too. DEFINITELY PUT IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR AT LEAST 30. Overall great recipe, my husband had seconds and he never does that!  Paired with steamed spinach and brown rice, healthy and yummy!!  Ty

The mix holds together great !!!  ( that's usually my problem with fish or crab xakes) I did find that the potatoe pretty much drowned out most of my flavor. Though I may have had a little bit more potatoe than the average as i had one medium potatoe & one small potatoe rather than 1 large ( and our version of large & small potatoes may differ) I did make some subs - horseradish sauce for the Dijon,  ginger & seseme seeds instead of the Italian seasonings I also added about 1/4 cup of ripe yellow bell pepper ( definitely recomend) and rolled oats in lew  of bread crumbs. I also found  I needed more oil to really fry  mine. On the positive side they fry up great & the ...batter/dough?  holds together very nicely.  I will totally make again but I will double and seasonings or sauces.

I followed the recipe as is except we only had sweet potatoes available.  The end result was delicious! It seemed a little fragile so next time I will add another egg so it holds better. This recipe is going into our dinner rotation.

Great! Thank you for the easy, quick recipe! We are a family that doesn't really like a strong canned tuna taste but this was polished off! I had made this once a long time ago yet my husband remembered how good they were and said " I can't wait to taste these.  I love these!"

Not very exciting flavor. More like slightly fishy potato cakes, without the smooth texture. They were okay when eaten with tartar sauce or ketchup.

It's been awhile since I flavored tuna with Italian flavors. I've forgotten how good that can be.  The potato in these cakes made for a really nice light texture and the touch of mustard and cayenne were spot on.  I made four big cakes instead of 8 smaller ones, and cooked them over medium-low heat so the big cakes wouldn't brown too much before the inside was cooked. Served with a simple sauce of half mayo half cocktail sauce which went really nicely with these. I loved these cakes and will make them often.

These are very nice I made them for hubbies lunch.  I put them on a burger bun with lettuce, tomato, and pickled jalapeños with a nice drizzle of sriracha

Great start, though next time I will at least double the mustard. Love the texture the potato provides. Second attempt with doubled mustard improved it, but think I'll notch up the cayenne next. If it's called spicy I want it to be that. Quick, easy meal I will make again...Update: double mustard and double cayenne did it - perfection!  Nice alone or with a creamy lemon-dill sauce.

I love this recipe. The thing I did change was I use 1 can of tuna and 3 talapia fillets cooked in butter and seasonings. I used a pitched more Italian seasoning and 2 tablespoons of Goya Italian Herbs Breadcrumbs. I do not add the cayenne pepper takes away from the overall taste.

I've actually never reviewed a recipe before, but these were delicious! I made some of my own adjustments, of course, but this was a great jumping off point. I used a yellow mustard because I was out of dijon, ground gluten free oats to make it GF, sweet potato, spring onions, fresh garlic & added a whole, fresh jalapeño to kick up the spice - yum! Thanks for sharing!

My family quite enjoyed this.  I didn't have time to cook the potato so used potato flakes as needed and I always use panko crumbs instead of breadcrumbs. It was quick to make and very tasty. Will make again.

Loved this! Fast and tasty. I was too lazy to make a potato so i used 1/4 cup instant mashed potatoes.  Also baked them as one reviewer mentioned.  The texture was divine.  Next time I'll try the George Foreman.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe is so tasty and so easy.  You don't get all the breading that some recipes call for.  I think I'll be doing this one instead of salmon patties from now on.  Tuna is a lot less expensive than salmon, too.

This was a winner! Everyone loved this recipe!  My daughter who doesn't eat tuna fish salad, asked me if I could make this more often.  The only thing I did differently was added more seasoning.  I did mistakenly add the tablespoon of oil (canola because I didn't have olive oil) to the mixture, but it didn't appear to make a difference.  I will definitely make this again!!!

I tried this today and it was great. I cheated a little though. I had some left over mashed potatoes in the fridge and they worked just fine. I have difficulty standing very long, but this was quick and easy and I will definitely be making it again. Next time I may try it with crab meat. Thanks for a super recipe.

Fabulous! I didn't have any potatoes on hand, so I just omitted it and increased the bread crumbs; I also used panko crumbs and added an extra egg. It was fantastic, my husband loved it also. Will be making again, thanks for the great recipe!

It was very good.  I did use minced garlic, the garlic powder I have in the pantry is too old, I have to replace it.  The minced garlic added to the flavor I think.  Quick, delicious, and different, great recipe.  A real keeper.

These are great if you have leftover mashed potatoes or sweet potato....I do a bit of a extra tweak each time and throw in extras like corn and herbs like chives...red onion chopped fine is great also. They're good baked in the oven with a drizzle of olive oil.

I love the concept, and was sort of faithful to the recipe, except that I halved alomost everything except the egg, (1 can tuna) used a green onion, added a teaspoon of diced chiles, and subbed mashed Triscuit crackers since I had no bread crumbs or saltines. Subbed frozen hashbrowns par-cooked for the boiled/mashed, and should have used a bit more than I did.  Added parmesan and a couple tblspns of finely grated cheddar.  Very tasty, browned up nicely, and I will definitely use this one again.

subbed prepared instant potatoes for time, subbed red pepper flakes since i didnt have cayenne pepper, used refrigerated garlic instead of powder, and dried diced onion instead of fresh. and butter to fry in instead of oil, all because i need to go shopping. the hubby liked them, ate with tartar sauce on top, i made a sandwich and out ketchup, since they reminded me of tater tots. the 2 yr old stuck them to the underside of the table. i'll make these again, they were good.

These were good, but I couldn't help changing a few things. I substituted crackers for bread crumbs, dill weed for Italian seasoning, and hot sauce for cayenne pepper. I also doubled the recipe and added one more can of tuna. It just didn't look fishy enough to me. Everyone loved them.

It was really good and I'll definitely be making it again. It was a little mushy and that may have been because I added mayonnaise. So I added about 2 tablespoons of flour and it was sturdier to fry. I'll probably add less mayonnaise next time. This recipe makes for a great lunch with Caesar salad.

We loved these. Didn't served with any sauce, just a squeeze of lemon. Followed recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. Thanks Raquel. This is a keeper for us!

Tried the recipe this evening.  It was okay and I probably won't make again.  I microwaved a large potato to save time and that worked out fine.  I think the flavor of the tuna got lost in the potato and other ingredients. Next time I will use samon.

Has potential. This is a very general recipe. "A potato, some tuna, some bread crumbs" aka results will very. At first I omitted the cayenne pepper but otherwise followed the recipe. I tasted it and thought it was bland and then tweaked it with more Dijon, garlic, green onions, etc I liked it before but others may have trouble. Using an ice cream scoop then pressing it down with the spatula once in the pan as someone else mentioned was helpful. Also, making sure you have adequate oil in the pan makes a big difference to give it that texture and crunch because otherwise its even more bland tasting. I added sweet chili sauce for dipping which really made it go from 3 stars to 4 in my book.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I did use Italian breadcrumbs instead of plain ones and a little more cayenne pepper for my liking :).  Next time I will use some sort of cream sauce too...but OMG these were yummy!

I thought this recipe was wonderful!  The potato worked well as a binder and I felt like it added moisture to the cakes.  I am going to make these again and use them as a patty for a tuna burger!!!  Thanks for the easy recipe!!

This was a great last minute pantry meal. I put a pureed jalapeno/mayonnaise sauce on ours(yummy). It definitely needs a sauce.

Rachel I loved this, i made it as written. Wasn't sure what Italian seasonings should be, so added Oregano. Will definitely make this again, might add green peppers and celery minced for extra texture. Thanks for sharing this.

Perfect light dinner, and even better leftover the next day for lunch!  I followed the recipe as written except I left out the onion entirely and also used quite a bit more olive oil than called for to get the nice browning.  Also, I microwaved then peeled and mashed the potato to save time.  I served these with fresh lemon squeezed over the top and a simple side salad.  My husband needed to add chipotle mayo to his but ate 3 patties and even my 18 month old ate a whole patty!  These are definitely going in my "recipes to keep" file.  Thanks, Raquel!

These were good, but nothing to write home about.  Not totally sold on the texture the mashed potato gives to the cake and didn't taste 'spicy' at all.  If you make 8 patties with this recipe, they must be pretty small; we only got 5.

This is a great recipe which you can play with.  The fundamentals are there : potato, breadcrumbs to soak up the water at the end, tuna or any fish, egg, onion, salt & pepper.  play with the other ingredients.  I fried these in the pan and they were perfect.  3-4 minutes on each side.  They turned out great.

The consistency of these fish cakes were good and for the most part did not break up in the pan as I turned or moved them.  Perhaps the mashed potatoes helped with that.
However, the flavor did not wow me like I anticipated.  I had some doubts as I put dijon mustard in the mix b/c I have never added that to any fish dish before nor am I crazy about it to begin with.  Maybe it was the dijon.  I certainly added the other spices as directed.  Sorry!  I am going back to my original tuna cakes recipe.

These were very good, except there was a little too much Italian seasoning for my taste -- seemed to overwhelm the flavor of the tuna.  I made six patties, not eight -- I think making eight would have resulted in way-too-small patties (however, I know they are not meant to be quarter-pound burger size).  I also added a few squeezes of fresh calamansi (no lemons on hand).  FYI - I experimented with freezing two of the patties with not-so-great results.... when they thawed, they were very soft and hard to handle without breaking apart (probably due to the mashed potato?).  Definitely making these again, but I will reduce the Italian seasoning to 1/2 teaspoon for personal preference.  Thanks for sharing!

My family enjoyed this dish.  We like spicy food, so I added a dash of tobasco and I would still say they weren't very spicy.  Still good though.

I made these following the recipe exactly, and they were just okay. Like gatorgurl, I felt like these lacked both flavor and texture. It mostly just tasted like tuna-flavored mashed potatoes with a little spicy kick (the cayenne added spiciness but no discernible flavor). I'm probably going to search for a different recipe for tuna cakes rather than try to modify this one to suit the tastes of my husband and myself.

We loved this recipe! I tried it out a couple weeks ago as I was looking for some new Lent recipes. My 1 year old daughter loved them! I did not add the cayenne pepper since my daughter would be eating them and they were still delicious. I used canned albacore as it's all I had in my pantry and they turned out great. I really couldn't even tell the potato was in there but I think it helped it stay moist and put together. We will definitely be making these again!

We had some fresh tuna baked seasoned with Mrs. Dash, not canned.  We did not care for the mashed potatoes in the recipe.  It gave it a mushy soft texture on the inside.  I unintentionally failed to add the cayenne pepper.  I am going to try recycle the leftovers, add an egg, crushed crackers, jalapenos, & grated cheese & re-fry in the olive oil.

Thumbs up from my husband and our 17 yr old son liked it so-so (but he ate 3 1/2 of them).  I had no fresh potatoes so I used a can of the peeled, white potatoes and it seemed to work out great and cut down on the prep time.  As a dipping type sauce I made some sour cream mixed with the italian seasonings and parsley flakes.  Thanks for submitting your recipe!

This would be way better without the potato.
My husband and I both agree. It takes away from the tuna flavor. I wanted a tuna cake not a potato cake. Will try again without the potato.

Yummy and easy !!!!!! I used saltines instead of bread crumbs too. And also used two 5 oz cans of albacore tuna and a 3 oz can of solid white, and it worked well! A sauce would be good too.

Great recipe! I added about 2 tbsp mayo for consistency and served with a gravy and added shredded cheddar cheese along with veggies!
