Loved that this recipe didn't have as many calories as regular pesto & was yummy! Even though olive oil is a good type of oil, it still has 119 Calories in just 1 TB! So I guess when you use a 1/2 cup or so of olive oil in regular pesto that is a lot of calories (& I love lots of pesto :) I used a touch of chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth & no additional salt. Not sure if I needed the broth or if it was the Ricotta in this recipe that made my Chicken & Pasta Pesto dinner taste better than usual! I served the Chicken Pasta Pesto w/ grilled red pepper strips on side. Easy & Nice! Everyone loved it, Thanks!

This is a simple recipe that is easy to put together and has wonderful flavor.  I used almonds instead of pine nuts, and didnâ€™t use any vegetable broth but did add a little lemon juice.

I really liked this pesto. I didn't have pine nuts, so I toasted some almonds and walnuts, and that worked great. I skipped the oil too, just added a little water to thin out the pesto a bit. The creaminess of the ricotta was nice too.

A really nice alternative to traditional oily basil pesto!  I used it on the 'Pesto Chicken' recipe (submitted to this site by PJaros), and it was lovely!

It was good, but a bit heavy on the garlic and we missed some of the oil. Next time, I'll cut back on the garlic and sub oil in for the vegetable broth. A great and easy pesto recipe!
