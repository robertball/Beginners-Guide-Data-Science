I have always loved chicken croquettes but found them cumbersome to prepare. This recipe was quite easy and very quick.

Instead of chicken, I substituted the leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. These were just delicious. The proof, however, came from the teen who returned for 2nds and 3rds. She is a very picky eater, so that was quite a compliment.

I always loved the storebought chicken croquets (the frozen ones)but then they disappeared from the stores... my husband was always checking and asking how to make them... so I found them on here and they sounded easy. They were easy and delicious! makes a little chicken go a long way! So yummy, thanks for a great recipe, hubby loved it:)

These were so delicious!  I had to improvise a bit, though.  I used leftover turkey and I didn't have any cream of chicken soup, so I used a little gravy instead!  Unfortunately I couldn't make the sauce, but did make a little dipping sauce to go along with them.  They were still really delicious!  I can't wait to try this recipe with chicken and soup next time!

Upon the reviews of many others here and for my own preferences, I changed this recipe quite a bit.  While the recipe is a good basic one to build on, I made the following changes:  I changed it to serve 4; made 2 cups of chicken gravy instead of using the soup, and refrigerated it to let it congeal a bit before adding a portion of it to the croquette mixture; sauteed the onion and celery before adding to the mixture; substituted panko crumbs; refrigerated the 8 oval patties/croquettes I made for several hours before dusting them with flour, dipping in egg/milk then coating in the crumbs (seasoned with a little poultry seasoning, kosher salt and pepper); I baked them at 375 degrees for 35 minutes.  I also added just a pinch of poultry seasoning to the gravy I made and served the croquettes with mashed potatoes and wax beans.

I have been searching for the recipe my Mom used when making Turkey Croquettes with leftovers after Thanksgiving.  This comes closest to it:) I added minced garlic and used butter, not shortening and added my leftover turkey gravy to the sauce. Add some leftover stuffing, and a mix of leftover mashed potatoes and mashed turnips and it is "comfort food" heaven:-)  What great memories it brings and will now be a New favorite for "after" Thanksgiving.

I made these with canned chicken and they were very very good.
Instead of making the sauce, I made creamed peas and new potates 
to serve with them.  A big hit!

These were terrific.  Used chicken breasts poached in broth.  Didn't have Italian bread crumbs so I added some sage and thyme to plain crumbs.  Browned croquettes in oil instead of shortening and kept warm in oven.  Added poaching broth to remaining soup for gravy instead of milk.  Next time I'll pre-cook the celery and onion.  Served with mashed potatoes, glazed carrots and peas.

I doubled the recipe to feed my family of 5.  It's best that you make them no larger than 3". Any bigger and they won't hold their shape as well.  This recipe is surprisingly good and I recommend it to everyone.

Overall this recipe is very easy, much easier than I anticipated croquettes to be. I have two gripes with the recipe though. First, there is no suggestion of using a NON-STICK skillet to brown the croquettes. It was really frustrating to take a large skillet, as directed, and when flipping the croquettes have the browned breading come right off sticking to the pan. After one turn I transferred them into a non-stick skillet and it worked much better. My second gripe is the amount of poultry seasoing in the croquettes. There is far too much for this amount of chicken, breadcrumbs etc. If I were to make this recipe again I would cut the 1/4 tsp of poultry seasoning that goes in the meat mixture to 1/8 tsp. Overall the textures of this was great but the over powering flavor of too much poultry seasoning ruined it for me. Maybe if I do make this agin with less seasoning it will turn out how I expected/wanted it to and I will be ableto come back and give it a higher rating but until then, I wouldn't recommend it :(

This is a great recipe for leftover chicken. I'll probably cook an extra chicken next time to be sure I have leftovers for this recipe. The only thing I'll do different next time is use my food processor to mince the chicken....duh! We enjoyed these with plenty of mashed potatoes.

I grew up on boxed Weaver's Chicken Croquettes, but can not find them anymore.  My kids had never had them so I decided to try this recipe, and they turned out so much better than the store bought.  I used butter in place of the shortening, just because I never use shortening.  I served it with mashed potatoes and it truly did take me back to my childhood.

I was completely winging it- made some changes and this turned out so good!  Used a package of ground chicken (because that's what I had)- cooked it with salt, pepper & poultry seasoning. In a bowl, mixed the cooked chicken, almost half the can of cream of chicken soup, breadcrumbs, touch of s&p, about 1/3 large onion cooked for a few minutes. Didn't have celery but if I did I would have cooked it w/ onion too.  Had chive cream cheese so cut into blocks and wrapped the chicken mixture around each block and molded into a large meatball shape. Refrigerated balls for about an hour. Rolled balls into bread crumbs right before cooking- tried one in the shortening and it fell apart (probably because these were very moist- will add a few more bread crumbs to the mix next time to hold shape but not so much to dry them out), then threw in the deep fryer at about 350 degrees- they cooked in about 3 minutes.  On stove, heated up the rest of the chicken soup, some milk, parmesean cheese, s&p, poultry seasoning, and some of the cream cheese until it was a yummy sauce.    My husband said they could be served in a restaurant!  Next time my only changes may be trying chopped cooked chicken breasts(although the ground chicken was easy and great too), may add some celery, add a slightly bigger chunk of the cream cheese in the center of balls (can't get enough cream cheese), and may try a little egg dip before I breadcrumb the outer ball.

Really good. Used leftover roasted chicked. Didn't have poultry seasoning so used lemon pepper, some salt, and more pepper. Also used cream of celery since that's what I had. Added shredded  white chedder cheese to mixture. Put patties in freezer for about 15 minutes since I was short on time. Then floured and pan fried. Used a white sauce melted  with a little more chedder cheese and poured on top of patties. Patties held together and were a hit. Will make again.

Here's the deal....we made a rotisserie chicken and had leftovers.  Hubby was craving chicken croquettes, and we found this recipe.  Sounded yummy to both of us.  We decided to use cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of chicken.  Hubs said....I wanna make 'em.  Hey, go for it!!  Well, he read the recipe, but not the instructions.  He added the entire can of soup and the milk to the chicken mixture.  Trying to salvage the "goop" he made, we refridgerated it for about an hour, shaped into large patties, breaded, and baked them in the oven.  Despite not having any sauce to put over them, they were really delicious.  I did carefully turn them once the bottoms were browned to get the other side crunchy.  So....this is a VERY forgiving recipe, and really very good.  Can't wait to make them the right way next time!!!

Everything just tasted like poultry seasoning to me.  It needs to be reduced significantly in my opinion and taken out of the gravy all together.  The croquettes needed salt and something else however I'm not sure what that else is.  They just weren't what I expected and weren't like I remember them growing up.

A realy foolproof recipe of a favorite comfort food. I amke double batches and bake for about 30-40 min at 350 till golder brown then freeze. only use 2/3 cup soup for making up chicken mix itself use remaining soup and adjust milk seasoning for gravy for the meal that night. when someone whants a snack or quick lunch/dinner pop 'em in the micro wave if you desire a sauce make a becaramel sauce add broth and seasoning.

Very good.  I minced up some red onions (that's what I had on hand), garlic as well as some red pepper.  Sauted those veggies with some EVOO (lightly).  Also had no breadcrumbs, substituted by grinding up some cracked pepper triscuits.  YUM!  Came out great.  Formed the patties, placed them in the fridge for only half an hour, rolled them in more triscuit crumbs and pan fried them with PAM.  Came out delish.  My 5 yr old didn't want anything fancy with them, just a hamburger bun, so well I followed and well it's different, but so delicious.

This was a wonderful, easy supper.  The taste was great and even better, my entire family enjoyed them.  I did improvise somewhat though.  I used an entire chicken deboned and shredded up.  I omitted the celery and added garlic (we love garlic!)  I ended up using the entire can of soup and 1 egg, which bound this together wonderfully.  I also added a little italian seasoning along with the poultry seasoning for a little more flavor.  Great recipe and I will be making this again.

This has to be the best chicken croquette recipe I have ever tried.  The fact that you can make them the same day as you make them instead of putting them in the fridge overnight makes it a lot better.  I would recommend this recipe to all my friends.  Today I made them with leftover turkey.

Wow...I was actually surprised at how good this was.  I really don't like things that have canned soup in them, but you couldn't tell this did.  I was a bit heavy handed with the poultry seasoning, but otherwise followed the directions exactly.   This is a great way to use leftover chicken.  Super easy, common ingredients, fast- I love it.

I've tried many different chicken croquette recipes and this was the best tasting and the easiest of them all. I will be saving this one. I don't like crunch so I substituted onion power and celery seed for actual onion and celery. I used the experience I had making these before and decided to add half a beaten egg to the mixture and a little additional bread crumbs to get the constancy right. I use the remaining egg plus another for use as an egg wash before coating the croquettes in bread crumbs. I also deep fried them for added flavor and because I felt it would be hard to cook them evenly as described in the recipe given their shape. I almost made them into patties to allow for even cooking but felt they just wouldn't be croquettes. They came out perfect. They held together just fine and had great flavor and that's what I was looking for in a good croquette recipe. Thank you for sharing!

My main complaint with these is the texture. They do not hold their shape and fall apart while cooking. Traditional croquettes are spherical - if you make patties you should call it a chicken BURGER. I was so happy to finally find this recipe, but it was a letdown. It was more like eating chicken MUSH.  You need to fine-tune this texture so they hold together well. I didn't care for the taste, but I blame myself on that as I used seasoned chicken, seasoned soup, and seasoned bread crumbs - so the flavors all overpowered each other. A nice idea, but not what I expected.  I'll keep looking for a decent croquette recipe.

I made this recipe using fresh ground chicken, had to cook longer but they are so good and my family requests them often, I had no issue in cooking them and I love poultry seasoning, so to me it's perfect.

My family thought the poultry seasoning was a little too much. I will make these again, (actually, my eight-year-old cooked tonight; he's a good cook) but will cut the poultry seasoning and maybe leave it out of the gravy all together.

These are very easy to make and good.   Will make them again.  I used turkey that I had leftover from my Sunday dinner.

Followed the recipe and no one in the family enjoyed them.  The poultry seasoning was overwhelming and they were dry.  Thanks for sharing but will not be trying again.

These were great!  I substituted a low-fat gravy I made instead of the soup.  Also, I briefly sauteed them in a combo of Smart Balance and canola oil and them popped them in the oven.  Served with the left-over gravy and brown rice.  Surprisingly, met everyone's taste!  Will definitely make again.

Five Stars !!  I deep fried them and they came out beautiful.  "GOLDEN"  Back in 1969 I was 14 and worked at a restaurant in NH that used the scrap chicken parts to make Croquettes.  They were delicious.  I was looking for this recipe because my husband is having dental work, (can't chew chicken).   So glad I found Cindy's recipe.  Never made them before, and I am very pleased.  The only change I made was dipping them in egg before crumbing.

I've never had croquettes before but have always been intrigued by the idea.  We thought they were great.  I used cream of chicken with herbs soup. I poached 2 smallish boneless breast halves in chicken stock and a little lemon juice with a couple sprigs of fresh rosemary, thyme, sage leaves, a bay leaf and a couple whole peppercorns. Removed the chicken and chopped very finely.  In a tsp of butter I lightly sauteed the onion, celery, a minced clove of garlic and poultry seasoning.  Mixed the chicken, soup, bread crumbs, onion-celery-garlic-poultry seasoning mixture all together and formed into 6 small patties about 1/2 thick.  Then into the fridge for an hour. Made the sauce with the remaining soup, half n half, and a little more poultry seasoning.  Pressed the patties into the italian bread crumbs and fried until browned over medium heat in 2 tablespoons butter with 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Served over garlic mashed red skinned potatoes.  At 3 a pc, my BF and I easily finished the entire single recipe. They were rich and filling.  Not a meal we'll have all the time, but certainly on the list for those nights when we need some real comfort food.

I have been looking for this forever.Came out just like the frozen ones only healthier. Even the gravy was the same. I would recommend doubling or tripling the recipe though!

Good comfort food. They lived up to their name by being easy to make. We didn't have any celery so I replaced it with fresh basil, also used olive oil to cook them instead of shortening. Prevailing flavor is cream of chicken soup. If you're not a fan, you probably won't like these, if you are then bon appetite!

My mother used to make these for me and I've been trying to figure out her recipe for years. This is SO close that it's just as good! I did make some changes based on what I had in the pantry: I used cream of celery soup and omitted the chopped celery, rotisserie seasoning instead of poultry seasoning, and I fried the croquettes in veggie oil instead of shortening. After frying, I baked them at 400F for 10 minutes, just to make them slightly crispy. SO GOOD! I tend to eat more vegetarian by choice, but this recipe made my "one meat a week". Thank you!

This one just didn't work for me. Don't know whether it was the Italian bread crumbs or the poultry seasoning, but the taste was intrusive. But the biggest problem was the the patties just fell apart when I tried to turn them.

I made this recipe for my family recently and it was amazing! I have had many chicken croquettes before both home made, store bought, and from restaurants, and these ones are defiantly the best I have ever had. The flavor is prefect, they are super easy to make, and the best thing about them is the texture. They are also super moist which I love! If your are unsure about making this recipe defiantly make it, you will not regret it at all. Just make sure you are measuring everything properly so they come out moist and delicious!

My mixture looked a little dry and I wanted to bake them, avoiding fried foods.  I added one beaten eggs.  Followed recipe to chill before cooking, but by mistake, I rolled them in the additional crumbs first.  I sprayed a shallow casserole pan with butter flavor Pam.  I placed croquettes in and lightly sprayed tops with Pam.  Baked thirty minutes at 350, flipping them over and again spraying lightly half way through.  They were wonderful.  I did need to thin the sauce with 1/4 cup of chicken broth.   We had them with mashed potatoes and peas.  Did them again with noodles.  Great!

Yum! We also doubled the recipe to feed our family of 5 (and got 13 small ovals from it)!  Like others, we sauteed some onion (about 3 tablespoons), and used way less poultry seasoning! Also, I used a stick of margarine in place of shortening, and fried it in that AND also baked them at 400* for about 15 minutes to decrease the sogginess of the insides! The gravy in the recipe was so yummy and such a nice flavor with the croquettes! Definitely will be making again soon!

Wow!   These were wonderful! I usually purchase mine from the Amish in Lancaster County, but these were so good, I'll be making them myself from now on!  The recipe only made 4 croquettes, so you will need to double the recipe if you want extra.  Thanks so much!

I went to the store last week in search of the old Weaver frozen chicken croquettes after my husband and I got a craving for them, but found out they are no longer made.  I immediately searched online and found this recipe. We tried them today and everyone LOVED them, including my 7 and 10 year old!  I did saute the onions and celery with some sazon and put those along w/ the chicken and 2 bouillon cubes into the food processor before adding the soup.  I also coated them before refrigerator and dredged in egg whites and coated again before frying.  They still fell apart when flipping.  That's the reason for the 4 stars.  We baked 2 of them to see the taste difference & to lighten them up.  While the 2 baked ones only had one coat of breadcrumbs the coating was a little "gummy."  Still very good and I will continue to tweak this until we get it just right!  Overall, I'd definitely recommend.

This is the good and quick way, but it's better if you make your own chicken cream sauce and use oven roasted chicken breasts seasoned with onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, nutmeg, then when the skin is crisped up, you eat it before you cut the chicken breasts up!!!!

In Holland where I was born, Croquettes were a common thing to enjoy. Adding soup, or gravy to the mix adds a lot of flavour--we also add all sorts of chopped veggies from onions to carrots and red bell peppers, which we pre-cook a bit before adding them. You can make them using any type of left over meat even ham, roast pork etc. and make veggie versions too! We also deep fry them and double bread them using a egg/milk mixture. Great stuff!

I used to buy the frozen chicken croquettes at the grocery store, but I can't find them anywhere now.  My husband's been asking for them, so I decided to see how difficult it would be to make them.  This recipe is so easy, and he loved them!!

I made this at the last minute with leftover rotisserie chicken.  Instead of the sauce in the recipe I made a mock hollandaise sauce with the rest of the cream of chicken soup, 1/4 cup mayonaisse (light), and about 2 tbls lemon juice.  Everyone loved it!!

Amazing! These were easy and delicious. My boyfriend wants us to have them once a week, haha.  Only thing I did differetly was use 1 tsp of onion powder in place of minced onion. Tasted just like the croquettes at our favorite diner. Great recipe, thanks! :-)

Very good - reminded me of my childhood!  Followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT that I used turkey instead of chicken (leftover from Thanksgiving).  In my opinion, you should double the recipe for the croquettes, but don't double the recipe for the sauce.  As the recipe reads, it makes way too much sauce (in my opinion.)

These are very good.  My mother-in-law makes chicken croquettes and these have passed the husband test.  One of my favorite uses for leftover chicken!

fun to make and tasty.  A tad bit on the salty side but we did enjoy them as late night movie snacks.

Didin't have fresh onion so I used dehydrated dry from the pantry and it worked just fine.  If you're not crazy about crunch, saute the celery a little bit first.  Otherwise, these are delish and a great way to get rid of that leftover chicken.  I served with mashed potatoes (cheated and used boxed) and leftover greenbeans.  Great meal for a cold Northwest Sunday afternoon!

I have always enjoyed chicken croquettes,but lately never able to find in the grocery store. These were a nice find. Of course I made them in the traditional triangle shape. But had a hard time coming up with six out of the recipe.  Next time might up the ingredients slightly. Overall a nice change to have for dinner.

I love to cook and try new recipes. My new husband is such a good guinea pig - he will try anything I fix. He loved these and said he definitely wanted them again. I would recommend doubling the recipe - a single one is just not enough.

I'm sorry, but this was awful. I followed the recipe except I used green onions instead of regular. The Croquettes were very, very dry. I'm so disappointed. I was looking for another recipe to use up leftover chicken. This wasn't it. My family and I all took one bite, and instantly disliked these. Sorry.

I omitted the celery and onion because I don't like either ingredient. I used my food processor to chop the chicken. My two year old liked them and my husband did too. he said they were very filling. which is funny cuz it's just chicken and spices dusted in crumbs. For freezing I made into patties and rolled in crumbs. Put one layer in container and put soup in ziptop baggie. I'll just thaw well and fry. (I used vegetable oil.)

These croquettes were excellent.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  I used left over grilled chicken breasts.  These were so good we didn't even need the sauce that is recommended.  I don't know if we're just big eaters but two were definitely not enough for each of us.  I will double the recipe next time.

Thank you, Cindy!  My Mother and I have always like chicken croquettes and always ordered them from different restaurants.  Both my Mother and I agree that we will NOT be ordering them anymore.  
We made them together for dinner with some mash potatoes and corn.  Thanks for the great recipe and for getting my Mother and I to bond some more!     Thanks again!

Very easy with ingredients I had on hand. I substituted roasted garlic flavored crumbs and mixed the canned soup with leftover roasted chicken gravy. Very tender croquettes. My husband ate all the leftover mashed potatoes with the sauce but I enjoyed the gravy over bread.

I made these with canned chicken - very quick and pretty good.  I didn't really care for the texture all that much, but it was probably the chicken.  My boyfriend loved them though, so I'll definitely make them again.

My family has been craving chicken croquettes since they disappeared from stores so I was anxious to try this. While overall they came out pretty good, they were a little bland. I made them twice, once with canned chicken and once with fresh sous vide cooked chicken. Both tasted similar so I would say fresh is not worth the extra effort.  The super simple gravy was dead on from what I remember.  I will be trying this again with my own modifications to give them a bit more flavor.

This was very easy to prepare and I made them as directed. I like the fact that it's mostly chicken and only a few breadcrumbs. It made 6 small patties and my husband, who can't eat too much in one sitting due to a medical condition, ate 4 of them. I put too much milk in the soup so I added a scoop of country gravy mix. It was great. I did saute the onions and celery as others suggested. It had just the right amount of poultry seasoning. These are much better than restaurant or frozen. The next time, I might add just a little minced red or green peppers cause I like that taste in them.

I thought this recipe was wonderful! Even my extremely picky kids loved them and asked for seconds. I didn't have celery so I had to exclude that part of the recipe but it didn't seem to make a difference in the taste. It was definitely easy to make. Also I used canned chicken...it probably would have been better if I used a chicken breast but I used what I had! All in all this was a great recipe and will be making them again!

Very good and simple recipe. I will be making it a lot since I have plenty of leftover turkey. The only thing I changed was to use cream of mushroom soup since it was what I had on hand.

I had not had chicken croquettes in years - but I used to love them! I did not use your exact measurements; I just kind of wanted a guide to remember exactly what to put in them. I would not have thought to use cream of chicken soup, but it worked quite nicely. I also didn't have poultry seasoning, so I used my own favorite "Thanksgiving blend"  - which is essentially the same thing. ;)
Thanks so much for sharing! These will be a new regular meal at our house!

These were SOOOOO good.  They taste even better then the frozen ones my mom used to make us...I think they were Weaver brand..  I followed the recipe with a couple of exceptions.  I sweated the celery & onion before adding to the recipe.  I also doubled the recipe...  I used seasoned panko breadcrumbs on the outside and fried them in the fryer instead of a pan.  So easy and soo GOOD!!! You should really try these!!

Easy to prepare and just what I wanted, but they were a little salty for my taste. Overall, this made something that is usually a big pain to prepare more convenient! Thanks!

I loved Chicken Croquettes from when I was a child.  This recipe is wonderful.  Easy to make and looks like I slaved over dinner!

My son loves the Croquettes that they serve at his preschool.  I thought I'd surprise him and make them at home.  The recipe was easy--made easier with precooked chicken, which I didn't have.  I did add 2 or more times the spices to these otherwise they seemed bland.  We liked them though we didn't love them.  Definitely worth trying but not sure that I'd make them again.

They were very good and my family loved them....we will be making them again.  Next time I may double the batch and freeze them for a fast dinner.  I used panko bread crumbs and they gave a nice crunch.

These were easy & yummy.  And my kids both ate them which is a huge plus in my book.  I used butter instead of shortening.  We found 6 croquettes a little skimpy but we had a ton of sauce left over so next time I plan to double the croquette part and reduce the sauce.

These were very good. I didn't have any celery so just omitted it. I did add some garlic and basil and fried them in margarine. I didn't realize I had ran out of oil.

I used a leftover roasted chicken and followed the recipe exactly.  We really did not care for this one.  Something was missing but I can't put my finger on it.  I through out what was left.  The idea is great though.

These were much better than other recipes I have tried. I too used Cream of Mushroom because it was all I had and it worked great. Just be sure to double or triple the recipe because they go fast. I can't wait to try it in a sandwich like another reviewer suggested.

Suprisingly very yummy! Honestly I wasn't expecting much, but I was looking for a recipe using my leftover chicken and the very few ingredients that I had in my pantry. I came across this recipe and made it for dinner tonight. I only had cream of mushroom soup, but it turned out great with it. Simple, fast, uses leftovers, yet tastes supringly great! All 5 picky kids loved it. What more can you ask for? This mom is very happy with this recipe.

5 stars all the way! This delicious.  My boyfriend usually has a relatively normal reaction to my cooking, but he was absolutely blown away and now I am expected to make these every week.  This was very easy to make and I could see how this would be very versatile by using different soups and seasonings.  I also tried it with turkey and it was equally delicious.  Try them on a sandwich too.  Yummy.

I tried it just a few minutes ago, I substituted cream of chicken for cream of mushroom, and I use a bit more chicken, and forgot to add more of the soup to the mixture, things kinda fell apart on two of them, but the flavors were amazing, I put it on a bed of rice, and it was a big hit, everyone loved em, I give it a five, because the only flaw was my own fault.

I thought these had a nice flavor and were good.  They were just a lot of work and did not wow me.  My husband said they were OK.  I guess we may be used to the ones at restaurants that are fried-sometimes you just can't get the same taste at home.  Recipe is good-just not a favorite.  Sorry-just my opinion.

Thanks for a great recipe.

Very tasty and easy to make.  This is a delicious way for us to use up leftover roast chicken. I made a thick white sauce instead of the soup and it worked great.  Thank you Cindy.

Excellent recipe. I tripled the recipe to have some to freeze. I used my food processor to mince meat, onion and celery. Transferred to bowl added soup (next time I’ll make my own...don’t typically like canned soup) poultry seasoning, bread crumbs and salt and pepper to taste. Made into patties for easier sautéing in a non stick Sauté pan using butter and EVOO. Placed on top of creamy mashed potatoes and served with creamed corn...definitely will be a monthly meal!

I loved these. I gave it four stars because it only made 4 very small croquettes. Thankfully I cooked too much chicken and I was able to double the recipe to make enough for dinner. I didnt have poultry seasoning so I used Adobe instead. I never made croquettes from scratch before, but will do it again and will use this recipe.

I've made this twice, the first time I couldn't find the poultry seasoning but made them without it. I made them again today but didn't have cream of chicken so I used cream of celery. Never made any gravy but they were great both times, but today was better because I had poultry seasoning. Just waiting for the family to eat.  They loved it the first time,  I think they will again.

I made this recipe last night for our dinner.  It was an easy recipe but I had an issue with the croquettes not holding together.  I had to add an egg which helped but didn't solve my problem.

I made two changes which were to use light cream flavored with Better Than Bouillon instead of canned soup and milk  (I don't like canned products) and to replace the shortening (yuck) with butter (olive oil is fine, too). Anyway, they were delicious and I loved the poultry seasoning in it as it gave the croquettes a little depth. The person complaining about the non stick pan issue must not have used enough grease or her pan isn't seasoned. I had no problem using my cast iron skillet.

my mother made these for years with leftover turkey.  So I was looking at recipes.  First, no Italian breadcrumbs or seasoning. I like the use of the soup, otherwise had to make white sauce.  I used leftover bread stuffing with turkey and can of soup in food processor to get my base. season to taste with salt/pepper and poultry seasoning.  rolled in flour, egg,  plain panko crumbs and refrigerated before cooking. Used air fryer, or you can pan fry.

This was really delicious. Ever since I tried one in a restaurant years ago, I'm so glad to find this recipe and made it. I don't care much for celery though.  And my sauce was more yellow than white on the picture.  I would make it again.

Easy to make. Solid "Diner" fare. Of course I served it with mash potatoes so I made extra sauce for those.

These are the croquettes of my childhood! They were ridiculously easy to make and tasted awesome.  I used a rotisserie chicken so the meat was flavorful and delicious.  I totally recommend these for a left overs quickie meal.  I will be making them again.

Excellent!  As a child, we would go to Strawbridge and Clothier in Philadelphia once a week for the chicken croquettes.  This recipe tastes just like them.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Really brings back great memories.  
I did add a little more chicken soup to croquette recipe and rolled them in bread crumbs before putting them in fridg.
Thanks again!!!

Nostalgic food reminiscent of visits to an old time restaurant.  Made my own white gravy with a little chicken bouillon in it for added flavor.  We loved this.  Uncooked patties freeze well and makes future dinners a snap.  Have made this several times and always delicious and a meal we look forward to.  Thank you!

Quick and easy.  Next time I'm leaving the celery and poultry seasoning out and I'll grind the  chicken a bit more.  Served with a side of mashed potatoes , yum!

I have made these numerous times over the last five years and they are always amazing. These chicken croquettes are very easy to make with simple ingredients. Their texture is slightly crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside. They are very well seasoned. I usually complete this comfort meal with mashed potatoes and string beans. Great to make on Fall and Winter days.

Made exactly as written, my husband said," Oh, wow, this one's a keeper!" Served with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies on the side. Will make again, no changes to this recipe, perfect as it gets, loved it!
