I loved this and it was simple. I used a tropical flavor jello. I left it in the fridge overnight and it separated into three layers. My toddler son loved it! Will make again for sure!

I thought this looked so delicious, but I must admit to have been very disappointed by the taste.  I didn't like it a bit - it had an unpleasant gritty strange texture.  My parents and friend both really enjoyed it though, so I would still recommend it if you like jello treats.  (Perhaps I would have liked it better had I used orange gelatin like it called for?  I used raspberry since I didn't have orange.)
