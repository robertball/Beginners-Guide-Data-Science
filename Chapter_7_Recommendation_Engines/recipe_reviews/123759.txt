1ST ATTEMPT: Bland but kidlets liked it this way! 2ND ATTEMPT: I used "Pizza Dough I" which is very similar to this recipe and used homemeade spaghetti sauce that was simmered down to pizza sauce consistency. Also, I added fresh pineapple pieces, Canadian Bacon, some bacon, some green bell pepper, thinnly sliced red onions, and a mixture of mozzarella cheese/provolone cheese. VERY TASTY WITH 2ND ATTEMPT BUT IS NOT AT ALL TRUE TO THE ORIGINAL RECIPE!!!

Love it! Love it! Love it! I used pizza dough II since I already had it thawed and easy pizza sauce III. I didn't measure the ham, I used 4 slices of ham, diced. This was fabulous! Of course, I love ham and pineapple pizza anyway, but this is sooooo much better than the pizza places make! The only thing I would do differently next time is add crushed red pepper to this, although jalapeno might be great too, but that's a personal preference. Thanks Gena, this IS great!

We found that Open Pit BQ sauce works as a fantastic sauce for Hawaiian Pizza.

Not recommended. I was looking forward to a very nice and easy pizza. The recipe calls for way too much flour so I added more water to it and the dough looked not bad. I followed the rest of the steps and I took out the pizza and the dough was disgusting way too much flour and it wasn't even cooked but the topping were great. I would recommend to put the dough in the oven before putting on the toppings but I haven't tried it but I won't try that recipe again. Delivery is still better.

I used Pineapple and bacon because I didn't have ham. Awesome. I love the juicy sweet pineapple taste with the salty crispy bacon taste. The best.

My husband introduced me to Hawaiian pizza when we were first dating and I loved it! When I make this at home, I use this recipe. except for the crust...I usually use my own recipe for that. Also, sometimes I'll sub canadian bacon for the ham, but it's great either way. This is always a hit with us! :)

Mmmmmm, better with a combo of cheese on this one. I had a par cooked pizza dough waiting to make this. I LOVE this type of pizza. Sweet, savory, salty, etc. I had leftover ham to use up and fresh pineapple. I tossed together a can of hunts tomatoes and some open pit bbq sauce for the base. This stuff just rocks and you can turn it up or down flavor-wise. I added some of my own twists (jalapenos) and I'm still munching on it as I write this. I make my own pizza crust with a la cloch (stoneware) and this is the BOMB!

We used leftover honey baked ham from Christmas and the pizza was so flavorful we didn't need to add any other flavor enhancers.

My family loved this!  The only issue that I had was that I had to make 2 batches of the dough in order to feed us.  I also made homemade sauce.  The kids were sooooo happy that it turned out, as were me and the hubby.

This was fantastic!  I used 1 Tbl. honey in the dough instead of sugar, and used Canadia bacon instead of ham (as restaurants do).  I used fresh pineapple instead of canned - made such a difference!  Thanks for the recipe!
