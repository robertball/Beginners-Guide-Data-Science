Made this for dinner last night and my husband and I loved it. I appreciate that Allrecipes has a calculate button as I used it on this recipe to take the 12 servings down to 6. I wanted some leftovers for lunches but didn't need 12 serving leftovers! The 2 changes I made (because it is what I had on hand) was my diced tomatoes had jalapenos in them and my cream cheese had chives in it. I think the jalapenos added a nice kick to the recipe but it didn't make it too spicy. I froze a container for our college son. This would be a great recipe to take to a large gathering as even half a recipe took the 3 qt. baking dish to bake. Will be making this one again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I love this recipe and have made it so many times I've lost track. I now add some ricotta cheese to give it a bit more creaminess but not too much. Delish!

We had a family gathering day last weekend in the local park and everyone came back for more most of all the young ones they ate it up. However I did make some minor changes to the recipe combined four of our favorite cheeses: sharp cheddar monterey jack colby jack and shredded Parmesan the cheesier the better for us. More hot sauce was needed as well for us. A little more cream cheese as well came out great and will do it again.

Very easy to make. I took this to a potluck at work and everyone enjoyed it. I agree with the previous post--add a little extra hot sauce for more flavor and I would also add a little extra cheese the next time.

Keep it simple...layer the macaroni add the shredded cheese drizzle with a mix of diced tomatoes and rotella do the same with the second layer....top with a solid layer of cheddar and american. The only ingredients..cheese mac and tomatoes(hit the tomatoes/rotella in the blender(stir). bake 35-45 minutes at 350...great!!!

Really good. I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned cut down on the ground pepper and salt and added more hot-sauce. I think the flavor from pepper/hot sauce and the paprika is just a little too strong so next time I'll be more careful with those. Otherwise it was good! Note: Used 3/4 box of pasta and baking time was 45- 50 minutes due to water from tomatoes.

Just reduce the black pepper to 1 teaspoon and fix the prep process and this is a magnificent dish. Perhaps the author goofed when posting 1 tbs. of pepper because that is waaaay too much. It's overpowering and you can't taste anything but heat. This dish was so beautiful and the ingredients seemed to be so spot on that I decided to give it another try with less pepper-- and I was right. There isn't a person I've served this to who hasn't asked me for the recipe or additional helpings to bring home with them. I don't measure the paprika; I just sprinkle whatever amount looks nice across the top. PREP CORRECTION: throw drained mac in a seperate bowl and then add butter cheddar & toms. Mix well. Pour that into prepared 13x9 casserole dish. Then pour liquid mixture from blender all over top of maccaroni mixture. Sprinkle entire top with paprika so it looks nice and even. YUM!
