I made half the recipe and added 1 tsp of grated fresh ginger and a little more cayenne to taste - the sauce needed a little something extra! I would definitely make this again.

My husband loved this.  I threw in part of a jalapeno which added even more heat.  Maybe cashews next time? There will definitely be a next time!

This was fantastic!!  I was worried about this being too salty, as I have done brining before, and even after rinsing it was still very salty.  This was PERFECT :)  Loved, loved, loved!

Great flavor but a little too spicy for my taste.  Next time I am going to double the amount of dressing but only use 1/8 tsp cayenne and serve it over romaine lettuce.

I made the recipe exactly as printed, but I think some directions are missing for this recipe.  Salad?  Other than the tiny bit of cilantro and the peppers I am not seeing the salad title.  I cooked my peppers and sauce in a different dish while cooking the shrimp as my husband didn't like the idea of  eating raw peppers with the shrimp.  We were happy with the outcome over all with this recipe, but it's a bit confusing on what is really going on here because of the title.  If you are suppose to put it over a bed of lettuce then the recipe should say so.  I will make it again using the method we did. We enjoyed the flavor very much.  I will try to buy raw shrimp next time without the shells as it's just my personal preference.
