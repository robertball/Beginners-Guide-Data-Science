I baked this loaf and shared it with friends at my church's weekly movie night recently, and it was a hit! It was very moist with only a hint of the many spices that were used in making this wonderful bread.

Made this for Recipe Group.  I only made 1/2 the recipe.  And  I made a few changes as I usually do. First, I live at high altitude, so I added 1 heaping tablespoon of flour. Also I substituted 3/4C  whole wheat flour for white flour.  After mixing all the ingredients, the batter was very thick, so I added 1/2 cup of apple cider, since I had some.  The thick batter really had to be addressed, so that's why 3 stars.  I made muffins, which took 26 minutes to bake.   The spice taste is stronger than the pumpkin.  A good muffin.  I don't know if I will make these again or not, but it was fun to try something new.

Really good, and my girls couldn't wait for them to bake!  I did make muffins for portability, and baked them for 35-40 minutes.  I had some pepitas and decided to top half the batch with them also.  Thanks, I love that these use no oil!

Made this for Recipe Group...I guess I'm in the minority here, but this was just ok for us. I made it exactly as written, but mine came out w/ quite a rubbery texture that we really didn't care for. The flavor was nice and spice-y, though. I also liked that this was a healthier version of pumpkin bread. This is something that I will most likely not make again, but I was glad to give it a try.

Recipe Group Selection:  22, September 2012 ~ This is a custom version of another Pumpkin 
Spice Bread that used to be on AR.  It is now located at TOH.  The difference being, this bread uses no oil.  I made a half batch of this as written and added oil to the other batch.  This texture is more rubbery and dry.  I made 3 different pumpkin breads in the same day, and did a taste test with a few different people, without telling them anything about any of the breads.  Sorry to report, this was the least favorite.

This was decent. DIdn't knock my socks off, but yummy. I liked that it didn't take oil but it was still nice and moist. I do agree with other reviewers that pumpkin wasn't the most prominent flavour. I didn't have most of the individual spices, so I used about 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice (for just one loaf).

Very dense but moist cake. I added 1/2 cup applesauce and nuts as my changes. Def. overpowering on the spices, maybe decrease by 1/2. I'm am sure it will be devoured up anyways as its not that bad. The spice is why I gave it 4 stars. It was done at 60 min.

Recipe group selection 9/22/12.  I had high hopes for this  but it's really just OK.  I felt there was far more sugar than we would enjoy, so I cut back to 3/4 cup each white and brown and it is plenty , but something seems to be missing, maybe ginger.  I made 12 muffins and 1 8" loaf.  The muffins tested done at 20 minutes, but could have baked for another 5 or so.  The loaf tested done at 35 minutes and started smelling burnt at 40, so I removed it from the oven, cooled it and wrapped for freezing, so we'll see.  I thought eliminating the oil would make this lighter than my usual recipe but this seems much denser.  Thanks for something new to try.

I made changes. I followed the recipe but added walnuts and sprinkled toffee bits on top the batter before baking. It's just how we like it. I think it had amazing flavor, I know my family went for seconds@

I reduced the quantity of some of the spices. It was still so over spiced that you could barely taste any pumpkin. That being said, it did smell wonderful while it was baking. I also thought the baking time was too long.

This is a hearty breakfast bread. I did adjust the spices a bit. I did 1tsp of nutmeg, added 1 tsp ginger(2 drops ginger essential oil), and 2 and a half tsp of cinnamon. Coating the pan with a generous amount of butter not only keeps it from sticking but adds a delicious crust.

I LOVE THIS BREAD, I USE ORANGE JUICE INSTEAD OF THE WATER, IF IT NEEDS MORE JUST ADD A LITTLE MORE, IT IS WONDERFUL AND SMELLS SO GOOD WHEN IT'S BAKING.

I wasn't a huge fan of this but my whole family was so Ill probably make this again just for them but maybe tweak it a bit.
