My family and I got together for dinner and we all tried the Voodoo Punch. It was a waste of good alcohol. It had a bad odor and the brown sugar was over whelming. Most of it went down the kitchen sink.  Thankfully we had wine.

I make the mix the night before and put it in bottles labeled Zombie blood. I then mix for a party, adding some gummy body parts and dry ice for effect, and everyone loved it! For the rum, try using a Demerara (like El Dorado) and it adds an additional depth of flavor.
