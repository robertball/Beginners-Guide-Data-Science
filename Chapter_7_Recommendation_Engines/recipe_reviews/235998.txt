I liked this recipe as a base - I tossed in a small/medium cucumber and used a cup of nonfat greek yogurt instead of ice (though I did still use a handful of crushed ice). I had no limes or lemons :( But I did have lime juice and added that, plus some sugar-free orange jello mix. Pretty tasty! Just make sure to put it in the freezer overnight so you can have it nice and firm for breakfast :P  The kiwis and citrus were really yummy together, and I'd recommend the cucumber for a refreshing undertone.

This is appropriately named because it is really sour, too much so for me.  I added a lot more honey and ice, but still didn’t reach that sweetness level that typically comes with perfectly-fresh fruit.  I think this is more like a “slushy” rather than a “smoothie,” and I really missed the traditional yogurt (either fresh or frozen) that typically makes it creamy.  The other thing that I wasn’t crazy about was peeling the citrus fruit which is a lot more time consuming than grabbing a handful of fruit to throw into the blender.  We all have different taste preferences, so I don’t want to discourage anybody from trying this, as it may be perfect for others.  I love smoothies, but there are many others on this site that I like better.
