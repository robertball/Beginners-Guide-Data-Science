I seriously wanted this to be as great as it sounded, but I thought, "hmm bread under sauce for 20+ minutes sound gloopey". I should have listened to my inner voice. My spaghetti sauce was delish, my homemade meatballs were delish--I should have served them BESIDE some garlic bread. I would cook & cut my garlic bread into bigger squares and serve them under the meatballs & sauce just no extra cooking step.

I decided to make this recipe because my son had been begging me for something with meatballs in it. My biggest concern was the bread coming out soggy (I see I'm not alone). I decided to remedy this by cooking the bread separately and then putting the crisp bread on the plate with the meatball sauce over the bread! It was a huge success!!! My son has a new favorite! Another option would be to dip the bread into the sauce.

Whole family loved it. Because of all of the people who complained in the reviews that the bread became soggy, I cooked the garlic bread twice.  Once as directed, then I cut it into bite sized pieces, and lowered the heat to 350 and let it cook again while the meatballs cooked (about 15-20 minutes).  I also only used one jar of sauce (trust me, it's plenty of sauce still).  Then I added an extra cup of cheese to the meatballs and sauce, stirred that in, poured the sauce over the bread bites, topped with the 2 cups of cheese and finished as directed.   Let sit 5 min, and *boom* instant family favorite.

This is a great idea! Thanks! I added more flavor by making homemade meatballs and sauce and I mixed up some mozzarella cheese with some garlic herb spread and spread that on the bread (I used a baguette from the bakery-not the frozen bread). Baked it until the cheese was bubbly and then I topped that with the meatballs and the sauce and some more mozzarella along with a little bit of italian bread crumbs and then baked until the cheese melted. It was really quick, easy and delicious! Thanks!

This was a quick and tasty meal. I am not sure how it will reheat as the bread was starting to get soggy, but overall very good. Next time I will add some peppers and onions. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made it as directed as it was pretty good. As some of the other reviewers wrote I was concerned a bout the bread becoming soggy and it did. I think next time I make it I will keep the bread on the side then spoon it over the bread at the table.

I made this tonight! Very good and easy.  I used my own meatballs that I made the night before.  I used ciabatta rolls instead of regular french garlic bread- crusty. So I baked it first , well done , so it could hold up well in the sauce. Thanks for the receipt!!!

Great base recipe and fine on it's own, but it sounded a little thin. I added onion, spinach, basil, oregano, thyme, and a little wine to give the sauce some depth. It ended up being nice and thick. It was a hit!

This one is a keeper. Only problem I had was the garlic bread got soggy, which is probably normal. :) Think I will make it again but maybe do it a little different by putting the meatballs in the bottom of the baking dish and the garlic bread on top.

It was way better than I was expecting! (Tasted pretty dang good.)

 I decided to use actual bread rather than the ready made garlic bread. I used some  bread that you get in the bakery from food lion, shredded it up into reasonably sized pieces, and drizzled melted butter over top. I was planning on sprinkling garlic powder over the butter but all I had was onion powder and that was great. I later heated the bread with aluminum foil over it and after it was sufficiently baked I continued with the recipe. 

Everybody loved it! I have to say, I wasn't so sure about the bread but it actually turned out amazing. Giving it four stars because I  did modify the recipe a little bit. I definitely recommend this for a simple dinner night! Enjoy.

Cubed and toasted regular French bread loaf with olive oil, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Proceed with recipe. Excellent for a week night meal.

Super Cheesy and YUMMY. My opinion with the Parm is to put it on after bake and to make that garlic bread super (crouton) hard so the sauce doesn't make it soggy.

Meh. This concept is great. But the bread got mushy. I'll try it again but put the bread on the outside of the casserole and the sauce, meatballs and cheese in the middle.   This way you'll get some soft and some crunchy pieces.

Excellent.   I halved the recipe.  Very easy to do.  I also made it vegetarian (not vegan).  I used Quorn "meatballs", Simple Truth tomato basill sauce , Julian's multigrain garlic bread.  Absolutely delicious!!!  Hubby went back for big seconds.  When I told him they weren't MEATballs, he  didn't know.

Family really enjoyed this.  We made it twice. Once exactly to the recipe and another time with some changes.  I found the original to be a bit too soggy for us.  We like sauce but not too much.  So I changed it around a bit the 2nd time we made it. We used Texas Toast instead of garlic bread and used 1 jar of sauce.  Will make this over and over again but with less sauce and Texas Toast! Thanks for a great recipe

This was good. The bread got a bit soggy, but I don’t think that affected my enjoyment of the dish. My recommendation is for the meatballs- the meatballs will NOT heat through from frozen in 20 minutes on a simmer. I let them simmer for like 40 minutes and they were still cold. Crank the heat up while simmering the meatballs and get the job done in probably even less than 20 minutes.

the flavor is great! we loved it. but we will cook our frozen bread longer next time that way it is crisper because once the sauce cooked on top of it about half of the bread became soggy and it was a hard texture to get past. lol! but other than that this was a hit!

Casserole itself turned out just like the pics looked. However bread was mushy.  Not a fan and I won’t be making again :(

Simple, and quick. Good for a "don't wanna cook night". But it's common sense, don't cook the bread with the meatballs and sauce. Cook the garlic bread separately then combine when you serve it, or you will end up will very nasty soggy bread.

I read the reviews and I did put the garlic bread on the side. It was good and I will make it again. It just needs some chopped veggies in my opinion or a different spaghetti sauce with the veggies in it... my 13 year old and my 52 year old children loved it.

Excellent casserole.  Save yourself from washing an extra pot.  Instead of bringing the sauce to a boil in a pot, just dump the frozen meatballs and sauce into your baking dish, add the cheese layers and bake an extra 10 minutes, 30-35 minutes.  Like others, cooked the garlic bread separately.  Yummy and easy.

The garlic bread was...weird. The crust was fine, but the rest f the bread was really soggy and it was a weird texture with the meatballs. I recommend just making the garlic bread separate and pouring the meatballs, sauce, and cheese over the top when you make your plate.

I would give this a 4 and a half just because I don’t think that the Parmesan adds anything to the dish. That’s just my opinion though.

I really liked this.  It was simple to make. Some are saying the bread gets soggy and some right under the sauce does. But most of the bread stays crispy.

As with many of the other reviews, the bread did adsorb the liquid from the sauce. However I decided to continue with the original recipe to form a complete opinion. I agree on using a baguette or just spooning the sauce over the garlic bread. This would take all the casserole out of the picture, but I see better results.

Made this as a quick supper while we were running around for the boys sports and everyone loved it.  It is quick, easy, and lots of compliments.  The Garlic bread makes all the difference. I was a couple slices short, so decided to substitute a couple of buns.  You could really tell the difference between the buns and garlic bread...follow the recipe and you will be pleased.

I liked the recipe because it was quick and easy to get in the oven, but I wouldn’t bake the dish with the bread in the casserole next time. Would definitely serve on the side. I used Gardien meatless meatballs and my homemade sauce.

I would recommend serving over the garlic bread without cooking them together because the bread became soggy.

I also cooked the bread separately and spooned the meatballs on top after. It was awesome!

My family and I really enjoyed it. I suggest that you cook the bread hard, not burnt. So, that when you add the sauce, it won't make it too soft.

So, it’s meatballs in spaghetti sauce.  It was super easy, quick and my kids loved it.  So, I call that a win!  

I did not add the bread and poured the meatball sauce on top of the bread separately.  Will definitely make it again on those I don’t feel like cooking nights.

While super tasty (I mean, how can you go wrong with cheese and meatballs), this recipe makes no sense to me. Baking the bread with the sauce would make it soggy and what’s the point of heating up the meatballs in the sauce if you’re going to bake everything anyway?

You have to make sure the garlic bread is nice and golden brown so it doesn’t get all sloppy under the sauce. No BS, I used a heat gun to shore things up a bit before letting it cool and tearing it up. Very tasty recipe as written. Super simple and quick.

I followed the recipe except cooked the bread longer and used half the sauce. The bread still came out soggy. I’m not sure I’ll make this again unless I sauce the meatballs and don’t add extra sauce to the casserole.

PROS: Easy to make, low cost, ready in under an hour. CONS: The garlic bread gets soggy, so this recipe would be great as a spaghetti alternative for kids. My 4 year old loved it. NOTES: I made this twice to give an informed decision.

I was glad I stumbled upon this recipe. I was making meatballs for meatball subs only to realize the buns had gotten moldy. I remembered seeing this recipe and tossed some frozen garlic bread in the oven. Like others suggested, I cooked the bread separately. But kept everything else the same. Turned out great!

Made the dish and bread sticks got soggy. I knew this was going to happen but didn't listen to myself. Next time will keep the bread sticks on the side.

Super simple to make. The bread gets a bit soggy and has a consistency issue my 4 year old picked up on and wouldn’t eat the bread. I think next time we’ll skip the casserole and just do sandwiches.

Okay so in all truth, I didn't really follow this recipe at all; I was just inspired by it! My creation came out perfectly though, and it was a big hit with my family. I made homemade meatballs (with Italian seasoning), simmered in marinara, and then spread across freshly baked bread with homemade garlic butter. 

I utilized a higher temperature and shorter cooking time (adding my cheese topping for only the final handful of minutes until golden). 425° for 20 mins. It turned out deliciously crispy all around the edges and on the bottom, no sogginess at all!

SO yummy and will definitely make it again!

Yum! Cooked the bread until it was quite toasty to offset the sogginess rom the sauce. Was delicious, kids loved it. I added some italian spices before baking. Also great with red pepper flakes. Someday will try with homemade sauce & meatballs, but as is it was fairly quick,good for a weeknight meal.

So thankful for this easy recipe. The only change made was serving the garlic bread on the side. I? came down with a nasty cold and was still able to cook for the family thanks to this simple dish and they all loved it. Perfect for a busy weekday meal.

Like other reviewers stated the bread did get soggy. Scraped the leftover meatballs, cheese, and sauce off the soggy bread and used them to make meatball subs using hoagie rolls. Delicious that way!

I made the recipe as written. It turned out okay. It was easy to make, and fairly quick. The issue I ran into (as many others did as well) was soggy bread. I like the idea someone had of putting the sauce and meatballs on the bread when serving instead of to bake. That might cut down on the sogginess. If we choose to make this again, I will try with that modification.

This was very easy to make. My family liked this and they do want me to make it again.  I did cut the recipe in half because did not want a lot left over after reading reviews about bread being soggy.  I did not have that problem. . This was good but next time I think I will cut the meatballs in half.   Makes a good meal for busy weeknights.

The idea and flavor of this were great, however in the future I would definitely make sure to really get that garlic bread super toasty and dried and also bake longer to prevent sogginess.

This is a quick, easy, and tasty dinner. The prep was not hard. The only change I made was using marinara instead of spaghetti sauce. Next time, if I have more time, I'll probably make my own sauce and meatballs. My family loved it!

Hubby loved it. Easy meal to make. I made 1/2 the serving size so I won't have to deal with soggy bread leftovers. Will definitely make again. Probably add zucchini and onions.

I made homemade sauce and meatballs. They were great. Disappointed that the bread did get soggy. Probably won't make it again...

I served it with the garlic bread on the side due to consistent soggy bread reviews. The boys loved it and I will make again.

I do wish that there was a way to combat the sogginess in the bread, but otherwise, this was awesome. We loved it.

I made this and it was a hit! I used crusty bread that I cut into uniform pieces to line my pan and followed the recipe as written. Yummy and I will make it again.

This recipe saved me when I needed something I could throw together quick with stuff I already had on hand in the freezer. Thank you. I made just the number of serving i needed by just using a serving of each item and putting them together and baking in small dishes. Very tasty, quick and easy. I didn't have enough garlic bread for my serving and threw in a hot dog bun torn up because I had planned to just put mine on a bun and it was still good. Would love to try with the jalapeño bagel. Yum!

Perhaps bagels would have been a better choice - as others have noted the bread got soggy on the bottom but it was OK and got 3 stars for ease of preparation and quick to prepare.  But in terms of leftovers I think only the meatballs and sauce will be usable which is OK - I'll serve on hoagie buns and discard the remaining (soggy) bread.
