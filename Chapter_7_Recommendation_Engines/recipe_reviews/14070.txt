I cooked over 400 of these for a festival recently and they were FABULOUS! I did make some changes, I did not use saltines, I made such a large quantity I did not want to crush all those. I used half whole wheat bread crumbs, half fine ground oatmeal. I used half mozzarella cheese and half medium cheddar cheese and up'd the spices. I baked on parchmont paper in the oven and they were splendid. There was not one left and they had the choice of some with meat! Thanks for the fab recipe!

These were disgusting.  One bite and straight into the trash.  Not even the dog would eat them.

I had these at a girlfriend's house and they were delicious!  I'm not a vegetarian but I honestly could not taste the difference.

Very unique, nutty flavor!  My boyfriend and I (new vegetarians) enjoyed them :)  I upped the garlic powder and used less crackers and more pecans.  I also chopped up a clove of real garlic, a tablespoon of finely chopped onions, a dash of red pepper, and one whole egg instead of egg substitute.

My children love this.  I use Ritz or chex cereal instead of crackers and egg, I also leave out the dried parsley.  If I don't make the rice before hand, the kids (and me) will eat them all before the rice is done.  Tasty with sweet and sour sauce

This was really good.  A vegetarian 6 year old helped me make this.  He crushed the pecans, saltines and helped collect the eggs.  I was very impressed how much he liked trying this new recipe.  We decided it would be good made a as "meatless loaf" adding some bread and putting a small layer of BBQ sauce on it before coming out of the oven.  This would probably change the baking time though.

These are so great!  My mom made them for me once because I am a vegetarian and I loved them.  I asked her for the recipe and have made these many more times.  I have also used different kinds of cheeses (Parmesan, Mozzerella) and used minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and these adjustments are also delicious.

My family, including my very picky vegetarian daughter, thought they were delicious. I will add a bit more spice next time. I ground the pecans to a powder, with some lumps, and rather than saltines I crushed a variety of crackers and some Cheerios. I was pleased with the texture
