Hey everyone, this recipe is my very favorite! Please understand that the clarified butter called for is easy to make, and also imperitive to the success of the instructions of this recipe. You can make clarified butter by melting twice the butter called for in the microwave, pop it in the fridge, and in about an hour (do this ahead of time), you can take it out, pull off the solid top, and you have clarified butter liquid in the cup. Remeasure for an accurate amount. If the recipe burned to fast before, or you had to bake after frying, give it another try. You won't be disappointed. Thanks a lot PGraff, you're a great cook!

HELPFUL TIPS NOT MENTIONED: I really don't see how the clarified butter makes or breaks this recipe as mentioned by several because I've taken the time to do it & my picky guests over the years could NEVER tell a difference.  I just use 1T unsalted butter, 1T olive oil.  I do know that this is always hands down the best dish I make and people can't stop eating even if they're "bird eaters."  I just use egg with a splash of milk to coat this (instead of butter) before adding the pecan breading because it sticks better.  I brown each side for 2 minutes, which is perfect, and then stick in the oven at 375 for 15 min.  This is always moist.  I use all of the butter stated for the sauce b/c this helps simmer down the taste of alcohol.  I use Jim Beam and on accident one time, I used a Rum.  Still edible though (thank goodness, considering this is what I use any time new guests come over).  This goes perfect with a strawberry salad and for the best dressing in the world, try the one on "Strawberry Romaine Salad I."  I've never tasted anything so perfect!

This recipe is just great. I use less butter in the sauce, about half, or I find it is too oily. Toasted almonds also work for the crust. To solve the problem of the chicken burning easily, I use a little butter and olive olive oil to increase the smoke point. When I brown both sides, about 2 minutes each, I use an old restaurant trick and finish the chicken in the oven at 350 degrees for about 15-20 minutes until done.

I am giving this four stars because I COULD NOT get the pecan/butter mixture to stick to the chicken.  Then it fell off and it also burned during cooking.  
The flavor is FANTASTIC and I am going to make again, but this time I will NOT mix butter into pecan and breadcrumbs and coat chicken with egg then roll in mixture.  Also, I will fry both sides and then bake until done.  Very tasty sauce!  Mmmmm!
UPDATED:  I changed to five stars with this version.  Do not add butter to pecan mixture, keep dry.  Dip chicken in egg and then roll in pecan mixture, will stick nicely.  Then bake in glass dish and pour sauce over.  Very tasty and a little healthier!!

This is my new favorite chicken dish! All the right tastes perfectly blended. A few suggestions- Ask your butcher to pound out the chicken a little for you- it cooks a little faster and more evenly. Keep a cookie sheet sprayed with nonstick cooking spray in a 350 oven so as you finish cooking each piece of chicken you can keep it warm while you finish cooking the other pieces because they won't all fit in one pan. I followed the directions exactly for the sauce but don't know why next time I couldn't just melt the butter seperately then stir it into the rest of the sauce. Enjoy and thanks PGraff for the recipe!

Wow! This was fantastic! And I did just about everything possible to screw it up. I was out of Dijon so used regular mustard. Was out of bourbon so used Scotch Whiskey. Was out of butter so used "tub" margarine. It still turned out wonderful! Flavorful juicy (not dry like most of my chicken dishes!) my family loved it. Suggestions: Make sure the pecans are chopped/ground very fine so they will stick. Make the sauce ahead of time (it seemed to increase in flavor when we reheated it later for leftovers). The pecan breading will burn quickly so try browning it very fast over high heat in a bit of vegetable oil just a couple of minutes per side then place on a cookie sheet (spray with Pam first) in a 350 oven for 15 minutes or so to finish cooking. I served it with a simple rice pilaf and steamed broccoli. This is a delicious dish quick and easy and a new family favorite. Sophisticated enough for company too!

I had to make several changes because 1) I don't like using white bread crumbs 2) the crumbs don't stick to a plain chicken breast 3) the cooking method caused the crumbs to brown more quickly than the chicken can cook and 4) the chicken was bland while the sauce was too strong and fatty. Here are my healthier changes: 1) season the chicken with salt & pepper reserve 1/3 C chicken and brown the rest in a skillet 2) process 1/3 C chicken & egg white with a little milk until mayo-like. Coat chicken with this mixture before coating with crumbs. Sounds gross but I learned this from Michel Richard's cookbook and you can't tell after it's cooked. Plus crumbs adhere to this much better than eggwash or buttermilk and its nearly fat free. 3) use homemade crumbs from whole wheat bread (medium sized for more crunchiness). No need to add butter to crumb mixture. 4) drizzle with EVOO and oven bake for 20 min 5) for sauce use 1/4 C heavy cream instead of 3/4 C butter. This mellows the strong taste of the sauce while cutting out a lot of fat.

This is similar to pecan-crusted chicken that I make all the time because it is frequently requested by family members. I pound chicken breasts thin and coat with buttermilk and then 50-50 ratio of bread crumbs and pecans (bread crumb mixture will get soggy so reserve some to the side for last couple of chicken breasts). Saute in approx. 2 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp olive oil (to keep butter from burning at high heat-quicker than clarifying butter). For the kids in my family I serve with honey dijon sauce (dijon mayo and honey) or ranch dressing. I also add a little paprika garlic powder and kosher salt to breading mixture. My husband hates nuts but loves this recipe-I just chop pecans really fine. Definitely 5 star!!!

This could be a meal I would buy at a fancy restaurant! I made this exactly as written and it was great. At first I thought I had burned the chicken when I turned it over but it was the brown sugar that had caramelized. I would venture to say that this is the best chicken recipe that I've found and I will be making this one again and again.

I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to rate this so I settled on four stars. The taste is very good and we enjoyed the meal immensely. However I do have some issues with the recipe. For one thing I cooked two large chicken breast but kept the sauce proportions the same as the original recipe. I ended up with enough sauce to drizzle a good amount over the chicken without smothering it and a little to drizzle over the mashed potatoes. But that was it. I am not sure how the same amount of sauce would serve 8 pieces of chicken. Another issue was that like a previous reviewer I also had problems getting the coating to stick to the chicken. I bought pecan pieces and then pulsed them in my food processor a few times so they were pretty fine. They were not however as fine as the bread crumbs. I don't know if this was the problem or what. I did brush the chicken with a little melted butter before coating but this did not seem to help. I might try baking the dish in the oven next time instead of frying and seeing how that works. Overall the meal was good but the recipe has a couple of problems and is a fairly involved process. Just a side note: to clarify butter easily just melt a stick in the microwave then let sit a few minutes. You can just spoon the fat off the top then pour the yellow liquid into a separte container. THis does not give you the pure clarified butter that straining will but it works fine for this recipe.

What a great recipe! This is now one of my all-time favorites from Allrecipes. Definitely impressive to serve to someone. I cannot wait to make this again and probably will have it again tomorrow. It was quick easy gourmet and most of the ingredients are already in your pantry. Went great with some whipped sweet potatoes. It also turned a cheap bottle of wine into a terrific bottle of wine because of the flavors of the sauce. Pounded my breasts thin and used a bit more pecans than called for. Also used an olive oil/butter mixture and finished off in the oven.

This recipe was awesome. I had family over and I'd never cooked for them before. Nor had I tried this recipe before. Needless to say it was spectaular. I did not bother with clarified butter at all. The only change I made was that I combined the bread crumbs and the pecans together in my food processor and hit grind. The result was a fine blended mixture of the two which was moist/damp. I then dredged the chicken in an egg & milk mixture. Not a simgle crumb fell off. I did however double the sauce. cant wait to have it again!

New Year's Eve dinner guests were pouring the sauce from the serving platter over their chicken while making sounds similar to Sally when she was eating with Harry. They gave a semi-standing ovation! I did all the prep work ahead and refrigerated the browned chicken so I could be with my guests. Don't know how I can ever top this one.

My husband and I have tried a few recipes from this site but this is the first one I've felt compelled to rate. We followed the recipe exactly which is unusual for me and I can't think of a thing I would change -- it was perfect! We served the chicken on top of mashed potatoes which also went wonderfully with the sauce. The next time we cook for company this will be on the menu.

This was so very good! I made a few slight changes upon reading some of the reviews. First I dipped the chicken in a egg white and milk mixture. Next time I will chop the nuts in a food processor-most of them stuck to the chicken but if the nuts had been chopped finer they would have stuck a bit better. I omitted the clarified butter I didn't even want to attempt that. I use olive oil which is healthier anyways and browned the chicken 5 min on each side. I then finished in the oven for 25-30 min on 350. I also did not use 3/4 cup of unsalted butter in the sauce-it seemed so much-I used 1/2 cup instead (still a great deal) and I thought the sauce was fabulous. It may have been richer had I used the full amount of butter but I thought it was just right. I used Jim Beam in the sauce and served steamed vegetables with the dish. My boyfriend loved it and I will definetely make this again.

this was very good. I used my coffee grinder to chop the pecans....makes them like a paste if you let it go too long so watch out. Anyway I didn't need the 2 TBS of melted butter when mixing the bread crumbs with the pecans. The coating sticks surprisingly well while cooking although I did need to add more butter when pan frying the chicken. The sauce is awesome! Like a zesty honey-mustard.

This was so good! It was definitely a restaurant type dish. I pounded my chicken breasts really thin for quicker cooking used a little extra bourbon less butter in the sauce and fried in a mix of oil/butter rather than the clarified butter just a little quicker I think. DELICIOUS! and definitelty worth it!

This is so delicious and yet so easy! The decadent sauce makes you feel like it's something that took hours to make. I seared the chicken for three minutes on each side until they were nicely browned and finished them up in the oven for 15 minutes at 350 degrees. I also halved the butter in the sauce as others suggested and it was excellent. I would serve this to company as well as just making for a night when we want to feel decadent by ourselves!

This was very good. I was supprised how moist and juicy the chicken turned out. I just browned it in the pan and finished it out in the oven. Then made my sauce in the pan. I thought the sauce was a little to overpowering. Next time I will use half the mustard half the soy sauce and increase the bourbon.

This recipe is absolutely incredible and was a BIG hit for a dinner party of 12!  Everyone loved it, including myself.

I have a few tips since I had these questions before preparing this recipe:  

Buy thin breasted chicken.  Use plain breadcrumbs, and purchase unsalted pecans.  I prepared the sauce the day before to make things easier.  

I dipped the chicken in egg yolk and pressed it into the pecan (finely ground in a processer) along with the bread mixture.  I was generous with this bread coating. I browned some butter in a pan and browned the chicken on both sides briefly.  I didn't "cook" it in the pan.  I then drizzed some sauce on a glass pan and placed the chicken over the sauce.  I also drizzled the sauce on top of the chicken and covered the chicken with foil and cooked until tender.  I don't think you can mess this recipe up.  I didn't bother trying to understand clarified butter, and added a teeny extra bourbon, etc. and it was awesome.

I combined this recipe with Garlic Mashed Potatoes (submitted by austad). The shredded romano cheese and fresh garlic was def. the secret.  I also made a broccoli dish wich had a million calories but I wouldn't have changed a thing.  I can't wait to make everythign again!  THANK SO MUCH!  FIVE *****!

This recipe was fantastic. Had no problem getting the pecan mixture to stick. Only change was to finish off the chicken in the oven. Fried only long enough to give the chicken a nice golden color. Than gave it twenty minutes at 375 degrees. Was very tender. Also didn't have dijon so used yellow mustard. Either way this was awesome. Eating it again tonight. Would be great for company. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a keeper. Definitely impressive - and better yet - most of the ingredients are common pantry items! I didn't use as much butter as it called for in the sauce (only used about 2-3 Tbsp) I'm not sure my butter for the breading was properly clarified and my frying butter was definitely not clarified. I don't think it's necessary. ALSO - I used thin chicken cutlets instead of regular boneless breasts - thus less frying time and a bit more coating and sauce per bite! I definitely recommend.

This dish was fantastic. I took the time to clarify the butter. It was easy and did not burn when I sauteed the chicken. I did as other reviewers and doubled the crumb misture and sauce. I passed the chicken through an egg-milk wash before pressing crumbs then I put crumb coated chicken in frig for about an 1 hour. The crumbs never fell off. I reduced mustard in sauce to 2 T. only because hubby does not like mustard taste. My husband and brother-in-law couldn't stop eating it. This is definately a keeper.

I made this on a first dinner date - what a winner! She's picky but loved it. I too minimized the butter usage - substituted olive oil for cooking even. Also I avoided the worchester sauce. Preparation was a bit intense - mix the sauce before starting to cook the chicken. Doing both at the same time takes some serious work. Enjoy!

I didn't have any bread crumbs so I used crushed Ritz crackers and a pinch of salt with the pecans for the breading (next time I will pulverize the pecans so they are more like flour instead of finely diced and then will stick better to the chicken) I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and they came out tander as butter. Melt in your mouth yummy! I think you can use your "bourbon of choice" (e.g. Crown Royal) and get even better results. My boyfriend gave it 5 stars! All evening he kept saying how excellent dinner had been. Don't skip the garnish of green scallions. It's the "frosting" to make the dish well rounded. We'll add this one to the rotation!

I made this for Valentine's Day dinner and it was fabulous! I tried to make the clarified butter but just couldn't get it to work (most likely my fault). I ended up doing 1 tbsp olive oil and 1 tbsp butter and it was fine. I dipped the chicken in soy milk before coating with the breadcrumbs mixture and it worked very well!

Great recipe; I made it twice so far; First time I followed it exactly; Was concerned about the amount of butter. So I dipped the chicken into beaten egg whites which made the pecan/bread crumbs hold better. Baked in oven on a sprayed pan instead of frying in butter. Once you turn the cutlets the come out just as dark as frying. Used 'I can't believe it's not butter' in the sauce but 1/2 the amount. Just as good & less fat! It's become a family favorite.

The pecan coating on the chicken was fantastic but we thought the sauce was extremely intense. It has potential though -- maybe we'll cut down on the mustard and soy sauce but we had a hard time telling which flavor was the most overpowering. Way too much butter in the sauce too - 1/2 cup is more than enough (next time will cut down to 1/4 cup). Will try again though - we could really taste the Jim Beam but the other flavors made it too strong for our tastes.

What a lovely recipe "PGraff"! It's certainly elegant enough for even the most sophisticated palates and yet so incredibly easy to make. Don't understand why some reviewers said that this was so much work. I only used four breasts and found that I had just enough coating. Would definitely need to double the recipe including the sauce for eight chicken breasts. I did not have pecans in the house so I used cashews and for the bread crumbs I threw some whole wheat bread into my food processor. Both ingredients worked nicely. I added a bit more brown sugar to the sauce due to the fact that I felt the mustard was a bit overpowering. Will cut back on that next time. I also added more bourbon as it seemed to get a little lost; again due to the mustard. Still a five star recipe that my whole family truly and totally enjoyed. Thanks so much!!-

This was very different I liked the flavor and my husband said it was a nice change for chicken. I dipped the breast in buttermilk and then in chopped pecans and fried with a little olive oil and butter on both sides just til golden put on baking sheet that had been sprayed with pam and baked for 20 min at 375. I didn't have any Bourbon so I used Rum instead and the sauce tasted pretty good will try the bourbon next time.

There was much failure when I tried the original butter/bread crumb mixture. It came out to moist and didn't stick and I decided there was enough butter in the sauce. Hence only four stars. This was delicious after tweaking it a bit because the "breading mix and butter" didn't coat well. I just pounded the breasts pat dry dredged in flour egg white wash and in the breading mix (which I just used finely chopped/ground pecan and italian style bread crumb and no butter) and browned on each side in light butter and a bit of pam for 2-3 minutes a side. I finished the cooking at 375 for 20 mins in a shallow roasting pan. I doubled the sauce but used a half butter/half spread instead. Put a slight amount of sauce on each breast to serve. Didn't have scallions so I didn't bother... DELICIOUS.

AWESOME!! This was so good. I have never been so impressed with a chicken dish! I made it for my husband's birthday dinner and now he wants to go back to buy a bigger bottle of bourbon so I can make it again and again. Since I was making it the first time for a special occasion I didn't attempt the clarified butter coating. I just combined the pecans and breadcrumbs and coated in the traditional method (flour then egg wash then crumbs). It worked perfectly - nice thick coating.

This recipe is a keeper the flavors mix together so well. I made it as written and was very happy with the results. After that however to make things a little easier I baked the chicken in the over at 350 for 40 minutes and the pecans toasted beautifully without having to worry about burning them the chicken was nice and moist.

Excellent!! I skipped the butter in the first step...I pounded out the chicken dipped them in beaten eggs and then pressed into the pecan/breadcrumb mixture. That worked well - the breadcrumb mixture stayed on. HINT: Make double the amount of breadcrumb/pecan mixture if using 8 breasts - I used only 4 breasts and it was just enough to cover them. I also used two frying pans to cook them so they wouldn't be crowded in one pan low heat - 10 minutes each side was perfect. I invited a neighbor to stay for dinner with my husband & I and the boys ended up loving this chicken so much they volunteered to do dishes if they could split the last breast for lunches the next day!! This recipe is a new favorite. I will certainly make this again and have already printed copies of the recipe for friends & family. Thank you for sharing this!!!!!

I made this for 22 people all just loved the chicken! You can eliminate all butter when frying olive oil is fine. For the gravy use less than half of the butter and kept heating until melted. This can be made ahead reheats well moist!

Liked it but don't think I would make it again. The sauce was extremely rich but the chicken breaded in the pecans was delicious without the sauce. Made the sauce beforehand used extra thin chicken cutlets and fried in olive oil to omit some of the butter. Used less butter in the sauce as well and still had a very rich taste. Nice change very different recipe - thanks.

Oh my...I would give this 6 stars if I could! This is probably my favorite chicken recipe I've made since joining allrecipes. I followed the recipe exactly except I used only about 1/3 cup butter in the sauce and I didn't have bourbon whisky but did happen to have scotch whisky. I'm not familiar with cooking hard liquers but it smelt like it would be good in the sauce and it turned out wonderful no problems there. I made my own bread crumbs as well which I think makes a huge difference in texture than buying the canned stuff. I did clarify the butter mostly because I had the extra time to do it but I'm not sure if it would have made a difference. Elegant and absolutely incredible please try this recipe!!

Chicken this way IS TO DIE FOR!!!! Just like the submitter says. The pecan/bread crumb coating and the bourbon sauce is so delicious I can hardly stand it!!! I made the sauce exactly as stated and did fiddle with the coating and cooking process a little bit... I dredged the chicken in flour dipped in a beaten egg and then dipped in the pecan/bread. I pan-fried the chicken about three minutes each side and then finished in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes (then I could really pay attention to the sauce). I read another reviewer's suggestion to put it on a wire rack to bake - then both sides would be crispy. Thank you (and your Mom!) for an amazing recipe that I will use to stun my guests!

Wow this was really good! I wanted a healthier version so I baked instead of fried. I brushed each chicken breast with egg white then rolled in the bread crumb/pecan mixture and omitted the butter. Baked at 375 for about 40-45 minutes. For the sauce I only used about half of the butter called for. I was hoping for leftovers but it was so good we ate every last bite. Thanks!

I joined allrecipes just so I could review this recipe. It is truly incredible. I have been making it for a couple of years now and it is one of my husband's favorites! (And one of mine as well!) For a healthier version I bake the chicken instead of frying usually at 420 for 20 minutes or so and reduce the butter in the sauce. The best for taste is to fry the chicken but if you're health-conscious the baked version is a great way to go!

Wonderful! Great company or special night dish..... I also browned 2 min. per side and finished in over at 350 degrees for 15 min. I had flattened the chicken so this was perfect. The sauce is rich and has complex flavors.... I only used 1/2 of butter called for and it was still yummy!! Highly recommend!!

The chicken turned out great! I marinated my chicken with a little sesame oil (happened to have it and it has a great flavor) bourbon and a little garlic powder. This with the pecan breading gave the chicken great flavor I barely needed the sauce. Make sure the pecan is minced so that it will stick to the chicken. It is hard not to burn the pecan coating when frying so I would sugguest finishing it in the microwave or oven.

I have never in my life made something so absolutely amazing!!! I followed the advice of others and blended the pecans and bread crumbs in my magic bullet. Then coated the chicken with flour then egg white before breading it. After frying it on each side for 3 minuets I finished it in the oven ay 375 for 20 minutes. PERFECT. I couldn't believe how simple and easy this was! This is my new ace in the hole!!! Thank you thank you THANK YOU!!!!

I thought this recipe was great! I have made it several times. However I used regular butter and I found that this tends to burn so I am going to try using thinner chicken breast cutlets next time to shorten the cooking time.

I've made this several times and have found ways to perfect it. Instead of coating the chicken with butter I use a beaten egg. Also...instead of using the butter to fry with I add a little olive oil. Once I get the coating nice and golden brown I pop the chicken on a cookie wire rack placed on top of a cookie sheet and bake at 350 for about 20 minutes. This cooks them without browning them and the oil drips through the rack and makes them a tad more healthier. I have done what other reviewers have done and decreased the amount of bourbon by about half and I also clarify the butter for the sauce and add about 1/4c milk to dilute the strong taste of the sauce. I have also completely left out the butter and just used milk and found it didn't taste much different with out it. If prepared this way then I usually return to heat prior to serving so it's nice and warm. If you don't clarify the butter though the oil will separate and it looks just awful. I am not used to eating such a rich and heavy meal so when I first made this as the recipe called for my stomach was not too thrilled even though it was absolutely delicious and I could not stop eating it! The revisions I made still let the recipe taste close to the original but without all the fat from the butter which is definitely apprecaited my tummy allowing me to enjoy it a little better and a little more often:) If using 8 breasts double the measurements for the sauce!

This was good loved the pecan coating but the sauce was a little too dijon-y for my taste. Planned on using half the butter but used it all trying to dilute the dijon flavor. I'll make this again and reduce the dijon a tad. I used the suggestion of browning on both sides 2 minutes each and placing in the oven at 375 for 15 minutes - very moist!!

Made this recipe for my husband's birthday and he and the kids all enjoyed it. It was easy and the pecan coating was wonderful. The sauce was good but very rich. I made the sauce again as a steak sauce and cut back on the butter using only 3/4 of a stick and it seemed much better. It was great even with steaks.

I went out and bought a bottle of Jim Beam because of this recipe. I have found other recipes to try with bourbon so is not a waste if you are not a drinker. Or you may like this recipe as much as I did and use the bottle up making this again and again. Fantastic

I love this recipe. I first had it when a friend of ours made it but she was really bummed out when it burned some. I personally love anything with a little charred-flavor to it so I LOVED it the way it was. I now let my piece burn a little:). I crave this dish often and make it every other month or so. However I struggle to find what to serve with this dish. It seems incomplete...

I tried this recipe yesterday. I had some problems with the crust not sticking to the chicken but I had doubled the amount of crushed pecans and bread crumbs. Or perhaps I was looking for more breading and it was supposed to be a light breading. That being said this was a tasty recipe which I will definately do again. The sauce is delicious and the pecans do add a touch to the chicken. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is so delicious! You should definitely make this recipe. It was one of the best meals we had in awhile. I didn't try the clarified butter but it seemed ok. I didn't have the green onions to my chagrin but since it was my first time trying this I didn't miss them. I will definitely make this again soon!

WOW! We really enjoyed this recipe! Very easy! Followed exactly. Pounded chicken breasts thin prior to coating which helped to get them fried in the 20 minutes of cook time. Doubled the amount of sauce which was a good thing! Had plenty to go around but none to spare! Did not "clarify" the butter (seperating out the milk solids to enable a higher smoke point while frying) but fried over medium heat and it was fine - you don't have to clarify the butter - just keep an eye on it so that it doesn't get too hot while frying. Loved the sauce! Served with mashed potatoes and salad. Compliments all around the table. Thanks for the post!

This is restaurant quality... Make sure to use clarified butter it will keep it from burning. The only change I made was to use only 1/2 c of unsalted butter instead of 3/4 c.

Wow this chicken is awesome! The chicken is juicy and crispy and the sauce rich and decadent. All the flavors go together so well. I made the recipe slightly healthier and easier. I used olive oil instead of clarified butter to cook the chicken in. I browned the chicken about 2 minutes on each side then baked them in a 350 oven for 20 minutes. That was convenient because it then let me make the sauce and potatoes to serve with. I only used 6 Tbsp. butter in the sauce and it turned out great. Other tips include chopping the pecans very fine using Panko breadcrumbs and adding some salt and pepper to the crumb mixture. Dip the chicken in a slightly beaten egg before coating with the crumb mixture. Also use unsalted butter and reduced sodium soy sauce. Enjoy!

GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO PLAIN OLD BREADED CHICKEN!! I tried this recipe out on my family (with two picky teens) my in-laws my dad and sister. Everybody thought it was great and said the sauce was excellent. Word of advice fry at a little lower heat than you would normally fry chicken since pecans can burn easily. It takes a bit longer to cook but burned pecan taste horrible and can ruin a dish. I served it with squash casserole fresh green beans and corn bread.

I have had this in my recipe box for about a year now and never made it until last night. I can't believe I waited so long. As scared as I was that my husband and my four year old wouldn't like the sauce (I put it on the side) they ended up using all of it. They loved it and my husband was really impressed. I substituted Whiskey for Bourbon and Olive Oil for Clarified Butter. Improvements for next time: I will pound out the chicken so that they cook more evenly and juicier I will use the clarified butter since it doesn't burn as fast in the pan and I will use a little less Dijon mustard just a little. It was quick easy and elegant. I can't wait to have company over for dinner to make this meal.

This is a dish I could eat a few days a week... My family LOVED IT and everyone went back for thirds and forths. I made it with garlic mashed potatoes and romaine strawberry salad. And it all went so perfect together. I did do one thing different because I had a really hard time getting the breading to stick I covered each piece with breading poured melted butter on top and baked it in the over..... Perfecto.....

Thank you. My husband loves this and my 5yo likes it without the sauce. I fried with a lot less butter than stated and blackened a few pieces by sprinkling brown sugar in the pan and cooking the chicken on top of it. Difficult not to burn the sugar too much though

The taste is 5 stars but imperfect instructions knock it down to 4. You really need that egg wash to keep the crumbs on the chicken. I first made this recipe to test its usuability in my new freezer-cooking program. I breaded the chicken (without adding butter to the crumbs) and froze them last week. Then last night I baked them at 375 for about 45 minutes from frozen with a few dabs of butter on top (this also eliminates the need to clarify the butter). Next time I'll try freezing the sauce ingredients as well (except for the butter) so that I can eliminate even more steps and then heat and stir in the butter just before serving.

Went out on a limb and made this for the in-laws the other night. Received rave reviews. The sauce is tangy and rich; I drizzled it lightly over the platter of breaded fried chicken breasts and put leftover sauce in a gravy boat on the table for guests to season to their desire. The pecan taste and smell really comes out when you fry these. This one is a keeper; will make again.

I served this recently and it was hailed as 'the best food' my family 'had eaten all year.' We ended up using a bit more bourbon than the recipe called for the second time we tried this and I highly recommend doing so. I also did not use butter to bread the breasts; I dipped them in milk/egg instead as this is what I'm used to.

I used almonds instead of pecans as my wife is allergic to the pecans. I also baked the chicken as I had read of some of the issues others had not to mention the chicken breasts from Sam's club were huge and needed the extra cooking time. No need to double the size of the sauce remember it is to be drizzled over the top...its not a gravy. I really enjoyed it and will probably make it again. Very nice recipe.

This is fantastic! I've tried using less butter in the sauce and cutting it in half is too much so using 3/4 of what is called for is perfect. Definitely serve with the green onions--I can't imagine this without them. This is my husband's preferred chicken recipe now. Even the kids like it (without the green onions for one and without the green onions and sauce for the other).

So so so yummy! We watch our calorie intake so I made some changes. Instead of pan frying in butter I coated the chicken in a beaten egg then dusted with the nut mixture and baked at 375 for about 40 minutes (turning once). When I made the sauce I added a little bit of margarine at the end instead of the butter. It was fantastic! My fiance and I really enjoyed it. Great served with a vegetable. I am going to make an Asian style sauce next time with almonds instead of pecans. Thanks for sharing will definitely make again!!!

Very good! A little time consuming and the sauce was a bit to dijon/buttery for our tastes so next time we will cut back on the added butter and dijon perhaps add a midgen more dark brown sugar. We baked the chicken... prepared it the same placed in glass pan - sliced 1/4 cup butter around chicken and baked at 375 for an hour. Seems to make the chicken much more tender rather than chewy. Thank you for this recipe!

WOW! This really is as good as everyone says! I followed many of the reviewers' suggestions like cutting down on the butter in the sauce (loved the sauce) and using olive oil and butter to fry up the chicken. I also used those chicken breasts that come alredy sliced very thinly. That cut down on the problem of burning the nuts. We really loved this dish!! I served it with roasted asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.

This was great! The bourbon/Dijon mustard combination was a great pairing. I was in a bit of a hurry so I didn't take the time to clarify my butter but it turned out great anyway. For the 3/4 cup of butter cut into small cubes I cut it into 1/2 inch cubes but I recommend going a little smaller to make that step a little easier. It took a while to get these to melt particularly toward the end of the process. This is definitely a keeper!

This was ok. The chicken was pretty good but there was nothing spectacular about the sauce. You need to flatten the chicken first and then coat it with flour then egg then use the pecan coating otherwise it won't stick. Use oil and butter instead of clarifying the butter to save time. Nothing great about the sauce. I will definitely try a white wine sauce with butter with some orange zest for the sauce.

This recipe was AMAZING; oh my goodness we were in heaven! I stir fried some veggies and heaped them on top before pouring the sauce over--wow! So good! (Oh I couldn't get my chicken done on the stovetop before the pecans started to over brown so I pan fried golden and them and then put them in a 400 degree oven for 7-10 minutes to finish baking them.) This is a TOTAL make again recipe.

Absolutely delicious. I also pan-fried it and then finished it in the oven. I thought the soy flavor was a little too strong in the sauce so I put the sauce on before I put it in the oven so it could caramelize and sweeten. Next time I will use the bourbon to deglaze the frying pan and make the sauce in that pan to get all the goodness from there. Was a huge hit at my house. I made it with thighs and the juiciness of the dark meat was just amazing with these flavors.

I used this recipe for a dinner party and it was amazing! I was worried the chicken would turn out tough just cooking it in the pan so I browned all the sides and then cooked it in the oven on 350 until in was done. It was so tender and juicy! PS seasoned bread crumbs work just as great.

I have to say that there are few recipes that turn out exactly the way it suppose to from a recipe. I too did not use as much butter as the recipe called for but nonetheless there was not one family member who did not like it (which is shocking in itself!) Definitely a keeper! Excellent recipe and shared with my co-workers!

WOW I can't wait to make it for my husband for a candle-light dinner. mmmm. I baked the chicken as other people suggested. I also did not use clarified butter. (regular butter and olive oil as others suggested). I had bought honey Dijon. I also used light brown sugar. I only made one and it came out awesome!

This is a 5-star recipe but it only turned out to be a 4-star because some of the breasts got a little burnt. I would knock back the heat a bit... maybe the low side of medium. I didn't allow enough time to make the clarified butter so I used olive oil. Someone else mentioned it on here and it worked out well. The sauce is wonderful! I had to fight the urge to keep trying it spoonful after spoonful.

After I took the chicken off of the heat I poured the sauce over it right in the skillet. I covered it & let it sit for a while. I served the chicken & sauce over a bed of mashed sweet potatoes. It was unreal. My boyfriend has renamed this "Go in 60 Seconds Chicken".

Great recipe. I made this dish on short notice so there wasn't time to clarify the butter but it turned out just fantastic with regular butter for me. I also flattened the chicken before coating and pan-frying and finished them up in the oven for about 15 minutes at 350. My son said it tasted "like it would cost a lot of money in a fancy restaurant." Thanks for a good recipe!

This is only pretty good the sauce is tasty enough but I was disappointed in the pecan crust just not as tasty and crunchy as I expected. I really like "Deviled Chicken Breasts" a similar recipe from this site more than this one.

This is some of the best chicken I have ever tasted yet alone made in my own kitchen! Thanks so much for sharing this I will be making it for years to come. I used 4 large breasts and there was just the right amount of sauce. We had some picky friends over for dinner and I cooked it for them they were still talking about it the next day spreading the word about it's yumminess! Happy Cooking! MysHill

I made lots of ingredient substitutions and this still turned out well. It's too sweet and rich for my taste so I won't be making it again but it was fun to try.

If a could give this 10 stars i would. I used chicken breast cutlets (split breasts to make for thinner breasts) but everything else followed exactly. I had to buy a 26oz of bourbon to make this recipe as no smaller bottles. I have been looking for recipes since then that have bourbon in them. This was really really good and I would definitely make this again and again. A very impressive and delectable dish.

Very good! Had NO problems with it burning and getting too dark. However we did cut our breasts in half (length wise) so they were thinner. Also added more butter when I turned sides. Just kept it on med. heat and flipped after 10 min (adding more butter) They were perfect. Will be making again for sure.

This is very tasty I pounded the chicken breasts to an even thickness then browned them on each side and finished in the oven. I did not use clarified butter but this seems necessary as the unclarified does start to burn very quickly. The sauce is a nice compliment - very intense just to be drizzled on - not like a gravy. Will make again.

This is an great recipe. I dipped the chicken in egg to be sure that the batter would stick. I was glad that I did. I forgot to dip one of the chicken breast before battering it and it lost a good bit of the batter. The cilantro orange rice that was an awesome side for the pecan chicken.

This is possibly the best chicken dish I have ever made and I cook a LOT of chicken. I now make this once/month and my husband and son beg me to make it even more often. I only make 2 small changes: 1. Use a couple tablespoons less butter in the sauce (makes me feel healthier....haha)! 2. I put the pecans and bread crumbs together in the blender and blend until VERY FINE. This helps the breading stay on during the cooking process. Other than that NO CHANGES are necessary. My 17 year old remarked that I could open a restaurant and serve only this dish.

wow this was delicious! The only thing I changed was I used chicken thighs because I was concerned about it getting too dry. This has a little bit more of a bourbon flavor but it still was good. Next time I'll try the vanilla instead of bourbon. My husband said he'd rate it 9.6 if I would have used the chicken breasts as written;) This will definitely be a staple in our house!

Oh mama this was a great dish! Made it for a weeknight dinner and felt guilty that it was too indulgent! Followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use clarified butter and I cannot believe how tasty and simple it was. Used my mini prep to chop the pecans a little finer than my nut grinder would have done. And I used panko bread crumbs because that was all I had. The sauce is to die for! Thanks for a great recipe.

absolutely delicious! this certainly is a restaurant quality recipe. i didn't clarify the butter (i added 1 T. of olive oil to it instead to allow for cooking at a high temperature without burning) or have the butter pieces chilled for the sauce. jim beam's kentucky bourbon whiskey did the trick for a super rich flavor. try to spend the extra 50 cents for green onions. you'll be glad you did! thanks for this great recipe pgraff your mom has terrific taste!

The breading on the chicken was wonderful. I used ciabatta bread for the crumbs and added a teaspoon of cinnamon to compliment the sweetness in the sauce. I needed twice the amount of breading the recipe called for. The sauce itself however was dissapointing. Too many strong flavors and it overwhelmed otherwise very good chicken. I will definetly make the chicken again probably not the sauce.

I served this to 24 for dinner for a party. I dipped the chicken breasts (cut in half) before the pecan mix. Browned in vegetable oil. Then finished in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes. Only used 1/3 cup butter in sauce. It was a Hit!!

I would really give this a 3.5. It is really high in unneccesary fat and were I like the chicken (5 thin chicken breasts and 4 vegetarian "chicken" cutlets) the sauce to me was really salty. I assume from the soy and worchestire and after a few bites I couldn't eat it at all. Overall I will make it again for the hubby but will make myself something else.

This is definitely something I'll make again. I did make just a couple minor changes. I didn't have dijon and just used spicy brown mustard and I used panko rather than reg breadcrumbs - so much crispier:) I used the chopper attchment to my immersion blender to chop the pecans and then added the panko and pulsed a few times to make it finer. I also did the egg instead of adding butter to the pecan coating - worked very well for me. I also didn't used clarified butter and since the butter was browning too fast on the first batch even w/ half canola oil I used all canola on the second batch (I did 6 good sized breasts - only 3 fit in the skillet at a time). I also browned in the skillet and finished in the oven - partly because my breasts were fairly thick and also because this allowed me make the sauce while they finished in the oven - less stress!:) Plus the oven was on anyway for baked sweet potatoes. 4 out of 5 is what my hubby said he'd give it - I consider that a pretty good rating! I do wish we could do half starts I would likely then five it 4.5:)

This is delicious recipe and i thank you PGRAFF for sharing! I cut the recipe in half thank goodness I'm only cooking for me so even 4 breasts made plenty of leftovers... I did have rather thick breasts I was working with so the cook time was quite a bit longer and I failed to adjust the temp accordingly quickly enough (I'm also cooking on an electric stove like that's not a challenge...) so it did tend to over-brown the crust. However that being noted it still came out delicious with an excellent taste. Another recommendation to combat that from happening was an excellent suggestion from another member that you can actually finish it in an oven at about 350 - for about 15 minutes or until it reaches 180. The Sauce was the tricky part and time consuming adding the butter so slow but I relaxed and took the time to slowly incorporate the butter. I found that I had to keep it on the warm burner in order for it to remain hot for when it was time to pour on top of the cooked chicken. This is the challenge for next time and I will be reading other reviews to see if there are tricks and or suggestions to maintaining a hot sauce instead of a room temperature sauce. It is pretty tasty:0) Thanks again PGRAFF for the recipe! I will cook this dish again.

My husband couldn't stop complimenting me on this. With every bite he closed his eyes and "mmmmm" 'd! The flavor was supurb and the chicken was incredibly tender. I have to admit that I did return the sauce to the heat after whisking in all the butter. I thought it really did need to be warmer after being off the heat for all that time. It was still a great consistancy. I used all the butter the recipe called for but next time I will use less than half of that 3/4 cup. I think it would be just as good and not quite so high in fat. Wonderful dish - thanks so much!

This was FABULOUS!! I used clarified butter (a must so that you are able to cook the chicken for 10 minutes per side and the butter won't burn). Also keep in mind that clarified butter should always be made from UNSALTED butter and it's super-easy to make. I also used chicken cutletts which are about 1/2" thick and they worked out perfectly....no need to finish them off in the oven. I highly recommend doing this because if you do the coating is super crispy (I also used panko breadcrumbs). I served it with mashed red skinned potatoes and asparagus and the sauce soaks into the potatoes and is to die for!! Also keep in mind it's a sauce and not a gravy. Will make this again and again....

This was not bad though I think it would be much easier to cook the chicken in olive oil (with or without some butter added to it) the clarified butter thing didn't work at all for me and my chicken got kinda burnt. But the non-burned parts tasted pretty good and my mom especially loved the sauce.

Delicious and relatively easy. I pounded the chicken breasts so they would cook more quickly and the crust would not burn. Next time I'll leave off the green onions as they don't harmonize with the flavor of the sauce.

Very good. I found that the directions as stated don't work for me even with clarified butter. The pecans were burning well before the chicken was done so I put it in the oven at 375 for about ten minutes. Very tasty and tender. Made the bourbon sauce exactly as the recipe stated and it was wonderful! I don't enjoy whiskey as a beverage but it's great as a sauce for this chicken.

Loved it! The blend of flavors was spot on but it was difficult to coat the chicken with the breadcrumb/pecan mixture. Next time I would grind the pecans in the food processor before mixing them with the breadcrumbs. I might also dredge the chicken with an egg wash before coating it. Both of those steps would help create a chicken coating with the same great flavor but better sticking-power! The sauce was super easy but made a dramatic difference in the final product. I will make this for my family and dinner guests alike!

I made this tonight and absolutely love it. I took the advice of others and put the chicken in the oven to finish cooking. But while it was in there I put a little more dark brown sugar and chopped pecans on it. I think that it really added to it. That way when you were cutting into the chicken pecans were already falling off.

This was excellent. I made it for a dinner party and they loved it. I followed other's suggestions and pan fried them for about 3 min a side. Then I placed them in a 375 degrees oven and baked them for 20-25 minutes based on size. I pounded the chicken breast for more even cooking. I doubled the sauce reciped but only put in 1/2 cup butter and it was fine. I would even use less next time. Also may just want to bake the entire time and skip the pan fry. I used olive oil to pan fry. I used egg white wash on the chicken breast before I coated them with pecans and matza meal and it stayed on perfectly. NO need to fatten it up with butter! I am still getting compliments on it three days later!. The chicken was so moist and tender. A wonderful recipe.

The pantry was getting low and I didn't have pecans or green onion. I decided to make this anyway using the walnuts I had on hand and followed the rest of the recipe to a T (minus the green onion of course). This made an amazing sauce that complemented the chicken very well. My son is incredibly picky and said that this is the #2 best chicken he's ever had (next to chicken nuggets of course). I enjoyed it and so did my other half. Adding this to the "make again" pile!

Loved it! Next time I may try to add more pecan in the breading mixture and will try to bake the chicken some therefore reducing the pan fry time. I also used regular butter and regular brown sugar and it tasted fantastic. My husband and I really liked it. Recipes makes a lot of the sauce.

My family and I loved this recipe. I considered seasoning the chicken prior to pan frying it; however it WAS NOT necessary. The Bourbon glaze added wonderful flavor... And I am a very picky eater. I used a bit less butter and toaster whole wheat bread for my bread crumbs. I recommend using a strainer (yes a strainer not a sifter) to ensure that your bread and pecans crumbs are small enough. This way they can coat much easier (on the damp chicken).

The chicken with pecans was fine though I had trouble with the pecans not wanting to stick to the chicken and also burning. I ended up baking the chicken to get it fully cooked but not burnt. The sauce was overpowering and my boyfriend a fan of bourbon when drinking did not like the bourbon being in the sauce. This was also an incredibly messy dish. I will not be making it again.

It was OK. Ive had A LOT better. I'd followed the directions exactly like it said and I STILL wasnt like everyone else is saying. 1. The bread crumb mixtures doesnt coat the chicken well. 2. The saw was not that good. I had to more brown sugar & cayenne pepper to give it a little spice. And because of the cayenne pepper the sauce became better. I will not make this again....To each is there own. I say try it out for yourself first.;-)

This was really good but I only gave it 3 stars because I changed it and for the amount of butter it really isn't worth the fat/calories. Didn't bother with the clarified butter used unsalted butter & oil instead. Good but like I said not worth the extra treadmill time!

Served this to guests today and they raved. The only change I made was that I fried the chicken in olive oil instead of clarified butter and accidentally left out the butter in the sauce. No matter though they raved about the sauce too. I'm glad to have made lots and have some for leftovers. It would be good to make as strips or nuggets with the sauce as a dipping sauce too. Thanks PGraff!

My family and I loved this recipe! This will be one we repeat. I would make this for company as well! I am not a chef and I followed the instructions along with reading some recommendations from the reviews and this was fantastic! My updates: I did not use/make the clarified butter. I coated my chicken in egg instead of butter then rolled it in the breadcrumb/pecan - the coating stuck very nice. Thanks so much for this recipe - delicious!

Fabulous. Read the reviews and subbed 2tbsp EVCoconutO for the cooking butter an egg for the 'battering' butter and 1/2c milk (didn't have heavy cream) for the sauce butter. Also used finely chopped walnuts instead of pecans. Turned out perfectly! Delicious will make again!

It was pretty good but the mustard was a little much for me. I think next time I'll halve the mustard and I think that would help - but I love the texture of the chicken and I didn't have any trouble with burning as I flattened the chicken thoroughly before cooking.

Thank you so much for this recipe and to all the reviewers who gave it 5 stars! I needed a chicken recipe for a Culinary contest and this is the one I chose. I had all the ingredients except for the bourbon and substituted my husband's irish whiskey. I renamed the recipe Pecan Crusted Chicken with Irish Whiskey Sauce and won 1st Place!!! One of the judges was a retired captain of a famous cruise line and he went back for a 2nd helping! You must try this one if you want to impress someone!! Another reason I liked it is because I did not have to use my oven to make it.

I can't stand when someone rates a recipe poorly and didn't use the exact ingredients. Well I hate to say it but I was out of dijon mustard so I used chipotle mustard and a marinade instead of worchestershire sauce because I was out of it too. I only whisked in 1/2 cup butter rather than 3/4 cup but let me tell you - this chicken is OUTSTANDING. My husband even commented on how tender it was. The breast were I thought very thick but 10 minutes per side was just about perfect. I served this with rice and it was just absolutely delicious. Thanks for the recipe - I'll be making this again!

The breading for the chicken was quite good. I did not have clarified butter so I used butter and olive oil. I also cooked the onions first and then cooked the chicken on top. Most of the onions ended up stuck to the chicken but it allowed for the chicken to have great flavor. As for the sauce if I'd realized that the dominant ingredient in the sauce was mustard I wouldn't have made it. In fact that should be what is emphasized in the title of this recipe and not bourbon because it's really all you can taste. I tried to cover the flavor but was unable to and no one else in my household ended up using it either. If I were to make this again I would definately be in search of another sauce.

a dish to impress guests for sure. The only thing i did differently was triple the sauce recipe and served over wide egg noodles. I didn't have bourbon so i used templeton rye whiskey. don't know how that affected the flavor but it was awesome. the sauce gets better over time so if you can make the sauce a day in advance it will be really good. not really sure why the recipe is so specific about how to add the butter to the sauce because i just threw it all together and it was great.

This is a really unique taste that keeps you interested. I had to make some substitutions since I didn't have all the ingredients: 1T 1t vanilla extract for bourbon and I left out the Worcestershire sauce. I also pounded the chicken breasts before cooking to ensure they cooked evenly. I think next time I would add a smidge more brown sugar to the sauce.

Absolutely phenomenal! Seriously y'all....this tasted like a top end restaurant meal for sure! Was our Valentine's Day meal and my husband raved throughout. I did make a few changes...I had 2 huge breasts that I pounded and cut in half. Used same amount of ingredients though. I substituted Panko crumbs because they are crunchier. Dipped the breasts in egg/milk wash - did not add butter to bread crumbs. Also as others did I browned til golden in skillet and then finished cooking in oven for 15 min. Oh....and yeah....we like the taste of bourbon so added a bit more. Sauce is freaking amazing! You won't regret trying this!

This is good. I didnt get all fancy with the chilled cubed butter; I just added the amount needed and let it melt all at once. This was even better the next day. Excellent.

AMAZING!!!!! Just like our favorite dish at a local restaurant that is 25! Now we can enjoy it for just a fraction of the price! I've already made it 5 times! The only thing I did differently is not using all the butter the sauce calls for. It makes me feel better but still tastes the same.

I made no changes to this recipe and just loved it. This recipe was perfect for four large chicken breasts not eight.This recipe is great to serve when having company! The green onions are a nice touch. We loved it!

This recipe was very good. The sauce was in my opinion too buttery and too mustardy. I'm not a big fan of mustard sauces but with all the other ingredients I thought the mustard flavor wouldn't be as strong as it was. I loved the pecan crusted chicken and have made that part again but used the "Whiskey Grill Glaze" instead.

Good flavor but the sauce came out very runny for me - I tried to add cornstarch and that made it just odd. Probably my fault though but it was tasty!

This was a great recipe- called for a little bit of work but had great taste! I just used melted margarine and olive oil and didnt use the full amount of butter at the end. I also only had brown mustard- not dijon. Turned out fine without. As previous review mentioned I only browned for a few min each side then cooked rest of time in oven. Only complaint from husband was that it was a little too sweet. Will add less sugar next time. I made the full amount of sauce for only 2 large chicken breast. was so good with cheesy mashed potatoes!

I thought the chicken was extremely flavorful and the pecans gave each piece a very nice crust. I would definitely consider using this portion of the recipe for other dishes as well (i.e. salads chicken tenders etc.). I didn't add the entire amount of butter to the sauce (thought it would be too rich)...maybe because of this reason the sauce was a little strong and overpowered the pecan taste slightly. Next time I might try to slightly tone down the sauce. Also I think it's definitely a good idea to serve the sauce on the side...it keeps the chicken from getting soggy and each person can judge how much sauce they want.

Not bad but not great either. The chicken should be dipped in some sort of egg or other liquid to help the coating stay on. I also felt the sauce had too much mustard and too much butter - the bourbon flavor was overpowered by them. Less of those ingredients would certainly improve it; the recipe is otherwise quite good.

This is a great way to do something DIFFERENT with chicken. I have used this recipe on several occasions each time working with Bushmills instead of bourbon simply because that is what was handy. Stil wonderful!!! It's got a tangy savory taste that makes your taste buds tingle. Do it... you'll love it.

This tasted really yummy as long as you didnt use too much sauce. If you drizzled a little on it was very good but if you put too much i founf it way too salty. Im giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the saltiness and it was also a bit hard to get the pecans to stick to the chicken. But overall good taste.

This was very good. I used thin chicken breasts and they cooked fine with no burning. I won't put as much mustard in the sauce next time the flavor was a little overpowering otherwise great recipe! I will serve definitely make again.

I made this recipe to a tee and it was perfect. The only thing i would note is I used 8 - 6 ounce chicken breasts and pounded them out. It was a hit with the family and will be a "go to"dish for guest and friends.

Got rave reviews! I converted the recipe for five servings and only ended up using four fairly large chicken breasts barely having enough coating for all four pieces. I also didn't have any plain bread crumbs so I used crushed buttercrisp crackers instead. I used plain whiskey instead of bourbon whiskey but those are the only substitutes I made. My father raved and raved and wants the recipe to use for company!

I made this for my mother-in-law for mothers day and it was a hit! She wanted the recipe. My husband loved it he scraped the remaining of the sauce over his rice. Hint one of the little personal size bottles is just the right amount to use if you are like use and don't drink alot.

Oh my. Excellent! The only change I made was to dip chicken in egg before pecan/bread crumb use butter olive oil to brown then popped the breasts in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes to finish cooking. Thank you for this 5 star recipe!

This is my number one recipe to cook for an elegant meal and I always get requests. I have found that the chicken can scorch easily so I often brown it in the pan and then finish it off in the oven for a few minutes to avoid blackening. I find the sauce too rich so I double all the ingredients except for the butter and then add water to make the difference. This will require a bit of thickening up but you will end up with a beautiful sauce that isn't quite so rich. Also you ca prepare most of the sauce in advance and just add the butter at the last moment during final steps. This is absolutely our # 1 fav fancy meal.

This recipe was great. I did clarify the butter and only had a slight problem with the crumbs/pecans sticking. I was afraid I had not turned the chicken over before burning the crust but as one reveiwer mentioned this was only the brown sugar and only turning it once while cooking helped the crumbs/pecans adhere. Will try the egg wash next time as well. Thank you for such a rich and delicious dish!

I was looking forward to having this recipe because I love chicken. I found the sauce disappointing but my guests thought the sauce was okay; it definitely had a different taste than I expected based on the ingredients. The chicken turned out great. To keep the pecan coating on the chicken dredge the breasts in flour first then egg then the pecan/bread crumb mixture. This works every time. I followed others suggestions to saute the meat until golden brown on both sides (about 2 to 3 minutes each side) then bake in a 375 degree oven for 15 to twenty minutes. The breasts were very tender and moist -- done perfectly.

This Recipe was sooooo good. I made another version in the past and this one was much better. Dont leave out the bourbon its just not the same and I definitely agree half the butter does just fine ( this recipe calls for alot of butter ) thankyou for the great recipe my mom asks for it for her birthday:)

This was fabulous! Followed the advice of making egg/milk wash to dip chicken in prior to dipping in crumbs. Also did not add butter to crumbs just pecans and bread crumbs. The sauce was TO. DIE. FOR. Served it with garlic Parmesan mashed red potatoes. My husband soaked up every drop of the sauce with his potatoes and bread. My husband told me to save the recipe with huge stars next to it! Even my two teenagers loved it. Wow not often a meal is a hit with everyone. Thank you.

was ok. but i will try it again. what went wrong? my clarified butter. i think i screwed it up. next time i use butter and olive oil and fry it in an electric skillet. mine got a bit burned. I had 3 large chicken breasts and it used up all the nut/bread crumb mixture. Next time I will try smaller chicken breasts. The sauce had loads of flavor but the amount of butter seemed like so much! thankfully a little sauce went a very long way. I served mine with garlic mashed potatoes. Hoping next time I try it the results are better. Goes to show you need to make a recipe at least three time to get it right!

This recipe is wonderful. Great for company. It is fast and easy to make. Easy kitchen clean up too! We discovered one more great thing about this recipe. If you are lucky enough to have left overs and chop up a couple hard boiled eggs add a couple of teaspoons of mayo a couple more green onions you have an awesome chicken salad.

Fabulous flavor! I took the advice of others and dipped the chicken in an eggwash and omitted the butter in crumbs. Also I accidentally used seasoned dry bread crumbs - flavor was still great! I didn't realize we were out of Bourbon so I used Irish Whisky - tasted fabulous. In regard to adding the butter to the sauce at the end I left the pan on the burner with the heat on and kept whisking as I added the butter cubes until all was melted - no harm was done to the sauce doing it this way plus the sauce was nice and hot when it was complete. Will definitely make this recipe again - especially if we have company!

This was truly amazing. The sauce is absolutely delicious. I doubled the amount of sauce and served it over both the chicken and the mashed potatoes and the family raved. I did cheat a bit on the chicken though (insert sheepish grin here). I couldn't find clarified butter and didn't have time to make it on a weeknight so I dipped the breasts in an egg/milk/salt/pepper dip and then pressed them into the bread crumb/pecan mixture. Also I followed a suggestion on the thread to move the chicken to an oven pan to finish cooking. Some of them were kind of thick and the coating was starting to get too dark to keep them in the pan. I plan to try again on a weekend when I can make the clarified butter first and experience this one in its original glory.

I made this recipe for my husband. The only thing I changed was dipping the chicken breasts in egg and milk wash. The sauce was a nice addition to the chicken but next time I think I will add balsamic vinegar instead of brown sugar- much too sweet. Also bowtie pasta makes a good addition to this meal.

I breaded and fried chicken cutlets in olive oil. I added crushed pecans to the sauce which by the way was a lot darker than the picture. I thought it was just ok. I poured the sauce over the chicken garnished with fresh parsley and slices of orange. I'd make this again but I don't think it's out of this world. Thank you.

I just made this for dinner we all licked our plates!!! I think it's the best meal I have ever made will be my new company dinner. I took the shortcuts suggested put the chicken directly in the breading without any butter (used italian bread crumbs all I had). Browned it then baked it 15 minutes in 350 oven came out perfect. Any breading that fell off I quickly sauted in the pan with with butter then threw on top of chicken as I put in oven to bake. Made sauce per the recipe. Don't skip the green onions adds a great touch. Seriously make this NOW!!!

Very tasty. The sauce was really good too. Only used 1/4 cup butter (instead of 3/4 cup) and it was plenty. Didn't bother with the clarified butter - follow other reviewer's suggestion of 2 T butter and 2 t. olive oil. Worked perfectly!

After reading comments from several other raters I combined them; used egg wash doubled up on the chopped pecans and bread crumbs and last....tripled the bourbon sauce and it is a good thing I did....I have enough left over for when I grille chicken during the week. I prepared this meal for my three girlfriends who not only went home with a doggie bag they also took the recipe with them too.....:-)

This recipe is one of the best ways to cook chicken breast that I have ever made. The pecans make the breading and the sauce is quite decadent. I like many others browned the chicken breasts in the pan then switched them to a 375 degree oven to finish which worked great. I also dipped the chicken in egg then into the breading instead of using the butter. This is a meal that looks and tastes like you spent a lot more time on it than you did! Don't forget the onions.------ dlecount

Great recipe. My fiancee commented that its presentation was restaurant worthy. The only things that I did differently were to dip the chicken into an egg and milk mixture before pressing it into the breading and I kept the sauce on the side to pour over the chicken right before serving.

This recipe is outstanding! The only change I made was lightly dipped the chicken (I used cutlets) in egg before the coatings and used panko crumbs with the pecans. The sauce is so good. Definately will make it again and again!

The taste of this is five star for sure! But I am only rating 4 stars because the proportions seemed to be off. I am lucky I had enough pecans because I actually had to triple the breading to have enough for the stated amount of chicken. I ran out of butter for the sauce (only had 1 stick left to use instead of 1.5 called for) because I used much much more than the recipe stated to pan fry the chicken. I also had to double the sauce (doubled everything but the butter since I ran out) to have enough and still ran out. Maybe the chicken breasts I used were larger than average? But this still turned out amazing everyone loved it. I did not add the green onions this time (just seemed odd to me) but I think I'll try them next time I make it.

I thought this was pretty good. My family loved it. I also baked it after browning to prevent burning. It turned out perfect. I only used 4 breasts and used up all of the pecans/bread crumbs on them.

Normally when I cook/bake things I tend to find a recipe with a good review so this choice seemed to be a good option. Although I'm not a fan of fried foods...I figured I'd try it out first (without changes) before I judged it. It had a good taste but IF YOU DO NOT LIKE REALLY GREASY FOODS/FRIED FOODS DO NOT MAKE THIS!! I expected more but maybe I'll try it again with baked chicken? -Judge it for yourself.

Only made the sauce from this recipe but it turned out FANTASTIC! My mom and I made a stuffed pecan crusted chicken breast for Passover and she was worried they would turn out too dry so I made up this sauce in a matter of minutes to serve with the chicken. It was a hit and everyone was raving over how good the sauce turned out. I will have to the chicken part the next time (it seems like what we made only without stuffing it) and enjoy the sauce again:)

I made this tonight. The sauce is excellent. Due to laziness I used a grinder for the pecan and I guess the pecan bits are too fine so there's not much "nutty" taste. Next time I'll just chop the pecans coarsely.

My God!!!!!! This is heaven disney land winning the lottery and dying and going to heaven in the same dish. WOW WOW WOW. The only changes I made. I did not use clarified butter. I followed other suggestions of butter/olive oil. I cooked for 3 minutes on each side and then finished off in the oven. and I did the egg wash and added panko crumbs. This dish is out of this world. Oh ya also doubled the bourbon. FANTASTIC!!!!!!!

The recipe is great however breasts take too long to cook on the stove. I think cutlets are better for the stove. I will be looking at the other suggestions posted for cooking it more efficiently. The only negative that came from my son is that due to the sweetness he can only eat so much so we may cut back on the sugar.

Following the other leads I made my sauce before I cooked the chicken. Much easier. I used half the butter and still the taste was fantastic. I cooked the chicken in olive oil which is easier than clarifying butter. I served it with sauteed mushrooms and rice. I think spinach would have been a great addition. Everyone liked it.

This recipe was PHENOMINAL. We absolutely LOVED it. I used some of the others' suggestions: finely chopped pecans (so the mixture sticks to the chicken) either pounding out the chicken or cutting the breasts to make thinner pieces finishing the chicken in the oven at 350 and low sodium soy sauce. I am a Louisiana girl who loves good food. And this is one recipe I'll use again and again. Thanks!

This was a hit with my family!! They agreed that it was restaurant quality! The only things I would change next time would be to flatten the breasts before coating and deleting the addition of melted butter to the coating. I will just use the bread crumbs and pecan bits. Two Thumbs UP!!

This chicken dish was delicious. I ground the pecans in a coffee grinder and then mixed with the bread crumbs. Instead of using butter I mixed some egg whites with milk and dipped the chicken into this mixture. I then breaded the chicken with the nut/bread crumb mixture. I did not use any butter. I browned the breaded chicken in olive oil until lightly golden and then baked in a 350 degree oven for 25 minutes. Served with sauce. The chicken was so tender and juicy. This recipe is a keeper

Hammered the chicken to be thinner. Made the sauce in the same pan once chicken was removed. Added too much brown sugar - too sweet. But the chicken was moist. Served with mashed potatoes and beans.

I made this over long grain & wild rice w/o the green onion (not a big raw onion fan) & my husband mom & myself LOVED it. Did the clarified butter the melting then putting it in the fridge way. Used a little bit of olive oil to add a bit more lubricant. Such a good pretty easy recipe.

Very tasty recipe! I did not use clarified butter my mistake the coating did start to burn in the pan. I will deifinetly use clarified butter next time. The sauce had a WONDERFUL taste. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wished the sauce was thicker. I was expecting it to be more like the "glaze" you find in some restaurants. Still a great dish though!

Wow! This was better than I thought it was going to be. I used Candied Pecans and when I chopped them up for the coating I left a lot of big pieces in there (which was great when we ate it there were big bite size pieces). My husband loved it and gave it 5 stars!

Wasn't too thrilled with this recipe. After reading the reviews I decided to bread the chicken first in flour then egg/milk & then the pecan/crumb mixture. Breaded perfectly got it browned on the stove top but then I threw it in the oven to finish @ 350. I cut the sauce recipe in half but besides that followed it to a T. On the chicken itself it was pretty decent but by itself I didn't like it. If I make this sauce again I'll let the bourbon cook down more & probably add more brown sugar.

Instead of combining the butter with the pecans and bread crumbs I dipped the chicken in the butter and then the pecan crumb mixture...it just made more sense to me to help it stick. Next time I think I will add a little salt to the crumb mixture to taste. As the sauce was cooking I kept tasting it and it seemed very mustard-y to me but once it was on the chicken it tasted so much better. I didn't use clarified butter at all...I just melted it and used as is. I served the sauce separately so people would have the choice of using the sauce or not. Everyone raved about it! My husband couldn't say enough about how good it was. I found that it reheated very well; the sauce gets very thick like caramel while it's cold but once it's heated gets saucy again. I don't know if it would have still tasted as good reheated if the sauce were on it already. I served it with rice on the side which everyone put sauce on too. I will definitely be making this again.

This was an excellent recipe - definitely one of the very best I've found on this site. I ground the pecans in my little food processor to make it easier for them to stick to the chicken. I think next time I'll dip the chicken in a beaten egg mixture; I still had a few pecans that wouldn't stick. I didn't bother to clarify the butter and could not tell any difference. The recipe really does taste like it came from an upscale restaurant. We served it with chicken-flavored rice a green salad and crusty bread. Definitely a dish that can be served to company or for special occasions. We loved it!

Family loved it! I used my cast iron skillet. It was done quite quickly which is always nice but plan ahead if you have long-cooking rice to serve with it. Also I used ghee (I had made some prior) which I think is the same or similar to clarified butter. Loved the sauce too!

YUM! Definitely putting this into the dinner rotation not too often though because of the fat that must be in this...butter yummm...anyway I dipped my chicken in egg instead of in butter I thought it would stick better and it did I also baked this at 375 for 20 minutes (I pounded the chicken thin) instead of frying. The sauce is INCREDIBLE. Thanks so much!

This was a really delicious dish and my husband and company loved it. I made a few changes based on the reviews. I made the sauce the night before with only 2 T. of Dijon but did not change the other ingredietns. I did clarify the butter added it to the breadcrumb-pecan mixture and dredged the chicken breasts that I sliced in thinner pieces. I did not pound the chicken. I browned the chicken in the clarified butter earlier in the day so that I could finish it in the oven just in time to serve dinner. I reheated the chicken at 350 for 20 minutes with a little of the sauce on it. I only used 1/2 cup of butter and honestly I have nothing to compare it to but it was really rich with less butter. What a dish. Very impressive and if I had made the clarified butter a week ahead this would have almost been a simple dish. The chicken was tender and I will make this for special occasions because it is too rich for this to be a weekly meal. Thanks PGraff

We enjoyed the pecan crust. I didn't bother browning this in the frying pan and didn't use clarified butter. I basted my chicken in butter rolled in the pecan/crumb mixture and baked in the oven. Beautiful. The sauce wasn't a keeper for us but that could be my fault as the sauce was left last minute and didn't burn off enough of the alcohol so was a bit boozy.

This was one of the best meals I've made! Instead of the clarified butter I dipped the chicken in egg. I followed other suggestions and pan fried the chicken for a few minutes before finishing it in the oven. Served it on a bed of wilted spinach with roasted carrots and sweet potatoes. I poured sauce over everything. It was fantastic! I didn't eat the chicken but hubby loved it and I loved the sauce on the veggies. This recipe is an all star!

I LOVE this sauce. I simplified cooking the chicken because the frying in butter and trying to keep the pecans on seemed too difficult. I dipped the chicken in a beat egg then pressed it on both sides in a half bread crumb half pecan mxture and placed in a pan covered and baked. I had to press on some extra pecans because they don't stick easily. Then for the sauce I wanted to be healthier so I cut the butter by half and it was still delicious. Probably would be even better with all of the butter but I love the flavor with only half of the butter so I'm sticking with that! I have made this several times now and it is one of my favorites.

I was in a hurry to prepare so I took out the butter and just coated chicken with the pecans and bread crumbs. For the sauce all I had was salted butter and it still turned out great (although unsalted butter would have been better).

I pounded the chicken very thin seasoned it then dredged it in flour milk/egg and then the pecan/breadcrumbs. Don't forget to add some seasoning to the pecan mixture. After cooking the chicken on the stove for 5 or so minutes I finished it in the oven. Also I reduced the bourbon added orange juice to the sauce and cut back on butter. Absolutely delicious over whipped sweet potatoes and a pear/gorgonzola salad with orange juice/sherry dressing. Boyfriend scarfed it up!!

This was excellent. I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings for three large chicken breasts. I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results. The chicken was juicy the sauce was excellent. Next time I want to try using a tablespoon of olive oil to cook the chicken rather than the clarified butter.

Excellent. Use an egg white and a little milk to coat the chicken before pressing the crumb mixture on. Reduce the amount of mustard by 1/3 or add some sour cream. The full amount of mustard was much too strong. One tablespoon of butter was all that I used and it was fine.

This was really good. I cooked it on a lower heat setting than I usually do when frying things because the pecans started to look like they were going to burn. Keep a close watch on the temperature. I omitted the worscestershire sauce because I didn't have any. Other than that I scaled the recipe down for two and followed exactly. YUM!

I really enjoyed this recipe. The chicken was pretty standard but the sauce was really tasty. The one change I made is I only whisked in about half the amount of butter called for in the end. 3/4 cup of butter is a ton and I personally thought the taste and consistency was perfect without all of it.

The whole family enjoyed this. By mistake I breaded the chicken by dipping in egg & then into the pecan/bread crumb mixture (instead of following the recipe)---but it worked fine browning the chicken nicely. I also went by a previous reviewers suggestion and sauted the chicken for a few minutes on each side and then baking in 375 oven for about 20 min. Also as per several reviewers I doubled the sauce but ended up with too much--next time I won't double.

Wow....I have looked at this recipe several times and finally decided to make it tonight when I realized I had all of the ingredients on hand. All I have to say is I wish I had made it sooner. I didn't change a thing and this was AWESOME!! I did find that the larger chunks of pecans weren't sticking to the chicken so I just tossed them in with the chicken in the pan and the toasted flavor was great. We'll be eating this quite often! Try it...

Yum! I used seasoned Italian bread crumbs and pounded my chicken breasts so they would cook evenly. I doubled the pecan mixture like suggested and was glad I did. I served the bourbon sauce on the side for dipping. My son & I didn't like it but my daugter and husband did. The chicken is EXCELLENT without it. Will make again!:)

This was ok. The sauce was very mustardy for my taste and I had a hard time getting the pecans to stick well to the chicken. My wife liked it a lot more than I did.

Breading mix didn't want to stick to chicken. I wonder if flour and or eggs on the chicken first would make it stick. My husband thought sauce was too sweet so I would use less sugar next time. Though overall it was good and definitely easy and quick to make.

Really simple!' I used a tablespoon of olive oil n tablespoon of unsalted butter to sautée. I also only used a half cup butter in the sauce. It tastes great no problems sticking to the pan. It's real sweet maybe try less sugar. Loved it!!

The sauce was amazing! It was so complex and delicious on the chicken. A bit messy but we all agreed totally worth it. Next time I will get thinner chicken because they took a while to fry. A great very impressive dish!

This was fantastic. Next time I will finish it in the oven as other posters suggested. (It did scorch it a little in the pan though I think that was my own short-coming not recipe related) I also might add some panko to the breading I like the light cripness I hope that will add to the recipe. I also think I will garnish it with some coarsely chopped pecans before serving. My 6 year old and husband both liked this one a lot.

This recipe sounded delicious but I have to say for the extra steps of clarifying butter and dicing pecans it was no better than the traditional method of making chicken cutlets with Progresso breadcrumbs and olive oil. The Dijon mustard in the Bourbon sauce was overpowering for the delicate taste of the pecan breading.

I made this recipe yesterday for the first time. I felt that adding 3/4 cup of butter to the sauce was way too much so I cut it down to maybe 1/4 cup. This dish was a HUGE hit. The chicken was extremely moist and the sauce absolutely delish! The compliments were over the top with requests for the recipe. It's definitely a keeper and I will make it again!

This was an amazing recipe. I make sauteed chicken with some kind of coating including pecans quite frequently but the bourbon sauce makes it. I served with mashed potatoes and green beans. I will definitely make this one again.

One of the best chicken dishes I have ever made. This is DEFINATELY a company dish. It's really that good. I used the egg to coat before patting the pecan mixture and had no trouble with the breading sticking. Next time I will use olive oil to brown the coating the butter burned and made the first batch of chicken breasts too dark. finishing in the oven is key to prevent the breasts from drying out. Juices literally ran from the breast when I cut it was so tender. Great recipe!

Very good. I did follow the advice of others and brown it on the stove top and finish it off in the oven at 350 degrees for about 30 mins. I scored the meat with a knife before I breaded it and it seemed to help it stick a little better. I will be making this again. The sauce would be good on steak!

I have to agree. This is a fantastic recipe. When I made it I pan fried the chicken for a few minutes on each side and finished it off in the oven since some of my pieces were thick. The sauce is excellent but so much butter! Not something I'll add to my weekly routine but nice for something fancy.

This was very tasty!  Followed the recipe exactly except butterflied the breast halves as they were too thick. So, had to make another batch of coating. I pressed it firmly onto both sides and it stuck great. Used panko and chopped pecans myself in the food processor for very fine crumbs. The sauce is SO rich and tasty - wish we had some potatoes to soak it up. For leftovers, we'll do just that!

I made this last night for the first time for my birthday and there were zero left-overs. Always a good sign with a new recipe! Awesome recipe but needs a little tweaking. The clarified butter / breadcrumbs / pecans mixture will not stick as many other reviewers have noted. Another reviewer recommended using egg and milk. Next time I make it I will definitely use milk which is what I normally use when I'm breading anything. The butter just wouldn't grab on. Since I had limited pecans and so much of the crust fell off I scooped the excess pecan mix into the sauce (personal taste). It made the sauce much thicker like a thick glaze and it was delicious. I did need to add some extra bourbon WS and a bit of hot water to thin it out a little bit but the topping was perfect and I didn't lose any pecans.

This was an amazing recipe. I did some subtle changes that did not affect the flavor. I just used crushed pecans and eliminated the bread crumbs. I also use egg beaters original as the dip before rolling in the pecans. I did the breasts in the oven on 375 on an elevated rack so the whole breast was exposed to the heat. As for the sauce I used a sweet honey spicy brown mustard and upped the bourbon to 3 1/2 tbs. I will make this again.

Very good flavor - but I agree with other reviewers - add a egg wash to the chicken before coating with pecan/bread crumb mixture to that it stays on the chicken and also brown on all sides and finish cooking in the oven.

What a delicious way to enjoy chicken! So happy to find a chicken recipe that is so different no cheese no tomatoes or mushrooms. Flavorful tender juicy-awesome. I changed nothing EXCEPT to use meat mallet and pounded chicken breast to a reasonable thickness for quicker more efficient cooking may require a bit shorter cooking time. I can't wait to do this chicken recipe again! My husband loved it as well I even cut the recipe down to accommodate the two of us. I had no trouble with preparation.

This recipe was okay at best. I think if the chicken would have been marinated in the sauce and then grilled or baked it would have been better - it was only okay. A lot of effort for an okay meal with a lot of calories. The sauce was runny and not appealing to the eye. It would have been better if you fried the chicken for a short time placed on a cookie sheet drizzled the sauce and baked. This might make all the difference in the world but like I said before - a lot of messing around for an OK dish and I will not make it again.

This was fantastic! As newlyweds entertaining the family on our first Christmas together we wanted to make something other than the standard ham or turkey...an this was an absolute hit! We used regular butter and browned each side in the skillet (about 5 minutes per side ) then finished it in the oven as others suggested. Too rich to have all the time but will definitely make again!

Amazing! A hit with our guests. In the future I would just brown the chicken both sides and then put in the oven for 25-30 minutes (our chicken breasts were from Costco and huge). Definitely will make it again.

I always make this dish to impress! Not complicated but tastes like it came out of a fancy restaurant. One of my husband's favorite dishes. Serve with mashed potatoes absolutely delicious.

Great recipe! The Dijon added a nice kick. The green onions are a must because they balance out the sweetness of the mustard. Thank you!

okay heads up---i bought organic whole pecans...when i put them in my grinder they were so moist so fabulous they literally clogged the blades. of course they tasted great but anyone using fresh organic please be aware not to use any liquid...these pecans are the not dried out stale pos found in many bins they are moist & beautiful. after dealing with the grinder i chopped a bunch finely yes but hand chopped to add to the ground so that the pecans were not entirely a paste & would look pretty once toasted. next i marinated the chicken thighs & tits in organic greek yogurt fresh ginger hot peppers garlic & maple syrup over night next morning i put the tits in a bath of scotch (dh hates bourbon loves scotch) maple syrup fresh ginger hot peppers freshly pressed organic garlic. the chicken lounged in the bath while i made the rest of the plates: flour & cornstarch pepper red pepper flakes egg with garlic ginger freshly chopped jalapeño heavy cream & a plate of panko & another of the freshly crunched pecans seasoned with rpflakes. & i began the sauce: honey mustard dijion maple syrup with a tblsp of dark brown sugar a splash of brandy 3 tblsps scotch the tamari worcheshire a hit of hot sauce fresh ginger garlic set that on a slow med low simmer once the sauce began to bubble removed & added the butter pieces 1/2 C along with a little heavy cream i had waiting to be useful. preheated the oven to 350. began my dredging: out of the scotch b

I struggled with getting the chicken breasts fried. There didn't seem to be enough butter in the pan to fry both sides and I had to reduce the number of breasts from 8 to 6. Again there just wasn't enough room in the pan. I did like the flavor of the breading though and will definitely keep working with it. The bourbon sauce was fantastic! I plan to make it again to put on oven roasted pork tenderloin and chicken breasts. Watch your mustard though. It can quickly overpower the sauce if you have even a little bit over that quarter cup.

We decided to coat the chicken with egg yolk instead of butter. We also used tenderloins instead of chicken breasts. When we made the sauce we added only a 1/4 cup of butter and a tsp of more bourbon. It was very tasty!

Delicious! My whole family enjoyed which is quite the accomplishment with one meal. I omitted the pecans for the members of the family who don't like nuts but I can't imagine this without them. Everything else I did as written. I usually read the reviews but didn't have time this evening and for once I don't care what others suggest because it's perfect as written. I will be putting this one in our favorites recipe book. Thanks PGRAFF!

I was a little like Le'Veon Bell I took the recipe and ran with it. When it came to frying the chicken I included 3/4 of a cup of sliced mushrooms some of the finely chopped green onions with the butter. As the chicken mushrooms and onion cooked I sprinkled the remaining breadcrumbs and pecans over the mixture. It had the interesting effect of almost breading the mushrooms as they cooked. I kept a close eye on the mixture to make sure it didn't burn and at one point added a little more butter. When it came to the sauce I followed the recipe except I added about a 1/4 cup of bourbon and about a 1/4 of maple syrup. wisked it all together and then brought to a simmer and let it cook down a bit. Once I was happy with the consistency I added the butter. In retrospect this is a lot of butter. The next time I'm going to reduce the amount of butter and subsititute chicken broth. The downside of this is I will have to cook the sauce down a bit more to get the consistency I'm looking for. I served it over a bed of cooked white rice with a side of mixed vegetables. The next time I'm going to try wild rice. I think the nutty flavour of the wild rice will add to the presentation and flavour The chopped green onions as a garnish were important I'm told as they added a balancing flavour. First recipe I ever cooked that ended up in my wife's cookbook.

When I made this I didn't get the pecans chopped fine enough so my breading didn't really stay on but other than that this was DIVINE! Next time I will run the pecans through the chopper to make sure they are the same consistency as the bread crumbs.

This was EXCEPTIONAL! I too added olive oil to saute the chicken so it wouldn't burn. Probably the best chicken dish I've ever had... and yes don't forget the onions on top. Served it with roasted asparagus and a romaine salad. A definite favorite for my guests!

This was so good. I did as a lot of people said and used less soy sauce etc. I also added a little more brown sugar to the sauce and cut back on the butter. I had purchased "light" butter and it really did come out delicious still. This is a keeper absolutely.

This was OK but not outstanding. My hubby thought the sauce was too sweet. I thought it was OK but way too much trouble for a mediocre result. I had a hard time getting the butter to incorporate into the sauce. After getting about half melted and mixed in the sauce had cooled too much to melt any more. I was hoping for a knockout dish and left the table disappointed. I will not make this again.

I've made this several times now and it is DELICIOUS definitely a "10". This is my favorite chicken dish. I followed the instructions exactly and it turned out perfect. The second time I pulsed the pecans a little longer in the food processor until they came out almost like a paste (do not not this). Still came out great... but you want the pecan finely chopped don't over do it in a processor.

This is a GREAT recipe! I made only a couple of changes: I pounded the breasts to make them thinner and dipped them in an egg and milk wash before the crumb coating. I had no problem with coating not staying on with that. I didn't bother to clarify the butter before frying the cutlets. Also added a little more brown sugar to the sauce as it was a bit too tart for my taste. This is a lovely dish for company.

We loved the recipe. I'm always looking for recipes with pecans because my husband's family has a pecan orchard. I cooked this for everyone and it was a success. Husband LOVES it and even my Father-In-Law (meat and potato man) loved it! Suggestions: Pound out the chicken breasts = extra tender and cooks evenly/fast; Doubled the sauce and used extra for dipping because everyone LOVED it so much.

This recipe was okay. The sauce was too mustardy which overpowered the whole bourbon flavor. The pecan and bread crumb mix did not cover the chicken well. Overall this is good for mustard lovers but it's a hassle.

Very simple recipe with limited ingredients provided a great bourbon sauce. Definitely need to make sure to understand the clarified butter. The chicken ends up with great flavor with limited seasoning although the longer cook time in a frying pan did leave in a little darker than pictured. My assumption is my attempt to create clarified butter was less than successful. Definitely will be trying this dish again.

I belong to a a neighbourhood group that get together each month for a dinner party each month a different person hosts dinner this month was my turn. We are always looking for new ideas to impress our guests. So I thought I would go for a Southern-themed meal. The chicken was a huge success everyone asked for the recipe and they wondered how a full time mom could throw together such a gourmet meal for 10. This recipe was probably the best chicken I have ever had one of my friends pulled me aside to say that the meal was the best she had ever had in her entire life. I don't spend a lot of time in the kitchen but this looked easy and yummy. I served it with a spinach salad with snow peas candied pecans and a poppy seed dressing as a starter then with the chicken green beens and butternut squash. For dessert a carrot cake (ok bought this as I am not a baker) anyway love love love this recipe. Two thumbs up!

Great recipe! It was easy to make and my wife and I loved it! I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut the recipe in half. I also used Texas pecan praline whiskey and the sauce was delicious. I will however probably use regular unflavored whiskey next time to cut the sweetness a little.

It would be a 1 star but I swapped out the chicken for tofu and the breading for sawdust, candy corn for corn, and my recipe for the whole recipe. Seriously, is you made it as it was written, rate it as it was written!

And I did! Other than"the boy" who likes thin breading or KFC, we all enjoyed it as written. I feared "the "gravy" would be worstershershersher sauce heavy in flavour but it was sweet and buttery. 

Served over rice, I would make this again.

Use clarified butter as indicated or melt and get rid of as much of the milk solids as you can. I halved large chicken breasts used 50% less sodium tamari and didn't bother with the green onions (not needed). I only used 1/2 cup of unsalted butter and it tasted great. I served this with roasted butternut squash which was a great accompaniment.

I used thick chicken breasts when I made this recipe and I knew they would require oven time to cook all the way through. The key to cooking this recipe as written in the frying pan is to use thin or pounded chicken breasts which will result in a crispier crust which is preferable in my opinion. The clarified butter is used so the chicken won't burn because it has a higher smoking point. It doesn't change the flavor and regular butter is probably fine if you are only frying for a couple minutes then putting it in the oven. To pan fry the entire time you will need clarified butter or an olive oil/butter combo as others suggest. Finally the sauce is amazing. I will cut down on the butter in the sauce by about a third next time so the other flavors stand out a little more. This is a delicious dish in the oven or on the stove but try to fry it if you can!

All I want is to leave a comment. It sounds ok but I did not make it. The comment: you should be able to buy clarified butter in the Asian section of your supermarket. It is called Ghee and Indian cooking uses a lot of it.

Seriously i read and re-read the directions and I just don't know where i went wrong. While the chicken cooked the pecan and breadcrumb topping began to char and stick to the pan. The sauce was too sweet for my husband. He added A LOT of ground pepper to the chicken and the sauce. But now all this has spawned a whole new recipe that with a few adjustments should be perfect for us--something very like Poulet au poivre which is well awesome THANKS!

The bourbon sauce is amazing but definitely takes time to put all the butter in. I have a sister-in-law who can't have glutton so I made her chicken with all pecan and no bread crumbs for the crust. I tried the all pecan crust and thought it might be even better like that.

It was as though the flavors neutralized one another! I made this recipe for my mom that was visiting from out of town...because of all the rave reviews I figured it must be great. The directions were followed exactly as stated in the recipe. We both took a couple of bites and then agreed the chicken had no flavor. It was definitely moist but that was about the only positive thing we felt about it.

Very very good. I added water and some more butter as the chicken was cooking to avoid it burning (I tend to burn chicken when I cook it on the stovetop) but besides that followed exactly and our guests asked for the recipe. Even better the next day for lunch!! Thanks for a great one!

Excellent! I took another person's advice & made the Strawberry Romaine salad I (from this site) to accompany this dish. It was a wonderful dinner that was enjoyed by all.

This recipe was amazing! I made it for a dinner party and the chicken came out perfect. Very moist and the breading was fantastic. I didn't have any problems with the pecans although maybe it's because I chopped them with a very fine chopper. Delicious!

The sauce was a little rich for our tastes! I only put in half of the amount of butter for the sauce and I think that was PLENTY. My boyfriend said he tasted too many strong flavors in the sauce that didn't seem to want to blend and I tend to agree. However it was still good (in small amounts!) and the chicken itself was fabulous. I'll definitely make the chicken again with the pecan breading--yum! Thanks for the recipe!

Somehow I had managed to run out of soy sauce so I just added some extra salt. I also finished cooking the chicken breasts in the oven they were large breasts and I don't have a large frying pan so that was easier for me. Everyone loved it! I usually dislike reheating chicken (it just tastes bad to me) but this was great the next day. Next time I'll make more sauce everyone couldn't get enough!

Hate to be the voice of dissension. I followed the recipe exactly. I couldn't get the coating to stay on the chicken. Hubby a pecan lover said he would eat it but to not ever make it again. Thanks anyway.

Awesome!The sauce is to die for it really has a complex flavor. It makes the dish. I also opted not to do the clarified butter...I just used half butter half vegetable oil and it worked fine. You have to play with the heat a little to make sure your breading stays on but once you have the heat right it's not a problem.

Great recipe! The butter and pecan in the breading was the perfect consistency to stick to the chicken for frying. I also made a vegetarian version for my roommate using tofu. The only change that needs to be made is that you must use a beaten egg to coat the tofu before dipping in the pecan/bread-crumb mixture because doesn't have the same sticky consistency of chicken. Putting both the breaded chicken and the tofu into the fridge for a half an hour before frying worked well as suggested by another user. The sauce for this recipe is what really put it over the top. It's an incredibly rich powerful flavor and I couldn't eat it every day but it's PERFECT for a special occasion or to impress a special someone..

Not really sure why this recipe got such a high rating but I thought it was just OK. Hubby thought the chicken was ok but did not like the saice. I think the sauce had too much mustard. We wont be making this again- it was too much trouble for just mediocre results.

One of my family's new favorites. I followed the other suggestions.. didn't clarify the butter. Also pan fried then baked the chicken. It always comes out so moist. Fabulous!

This was delicious!!!!!! The only changes that I made were to sauce. I used pure maple syrup and two Tbs of dijoin to make the sauce. I wanted more of a sweeter sauce.

Even though this is a bit more involved than most recipes the end result is so worth it. I loved the green onions and the sauce is to die for.

I liked the pecans in the coating. I doubled the sauce. I also browned the chicken in the pan and finished it in the oven.  Very tasty. Will make this again.
