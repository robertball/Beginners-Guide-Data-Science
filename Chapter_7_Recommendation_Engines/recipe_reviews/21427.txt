We enjoyed this version of Vienna Schnitzel and I would make it again--A tip you might try--After coating the meat place on plate--Cover with plastic wrap and put in "Frig." for @ least 1/2 hour--The coating will stick much better--This was advice from my German Father-in-Law

Yum!  Easy to prepare and tasty to eat.  I didn't have cake flour, so I used all-purpose with good results.  I also just pan-fried in canola oil.  Served with Stacey's Fabulous Purple Potato Gratin and Roasted Asparagus with Shallots.  Very flavorful meal!

DO NOT precook your chicken. Slice your chicken breast and using a kitchen mallet pound the meat out thin. Try sprinkling meat with garlic salt and paprika prior to breading it. My husband is Hungarian where Schnitzel is a very popular. You can use pork, veal or chicken. We serve this with whipped potatoes, cucumber salad, pickled red peppers or dill pickles. Yum!

This was amazing! It fried up crispy and perfect. I coated the meat, and then let it rest in the fridge for half an hour, and the breading stuck perfectly. I worked in small batches and moved the finished schnitzels to a rack in a warm oven, and they stayed crisp and perfect until dinner was ready. I served them with "German Spaetzle Dumplings" from this site, and lemon wedges to squeeze over the schnitzel, and it was fantastic! We used to go out to a Bavarian/Bohemian restaurant in the area for schnitzel and spaetzle and spend a small fortune on dinner. Now I know I can make just as good at home for half the price (or less!). Thanks for this great recipe.

This is great! I seasoned the meat with salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika before breading. Also served with lemons to squeeze on top. Perfect texture! Goes great with red cabbage and potatoes.

Great recipe.  The breading has a perfect texture.  I added 1/2 pkg of french onion soup mix to the bread crumbs, gave it a little more flavour, but if doing so be careful not to over salt because the soup mix is pretty salty.  YUM:)

Great Recipe!!!  We topped it with a roux made from stock using the neck bones (1 cup stock, 1 cup heavy cream, butter, flour, pepper, and salt.)

Excellent!  My husband likes breaded veal, so this is just the recipe I was looking for.  I have tried other, "pan fry" methods and they just weren't crispy enough.  I'm not a veal person, and I enjoyed it cooked this way as well.  I will be sure to try it with pork next.

Very easy to make this recipe that sounds so fancy.  I didn't use Panko bread crumbs like some of the reviewers suggested, and it came out just fine.  The lemon juice squeezed on top worked out well.

I followed recipe exactly, pounding meat to thinness, flouring, egg wash, using plain bread crumbs, deep frying and serving it with lemon.  It was very good (especially adding the lemon juice - never tried that before!) - but it tasted almost exactly like regular fried breaded pork chops.  I've had vienna schnitzel in restaurants and their breading is outrageous (somewhat puffy - I can't explain it!!!) - have to find out what they use for that.  I will cook this again since we liked the thinness and it cooked so quickly - try the lemon over the top!!! Thanks Frank. Update!  I am updating this review and changing my 4 stars to five stars. In my search to duplicate what I've had in restaurants I tried making it with PANKO breadcrumbs and it was outrageous!!!  I've actually become addicted to PANKO crumbs and so has my family.  I use them almost all the time now when I bread chicken or pork.  I don't care for them when breading veal cutlets (Italian style breadcrumbs win out for that) but two thumbs up for pork and chicken!!! If you can't find them in the supermarket (I couldn't) - buy it online from an Asian grocer.  The crumbs normally come in cellephane bags.  I'll buy ten bags at a time - as long as the bags are unopened they stay fresh.  Try it fellow chefs!

One of the best recipes I've ever made from this site. Was absolutely fabulous. If I could, I'd give it a trillion stars. Lemon juice over the finished product is the key. Served with red cabbage and mashed potatoes...AWESOME!!!

the vienna schnitzel is a brillient recipe and i still cant understand how someone could come up with the idea.  I found the best results are with chicken breasts pre-cooked and then cooled.

This is as delicious as my "Oma's" schnitzel was. She'd be proud! Having grown up eating almost nothing but Austrian and German foods, this brought back a lot of comforting memories. Thanks Frank!

It's a night of 'firsts'.  I've prepared a hundred recipes from this site, and never felt the need to review one.... until now.  I don't like my own cooking and certainly never clean my plate.... until now.  This recipe is awesome.  I ate every last bit of it, and wish there were leftovers (same goes for my husband).  My family is German/Austrian/Hungarian, so I grew up eating schnitzel.  I've been to Vienna many times, and had more than my share of "authentic" Wiener schnitzel.  This recipe is soooooo good.  Changes:  used boneless pork chops.  Didn't have cake flour, so used bread flour instead.  Seasoned the flour with salt, pepper, and paprika (rather than seasoning the eggs).  Used Italian bread crumbs.  Didn't use any milk.  Also (sort of) took another reviewer's advice:  after breading the pork, I dumped the extra flour on a plate and put the breaded pork on it and refrigerated for about 10 minutes - the breading stuck to it like a champ.  Deep fried at 360 for 3 minutes.  Served with lemon juice.  The coating was crisp, the meat was juicy.  Awesome.  Thank you.

Although this was good, it didn't taste anything like the schnitzel I've had at my local German restaurants. I'm going to keep looking for *the* recipe, but I will probably make this again because it was pretty tasty. Thanks!

Best Schnitzel we have had since our visit to Vienna.  We recommend using a deep fryer instead of pan frying for a more authentic flavor.

This is a great schnitzel recipe as is, or can be a good foundation to do your own thing. First I brined the pork fillets in 4 cups of water, 1/4 cup salt, 1/4 cup sugar, and probably 1/4 to 1/3 cup of lemon juice. Next I minced one sprig of rosemary and added to the flour. I also subbed half regular bread crumbs and half panko that were chopped up finer in a food processor to get things a bit more crispy. After breading, I let the pork sit in a fridge for 30 minutes as per GERRILKY's advice, and it definitely helped keep the coating on the pork. It took about 3-4 minutes per side to get the schnitzel cooked perfect. I served with roasted asparagus and risotto.

LOVE this recipe!  Make sure you pound the pork even flatter than you think you need to, meat plumps when cooking.

I just came across this recipe and had to review it. I am from Germany and have made this very same recipe for many, many years. Before I flour the meat I genereously sprinkle with pepper and a little salt instead of seasoning the egg mixture. I pan fry the Schnitzel in a skillet with quite a bit of oil. Sit the finished Schnitzel on a paper towel to drain off some of the fat. I make it with pork chops, veal scallopini and I also love making it with thinly pounded chicken breasts. My three year old daughter LOVES!!!! this recipe - so does everyone else. There are no exotic flavors - just pure comfort food.

I don't deep fry this. I brown them in about 3 Tb. oil and cook on low until done. Sometimes I remove it to a baking sheet and finish in the oven. Just to cut down on the fat intake and it works just as well. I have also pounded the pork cutlets, dipped in beaten egg, salt and pepper then just dip in finely ground saltine cracker crumbs delicious and easy!

This is the same way that my Oma (grandma) taught me how to make Schnitzel. If you are looking for a little bit of flavor, try using italian bread crumbs. And don't forget to add a little bit of lemon juice to it once it's on your plate. That's what really brings out the flavors. This has been my favorite thing to eat since I was a little girl and now it's my son's favorite.

I love schnitzel.  My parents brought it back with them when my dad was stationed in Germany and we grew up on it.  It is the best.  The draw back of course being, it is a big mess and not the healthiest.  For taste though, it can't be beat.  My recipe is very similar to this, however I don't flour my meat.

Not hard to make and my German ancestry wife said it tasted as good as her Auntie's who was from Vienna. Used cake flour and panko bread crumbs but forgot the milk. Fried in olive oil in an electric fry pan. I put lemon juice over mine. Delicious

Perfect.  I know this recipe as "Milanesa" and usually prepare it with beef.  This was a delicious and foolproof recipe and I will use it again and again.  My 4-year old completed the whole process with me and when I flipped the schnitzels over to reveal them golden brown he said, "THIS IS AWESOME!"  It was priceless.

Great, flavorful, and easy!  We didn't deep fry ours, but rather, sauteed in olive oil.  I rubbed the pork with a mixture of garlic powder, chili powder, salt, and black pepper, and used the tenderloin cut.

Awesome authentic Schnitzel...I made this last week for a Christmas dinner party for 21. It was the talk of the party. My Husbands family is from Stein, Germany and I wanted to make something nice for them. My Mother-in-law raved over how good this was. She called everyone in Germany and told them what a great cook I am ! I served it with german potato salad & sauerkraut and fresh green beans with bacon. Thanks so much for this recipe. It is GREAT....

This was a very good schnitzel recipe.  I used rice crispies in place of bread crumbs, which made it extra crispy and tasty.  A bit too greasy for my taste, but it is schnitzel after all, and a great one at that!

Wow, these were so good.  I made with chicken, steak and pork, and they were all delicious.  I ate two, my husband ate four.  My daughter and my niece loved them too.  I will make these again and again.  Yum.

I made this tonight and followed the recipe nearly word for word... it was amazing! Instead of pork I used chicken, and cooked the fillet in a frying pan. It turned out incredibly flavorful and moist. Maybe the best piece of chicken I've made to date! A+!

I made this tonight for the first time.  I used CAKE FLOUR (found at the Food Lion, much more fine then regular flour, no, don't use corn meal. too thick), a few EGGS and splashes of milk as well as 4C seasoned bread crumbs.  I used my garage mallet to flatten roughly 12 nice sized SIRLOIN CHOPS while they were (one at a time) inside a heavy plastic bag (freezer bag).  Some of them I had to cut in half because I only have a little Fry Daddy.  I then patted them in the flour and rinsed them through the egg/milk before mushing them in the crumbs.  Once nicely coated, I folded them into layers in a heavy platic wrap (Great Value brand at the Walmart) and put them into the fridge for as close to a half hour as my family could wait.   Someone in another review had that recommendation - I endorse it.   I am used to using a little chill before cooking so know it makes sense.    Watch out how long you have them in the hot oil, 5 - 7 minutes is plenty.  Judge the color of the brown crumbs - too dark is well done.  Pork should be cooked through so make sure you watch.    My wife invited the neighbors over to sample - everyone wanted seconds..!!  They even ate the mixed veggies I made with..!   Pefect entre and wonderful part of any meal.

Amazing recipe! It was a huge hit in my house! The only alteration I made was using crushed Melba toast instead of breadcrumbs. The reason I did this was only because I realized too late that I didn't have enough breadcrumbs for all 6 cuts of pork. The Melba toast made for a crunchier coating, but that actually improved it for me! I also found that a cup of flour was a huge waste! Next time I will use only about half a cup flour for the coating. Definately will make again, probably three or four times a month!!

We used fillets from a turkey breast; tender, savory, paper thin cutlets stayed tasty and moist in their crispy, mellow breading. A squeeze or two from a lemon wedge helped wake the dish up a bit, as well. With the simplicity of ingredients (though, and maybe it was just me, the cake flour seemed to make a big difference), this recipe is more about technique than anything else, and it's a technique a plan on mastering by cooking this over and over again.

EXCELLENT recipe. Whenever I come home from school, my parents beg on their knees for me to make them this schnitzel! I recommend using crushed saltines as bread crumbs, but because they add some extra saltiness, adjust the rest of the salt accordingly.  Happy cooking!

Very good recipe.  However, it is REALLY important to let the cutlets sit in the frig after flouring for 20 minutes or so.  It gives much better staying power for the breading to stick.  Also, watch using store bought spiced breadcrumbs (e.g. "italian seasoned breadcrumbs")...plain breadcrumbs then seasoned with a bit of parsley, garlic, salt and pepper work really well.  Finally, pork cutlets work just as well as veal--it's purely dependent on your taste.  Pound them thin and you'll be sure to book them quick and easy.  Tasty!

MMM!  Works great with pork cube steak or beef cube steak. I rolled mine in corn flour, then in the egg/milk batter, then italian breadcrumbs. Terrific!

Not what we were looking for.  We just came back from Germnay and are looking for the same Schnitzel auf Wiener art we found there.  While this recipe is pretty, and tastes O.K. it is really lacking in the final flavor and spice department.  It's probably good if you are not a spice person but for us it needs something extra.

So good!  My husband had two servings and even the kids ate it.  Great idea about the lemon.  Ketchup for the kids. Used Panko crumbs and all purpose flour. Didn't use as much oil so I had to make sure it was cooked through.

I didn't have any cake mix so I used buttermilk pancake mix instead.
Taking the advice to use some lemon I was going to make a lemon sauce but wasn't feeling THAT ambitious.
I had leftover gravy from the Garlic Pork Roast recipe as well as a little garlic lemon (or lime) gravy I made from the Grecian Pork Tenderloin recipe (I'm a big fan of this recipe site!) I combined the two and WAHLA, as we say here in the tropics.
The chops turned out nice and tender, crispy and puffy and the gravy added just the right touch!
excellent recipe!

This is an excellent recipe.  I have made it a few times now and have liked it each time.  Pounding the pork thin really makes a huge difference.  I have had a similar recipe where the pork is not thin and it really is not quite as good.  The ratio of crust to pork is too small.  I serve this with steak sauce for those in my family who like to have a sauce on everything!  Thanks for sharing!

I tried this twice, and it just didn't work out. Maybe it was the meat I bought, maybe it was my technique, I don't know.  :-(

very good, basic traditional starter recipe. Very light, all members of the family enjoyed it. For those people out there that like a heavier flavor to their meat, you can season the the crumbs with a bit of paprika and seasoning salt. Keep in mind though, once you start making additions to the recipe, you will loose the authentic original taste of the dish.

This is terrific!    I was mainly looking for a way to make really nice crispy cutlets, and this was perfect.   Made a few adjustments:    Used chicken breast pounded thin.    For bread, used panko bread crumbs, to which we added granulated garlic and a bit of paprika.
     After coating, we let rest in fridge for 30 minutes as suggested.
     We cooked in peanut oil, as it has a high smoke point, and is very nice to sutee/fry like this.
     After cooking, we removed the chicken from the skillet, and made a mushroom gravy - a cup or so of chopped fresh mushrooms sauteed about 5 minutes until softened; added a couple tablespoons of flour, and heated until flour was light brown.    Added 1/2 cup skim milk, and 1/2 c fat-free sour cream, and cooked until thick.    Season with salt & pepper and other seasonings as desired.   Very quick and easy.
     We didn't finish all of the chicken the first night, so we had left overs next night, and they reheated beautifully in the oven, and the coating stayed nice and crip and YUMMY!      
     We will be making this many more times with chicken or pork (or other meats.)     Highly recommend!

I'm not sure why you need all the milk?? I just whisked the egg and it was fine, but I've never added milk to egg when used as a binder. Maybe I've been doing it wrong. I also mixed 1/2 Panko brdcrmbs w/ italian brdcrmbs because they hold together better while frying and stay super crisp tossed it w/ parm.cheese.. YUMMY! Made a mushroom sauce to top them with out of thanksgiving mushrooms I had leftover. Squirted a bit of lemon juice at the end... Thanks for the great idea! I had 1/2 a pork loin from a cpl days ago I needed to make into something and this hit the spot! Pounding it out makes it go a long way, made 7 good size pieces...Kids 4-12 loved it! (Minus the mushrooms :)

This is a great basic schnitzel recipe. The key is to really make sure that the flour and bread crumbs are pressed into the pork well so the breading doesn't fall off during or after cooking. Using enough salt and pepper makes a difference too. I used more than 2 cups of italian bread crumbs and probably more flour too, but also had almost 2 pounds of pork. The pork was thin sliced pork loin chops, which I cooked on a little hotter than a medium temp (almost medium-high) on my gas stove at 2 minutes per side in about 1/2 of oil in a deep skillet.
Oh, and make sure to have plenty of paper towels on hand to soak up the grease after it's cooked or the oil will take over the flavor of the schnitzel.

The proportions of this recipe are perfect.  I'm always wasting flour, eggs and breadcrumbs when I guess.  I used thin pork chops which worked perfectly. For a gravy I used the leftover sauce from "Beef Tips and Noodles" from this site.  It was so tasty!

It was ok. I used veal, and some pieces were good, others tough and dry. I think it was because the thickness of the meat was a bit variable. I think pork would be better. The coating seemed to absorb quite a lot of oil as well.

Left out the cake flour and used Panko crumbs instead. Also pounded the boneless pork chops very thin. This was good but uninspiring. My husband said, "pork fritters." The reason for the four rating is only because everything was eaten and there were no leftovers. For taste, I would rate it closer to a 3 or 3.5*. I think garlic powder might jazz things up a bit.

This recipe is a must.  I use pork tenderloin and pound it very thin as it browns very fast in the deepfryer. I also use all-purpose flour instead of cake flour. Fresh lemon is a must.  My husband no longer wants to go out for dinner.  Even my kids love it.

I made this for my boyfriend for a Valentine meal.  I wasn't sure what to expect but it turned out delicious.  I think next time I might cut the pork in smaller pieces before I pound them because they get huge.  My boyfriend says they remind him of pork fritters.  I fried them in a little bit of oil, not a deep fryer.  I think left overs would be good between some bread, as a sandwhich.  I'm glad I came across this recipe.  I'll definately make it again.

My gran always made this for the whole family and to this day it remains one of family favorites. When I introduced my Cypriot hubby to it (he is very picky with his food), he loved it so much that he now insists I make it at least once a week. I would highly recommend it as it seems to be one of those all time favorites.

Son's a very picky eater but he loves these. Doesn't believe he's eating pork, lol  - that good! I used a half-cup of milk here on my second time around with this recipe so I could get a good healthy dunking for all the pieces. Also did 1 cup bread crumbs and 1 cup Panko for a little more crispiness. Use a countdown timer or your fitbit for the two-minute intervals and they'll come out perfect if your oil temp is right.

Made these for a dinner party at my house. One of my guests was from Germany and her and her hubby said they reminded them of a schnitzel they had in Austria! The Schnitzel was delicious! I followed the suggestion of adding a little paprika and garlic powder to season the pork, and let them sit in the fridge, covered for an hour or two, before frying. The batter was perfect and stuck to the schnitzel perfectly!

When I make this, I buy pork cutlets, so there's no need to pound them. I do sprinkle them with lemon juice and let them sit for 10 minutes; then, continue on with the instructions as written. I'm making this tonight, and will try the suggestions to refrigerate the coated-dipped-coated cutlets for 30 minutes, so they'll remain crispy!

Added some spices to the egg and milk: cayenne, lemon pepper, onion powder. Used a mix of panko and homemade breadcrumbs. Cooked 2 min on each side. Grilled onions and fried egg on top. Great meal. Want to try veal next time.

My family liked these. But I wanted to suggest this: Try complementing it with cranberry sauce when you serve it. When I lived in Austria this was always served on the side. A great recipe is here on allrecipes titled Cranberry Relish I. It was a hit for Thanksgiving and goes great with this wiener schnitzel. (Warning, the recipe listed makes a large batch.)

I lived in Germany for about 6 years and my husband lived in Germany around 12 years. Each region has their own style (we loved them all), but this is by far the best recipe that we have tried in the states. We thought the cake flour was a little different, but decided to go with it. However, we do not like bread crumbs in our schnitzel, so we substituted them with Panko!

Was very good and authentic, but will probablly not make this very often because of the time it takes to pound the pork.

Made this with skinless chicken thighs last night.  My husband couldn't stop eating or raving about this.  I'm thrilled to have something new to throw in the chicken rotation.  Excellent recipe.

This turned out great--tasted just like the ones I ate when I lived in Germany!  The only thing I would add is what another reviewer said - put them in the freezer for a little while before cooking so the breading stays on better.

This schnitzel turned out even better than the ones from our local restaurant - and that is their speciality!
I have made it many times and will continue to do so.

This was really, really good as is; however, although not technically "German", I think this could be improved by seasoning the bread crumbs with oregano and Parmesan.

I loved this. My family isn't much on ethnic food of any kind, so I told them it was just fried pork chops. They liked it just fine then. Thanks for submitting.

Oh my, this was so very good.  Probably not the healthiest, but real comfort food.  I cooked them in my deep fryer and they came out perfect.  I squeezed fresh lemon juice on them when they were served.  Outstanding recipe and easy!
