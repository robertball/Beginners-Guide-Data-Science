Used grape Gaterade.  It was OK but was not all that flavorful since sports drinks are big on nutrients and mild on flavor.  (And expensive.)  I thought using about half that amount of ice would make it better but I haven't tried that.

I summed it down a notch one cup of tiny ice cubes one cup of propel strawberry kiwi and two scoops of ice cream. Then I put one scoop of my protein powder and blended. Loved it.

I used blue powerade rather than a grape flavor. Super simple to make, subtle but great taste.

This smoothie was ok.   The taste is a little odd. I like it, but it's different.     It needs a little bit more flavoring. I used the blue Gatorade, my favorite! But overall, Not bad !!

when I made this it was very watery and there was not a lot of flavor. It really just tasted like a sports drink which is low on flavor and high on nutrients. If i were to make it again I would add less sports drink and more ice cream
