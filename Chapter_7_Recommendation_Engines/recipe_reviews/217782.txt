This is an awesome recipe!  I made it last night and my husband kept telling me how good it was and went back for seconds.  then I took leftovers to work and everyone was commenting on how good it looked and smelled.

Great comfort food recipe. Hardly subtle, but hits the spot. Perfect for children too. The only thing I would say is I found 8 oz. of cheese to be WAY too much. I put 4 oz. on and it felt excessive.  If you want to spice it up a bit I found habanero cheddar to be a perfect substitute for the monterey jack.

This was a new take on Cod for me and it was pretty good. I subbed the onions and green peppers for red and orange peppers. The green pepper and onion is not something we are a fan of with fish. I also did not use as much cheese because it would have been too much. Overall a good recipe and I think any veggies can be subbed in here to sneak them in for children. I also cut the fillets smaller about 2-3oz. each to make it more like a casserole.
