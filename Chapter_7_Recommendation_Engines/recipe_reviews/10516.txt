These tasted more like granola bars, but I liked them anyway.  Since I'm allergic to pecans, I used hazelnuts.  I think next time I make them, I'll use almonds, and maybe some dried fruit.  The hazelnuts were good, but it's a pretty strong flavor.

A bit crumbly but very tasty!  I added dried cranberries to mine and they are very good.

I made these a few days ago...and I LOVED them!!! I was skeptical as I spooned the "batter" onto the cookie sheet......but they came out delicious. I'll be making these often!

I wish that recipes would specify cup to cup artificial sweetener or the kind that one uses much less to make up a cup.

Really good! As others said, a bit crumbly (and I wouldn't call them macaroons at all, just a cookie), but really a good flavor. I would even reduce the sweetener a little. I want to try subbing apple sauce for some of the oil - it might make them stick together a bit. Used pecans - totally delicious.

It's just ok.  It does  not have a real cookie texture or flavor. It has more of a stuck together granola texture and flavor.  I probably won't make it again.

These taste awesome, but I couldn't get them to stay together.  Any ideas?
I eventually just made one big one and when I went to cut it (while hot) it just kinda crumbled everywhere, but it still taste great!
