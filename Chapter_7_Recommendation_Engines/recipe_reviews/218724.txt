Loved it! Kinda silly to give a lower rating just because you didn't like the title. I didn't have fontina or white cheddar, so I just used some mozerella, mild cheddar, and a 4 cheese mexican blend. Turned out great! Will definitely make again. Thanks. :)

I gave it only three stars because of the name, mostly.  It was a very good dish....but I wouldn't exactly call it Mac and Cheese.  It's more of a ground beef casserole.  So, if you're looking for a real, cheesy, comforting Mac and cheese either try another recipe or make more of the cheese part.  As I said, it was very good...just don't make it expecting cheesy indulgence.

Not sure if I should be reviewing my own recipe, but I just tried this with Johnsonville Italian Sausage instead of Hamburger and my family absolutely LOVED this.  I made it for company and it was all gone and everyone raved about it!  I suggest trying it with sausage at least once!!

Loved the flavor of the cheese sauce. I left out the ground beef. I have been searching for an Adult Mac and Cheese and this is it. I will add some cream next time to make it just a tad more creamy. I also added ground mustard. It's a keeper!!

This is far superior than anything from a box. It took a lot of work and the end product was bland. I added a ton of garlic, cayenne and salt to make it flavorful. Honestly the end product was not worth it.

This gets two thumbs up (his and mine) from my house tonight, and is going to make excellent lunches tomorrow.  I added some cayenne and increased some of the spices because we tend to appreciate stronger flavours, but other than that I left the recipe intact and we loved it.  The flavour is good, the sauce is simple to make and amply covers the pasta and meat so the dish doesn't dry out.  We'll definitely be having this one again.

I've made this several times. I've used different cheese and once used freshly cooked bacon instead of the ground beef.  It's one of my 27 year old son's favorites - he always asks me to make it when I visit!

I didn't have Fontina or white cheddar and my ground beef went bad so I used 3 slices of good smoked gouda julienned, 3 slices of jarlsberg cheese julienned, 1 cup of colby jack shredded, 1/2 cup of Sartori BellaVitano merlot cheese finely shredded, and 2 1/2 cups sharp cheddar finely shredded and 1/4 cup of Kraft grated parmesan. Instead of ground beef I chopped up 2 large Italian sausages that I grilled yesterday (great use of left overs!). The result was far better than I could have imagined! The smoky flavor of the gouda and the sausage went really well together. I will absolutely make this again! Thank you for sharing this recipe that is so easily adapted!

Perfect! I made it exactly like the recipe and it was delicious.  My family devoured it.  It’s definitely not my mom’s Mac & cheese. Even my mom loved it, lol. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe tasted good.  I used coin-cut spicy Italian sausage instead of ground beef, which I think totally saved the dish.  The cheeses were the star, as not much seasoning is included.  The bread crumb topping added a lot of flavor, so I won't suggest changing the other seasonings much.  I am not likely to make this recipe again - it's too much work; too many pots and pans, and one hell-of-a mess with the cheese shredding.

I did not have white cheddar, so substituted Mozzarella.  Turned out great and made enough for lots of leftovers.  Even better the next day!!!

My husband and I find this a little bland, but our kids LOVE it. I make it with regular cheddar  and parmesan (because I don't normally have a lot of other cheeses on hand).

Great recipe!  This is one of those recipes you make and can then eat for the week.  I've made this recipe a bunch of times now and have tried a few minor variations.  First off, I always add veggies.  I will just cook a bag of frozen veggies and add it when putting it all together.  I enjoy adding some seasoning when cooking the ground beef (I've used a burger seasoning mix or just a small bit of paprika, garlic & chili powder.  I also tried adding bacon to the breadcrumb topping and that was good, but not necessary.

Love it! I added broccoli to make it a little healthier. Just add raw broccoli to the cheese mixture before anything else.

Cheese sauces like this in general need quite a bit of salt to really make them stand out. I used galic salt instead of garlic powder and added some salt, but there really should be a suggested amount - most people when they read "salt to taste" will definitely under-salt a cheese sauce. Other than that, it was fantastic.
