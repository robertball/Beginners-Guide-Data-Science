My grandmother used to make this all the time for breakfast.  She toasted the bread vs. making a sandwich.  This is sooo good.

I used half cinnamon, half nutmeg. I also soaked my raisins in hot apple cider and drained them before adding them into the peanut butter mixture. Both my kids LOVED these. I spread butter on each side of the bread and grilled them and served them for breakfast with fruit and yogurt parfaits. They were SO pleased.

Delicious!! I scaled the recipe down to just 1 serving. I used a little less honey then called for and it was still sweet enough for me. Also used crunchy all-natural pb for more texture. This is a new favorite. Thanks Lily!!

Pretty good actually. They seemed to be a little dry though and missing something, but still overall very good and a nice change from regular PB sandwiches. Thanks for the great idea!

Love this combination! Instead of raisins, I added apple slices (worked really well with a red delicious apple) and it seems to moisten the sandwich up a tad. Today for lunch I'm trying it without raisins or apple slices to see how that tastes! Very yummy, very easy!

Just made it for a night time snack.  I'm so happy now. I made it without raisins and it was amazing.  Doesn't need anything else.

My husband, being Scottish, did not even want to try these.  But he finally relented, and was so glad he did!  Sometimes simple is best.  These are a lovely lunchtime treat!  Thank you.

I really liked the sweet, creamy taste combo of the peanut butter, honey, and cinnamon, but am a bit unsure about the raisins.  I ate my sandwich open-face on toast so mixed the raisins in with the rest.  I think next time I'll leave them out...

tasty breakfast or snack.  I tried it the next day on toasted bread and it was even better.

Perfect for those on the go! The cinnamon puts this over the top.

Thank you, I had never tried cinnamon on peanut butter but it is indeed a great combination. I felt it was missing something though. I now add either banana slices or apple slices. Sometimes I use raisin bread instead of adding raisins. This is especially yummy when toasted!

This was good buttered on the outside and grilled.  I also like the idea of adding sliced apples.

This was yummy. I never thought to add cinnamon and honey to peanut butter. I made 1 serving, used natural peanut butter, and just did an opened faced sandwich with half the pb I made and about a tsp of raisins to cut the calories. This would make a nice filling breakfast when busy. I toasted a piece of whole grain gluten free bread to spread it on. I ate it with a glass of orange juice. I enjoyed this after not eating much today. thanks

Just another variation on the good ole P, B, & J that you can customize to your own taste. Less honey, more cinnamon, fewer raisins, a different type of bread?  Whatever suits your taste buds.
