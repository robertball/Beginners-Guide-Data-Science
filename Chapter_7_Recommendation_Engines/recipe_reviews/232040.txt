First known as Better than Sex Cake, then Better than Robert Redford Cake, followed by Better than Brad Pitt Cake and finally (last I heard) cleaned up with the totally uninteresting Better than Anything Cake, this cake has been around a long time, evidenced by the fact this “new” recipe calls for an 18.25 oz. cake mix which no longer exists.  (The big food corporations thought we were dumb and wouldn’t notice)  There’s also a variation using yellow cake mix and pineapple.  The chocolate variations, like this one, vary slightly – some, like this one, call for caramel topping (I use Mrs. Richardson’s) and/or the addition of a half/full can of sweetened condensed milk.  I like this recipe because it calls for both – and the full amounts of each.  Some tips: I’ve always used Heath Bars, only on the top, not in the middle, as this recipe directs.  Not sure I’d like them in the middle too. When the toppings are poured over it’s easier if you warm the caramel topping slightly – and fill in the holes made by the wooden spoon before pouring the rest over the entire cake.  To give you an idea of what goes on once you add the toppings, I remember a boyfriend my daughter had in college remarking that the cake was “leaking.”  There are little pockets of “gooey ooze” in every delicious bite.  This cake is beyond easy and beyond delicious.  I’ve made this often for a good couple of decades. It has been a hit every time I’ve made it and has been known to bring grown men to their knees.

I thought this was awfully sweet. I realized that but wanted to make it anyway. I guess if you are real sweet lover this is for you. Probably won't be making it again but wanted to try it. Very good but too sweet for my taste.

This is certainly a crowd-pleaser, but I was underwhelmed. I'm not a huge fan of cool whip and definitely prefer home made desserts, so maybe I shouldn't be surprised I only thought it was OK, but with the rave reviews, I kinda expected to love it in spite of the packaged ingredients. I may make it again to take somewhere, but I can't say I'd request it. My husband thought it was better after a couple of days in the refrigerator.

My son requests this as his birthday cake every year!  Everyone loves it!  I use Devils food cake mix instead of chocolate cake. Immediately after I remove the cake from the oven, i poke the holes and pour on the sweetened condensed milk and caramel. I think they soak into the cake better that way.

I have made this recipe for years.  But we have always called it "better-than-sex cake."  I always use fat-free sweetened condensed milk.  It's always better the second day :)

There is no need to change a thing! It's sinfully delicious.  I have never had so many people going this crazy over a cake.  Most said it was even better after sitting overnight in the fridge.

Great recipe.  Baked this cake.  Love it.    There are caramel creams to use or chocolate cream icing.  I add the candy broken up and found a bag of Heath pieces to garnish on top with candy to make it fuller. Just a big hit.
  Thanks.   Gin

After reading reviews I figured this cake recipe would be delicious. Especially since I love Butterfingers, caramel and chocolate. So why not mix everything together. But after baking it and eating my first piece of cake..... I was severely disappointed. The cake itself was good (not great). Overall, I doubt this would be a recipe I would make again.

We LOVED this! I split the recipe between 2 square casserole dishes for two separate family events. I used Cool Whip instead of whipped cream. Even better when my brother-in-law showed up with homemade butterfinger ice cream!

I've always known this as a "Better than sex cake".  The only difference is we use Heath bars or Skor bars instead of butterfingers.  This is so delicious!!!!!

I made this exactly as instructed for chocoholic sweet tooth's.  The sweetened condensed milk made it too sweet and soggy.  It calls for too much caramel sauce too.  I ended up throwing more than half of it away.

Love this cake!  It is so moist!  I buy the Chocolate Fudge cake mix if I can find it and I often use toffee bits instead of butterfinger.  Both are great!

My mom has always made this for me and my siblings for our birthday and it has always been a family favorite! Well now, today is her 50th birthday and I decided to make this recipe for her! I loooove this recipe, although I changed it up a little bit for appearance's sake. I put the caramel drizzle on top of the whipped topping instead of below it and the outcome was beautiful! You can see my picture above! It's the one with the caramel drizzle!

And the crowds go wild!  And so does the cook, because this is EASY! The only change I made was to use Cool Whip instead of whipping my own cream because I was feeling especially lazy (I prefer to whip my own).  I will say that this cake gets only better with time.  I made it on Saturday to serve on Sunday and it was very good.  But by Tuesday I thought it was great!  Oh, and the only reason it lasted this long is that it is incredibly rich. A 3x3 slice is too big. Trust me on this.  Serve smaller slices and enjoy it for a couple of extra days!
