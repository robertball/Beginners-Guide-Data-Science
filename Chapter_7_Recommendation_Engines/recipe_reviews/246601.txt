I thought these were really good.  I felt the mascarpone cheese was ok.  It needed something to amp it up.  Or maybe if the herbs and cheese melded together then the flavor would be there.

So yummy!    I will definitely make this again.    I added a bit of garlic salt to it for a little more flavor.   Other than that, I made it as directed.
