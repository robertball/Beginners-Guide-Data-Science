Warning!...  if you love lobster, this recipe is NOT for you.  I was SO disappointed in this recipe, and consider it one of the worst recipes I've ever tried.  The taste of the lobster is completely lost in this dish, and the tenderloin is overcooked.  Considering the cost of preparing this dish, you'll be MUCH better off cooking them separately to each guest's specifications!

I was able to make this recipe work for a dinner party by making the following changes: cook the tenderloin in 425 degree oven for 25 minutes, then stuff the lobster in the last 5-7 minutes, doucing with lots of butter to keep the lobster moist and keep a close eye on it to make sure it is not over done.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I also made a pan sauce of the drippings and the garlic butter to pour over the tenderloins.  Garnished with lemon slices and served with roasted red potatoes and a spinach salad.

This was very tasty with adaptations made to suit the ingredients I had on hand.  I used filet mignon and fake crabmeat and low fat marg.  Baked at same temp for about 25 min.  We enjoyed this a lot.

This is one of those recipes that everyone either loves or hates. I agree that the taste of the lobster is lost in the cooking here. I wasted a very expensive large tail for this recipe. Yet, it does make for a great presentation, so in the future I will make it again but use some sort of "fake" lobster for the stuffing. I also feel the cooking times are much too long for my desired medium-rare. Since all ovens are different, use the suggested oven temp setting but use a high quality meat thermometer to closely monitor.

This was great.  Used the render juices and made a sauce.  Was outstanding.  Had it for Valentines.   Cut temp down to 350 for about 50 min.  was tender, moist and delicious.  Also added shrimp along with the lobster.

Such a terrible waste of money (approximately $100.00), time and effort.  Such a disappointment for my dinner party.  I agree with the other reviewer that the lobster is totally lost.  Won't do this again!

I've made this dish several times and every time I taste it, I'm in heaven. If you get a large tail (8 or 9 ounces) you should only need two for a 4 pound tenderloin. I cook mine at 400Â° for about 35 minutes (or 145 degrees) and it comes out PERFECT every time. PLEASE don't cook it any longer, as you can see in my photo, after 30 minutes the meat is just under medium. Well worth the price, this  is such an impressive dish.

Recipe was great, maybe people should try to make the recipe the way it was written.  I am a butcher, and there is no way a London Broil could possibly be used as a substitute for Tenderloin.

I tried this recipe and made a few changes.  I chopped the lobster and mixed it with soft garlic butter and then stuffed the tenderloin.  For the sauce I added cream and mushrooms.  There wasn't a morsel left on the platter everyone loved it.

This recipe could be wonderful, but it does need some modifications.  There's no way a steak should be cooked at 425 for an hour--way too dry and chewy.  I cooked it at 425 for not quite half an hour and it was overcooked--after an hour, this would have been unedible.  I'll try it next time at 350 and watch them very closely to get medium rare.  I chose to use london broil, because I had it on hand and didn't cut them up, I put the lobster on top and baked them.  The sauce was good and it's a great idea, but this recipe needs some help.  I will tinker with it and try it again.

I think that it would be wise for some pepole to invest in a thermometer. The key to cooking is not with time but with temperature. Great recipe!

I did this for a thanksgiving brunch one year. Keep an eye on the lobster, don't over cook it.   I used a 4lb rib eye roast.  There was nothing left by the end of the meal!  Thanks Mike.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner.  What a success!  I had a petite tenderloin, about 1.25 lbs, and used only 1 large 1 lb lobster tail and followed the recipe exactly.  I thought this might cook through more quickly than a larger piece of meat but 45 mins at 450 and it was perfectly medium rare.  I did let the meat rest for about 10 to 15 minutes before cutting to let the juices redistribute.  Great presentation at the table.  Fed 3 comfortably with leftovers.  Thanks for the great recipe Mike!

I used a 1 1/2 pound roast and stuffed it with 3 small-ish tails.  Instead of making the full cup of butter and wine mixture, I used 2 TB of butter melted with 1/2 cup white wine and fresh, very thinly sliced garlic instead of powder.  To keep the moisture in, I wrapped the whole thing with bacon, like is often done with filet medallions, after rubbing the meat with salt, pepper, and a little bourbon.  Only cooked it for about 25 minutes, and it was PERFECT.  Did this instead of turkey for Thanksgiving, and got rave reviews!

I'm sad to say this is the first time I've gotten a bad recipe from this site. If you're going to use this recipe for the sauce, only use one cup of wine rather than the recomended three. I only used two cups and the wine was still overpowering and sauce watery -not buttery.  Also, cooking meat at that high of a temp might make it come out faster, but the meat will be too well done on the outside and not cooked enough on the inside.

The sauce was really delicious.  The meat was a little dry, though, next time I'll cook it for less time.  Overall, a decent recipe.

My husband and I made this the day after Christmas since we were invited at the last minute to a Christmas Dinner and it came out lovely. We adjusted it adding parsley, green onions, mushrooms, minced garlic and cilantro in the middle of the beef for a family of 4 and added some asparagus instead of potatoes and some Bearnaise sauce that we drizzeled over the meat it was fantastic. You definitley can taste the beef more then the lobster tails but i loved it.

This was a lovely dinner. I seared the tenderloin on the grill first then added the lobster. I grilled it for approximately 10 min at 375 degrees. Juicy & delicious! Note: I also added a light coating of cream cheese inside the tenderloin to help seal in moisture.

I made this recipe over the last 40 years.  I seasoned the tenderloin and placed whole  cooked lobster tail to tail.  I pored the melted butter and lemon over the lobster.  I folded the filet over the lobster and  wrapped with bacon strips.  tying the roll about 1 inch apart. Follow the rest of directions.  When done, let rest for 5/minutes...cut in 8 serving pieces.. very beautiful ..serve with a baked potato, special salad.   I cut the lemons in half and scoop out the insides.  mix butter and lemon and set on each plate.

Roast came out a little dry... think it should have been cooked at a lower temp and/or less time... next time I make this recipe I will try cooking it at a lower temp and/or less then an hour.

We've been making a version of this for at least 30 years. We do not spice/wine up the lobster. We only use unsalted butter. The other thing to remember is to not overcook the tenderloin. The lobster shines through and stays very pretty - no darkening at the edges. Make this gently. It can be exquisite.
