I have been making this for the holidays for years.  I just peel and cut up the sweet potato and layer it raw with the raw cranberries in the baking dish - add the rest of the ingrediants and bake.  no need to cook the potatoes and then bake.  works just fine. everyone always likes this one.

This was wonderful, and such a pretty dish!  Note that 1 1/2 lbs. sweet potatoes are equal to about 4 medium.  I omitted the butter - it wasn't really necessary.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've been looking for a Thanksgiving side dish that it is not the usual--this is it! Not only is it delicious, but the potatoes (I sliced them about 1/2" thick) take on a rosy glow from the cranberries.

Every year I search for a new sweet potato dish, and I never seem to be happy with what I make for Thanksgiving.  I think the search has finally ended!  This was such a refreshing side dish as everything else I make for a holiday meal is on the heavy side.  I forgot to dot the top with butter, but have decided it really doesn't need it, so why add it?  It was absolutely delicious as is, I doubled the recipe, but I'm still loving the leftovers!

Excellent and light recipe.  Based on previous suggestions, I peeled, sliced, and layered raw sweet potatoes.  Dumped the cranberries on top and mixed a little.  Then poured orange juice mixture (made with Splenda instead of sugar) on top.  Skipped the granola, because I ran out unexpectedly.  Baked, covered!  Wow!  I will make every holiday.  I don't understand why some say it is too sweet.  It was light, tart, and not at all too sweet!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit.  It's not overly sweet, like so many other sweet potato recipes.  The cranberries give it a bit of tartness that is really refreshing.  The granola on top adds really nice texture.  All in all, a wonderful taste.  I made this recipe exactly as directed, but doubled it for our crowd.  It was easy, fairly quick and the results were impressive.  I'll definitely be making this one again next year!

This was delicious! It tasted like a cobbler-esk dessert rather than a health side. (Healthy because I subbed Splenda for suger & skipped the butter.) It is a good way to get the family to eat thier fruits & veggies! I have already made it again!

A little sweet for me as well ... I'll cut the sugar by a 1/4 next time around.  My husband and I loved it though!  Thanks.

I made this for our office potluck.  It was a big hit.  The cranberries and orange juice were just the right amount of tartness.  Really easy to make too.  I cooked the sweet potatoes the night before. Definitely a keeper.

This was wonderful!  I must have cooked my sweet potatoes too long because they wouldn't hold together to cut into chunks.  So I just used a big spoon and scraped them out of the skins.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Oh, I didn't have any granola, so I used chopped toasted pecans as a topping.  I kept going back to for more until I polished off the whole dish!  DH got one helping.  This was really, really good.  Thanks Patricia!

Much too sweet - I'd cut the sugar by at least half, since the o.j. adds a lot of sweetness. Don't boil the sweet potatoes, you lose a lot of nutrients into the water! Just add to baking dish with the other ingredients and they'll cook perfectly - just might need to increase baking time by about 10-15 minutes or until potatoes are tender. Instead of granola I used chopped pecans to make it a little healthier and less dessert-like.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was well received by almost all the guests. In my small town, the grocery store doesn't carry granola but I used some Kashi cereal and it was good. I just sliced my sweet potatoes into rather thin rounds after peeling and layered with the other ingredients and baking until the potatoes were tender then added topping when reheating the next day. In my very traditionally minded family, several asked for the recipe.

I have always detested the traditional marshmallow encrusted sweet potato dish that is the traditional Thanksgiving fare.  2 years ago I was assigned sweet potatoes for the family dinner, and refused to bring the traditional dish.  After finding this recipe, I've discovered I like sweet potatoes.  This dish has been very popular the last 2 years, and always devoured.  I use brown sugar instead of white, and halve the amount.  I also use Trader Joe's organic dried cranberries, which are wonderfully juicy and much better than the usual dried up craisins.  For a former sweet-potato hater, I must say that this recipe converted me and now will be a tradition in our family.  I highly recommend it.

WOW!  Number 1 dish at our Thanksgiving dinner!  What a wonderful change from the regular marshmallow topped sweet potato casserole.  I tried one suggestion of putting the potatoes in raw and cooking it all together.  I would not recommend that.  Cutting raw potatoes wore me out, and the cooking time was much longer.  Stick to the original instructions.  HINT -- I didn't have "granola" so mashed up a crunch honey oat granola snack bar.  Worked great!

Love this recipe! It is SO easy to make, and tastes amazing...plus everyone just marvels at how wonderful it looks!
I prefer to slice the sweet potatoes, separate by large and small slices, then wrap the bowls, and refrigerate for a few hours. When I'm ready to bake them, I layer the largest pieces on the bottom and layer the smaller ones on top. I think it serves much easier this way :)

I was nervous about this recipe only because "sweet and tart" sweet potatoes just didn't sound that great. But I figured all of these people couldn't be wrong right!? I am SO happy I tried this! Brought it to Thanksgiving and people were eating it before eating the turkey on their plate! Seriously. It is really good...even if you do not like cranberries (like me). It makes the most beautiful presentation too. The orange juice mixture thickens up nicely while it cools out of the oven so don't worry if it looks too runny. Also I did not change the recipe at all and it was perfect! Enjoy! TY to Patricia for sharing this recipe with all of us. xo

I made this dish for my family and it was a big hit despite a fairly diverse group of tastes.  I did modify it a bit by substituting some honey for some of the sugar and adding a little bit of ginger and cinnamon.  The honey in particular added a nice touch.

This was terrific.  We served it as a side with turkey at Christmas dinner.  It was sweet, but that worked well with the tartness of the cranberries.  Next time I might try it with a little maple syrup, or maple flavored granola.

I liked this dish but almost no one tried it. I guess they like the marshmallow topped potatoes instead. I ended up taking most of it home.I  mashed it up and made sweet potato cranberry bread from a recipe off this site.

I put this in the crock pot to hold it until dinner. Stirred it before serving just a bit to mix in the topping. First time in as long as I can remember that the sweet potatoes were gone, no leftovers! ! recipe was enough for 18 people.

Growing up i never like cranberries, because i thought they only came in cans. Now they are a favorite of mine. This dish is easy to make and simply delicious. Save the marshmallow for campfires and leave the caned cranberries on the shelf this year. This is a wonderful dish everyone enjoys.

REALLY good!  I was in a hurry, so I used canned sweet potaotes.  I did not have orange juice, so I used 1/3 cup of the juice the sweet potatoes were packed in and ommitted the sugar.  I also added 1tsp. pumpkin pie spice.  I used Kashi Go Lean Crunch for the granola and like the nuts.

This was a great change for traditional yams, but I thought the cranberries were too tart. I liked it, but might use craisins next time!

This is delicious!  I use brown sugar and pour the orange juice over the layers in the pan.  For the topping, I make a streusel of brown sugar, cinnamon, chopped walnuts and butter, but I would love to try the granola next time.  This dish is great with roast pork.

I substituted canned sweet potatoes for the fresh sweet potatoes, which worked well.  The granola I used has some nuts and raisins in it, which added more to this dish.  The guests loved this one!

So delicious!  Even my husband (who hates sweet potatoes) liked it!  It's a great way to use up leftover homemade cranberry sauce.  I just omitted the extra sugar and juice in the cranberry layers and added a sprinkle of brown sugar on top of each sweet potato layer.  I used Post Trail Mix Crunch cereal on top because I had it on hand and it was great!

This is one of the best sweet potato dishes I have ever had.  The combination of orange juice, cranberries, and sweet potatoes is just perfect.  I added a dash of cinnamon on top to complete it.

Hi,
I really enjoyed this recipe. I found it a little too sweet so next time I think I might use less Orange Juice (I found the orange juice and sugar over powering). I think I'll also minimize the amount of sugar as well. but it was a good recipe and I'm excited to make it again with a few tweaks. Thanks :)

This was delicious!!! Everyone at the potluck I took this to loved it. Absolutely every single one of the 30 or so people. It's very sweet, and tart and incredibly delicious. Just don't spill any juice on yourself as it gets really sticky. It probably doesn't need as much of the oj and sugar mixture just because it does become a bit of a juice left in the pan, but it's allll so good. It also looks beautiful and festive. 
I highly recommend this.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving as I was assigned to bring a sweet potato dish and was this terrific! As other reviewers said, it is a nice combination of sweet and tart.  I only baked mine until the cranberries were cooked and not to the bursting stage and they were wonderful.  I will definitely make this recipe again and it will not be in a year!  I bought some bags of cranberries to freeze since they are near impossible to find frozen and will have this again in a couple weeks!  Thanks for a really good recipe.

This was good. Just a question, are the cranberries still whole after cooking or should they be mushy? also, do i pour the sugary mixture between the layers along with the cranberries or just the cranberries.  maybe cooking for 25 min is too long if the cranberries should still be whole...still tasted fine anyways.

This was the best side dish this Thanksgiving.   This is much better than the old candied sweet potato with marshmallow casserole!  The combination of sweet and tart is outstanding.  We are already planning to have this at Christmas.

Such a very simple but totally unique side to Thanksgiving turkey!  We didn't even have any cranberry sauce this year--this replaced the need for it.  Sweet and delicious!  And very easy!!  Definitely will be an annual trandition.

This will be a regular for our Holiday meals. Lovely combination and the Granola topping is so easy - I used a ginger cashew Granola. Served with a Greek roasted Chicken  Thanks for adding enjoyment to our Thanksgiving meal

Loved it!  Cooked this for Christmas dinner and got excellent reviews.  I cooked my sweet potatoes as directed (some other just threw them in the baking dish) and I used fresh cranberries.  Gorgeous colors!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  It was still a little sweet for my taste so I think next time I'll cut down the sugar.

This recipe was ok. I didn't really care for it so much. I made it because my girlfriend loves sweet potatoes but I really can't stand them. I asked her and she just said they were ok. But wouldn't want them again. She said she didn't like the flavor between the tart cranberry, the acid in the OJ and the sweetness of the potato.

Delicious! I omitted the butter in favor of more o.j. and might not use the granola next time, but this dish was a great addition to Thanksgiving. It's great, different way to make sweet potatoes.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was really good.  Such a fresh alternative to the ultra-sweet praline topped or marshmallow topped sweet potato dishes.
