Excellent.  Moist and tender.  I've made this recipe many times and I always add 3 cups blueberries instead of 2.  If using frozen, just throw them right in, no need to thaw.  I also add about about an extra 1/2 cup of sugar & 1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to the flour mixture for an extra kick, or else the original recipe can be a bit bland.  Forget the complicated mixing instructions.  Just mix the sour cream right in with the egg mixture until smooth, then slowly add it to the flour.  As an alternative, using 50/50 of white sugar and light brown sugar gives it more flavor.  And to top it off, I add a brown sugar streusel on top for extra crunch and sweetness b4 baking.  (Use the streusal topping recipe from To Die For Blueberry Muffins off this site).  I do like this recipe the best, even better than the recipe just mentioned.  It's lighter and more moist.  Oh, and DON'T OVERMIX.  Just like pancake batter, mix just until flour has been absorbed.  Batter will be very thick and slightly lumpy.  I use regular (medium) sized muffin tins and fill the paper cups right to the top for bakery size muffins. Will be my master recipe.

These are bakery quality; no question. I took the advice of another reviewer and increased the sugar by an additional 1/2 cup, and, I used 50% brown sugar and 50% white (so 1 and 1/4 cup white sugar, 1 and 1/4 cup brown sugar). Just gives more flavor that way. I also added a pinch of nutmeg and about two teaspoons of cinnamon. I mixed the eggs together then tossed in the sugars, vanilla & sour cream all at once. Used three cups of blueberries and fat free Breakstone's Sour Cream. I used a modified crumb topping recipe from a Barefoot Contessa sour cream coffee cake recipe to top muffins: 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 cup all purpose flour, 6 tablespoons cold butter cut into pieces, two tsps cinnamon. Pinch mixture together with your fingers for couple minutes until it forms more of a crumble). First time I made this topping I worried it was too loose, but it holds well. just spoon a good heaping TBSP on top of each muffin before cooking. They come out SO moist and flavorful. Wouldn't dream of making them without a crumb topping. Another  Barefoot hint: use a regular ice cream scoop (the old fashioned half ball shaped kind with the release lever in the scoop) and scoop evened off scoops of batter into the cups -- they make the perfect size muffin every time. My tip: used a KitchenAid silicone muffin pan & it worked like a charm. This recipe made two dozen large muffins. These will have people thinking you're a pro in the kitchen.

I tried a healthier version (6% fat vs. 45% fat) of this recipe and it turned out great.  I substituted apple sauce for the oil and low-fat vanilla yogurt for the sour cream.  I used 2 cups of whole-wheat flour and 2 cups of white flour and added an extra cup of blueberries.  I also saved 1/2 a cup of sugar (and only mixed 1 1/2 cups into the eggs) and used it to top the muffins prior to baking but I found this was too much sugar, 1/4 cup would have worked much better.  I would increase the cooking time to 23 minutes.... a few of the middle muffins looked a little under-cooked.

If ever there was a perfect blueberry muffin, this is it. Other than adding more blueberries, I followed the ingredients and method exactly, including taking the extra step of alternating the sour cream with the flour mixture, which is the classic technique for this type batter that's all about texture--it's well worth it. There is no need to tweak or tinker with this recipe at all--as the saying goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. This is a perfect, plump and pretty muffin, moist, pleasantly sweet and cakey, just bursting with blueberry flavor. Sprinkling them with demerara sugar just before baking took them over the top, with just a hint of extra sweetness and crunch. Great recipe!

Good recipe!!! I am a professional baker and I made this recipe exactly as it said and it turned out great. I think the other reviewers who did not rate this recipe   well did not follow the recipe and mix the ingredients properly.  It's a good recipe!

All in all, a very good recepie! Muffins came out absolutely delicious...  I did a bit of tinkering with it, heeding the advice of previous reviewers. Changes I made were as follows: 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of light brown sugar, 1 TBSP of Vanilla instead of 1 tsp, added 2 tsps of cinnamon and 1 tsp nutmeg, used 1 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup plain yogurt. (That last one because it turned out that I didn't have enough sour cream.) And wound up adding 2 lbs of frozen blueberries instead of two cups. (16 oz weight isn't the same as 16 oz liquid, I know this, yet I forget...)

This recepie is really very forgiving. I keep reading that some people complain about them being flat and heavy, and my only guess is that they are possibly overmixing the batter. Much like pancake batter, it's important to mix only until ingredients are just incorporated. Don't be afraid to stir it, but don't go at it like it's a cake batter, either.

My search for the perfect blueberry muffin is over!  These are just like something out of a bakery.  Not only are they moist and flavorful, but actually come out of the oven looking pretty.  I cut the recipe in half for a dozen and used only 1/4 c. of oil and used a full tsp. of vanilla.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!  These were done in exactly 20 mintues.  I sprinkled a little sugar on top for a little crunch - delicious!

I've used a different Blueberry muffin recipe for at over 20 years.  They always were dry by the second day.  These were wonderfully moist and dense.  I used light sour cream, maybe 50% more berries, and a little cinnamon/sugar sprinkled on top before baking.  I also halved the recipe.  Now I wished I hadn't as I will have to make more!  Everyone loved them-thanks!
UPDATE 2012:  I use melted butter rather than oil - the flavor is much better.  A streusel type topping is very good on these, but you don't need it.  People still tell me how good these are, and they ARE good!

These muffins are the best!  Mind you I altered it quite a bit, but that was only because I am trying to incorporate healthier choices into my diet.  First I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour, and 2 cups of unbleached flour.  Second I added 1 cup of ground flax seed and reduced the amount of oil (I used grapeseed oil) to 2/3 cup.  I also added 1/4 cup of unsweetened apple juice as well as substituted 1 cup of sucanat (organic evaporated cane juice), and combined these with my frozen blueberries as suggested by a previous review, and 1 cup of organic sugar. Last but not least, I used homemade non-fat plain yogurt instead of the sour cream.  Although it seems that I did not use this recipe at all, it was a base for me and I just used the ingredients that I want myself and my family to consume.  These were incredibly light, moist, and very flavorful!  I will make these again, and again, and again.  Thanks for the super duper recipe : )

These are the first blueberry muffins I've ever made from scratch.  It was very easy and they turned out beautiful and had great flavor.  I MIGHT try some more sugar next time, but I wouldn't say they actually need that.  Or, I might try a crumb or sugar topping as other reviewers suggested.  However, I love blueberry muffins split and served warm with a little cream cheese, so for me, they don't actually need more sweetness.  I'm confused by many calling these too "dense."  Mine turned out soft, moist, light, and perfectly cooked in 20 minutes on 400.  The only thing... I only got 18 muffins out of the recipe.  I may have overfilled the tins, but again, I loved the results.

I have NEVER written a review on here, but I just couldn't help myself on this one.  I have been on the hunt for the perfect Blueberry Muffin recipe for years, and have finally found it.  I first made this recipe about a year ago, and it was delicious as written.  But after reading reviews and tweaking it ever so slightly, I have found the most decadent, delicious, PERFECT blueberry muffin.  Here's what I did:  I kept all the amounts exactly the same EXCEPT for the sugar.  I used 1 1/4 C. white (granulated) sugar, and 1 1/4 C. brown sugar.  Then I added to the flour mixture a little fresh ground nutmeg (could use regular ground nutmeg, just a pinch), and 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon.   I followed other reviewers suggestions and added this topping:  1/2 C. brown sugar, 1 C. flour, 6 T. cold butter, cut into pieces, and 2 teaspoons cinnamon.  I'm telling you, it makes the BEST, bakery quality muffin!  So scrumptious!  Oh, and be sure to follow the mixing directions exactly as written.  That's what makes the texture so special!

This was a good muffin but it just seemed to be lacking something.  I think 2 cups is too much sour cream because the taste came out less like a blue berry muffin than I imagined. I did add a vanilla sugar topping which looked very nice and added a nice sweet touch but I would recommend using all white sugar rather than the brown sugar substitution some of the reviewers suggested.  Of course that is your preference!  I will not be making this my blueberry muffin recipie but I did like that all of the ingredients were measured in 1 cup increments. Less dishes to wash. :)

Wow!  These are really delish!  Moist, flavorful and had trouble NOT eating them myself!  Did take a few of the reviews into consideration.  I added an extra cup of blueberries and they were frozen; worked out just fine.  Extra half cup of sugar and did half brown and half white and 1 heaping tsp of Cinnamon.  I also added the crumble topping from the "To die for Blueberry Muffins" recipe.  One of the reviewers, chefjoy, gives an easy crumble that is sweet and crunchy.  Really compliments the muffin.  So that you don't have to go looking here it is: 2/3 C brown sugar, 1/4 C Flour, 1/4 Tsp cinn, 2 TBS butter.  LOVED THEM.  Thanks.

This recipe is so delicious.  I added a tsp. of baking powder and substituted the oil for applesauce.  My kids devoured them and I like that I had some left over to freeze for our lunches. I also ran out of fat free sour cream and used 1 cup of fat free yogurt, and only had a cup of blueberries so I added a cup of raspberries - they were still super yummy!! Thank you so much for this recipe.

This is the only blueberry muffin recipe I ever use. Each muffin turns out light in texture yet flavorful. Don't use light sour cream and feel free to use either frozen or fresh blueberries. I've had success using both. You must fold in the blueberries gently. If you try to blend them in you'll end up with blue batter because blueberries are far too delicate and won't hold up. These are great and by far the only muffin I make when I make breakfast for a family get together. I always receive rave reviews and recipe requests.

Wow, these are great! I can't believe how BEAUTIFUL that these muffins bake up. They look like something out of a classy recipe book. Halving the recipe (I love that feature, thank you allrecipes.com!) I made the recipe exactly (which never happens!). I rate this a 4.5 so I rounded up! Next time I will up the sugar a little bit, decrease the oil a little bit and add some cinnamon. This is a very moist muffin. They do taste better after being able to sit a spell, or the next day. I filled the cups too full and thought that the tops would overflow and stick to the pan; instead, the batter just rose straight up. What a delight! Thanks for the post Kim.

I added the crumble topping from the "To Die For Blueberry Muffins" as someone suggested and I did half brown sugar and half white. And don't overmix. All that doesn't even matter actually because this recipe is just amazing. I haven't read a review yet on texture of this muffin yet and it's more cakey and airy. It's a lot fluffier and "less filling" so it's nice as a snack. I think the To Die For Blueberry muffins has a more muffin-like texture. So you choose whether you want cakey or muffiny.

I bake muffins most weekends and I'm always looking for new options.  I had actually been looking for a blueberry muffin recipe with cream cheese when I stumbled on this recipe.  I  followed it exactly and couldn't be more pleased - light, flavourful with a naturally crunchy top. My family loved them. Just a note, I read a lot of reviews containing significant revisions but wonder if  the reviewers had made the original recipe before making suggestions. Many of the revisions, while interesting actually result in a different type of muffin

I've tried a lot of blueberry muffin recipes but this one was absolutely wonderful.Very moist and flavorful. My husband couldn't wait for them to cool. He ate one hot right out of the oven. 
For a little change try adding lemon yogurt instead of sour cream. 
Awesome!

The first few times I made these I added some of the tweaks (more sugar, more vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg).  This time I followed the last few reviewers advice and made the recipe exactly as written, directions and all....OH MY!  These are fabulous!!!  No tweaks are needed, but you must follow the instructions!

OUTSTANDING!!  I made these exactly as written, but added 3/4 tsp. cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  Wow, we were so impressed that I used the batter for chocolate chip muffins for the kids.

AMAZING!  I followed what other reviewers said, and used 6-7 cups of blueberries, 1t of vanilla and cinammon, 1/2t nutmeg 2T of lemon juice, and made a streusal topping. Delish, haven't had a muffin this good...well, prolly EVER.

Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely terrific!!  I used fresh blackberries that I picked at the cottage.  These muffins went so quickly that in 48 hours my husband and daughter were asking me to get back in the kitchen for a repeat performance.  This recipe more than deserves all of the excellent ratings that have been received.  Thank you so much.

YUM! These muffins came together incredibly fast and the whole family loved them including our incredibly picky two year old. I halved the recipe since there are only 3 of us and even so I had enough batter for 12 very generous sized muffins. I stayed true to the recipe only making one slight modification, I used half plain applesauce and half oil so that I could cut down on the amount of oil needed. Next time I make these I want to try substituting plain greek yogurt for some or all of the sour cream to cut out some of the fat/calories and add some extra protien. Neither of the substitutions listed above are for taste, the muffins taste amazing, but rather trying to make them more healthy so I can make them more frequently than just an every now and again treat. One surprising thing we found was that as good as the muffins were fresh out of the oven they were really good, maybe even better, the following day.

These muffins are simple to make and taste great. However, as sour cream does not last more than 24 hours in my house before it is used, I do substitute 2 cups of greek yogurt in place of the sour cream, and I increase the blueberries to 3 cups.

I've made this recipe many different times now with various types of changes and they always come out! I don't often rate things because I am always changing recipes so I don't think it's always fair to rate something when you don't make it as written. BUT, I wanted to say that even though I make changes to this recipe, I love it! I can make them "healthy" and they still turn out. That's what makes it a keeper in my book. The key I think is the sour cream. I actually use greek yogurt but the texture is the same. Other changes: cut sugar in half and used brown sugar or sucunat, used king's arthur white whole wheat four, and for the oil sometimes I use really light olive oil or earth's balance. I also add extra vanilla. They bake up so nicely. Even people who don't usually bake "healthy" like them. : ) Thanks for the recipe!

Wow!  Lovely muffins.  I've made these twice.  Once for a brunch at my house with a bacon cheese frittata from this site, roasted red potatoes and fresh fruit.  Perfect.  The second time was for a work event.  Both times people raved.  Said I should enter them in the state fair  : - )   The only change I made was to top them with a generous sprinkling of demerara sugar before baking.  That sweet, crunchy topping really made these special.  And they look beautiful, too.  This will be my basic go-to muffin recipe for many different  types of  muffins.  Thanks!

This is hilarious! I was reading through the reviews and kept wondering why everyone was talking about sour cream. So apparently I used cream cheese by accident. All I have to say is those where the best  muffins I have ever eaten. I don't know if the cream cheese had anything to do with it but it was so good I'm not even going to try them with the sour cream. 
     My only sugestion is to try them with cream cheese and add more berries.

I used a combination of whole wheat and bread flour.  The mixture was a little thick so I used a small amount of orange juice to thin it out.

Fantastic! What else can I say? These are some of the best blueberry muffins I've ever made. Moist, tender and just the right amount of sweetness. I made half a recipe and added some extra blueberries. I also sprinkled some raw sugar on top. Since my blueberries were frozen, I did have to increase the baking time.

Oh wow!!!  These muffins are the BEST!  I made them exactly as written and they turned out perfect.  I ended up with 24 reg. muffins and 12 mini.  I always make a recipe as written the first time, then I decide if it needs to be altered in any way.  The only thing I would add, in my opinion, would be to sprinkle some Bakers sugar on top before I baked them.

I'm a big believer in muffins and quick breads with sour cream, so I wasn't surprised at the great, soft, moist texture these muffins had. Perfect. The flavor, however, I found a bit lacking, even after adding a struesel topping. I think next time I try these, I will add some lemon zest or cinnamon.

I added  cup of oats to the oil & let it sit while getting the rest ready.  That was to hydrate/disguise from the kids.  I used a cup and three fourths sugar & a half cup of spenda.  I couldn't bring myself to adding two cups of sour cream (eventhough it was "light") with the cup of oil already.  I used three cups blueberries.  I topped with the to die for blueberry topping.  It made thirty two muffins.  The muffins were okay.  Not bad at all, but not the one I'll turn to.  Still looking.  The topping was good.  I'll save that.

This recipe is the closest to perfect I've ever encountered. Try mixing the eggs (sugar & oil) with a mixer, and add the sour cream at that time, blending until smooth.  Use a wooden spoon when adding dry ingredients, mixing until just blended.  It prevents you from having to over stir the batter when incorporating the sour cream (over stirring produces flat muffins, and diminishes the taste and texture).  I used fresh raspberries and strawberries, and the results are out of this world.  Definitely produces a bakery texture and bake shop quality muffin!  Wow!

These turned out totally amazing!!  Everyone who tried them declared them the very best blueberry muffins they'd ever had.  The only trouble I had with cooking them was the top hadn't fully set when I first took them out, so I put them in for another 5 minutes or so at 350 degrees.  It might just have been my oven though.  But I'd definitely recommend this recipe to everyone - the best!!

Blueberry muffins are one of my favorite pastries and I have been on the lookout for my ultimate blueberry muffin recipe! I have baked literally DOZENS of different recipes over the years and THIS one is now at the top of the list.  It's my favorite. I absolutely loved it.  I used fresh Washington State blueberries that were so delicious! One small change I made was to use half cake flour and half all purpose flour. I wanted my muffins extra tender with a good rise. One thing about homemade muffins - they often taste good but are not visually appealing - sometimes really flat.  I wanted a muffin that tastes as good as it looks. This recipe is it! They were bakery window perfect! Very attractive.  I used paper liners in my muffin pans.  I imagine if you use just a greased pan that the muffins would be difficult to remove because the blueberries become so gooey. These muffins rise straight up, so you don't have to worry about the muffins puffing over the tops and spilling everywhere. I filled the cups almost right up to the brim with the muffin batter. They would probably be really wonderful with a little sparkling sugar sprinkled on top before baking. I highly recommend these muffins.  The texture is delightful.  At first I was not sure about the high amount of sour cream involved but they turned out wonderful.  The sour cream adds to the moistness and adds a slight tanginess. I'm also going to try this recipe with raspberries and marionberries and blackberries. Soooo good!

I have tried the To die for Blueberry muffins and found these to be just as good.  The do look like the picture and I will continue to make both muffins.  I did not make any changes to the recipe.  I made only half the recipe and made just 8 muffins that were huge.  They took a bit longer to cook, about 10 minutes, but were much larger.  I filled each muffin cup to the top and that gave me a bigger muffin.

These muffins are delicios and addicting!  This recipie yields a nice moist dense muffing.  I added 33% more blueberries to the mixture.  Also, I sprinkled granulated sugar on top of the muffins prior to baking.  They were devoured in a day.

These sounded delicious so I made them for a baby shower I hosted.  But they were so dense and bland that I was very disappointed.  Not what I was expecting.

These are Amazingly yummy! I used non-dairy sour cream, and Raw sugar (not quite 2 cups, more like 1 & 1/2)...NOM!! :) Easy to make, but you do need some arm strength for that batter - THICK stuff. :) 
This made WAAAY more than 24, too.

Followed the recipe exactly never changed a thing.  These are a good muffin, so soft and moist.  I did use frozen blueberries.  Certainly a recipe to make again.

Absolutely the best blueberry muffin recipe I have ever tasted.  Rich and moist and delicious.  The only thing I would change is add extra blueberries...at least a 1/2 cup more.

I just finished making this recipe and my whole kitchen smells of blueberries. The recipe made 24 large muffins and one small loaf. I used frozen blueberries and added an extra cup of them. That was the only change. Otherwise I made as written. These are wonderful and a must try. Thank you, I won't be buying a mix for these again.

Best. Muffin. Ever.  I read the reviews before I made them, so I replaced 1/2 C. white sugar with light brown sugar.  Also used a little more vanilla because I love it. I had some strawberries to use up, so I also added about 1 C. chopped strawberries. I added a crumb topping to mine that Erin recommended. (1C. flour, 1/2C. brown sugar, 6T. butter, and a dash of cinnamon) This will absolutely be the ONLY recipe I use to make fruit muffins from now on. I'm actually deleting the other fruit muffin recipes from my box because this recipe is "it" for me!  I plan on making these with only strawberries later in the week, and hopefully raspberries soon since they're my favorite. Thanks KK3!  UPDATE: I made these muffins and substituted chopped strawberries in one batch and mini chocolate chips in another batch, and they were so good.  This really is the perfect muffin recipe!

Excellent blueberry muffins!  Well, it was either use em or lose em for both my sour cream and my blueberries, so had to cut this recipe in half.  Used light sour cream and also only 1/4 cup canola oil along with 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce.  These turned out fantastic, my 8 year old was drooling when they came out of the oven and couldn't resist eating one warm!  Great recipe!

Very tasty!  I halved  the recipe but still used 2 c. frozen (no need to thaw) blueberries.  Other changes were: half white and half brown sugar, extra vanilla, also added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.   I also topped the muffins with a crumb mixture of 1/4 c. brown sugar, 2 1/2 Tbs. flour, 2 Tbs. butter, 3/4 tsp. cinnamon & 1/4 c. chopped hickory nuts.  My half recipe yielded 18 muffins.

This is a wonderful recipe I must say, but I only have one question to ask.. how can I get the top of the muffin to crack open like the photo shown? because mine turned out round and some are flat.

So I usually try and make my first batch and follow the recipe before taking reviews into consideration..I wish I didnt do that.  These muffins def needed more sugar in my opinion.  Almost too bland like a scone.  Will make again adding in extra sugar and I think they will be 5 stars then.  I also add the baking soda right into the sour cream to take away the heaviness of it.

I made these yesterday and did not have enough sour cream, so I substituted lowfat vanilla yogurt and they turned out beautifully.  Delicious, moist and full of blueberries.  I made 12 extra large muffins and 1 loaf.  It makes lots of batter.  I will be using this recipe always!  My "reviewers" gave it five stars!

Awesome recipe.  I always love muffins or cakes made with sour cream as they are always so moist.  This one was no let down.  I did 1 cup blueberries and 1 cup strawberries as I had a little of both to use up.  I also added 1 teaspoon of almond extract. (I have been on a big almond kick lately)  They were delicious.  I will be making these again.

These were good, but I should have followed the other reviewer's advice (meant to, but forgot!)  They definitely need more sugar!  I did add a streusel topping, which helped and made them look very professional!

These were delicious.  I followed the recipe but I used more blueberries.  It made 30 regular size cupcakes. My sons and husband loved it.  They were fighting over the last two.  With 4 sons and 1 hungry husband it went fast.  This is a keeper.  I will file this recipe in my cookbook

These were good for my first attempt at blueberry muffins.  The only complaint that I got from hubby is that they were not sweet enough.  I also added a little more fresh blueberry than it called for...but it turned out well.  Thanks for the post.

Just took these muffins out of the oven and everyone grabbed one!  Wow are these good!  I made about 20 muffins and put the rest of the batter in a loaf pan and made a blueberry bread that turned out perfectly.  The only thing I will do differently next time I make these is DOUBLE the recipe.  The more the better.  Thanks for this great recipe.

Just tried this recipie this morning. It was excellent. I did though read thru the ratings and changed two things because of some peoples responses. First I halved the recipie then added 1/4 tsp of baking powder for fluffyness.
Then I used melted margarine instead of the oil (oil has no taste)
They turned out excellently. :)

I've never made homemade blueberry muffins before, but these were great.  They were moist and light.  I got 2 1/2 dozen out of the batter and sprinkled sugar on top before baking.  I will definitely make them again.

These muffins are wonderful!  I have tried a lot of different muffin recipes and had about decided that store-bought muffin mixes were better than from-scratch, however, this recipe changed my mind.  The texture is moist and almost cake-like.  I added frozen blueberries sweetened with a few teaspoons of sugar - the flavor was exceptional.

I too tried to make this a bit healthier. Used applesauce instead of oil, Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and substituted out 2 cups flour for one cup flax seed meal and one cup oat flour. Kept everything else the same. They came out great. Very filling, moist and tasty. Whole family loved them.

Halved the recipe to make just a dozen, no changes and they came out perfectly. Golden, light, tender, lots of berries and not too sweet. YUM! An easy recipe to make, definitely a keeper.

I was skeptical when I saw how heavy the batter seemed, but I stuck with it and I am so glad I did.  These muffins baked up light but moist with a beautiful crumb.  I also had to restrain my impulse to ignore the method of preparation.  Follow it - it works

This is a fantastic muffin recipe! They were just perfect. I read the other reviews and chose not to add any extra sugar and it really was perfect. I generally love sweet things, but these really were great not-too-sweet. The tops of the muffin have a nice slightly crisp texture, and adding a streusel topping (another reviewer suggestion) would take away from that. They domed up beautifully. The flavor was great with just the vanilla. No need to add any cinnamon or nutmeg. I did add walnuts and raspberries. This is my new favorite muffin recipe!

frankly, i am not a fan of blueberries.  i still rate this one with 5 stars bcos this muffin base is wonderful, very moist and fluffy.  i will try next time replacing blueberries with mocha-choco chips.  i did add a struesel as recommended by the other reviewers, and the struesel is really a perfect match to the base and it's making the whole thing special.   i can't stand the smell of cinnamon, but funny enough, i did add cinnamon and nutmeg to the base, and cinnamon to the streusel.  okay, all my "guinea pigs" went thrilled!  haha!!  this recipe has made me like a muffin expert!!  

okie, tweaks that i'd made: 
1) i cut back oil to just 3/4 cup; 
2) i added cinnamon 1 tsp and nutmeg 1/2 tsp; 
3) i used 1 cup white 1 cup brown sugar; 
4) i also added 1/2 tsp of baking powder; 
5) i tossed the blueberries with a bit of flour before adding them into batter (but they still insisted to sink to the bottom : (  );
6) i added streusel: 3/4 cup brown sugar 3/4 cup all-purpose 1/2 cup butter 2 tsp cinnamon.  

i am very happy with this one.  it really worths a try, everybody!!

Most excellent recipe. Only subsitution was I used butter instead of oil,  half white and and half dark brown sugar.  Oh yeah - added the cinnamon too!   Very moist! Other than that, yummos!

These muffins are delicious and very moist BUT the recipe makes twice the number of regular-sized muffins it says it should so cut the number you want in half.  I've also used cut-up strawberries instead of blueberries and plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  They also freeze well.

Judging by this recipe, I knew that it just wouldn't rise. I added 4 tsps of baking powder and upped the baking soda to 2 tsps. Also subbed one cup of sugar for brown. Also added 2 tbsp of ground flax seed. It was good -- just your standard blueberry muffin but, in my opinion, needed a kick. I probably would add cinnamon or spices or possibly some lemon zest to freshen it up a bit. I would probably also add 1 extra cup of blueberries to the mix too. Good recipe though.

These were OK; only ok.Rather dense, not fluffy at all. Needs spices to liven up. Probably will not make again. Thanks again.

These are the best blue berry muffins I've ever had. I followed the recipe except for using half brown and half white sugar, and added a tsp. of cinnamon and dash of nutmeg...glad I did. I mixed ingredients as stated adding the sour cream along with the flour slowly (used Daisy light). What makes this recipe is the creamy sour cream parts inside the muffin. I didn't have enough blueberries so threw in some fresh strawberries too. I didn't add any extra sugar like many reviewers did and felt these were just perfect with the amount called for...but then I'm not a big sweet eater, however husband is and he said they were perfection...I can tell because he ate enough of them. Thanks KK3 for a great recipe.

Very good moist muffin. Only change was increased blueberries to 3 cups. I will add 1/2 cup of sugar next time as mentioned in some of the reviews. Also could use a little sugar or crumb on top.

Very nice recipe! I cut the sugar just a little: from 2 cups to 1 3/4 cups, and upped the blueberries from 2 cups up to 3 cups. I also used Greek-style fat-free yogurt instead of sour cream.

Awesome! The muffin was moist, fluffy and surprisingly tasty. I made this again  only this time I used half All-purpose flour and half whole wheat flour. Also, I used the streusel toppng from another recipe on this website called "To Die For Blueberry Muffins," and it came out so delicious.

I'm not tremendously happy with this recipe. 

Issues: 
---It took much longer than 20 minutes to bake the muffins and longer than 10 minutes in prep time considering the whole beating process and dipping them out.
---The recipe made much more batter than for 24 muffins (or 12 since I halved the recipe).
---Flavor is pretty simple. Nothing too special.

I even jazzed it up a bit by using my vanilla bean infused sugar and sprinkling some of that same sugar on top of each muffin. I also doubled the vanilla extract. Still... it was plain. I also added a bit more berries than it called for. Some reviewers recommended making it with half brown sugar, I was out so I just but a teaspoon of molasses in it instead.

Other than just adding more vanilla and berries, I followed the recipe completely and also used the method as directed. The muffins were light and fluffy but I lost one due to the bad cooking time. The toothpick came out clean but it seemed not to stand up to a gentle press so I cut one in half to check. Gooey still. Left them in the oven for about 5 more minutes (I'd already baked them an extra 3 or so minutes) and then let them cool in the pan to finish off. 

I'm still looking for a good, flavorful blueberry muffin recipe, one that works well as written and makes 12 muffins with no extra batter

(Btw,  you can fry up the extra batter in a frying pan with oil like a pancake. I had enough batter, after filling my cups a touch over 3/4, to make 2 pancakes 6 inches across.)

Oh my goodness!  I have been trying to make a decent bakery-grade blueberry muffin for years!  I followed this recipe as close to exactly as I could, and it is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G !!  I did follow the method exactly (alternating flour mixture & sour cream, which other reviewers suggest to skip - DON'T), but I did 1/2 the recipe for 6 jumbo muffins, and I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white.  I put in slightly more baking soda and vanilla than was called for, but not enough that I think it affected my results significantly.  I added no new ingredients, substituted nothing (other than the sugar), nor subtracted anything, and I ended up with 6 beautifully browned, fully baked, gorgeously risen and, most importantly, delicious muffins. THIS is our new go-to recipe for any berry muffin.  Y-U-M !!  Thank you SO much for sharing!

I have made these twice and they always come out wonderful. I am not a" baker person, never give me something to knead", but I can make these with no problem. People at my church loved these both times , not dry, very tasty. Followed the recipe exactly.

Five stars even with using 1 1/2 cups low fat sour cream and 1/2 cup oil, and 1 1/3 cups sugar, and white whole wheat flour. These are my favorite blueberry muffins. :)

OMG, I just finished the first batch and had one straight out of the oven. Absolutely mouthwatering!

I followed the other reviewers advice and added the sour cream to the egg mixture to make it easier. I also followed the suggestion of adding a bit of cinnamon. 

I added 1 cup chopped apple to recipe as well. I love that you can add or substitute almost any fruit you want and they would turn out great. This will definitely be my base recipe for all muffins. Any surplus of fruit I have on hand (pineapple, strawberries, apples, etc) in the future I will definitely try in this recipe. Maybe some nuts too?

My only complaint is the fat and sugar content... they are rich and delicious for a reason! I used reduced fat sour cream. It slightly reduced the fat content.

Delicious! Followed these tips:

1. Instead of 2 C of white sugar, use 1 C white and 1 C brown
2. Fill to top of muffin tin (only makes 20)
3. Instead of 2 C of blueberries, use 3 C

They were so great! Next time I'm only using 2 C of blueberries though (I had big berries)

This is a nice muffin but not worth five stars.  I expected a bakery quality product as another reviewer claimed.  I made it with everything the recipe called for and added a tsp of baking powder because another reviewer said that it was flat and heavy.  I agree that over-mixing the batter can make these flat but I also think that only one tsp of baking soda isn't much in relation to the amount of batter.  I also added 2 tsp of cinnamon.  I used fresh blueberries and they are pretty expensive right now so I was a bit disappointed that they weren't as good as I had expected.

Very good, and very easy!  Good way to use up the blueberries and sour cream.  I changed the recipe yield to 6, and used up what i had of my blueberries and sour cream.  Perfect for breakfast with a cup of espresso.

OMG. These are awesome. I used 2 1/2 cups of sugar (next time I want to use half brown sugar as suggested in another review) and added 1.5 teaspoons of cinnamon. Also, to make these a little healthier, I used light sour cream and apple sauce instead of oil. Oh and I used 3 cups of blueberries instead of 2 and cooked them for 22 min. They are awesome. Will be a staple in our house from now on. Thanks!

The best blueberry muffin recipe! I have tried dozens of different blueberry recipes and this is definitely #1! My family, coworkers and neighbors loved them. These are a higher quality of muffin, more of what you might find at a fine baker's shop. I used frozen blueberries, it's all I had on hand, tossed them in with the dry ingredients, gave them a few stirs and they were just fine. They didn't fall to the bottom and there were loads of blueberries all the way through the muffin. I did use an extra cup of blueberries, I love them! If you want to make the best blueberry muffin recipe, look no further, this is the recipe.

i should have read other reviews before baking - needs more sugar for my palate.  i sprayed muffin tins with spray release with flour.  i also doubled blueberries and did follow all mixing directions.  they're pretty!  they look golden brown on the top and the bottoms are very pale but are done.  baked for 20 minutes exactly in a well preheated oven.  next time i will take the advice of others and add some type of sugary or streusel topping and increase sugar.  thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I used mommyfromseattle's recommendations (extra sugar and a streusel topping) and added extra vanilla and these were a huge hit!   I've made them so many times now that I've lost count, and they never last more than a few hours. A half-recipe makes 12 good-sized, beautiful muffins -- and are better (in my opinion) than the "To Die For Blueberry Muffins" on this site that attract a lot of attention.  **One time I even started making them without checking that I had all of the ingredients, and sure enough, I ended up making several substitutions -- partial splenda for the sugar, and even unsweetened applesauce for ALL of the sour cream.  Surprisingly, they were still great even with the sugar and fat subs.  I highly recommend that you try this recipe.**

This is an excellent, well written recipe that results in a perfect muffin that will make you popular with your neighbors (if you share!!!) The only change I made was to the sugar.   I did 1 Cup dark brown sugar, 1 Cup white sugar, 1/2 Cup Demerara sugar. I also increased the blueberries to 2 1/2 Cups, because the frozen berries I buy come in this quantity.  I sprinkled about 1t of Demerara sugar on top of each muffin before baking.  They are perfect.  I promise it is the best muffin you will ever taste.

This is my favorite blueberry muffin recipe by far.  I usually make half a recipe because there are only two of us and even then I usually get about 18.  Sometimes I add Craisins along with the blueberries which is really a good combination.  I often add a crumb topping, but they are wonderful with or without a topping.  So moist and they freeze really well also.  I freeze them and just take out one or two at breakfast time.  Thank you Lusenda for a wonderful recipe.

These are GOOD if you use the reviews before you start.  Maybe next time I will just make the recipe as stated just to see what it's like... All that I had on hand was bread flour, so the muffins were nice and "sturdy".  I also did half white and half brown sugar, added cinnamon, and I'm pretty sure I used more than 2 cups of blueberries (frozen).  I made mini muffins because I don't have a regular muffin tin and I have muffins coming out of my ears! Oh, I'm always trying to add protein to my recipes and GREEK YOGURT is a fantastic way to do it.  I substituted non-fat plain greek yogurt for the sour cream which tastes exactly the same, but is much better for you. ;-)

I sprinkled the tops with white sugar prior to baking.  Next time I'll make a crumb mixture to add instead since I like my muffins a bit on the sweeter side and these just weren't sweet enough for me.  They sure were beautiful though!

Very good.  I used the suggestion another reviewer listed and used half brown sugar, half white, and increased the sugar by 1/2 a cup.  I also used the same reviewers topping (a variation of something by the Barefoot Contessa).  I did not add spices.  I did add 3 cups of blueberries.

YUM!

This was a great and simple recipe!!  I added the zest of one lemon, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and (almost)1 tsp. nutmeg.  It really wakes up the flavor of the blueberries.  Like others suggested, I used 1 (loose) C. brown sugar and 1 C. white sugar.  You can fill these pretty full and the pop right up when they bake with a nice dome.  These are a keeper.  This basic recipe would also be great with different flavors or fruits...maybe nextime I'll try chocolate chip for my boys...  Thanks for this recipe!!

These were so yummy!  I did make a few changes though, based on the other comments:  added an extra cup of blueberries, some brown sugar, almost double the vanilla, a teaspoon of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.  The sour cream makes these so moist.

I currently live overseas and a muffin pan has just never been on the priority "to get" list. For this reason, I baked it in an 8x8 dish for 40-45 minutes and it turned out great. Aside from the dish size and baking time, the only other changes I made was adding 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and 3/4 cup of white sugar mixed with 1/4 cup of light brown sugar. I then covered the entire top with a simple crumb topping using 1/4 cup of white sugar, 1/3 cup of flour, 1/4 cup of butter 1.5 teaspoons of cinnamon. Mix together and crumble over the top. When making the crumb topping, I find it's best to use your hands to get the best crumbs possible; using a fork takes too long.

These muffins were terrible!
If you are looking for sweet, moist muffins this is NOT the recipe.
This recipe produces more of a consistency close to that of an Irish Soda bread. I also noticed that many reviewers who gave this recipe 5 stars also changed the recipe completely around!!!
Although the muffins were very attractive, the sour cream seemed to settle on the bottom portion of the muffin cup and produced a strange taste..
The "To die for blueberry muffins" on this site are way tastier for a sweeter, lighter muffin taste.

I cut the recipe in half and used one cup of whole-wheat pastry flour.  Turned out light and fluffy.  (Tried my best to not overmix the batter).  I put in the whole teaspoon of vanilla.  They turned out very good!  I needed to use up some fresh blueberries and some sour cream so this was perfect.  Next time I might try some of the suggestions of adding yogurt and/or applesauce.

I followed a few suggestions...I used brown sugar instead of white. I didn't use a drop of oil. Instead I used apple butter. I added more blueberries too. Also, I used low fat sour cream. It was the first recipe I used apple sauce/butter and it turned out really moist and rich...I was pleasantly surprised! Next time I'll try using whole wheat flour. A healthy tasty alternative!

This is a lovely recipe. I just made a few alterations: Instead of 1 cup of vegetable oil, I melted 2/3 to 3/4 cup of butter and then topped it up with the vegetable oil to make 1 cup (I find that with butter, you will get better flavour); decrease the salt to 3/4 tsp, and add 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder. I also added finely grated rind of 2 lemons and increased the vanilla to 1 tbsp. They turned out beautifully! Take care and thank you so much for the recipe!

Awesome, very simple to make.  I halved the recipe, substituted 1 c whole wheat flour, used 1/4 c applesauce and 1/4 c canola oil, and added some cinnamon, nutmeg, and extra blueberries.  Delicious, especially with milk or coffee.

These are very good. They are more moist and dense than cake like. My husband prefers cakey muffins to these, but these are my favorite. The first time I made these I followed the recipe exactly, but now I make them with splenda instead of sugar, just because it's just as good without the calories. I also use low fat sour cream and extra blueberries. Whenever we have fresh blueberries around, I'll be sure to make a batch of these. Oh, and they are excellent on the second day, heated up and cut in half with butter or spread on them.. mmm...

Absolutely outstanding.  Everyone (family and hubby's co-workers) gobbled these down.  I got many rave reviews for these muffins.

These muffins are moist, rich and extremely delicious.  The best recipe I've ever found.

These look like bakery muffins, they're beautiful!  I halved the recipe to make only a dozen, and I think I used more than a cup of sour cream, just kind of eyeballed it.  I also had a whole pint of blueberries, so I dumped the whole thing in there, and it make a dozen large muffins that were as pretty as they were tasty.  I will use this recipe often!

Great muffin recipe, I loved the sour cream it added a nice texture.  Received many compliments on them as well. I added a pint of blueberries and 3/4 cup of oil.  I read also to dust the blueberries with flour first so I also did that.  Will make again and again. Thanks.

These muffins were sooooooooo good!  They had a great creamy taste and an all together good flavor.  I added extra blueberries, which made the muffins taste even better.  They were a big hit in my family.  Thanks for sharing!

We halved this recipe and it was very simple and delicious.  My only complaint was that the blueberry bites weren't especially sweet but that could be because we used store bought frozen blueberries.  Next time, I would mix half the sugar with the eggs and sprinkle the other half on the blueberries while preparing the batter.  That way, it's not using any extra sugar but kind of concentrating it on the blueberries.

I've been searching for a great blueberry muffin recipe and finally found it!  Super easy.  Not too sweet, but very yummy.  I dressed mine up with a sprinkling of coarse 'sugar in the raw', which looked very pretty.  Next time I'll add a little lemon zest for variation.

These are fabulous; very moist.  They freeze wonderfully and because of the moistness, you don't need to add a topping like butter or cream cheese.  Just reheat, and head off to work.  I have also used strawberries and sprinkled in some allspice.

One word....AWESOME!!!!  These are the best muffins I've ever tasted.  Extremely moist and delicious.  The only change I made was to add a little more blueberries.  I even shared some with my coworkers and they loved them.  They were gone in a flash.  Yummy muffins!

This recipe hasn't garnered all those rave reviews by accident!  These are great muffins.  I followed the recipe to the letter and was rewarded with beautiful results.  Have no fear, the best blueberry muffin is here.

I scaled the recipe to 12 muffins, used lowfat sour cream, egg beaters, and added one mashed ripe banana and 1TBSP orange juice - yummy!  More like pound cake than muffin texture, however.

A little to plain for me. I would add brown sugar to it. It is a good recipe for a large crowd.

Very cake-like.  Our family prefers a lighter muffin.  I added a Tbsp. of milk, but they were still heavy. Not very sweet either.

My daughter wanted to bake muffins, so we Googled and found this recipe. WOW... 5 stars she said! Very moist and fluffy muffins. We did add the extra half cup of sugar, but otherwise followed to the letter. We made the 2 dozen and had enough to make a loaf pan full too! Highly recommend!

Followed MommyFromSeattle's review in that I added that extra 1/2c sugar and I think it was too much for our tastes, next time I will try w/o it, or maybe go down to 1/4c.  I had a 10oz bag of frozen blueberries, and that was a little more than 2c, and was just too lazy to get the cinnamon down >.

Good muffins, I halved and got 16 muffins that baked in 25 minutes. My batter was too thin so I had to add more flour, used half all purpose and half whole wheat flour, added more blueberries as it seemed too little and a dash of cinnamon.

I made the "To Die For . . . " blueberry muffins from this site, and then I tried these. I think these are much better--much more substantial and not too sweet. Best of all, you can really taste the blueberries in these. (In the To Die For recipe, the dominant tastes are cinnamon and sugar.) Other than halving the recipe, I made these as written, no deviations.

Incredibly good! 2 cups blueberries were not enough, though. I'd used all the blueberries in the batter, and there was batter leftover, so I threw in some chocolate chunks, and baked them as mini muffins. Both were big hits in Fort Wayne.

due to dietary needs I used half sugar and half splenda, lite sour cream and white whole wheat flour.  I also halved the recipe since we didn't need 24 in the house for 2 people.  I was very happy to find that with the changes I needed to make that the muffins quality did not suffer in the least!  This one is a keeper!

Don't substitute applesauce for the oil like I did. Huge mistake. Tasted ok but the texture was off. Remade recipe exactly as listed and they were wonderful.

This is one of the best blueberry muffin receipes I have found and is a keeper. I made it with only one exception.  I substituted the oil with Smuckers "Baking Healthy" oil and shortening replacement to cut the fat a bit.  These turned out very tasty.  Can't wait to surprise my blueberry lover husband with these when he gets home!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe but I'm always looking to make all my baked goods just a bit healthier while retaining their deliciousness. *I replaced 1c of flour for 1c of wheat germ, cut the sugar in half to 1c instead of 2 and used 1c greek yogurt and 1c sour cream instead of two cups sour cream. They're perfect! Absolutely delicious and not too sweet with some added vitamin E and protein!

I took the advice of another reviewer and added the sour cream into the egg mixture and added 3 pints of blueberries all together.  Used 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white.  These turned out perfect!  Second batch of 12 I only baked for 18 minutes (just a preference thing, 20 min was a more golden finish than I wanted).  Have made these before as I had them written in my recipe book, but not sure I had reviewed these to die for muffins yet!

bakery quality.  rich, light and perfect.  just follow the recipe exactly and you shouldn't have any problems.  just make sure you alternate dry ingredients/sour cream and fold in the berries and don't mix too much and they'll be perfect.

I made these in hope to sell them at a bake sale tomorrow.  However, there is NO WAY I will be doing that! I'm sorry, but they have no flavor.  I have tired doctoring them up and I'm having no hope!  I can't believe this is rated so high. Usually I trust the reviews, but this has left me in unbelief! I will not be making this again! I give 2 stars for looks, but 0 for taste!

I agree with a few of the others. So bland and definitely need more sugar. I'll keep searching. We were all very disapointed in these. Keep looking for a better recipe.

I Hate this recipe... My husband fell in love with it and now I'm a slave to the muffins!!!  He devours 2-3 at a time, so I made him start bringing them to work to teach him about sharing.  Two additions: For one batch, I substituted strawberries for blueberries. Delicious! Also, I add a dollop (maybe 1/4 tsp) of cream cheese right on top of the muffin before I bake it.  Yummy!

YUM! I only made half the recipe, and it made 12 really big muffins. I added more blueberries, more like 1 and a half cups (I didn't measure) and also added half a teaspoon of nutmeg, which really tasted nice. I used 1/3 cup of oil (instead of 1/2) and used fat free sour cream. I was worried they wouldn't turn out without all the fat from regular sour cream, but they are nice and soft and fluffy. A couple tips: the recipe says to mix the dry ingredients and alternate with the sour cream, but the muffins might get tough this way. I mixed everything BUT the flour (even the baking soda and salt) together (in the order listed) then added the flour in two additions, and used a spatula to fold it in. And don't use a mixer, it overbeats it and you get tough muffins. Because my muffins were pretty big, I had to bake them an extra 5 minutes, and they turned nice and golden on top. The only thing with using the fat free sour cream (or plain yogurt I imagine) is that the muffins have a slight tang to them (which I love) but if your berries are tart, it might not be pleasant.

Yum!!! I only had 1 cup of sour cream, so I added a cup of vanilla yogurt. It tastes excellent!! I also used 1 1/2 cups of regular sugar, and 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar (not packed). Turned out great and my husband said it was the best blueberry muffin ever! Whoop!

Loved this recipe and got rave reviews from my coworkers when I brough tthem to work to share. I can't imagine why anyone would add more sugar. I found themplenty sweet. If anything I might reduce sugar a little. I did add extra blueberries and added some strawberries as well because I like lots of fruit. I followed the directions when mixing (alternating ingredients, etc.) and the muffins were as light and as noist as could be.  In a word.....DELICIOUS !!!!

I used tips from other reviewers (used 1 1/4 cup each brown & white sugars, added 2 tsp cinnamon to batter, 3 cups of berries, added struesel topping). I also added the zest & juice of one lemon. I got 15 jumbo-sized muffins. I wasn't a big fan of them fresh out of the oven but this morning I found they taste a lot better.

These muffins are wonderful.  I always double the amount of blueberries that are mentioned in a recipe and this was no exception.  And as usual, I dusted the blueberries in flour before gently folding them into the batter to keep them from sinking although the batter was rather thick and I probably didn’t need to.  The muffins are delicious and have great flavor and texture.    This is a great recipe and I will be making them again.

Well, my husband said it was the best blueberry muffin he's ever had!  I was force to substitute about 1/4 C of the sour cream with vanilla yogurt because I was low (I halved the recipe so I used about 3/4 C sour cream).  I also added 1/2 tsp baking powder in addition to the soda.  I topped with a crumb topping and baked at 375 (convection) for about 22 minutes.  Wonderful! UPDATE: Made the full recipe with all sour cream and addind extra baking powder and they were even better.

Had to substitute vanilla yogurt for sour cream (I was out), but other than that these were divine. Tried with and without the streusel topping from the To Die For Blueberry Muffins recipe and it's good both ways. This is very moist and tender. Absolutely perfect! Thanks for an astounding recipe.

Yummy!  Nice and moist recipe.  I added turbano sugar to top before baking other than that, no changes.  Would probably add a few more blueberries next time.

These are amazing! I've made them twice this week - once with frozen blueberries and once with fresh - I will say nothing beats fresh blueberries, but they were delicious either way!  I am now deleting all other saved bluebery muffin recipes I have.  The only thing I changed/added, was to sprinkle a little crystalized sugar over them before baking - definitely not needed, but I like the fancy sparkly look it creats for presentation :-)

I made these today but halved the recipe.  They were very good.  The batter was kindof thick so I thinned it with a little apple juice.  I didn't measure-I just poured in till it got to the right consistancy.  I'm sucker for all things bread, but as a couple others mentioned, I did find something lacking a little in the finished product.  Maybe next time I will try using some brown sugar too as others have done.  I did add a little cinnamon and a tad of nutmeg.  I liked those additions very much.  I buy blueberry applesauce with no added sugar for my kids.  Perhaps next time I will substitute that for the oil.

In all, though, I thought these were very tasty.  The texture was light and good and i prefer these to boxed muffins any day!

I cut the recipe in half, which yielded me 12 gorgeous, delicious blueberry muffins.  My husband and I agree that these are one of the best blueberry muffin recipes out there.  They are light and tender and bursting with blueberries.  They rose up perfectly while baking.  We are now on our second day eating these, and they are just as good today.

Pretty good!  Not the best muffins I've ever had but definitely satisfactory.  I made them with plain full-fat yogurt instead of the sour cream, which perhaps made a bit of difference but I find that yogurt subs for sour cream in recipes pretty well.  I think they just needed something, maybe a little cinnamon or brown sugar?  Regardless, they fit the bill for using up both some blueberries and yogurt that had hung out in my fridge a bit too long for fresh eating.

These were not good.  Very thick & not sweet at all.  Might have been better w a streusel on top -- but I won't be making them again to find out.  So disappointing b/c I only had 1 package of fresh blueberries & was craving blueberry muffins this morning.

This recipe lives up to its rating.  I used butter, almost melted.  I always choose butter over oil.  I also followed other suggestions and used half brown sugar, half white.  
Since I used butter that was not totally melted, my batter was thick.  I added a little (almond) milk to thin it.  Using oil, this probably would not be necessary.  
When mixing, I added the sour cream to the sugar/egg mixture, then added the flour mixture.  
I also made some mini-loaves.  
It tastes wonderful.  Rich, moist.  It definitely rivals my mother-in-law's!

These were incredible, gourmet bakery at it's best!
I chose to split the sugar using 1 1/4 cups EACH of sugar & brown sugar,  1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, and a SMALL amount of hazelnut extract (made by Watkins).  I also added a streusel topping 3/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 3 Tablespoons butter.

These were SCRUMPTIOUS! I plan on using this as a base recipe for any other muffins I may make in the future!

Thanks for sharing!

I made these muffins last night and was very pleased with the way they turned out. I added a lot more blueberries and decided against adding the extra sugar. I was happy with the sweetness level and the texture of the muffin was very light. This is definitely my favorite blueberry muffin recipe.

Oh my, these are so delicious! My search for the perfect blueberry muffin is finally over. I liked them so much better than the higher rated blueberry muffins on this site. I filled my liners almost to the top and I still got a little more than 2 dozen. I did add extra blueberries and sprinkled the top with a little raw sugar. If you use paper liners, be sure to use the foil liners. Know that when they pack the liners, they use foil and paper, making them easier to separate. I use the foil with fruit muffins and nothing sticks to them at all. Then I save the paper liners for cupcakes.

I only had 1/2 cup of blueberries on hand so I quartered the recipe with great results.  Creamy and moist...would be great as a base for lemon poppy seed muffins.  Can't wait for Michigan blueberries to come in season to try this again!

These were good, not exceptional though.  I used whole wheat flour and no vanilla since I was out of it, and added cinnamon per some other reviews.  They were good, but not a ton of taste.

Fantastic! I only have mini muffin tins so I converted recipe to 12 muffins and baked for 15 minutes. Did the trick, but the tops weren't quite brown enough, so I brushed them with butter and put them under low broiler for 3 minutes. Yum!

This recipe is a great basic muffin that adapts to variations well.  Substituting chocolate chips for the blueberries is one option, but I add an additional teaspoon or two of high quality vanilla. I have also made them with cinnamon chips, which are delicious with a crumb topping.  When I use blueberries, I add a couple squirts of lemon juice which adds a nice fresh flavor.

These are lacking sugar. I made them the first time with the measurements the recipe called for....but they were not sweet enough, so I tried them a second time and added an extra cup of sugar and they were still just "ok" the "to die for blueberry muffins" on this site are amazing. I just made them and ate 3...I can't stop...that's how good they are. definitely will be making them again :)

Lovely muffins.  I cut the recipe in half with no problem, except I used a full tsp. vanilla instead of halving it and the full 2 cups of blueberries.  Six muffins were made according to the recipe, with the exceptions above, and six I added a large dollop of blueberry jam on top before baking, which made for a nice surprise blueberry middle.  Yielded 12 very large muffins.  Oh, and I had to bake them for a full 26 minutes, but that was probably because I filled the paper cups right to the top.  I'm going to try this recipe again for a holiday bake sale using cranberries and nuts.  All-in-all, an easy and adaptable recipe.

I cut sugar by 1/3 cup and used just 1 cup sour cream mostly  because I spaced.  Still good. Made 18 jumbo muffins. Used heaping t. of vanilla and added heaping 1/4 t. lemon extract to pop the flavor.

Wonderful recipe!  My tweaks were few...for 1/2 the recipe I used 1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 brown sugar.  I also added raw sugar on top just before baking for an added crunch.  SOOO moist and yummy!

I thought these were a three but my family loved them so giving them a four. Used half blueberries and half raspberries. Recipe seemed a bit bland however I think I am just use to the super sweet box mixes.

These were excellent! It made 12 huge muffins and I still had batter left over.  I did need to cook mine for approximately 30 minutes.

Delicious.  I only made a couple adjustments, basically due to ingredients I had on hand.  I used half sour cream, and half vanilla yogurt (which actually tasted awesome).  I also used half white sugar and half brown.  Also half oil, and half applesauce (just couldn't do it).  I think I used one extra cup of blueberries, and I sprinkled the top of the muffins with a sugar/cinnamon mixture before I baked them.  These were TOTALLY AWESOME. I'm going to bake more for school lunches now!!

These are good, but not my favorite. I didn't think there was anything special about them...just a basic blueberry muffin; which actually is not a bad thing, I was just expecting more, because of all the outstanding reviews. I think I prefer the Jordan Marsh Style Blueberry muffins on this site.

Mmm... It's on the level of a warm shower or a sunny day. Definately worthy comfort food.   It's soo moist (even the loaf I refrigerated overnight) and it reminds me of those Japenese cheesecakes with it's texture.   I originally made this for my mother who complained that I was 'wasting food' when all I'd bake is low-fat muffins so I made this especially for her and made another batch of fiber muffins on the side, but I got to say this muffin (though it's kind of cupcakey) makes the other look pretty shabby... I baked for 5 min. extra and added a extra 1/2 cup for the blueberry TANG, turned out perfect but I couldn't taste any of the cinnamon I put in so maybe next time 1 and a 1/2 tblspoons will fix that.

This is a perfect Blueberry muffin recipe.  The muffins come out of the oven like bakery quality muffins.  I make them all year round with summer blueberries I keep in the freezer.  I sprinkle the muffin tops with sugar just before popping them in the oven for a nice crunchy sugar top!  YUMMMMM!

I made a half batch of these muffins making some minor changes.  I used half brown and half white sugar, increased the blueberries to 1 1/2 cups (for my half batch), and added 3/4  t. cinnamon - all suggestions made by other reviewers.  My batch yielded 14 nice sized muffins.  These were very good and I wouldn't hesitate to make them again!  Thank you!!

The best blueberry muffin I've ever made.  Works well using 1/2 cup applesauce to replace 1/2 cup of the oil. Vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream.  Another half cup of blueberries is good too. Added a half  teaspoon of nutmeg with the flour.  I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking, had that perfect delicate crisp crust on top, moist on the inside.

So sweet .. sorry... it was like eating sugar dough with blueberries! The only reason I gave it one star is because the end product was light and fluffy. Really a shame I cant find a recipe with this muffin texture that isn't overly sweet.

I cut the ingredients in half and managed to make 15 good size muffins. Didn't have sour cream on hand so traded it with a cup of blueberry yogurt. Turned out delish! Fluffy and moist. I did not have a problem with the muffins rising and popping their top. However, with 5 of 20 min remaining, the color was too light for me so I turned it up to 450 degrees for the remaining time. It's probably just a personal preference but I like to mix the dry ingredients first before working on the wet. Other than that, great recipe and I'll definitely make again soon!

YUM! I also added 1/2 cup of sugar and used 1/2 white sugar/half brown. Added a crumb top. Make sure if you use fresh blueberries to roll them in a bit of flour to keep them from sinking.

5 Stars for this recipe with my changes. I increased the blueberries to 3 cups and used a double batch of the  streusel topping from "To Die for Blueberry Muffins" on this site.   I also used substituted splenda for the white sugar, and used 1/2 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.   This is a great "base" recipe for muffins. Delicious and highly versatile

I scaled this recipe down to just 6 servings for a little treat, and suprisingly, the amounts were still measurable.  I used organic whole sugar and olive oil in place of vegetable oil.  It doesn't taste of olive oil since all that sweetness overpowers it completely.  Just a little healthier.  I picked out the blueberries from a frozen triple berry mix.  The texture is very cake-like, which is what I was looking for.  You could easily bake this one in a cake pan and call it blueberry cream cake.  There's something special about this recipe.  Must be the sour cream!

I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.  They're certainly not better than a good bakery's muffins; even the supermarket bakeries in my town have this recipe beat hands down.  They're good; not great.  Not good enough for me to give up a trip to the bakery!

This is my family's new homemade blueberry muffin recipe - I actually got 2 1/2 dozen from the mix - and I followed it to the letter - I've never seen blueberry muffins bake up as beautifully as these - and they taste as wonderful as they bake - not too sweet; just right - if you can get blueberries from Costco or Sam's Club (the ginormous kind) - I highly recommend those for more blueberry bursting flavor!

These are delicious muffins.  I used low fat sour cream and they turned out just great.  They made 12 very large muffins and 9 mini loaf muffins.  I would also put a little more than 2 cups of blueberries next time, need to make sure that every muffin has several blueberries in them.

This is the bakery-style muffin recipe I have been looking for! Next time I will add more blueberries and add the crumb topping from the "To Die for Blueberry Muffins," (which tasted like Duncan Hines to me), and it will be perfect!

Just made these today.  They were easy and tasted great.  I suggest cutting the recipe in half because it made a pretty large number of muffins.  I made it into mini-muffins and baked them for 10-12 minutes.  I also added an oatmeal streusel topping but it oozed off onto the pan and made a mess.  Either way, they were yummy and I will make them again.

These were the BEST muffins ever!!  I made the simple changes as other reviewers suggested, and believed it made all the difference!  3 cups of FRESH blueberries, 1 1/4 cup white 1 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I also topped them with the crumb/streusel topping from the To Die for muffin recipe.  PERFECT!!!  They were gone in a flash.

Very tasty and very easy!  I used half whole wheat flour, light sour cream and 1/3 c unsweetened applesauce with 2/3 c oil.  One full dry pint of fresh blueberries.  Very moist and sweet. Recipe made about 27 muffins.  Would have been prettier with coarse sugar crystals sprinkled on top!

I've been baking since I was a kid and have made blueberry muffins many times. Every other recipe I've ever used has been so-so. Usually sort of dense/rubbery and too wet, or too dry. I've been using this recipe since I found it last year after I went blueberry picking. This is the ONLY bb muffin recipe I'll ever use. They're bakery quality and stay fluffy,tender and just moist enough. I top them with a crumb mixture of 3TBSP butter, 1/3 c. flour and 1/4 c. brown sugar. I've gotten nothing but compliments from using this recipe.

This is now my favorite blueberry muffin recipe.  Quick, easy, and very flavourful! Nice and moist with the sourcream. No changes needed on this one. Thanks for the fantastic recipe KK3.

Great recipe - only cut in half, didn't change a thing. Had a little batter left over. They were great out of the oven and great hours later without anything on them. I've been trying blueberry muffin recipes for a long time and this will be the one I use from now on.

I substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream and it was perfection.  Bumped up the health-factor a notch without sacrificing the flavor.

I used our own fresh frozen blueberries.  They are a bit sour, so I added some sugar to the blueberries prior to putting together the recipe.  The sweetening of the blueberries + this recipe = a family approved muffin!

Made these today and they are fabulous. Used 3 cups of berries, and added 2T lemon juice and zest.  Goes great with blueberries.  Also put cinnamon, sugar topping on them before baking.

This was a VERY good muffin recipe but the texture(light and airy) was all off in my opinion. I made only half the muffin batter and was shocked by the 1 cup of oil required to make these. Next time, I want to substite half oil and half applesauce. Maybe this will make them more dense. If not, the third time I make these, decrease sour cream using 1/4 cup less and adding 1/4 cup flour more. ***UPDATE*** I made 24 muffins. Half were made as directed and the other half had 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce. I couldn't tell the difference between the 2. Next time, I'll decrease the sugar to make it more healthy and see how it goes. ***UPDATE*** I did bake these by accident at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and then 400 degrees for 10 minutes. The muffin texture was great! It was drier and not so soggy from the blueberries.

These are delicious. The texture is dense yet a bit airy. The muffins are moist too. The flavor complements the blueberries very well. Substitutions made due to what was available in pantry: used splenda instead of sugar, used 1/2 C applesauce and 1/2 C veg. oil instead of full C veg. oil and only had 1-1/2 cups of frozen blueberries.

These were super fluffy and pretty just like the bakery's.  They were great with a powdered sugar and lemon zest drizzle.  I fed 50 people at a church breakfast function and everyone raved and asked for the recipe.  You cannot go wrong with this one.

I had some fresh blueberries in the freezer so I decided to make blueberry muffins. I found this recipe to be wonderful. The muffins were light and fluffy and I got 30 muffins out of a batch. I added 3 cups of blueberries instead of 2, but that is the only change I made. My husband said he liked them better than the last ones I made, and that was a recipe written by a famous Food Network Chef!

Don't get mad at me!  I changed the recipe a little bit because I wanted to make it healthier- and I can tell you it worked!  I didn't use ANY oil - I used sweetened (it's all I had) applesauce and 1/2 C ground flax seed with 2 tbsp water.  I also used LIGHT sour cream.  They came out really ugly, and I was afraid they would be really dense.  BUT THEY WERE LIGHT AND FLUFFY!  Even with the flax seed!  They were ugly, but tasted good.  My only complaint - maybe I would have added more blueberries.  (I used frozen.)

These are delicious, and I was never a fan of blueberry muffins until I tried these! I did add an extra 3/4 cup of sugar and next time I'll add an extra cup of blueberries. I sprinkled sugar on top before baking. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wonderful recipe.  I made this recipe with some modifications from MommyFromSeattle, I did use 3 cups of frozen blueberries, 50/50 sugar and light brown sugar, added ½ cup extra sugar to the frozen blueberries, (use the streusel topping recipe, from To Die For Blueberry Muffins off this site).  I added an additional 1 tsp of Vanilla too.  I was a little worried about the texture of my batter, it was a little gooey, I over mixed but my muffins turned out great.  My husband and I loved them.  Thank you KK3 for this delicious recipe and the other reviewers for the tweaks.  I will defiantly make this recipe again.

We were extremely happy with this recipe. I did modify it a bit by using 1 cup buttermilk and 1 cup greek yogurt as I did not have sour cream. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Will definitely make it again!!
Thanks for the recipe.

I also did half white sugar and half brown sugar and frozen blueberries. These are very yummy but I also think they need a crumbly topping.

Topping: 1/4 cup each white & brown sugar, 1/3 cup flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon & 1/4 butter

These are the best blueberry muffins ever!  I followed the recipe but instead of 24 small I got 10 extra, extra large
beauties.  I gave these friends and all said they were the best muffins they ever tasted - one 86 year old man said
they were even better than our local large grocery store with it's own bakery - now that is saying something. Thanks for this gem an I am making more today but 2 dozen small ones - I think they will go further....

delicious.  this is a rather dense muffin.  i added a few more blueberries and sprinkled the tops with cinnamon and sugar before baking.  i greased the muffin tins, but since this is such a dense muffin, i recommend using paper liners as it was hard to get the muffin out intact.

I made this recipe exactly as written - including using just white sugar and folding in the sour cream as instructed (I've never done this in a muffin recipe but it wasn't difficult - don't let this step scare you).  These are to die for! No changes needed AT ALL and definitely bakery quality.  Thanks to whoever said to fill the muffin cups all the way to the top.  My muffins looked beautiful.  I also tried this recipe with the fresh raspberries from our backyard and they turned out wonderful.  My only suggestion is if you want to use raspberries with this recipe...maybe sprinkle them with sugar first before folding them into the batter as they can be a bit tart.  This recipe is definitely worthy of Bree on Desperate Housewives ;)  Thanks - this will be a keeper in our family.

These were fantastic.  I did not change the recipe at all, but used frozen blueberries (without thawing them).  They needed to bake for about 28 minutes, but that may be because the frzen berries chilled the batter.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

These are sooo good!!  I used two cups of white sugar and added a little cinnamon as others had suggested.  Instead of sour cream I used 2 cups of strawberry yogurt.  And I topped the muffins with a mixture of brown sugar, butter, nutmeg and cinnamon.  They are delicious!!  I can't wait to make these again.

when i was in high school, we went berry picking every year and the owners of the farm gave out recipes and one was a sour cream blueberry muffin recipe that was AMAZING, but i lost it.  this recipe, with some modifications, is the closest i've found.  first, definately need 3 cups of blueberries.  secondly, several shakes of nutmeg.  and lastly, mix equal parts nutmeg and sugar and sprinkle muffin tops before putting it in the oven.  YUM!  oh, and only real sour cream will do, don't use reduced fat or yogurt or something like that.  if you want to experience these muffins, use real ingredients!  thanks for the recipe!

Made only half of the recipe as fresh blueberries are way too expensive here. Also added some cinnamon and nutmeg. I LOOOVE the texture of this muffin... so soft and moist. I think this need a little bit more sugar as other viewers suggested. My problem was with the blueberries. This is the first time I tasted fresh blueberries, and it tasted so bland. Is this how it's suppose to taste? Next time I'll try using canned or pie filling blueberries. Other than the sweetness, I'd prefer this to "To Die For Blueberry Muffin" recipe.

I made both these muffins and the Blueberry Orange muffins from this site. Four out of five people preferred this recipe. I found these muffins to be richer, tastier, and better looking. I did tweak the recipe slightly, based on others' reviews -- my goal was more to make a good muffin than to be able to review this recipe exactly as written, but the changes were minor and the results were good enough to review! My changes were: added 1 cup of blueberries, 1/4 cup of sugar, a little orange zest, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a cinnamon sugar topping. I recommend stirring the sour cream into the liquid ingredients before adding them to the dry ingredients. I had started out adding the sour cream separately as the recipe indicated, but soon felt like that would lead to overmixing, since the sour cream gets lumpy when added by itself. I did have problems with some muffins turning out underbaked in the center -- so a light touch on the mixing and as long a baking time as possible is recommended. Anyway, I love them and so did everyone else! Will make again.

Made these using some of the suggestions posted by others...added lemon juice/zest to the batter,as well as a little extra vanilla and cinnamon. Still seemed to be lacking a bit in flavor, and the blueberries I used weren't particularly sweet.  They were ok I guess not amazing...

This is a very nice, basic recipe.  The muffins were good but I think the box mix would have been just as good.  If you have leftover blueberries then this recipe may be for you.  (Others, suggested that these do not compare to box muffins; according to these individuals, these muffins are substantially better.) Just a note of advice, if choose to make jumbo muffins your cooking time will increase to about 30 minutes. Update: Adding 1/3 cup of sugar makes this a 5 star recipe.

These were good muffins even though I made the following substitutions:  Egg Beaters for the eggs, granular Splenda for the sugar, applesauce for the vegetable oil, a mixture of whole wheat and soy flour for the all-purpose, and I used fat free sour cream.

Fabulous!  I cut this recipe in half and cut back on the sugar just a little.  I've also made these with half white flour and half whole wheat pastry flour and they come out great.  I think this recipe comes out best when done by hand with a whisk.

I wasn't sure how this would turn out since the reviews seemed mixed (even thought the overall rating was a 5).  I thought they were great.  Perfect consistency - not too heavy.  Also I liked that they weren't really sweet.  Allows the blueberries to flavor it more than added sugar.

These muffins are delicious and very moist.  I did make a few changes after reading others comments - I used 1 cup of Splenda and 1 cup of brown sugar, 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla, and 1 1/2 tsp. baking soda.  I also used melted butter instead of oil and I opted to go with fat free sour cream.  They were perfectly sweetened and full of flavour.  I will definitely make these again!!

This is the best blueberry muffin recipe I have ever tried!!!  I did make some changes based on other reviews.  I replaced the oil with 2 sticks of melted butter and added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also used 1.5 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  Some other reviews mentioned the muffins not being sweet enough, so I'd recommend tasting the batter and adding more/less sugar according to what you like.  For my oven, I got better muffin peaks at 450 degrees over 23 minutes, and the recipe gave me 30 muffins.

Good muffins- my main bluberry muffin recipe now. I add 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder as recommended by others. For a healthier muffin, cut eggs down to 3 instead of 4, (or use Egg Beaters), use 3/4 cup of oil (or substitute half or more of the oil with applesauce), use half whole wheat flour and reduced fat sour cream.

Wow.  These are so good!  I added 1/2 t of nutmeg and it gave them such a great flavor.  I also added a sugar streussel topping which made them a little too sweet--probably used too much, but they go so well with milk.  I used a stoneware jumbo muffin tin to make them, so they took 35 minutes to bake.  Just a note of caution, if you use a streussel, put a baking sheet under the muffin pan to catch the runoff; found that one out the hard way.  Off to clean the oven!

Wonderful!!!  I added Frozen Mixed Berries instead of blueberries and some orange zest... The best muffins i've made!!  Not too sweet, but not plain at all!!
Half the recipe made 16+ regular sized muffins! Add more berries then the recipe calls for!!  
  Would be Great as muffin tops!!

This was my first try making muffins with fresh blueberries.  My whole family loved these muffins, & the kids keep asking for them.  We'll never go back to the boxed ones!  The recipe does make a lot--I can get 24 muffins and a 9x13" pan of snack cake from one batch.  The finished batter is a little stiff, so I add in 1/2 cup of water before putting it in the muffin tins.  I've also tried using semisweet chocolate chips instead of blueberries, which turned out great too.  The semisweet chips & the sour cream were a bit too much on the sour side, so I also added 1/4-1/2 cup of sugar the 2nd time I tried it.  Thanks for a great recipe!!  I can't wait to try it with other berries too.  Delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and got 24 amazingly moist muffins!  They baked up so nice with perfectly round tops ~ very pretty!  I stored them in a covered (plastic) container and they tasted even better the next day.  I have never had such a moist blueberry muffin.  GREAT recipe!

The muffins rose and looked good.  However, 400 degrees for 20 minutes is a bit much they were burnted.  If I make them the next time, I would suggest decreasing the temperature and the baking time.

When tasted straight out of the oven they rate only a two (very bland) but after sitting overnight the flavor improved greatly. I recommend making these the day before serving for the best taste.

These looked beautiful and the texture was great, but I expected a little more from the flavor - especially after all the wonderful reviews.  I think I'll add more sugar next time, and maybe more vanilla.  Really good overall though.

After reading reviews from others that this had a cake like texture, I decided to make it as one.  I halved the recipe, substituted the sugar with half Splenda, half sugar, (my first baking experience with Splenda, next time I may use all Splenda)used reduced fat sour cream and 1 cup of frozen blueberries thawed and rinsed.  Put this in an 8 X 8 pan and bake at 350 degrees for 55 minutes.  It turned out great.  Served each piece with a spoonful of fat free Cool Whip.  Not too sweet.

Pretty good.  The only way I will eat a blueberry is if it is in a mufin.  I love the taste of blueberries but hate to actually eat cooked fruit in bread.  Next time I will chop up the blueberries in a blender or food processor.  This may be extreme, but other than that the flavor of the muffin was good!  Dense and moist!  Tasted kinda like cake.  Tasted better than any store bought .

These muffins are absolutely delicious!  Moist, fluffy, and a huge hit.

I found that they actually yield close to 3 dozen rather than 2 dozen though.

These muffins are fantastic. I substituted buttermilk for the sour cream  and 3 heaping cups of blueberries, I also used 1 pkg of vanilla sugar instead of the vanilla extract. They turned out wonderfully and are just flying off the plate. I will definately be making these again soon!

Excellent moist muffins!  I admit I used fat-free vanilla yogurt instead of the sour cream since that is what I had at home though I don't usually like to change other people's recipes.  They turned out so moist and delicious my husband and I ate four each!  These are a must for any breakfast or brunch get togethers.

These were excellent, so moist and tasty.  I scaled to half and it still made 6 extra.  Next time I will add 1/2 cup extra blueberries.

These are really great muffins!  I used frozen chopped blueberries because my kids aren't fans of huge chunks of fruit in their muffins and they are still very good!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great muffins! I added a little lemon zest and 
a cinnamon crumb topping and were they a hit!!
My husband brought them to work and they were
fighting each other off for seconds.

Great, easy recipe.  I put a sprinkle of white sugar on the muffins before baking, and it made a nice, crispy top.  I also found that 350 was a better baking time for me, but it could have just been my oven.  I had to reduce the temperature when the muffins started browning too early.

I loved these!! Very moist and cake-like. I made them twice in one week, once with blueberries and once with raspberries. Both versions were wonderful.  This recipe easily makes two dozen muffins.  I got 32 muffins both times and I was filling the muffin cups almost to the top.

I have finally found a great recipe for blueberry muffins with this recipe.  These came out so soft and light - very, very good.  I have been trying all of the blueberry muffins on this site, and this is the best one. I halved the recipe and they still worked out great. (Note:I used unthawed frozen blueberries and added an extra half cup of them to boot, which added about 10 minutes extra cooking time)

Easy to make! Blueberry muffins can be so dry. The sour cream TRULY is the secret ingredient. Probably the best blueberry muffin recipe I will ever see as far as BOTH prep and taste are concerned!

Didn’t have enough blueberries, so I diced up some sweet cherries. Substituted Greek no-fat yogurt for the sour cream. Use what you have. Worked great. As a surprise ingredient, added 1/4 cup heath bits for added sweetness. Delicious! This is a keeper

Instead of sour cream I used yogurt. I replaced all purpose flour with whole wheat. I also used 1 cup blue berries and 1 cup blackberries instead. It’s what I had laying around. I did 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. And added 1tsp vanilla. Came out great.

I made the batter exactly as posted but added a small cube of cream cheese to the center of the of 12 muffins before baking. (My daughter has been craving cream cheese filled blueberry muffins.)

* 4 oz cream cheese cut into 12 equal pieces (for anyone interested in trying it)

The rest of the batter was used to make 48 mini muffins.

These muffins are great (with or without the cream cheese) and I will definitely make them again.

These are my go to blueberry muffins. I usually substitute applesauce for the oil & use 1c whole wheat flour with 3c of white flour. I use fresh or frozen blueberries. If frozen, add right before putting in muffin tins to keep from "freezing" the batter. Sometimes they take a little longer to bake with frozen. I think the temperature should be turned down a little (375 or 350) since they darken up a little fast. They make 26-30 muffins.

Delicious! I took advice from Seattle mommy Baker. I used 3 cups of blueberries and half brown sugar half white. I tend to do this anyways with baking because brown sugar is so good!  I also added 1/2 a tablespoon of vanilla for the same reason. I used a regular muffin pan and filled to the top (no liners) and it made 21 muffins each bite full of blueberries! this is a wonderful recipe!

Use REAL butter instead of oil. Same amount. Never use oil when you can use butter. Also use a 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar. This adds a little depth of flavor.

Just ok. Not really full of flavor even after adding cinnamon, nutmeg and substituting 1 cup brown sugar for 1 cup white sugar as some reviewers suggested. Also the estimate of a 10 minute prep was way off for me. It took at least 30 - 40 mins of measuring, mixing and scooping into 24 muffin cups.

I made these as mini muffins for my daughter's preschool class, and they were perfect! Not too sweet, but plenty moist. Since I was using a mini muffin tin I did drop the temperature to 375 and baked for 15 minutes, but that was the only adjustment. Thank you for a great recipe!

Wow! These may be the best blueberry muffins I have ever eaten. They are not cakey or crumbly. They are something else entirely. Dense, moist, rich. CREAMY. They have a fantastic crispness on the outside. Incredibly moist on the inside. The flavor of the cake is delicious, I would eat these without the blueberries! These are to die for. I followed the recipe exactly, I really focused on the mixing methods. I beat the eggs, sugar, oil, and vanilla using a whisk, slowly adding each ingredient. Switched to a spoon to add the dry ingredients and sour cream, alternating between the two until just mixed in, careful not to over mix. Then, carefully folded in the blueberries with just a few turns of my spoon. The muffins rose beautifully, extending well above the top of my muffin pan without spilling out laterally at all. This recipe is so good!!!!

I'm not a baker, and these were easy and delicious. Love that they aren't too sweet. The only modifications I made were that I used half white, and half wheat flour, substituted the oil for applesauce, and used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Other than that, I followed the recipe as is. Might try some lemon zest next time.

Made these twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and they were excellent. A real go to recipe. The second time I added 1 tsp cinnamon, added 1 cup additional blueberries and made a streusel topping. This is truly an ultimate muffin. You won't be sorry if you make these and you will be proud to serve them to guests, too.

I double the blueberries.  We like our muffins to be the old fashion barely sweet type.  The extra blueberries cut the sweetness and adds more flavor.  Soak them first and they will burst into the batter when cooking.

Delicious! As others suggested, I added a 1/2 cup of sugar and used a blend of both white and brown sugars. I also topped with a crumb mix of 1 cup flour, 2 tsp cinnamon, 6 tbsp cold butter, and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar.

These turned out great!  I made some modifications based on some of the feedback from others: 1/2c oil, 1/2c butter, 1 1/4c white sugar and 1 1/4c brown sugar.  The additional 1/2c sugar made this a tad too sweet for my liking.  Next time I'll only add in 1c of each type of sugar.  These were moist and delicious!

Delicious muffins!  They turned out wonderful and I will make them again as they freeze well too!  I would like to try sprinkling with demera sugar for some added sweetness!  I definitely agree adding a bit more sugar and cinnamon would enhance the flavour and I agree you need to mix it up as directed for texture purposes.

Gluten free alternative! I have celiac disease so I adjusted this recipe and the muffins were delish and moist. I halved the recipe bc I didnt want 2 dozen muffins that were like hockey pucks but these were awesome. I used 2 cups of all purpose Gluten free flour with 3/4 teaspoon  Xantham gum and that was the only alterations I had to do to make this gluten free! Yum

Have made these often, we all love them! Easy and delicious.  I follow the recipe exactly, sometimes halving it for a smaller group.

I thought these cake-y muffins were pretty good. I made them as directed, except added more blueberries, doubled the vanilla, and sprinkled the top with a touch of turbinado sugar. I found them to be very moist and quite sweet. I am glad that I didn't add any spices because the simple flavor of the berries was very pleasant. I couldn't try one until the second day, so I don't know how they tasted right out of the oven. They rose beautifully, I am sure due to the mixing method. I filled the muffin cups to the very top and found them to be the perfect size. I do agree that they resemble muffins made from a mix, except these are made with natural ingredients and the fresh berries make a big difference. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, these are excellent muffins. Followed recipe as directed, but halved it to make 12 muffins. Didn't have enough fresh blueberries so I used drained canned blueberries to make up the difference. The fresh blueberries really pop. I will definitely make these again.

This recipe was great, but like the others said, 1 cup of sour cream is perfect. I tried 3 cups of blueberries and while I love blueberries, it made my muffins soggy. Sadly, my family wasn't crazy about them, because of all the blueberries. Also, mine needed another 5 minutes to bake, because the middles were not done. I experimented and noticed that if I baked them in the back of the oven, they got a nicer brown tone and looked like they rose higher, even with the extra 5 minutes. I think baking powder would get better, higher rising results than baking soda.

I was craving some fresh-baked blueberry muffins on this snowy Saturday morning. I had the fresh blueberries, but I needed to make some emergency substitutions because I didn't feel like cleaning off the car. I also halved the recipe. I was out of vegetable oil, so I used coconut oil. No sour cream, so I used plain yogurt that was already open (strained through a coffee filter to remove some of the liquid for about 15 minutes). I was still short 1/3 cup, so I topped it up with mayonnaise. They tasted great! I can imagine they would be divine with the actual ingredients. Now I have to clean off the car and go grocery shopping.

I used half sugar and half Splenda and added more blueberries just because I like extra blueberries.  This recipe is great just the way it is however.  I also made three pans of the mini muffins and then had enough leftover to pour the rest in a bundt pan and make a blueberry cake.  Otherwise it would have been way too many muffins for just the two of us.  If your blueberries aren't very sweet, you will probably want to add a little extra sugar.

Love, love, love this recipe!!! I took the advise of another reviewer and put in less white sugar and added 1/2 cup brown sugar. I think I'll just stick with the original recipe and do the 2 cups of white sugar and no brown sugar. Just to give it that extra kick of sweetness. I added 3 cups of blueberries. But my blueberries were home grown straight from the bush to my freezer. I did not realise how much bigger my blueberries were from store bought ones so there was way to many blueberries in the mix. (Well not according to my hubby, but me and the little ones thought so.) I don't need to look for any other blueberry muffin recipe, this one does the job.

PERFECTION! My son said this was the best blueberry muffin ever! To bring the flavor up a notch try subbing half the oil for peach puree or applesauce. I like that this muffin is tart and not too sweet. If you want it a little sweeter try topping the muffins with some course raw sugar or a streusel topping. This is truly a muffin and not a cake in disguise, perfection!

Incredible!!! Other than doubling the blueberries, I followed the recipe, and we all enjoyed these muffins immensely. The recipe makes nearly three dozen for me, depending on how much batter I sample while baking... UPDATE: I decided to try to make these a bit healthier (I don't know WHAT got into me!! Maybe because I want to bake and eat them too often??). I subbed unsweetened applesauce for the vegetable oil, and plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. The muffins are still good, but a bit spongy, and not quite as delectable as the recipe is as written. Soooo....maybe I'll use the oil again next time, but keep the yogurt since it has a lot of protein. *Maybe*

I love, love, love these muffins.

I made some modifications.  I increased the sugar by 1 cup, doubled the vanilla and increased the blueberries by 1 cup like others have suggested.

I also created a sugar/spice topping that I mixed together and sprinkled on top of each muffin prior to baking.  I used 1/3 cup sugar, about 1-2 tbs. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and about  1-2 tsp. of grated candied ginger.  The candied ginger really knocked this recipe out of the park.

Plan to make this over and over again.

I made this recipe as written, except that I cut it in half, to make only one dozen muffins.  They turned out beautifully - very large, moist muffins.  Lovely texture, but a one-dimensional flavor (sweet)  When I make it again, I'll add some extra blueberries - 1 cup just wasn't enough, and a teaspoon or so of grated lemon rind to cut the sweetness a bit.  Like another reviewer, I used a scoop to make sure that the cups were filled evenly.

I made this and twice the first time they were a little thick but I made it again and changed it a little, added a little honey, but instead of 2 cups of sour cream for a batch of 24 I did one cup of softened cream cheese and one cup of sour cream worked out quite nicely

Great muffin!  I've made these a handful of times.  I usually use yogurt instead of sour cream for the protein.  The most recent time I made them I only had a little yogurt so I did half yogurt and half ricotta cheese.  Oh man were they fantastic.  I also always add extra blueberries.  Delicious :)

Good muffins I expected more flavor. I made them exactly as the recipe suggested. The texture and moistness of the muffins was perfect, but the flavor was a little bland.  I'll follow some of the other reviewer tips the next time I make them.

I made this recipe last night and my family of 5 (including 2 teenaged boys) ate 20 muffins in 18 hours! They were delicious! The modifications I made to the original recipe:  Used 2 C light ricotta cheese instead of  sour cream (that's all I had at home), used 1 1/2 C sugar instead of 2, used 2 TBSP lemon juice (to thin the batter a bit), used about 2 1/2 C fresh blueberries, used 3/4 C applesauce and 1/4 C light olive oil instead of the vegetable oil. They looked and tasted great! Will definitely make these again!

I have been searching for and trying various recipes for blueberry muffins for ages and finally I have found the winner. I followed this recipe exactly ( make sure after you wash your fresh blueberries you let them dry on a paper towel) and though my muffins do not look like those pictured here, they where perfectly rounded, browned beautifully and were so moist and yummy. I'm so in love with the dough, I made a second batch and plumped some golden raisins in warm water for about 20 minutes, dried them on a paper towel and used them in the dough instead of the blueberries. On these, I did use a cinnamon, sugar, butter and flour crumble topping applied prior to baking. Allrecipes has several recipes you can look at for this type of topping. And I must disagree with the folks who posted that they added more sugar to the dough recipe. I think this muffin dough had a lovely home baked flavor - very unlike the store bought, more sugary flavor we find from store bought goods.

These were dense and moist. I also substituted 1 cup brown sugar for one cup of white sugar and used 3 cups blueberries, which this recipe can easily accommodate.  They are VERY sweet. May decrease the sugar next time.

Very good.  I used three cups of fresh blueberries per other reviewers comments.  Tasty!  Made about 27 med-large muffins.

I made this exactly as written except that I added 3 c blueberries.  These are delicious!!  They are firm like a muffin, but smooth because of the sour cream.  There is so much batter that I had to fill the muffin cups all the way to the top to only make 24.  They rose perfectly and look great.  I also sprinkled some sugar on the tops of them when there was about 10 min left of baking time. These are, by far, the best blueberry muffins I have ever made.  I will definitely make them again.

This recipe was lovely. I cut my recipe in half to only make one pan of 12 muffins. 

I did not half the salt and baking soda but kept them at 1 teaspoon each. 

I used frozen blueberries and felt this recipe did not require extra sugar as some others have suggested. I think any extra sugar would have been to sweet for my families tastes. 

If you are using good quality vanilla and fresh good quality eggs this recipe does not need any extra flavor. Any other flavor additions would wipe out the lovely blueberries. 

I will be using this recipe in the future as my go to blueberry muffin recipe. Very yummy!

Family loved this recipe, and ate half of them in one day!  That is the mark of a good recipe!  I only had 1 cup of sour cream, so I used that and 1 cup of Chobani® plain Greek Yogurt.  The muffins baked up really nicely and were very moist.  My muffin tins are smaller (not mini’s) and I did get 36 muffins from this recipe.  Definitely will be making this one again.

I followed the recipe exactly, and they were wonderful. It makes a larger batch and since I have 8 children and 16 Grandchildren,  it was perfect! Thanks for a great recipe.

I absolutely love this muffin recipe!!!  I originally reviewed this recipe a few years ago (making it exactly like recipe states) & it's amazing!  However, today I found blackberries on sale & decided to make blackberry muffins.  Besides blackberries instead of blueberries, I added about an extra 1/2 cup of sugar & sprinkled sugar on top - those were the only changes.  And again, amazing!!!  I'm going to try it with strawberries next!

Yummy - add crumb topping 
To Make Crumb Topping: Mix together 1/2 cup sugar, 1/3 cup flour, 1/4 cup butter, and 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon. Mix with fork, and sprinkle over muffins before baking.

Very good.  I didn't have fresh blueberries on hand, so I used some mixed berries I had in my freezer.  In an attempt for a healthier option, I used apple sauce instead of the oil.  Next time I might try to use greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.

I have never wrote a review before, but this one is worth the effort! 
I have never encountered a muffin with such a beautiful creamy crumb. This is a heavenly muffin.....makes me wonder about making them for profit! Yes...they are THAT good! (of coures I would change a few things, but this would certainly be a good starting place for such an endever!   SO good!

Amazing recipe!  Followed directions almost completely except that I substituted 1/2 cup of all purpose flour for whole wheat and used light sour cream.  Because my oven has a convention fan, I baked it for 18 min.  They are moist, flavorful and not too sweet.  Thanks for sharing!

Didn't happen to have any blueberries on hand, but added chopped cranberries instead with some orange zest.  Will buy some blueberries and make it again.  Great moist muffin.

1,000,000 stars!!  Absolutely perfect in every way! As an experiment, I filled one muffin tin without a single berry in it and sprinkled cinnamon on top, just to see if the batter would be versatile.  YUP!  I'll definitely be playin' around with other fruits and such, using this as my base.

Baked these muffins yesterday and they were marvelous!! Very moist!!! I agree the reviewers that said it taste bland if you don't adjust the recipe somewhat. I added more sugar (i used panela sugar, not white sugar), chia seeds (for a nutritional boost), cinnamon, and nutmeg. I also used creme fraiche instead of sour cream. With panela sugar, it made it less sweet than white sugar but it actually has some nutrition. I will definitely make this again!

I made this twice as a blueberry "cake" using a 9x13 pan. The sour cream really makes this exceptionally moist. Even my husband who is not a blueberry fan raved and requested I make it again.

These are soooooooo good! I'm Scandinavian and my grandmother used to use sour cream in just about everything! It makes everything much better I think. Some of my guests said that it had a strange taste, but they still loved them all the same. My family and I ate most of them up in only a few days. There was no self restraint used. lol I will not make these too often because they just don't last long in my house. Or I will make smaller batches and give some to the neighbors. ;)

I've made these twice already & my family just loves them.  They are moist & delicious!  I like to sprinkle some turbinado sugar on top before baking, just to add a little crunch.  I printed this recipe & stuck it in my recipe book because it's a keeper!!

I didn't have a muffin tin, so I made muffin tops instead. Turned out a little bland/dry, but the beauty of muffin tops is that you can put them in the toaster!

I absolutely loved this recipe... very easy.  I did what some of the others suggested increased the sugar - 1 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I also put in a tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 of nutmeg.  I just like those flavors with fruit.  I didn't have any sour cream on hand so i used 2 6 oz containers of blueberry yogurt.  Thank you KK3 for this recipe.

These were great when I made the changes another reviewer suggested.  I added 1/2 cup more of sugar and then split the total sugar 1/2 white and 1/2 brown.  I used 3 cups of blueberries and added 1 1/2tsp of cinnamon which made all the difference.  I also added a simple crumb topping ( 1/2c of sugar, 1/3c of flour, 1/4 cup of butter, and 1/2 tsp of cinnanom.  Crumble together)  These were amazing, the sour cream made them so yummy also.  A great addition to hte recipe

FABULOUS!!! I even cut the sugar down by 1/2 cup and used half wheat flour.  I did up berries to 3 cups though.  Ends up making about 3 dozen this way.  Freeze well too.  Great easy recipe the kiddos can help make and then eat!!!

I was really disappointed with this recipie... I figured it was simple so the end result might also be simple... but it was so bland.  These muffins are moist due to the sour cream, but that is the only good thing about them.  The only way I would make these again would be if I tweaked the recipie a ton. I would add some spice and some nuts and some brown sugar.  I would not recommend this recipie.

I read the reviews and used 1 1/4 white and 1 1/4 brown sugar, 3+ cups blueberries, and a struesel topping.  They came out perfect-just the right amount of sweet, and they rose nicely (filled cups just about to top).  I will definitely use this recipe again and again. :)

As others suggested: subbed apple sauce for oil, subbed 1/2 white whole wheat flour, increased blueberries to 3 cups.  Sprinkled Penzey's cinnamon sugar on top before baking.  Not bad; but not the best.  Best part were the blueberries because I had just picked them!

My husband loves his mothers blueberry muffins (she makes them in a box and adds her own blueberries) I like making everything i can homemade, so i thought i would give these a try (Ive tried making another blueberry muffin from this site and it didnt turn out that well) I figured i would try it again & use this recipe from all the great reviews. 
the only thing i changed was i added about 1/2 C more blueberries (all fresh). my husband said they were delicious & moist and to keep this recipe but he felt they werent sweet enough *i dont like blueberries so i didnt try them so i dont know if it's because he's used to the boxed kind and it was in his head or they really werent* However i gave a plate to my friend and her parents and they said they were delicious and just right...so i guess it's all in your taste buds. i think when i make them again ill try adding some honey? and trying the half sugar half brown sugar and seeing if that will satisfy his sweet tooth. 
 I did fill the cups pretty full and i got about 28 muffins out of this recipe. i would definitely try this one.
sorry one last thing: i did add the crumb topping from the TO DIE FOR BLUEBERRY MUFFINS on this site as recommended from another reviewer. make sure if you do this mix it JUST before sprinkling it on top. i made the mistake of doing this too early so it sat while i mixed & meas the ingr and filled the cups so by the time i got to the topping it became mushy & didnt "sprinkle" it came out more in a clump

I've been looking for a good recipe for years - these are it!  I took the advise of another reviewer and used butter instead of oil and replaced half the white sugar with brown sugar.  I also made crumbs from Bisquick & brown sugar.  Awesome!  Thanks for this great recipe.

This was a great recipe!! My partner and I wanted something a little sweet and this was perfect. I made it exactly as it said, but cut the ingredients down to only make 6 and it was perfect!

Really good recipe. I added a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon just to add flavor, oh and I only made 6 so that might have made a difference that I only put 1/4 tsp. Still great recipe :)

These muffins were pretty good but I would add more blueberries next time.  They were very moist and I like that it made 24 muffins instead of just 12.

I can't believe how yummy these things are! We did add 2 1/2 cups sugar half white and half brown sugar and added cinnamon but other than that left it the same. Will definately make again!

Yummiest muffins I have ever tasted. Simply awesome. I used 2/3rds wholemeal flour and 1/3rds white flour, added a pinch extra of the baking powder and about a couple of tbsp of milk to balance out the density of the wholemeal flour. Turns out absolutely perfect. Have already made several batches, will be making more with different berry combos!

This recipe looked amazing!! Only trouble is I was looking for a low sugar option and couldn't find one! I did some research and decided to use this as a guideline and went conversion crazy.
Instead of all purpose flour, I used whoe wheat and also subed out 1/2 cup of flour for oatmeal
I used honey istead of sugar, needing 1/2 tsp more baking soda to balance the acidity of the honey, apple sauce instead of oil, and greek yogurt vs. sour cream. 
I had a ton of fun experementing and hope you enjoy this healthier alternative.

Great recipe. I modified slightly. I removed 1 cup of sour cream (not needed, just throw in some extra fruit) and used a mixture of raspberries and blueberries. I also put some lemon zest in there. I substituted 1/2 cup of flour for a 1/2 cup of wheat germ. Wonderful flavor and texture!

These were fantastic!  I made some substitutions since I'm lactose intolerant and can never follow a recipe as is!  Vegan sour cream and a little almond milk.  I also used baking powder in place of baking soda and added 1/2 a cup of apple sauce in place of one egg.  I added some fresh lemon zest too.  Raw sugar in place of white sugar.  Next time I'll use some cinnamon. All the girls in my youth group ate up those muffins so quickly!

These muffins were great.  I quartered the recipe and used 1 container of greek yogurt in place of the sour cream because I had to use it up.  Very good!

Maybe I did something wrong?  This did not come out great at all.  I even provided the samples to a group of taste testers and the avg rating was 3.

The actual muffin part was missing a lot of flavor.  The only change to the recipe was that I added the coarse, large sugar crystals on top of the crown.  Everything else was as written.

Granted, the "overdone" issue was all on me.  I probably needed to dial it down about 25 degrees in the oven due to the dark, nonstick pan.  But that should affect flavor.

Needs a boost in sugar, salt, and perhaps butter in place of oil.  

Anyone else want to chime in on this one?

I like allrecipes.com, but I don't get the 4.5 star avg so far.

I was a little sad my husband bought Fat Free Sour Cream but it didn't make a difference! My family LOVED them! I sprinkled the tops with raw sugar right out of the oven and it was perfect.  3 Cups of blueberries, for sure.

These muffins are better than bakery-bought! I achieved perfectly round tops with this recipe. I only made a couple of modifications; I decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and increased the blueberries to 3 cups.

Excellent muffins - the sour cream makes them moist. I did substitute melted butter for the vegetable oil and used 3 cups of blueberries. I will definitely make these again.

I made these after reading the reviews about how excellent they were. I was a little disappointed. They were not as good as I expected them to be. Maybe I over mixed, they did look beautiful :) I would recommend trying this recipe.

Perfect balance of moist AND fluffy.  I used half portion of light sour cream and half lemon flavored greek yogurt.  It didn't rise as much as I expected so I'm glad that I filled mounded above the edge of the cup.

This was so good! My family loved it! They are addicting! I made a crumb topping like someone suggested and I would not make it without it. I didn't have muffin liner's so I just used the "Baker's Joy" spray and they came out perfect! Thanks for sharing!!

These muffins turned out great!  I was told that they even looked professional.  I did listen to the other reviews and added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the recipe.  I also used the brown sugar, butter, and flour topping that one of the reviewers provided.  Turned out very, very well! I'm very happy with the results and will be making more of these in the future.

These are great! I used half brown sugar half white sugar. I used unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil and used fat-free greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. I also had an extra half a cup of blueberries plus 2 tsp of cinnamon to the flour mixture. The batter is very thick and my muffin cups were filled to the top!

I followed the recipe exactly. It did make 24 muffins and they were light and airy. Everyone loved them. They are lightly sweet. I think next time I would add a little bit of brown sugar and cinnamon to the recipe.

Excellent!  We had lots of fresh blueberries so we gave this a try.  They were very moist and flavorful.  I made the following changes:  I used half white sugar and half brown sugar.  Instead of one cup of oil, I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil- next time I think I'll try using all applesauce.   My son doesn't like blueberries so I set some of the mixture aside and added chocolate chips instead.  They were loved by everyone!

These are the best blueberry muffins I have ever ate or made.  I made these for Mother's Day brunch and everyone loved them.  Followed the directions as written and wouldn't change a thing.  They are very moist & tender.

LOVE it, my husband said "Save that recipe".  We added 1 cup brown sugar, and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  We also sprinkled brown sugar on the top prior to baking for a cruchy top.  Thank you!

These muffins were amazing! I made a few small changes: added an extra cup of blueberries (fresh), added 1 cup brown sugar (since some reviews said they weren't sweet enough, and I would have agreed had I not added the cup of brown sugar), and I used only 1/2 cup oil and substituted 1/2 cup applesuace.  It yielded exactly what it said it would yield and these baked up perfectly in 20 minutes! The batter seemed thick & heavy but they turned out light & moist and have gotten tons of compliments.  I will make these again & again.

I love this recipe. Most of the time, I make lemon blueberry muffins by only using 3/4 cup oil and 1 cup of sour cream but adding 1/2 cup lemon curd, the juice and zest from 1 lemon and then topping them with a lemon sugar sprinkle. Yummo!

Moist & yummy! I did not have any blueberries on hand so I used frozen strawberries instead. I followed the advice of the most helpful reviews and doubled the sugar, using half brown and half white. I added 1&1/2tsp cinnamon, which if I hadn't, I would have found these muffins boring and bland. These were perfectly done at the 20 minute mark and I did not follow the special mixing instructions. I ended up with somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 muffins, so I'd recommend halving the recipe unless you have enough hungry mouths around. I used the topping from the "To Die for Blueberry Muffin" recipe, which was only ok. Next time I will use a crushed almond & brown sugar recipe I found on EatingWell.com. The key is in the brown sugar. White sugar complimented the tartness in strawberries, but blueberries would need something with more flavor. This is an easy recipe to alter if you want to make it healthier, subbing yogurt for sour cream, mashed banana or coconut oil for vegetable oil, using all brown sugar, adding oats, flax seed, etc. I'd also be generous with the fruit - using 3 cups at the bare minimum.

Love these! I made them for a party and everyone raved. I prefer them to the "To Die For Blueberry Muffins" recipe, which is good too, but these have the edge IMO. I make them with thick, full-fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream because that's what I usually have my fridge. Works perfectly. Also, I bake them at 375 degrees (for a few minutes longer, obviously) because the one time I baked them at 200 they started burning on the edges and I had to turn the oven down.

these were GREAT! only gave 4 stars because i did make a few changes based on suggestions from other reviews. i used 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar, added cinnamon and mixed the eggs and sour cream together first. DELISH!!!!!! will try these again with different fruits and with the crumble topping. a definite keeper!

I made these this morning and changed a few things just based on other reviewers comments. I substituted some vanilla yougurt for sour cream, some applesauce for oil ( about 1/2 and 1/2) used 1/2 whole wheat white flour and 1/2 regular and they came out very good. For half of the batter I used blueberries and for the other I used chocolate chips to make 2 kids happy. Would definitely make again.

Ohh My!! Blueberry Scrumptiousness!!  You definitely want to add a streusel (crushed walnuts, sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, butter) to this recipe, as it adds a little crunchiness to balance moist texture.  Also, adding subtle notes of lemon zest and a pinch more of salt to the batter launches this recipe into the stratosphere of culinary heaven. Enjoy this with a cup of free-trade French Roast and Holy shizzzy.....Yum Yum.

I followed some healthier tips by replacing half the flour with whole wheat flour and the oil with applesauce.  I've seen these suggestions many times and thought I'd give it a try.  I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar and I increased the blueberries to three cups.  I had to increase the bake time to 24 minutes as well.  The muffins turned out great and did not taste healthy at all!  The muffins have a perfect balance of sweetness to the slight tartness of the blueberries.  I think the sour cream was the secrete to a deliciously moist muffin.  This is the perfect muffin - I will make over and over again!

This is an awesome recipe.  I've been making this recipe for years only using half the ingredients.  I came up with this recipe by changing an old recipe to fit our needs and whala!  My recipe was printed in a Gooseberry Patch Cookbook too.  So if you want a good one to fall back on, this is it.  I've also tried it using raspberries and peaches. It still comes out very well.  I like to make a streusel topping sometimes too.  It just makes it more special.

Great flavor and easy recipe!  The only thing I will do differently next time is to bake at 350 - 400 was a little too hot, I think, and the edges were a little more brown than I like.

Super Easy and they taste great, very moist. I made them just like the recipe states and wouldn't change anything.

The best!  I've tried many blueberry muffin recipes and this is my favorite.  The muffins are light yet rich in flavor.

These are fantastic! Very presentable and very YUMMY! This is gonna be my stand by blueberry muffin recipe! I also did half white sugar half brown sugar and increased the blueberries to 3c. I over stuffed the muffin tin so I needed an extra 5 min in the oven.

Fantastic!  I’ve never considered myself good at baking but these turned out fabulous!  I did have to cook about 10 minutes longer then called for.  Made the recipe as written and I was able to make 12 muffins and a large loaf.  I don’t think I’ll ever try another Blueberry Muffin recipe.

Delicious! I read through the reviews and decided to make a few tiny tweaks - I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup granulated sugar, and then 1/2 cup plain unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup canola oil (instead of using all oil). Unfortunately blueberries aren't in season, so I used frozen tiny wild blueberries. Before adding the blueberries to the mixture, I tossed them in a teaspoon or so of AP flour, which keeps them from sticking together and bleeding into the dough. Right before I put the muffins in the oven, I sprinkled a tiny bit of turbinado sugar on the tops of the muffins, just for a bit of crunch.  Next time I'm going to try using 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup canola oil, just to lower the fat a bit more; I may also try white whole wheat flour instead of AP flour. I was thinking of using low fat sour cream, but I think that would alter the flavor too much - and these are DELICIOUS just as they are!

I make a variety of muffins for my family on a pretty regular basis.  These looked delicious in the picture, but turned out to be fairly bland in comparison to other blueberry muffins on allrecipes. The only change I made was to use Greek yogurt (Fage) rather than sour cream.

This is the recipe that I use most because it always comes out perfectly.  The muffins are bakery quality, texture is great, they puff up pretty, and the taste is delicious.  Everybody loves them.  What more could you ask for!!  I do add extra berries and use a scoop to make the preparation fast and easy.  The two dozen amount is convenient because I have some to share or put in the freezer so we can pop them in the microwave for a fast breakfast.

My entire family loves these muffins, including my mother-in-law who usually isn't fond of blueberries. I use half white sugar and half brown, mix the sour cream in with the rest of the wet ingredients until smooth, and add a bit of lemon juice to brighten the flavor and cut down on the sweetness. They always rise beautifully while baking!

They turned out great.  Consistency, look, etc.  I baked them at 350 instead of 400 and they were perfect.  However, I would probably alter the recipe a little if I made them again because I would have liked it better if they were more sweet.

I've made these three times, and with slight variation, they've been great each time. The best was when I added 1 cup frozen blueberries, & 1 cup frozen raspberries. I also added the streusel topping. I alternated adding the sour cream and dry ingredients and followed the sugar and oil addition instructions, & it does seem to make the texture  better. Also, I've cut the recipe in half each time,  using 1 1/4 cup sugar, 3/4 cup oil. Also, when I ran low on sour cream, I used plain yogurt with the sour cream, & I tried peach yogurt. Plain was best.

These muffins are "Over The Moon" good.  They are the second best I have ever had.  My very favorite are the ones from Cosco.  These are very close.  I made them with half brown and half white sugar and a little cinnamon also about 1/2 cup extra blueberries. Otherwise every thing was the same.  I can highly recommend this recipe!

Made exactly as described and they were fluffy, moist and ridiculously delicious. As a side note, I used light sour cream and I'm sure that cut the fat and calories, but definitely not the taste!

just gorgeous!  these turned out great, and rose nice and high - they look and taste like bakery muffins!  the only thing i'd change next time is to sprinkle some white sugar on top or maybe add more sugar to the muffins themselves.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I've been having to make them every week! I had to cut back the amount of sour cream to about 1 1/2 cups (hubby insisted that he could taste it) and I add 3/4 cup brown sugar. And I've been using 2 full pints of blueberries. My 1 year old LOVES them so I make it all into mini muffins. Will make this again and again... and again!

I cut the recipe in half but kept the same amount of berries, using a mix of blueberries and raspberries. Also followed another's suggestion of using half brown sugar with the white (so 1/2 cup each in the halved recipe) 12 muffins were moist and bursting with berry-deliciousness.

Outstanding muffins! I followed the recipe exactly though I did add more blueberries, and I used frozen ones, for convenience, but I think I will use fresh next time. These gems got rave reviews from everyone who tried them. Thanks for sharing!

Not overly sweet, which is why I liked these muffins. I had a little batter left over and made some mini sized, adding some small pieces of strawberries that needed to be eaten. Surprisingly a nice tang was added to an already lovely flavour. Great with a hot cup of tea any time of day. Thank's KK3.

Very tasty and pretty. Fill the cups to overflowing (not only 2/3 full like you would for most muffins). Be careful not to over mix or they will be chewy.

I cut this recipe in half and still got 15 beautiful regular sized muffins. Granted, the berries were huge, still 15? My house smells like a first class bakery shop and the aroma woke my husband . He has had 2 and is contemplating # 3.  They are delicious and the sour cream addition was right on! Thank you!!

This was pretty good, but not knock your socks off must make them again good. My son and I liked the recipe, but did not love it. He said the muffins were a bit heavy (I did not over mix it, I folded dry ingredients in very carefully). I might add that after making these, I found the exact same recipe on 2 other sites, but those recipes included 1 1/4 tsp. baking powder. I wonder if that would make a difference? We used the streusal topping as suggested by others, which helped with sweetness, because these muffins were not as sweet as they could have been. We also used the recommended third cup of blueberries. I can't imagine using less. As a matter of fact, I could have thrown in even more berries. That being said, these are not bad. But we want to try other recipes to see if we find one we like better.

These were ok. I used 1/2 brown sugar half white. Next time I will add more sugar maybe 3.4 cup. I felt these were not sweet enough. Ok for breakfast. Also When I make again will add cream cheese center like I do with my other muffins. I added 1 1/2 teas. cinn. and a 1/2 teas. nutmeg. With make again with more modifications

Excellent! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added an additional 1/2 cup of sugar and used 3 cups of frozen blueberries--very good. A keeper!

This is absolutely the best blueberry muffin recipe I have tried.  I now bake this recipe at least two times a week.  I cut the recipe in half but make a few alterations.  I use frozen blueberries and just pour them right from the pkg. until I think there is enough (approx. 2 cups) and bake them in a mini loaf pan for 30 minutes in a 375 oven and have eight beautiful breakfast loaves that my family absolutely loves!
N.B.: you can easily substitute vanilla yogurt for the sour cream if you like - both ways taste great!
I add 1 tsp baking powder for better baking results -- higher tops on the muffins.

I've made alot of blueberry muffin recipes but this is probably the best and the easiest - try sprinkling a little mix of cinnamon and sugar on top before baking - that's good, too! Also, I got 15 jumbo size muffins out of this recipe and baked for about 25 minutes...   :)

Ratings should be for the recipe as is.  I followed it exactly.  These have a very nice texture, but lack flavor.  More blueberries and a crumb topping are needed to make this 5-star in my opinion.

This just took over as the #1 muffin.  I did make a few changes based on reviews.  I put in 1 cup of brown sugar and 1-1/4 cups white sugar, 1-1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and increased the blueberries to 3 cups.  They are the ultimate muffin!!

Terrific muffin.  I doubled the blueberries and it worked out great.  Also, I halved the recipe and got 21 big muffins!  Great consistency, looked beautiful, and were a huge hit.  Thanks!

I have tried a couple of different blueberry muffin recipes but this is BY FAR the BEST!!!  I made these and took them to breakfast and they were a huge hit!  I followed the recipe exactly as written for the muffin part.  The only difference was that I made a streusel topping of brown sugar, butter and cinnamon.  They were wonderful.  I highly recommend this recipe!  They will be a hit!

Excellent muffin! Along with the 2 cups of white sugar called for, I added 1/2 cup brown sugar to give them a tad more flavor. They came out tasting great, but my first batch looked a little...naked. I used the streusel topping from 'To Die For Blueberry Muffins' from this site and topped these muffins with that before baking. Perfection, but also really amazing without the topping. Thanks! :D

These were good, but not outstanding.  My husband loved them so I gave them 4 stars instead of 3.  I will probably try on of the many other blueberry muffin recipes on allrecipes next time.

Best blueberry muffin recipe I've ever used. Very moist, and, as I added the extra sugar suggested by others, nice and sweet, in contrast to the slightly tart blueberries. Yum! Thanks for sharing!

Oh so yummy!! I halved the recipe because I had only 1 c. sour cream. Didn't have enough oil either so I did half oil and half applesauce. Baked 20 minutes. The batter made 12 mini muffins and 6 large ones. Pour water in the muffin tins you don't fill up that way they don't smoke during baking. The mini muffins probably could have come out at 15 minutes. The outsides of them was a bit too done but they taste awesome. These are so great I'd go to the store just for more sour cream and oil to make them again if we hadn't just got 6 inches of snow! Thanks for this recipe.

I loved it and found it easy to make. I brought it to work and wasnt a piece left to take home which made me happy. I actually made it in a pan instead of muffins and i put a streusel topping it. I will definitely be adding this one to my recipe box.

Very good muffins, although not quite sweet enough for my tastes.  I will make them again, but next time will add extra sugar, as others have suggested.  Have a nice texture though, reminding me of the Tim Horton's chocolate chip muffin - not too dense, maybe a little more like a cupcake.

Amazing.  Everyone raved!  I added an extra 1/2 c of blueberries and that was everyones favorite part.  I might try adding extra sugar next time.  These look like they come from a bakery.  I was proud to display them in my kitchen

Turned out GREAT!  I was running out of sour cream so I had to sub with a third  cup of milk.  Also, I didn't have blueberries, I used saskatoons.  Some of the other reviews I read said that they weren't sweet enough, which is why I made them since I don't have a big sweet tooth.I have lots of saskatoons left in the freezer and I will be making these again!

I made these this morning. They are VERY bland. I don't see how these have such great reviews because I did not care for them at all.

I used low fat sour cream b/c it was all I had.  And i halved the recipe to make 12 muffins.  It made about 14 actually, and I filled the muffin cups to the top! Delish!

I made these for a bridal shower brunch and everyone loved them. My husband said they were the best blueberry muffins ever. He was eating the batter(that is just what he does) and he kept saying it was so delicious. Definitely a keeper!!

I was so looking forward to making these muffins.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were absolutely beautiful coming out of the oven.  But they tasted bland, bland, bland.  I was so disappointed.  Finally, desperation took over and I poked holes in the top and poured Kahlua inside, then, I can't believe it either, I iced them with chocolate frosting.  Yes, a muffin with frosting.  But, they finally had flavor!

These muffins are delicious! In an attempt to make them a bit healthier, I used half all purpose and half wheat flour, I subbed half the oil with unsweetened applesauce, decreased the sugar and used light sour cream.  This is the BEST blueberry muffin recipe!

These are wonderful.  I halved the recipe and the only change I made was that I added an extra cup of blueberries.  These muffins also keep well and are wonderful the next several days heated up in the microwave.  Will definitely put this one in my recipe book!

I got great reviews from very taste conscience critics. I cut the recipe in half as I didn't need quite so many. I used butter because I didn't have oil for some reason.(I would try these again using oil) I also added a strudle topping.

This recipe was amazing.  I have been trying to find a recipe that I could freeze and then just thaw out in the mornings for my daughter.  All the other recipes that I made were VERY dry once thawed.  This one is wonderful!  Just as moist as the day they were made.  They taste so good too!

Good but I feel like there is something missing.  I increased the sugar and blueberries but it still needs something...not sure what.  Nice and moist, easy to make, makes a lot.  I would actually give this 3.5 stars if I could.

5 stars (although i made modifications as suggested by other reviewers):  -1/2C oil + 1/2C applesauce instead of a full cup of oil  -1 1/4 C white sugar, 1 1/4C brown sugar instead of 2C white sugar  -1Tbsp vanilla instead of 1tsp  -3C blueberries instead of 2C  -added 1.5tsp cinnamon   -added some nutmeg  -added 1.5 tsp baking powder  -made a streusel topping to go on top (used the topping from to-die-for blueberry muffins on this site)  the result was a perfectly MOIST muffin bursting with blueberry flavor! i usually don't like store-bought muffins because they are too heavy (oily) and too sweet and contain too few blueberries, but if you make these modifications, you'll get perfect the perfect blueberry muffin!  I will never use another recipe again!

I made these today for my mom's day breakfast.  I used the other reviews and did the half and half white sugar and brown sugar.  The muffins were good except for the fact 400 degrees is way too high for an electric oven.  All the bottoms of my muffins burnt!  I had them on the middle rack. I would try 375 next time and let them cook a little longer.

Awesome recipe!  I have tried making blueberry muffins many times before and had a recipe that I liked quite a bit, but this one is really great as well.  I made quite a few alterations such as using half whole wheat flour, half all purpose, 1/4 c brown sugar and 3/4 cup splenda, applesauce instead of oil, and I only had plain fat free yogurt on hand so I used that in place of the sour cream.  I also threw in a mashed banana to add a bit of flavor and moisture being that I was using whole wheat flour.  I made 6 jumbo muffins and baked at 375 for about 25-30 minutes or so, I can't say for sure because I was just kind of eyeballing them and adding a few minutes here and there.  I gave it four stars because I did alter the recipe a lot, but it was a great base and I only altered to make a little healthier/lower cal.

I had to make them without vanilla extract because I didn't have any but they turned out delicious!!  I also used frozen blueberries.  It made a total of 26 large muffins.  Cooking time was perfect!  You could actually substitute the blueberries for strawberries or any other berry and they would turn out great!  I can't wait to try them with the vanilla extract and fresh berries next time!

Very happy with this recipe....only adjustments I made were adding 2 tsp baking powder to the dry ingredients (why? because i have seen this recipe listed elsewhere calling for the baking powder, so i figured it wouldnt hurt to throw it in), I used 3-4 cups blueberries (frozen by myself) and topped muffins generously with turbinado sugar before baking.  yielded 33 muffins and they were deliecious. I will use this muffin recipe again.

The flavor was good, and they were definitively moist, but I found the texture coarser than I like in a muffin. Maybe if I beat it longer next time?

These blueberry muffins are absolutely delicious. Depending on the frozen blueberries I use, sometimes I have to add more sugar to the recipe. Fresh blueberries tend to be sweeter than the frozen. I use at least 3 cups of blueberries in the recipe, because my hubby and his co-workers think it is MUCH better than way. I do add the sour cream to the eggs, sugar, and oil mixture while blending, as mentioned in another review. I also add extra sugar, extra vanilla, and cinnamon to the batter. Once again, as mentioned, I do use about 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar in the batter instead of all white sugar. I also make the crumb topping with half brown sugar and half white sugar, butter and flour, and cinnamon. Brown sugar gives flavor to a topping, but white sugar gives it that slight crunch that makes toppings extra yummy!  I have tried several blueberry muffin recipes, including the one with higher ratings, and this is my hubby's favorite.   Thank you for an amazing recipe!

I thought this was Ok. Granted, it's my first home made attempt. I used the two cups of blueberries and added a cup of chopped pineapples. I think there should still be more blueberries/fruit added. I also added the cinnamon that another reviewer recommended but it could have used more.

I cut this in half and it still made a ton! I did half full-sized and half mini-sized.

I used butter in place of the vegetable oil, did half sour cream/half yogurt and used this season's blackberries in place of the blueberries. (I wanted to use what I had on hand.)

These turned out really fluffy and tasted amazing. The whole family enjoyed them. I made scrambled eggs that had been cooked in bacon grease and fresh squeezed orange juice to go with. 

I'd make these again for sure.

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!  I've gone through many many difference muffin recipes looking for the "perfect" one because others seem to turn out too dry.  These were fantastic & a definitely staple for me.  I dipped the tops in a lemon glaze (just fresh lemon juice & powdered sugar) and served them at a baby shower bruch and they were the rave!

I don't even like blueberry muffins as they are so dry. However, as I had a bunch of blueberries, decided to make some. Well...these are delicious & I will certainly make them again very soon as I only made half the amount. Thank you for this great muffin recipe.

These muffins were pretty good. They were not as moist as I would have liked, but they tasted good. I halved the recipe to make 12 muffins, I used frozen wild blueberries and added a little cinnamon. I also used applesauce instead of the oil - maybe the reason they were not as moist.

I made several different blueberry muffin recipes and these were our favorite, hands down!  I threw some wild raspberries in with the blueberries, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  They are so delicious.  Will make these again and again.

I made these at the hall and they were a hit!!! I stuck to the recipe but added a topping of 1/3 cup brown sugar,1 tbsp flour,1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tbsp butter. Spread mixture over muffins in tins, it added some crunch :)

I decided to make this recipe for my Grandma because she loves blueberries so much. The only alteration I made to the recipe was to increase the amount of blueberries because I found a container of huge, beautiful berries at my local grocery store and I wanted to use them all up. I cook a lot but rarely do any baking, so I was a bit surpised that these muffins came out delicious and pretty on my first try. I'm not really a fan of blueberry muffins, but I ended up eating three of them before packing up the rest. Grandma really loved these muffins as well. Thanks for a great recipe!

I think these muffins are fantastic.  My kids gave them 4 stars, but since I write the review, I get to give them 5!  I put a streusel on them, and we all think it was not a good idea.  I think they'd stand on their own, without any topping.  We're going to have to fight over the last 2 in the kitchen.  I can't wait until blueberry season, when I can use fresh picked!

These are really good.  I made these as is and also substituted half of the sugar for brown sugar, and 3/4 of the flour for King Arthur's white whole wheat flour.  Yum!

Very tastey!  The didn't stick to the wrappers at all, which is normally the problem I have with muffin recipes. I had to use cream cheese because I didn't have sour cream. These were very good and not at all dry,  I think it can be be a great base recipe. I can't wait to try them with peaces, and maybe chocolate chips.

Fantastic.  The muffins are rich and delicious.  I have made the recipe with the sour cream as instructed and have made the recipe substituting nonfat plain yogurt for the sour cream.  The yogurt muffins are not as rich as the sour cream muffins, but still great.  I always have used 25% less sugar than instructed.

These muffins are great - soft and sweet! The only things I did different to the recipe instructions when I made these were substituting sour cream for cream with lemon juice added (didn't have sour cream), used half light brown sugar and half white sugar, and I added about ½ a teaspoon of cinnamon. I tend to overmix things so they did end up a little flat. Maybe a bit too much batter for regular size muffin tins though, next time I'll make more, smaller ones. :)

Again ... as said below ... these muffins were ok .... but I am disappointed. I'm not sure where the "cream" comes in the title, other than in the ingredient because they're not "creamy" at all. They tasted processed ... not homemade. I wouldn't spend the money again to make these.

Good, but not "the best."  They seemed very heavy.  They reminded me of a processed muffin, kinda wet and greasy.

The first time I made these I definitely underbaked them because I was afraid of overcooking them.  The second time they were perfect.
My only comment would be that they're a little sweet and taste more like cupcakes than muffins.  I would reduce the sugar next time.

I made them with vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream because we were out.  They are delicious.  I would recommend using a mixer if you're not up for a bit of lower arm exercise.  It took quite a bit of hand beating, but was well worth it.

I halved the recipe & since sour cream is not available I used Blueberry flavoured sour cream (175 ml) plus 2 TB melted butter. I love how it turned out. It's very light muffin & not bland at all. I will definitely keep this recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe.  I, like another review, had blueberries but no milk.  I don't think I'll ever make another blueberry muffin recipe.  They were so moist and yummy.  I did add extra vanilla and blueberries.  YUMMY!

Love it. I use a Splenda/sugar mix to reduce the sugar content a bit. Also, I added a bit of cinnamon.
These are nice and moist, and actually get more moist the longer they set.

Overall these muffins tasted good but they looked a little pale and underbaked even though they were fully cooked through. Not bad but not a great blueberry muffin. Maybe adding some brown sugar in place of some of the white sugar might help.

I was very surprised by these muffins after reading all the great reviews. I have been baking for years, and these were...only so/so. I wouldn't go out of my way to make them again. They lacked spice (in my opinion)so I added some. I'm glad I did, otherwise they'd have been rather bland. Also, previous reviewers said that the addition of oil and sour cream seems like a lot of added fat for very little added flavor or texture. I was actually surprised they didn't seem more rich considering all of the added fat. I felt that the muffins came out rather small, which often happens when you overstir the batter. With this recipe, over stirring is hard not to do because the batter is so very dense. Also, I found some of the directions to be rather unclear. I think those people who used wild blueberries (the smaller, sweeter variety) probably had much better and more flavorful results. I personally only had cultivated berries on hand, so that could account for some of the lack of flavor. Finally, these muffins were actually kind of...doughy or wet on the top and were almost impossible to brown. Overall, not something I'd make again.

I made these for the first time using frozen blueberries.  They were fantastic!  I thawed the berries and rinsed them in a colander, draining as much as possible.  I used lowfat sour cream and followed the directions as written.  They have a great texture and flavor.  Thanks!

These are good muffins, but I am not sure the addition of the extra fat from the sour cream is worth it.  I didn't find them anything spectacular and didn't justify the fat content.  I halved the recipe and still easily got 12 muffins.  I had trouble getting my muffins to brown on top and had to leave them in for an extra five minutes.  I didn't make any laterations but will take other reviewers suggestions of using yogurt and apple sauce in the future to help cut the fat.  The muffins were moist and I didn't have the heavy issue other reviewers complained of.

This is my favorite Blueberry muffin recipe. I found it years ago here on Allrecipes. The crumb is very tender, moist and delicate. It also rises beautifully, even at a mile high! The only thing I do is add some lemon juice and zest. I like the tang of lemon to bring out the sweetness of the blueberries and add some "complexity".  I usually double the recipe so I'd say doubled I'd use juice and zest of one lemon or so. (Meyer lemon is great if you can get it). I may add a streusel topping next time to make it more appealing to my son who needs to see evidence of the sugar for himself.

I halved the recipe and used frozen blueberries.  Very delicious, not too sweet and the tops were nice and crunchy.  Though next time I'll rinse the berries first, because my muffins turned blue!

Tasty, but I think I'll stick to my original blueberry muffin recipe. Sour cream is great in baking, but it can neutralize other flavors, and in this case seems to take some of the tartness away from the blueberries.  However, this recipe does make beautiful, wonderfully textured muffins, so it's definitely worth a try!

good muffins, although i added some lemon juice/zest.  (I think it is always a complement to blueberries and necessary for depth of flavor).  beautiful looking - a big hit!

These muffins were awesome...thank you Kim, and everyone else for all of your reviews! :)
A few changes I made after reading all the reviews...
1 cup white sugar or Splenda and 1 cup light brown sugar, 3/4 cup margarine melted and cooled, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, zest from 1 lemon.
It made 12 jumbo muffins that baked 35 minutes at 400. :)

I made a lot of changes to this recipe and that is probably why they weren't the best I've ever had. I used egg beaters instead of eggs, canola oil instead of vegetable, 2c. wheat flour and 2c. unbleached and reduced fat sour cream. Next time I will add more vanilla and try some of the other suggestions like the lemon yogurt and brown sugar.

Overall, this recipe was very simple and tasty.  It is not too sweet or heavy - some muffins have a tendency to be more like a dessert.  I added a little over a half tsp. of cinnamon and nutmeg to the flour mixture to give the muffin some more spice.  Lastly, I made a strusel for the top - with a table spoon each of cinnamon, sugar and flour blended with tablespoon of hard butter and sprinkled on top of each muffin before baking.  My family liked the muffins a lot and I think for such an easy recipe, this is too good to pass up!

Very easy to make! Not too sweet, but next time, I'd add more vanilla or try adding cinnamon or nutmeg for more flavor. Great with mixed berries!

I have made many Bluberry Muffins, but this recipe is THE BEST!  SO moist and tasty, I made it exactly as written, just took the liberty of sprinkling with cinnamon & sugar on top before baking.  May add a little lemon Zest next time, to give it a "tang".

I love this recipe!  I followed the recipe with a couple of minor changes.  I added about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg and about 1/4 cup additional sugar...they were fabulous!  Very moist the next day and my co-workers loved them with their morning coffee.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  I'll experiment with other fruits next time.

This recipe was great! Be sure to not overmix. I think extra blueberries would make it even better. I made 12 muffins and put the rest in a 8X10" pan then put the crumb topping on that, it turned out great! Next time I will put crumb topping on the muffins as well. Thank you for a great recipe!

These muffins were wonderful!  They made a lot, so I might make a half batch next time.  I followed the recipe exactly and added the topping from To Die for Blueberry Muffins of this site.  They were phenomenal, especially when still warm from the oven.

These are the first muffins I have made from scratch that are as good as the muffins you get out of a box.  I added the zest of two lemons as I had just bought a microplane and wanted to try it out.  I got 12 muffins and two small loaves of bread from this recipe.

They are wonderfully moist... but taste like they're missing something.  I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white; next time I'll also add a bit of maple syrup.  I increased the vanilla extract to 1 T and doubled the berries.  I'll definitely follow other posters' suggestions and include some cinnamon or nutmeg when I try this again.  It took about 28 minutes to bake, so I covered the tops with aluminum foil for the last 8 minutes to prevent over-browning.

Absolutely *the best* muffins we have ever tasted!  I thought I'd never get rid of 24 muffins, but they were so good they disappeared in just days.  Soft, moist and deliciously tangy.  They have a wonderfully smooth texture. Added an additional 1/2 tsp of baking soda to help them rise.  We made them again and split the batch substituting a cup of mini chocolate chips for the berries (LOL, for the kids) in half and lemon juice/zest and poppy seeds in the other half.  They turned out beautifully, the recipe is very forgiving.  I think we'll try orange-cranberry next, this is our new favorite muffin recipe!

DELICIOUS!! These muffins were some of the best tasting muffins I have ever eaten. I halfed the recipe and made 6 jumbo size muffins.I didn't use the muffin liners (I don't like using them). They looked and tasted like I brought them from a upscaled gourment bakery. They are so easy to make, too!! I used one whole pint of blueberries and they were bursting with blueberries! I noticed that some said that their were oily. Mines weren't. They were the right consistency all around. I hope to be making these for a long time. Thanks for sharing, Kim!

These muffins are delicious. They are very similar to the blueberry muffins I make frequently. However,there are some differences. Instead of using oil, I use the same amout of room temperature margarine creamed with the sugar. Add the eggs, sour cream and instead of vanilla, I use and prefer 2 tsp. of almond extract. Add dry ingredients(4 cups flour, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda 1/2 tsp salt.) Fold in 4 cups of blueberries.Bake at 375 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes. both recipes are taste addictive.

Oh my!  I have been following a Betty Crocker muffin recipe for years.. it was always just okay!  Now this, on the other hand, is wonderful!  I followed it exactly- and I do believe too that the sour cream is what makes the difference!  I will be making these a lot!  Thanks so much, Kim, for posting this!

I added 2 cups vanilla pudding instead of the sour cream and made mini muffins instead.  I broke the dough into four parts, added orange rind and 1/3 c. mango, apples and cinnamon w/ a crumbly brown sugar top, bananas and walnuts, and chocolate chips.  They all came out awesome and I ended up with well over 100 minimuffins.  Very easy and delicious.

I thought these were great.  I read the reviews and based on a lot of them, I sprinkled some sugar on the tops of the muffins before baking, to add some sweetness.  They turned out extremely light and moist, so I'm confused by the reviewers who complained that they were dense.  Next time I decide to make muffins, this is the recipe I'll be turning to.

I needed a muffin recipe to use up some of the apples I just picked at a local orchard and so I gave this a try.  Instead of the blueberries, I used a cup of chopped apples and a cup of dehydrated cranberries.  Wonderful!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Perfect.  Light, sweet, and great looking.  I halved the recipe and put ALL of the batter in 12 greased metal cups.  I was weary because I wondered if the batter would rise and fall over the sides.  I was pleased to see the muffins rose straight up and did not spill over.  I will use this recipe from now on.

Best 'from scratch' recipe for blueberry muffins I've tried.  I did substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream, because I had it on-hand.  They turned out great!

My husband and I both had the same reaction to these -1- they melt in your mouth, wonderful texture -2- they were good, but not excellent.  Something is missing in regards to flavor.  Maybe crisco or butter instead of oil?

A good basic muffin recipe that is a little bit different from the usual 'cupcake' like recipe.  They freeze very well.

These reminded me of your average bakery muffin. I think I'll stick to my old recipe that's really an oatmeal muffin with a touch of cinnamon along with the berries.

I made these muffins with fresh blueberries from the farmers' market and took them to work. Everyone seemed to like them...the muffins were very moist. I added an extra 1/2 cup of blueberries as well. Thanks for the recipe!

These muffins were pretty good.  This was a heavy muffin and not too sweet, I imagined pioneer women making something like it.  They were very moist, and without that, I don't think these muffins would have made it.  They have a very pound cake-like feel in the chewing and swallowing.

The best blueberry muffins! I cut the recipe in half and used a partially drained can of wild Maine blueberries(in water)and they came out even moister and more delicious than the "To Die For" blueberry muffins listed on this site! You could use this recipe as a base for all kinds of yummy muffins and quickbreads.

Best muffin recipe! I’ve tried many, and I definitely like this one the best. The texture is amazing, and they only get better, becoming even more tender and moist after a day or two.

 I like the other highly rated blueberry muffin recipe on AllRecipes, the one with streusel topping, but I prefer this recipe for the actual muffin, so sometimes combine the two if I’m making extra special muffins!

This recipe works well with mini chocolate chips instead of blueberries in case someone in your family doesn't like them. I made a smaller batch 1/2 ingredients, medium size 12 muffins), a few with blueberries and the rest with chocolate chips, baked in 375F for around 25 min.

Excellent, They dome nicely at 400 degrees. I did 75 percent cup granulated sugar and 25 percent brown and used butter and olive oil rather than vegetable oil.

I liked this recipe a lot. The only reason why I rated 4 stars was because it did not specify how much batter should go into each cup. It just says to scoop it in. So my muffins overflowed and were ugly, but still tasted good!

Mine turned out tasty, but tough. (I also added a bit of grated orange peel, yum). Next time I will go with my gut (and what I learned in Junior High Home Ec), ignore the mixing instructions in the recipe and just make a hole in the dry, add the wet and DON’T OVER MIX.

These muffins needed more flavor.  They are moist, but sponge like.  I will keep searching for an awesome blueberry muffin recipe.

I made exactly as written but added an additional cup of blueberries ( I like a lot). Also dusted them in flour before adding them to the mix so they don’t sink to the bottom. The office loved them!

Wonderful recipe, thank you!  My husband and I agree with the other reviewers who have called these bakery-quality muffins.  I used 1.5c blueberries in 1/2 recipe and topped it with course sugar as recommended in the magazine. 1/2 recipe makes 14 muffins.  Oh, I also followed the magazine's recommendation to use liners and to use a mixer for steps that say "mix", rather than mixing with a spoon.

I was disappointed with this recipe. I relied on the 5 star rating and I made them before I read the reviews.  Most of them altered the recipe. They were okay but I've made better.

I didn’t have enough sour cream so I used a cup of vanilla yogurt and I used half the sugar. These muffins turned out great. It’s now on my favourites list.

Our blueberry bushes are very heavy producers and I make muffins, pies, breads, etc all the time.  This recipe (halved) was in the recent issue of Allrecipes magazine and I made them today and they are outstanding. They are even better than Aunt Blanche's muffins from this site which I have made at least a dozen times.   I did exactly as the recipe indicated and it's imperative to do the alternate sour cream and flour and don't use the mixer for this step!  Never have I used turbinado sugar on top before but it really makes these muffins stand out over others!   Oh, and I used more blueberries because I have zillions of them which resulted in about 4 more muffins. Next time I might add a little lemon zest to the batter.  Anyway, I need to run to the store and get more sour cream so I can make a bunch more and freeze them!

My favourite blueberry muffin recipe. It can easily be halved. The sour cream ensures a very moist muffin. I've also reduced the sugar by a quarter.

2 cups of sugar seems like a lot, but mine turned out super tart. Maybe it was my blueberries? I even added a crumb topping and they were still too tart. Will try this recipe again, making some adjustments.

I made these delicious muffins this morning. I added walnuts and used frozen (thawed and drained) wild blueberries. I worried a little that my Light Sour cream might affect the final result but it didn't.
Definitely a "keeper"recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly except that I added a little more blueberries and subbed 1 cup of  plain full fat yogurt for a cup of the sour cream (out of necessity not choice, that's all  I had) These were ok. I expected them to be more tender and a bit sweeter. There is a possibility that I over mixed.  I made these in a stand mixture and used the lowest  setting to incorporate the dry ingredients  and the sour cream.  I think I should have mixed by hand.  Also, I topped with structural and it was delicious.

Like others, I used about 3 cups of blueberries. I cut the sugar in half and only used 1 cup. It increased the volume and changed the bake time. I really like them! I was thinking of sprinkling some sugar on top of the batter before baking. Maybe I'll try that later. Delicious.

Delicious!! After reading the reviews, I did reduce the sugar by about 1/4 cup, and used both white and brown sugar. (my blueberries were pretty sweet). Reduced the oil by 1/2. I even used reduced fat sour cream. Topped with a sprinkling of brown sugar before baking.  
I only made half the recipe and it made 12 - 2" x 1 1/4" muffins. Had some batter left over and had enough to make 12 mini muffins. I'll be making these again!!
Thanks for sharing, KK3.

These turned out really good even though I only had a 1 & 1/2 cups of sour cream to use. Mine turned out kind of green so not sure what I can do to change that but it obviously didn't affect the taste.

I debated between giving these 4 or 5 stars. I love how easy these muffins are, and I've made them twice.  I use a regular ice cream scoop, heaping, and it fills the muffin tin right to the top to bake up nice size muffins.  My small critique is that these muffins are not sweet. They don't have a big flavor punch.  Lots of reviewers have enhanced these with a topping or by adding more sugar and cinnamon to the batter.  I sprinkled demerara sugar to the tops for a nice crunch.  I enjoy them early in the morning so don't need them to be sugar bombs, but I may try adding 1/2 cup more sugar to the batter at some point as some have recommended.
TIPS: 
Make sure you stop using the mixer at the end and fold in the blueberries manually with a spatula or else they will turn the batter blue and the muffins will bake up dark looking.  Ask me how I know.  
I have used half a cup of apple sauce and half a cup of oil to replace the full cup of oil and didn't notice any difference in texture or flavor.
I've used both fresh and frozen blueberries, more than called for, about 3 cups.  I actually prefer a 12 oz bag of frozen blueberries to fresh because they're cheaper and also because when they're in the freezer I can have them on hand for whenever I feel like baking and not worry about them spoiling.  I just throw them right in frozen.

These muffins are very good!!  I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups but also added 1 container (5.3 oz) of greek lemon yogurt as replacement for part of the sour cream.  I also added 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.   Delicious!!

The very best muffins!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used 3 cups of (wild) fresh blueberries, increased the sugar by 1 cup and split the sugar 50/50 between white and brown.  Not wanting to increase the calories any more, I did not add a topping — but it is not needed.  Rich, moist muffins :).   This recipe, with modifications, made 31 muffins.

Giving this four stars only because I made two changes, one of them unintentional.   I halved the recipe but forgot to halve the sour cream.  I  thought I needed two cups, but I only had one cup of sour cream, so I added a cup of Greek yogurt.  I also used more blueberries than called for because I am a blueberry .  Half a recipe made six jumbo muffins.  Bake longer if you use a jumbo muffin tin -- 25 minutes did the trick in my case.  These came out super moist and I will most certainly make them again.

These are very good muffins.  I cut the sugar a bit, I use 1 cup white sugar and a packed 1/2 cup of brown sugar for a deeper flavor.  I also use white whole wheat flour (same amount) and plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream to make it a little healthier.  Do yourself a favor and add 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice to the flour mixture.  It makes it taste so much better!

Awesome muffins! My 10 year old granddaughter and I followed the recipe, added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla more and a 1/2 cup more blueberries.  Very tasty, moist and tender muffins for our breakfast! Thanks for your recipe!

As someone else said, these should be called "Blandberry Muffins."  I can't believe all the positive ratings for these.  A lot of people who gave them such high ratings are tweaking the recipe or adding a streusel topping...maybe that's why.  They were beautiful and moist but BLAND.  Tasted like they had no salt in them, and they definitely need tweaking.  Glad I made only half the recipe.  My search for the perfect blueberry muffin continues.

These are the best blueberry muffins.  It is now my go to recipe. I followed the recipe, well almost, I did not have a full cup of sour cream so I used buttermilk to make up the small difference, and I sprinkled the tops with  Morena pure cane sugar before baking.  The muffins were good the next day.  I used regular muffin tins and made 24 muffins.

They turned out great. I halved the recipe and substituted 1 cup of white sugar for 1/2 c white and 1/2 c brown. I also changed the fruit from blueberries to raspberries and added the juice and zest from 1/2 a lemon.

I used 3 cups of frozen blueberries instead of 2 cups of blueberries. I actually would have put 4 cups of blueberries. I don’t always like using regular muffin pan so I used mini muffin pan, and I made over 100 muffins. I also sprinkled some sugar over top of the muffins before and after they go in the oven. The last thing I did was put 1 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of buttermilk. They kind of tasted like cornbread but they were still great and I would make this again and again.????

I made these following the ingredients except I used only 3/4 cup each of white and brown sugar and increased the vanilla to 2 teaspoons.  More blueberries makes them even more delicious. They turned out just as directed except I filled the muffin cups almost to the top and they came out with odd-shaped tops.  Don't know why.  Next time I will fill them only a little more than half and should come out with 24+ muffins.  Very moist and tasty

I love these muffins. I cut the recipe in half and got about 9 good size muffins. I held back a little dough without blueberries, chopped up a snickers bar and put it on top of a few muffins. That was good too. I leave 2 muffins out on the counter and freeze the rest in ziploc sandwich baggies. They keep fresh frozen.

Normally when we make "sweets", we cut back on the sugar on almost all recipes. This recipe, if I would make again,  needs more sugar for sure.

I cut the recipe in half (didn't have enough sour cream to make the full batch) and muffins came out perfectly delicious. I had to bake 5 minutes longer because I used frozen blueberries. Definitely saving this recipe.

It tastes yummy.  We made only half the crumb mixture and that was enough. I added some pecans to my crumb and left the rest of the muffins with just regular crumb mixture.

I did make some changes because I wanted to use some frozen blueberries that have been frozen way too long. I love the texture of the batter.  I scaled it down to make only six. I substituted plain green nonfat yogurt... definitely made it a little less sweet but that is fine with me. Very moist muffin.

I made these per the recipe, but mixed all the wet ingredients together, then added the dry ingredients. They were very good- the best homemade blueberry muffins I have tried. I do think they need double the berries, so I will try that next time. I may try some of the other suggestions other reviewers have made, too, like adding cinnamon, using half brown sugar, and adding a streusel topping.

Pretty easy. Baked up large and fluffy but didn't ooze all over.  Filled the cups to the brim and the muffins are tasty.  Kids were loving it.  Used the 1tsp of cinnamon and 1/2tsp nutmeg as well as the suggestion to use 1 1/4 cup white and 1 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Followed instructions as directed.  It required 5 extra minutes of baking for me, but rain is on the way, so maybe the humidity affected it.

Really good, I used an extra cup of blueberries, and half a cup extra sugar, I also split the sugar 1/2 brown, 1/2 white, the cooking time was a bit too long, I did  15 minutes instead of 20.

I subbed 1/2 applesauce for 1/2 oil, used whole wheat pastry flour, added cinnamon and a streusel topping.  These are OUT OF THIS WORLD MUFFINS!  So moist, so tender, so delicious.  I'll never try a different recipe again.  Thank you very much!

I followed this recipe to a T. They looked beautiful, were very moist and I believe this is because of the mixing technique and addition of sour cream, however, I found that for my preference these needed more sugar as they were slightly bland. If I do make again, which I probably will I will add more sugar.

Very good.  I used whole wheat flour for half of the flour and cut the amount of sugar in half.  The next time I will try yogurt rather than sour cream.

This is the best blueberry muffin recipe I have found, and I have tried a lot. I found it about a month ago, and have made it at least weekly since, during this blueberry season. I have used butter in place of the oil, creaming the butter and sugar, then adding the eggs, vanilla,  *and* the sour cream, finally folding in the flour, etc., then the blueberries. I add a topping of a small amount of sugar and cinnamon. I have used raspberries in place of blueberries, and for that I add an additional 2 tablespoons of sugar to the mixture. I live at 5300 feet, made no high altitude adjustments, baked for 20 minutes, and they have come out perfectly every time. My very choosy son has declared these to be "Great!" Thanks for such a delicious and easy and fail-proof recipe!

The muffin is excellent, but the recipe is huge, so recommend to make only half of the recipe! Also bake at 380 instead of 400 degrees. If you have a cake baking setting on your oven use that.

Everyone  raved about these. I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and cut the oil down to 1/3 cup and used 2/3 cup applesauce for the remainder. Next I need to try with stevia for half to 3/4 of the sugar

Always a hit. I make a batch and wrap each muffin individually in Saran Wrap after they are cooled. Stick them in a freezer bag and store in the freezer. I can take out as many as I need the night before to thaw on the countertop. Next morning, perfect muffins. ( sometimes I microwave them for 15-20 seconds for a warm just out of the oven treat.) if you are using cupcake liners and freeze the muffins, make sure you use the aluminum foil liner and not paper.  Paper wicks the liquid from the muffin and it could be a bit of a mess.

Absolutely delicious!!! I made it with homemade yogurt, used blueberries and blackberries, and sprinkled pure cane sugar on top. They were soft, fluffy and cooked up beautifully.  This is my favorite muffin recipe.

This has become my ‘go to’ muffin recipe.  I don’t make any changes.  Whenever I take it for coffee hour at church I’m asked for the recipe.  Makes a great batch, I freeze half to make sure they are fresh tasting if hubby and I aren’t expecting guests.

I made this without subbing brown sugar or increasing the sugar. All I did was change the vanilla extract to lemon extract to make these lemon blueberry muffins. Also I mixed the sour cream into the rest of the wet ingredients. These are amazing.

Good!  Made a half batch.  Used half white sugar and half brown.  Increased vanilla to 1 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg.  Stirred sour cream directly into other wet ingredients.  Next time will use 3/4 white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar; and reduce cinnamon to 1/4 tsp.  Also used half butter and half applesauce for the oil.  Sprinkled 1/4 tsp.sparkling sugar on r\each muffin prior to baking.  Used these modifications based on others reviews.  Although good, they detracted a bit from the classical blueberry muffin taste.

I will use this recipe always

These are awesome! I used frozen berries (just over 2 cups, in order to use the whole bag). I did add 1/4 - 1/2 cup more sugar, just because I thought the berries weren't the sweetest. Added a little cinnamon in the batter and turbinado sugar on top for a yummy crunch. This actually made 36 nice sized muffins!  I'll be sending most of these to my son's school for his birthday, but can't wait to make another batch and try freezing them.

I have made these twice now and combined the whole wheat recipe with this one.  I used white whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/3 cup of oil instead of the full cup of oil.  I also substituted homemade keifer instead of the sour cream and cut the sugar by 1/2 cup.  I added the teaspoon of cinnamon recommended by other reviewers.  Came out great and will make again!

This recipe was perfect! I used fat free sour cream and added 11/2 teaspoons of cinnamon. It took them exactly 20 minutes to bake, and they were delicious!

I have made these a ton of times. They always come out delicious! I make a couple alterations - plain yogurt (usually Greek) instead of sour cream, I add cinnamon, I top with Jan's Crumb Topping  (found on this sight). They are amazing! If you manage to keep yourself from eating them all they freeze very well! I reheat by placing frozen muffins in a 300 degree oven for 12-15 minutes. When reheated this way they taste as fresh as the day they were made.

Very tender and moist. They were a hit with everyone. I added the streusel topping as suggested by another baker, but it is not necessary.

These blueberry muffins turned out awesome. I mostly followed the recipe with a couple changes. The recipe calls for 2 cups of sour cream, I used 1 cup sour cream & 1 cup plain Greek yogurt. I also added an extra cup of blueberries, for a total of 3 cups. Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

I have made several muffin recipes in search of the perfect blueberry muffin and this is definitely the best recipe out there. These muffins have an unbelievably smooth texture and taste wonderful. It is important to alternate mixing in the flour and sour cream to get the right texture.  I attempted a few shortcuts but the muffins were definitely not as good. It's so nice to have a recipe where zero modifications are needed.

It was a very light, tasty muffin.  I think some lemon zest and/or a light glaze would make this amazing.

Two of my grands spent the night last night and begged for muffins. I found this recipe and decided to give them a try. They are light and fluffy. The next time I make these I think I'll add a few more blueberries. But the 9 yr old muffin connoisseur ate 6 pieces of bacon and 3 big muffins!

Really moist and the receipe makes nearly 3 dozen. I substituted full-fat greek yogurt for the sour cream, used an extra cup of blueberries, use 1 C white sugar and 1 C brown sugar, and added 1 tsp of cinnamon. Delicious! Will def save and make again.

These are very good.  I've never put sour cream in muffins before, but it seems to keep them moister.  First off, I cut this recipe in half since there are only 2 of us in the household that are eating these.  I always try to make muffins healthier for me and my son, so I did use half AP and half whole wheat flour, subbed applesauce for the oil and cut the sugar back to 10 Tbsp.  To me they were still plenty sweet.  We made them as mini muffins, so we could just pop a few in the morning for breakfast or whenever we want a snack.  I will definitely make again.

I halved the recipe, but kept vanilla at 1 tsp.  The muffins were great and looked bakery quality.  I did use all white whole wheat flour and 1 1/4 cup blueberries.  Because of the wheat flour, the texture was not cakey, which I liked.  Definitely will make again!

I used applesauce instead of oil and replaced 1/2 the sour cream with vanilla yogurt because I didn't have enough oil or sour cream. I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Super moist and yummy.

My only change was greek yogurt for the sour cream. Made them just as written otherwise.  Do NOT add more sugar as so many suggest. These are very sweet as is. And stay moist, a real plus for a muffin. The recipe made 40 standard size muffins. Wonderful recipe.

Perfect muffins , as directed. It made 30 muffins and a loaf. (I was out of muffin pans so I had to use the loaf pan! ) i used an electric mixer so the eggs and sugar would whip up fluffy. These were a hit for my whole family.
1/19 these are still a hit . Mini-loaf baked at 325 for 45 min.
10/10/19 they baked up perfectly in stoneware muffin cups. I did not use muffin papers. Yield 24.

I quartered this recipe because we were only 2 people, and I got 8 muffins.  I subbed whole wheat pastry flour for the white flour, and added 1/4 tsp. Baking powder along with the baking soda called for.   I made half the batch with chocolate chips, and half with frozen blueberries,  I did have to bake them a little longer than 20 minutes.   It made a light, tender and moist muffin.  A bit on the sweet side, but absolutely delicious.

These were so nice. Like any quick bread, don't overmix and they won't be tough. I make this recipe with frozen raspberries and sour cream and my co-workers request them at least once a month.

This is an excellent recipe with room for minor personal modifications.  As per other reviewers, I replaced the oil with homemade applesauce, 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 2 cups of white flour, roughly 3 cups of fresh blueberries, and 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract.  A sprinkling of lemon sugar (a homemade mixture of white sugar and lemon extract) on the muffin tops before baking added a little crunch to the fresh muffins.  Alternating the addition of the flour mixture and the sour cream was necessary for the light texture, together with gently and minimally folding in the blueberries.  Some reviewers indicated their muffins were too heavy -- I wondered if any had used a mixer, which would contribute to the density as all the air bubbles  are lost.  Hand mix only as much as needed to incorporate the flour, no more!

Great recipe! Muffins were moist and caky. I made half of the recipe and got 12 good-sized muffins. I also didn't have enough sour cream, so I used a flavored greek yogurt and it worked fine. I used half regular flour and half whole wheat flour. If you want a more exotic taste, you could probably add some cinnamon, maybe some nuts like pistachio, and maybe some lemon zest. All in all a great base recipe for any kind of muffin you'd like to try.

Fabulous recipe!! My only alteration is I reduced the sugar by a 1/3 and used fair trade cane sugar. My family does not like food that is too sweet. These are very delicious and we are keeping this one for future use.

These are amazing muffins. Great flavor and not overly sweet. I tossed the blueberries in some flour before adding them to the batter so they wouldn't all sink to the bottom.

These are the best muffins I have ever tasted.  The texture is perfect  IMHO.  I do, however, have one small quibble about the instructions that I am only pointing out to help others.  One of the reasons we love muffins is because they are so easy to make.  I didn't stream or gradually do anything.  Beat the eggs with a whisk.  Beat in the sugar & sour cream.  Then the oil & vanilla.  Mix in the salt & baking soda & then the flour.  Fold in berries.  Done.  I intend to use this recipe as a base for all muffins from now on.  Thank you so much.

Very easy to make. It was a great recipe for my little helps because one kid was response for the dry and one for the wet ingredients! So fun to make. The muffins them self came out very most and tasted good but I felt like it was missing the wow factor. But very good for a nice, easy, quick recipe!

I subbed 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 of the oil, and subbed fresh raspberries for blueberries.  I did everything else the same.  It  made 24 regular muffins and 36 mini muffins.  I thought the texture was good on the small muffin, but somewhat mushy on the regular sized, which could have been from the applesauce.  My family loved it, and I thought it was pretty good.

The only change that I made was that I used frozen blueberries that were tossed in flour before adding to the batter.  I've made them both at times with fresh and frozen and no one was able to tell the difference.

I made these muffins but substituted 6oz.blueberry yogurt for some of the sour cream, muffins came out very good and not as tart with just sour cream just the right amount of sweetness and altered the recipe for 12 instead of 24. It's a keeper wife and Grand Daughter loved them.

Another excellent muffin recipe!  I have several muffin recipes that call for sour cream and I never use sour cream.  Yuk!  I use Greek yogurt instead, sweet or plain.  On these, I didn't change anything else except to put a streusel topping on top (and used frozen locally grown berries).

Love this recipe, however I didn't want muffins"
I cut the recipe in half, used Greek Yogurt instead of sour cream and baked in a bread pan sprayed with non stick spray and dusted with cinnamon sugar.
I baked at 350 for 60 mins, or until tester came out clean.
Moist, delicious quick bread.

My daughter has never made homemade blueberry muffins and this was her first time.  The family and neighbors LOVED THEM!!  We took the advise of others and added an extra cup of sugar, split the sugar up between regular sugar and brown sugar and added cinnamon.  We also cut 1/2 cup of sour cream out of the recipe and added an extra 1/2 of fresh blueberries.    The result gave us warm, oh so moist, so many blueberries and flavorful blueberry muffins!

I used fat free plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  They were fabulous, and 26 calories less per muffin than the original recipe.   They took about 2 more minutes to bake.  This is my new standard blueberry muffin recipe.

This was just okay for me.  The only changes I made were using half brown and half white sugar as opposed to all white and I didn't have vegetable oil so I used canola oil.  I didn't have a regular size muffin pan, just a jumbo one so I ended up with 12 huge muffins.

I also followed the recommendations of using the crumb topping which I'm glad I did because that actually helped add flavor. If I were to make these again I would try the all white sugar and maybe add another teaspoon of vanilla or something because something was definitely missing; my daughter agreed.

I only changed a few things as suggested by others, a few shakes of cinnamon and substituted brown sugar for half of the white sugar.  They are delicious!! Not a sickening sweet muffin which is what I was looking for.  I have tried many blueberry muffin recipes, but this is the best.

These "blue" my mind! Seriously! I did take the advice of other reviewers and used 1 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1 1/4 cup of brown sugar, added cinnamon, 3 cups of blueberries, and a streusel topping. Holy Moly! Stop the presses! These are like bona fide bakery muffins. I feel like Betty Crocker after making these blueboys!

Made these for my daughter's 2nd birthday and used a cream cheese frosting-- yummm. They were sweet enough to be like cupcakes. We used frozen berries to cut cost and they were still delicious. Like others I combined sour cream with egg mixture all together before adding flour mixture. Moist and came out of the muffin papers just fine (without any spray or additional oil).

These are SO good.  Followed the recipe except added a wee bit of cinnamon to the flour and added a topping of butter,  half white sugar, half  brown sugar and  cinnamon topping.  These rose really high!  I used frozen, not thawed, blueberries and it worked just fine.  This is the third muffin I have tried with 5 star ratings, but my hubby said this one is the winner!

Followed the recipe exactly (except for adding extra blueberries). I thought they were pretty good the day I made them but...the next day they were much better! So good! I recommend making these the day before you really need them. Very smooth texture, simple & delicious!

I read the reviews and followed by sprinkled the top with streusel from to-die-for blueberry muffin recipe before baked and used half brown sugar & half white sugar.  I only had frozen blueberry so I put them in mixture while still frozen. They came out great and moist. Just melt in your mouth! Thank you very much!!!!

Texture is great - very moist and fluffy. And it looks pretty.

I used Greek yoghurt instead of sour cream. And also coated the blueberries in some flour first to prevent them from sinking all the way down into the batter.

I found it was a little less sweet than I had liked, which was odd considering I used the full amount of sugar PLUS Greek yoghurt with honey. Maybe just a few more tbsps of sugar and a little more vanilla extract would be nice. And I would probably try what other reviewers said (mix of brown + white sugar, maybe some cinnamon) to give it a more enhanced flavour.

Overall this is a nice recipe, and I may use it as a base to vary the toppings to make other types of muffins (apple & cranberry? Banana & walnut?).

Amazing!!! These are the best blueberry muffins I've ever made! This will be my go-to recipe and I think I would switch out the fruit used with little trouble. 
I used probably double the vanilla (I didn't measure) and half sour cream/half 4% plain Greek yogurt (only because I didn't have enough sour cream).

I followed this recipe to the T and it's good. I agree it's a little bland. Next time I will try suggestions of other reviewers and try a streusel topping or even maybe a cream cheese topping. Over all good but not the best blueberry muffin.

Was good.  But not very sweet.  A friend suggested maybe dredging the blueberries in sugar next time, & adding a little (tsp or 2) lemon juice  to the mix.

Good muffins!  I halved the recipe, keeping the full amount of vanilla, and got 15 regular sized muffins.  Sprinkled coarse sugar on top before baking.  Nice flavor, not too sweet and great texture. Will make these again.

This is a really good basic cream muffin recipe to play with.  I've made it with the recommended blueberries, but I add some lemon extract instead of vanilla.  I've also made it with tart cherries and added almond extract PLUS the vanilla.  My reusable silicone muffin cups are a little small, so a 1/2 recipe will make 12 and leave enough batter for two small quick bread loaves to save for breakfast the next day.  Only 4 stars, because on its own it is a little bland.  Hence, playing with it.  I also like mixing a bit of a spice that matches the other flavors with some turbinado sugar and sprinkling over the tops before baking (cinnamon, ginger, and/or allspice, etc.)

Will definitely make more of these, love how  great they taste.  Hint fill the cups just under the top, about 1/8" down and it will make more than 24 of them.
Could replace the blueberries with any other fresh fruit, my next batch will be strawberry's, blackberries or raspberry's.

Great recipe! This was my first time attempting to make blueberry muffins & it was perfect! I followed the recipe exactly for the most part. I added a crumble on top before baking (which I got from someone who wrote in the comments section). I used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 6 tbsp butter, 2 tsp cinnamon, & 1 cup of flour. Just pinch everything together with your fingers until it has a crumble-like consistency, use it to top your muffins, & pop them in the oven!! They were delicious!!

Delicious. The only modifications I made were adding 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, as some of the other reviewers suggested, and a half cup more blueberries than the recipe called for (wish I hadn't). Next time I will add an extra half cup of sugar and stick with 2 cups of blueberries. I will definitely make these again.

Love these! Because I am feeding them to my 8-month-old for breakfast, I actually decreased the sugar to 1 cup and they still taste amazing! Threw them in a ziploc and tossed them in the freezer....going to enjoy them for as long as we want!

Excellent, as the sour cream gives so much moisture! The recipe seemed to me to be a lot of sugar. I altered quite a bit though, and it still came out excellent: used only 1 c sugar, substituted coconut oil for oil, and used Greek yoghurt instead of sour cream. I substituted one cup of oats for a cup of flour also. I added a very ripe banana and a leftover baked apple, adding that with the yoghurt while alternating with dry ingredients. Spectacular!

Perfect! I did this recipe as written and made no changes. Beginners and advanced bakers should easily be able to do this with no problems. The muffins  turned out moist and flavorful:) I will be doing this recipe again. It's amazing! This recipe could be used for other berries also.

I haven't rated any recipes on here for about three years but these were too amazing to pass on the goodness. I ran out of sour cream so I used plain yogurt for the second cup and I added a basic streusel to the top. I also used 2 1/2 cups frozen blueberries. Dynamite!! The muffins were so tender and rich. Thanks for the recipe. I will repeat.

Made a gluten free version by substituting gluten free all purpose baking mix and 1 Tbsp xanthan gum.  I also substituted 3/4 of the sugar with splenda so the recipe was only 1 tsp added sugar per muffin.  They were absolutely amazing.  My husband has recently had to go gluten free and it is recipes like this (that can be altered) that is making it possible for him to succeed.

THESE ARE AMAZING. Do not change any of the ingredient proportions! It is sweet enough, moist enough, tender enough, and bakes up to a beautiful gentle dome that is slightly crunchy even without sprinkling sugar on top! Substitutions that you can make are to replace the sour cream with light sour cream, or replace a third or half of the flour with wholemeal flour, as I did. If you want more flavour, you can add a teaspoon or so of cinnamon, nutmeg, or do what I did - a couple of dashes of lemon essence! As other reviewers have noted, they could be baked for 3-5 minutes longer than stated. Otherwise, they are perfect. Absolutely perfect. They are delicious and SO MUCH BETTER than the "to die for blueberry muffins" recipe also on this website. 10/10 will make again. I'm so glad I finally found a bakery-quality blueberry muffin recipe.

These are amazing. I have made them twice everyone loves them! Last batch I made 1/2 with blueberries and the other 1/2 with chocolate chips... fantastic. Cooking time is around 25 minutes. I used the 2 and a 1/2 cups of sugar (1/2 brown and 1/2 white). I also used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup apples sauce.

Very yummy muffins and the kids love them.  Reminded me of pound cake with blueberries.  Quick to make using organic ingredients, for a healthy and filling breakfast.  May never buy a box muffin mix again.  They are that good and easy!!  Freeze nicely too!

This recipe is excellent, halves very nicely for a smaller family breakfast.  Trick- Spray the paper liners with a quick burst of non-stick spray and it not only helps the muffin come out clean from the paper but also seems to help with a bit of browning on the sides and bottom.

FOLLOW THE TIPS FROM OTHERS - texture and methods are good, but this a reletively bland muffin recipe so upping the sugar and mixing with brown sugar and cinamon would take them to another level. I am a regular muffin maker. By the way, the uncooked batter is a bit thicker than most muffin recipes , but it turns out fine.

This recipe was shared with me with my Mom who is a fabulous cook. HINT - I did not have enough blueberries so substituted strawberries cut to about the size of blueberries.  WOW!  Tastes like strawberries and cream in a muffing. This was so yummy but be sure to not over fill your muffin cups as the top of mine did not cook all the way the first time I made them.

These were really good, my son and I had a hard time stopping from eating them all -- made 28 regular size muffins.  I added 3 cups/containers of fresh blueberries and had to add 5 minutes to the cooking time.  I also added the sour cream before adding the flour mixture.

Absolutely yummy! I used hand mixer to whipped the egg, sugar and butter to create a fluffy batter. Since I love blueberries, I add 1 cup of blueberries instead of 1/2 cup. I sprinkled cane sugar ( you can use regular sugar or mix brown and white sugar) to create crunchy top.

These are in the oven now, I used half white and half brown sugar also put all the wet ingredients in with the egg mixture. I did a 3/4 cup oatmeal and 1/4 cup flour 6 tbsp cold butter 2 tsp cinnamon for the topping. I also used the juice of half a lemon and the lemon zest from the whole lemon-we love blueberry lemon can't wait to try one! Still too hot but looks amazing-OMG so yummy!

Excellent recipe! Traded the sour cream for Balkan style yogurt, which is a little tart, similar to sour cream.  Also split the sugar between light brown and white sugar (1 cup of each).  All else remained the same.  This will be my go to recipe for muffins!  Plan to try with other frozen fruit!

My niece says it is the best muffin she has ever had. Great consistency and taste.

 I used mostly brown sugar (because that is what I had), half white and half wheat flour, half sour cream and half vanilla yogurt. The yogurt added some sweet. I think I would reduce the sugar by 1/4 to 1/2 cup with the yogurt and leave it same without. Plenty sweet for breakfast without increasing the sugar.

Because I had to substitute out of necessity, I would still give this recipe five stars.  I only had about a half cup of sour cream (so I added vanilla honey Greek yogurt for the rest) and I opted for the applesauce substitution for the oil.  Oh my goodness!  They are like cake!  So delicious!  Thank your for sharing this breakfast/dessert/anytime recipe!!

Great recipe. I didn't have enough blueberries so I just half'd the recipe and it turned out wonderful.  Next time I make it though, I'll make sure I have enough blueberries because these muffins will be gone in no time.

Wonderful! Add the streusel topping (1/4 c butter/1/3 cup flour/ 1/2 cup B sugar 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon).  I also cut the oil with applesauce. Only used 1 cup sour cream and added 1 scoop of my cinnamon bun protein powder, 1/2 tsp almond extract, and 2 tsp cinnamon. THESE ARE SO GOOD!!! I upped the blueberries to 3 cups and LOVE the consistency. Light but stable muffins that are packed with blueberries! They are good w/ or w/o the topping. I use a stand mixer to blend eggs, sugar (slowly add it), oil, applesauce, vanilla, almond extract, and then turned it off and added the dry ingredients by hand to just before they are combined and add the blueberries (I use frozen) and the mixing in of blueberries is just enough to get the mix to come together. This is my new muffin mix base!!! Wonderful!

I adjusted the recipe.  As I made it once and the sour cream was way too strong. 

Its good like this:  2cups brown sugar 3/4 cup white sugar.  1/2 cup sour cream. 1lb of blueberries.  No crumb topping since the muffin base is sweet it doesnt need it

Yummy! I cut the recipe in half because only 3 of us. I only have about 3/4 cup of sour cream left ( didn't want to go to the store just for that), it still turn out great!??I also sprinkle raw sugar, about 1/2 teaspoon on top of each muffin before baking.

Really good!  I use real butter instead of oil.  It whips up nice and fluffy and makes 30 muffins instead of 24.

Very light and fluffy.  I substituted regular sour cream for fat free only because that's what I had on hand and it still came out great! I usually bake with cake flour to get the products to feel less dense but this recipe doesn't need that at all. The all purpose flour works just fine.

Perfect!  Follow the mixing directions and you can't go wrong.  I did up the amount of blueberries to 1 1/2 cups for half a batch.  (3 cups for a whole batch) Don't overwork the batter as you are adding the flour and sour cream and you will have beautiful tender muffins.  These are so easy to put together.  Thanks!

This is the first time I've found a recipe that the blueberries don't all sink to the bottom! The only changes I made, were reducing the recipe to half for 12 muffins,and I did add an extra half cup of blueberries. While I won't say it's the best blueberry muffin I've ever had, it was definitely very good, and for the simple fact of blueberries not sinking, it will probably be my go to recipe for muffins with berries. Family ate them up. :) Thanks for the unsinkable recipe!

This recipe is awesome!!Very moist n delish! Loved it, I followed advice of other reviews, add the half sugar n half brown sugar, added more cinnamon n some nutmeg, Since I 'm a vegan (I adjusted some things to make vegan friendly) I used cane sugar n vegan brown sugar, vegan cream cheese, flax seeds for egg replacement I used 1/3 c 4 times n 4 tsp of ground flax seeds, instead of oil I melted 1 cup of vegan butter, I mixed flax egg, sugars, butter n vanilla all together, alternated wet n dry ingredients, I also did use 3 cups blueberries per reviews, Came out delish!! Thanks for sharing!

Delicious & moist! I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 3 cups blueberries, substituted apple sauce for the oil, increased sugar by 1/4 cup, and added 1 teaspoon cinnamon. I was out of vanilla extract so I used almond extract instead, which gave a nice, rich flavor. Filling a standard 12 count muffin tin very FULL each time, I easily got 36 muffins from this recipe.Will definitely be making these again!

They are okay. They did turn out very moist and fluffy, but there is something missing from this recipe. The flavor is very flat. I'm going try adding some nutmeg or cinnamon to the next batch I make (second batch is currently baking). I'd recommend a different recipe :(

Delicious muffins - great recipe!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and they turned out perfect - all except for the 2nd pan because I forgot it in the oven.  That's right - a whole batch of muffins ruined!  Savoring the tray that I remembered to take out in time and contemplating when my next batch will be!  Looking forward to trying this batter recipe with other fruits as well - my kids have requested strawberry muffins next time!

These rose beautifully and looked great, but tasted very bland.  I made them exactly as written, no changes.  They tasted eggy and not very sweet.  I don't know if they need salt or what, but they are definitely lacking something.  I wanted to love these...oh well.

This is very good. I used plain yogurt instead of the sour cream and increased vanilla to 1 1/2 tsp.. I made a topping of 2 tbsp. butter, 1/4 c. Each.....flour, sugar, & oatmeal, 2 tsp. cinnamon. My husband definitely will be wanting these again. Thanks for sharing it!

Moist, flavorful, delicious! They took about five minutes longer, for me, to cook all the way through, but then they were perfect. Next time, I'll add a crumb topping. Wonderful!!!

I modified this a little to be healthier by replacing the dry portion (flour etc) with Hodgson Mills Buckwheat pancake mix. I wish I had more berries to add as I do think the other reviewers were right- more berries would add to the juiciness of this! They were a little lacking so I made a simple sugar glaze on top and that made them better. I would do more berries next time!

I discovered that I only had about 1/4 cup of Sour Cream, so I was forced to substitute.  I was making a half recipe, and in order to come up with 1 cup, I added Bavarian Yogurt (full fat) and low-fat buttermilk to the small amount of sour cream that I had.  I have not made this recipe as written, so I can't compare the original to the yogurt/buttermilk version, but the muffins rose well and were tasty.  So if you need to substitute, the yogurt will work.  I also added an extra 1/2 cup of blueberries on the advice of other reviewers.

This recipe is amazing with a few tweaks. I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and used half brown sugar, half white sugar for the sugar content. I added an extra 1/2 cup of white sugar as the recipe is fairly bland as is. I would also add an extra cup of blueberries to give more sweetness. I topped it off with a cinnamon crumble topping, using a modified recipe another reviewer recommended: 3/4 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 6 tbsp cold butter (cut into pieces), 1/2 tsp cinnamon; pinch ingredients together until a crumble forms.  A tablespoon of this topping on each muffin before baking really made these muffins irresistible!

Just made these - added almost 1/4 c sugar & used 1/2 brown sugar in recipe but still tastes like it could be a bit sweeter (and I'm not normally an overly sweet person).   Also added 1 tsp cinnamon & extra cup blueberries per other reviews.  Don't get me wrong - these are moist & very tasty but think they may need a bit more sweet, just a bit.

Love this recipe, I made this in loaf pans instead, I used 4 smaller ones and baked it at 350 for 56 minutes. I doubled the vanilla as well. I will definitely make this again!

Finally!! A muffin recipe that doesn't make me regret spending the time to make homemade muffins!  These muffins are divine.  When I was making the batter, it looked very dense and I was worried about the end product, but when I opened my oven after 20 minutes, I was delighted to find light, tall muffins. They are better than bakery muffins.  I halved the recipe for 12 muffins and added a pinch of nutmeg to the batter.  Next time, I might add a streusel topping but the recipe is excellent as it stands.

I wanted muffins this morning and I checked my freezer and found blueberries.  I tried this recipe and cut it in half--very easily.  I substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream, and 1/4 of the flour was wheat flour.  I thought they were very tasty and light (comparing them to the donut shop and grocery store) and quick to make.  I did not think they needed more sugar.  I may try reducing the oil and substituting with applesauce down the road.  But very good indeed.

Lovely!  I only added 1 tsp of baking powder because there were some reviews referring to the muffin being dense so I didn't want to risk it, with that cautious tsp of baking powder, I found them to be light and delicious.

Nice texture. I added 1/2 c more sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of ginger, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg since some reviewers complained that the taste was flat. Also added 3 cups of blueberries because they looked sparse. This made 36 regular muffins.

Easy recipe and great taste.  I used 1c white sugar and 1c brown as others suggested.  Used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  The veggie oil I substituted with 1/2c extra virgin olive oil and 1/2c apple sauce.  Used 3 1/2c flour and 1/2c flax meal.  Upped the vanilla to 1tbsp as suggested and added 1 1/2tsp as suggested.  Added 1/2c chopped walnuts and 1/2c chopped pecans.

Nice muffin recipe and easy to customize if you don't have all the ingredients; yogurt for sour cream (I used vanilla yogurt which made them much sweeter, I don't like it but the family does, I think plain yogurt would have been a better substition), part whole wheat for all purpose flour, part brown sugar for white.  I had blueberries, but in the summer we have blackberries and I bet these would be even better with blackberries.  I think the other reviewers idea of sprinkling these with streusal is nice, I was low on butter, so I sprinkled them with lemon sugar for crunch sweet top.  The cooking time was a little different, my muffins were done in 22 minutes (in a tin without liners so that the muffins get that tiny bit of golden crispiness on the bottoms) and they puffed up and over the muffin tin prettily.

Excellent. I made one change. Instead of the sour cream I used Greek yogurt. I find myself subbing that anytime a recipe calls for sour cream nowadays! They were still nice and moist.

I made these muffins this morning for Bible Study at church. Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe. Before I made these I looked at the reviews. I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar. I only had 3/4 cup of vegetable oil so I used that amount. I added cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves to the dry ingredients as well as the topping. I used 2 cups  of regular sour cream.  I was wondering whether the brown sugar was packed and saw a review saying loose so I'm glad I read more than a few comments. I put in 3 cups of frozen blueberries.  Also on someone's suggestion I used 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and a full tablespoon of vanilla.  I used the crumb topping. I filled one pan just right and the second a little too much.  No problem except one pan baked in 20 minutes and the other took 30 minutes.  Instead of 24 I probably should have got 28 medium muffins.
I followed the direction for mixing.  I definitely will be making these for our church bake sale.

First, this recipe makes A LOT of batter.  I made 12 full-size muffins (bake 20 min), 24 mini-muffins (bake 15 min), and put the remaining batter in a 9x4 loaf pan (bake at 350 for 60 min).  I also made a few adjustments since I was snowed in and didn't have the exact ingredients listed.  5 eggs, half & half instead of sour cream, butter instead of vegetable oil.  They were awesome!

I did not care for these muffins, nor did my son.  He said they were the worst I had ever made!  I make my own all-purpose baking mix and usually use it when I make muffins.  Mine are so much better.  Mine have much less sugar, but these were not sweet or flavorful.  I agree with one person who said they lacked something.  I'm sure I will not make these again.  To top it all off, I made these for a bake sale because I wanted something out of the ordinary.  Also wasted a whole container of sour cream.

This is a great recipe.  Followed the exact recipe except, I didn't have any sour cream.  I used regular, plain, low fat yogurt.  The muffins were amazing.

I halved this recipe but otherwise followed it exactly.  Muffins were moist and rose nicely.  My family thought the sweetness was fine and liked the muffins.  Might try them with a streusel topping some morning when I have time.  Also might try Greek yogurt for the sour cream.  Definitely a keeper - I will make these again.

Lesson Learned, NEVER bake muffins without foil/paper muffin liners.

My blueberry cream muffins came out looking delightful until I tried to remove them from my non-stick Teflon pan that was lightly sprayed with cooking oil.

I'm at medium elevation (not near ocean or high mountains), and it took my muffins 30 minutes to cook at 400 degrees.  Test to see if the toothpick comes out clean.  I used 1/3 cup of safflower oil instead.  I added 50/50 white & brown sugar, and used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg to the dry ingredients.  I also used the crumb topping from the 'To Die For Blueberry Muffins'.  When making this crumb topping I used two butter knives to crumb the mixture. I will reduced the crumb topping a little next time because it was to much, and fill my muffin mixture 2/3rds in the muffin pan instead, then top with the crumb mixture.  That way the edges don't overflow and burn.

HAPPY BAKING :)

These muffins are unbelievably delicious.  Didn't do a thing to alter the recipe.  My family's favorite.  They freeze well also!

Loved this recipe! My sister and I thought the cinnamon coating was delicious! I didn't have vanilla extract but they didn't really need it. Will definitely make again!

These are lovely blueberry muffins.  I accidentally put in more sour cream--probably about another cup's worth.  It still was completely fine in this recipe, amazingly enough.  I did add more blueberries on purpose.  At the designated temp and time, perfectly done.  I had bread in the oven at 350 with my first batch, and that took about 40 minutes, so you will have to double the time if you prefer to bake at 350.  These are nice little muffins, pretty sweet but not too sweet, and it counteracts the blueberries perfectly.  I topped with some turbinado sugar for prettiness and they were lovely, but you don't have to--they are pretty enough and sweet enough without.  You can heap the batter in these--they were almost completely full and they didn't rise over and stick to the pan like some muffins will.  Very nice, very easy, and I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream (Shh, don't tell!) and they were still awesome.  Thanks for the recipe!

Baked a test muffin without blueberries and in 20 minutes it came out perfect. Light, moist. High golden dome with a cute lil crack in the middle, nothing to complain about. 
Adding blueberries though I see I need a longer baking time, maybe because my blueberries were frozen(I don't like the juice tinting the batter so I prefer freezing my blueberries overnight). Had to add extra 10 minutes and that did the trick, so I guess with frozen berries 30 min would be the right time.
As I am European and do not care for diets and such, I added softened butter rather than oil, and to avoid the very crunchy crystallised top you sometimes get with regular granulated sugar I used half caster and half regular. Turned out excellent. 
I can't promise my measurements were super precise, for example, I added only as much sour cream as I had on hand(~300g, recipe said 460), my butter stick is 180g, so that's what went into it. I didn't have vanilla extract so I used a few generous teaspoons of powdered vanilla sugar, also added a teaspoon of baking powder(I was a little surprised when I only saw baking soda, I always think for proper rise in cakes and such you need baking powder..). 
Maybe because of my alterations, maybe in spite of them the muffins are quite perfect and I'll be making these again soon(blueberry season here!).

We absolutely loved these muffins!  I did add just a little cinnamon to the batter.  I made some adding the streusel topping recipe from To Die For Blueberry Muffins off this site as suggested by another reviewer and some without.  I preferred them as the recipe stated, but, my husband liked the streusel topped.  I think they would also be great with a some lemon zest added to the batter.

This is the only blueberry muffin recipe I will use from now on; easy to make, moist and flavorful.  I did add lemon zest as a personal choice.  I also sprinkled one tablespoon of the flour over the blueberries before folding them into the battery to ensure the berries did not sink.  Since there are only two of us I froze the leftovers and they are perfect to defrost and eat later.  My husband agreed these are best ever.

I made this recipe, but I did not have any sour cream so I used Wiped Cream cheese. It took double the amount of time to cook them. Over all the were pretty good, it was the first time I ever made Blueberry muffins from scratch

I just made these this a.m. for church, but I ran short on time, so I missed the coffee/fellowship time. After the service my husband announced that there were home-made blueberry muffins in the kitchen if anyone was interested. (meager attendance this week-lots of folks on vacation). I headed home to start dinner & asked him to bring the dish home...they were snatched up! I just sprinkled some granulated sugar on top. They are very moist, with good flavor, and I actually used the ice cream scoop & still had 29 muffins. I will definately make these again, & maybe try the suggested extra berries & 1/2 brown sugar in the batter, & streusel topping.

These are the best blueberry muffins, I didn't make any changes except to cut the recipe in half then added 1/2 cup extra blueberries and an extra dash of vanilla.  I used a medium cupcake/muffin pan and it made about 15 of them...I filled them up almost to the top so they would bake with a nice dome top.

This is a great recipe as is and is my go to muffin recipe.  I made them again this morning and substituted coconut oil for the vegitable oil and added the zest of one lemon.  Came out great!  I also like to add some cinnamon for extra flavor.  Also great with Craisins and orange extract for cranberry orange muffins.  Very versatile!

I halfed the sugar in this recipe and added a cup of bananas because I only had a cup of blueberries.  I also subbed 1 cup of whole wheat flour for all purpose.  I also didn't have sour cream so I used greek yogurt.  As you see, I changed the recipe a good bit. But these muffins are really yummy!  Next time I will not 1/2 the sugar, because I ended up frosting them because they weren't sweet enough, but the texture of these muffins was really great!  They are also really pretty.  I had batter leftover so I made a blueberry loaf.  I iced it as well.  Yummy! Thanks for the idea to put sour cream in.

I fixed this recipe this morning for breakfast. All I can say is YUM! I did make a slight change, I made it in a Bundt pan for a coffee cake. Every one ate at least 2 slices even the five year old picky eater. I will be making it again. Thanks so much for this recipe. ( I did substitute 1 cup of Splenda for a cup of sugar.)

It was much more on the bland side than I had expected. It yielded 3 dozen muffins, not 2 dozen.  The prep time was closer to 45 minutes. Unless you are an experienced baker, this one takes some practice and patience.  Good luck with this one.

This recipe turned out very nice, the recipe was fairly easy to follow, I would make no changes to how I prepared this recipe as the muffins came out with a nice golden top. I would recommend this recipe to family, friends and to those who like good blueberry muffins as a tasty treat.

This is the only blueberry muffin recipe that I make.  I found it on this site over 10 years ago, so that is saying something.  People always ask me if I really made these because they are sure they came from a bakery.  I smile sweetly and offer them the recipe to see for themselves.  The batter is awesome and lends itself to may changes: I have used wheat flour, applesauce in place of oil, and even used it as the base for a cake with powdered jello and berries added before baking.  Thank you KK3 for sharing!

This recipe is a really good start to a great muffin.  At first I tried making the recipe according to the directions, adding extra blueberries as a lot of the reviews recommend.  I have to agree that the original recipe is a little bland.  For the next batch I added brown sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla.  These turned out okay.  For the last batch I added chopped bananas and streusel topping from the To Die For Blueberry Muffins with chopped pecans.  These were the best.  The reason this is such a good recipe to start is the texture and the muffins rise and make a nice top, not flop like some muffins.  (Note:  I am at 9000 feet altitude.  This is a good high altitude recipe. I put just a tad less of the salt and soda.)

These muffins are so-o-o good. I just made them and had to taste one right away. I did let them cool a bit. I only made half the recipe,and that's probably a good idea because I have no will power and would eat way too many. I did follow the recipe exactly, other than cutting it in half. Will definitely make these again.

I liked it, but it's still not as good as bakery muffins. I used frozen blueberries and it turned all of my batter purple. They seem a little too firm, almost like a biscuit. I don't understand why I can't find a recipe that for blueberry muffins that taste better then what I could buy.

It's most certainly the sour cream that makes it. These are so moist and delicious, they never last long in the house. I've also made a pumpkin version using the basics of this recipe, cutting back the oil and adding butterscotch chips. They are truly amazing!

These were pretty good, but I also added 1/2 cup more of the sugar and 1/2 cup more of the blueberries, so I ended up with about 32 muffins instead of 24. Honestly not sure if I would make them again, seemed a little off and not really sweet or what I was expecting them to be.

The muffins are good. A little bland, but if you use tasty/fresh blueberries, they make up for it. 

Followed the recipe exactly, but after 15 minutes (the first I checked) they were BURNT. Bottoms were 1/4 inch of burnt batter, and they were burnt around the edges, but the middle was pure batter :(

I don't know why -- don't see any reviews complaining of this, and I know my oven is correct because I use several different thermometers. I didn't change anything in the recipe at all. 

Also, makes more than 24. Filled my cups to the brim, made 24, they burned.

Lowered to 350 and easily made 20 mini muffins with remaining batter.

Very good and very pretty muffins! Followed recipe as written except for the blueberries. I added three cups, as we love lots of berries. It was a perfect amount. These are not too sweet and I noticed that others added more sugar, but we liked them like this. I did dust sugar on the tops prior to baking. Everyone thought that these looked like they came from a bakery. I will make these again. Thanks KK3!

Used chocolate chips instead of blueberries, and vanilla Greek yogurt in place of sour cream.  They were a BIG HIT!

Very good! Next time I will try adding sour cream and blueberries to flour mixture at the same time to see if there is a difference. When it comes to muffins, the less mixing the better.

These muffins are absolutely fabulous made just as the recipe states!  The only thing I added was some lemon zest (because I love the combination of lemon and blueberry) This is now my go to blueberry muffing recipe. My family gobbled them up!

Wonderful, wonderful muffins!  I usually make a new dish by the recipe and did so this time except...I added about 1 cup more fresh Texas blueberries.  This is a very good muffin without being overly sweet.  If you want sweet, add more sugar or maybe just a sugary crumb topping.  My oven required 25 min cooking.

These were quite good, the kids had a lot of fun making this uncomplicated recipe.  I did however, sub in natural yoghurt for the sour cream, and halfed the sugar and used 1/2 a cup of maple syrup instead, as we try to avoid using refined sugar often.  We will make them again for sure!

Made as recipe directed, except used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar because I was running low on white sugar. Looked beautiful and the batter was yummy, but the resulting muffins were lacking...something. Maybe I'll try them with the additional sugar others were adding. Or maybe the streusel topping would be enough. They looked beautiful and baked perfectly, but were just a teeny bit bland. I'm sure they could be tweaked to be a 5, though!!

When I first started making these, I was thinking to myself that it was going to be greasy! But once they bake, they're excellent! I don't have oil seeping through the baking cups, they're nice and airy. Yum!

These muffins bake up beautifully high and light and moist.  I did add 1 tsp. lemon zest and a streusel topping, but otherwise followed the directions as given.  I also used frozen berries since that is what I had.  They are wonderful on day 2 as well!

My muffins were still raw after 20 minutes.  Took more like 40.  They tasted ok, but definitely not as amazing as the reviews led me to believe.

I reduced the oil by half and added one large mashed banana.  I also added a mix of berries insted of just blue berries.  I thought the taste was wonderful, but gave this recipe 4 stars simply because I thought I thought one cup of oil would be too much.

I finally got to make these muffins according to the recipe. The last couple times I made them, I didn't have enough sour cream, so I used yogurt instead. Still very good muffins, but when I got to use all sour cream, the difference was ASTONISHING. They looked gorgeous, tasted absolutely unbelievably scrumptious, and just were generally amazing. Nice and moist, delicious both fresh and a few days old. I would also recommend not using the instructions that come with the recipe. It's a lot simpler just mixing the wet and then the dry, and then adding them together. These were a hit with everyone.

Recipe was delicious!  I actually halved the recipe and instead of cooking as muffins I made in a loaf pan and it came out perfect.  I cooked additional time, approximately 10 more minutes.  Recommend!

Tasty and easy recipe.  I mixed all of the liquid ingredients together (including the sour cream) and folded the dry ingredients into that.  I then added in the frozen blueberries.  Mine took a few minutes longer to cook due to the frozen blueberries.  I used half white and half brown sugar.  These came out fluffy and light and not heavy like some muffins can be.

Very easy!  I cooked these for just me, so I quartered the recipe and only made 6 of them.  That was last night and only three of them are left this morning.  They are very tasty. I used fozen blueberries because I find that folding them into the batter is easier and they don't break apart right away.

Great base recipe. I used 1/2 cup of applesauce, 1/2 cup of oil, 1 cup of white sugar, and 1 cup of light brown sugar. I also added cinnamon because I love pairing blueberries with cinnamon. I didn't have sour cream so I used low fat blueberry yogurt. The muffins were so moist and just the right amount of sweetness. I made one batch with just blueberries and then in the second batch, I added white chocolate chips. The white chocolate chips just added another level of sweetness and made them more dessert-like.

I loved this recipe.  The muffins stayed nice and fresh for days.  I added the extra sugar like some reviews have suggested and also threw more blueberries into the batter.  Very nice muffin. I will make these again.

The best muffins. No need for a special topping on these. They are beautiful and moist. I did sub 1 c of whole wheat flour, half brown and white sugar, 1 c more blueberries, and used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 greek yogurt. Will make again.

Excellent- the only thing I changed was to use half blueberry yogurt and half sour cream, 1/2 brown sugar instead of all white.

Very easy and yummy! I substituted half the sugar for brown sugar (just a personal preference) and added some additional blueberries. I also topped some with a crumb topping and some with sanding sugar. Everybody loved them!

I made this as is and was very satisfied.  The muffins are very moist.  Next time around I might add some nutmeg, but this is a good base to start from.

I needed to use up some buttermilk so I melted 6TB butter and added enough buttermilk to make 2 cups. I substituted applesauce for the oil. Added 1 tsp. cinnamon and used 1 cup frozen blueberries and 1 cup frozen blackberries! This recipe is easy, versitile and delicious--- they are really moist too!

Great, flavorful muffins.   The sour cream gives them a much less crumbly consistency than other muffin recipes.  Changing to 1/2 brown sugar and adding some cinnamon adds a little more depth of flavor.  Filling my (standard) muffin tins only 2/3 full made for short muffins (not above the lip)  Fill them up at least 3/4 of the way- the puffy dome looks much prettier.  I followed many of the recommendations from MommyFromSeattle:  added  2 1/2 cups blueberries instead of 2.  I should have listened to her and taken it up to 3, they could have handled more blueberries.   I used 1 cup of light brown sugar, and one of white and added 1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to the flour mixture.  I ignored the mixing instructions, and mixed all my wet in the order given, then folded in all my dry ingredients, and added blueberries last (they were frozen, partially thawed).   I was careful to not over mix my batter.  I did not think that these needed a streusel topping, they are amazing as is.  But I also dislike how streusel topping get sort of soggy after a day or two - and don't freeze well. If i was making these for a big group and they'd get eaten right away, maybe I would try the topping recommended by MamafromSeattle.

An excellent recipe! I added 1 tsp of cinnamon. Also, instead of all-purpose flour, I did 2 c of ww, 1.5 c of all-purpose, and 1/2 c of bran. I also added decorating sugar to the top to give it some crunch. I'll definitely use this recipe again!

These were super easy to make and professional quality.  They are so so so moist!  
I used the crumb recipe from another review. 1 C flour, 1/2 C brown sugar, 6 Tbs chopped cold butter. Pinched and put on top right before the oven. Such a great idea! 
I cut wax paper in squares to make (large) muffin cups that look more professional. It made 14 large muffins.

In spite of my error, the omission of the oil, these were very good.  They were all gone in no time.  The other thing I did a little different, was to put a little bit of a streusel on top.

I love this recipe.  You MUST follow the directions and not miz everything at once.  They will turn out dense and gooey if you do (trust me!) other reviews have said you don't need to alternate the sour cream and this may be true... but follow the directions on everything else.  I sometimes add cinnamon and raisins (instead of blueberries for a different taste.  Enjoy!

These were good muffins, they tasted like you would expect blueberry muffins to taste, I made them exactly as the recipe called for... but I half expected them to be "cream" muffins. I made this thinking there would be a creamy aspect and there was not. This definitively does not deserve the amount of raving it has , they were simply ordinary.

Delicious! Great texture, moist and filling. I'm not a fan of too many flavors all at once, so I didn't add anything and loved them as is. My only complaint is that now my stomach hurts from devouring two of them!

I was a bit leery of the sour cream, but I'm convinced after trying these muffins that that's the key to the whole recipe.  I made these for my mom's Mother's Day breakfast, and my family devoured them.  Like a previous reviewer stated, adding the cinnamon crumbles from a different recipe topped them off perfectly.  These were definitely a hit.

I changed this recipe a lot and I feel bad about reviewing it that way, but I can only imagine how  good they would have been had I followed the recipe to a T.  I was making these for my 3 year old, so wanted them to be healthier.  I used soy flour instead of white, applesauce in place of oil, yogurt in place of sour cream and added extra blueberries.  Overall we ended up with delicious moist muffins.

Very good. My husband is not big on muffins and such, but he really liked these. I didn't have sour cream on hand so I used vanilla yogurt.

Took recommendations of others and added crumb topping.  50/50 with white and brown sugar, added cinnamon and extra berries.  Soooo good!  Would be five stars with above recommendations.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and they turned out great. I was going to use some brown sugar in exchange for some of the white as per some other reviewers suggestions but I didn't have any. I'm glad I didn't make this change. They turned out great following the recipe as listed (very moist) and the muffins had a nice color. They also freeze well. I just microwave one muffin for 20 secs right out of the freezer and they are just as good and moist as fresh.

The owner of the field where I picked my fresh blueberries recommended this recipe.  The recipe is nothing impressive and next time I intend to use the "To Die for Blueberry Muffins" recipe.  Although the batter was sweet and my blueberries were fresh, as a whole, the muffins were bland...very similar to a box mix.

These were awesome!  Followed the reviews and upped sugar by 1/2 cup and used 1/2 brown.  Also added 1 cups more blueberries....PERFECT!  I froze some for later use and they weren't as moist...they're best eaten fresh!

I have made these twice now and they are sensational. Follow as per instructions and they come out perfectly. My oven heats very quickly, so there was no need for me to pre-heat. I simply stuck them in the cold oven, heated to 400 and let them go for 18 minutes. Absolutely perfect!

That was Ok. They looked great, but it was missing something. I can't place what it was missing but it needed it. Maybe it was more vanilla or cinnamon.

Excellent! A couple of changes I made...I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar instead of 2 cups of white and to that I added an extra 1/2 cup of sugar (I used 1/4 brown sugar and 1/4 white sugar to make that extra 1/2 cup), I added 1 tbls. of lemon juice (next time I will either add more lemon juice or add some lemon zest), I used 2 cups of wheat flour and 2 cups of white flour instead of 4 cups of white, and topped off the muffins with a strudel topping that another person recommend in their review. Great use for fresh blueberries!!!

I have been looking for the perfect blueberry muffins for years. This is it!  The only change I make is to substitute half the oil for applesauce.  Otherwise, everything else is the same.  I use 2 "jumbo muffin" pans, which makes 12 muffins in all.  Sprinkle the tops with a bit of sugar just before putting them in the oven for a crunchy,  shiny treat!

Had a only slightly healthier version with wholemeal flour and olive oil. The other reviews were right, it needs slightly more sugar, however I don't like my baking to be less sweet so it was good for me. My muffins got really moist really fast, my only complaint would be the top of the muffin was too moist so a little less pretty. Baked an extra 5 minutes on top of the time stated in the recipe.

These were EXCELLENT as is!!!  I made twice, once exactly as recipe read and the second time with half white and half brown sugars.  Both ways were just as good, but the brown sugar added a bit of under lying favor that no one could figure out what it was.  I consider this my little secret and will probably make them that way from now on, otherwise, don't change a thing!!

After reading the excellent reviews on these muffin I hoped I'd finally found THE blueberry muffin recipe.  Unfortunately this was not the case.  They were just okay.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Lots of blueberries, not alot of taste.  I find thats the probably with any homemade blueberry muffins.  I'll stick to my blueberry coffeecake.

These muffins are fantastic! I used half whole wheat and half white flour and they came out great. Very moist and fluffy, with the perfect consistency inside and out! They were subtly sweet, so if you like more sweetness, I'd suggest adding a bit more sugar to the batter or making a streusel topping.

These are really good.  I added the 2 teaspoons of Cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg and I added the struesal on top.  I also used 3 cups of berries instead of 2.  They are the best muffins I have ever had!!!  Thank you for a REALLY good recipe!!

Overall good muffin recipe.  I added 1 tbsp. of vanilla instead of 1tsp.  I thought the recipe could have used more sugar but my family said they were fine.

Simply amazing. The only change I made was to do 1 cup of white sugar and one cup of brown sugar, with a lot more blueberries.

This is a very good recipe.. coming from a critic. I mixed brown sugar with the white though. Very moist muffin. You can use frozen blueberries too.. just thaw them before mixing them in. Batter will be fairly firm. If the batter is not firm, then you have not followed the recipe well... This can be baked as a cake too, but it will take about 40 minutes at the same temperature. Enjoy!

This is a very good muffin recipe and we enjoyed it very much, however it does have a cake like texture - that is why I gave it the 4 stars.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and had no problems.  Thanks for contributing.

Followed this exactly as listed. Thought these were ok, but not that sweet. Probably won't make them again, but got a nice batch.

UMM....these were delicious!!  I halved the recipe and I think I could have gotten more than 12..but they were sheer heaven. I did as others suggested, I used more sugar and blueberries.  We had smoked some baby back ribs, along with red potato salad and the muffins made for a wonderful meal.  The old man couldn't stop raving on how wonderful the meal was. I will use this recipe from now on. Thanks for sharing with all of us!!

YUM! YUM! YUM!!!    Made these with fresh blueberries from my yard.  Sorry now that I scaled down the recipe for 12, they went fast!  Otherwise followed the recipe to a T.  Will make again soon.  After several attempts, I finally got a pic to upload!

Made with whole wheat flour and extra blueberries. Substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream. Yum! Put leftover cream cheese frosting on top, which made them sinful!

I have made these many, many times. Last couple of times I have subbed plain yoghurt (3.25% fat) for the sour cream and I was shocked at how amazing they were. Very fluffy and moist -- lighter than the sour cream version but with full flavour and even better texture.

These were delicious. The sour cream gave them a nice zip, and they were sweet and flavorful. The BF said they could do with a bit of sugar on top, but I loved them just the way they were! This is the ONLY blueberry muffin recipe I will EVER use again!

Perfect! Light, tasty. I also added 3 cups of blueberries. We watch our sugar so I cut down to 3/4 c brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. Bumped up vanilla. I made large muffins and then mini muffins which I then tossed lightly with cinnamon sugar and popped into freezer to take to the cabin.   Thanks for sharing!

Great! I use fat-free sour cream and replace some of the oil with applesauce. If I had enough eggs I would've replaced some with just whites. I did add a sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg and replaced some white with brown sugar. I did not add extra sugar as others suggested, but I did add extra blueberries, that's the best part! I will make these again!

Really good! The sour cream makes it really moist. The only thing I changed was I added more sugar, and a dash of nutmeg to the batter.

I've made these and the "To Die for Blueberry Muffins," also from these site.  These take the cake!  They are so good.  I typically will make a strussel topping to go with it.  Seriously, these are very good muffins.  My husband is a connoisseur (or thinks he is) of blueberry muffins and said these are the best he's had yet.

followed directions exactly, except did not add salt and did add 1 tsp of cinnamon. Used frozen blueberries. They turned out great!

I have made this recipe three times. First time, followed the recipe exactly (added a little more vanilla than 1tsp though) and the muffins were great..the best. The second time I took someone else's advice and subbed applesauce for the oil...they were ok. I made them again tonight using the recipe as is and they again were the best. Sure, the applesauce makes them lower fat but why bother making a muffin then? If you're so concerned about fat then just eat the bluberries. Don't ruin a good recipe.

I love this recipe!  I have made these at least ten times and it's quite versatile.  I've substituted other dry fruits and choc. chips for the b berries.  It tastes wonderful.  After the first few times I added a bit of cinnamon and/or orange zest to the batter to enhance the flavour.  Thanks!

The first time I made these, they were great... But missing something. I only make a half batch at a time. The 2nd time I made these, I added the zest of 1 lemon and added 1/4 tsp of almond extract. They were amazing!

I like that the recipe is really easy and thick so the blueberries don't fall to the bottom. I added a little cinnamon and instead of 2c sugar it needs atleast 21/2c sugar. I also used 3c blueberries instead of 2c.

This recipe was wonderful, I did add a 1/2 cup of sugar more, and did half granulated and half brown sugar, and I used 3 cups of blueberries, and used a struesel topping, they are delicious, I am really impressed that the sour cream works so well in this recipe. Kudos.

Great recipe! I wanted to make it a little healthier so I replaced the sugar with Splenda and the oil with 1 c. of applesauce. I also used fat free sour cream and added some cinnamon. They turned out wonderful and absolutely delicious! I'm glad I didn't half the recipe as I had planned.

We always have muffins in my house so I am always trying to find good new recipes. This one is a keeper, these are the best blueberry muffins I have ever had, and the whole family agrees. They are so moist and full of flavor. The only thing is you need to eat them as soon as possible, because they are not nearly as soft the next day. Since we can't keep our hands off them we don't usually have that problem!

These are the best blueberry muffins I have made so far.  They are very moist.  If I had more blueberries I would have added the 3 cups as some other reviewers suggested, but I only had two.  They were still so so good.  I made a streusel topping and sprinkled on right before baking.  Don't be afraid to fill it up right to the top.  They bake into these beautiful, huge bakery size muffins.  I also used an ice cream scoop which made it easier to scoop the batter.

This is a good recipe. I made it into loaves and added a streusel topping for extra flavor. I followed the recipe except substituting 1 cup whole wheat flour for part of the regular flour. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because the last time I made blueberry bread I made a blueberry zucchini bread (also found on this site) which turned out moister and with more flavor. This is a good recipe, but I will probably stick with the blueberry zucchini bread in the future. My husband had felt it sounded strange to have zucchini and blueberry together, but loved it.

I followed the recipe as stated and my muffins fell flat. I added 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 granulated sugar as reviewers suggested. The flavor of these were good, but they were not as pretty as Jordan Marshes muffins for me. But I love blueberry muffins so these were not wasted, just not the recipe for me.

The recipe calls for too much oil & too much sugar, in my opinion. I could see as soon as I took them out of the oven that something was amiss. Very greasy in the mouth. I do like them, and will make them again - but with less oil & less sugar. I did change the sugar up like other reviews have mentioned, and used half white, half brown. Not sure if it was the best idea. Next time I'll try with all white sugar. Better than the last couple of recipes I tried!

Very good and fresh out of the oven! I halfed the recipe, used fresh frozen local blueberries, used 1/4 cup of oil and used low fat sour cream. Next time I'll probably use 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup. I found the muffins a bit sweet. I don't recommend a non-stick muffin pan though. I wanted to go "green" but it was hard digging the muffins out of the pan. I love this recipe. The muffins were moist and not oily, unlike some other recipes that require you to use a lot of butter/oil. AWESOME!

Great recipe with bakery store results. The best looking muffins I've ever made. I took some of the advise of other reviewers and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. I did not add extra sugar, and I definitely should have. I followed the recipe exactly (except for sugars) and found them to be a bit bland/ although the texture is perfect. I like a sweeter muffin. Will definitely make these again and add another 1/2 cup of sugar. This recipe made 6 jumbo muffins and a 8"x4" loaf. Golden brown on the outside - just beautiful!

These were by far the best blueberry muffins I have ever made. I used milk instead of sour cream because I didn't have any on hand (but I'll definitely use sour cream when I have it!) . I took advice from other reviewers and used half white and half brown sugar, I also used way more vanilla (just cause I love it!) and about a teaspoon of strawberry extract for some added fun. I also took some advice from another reviewer and used an old-fashioned ice cream scoop. The muffins came out all the same size- nice and big!  I highly recommend using this recipe. It's the only blueberry muffin recipe I'll ever use again! So fabulous! Thanks for sharing!

These were okay. The recipe for "To Die For Blueberry Muffins" is way better. I thought these would be moister and there wasn't enough blueberries in them per the recipe. I will be sticking with the "To Die For Blueberry Muffins" recipe also on this site.

I probably overmixed these but they were still really good.  They weren't too crumbly like some muffins are.  I had to half the batch because I didn't have enough fresh blueberries but it wasn't a problem, it made 12 large muffins.  Next time I'll try it with fresh raspberries.

An excellent and moist muffin.  I made the recipe as it stands and feel it is a little bland and not terribly sweet.  I think a crumb topping would probably be an excellent addition.  I will also try using 1/2 brown sugar the next time around.  To me these were the homemade equivalent to the boxed Duncan Hines muffins as far as sweetness and zip goes.

Thought this was going to be good but I was wrong! they were good if I wanted a pancake! Not sweet AT ALL!! They LOOKED good, but VERY BLAND Tasting. Add sugar and a topping to get a sweeter muffin. I bet they would be good crumbled up with syrup over them!

Made a whole lot of muffins.  Not very sweet.  I added brown sugar to the tops of the second batch to add a little sweetness to them.  Not sure how I could have added more blueberries as my muffins were overflowing with the 2 cups.

Super yummy!!! My kids ask me to make these all the time. Instead of the oil, I used applesauce. If you do this be sure to grease or spray your muffin pan with nonstick cooking spray or they'll stick really bad.

A perfect recipe.  I used low-fat sour cream and it tasted fantastic!  I've used this recipe a couple of times now, sometimes halved, sometimes full. It always makes the exact number of muffins, filled to the top of the cups.  Moist, sweet, delicious!  A favorite of my boyfriend's too.

I subbed yogurt for the sour cream, and these turned out tasty.  I couldn't stop eating them! I also sprinkled some sugar on top of the muffins while baking. Gave it a little extra something.

I made a half recipe in an 11X7" pan.  It took about 40 minutes to bake. I just didn't have the time to make individual muffins. I substituted vanilla yogurt for the sour cream and applesauce for the oil and my family ate the whole cake in 24 hours.

These were absolutley the best  blueberry muffins I have made yet-- thanks for sharing your  recipe.

This was pretty good, and easy to make.  They were very moist.  However, I think it needed a little something more...but I'm not sure what.  Maybe an extra teaspoon of vanilla?  It just was a little bland.  I added some homemade streusel on top, and that gave it some extra flavor.

I finally had the chance to make this muffin.  it came out dense but moist which was a bit off from what i was looking for.  I wanted the muffin to be light and tender.  But the flavor is good.  I will definitely try again.  Maybe I overmix the batter.  thanks!

I halved the recipe and they were gone so fast!!!!! It made a lot too, a dozen muffins an a modest sized loaf. I made a struessel topping with my food processor an I think it really added to it. I would def. make these again, as is!! The batch was gone in less than three days. THANK YOU THANK YOU

I made these using a few of the suggestions: adding 1 tsp. cinnamon, and substituting part of the white sugar with brown. Was told these were the best blueberry muffins they've ever had by friends when I brought them to a picnic.

I made these today, and they are delicious! I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, strawberries instead of blueberries, and applesauce instead of vegetable oil. They are the perfect amount of fruity-sweet. Thankyou for this great recipe!

VERY,VERY YUMMY!!!  My husband and I ate 2 dozen in just a few days!   I did follow the suggestion of others and changed the sugar to 1 1/4cup brown and 1 1/4 cup white.  Also increased vanilla to 1 tablespoon.  I had a ton of blueberries so ended up using about 3 cups, which I will continue to use in the future. I did everything else a written and they were just wonderful!!!  Very moist!!!

This was a good and nice and easy recipe. I don't think I cooked them long enough or filled the cups up sufficiently. I'll try again and do that. Also it made so many that I cooked only twelve in the muffin pans and used the remaining batter to make three mini loaves which I shared with neighbors. Yummy.

My 9 year old daughter made these for breakfast yesterday and they are by far the best I've ever had.  So moist and light.  Not dry and dense like most muffins.  She's going to make more today and bring them to the neighbors!  Definitely a keeper!

make a slot of batter, but very yummy! I think they would be awesome with a crumb topping. I will make them again that way.

Followed the recipe with the exception of using white and brown sugar.   Also added 2 tsp. cinnimon to the flour mixture. Used 3 cups of frozen blueberries folded in at the end.  Filled the muffin cups to the top.  Made the Barefoot Contessa Crumb Topping suggested by a reviewer.  Came out picture perfect and the muffins are delicious!

Without a doubt the best blueberry muffins I've ever made!  Taste and texture were exactly what I wanted.  Per other reviews, I followed these suggestions:  I increased the sugar by 1/2 cup (using 1 1/4 white sugar and 1 1/4 brown sugar) and I increased the vanilla to 1 TBSP.  I didn't realize until I was mixing ingredients that someone had used from the new sour cream container and I was 3/4 cup short.  I had to substitute using 1 TBSP lemon juice then adding enough milk to make 3/4 cup and mixing in 1/3 cup butter.  It worked out just fine.  This recipe is a definite keeper!  Thank you very much for submitting it, KK3.

December 5, 2010- Yum!  These were delicious.  I recommend using papper liners, because these muffins are very moist.  I made one third with a crumb topping, one third with a lemon glaze and one third plain. I liked the crumb topping best, the lemon glaze made it taste too much like a dessert.  Although, dessert for breakfast is always good.  This is a perfect addition to your brunch menu.
May 20, 2013- So delicious!  This time, we altered the recipe, by following reviewers suggestions of 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar, we also used 1/2 all-purpose flour and 1/2 wheat flour, we added 1 tsp cinnamon, and substituted vanilla Greek yogurt for sour cream.  Whenever we bake muffins, we always coat the blueberries or dried fruit in the flour mixture, prior to folding it into the ingredients.  We didn't use paper liners, but we did let the muffins sit in their tins for about five minutes before removing and setting aside on a cooling rack.  Yummy!

Great muffins.  The first time I used a crumb topping and the second time I topped them with sugar in the raw.  Both were good, but I got requests to go back to the crumb topping.  You will wish you added more blueberries.  I now add about a cup more.

Did half brown sugar half reg sugar, added a little nutmeg and Cinnamon and used raspberries instead of blueberries (since i had a bunch). would try to use applesauce instead of oil next time for lower fat.

This is the recipe for me! I've made more blueberry muffin recipes than I can count, and this one is my personal favorite. When trying a new recipe of any kind, I always make it with the original ingredients, no additions or substitutions. This recipe does NOT need any topping, in my humble opinion. I will admit to halving the recipe, tho, because the four of us couldn't eat two dozen. I used large, fresh blueberries. I read several of the reviews, and so many wanted to tweak the recipe in some way. I like it the way it is.
Update: I made this recipe again with the intention of halving it, but goofed and put the full amount of salt and baking soda in. I didn't want to scrap it, so I just added the rest of the flour in the dry ingredients and added the other two eggs and 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of more oil. I only had enough blueberries for half the recipe, so I divided the batter and made half with the blueberries, and in the other half of the batter I added a cup of fresh, chopped strawberries, 1/2 cup of chopped pecans, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. All the muffins turned out beautifully, with nicely rounded crowns. I agree that this is a very forgiving recipe! For those who said that the muffins were flat and dense, something has to have been done incorrectly, or the oven is not baking at the correct temperature. I think it is very important to check the temperature output on one's oven, especially if it is more than a few years old.

1st time - Fabulous!  I did it exactly as stated. I did use blueberries from a blueberry bush instead of store-bought so they were a little larger than usual.  but still AWESOME!!! I had everything already in the house so it was great to not have to go out and buy anything extra.

few times later - I was as impressed with this as I made it over and over.  maybe I did something different the first time that made it better...

I already rated this recipe, but Im just wondering if anyone can give me tips for not burning the muffin bottoms! They always come out perfect except burnt at the bottom of the paper.. Would it be better to turn down the temperature, or just not leave them in for the full amount of time?! Thanks for your help!

Yum,yum,yummy! I used a dark pan, so I lowered the oven temp to 350 and baked for about 20 minutes. I used about 2 1/2 cups of blueberries and they came out great, so soft and moist. It made 24 full size muffins and about 15 mini muffins. I am going to freeze them in individual packets, so on rushed mornings I can pull one out, throw it in the microwave an enjoy. This will be my blueberry muffin recipe from now on!!

I'm giving this 5 stars because this is the best blueberry muffin I've ever had.  There was something missing though that would have made it over the top, but I can't pin point what it was.  Very good, thanks for sharing!!!

Nice and moist muffins. The only thing to make them any better would have been a streusel topping.

Great recipe! Made these for mothers day and it made a ton. The kids loved them. I followed the recipe, but added a cinnamon topping to make it crunchy, from the too die for blueberry muffins recipe on here. They turned out fantastic. I would beware anyone who is going to do this, that your muffin pan will never be the same. The topping was all gooey and melted to the pan pretty much and have been washing it for days. I gave this recipe 5 stars b/c is was delicious, but anyone trying the topping, clean right away.

Awesome muffins!  I love taking these for a quick breakfast in the mornings... and we've been eating them all week.  I used one cup of wheat flour, applesauce for the oil, and did half white/half brown sugar.  They are a little sticky for some reason... don't know what I subbed did that, but they taste great!

YUM! These muffins turned out great. They were very moist and tasted great the next day. I did add a streusel topping but could have left it off and they still would have been great. Definitely a keeper.

These came really excellent! They were well received by me and my husband. He's sort of a picky eater and very honest about whether something I'm trying out for the first time is good or not..so I don't make it again! This recipe is awesome, I would defintely recommend it! Good breakfast item :)

Definitely use more blueberries! I reduced the oil and added extra sour cream to make up the moisture.  The oil was still all I could taste!  They were bland and really dense (even though I barely mixed the batter).

This is a really good base recipe.  I used whole wheat flour, applesauce instead of oil and half white sugar-half turbinado sugar.  They were sweet enough for me and didn't need more sugar.  I also added extra blueberries, as others have suggested.  Will make these again.

These muffins are incredibly easy to make and soo tasty! The only adjustments I made were using fat free sour cream and I didn't have any blueberries on hand so I cut up strawberries to the size of blueberries and it was a wonderful choice! When i do have blueberries i will have to make them again, but for now i will enjoy my strawberry version. :)

This was a very simple recipe that turned out wonderful blueberry muffins. I cut recipe in half, which still gave 12 very large muffins. Added 1/2 tsp b.powder, 2 Tb lemon juice, 2 tsp vanilla, and used canola oil instead of veg. oil. Sprinkled generous amount of raw sugar on top and baked for 19 1/2 minutes. They are very moist and pretty!  usually I do half each of brown/white sugar, but was in a hurry and did all white. They had plenty of flavor and rose really high!

These muffins are amazing! All right, I used one cup brown sugar and one cup white sugar. As I ran out of flour, I used 3 cups of flour and one cup oatmeal. I will never do something else. My blueberries made the dough gray although I was careful, but so far so good. I put the first tray in the oven, and although I'm usually a good baker, I realized I had forgotten the oil! =/ To make it short, they turned out to be wonderful diet muffins, really! Healthy and yummy, just a tiny little bit hard. For the next tray, I added oil and they were deliciouuuus! Best blueberry muffins ever! =)

I made these muffins because I had sour cream I needed to use up.  I was very pleased with outcome.  The muffins rose nicely which doesn't always happen at a mile high in Denver.  I cut the recipe in half and added a couple of tablespoons more sugar, since I like my muffins on the sweet side.  Otherwise, I made the recipe as it was written.  These muffins will fill you up.  I will make these again the next time I have sour cream I need to use up.

I found the recipe very easy to follow and loved the texture of the muffin. I will be making these again for sure.  Next time I will use fat-free sour cream, a little less oil and 1/2c more blueberries and 1/2c more sugar.

This is the best blueberry muffin recipe I have ever made.  I made it exactly like the recipe shown here and they came out with a nice high crown and very good texture, not to mention they tasted so very good.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Great starter recipe. I used 50/50 sugar combo like some of the other viewers also added orange extract and some grated orange zest. I also added a crumb topping. I will make these again.

This recipe is very good.  I did use one cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar.  The muffin is not too sweet and has great flavor.  I think you could just use this batter as a base and add whatever you like to it.

Oh my goodness, these were great! Slight modifications per other reviewers, I added 3 cups of fresh blueberries along with 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar.  These were out of this world.

These had a nice flavor.  I halved the recipe to make 12 very large muffins.  I increased the sugar by a 1/4 cup (a combo of white & brown sugar).  I also substituted an equal amount of unsweetened applesauce for the oil and used lowfat sour cream - no need for the full fat ingredients here.

Wow,wow,wow! My husband came home saying "how many muffins did you make".  And then after he tasted them he was saying that he didn't think that 24 were enough.  Thank you for this awesome recipe.

These were just wonderful!  I topped them with cinnamon sugar and they turned out great.  They are very moist, and the texture is perfect.  If I had a complaint, it would be that my blueberries tended to drop to the bottom of the muffin.  I'd rather them be suspended in the batter.  I might need to cut back a bit on the wet ingredients next time I make this recipe.

Not difficult to make, and pretty tasty. Makes a lot more than 24 muffins, if you just make regular sized muffins. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good, 
All I had was frozen raspberries & blueberries, so I reduced the oil to about 2TBS to make up for the liquid in the muffins, the mixture was quick thick going into the muffin tins as the fruit was still frozen, but the muffins came out perfecto!

Moist and very soft and fluffy. I lessened the sugar, so it was 1/3 cup of sugar per 1 cup of flour. (I also replaced some of the white flour with whole wheat, good results.) Also added some baking powder- I like fluffy muffins. =) (for original recipe, added 2 tsp baking powder)

If I rated these last night when the muffins were warm and fresh, I would have said 4 stars. But 12 hours later, they were rubbery and flour-tasting. They were not any moister than regular milk muffins so I will not use sour cream anymore. Thanks for sharing anyway, win some and lose some.

I thought these muffins were pretty good. They seemed just a tad bland but maybe it was something i did. I thought the texture was the perfect texture for a muffin, which I attribute to the extra step of rotating the sour cream and dry ingredients-an essential step for true bakers who know the importance of doing so. I did use an additional half a cup of blueberries just so that I wouldn't have to throw out what I had left over. I will make them again using different fruits and berries and spices. Can't wait!

These are seriously the best muffins ever! I'm not a fan of blueberries but I tried these because the husband loves them. There are no words.. they are soft, moist just perfect. Follow the recipe pretty much to a t.. you won't be dissapointed.

These really are the best.  I did make some changes after the first time I made them.  I changed it to 3 cups of sugar and added 1 tsp of lemon flavor.  It doesn't change the flavor too much, but adds something extra.  It's wonderful!

My own personal classification for blueberry muffins falls into two categories. Those that have a biscuity (?) type flavor and those that are cake-like.  I am not claiming those are real categories. I was looking for a more cake like and this is one that is more plain like. My son loves these. I thought they were ok, but not because there was anything wrong with them. This just was not what I was looking for. 
The only change that I made was using frozen blueberries instead of fresh. I was kind of glad that I did because I think they held better then the fresh would have.

I wasn't that impressed with this recipe.  The muffins came out rather dry and a little dense for my liking.  I also took other readers suggestions and added more sugar and they still were not that great.

This is an absolutely delicious blueberry muffin recipe that I've made several times.  I did make a few small changes to suit my taste.  I added 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil to cut back on fat and calories (when making 12 dz muffins).  I also added 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the flour and 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg to spice up the dough just a little.  Then I mixed 1/2 tsp cinnamon (yeah, i completely dig cinnamon) with 1 1/2 Tablespoon of sugar and sprinkled over muffins before baking.  Yuuuummmmm!!  Thanks to the author for a keeper recipe!!

These taste like shortbread cookies! Very sweet and great texture.  ALso goes great with white chocolate chips and macadamian nuts instead of the berries.

Good basic recipe. I used the suggestion another reviewer listed and used half brown sugar, half white, and increased the sugar by 1/2 a cup. I would also suggest using a streusel topping of some sort. This recipe is definitely worth giving it a try.

This is my new favorite muffin recipe.  I made the mix exactly as written except I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh and fat free sour cream; I really couldn't tell the difference.  I halved the recipe for a dozen muffins and they came out great!  Moist and with excellent flavor.  I'm so making this one again!

these were excellent, except mine didn't look like the picture.  They were still great.  I used frozen blueberries..I read somewhere not to thaw them out, but I also saw where I should have, so I didn't really know what to do so I left them frozen.  It came out fine. Hubby and everyone at worked loved them.  I got about 33 large muffins from this mix.

I was really looking forward to these muffins, and they were FABULOUS just out of the oven, but by the next morning they were sticky and greasy! I sent them with my boyfriend to his work and I'm a little embarrassed now. The only thing I changed was to use slightly less oil and to cook several minutes longer than called for. I would recommend reducing the oil for sure. Maybe I'm just used to a lighter muffin, but I thought these were just too greasy. Sorry.

These muffins are good but nothing special.  I didn't think they were worth the added calories of the sour cream. I will stick with a more basic blueberry muffin.

Wonderful!! Everyone raves when I make these! I swap out one cup of white flour with one cup of whole wheat, and I add a few tablespoons of ground flax seed, just to make it a little healthier. Comes out perfect every time!! I sprinkle some demerara sugar on top to finish them off beautifully.

OMG I couldn't believe the muffins would be this good.  I've baked them 3 days ago and they're still as soft as if I baked them today.  From now on this will be my standard b'berry muffin recipe.  I exactly followed the recipe except substituted half of the flour with whole wheat as me and hubby are trying to cut on carbs.  Baking time took 20 minutes and they were just perfect.  And today I'm again going to make another fresh batch as I've to use my farmer's market blueberries:) Thanks a lot KK3 to share this wonderful recipe with us.

These are probably the best muffins I've ever made. I too added some lemon zest and juice from one lemon. A few more blueberries might have found their way in as well.

These are fantastic!!  I used 50/50 white/light brown sugar.  I thawed an entire bag of frozen blueberries before mixing them in.  They turned out great. Two of my co-workers said it was the best blueberry muffin they'd ever had!

Great recipe! Very moist and light! Definately a great change from boring muffins. I used wild blueberries that grow on our mnt. so it gave a wonderful tartness to match the sweet :)

These muffins are excellent!  I used half white whole wheat and half white flour, and added some chopped fresh peach in addition to the blueberries.  Absolutely delicious and moist.  There are so many muffin recipes that are so-so.  These are great!

If I would have had 4 eggs has called for I would have given this 5 stars!  Yes this a heavy recipe, some are, but it's oh so good.   This makes 24 very nice size muffins.  It's perfect, not too sweet and not too tart.  I did substitute 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar for the 2 cups sugar.  Perfect recipe!

These muffins are heavenly! I added blueberry yoghurt instead of sour cream (healthier option) so they looked very purple but tasted fab! I put the recommended streusel on top, brilliant! Will be making these again!

These look beautiful so presentation is a 5.  Taste is just average for me.  They got better as they sat on my counter, but still were not what I was hoping for.  I subbed half brown sugar as other reviewer suggested, but wish that I had not.  I think I would have preferred all white sugar.  Not bad, but not perfect.

These were very yummy! I added cinnamon and ginger and used half white sugar and half light brown sugar. The were scrumptous, even my picky toddler liked them (but still didn't eat it). i plan on trying someone's suggestion of apple sauce instead of oil, and gonna try half sour cream and half yogurt.

I made this tonight and it was so easy.  I took the advice of others and added a little nutmeg and cinnamon.  I was out of sour cream so I used plain yogurt.  I also used dried blueberries since I didn't have fresh.  Came out like a pro.

This recipe was just ok - I have found better out there.  I even tried the other suggestions and added cinnamon and nutmeg, also used 3/4C sugar & 3/4C brown sugar.  Just wasn't worth the berries.  One note - it does taste better the next day and while it is cold.  Warm from the oven was bland!

I made these this morning because I had some blueberries for a few months that I had to use up. I followed the recipe with the exception of a teaspoon of lemon flavoring. They baked up really nicely. Next time I will do a streusel or cream cheese glaze to give them that extra special touch!

I was really disappointed in this recipe.  For as much sugar as this recipe calls for, I was surprised that the muffins weren't sweeter.  I'm going looking for a good blueberry muffin recipe.

Good, but not great.Personally, I don't think the sour cream really changed the flavor of a typical muffin, but it's probably what saved my batch by keeping it somewhat moist. I cooked for 20 minutes & they were way overdone. Next time I'll try 15 minutes.

I'd never had blueberry muffins with sour cream before - but I'm glad I did.  The sour cream really does add a little extra something.  Very creamy - very good.

This is a beautiful and tasty muffin. I used more blueberries, and DON'T overcook. 15 minutes was enough in my oven. Because of the sour cream, it becomes very stiff you let them get too brown.

Delicious recipe, although mine did not turn out very attractive.  Rave reviews from everyone at my holiday brunch...

awesome muffins! I used plain yogurt instead of the sour cream and frozen blueberries and it was the first time i'd made blueberry muffins and they came out great

These are good, but a little disappointing...only from the standpoint that the sour cream didn't seem like it added much to the muffins.  I guess maybe I was hoping the flavor would come through a bit more.  I cut the recipe in half, but still came out with 18 muffins using a regular-sized muffin tin.  I also changed the recipe slightly by adding a little extra vanilla, somewhere between 1/2 tsp and 1 tsp of cinnamon, an extra 1/2 cup or so of blueberries, and I substituted 1/4 cup of the white sugar for light brown sugar.  I also sprinkled each muffin with a very small amount of brown sugar and white sugar before baking.  Overall...tastey, but not the best blueberry muffin I've ever tasted.

These are very good--not the best, but good.  I halved the recipe and made 6 jumbo muffins.  Used half white and half brown sugar, but I wish I would have added a little cinnamon like some suggested.  I also tossed the blueberries in flour before adding to the mixture.  The baked up well, and the tops had a really pretty and tasty crust--even without sugar or streusal!

This recipe is good, but it's a little more cumbersome than other blueberry muffin recipes, and it didn't pay off w/ an exceptional muffin.  They aren't bad, but they are not as good as I was expecting them to be.  I may make them again increasing the amount of sugar.  Thank you for the recipe.

I didn't have enough sour cream so I put 2/3 cup sour cream and 1/3 cup cream cheese in the recipe for 12 muffins and it was great.

This recipe is a keeper.  I subbed half the flour for whole wheat and used light sour cream.  Used a bit more blueberries then called for and also added pinch of cinnamon, dash of lemon juice, and sprinkled sugar on top before baking.  Texture came out perfect!
With the cinnamon addition, I think this would be a great recipe for peach muffins.

These are really good.  They stay moist and don't crumble.  I add just a little bit of brown sugar before baking to the tops of them.  Adds just enough sweetness.

So glad I found this recipe!  I had flour sugar, blueberries, but no milk.  Then lo and behold, this recipe used sour cream instead!  I have sour cream!!  And they actually turned out pretty nice.  Especially delightful considering I'd never made muffins before.  :)

These were nice.  I added the sour cream to the "wet" ingredients, and always add the wet to the dry, not the other way around.  Lastly, I added a bit of orange zest and made sure to leave the batter nice and lumpy.  Muffins came out with a beautiful consistency and nice flavor, but could still use a bit more "umph".  I will make these again, with some added flavors.  Oh, and I made mine with raspberries, not blueberries. Very good!

WOW...I've made quite a few muffin recipes from this site and this was certainly the best thus far!  I made a few healthy substitutions (splenda sugar, fat-free sour cream, 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, and applesause instead of the oil) and it still turned out very tasty.  It truly brings out the flavor of the blueberries, especially since I added an additional 3/4 cup of them!

These were OK...nothing special.  I think I was spoiled because after using the To Die For Blueberry Muffins on this site, I am doubtful that anything will compare.  These were good and moist...just not as good as others I have made.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Delicious and so moist!  I hate muffins that are dry and can't last more than a day out of the freezer.  The sour cream really does make the difference.  I didn't alter the recipe a bit.  Highly recommended!  Oh-- and if you use regular size muffin tins instead of super size ones, expect more like 36 muffins out of this batter.

This recipe gets a big thumbs up from my family.  I have tried it as it stands and also changing the sour cream for creme fraiche( a lower fat option).  Both turned out well but our favourite was the creme fraiche so I would go with that one next time.A lovely muffin recipe though.

I really loved these muffins. They are dense and vary tasty. Probably the best homemade muffin I have ever tasted. However, I would suggest using med size mufffin pans, I used a jumbo muffin pan and found because the muffin was so rich and filling I could not eat the entire muffin in one sitting!

Great texture--melt in your mouth inside but crusty on the outside. Too sweet though.  I tried it with streusel on top but I think I'd prefer it without.  I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, just because that's what I had on hand.

This recipe was DELICIOUS bite after bite.  The directions were easy to follow and the muffins cooked up into a beautiful muffin top without the spillage onto the muffin tray.  The muffins are not too sweet and yet very moist.  I will be making these again!

WONDERFUL muffins!  I have been looking for the perfect blueberry muffin recipe and this is it!  These are light and very moist.  PERFECT sweetness-they are not overly sweet but have a more subtle sweetness which allows you to enjoy the taste of the berries (this from someone with a raging sweet tooth!).  I have tried other blueberry muffin recipes and some of them were sticky sweet and some tasted like there was no sugar in them at all.  The tops have a nice, light crunch to them.  I just made them and have already inhaled two.  I didn't alter any ingredients and got 30 muffins.  Thanks Kim!

These are the best blueberry muffins around. My one complaint is that the texture is not so great the next day - eat these right out of the oven.

I couldn't wait to try these, mostly because of the wonderful picture illustrating the recipe. I added a dash of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg and though the muffins looked good something was still lacking from the taste. But they were very moist and got eaten in a day so I guess while not the best in my opinion, certainly worth trying.

I didn't like the texture of the crumb.  I added lemon zest, more vanilla, extra dried blueberries, half and half white/brown sugar.  Good taste; however, it's not the best muffins I have experienced.  I'll keep searching for that awesome muffin recipe! ***Update:  "To Die For Blueberry Muffins" is the one!

Fantastic Muffins!  I doubled the blueberries and the muffins were oversized. The family gobbled then up for brunch.

These muffins tasted good, but they're not the best I've ever had. I followed the directions as is. Although they were very moist and turned out well, they didn't look at all like the picture, and the didn't make me go WOW. But as a basic blueberry muffin recipe, it was fine. Thanks, Kim!

I get a great deal of my recipes from this site, and generally select only the highest rated ones because they usually turn out to be keepers, but this recipe is not one of my favorites. The muffins are bland, and that could be because I used frozen berries, but I think the  batter needed more sugar. These aren't awful, just not great. Thanks for the recipe Kim!

I also added frozen blueberries (didnt measure it out) and my batter turned purple! They didn't turn out purple though.
I will def. be making these again and experimenting with different addins :)

The first time I made these, I ran out of regular flour and had to use 1 1/2 cups of wheat flour to make up the difference. It turned out fabulous! It's even better when you use all purpose flour all the way. Used light sour cream and couldn't tell the difference. These are by far the best blueberry muffins I've ever made.

I should have taken the other suggestions for adding more flavor.  Although they were very moist, not a lot of flavor.  I did add more blueberries. I put a streusel topping on half of them. Put almonds in the streusel  so that gave them better flavor.  Very cakelike instead of crumbly like muffins usually are.

These are delicious muffins and I get rave reviews for them, however, the recipe as listed is a bit lacking in punch - I add some cinnamon and nutmeg, and sprinkle brown sugar on the tops of the muffins.

Thanks for the recipe, Kim!

this is the first time I ever made muffins and it was perfect! I did only half the recipe and used 1/4 C wholemeal flour to make it healthier. Used brown sugar too...it was certainly moist and yummy!

I think this recipe has potential and so I will try it again sometime. 400 degrees is way too hot a temperature setting to bake these at (at least for my oven).

These muffins were good, but  i didnt think they were sweet enough so i made a cream cheese topping from cream cheese and powdered sugar. I left half of them unfrosted for breakfast, and frosted the other half for desert.

Amazingly moist. I don't see how others didn't enjoy these. The muffin mix I buy at the store always end up somewhat dry. These were wonderful. Only thing I didn't like were the blueberries I bought. Make sure that you buy blueberries that are small. The larger the blueberries the less sweet they are. I thought the addition of sour cream was strange but it definitely did make them so moist. They aren't kidding when they say this makes 24! Thank you so much!

This is an easy recipe to throw together. I've made these twice, once with butterscotch chips and once with blueberries.  They have to be the best looking muffins I've ever made. They rise really well and look delicious. But as far as taste, I've had better, these aren't bad though. I found them to be a little dry, which is surprising because they should be anything but with the sour cream.

Made mini-muffins, increased the vanilla and blueberries, decreased the sugar ever so slightly and everyone liked 'em.  But nobody asked for the recipe so am giving this a "4".

Very good muffins. I halved the recipe and used only 1/4 cup oil rather than 1/2 cup because of comments in reviews about the muffins being greasy.  I also used low-fat sour cream.

This is a wonderful recipe. You can bake little loaves in mason jars using the instructions from "Banana Nut Bread Baked in a Jar" from this site. Around the holidays I bake a batch of each of these two recipes and a batch of "Chocolate Chip Pumpkin Bread" from this site.  A pretty basket with a jar of each bread makes a fabulous holiday gift. They stay fresh in the jars for weeks! Thanks Kim for taking the time to post the recipe.

Delicious, better than store bought.  The only thing I changed was I used 1 Cup (2 Sticks) Imperial Light Margarine instead of Vegetable Oil.  It made 33 Muffins.

These are the best blueberry muffins I've ever had...added an extra 1/2 cup sugar...also baked them in giant muffin tins...baked for about 30 minutes and they came out perfect.

These are absolutely the best!!  The taste is wonderful and they are just sweet enough.  My family could not get enough of these.  Will be making again very soon.  I would not change a thing.  Thanks Kim

Good recipe.  My husband and toddler liked them. I scaled down to make 12 muffins, used wild blackberries that my son and I had picked up instead of blueberries, and they turned big, moist and great. I used a little more berries than the recipe called for.

I have to agree with other reviews - these are lacking in flavor.  I added 1/4 tsp. ground cloves plus doubled the vanilla and added 1/4 tsp baking powder.  The cloves helped but I will continue searching for something better.  My muffins came out small and dense, not fluffy as some experienced.

These were pretty good but I think I'll keep looking for that blow-me-away recipe.  The batter seemed really thick, but they do puff up really nicely.  They are very moist and I used fresh berries in addition to adding white chocolate chips.

Add nutmeg to this recipe (or any recipe using blueberries).  What a difference!
I also added baking powder and more vanilla extract.

Excellent, nicely puffed and browned.  I used mixed frozen berries instead, and muffins were fine.

These muffins were okay, but I didn't think they were excellent.  They were fairly heavy.  They tasted better cold, the day after than they did fresh.

WOW!! this was such a good recipe.  batter seemed a little thick but they rose and were very moist and last 5 minutes of cook time covered with foil so they would not overbrown.  i made them for a breakfast to take to a friends house and her hubby ate 3 in one sitting she had to stop him!!  i love this recipe and will try making with other berries as well.  thank you KIM for a great recipe =)

very moist muffins just like  i want them,  I didn´t have any sour cream so I used blueberry flavoured yogurt.
I just stirred all the liquid ingrediens together,  mixed the dry ones and  gently but qickly folded everything together, the muffins  where done in excatly 20 minutes and came out high and moist. A good recipe that can be varied in many ways. It will become my standard muffin recipe!!

Excellent Recipe.  Very moist.  I scaled it to make only 6 muffins.  I put them in an airtight bowl with lid right after I made them to preserve the moistness. This is by far my favorite muffin recipe.

These were the best blueberry muffins I have ever made.  The recipe makes very large muffins, so it did take the full 20 minutes and a bit to bake them thoroughly.  I also sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on the tops just before baking.  I love butter on muffins but really did not need it for these.  They were light, fluffy and moist.  Yummy.  Thanks for the recipe Kim:)

These were great! But I baked them at 375* for 20 minutes and they were nice and moist. I also added about 1/2 cup more blueberries because my family loves the extra berry taste.

EXCELLENT RECIPE!  By far one of the best I've gotten here.  These muffins are so yummy!  Even my *very* picky 3-year-old ate them up.  I would take a tip from another reviewer and add a crumb topping next time--just to make them even better!  Thanks for sharing!

These are simply the best blueberry muffins out there to be made.  I used some crumb mixture to put on top before baking and they were just to die for!  What a terrific recipe, thanks for sharing it with us, Kim!!!!!

These were great muffins.  The texture and moistness turned out perfect.  Next time I may add a little more sugar since I like to eat muffins without butter.  I will definately make these again.

Not my idea of a muffin. Too dense and bland. Sorry.

I only filled the muffin cups 1/2 full.  Next time I will fill 3/4th since they did not rise to the top.  I didn't find the muffins to be very sweet, but very good overall

Good muffin recipe--but I needed to bake them slightly longer than the recipe stated.
Will definately keep this one!

Sprinkling the tops of each with a little white sugar before baking adds a tease for your taste buds.  Had raved review and requests for a repeat performance for these muffins.  Recipe made 10 giant muffins.

These are the best muffins I have ever tasted!  They are moist like you get from the bakery.  I am very picky about the recipes I try because my family is so picky about food.  This went into my recipe file and will be the only berry muffin recipe I use from now on!  Everyone loved them!  The muffins are great for the next few days also.  I just put mine into a ziplock bag and refrigerated them.
