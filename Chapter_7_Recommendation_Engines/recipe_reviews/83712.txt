This was VERY good!  I pan fried it in a deep skillet, 5 minutes per side, and it came out perfectly.  I was worried the larger pieces of pretzel wouldn't stay on, but they did.  The coating was wonderfully crunchy.  Will make again!

Followed the recipe, except used talapia instead of cod & boy where these good!  Thought the seasoning was perfect.  Was worried that they may fry too long because they got fairly dark, but, came out nice and crunchy & perfect--not dry.  I don't know if it makes a huge difference but, after I egg/coated the fish, I let them rest for about 5-10min. before frying--I just think they set up better.  Served w/ tarter sauce.

This was a great way to coat fish!! It turned out great!  All I had to do was tell my kids that it had pretzels on it and they were all for it!  I added a bit more seasoning and ended up crushing a little more than I had initially.  I thought that it was super!

I really liked the coating, but I will add some Old Bay for a little more flavor next time.  I fried the fish in EVOO to make it a little healthier.

My new favorite fish!  I cooked some fresh water bass.  I also added a little garlic powder and seasoned salt to the flour.  I mixed olive oil and corn oil for cooking. Great recipe!

This was good.  I changed the recipe, but not on purpose.  I didn't realize until i started cooking that i didn't have enough pretzels!  I made up the differnce with some herbed stuffing mix.  Pan fried them in just a little bit of oil and was very surprised how tasty they came out.  My 5 yr old thought i bought them from the store because they tasted like our favorite brand of frozen fish sticks! DH, the fried fish snob, complimented me on how crunchy they were even after they were reheated.  Great recipe. Will make again.

Great base - but there was just something missing...

I'll definitely try it again sometime - but will probably just stick to using Fish Crisp until I figure this one out ;)

Made this for Good Friday dinner with mushy green peas and homemade "chips". Used Talipia instead of Cod, but followed the batter recipe exactly. Used the blender to crush the pretzels. The whole family loved it!!! I am not a fish fan, and I ate two pieces! Great with ketchup. Heated up good the next day too!

This was really good! The only thing I would change is to add a bit more salt.
I bet this would be great with seasoned chicken breasts as well.

This was pretty good and it was easy to do.  Next time I would add something to add some flavor, instead of just salt and pepper.

Tasty with a capital T.  I don't own a deep-fryer so I heated up an inch or so of peanut oil in a stock pot and fried both sides until the outer coating was golden brown and crispy...then baked in the oven at 425 for about 10 minutes.  I used the checkerboard type pretzels, hypothesizing that the increased surface area would yield a greater ratio of outer brown pretzely bits to inner white pretzely bits.  In any event, the finished product was met with hearty acclaim...so it's going in the regular rotation.

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! I USED TILAPIA INSTEAD, AND A TEASPOON OF PEPPER INSTEAD OF HALF, AND ADDED SOME CREOLE SEASONING ABOUT A TABLE SPOON WORTH WITH THE FLOUR MIX. I FRIED IT IN A SKILLET WITH SAFFLOWER OIL. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST FISH I'VE EVER EATEN!! I WILL BE MAKING THIS FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE! IT TASTED MORE LIKE CHICKEN THAN FISH AND STUFFING WAS A WONDERFUL COMPLIMENT! AND A FEW FRESH CHERRY TOMATOES!!

Delicious. 3/4 cup flour and two eggs is enough for two pounds of fish.
I pan fried and served with lemon, tartar sauce, crinkle cut fries and asparagus.

I thought i had pretzels, but we were out, so i used smashed-up triscuits.  It was pretty awesome!  Also, I put some penzy's seasoning into the flour mix.

Although you fry this fish, it DOES NOT taste greasy.  Simply delicious.  I'm going to try this coating on pork tenderloins too.

OMG this was delicous! I used Tilapia fillets and double dipped the fish in the pretzels for extra crunch. My husband who detest pretzels and all three of my picky kids(even the six year old who doesn't usually eat any meat) went back for seconds. Next time I'm going to try baking them to cut back on the fat. Definately in the meal rotation at this house now.

Best fried fish I've had.  I would suggest adding some additional seasoining to the mix.
I completely skipped (not purposely - just forgot) the first step (flour) and the fish was still sooo tasty and crunchy.  
I highly suggest using the Tartar Sauce I recipe from this site as well.  
Was just as good the next day reheated and made into sandwiches!

This was a very interesting take on fish.  My daughter and I enjoyed it but hubbie thought it was too salty.  I will crush the pretzel finer next time and maybe choose a pretzel with less salt.  It was fun to make. Thanks for the recipe.

It's actually not bad. It reminded me of homemade fishsticks. The pretzels and the fish went well together believe it or not. If you're looking for a new way to have fish, try this for a change of pace. :) You might be surprised, like I was!

Once again, I have found a new and wonderful recipe from this website. My husband raved about this dish- it was surprisingly delicious. It's different- I had never prepared fish in this fashion before but the pretzels add a nice texture and crunch. I will definitely make this again.

We really liked this recipe. I used my deep fryer and not even the biggest cuts took 10 mins to cook at 350, but that was perfect for me. I didn't have enough cod on hand for everyone, so I used some tilapia that I had also. It worked well for both kinds of fish. But, once again, keep an eye on it! Most of my pieces took 5 to 7 mins.

I followed the recipe using thawed cod. And again using thawed tilapia.  I baked in the oven at 425 for 20 minutes. Everyone really liked the pretzel crust.

The whole family loved the recipe. I read the reviews and used a few tips. I did add some Old Bay to the flour mixture and it was a nice addition. We also used chipotle mayo instead of tartar sauce. My daughter liked it plain. Hubby and I liked it with. I also used egg substitute instead of the 2 eggs simply because I had run out of eggs and forgot to get them at the store. It worked perfectly. The crispiness of the fish was the absolute winner. We will definitely do it again. YUMMY!

Wow! This was very good! May make it a bit spicier next time for personal preference but we loved it as written too!

I am giving tis a four star only because the picky eater in my household did not care for the pretzel coating.  I liked it and will make it again when the picky ones are not here.

This is a great recipe.  I had picked up some frozen whiting fish fillets at Wal-Mart but didn't know what to do with them, especially because they smelled very strong and my husband is not crazy about fish.  I tried them with this pretzel coating and we both love them.  We've had them several times now.  We always eat them with some cocktail dip (the kind you'd serve with shrimp.)  My only complaint is that this recipe is kind of messy, but most recipes that call for some kind of breading are.

EXCELLENT!!! I also used talapia, sure it would work for any white fish. Only change was I used fish fry instead of flour. Served with thousand island dressing, for dipping & a side of garlic carrots! Will make again!

Coated striped bass with this, and it created a nice crunchy shell. Next time I will definitely add more seasonings, but this was a great alternative to traditional breadcrumbs. Will definitely do instead of breadcrumbs from now on.

I was good.  I will add more seasoning next time....  Didn't have enough flavor for my taste, but loved the pretzel crunch.

I put my pretzels in a blender to make them fine and let the fish rest for a little while before frying.  The coating stayed on well.  I was surprised the pretzels didn't flavor them more than they did.  I pan fried in peanut oil, but they might be better in bacon grease.  All in all this was a good coating.

I did not deep fry. In fact I used very little oil at all. It was Heather Bullard Turner's review and others that made it clear you do not need to drown this in fat. There needs to be some almost flour bits but even the large pieces stick like glue. Be patient and cook at lower heat. The fish was tender and not dry. The pretzel taste was not overwhelming -- but the appeal to kids of all ages makes up for it! My 88 year old Mom loved it.

Delicious recipe. Kids loved making it and eating it. Used frozen fillets. Cut them in half down the middle. Wanted more pretzel per piece. Definitely having this again.

I loved this recipe! I used grouper instead of cod. I added dijon mustard as a dip. My family went crazy! This will definitely be added to my arsenal.

Hubby made this a while ago and I'm finally getting around to reviewing it.  He didn't use cod since we had a bunch of tilapia at the house, but it was amazing.  We don't fry to much at home, but we will be making this a staple.

This is an awesome recipe!  My husband LOVES it!  I add some garlic powder, and old bay to the pretzels but next time will add it to the flour.  My 3 year old loves it too!  This is now a staple in my house!
