This is NOT a 1 hour recipe!  I put the ribs in at 4:45, thinking that they would be ready at 6 - they were not!  At 7:30 my husband ate them and said that they were good.  But they were nowhere near 'falling off of the bone.'  I cooked them for another 2 hours before they were "falling off of the bone."  And to me, they were bland.  But it certainly kept the house warm on our first of many cooler days.

These were incredibly easy to make, compared to other recipes with huge ingredient lists. I'd never made spareribs before. Also, I liked that you are not instructed to cut them apart, which seemed simpler. I actually did not get to try these, but my husband, sister and kids loved them. I was surprised. I'll have to try them again and see what all the fuss was about :)
I do think next time I'll broil them a few minutes at the end with one last layer of chili sauce-I didn't do that, and they looked pretty blah. Letting the chili sauce stick would be more visually appealing.

This was delish except the time frame was way off.  It took over an hour longer than stated.  However, having cooked ribs I anticipated this.  My only dislike.  Other than that, delish!!!

Knowing that the cook time is off after reading the reviews I went ahead and cooked as stated then finished them off on the barbecue. Nice little charred edges of the pork ribs slathered in the sweet chili sauce made for some down right good ribs.

The ribs do not get done even after cooking for 2 hours.
