I wish people would just rate the actual recipe instead of changing it to a totally different recipe and then rating it.  Make it according to ingredients then state what you would like to change

I used this recipe as a guide since I had a pork loin roast. I tend to avoid putting boneless pork chops & chicken breasts in the slow cooker because in my experience they seem to break down too quickly. I wanted to use some apple to cut the sourness of the kraut, but not too much, and definitely not too much liquid, because the kraut, onions, apple & meat also release much juice as they cook. Based on the many comments from 4 similar recipes on this site I incorporated the following: I seasoned a 4 pound boneless pork loin roast (with Stubb’s all- natural pork spice rub, black pepper, garlic powder & a little salt) & seared all sides on the stove in a little oil. Transferred the meat to the slow cooker with the fat side up (do not add the oil—it gets a burnt flavor with high smoke point searing) & added 1 large jar of all natural sauerkraut with juice, 3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar, 2 bay leaves,  a sprinkling of caraway seeds, 10 whole juniper berries & 2 teaspoons dark brown sugar.  I then topped with 1/2 of a very large granny smith apple (peeled and sliced), 1 medium red onion (sliced) and 2 tablespoons butter (cut into chunks). Cooked for 6 hours at 250 degrees and it was so tender, juicy and flavorful & the kraut/onions tasted great. You can’t taste the apple at all & the small amount of apple, brown sugar & butter cuts the sourness of the kraut juice. Served it with mashed potatoes. My husband said he thought he'd died and gone to heaven, lol, it was that good! :)

Because there is just two of us I had to cut the recipe in half.  I also used caraway seeds instead of the fennel.  I also left the skins on the apples and I can't believe how this tasted.  If you are afraid of the taste of sauerkraut, don't be; it was great.  Lots of juice left so we scooped out the meat and veggies with a slotted spoon.

I was concerned that this might turn out bland, so I used a combination of beef broth and beer in place of the water.  I used caraway seeds which the recipe author says could be substituted for fennel (I typically only use fennel seed in Italian dishes).  First, I wouldn’t add “water to cover” because I ended up with way too much liquid at the end.  The pork chops ended up being very tender and moist, but the apples pretty much cooked to mush, and the sauerkraut just didn’t have much flavor.  Overall, this meal was OK, but a bit bland.  My friend’s sauerkraut recipe calls for juniper berries, whole cloves, and a bay leaf which bring incredible flavor to the kraut, and I’ll never again make sauerkraut without them.  As suggested, I did serve this with mashed potatoes on the side .

I used a combination of "fancy cut" and chopped sauerkraut. Also, as I was only making 3 chops I had to adjust the recipe accordingly. However, the chops turned out so tender the meat was practically falling off the bone :) I used 1 honeycrisp and 1 gala apple and that did a good job of cutting down on the acidity of the sauerkraut. However, next time I think I'm going to use more fennel and use 3 apples for 3 chops instead of two.

Loved it! The pork chops were so tender and the apples were a good contrast to the sauerkraut.

I made the recipe exactly as it was written, using Granny Smith for the sour apples. It was in the slow cooker for 6 hours on low and I made garlicky mashed potatoes to accompany it. 
Although I loved the pork chops (they came out so juicy and tender), no one enjoyed the sauerkraut,  onions and apples. The apples and onions were still crisp, even after the standard time in the slow cooker and the sauerkraut was somewhat bitter and acidic.
I will definitely make my own adjustments to this recipe and try it again. The idea was great, it just needs help. Next time I will cook the onions until translucent and soften the apples before putting them in the bottom of the cooker. 
I also thought that adding some apple juice as the fluid and some garlic cloves for flavor would be really good! The sauerkraut needs something sweet like apple juice to neutralise it. 
Also juniper berries and a bay leaf wouldn't go amiss! Thanks for the recipe idea though!

loved it! the most tender pork chop I've ever made. I only had two pork chops so I just cut down on the other ingredients and it turned out great.

I didn’t have a second crockpot so I actually made this in the oven. 300 degrees for 2 1/2 hrs. After an 1:15 I mixed in the sauerkraut and fennel, then recovered & finished baking (& same temp). Was moist and sooooo tender. Mixed together with the Spicy Black-eye peas it was a phenomenal New Years Day meal!!

Did not like how this turned out at all. The pork chops were dry and flavorless and the saurkraut mixture just turned out weird. Wouldn't make again!

Very easy to make.  I used Granny Smith apples instead of Opals and caraway seeds.  Reminds me of my mother's pork chops and sauerkraut.

So good, so easy to make! I added brown sugar. I had the crockpot on for 3 hours on low, added 2 lbs of sauerkraut and turned up to high for one more hour. The directions say 6 hours on low, I think that would have been too long, it would have made the pork dry. I also made applesauce as a side dish, I ended up putting it on top of the pork and oh WOW! It was really better than I expected, especially considering I am not much of a pork fan. We made it for our New Year's Day meal, I will definitely make it again.

If you are considering making this recipe, just move along because this recipe is a complete disaster.  I was concerned with it complete lack of seasoning in the recipe, but that wasn’t even the worst part!  The pork chop chops was so dry it was inedible.  Dry and bland is a losing combination.  Look for another recipe, because this is not it.

This was comfort food as a kid. I did cook the sauerkraut longer to pick up more flavor and used caraway rather than fennel. Yum.

Normally I love all things sauerkraut but I was very disappointed with this dish. I felt it was very bland. I can see how mashed potatoes would have made it taste better, but we chose to eat it as is with a different side dish.

Loved the apples with the pork and sauerkraut. I usually do not change anything unless I feel a need to use a different ingredient. Yes I will make this again soon! The first time I made it with canned shredded pork due to the weather on New Years in Indiana I was not able to go directly to the store. Pulled pork is my favorite but the chops are perfect!

The pork chops were wonderful, falling off the bone tender.  The apples and onions were perfectly cooked.  However, when I added the kraut the dish went awry.  The kraut, apples and onions lacked flavor.  Next time I make this I beleihe I will prepare the kraut in the traditional way separate from the chops, apples and onions, then serve them together.

Followed closely katydid's review but without the juniper berries.  I also added one cup of vegetable broth and barley along with a green pepper as a personal preference.  Turned it up to high for a few hours towards the end then back down to low.  Delish!

The pork was soft and tender. The kraut, however, was flat and acidic.
