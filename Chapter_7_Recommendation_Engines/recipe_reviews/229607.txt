I didn't use any shallots and used a balsamic reduction glaze, caprese is marvelous and the yellow tomatoes make it even prettier on the plate. Thanks!

I did not make any changes to this recipe.  Went to the farmers market for the heirloom tomatoes and the basil. Got the rest at a specialty market, went home and made it for dinner.  It was absolutely delicious.  Will make this again and again.

This was really good. I had a caprese salad at a local restaurant and loved it so I was excited to try this. The restaurant used sun dried tomatoes so i may try that next time to change it up a little. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made in summer.  Yummy! but when I make it...I slice red onion
very thin and put it between tomato and cheese.  It is so good this way. I make sure the red onion is sliced very, very thin.

This is a beautiful presentation! I love the addition of shallots. Brilliant combo. Caprese salad upgrade! I will try it with balsamic/honey reduction next time. Thank you for posting.
