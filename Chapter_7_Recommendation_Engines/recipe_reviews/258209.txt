Excellent! I had 2.5lbs of cukes to use up, and they fit just perfectly into the 2 quart jars. I've always used dill weed in my pickles, so the dill seed in this recipe was a nice change of pace and delicious! Super easy to make and tons of flavor. I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing was that this made way more brine than needed. I ended up with 14oz leftover. Next time I'll reduce the water and vinegar.  I tried the pickles after 24 hrs and they were already tasty. I'll make these again!

Great recipe, and very easy to make. I made a quart of large wedges, a smaller jar of smaller wedges, and a half quart of chips. I added onion powder and a little mustard seed, and after about an hour, decided to add just a little sugar. They turned out awesome. Will definitely be making more.

Delicious! I only had dill weed so I used that. These lasted less than a week in my house. I'll be making more soon as the recipe was quick, easy and very tasty! Thank you for the great recipe & tips!

In search of a brine for pickled that didn't taste sweet, I used this recipe and I love it!

I've been picking the cucumbers from my garden and I didn't have enough to make the 2-jar serving at the time, so I stuck with one jar. I stayed with the basic recipe but didn't half it. Instead of Dill seed, I substituted in the regular dill. I also added coriander seeds and stuffed everything into ONE jar. Super Tangy and somehow citrusy in flavor. Will do this one again once I have enough cucumbers from the garden!!

I made both spears and slices and they both came out excellently.  A little spicy since I added crushed chili pepper , came out very well.

I added a sliced small jalape√±o to each jar and it added a nice kick to the flavor!

Fabulous. Had the first taste 4 hours after putting in fridge. The next day they were even better.
