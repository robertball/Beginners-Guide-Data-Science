There is no need to strain this, the spices are good for you!  I liked this hot or cold.  Make sure to cool this so when the hot tea is poured over ice, it doesn't crack the glass if serving as an iced beverage!

I make this all the time in the cold months with fresh organic Turmeric and Ginger. I also use organic lemon wedge and raw honey. Reducing the toxins while receiving the full benefits of the tea.

I love this recipe because it's the perfect upset-tummy-head-cold-stuffy-nose-its-too-crummy-outside type tea.  You can also gauge how much of one ingredient or another you want over the times of making it.  I personally add more ginger so that it helps my throat feel good.  I also enjoy it MUCH more when its warm, it's the perfect tummy and cold remedy.  The tea is also filled with wonderful nutrients and vitamins that make your digestive tract very happy, and your body very healthy :) 

**TIPS the turmeric WILL stain anything that you use to make this!  I use a dark colored pot, and immediately wash the strainer and spoon I use when I make this.  I store it in a drink container (about 2 qt) that is meant only for this tea!

in order for your body to use the Tumeric properly you must add black pepper to the drink .An easier way to do it is to buy Tumeric tablets containing the black pepper and drink it with the tea.

A very nice soothing tea. I think i would cut back on the turmeric and cinnamon next time as i found them a bit overpowering. I used maple syrup and added an extra teaspoon to  balance the flavor.As it cools it is quite tasty and i will make this again. Thank you nascarrunner71 for the recipe.

I doubled the recipe (to have more for later), added a few peppercorns (from other recipes) crushed the ginger and boiled the whole thing with a half lemon sliced with the rind and a cinnamon stick, strained and it came out quite lovely and fragrant, similar to a "friendship tea."  Had to add a little extra honey because the lemon made it sour.  I have shared this recipe with my patients recovering from colds and other respiratory illnesses or who have aches and pains.

Love, love, love this tea!  Simple, fast, inexpensive and healing!!!  I double the ginger because I enjoy the little tingle that I feel in the back of my throat as I drink it.  It is also a reminder to me of just how healing this tea is.  I don't care for lemon in my tea so I left that out.  I also did not strain it.  I want all of that goodness inside of me!!

I made this but you need to add peppercorns for the turmeric to work as an anti-inflammatory.

This is delicious!! Especially cold. I made it as written, then decided the honey wasn't quite to my taste, so I added a scant teaspoon of artificial sweetener. Same with the lemon; I squeezed about 1/2 a lemon in it, poured the hot drink over the peels, but still added a shot of lemon juice. Made a glass last night, and am making a double batch right now.
I add another caution about the coloring power of turmeric - do NOT use a plastic glass! Also, I have a nice little Calphalon sauce pan, which was the very dark grey metal. BUT, my husband decided it must need a good cleaning, and sandblasted it down to bare metal! It's now pitted, and took on a yellow hue as well! I'll see what the dishwasher can get out, and then try boiling it with vinegar or something.
But DEFINITELY try this - you'll be very pleased with the flavor!

This recipe tastes fantastic! I made a 12 cup batch to store in the fridge. The only change I made was to add ground cardamom along with the cinnamon to give it a little more of that chai flavor that I love any time I have a ginger drink.

I really enjoyed this tea. This will be a staple in my household. I strained it a bit but my strainer was having difficulty. So I just poured it into my mug. I like the flavor and it was quick and easy to make.

Made this tonight. My husband and I both liked it. The ginger has a little to much bite for my taste so I may use less for mine but he liked it the way it is. We're trying tumeric for the health benefits and help with inflammation. I followed the recipe exactly using organic ingredients and honey. I did strain it. I don't care for the texture unstrained.

It was s very soothing. I have everything on hand except fresh ginger, so I substituted powdered. With in that, I wish I would’ve made a double batch. I will be making some more tomorrow when I buy more honey ?? I made it hot this time, but I will definitely try and iced. It’s a keeper for sure.

Used dried for fresh (3:1 fresh to dried herbs except for ginger which is 4:1, 1/8tsp ground dried). Had lemon juice already so I added a touch of that and used agave over honey. My LO liked it, too.

My husband and I enjoy this tea very much!  I add the honey to the sauce pan at the end of the cooking process and squeeze the fresh  lemon juice into a glass tumbler with ice.  Lastly, I pour the tea over the ice and sip away.

I love reading review before I make something. I learned about turmeric staining, so I was very careful and used a dark pan and a glass ball jar. I also added some peppercorn to it to work with the turmeric for anti-inflammatory purposes. I never strained it. I not only kept everything in it, I added more ginger. I love ginger. The cinnamon was yummy in it. I didn’t have any lemon, but I will next time. I added some honey in the end. I drank it all at once and used a spoon to get all of the extra ginger. This will be a staple in this house.

I couldn't taste the orange so I added a dash of orange extract and used a strainer pouring it into the glass. It is ok but at least it's a way of getting turmeric into my diet. I was unsure of this spice. Thank you

Very good. I am allergic to cinnamon so I substituted nutmeg. Not easy to strain. Clogged coffee filter. However, it is worth the effert.

I am very new to these flavors so I was not sure how this would taste. Besides the density of the liquid not being appealing,the flavor was good. I will be drinking this in the future.

I made a half-gallon pitcher of iced tea with this, using only a couple of tablespoons of fresh minced ginger. This tea is unusual, but I really got to liking it. I think it might go well with cut-up fruit in it also.

I made this with a 1/4 tsp of fine black pepper and honey.  Sure packs a punch but still is a good, hot beverage on a cold day.  I'll be drinking this anytime.

Easy to make.  The taste was OK.  It did not make you want more.  I used ginger and lemon essential oils.

Did I mess up?  I used green "tea" though no tea is listed in the ingredients.  Will try making the drink without tea and or adjusting ingredient amounts.  If no "tea"  in drink, name should be changed!

Wasn't bad but not for me, I think it was the ginger that threw it off, try it you might like it.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated. It's wonderful! So many health benefits. I originally made this tea for the health benefits. However, it has become a fave morning or evening tea.Try it. Be sure to strain it!

I love this!  I thought it might be too strong but it wasn't.  I forgot to add the honey and lemon and it was still good.

I don't like lemon, otherwise made it exactly and drank without straining.  Maybe a tich too much cinnamon,.  Next time I'll just use a cinnamon stick instead.  Maybe more ginger too?  I will definitely work on perfecting this to my taste, I really want the antiinflammatory benefits!

Taste really good and is really healthy! I put all dry spices in a homemade tea bag when cooking the tea.

I liked the health benefits but the taste was lacking for me. It put me in the mind of cider. I think I will try it again but replace the water with apple juice to give it more flavor.
