Very yummy with some alterations. I used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of chicken, and also added 8 oz of sour cream. Browned the meat with garlic powder, ground pepper and parsley. Also I grated the onions to get the juices in there as well. After browning the meat, stir in soups and sour cream, then add to baking dish. Topped that with grated cheddar, topped with taters, and then added a bit more cheese 10 mins til I was done, and topped that with french cut green beans. Turned out very good with the beans on top. The taters actually were crunchy on top, and fell apart on the bottom, and mixed with the soup.

I made this for a crowd and made a whole recipe, the general census was it was "good" but a little bland. Not sure if I missed something in the preperation or not. I still liked it alot.

It was a hit with everyone and there were no leftovers. I tweaked it up a bit using ground venison that we had on hand, American cheese and a fraction of the spinach... but it was really tastey and my picky little one ate every bite. I am thinking it will be fun to try it with different cheeses and maybe ground turkey.

We enjoyed this.  We used about 4 loosely packed cups of  fresh spinach (which we then rough chopped and didn't precook) instead of frozen and shredded mozzarella because we didn't have any swiss.  Otherwise made as written.  I would make it again, but with about 1/2 lb. to 1 lb. less beef and another cup of spinach.

Gave it 4 stars because I had to tweak it a little. Did not use spinach. Added 1 large can of french cut green beans. Used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of celery and some sour cream. No swiss- added cheddar cheese and french fried onions the last 30 min. With these changes, 5 stars!

This recipe was really a nice change. It was easy and simple to make also. I omited the mushrooms and used one can of cream of celery and one can of cream of mushroom since that is all I had in the pantry. I also left out the spinach and used cheddar instead of swiss on half of the casserole just to see which I liked better. Both sides were delicious!

This recipe is just "okay," but I used shredded Mexican mix cheese as I just couldn't imagine using Swiss. It cooked for over an hour and for the last 8 minutes I cranked up the oven to 450 in order to fully cook/brown the tater tots.  The recipe seems to be missing something, but I'm not sure what.  My husband and daughter smothered it in catsup (which says something).  The bottom of the tater tots were kind of soggy (as they sat in the meat/cheese mixture).  This is a very heavy meal.  All in all, it just didn't cut it for me.  If I could give it 3.5 stars I would, but that's about it.

This was very good. I had never had tater tot casserole before.  I compared a few recipes before setteling on this one.  I liked it because it had vegetables and no heavy sour cream.  I used half fat cream of mushroom soup and added ground beef to the mix.  I also decided to mix it all together.  It was quite good, but still heavy.  Not something I would make very often, but definetly will make again. My 2 year old also loved it. (Yeay! I got her to eat spinach!)

This wasn't bad at all! I noticed a few ppl saying it was missing something, so I added some diced green chilis to the mix and it gave it a little pop that it seemed to need.  Also added a bit of garlic powder and omitted the mushrooms (not a fan). Was a great lunch-my 4 and 2 year olds cleaned their plates!

We liked it.  Followed the recipe for the most part but, used a 16 oz. package of broccoli instead of spinach. I will make it again.

my husband and I liked this, but the kids didn't.  The spinach added an odd texture.  I might  try it again, but I will not use swiss cheese.

This is a great little recipe!  So easy and most of the things in here are stuff I normally have on hand!  What could be easier than that? 

I made this after reading the reviews and I just tweaked it to my own personal preferences and it is wonderful!  
First of all, I chose to substitute in Johnsonville ground Italian sausage for half of my ground beef.  It gave an unique blend of spices to the recipe and in my opinion really upped  the overall flavor to the dish.

I had just used up my spinach for another recipe yesterday so I chose to use green beans instead.** Either one works well and doesn't change the dish all that much either.**  Now, I love Swiss cheese with spinach, but like a mix of Cheddar and Jack with green beans(and broccoli too for that matter, which also makes a great substitute for the spinach).   I decided to mix a little bit of the cheese into the casserole as well as sprinkled on top, again, just personal preference, then I layered OreIda tater tots on top last.  Baked it in the oven for the time listed, but covered it for the first 30 minutes to keep the tots from over browning.  Removed the foil for the last 15-30 minutes (according to your oven) and it turned out golden brown.  You can't get this one wrong!

I know that making this according to the directions will yield a beautiful dish on its own, but I wanted to show how versatile this recipe is and how you could go pretty much in any direction you choose simply using the basic ingredients.  Enjoy!

I agree with those who say this recipe is a little bland and just okay.  I even added seasonsings but it just needed more.  And it makes a lot for something you're not that excited about eating again.  Maybe half it for your first time.

Quite bland.  I prepared it as per the recipe; however, while preparing the beef, I found it to be quite bland. I increased the Worcestershire to several tablespoons and did the same with seasoning blend. In addition I added 2 cloves of garlic.  The flavor improved but still on the bland side,

Made as directed except that we substituted cheddar for the Swiss. This was really bland. Maybe a good starting point, but it seems like it's missing a lot.
