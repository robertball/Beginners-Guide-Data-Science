This gives you a really bold burst of flavor.  Really flavorful and pungent.  Made with Splenda, and there was no sacrifice to the taste.  Going into my Favorites folder.  Thanks for sharing.

I wasn't planning on liking this; I don't adore Dijon. But, wow! This is really, really good. I never would have thought that red wine vinegar and mustard would go well together, but yum! My garlic cloves were really big, so I only used 2. Love it, thanks for sharing your recipe.

My family loves garlic so I thought this would be a great recipe to try!! But it was way too vinegar-y and sour! i will try this again but modify the ingredients and hopefully it will turn out

Wow - this is very good, but I have to admit as much as I love garlic, I did cut back on it a bit.  This was very easy and delicious over mixed greens!

This dressing is so good.  Not too sweet and not so tangy it makes your cheeks hurt.  You can put this together in under 5 minutes.  Very easy to adjust to your liking.

As is this would have been WAY too much garlic, and we love the stuff.  I only used one good size clove and it was perfect.  Everything else was spot on though!  Thanks!

If you're not a garlic lover you may want to try this with a little less garlic rather than "move on". I'm more of a garlic liker so I used  half the garlic and less oil and it was still quite good and quite garlicky.

This is a great dressing!  I didn't have/don't care for Dijon mustard, so I used yellow mustard and it was great (you really taste the mustard, so it's important to use a mustard you enjoy).  I don't have a garlic press, so I used whole cloves and blended the dressing in the blender.  Good stuff. THANKS for the recipe, Rachell!

Is a very good easy vinaigrette. I used only one clove of garlic, probably could have had another 1/2 clove or a small one.

so i really had to doctor this but it did turn out well.  i used only 1 clove of garlic.  i followed the recipe on everything else and then when i tasted it i really thought the vinegar was too strong.  i added a few more tablespoons of oil and a few quick dashes of water.  i made it to put over a salmon salad.  also if you are making this for more than one person and you like a lot of dressing you may want to double the recipe.  i also like that you don't have to worry about the dressing separating as it sits well because of the heaviness of the dijon.
