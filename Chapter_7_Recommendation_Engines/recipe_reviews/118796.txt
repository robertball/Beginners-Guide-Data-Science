These were great!  Even my picky 7-yr old loved them...I did make a few small changes, though.  A handful of breadcrumbs helped them hold together much better, and I added some chili powder and hot sauce before making into patties.  Will definitely make these again!

These were awesome!  I added a large handful of seasoned breadcrumbs based on previous reviews and they held together perfectly.  First vegetarian burger I have really enjoyed.  Hubby liked them too (and he is a meat eater!).  I will definitely make these again.

This was a great recipe; the burgers tasted fantastic. The only change I made was adding about half a cup of flour to the mix to make them hold together better when I cooked them because they fell apart otherwise.

These were excellent!  I doubled the recipe, added a handful of breadcrumbs, but instead of salsa, I added two chopped chipotle peppers and 4 TB of the adobo sauce.  I added sliced avocado along with the other toppings.  My 15 y/o vegetarian son said they are better than any other veggie burgers he's ever had!

This recipe needs some changes and additions. I added vegetable oil and flour to help it stick. I added garlic powder, cumin, chili powder and seasoned salt to the mixture. I topped it with guacamole and cheddar cheese.

I thought these were really good. The rice adds some firmness to the burger. I also added some crsushed whole wheat saltines, salt, pepper, chili powder, and a little chopped garlic. These were great! Thanks for sharing :-)

These were very good and easy, but I made some changes.  I added some frozen corn,  garlic powder, cumin and chili powder to the mixture before making the "patties" - which, even with bread crumbs, didn't stay together all that well - but good enough to eat!  I didn't have sour cream, so I mixed the salsa with plain yogurt and it was delicious.  Also, I didn't have buns so I used flat, Greek pita from my freezer.  I sprayed cooking spray on one side, gave it a shake of garlic, and heated it up in the pan after the patties were done.  I made my patties in the shape of half of a pita so I could make sandwiches.  One pita cut in half, patty inside, and then cut in half to make it easy to pick up.  My husband loved it.  I will definitely make it again.

We really enjoyed these.  I doubled, almost tripled the recipe, including 2 cans black and one can garbanzo beans (reduced sodium).  I formed the patties into approx. 4 oz portions and froze them on a cookie sheet; then wrapped them individually.  They cook easily right out of the freezer and hold their shape - yummy!

The flavor of these was very good, but mine wouldn't hold together very well into what I could call a burger.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for, so I don't know if other people are more tolerant of crumbling burgers, or something went wrong with mine.

these were great! I did add 3 cloves garlic, and then no bread crumbs, just saltine crackers to hold them together (I used 33 of them, yep I counted). Will definitely make again, but will double the recipe so I can freeze some! They are even better as left overs, as the flavors mesh well. These were the best I have ever had!

These were excellent.  Per other viewers suggestion, I added some breadcrumbs to the mixture and they held together just fine.  I was worried they may be bland but I was wrong...they were so good...and the sour cream mixed with salsa on top was delicious.  I will make these often.

This is a base recipe. A good one but a base none the less. There is no seasoning outside of the salsa. I did make a changes to veganize it. First I cooked the the rice in a "no beef" broth. To which I added catsup and worsteschire, and a dash of liquid smoke. When the rice was done but still hot I added a tablespoon of ground flaxseed. The egg makes too much moisture. I stirred the flax into the rice until it had bound. I also added Stacy's hamburger seasoning from this site. After all that I put in my rinsed beans. I mashed with a fork and took my time so the starch would have time to come out and create a binder. By the time I was done it was hold but I but the mixture in the fridge so they would hold up perfectly. I fried them up in the skillet and they were pretty good. Nice texture. This is a great base to play around with, especially with such inexpensive ingredients. Thanks a lot!

Great recipe!  I changed a few things as suggested by others...
Used Panko instead of bread crumbs (about 1/2 cup) 
Also used a quinoa and brown rice combo instead of just brown rice.  
We added adobo and finely chopped chipotle peppers (2) as well as 2 cloves of fresh garlic.  
They turned out great, so great in fact that we used the leftovers to make Black bean egg whites benedict the next morning and made burritos to freeze for later.  Really easy recipe with so many options on how to re-adapt for other great meals.  
Thanks for sharing this!

amazing!  added breadcrumbs, 1/2 C, as suggested by other reviewers.  we are dairy-free, so we used a spicy light-mayo instead of dairy, and sandwiched the burger between two corn tortillas, as to reduce the carbs.

These were really good, but I also added 1 c of seasoned bread crumbs to hold them together.  The first batch was a little gooey on the inside, so I made the subsequent ones thinner, and they were perfect!  Non-vegetarian husband and son loved them as well!

Tastes good, like burrito filling, but it crumbled instead of making nice patties.

These were good but as written the would not stay torether. I added approx 1/2 cup bread crumbs. I think the sauce was very good and helped these out alot without the sauce they needed something else. I will be making these again because I have a bunch of the rice and bean mixture left that I am freezing.

Instead of breadcrumbs or flour, I ground "Tostitos with Lime" tortilla chips in the mini-processor--they brought a slight crunch and lime flavor to the burgers. I also added a half-teaspoon of cumin and some fresh chopped cilantro. Hearty and delicious.

I added some about a tsp of liquid smoke, a tablespoon of minced garlic, about 1/2 tsp of salt and omitted the salsa. I made the first burger and it fell apart in the pan so I added an additional egg to the mix and the rest came out beautifully.

Not very tasty, even with the addition of nutritional yeast, garlic, and walnuts. I used some panko (bread crumbs, about 1/2 cup), but they  still were a little crumbly. I think it helps to form a patty in your hand, you can kind of press together it to form a firmer burger. It tasted like egg, which grossed me out. Would not use this recipe again.

I omitted the onions, added about a handful of oatmeal that I processed in the food processor and some bread crumbs, and added cumin, chili powder, and garlic powder.  My family loved them and is begging to have them again!  Next time I will add some salt to the mixture.  Yum!

These were really tasty however they were not burgers.  I just ate the "burger" without the bun because it wasn't the right consistency for a burger.  I had a hard time keeping them together and I even added a handful of breadcrumbs as suggested.  I will be making these again because they tasted really well (with the addition of garlic powder and chili powder) but I will probably bake them next time.

These were excellent. I had no problem with them falling apart. I cooked them over very low heat until they browned, and they didn't even fall apart when flipping them. I also used olive oil spray instead of oil. Added a small jalapeno, along with the onion, melted jack cheese on top, then added a dollop of soy mayo and avocado mixture. I processed the beans in my food processor, though not a lot. That might have been one reason for them sticking together. I made another batch and put them in a zip-lock bag. Testing to see how it freezes. If it works well, I will make and freeze bags of it for my daughter to take back to college.

Very good flavor! I added some 2 hang fulls of crushed crackers, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and about a table spoon of flour. They stuck together much better after this and were great.

I took out the onion and salsa, and added corn instead, along with some chile powder for flavor. I also added about 1/2 cup flour to help it bind. 

The burgers turned out delicious with barbecue sauce on top. I will make these again for sure, maybe with some homemade guacamole or salsa on top.

Great dish! It was a little wet and wasn't holding together well, so I added about a half cup more cooked brown rice, a 1/2 cup of grated cheddar cheese and about two large handfuls of uncooked oatmeal. I used a small red onion instead and threw a few dashes of Frank's Red Hot sauce in there for a little kick. To top it off, I added some fresh guacamole and sour cream. It was DELICIOUS, and I will definitely be making it again soon.

I added garlic and onion powder, but forgot to read reviews until the patties would not hold together.  I added oatmeal to the remaining mixture which helped a lot. However, these were very bland and simply tasted like black beans.  Will not make again.

I always look at others comments before deciding to make something and with these it was very helpful. I added breadcrumbs, tumeric and cumin to the mixture. Like others said already they dont really hold together very well but they are very tastey

I originally went looking for a recipe like this because I really enjoy the Black Bean and Rice burgers they serve @ Ruby Tuesdays. I get tired of veggie burgers, and honestly there are not many I like anyway. These I thought were great. They are a little mushy and can be a little difficult to work with, but very very tasty.

Pretty good!  Like some of the other reviewers, I did add some Panko bread crumbs, ground cumin, chili powder and garlic.  Still a little bland - but, overall yummy!  The sauce, salsa or ketchup adds to the flavor.  Everyone loved these and rated as a "make again!".  Thanks for the recipe.

As is, the recipe is a bit bland for my taste (which is saying a lot because I'm not one for spicy foods). With some changes, these have become a favorite around our house. I dice up 2 or 3 serrano peppers and mix it into the burger mixture to give it some kick. Like other reviewers, I add bread crumbs to help it stick better. I also just sprinkle on some cumin and chile powder (I'm big on just eyeballing it...sorry for imprecise measurements). I also add more salsa (again, I just eyeball it). These are delicious with the changes I made but bland without, so I can't give it a higher rating.

Would give it 4 1/2 if I could.  These were tasty, but I made a few substitutions.  Used quinoa instead of rice, added garlic and used the blender to mash everything instead of a fork.  I left out the salsa from the mix and used it as a topping instead.  To season I used a packet of hot & spicy taco seasoning in the mash.  Then baked on parchment paper in the oven at 400 for 15 minutes.  They came out nice and spicy and stayed together!  Tried one on the stove top and it fell apart, but it would make a tasty meat substitute for tacos!

I was skeptical because I usually don't like veggie burgers, but wow! These are tasty! I added some breadcrumbs, cumin, chili powder and mixed seasonings to the mixture, and served on toasted bread with salsa, lettuce and cheddar. Also, I don't know if this is me or the recipe, but I ended up with six good-sized patties instead of four. Some of these will be frozen, I think...

This is a great recipe, and really easy to make.  I think it is good without modifications, though the last time I made it, I did add cumin, garlic, and chili powder per other reviewers suggestions...yum!  This can easily be modified for vegans by leaving out the egg, and not serving it with cheese or sour cream sauce.  I made it for my mom who is trying out a vegan diet, and served it with salsa, avocado, and lettuce.  They were great!  Also, I baked them in the oven (400 degrees, 15 minutes on each side) instead of frying--I think they hold together better this way and it's healthier too.  Strangely, I think they held together better without the egg.  I might have added too much salsa to the mix though.  Overall, I didn't have too much trouble with them holding together.  If you are serving them with cheese, I recommend putting the cheese over the patty at the end of the frying or baking time--it will help hold the patty unit intact!

SO good! I will never buy black bean burgers again. I followed the suggestion to add bread crumbs (I sprinkled until it seemed "sticky" enough) and served with sharp cheddar cheese and guacamole. Yum!

Added chili powder and some oats.  A little dry...maybe I didn't do something right.

2nd time: added saltines, more rice and lentils, since i'd blended all original ingredients. Alittle bland.

I made this for my picky vegetarian son and he loves it so much. He says its better than the store bought version and wants me to make it all the time. I also use the filling for tacos and tostadas. the only reason for the 4 star instead of 5 is how sticky it is and you have to really watch that it doesnt get all stuck in the pan. I added flour but it is still a pain to make. worth it though.

Very yummy!  Only changes: I added a handful of bread crumbs, added some taco seasoning to the rice while it was simmering and topped with shredded taco cheese instead of cheddar slices. Will definitely make these again.  I'm thinking about making them and freezing the patties for quick meals.

I cooked these at a low temperature for quite a while but they still crumbled when I attempted to flip them. So, I crushed some soda crackers and added that in as a binder. They then held together much better (although I did still have to be gentle when flipping). I cooked the brown rice in broth to give it more flavour. I also added some garlic powder and seasoning salt to the mixture. I fried them in a bit of coconut oil, as I do not like cooking spray. I spread the buns with garlic butter and toasted them a bit. Then I topped the patties with mayonaise, and some onions fried in a little coconut oil and barbeque sauce. Everyone gobbled them up (including my very fussy 9 & 10 year olds and their friends). My son yelled to me from the other room, "Mom, the new recipe is a success!" :)

These were great. They do just fine without the egg because we are vegan. Just add some flour to it and it is just fine.

My husband loved these!  I thought they were good, but needed salt and pepper.  Also, for me, the recipe made 6 large (but thin) burgers.  I also added flour, as many reviewers suggested, and I didn't have any trouble with them falling apart.

These are great burgers!  My whole family (even the non-vegetarians) love them!  I generally use about 1/4 cup of whole wheat bread crumbs to help them stick together a bit better.  Sometimes I add a little ground flax seed, too for extra nutrients.  I like to have these on a toasted bun with melted pepper jack cheese and a slice of tomato.

Tasty, but definitely add bread crumbs or something to help them stick together better.  I made smaller patties to keep them more manageable, as well.  I served them on freshly-made rosemary foccacia bread.

Used Lundberg's Brown and Wild Rice Blend for the rice; added one-fourth cup bread crumbs.  At the last minute, I also added one-half rib celery, diced fine.  Made six thin patties, bun-sized. Didn't have any problems with crumbling, but the one I cooked did partially split when turned but no biggie with that.  I will try these again, perhaps adding more seasonings and/or veggies such as finely grated carrots or chopped spinach.  I like the salsa/sour cream sauce but would make the sauce earlier, just an hour or so, next time.  Used very thick homemade salsa.  (Thick because I made a ton and froze; had to drain off the excess water after thawing.)

These were good, but very mushy and I had to add some bread crumbs to hold them together. 
I'd make them again though, and my kids liked them.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I did not make it exactly according to the directions (I did not have all the ingredients).  I substituted bread crumbs for the rice and spicy thai sauce for the salsa.  Then pan fried them in safflower oil.  I had no trouble keeping them together and they tasted delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

these veggie burgers are tasty and filling. the mixture seemed a bit runny at first; but i put my bowl in the fridge for a few minutes, and it seemed to thicken up quite a bit, and helped the patty hold while cooking. i suggest pan frying in a small amount of vegetable oil, on medium-high heat for 6-7 minutes per side to help them firm up.

This recipe was a veggie hit! We found it helps to make smaller, thinner patties so that they stick together better. We also added bell peppers to our patties for extra flavor.

Great recipe; easy to prepare (if the rice is cooked in advance).
I knew, as I was making these, that they would be rather bland, so I added salt & pepper (I was very surprised they were absent from the recipe) and also a healthy pinch of cumin.  Even at that, the next time I make them, I will be kicking the flavour up a notch or two.
The best praise for this recipe is that they stayed together very nicely -- something most bean burger recipes don't seem to do.   Thanks, Laura!

This is a nice, easily customized recipe. I was out of brown rice so I used couscous which is light and fluffy. I also used the other readers suggestions which helped a lot. I served with a peach chutney from this site that was perfect. It made a bunch so I froze half to have on hand any time.

Love them.  I've made these several times over the past year.  I make a batch and they keep in the fridge for about a week (but they're often gone sooner).  Reheat them in the microwave for a quick lunch.  My daughter loves them too, but no one else in the family.

This was a great recipe. Made a few additions. Added a handful of breadcrumbs like others suggested. I also cut the rice down to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 package extra firm tofu (make sure to drain/squeeze out the water really well), red and yellow bell pepper, and some garlic and herb seasonings along with the usual salt and pepper. The man of the house really enjoyed the burger!

Great burgers.  I had same issue as previous reviewers and even with quite a lot of extra bread crumbs they were still a bit sloppy and falling apart but VERY tasty.  I made some changes apart from the addition of the breadcrumbs, I also added about a tsp of ground cumin and a can of corn.  Husband and 2 young kids loved these burgers.

I followed the recipe closely for the burgers, but decided to serve over a bed of baby spinach and cucumber and tomato in place of the buns. I enhanced the sour cream garnish with chopped kalamata olives and it was super tasty! To help the burgers stick together I let them cook a little longer (about 7 min. a side) and then let them cool a bit in the pan before dishing them up. It was delicious and even my picky eater hubby thought they were great! Will definitely make again.

I am a vegetarian, and my husband is a meat eater... To convience him to eat this burger, I had to point out that meat eaters were eating this too LOL. He is eating it as I am typing this! Thank you for posting this! I did add bread crumbs to the mixture along with  shredded cheddar cheese. My husband, when asking for seconds, says "I'm not thinking this as vegie patties, I'm thinking about this as a bean and rice side with sour cream and salsa."

These were great and very easy to make. I followed the recipe as it is.  It didn't really hold together all that well.  I saw where a lot of people added bread crumbs to help with that but being gluten free it wasn't an option for me. A crowd pleaser at my abode nonetheless.

Love love love this recipe.  I did as previous reviewers have done and added a handful of bread crumbs to the mix, and I also popped them in the oven at 375 for 10 minutes or so after skillet cooking to set them a little better.  They were great!  I have since made it several times and added shredded carrots just to up the nutrition without really changing the flavor.  Also, I have skipped the salsa-sour cream sauce in lieu of mayo and mustard; either way is great!  My beef loving husband even really loves these!

An enjoyable take on the veggie patty. However, my husband recommends adding salt, because otherwise the recipe just doesn't have that "oomph."

I was surprised at how well my family (all 4 kids too) liked these.  I have never tried serving veggie burgers before for fear that they would just go to waste, but I have had this thing for black beans lately... LOL!  In my opinion, these were better as leftovers.  I refrigerated the leftover "burger" mix and then had it for lunch today (made them 2 days ago for dinner) and they tasted better to me.  It may have been because I flattened them a bit more, or because the flavors melded together a bit while in the fridge.  Either way - delicious.  I served them on a hamburger bun the first night and on a toasted english muffin today.  the english muffin was a nice change and added a bit more crunch - YUM.  Will make this again!

I used a lot of the suggestions because they all sounded like they would work to keep the burgers from falling apart. I used a bit of flour - breadcrumbs - a dab of olive oil & sprayed the pan.  I didn't use catsup like I normally would - I wanted to taste the flavor to see if I would make them again. I'm sure I will be making them again - they are the best veggie burger I've had so far. Thanks! BTW with all the extras - mine didn't fall apart at all.

Very tasty!  I loved the flavor but would probably add a little garlic next time.  I'd love to figure out how to make them "stay together" a little better, but other than that a nice low carb healthy meal! Thanks for the recipe!

These were quite good.  I added about a 1/4 cup of bread crumbs based on past reviews and they turned out great.  They did fall apart a bit on the flip, but I just pushed them back together and they held up pretty good.  Throw a slice of cheese on them and you don't even need the salsa/sour cream mix.

Great flavor, but mine didn't hold together to well, I don't think I mashed the black beans enough. Despite the lack of cohesion, they still got eaten.

I made this exactly as shown. The flavor was good, but way too mushy for my liking.  If I make it again I will definitely add bread crumbs to give it some substance.

I'm only giving this a 4 because the original recipe seemed a bit bland.  However, this is a great starting point for delicious and convenient patties! I took others' suggestions of adding breadcrumbs and also seasoned these with adobo seasoning and cumin.  Instead of brown rice I used quinoa.  Will DEFINITELY make these again thanks!!!

This is a really great recipe that me and my husband enjoy on a somewhat regular basis. The only thing that we do different is to add bread crumbs to help hold it all together, but it is excellent as it is. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I got this recipe from TOH's magazine (Fun Food 2008) and decided to make it for myself.  Definitely do not follow the recipe as is, unless you don't mind a huge mess - read the recommendations others have made beforehand!  I had a huge mess - they just fell apart as soon as I tried to turn it over.  The taste is okay - a little bland...I would definitely suggest adding your favorite spices to kick it up a little bit.  I want to try these again, so next time, I will use bread crumbs and some chili powder!

Surprisingly easy for my first try at making a veggie burger. I made as is and got a little excited and prematurely flipped which caused them to break apart a little. I just mushed them back together and the more they cooked, the better they held together. I did turn my temp down which seemed to help. They were very tasty and filling. Will definitely make again and again. There are endless possibilities as to what I could add to make them taste different each time.

This recipe has great potential. However, as written, it is very bland. I think some mushrooms, nuts, garlic, more salsa and other seasonings would perk it up into a great recipe. As written I did have to add some bread crumbs so I could shape them into burgers that held. They did hold up on the grill nicely.

This is definitely a keeper!  My kids loved them.  They were very meaty, much better than premade veggie burgers.  I used a food processor to mix and used bread crumbs as other reviewers suggested.  Some garlic powder added good flavoring.  Very good with the salsa/sour cream!

For the amount of preperation this dish required i expected it to be better, the taste was boring.

I loved this recipe! I did make a few changes, though. I didn't add the salsa and threw in a handful of cornmeal to keep the patties from falling apart. I also added beef broth to the rice while cooking instead of plain water. 
We will definitely make this recipe over and over!

These have a really good taste.  I don't thing my carnivore husband would even smell these, let alone enjoy eating them.  But, I love them.  I did have the problem that others did in getting them to hold together.  I even added bread crumbs.  I may try adding an extra egg next time.

Tasted great but I couldn't get mine to hold together either.  Not sure if I'll try again.

These had a great taste.  I added garlic powder, cumin and chili powder.  They didn't stay together at all.  They crumbled and fell apart.  From now on I will just top w/ salsa and sour cream without a bun.

Oh, and one other thing...it turned out that I did not have any onion, so I chopped up 1 garlic clove and included that.  I love garlic, so it added a nice zing.

I was very disappointed in these burgers as I like vegetarian food and they had many good reviews.  Although I followed the recipe and added bread crumbs as suggested, they were still mushy and pasty.  My family ate them, but I will not be trying this recipe again.

my meat & pot boy did not like these...however, I really did. Like a few other reviewers, mine did not hold together. my batch made 3 good size burgers; i added bread crumbs to the last burger and it held together great! i added a little cumin to the mix as well. loved the salsa/sour cream mix. next time i'll try yogurt instead of sc.

This recipe was so easy! I used kidney beans instead because it was what I had and added on chili pepper.  I saw that others had trouble making them stick together so I added about a 1/2 cup of flour (give or take).  They turned out beautifully!

We love this recipe - it's the best we've found for homemade black bean burgers. I add a little dash of breadcrumbs to the mix and my burgers stay together well as long as I'm gentle with them! We make these at least 2-3 times a month, they're wonderful.

These were okay.  I also found that they did not stick together.  They also needed a little more flavor.  I added 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce.  I think a little more salsa would have worked better.

These taste great, but I also had trouble getting them stick together, in the form of a patty. The second time, I served it as a side dish and ate it with a fork.
