For a much prettier and dramatic bark, melt the white chocolate or candy coating and pour it out on a foil lined pan then sprinkle your fruit and nuts on. This way you can actually see all of the colorful fruits and nuts. Break in pieces and enjoy.

This was a huge hit, easy and delicious.  I used white chocolate chips instead, awesome.  The only negative is it doesn't make enough, double it at least!

Oh momma! This recipe is incredible.... incredibly simple, incredibly popular and incredibly good!!!  I could only find salted macadamias in bulk so I used those and I loved the sweet and salty combination.

Wow. Can't believe something so simple and easy to make could be so GOOD! I just finished making this, and instead of cooking the confectioner's coating on the stove top, I simply microwaved it for 90 seconds on high.  I added slightly more nuts and cranberries because my confectioner's coating came in a 24 oz package, so I used all of that, and upped the other ingredients to match.  Took just a few minutes, then about 20 minutes in the fridge to cool, and it was hard and ready to break into pieces.  Thank you so much for this wonderfully easy recipe. I am making tins of candy and cookies for the kids' school teachers, and this is part of it.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover white chocolate that I had already melted.  Also had some macadamia nuts, and cranberries, so made this.  I love the combination of the cranberries and nuts.  Sweet, tart, chewy, crunchy.  Would make a great presentation for a Christmas gift.  I made these in my mini muffin tin lined with paper liners, which just made for very easy clean up.

So quick and easy!  I chopped my macadamia nuts into pieces - quartered or a little more.  I had never made bark before so I had no clue what I was doing when I spread it out on the pan.  I definitely could have spread it a little thinner than I did.  Turned out GREAT!!  The salty macadamias and the sweet confectioners coating and the tangy cranberries mix together perfectly!!

This looks so pretty and it was so easy to do.  I put the mixture in my silicone mini muffin pan and just popped them out when after they hardened.

I like to make this with pistachios.  The dried cranberries really make it great.  Love the combo of the tart and the sweet.

Christmas Eve, going to see family tomorrow, and I needed a last minute idea for an "arrival gift" that was simple, and I found it! I used white chocolate chips instead, but this came out PERFECT! It took a matter of 10 minutes and I was done! SO elegant and rich, I know it will be a hit- DEFINATELY a new tradition I am thankful to have :-)

Just made this.  I accidentally grabbed dried cherries instead of cranberries, but it is still yummy.  Can't wait for it to harden so I can take it to work and share!  Thanks!

I thought this was pretty good, next time I will use white chocolate instead of the other . My friends adored it, I wasn't too impressed though. The white chocolate could make it a 5 star though.

It was very sweet in that rich sort of way. Keep it cold for the best results, it gets a little melty left out on the counter.

So easy, so quick. I should've halved more of the macademias-- the one's I didn't fell off the bark since I sprinkled the nuts & cranberries post melting the chocolate. Am sending to Africa, hope it makes it in the same condition by Easter!
