The end product was very dry. I was hoping they would come out with the texture of brownies/blondies, but I still think it was dry for a fruit and nut bar, which is essentially what this was (I didn't add the raisins, but I didn't miss them). Maybe next time I will add another egg or egg yolk. I tripled the amount of cinnamon, and it has an absolutely delightful cinnamon taste. However, I should have increased the amount of coffee I put in, as well, because the bitterness was non-existent (and I used French Roast coffee). Good start, though!

I have just made these twice in the past six days and we love them.  I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and used white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour.  I did add one teaspoon vanilla and baked them in a 9 x 9" pan.  The dense texture is wonderful.  I'm glad I found your recipe Debbie Borsick.  Thank you.
