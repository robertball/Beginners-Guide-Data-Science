I agree these are very dry and pretty rough. The pretzels, while adding a unique and appealing taste, end up having a gummy texture that's hard to get past. I followed the recipe to the letter and adjusted baking times with each batch from as-recommended to down to 7 minutes total (which were the best) but still were lousy. I will not try these again.

I used 2 cups of flour and 3 egg whites also added 1 cup butterscotch chips.  I was heavy handed with my spoonfulls so I baked for 10-12mins and they were soft and chewy, but the pretzel bits weren't so great.  Loved the salty pop, but the texture was not so appealing.

They are very dry.  I tried to correct this by cooking for a shorter time frame, 13 minutes is WAY too long, but that alone didn't help much.
