This was just okay. I really think this would be far better sauteed in a pan rather than roasting in an oven. I was cooking chicken in the oven and put this in the oven also. They cooked for approx 40 min. covered and then under the broiler for about 5 or 6 min. They were still very raw and crunchy, but the thing I objected to was how much water there was in the dish once I uncovered them. At least if it were pan sauteed, they wouldn't have been swimming in liquid. Overall, okay flavor, but still missing something.

A simple side dish, exactly what I was looking for. I didn't have the zuchini or radishes, but just worked with the yellow squash I had. If you cube the veg super small, you could make a bruchetta type of dish....instead of tomatoes. :)
