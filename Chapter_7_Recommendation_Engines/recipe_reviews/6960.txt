Like everyone else here at Allrecipes, I read the reviews and figure out what I want to change.  So I cut the flour to 2 1/2 cups, changed the cornmeal to 1 cup, and dropped the water.  It turned out quite nicely, everyone complimented me.  It had much more of a cornbread flavor than the original recipe (according to some other reviewers) and spread with butter at the table tasted great.  I liked it that I didn't have to turn on the oven and heat up the kitchen when it was already unseasonably hot.  Cold ham, cold potato salad, cold broccoli salad, and this bread to fill up my kids who aren't old enough to appreciate the salads, made it a very nice meal.

One of the BEST new additions to my bread recipe list in a long time.  The interior of the bread has a warm golden color, from the cornmeal.  The cornmeal also provided wonderful texture, and the slight flavor of corn was apparent. Milk and egg in the ingredients didn't hurt either.  Reminiscent of a corn flavored brioche. Phenomenal crust---and lastly, try making toast from this bread, and you'll be very happy.

This recipe makes really good breadsticks (kind of like the cornbread twists you can get at the store).

My husband made this recipe, (he is the bread maker in the family), and it lacked flavor.  It needed more salt and sweetness to it.

Also makes great rolls.  For a slightly chewy very moist bread, try rapid rise yeast and the express bake setting on your bread machine.

Our family really loved this bread! I also served it with chili and also toasted it for breakfast. It was great both ways. My son who only likes store bought bread thought it was good. That's why I gave it 5 stars for kid friendly. Thanks for a good recipe I will use often.

Very easy to do.  I prepared mine in the bread machine dough cycle & then took it out and formed it into a turkey shape on the pan.  It was the hit of the dinner!

This bread goes great with a hearty soup and salad.  My family liked it best served warm.  It was a little more crumbly the next day, but still delicious.

I almost never review stuff, but this recipe was very good! Easy to make, yummy! I followed recommendations to use 3 cups flour to 1 cup cornmeal, buttermilk instead of milk and I used 3 Tbs honey instead of sugar. Came out great!

I cannot imagine anyone anywhere not liking this bread.  Definitely a keeper.  It was wonderful, lite, flavorful and fluffy.  Can't image how Rater#2 got an onion flavor though.

The bread turned out great, I did substitute buttermilk for the regular milk as that is all I had on hand and added 1/2 tsp garlic salt and 1/2 of a small jalopeno pepper diced so the bread was definitely not bland. I noticed that the dough was having a hard time forming into a ball, the dough was very wet which may have been due to my additions so I ended up adding another 1/2 cup flour and the dough immediately formed nicely. I used the dough cycle on my bread maker and then removed and formed 2 loaves which I cooked at 350 for 25 minutes.  The bread has a beautiful crust that  rose nicely.

7-8-12 Recipe revisited, haven't made it in several years  but remembered it and I have been on a cornbread mission last few days. Thought I would give it try again, here is what I did differently this time: used molasses (little bit I had leftover from another recipe), butter, water, dried milk pwdr, little more water. Seemed really dry in machine so I added a tiny bit more water. Original review from 2006:
This is one of my fav bread machine recipes on this site. Its not really 'cornbread', but white bread with a hint of cornmeal. Sometimes when I make this, it seems dry in the machine so I add a little more water.

1-26-2018 ~What a delicious, interesting bread!  (I can’t stop eating it – untoasted with butter, toasted with ham, just plain toasted.  I must stop)  This didn’t have a cornbread  taste, but I expected that.  The cornmeal is just enough to make it…interesting.  First, it has great visual appeal, with its little flecks of cornmeal, pale golden color and sort of crackly crust.  Second, the cornmeal adds great texture, with a bit of grit since I used coarse ground.  Finally, it is a hearty, crusty bread, somewhat artisan, which I love.  Because I know my bread machine misbehaves, I’ve learned how to work with it to make it obey, so I made the following amendments to the recipe – and they all really worked to produce something remarkable!  I used 3 c. flour, 1/2 c. cornmeal, 1-1/2 tsp. salt and just 1 T. of sugar, still more than I typically use.  In my machine the bread would overflow like lava from a volcano had I not.  Besides, I don’t like breads with even the hint of sweetness.  I used 1 c. of buttermilk (rather than milk) and, because I reduced the amount of flour a tad, I used no water. I limited the yeast to just 2 tsp. since again, my bread machine tends to make the breads go crazy and rise much more than they should. Rather than shortening I used butter. This bread is a little different than others I’ve tried and was a happy surprise.

Tastes pretty good but the corn flavor is very mild.  It does have a nice golden tone with crispy crust.  Next time I would add slightly more liquid and use melted butter instead of shortening.

This is not a cornbread. It is a fluffy, soft yeast bread with a little bit of added texture and flavor from cornmeal. I used wholewheat flour and stoneground cornmeal, which is probably why I had to add extra water to the dough. I ended up shaping the dough into two small loaves, and they baked up beautifully. I served this with chilli, and everyone really enjoyed it. Thanks for the recipe!

Tasty bread that complimented my bean soup well!  If you are expecting old fashioned southern cornbread, you should not be looking at a yeast bread recipe!  I read many of the reviews before making this bread and automatically changed the flour to 3 cups, the cornmeal to 1 cup, and used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  I found I needed to add an extra 2 tbsp water to my dough after it started mixing.  This was a hearty bread with a nice corn flavor.  My family has requested it again.

This makes a really impressive, pretty loaf.  I usually make the dough in the bread maker and then give it one last rise on the stove in a bread pan and bake it at 350 for 30 minutes so I have a more traditionally shaped loaf.  This bread rose very impressively and it baked a beautiful golden brown.  Unfortunately, as some other reviewers noted, this bread is pretty bland.  Its not even white bread bland, it's almost tasteless bland.  It's not by any means inedible, nor is it bad, it's just not "good" if you know what I'm trying to say.  It really needs more sweetness or maybe a splash of hot sauce for some zing.  Pretty loaf, just not much flavor at all.  May try again with some recipe modifications.

This bread is so yummy!  I have made it several times and it always turns out beautiful.  My family loves this bread.  It is so soft and light. I've made it exactly as written but I usually use 1 c cornmeal and 3 c flour, and I often replace the milk with buttermilk. Thanks for a great recipe.

This loaf had georgeous color and a very high rise, and a light, soft texture. Love what the cornmeal added. I had to modify it since I don't have a bread machine, and found that it didn't need all the flour called for. I warmed the milk, dissolved the yeast and sugar in it, then added the rest of the wet and then the dry ingredients. I kneaded it with my Kitchenaid for about 10 min, and baked it in a greased loaf pan at 375 for 35 min. When I took it out of the oven, I brushed the crust with melted butter, which I think I'll start doing with every bread recipe.

I have made this twice. The first loaf was good but the second time I decreased the flour by 1/2 cup (very dry where we live) and I added a half tablespoon more sugar. This turned out great! Wonderful toast and sandwich bread. Not cornbread as I know it but great bread !

Have tried several time and also experiemented.  It's an unfortunate compromise and doesn't taste like great corn bread or great white bread.  Needs something but didn't find it.

Very nice. Baked well in the breadmaker, would recommend using the light crust setting. Very light flavor, maybe a little more seasoning to make it perfect.

Delicious bread with an interesting crust. There's just a hint of cornmeal on the crust. As previously mentioned this is great right out of the bread machine and even better the next day as toast.

Don't let the name fool you. This is NOT cornbread as you normally think of it. It is yeasted bread with cornmeal. I've made it many times. Comes out great. Wonderful taste. Great toast. It's one of my favorite BM recipes. I will make it again and again.

I've been making this for several years now and love this recipe.  It is best when warm, and I always make it to go with my 13 bean soup.  It's light and the corn flavor is not overpowering, very subtle.  As others have mentioned, it makes nice toast the next day.  Very fine grained, high rising - has never failed.

This turned out okay, more of a cake than a bread in my view, I've never found a bread with egg in that I really enjoyed.  It was a gorgeous colour though, and had a very nice crust, but I did end up turning half into a bread pudding and half into croutons.  However, if you like your bread sweet and eggy (challah fans?) you'll probably enjoy this bread.

Delicious and easy. I've made this several times. This last time I added 1/4 tsp turmeric to add a more golden colour and I added 1tbsp butter. Like others have said this keeps well and it tastes great toasted. My first review was 2013.

We are in a small village in Costa Rica where it is difficult to find decent hamburger buns. I thought I would give this recipe a try.  It was my third different recipe attempt.  I used the dough cycle on my bread machine and after it was complete,  I rolled the dough out and cut it into 3 inch circles, and let them rise about 40 minutes.  I put a empty baking pan at the bottom of the oven while it was preheating @ 385.  Put the buns in, added water to the pan and baked for about 18 minutes. These were incredible, the best buns we have had in a long time.  I will look no further they were that good.

My family loved this bread - it needed nothing more than a little butter.  My daughter (who has never been a bread eater) ate this right away and asked for more.  The recipe made a beautiful loaf of bread - it rose and baked above the pan.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, Dr. Michael!

I reach for this recipe whenever I make chili - it's perfect!

I add twice as much tabasco as is called for. 

I turn it out and shape it into two baguettes.  Yum!

This bread is fabulous! The crust and taste can't be beat. I used 1 c. of whole wheat flour, and I let it rise twice. I baked my loaf in an 8 x 4 pan for 30 minutes. I also got five 1 1/2 inch rolls out of the recipe. Those baked for about 23 minutes and turned out nice and crusty. Verla and Dr. Michael, you both rock!

Fantastic. No one wants any other kind of bread now :-).  Followed other suggestions, upped water to 1/4 cup and used 1 cup corn flour (not corn meal) and 3 cups of bread flour. This tends to be larger than my one-pound machine and falls at the end, but still is fantastic. My next machine will  be larger.

This was good bread.  I ended up using most of it for stuffing.  So many reviews said to use one cup of cornmeal instead of 1/2 cup so that is what I did.  Next time I will use the called for 1/2 cup.  I really think I will like it better the original way.  Thanks Verla for sharing your recipe.

I was looking for a yeasty cornbread to accompany a pork roast for Thanksgiving dinner. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and cut the flour to 2 1/2 cups, changed the cornmeal to 1 cup, and omitted the water. The bread turned out GREAT. Not dry or crumbly, and it is even good the next day (which I can rarely say of bread produced by my bread machine). This is definitely a recipe I will make again and again.

I really like this bread. A little like cornbread but its not like what you think of when you think traditional cornbread. The top of my loaf fell in during baking but it didn't effect the taste one bit. I definitly will be making this again. Would go great with stews or chili.

Let me start by saying I love cornbread and I love regular yeast breads and I did not really care for this.  I had this recipe in my online recipe box and have been wanting to try it for a long time but am really dissapointed.  It was edible with butter and honey but not something I went back to after the first slice.  Usually you have to drag me away from bread!  I guess it just wasn't for me...I think I'll try making some croutons or french toast with it.  It's pretty bland...

Nice taste. This was the first loaf of bread that has ever burned in my breadmaker (Set on the lowest setting).

OK. Seemed more like egg bread than corn bread. I like a heartier bread. Update: I used half whole wheat flour, and I really like it this way. Yum!

Bread was ok. . This recipe leaves dense bread with little to no real taste. I made with soup, my kids said the bread was boring. I tried it and had to agree.

Very dense bread.  The flavor was not what I was expecting.  Nobody in my family cared for it.

It was a good bread, but not really a cornbread. I added a bit more sugar and cut back on the flour as noted by another reviewer. Will use again!

This recipe made a perfect looking loaf of bread. But we prefer a regular quick bread type of cornbread or even a regular white bread over this. There was just something about the texture of the crust that seemed a little strange. However, we liked it much better after we toasted it.
