This was a great new breakfast dish.  Didn’t have sweet potatoes on hand so used russets and used a smoky bacon sea salt rather than regular salt and then added a bit of shredded cheese.  Will definitely put this into our rotation

I was looking for a breakfast recipe with sweet potatoes.  This was perfect!  Simple and tastes delicious!  I did modify it to my liking.  I cubed both potatoes and onion, put in skillet with tiny bit  of olive oil, enough to crisp them.  Added a dash of pink salt & cajun season.  Then I just added two steamed eggs on top.  You can alter this recipe using different ingredients.  I just wanted a healthier version for my personal diet.

I really loved this and had it for dinner instead of breakfast.   

I had to make a couple changes due to what I had on hand but the basic ingredients were the same.
You could add/subtract so many things to this, it is very versatile that way!
I like the other reviewers suggestion of jalapeños and sour cream.  I’ma big fan of those :)

I forgot to take the picture with the eggs in the pan, but I added chopped jalapeños because we like it spicy and we topped it with avocado. Yummmmm
