I made this recipe and it was amazing. The only changes I made was I left out the chicken sausage, and for bread crumbs I used Cheerios, because they are a fantastic gluten free substitute for bread crumbs!! Just pop them in the blender and done.

Ii made these using turkey and capreses chicken sausage from Costco. They were easy to make and delicious. Best part? All 3 kids aged 9, 12 & 15 loved them. It's so rare to make something that they all love! I served with my homemade spaghetti sauce and penne pasta. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

Very good for turkey meatballs!  I can't get fresh chicken sausage in my area and subbed with Italian Sausage (used 1 lb ground turkey + 1/2 lb italian sausage), omitted the egg and milk due to dietary restrictions, but the meatballs held up fine and were not dry or falling apart. The smell of the meat mixture seemed slightly off to me and I added a tad more basil and parsley (dried as that's what I had on hand; flavor of chicken sausage varies and my italian sausage was weak in seasonings). Really enjoyed these in comparison to straight turkey meatballs. The sausage seems to add the lack of fat along with additional flavor whereas straight ground turkey meatballs tends to be on the dry side and requires more seasoning. I added these meatballs to Basic Marinara for the Instant Pot by Bren and it was an excellent spaghetti and meatballs dinner! Will use these going forward for turkey meatballs! Thanks for the recipe, Olivia!

For the family that isn't gluten-free, this recipe works well with panko bread crumbs.

I made no changes. I would recommend to cut the chicken sausage to 1/4 lb. The sausage overwhelm the the turkey. I will eat them with my eggs for breakfast.

Very flavorful!  The foil needs extra cooking spray because meatballs don't have much grease & mine stuck.  I also recommend turning meatballs so they can brown on 2 sides.

Very good!  my husband was recently put on a gluten-free, dairy-free diet, so I made this without the cheese and they were delicious.  I baked the meatballs then slipped them into homemade sauce that i had simmering on the stove.  Delicioso!

These are sooooo good. The sausage really gives it that kick to make them Super Meatballs. The mixture stays moist and yet still holds together. Thank you for the recipe.
