I made this several years ago with homemade linguica and it was fabulous.  I have another pot of it simmering away right now but with Cajun sausage instead of linguica (couldn't find any and didn't feel like making my own again) and it smells divine.  Truly flavorful, hearty meal.

I did not have Ling but I used a combo of hot and sweet sausage and it turned out great!

Great recipe, probably one of the best soups Iâ€™ve made. I added a little salt and one extra chile for more kick.  I was a little uneasy as I usually stick to sub-60 min recipes but it was totally worth it.
