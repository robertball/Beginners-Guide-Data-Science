I have tried just about every single mushroom recipe in this website and this one by far blows all of them out the box!!  I loved it so much that I ate the whole thing almost by myself.  My daughter doesn't even like mushrooms and was fighting with me for some more.  I just returned from the supermarket with 4 more packs of mushrooms just so I can make this again.  If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I certainly would.  No need to change a thing, PERFECT AS IS!!!!  Thank you soooooooooo much for an easy, quick, healthy and delicious recipe.  This has officially become a staple in my recipe box!

Can't have a great steak without sauteed mushrooms, and while I have my favorite way of seasoning them, this was a nice change. Had to sneak in the soy sauce, since hubs had told me he wouldn't like it, but after eating them he said he was pleasantly surprised. The secret, I think, is not to go overboard with the soy sauce! I loved 'em, and they were perfect with our grilled steaks!

Dang!  This is the best, great, simple recipe for shrooms!  What I really like about this recipe is that the poster gave approximate times for cooking them, "until the mushroom sweat, about 5 minutes."  This makes this recipe perfect everytime.

Ive been making shrooms just like this for years. When I want a bit of a change, I add some heavy cream and fresh thyme to this recipe, reduce and drool. So good on anything!

Nice change of pace from regular saut√©ed mushrooms.  Didn't change a thing and the recipe didn't need it.  Wonderful as is though a note of caution:  When the recipe calls for 2 tsps, it means 2 tsps and no more....  Adding to much soy sauce will ruin the flavor of these delectable fungi! Enjoy!

Fantastic, these are the best fried mushrooms I have ever had.  I cut the mushrooms into larger size slices, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't think it needed any more soy sauce.

This is an excellent, simple, yet flavorful recipe. We often make fresh mushrooms a side for dinner and these were great.

I think I thought by the 5 star rating that this was going to be something mind blowing. It wasn't. It tasted like soy sauce and mushrooms. Which I guess is ok but when pairing it with a steak, the steak doesn't need it.

This recipe is amazing! I love, love, love mushrooms and I think I've found my all-time favorite recipe.  I used baby bellas (its what I had) and served with oven baked brown rice and a morningstar grillers prime veggie burger for a flavorful and healthy meal!!

I had to edit my rating from 4 stars to 5, these mushrooms are delicious! I served over steaks, the sauce compliments the steaks incredibly well. Next time I will double the recipe, my daughter couldn't get enough of these!

My fiance loved this. I have tried this recipe with just mushrooms. I've tried it adding chicken & I've even tried it adding noodles from the asian food market since they have an asian flavor (to me anyway). No matter what you add the recipe is awesome.

We love mushrooms and this recipe hit it right out of the ballpark!  I made an error when preparing this - I pulled out the Worcestershire Sauce instead of the Soy Sauce and added 1 tsp before I realized my error, so - I went ahead and added 2 tsp. of soy sauce as the recipe directs - forgot the pepper but it was awesome anyway.  I'll be making this again!  Served it over cod baked with a panko crumb topping and it was delish!  Thanks Steveandangela for a winner,

It was pretty good but I couldn't get enough of the soy sauce flavor. I doubled the amount and it still wasn't enough for me. Also, I added onions which went really well with the dish.

Yum, yum!  I left out the black pepper as a personal preference and instead of fresh garlic, I used 2 tsp of the minced garlic in oil found in the spice isle.  Other than that, I followed the recipe basically as written. I was able to make this while my grill was heating up.  When there was just a little bit of liquid remaining, I went ahead and turned off the burner and covered my pan.  When I got done cooking my steaks, the mushrooms were still warm and they had absorbed most of the remaining liquid.  Such a time saver!! I would remind everyone that this is a 2 serving recipe.  In fact, if you ask my husband, this only serves 1.  There were no leftovers.

Very nice.There are very
few perks to dining with a picky eater. This evening's dinner I enjoyed  one of them.  
Being the only mushroom fan, I was more than happy to have them all to myself. I followed the recipe as written, only adding a little parsley for colour and the slight freshness it provides. Thank you so much for posting a real keeper.

Skipped the butter (mushrooms release so much of their own liquids, I usually finish with the butter if I add it at all). This was SUPER quick and easy to prepare for a side. When we pull out the grill this will be perfect for steaks, etc. but tonight we enjoyed it with a shrimp dinner.

Delicious!!!  Adding brown rice and sauteed onions to the mushrooms is fantastic! My favorite restaurant serves brown rice with onions and mushrooms. I'm happy to have found this recipe, because it seems I've cracked their secret with this one. Love it!

I don't see a lot of five star ratings. I was really surprised how good these were. The recipe is so simple but the taste is HUGE. The mushrooms act as a sponge for the butter and the soy sauce adds the perfect amount of salt. I LOVED this recipe and so did my boyfriend. Will make this over and over again. I used whole crimini mushrooms and they turned out perfect. Not too firm and not at all mushy.

I thought these were really going to have a 'glaze' but they didn't. I made them following the recipe but was pretty disappointed. There really wasn't any soy flavor, and there was no 'glaze' they tasted like regular old fried mushrooms. That being said they were good on steak.

Easy to make, delicious. I usaed Teriyaki since I didn't have soy, just cook a little less long or over lower heat since the sauce is sweeter. Excellent over brown rice.

I made this tonight exactly as the recipe stated. It wasn't very flavorful so I added Worcestershire, garlic salt, and lemon juice. Then it was awesome.

I've been making something just like this for years, only I just throw it together.  I've never used a recipe.  So I thought I'd give this a try.  I used crimini mushrooms because that's what I had and added a touch of sherry along with the soy sauce.  This was very good and went well with grilled steak and caprese salad.  Thanks so much for the post.

These were everything promised by all reveiws.  I used lo sodium soy because that's what I had.  I usually have regular soy sauce.  I sure would not want it any saltier.  Next time I will use unsalted butter as well as lo sodium soy.  I added a tiny pinch of red pepper flakes because I really like them with anything soy.  Wonderful!

Excellent.  I doubled the sauce and used whole white mushrooms.  This recipe really brings out the savory taste of mushrooms, it doesn't overpower-it compliments.

Absolutely hands down THE BEST recipe for turning simple button mushrooms into stars!!  For health reasons, I subbed extra virgin olive oil instead of butter and Bragg's liquid aminos instead of soy sauce.  After trying this just once, I told my mom that I'LL be making the mushrooms this year to bring to Thanksgiving dinner.  Thank you for posting this outstandingly simple recipe!!

So simple and so easy, yet elegant! I made these with sliced portabellas and they came out fantastic. You can have a side dish on the table in a matter of minutes. I'll be sticking with this one for my mushrooms. Don't substitute the butter, it really absorbs into the mushrooms for a tasty flavor. Great on the side with a steak!

the trick with mushrooms is to get your pan very hot, add the butter and let it melt and sizzle just til melted then add your mushrooms.  toss to coat with butter, then LEAVE ALONE to brown.  when one side is browned toss or flip to brown the other side continue with recipe above.  with a very hot pan you will not have the mushroom giving off much liquid.  i also added a splash of sherry to mine.  i thought these were excellent however i think any sauteed mushroom will be good if you use a very hot pan.

Loved this recipe and have made so many times, I have done some variations.  Instead of soy sauce, use sherry or marsala wine to give it more flavor. Another key, but will add some time to making them is reduce and refresh the liquid a couple of times to get even more flavorful mushrooms.   I served over angel hair pasta and it is delicious.

With so many phenomenal reviews I made this recipe strictly to the letter, and it really is perfect. My husband is the mushroom-lover and he was raving. I didn't even add pepper to taste, the simple flavors of butter, garlic, and soy were all that was needed. I don't think I could make this with any changes, SUPERB recipe, thanks so much for sharing!

Simple quick and great tasting...what more could you want in a recipe. I did use low sodium soy sauce and added a few dashes as the mushrooms were simmering. I also threw in a handful of chopped green onions...a very nice added flavor. We served these along side our Firecracker Grilled Salmon from All Recipes. Can't wait to try these with some grilled steaks.

Wow, this recipe is wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly.  The soy sauce was very subtle.  I might try adding more as other reviewers suggested just to test out which way I prefer them.

I cook mushrooms like this ALL the time. Try it with green onions and evaporated milk and some mayo and it makes a delicious sauce to put over rice or pasta.

I've been making this on my own for years, my only addition.... a splash of white wine and I throw everything in together at the same time and cook on low for 15-20 minutes.

I served these with grilled beef filets and we enjoyed them.  However, I can‚Äôt say I was particularly wowed by them.  The recipe is certainly quick and easy, so I would make them again, if I‚Äôm short on time.

So Simple and delicious! I will be making this again and again. I didn't really taste the soy sauce like I thought I would. Make sure not to crowd your mushrooms when you cook them. I like to slice the smaller white mushrooms in half and brown each flat side. Thanks for the keeper!

Very yummy!  I followed the recipe to a tee.  I enjoyed the mushrooms a bit more when they were at room tempature rather than hot off the pan.  Excellent recipe!  Thank you!!

I did half butter, half olive oil. Wow, they were so good I ate them all in one go.  Next time I think I'll make rice, too, so I get at least two meals out of them.  Yum.

Very good side dish. I doubled the recipe and had no problems at all.  Since I don't eat steak, I had it with grilled salmon and they went together great. I usually just cook mushrooms in butter with onions so this was a very nice change. I think I'll add a little bit more soy sauce next time. I would also recommend using freshly minced garlic (I didn't and I could definately taste the difference). The only reason I gave it four stars though it b/c they weren't "Wow!". But very good though!

Fantastic recipe! I used margarine instead of butter and it worked fine. I also used baby portabellos instead of the white mushrooms. It was a great way to use up extra mushrooms that I didn't know what to do with.

These bring back fond memories of growing up, my mom used to make a very similar recipe. These are soo good I hardly had any left for my steak by the time it was done because I had snacked on so many. Thanks for the recipe:)

I've made this before, and love it.  But here's my version - Substitute the Soy Sauce for Teriyaki sauce, and add 1 oz of dry Sherry.  Awesome!  Also, 8 oz of mushrooms is not enough, unless that's per person.

Used baby portobella mushrooms and added an extra teaspoon of soy sauce.  Did not have to cook an additional four minutes because the soy sauce cooked down almost immediately.  Very nice side dish.

I hate mushrooms but made this for the vegetarian hubby. He LOVED it! I reluctantly tried one so as to be a good chef and was shocked I even liked it my self! (That's a first with me and mushrooms) Definitely a simple and quick recipe, I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for this one, I'll probably use this every time I cook mushrooms from now on

For those of you who LOVE this recipe and like onions, throw a sliced sweet onion in with the mushrooms.  It is the best steak topper ever!!!  So tasty!!

I had a large portabella mushroom I sliced and used for this recipe. I think I would use a bit less soy sauce next time, other wise we thought it was good

I followed the recipe exactly but substituted the soy sauce for Mrs. Bragg's Liquid Aminos, since I had that on hand, and everyone loved it. It was devoured and a definite keeper. Thanks for the great, simple recipe!

Yes! This is pretty much how I make mine every time. I don't usually use butter and just sprinkle a little Garlic & Parsley seasoning instead of using minced garlic. Perfection. Goes great with any meat. Me and my daughter eat these up all the time.

Fast, easy and tasty! This recipe makes a great topper for fish and other entrees as well as veggies like the steamed asparagus we tried with it. I exchanged a whipped butter and canola spread for the butter reducing the amount to just 1 tsp. and used a non-stick pan without any trouble. I also used a low-sodium soy sauce and the recipe still worked out great with these healthier changes. This one will be a staple of our new lighter menu dishes.

Great, quick, simple recipe. I used unsalted butter the 2nd time that I made this because the 1st time was just slightly too salty for me.

I would make again, but the mushrooms seemed a bit drier than I expected. i expected an actual "glaze". Next time I will double the wet ingredients.

AWESOME!   I fixed this per the original recipe for a side dish.  My hubby RAVED about it - and wanted more after the plate was empty!!  The only change, is next time, I'll use low sodium soy sauce..   This will be a staple!!

A little too salty for my taste. I agree that the soy sauce probably needs to be used a bit more sparingly in this recipe.

I've been making sauteed mushrooms, with a touch of soy sauce, for several years. Wonderful flavor. Sometimes I use olive oil, rather than butter -- or a combination of the two. Thanks.    : )

Very tasty!  I did add sweet onion to the mushroom mixture because we like onion with our steak.  I used reduced sodium soy sauce and only used the amount specified in the ingredients.

A 10 star recipe!  A great way to use your leftover mushrooms in the refrigerator.  I also added some sliced onions and diced bell peppers.  If you want to have this as part of an Asian dish, you can easily sprinkle some ground ginger or Chinese Five Spice powder during the cooking process.  Otherwise, it's just fine with just the soy sauce.  Try this recipe.  You'll won't be disappointed.

One word - Awesome!
Made this tonight, and I am done looking for a sauteed mushroom recipe. Next time, I'll add onions just for fun.
So good!

Is it bad that I enjoyed the shrooms more than the steak?!?!  Wonderful!  Made as written, adding more soy sauce would have overpowered the mushrooms.  Thanks for sharing!

I made the mistake of putting too much soy sauce for too few mushrooms. I was using old mushrooms in my fridge and only had about 4 that hadn't gone spoiled. I tried to wash off some soy sauce from the mushrooms which helped. The point is they were tasty none the less and I ate them in a fresh french loaf with butter! Will definitely make again with less soy sauce next time! :)

Very good an easy to make!
I followed some reviewers and used more soy sauce and it was quite salty! So don't do it before trying it first. Stick to the recipe!
The whole house smelt wonderfully of glazed mushrooms :)
Thanx for sharing.

This recipe is amazing! I sliced the mushrooms pretty thin and sauteed them in a mix of butter and olive oil before adding the garlic and soy sauce.  I also didn't end up adding any black pepper.  I served it with the Baked Teriyaki Chicken, another recipe from this site.  I will make these mushrooms again and again!!  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe both with steaks and as a side (or alone)! I make it with unsalted butter and I think it makes it perfect (dark soy sauce is also a delicious change).

I doubled the recipe and threw in some steak chunks in the very beginning with the mushrooms.  It was AMAZING!  Honestly, with so few ingredients I couldn't possibly imagine that it would be to die for, but it is.  Even for people who don't love mushrooms!

This recipe is great. Thanks! I also like to use Trader Joe's Soyaki sauce (basically the same thing plus seasame seeds. Great for tofu, too:)

Awesome! Amazing with the fresh garlic! The soy adds just enough salt and the fresh ground pepper adds the finishing touch!

These were delicious!  Served them with pork chops one night then atop burgers the following night.  Quick and easy to prepare just as is.  :)

Delicious.  Made as per recipe and my husband, my one-year old and I devoured the whole pan in a few minutes!  Super easy.  I think it would be hard to mess up.

I followed the recipe to the letter but for some reason mine did not turn out according to the directions.  My pan was full of liquid.  I was hoping to serve these as a side dish, but there was just too much liquid.  Since they didn't work as a side dish I'm going to bake chicken tomorrow and use them as a topping.  The flavor is fantastic, I will try this again, maybe it was the batch of mushrooms.

These were great!  I thought the soy sauce would make them possibly taste like stir fry.  But, they instead tasted like the side of mushrooms that come with steaks at the fine dining restaurants.  Gonna save me a lot of money now. They tasted even better after sitting a few minutes.  I could have eaten the whole 8oz at that point! I think I will double the recipe next time to the 1 lb package.  And, I might try low sodium soy sauce also, just to cut back on the salt. Definitely more than enough soy sauce. The cooking times were exact to which made it especially helpful.  Thank you so much for submitting a great, easy, and quick recipe to eat with steaks!  This recipe will become a regular.

Simple and delicious.  Found this recipe and since I had all of the ingredients on hand I made it to go with some mahi mahi we were grilling.  Added in a bit of chopped onion along with the garlic and I also added in a splash of balsamic vinegar in addition to the soy sauce.  Mushrooms were flavorful and delicious.  Will definately make this again.

I used whole button mushroom instead of sliced and they turned out great.  My husband remarked that these tasted similar to mushrooms he's had at hibachi-style grills.

I haven't tried the recipe yet but it sounds exactly like how I prepare my favorite mushrooms except that I use Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce.  Another one of my favorites that I also recommend trying is cooking your 'shrooms with sweetened black vinegar, soy sauce and a touch of Srirach Hot Chili Sauce.  YUM :)

Abosuletly fabulous! The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and it was great! The second time I made it (right after dinner of the first time I made it) I also added 3/4 tsp of balsamic vinegar. It was also fabulous. Will definitely make again and double or triple the recipe!

Don't underestimate the simplicity of the ingredients and this recipe. The final outcome is fantastic!!! I was searching for a way to use a bag of mushrooms I forgot about and came upon this recipe. It will now become a regular. I love the leftovers on a salad--great flavors!

This was a great way to use up a bag of presliced mushrooms that were a bit past their prime.  So quick, easy and tasty.  I did also add a small diced onion in with the garlic.  Great with steak from the grill.

LOL  I didn't know there was a 'recipe' for this. I've been making my mushrooms like this for 30 years. Can't get a better topping for steak or even a good old fried hamburger. Its a hit every time.

Made recipe as written and found them  tasty as prepared, but a bit blah. Sprinkled some seasoned rice vinegar on them to add some acidity and they really popped. Served them over arugala with a sunny side up egg  as a side with a boring pork pie. Crazy yummy!

I made absolutely no changes to this recipe, And the recipe turned out excellent . My wife made a nasty face when I was preparing this recipe, and when I pulled out the soy sauce her face cringed even more. When the entire meal was complete... her thoughts had completely changed. She raved about it, and my kids loved it. Just FYI this recipe pairs well with any meat. I put it over homemade Rottisere chicken. Great recipe!!!

Added this to the table on Thanksgiving this year. After reading several reviews I decided to make a slight alteration to the recipe though. A few people were saying it was pretty much just sauteed mushrooms and they didnt find it anything special. I wanted to give it a real thick glaze. I doubled the butter and soy sauce, and then after adding the soy sauce I threw in half a teaspoon of corn starch as a thickener. Had to cook a little longer to thicken the glaze up but it came out Wonderful!

Amazing recipe!!!  The only thing I add is a little garlic salt and garlic powder to enhance the flavor this dish or I'll cook fresh green beans and then add the beans to the mushrooms after they've finished cooking and then season with garlic salt and garlic powder to have a delicious green bean and mushroom side.

Simple recipe with excellent results. I pick a variety of wild mushrooms and occasionally enhance their flavor with similar preparations.  I like teriyaki as well as soy sauce for the glaze. Both work well with hen of the woods, oyster, and honey mushrooms, as well as others. The key is to wait until there is adequate moisture in the pan before adding the garlic. Otherwise the garlic browns up too quickly. Putting a lid on the pan for a while also speeds up the "sweating" process.

They were amazing!!!  The only thing that I changed in this was I didn't and the garlic to mince up so I used a dash of garlic powder. Besides that I followed everything else and they will now become my new staple!!

Used minced garlic instead of fresh and added extra soy sauce and I ate the whole thing.  Might try adding onions next time

sounds too basic-but really delish! love mushrooms, so this added just that extra bit of seasoning.

This is a quick and easy recipe but I thought it was a little salty. Maybe that is because I am trying  to watch my sodium. They are good but I will reduce the soy sauce to 1 1/2 tsp next time using low sodium soy sauce. 
Still it was good and I enjoyed them and the recipe is very easy.

This was good. I love mushrooms, so how can you go wrong?  I wouldn't really call them glazed though, saut√©ed is a better discription. I did sprinkle on some granulated garlic and add just a tiny punch of salt. These would be great on top of a steak or burger or in an omelette

I make Shrooms just like this with the exception I add 1 Level Teaspoon of Hoisin sauce. It gives it just a hint of sweetness & is great on steaks.

Too salty. I put in some ginger, sesame oil and some orange juice along with the listed ingredients. Marinate slices of large shrooms or whole small shrooms then grill! Now that is Yummy

I wanted a little more of a side dish so I made this recipe but added cooked orzo, a little extra soy sauce, and a tablespoon of butter at the end.  It was delicious!  My husband stood over the stove finishing off the pot!!

The first time I made this recipe, I thought I had soy sauce on hand, but I did not.  So I made the recipe as written, but used sesame oil in place of the soy sauce. The second time I made the recipe, I made it as written using soy sauce.  Both were wonderful, but I really did prefer it with sesame oil.

I added too much soy sauce, which was my fault, but this was a tasty side dish for my salsa chicken and side salad.  It wasn't the most amazing thing in the world but it definitely added something a little different to just cooked mushrooms on the side.

These mushrooms were divine!  They were easy to make and a big hit at a party I brought them too. My only criticism is that they are rather salty.  I think I will try the low sodium soy sauce next time.

WOW!! I love mushrooms and these were in my opinion the best... Loved them, followed recipe other than used 24ozs, so tripled everything and I didnt let all the liquid absorb so there was juice.... Our steak came out overcooked which was a bummer, but, the mushrooms made up for it.... For tripling the recipe there wasnt one mushroom left. THanks I will make this a staple for sure..

This recipe is similar to one I use often.  The only thing I would change is to use Teriyaki sauce instead of soy. There is more depth of flavor and I find it a little less salty.  You could also use Teriyaki Baste and Glaze.  It makes it a little more saucy.  The brand I find that works the best is Kikkoman.  They are great with steaks.  ---Woozer

I made this recipe to accompany  grilled chicken marinated in Trader Joe's Soyaki sauce so I was needing something a bit asian in flavor but still something my youngest would eat.  This recipe was easy to make at the spur of the moment. It took only 15 minutes and the longest  part was cleaning and slicing the mushrooms.  I didn't have fresh garlic so made it without and everyone raved about this dish!! I will definitely make this again with lots of other entrees! It is flavorful but not overpowering so it will go well with many different things! Thank you for this recipe!!

This is pretty much the way I've made sauteed mushrooms most of my life, except I've never put garlic in them before. Gonna have to try that! Glad this is being shared...the first time I made them for my in-laws, they were gone almost before we sat down to eat!

My family of four literally inhaled these.  We doubled the amount of mushrooms but kept the other ingredients pretty much the same as the recipe for two (not fans of highly seasoned food).  They were delicious served over steaks last week and good as leftovers on a sandwich.  This week, I'm making them as a topping for pork chops.  High fives to SteveandAngela, and thank you for submitting the recipe.

This is really easy and turns out perfect every time. It is also easy to expand to match with whatever you are serving as a main dish (e.g. I added rosemary in one instance, thyme in another, and cajun seasoning in yet another.)

These were wonderful!  You'd never know there was soy sauce in them. I added some sliced onions to the mushrooms while cooking and used 3 tsp. of soy sauce. I used to make it the same way only used Worcestershire & soy sauce combined. They're much better with just the soy sauce. I'll be making them this way from now on. Thanks.

OMG, I saw this and I have been making this for years. I love my mushrooms and I sure wish I could buy LaChoy soy sauce by the gallon!! I was given a gallon can of KiKoman soy sauce one Christmas as a joke. Tried it, ended up giving it away. Must be LaChoy!

A good tasty side for any grilled meat... however these are very buttery... you might be able to get by with half the butter... i loved sauteed mushrooms

BLOWS my socks right out of the Earth's orbit! I've never had something with mushrooms (I LOVE shrooms!) that is this outstanding! Anyone can add any vegetable to this recipe, like bell peppers, broccoli, or basically ANYTHING and have it taste just as delectable! This is my favorite recipe ever! I also served it over wild rice, and it was amazing!

1-20-12:  Better than plain sauteed mushrooms.
4-11-12:  Second time around, it got a 'rave' when used as a 'mushroom soy sauce'.

Loved this!  I doubled the recipe because I had a bunch of mushrooms to use but I didn't double the soy sauce because I didn't have enough.  They were perfect.  This is my new favorite recipe!

simple, yet very tasty. I found that 1 teaspoon of soy sauce is salty enough for me. 2 is a little too much.

I followed the recipe exactly and I was impressed. For some reason my daughter did not care for them, so maybe some kids won't like them too much. These had such a good taste.

YUMMY, is all I can say.  I made these to go on top of "Seasoned Turkey Burgers" and put swiss cheese on top "reduced fat cheese" and they were very tasty.  I could of ate the mushrooms alone they are soooooo good.

Very good way to cook mushrooms! Mine were a little too strong because I accidently used a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon. But I'm sure if I had followed the directions exactly if would have been perfect.

I liked this recipe alright as is, but felt like the garlic kind of overwhelmed the subtle flavor of the mushrooms, so I made it a second time without it. So much better! Very similar to the sauteed mushrooms you get at steakhouses.

Absolutely delicious!  I did increase the soy sauce a bit, partly because of other reviews, partly because there was only a small amount left in the bottle so I just finished it off.

To quote my husband "these are shear perfection." I ended up making 3 8oz containers because he ate them faster than expected (and I wasn't even making them for him). My 10-month old daughter LOVES them as well!

Exactly as advertised...GREAT !  I doubled the recipe for guests and it was gone before I even got any.. good thing I tested as I cooked.  I might try adding onions next time...or, I might just make it the same way......

Since I'm vegetarian, I opted for these over brown rice instead of steak.  EXCELLENT!  I liked the simple, yummy sauce so well that I sauteed some asparagus the same way and it also rocked!

Amazing!  I didn't alter this recipe in the least, and there's really no need to.  I would definitely say go for more servings as this recipe can easily be polished off by one person.  Delicious.

The first time I made this, I misread the recipe and only made 2 servings for 7 people (rookie mistake!)  Needless to say, they didn't even make it out of the pan.  You would have thought they were candy...everyone, including my youngest, a professed mushroom hater, was circling in the kitchen like sharks, waiting to take another bite.  They begged me to make them again, so this time I got enough for 2 servings a piece.  I think they would have been happy had I just made them each a plateful and served nothing else.  Excellent, and THANKS for sharing such a great tasting, easy recipe!

A good snack. The recipe as-is was way too salty for my taste. Also, I've made it with fresh mushrooms and dried mushrooms. The texture difference is significant (as expected), and the fresh is much better.

These were good... I really like mushrooms and these didn't knock my socks off. The only change was to use olive oil instead of butter. I guess if I were to have served them on top of something (ie meat) they would have been better than just as a side dish. I'd try them again when I do a meat dish.

I givr it four stars only because I think this dish does mush better with another vegetable added in like red peppers or snow peas.  Other than that, it's a good go-to recipe that always comeso ut great.

To really get the most out this recipe, I add a tablespoon of oyster sauce too. It takes it to a whole new level.

Absolutely fabulous. I needed to use 1/2 a bell pepper too, so I diced that with the sliced mushrooms. Heavenly, and so easy! Will make this over and over; I'm looking forward to serving it over steamed rice; simple, delicious, and meatless...perfect.

I've made these mushrooms several times and I love them! They go great with a grilled steak. Most of all they are super easy to do. Try them, you wont be disappointed.

This was a quick and easy recipe with a great flavor. I served it with brown rice and grilled chicken. I thought the  plate needed some color so I added frozen green beans to the mushroom mixture and then added the soy sauce. I turned the topping into a side dish. My husband loved it. We ate every bit of it. I will be making this again.

Very simple way to use up the surplus mushrooms in my fridge before they went bad. I loved it, it's just such a shame no one else in my house likes mushrooms so I don't get to make it often. I highly recommend it.

I wish my mushrooms looked as carmelized as the ones on the recipe photo but mine looked like any other saut√©ed mushrooms.  The flavor was good but not spectacular.  I will probably make these again when I want a low carb veggie offering, just won't expect "Wow!"

Let me start by saying I'm not a huge mushroom fan.  I love the flavor they give other foods, but the texture is not pleasing to me.  That being said, I have to admit that this is the best recipe I've ever used for mushrooms to put on a nice Filet Mignon.  I didn't change a thing.  Thank you for this recipe!

Less fish sauce! But taste it to make sure the flavor is balanced. You want that savory taste but not stinging.

I love recipes that make me look like I know how to cook - this recipe was delicious! The only changes I made - first I cut the recipe in half thinking that it would be too much food. Later we wished that we‚Äôd cooked the whole 8 ounces of mushrooms. Second, I added in onions because my company wanted to try onions with the mushrooms. It was very good. Will definitely make it again.

Amazing!!!!! So so so good! My boyfriend who doesn‚Äôt like mushrooms tried them and absolutely loved them. Only thing I did different was instead of using raw garlic cloves, I used pre-minced garlic and did about 1 1/4 teaspoons.

This recipe works not just for mushrooms but for salmon too. It is kid approved, my picky eater son had 2 servings. I followed the recipe and added maybe a bit more garlic. The definitely soy sauce adds more flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

There are a lot of Sauteed Mushroom recipes on here, this was very simple and quick - perfect when you're working on many things at once...

The result were Sauteed Mushrooms that for such a simple recipe deserve to be cooked again

I'm a college student with a limited amount of ingredients to cook with. I bought some mushrooms last time I went to the store and they were starting to brown so I needed an easy recipe to make to get rid of them without wasting them. I found this and thought it would be easy.
I didn't have soy sauce or cloves of garlic. I substituted the garlic with 2 or so table spoons of garlic powder. The mushrooms turned out very tasty, but it was hard to taste the garlic powder, however I was okay with that since I was afraid I had put too much in.

Let me start off by saying I HATE MUSHROOMS but... these are delicious. I made this for my husband that loves mushrooms and after he took one bite he said I had to try them so after a little convincing from him I decided to try a lil bite and omg I had to get myself a whole serving it was so good. I'd like to say I'm now a mushroom lover. It that's a far stretch.. this tho omg. Love them ??

I have made the exact recipe many times to great fanfare! Tonight I did a great, lighter version! I used baby Bellas instead of white mushrooms, 1 tablespoon instead of 2 of margarine (not butter-we are kosher so to serve with meat it must be margarine!) and I added some caramelized onions. Absolutely DELISH!

Easy to make and did taste good, took others recommendation about the amount of Soy. Two teaspoons doesn't seem like a lot but it is. I used one teaspoon and it was plenty. Thanks for the recipe.

I used this recipe with Brussels sprouts instead of mushrooms. It worked. I used fresh Brussels sprouts, halved. I increased the butter slightly and it was the perfect side dish for our pork chop dinner.

Loved it! Was concerned that it only had 2tbsp of soy sauce, but it seemed to be the perfect amount when I finally had the end result. Yummy! Will definitely make again!

Absolutely the BEST mushroom I had. And I cook for a living.  So easy.  Serving them tonight with prime rib, hasselback potatoes, and green beans made salt pork.  Will definitely make them again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely loved this and the second time I added some fresh grated ginger (equal parts garlic and ginger) to the mix. Good with many proteins but also good on their own.  May try Sichuan Pepper in the future.

Followed the recipe exactly as it's written and the mushrooms tasted great! I ate them with a cup of steamed rice and some Sambal Oelek chili paste and I absolutely loved it. I will definitely be making this again real soon. Thank you for sharing this tasty and simple recipe!

Delish! I made it with canola oil instead of the butter since we wanted a non-dairy (kosher pareve) version. Hot, they were addictive. I served them cold for a meal and they were still a big hit. Not as good as they are hot, but still yummy.

So good! I made this exactly as the recipe says, and served it as a vegetable (as in a serving bowl full) with steak and baked potatoes.  It got all eaten and two people asked for the recipe.  The soy sauce gives it such good flavor as well as a nice deep browned color.

This recipe was ok. Not great but not terrible. I think I did not like garlic with my mushrooms, even though I love garlic. Next time I saute mushrooms, I will do it the 'old fashioned way' of just using butter, salt, pepper, and a touch of red wine. I am removing from my 'favorites.'

This was just the savory side dish I was looking for.  So simple!  I did use 1 Tbsp soy sauce and 1 Tbsp worcestershire since it's a side dish to meatloaf with a good dose of worcestershire.  It came out beautifully that way, but it would be just as delicious as written.

While I didn't have it (not a fan of mushrooms!), my boyfriend said it was very good. I gave it only 4 stars because it wasn't really a sauce, more sauce coated mushrooms. Also, my boyfriend didn't (literally) like his plate clean like he does when he loves a dish. However it was quick and easy to make with ingredients I have on hand and a sneaky way to bump up the veggie content of a meal.

This was really good.   Heated up about a tbs of canola with a tbs of coconut oil. Threw in half a sliced onion and about a pound of sliced mushrooms. Cooked about halfway and added about 2 tbs soy sauce and about two cloves chopped garlic and seasoned with ground pepper. Cook till desired.

Made it exactly as the recipe is wtitten the first time. DH wanted a little less garlic so the next time I used one frozen garlic cube and added a splash of creme sherry at the very end to deglaze the pan.  Perfect for us!

We like our mushrooms a little sweet, so I sprinkled a little sugar over top while they cooked...Awesome!
We ate them on top of our steak and on the side too!
Everyone loved them!
Thanks for this adding this recipe

Been making this forever, hadn't seen a recipe for it.  I discovered this way of cooking mushrooms a long time ago while trying to make something else.  The ultimate sauteed mushrooms.   Like others said, two tsp soy sauce is just right, too much will  ruin it.  Thanks!

These were ok. If you like fried mushrooms than these will still be enjoyable like they were for me. I don't feel the amount of soy and garlic recommended impacted the taste a lot, if at all. Give these a try, as most reviews are higher than mine and maybe I missed something, but I might recommend being a bit more liberal with your garlic and possibly the soy. That being said, you can't go wrong with fried mushrooms!

I made this as part of my husband's birthday dinner because he loves mushrooms.  I followed the recipe as written. They were fantastic! In fact, I do not like mushrooms at all and usually omit them from any recipe but these were delicious!

Really quick!  Really easy! Very tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly - with one exception.  I used minced garlic from a jar (like you get in the produce section) instead of fresh garlic.  I think I will try it with baby portobellos and see how that turns out.  I never would have thought to use soy sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

Not your usual taste in cooked mushrooms. They were better then most of the recipes that I have tried. I would use the low sodium soy sauce for a lighter taste.

Great simple but elegant mushroom accompaniment to steak....Did it all according to the recipe except that I added a splash of balsamic vinegar about halfway through that cooking process. Adds just a bit of sweetness to the finished dish!

Did it with shitakes. It was better than the main dish! Tho, I added a couple of ingredients of my own - ginger and sesame seeds. Will definitely be making this dish many more times!

Perfect side dish for a mushroom lover! I love sauteed mushrooms and this just adds a little extra flavor.  Not much of a soy sauce fan, either, but it cooked out and added just the right kick.

This was really yummy as written, but I modified it by adding in a few tablespoons of the ingredients found in another mushroom recipe from this site (Mushrooms Berkeley) and it was wonderful!

This was fabulous and so, so easy! I've made this two times now and will make it again every time I make our teriyaki marinated steaks. Mouthwateringly delicious. Use thick cut mushrooms for more "goodness." lol

This was tasty and easy, but cooked down too much.  I'll make it again, but using a full pound of mushrooms, even for two of us..

Made this tonight with thick sliced white mushrooms to compliment our baked potatoes. I'm the only mushroom eater in my house so I halved the recipe but wish I hadn't! They were delicious! I made them exactly as directed and, like so many others suggested,  I will add a bit more soy sauce next time.  Thanks for  sharing!

This recipe was easy and fabulous!!! The only change I made to it was to saute about 1/3 of a chopped Vidalia onion in the pan with the butter before adding the mushrooms. My husband couldn't get enough of these to eat with our steaks and sweet potatoes for dinner! Will make again. Took so little time to whip this up, this recipe is sure to be in heavy rotation in this household!

These were terrific! Served the mushrooms over some wild mushroom ravioli. Simply delicious. Will put this one on the weekly must haves.
Second try: I was making chicken piccata and used capers instead of the soy sauce in the mushrooms.  Wow, that made a whole new flavor. I now prefer capers instead of the soy sauce. But, both are terrific.

I didn't think I would like the soya sauce, but it has worked well for me in meals with an oriental theme.  For a more general recipe for saut√©ed mushrooms that  applies to a broader range of plates, I prefer Pat's Mushroom saut√© using balsamic vinegar, also found on this site.

These are awesome.  I skipped the pepper due to an allergy, but otherwise the same.  Used salted butter.  My self-professed mushroom hating husband devoured these!

I made these just now. I used sliced portabella mushrooms (all I had). Added a tiny bit of onion, few strips of roasted red peppers & a little spinach. Turned out quite good.

I have been making these mushrooms for a while...we LOVE them and never have steak without these mushrooms to accompany it.  One thing I do a little different is adding about 2 teaspoons of worchester sauce to it as well.

The only thing to say is INCREDIBLE !   Used light soy sauce and it was perfect as written.  Sliced the mushrooms and used these as a hamburger topping will use button this weekend and serve with steak.

Absolutely delicious! I sometimes add a splash of worcestershire sauce just for fun, but it's great as-is. My husband doesn't like mushrooms, but my daughter and I can go through a whole recipe in one sitting.

The flavor was great for these, just like at a steak house. I didn't cook the button mushrooms as long as I should have (although I did cook as long as stated in the recipe) so although I think this could be a 5 star I have to give it a 4 for now.

I love this! I've been making these since I was a kid and first in the kitchen! I usually use lower cal butter and low sodium soy sauce. It's also GREAT with red wine vinegar if you like a little zing/tang! :-)

Simple and delicious. I left off the pepper and garlic since there was plenty of those in my mashed potatoes and roast I served this with. Definitely the type of soy and amount really make this dish.

The only change I would make to this recipe is adding more soy sauce as others suggested. I started out with the 2t as recommended but it definitely needed more. This recipe is incredibly simple and delicious and pairs well with heartier recipes.  Lite soy sauce works just as well in this recipe as regular with no taste difference or need to add more salt.    Another reviewer suggested turning the burner off and covering when there was a bit of liquid left to allow perfect timing with a main dish and this really worked for me.  The mushrooms sat in a covered pan with no heat for about 15 minutes while my chicken entree finished cooking and they were perfect and very warm when I was ready for them.    I've tried this recipe with many different mushroom cuts (whole, sliced, quartered etc.) and they all work great with the same cooking instructions.

Made as directed but used granulated garlic instead of cloves. The nice even dusting was savored in every bite. Fantastic flavor!

These were great!!! I had some mushrooms I had to use up & decided to try this recipe. We had them along side BBQ steak because these were a last minute thing but next time I think I'll serve them on top of regular steak...they were great!

I do not like mushrooms, so I did not try this recipe.  But my husband and our company did really enjoy this recipe.  It was very quick, especially using the already sliced mushrooms.  Will definitely use again as a quick, tasty side dish.  Went very well with our asian pork tenderloin and quinoa.

Really easy to prepare and quite tasty.  The soy sauce gives off a salty taste but they were still quite yummy.

This recipe is SO awesome!! We have been looking for a good sauteed mushroom recipe that matched the ones at Outback Steakhouse for years and we finally found one!!  This is a wonderful topping to a grilled steak.  My husband is in HEAVEN!!

Yum!  Can also be made on the BBQ grill right next to your steaks.  Just make a heavy foil tray and be sure to fold up the sides to keep the liquid in -- keeps the house cool in the summer.

Bf likes a dish very similar to this--only difference is I use cooking spray and don't add garlic.  So I thought I'd try making this and see if he objected to the differences.  He didn't even seem to notice that I'd changed a few things around on him  & ate them up w/o complaint. I don't like mushrooms so didn't try, but if he likes it I'm happy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Love, love love this recipe! Super easy and delicious to boot. The only thing I did that wasn't called for was add in 1 medium yellow onion, halved and sliced. We ate this atop steak that I marinated using the Sassy Steak Marinade from this site. The combination was amazing. Thanks so much for a great and simple recipe!

Forget the side dish...these were so good I ate them all by themselves...and I think they would also make a great topping for a loaded baked potato.

I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't sure what to expect with this recipes, because of the mushroom and soy sauce combination. They were amazing. I added onions though, because I can never have mushrooms without onions. I will admit though, I was experimenting and added some green beans I had boiled. Big Mistake! I'm definitely going to make this again, only mushrooms and onions.

Always a winner.  As a vegan, I use the non-dairy margarines, but even then, the entire (meat eating) family loves them.

fantastic! I added a squeeze of lemon juice to the mix and used low sodium soy sauce. I used baby bella mushrooms. Remember not to crowd the mushrooms so they brown nicely.

These were so simple to prepare and quite tasty so I'll rate it a 5 - but if you have more time I would suggest Balsamic Mushrooms or Mushroom Saute from this site - I think they both have a bit more of a "Wow" factor to them.  Thanks submitter - this is a keeper.

I made this for family and friends last night along with the recipe from this sight, Amazing Tenderloin in the Slow Cooker. Along with boiled new potatoes (tossed in butter, parsley, salt and pepper), corn and warm sourdough bread. The juice from the roast was so good it went on everyone's potatoes and bread. Yummo!

I sauteed onions in the beginning for a little bit before adding in mushrooms, and (maybe it was the onions) it tasted a bit bland. I increased the soy sauce and added a dash of sugar, and it tasted great! Next time I will cut down on the butter, the juice from the mushrooms/onions and the butter added together was becoming too "watery/oily" for me.

These are great! I serve them over steak and pork chops. Sometimes I chop an onion and that add to the mix as well. No changes necessary.

Oh my!  These are awesome. Thankfully nobody else in the family likes mushrooms, so I got them all to myself! The only thing was that I couldn't wait for the steak to be ready - and ate all of the mushrooms beforehand. lol  I used portabella mushrooms - very tasty!  Thank you.

Fantastic!  Made as is.  When I served supper (turkey tenderloin), my mom was visiting and she said, "what are the mushrooms for?" My reply: "to eat!"  She thought it was strange that I put a bowl of *just* mushrooms out, yet she was the one that licked that bowl clean!  A keeper!

When eating steak, I usually cook my mushrooms in the steak's drippings; however, this was so quick, easy, and delicious that I think I will use this recipe from now on instead. It was very good!

I bought a huge bag of fresh mushroom, like three pounds. I pickled about 2 pounds with a recipe I found here.  Next, I made this recipe. Since I had a jwynurmoiuse amount I used a stick of butter and two teaspoons of chopped garlic. The liquid from the mushrooms and butter would have been delicious on its own. I added the soy sauce, a little of each lite soy and regular soy sauce.  You be be the cooking king in your household when you make this....I should know....I am king here for now....lol

These mushrooms are AWESOME!  I have made them for two different family events and everyone loved them.  I have requests to bring them to the next family gathering too!  I even had a lady who doesn't care for mushrooms try them because they looked so good...and she liked them!  I followed the recipe exactly and used reduced sodium soy sauce.  Would highly recommend to any mushroom lover!

I've been looking for the ultimate mushroom recipe to duplicate something I tasted at a restaurant.  This is it!  I did add more soy sauce, as others suggested, but found it a little too salty.  It could be the brand or just my palate, but next time, I'm going to stick with the numbers...except, I sprayed on more butter to keep from burning.  I was using an electric stove.

I added more soy sauce after tasting these, but they were still excellent.  Maybe start with 2 tablespoons of soy sauce instead?

These are just plain THE BEST. I could make a whole meal out of just these mushrooms. But I did serve them over Honey Lime Pork chops from this site. They made the meal.

So glad to see this in print because I lost it some years back.   This was our favorite way to cook mushrooms - wonderful with steak.  Thanks again - going in my file right now.

Awesome recipe. I know add soy sauce to other foods to beef up the flavour such as onions.
