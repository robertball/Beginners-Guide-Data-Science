These are excellent. I accidentally used apple cider vinegar instead of apple cider - an ingredient not available in my area- but I only used about 1.5 tbsp.  Oops. Anyway, these are delicious!

Tasty recipe. We subâ€™d out all-purpose and whole wheat flours for almond and spelt (what we had in pantry). Reduced sugar by two tablespoons. Used apple cider vinegar (what we had) instead of apple cider, 1/4 cup as recipe noted, and came out fine. Overall muffin was super light and sweet enough. Recommend not using muffin cup liners are there is less to eat! These are inhaled four to five at a time!
