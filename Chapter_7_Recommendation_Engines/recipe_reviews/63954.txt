This was good. I want to mention that if your gunna use a pre-made keebler crust, you should cut the cooking time down to about 30-35 minutes. And if using premade crusts, this recipe is enough to make 2 cheesecakes! The first time I made this my cake burned because I baked it for the rec. 55 minutes = ( . Now I know it says to cookit that long because the original size of the cake is alot thicker than if you use a premade crust; hence what  I said about this making 2 cakes.

I loved this cheesecake! I'm a fan of firmer cheesecakes and this one was fabulous. For me, the lemon did not over power the recipe, but I did forget to have my sour cream room temp, so it didn't brown at all, and it cracked later in the fridge.

I have two tips to avoid cracking in cheesecakes. One is to not over beat your cream cheese. The other is to bake your cheesecake until almost all the jiggle in the middle is gone, then turn off your oven and leave it in there with the door slightly open. The gradual cool down helps to prevent cracking verses immediately putting it into the fridge.

I have been making this for years.  I do not add the sour cream and cherries though.  For the holidays, I make white chocolate rose leaves; just melt white chocolate and spread onto clean real rose leaves, place in the refrigerator for 10- 15 minutes and peal leaves off, place on top of cheesecake. I also make miniature cheesecakes via the miniature cheesecake pan.  The small ones are great for parties.

Delicious and creamy.  I made a vanilla version - used 1 tsp vanilla and left out the lemon.  Used a chocolate crumb crust.  Also, did not have any sour cream and used vanilla yogurt - it actually was good! although I would use sour cream if I had it.  I would make it again...hey, this is the lemon cheesecake I always make and I didn't recognize it!  It's good.

tried five times so far this recipe, loved it all the time. the last i made alteration, instead of full-fat cream cheese, i used light cream cheese. Even with halved fat, it still turned beautifully!. I put halved strawberry and mandarin oranges(both dried first on tissue paper to remove excess liquid), after the bake was over, then glaced it with colorless jelly (instead of gelatin, i used jelly made from seaweed. i package/envelope with a cup of water, boiled). It looked (and tasted) like cheesecake i bought at hotels only this time the cost is a fift :).

I would definitely recommend this recipe. It was a very good cheesecake. Instead of the springform pan I used Keebler graham cracker crusts and the recipe yielded 2 cheesecakes. I split the cup of sour cream between the two.

This was my first selfmade New York Style Cheesecake ever. It was certainly good but not perfect. I think 4 eggs are too much. The filling had a slightly crumbly mouthfeel altough it looked super-creamy.

I made the NY version this cheesecake for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it--so much so that now I have to make TWO for Christmas!! I mixed a little chocolate syrup & coffee syrup into some of the batter and swirled it thru the rest in the pan--awesome, easy Cappuccino Cheesecake!

I made my very first REAL Cheesecake lastnight for today (thanksgiving). This recipe turned out wonderfully! My family was thrilled and i was very satisfied! I used the New York style version, and thats a REAL cheese cake, Thick and cramy, without being overly sweet... It was GREAT! Even my toughest critic (my 15 month old girl) LOVED it :)

Not our type of cheesecake.  Too much like a lemon bar but spongy.  Not exactly creamy either.  We will not make this recipe again.

Very nice cheesecake, it was light and creamy, but not to fluffy. You knew it was a cheesecake-but not quite as dense as a New York style. We preferred vanilla over lemon. I scraped the seeds from one smallish vanilla bean and added about 2 teaspoons vanilla to my "batter". For the topping I used whole fat greek yogert with vanilla and about 2 tablespoons agave nectar. The cake didn't crack and looked beautiful! BTW ,I have an 8-inch springform pan and my cake took about 65 minutes to set at 300 degrees. We topped our cheesecake with strawberries in sauce.

This was my first homemade cheese cake.  I don't like sour cream, so I didn't use any.  I didn't have any pie pans so I used an old handleless pan.  I added some vanilla extract.  It rised all the way to the top of the pan.  I didn't use a water bath and it didn't crack or spill over.  I think it was beginners luck because it is deeelicious!!!  I will be making it again but with chocolate next time.  I recommend this recipe to anyone who like me can't even cook.

I'm still waiting to take a full bite, but as I was putting it in the fridge I snagged it with my finger and the little piece i got tasted awesome! This is my very first attempt at making cheesecake and I'm so excited that it came out so pretty! I always ready everyone's reviews before I make something on here so I can get advice on how to make it easier or better. I did the NY style version Except I traded 1 tbsp vanilla for the lemon juice and I left it at 3 eggs. Someone said the texture was off with 4 eggs. I'm not a fan of lemon so I went with a lot of the reviews that suggested vanilla. I also read one that said be careful to not over beat your eggs so that your cake won't crack. I only did it till everything look mixed and stopped quickly when it did. Another thing I read to keep your cake from cracking was to keep in in the oven after the time is up, but turn the oven off and crack the door so that it would gradually cool. I left it there for about 45 minutes and then put it in the fridge. I did have a lot of condensation so I took it out after a while and dabbed it with a paper towel. So far no cracks and it looks fabulous for my first try at cheesecake.

My son loved it.  He says it was better than the no bake cheesecake that we usually make.  I am going to have to agree with him.  The best recipe ever.

This recipe was GOOD--but not perfect. We tried it without the sour cream on top; very smooth and Dad said it was a 9 out of 10. Would make it again, but with a topping--raspberry would be good, coffee grounds add good texture and subtle flavor!

Awesome recipe.  I added a few raspberries to the filling to give it an extra red visual blend as well as more raspberry taste.

Came out very well!

Perfect.  I don't even like cheesecake and this was good!  My husband asked me to make a raspberry swirl cheesecake for him, so I simply swirled in some raspberry pie filling.  Delicious.

I've finally found a cheesecake recipe I like! This recipe lives up to it's name of "Creamy". It was both easy to make and delicious, one of the rare times that I haven't had to throw out an uneaten portion. I'm definitely going to be making this cheesecake again!

I used to make this cheesecake ALL the time when my kids lived at home. I had lost the recipe and tried all kind of cheesecakes and my youngest kept saying "yeah this is good but not like the one you used to make" and she just was not happy with any of them. WELL, finally I found this recipe here and it is the same, I just put the sour cream in the cheesecake instead on top (did this by mistake the first time I made it and since we liked it I just kept doing it :) )Now my daughter is happy and I can make her and my stepsons favorite cheesecake!! Thank you

Add me to the 5 star list!  I have made this several times (using two premade graham cracker or short bread crusts instead of making my own in a deep dish pan). I pretty much follow the recipe, except I just mix in the sour cream at the begining with everything else and bake for about 35 mins. I let it cool in the oven for an hour or so(I usually crack the oven open to speed the cooling) and then on top of the oven for another hour, then into the refrigerator or freezer.  No cracking issues ever. Thanks for posting!

LOVED this recipe. Never made a cheese cake in my life and can't find a good NY Cheese cake anywhere where I live. Pretty easy to make and so delicious. One thing I added in some lemon rind for a bit more of a lemon flavour, topped it with a strawberry coulis and grated choc... everyone loved it. One thing is that it took more that 1hr 10mins to cook.... took almost 2 hours until the giggling stopped. (hence the 4 stars) but still tasted great and didn't crack. will def make again.

No one liked it. Most of it was thrown away. I think the lemon overpowered it. I would try the New York style instead.

The first time I made this I let it stay in the pan until it was cold but when I tried to take it out of the pan it fell apart. The second time I made it I took it out as soon as it was cooled enough for me to touch, and it turned out a lot better.

I've use this recipe for YEARS. Everyone loves it. I love the sour cream on top and no fruit. Perfect on its own.

Follow it, it works. People will have different opinions on flavours since it is so subjective but some of the complaints against this recipe are not even for this one they seem to be confusing it with another recipe. Such as, too much vanilla but it does not call for it, too many eggs well it requires 3 not the 4 they mention so be cautious about the complaints with this one they are just confused some of the time. I t works and works well.

Very simple.  Did not crack.  I had all the ingredients on hand.  Used 3 eggs. I omitted the sour cream part, simply because I did not want to take it out of the oven too soon for fear it may crack.  I don't know maybe I will use sour cream next time.  Topped with cherry filling, and it was absolutely terrific.  My husband and kids loved it.  Very satisfying.

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving. I made some changes because I didn't want a "lemon" cheesecake. I only added 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of lemon juice & 1 and a 1/2 tablespoons of vanilla extract. I also left the sour cream out of the recipe. It turned out so good with a cherry topping :)

I used the NewYork style recipe and it was perfection in a pan! This is just like a beloved Los Angeles Times recipe I had from the early 80's, but lost. I cooked recommended time, and tried others' recommendation to turn off oven and wait 20 minutes before cracking the oven door and letting cheesecake sit for probably 11/2 to 2 hours. Absolutely no cracks, a beautiful looking and delicious tasting cake.

As a experience cook baker, I followed the recipe exactly,  I was not a happy person after. I did 2 cheesecakes,  first starred to brown fast, I put a foil tent on making sure it didnt touch, but as it started to rise while baking it made contact and got stuck on the foil. The 2nd had a big brown spot in the middle. The flavor while mixing was awesome, afterwards baked, bland
 I think I will stick to my no baked cheesecake I perfected for Thanksgiving. I'm not giving up on baked cheesecake just yet. But this recipe needs alot of tweaking.

I used this for the topping, tastes great:

While the cheesecake is cooling, whisk the sour cream, sugar and vanilla together until smooth. Once the cheesecake has cooled for approximately 15 minutes, pour the sour cream topping over top. Using a rubber spatula or offset spatula, smooth out the surface.

It took an extra hour to bake, in fact, I raised the temperature to 350 deg F the last half hour. 
I put on a fruit topping.
It tastes very good and creamy. 
I will make this again.

This is my go-to cheesecake recipe. I’ve made it a dozen times at least. I’m not a cheesecake fan but my husband absolutely loves it when I make this. Now, i don’t add the sour cream on top, I mix a big dollop in with the recipe. That’s just my tweak after making the base recipe. I also add a splash of aged vanilla.

This came out great. I'm keto so I used almond flour to make the crust... And I use evaporated milk plus erythritol instead of condensed milk... You can Google a recipe to replace condensed milk with evaporated milk... And then I used erythritol instead of sugar for the cheesecake. It was Sublime. I also took half of it and added cocoa powder and mixed that in because I really like marble cheesecakes... So it came out wonderfully and I highly recommend it and I will be using this recipe again in the future

It was ok but not my kind of cheesecake. I think I would have preferred the New York style better. This one has a kind of slimy texture and is a bit sour tasting. I couldn't bring myself to just leave the plain sour cream on top (seems so strange to me) so I mixed it right into the rest of the batter. My 10 year old son loved it but I probably won't make this version again.

My family and I love this recipe which I only make around the holidays. It's creamy, smooth and luscious as long as you follow the recipe! 

One reviewer commented "I made the New York style twice now and I think that 4 eggs might be a bit too much. I followed the recipe to the letter. "

Sorry, but I had to laugh considering the recipe only calls for 3 eggs, not 4 as the reviewer used (twice apparently). :)

To that reviewer, I'd say try it again with 3 eggs, and you'll award it 5 stars!

I followed the recipe to the letter. The flavor was pretty delicious, smooth and creamy. It's my first cheesecake and everyone who tried some was very impressed. Great recipe for beginners!
To prevent cracking, I placed a glass 9 x 13 on the bottom rack with a 1/2" of water and viola! Perfection!
I'll update my review the next time I make this but it will be using 3 eggs and a smidge of lemon zest in addition to lemon juice.

Very easy recipe. Good results. I omitted the lemon juice and added vanilla. I didn't do the sourcream topping since I'll be adding a rasperry mousse layer to the top. I baked mine in a 9 inch spring form pan and it only took 40 minutes to bake. Any longer and it would've been overcooked.

This is a solid,  basic baked cheesecake recipe. 
One thing I do change though is the extra sugar added to the crust. It seems every cheesecake recipe I come across, whether baked or unbaked that is posted by North American's, includes sugar in the crust. We just don't do that in Australia. Its just excessive and unnecessary. The biscuits are more than sweet enough with their own added sugar to cover the sweetness angle. 

As for the filling. I like to use lemon juice, and add about 1tb of lemon zest as well. This does make it more strongly lemon flavoured, so by all means, if you want a cheesecake that tastes sweet but doesn't have a particularly lemon flavour, don't add the zest. 

All in all, a first class recipe, thanks!

This was awful. It was OK before I baked it. Not what I was expecting.

I made this recipe as mini cheese cake bites in a cupcake wraps and came out wonderful! After the first 20 mins i just watched them so they wouldn't brown too much! I topped them with cherry filling and Vola!

I made this for a family party last night and my mom said it was the best baked cheesecake she'd ever had. It was nice and moist, just the right consistency, and had a beautifully rich flavour.
