I submited this recipe in a few years back. The reason why it took so long to make it was I used a towel to squeeze the water out of the cabbage and the onions. I made it again and I cut the recipe in 1/4. Instead of using towels to strain the water out I used my salad spinner. From start to finish it only took me 3 hours to make. It was so much easier this way and it made 6 pints.
 Try this in tuna salad instead of relish. I love it on Lima Beans and rice too.

This is a wonderful sweet relish!  A very nice change from the traditional green.  I did not roast my peppers and just added them fresh.  Since there is so much sugar, I really think it will last as long as green, in the fridge.  I made this recipe for Christmas gifts and everyone raved about this relish and asked for for the recipe.  It definately outshone the sweet green!  I am making it again this summer, too many requests for it!
Here is a hint...chew gum when working with the onions, helps with the tears!

This was a very good basic relish recipe.  I found it a little on the sweet side, but not much sweeter than a typical Bread and Butter pickle recipe.  

I did make a few changes, but not substantial ones that would alter the flavor.  First:  I didn't want the texture of ground/grated onions, so I diced them instead.  Since they were less finely chopped, I upped the volume to 50 cups instead of 40.  Second: I used red and green peppers, and only used 8 since mine were very large and heavy.  And third:  I put the spices into a cloth square since I didn't want the seeds to remain in the relish after it was completed.
Fourth:  I used regular yellow onions (given to me free).  

I did not bother trying to squeeze every drop of joice out the vegetables with towels, instead draining them in batches in the colander.  There was a little liquid left in the bottom of the onion bowl after I finished, but not enough to dilute the brine. I did squeeze those handfuls before I tossed them into the pot.

Final product yielded 10 quarts of an attractive and tasty, moderately sweet relish.  I'm getting ready to make another batch with purple cabbage and we will see how it turns out.

Kind of an odd flavor. Wasn't a big hit with the family.

My whole family and I love this relish.  Yes, it is time consuming to make but it is THAT GOOD!.  I made two batches of it last year and I have made my first batch about 3 weeks ago.  I am getting ready to make my second batch for this year.  It makes a great Christmas gift or anytime gift for that matter.  It makes 21 pints and is so awesome!
