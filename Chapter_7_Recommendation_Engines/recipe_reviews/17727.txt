We made this recently and it was a big hit, even with my kids.   We used 3 large skinless and boneless chicken breasts and used a lot less marinade- about 1/2 cup lime juice and a little less than 1/2 cup olive oil but the same amount of spices and it was perfect.

This chicken is so good - thank you Tina!  I used boneless chicken breasts (a little over a pound) that I pounded down to about 1/2 inch thick.  For the rub, I added 1/4 tsp. of chili powder and 1/4 tsp. of cumin.  I put everything into a ziploc bag added the olive oil (1/2 cup), garlic, lime juice (1 cup), and cilanto along with some lime zest.  I let this marinate for 24 hours.  I didn't bother boiling the excess marinade - there wasn't much left as the chicken soaked it up plus I usually just baste it during grilling.  This chicken was moist, had a nice kick to it and was delicious!

Very good, but my family asked me to make it with boneless chicken breasts next time.

The flavour of the chicken is fantastic!  I used a whole chicken and butterflied it down the back.  I have also used boneless  skinless chicken breasts.  The chicken is so  tender!  I will be using this over and over again.  I had a 3 lb chicken and found half of the lime and oil was enough.  Didn't cut down on the other ingredients though. I used bottled lime juice and it was just fine.

Mmmmm.... So good!  I used less olive oil than called for and also left out the cilantro (allergy) and this was fantastic!  I did marinate the chicken for more than 24 hours.  Served it over Strawberry Spinach Salad from this site.  The strawberries and lime complement each other wonderfully. Thanks Tina!

I have been making this recipe for years - yet have failed to mention how amazing it was to the allrecipes world!  Thank you for sharing a perfect marinade!  Instead of whole chicken pieces, I use boneless skinless thighs or breast tenders and it is perfect every time!  Tina - this is the BEST!

To cut down on the preparation time for this recipe, I used 1/2 fresh squeezed lime juice, and 1/2 "Reallime" juice. It was very moist and delicious!

12/7/09 I made & reviewed back in July. I made it again this weekend and marinated it longer - 5 hours - and it was a little too tangy. I think I will cut back on the oil next time. Still a great recipe I'll make again and again.

7/8/09 - This was fantastic! I used boneless chicken breasts (adjusted grill time), kept the same ratio of juice to oil, marinated 2 hours - super great flavor! I reduced the reserved marinade by half and used as final glaze. Thanks for the deliciousness Tina!

Very good, super easy, and flavorful. We went with 1 tsp. of red pepper instead of 1/2 for a little extra zip.

I love to use this chicken left over for chicken tacos.  I also marinate overnight and omit cilantro.

Excellent taste! I only used a 1/2 cup of olive oil and a 1/2 cup of lime juice from concentrate. The taste went all the way through and every bite was great. I used chicken breasts sliced to about 3 oz each. I served it with Quick Black Beans and Rice from this site as well. It was a great combo!

This was the most delicious chicken I think I've ever had. I upped the amount of cayenne a bit and omitted the cilantro, since I'm not a fan. It was extremely flavorful and tangy. Great recipe!

I've got an old "Kabob-it" machine to make indoor Kabobs with. This recipe
made with cubed breast & thighs was simply yummy! I tweaked it with a pinch 
Savory and Sage and it became one of my new favorites.

This chicken is delicious!  It did take lots of
limes to get 1 1/2 cups fresh juice, but i think it was
well worth it!  YUM!

This was great although it was time consuming squeezing the limes. I used seasoned salt and "kicked it up a notch" with a famous tv chef's southwest seasoning.

I've made this several times and my whole family loves it. I use skinless boneless chicken breasts only, and when you pierce them as recommended they absorb the marinade and are so flavorful. I cut the cooking time a lot with boneless breasts, it was more like 10 minutes on each side.  We even used the left over boiled marinade as sauce. This is very good with lime cilantro rice, they compliment each other well. Can't wait to make it again. Thanks Tina for such a great recipe!

Yummy! It was too cold outside to use the grill so I cooked it in the oven. I made these measurement changes: used 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breast, 1/2 C fresh lime juice, 1/2 C EVOO, 1 tsp minced garlic, 1/2 tsp each paprika & chili powder (I didn't have cayenne pepper) - leaving all the other ingredients & measurements as the recipe lists them. I was pressed for time & only got to marinate for about 10 min. I browned the chicken on the stovetop then placed it in an 8x8 baking dish, then heated the marinade in the same pan on the stovetop. Cooked the chicken, uncovered with about half of the marinade, in the oven at 400 for about 20 min. Added the rest of the marinade, covered with foil for another 20 min. It was unbelievably tender and juicy. We topped it with a peach salsa. Very yummy!

This was really really good - I made the marinade and then put it with the chicken in a ziplock bag and froze it until I needed it for a BBQ - fantastic taste.

I actually marinated this too long.  Dinner was pushed ahead and it had been sitting in the fridge for 24 hours.  Was a bit too "limey" but I'm positive that it would have been fantastic if I had let it marinade for only a few hours.

I honestly didn't like the chicken by itself very much, but I did really enjoy it when I used the leftovers in chicken tortilla soup. It gave it more flavor and was very enjoyable.

A little time consuming with respect to squeezing fresh limes. Served it first time to a dinner party of eight and all raved about it.

I recently made this amazing recipe but tweaked the ingredients a bit. I used chicken tenderloins that I'd cut into 1" pieces instead of a whole chicken, and I omitted the cilantro because I didn't have any on hand. I dredged the tenderloins in the dry ingredients, and then put into a large plastic bag and coated with the wet ingredients. I let it marinate for about 90 minutes and then pan-fried them and served over romaine lettuce with cherry tomatoes and Ken's ranch dressing. My husband has never requested a SALAD from me before, but he has been begging for this ever since! Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This was okay, but not my favorite. I used 3 chicken breasts, cut them into strips, cut everything in half, replaced the cayenne pepper with paprika and chili powder, and cooked it on the stove.

Excellent recipe. I only used boneless chicken breasts and put the pieces over fettucine alfredo.  The chicken was excellent with and without the pasta.  I will make this again.

I tried this over the weekend at our first summer cook out. I marinated the chicken the day before and did as instructed, poking the chicken with a fork. Wow! It's yummy and the lime will make your cheeks pucker! I'm making it again this week.

Fantastic!  I did cut the liquids in half (but only used 3 chicken breasts) and still had tons leftover.  Served with sour cream and fresh guac, with black bean and corn salad.  Delish!! (the kids put it on tortillas!)

Very simple and bold flavors.  My second attempt I used margarita mix instead of the lime juice.  I tried this with whole chicken breasts, but tenderized with puncture style meat tenderizer before marinating.  The margarita mix caramelizes nicely on a hot grill...top with some homemade salsa picante and it tastes great!

Love cilantro so this was a no brainer! I was a bit low on lime juice so add some OJ. I had to bake the chicken because it decided to rain after 10 dry days! I broiled it a bit to finish it off. Can't wait to actually get to grill it. Thanks!

This dish was good, but previous reviewers raved more than I'm going to. I thought the salt/pepper combo was just right. It had a kick, but not too spicy. However, the sourness of the lime stood out too much.  I couldn't taste the cilantro at all.  I probably wouldn't go out of my way to make it again unless I had ingredients that had to be used up.

I tried this recipe this past weekend and I cannot say enough about it.  I made kabobs with them by using 3 large chicken breasts, left them in the marinade for 2 hours and then grilled them with pieces of red and green bell peppers.  I didn't bother boiling the leftover marinade at all and they were so moist and delicious.  By the way, I only used ½ cup of olive oil and ½ of bottled lime juice and it was plenty.

It made a great marinate.  I added honey and significantly reduced the olive oil (to maybe 2T).  While I was grilling, I brought the extra marinade to a boil, thickened it with a little corn starch, and then served as a sauce.

Maybe I did something wrong but I marinated 3hours and this was so tart, it was hard to eat. I really didn't taste any other flavors but the tartness of the lime. With so many great recipes on this site, I don't think I'll be making this again.

My husband and I thought this was good. It was very easy to make. I marinaded it for 4 hours and it probably would have been better if I'd let it sit over night. It was a bit salty for our liking.

We make this all the time and everyone asks for the recipe!  We use boneless, skinless chicken beasts and cut them into small pieces that will fit on a skewer.  Marinate overnight and soak your skewers for 1/2 hour and your all set.  We have done it for parties with 50+ people and it cooks quick and is a crowd pleaser!!!

The chicken was flavorful and moist.  However, I didn't love the acidic taste from the lime.  I think next time I will make this I will leave out the lime.  I did use cilantro.  But I also used cilantro and roasted onion olive oil along with a splash of pineapple balsamic vinegar that I had on hand.  Overall, good dish.

Wow, this was awesome.  I added some cumin to the rub because I love it, and substituted red pepper flakes for cayenne because I didn't have any.  It was just spicy enough, my kids devoured it, as did my husband.  This is definately a keeper!

Really good! I decreased the lime to about 1/2 cup and used about 3 tbs. olive oil. I used the same amount of spices as suggested ( I omitted the cayenne - too spicy for my kids). I roasted the chicken at 450 because it was raining - but will definitely make again on the grill.

I was really surprised at how good this was - I was expecting a fishy taste, but it was not.  I HIGHLY recommend using albacore tuna rather than the regular mushy tuna.  Much better taste and texture.  The capers are fabulous!  If you don't have them on hand, wait to make the recipe when you do.  I sprinkled fresh grated parmesan on top for a perfect finish.  Also, you can make this just from what you keep in your pantry.  I made a special category called "Pantry" for recipes like these for when I'm low on fresh groceries.

It tasted flavorful and great! I marinated it overnight, which seemed only to increase its good flavor. It was a little spicy, so watch out those weak of the tongue!

Pretty tasty chicken. I always hate reviews that are like "I didn't follow the recipe at all," but this is one of those. Although, I do think that the basic recipe would turn out pretty much the same. (1) I used artificial lime juice (too much to squeeze otherwise; should have gotten the good stuff, though, this cheap stuff smells like furniture polish a bit); (2) used boneless breasts; (3) didn't see that I was supposed to rub, then marinate (mixed the spiced right into the marinade to begin with - oops); (4)  cooked in saute pan with the marinade (don't worry I brought it to a boil).

I wanted to use it to shred onto salads and nachos and it was perfect for that. For shredding, I don't like the hard outer shell chicken gets on the grill. But after I shredded it, I put it on a baking sheet of chips, and sprinked with cheese -- put on the grill to melt, then sprinked with pickled jalepenos and fresh cilantro. This was REALLY tasty. 

If you want a nice lime chicken, this is a good recipe.

Very good.  Next time I will increase the cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon.  I omitted the cilantro (can't stand the taste).

I LOVED this recipe. I forgot to save it in my recipe box and it took me forever to find it again. Definitely a keeper!

My mother and step-father were coming to dinner the other night, and I chose this dish to prepare for them.  My step-father is the pickiest eater I have ever met, and ususally doesn't eat much when he comes for dinner at our house.  I used chicken tenders instead of a whole chicken, and after marinating, tossed the chicken and marinade into the same pan, brought it up to a boil, and then let it simmer together until the chicken was done.  I tasted a piece of chicken before serving, and found the lime flavor to be quite intense.  I thought that my step-father would leave hungry yet again.  To my surprise, he gobbled up half of the chicken himself, saying that he wouldn't have known there was lime in it at all if I hadn't told him!?!  It was a very good dish, and I will make it again for sure, and soon!

THis was excellent. I used boneless breasts and red pepper roasted olive oil in place of regular. Served it with the sweets and beets on this site. YUM
