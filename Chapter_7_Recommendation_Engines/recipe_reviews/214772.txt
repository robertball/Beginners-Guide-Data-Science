Perfect! Exactly what we were hoping for. Thanks :)
Update: 10-25-10 Can't believe no one else has reviewed these! Made these again today using ground chicken in place of the ground pork. I even used less meat than called for (about 3 pounds total) by mistake without changing the dry or liquid measurements and they still came out fantastic. They're a wonderful comfort food and great alternative to the usual beef meatball. Serve w/mashed potatos and green beans - yum. Try these!

For those who change the recipe to ground beef, you are NOT making polish meatballs. Pork and veal are the staples in polish dishes.

My sympathy for your loss. And my great respect for your Grandfather's enjoyment of cooking. Thank you for sharing his recipe. To the review finding this recipe lacking in spices and in need of an extra kick, I suggest trying it with Alfredo sauce. It could be served over pasta, or with potato wedges. The greatest recipes are those that stand alone, or can be easily adapted.

Very good.  Very similar to a friends polish meatball recipe.

We didn't have everything for the recipe, so we modified it, but it turned out great.  We used all hamburger meat. Milk and butter to take place of mushroom soup. Used a bunch of matza bread in place of saltiness and bread crumbs. Will make again!

Made this for pasts & meatballs and it was flavorful but it didn't go over well with the family.

This was good. I think it needed something else, some other spice perhaps. I thought the soup would make a light gravy but nothing.  I served it with buttered noodles and cooked carrots. I'll try again but will make some kind of sauce to go with it.
