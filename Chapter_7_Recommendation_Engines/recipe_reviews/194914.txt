I've been smothering cabbage and kale with bacon and onion for years so was so glad to see that it's a favorite with others.  It's great to keep in the fridge so whenever I want a "snack" to tide me over, I warm up a bowl of this in the micro.  More recipies like this please!

OK, so I had never made collard greens or even ate them much...I always heard they were hard to get right.  Well, this recipe with the cabbage and the bacon is so easy and simply and oh sooooo sinful!!!!  I added red pepper flake to mine as it was frying but that's all I changed since I like things a little spicy.  I will be making this recipe again and again and again....thanks so much for the awesome recipe.  LOOOOVE IT!!!!

Took a bit longer for my greens to tenderize, but it didn't matter..the end result was absolutely awesome.  I've been looking for this recipe for a while; my grandmother made greens just like this!!!!

A-MA-ZING!  Sooo easy and nutritious = high in Vit C and A.  My neighbor is an ole' southern boy and he raves about smothered cabbage.  It's the only thing he can make.  He's in the produce industry and gives all us transplant northerners seriously fresh cabbage. Now I know what to do with it.  Thank You!

So good! I omitted the bacon as I'm vegetarian and it was still banging. I have no idea what greens seasoning is, I just added some crushed red pepper. Delicious!  I finished with a splash of apple cider vinegar.

Was skeptical at first, but I trusted the reviews and went for it. This was a great dish. I actually had greens in my garden that I was able to use-I ended up using about 15 leaves of collards and less than a pound of bacon. Will add this too my favorites!

I couldn't follow the recipe because I didn't know what "greens seasonings" is. I would have loved to have tried it though.

Very tasty! Bacon...how can you go wrong with bacon. I used the Instant Pot on sauté , then on low to be more efficient. Used Old Bay Seasoning instead of the "Greens Seasoning" (didn't have that). Left the sugar out this time, may try it next time. The bacon cooked nicely but never became crispy as recipe stated. A big hit!

Absolutely delicious and great for when you want to make some collard greens but don't have hours to spend, or if you just forgot to start them in the morning! We will be using this recipe over and over again!

This is an easy recipe to try.  I found it to be ok. I pretty much followed the recipe except for the amounts of greens and cabbage I just used what I had of each.  I think next time I will leave out the cabbbage I like both fried cabbage and  fried collards just not together.

Made with higher collards to cabbage ratio than recipe, I didn't have any greens seasoning, so I used a favorite steak seasoning I had.
Turned out delicious. will probably be a regular recipe in our house.

Love how much flavor these had! I didn’t have the wheat germ so I used some crushed crackers instead. The key is to only use half of the milk and add more if you really need it. Very tasty!!

I added some pumpkin oil when frying up the bacon and onion (used red onion).  I used kale instead of collard greens, as that is what I had on hand.    For the greens seasoning I used ample amounts of sumac seasoning, which really pops the flavor.  Served this with a marinated pork tenderloin and red potatoes.  Turned out awesome!

Really delicious! Next time I will drain off most of the bacon fat prior to adding the greens. Way too greasy for us. Otherwise great!

I loved this.  i've been looking for a way to cook collards that wasn't as bitter.  The sweetness of the cabbage balances it perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made changes because I used what I had on hand. I used frozen kale.  I dont eat bacon so I used seasonings instead like worchestire sauce and smoked paprika to season along with salt and pepper. I will make this again.

This was so delicious, made with all my favorites: greens, cabbage and onions and bacon! I used cabbage onions and greens from our farmers market. For the greens seasoning i used fresh basil and rosemary from my garden and a little crushed red pepper. I added a little chicken broth  to simmer at the end. Great recipe!
