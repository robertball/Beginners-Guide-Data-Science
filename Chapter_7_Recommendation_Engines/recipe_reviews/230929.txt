I used this recipe as a starting point, and we loved the results!  I used about 3/4 pound of whole wheat pasta which worked well.  I had leftover cooked asparagus that I chopped into 1 inch pieces and used instead of peas.  And instead of 2 cups of cream, I added 1 tbsp of flour to the mix before adding the liquid, then used about 1/3 cup of half and half  and 1 2/3 cup of chicken broth. I'm sure it wasn't as rich as the original recipe, but the taste was great.  And I did garnish with parsley and lemon juice.  Great way to use leftover Easter ham!

The whole family really enjoyed this (because I left out the parsley for my son.) The smoked cheddar gives good depth to the flavor that regular cheddar would not have. To reduce the amount of fat, replace 1 cup of cream with 1 cup of home-made stock and 4 tsp of flour. This produces a nice creamy finish on the pasta without the heaviness. I also had honey- baked ham too. Wow!

I thought this was a good base recipe. I cooked the peas with the pasta then added both to the sauce mixture. Used Parmesan cheese and half and half and still got a nice, creamy consistent sauce.

This was loved by everyone in my house.  Made it exactly like recipe says except the grocery was out of cream.  I had one cup cream in the frig and I used one cup of Half-N-Half also in frig.  Turned out great and my kids are asking when am I going to make it again.  Pasta I used was Gluten Free and you could not tell.  My husband is GF person.  Thanks for sharing this one and we will have again soon!

We enjoyed this recipe for dinner.  I halved the recipe and it was plenty for two of us for dinner as well as some leftover.  I think perhaps there is a little too much pasta for the amount of sauce.  I did forget the lemon juice accidentally.  I will make this again.  Thanks!

Modified with capers for mushrooms and parmesan/romano cheeses, light cream diluted with milk, frozen peas steamed in the bag.  No chili flakes or lemon juice.  Loved it.

This was delicious and quick! I didn't add the ham or peas (didn't have any in the fridge at the time) but made it with spinach instead and sharp cheddar cheese. I think it was even better! Really creamy and if you're a spinach lover, it's perfect.

This is another winning recipe that I have found on AllRecipes.com. The only part that I changed was the cheddar cheese. I couldn't fine the smoked cheddar so I used regular sharp cheddar and it came out very good. I'll look harder for the smoked cheddar the next time I plan on making this. I'd like to know if it improves an already great recipe.

This recipe was wonderful. Omitted chili flakes and used regular shredded cheddar. Couldn't stop eating this.

We thought this was just okay. The smoky cheddar just wasn't our thing, I guess. The recipe itself was very simple to make and used ingredients I already had, so that was a plus.

I used fresh grated white cheddar cheese but that was the only ingredient that I changed.  It was very good but quite time consuming.  Hubby wants me to put crunched up Frito's on top next time.  I put it all together in the large pot for mixing but then I placed it in a casserole dish, put extra cheese and the parsley on top and baked it for twenty minutes at 350 degrees.  It made a nice presentation for the table.  I served it with fresh crusty bread and a green salad with homemade lemon dressing.
