Delicious!   
I was a bit worried, since I had to make some changes (I was out of brown sugar, so added a higher quantity of white sugar; used a can of diced tomatoes with chilies I had on hand, and canned mushrooms) But it smelled wonderful while cooking, which quickly allayed my fears.
As for the finished product--- wonderful; my boyfriend and I both loved it.
Definately keeping this onhand for a quick and easy dinner solution.

PS-- wanted to add, West Indian has nothing to do with India-- it has to do with the West Indies.  There seemed to be some confusion.

I don't know what's Indian about this dish. There are no Indian spices used and it rather tastes like Chinese sweet and sour chicken with some green peppers.. That's all. I am a pperson who seldom seldom says bad about any food,,, but about this one, I should say that it was very bad.. (And I'm confident that I cooked ok according to the original recipe.) Also, due to Berbeque sauce, soy sauce and brown sugar,,, the dish cones up very black.. Dark black, and it's not the color that appeals to the appetite.  I will never make it again.

I liked this recipe a lot.  It could benefit form some more spices in my opinion.  I added corriander to it and thickened the sauce a bit with some flour before I added the pulled chicken meat.  It was raved about at my table.

To the reviewer who is geographically challenged...the reason it does not resemble an Indian dish is because it is called "West Indian Chicken".  That means the Caribbean.

Dish was alright - not a big hit with me, though the bf liked it.  I did cut down on the bbq sauce a bit though.  After reading some of the reviews I'd just like to add that West Indian refers to the West Indies aka the Caribbean.  NOT India.  And yes, West Indian food is a nice mixture of Indian, African, Chinese, Persian, Spanish, French and English cuisine. :)

I was looking for a recipe with a unique flavor and I loved this one. I used 2 cans of flavored diced tomatoes instead of fresh. I also doubled the other ingredients to make this more of a stew. I started to pull the chicken from the bone, got bored, and decided to leave the legs, thighs, and wings on the bone. Made the recipe easier and still tasted great.

I live in the west indies and although this was good I didn't find anything special about this until I added pineapple and seasoning pepper sauce. Will added more tomatoes next time.

I made this with chicken thighs (removed the skin, then followed the recipe). Initially this was really dry, so I ended up adding more of the BBQ sauce ingredients. The only other real change I made was to add some garlic powder. I served it over rice, and it was ok - I think it might be better in a hoagie (like a pulled pork sandwich, but with pulled chicken). Thanks!

This is a very nice recipe. I added onions, red pepper and extra mushrooms to the receipe. It smelled great while it was cooking and my husband and friend gave it high praise.

This was really yummy. I used cubed chicken breast and put the final product on top of my pizza. I would say not really West Indian, more like Western Chinese.
Really great anyhow!

There is nothing remotely West Indian about this dish apart from the brown sugar

This was pretty good. I subbed zucchini for the bell pepper, added garlic and onion, and served it over brown rice. Next time I would cut the vinegar in half.

This recipe was amazing! I added some onion and garlic to give it a little extra flavor. I served it over brown rice. My boyfriend loved it, too! Next time, I will add some crushed red pepper to give some kick, because I love spicy food. I have no complaints about the way this recipe is written, though. Very good!!!!

I omitted the vegetables and used chicken legs instead of a whole chicken. It was really good, but if you don't like a sweet sauce forget this one. I will make this again without the vegetables.
