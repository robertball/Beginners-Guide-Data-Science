My husband doesn't like hazelnut spread. So I used the Hershey's chocolate spread instead. I was so shocked at how easy this recipe was. As I was letting it cool down, I had to step away for a minute. When I returned to the kitchen to take a picture of it, I found my husband devouring it. He couldn't stop raving about. We even tried some pieces with whipped cream. I'll definitely be making this more often.
