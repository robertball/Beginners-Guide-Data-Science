The Russian dressing adds an interesting twist and a nice change to bbq pulled beef. I pulled off chunks of the brisket and shredded it in my KA stand mixer to make quick work of it. Served as sliders on lightly toasted rolls.

Used onion powder and garlic powder instead of the salts and left out the russian dressing. I found the rub made the meat delicious and well seasoned, then used my favorite bbq sauce with half cup of the pot juices. The beef would be delicious without any bbq sauce! Yummmn

Interesting flavor but I recommend reducing all the salts by 1/2.  Made as directed this is way too salty.  Otherwise it's pretty good.

Just read this recipe and then at sodium content and am wondering in this day and age with people eating more healthy why oh why would this recipe call for celery salt, garlic salt, onion salt, regular salt and worcheshire sauce? Most of these seasoning are sold in powder form rather than as a salt. The Russian dressing is another added salt bomb.
I make a delicious brisket in the oven using about 3 handfuls of onions, 1/2 under brisket and 1/2 on top. A couple of sprinkles of Lawrey's, 1 c. water and aluminum foil to seal and bake for about 3-3 1/2 hrs. Testing with a fork until soft "like butter". .Simple and easy. The you can make sandwiches with any kind of sauce and go withs.

I followed the recipe using the celery salt and salt , but substituted garlic and onion powder  for the garlic salt and onion salt.  My family found it delicious and will definitely make again.

Amazing. I’m not usually a fan of pulled-“meat” sandwhiches. But the family was asking for it. Completely worth the 9 hour cooking. Had it in the crockpot by 8am and was ready a little after 5pm. Made it exactly how it’s written, didn’t change a thing and everyone was pleased. I’ve read a lot of reviews saying it was salty. It isn’t. Great flavour, very juicy. I will be making this again 100%.

This recipe turned out great! I used tri tip instead of beef brisket and used the sauce on the side just in case some of my family would want to save on calories (no one did). I would make this again!

Delicious!! Husband loved it! I do recommend cutting back on the salt especially if your not a salt lover. I made broccoli slaw with roasted almonds in it to go with it and the pairing of the flavors was on point!

I pretty much followed the recipe as is, but I got a larger amount of Brisket (about 7 lbs.) from Costco. Then I cut off all the fat, which was probably 1-1/2 lbs worth. For other ingredients, I used 1.5 times the amounts given, although I may have not done that with all the salts. We served it on Brioche buns to 8 people with coleslaw and potato salad. We have enough leftover for another meal with 4 People. Really Tasty!!! I also liked that everything could be done ahead of time do l could spend time with my guests.

This recipe was delicious and after reading the reviews about it being too salty,  did substitute onion powder  for the onion salt.  Also drained the fat from the cooking broth and cut the fat from the brisket before shredding. It was enjoyed by everyone at a family gathering!

followed recipe to a t. After removing from slow cooker I scraped the excess at off meat.  Also drained fat  from the 1?2 cup liquid that was added to sauce pane.  Taste was just right and saude was not too runny.  Will make again.

My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe.
The only thing I did different was I used Hymilain pink salt instead of table salt.
We will definitely make this again. My wife prefers this over pulled pork now!

Awesome flavor!  Whole family loved it and raved about it.  They went back for thirds.  Might have to buy a bigger brisket next time.  Super easy and can make during the week.  Will be in my rotation during the school year.

As others have mentioned, the salt content was so high it made the brisket inedible.  But im at least giving it a proper rating, unlike those who still gave it 4 or 5 stars despite mentioning the salt issue.

Brisket was a bit pricey at the store (as much as a nice steak), so I bought a chuck roast instead.  It pulled apart and was just like any brisket I've had at restaurants. I would definitely cut back on the salt next time, and I love salt! Overall, this was really good!

Made this for sunday football and it turned out amazing. I went a bit easy on the salt. I cooked the brisket in the oven. Made the sauce with the drippings, BBQ sauce and russian dressing in a sauce pan and allowed to reduce a bit.  Shredded the beef and combined in the slow cooker on warm for about a hour. Blew my socks off delicious. This recipe is a keeper.

I also thought it would've been too salty, but was tipped off by the long lists of salts before starting. I only used the amount of regular salt and seasoned with ground cumin and coriander, piment d'Espelette, and red onion. For those who don't know what Russian dressing is, it's just ketchup and mayonnaise half and half. I added these to hoagie rolls with coleslaw and sliced yellow onions.

Based on other reviewers' recommendations, I used garlic and onion powders instead of the salts. We LOVED the seasoning on the beef. Because of the way my day went, I ended up not making the sauce as written and just served the beef with a bottle of BBQ sauce. While putting away the leftovers, I was glad I did it that way (with the sauce separate) because the meat is so flavorful and the leftovers could be used in a variety of dishes.  I cannot comment on the BBQ Sauce/Russian Dressing blend since I didn't end up making it (though I had every intention.)  I made Susan's Vinaigrette Coleslaw (also on this site) to serve with it.

Awesome recipe.  Followed others’ advice on cutting the salt by half and used onion and garlic powders instead of the salts.  I didn’t have celery salt, so I used celery seed and it still came out great.  My husband absolutely loved it.

This was well received at the dinner table! The dressing added a nice taste note that is absent in most BBQ beef recipes. Also liked that it did not have a vinegar taste.  Used two pounds of stew meat since brisket wasn't at the store that day and neither was Russian dressing so I went with Catalina instead and Famous Dave's BBQ sauce. Cooked in the oven at 275 about four hours.  Hubs ate every bit and really enjoyed  it.  Easy and tasty, can't beat that! Thanks for posting!

I've made this a few times now and I'm surprised at how tender the brisket turns out. My family loved it  so much, I had to make it two weekends in a row. This recipe also works well with pork roast but I used more of a sweet rub on the pork.

I made this for a Labor Day get together. Everyone liked it but it was waaaay  too salty. If I make it again I would leave out the 1-1/2 teaspoons of salt. With all the other salts it does not need any additional salt!

I made this to test out the flavor and texture for a party I am having. Got to say, excellent. I made this with a chuck roast and it was excellent. Definitely will keep this recipe for future get togethers.

Same as other reviews.... too much salt.  Substitute for Celery seed, onion powder, etc.  Otherwise, AWESOME!

One of my family’s favorite recipes. Use garlic and onion powder instead of salt, but that’s the only thing I change.

This was so easy to make and absolutely delicious.  Had it for Mother’s Day dinner, making it for a party of 40.  Easy to make!!! Love the slaw on it, too.

I followed other reviewers suggestions and used garlic powder and onion powder in place of the salts. I did however add the regular salt but I will leave it out next time as it was still a little salty for us. Other than that, it was delicious and I will definitely make it again!  We served it on soft potato buns coleslaw on top. Perfect summer weekend meal!  Thank you, Gary!

I made it as directed.  Loved the flavor of the meat, a great rub!  I will use it again.  The brisket did stall at 165 and finally completed after 8 hours.  Even with the wrap.  A little disappointed with the bark.  Not much to speak of.  Used a pellet grill.

Made it twice, first time with actual brisket, second time with a chuck roast which worked out just as well (when you're cooking something for 9 hours it's all going to end up about the same).  For changes, like most people my blood pressure went up just reading the recipe with all those salts, so we kept the salt, but substituted celery seed, onion powder and fresh minced garlic.  Second time, I also added dry mustard to the rub in a proportion roughly 2/3 of the amount of salt (I was using a larger piece of meat, so adjusted the rub to match).

Left out the Russian dressing both times, since neither of us is especially fond of the stuff (and we wouldn't use it for anything else).

A tip: When siphoning off the cooking liquid, use a bulb or syringe baster to get below the fat layer on top of the liquid. This will give you the juices you want without the grease you don't.

Haven't made this yet but plan to. That's the only reason I only gave it three stars. I will adjust after making it if needed.  What I wanted to say is why some (Portland OR) find it necessary to criticize a recipe? If it doesn't sound appealing to you don't make it....simple. probably would have substituted powder for salt as well but would have done so without criticism.

This is horrible and I omitted the onion salt and garlic salt and just added plain garlic powder and onion powder, this has way to much salt in it!!!! if you do still want to try this, my advise is just use the BBQ sauce, it would have turned out way better, I cannot stress how disgustingly salty this is. To each their own but I can't see anyone enjoying this using the recipe exactly as listed.

I made this for my family last weekend and it was amazing, the only thing I would say is that mines didn't turn out as tender as I would've liked it.. but there's no left overs, I will be making it again..
