I published this recipe - I prefer to use loaf pans, I have actually never done this in a bundt pan.  The cherry compote takes this already amazing pound cake over the top!  I store the compote separately and let it cool slightly before I serve.  Enjoy!

Yummy! Easy to make. I served with sweetened strawberries instead of making the compote. The cake is very dense, like a pound cake should be.

I was so looking forward to this cake. The picture looks so good,. I went out and bought all the ingredients for a double recipe. I don't know what I did wrong. The flavor is good, but the texture is not. It's like a biscuit! I'm sorry, but I'm not making this again.

I made this last night, adding a little extra lemon everything and a little less flour mixture with 4 tbsp of milk and 4 tsp of lemon pudding mix. THE BEST POUND CAKE I HAVE EVER EATEN. Springy and lemony with the perfect texture. I will definitely be making this again and again. I made mine it two loaf pans and it took A LOT longer to cook than the time on here but the recipe is delightful!

I love this cake.  I've made it several times and it has always turned out great - quite moist and dense.  I make mine like a sheet cake in a swiss roll tin because I don't have a bundt tin.  It's a relatively shallow dish so I keep a close eye on the cooking time because it's cooks more quickly.  Definitely a favourite in our house and I've been asked for the recipe by friends who've tasted it.  I've never made the compote so can't say what that's like but for a party I drizzled melted chocolate over the cake before I cut it up into squares.

This looks terrific.  Since it is a lemon cake, I think it would be great with blueberry sauce.  For pishposh12, this is a pound cake so the consistency will be denser than a quick bread.

I made it but not sure what went wrong. I didn't have loaf pan large enough so I used a bundt pan. The dough rose really high above the pan, but once I took it out it kind of collapsed into itself. I baked it for a little over an hour. The cake is good but it is more the consistency of a very, very dense mouse, not cake like.So I am going to try again and increase the flour by about 1/4 cup and reduce the sour cream by 1/2 cup. The batter tasted delicious though. Oh if anyone has any suggestions please let me know. Thanks!!!

Made this and was so looking forward to it as I love lemon pound cake. It was dense and under cooked, even though I tested it with a toothpick for doneness.

Had to cook a little longer than 1 hour. I thought the cake was too dense, but the family liked it.

The cake looked great when it came out of the oven, but by the time it cooled it was half the size. When I cut into it, I could tell it was more dense than a pound cake should be. And it didn't have a lot of flavor.

I followed the recipe and was looking forward to this,  maybe I should have used the loaf pans. I used a pound cake pan and it did not rise well, looked under cooked.

This recipe did not work for me. I followed the recipe exactly. I was looking for a cake to make a base for a trifle.  This is definitely not the one.

Disappointing. The pound cake was 1/2 the size I expected. The cherry compote was good. I might make the cherry compote again but with a proven pound cake recipe I usually use.  I would not make this recipe again.
