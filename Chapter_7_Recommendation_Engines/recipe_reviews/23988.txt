I made this for my picky parents and they really enjoyed it. I made a few alterations: I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and like some others suggested I used one 10 oz. package of spinach and one 10 oz. of broccoli. I also added a can of mushrooms and some shredded carrot and shredded zucchini. Instead of jarred sauce I made homemade with an easy recipe from this website called "Best Marina Sauce Yet." 
My only complaint is that one 8 oz package of lasagna noodles was not enough if you layer in fours as the recipe called for. I was two noodles short.

This recipe sounded really great, however after reading some of the other reviews I did make some changes...I read a couple reviews that said there was too much sauce, noodles were crispy, had to use a whole box of noodles...So I precooked the noodles (a whole box) and eliminated the water that the recipe called for. I just browned the onions and garlic then mixed in the spinach, spices and a 26 oz. bottle spaghetti sauce. I had a second bottle of sauce on hand. I also added a second egg to the recipe and changed the cottage cheese to ricotta cheese. I put some sauce straight from the bottle in the bottom of the pan then layered noodles, spinach mix, noodles, egg mix, noodles, bottled sauce and added chopped frozen broccoli to this layer. A full box noodles will be enough for a 9"x13" pan with two layers of each filling. Top with more sauce and cheese. Bake 30-45 minutes or until hot in center.

This is the best Lasagna ever!!!!!!!! My husband and I are vegitarians and we love it. We make it about once a week. I use Ricotta cheese and tofu instead of cottage cheese. The tofu has the same texture as the ricotta without the fat. I do about 1 cup each (ricotta and tofu). Just Ricotta also taste great. Also sometimes we add mushrooms to the sauce and it gives some meatiness to the meal. Also sometimes I use fresh spinach and it taste great.

This was a hit with my husband AND three-year-old daughter.  The only suggestion I would make is to set aside a little bit of plain red sauce (without spinach, et al) for the final layer.  The spinach darkens during baking, and I think this non-spinach sauce would make the dish more appealing to the eye.  Also, I sprinkled the top with some mozzarella cheese after I removed the foil for the final minutes of baking.  Yummy!

This was delicious!  The only thing I changed was substituting ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese like others suggested.  Make sure to reserve enough sauce for the very top so that the noodles are covered well, otherwise they might not be as soft.

A really nice change for a tasty lasagna - might use only one pkg of spinach next time and substitute other vegetables instead - it had a fairly strong spinach taste.

Awesome!  I have been looking for a spinach lasagna recipe and I have certainly found it.  I shredded carrot into the cheese mixture, used oven ready lasagna, skipped the water in the sauce and spinach mixture, and coated the bottom of the lasagna pan with an 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  This will be a great recipe to share with company.

This is a fabulous lasagna.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was just perfect.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to but I squeezed the liquid out of the spinach before sauteeing.  I plan to make this recipe quite often!

Excellent.  My daughter (16) loved this!  Used my own sauce instead of jarred....very good.**update...I just made this the other night and used a 12 oz bag of fresh spinach in which I chopped but did NOT cook but did add to the cheese mixture.  It was amazing this way!  Thanks for the recipe Laura.

The best lasagna I've ever made. I love that you don't have to cook the noodles separately! I only used one package of spinach, and I used Bertolli's "Marinara with Burgundy" sauce (which is only 26 oz, but I made up the difference by adding some tomato paste & water). We didn't miss having meat in this. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious! Instead of a jar of spaghetti, I made "Best Marinara Sauce Yet", from this website. I had 3 cups of marinara sauce which ened up being the perfect amount for this recipe.  I used low-fat ricotta cheese in place of cottage cheese. To the cheese I mixed the mozzarella and parmesan cheese with 1 egg, fresh parsley with salt and black pepper. I placed a small amount of sauce on the bottom of the pan, layered the noodles, then the riccota cheese. On top of the ricotta cheese I placed layers of fresh organic spinach and thinly sliced mushrooms. I repeated the layers until I ended up with sauce which I topped with mozzarella cheese and a sprinkle of freshly grated parmesan reggianno cheese. I added a 1/4 cup of chicken broth to the bottom of the pan along with the sauce.  I baked it according to the directions. The lasagna was done within 55 minutes, but I took off the foil to bake another 5 minutes. The sauce was bubbling on the bottom of the pan. My house smelled like an italian restaurant! I had a wonderfully fresh tasting savory lasagna. There were tons of cheese oozing in between layers of noodles. When I picked up a piece of lasagna with my fork cheese clung to the fork and the noodles. The homemade sauce was so fresh with bits of crushed roma tomatoes. I loved all the fresh green spinach and mushrooms which added to the texture of the lasagna. I also ate this with a nice warm crusty "French Bread", also from this website. A hearty and satisfying meal!

This was a great recipe, though I made a few modifications to make it just right. I bought the "no boil" lasagna noodles, which allowed me to eliminate the water. I also just used 26oz of spaghetti sauce, since that's the size the jar comes in. I added mushrooms, as well, for flavor and texture. I subbed ricotta for the cottage cheese and "finished" with mozzarella on top of the sauce because, really, who can deny their love for the slightly browned cheese on top? Because I used "no boil" noodles, I reduced the baking time to about 40mn, removing the foil after the first 30. Very tasty!

Too much Spinach and not enough cheese.  And it made way too much sauce.  It did have decent flavor but a bit too heavy on the spinach.  Lots left over and it didn't get reheated which tells me my family didn't care for it very much.  Maybe with half the amount of spinach and more cheese it would be better.

I've made this a couple of times, and while we liked it both times, I made some adjustments because I did think it came out a bit watery the first time. I used 16 oz of frozen spinach, 1 onion, 2 handfuls of baby carrots chopped, and 2 handfuls of frozen broccoli chopped. I let the spinach and broccoli saute by themselves until they were well thawed and the extra water was gone. I didn't toss the carrots into the sauce mixture until later in the simmer, so they retained quite a bit of crunch, which was a nice contrast in texture to the rest of the lasagna. I used 24 oz of fat-free cottage cheese, and instead of 8oz of mozzarella I used an 8 oz block of Tomato & Basil feta cheese. I left out the parsley, salt & pepper because I was getting so many spices from the spaghetti sauce and feta cheese already. I used a box of No Boil lasagna noodles, and squeezed in an extra this time, to help soak up the extra water. I topped it with some reserved spaghetti sauce, and sprinkled the top with some mozzarella. It got rave reviews around the table, and it came out with an excellent texture, not soupy this time. My husband declared it the best lasagna he'd ever had, so I had to make sure I wrote down the changes I'd made this time!

This is so, so good.  One of those dishes where the leftovers just keep getting better!
My only changes were to cook the noodles (whole wheat) and omit the water from the recipe and then I also used 1 cup of fat free ricotta with 1 cup of the cottage cheese.  
I think that, next time, I will use bagged spinach.  If do use the frozen again, I will drain it!!  I will also use MORE GARLIC :)
This is just a great vegetarian recipe.  It makes a ton so next time I will probably split it into 2 pans and freeze one!

This tasted good and was easy to put together.  Not so pleasing to the eye, though - the spinach makes the sauce look brown and kinda nasty.  I used a 45 oz. jar of sauce, which worked out really well.  I think that I will save some of the plain jar sauce for the very top layer next time, just so the appearance is better.  I used part-skim ricotta instead of cottage cheese because it was cheaper, and I used an additional 4 oz. mozzarella and 2 oz. parmesan sprinkled over the very top.  Lasagna is very filling and this made a lot so, as an added bonus, I have several individual servings in my freezer for future lunches.

I used a 16 ounce bag of frozen spinach, doubled the spices (but made it with 1/2 of the salt) used a 28 ounce jar of sauce and a 14 ounce jar of diced tomatoes with spices, used fat free ricotta instead of cottage cheese and used a about 10 or 11 ounces of noodles. Made it the night before and stuck it in the fridge. I cooked it for 45 mins at 350 and then 15 mins without the foil. Would recommend cooking it without the foil for longer if you like the burnt stuff on top like my husband does. I used all organic products and whole wheat lasagna noodles for a total of 375 calories and 11 grams of fat per 1/8 of a pan. Awesome! Fresh parsley is a MUST!

Perfect for a Friday in Lent ;) it doesn't taste overly spinachy and you don't even miss the meat. My husband in particular likes this and he's not very vegetarian!

Loved this recipe! my only changes were to use fresh spinach, sauted with garlic, sliced crimini mushrooms and onions. I also used low-fat ricotta, lots of Parmesan and low-fat mozzarella, along with no-boil noodles. Came out delicious! My meat-loving hubby and son ask for it all the time - say they like it better than regular with meat! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

I'm so glad I found this recipe. I've made it twice now and tweeked it to what my friends think is perfection. Do NOT boil the noodles first, it isn't necessary. Saute onion, spinach, and 1 jar of artichokes, 1 jar of roasted red peppers in a sauce pan. Add spaghetti sauce and (here's the key) 1 lb veggie crumbles. It is amazing. I also layered some fresh spinach leaves between the meat and cheese layers. I finished with a layer of mozzarella for a browned cheesy top. Great recipe. It gave me a good base to experiment!

This recipe is great! I only like vegetable lasagna so whenever I make it, I use this recipe as a base. I usually add mushrooms and use ricotta instead of cottage cheese. First time I made it, I followed the recipe, except for adding mushrooms, and found the spinach to be way too soft/soggy. So, I saute garlic, onion, mushrooms, spinach, flavor it with salt, pepper, and basil. Set this aside. Make the cheese mix.   I put good amount of sauce on the baking dish and pour some water in it and mix it around. Then I layer my noodle, cheese mix, spinach mix. Pour sauce and then pour some water on top. Then I do noodle, cheese mix, spinach, sauce & water... finish with noodle and sauce & water. Making sure all the corners of the noodle is covered well.   I use about 27oz Marinara sauce and a cup of water. The noodles are cooked well every time and the spinach is not too soft. And you don't have to cook the sauce in the pot, so it's time saving.

Flexible recipe - perfect for using up CSA vegetables as it is easy to swap out spinach for other veggies on hand. Have made it with spinach as listed, as well as, sauteed carrots and kale, mushrooms... The spices worked well. Previously, I always made lasagna with ricotta, but thought the cottage cheese came out equally well - didn't change the overall flavor - came out great!

I was asked to make a spinich lasagna for an event and tried this one. I substitue 1lb of ground beef for one on the packages of spinich though. My hubby said he prefers regular lasagna over spinich but enjoyed this particular recipe and mysteriously the leftovers are all gone, hmmmm!

I followed it exactly and the noodles did not cook and there was not enough tomato sauce in it.

Five stars with my revisions.... I always make make a DOUBLE recipe of this (it is better, as usual with lasagna, a day or more later after baking..and it freezes beautifully) and using no-boil noodles here--forget the cups of water, not necessary (we want concentrated flavors, not watered down)... ricotta instead of the cottage cheese.... a 25 ounce jar of a tomato-heavy slightly-pinkish tone "3-cheese pasta sauce", then another bigger jar of bright red tomato pasta sauce.  Mix the red (pinkish one) cheesy sauce in with the spinach mix per the directions... so make three layers between the pasta layers (instead of just two); spinach mixture, cheese mixture, and bright red pasta sauce mixture.  The final layer of pasta gets topped with just the red sauce.  Cook for the 55 minutes, *then* top with more cheese (both mozzarella and parmesan, so you will need more than the recipe calls for in my version) and bake til the cheese browns til it looks like a magazine cover (and congrat yourself).  Also, don't layer things too evenly, lumpy is good! (which is nice as laying out the cheese mixture evenly is close to impossible and not desirable to me anyway--put the red sauce in the spaces between)  It then bakes down into luscious curvy layers of pasta, a bang of cheesy goodness here, another of spinach divinity there, all with the bright red cheerfulness of concentrated tomato sunshine of summer for your eyes and mouth.  Thank you LSPACE for the launching pad of my own version.

Best lasagna I've ever had! I used 10 oz of fresh spinach and 10 of frozen broccoli that I cooked with the onion, garlic, and herbs. I also used 2- 26 oz jars of sauce and ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. My husband also agreed that it was the best lasagna he's ever had. We will be making this one again soon!

This was a good recipe. I give it 4 stars because how can it be 5 stars if you have to make changes?  Anytime, you make changes it is no longer a 5 star recipe.  So the changes I made. I added 1 cup of mushrooms chopped, a whole onion chopped, and a 1/4 cup of red bell peppers chopped to the saute. I only used 1 1/2 packages of frozen spinach. 1 seemed like too little. 2 would have been too much. I added some italian seasoning, papkrika, and used garlic salt instead of garlic cloves. In the sauce I added 1.5 bottles of sphaghetti sauce. I used a whole mushroom flavored bottle (26 oz) and 1/2 of a cheese blend bottle. (26 oz used 13) I didn't add any water to the sauce at all. For the cheese mixture, I followed the recipe exactly. I didn't boil my noodles as instructed and baked as instructed covered for 50 mins. Then I removed the cover and sprinkled with cheddar/sharp cheese. Oh and I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. I have used cottage in the past and didn't like it.   The key to the noodles is to make sure every inch of the noodles has sauce on them. This way they will be soft when you finish cooking.   It was really great. I coupled it with a salad and some garlic bread and it was a great dinner.

Excellent!  Halved the recipe but kept all of the spices and herbs the same, added a small green pepper and used red wine in place of the water.  Also threw in a healthy amount of red pepper flakes and topped the lasagna with the remainder of the mozzarella cheese.  I'll most definitely make this one again.  Thanks!

This is fantastic!  I can't believe how healthy this is given how delicious it turns out:-).  Had friends over for dinner yesterday, they raved about it all night.  Our changes to the recipe:
*doubled the pepper, garlic, and parmesean
*used low-fat ricotta in place of cottage cheese
*thickly sliced two tomatoes and used it as the top layer.
I will definitely be making this again - thanks for the recipe!

Excellent low fat lasagna. I'd never used non-fat cottage cheese before but it works very well in this recipe. I did substitute Egg Beaters for the egg and added hot turkey sausage (removed from the casings and fried). I loved the fact that the frozen spinach didn't have to be thawed and drained. I just threw it in the pot and let it thaw and cook along with the onion. Oh, I also used the "no boil" lasagna noodles which I hadn't tried before and discovered my family all liked them better than regular lasagna noodles. This is definitely a "keeper" recipe... thanks so much Laura!

This is the Best lasagna i have ever had!!!  I made a few changes though. I added ground turkey, zuccini, shredded carrot, fresh spinach and dropped the 2 cups of water and parmesan cheese.  This is by far a keeper.

Great stuff! I prefer coarsely chopping a 20 oz bag of fresh spinach, makes the lasagne look better. Also chopped up a package of firm tofu and substituted it for half the cottage cheese.
Does take about an hour to make (a long time for ME!), but worth it! You're making it easy for us to do "meatless nights" at our house.
Thanks!

Simply heavenly. I make my own pasta sauce for it, using, in addition to the usual diced tomatoes, a small can of Walmart brand "diced tomatoes and jalopenas" for a nick spicy kick.

Following some other suggestions, I substituted skim ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and I used 1 package of spinach and about 12 ounces of frozen broccoli florets.  I think it would have been too "spinach-y" otherwise.  It turned out perfect!

I picked the first spinach lasagna with cottage cheese that I saw, and after making it and comparing it to others, I still think it's better than those.  Here's what I subbed or added:  plain tomato sauce for the spaghetti sauce; I used 1 pkg frozen spinach, about 4 cups of fresh spinach, about 6 oz. fresh sliced mushrooms, and 1 carrot.  We all loved this recipe along with the "quick cheesy bread" recipe on this site.

This lasagna was fantastic! I was really skeptical at first; I had never made lasagna, and I worried that my friends wouldn't like so much spinach, and I was also surprised that I wasn't supposed to cook the noodles. I need not have worried. This recipe was excellent, and the entire lasagna was devoured.

Fantastic! I used fresh spinach (just layered it) and added mushrooms. I also used 1 cup of part-skim ricotta and 1 cup tofu in place of cottage cheese as suggested by another reviewer. I changed nothing else. The recipe will still be 5 stars with cottage cheese, which I'll probably try next time...my family loved it!

I've gotten rave reviews everytime I make this recipe! The changes I make are as follows: I replace 1 of the spinach packages with mushrooms, use ricotta instead of cottage cheese and I always cover the top with mozzerella (i love cheese!) I've also prepared this the night before and bake at dinner time and it comes out great.

First I just have to say, I did add meat. My whole family loves meat, any type of meat! I knew my fiancee and our son would not like it as much without the meat so I added that. I also added the spinach and most the other ingredients to the cottage cheese mixture instead of the sauce mixture. I think it is better this way. Since I was already making baby food at the time too i added some pureed carrots to the sauce. I used everything in the recipe that was listed but added some green pepper and mushrooms to the spinach/cottage cheese mixture. I always use cottage cheese for lasagna and manicotti b/c for one it is less expensive, two it has way less fat and calories, and three we prefer it to ricotta. I tried using low fat ricotta and that was a complete waste of a meal and my time! This is a very good lasagna recipe, easy to follow, and no left overs, to my dissapointment.( I wanted it for lunch the next day) I highly suggest putting the ingredients all in the cottage cheese mixture though.

Well, 

I made this last night.  It was really good and my daughter (six years old) actually liked this.  I was a bit nervous with the spinach but she ate it and had seconds (yeah!).  I changed the recipe a bit by using one package of frozen spinach and substituting the rest with a medium eggplant that I diced up and sauteed with the spinach, garlic and onions.  I doctored the spaghetti sauce up too by adding some dashes of hot sauce and a whisper of salsa (mild) italian seasonings, some carrots sliced thinly so not to be picked up by my daughter ;) and a pinch of sugar to cut down on the acidity.  Instead of using the 32oz jar of sauce I used a jar and a half of 28oz sauces to make it a bit more saucey.  I served it with italian garlic bread and a salad.  I had it today for lunch and I can not wait to have some more for dinner tonight!  Ciou!

YUM! Overall, it's a great recipe! Everyone had 2 and 3 servings. Like most people, I tweaked it to my liking, but it is a wonderful base for a spinach lasagna. I did not add the water and I used wheat noodles, frozen spinach & fresh mushrooms sauteed w/ onions, 1 bottle vodka sauce and 1 bottle alfredo sauce. I used cottage cheese, mozzarella, fresh basil and parsley (I didn't have oregano on hand). It came out very creamy, cheesy, tasty and delicious. It was a winner at my house (2 adults / 3 teens). Thanks for sharing.

Very good and easy to throw together.  I used fresh spinach and sauteed it until wilted.  The only thing that could make this better would be a homemade pasta sauce.

There are a few things with this recipe that I thought needed changing, so I just couldn't see giving this 5 stars like so many others did. First, the recipe doesn't state to "squeeze dry" the spinach, which I did, but others might not know to do so. As I was making the sauce, it just seemed as if it needed more flavor, so I doubled the onion, spices and garlic, and it was better. I used the cottage cheese as stated, which I felt was fine. However, here's where I think the recipe could be improved:  Since it said to assemble this in a lasagna pan, I did just that, but then it takes much more than only 8 ounces of lasagna noodles!  I used up almost an entire 13 oz. box, making this probably drier than it should've been. Next time, I will definitely use a 9x13" pan and go with the 8 oz. of noodles. Also, since it states to finish the layering with the sauce being the last layer, that's what I did, but as it bakes, the spinach in the sauce takes on this gross grayish-black color, making it pretty unappealing. Maybe a top layer of parmesan cheese would help the appearance. Anyway, I had to make WAY too many changes to rate this 5 stars.

Excellent recipe!  I chose mozzarella cheese and omitted the cottage cheese. I also added 1lb. of chopped Portuguese chourico meat...(not Spanish chourizo)...Delicious!  Definitely a hit with family and friends.

Delicious!  Everyone loved it!  I was worried about there being too much water, but it was not the case.  I followed the recipe exactly, except added mushrooms and subbed ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese.  It was a big hit!  The prep work was very time consuming, but it was worth it!

Even hardcore carnivores may not notice that this is meatless.  Simple recipe, easy to prepare.  I made my own marinara sauce rather than buying a jar and it made it even tastier.  I usually make 2 batches at once and then freeze the extra one for later.

I was extremely pleased with this recipe and will definitely use it again.  I used two 24 oz. jars of sauce; I mixed one full jar with the spinach, 1/2 the second jar for the a sauce-only bottom and top layer, and put the remaining 1/2 jar in a gravy boat on the table for those who wanted more sauce.  I used fat-free mozzarella and cottage cheese, but also mixed in a full brick of (well-drained) tofu.  It was a big hit.

This recipe was really simple, I would recommend it to anyone making lasagna for the first time.  The next time I make it I will add more cheese to recipe and increase the amount of sauce between the layers.

This is an awesome basis for vegetarian lasagna.  I did make some changes as suggested by previous reviewers.  I exchanged one package of spinanch for some brocolli, zuchini and mushrooms. I precooked my noodles and left out the water (only because thats they way I make my regular lasanga). I probably used more mozzarella than was called for as we really like the cheesy taste. I used a smaller jar of spaghetti sauce but made up the difference with a 6oz jar of tomato paste and some tomato sauce.  Despite these changes I think this recipe is excellent as it stands & I will use it again & again with whatever variations strike me at the time.

Although I don't know I'd use the world simple, it was AWESOME. It's so hard to find dishes without meat that my husband wont try to add meat to, and he loved this! We ate leftovers for days, and I didn't change anything. Added a little onion and garlic, just because we love it, but it was great as is! I'll make again!

Husband complained about it now having meat but he did like it. I think that 10 oz of spinach would have been sufficient. Also, (not the recipe's fault) I used the USDA canned spaghetti sauce I had, but I think a more flavorful sauce would have been better.

Fast, easy and good. Actually much easier than I thought it would be.  I added the recipe to my handwritten cookbook I keep of our 'standard' recipes.  I did change it by using fresh spinach which I wilted first by steaming.  I also simply used one precut package for this because I picked it up on sale and what was left of a package of fresh baby spinach I needed to finish off.   The amount was perfect.  The taste was perfect also. I did toss in some Tomato Bruchetta spice mix I had. I used all FF products and the cottage cheese was fine curd.

•	I used whole wheat noodles, fresh steamed spinach and sautéed mushrooms. I mixed 1/2 c of fat free cottage cheese with a 1/2 c of part skim ricotta and 2 eggs and more spices. I am used to making lasagna with fresh mozzarella cheese and w/o cottage cheese. I could tell a difference but this was still very good and a bit healthier than my usual.

4 stars as written.  I agree that the recipe should advise to reserve some of the mozzarella to add to the top.  I also reduced spinach amount by 1/2 and added some red pepper flakes.  Definitely need more sauce, not the 1 1/2 cups of water.  This tastes MUCH better the next day!

Delicious! I've found that not cooking the noodles can backfire badly, so I cooked them while I was preparing the sauce. That cut baking time down to thirty minutes (uncovered). Just use 1/2 c. of water rather than 1 1/2 cups if you precook the noodles. I also recommend sprinkling some cheese over the last layer of sauce.

Wow, my very first time making lasagna and made 2 huge batches with this recipe. Took others advice and used cottage cheese and ricotta cheese. I also ran low on sauce but just tried to shake the bottle with some water and all turned out ok. I also let one cool down and then wrapped little portions in foil and put in freezer bags. Takes about 5-7 minutes in the microwave to heat up and makes a very simple dinner for us single folk!

I was on the lookout for a healthy-but-yummy lasagna recipe, and with a few modifications this is it. I layered it differently than the recipe suggested, and with four layers of noodles you need to use 2 cups of water (do drain the spinach). I doubled the oregano and basil for more flavor and used broth instead of water. Since the cheese is already salty, 1/2 tsp of salt is better, and that's coming from someone who likes salt. Great recipe!

I really liked this recipe.  I put cheese on top during the last 15 min in the oven.  Personally I liked the cottage cheese because I am not a fan of ricotta.  I may try thawing the spinach first.

This was delicious!!!  I only used one package  of spinach and added carrots, onions, mushrooms, zuchinni.  I didn't have any mozzarella so I used light cheddar cheese and parmesan and it turned out very good.  My husbands favorite meal is lasagna and he didn't even miss the meat.  He went back for seconds.  Definietly keeping this one.  Thanks Laura!!!

We liked this a lot!  The only changes I made were to saute 2 diced yellow squash with the onions and substitute 1 box chopped broccoli for one of the boxes of spinach.  I also used ricotta cheese for half of the cottage cheese to make it more authentic.  The pan was so full that it bubbled over the top and made a HUGE mess in the oven, but other than that, it was excellent!  It stayed in pretty squares when I served onto our plates instead of going flat in a slippery mess like some other lasagna recipes I have made.  Will make this one again!

My boyfriend and I loved this! I cooked my lasagna noodles to al dente prior to making the dish, and then left out the added water. I tried with broccoli as some of the reviews suggested, but next time will stick to just spinach. I used a larger bottle of spaghetti sauce and turned out with a perfect lasagna that wasn't runny at all!

We really liked this lasagne. Reading the other reviews helped. I used half spinach and half broccoli. I used an ariabatta sauce (spicy) and ricotta cheese. Also, I did cook the noodles and eliminated the water from the sauce. And I topped the casserole with grated parmesan. My own family recipe is a five star but takes half a day to make. This went together quickly and is a healthier and quicker version of lasagne that I will definitely make again.

I halved the recipe, omitted the oil, and added 2 extra noodles because it just didn't seem like enough. I really liked the taste of this spinach lasagna, but a major drawback is that it has no eye appeal. At the very end, I topped it with just a little mozzarella hoping to improve its visual presentation, but it didn't help much.

Substituted ricotta for cottage cheese and canned diced tomatoes for jarred spaghetti sauce, and it was still very tasty and my finicky teen liked it!  Used the no boil lasagna noodles.  Very easy recipe.  Just make sure you put enough sauce on top layer of noodles so they don't dry out during baking.

This was good, but it just seemed to need something more but it is what it says, a simple Spinach Lasagna.  I think the next time I will adjust this to be a simple Veggie Lasagne and add other vegetables.

This is very good. I made quite a few modifications to this recipe though- 2 pkgs. of frozen spinach is way too much. I used 1/2 a pkg of frozen spinach & 1/2 a pkg of frozen broccoli (I used the food processor for the broccoli) and this was plenty of veggies. I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. The first time I made it I omitted the water like some users suggested, but then I ran out of sauce. The second time I added the water back in, but then had too much sauce. I think 3/4 cup of water is probably about right. I used a 12 oz. pkg of mozarella cheese instead of an 8 oz. and then sprinkled the top with part of another pkg in the last 15 minutes of baking. I have also tried this with meat; I added 1/2 lb. ground beef and it's even better that way. Each time I make this  I have had extra noodles left over. I used a 9x13 pan.

I guess this is "simple" as far as lasagna goes, but I felt that it was a fairly complex recipe. Enough so that I would recommend doubling the recipe and making 2 while you are at it; might as well freeze one for later.

Very Tasty!! I did as the others did though and made some changes...I used the no boil noodles, which worked fine, but I should have had more than one box...I was only able to have a couple layers. I also added frozen chopped broccoli to the last layer. I used Ricotta cheese rather than cottage cheese. It came out great, the only problem was the store bought sauce I used was a little too sweet.  I did mine as follows: saute garlic, spinach, basil, oregano & onion in olive oil. Then add sauce and simmer..did my cheese mix as directions say except for ricotta instead of cottage and added 1 extra egg. Layered as directions say (with addition of brocolli in last layer). I did add extra Mozz. cheese at the end for the 15 min uncovered. It was good! My 10 yr old son who was disgusted at the thought of spinach lasagna was finished with his before my husband and I! He loved it!

The yummiest lasagna!!! I made a whole pan of this and enjoyed it over christmas break. For the spinach, I used spinach leaves that you see in those big bags and I chopped that up instead of using frozen chopped spinach. It just seemed fresher to me. I also used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.

This is a wonderful, healthy recipe.  Don't be scared to try the cottage cheese, it tastes great!  I sprinkled about a teaspoon of cinnamon into the cottage cheese mixture to give it a nice, autumn flavor.  Will be making many times over!

Delicious, though I thought two packages of spinach would be too much, so used one bunch of chopped up fresh spinach, and 3 grated carrots. Delicious! Oh, and I sprinkled cheese on top and set it to broil the last 5 minutes to get it nice and crispy.

This recipe is delicious! BUT, because I made a minor change, I cannot give it a 5 star rating. First of all, with 1 whole tsp of salt, it would be wayy too salty. I used a 1/2 tsp and it was still quite salty. Also, next time I may lesson the water a bit to 1 cup instead. After the lasagna was done baking I sprinkled some parmesan and cheese to melt on top so it would look nicer presentation wise. All in all, it was a delicious recipe and I would make again for sure. Thanks!

This lasagna was amazing. The spinach was tasty and the ricotta mix was nice and creamy. The only thing I changed was the water, I only added 1/2 a cup, I think anything more would have made it too watery. We loved it so much, I am making it again in another week!!

Very yummy lasagna. I substituted Ricotta for the Cottage cheese and used fresh spinach (one bag) instead of frozen. I also added a little bit of Fontina cheese.

Yummy comfort food!  I am sick and this really hit the spot to make me feel comfy while watching bad tv.  I strayed some from the recipe using what I had, but the basics are the same.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, about 1/2 the called for amount as per other reviews.  I sauteed a small amount of red pepper with the spinach/onion/garlic mix and used a heavy dose of italian seasoning instead of oregano/basil.  I also threw in some cumin and smoked sweet paprika.  I used an italian cheese mix instead of mozzarella and parmesan and about 3/4 box of whole wheat rotini instead of lasagna noodles.  I precooked the rotini and just mixed it all up like a baked ziti. Will definitely make this again!  Thanks!

This was a hit and so simple.  Used a good jar sauce Barillo with Vidala Onion and Merlot mixed with Hunt's 4 cheese sauce.  Excellent.  Will make again and again.

I just made it for the first time--the first lasagna I've ever made, actually--and it turned out GREAT. My husband even said it's the best lasagna he's ever had!
I just did a few things different from the recipe:
* doubled the oregano and basil
* 6 oz bag of fresh baby spinach instead of the frozen spinach
* a layer of ground turkey in the middle
* cilantro instead of parsley
I definitely recommend this recipe (with these changes :)).

Not bad, but would be much better with less spinach. Perhaps swap the second package of spinach for diced tomatoes, and cut down on the water added

I made this lasagna for a family supper last night and everyone loved it. I used cottage cheese unlike most of the reviewers but it turned out deliciously. If you're not so fond of spinach, you can always reduce it's amount or mix it in with another vegetable. I might even try that next time.

this is a wonderful veggie lasagna, though I agree with a lot of the others that you should use more sauce, I recommend at least 2 16 oz jars and a can of tomatoes or another 1/2 jar of sauce.  I also used broccoli and reduced a bit of the spinach, next time I may add some other veggies.  I also used the no boil noodles which is huge time reducer.

Fastest lasagna I've ever made!  I used cooking spray instead of EVOO and egg substitute to make it slightly leaner.  Big tip: subsitute an undrained can of diced tomatos for the water if you love tomatoes like I do!

This was an amazing Lasagna. I was throwing a dinner party and this was so easy to come together I didn't worry about the timing. I have gotten more complements about this lasagna than I can tell you. I would suggest putting more garlic (I used 4 good sized cloves) and double the other spices. Overall this lasagna looked amazing, and tasted even more so. All of my friends want the recipe, and there a bunch of picky 17-year olds. Great for Birthday parties.

Excellent!  We used half spinach and half broccoli.  Also subbed low fat ricotta for the cottage cheese.  Even my boyfriend, who doesn't particularly like ricotta or pasta really liked this lasagna.

this was a great recipe, except i only used 1 pkg of spinach and it was plenty. i also added about 2 cups of mushrooms and cooked them in with the tomato sauce. i wasn't sure how much 8oz equaled, but in a 9x13" pan, 9 lasagna noodles fit just right. Unless you like your sauce really runny, don't add the extra 1.5 cups of water to the sauce. Even without the water it was quite watery. A little extra mozarella to sprinkle on the very top and it's perfect!

This was excellent! I used cottage cheese mixed with a little ricotta, plus an extra egg to make it a little more wet. Used Kay's Spaghetti and Lasagna Sauce with ground beef from this site and added some extra brown sugar and salt.
I used full fat mozzarella which was delicious, but very bad on the diet. I also used shredded parmesan because I like this better than the grated stuff.
We really loved it and I will definitely be making this again!

This came out awesome.  I used 10 oz of frozen broccoli and 10oz of frozen spinach.  It was delicious.  I also only used a 26oz bottle of sauce (tomato and burgandy).  I broiled it uncovered for the last five minutes so it would be nice and brown and crispy on top.  I aslo used ready to bake lasagna.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I had a hard time following the recipe. This is my first time making a lasagne and the directions didn't seem clear enough. For example, "layer with 1/2 sauce and 1/2 cheese mixture"- am I supposed to cover half of the surface with each, or mix the two together, or use 1/2 of my total quantity of each? Also, it says to "finish with sauce". The picture for this recipe- and any lasagna I've ever had- finishes with cheese.

The taste was so-so for a vegetarian lasagna. As others said, too much sauce. Next time I will try a different vegetarian lasagna recipe.

This was delicious. Came out a little sloppy because my pan was shaped different. Will buy a disposable pan next time!

I'm a sucker for spinach lasagnas ever since I accidentally ordered one in my younger days. These were simply delicious! Yes, I have used cottage cheese instead of the popular choice of ricotta.  My family on the other hand, requested to add some meat in it.  Changes:  28oz sauce was enough, fresh basil, fresh 10oz spinach (sautéed with the onions), and 3 lasagna noodles in each layer.

Really good as recipe is!  It does seem to make a lot of sauce compared to the cheese but I just put twice as much sauce on the noodles per layer...  I used Barilla no cook lasagna noodles and left out the water.  Yummy and healthy with the cottage cheese-  no one knew it was not ricotta!

I made this last night for my family. It was a big hit. I added broccoli to the spinach/sauce portion and threw in mushrooms in between the layers. It was very good. Next time I'm going to switch out the water for red wine. I would have tried that last night, but I didn't have any on me at the time. We will be making this again!

I can't really eat dairy anymore, but this recipe was high on our rotation of meals before. We always used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Love all the spinach in it.

This was very good! I made my own spaghetti sauce, used non-fat ricotta and no-boil noodles. Instead of 2 10oz pkgs of Spinach I used 1 16oz. While this was very good the first time, reheated the spinach got very slimy! Next time I'll use 1 10oz pkg and see how that is. Otherwise, very yummy! Served with breadsticks and pesto.

I love this recipe. The only thing I did differently was use zucchini and broccoli because i didn't have any spinach. And I also used a cup of cottage cheese and a cup of ricotta only because I was concerned we wouldn't like all of that cottage cheese.

I think the egg makes all of the difference. I've never used an egg in lasagna before and it makes sense and makes it so much better! I would make this again and again using all kinds of veggies but spinach would be best with this. yum!

My meat-eating family loves this lasagna (and they had no idea that I used Dreamfield's low-carb lasagna noodles)! I add green peppers to the vegetable mix and love to experiment with different types of spaghetti sauces. When I make this dish, I also make a few single-serving lasagnas in miniature dishes for me to eat throughout the week. It's perfect!

This was DELICIOUS!  I made some changes.  I added canned sliced carrots that I chopped into smaller pieces to the sauce mix; I used whole-wheat lasagna noodles,  and instead of using the cottage cheese, I used ricotta cheese. My family & I loved it and it was very filling....  DELICIOUS!!!

Tasty! I made my own tweaks, because I'm just impatient! I cooked my noodles before layering them, hence I omitted the water. Also, I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage, and fresh herbs out of my herb garden! Result=Yummy, healthy version of lasagna! Even the man of the house liked it!!

My boyfriend made this for me, and it was so incredibly delicious.  He added more cheese on top for the last few minutes of baking.  I also recommend having some extra sauce on the side to top with (which we plan to do next time).  Cannot wait to have this again; it will definitely be something we make often.

This is a great recipe but like many reviewers said, be sure to have two boxes of lasagna noodles. I added chopped tomatoes and other veggies to the sauce mixture, and kept an extra jar of tomato sauce on hand--sure enough, I needed it for that top layer because my sauce mix from the recipe had thinned out to almost just veggies.  As long as you have extra sauce and noodles on hand, it's a great recipe! delicious.

I used one package of spinach, which seamed to be plenty. I added fresh chopped mushrooms to the spaghetti sauce. Instead of the 2 cups of cottage cheese, I used one cup of ricotta and one cup of tofu. Simple and yummy lasagna!

Great recipe; however, the lasagna filling seemed sparse even when I add plenty of cheese & spinach/sauce.  Next time I will add some vegetables to the sauce such as mushrooms, zucchini, yellow squash and carrots (julienned) to the sauce to give it a little more substance and texture, rather than comprising of mostly pasta.  Also, I used whole wheat pasta and no one could tell the difference.

This is such a hearty lasagna that even my meat loving boyfriend said it was a keeper!   I substitute one of the packages of frozen spinach with julienned carrots to add more color.  Other than that I don't change a thing.

This was just okay for me and my husband.  I thought there was too much sauce and definitely too much spinach.  I added about a cup of shredded carrots to break up the spinach, but it didn't help much.  The spinach flavor is overwhelming.  I prefer a spinach lasagna that calls for adding some well drained spinach to the ricotta cheese mixture and uses the cheese more as the filling.  I also found I needed more shredded mozarella and I added some freshly grated parmesan during the last few minutes of baking... I doubt I'll be making this again.

Everyone raved on this (not so for other veggie lasagne recipes I've tried). I didn't have enough spinach, so I used half spinach, half chopped frozen and defrosted brocolli. GREAT!

This is the best lasagna I have ever made!  It was wonderful and a complete hit with our dinner guests.  Make sure you add plenty of mozarella on top for melty goodness.

Mmmmm, mmmmmm this was so good!! I used 1 16 oz bag of spinach, 1 26 oz jar sauce, and I just skipped the water and cooked the noodles first. There was plenty of sauce and spinach mixture. I made my own pasta (Basic Pasta from this site), which I definitely recommend. Please try this if you are a vegetarian, or just want some veggies!!

My family really enjoyed this!  And they're pretty picky.  I added a few extra vegetables that added some taste too, such as broccoli and green pepper.  I also added a few more herbs and spices to my liking.  This recipe is really moldable, so you can adjust it to your needs.  I also used less cheese, and it still tasted great!

I really loved this recipe as did my whole family. The only thing that I did different was added an extra package of mozzerella cheese because I like a a cheesier lasagna. I also added a bit more fresh seasonings more parsley, fresh oregano, some thyme...It was delightful, and a big hit!

I'm new to cooking. It took me a little more time to prep than was said, but it was not difficult to do. My husband of 3 weeks was very excited and impressed that his new wife could make him a tasty lasagna. For those of you that want a little more nutrition, I used whole wheat lasagna and it tasted great. Also, I would recommend defrosting the spinach before putting it in with the onions and garlic to sautee.

I pretty much cut this recipe in half, because my husband doesn't eat spinach, and I didn't want to eat on it for days on end.  I used a glass loaf pan to cook it in, and cut back about 10 minutes of cooking time.  This was an awesome recipe.  I will definitely make it again, soon.

This was amazing! Changes I made: I used 2 cups ricotta cheese instead of the 2 cups of cottage cheese, I added mozzarella cheese to the top when I removed the foil, used fresh basil and oregano, used half the amount of spinach (I chopped it more after I took it out of the package), added 1 lb cooked hamburger meat, used 1 1/4 cups water instead of 1 1/2 cups. Even my 6 year old loved it!

Soggy. Partly my fault, though, as I added some red wine to the sauce. And the frozen spinach definitely needs to be patted dry. But with canned pasta sauce, the taste was nothing spectacular.

So this is how to make perfect lasagna! Why bother boiling the noodles, (I always did before), what a waste of time and extra cleanup , electricity and maybe even compromises the texture of the noodles and the flavor of the end product) I am so glad I came across this one. I added some grated swiss cheese also and it all came together wonderfully, taste was superb! It is the best I've ever eaten! I can't wait to serve this to my family and friends who are vegetarian! AWESOME recipe! Thanks for sharing this with everyone!

After I made some of the modifications listed in the comments here, this turned out quite nicely - everyone had seconds! I cut the spinach in half, used 2 jars of spaghetti sauce instead of one (Safeway's Verdi Arrabiatta worked well for me), used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, and used twice the number of noodles. I hate to modify things that much, but I don't see how this recipe would have worked without these changes. Still, credit where credit is due - this was a great place to start from!

I'm always trying new lasagna recipes because they're never just right.  Well, tonight I think I found the perfect lasagna recipe.  For a vegetarian lasagna, this was incredible.  I did double the spices, but other than that the recipe is great as is.  Everyone loved it.  The taste, appearance, consistency, everything... it was perfect.

I made this last night and it turned out delicious. I went with the 1/2 cottage cheese & ricotta that some people had been suggesting. It was easy to prepare and turned out great. Next time I will try fresh spinach & just use cottage cheese.

This recipe is very good, and a great way to get my picky toddler and hubby to eat their vegetables!  My husband did comment that it looked "funny," I'm guessing because there isn't any cheese on the top like my usual lasagna.  Next time I'll save some of the mozz and parm and sprinkle it on the top.  Otherwise, very very tasty!

This was wonderful! I have made "spinach lasagna" before but it was never this good!  I think it was because the spinach was in the sauce instead of the cheese or seperate.  Even my picky 5 year old ate it!  I really wanted to make something like this today, but didn't have lasagna noodles so I used egg noodles and it turned out great!  Thanks so much for a new family favorite!

Absolutely deliscious!!!  I only used 1 (10 oz.) bag of spinach.  And, I added yellow and green squash chopped up, which did not require me to add the water (There was enough from the veggies).  I did use the Fat Free cottage cheese (unlike many others reviewers who used Ricotta), and it came out perfect!  For the bottom and top layer of sauce, I just used the spaghetti sauce (without the veggies) and a sprinkly of mozzarella on top.  Prego makes a good "Mushroom Supreme" sauce that was fabulous for this dish.  I found a new favorite!!!  Thanks!

DELICIOUS! Only change was that I added the pasta water from boiling the lasagna instead of regular water and I added more spices like nutmeg(1/4 tsp) and cayenne pepper (1/2 tsp). Plus I added a bunch of other vegetables like celery, carrots, onions and whatever else I could find in the fridge. This recipe was just awesome!

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added some ground turkey to the sauce because my husband complains when I make meatless meals.  I thought that it was great and I love that there are nutrients from all of the spinach and that the cheese mixture is low fat.  Takes a bit of time to make, but we've been able to have letovers for lunch for a few days, so I guess it's worth the time up front.

Made a 1/2 batch.  It was a bit dry but not bad.  I think I would increase the tomato sauce by a fair bit next time.

Pretty good  but nothing I would rave about.  Needs a bit more flavor.  I even added 2 extra cloves of garlic.  Oh well! The boyfriend enjoyed it.

I give this a 4 star because nothing still can beat the regular meat lasagna but still for its group, this recipe is one of the best. I used  1 1/2 tsp of crushed garlic, fresh basil instead of dried, and substitute the water with spaghetti sauce. Oh, don't forget to blanch the spinach really quick in hot water and drain it before you use it in the lasagna mixture. 12 ounces of mozzarella  rather than 8. It's really yummy, we love it!.

Next time I think I will add more cheese to balance out all the spinach.  I had so much mixture that I ended up using the whole box of lasagna noodles (16 oz instead of the 8oz called for).

Take note of the size of the pasta sauce jar...really you need to be buying 2 regular-sized jars.

I love spinach...and this uses a lot of it.  I added more cheese to the dish and it was fantastic.  Also, doubled the garlic.

This was good, but not great. The spinach flavor was a bit more pronounced than I expected - the six-year-old bravely ate half of his serving before I took pity on him. However, the flavor had mellowed nicely the next day when I heated the leftovers. Oh, and I found that I needed to use all of a 16oz box of noodles.

My daughter really enjoyed this. I had to layer a little differently I started with lasagna as I don't think there would have been enough sauce the other way. Also when I cooked uncovered for the last fifteen minutes the spinach in the sauce started to go a little dark. Will make again though and maybe just give it five to ten minutes uncovered. Thanks

So Very Good!  I followed other reviewers and did the redwine/veg broth thing and ricotta/mozz instead of cottage cheese.  Topped with a feta/mozz mix and this was FAB!  The meatatarian hubby loved it.

Fantastic recipe!  I've made many lasagnas over the years in search of a great one and this one is finally it.  A few small changes seemed to give it a boost - I used fresh spinach, I substituted half the cottage cheese with low fat ricotta, I also substituted the water with 1/2 cup red wine and 1/2 cup chicken broth, and finally I divided the mozzarella and put half in the cheese mixture and half on top of the lasagna.

This is very good. I used Newmans Own Tomato Pesto sauce (26 oz), and (6oz) fresh chopped tomato's. I also used whole wheat lasagna noodles and substituted mushrooms for half the spinach.  I will use fresh basil, increase the spices and maybe try adding red wine (as suggested in another review) in place of half the water next time for an even tastier lasagna.  Thanks Laura!

Outstanding recipe! I used a 10oz bag of frozen baby spinach, a 28oz can of spaghetti sauce, and added 1 pound of ground venison that I had in my freezer to the sauteeing onions before adding the frozen spinach. For the 1.5 cups of water I used half water and half red wine. I was skeptical about the fat-free cottage cheese, but it came out delicious, very cheesy and not too heavy.

This was phenomenal. My husband said that I normally impress him with my cooking, but this recipe was really something special! We both ate huge helpings!

Very good recipe and a great way to use the fresh spinach we had in the refrigerator.  Used 1 bunch fresh and about 1/2 a box frozen, plus a package of fresh mushrooms, also substituted Ricotta for the cottage cheese, per suggestion.  Took a bit of prep time for a weeknight, but w/hubby helping out and it went a lot faster. Turned out great!  He even took the leftovers to work to share!

This came out for well for me after making a few alterations that others have mentioned below.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese; I only used 1 package of spinach; I added a jar of sliced mushrooms with onions sauteed; and I used no boil lasagna.  Great for lunch and dinner.  A definite keeper!

Pretty good! I used a mixture of fresh chard and spinach leaves, added 1/8 cup grated carrots, and used 3 cans of tomato sauce with fresh herbs instead of spaghetti sauce. I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. My only complaint is that the bottom of the pan seemed burned before the rest of lasagna was done. A very good way to sneak in veggies for picky kids!

I was OK once I made changes.  I did not use any water. I was already running. The spaghetti sauce made it bland so I had to add oregano, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. I won't make this recipe again.

I like any lasagna recipe that doesn't require me to precook the noodles!  However, I did run out of sauce, so I would increase the liquid by a cup and a half.  I like more sauce/vegetables than cheese, so otherwise, this was a good recipe for me.  If you don't love spinach, this is not the recipe for you.  But if you do, this is super easy to make!  I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese and 2 T of dried parsley instead of fresh.  Thought it was great with some extra shredded mozzarella on top!

I used a 9x13 pan and used 9 noodles for three layers. I followed the recipe, except I pre-cooked my noodles and omitted the 1-1/2 cups water. Also sprinkled on additional parmesan cheese to the last layer. Delicious lasagna recipe!

Everybody loved it for our vegetarian week premier! Slight changes: 24 oz. jar Ragu sun dried tomato and sweet basil, 1 cup water (this was plenty of liquid), 1/2 tsp. minced garlic from jar, one halved and sliced zucchini, 2 sm. cans mushrooms, fancy shredded Colby jack instead of mozzarella, 1/3 cup Parmesan, no parsley, no salt, 1/4 tsp. red pepper (in addition to black), 9 Prince lasagna noodles (pre-boiled in unsalted water just until pliable), lay 3 for each layer in a 9x11 pan. Adjust final baking time as necessary so top sauce layer doesn't look dried out. Yes, I used the cottage cheese 16 oz container. Delicious!

this lasagna was absolutely delicious! I halved the ingredients-- but put in the whole egg and used 4 teaspoons of dried parsley (didn't have fresh on hand) instead. I baked it for 40minutes with foil and 10minutes without foil. Turned out delicious!!!

Be sure to really drain the frozen spinach before you saute. I left out the Parmesan cheese the first time, which only made it slightly less fatty. Going to leave it in next time for a little more taste. Otherwise, it is a good recipe.

Just made this tonight, and it was delicious. Didn't have a big jar of pasta sauce, so I used a small jar, plus a can of crushed tomatoes and half of a vegetable buillon cube, cut down a bit on the added water, too. Also, I substituted ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese. It was delicious! To add to the presentation, I suggest topping with a little bit of parmesan, otherwise the dark spinach-tomato sauce looks too dreary out of the oven.

Yummy.  I made this for Thanksgiving.  Like others, I made it with ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  I also added in some chopped carrots and a big helping of cheese on top and only used probably less than half of the spinach that the recipe calls for.  It was the best lasagna I've made so far.  And, it worked out fine not cooking the noodles first, which I was a little skeptical about.

This turned out great! I made my own sauce by simmering roma tomatoes and a few tablespoons of water and then adding fresh basil-thin sauce but strong fresh tomato flavor that went great with all the spinach.  I stuck with the recipe and used cottage cheese and it was really good, no need to switch to ricotta for me.  I will definitely make this on a regular basis.

Awesome lasagna! I added ground turkey to it, and used half cottage cheese and half ricotta cheese. I also used 1 package frozen spinach and then put in some chopped fresh spinach as well. Awesome!

Very, very good!  I, too, used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  I also used a spicy arriabata tomato sauce (jarred)which gave a little heat.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was fantastic.  I followed it pretty much to the letter, but used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and used fresh spinach.  It was delicious.  I loved it, everyone had at least two servings, some had three.  It is also great the next day.  Will definitely make this a staple.

YUMMY!  I followed it exactly expect I used wheat lasagna noodles.  I was unsure about the cottage cheese but it tastes fantastic! I like this more than one of my favorite white lasagna dishes which is so much fattier. I love that this is low fat but big on taste.  THANKS!

I love this recipe.  Easy and fun to make.  I think cottage cheese is a great substitute for ricotta as it gives it the same texture with less fat.  Hearty and delicious!

I was a little skeptical in making this since I usually make meat lasagna. Then I wasn't sure if the spinach/sauce mixture looked appetizing...but when I served it...it was really, really good. One of my daughters took the first bite and she liked it alot. And so did the other. When it came it me, I was really impressed and happy it tasted really good. Better than I thought. We will be making it again and again.

This is a fantastic recipe. I've never made lasagna and never really even been a huge fan of it, but WOW! So good! I used fresh spinach (finely chopped) instead of frozen and used only half the amount called for. I also used leftover homemade spaghetti sauce that had ground beef in it and added a half pound of sliced, fresh mushrooms. The sauce seemed too thin to me after simmering for 20 minutes so I let it cook down a bit longer. Next time I would probably decrease the water a bit. Thank you very much, this was a hit! :)

Excellent.  Loved by my entire family, even the picky vege eaters gobbled it up.  Used slow cooker spinach marinara sauce from this site for sauce.

I added mushrooms and red pepper to the mix to add a little more substance.  It turned out great, even my husband who is a meat eater (but I am not)liked it. The only thing I would do next time is use a little less spinach.

This was my first time ever making or even tasting no-meat lasagna, so I was a little weary. But when I took that first bite, I knew this was a sure hit. I absolutely loved it. It's a great alternative to meat lasagna and I used whole grain noodles instead of the regular ones, and it tasted even better. Will definitely make again!!

I made this into a "low-carb" lasagna by substituting low carb rectangle wraps for the lasagna noodles. It was OK - it was a bit mushier/softer than regular lasagna - but ok. My kids didn't know the difference. I would probably make it again this way. I sprinkled the cheese on the top - the last 5 minutes of baking time - so the cheese will not burn.

This is a good recipe, very simple.  I felt like it was missing something like perhaps some eggplant or peppers.  I made this with the idea of being able to heat it up for dinner over the course of the week and it lived up to the plan very well.

This is my go to recipe for Lasagna! It is really good as it is, and altered.  I've made it several times, sometime adding less spinach and mushrooms.  Last time I used whole wheat noodles...really good! This is a really great basic recipe to play with.

Very tasty!  I used a package of fresh spinach instead of frozen, used a bit more tomato sauce and omitted the water.  I didn't mix any mozzarella with the cottage cheese, just sprinkled a little on top.  I also used whole wheat lasagna noodles- cooked first.  It was a nice change- alot lighter tasting than normal lasagna.

Very good.  My husband liked it and he is usually a meat guy.  Make sure you use a good spaghetti sauce, mine could have been better.  I added mushrooms and used ricotta.  Overall I didn't need as much of the cheese mixture it called for.

Absolutely delicious!!  I used ricotta and instead of cottage cheese, and I couldn't have asked for a better result.  I will make this again and again.

I was running low on noodles, so I only had enough to do two layers.  So my lasagna was: sauce, noodles, sauce, cheese mixture, noodles, sauce, cheese mixture, sauce.  It didn't matter though - it was wonderful!  I cut down the water to 3/4c. and added slice baby bella mushrooms to the sauteed spinach.  Fabulous. I will def make again!

We all loved this lasagna! The only changes I made were; I used 4 oz. of the cheese in the filling and 4 oz. for the top (which I waited to put on until the last 10 minutes), I added a package of mushrooms and sauteed them with the other veggies and I used a 9 oz. bag of fresh baby spinach. 
Super yummy. Highly recommend.

This was a great basic recipe.  I added Italian Sausage as a layer, used only 1 box of frozen spinach, used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and added a pinch of nutmeg to the ricotta mixture and it came out delicous!  My husband and son loved it.  I'll use this recipe for reference again!

This is a great base recipe. Delicious! I added shredded carrots and celery when sauteeing the onions and spinach. Then I stirred browned ground turkey into the vegetable mix. We are cheeseaholics, so I also added 8oz of low-fat Ricotta.
My family raved and we have enough for two meals!!!

Yummy, this tasted pretty good!  Since I only recently started cooking, being able to make this built my confidence quite a bit.  It did seem slightly too watery, but the flavors complemented each other very well!  I only had 1 package of fresh spinach, so it didn't have a strong spinach taste.  Maybe I'll use more next time and see if I like it.  And I'll probably use a bit less water.  Many thanks for sharing!

This lasagna is excellent! I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I added extra shredded cheese on top after the foil came off. I think I'll use precooked noodles next time, as mine got a littly "chewy."

Outstanding! I like to add mushrooms to this. My boyfriend who likes meat in dishes, didn't know this was meatless. The leftovers are great too. I sometimes freeze leftovers in Gladware containers and it tastes great reheated in the microwave. Much tastier for a quick meal than a frozen prepackaged dinner.

So easy to make, although I make my own sauce the night before so it's a little time involved but so worth it the next day. Great meal for the vegetarian, me, and the non-vegetarians too.

Very good!  I followed instructions, but used only about 16 oz. of spinach.  I also threw in red pepper into the sauce for spiciness.  As it was Christmas, ricotta was hard to come by, but I made do with cottage cheese and it tasted great.

This was  very disappointing. It took way too long to make it for the outcome. I have a few different lasagnas I make every now and then and they are easier to make and taste better, too. I was not impressed.

I followed the recipe exactly- used a good sauce but still didn't like it. My family loves cooked spinach and found that no one could eat any. Had to resort to Pizza for dinner instead.

Excellent! My husband and all four kids loved this. I did not have parmesan so deleted, made my own homemade ricotta (very simple), and made my own spaghetti sauce in order to try this. Will definitely make again- THANKS!!

Deeeeeelicious. It is a bit dry, so next time I'll keep some extra spagetti sauce on the side, and drizzle it on the finished product so I have something to wipe some garlic bread into.

This was a tasty recipe that got rave reviews from both my husband and 6 year old! I do however agree that 1 pkg of spinach is plenty for this recipe even if you decide not to substitute another veggie! All and all this is a GREAT lasagna that we will make often!

Question:  If you don't like spinach, why are you making a spinach lasagna and then complaining that it tastes like spinach?!   Another way to cut down on the spinach taste is to use chard instead of spinach.  Much milder taste.

I really liked this recipe.  I only used 1 frozen container of spinach.  I found that one regular size jar of spaghetti sauce was plenty.
very good and I will make it again!

Made this recipe as stated, except since my can of spaghetti sauce was only 26oz, I added a can of diced tomatoes with it.  The flavor was ok, but the top layer of noodles were still pretty crispy.  If I ever make this again, I will add more than the 1 1/2c water and more spices.

YUM!!! I added some ground beef to the sauce and used an italian seasoning mixture (which had savory and thyme in it as well as basil and oregano) I would also suggest getting more mozzarella if you want a gooey cheesy topping.
I will make this all the time!

Super yummy and easy! Went with the half ricotta/half cottage cheese. and half redwine/half veggie broth instead of water and it turned out great.  Was my first try at making lasagna.

Very good recipe; as per some other reviews, I used beef stock instead of water, used fresh spinach, added some mushrooms and topped with mozzarella.  I also used normal mozzarella, and ricotta cheese instead of cottage.  Makes perfect re-heatable lunches for work.

This was my first ever attempt at lasagna, and we loved it!  Per other reviewers, I used half low fat ricotta, red wine/veggie broth for the water, and put 1/2 the mozzarella on top.  Also used one box of spinach and about a pound of ground moose meat.  It ended up a little dry, but loved it anyway, and it was even better reheated for lunch the next day.

Too much spinach!  Don't get me wrong, I like spinach, but you could hardly taste the cheese and tomato sauce.  I think I will make it again, but I'm cutting the spinach in half and increasing the spices so it's not so bland.

Very, very good. I used one box of spinach and some zuchini and broccoli i had in the fridge. I also used a whole onion instead of just half. I followed other suggestions and used  ricotta cheese, and I also did half red wine, half water instead of just water. Next time I will probably use half red wine and half veggie broth, as it will probably give it more flavor. But this turned out sooo good, and I will definitely make it again.

This lasagna is awesome.  Not nearly so much chopping as is usually required for a vegetarian lasagna.  I was a little skeptical about not putting mozza on top, but it turned out great.  I also used whole wheat noodles, which worked fine.

Very good recipe! I only used one 10oz bag of spinach and added sliced black olives.  I also made extra sause and served it over some italian turkey sausage on the side for more protein.  I love how "light" it is compared to regular lasagna.  I have made spinach lasagna before but this one is the best I have come across!  Will definately make again and again!  Thanks!

this is a keeper! i changed it up a bit and used 3/4 pkg of frozen spinach as well as 1/2 pkg frozen broccoli. i also used about 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. instead of cottage cheese used 3/4 pkg of diced firm tofu and 1 small container of ricotta cheese. i served it with garlic bread and ceasar salad and even though it added an inch to each thigh it was well worth it! the leftovers are even better :)

At first, I thought this tasted like a "4 star" recipe, but this lasagna makes a great leftover, and my picky boyfriend loved it! Although, next time I make it, I will use less liquid. Truly a simple dish!

This was ok.  I added hot turkey sausage and I think it made it too salty.  I don't think that I'll make this again, seeing that there are so many other great recipes out there.

There is no good reason to use cottage cheese in lasagna. If your supermarket doesn't sell ricotta, ask them to - or go elsewhere to buy it. Cottage cheese definitely does not taste right in lasagna - or any other Italian dish. Your mileage, of course, may vary.

I didn't have mozzarella cheese so I substituted 8 oz. cream cheese.  I also add some chopped portabella mushrooms and topped it with some shredded cheese after taking off the foil. It wasn't enough cheese mixture to make two layers so I had to improvise. Overall it turned out delicious.  My family loved it.  I'm sure they will be eating all the left overs and we wont be throwing any of this out.

Super tasty! I used an extra 2 lasagna noodles, added another garlic clove, whole onion chopped, 2 tablespoons of Italian seasoning and sprinkled mozzarella on the top during the last 15 minutes.  I baked this uncovered for an hour and let it sit 15 minutes before serving. The noodles were perfect and it wasn't runny. My meat eater husband loved it!

This recipe was a hit! These are the changes I made -  I used oven- ready lasagna noodles (so I eliminated the water), added fresh mushrooms to the sauce and my jar of sauce was smaller than called for, only 21 oz. My layering ( in a 13x9 pan) went sauce, noodles, sauce, noodles, egg mixture, noodles then sauce. I put it in the oven , covered, for 45 minutes then took the foil off, topped it with more shredded mozzarella and put it back in for ~20 minutes. Came out perfect!

Everyone loved it!  Super easy.  The only thing I changed was I substituted the cottage cheese with Ricotta.

Bought large container of Ricotta. Followed recipe w/these differences: Used 2 c Ricotta in place of cottage cheese. Used 1 pkg ea frozen spinach/broccoli & 2 eggs. Preboiled noodles for 8 min.  Used 3 per layer. After Lasagna assembled had leftover noodles so made additional casserole: mixed remaining Ricotta in container w/same spices, 1 egg, Parmesan cheese & then laid noodle out flat and smeared some mixture over noodle. Rolled up. Repeat with all remaining noodles. Put some jarred spaghetti sauce in bottom of sm casserole dish, put rolled up noodles in dish, dump rest of jarred sauce over top. Cover with foil and cooked in over with Lasagna.

I loved it, I was worried that without ricotta it just wouldn't taste right but that was so not true. Using cottage cheese without ricotta( which is high in saturated fat) plus no meat and using spinach makes it so much healthier. OK still not "healthy" (3 cheeses) but for a healthier lasagna opt for this one, I give it an A+

This is an easy to prepare vegetarian lasagna. I used half spinach and half broccoli. I wasn't sure how it would turn out because I made it a day ahead, and I couldn't find any online advice about advance preparation of lasagna when using oven ready noodles. But it turned out fine. It seemed very wet when I took it out of the oven so I let it sit longer than 10 minutes before serving - probably between 15 and 20. It served up nicely and tasted great.

I tried this recipe for a family meal.  I wanted to enrich it so I added one green zucchini, 2 celery stalks, and 2 peppers, one yellow, one orange.  I used 2 jars of sauce and oven ready noodles.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese  (yuck).  I used tons of mozzarella because we weren’t having meat and i wanted my “men” (husband and 3 sons) to feel satisfied.  It was so good.  I will make it again!

I used one spinach package and included diced veggies to it (mushrooms, peppers, zucchini) I kept a little tomato sauce separate from that, to use on the final top layer.  I kept the cottage cheese in the recipe because it's easier to spread.

This is absolutely amazing!! In my husband's words, "f**king PHENOMENAL!!" hahaha! I changed up two things. I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and Alfredo sauce instead of marinara.

The suggestion was to use turkey as an alternative, so I decided to try the recipe with spinach AND turkey! Tasted great.  The changes I made were largely due to what I had on hand:  low fat cottage cheese (vice no fat), dried parsley, extra garlic, and 1+ (6oz) package of fresh spinach.  Also, I must have been blind, but I didn't see the 1 1/2 cups of water until just now - It still all worked fine!!

FYI: It's been a long time since 32-ounce jars of pasta sauce have been available. Way back when (decades ago!), 32 and 16 ounce jars used to be standard sizes in supermarkets. But they've long since shrunk to about 24 ounces and 14 ounces, or thereabouts, and they still seem to be shrinking! Also, the unspecified "lasagna pan" called for by this recipe seems to be a 3-quart glass or ceramic dish, or a 9x13 metal pan (although a 4-quart rectangular dish or a 10x15 roasting pan might give you more elbow room!).

This lasagna was really nice, unfortunately I didn't have all the ingredients, (probably cottage cheese is key in having a yummy moist filling) so I had to make some changes...nevertheless, I'm going to make this again and update!

Would use ricotta instead of cottage cheese and would continue to use fresh spinach (about 20 ounces) sauté the onion first then add the spinach sautéing until spinach is wilted then add minced garlic. My husband stated that next time substitute a mild red wine for the water.

I used extra Ragu instead of water,  ricotta instead of cottage cheese, 15 oz chopped spinach, and I put the mozzarella cheese on top instead of with the ricotta mixture.  Next time I'll add some water and lots of mushrooms.

I used a whole onion, fresh spinach instead of frozen, and two eggs instead of one. I added sweet peppers, wild mushrooms, and some sliced olives. I only had a 26 jar of spaghetti sauce, so I added a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes. Next time I will do the same thing except omit the water- the can adds sufficient water. Great base recipe.

Delicious, but I did make a couple of changes.  I used regular cottage cheese and added shopped squash and a can of mushrooms (chopped)).  I made it in two 8" pans so I could freeze one for later.  I reduced the cooking time to 50 min. and then 10 min.  It was slightly overdone so will reduce a bit more next time.   Paul Newman's "Sockeroony" pasta sauce is super with this recipe.

Great recipe.  Rave reviews from my company.  I did add shredded zucchini and chopped mushrooms and left out the water.  Assembled  a day ahead with the no cook lasagna sheets.  Used Costco organic marinara sauce.  Yum!

Delicious.  Added more garlic and mushrooms.  Substituted ricotta for cottage cheese.  Used vodka sauce instead of marinara sauce. And used fresh pasta versus dried- which allowed for not adding water and reduction of baking time.  After 30 minutes of covered baking, I turned on the broiler and removed the foil and added some shredded cheddar cheese and a mixture of fresh spinach and arugula.  Very easy and yummy

I have made this four or five times since discovering this! I love love LOVE this recipe! I did make one change. Instead of using 2 10oz packages of frozen spinach, I put 1 6oz package of fresh spinach (chopped), and it tastes delicious. I think 2 10oz packages is too much. Other than that, I will continue making probably bi-weekly! The future husband loves as well.

This is truly the best vegetable lasagna I have ever had in my life!! Even my picky eater ate the entire serving....I made it exactly as the recipe states, the only changes I  made were I used rice noodles which came with a few more noodles and I used fresh spinach instead of frozen. Delicious!! Thank you for a new favorite recipe.

I have a friend who is a vegetarian. WOW! It was great! Super easy and impressive to serve. I did not dilute the sauce with water - just added more sauce for the simmer. I am going to try it using meat next time!

This was as simple as it says it is.  The changes I made were I used 2 eggs because they were small, added ground turkey and used fresh spinach. I purchased two 10oz bags of fresh spinach an sautéed them as instructed in the directions. It turned out very good.

My family loves this!  I made a few alterations:  I use half the amount of spinach and add 1 1/2 pds of turkey meat.  I also like ricotta cheese so I use half the amount of cottage cheese and do the other half in ricotta cheese.

It's delicious! 
I never use eggs in my lasagna, and did not this time.  I also used her ty vegetable and mushroom and pepper sauces instead of caned tomatoes and paste. I also added carrots and Bell pepper, and no boil noodles. Turned out exquisite!  I'll definitely do it this way again, mxing the veggie mix with the cheeses.

I made some substitutions/omissions for lack of having ingredients but it still came out great.  I had Ragu Chunky Garden sauce so that added some veggies.  It was only a 24 oz jar.  Rather than open another jar, I put in a 12 oz can of diced tomatoes.  I liked having the chunks of tomato in the final product.

So delicious! After reading the reviews, I too switched the cottage cheese out for ricotta. And I used penne (I know, not really a lasagna since I did that) because I couldn't find gluten free lasagna noodles. But the flavors were still spectacular, and my family had no idea I was slipping them spinach. ;-)

I used a homemade spaghetti/lasagna sauce  and substituted 2 layers of fresh spinach in place of the frozen since I had it on hand. The homemade (crockpot spaghetti sauce) sauce MADE this dish! My best lasagna yet!!!

Great taste.    I substituted ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese, and used gluten free pasta instead of the lasagna noodles, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The flavors blend so well that you hardly taste spinach (which is surprising given the amount of spinach in the recipe)… or tomato sauce…. or garlic, but somehow it's just delicious.  My husband, who does not like spinach, liked this recipe.

Absolutely delicious! Made a few changes:  I skipped the egg and Parmesan cheese, used 1 pound of mozzerela and used pre- cooked the noodles. Used fresh basil and thyme from my garden. Shortened cooking time by 10 minutes.  Covered dish with 2 cups of shredded mozzarella and broiled it for a few minutes.  Pretty sure it's the best lasagna I've ever made!

Great lasagne! Substituted the cottage cheese with ricotta, used a whole onion, a head of garlic (just love garlic!) and used Italian seasoning blend instead of the separate spices.  The increase on the spices is just based on a personal preference. My Dad who is not a fan of lasagne thought it was good, probably because the spaghetti sauce is not as acid as the usual tomato paste. Staying in the recipe box for future rotation.

I was REALLY impressed with this recipe, but I only gave it 4 stars because like many others, I made some changes to it. Instead of cottage cheese, I used like 3/4 cup of ricotta cheese and increased the Parmesan cheese to a cup and the Mozzarella to like 1 1/4 cups. I only used 1-10 ounce bag of spinach. That was really MORE than enough. And I topped off the lasagna with a bit more mozzarella after I took the foil off.

Made this last night for friends.  My husband and friends loved it!!  Seconds all around.  I too replaced cottage cheese with ricotta (used a bit more than recipe calls for) and used 2 jars of sauce so it was very moist (half a jar I served in a bowl for ladling).  I liked the spinach taste so definitely think 2 packages is the way to go.  This is a keeper - even my 23 year old son came home and raved about the leftovers!

I had a ton of spinach to use up, so I used all that was called for.  I don't think I would again; it was a bit heavy on the spinach and a bit scant on the sauce for me.  We liked it, would probably just alter the amounts a bit next time.  I used fresh spinach and just processed in the food processor to chop it.  Very easy too.  Thanks for the recipe.

This came out good, but a little too salty.  I'll leave out the salt next time and also add another cup of cottage cheese.

Here are the changes I made:  I used ground turkey, only 1 box of creamed spinach, and ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Because of those changes, this version tasted pretty close to the meat lasagna with red sauce I make.  However it gets 4 stars because my kids liked it even with the spinach!

I made this the other night for my mom and brother; it was just as good the next day and the leftovers didn't last long.  I thought it was good, but I've never had lasagna before (yeah, I know, I'm weird).  They both really liked it.  A few changes I made were using 8oz fresh chopped baby spinach instead of canned and using an 8 oz carton of beef stock instead of the water, and increasing the sauce to two 28 oz cans.  I used Bertoli "Marinara with Burgundy" and their five cheese sauce.  I might just use two jars of 5-cheese next time.  I also used the whole 16 oz box of noodles. I also might get more mozzarella to put on the top for next time.  But, really good!  Apparently I've been missing out by not eating lasagna all these years...

Thsi lasagna was fantastic and all of my roommates loved it. Of course, I put a little extra mozzarella on top because I love cheese and I'm sure that took away from the low-fat factor, but it was still awesome.

Very easy and tasty recipe! I added more cheese, but other than that it was perfect. I will make it again for sure.

This is extremely easy to make, but is bland. I almost double the spices to give it some flavor.

I've had better from different Spinach lasagnea recipes on this site. Maybe the spaghetti sauce I used wasn't that great, but this was just a mediocre recipe at best.

Okay, this recipe is FABULOUS!!!  My daughter, who hates spinach, gobbled it up and said I have to make it from now on. This is one of the best lasagna's I have ever made. The only thing I changed and recommed doing. FORGET dried herbs of any kind!  Use fresh herbs, it is always better. Dried herbs just don't have the same flavor.

I love this recipe! I'm a vegetarian and I use it when my non-veg friends come over for dinner...they're never disappointed that there's no meat. I've tried grated parmesan cheese instead of grated along with a three cheese spaghetti sause which made it just slightly more cheesy, which was great. I've also tried mushrooms in the sauce, also a good addition.

I thought this was good - but there seemed to be something missing.. I can't pinpoint what that "something" could be, at this time. It tasted good enough that I'll probably make this again in the future but maybe I'll tweak the it a bit such as by substituting ricotta for the cottage cheese as others suggested.. and maybe adding a bit more seasoning.

Yummy and easy!  I used Barilla Mushroom&Garlic pasta sauce and substituted low-fat ricotta for the cottage cheese.  I also squeezed out the excess water from the spinach after thawing.  I had guests over for dinner, and everyone loved it.

This was my first attempt at making lasagna, and it was so easy and tasted delicious!  Very flavorful, too.  My boyfriend told me it was the best meal I've ever made!  I'll definitely make this again.

flavorful and good- i used the the best marinara sauce in place of the canned; maybe thats why it turned out a little runny for me (it firmed up quite nicely after a night in the fridge). used fresh spinach, mushrooms (in place of 1/2 spinach); upped the oregano and the basil to 1 T each; used both ricotta and cottage, and used only 1 c of the mozzerella.  also only used an egg white- dont need the whole egg.b

my husband liked it even without meat.  i found that using half the spinach was quite enough.  i add just a bit of sugar to the sauce too.

I altered the recipe, too: 1 10 oz. package of broccoli in place of one of the packages of spinach and ricotta cheese in place of the cottage cheese. I used low-fat ricotta, but the consistency was too thick so I added half and half! I thought it was a bit too salty, perhaps because of the cheese substitution. I'd definitely make this again, and probably just eliminate the salt.
