What a find! This recipe is fantastic! I'm a fan of tabbouleh, and this recipe contains a lot of the ingredients found in that. My plan was to make this for my family, but I just proceeded to eat the entire bowl myself. I made it with plain, long-grain white rice (didn't have basmati). And next time I make it (which will be today), I think I'll omit the olives because as much as I love them, they tended to dominate (rather than compliment) the other flavors in the salad. Adding pistashio nuts is a stroke of genius! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this recipe for a BBQ at our house this summer and my guests loved it so much I had to make a second batch! I used tomatoes from my garden and the lemon, mint and parsley makes it so fresh-tasting! The olives give it a nice saltiness and the pistachios are crunchy. Loved this recipe. Will definitely use it over and over again.

Good, but I would up the amount of pistachios because their flavor got lost in the mix.

I think it is the dressing that I did not like about this recipe. The ingredients are all spot on but the overall flavour did not impress me. Even my husband did not really enjoy this and he likes EVERYTHING.

This is good both cold as a salad and warm as a side dish.  I think the mustard overshadows the mint, so I might do one or the other.  I'll report back after I try it each way.  Thanks for sharing!
