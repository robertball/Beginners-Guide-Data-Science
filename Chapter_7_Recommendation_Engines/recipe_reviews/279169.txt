I thought it was very tasty, although my husband thought it needed some hot sauce.

Loved it. I made it with yellow and brown lentils and ham. Didn't use the spinach or aminos. One of my favorite soups. Just cooked on top of stove.

I doubled all the veggies and used fish sauce.  Lacked a little piazza so put a little Chinese chili garlic sauce Had it with cheddar beer bread.

Easy to make and will make it again.  Next time will add sliced or ground sausage.
