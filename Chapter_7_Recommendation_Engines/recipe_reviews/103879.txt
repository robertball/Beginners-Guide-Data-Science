This is a very good steak sauce. Will try with boneless thighs or breasts next time with these changes: Sub in chicken stock for the Bar-B-Que sauce and add a tbl of brandy.

Taste is good but the cream separates instantly on contact of the heat. I will make this again but will wait to put the cream in after the rest is heated up some. Good on taste but not as good on the eyes.
