We really liked this and while substitutions are sometimes okay, you really must use the leeks.  They lend a subtle flavor that elevates the dish beautifully while still keeping it simple. Have to admit that I forgot to add sour cream and Dijon (it'd been a really long day) but we loved it anyway. Know the difference those ingredients will make and plan on making again In its entirety. My apologies to review traditionalists but hope to update  in near future.

I didn't have the wine and mustard on hand, but this was a very nice dish!  Hard to know what to do with leeks.  This was also pretty low carb by itself.

So good. The flavours are so mice in this. Made it exactly like the recipe for my daughter and her family and it was such a big hit. This is a keeper.

Excellent!  A few minor changes.  I do not use sour cream.  I substituted 1 cup 2% lactose free milk with 1 tablespoon melted butter added to it.  I used a little less chicken broth than the recipe called for.  Added a little garlic to the leek/mushroom mix. Definitely a keeper!
