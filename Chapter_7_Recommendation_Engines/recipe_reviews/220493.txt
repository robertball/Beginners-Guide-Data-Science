Very simple sloppy joe sauce. I did add in some fresh minced garlic--that was the only addition I made. I actually did NOT use this as sloppy joe sauce, I used this as a quick hot dog sauce. The boys thought it was great having "sloppy joe dogs". I'll make this again.

I have a similar recipe using 1# grd beef, med onion, 1/2 c ketchup, 1/2 c Open Pit BBQ sauce, 1 tsp prepared mustard and 2 T. brown sugar.  Sometimes I add a little chopped green/sweet pepper.  Very Yummy!  I'll will try Terri's to compare.

I like sloppy joes very much and husband dislikes them very much. He enjoyed this recipe a lot and used the leftovers for his lunch. When I asked if I could make them again he was all for it. Hip Hip Hooray I can enjoy Sloppy Joes once more.

No kidding, the best Sloppy Joes I've ever had.  Of course, flavour will change depending on the BBQ sauce you use, but I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe!  Only thing I changed was by adding finely chopped veggies.  It's the only way I can get my family to eat the healthy things.

I made the sauce in my crock pot while browning the ground beef and onion. I substituted brown sugar for white. Drained the beef and added it to the crock. There didn't seem to be enough sauce so I added an additional 1/2 C. ketchup, 1/2 C. bbq sauce, and 1 Tbsp of brown sugar. (I didn't add any additional vinegar or mustard.) I added 1/4 C. water and 1/4 C. frozen green pepper. Let it simmer on low for 1 hr stirring occasionally. This was absolutely wonderful! The entire family went back for seconds. I will definitely be making this again :)

LOVED this recipe.  It was easy, quick and had an amazing taste.  It is the perfect combination of sweet (BBQ sauce & sugar) and sour (mustard & vinegar).  We will be keeping this one close on hand.

Great basic sloppy recipe. You could easily make additions to dress this up and customize it, but it is great as is. I used onion powder (1 tsp) instead of an onion and cider vinegar. For a no frills basic recipe, this is fantastic!

This recipe was not the sloppy joe I was hoping for, the other sloppy joe on this website using condensed tomato soup was much better, but I forgot to grab the soup so we decided to try this one. This one was just too rich. The flavor of ketchup was overwhelming.

This is a keeper.  The only thing I did diff. was use rice vinegar (didn't have plain), sub'd brown sugar for white & spicy brown for yellow mustard.  Oh so good; served at a kids bday party -- big hit!

Yummy, yummy.  I used the basic recipe, 3 parts ketchup to 1 part bbq sauce plus 1T sugar (I used brown), 1T mustard (dijon), 1T vinegar (cider).  In addition to the onion I chopped super fine 1 stalk of celery, 1 carrot, 1/4 c green pepper, 1 clove minced garlic.  Cooked the veggies about 8 minutes in olive oil to soften them before adding the meat to brown.  Veggies were well-hidden from the anti-veggie teen son but I feel it made things a bit healthier.  Because my hubby was late coming home I left it simmering almost 1 hour so I added 1c water to keep it 'sloppy'.  For the bun, I could eat this with a fork alone!

Very good. I made open-faced and added in some mozzarella into mix and also on top before baking off to melt cheese topped on mix on hamburger buns. Used half bbq and half ketchup in mix as well as brown sugar for white. Added a little extra vinegar as mix was quite sweet. Will def make again but add some spice and cut sugar to make up for some of sweetness. Good as is tho!

Loved this, so simple. I used Ground turkey instead of ground beef and I didn't have any vinegar so I left it out. I also used brown sugar instead of white. I love when I can make a recipe without buying anything from the store =D

This was super easy and my husband and kids loved it! I actually forgot the sugar, but it was still very sweet without it. I added a little water to it (about 1/2 c.), too, just to stretch it out a little further and that made no difference.

This was a hard sell in our house. My husband and I have used Manwich for years but my daughter told me that they never use the stuff, only use this recipe. So went ahead and made it, even with my husband balking the entire way....until he tasted it. Take one more convenience food off our list!! This was perfect and haven't bought the canned stuff since!!

YUM! I have always used McCormick Sloppy Joe Seasoning mix to make my Joes as I don't like Manwich. I wanted to try something new for my daughter's basketball team and this looked good and simple. I will make my Joes this way from now on! I took others' advice and used 1 part ketchup and 1 part bbq sauce. I used Kraft Honey bbq and did not add any sugar. It is plenty sweet without, and has a great bbq flavor without being overpowering.  Served on hollowed out bolillo rolls with potato salad - this meal easy, fun and loved by all!

I made this and thought it was really good, and my BF loved it, too. Simple and just as easy as the canned stuff but better. :) You can taste the BBQ sauce pretty strong, so make sure that you use one that you like, and avoid using one that's too sweet -- I just used Kraft Original myself, might try a hotter one next time. I tasted as is and added a bit of salt, pepper and garlic powder due to personal preferences, but it's great as written, too.

This is a very simple and great tasting sloppy joe recipe. I did alter the recipe a little. I changed the sugar to brown I think brown gives better flavor than just plain white. I also flipped the amounts of ketchup and bbq sauce also because bbq gives more flavor than ketchup. I used apple vinegar just because that is what I had on hand.
I have had people asking for the recipe which that speaks for this recipe so try it I'm sure you will like it!

I love Sloppy Joes and have always used the canned stuff, but my husband is not a fan.  I tried this recipe and he loved it!  The whole family did.  It was easy and delicious.  I added a diced bell pepper and some garlic and used brown sugar.  Thanks for sharing!

Was going to make sloppy joes for dinner but didn't have any mix so went to computer and found this recipe. I will never buy the can stuff again. This was really good made sliders out of this, with Hawaiian bread rolls, so good.

Here's how our conversation went:
Me: "how do you like it?" Husband: "it's really good." Me: "as good as the old school kind from the can?"
Husband: "way better! We should call it anal-retentive joes, because these are the opposite of sloppy." 
My husband and I LOVE these!
The only changes I made were out of necessity & preference: I used turkey instead of beef bc we gave most beef up. I actually squeezed the onions through my garlic press bc i like the taste of onion but hate the consistency, and the flavor bc of that was so well rounded and perfect. And I used white wine vinegar bc that's what I had.

It was super easy, really quick, and so delicious! I had no idea it would be that simple! Well be diving into the leftovers as soon as we have a chance!

I love the simplicity of this recipe- everything on hand and quick. I would recommend not using a BBQ sauce that is very bold. My first attempt tasted basically just like the bottled sauce.

I added just a little bit of Worcestershire sauce and it was fantastic. I was also in a rush, so instead of letting it thicken on its own, I added just a little flour. It was GREAT!

Added a diced, half green bell pepper but other than that....I followed the recipe.  This is my son's hands down favorite of everything we make at home.  It has become a 2-3 times a month staple!

For the first time EVER making Sloppy Joe’s from scratch (I’ve always used the mix), this turned out rather well. I followed the directions to the end, but it didn’t seem to make near enough sauce for us, so I adapted it a little to suit us. I added a really healthy squeeze of tomato paste and a cup of water, combining these with the balance of the sauce.  When tasting, it was way too tomato tasting for us so I added a heaping tablespoon of sweet salad cubes to the mixture to cut the acidic taste. I know - but try it next time you make Sloppy Joes, it gives them a really good flavor. After the mixture was to our taste, I turned the mixture to low, covered and simmered for 15 minutes. It turned out perfect. Thanks, Terri, for the great inspiration!

Very good. I made one small change--I drained the ground beef/onion mixture after browning. When I made it a second time, I  included equal parts (1/2 cup each) of ketchup and BBQ sauce.  It improved the flavor.

Kids liked it!  I used honey bbq sauce (that's what I had on hand), a 1/4 of garlic powder, and added a cup of finely diced green bell pepper.  Since honey bbq sauce was used, I did not add sugar.  That would have made it too sweet.  Next time I'll make a double batch so I can have it handy for when I'm pressed for time.

This recipe was only ok.  The only change I made was to add a clove of garlic.  It was too greasy, but the recipe didn't say to drain the hamburger after browning, so I didn't.  I used a low fat hamburger, but still too greasy.

Perfect!  Better then those package seasonings from the grocery store.  I used brown sugar rather then white, but I'm sure it wouldn't change much.  This is a keeper!

Really easy to make with only a few basic ingredients that are always on hand- and my summer campers loved it! (The staff did too.) This will go into our rotation. Oh- I use ground turkey instead of beef- no one can tell the difference and it's healthier for us and the planet.

Very quick and easy to make. I was craving sloppy joes tonight and this definitely hit the spot. My husband absolutely hates onions so I subbed in a clove of minced garlic. This was very zesty, my only complaint is that it was a little too sweet for my taste. Next time I will decrease the white sugar and will try adding some chilli powder to being some spice. Thanks for a new recipe for the rotation!

This recipe is great! I just left out the vinegar, added some brown sugar, and added more ketchup.

My whole family loved this, even my super picky husband but we found it way to sweet. Won't add the sugar next time and hopefully that will help. Added a teaspoon is Worcestershire sauce and that perked it up quite a bit. Next time will add liquid smoke as well.

To us it was liked ground beef mixed into a thick, heavy, doctored ketchup/barbecue sauce. It was okay, but our family didn't feel this was really a sloppy joe sauce. This recipe just isn't for us, but others liked it per the reviews.

EXCELLENT recipe, better than any other homemade sloppy joe recipe I've tried, and beats anything out of a can by miles. It's not too tangy like most of the others, but it's not too sweet either. Perfect for my husband, me and our 6-year-old. Highly recommended exactly as is.

This was good, but a bit too sweet for us. I guess it probably depends on your barbecue sauce. Ours was a mild sauce that was already on the sweet side, though not super-sweet. It didn't need the sugar, and I think I would use more mustard if I made this again. Good general recipe though, so thanks!

This is a great recipe.  I do it with ground turkey which I season really well while it is cooking with the onions...and I use Stubb's "regular" BBQ sauce (as we are in Austin, TX).  I serve whole wheat buns and it is a real crowd pleaser.  It's even better as left overs...

We used this recipe last month in our monthly kid-friendly freezer cook group and it was a hit in all 5 families with elementary kiddos.  The recipe froze and reheated well.  Perfect with a fruit and veggie side for dinner after a day full of activities.

A nice basic recipe.  I do not care for sweet sloppy joes so I did leave Out the sugar.  I kept al the other ingredients the same and LOVED it.  All the kids loved it too!

Excellent recipe.  I subbed in wholegrain mustard for prepared mustard, and I added a couple cloves of crushed garlic and a small amount of cayenne.  The sauce was thick but not overly sweet or "ketchupy", it sat on the bun well and didn't make it soggy or greasy.  My wife said these were the best sloppy joe's she's ever had, and I'm inclined to agree.  This recipe is a keeper!

In place of BBQ sauce, I used a can of Condensed Tomato Soup and only a Teaspoon of Cider vinegar. We all thought it was quite good. I will use this recipe again. Yummmy!

Simple, fast and tasty.  I like my sloppy joes a little saucier, so I had to almost double the sauce recipe.  The flavor was great though!

I was looking for my Sloppy Joe recipe in my recipe book and couldn't find it.  Knowing that I had Allrecipes.com to turn to, I quickly looked up a Sloppy Joes recipe and I had all the ingredients on hand.  I gave my son a spoonful to try right before putting it on a bun, and he gave me a huge thumbs up and said it was the best so far.!  Enough said!
