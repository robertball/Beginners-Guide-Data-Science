This was great.  Didn't miss the noodles.  It was just a bit runny so next time i would salt the zucchini and let it sit in a colander for 30 minutes.  That should draw out some of the liquid.  I also used more tomato sauce than was called for and more mozz. cheese.  I'm going to try it with eggplant next time!

Super yum! True, you can tell there's no noodles, but we ate it with some toast and that satisfied the starch craving. I made some adjustments to (a) reduce the fat, (b) work with what I had on hand, (c) reduce the liquid, and (d) fit it in an 8x8-inch pan (I only cook for 2). It turned out great! So delicious that I had it for leftovers the next day, and I do not like leftovers.

My adjustments:
1. Salted the zucchini and placed it in a colander at the very beginning, and also carefully drained excess liquid from the dish right after removing it from the oven.
2. Ingredients adjustment: 3 med zucchini, 1/2 lb lean ground turkey, 1/2 med onion, 1/2 red bell pepper, 1/4 cup pre-packaged shredded carrots, 1/2 jar spaghetti sauce, 2/3 cup low-fat ricotta (in place of cottage cheese), 1 egg white. I kept the amounts for the garlic, spices, and other cheeses the same, but used part-skim moz.

Wonderful recipe!  To lower the fat, I used low-fat mozzarella and 2% cottage cheese.  In response to other reviews commenting on the dish being too watery, I took all possible precautions.  I drained the tomato sauce, drained the cottage cheese, and "sweated" the zucchini. Here's how:  Place cut slices in colander and sprinkle VERY generously with salt.  Let sit for 30-45 minutes, while chopping veggies, grating cheese, and cooking tomato mixture.  Rinse zucchini thoroughly and absorb any water with paper towel.  After all this, I only had about 1/4 cup liquid in the entire dish.  I simply tilted the dish and let it drain out.  Everything stayed together wonderfully and tasted fantastic!

This is my absolutely FAVORITE recipe that I saved to my recipe box.  I try to watch what I eat, and this recipe provides a strong, rich taste of a "unhealthy dish" without all of the added carbs and fat.  Two things I do when I make this recipe - replace the ground beef with ground turkey meat, use tons of fresh basil instead of dried ground basil.  The basil leaves end up leaving an incredible flavor, and are very tasty.

I have been making zucchini lasagna for years and I found if you put your sliced zucchini under the broiler for a few minutes to draw out the water that works better then the sweat method by using the salt.

Excellent!  I did make a few changes though to fit my tastes.

I used red pepper instead of green (less acidic).  I doubled the cheese amounts, used trader joe's 3-cheese spaghetti sauce, and I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Otherwise I made it to a tee, and it turned out WONDERFULLY.  I will be making this again and again.

Very good & we did not miss the noodles!  Tried this as a low carb dish and will put this in my make it often file.  I made the sauce sans meat, and used a large can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato paste, plus a can of beef broth.  Also used more veggies including some chopped mushrooms, lots of fresh garlic and celery.  Also used some red pepper flake and a lot of fresh basil at the end. I let this garden sauce simmer until it was fairly thick and our casserole was not watery at all.  Put the parmesan right in with the non-fat cottage cheese as well as some garlic powder.  I will try putting some ground beef and maybe some turkey sausage next time.  Thanks for submitting this!

This was a very delicious meal.  It was easy to make and had that lasagna feel to it. Next time I make it, and I will make it again very soon, I am going to try dry cottage cheese instead of regular and let it sit a hair longer since it was a bit 'sloppy'.  I also used fresh mozza and a red pepper for personal preference.  I would also double the ingredients since I didn't get enough leftovers! Nonetheless it was delicious.

This was quite tasty, but as other reviewers have mentioned, it is very watery. I salted the zucchini beforehand, and I still had about a cup of liquid at the bottom of the pan. Next time I think I will salt the zucchini for a longer period of time and grill them slightly before assembling the lasagna. I also might use a combination of zucchini and eggplant, since eggplant isn't nearly as watery.

awesome recipe to use up my garden veggies!  thank you for this creative recipe!  i tried to "sweat" the zukes like someone recommended, but it must not have worked well - my dish came out watery like the others.  it wasn't a bid deal, though - i just spooned out the water when i got it out of the oven.  honestly, my husband didn't know there weren't noodles!  we added salad and toast and a glass of red wine for a delicious dinner.  if anyone is wondering - this is 4 weight watchers points per serving!!!

Very tasty. We really didn't notice the noodles were missing. The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star was it is very watery and while cooking I had to keep draining off the water. Next time I make this I will try par cooking the zuccini first.

My family and I loved it! You can tell they are not noodles of coarse. I used yellow squash and followed the recipe and it came out great! A simple way to get in those extra veggies.

Pretty darn good! I didn't have a problem with it being too watery. I used full fat ricotta cheese and added a good amount of fresh garlic. My daughter loved it, and it was an awesome option for me since I can't eat wheat. I haven't had lasagna in a very long time! So glad I tried this recipe!!

I loved this recipe! I used chicken instead of beef, and it was delicious! My kids weren't excited about the zucchini, but... they're kids. It was great!

Followed the recipe exactly, except changed cottage cheese for ricotta.  This didn't even turn out too watery for us (I used a totally huge zuchinni, rather than 5 little ones!)  Will definately make this again.  YUM!

My husband and I started making this recipe last summer when I had an abundance of squash to use up.  Now it's a stable in our home.  I change the veggies based on my mood.  Everyone who tries it loves it and asks for the recipe.

Though I did enjoy the recipe, I cannot get over how so many people said they "couldn't tell it wasn't real lasagna noodles...".....I definately could, but like I said, it was enjoyable.  MY only issue was it came out VERY VERY watery and also the Zucc's were not tender.  Next time, I will try to slice them thinner (which should be fun - lol) and also maybe press them a bit in the attempt to get some of the water out.  Besides those two issues, though, it was flavorful and I am going to try to make it again.

I adore this recipe. Sometimes I add hot pepper sauce to spice it up, but otehrwise no changes. I've never had trouble with it being juicy as long as I cook it long enough and let it sit for a few minutes before cutting it.

We love this!  I marinated my zucchini in olive oil, minced garlic, and lemon, then sauteed it to reduce the liquid during baking.  I have also grilled strips of zucchini on my Foreman grill the same way.

Excellent.  I used ground turkey and 1% cottage cheese, skim mozzarella to cut down on the calories.  Best lasagna I've ever had.

Absolutely wonderful!  the only thing I changed was I substituted ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese since I prefer the texture.  This is definitely a keeper!

My husband and I really liked this, but our 12 year old daughter just thought it was okay.  "4" would be our average rating. We liked the extra flavor of the zucchini and my husband and I didn't really miss the noodles. We did "sweat" the zucchini and we still had to pour off some liquid, but it was no big deal. I added a little bit of extra cheese, but I did use low-fat cottage cheese, extra-lean grass-fed ground beef, and egg substitute.  We'll be making this again.  Thanks Patricia Mary.

Hi! This is a good way to fix lasagna.  I followed suggestions of other cooks mostly because I wanted to use what I had on hand, and need to cut back on fats.  My alterations were 1) cut recipe in half to fit in 8x8 pan. 2) used one fresh turkey breast that I ground in Kitchen Aid meat grinder. 3) sprinkled zuchhini slices with kosher salt, both sides, sandwhiched between two clean white towels and weighted down with cutting board and cast iron dutch oven while preparing other ingredients.  Rinsed and dried well before using. 4) used low fat cheeses, and chose ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  These changes worked very well, but even they needed some tweeking.  Am making again this week but this time will add lots more italian spices, fresh would be much nicer!!   Using 3 zucchs was perfect for the 8x8 pan, the slices overlapped a little, and made for a nice base.  I wonder if roasting in a low temp oven would be better option (placed on towels to absorb the liquid).  I might try that too.  Oh, and definitely add just a little sprinkle of red pepper flakes, just a few.  :)  Hope ya make this...  enjoy!!

Loved this new way to use up my bounty of zucchini and yellow squash from the garden.  Even husband who "hates" lasagna loved this recipe.  After reading other's comments about the problem of it being too watery and the squash still undercooked, I sweated the squash with salt and pepper for 30 minutes, then put it in the microwave for a few minutes to partially cook it before assembling the casserole.  I also used some spaghetti sauce instead of plain tomato sauce and simmered it a while to thicken it.  After baking for the 45 minutes it still looked a little "raw" so I upped the temperature to about 400 for the last 10 minutes to brown the cheese on the top.  Let it sit for at least 15 minutes before cutting and serving so any liquid is reabsorbed by the squash.  It is a great low carb, low calorie complete dinner in one dish.

This was delicious!  A little time consuming because of all the chopping etc, but it is worth it.  I have to agree, I didn't miss the pasta, but not because it tasted like there was pasta in it---it didn't---but because all the other flavors of lasagna are in it.  This is very healthy, too.  I put this in a 8x12 pan and it fit perfectly.  I made it exactly as written.  Make sure and cut the zucchini no wider than 1/4" because some of mine were a little wider than that and they were on the verge of being not done.  Try it, you'll like it!

This was delicious.  I followed other reviewers' advice & cut up the zucchini, salted it heavily and let it set in a colander for half an hour.  Then I rinsed it and cooked it in a skillet (no seasonings or pam - just the zucchini) before layering it in the casserole dish.
While the zucchini was soaking in salt, and the turkey was cooking, I cooked the veggies (onion, carrot, red pepper) in a separate pan for maybe 5-7 minutes (same seasonings & a touch of butter).  Then I poured those into the turkey, and rinsed and cooked the zucchini in that same skillet.
Note: I used red bell pepper (personal preference) instead of green. 
 The very only other change I made was that I added several ounces of "Garden Vegetable" cream cheese into the cottage cheese mixture (1/2 a small tab).  
My husband raved, and I LOVED it!!!!!  Thank you so much for sharing!  I'll make this over & over!

Thought this was delicious.  Very light and healthy tasting.  It was a bit watery, so do sweat your zucchini before you assemble.  I always add more garlic and add brown sugar to EVERYTHING, so for simplicity sake, add those to your meat sauce.

This is one of my favorite recipes. It wasn't hard to make. We added more cheese. It is a great way to use all of that zucchini. Everyone needs to try this recipe.

this recipe was great! i used skim ricotta in place of cottage cheese and mixed in some garlic & instead of two layers of zucchini, i compromised with my husband and added a middle layer of whole wheat lasagna noodles which soaked up the excess liquid. a little extra garlic flavor and this one is a keeper!

This was great....just made my regular meat sauce using no salt added tomato sauce and diced tomatoes, Italian seasoning mix, onion powder and dried oregano to lean ground beef.  I put this in the slow cooker for 3 hours on high.  
I used 1 large zucchini, no salt added cottage cheese, and assembled and baked as directed.  It  was not watery at all.
It is a good recipe for those of us who can't eat wheat.

This was delicious! I made very few changes. I used sweet Italian sausage instead of ground beef and Italian seasoning instead of oregano. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because despite draining the zucchini of excess liquid for over an hour and patting with paper towels, I still had an extreme amount of liquid at the end. I used a turkey  baster to pull out the liquid and then gave it more time in the oven and gave it additional rest time.

I liked it a lot.  Instead of cottage cheese, I made a roux (of 1.5 tbsp butter, 1.5 tbsp flour, 1 cup milk).  I also served it with penne in red sauce on the side, because I like my carbs.

I "sweatted" the zucchini as many poeple have suggested here, and I would HIGHLY recommend doing that to cut down on the water.  The dish was still super watery for me, but it tasted great. My husband was very skeptical of this dish at first but ended up eating more than I did because he liked it so much.  I gave this recipe four stars because, while it was delicious, this recipe takes a LONG time to properly prepare and cook, and doesn't yield more than four plates.

I really love this recipe with a few changes. To simplify things, I use a jar of pre-made spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce and spices, and ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese with egg. Also, I use one or two very large zucchini/squash and slice them with my cheese slicer to get them nice and thin and even. That seems to help it not be as watery. When I don't have Parmesan, I sprinkle some garlic salt on the top layer of mozzarella to give it a little extra kick.

Since it was dietetic, I of course added ricotta cheese - about a pound - so it would be incredibly fattening and it was really good.

This was very good. Even my husband, who says he hates squash, liked it. As others suggested,  I salted, rinsed, then patted dry the zucchini.   It wasn't too watery as a result. I also used prepared pasta sauce and simmered until very thick.   I would have given 5 stars, but it was very time consuming when I added the extra steps of prepping the zucchini.  If I make this again, I would prep the zucchini in advance and allow to drain before beginning the sauce.

great recipe!  Of course it's different from lasagna, but a wonder ful dish on its own.  Definitely "sweat" the zucchini (salt it and let it drain, then pat with paper towels). Only change I made was to use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, and fresh basil and oregano ( which I grow in my garden).

Try this dish - you won't be disappointed! We tried this as an alternative to traditional lasagna and I honestly didn't think that it would be as good as that favorite dish at our house. However, I was very pleasantly surprised as was everyone else that night. Since then we've made it a couple of more times and each time are very impressed with how well it turns out. This is a great way to use up some of that prolific summer staple.

Substituted ground turkey, omitted green pepper, added extra cheese. I thought this was excellent. The mixtures were thin when spread into a 9x13 dish, but it worked out. I will definitely be making this again.

i did enjoy this recipe, but it does have its flaws. yes, it does turn out watery b/c of the veggies. i did try what one of the reviews had said about salting the zucchini to draw out the water. it worked, some, but ended up being a little too salty for me, even after rinsing and patting them dry. i really like the whole veggie idea rather than the pasta though. will probably try w/ eggplant next time.

well, my VERY skeptical bf had 3 helpings and called it "comfort food".  So I'd say it rated a 5 star  LOL  He was NOT looking forward to dinner when I told him what I was making....he changed his tune pretty quick tho.  

I did make a few changes tho.  I used chicken breast, cut it into bite size pieces and browned. No green pepper as I didnt have any, but used mushrooms instead. Used ricotta instead of cottage (I didnt have the latter).  And I took the advice of other posters and sweated the zucchini first. Next time tho, I will rinse better, as I found it very salty.  I hope this freezes well, as I made a huge pan!

Love this recipe! My husband and I are eating organic and I just bought all the same ingredients except organic. It is a little watery but we love it and I make it at least once a week. I like it because it's not nearly as heavy as regular lasagna and is very healthy. I can pack in so many vegetables in this one recipe. I ate this at school one day and several of my co-workers wanted the recipe. They made it and loved it too! I love spreading the wealth. ENJOY!

This is delicious! It was my first time preparing zuchini at home. I added salt to the zuchini and was amazed how much water comes out of it. Dried them with a paper towel as well and still had some liquid in the baking dish after I baked it. This dish was full of flavor and my son and husband really liked it as well. It’s a keeper!

I thought this was great! I did not miss the noodles at all yet it was still delicious and filling. I roasted the zucchini strips first to try to address the issue of a watery casserole. It did help and it allows the dish to be ready in less time. I omitted the green peppers( dont care  much for them cooked) but I added a bunch of chopped mushrooms. I also used prepared sauce. I used Raos garden vegetable flavor and it was a perfect time saving step. I used fat free cottage cheese  which I seasoned well to my liking.  Definitely will add this to the rotation

Family-approved!  The 2 guys at the table said it was good even without the pasta.  Husband & I are watching carbs, so I thought I'd give it a try and it had wonderful flavors.  I did add salt to the meat and cheese mixtures to bump up the flavors.  Based on other reviews, I salted the zucchini and drained it before baking and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.   The salt & drain treatment plus letting the casserole sit for 15 minutes after baking made a lasagne that wasn't "soupy" and I was able to use a spatula to cut squares.  The squares stayed firm for leftovers the following day.

Loved this!  Prep definitely took longer than 15 mins but I didn’t rush it.  I also “salted” the zucchini.  Worked very well.  I also used a jar of prepared pasta sauce instead of tomato sauce.  Then followed the recipe.  Beyond delicious!  Looking forward to the left overs tonight.

Absolutely delicious!  I was so worried this would come out watery and fall apart on the plate. I was pleasantly surprised. Each piece was firm  while the zucchini was tender and yummy. The sauce was super good and best of all, so easy to make!  This is my favorite new recipe.

It came out watery. Next time I'll use ricotta instead of cottage cheese. More salt.

I love this recipe! This is about the only way I can get my family to eat zucchini, lol...You can use your leftover spaghetti to make a layered lasagna.

We loved it! I let the zucchini weep out some water as described in other reviews, but it was still somewhat 'juicy'. That's the only reason for the 4 stars. The flavor was very nice and we didn't miss the noodles. I called it a vegetable Italian casserole so no one was expecting lasagne noodles. I only had sliced mozzarella, so I used that instead of grated and it was still cheesy and yummy! The family graded it as good enough to make again and have as leftovers!

The only problem I have is trying to figure out why it had so much liquid in it after it baked!

This was better than traditional lazagna! my whole family raved about it!  My vegetarian even loved it.  I prepered it in a way that she was able to find a section with no burger.  Next time I would probably prepare the zucchini ahead of time to allow it to dry out a bit because the final product was quite watery.  Any other suggestions on how to avoid that?

Very good taste. My kids loved it. Next time I would double the cottage cheese for two layers, and put the mozzarella just on top.

I may or may not make it again.  I found it somewhat bland and with not nearly enough meat or sauce.  If I did make it again I would pare the zucchini before slicing and at least double the ground beef. I would also add oregano and rosemary, plus more garlic.

THis was very tasty.  Both my hungry guys liked it.  I got a little creative and used no bake lasagna noodles as the one layer on the bottom, but it wasn't needed.

Somehow I ended up with too much liquid and was a little skimmpy on meat mixture;  I would likely use a little more meat and sauce-  I did break it into two containers so that could also be the issue

This recipe was DELICIOUS! Xxxooo. After eating it I feel satisfied and like I just ate something healthy as well. I happened upon this recipe by doing a google search for "summer lasagna." Boy, did I luck out! I followed the recipe but with  few adjustments (some intended, some not lol). In an effort to end up with a dish with less moisture I salted the zucchini strips and left them in a colander for 30 mins. As far as the veggies I diced the green pepper and onion but grated the carrots. I TOTALLY FORGOT the tomato sauce lol! However the dish was delicious even without the sauce (it took me a few minutes to realize that I had forgotten the sauce). I noticed moisture upon removing the dish from the oven but after I let it sit for 10 mins. the moisture had been absorbed. Also it probably did not have much based on the tomato sauce omission. I ended up having two helpings and on the second I added some sriracha sauce and it gave it a little bit of the tomato flavor as well as a zing. Great recipe. Thank you for sharing Patricia Mary.

My favorite lasagna recipe! The only change I made was using the Prego Garden Harvest store-bought tomato sauce instead- which gave it an extra kick of flavor. Thanks for sharing!

The only addition I made was to add some fresh garlic to the meat, otherwise I will probably never make lasagna with noodles ever again. This dish satisfied my  palette and my waistline. I put paper towel into the Pyrex dish to soak up the moisture, but that all. I Cannot wait to share it with friends.....

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe!  I typically like to try recipes without any modifications the first time, but we don't use ground beef, so my first change was to substitute ground turkey breast.  I also heeded other reviewers to sweat the zucchini planks first.  I seemed to have a lot of planks, so I used a 13" x 9" baking dish, with a few planks leftover.  Perhaps my idea of a medium zucchini is someone else's idea of large!  Anyway, I used about 1 hefty tablespoon of Italian Seasoning in the sauce instead of just oregano and basil, and when plating, I put  torn fresh basil on top of each serving.  It was very good - and healthy - and I'll definitely make it again.  Thank you for inspiring such a great meal!

This was SO yummy!!! I'm really enjoying the low carb recipes I've been making, and this one did not disappoint. However, I did add some of my own variations (kinda combined this recipe with another one that sounded good). I cooked the ground beef with a kale mix and onions, left out the carrots and bell peppers. I used half cottage cheese and half ricotta (just cause ricotta rocks!), and as the other recipe recommended I cooked the zucchini in the oven for 15 minutes for the purpose of browning a bit and to reduce the moisture, which can help the lasagna not be watery. It turned out so good... I could eat it everyday forever! I'm going to make it again and try half zucchini and half eggplant. Love eggplant, so yeah, it will be awesome!! :)

UPDATE: I realized I didn't specify that you will want to slice the zucchini lengthwise before cooking in the oven. And also dry/dab them with a paper towel to get the moisture off after cooking. But I still feel my lasagna was pretty watery, and wanted to give one more tip which I will try on my next time doing it: you can use only the outer (skin) slices of the zucchini and discard the seedy middle. I am confident this is the only sure way of having the dish not become watery/runny.

I made this Summer Lasagna last night and IT WAS GOOD!!!! My husband said this was a definite "KEEPER"! 
I did change a few things since we are only eating meat 2-3 times a week. Since this was a No-Meat day, I omitted the ground beef. I did use a brand name "Garden Veggie" jar of sauce. I also swapped out the cottage cheese for ricotta cheese. I used everything else in the recipe. Soaking the zucchini strips was a good tip. Mine came out flavorful, zucchini strips were the right level of crunchy (I liked that the best) and we didn't miss the pasta noodles. In fact, I will make it like this going forward! Great No-Meat dish! Thanks for this recipe and the other submitted tips.

I read through the other reviews before tackling this recipe and noticed several people mention the zucchini needs to be dried. Though the other tips sounded practical, I went to my same method I once used to dry out a submerged iPhone. I took a large mixing bowl and put a layer of rice on the bottom, and layered the zucchini strips and made sure that all strips were covered in rice. (This is practical if you have an excess of rice like I do) it did its job by drawing out the water from the zucchini which gave me an end result of a perfect lasagna. I used both red and green peppers diced and added onion. I also went to minced garlic and layered pepperoni between the meat and next layer of zucchini. Overall this came out amazing and I will definitely use this recipe in the future. It is a lovely alternative to traditional lasagna.

I try to follow recipe exactly for an accurate review but because of my tastes, i made a few changes.  i do not eat red meat so none added. used jarred spaghetti sauce simply because i didn't want to waste it.  i also added home grown toms on top because i had an abundance like the zucchini.  i did not have any issue with it being too watery even without the salting used by others.  thought it was delish.  onions  certainly add flavor.  a keeper.

I agree that one needs to prep the zucchini to cut down on the liquid. I also needed to still get rid of extra liquid, after cooking, but that isn't a problem. I, too, had to laugh with the people who commented that they didn't miss the noodles. I thought the am't. of mozzarella wasn't enough, so I doubled that. Very tasty and will make again.

I should have read the reviews and followed my intuition to salt the zucchini! It was watery, but it did not lack in flavor. I used a mandoline and set it at 1/4 inch and the zucchini was crisp tender which I am on the fence about as soggy, soft zucchini is not good. Maybe add 5 minutes to the cook time. I used a 8x11 pan and only needed 3 of the zucchini. I did use more mozzerella, part skim. I will make this again!

Made this for my family and everyone really liked it.  I did not put carrots, and put a can of chopped fire roasted tomatoes and a small can of tomato paste, instead of the sauce.  It had great flavor and wasn't too watery, as others have mentioned...maybe the tomato paste helped.  Sautéing the onion, garlic, and peppers a few minutes before adding the meat helped soften them a little (helps keep picky eaters happy). ;)  Definitely will make this again...its s keeper!

This is very good.  Only thing I did differently was use Asian summer squash instead of zuchinni.  The Asian squash has a better taste and is a firmer texture.  Definitely a keeper.

I substituted a jar of spaghetti sauce for the tomatoes and paste so it was nice and thick. Used turkey in place of beef and fontina cheese replaced mozzarella. This a refreshing change and even my antivegie hubby came back for seconds!

We enjoyed it , but might  skip the green pepper next time and use fresh  spinach or even mushrooms in the mix.  As the  green pepper over powered the mix I think.

Made this with my sister and brother-in-law.  We did not add carrots and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  
Also added some fresh spinach and sliced mushrooms (per another recipe) We all liked it and did not really relate to the fact that there was no pasta in it, but we do all like zucchini so no worries there.  We did not salt and drain the zucchini so maybe it was a bit watery but leftovers the next day had firmed up nicely.
Will make again.

The taste was really good. I omitted the oregano and sautéed the onion, pepper, carrots and garlic first. The zucchini released a lot of water during baking. I used a slotted spoon to move to another pan when done and added more sauce when served. Next time I will grill the zucchini first then put together the recipe. It's really delicious. Especially the next day.

Quite good. Changed up a few things: salted the zucchini as suggested by others; added black olives to the meat mixture (ground turkey), added fresh mushrooms to the cheese mixture, didn't bother with second cheese layer. A bit runny, yes, but good nonetheless.

I've made zucchini lasagna over and over  again with great results.  I have no idea why the recipe did not tell you to lightly salt and drain the  zucchini.  I do this in colander and then lay on  2 in.  sided large sheet  pan and press dry on paper towels.  Then continue on with this recipe or mine is different.   3 stars is for not telling to get water out of zucchini. . Will be runny and loose over and over if that's not done.  Bad instructions! !!

After baking, there was quite a lot of liquid from the zucchini. Not sure why. Yes, will make it again.

This was so good.  Great tasting and easy to make.  My husband doesn't like zucchini and was skeptical when I told him what I was making.  He ended up having 2 servings he liked it so much.

This turned out amazing!  I couldn't believe it but we didn't miss the noodles at all. I sweated the zucchini, as others suggested, while cutting the rest of the veggies. Afterwards, I wiped off the water with a paper towel before layering into the baking dish. I also added thinly sliced yellow squash to the layering, and used a 13x9 dish, anticipating the extra liquid to avoid messing up my new oven.  I baked his uncovered, to avoid additional moisture from the cooking. After it was done, I let it set for about 5 minutes before carefully tilting the dish and draining out about a1/4 c liquid. It sat another 5-7 minutes as I baked garlic toast before slicing pieces with a knife and serving. Delicious!  Next time I will add more veggies.

I did it today, but as I was in a rush I microwaved it for about 15 minutes. I also skipped the mozzarella cheese to cut down a little the calories. It still was delicious! It's a great recipe. Just one thing I need to correct next time, to add the ingredients rather dry to the baking dish cause when cooking in microwave it does keep more moisture than in the oven, so it was a little watery this time, but that was my fault. Overall I loved the recipe.

It was kind of runny, so next time I'll salt the zucchini and let it sit in a colander for 30 minutes. I also used too much sauce..... hmmm I wonder if that's why it was too runny.

Delicious! I used fresh basil instead of dry, and I added a bay leaf while simmering the sauce. True it comes out a bit watery, but the flavor is amazing! I used the side blade of my cheese grater to slice the zucchini thinly and evenly. It cooked through just fine. I truly think this dish would taste better the next day but we didn't have any leftovers. Since it's so light, my husband, boys and I all had two servings. If any family member wants or misses the pasta, you could always cook some and put the watery part of the lasagna over it as a sauce.

After reading reviews like many suggested ,I sprinkled zucchini with salt and let it stand about 40 min.I guess I didn't rinse the zucchini strips well,because lasagna turned out a bit salty for me.I rarely use salt on my plates .But my man thought it came out great.I didn't change anything. I will definitely make it again,but with less than 5 zucchini. Somehow I had some extra strips.And I will pill it before cutting .Just my preference. Other than that it's a great summer dish and very easy to make.Thank you for sharing!

A little bit difficult to spread the different layers evenly, but delicious nonetheless.  We substituted the cottage cheese with some greek yogurt we had on hand and it came out wonderfully!

I liked it but I don't think I'll try this recipe again.  I read other reviews and also salted the zucchini but it still came out a little runny. 
The sauce was good wouldn't change a thing to it -"and the dish was okay as left overs.

So good! I used summer squash in addition to the zucchini. I salted the slices and let them sit for a while beforehand, like others suggested. I also use ricotta cheese instead of cottage.

Everyone in my house loved this recipe including my picky 11 year old.  I did salt my zucchini and let it rest.  I also pulled it from the oven at 25 min and poured off some of the extra juices.

Delish!  It was a little watery, but better once it sat.  I used turkey and added a can of chopped tomatoes.  It was really fabulous.  Great low carb dish and my husband served his over elbow noodles.

Totally loved this dish! I followed the advice of others about this dish coming out too watery, so I salted zucchini for about half an hour then rinsed and it worked like a charm. I also opted to use red bell pepper instead of green just because I prefer it. Other than that I followed recipe to the letter and it was fantastic. Truth be told I don't believe it's supposed to replace pasta as much as stand on its own two feet. It was delicious without the comparison. Enjoy it, I did.

We loved this recipe!  I used ground turkey and omitted the carrots. Used 1/2 c tomato paste and a can of petite diced tomatoes  instead of tomato sauce. Went heavy on the spices.  It was a little watery,  but I hadn't drained the tomatoes and the zucchini was very fresh. I will make it for the freezer as the zucchini  keeps coming!

Im giving this recipe 4 stars not because of the flavor and taste (which are amazing) but because it’s very difficult to serve; the lasagna falls apart. I would add a layer of cheese (mozzarella or an italian mix) to the zucchini before adding the sauce and cottage cheese so the zucchini holds together. Everything else is amazing you never miss the pasta or the ricotta cheese.

Using zucchini is a great way to increase nutritional value and decrease calories! Followed recipe, but used ground turkey, orange pepper, and added mushrooms since I had those at home. Also used spaghetti sauce like another cook did, and the results were wonderful. Thanks for sharing!

We made this last night and it was delicious! It's completely gone and only my husband and I ate it :P not sure how much beef was in it...pretty sure it was more than 1pound, and did a whole pepper instead of half. It wasn't runny at all, but that's probably because the meat soaked up most of the sauce. We will make it again the same way :)

It tastes pretty good, but was watery, despite all precautions taken to prevent it being watery.  Overall, it's not worth the effort.

Mix if turkey and extra lean ground beef. Low to non fat cheeses.  Was good.

This was delicious! Wow, I will be making this again! I have been planning on making this for a while with my zucchinis, but I have had so much yellow squash, I used that. I also have been overrun with tomatoes. I have canned sauce, but made my own sauce and diced some toms too.  The sauce given in this recipe is very flavorful-we loved it!! My husband doesn't like marinara sauces and he loved this dish!! I also used fresh basil and oregano. A real garden meal! Thank you for helping me use all my veggies! I also added some toast with butter, garlic powder and Italian seasonings to mop up the delicious juices.  I will be making again and again.

The flavor was good, baked it twice as long as called for but it came out like lasagna soup! Very disappointed, wasted my morning.

My picky husband didn't complain to much with this recipe and the kids loved it!!!!  I forgot the cheese in between so added it on top for the last 10 minutes.  It still came out great!  I did salt, set, and pat my zucchini before using them.  Next time I will add red pepper, but all in all a great recipe.

We made this tonight with a few adjustments for what we had on hand.  We used ground turkey instead of beef (I don't eat beef), and a butternut squash pasta sauce instead of the tomato sauce.  We had yellow summer squash from our local farm instead of zucchini, so we used that.  We followed other reviewers and salted the squash first, and we used extra cheese.  My boyfriend and I both agreed that this was absolutely delicious, and one of the best meals that we have eaten!  We'll definitely make this again.

Great way to use up the zucchini I had growing in my garden! I was worried the lasagna was going to be a bit bland, but it was very flavourful! The only thing I didn't like was that the dish turned out quite watery -- I would suggest cooking the tomato sauce down until it is quite thick, and maybe using dry curd cottage cheese. Definitely would make it again.

Must work the liquid status in comparison to the age of the zucchini, used vodka marinara and it tasted great.  Turned into a soup, but still worthy of a second chance with younger zucchini.

Good. Although, I think it would taste better with more garlic or just use Garden Vegetable Ragu.

I was looking for recipes to make with my abundance of zucchini and found this.  It was excellent.  Both my daughters loved it!  I made two batches at the same time and froze one.  I hope it freezes well.

Delicious!  I used a little more cheese, ok a lot (I love it cheesy!) and I didn't have any cottage cheese or ricotta...so I used sour cream.  And it turned out great!  Will definately make again!

This was excellent.  I omitted the meat in the tomato sauce but otherwise followed exact.  Like other reviewers I did not miss the noodles at all.  Several friends helped me eat this and all raved about it.  I will definetly make this again.

This was excellent!  I wasn't sure at first if it would be that great, but it exceeded all of my expectations.  The only change I made was adding a little more cottage cheese than recommended.

Great recipe, was loved in my household though it was quite watery after cooking which I'm putting down to the zucchini & eggplant. 

I also changed it a bit, I added eggplant, omitted the peppers and instead of tomato sauce I used a can of italian chopped tomatoes and some beef stock with celery for a little more flavour for the base.

Will definately use again!!

I thought this was a wonderful recipe. I substituted ground beef for tofu and it came out delicious. I didn't have cottage cheese on hand and it still was tasty. Just crumbled the tofu and mixed the egg in with it. I also used fresh basil on each layer (on top of the mozarella)instead of adding it to the veggies. It was fabulous and I'll be making it again and again.

I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce also, which gave it a very eggplant parmesan feel. Except the zucchini was had a much more appealing texture! I also added some extra veggies like mushrooms and baby spinach just to make it a little more interesting.

I made this for my family without telling them about the zucchini, because they never even would have tried it.  Instead of tomato sauce I did use spaghetti sauce, other than that made exactly as stated.  I thought it was good, but I really did miss the noodles, was soupy without the noodles to absorb the sauce, but really a great way to use up the extra zucchini from the garden.  I would consider making again.

The zucchini was still undercooked after over 45 minutes in the oven, and I sliced it very thin as others suggested.  The flavors were ok, and I might try this again, but I may grate the zucchini instead of slicing it.

Excellent flavor. Both my husband and very picky teenager loved the aroma and couldn't wait to taste it. The only adjustment I would make is to slice the zucchini thinner, other than that it was a great summer meal.

This was so delicious, and you really can't tell that the "noodles" are really zucchini. My husband loved it and was surprised when I told him about the zucchini.
