This is a nice basic rub that I think could be used on most any type of meat.  Since I was trying this for the first time, I just made a small amount using 1/4 t. of cayenne and 1/2 t. of each of the other ingredients, which amounted to cutting the paprika and sugar in half.  I used the entire batch of rub on a one pound pork tenderloin.  Rather than bake this, Hubs grilled it.  It was great!  I’ll make a larger batch and keep it on hand in the pantry.  UPDATE 4/17/16:  I made this again as before, but this time it seemed pretty spicy to Hubs and me.  Next time I will cut the cayenne down to 1/8 t. for this small batch.

I made this and my family loved it. It has a little kick, which was fine for my husband and me. Even my 13 yr old said she'd eat it again.  I used boneless pork chops and just kept an eye on them as it (or my oven/or both) altered the baking time slightly. Also, I had quite a bit of the rub left over.

I cut this down to two pork chops and then used only 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne (preference for my husband).  I'm not used to baking pork chops (I usually grill them), and I did let them get a touch overdone.  Be sure to use a reliable thermometer to make sure you get them to no more than 145 degrees!  You will have leftover rub to store for another time, and I'm thinking that the rub will be good on almost any sort of meat (chicken or beef come to mind).  I will grill these next time and use the rub on both sides.  I would definitely use this rub again!  Yum!  Thanks, Ron Perry!

Really good.  Be sure to use thick chops, about 1.25”.  Necessary for such high heat.  Foil on pan helped with clean up and a light coat of olive oil kept things moist.  Leftovers, sautéed in low, tasted wonderful for lunch next day - spices toned down a bit.

This rub is fantastic, and I agree with BellePepper, it seems this would be good on any type of meat, I'm thinking salmon in particular.  I cut down on the cayenne because of the kids but other than that I left everything the same.  It was the right amount for 5 bone-in pork chops.  And the cooking time was spot on, the chops were tender.

Definitely a great all around rub. I substituted the cayenne for chipotle and rubbed a couple drops of liquid smoke into each chop.

I had only two pork chops already in freezer bags, so I made one-half of the rub and poured 1/2 of it into each bag, which allowed me to shake and then bake the chops. Not having cayenne, I substituted chili powder as a quick work around an it was acceptable. Very happy dinner tonight and I have the other for tomorrow.

I used 1" boneless pork chops and reduced cayenne to 1tsp. Then I added an extra pinch of sugar and a few shakes of Knorr's powderef chicken bouillon to cut the heat. The temp & time was petfect although I baked covered for a few extra minutes as the family prefers pork a little more medium to medium well. They were very tasty and still plenty picante.

This is a great rub!!  Followed directions exactly and had more than enough so I saved extra for next time.  I have picky boys and hubby and it was a hit with all.  Personally, we loved all the flavors. I can see where some may find the cayenne too much, but not us.  As with anything, just adjust to your liking. Also, the baking time for the chops was spot on - they came out super moist!   Going to try this rub on chicken next and then maybe a little,on some fish.

I made this and I love it! However; I did, cut back on the cayenne cause my family like to enjoy the foods I cook!  LOL still a bit spicy for some but overall very tasty!  If you do not like spicy I suggest you leave out the cayenne!  Taste just as good without it I am sure from reading other post!  Will definitely make this again so easy and no time at all to cook!  Mix spices ahead of time and use on different meats!

I really liked the spices. Cut them in half for hubby and me. 1/2”chops, cooking time right on   Turned after 10 minutes. Spicy for me so I stirred tsp sour cream   on top of my chop out of the oven to “cool it down”. Roasted asparagus and blistered tomatoes last ten minutes

This rub is very similar to one I bought at an Olive Oil field in the Central Coast of California. The ingredients are very similar. The best thing about this recipe is he gives you the perfect timing of the cooking process. Works every time. Can’t get better than this.

These chops were cooked to perfection. Very tender and juicy! But the spices were way too much! Next time I think I would leave out the cayenne pepper or maybe lessen the amount to very little. It was really spicy.

Tasted amazing! Awesome recipe! Just a couple notes:

-only use 1/4 tsp of Cayenne  if you don't want it to be too spicy

- make sure to bake in over with aluminum foil covering it for 20 min

- after removing from oven let it rest for 10 minutes covered for the best results

This is a great rub.  I did not use the salt as I am not allowed and cut the cayenne pepper to 1 and half tsp.  I BBQ the tenderloin instead of baking.  Tender and full of flavour will be making again.  Thank you Marianne for finding wonderful recipe and thank you Ron Perry for sharing.

I made this with only one teaspoon of  cayenne pepper and it was a great spice level for my family.  It was an instant favorite here and has been requested by the family again and again.

Loved it!  Cut the cayenne to just under a tsp.  Not very spicy.  Baked 25 minutes.  White and juicy throughout.  Will make again!

This recipe was good. I don't normally like pork but it was given in a food box from a friend's place. I didn't have the Cayenne pepper so I subbed for Chili powder. Can't help to think this would be better on Chicken though.

I made a small change because I was out of Cayenne. I reduced the Garlic Powder to 3/4 TBSP and used 1 TSP of Garlic Sriracha Seasoning instead and it was great. I have a very picky kid and he was asking me to save the last chop for his lunch tommorow.

This recipe is easy peasy.  I’m no cook, but I can make a rub.  Pork chops come out fabulous .

After reading other reviews, I cut back on the cayenne pepper. Next time I’ll follow the recipe. We like hot and spicy so this is a keeper. 
We used half inch bone in chops and 20 minutes was perfect.

Delicious!  If making for children that don't like hot,  leave out cayenne pepper.

The rub is delicious but a little goes a long, long way - don't dredge as I did. I suggest a light touch for the best results.

Made this tonight for dinner and it was absolutely delicious. Most recipes I still need to add ketchup or another sauce to them. Not this one! This was perfect without any additional condiments on it This was also super simple to make.

Loved this recipe. It was very moist and tasty. The only thing that I did different after taking them out of the oven and finding that my thicker pork chops weren’t completely cooked yet was browning each side a bit in a pan. Now I know for next time that if they are a bit on the thicker side to brown them in a pan first.

The Rub was the best part. I pan fried the my chops in an iron skillet for 5 min on each side instead. Made a great tasting crispy crust.

This was ok, I didn't even mind the slight heat but overall it wasn't my fav. There are a lot better more flavourful rub recipes on this site. Wouldn't necessarily recommend and personally wouldn't make again.

The chops came out great, very tender! I used a bbq rub instead of cayenne pepper (not a fan of hot spices). I also put foil , lightly sprayed with cooking spray on the baking sheet for easy cleanup.

Absolutely spectacular!  A bit on the spicy side, but we like it that way.  We used bone in thin cut pork chops and cooked them in olive oil on the stove.  Will try on chicken

The rub is delicious and will not disappoint. The chops were done in 16 mins and tasted amazing. I left everything the same except the cayenne because of the kids, but I’m sure I would’ve love the flavor either way. Very good. Will make again!

We don't like a lot of heat so I decided to omit the cayenne pepper. Then my paprika bottle was empty  so I substituted it with chili powder. I used less chili and a little more sugar  and cut the pepper down to a teaspoon. I was worried that it would affect the recipe because  chili powder has other ingredients including cumin, but it was so tasty that we put it in our keep file. I know I changed the recipe but I plan on making it again with the paprika and I'm sure its still going to be tasty.

Tasted great. I used 2 tsp of Chili Powder instead of Cayenne since I didn't have any Cayenne on hand. I used thin cut boneless pork chops. It was probably a little too much seasoning for the amount of meat for most people, but I like well seasoned.

So, I didn’t use the rub. I used Fox Brothers BBQ rub out of Atlanta, GA. This was the BEST cook time for 3/4-1” bone in chop. Turned out nice and tender! It wasn’t fall apart, it was the consistency of a grilled chop, which I love!! Will use this cook time and temp for years to come!!

Best Pork chops - I also added  sliced vidalia onion plus a little chicken broth in the baking dish. These pork chops were juicy and so tender. I will definitely make them again.

I made this exactly as written. It was super spicy! Both my husband & I love spicy food. I made another batch of the rub to have on hand.

My wife and I loved it.  Our 2-1/2 -year-old girls said, "Too Piyyysee. (too spicy)."  They generally are okay with spices but this was a bit much for them.  It had a great taste.  I made a very large batch of the "mesquite seasoning" and used it also for chicken that I seasoned, sealed and froze.  I'm sure it will be good on that too.

Super yummy pork rub! I would definitely recommend cutting down on the cayenne though. I used a touch under the amount recommended, and I love spicy food but this was borderline too much heat for me. Otherwise it was great and our pork came out juicy and tender in just 20 min. We'll be making this again!

This was good, however it is quite spicy and probably not recommended for a thin cut pork chop as it is a lot of seasoning.

I'm sorry, but this was WAY too seasoned for me. I was excited because it was such a simple recipe, but I freaked out (in a bad way) when I took the first bite. I had to take off as much of the seasoning as I could and put a bunch of stevia on it to even be able to eat it and the seasoning was still strong. It might be better if all the seasoning were cut to a quarter of what they are called for and mixed with plenty of breadcrumbs.

I do not eat meat, but I made this for my husband and he loved it! He does like spicy food, so I made the recipe exactly as directed. Even so, he asked me to back off on the cayenne pepper next time - he was sweating, lol. Great quick and easy  rub. PS - I did cover the chops while in the oven, and they were perfectly done in 20 minutes!

I used this rub on boneless pork chops to serve with homemade fresh pasta - it was a perfect combo! I'll definitely use this rub again on other meats or fish. Nice blend of flavors.

This was yummy! The pork chops came out perfectly! I cut the entire recipe by half because we were only making 3 chops. Instead of the cayenne, I used a few red pepper flakes, but only because I didn't actually have any cayenne. I also used Garlic Salt instead of regular salt. I baked it in my Copper Chef and it was delicious!

My fiancé and I like spicy food but we couldn't even eat these and that was after cutting the cayenne pepper in half. Cooked perfectly. Were very juicy but unfortunately, way, way too spicy.

I have made this a few times and it always turns out well. It's quick to make, and barely any clean up.
Most of the time I do not have garlic powder  onion powder or cayenne pepper. So I omit those and it still tastes delicious.

Made this exact to recipe, but it didn't say cook meat covered or uncovered in oven. I think next time I fix this to cover the meat, makes it more tender. But hubby says it was good.

I gave this five stars because it was tasty AND very easy to do. I liked the idea of roasting the chops in the oven instead of pan frying them.  I cut the salt and cayenne in half and reduced the garlic powder and it was perfect for us.  I have a convection oven so I should have reduced the cooking time but they were still good and most of them were juicy.

The flavor was really good but it was really spicy, even for someone like me who grew up eating spicy Mexican food!   Next time I will reduce by half or even more the amount of cayenne and increase the amount of sugar a bit. Otherwise these were very good.

Very good recipe but would cut the salt, to 1 teaspoon. Very easy recipe to throw together after work and after all the kids activities after school.  Can vary the cayenne to your taste buds.  I would make this again.

I hate to be the one to give it less than 5 stars, but, I made it as written (always do that the first time then tweak as needed).  My husband thought that it had too much garlic and I thought that it was too spicy.  I can take a little heat but I thought this was too much.  Sorry but I will not make this again.

This was good and easy.  We were out of onion powder so we left it out, but it was good.  We will use it again.  We did cut the recipe in half since we only had two large pork chops.
