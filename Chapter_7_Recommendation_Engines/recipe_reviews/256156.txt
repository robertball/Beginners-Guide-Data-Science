1.15.17  So many overnight oats recipes are loaded with calories and fat.  But not t his one, it breaks down very well nutritionally.  That peanut butter powder really tastes like the real deal, and it's the perfect partner for the fresh raspberries.  Have tried a number of similar recipes, but hands down. this has been my favorite.

I substituted what I had, blueberries instead of raspberries, real peanut butter instead of powder, and honey instead of sugar.  Still worked. Delicious!

This is one of my favorite things right now!  I don’t often have fresh berries on hand, so I sub the salad topping that has dried cranberries and pecan pieces.  The almond milk lasts forever in the fridge, so I can buy the ingredients and not have to worry about anything getting wasted because I waited too long to make it.  This is so easy to make - just add ingredients and then forget about it.  I just made 3 servings and am looking forward to breakfast tomorrow!

I love this recipe! I have had it several times now. The only thing I changed was that I added a little bit more oatmeal, because I like it thicker. But I am so grateful for this recipe- thank you!!

I made this the other night and ate it for breakfast the next day, and it was really good. I love PB2, so adding it plus raspberries and blueberries made for a wonderful flavor. I might add a bit less milk next time, but other than that, I would make it again.  You should try it.

I used blueberries instead of raspberries- it’s what I had and it was delicious. My husband enjoyed it as well.

I really enjoy this for breakfast. I did make a couple of changes, I used strawberries instead of raspberries, it's what I had in the fridge and I used 1 tablespoon of real maple syrup instead of sugar cause I don't do sugar. Delicious and easy.

This recipe isn’t a winner for me. I did finish eating it but I had to force myself to. Maybe I’m just not a chia seed person? I did substitute frozen blackberries for the fresh raspberries and I accidentally used Splenda in place of the sugar. I think the texture of chia seeds just puts me off. It was very easy to make and I loved the calorie count. Maybe if I happen to have fresh raspberries I would try it again, but I won’t rush out to buy some.
