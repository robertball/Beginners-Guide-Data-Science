This is a keeper! I used the suggestion about carmelizing the onions, using only 1 T. butter, but found it too sweet. Made it again leaving out only the sugar--much better, and definitely sweet enough. I also blended all of the pear (too much of a 'burst' of sweetness when biting into the little chunks of pear). A great recipe!

I cut the servings down to 4 &  roasted my squash (cut in half, scrape out seeds, place cut side down in inch of water, bake @350 for about 45 minutes... maybe an hour) & then scooped out the inside & added it to the milk & broth (cutting down the cooking time, naturally). I pureed all of the pears (didn't have quite as much as recipe called for because I used some in pear-tinis ;o)  ) I did make the carmelized onions (they had a lot to the soup!) but I only used a  couple tbp of butter, half an onion & sprinkled them w/ salt instead of sugar. The only sherry I had was a cream sherry but it worked. I started the meal off w/ Pear-tinis (even hubby liked those), served this soup w/ a salad (w/ pear/honey vinaigrette), garlic toast & finished it off w/ Pears w/ Raspberry Sauce. Thansk for a very enjoyable recipe namaste2uom!

This was pretty tasty, but next time I plan not to puree the shrimp. I prefer big chunks of shrimp. The carmelized onion was a great touch!

I thought it was bland. Maybe it was because I used frozen shrimp, but I won't make it again.

I was a little skeptical, but this dish was fantastic! Very elegant and gourmet. My husband and I ate it with a side of asparagus and a dry Riesling. This one's a keeper!

As someone suggested, I pureed all the pears.  The only other change I made was to use a dry red wine, since I did not have sherry.  Very tasty.

This was really good.  I have to say that this made more like 5 servings even though I used 1/2 pound of shrimp instead of 1/3 and a bit more squash.  Also, I didn't puree any of the shrimp because I liked being able to really taste them.  I think next time I will try quickly sauteeing the shrimp with some spices before adding them to the soup.  I have to say that although my husband was at first skeptical of the combo of pears and squash, we both loved it!

Interesting combination that I enjoyed. I added the caramelized onions and doubled the spices.  If you don't own a food processor or blender and you're wondering if this works when it's all chunky and coarse - it does, it's fine.  Better the next day!

This was excellent!  I had no shrimp but had some lobster claw meat (already cooked) - I added it after pureeing the soup.   The caramelized onions added the perfect touch.   My husband enjoyed it too.  It was very filling/one bowl was plenty (so I had leftovers for lunch!)

Without a doubt one of the top 5 soups I have tried.  It's a keeper.  I added the carmelized onions and left off the sherry.  It was quite a treat!  Nice addition to my collection of recipes.

WOW!  Really great!  This recipe was so unusual I just had to give it a try...it sounded like it would be either wonderful or terrible; turned out fantastic.  I took a chance making it (since it had only been reviewed once) because I wanted to add such a healty recipe to my reportoire.

I added the caramelized onion (sauteed in only about 3T butter) mentioned in the introduction to the recipe which was wonderful and added a lot of flavor to the soup.

Give this one a try!

We liked it, but would have liked it more had it not been quite so sweet. It’s odd that the caramelized onions recommended in the author were not included as optional ingredients. Even so, I added them as recommended and I’m glad I did... Love Onions! Next time I will just omit the sugar used to help caramelize them.

This is, BY FAR, THEEEE best soup I've ever made. Truly.  I've made this soup for 5+ years now, and have yet to find a rival, even at restaurants. I'm a star at potlucks and dinner parties!  Here's my perfected recipe: change the servings amount to 10 so you can more accurately use a whole, average sized butternut squash. I sautee half a medium red onion in 3-4 Tbsp salted butter in a skillet until the onion is opaque and sweet while the squash is boiling (don't add garlic. It complicates the flavor profile...trust me - I love garlic and I tried it once. Not in this soup.  And don't worry about the added fat content from the butter- the creaminess of the final product is worth the calories!)  Watch over the boiling butternut like a hawk - scorched milk is a huge bummer and hard to avoid if you've got the burner too high or don't stir it frequently. Avoiding the dreaded "breaking" of the bisque base is an art - but, in general, you want the squash to be soft but not bordering on mush. 
 
Add 2/3 of the finished caramelized onion in step 2. Add the remaining 1/3 of the onion with the shrimp and pear in step 3.  (I only puree 1/3 of the shrimp and pears in the food processor in step 2, leaving the remaining 2/3 for texture in the finished soup.)  If that's confusing to follow, you want 1/3 remaining onion, and 2/3 remaining shrimp and pear added AFTER the pureeing step.) 
Finally, don't judge your soup until you add the sherry at the very end. This ingredient is what makes this

I liked this. Very different. I would like it even without the shrimp.  I took advice & puréed the squash & pears. I also baked squash as I usually do when using butternut squash. Trying to peel it raw is to hard.

I used the suggestion of the carmelized onions and it gave the soup just the accent it needed. Flavors aren't strong, but it is rich and filling. I served a honey crusted cornbread with it which complimented the soup nicely.

This was great!  I usually make a simpler butternut squash soup, but this was a nice change.  My husband and in-laws loved it.  I did have to add more spices (to taste), but I just realized that I forgot to add the Tbsp sherry!  It was great anyway and I think I'll make this again.

Absolutely amazing.  I was a little skeptical of the strange sounding combination of ingredients, but decided I'd try it anyway because of the rating.  My husband was raving about it for days!  The only thing I changed was to use a little more shrimp than the recipe called for.  Next time I might add a small amount of drained diced tomatoes at the end for some extra texture, I think it would go nicely.

This soup was okay, but I don't think I'd make it again.  The blending of the pears and the squash gave it a somewhat gritty "baby food" texture that I didn't like. It tasted fine in and of itself, but I couldn't get over the texture.
