The only change I made is I used 1/3 cup no sugar added applesauce and cut the butter down to 1/3 cup. When prepared this way you get 25 grams of carbs but 1/2 the fat. I made this for a type 1 diabetic.

I followed the recipe to the letter and mine came out kind of dry. These were for an event and I had nothing else as a backup so I made homemade caramel sauce and put a little bourbon right onto each cake. Worked like a charm! I also served mine warm.

I added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. I'm sure they're great without it though!
