Super, SUPER yummy. I don't eat soy nuts so I substituted dry roasted peanuts and I used a whole cup. I also popped my own popcorn with the air popper (about four cups, maybe a little more?). I also used half parmesan cheese/half nutritional yeast and I added two teaspoons on onion powder. Dude, this was off the charts good. Last night, we ate every bit of this and I plan on making more today. This was SO, so good. NOTE: I did use a homemade italian seasoning and a quality balsamic, which really determines the outcome of your mix.

A sophisticated taste.  Not too salty.  It seemed to get better after having sat for over 24 hours.

Great, healthy way to make a tasty Chex Mix! I didn't have soy nuts so made without, and ended up adding a few more tbsp of balsamic & oil and another 2 tsps of Italian seasoning and garlic powder. And added a little salt as well. Delish!

Well, it is very miid in flavor.  Good crunch.  How ever the soy nuts fall straight to the bottom , I guess because of their size.  I'm not sure if I will try it again.

I loved Sarah Jo's suggestion of adding nutritional yeast instead of the Parmesan cheese!  The vinegar really makes this mix taste great!  I'll be making this again soon!
