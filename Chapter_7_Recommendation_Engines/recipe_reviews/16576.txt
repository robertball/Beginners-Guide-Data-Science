I love this recipe! It's super easy and quick!  I do make some changes, instead of cooking the crescents and sauce together, I cook the crescents chicken and cheese alone (bake until golden brown), then make the sauce to pour overtop or put on the side of the roll.  That way you can have it as soggy or as flacky as you would like.

I've been making this dish for years!  It is my husbands favorite!  The only change I make, is I use boneless, skinless chicken breast...boil them in water until no longer pink then shred.  I enjoy the taste with white chicken much better.  You can also just get a can of chicken breast for an even quicker dinner.

I cooked the chicken crescents without the soup mixture and heated the soup mixture on the stove and poured that over the rolls right before we ate them.  Wonderful!

Turned out better than expected! I used only 1 can cream of chicken and 1 1/2 cups of milk. I also added broccoli and used 8 grands crescents instead of regular and used the rest as rolls on the side. It turned out great!

It's a great base recipe but I've made several adjustments. First, I just covered some chicken breasts in some chicken broth until cooked, then shred. Next, chop an onion, some celery, and a few carrots and add to the chicken along with 2 cans cream of chicken, 1 can of milk, cheese, and salt/pepper/little garlic powder to taste. Cover and cook a few more min until tender. Add mixture to baking dish, strategically later two can worth crescent dough on top and sprinkle little bit of cheese on top. Bake until brown n bubbly. Yes, more work but I like it better this way.

I just don't get the 5 star ratings. I made this exactly as described and I did not care for the recpe. The bread was nice and brown, not too soggy, lots of sauce, chunks of chicken etc. and with all of this it still managed to be very bland. My husband immediately got up to get seasoning to add. My kids wouldn't touch it, not even my 18 month old who loves everything (I mean, she ate an entire bunch of chopped chives last week, for pete's sake). I would have thrown out the leftovers (and there were plenty) but my husband said he'd take them for lunch. It wasn't awful, just bland, and for the amount of fat and calories here, I wasn't going to eat bland AND fatty food. Needless to say, I won't try again.

Thanks to previous reviews we really enjoyed this dish! I took the advice given by several reviewers when I made this and it turned out great. I added some green onions to the chicken and cheese in the crescents and baked the crescents for 10 minutes. I used one can of soup and one cup of milk, poured it over the baked crescents and then baked them for another ten minutes. As previously mentioned, this really is like a chicken pot pie and would be great for a cold winter night. Thanks again for all the advice!

We did not like this.  I ended up throwing it away and fixing the kids some sandwiches.  I chose this recipe because it sounded really quick and we had to leave with little notice.  The cooking time was way off-the rolls were still doughy.  I honestly think they will always be soggy with all that soup on them. I have only made a meal 2 or 3 times in my life that we absolutely couldn't eat and this one falls into that elite catagory.

As written, I would give this a 3. First time I made it, it was a disaster. The crescent rolls weren't done and the sauce was starting to burn the sides of the dish. With modifications, I give it a 5, hands down. Here's what I do for 2 people: dice up 3-4 potatoes and make mashed potatoes slice a boneless, skinless chicken breast and cook (about 1" square pieces) until done add chicken and cheese to each crescent roll (usually 3 pieces of chicken per roll and cover with shredded colby/monterey jack cheese) Bake rolls at 350 for 11-13 mins Add 1-1/4 cup milk, 1/2 cup cheese (same kind as above), 1 can of cream of chicken soup and any remaining chicken (to be used as sauce) and heat until warm (add cheese after soup/milk mix is warm and whisk until melted) Keep whisking as the cheese will stick to the bottom of the pan Serve!  I place crescent rolls and cover with mashed potatoes (or place potatoes in middle and surround with rolls) and cover with the soupy mixture. I make this about once a week as it is my hubby's favorite recipe. When I tell him that's what we're having for dinner, he ALWAYS leaves work early. :)  Thank you so much for the idea!

This was very good and my children loved it. I used the advice of a prior review and used just 1 can of soup and 1 1/2 cups of milk. It turned out great! I also added cooked peas to the finished dish!

Pam should be used because my rolls stuck to the bottom of the dish. I didn't see the point in drowning the rolls. This dish would have been better with the chicken/soup/cheese mix served over rice, with the crescent rolls prepared and served as usual. Will not fix again.

I loved this recipe but I wish there was a way to get the bottom of the crecent crispy like the top. I didn't try cooking them separate like previously suggested but in hindsight it would be better. I also saw a comment about it being bland (which chicken with cream of chicken soup seemed redundant) so I used cream of mushroom instead. It was fantastic! I bet you could sub in any cream of -- soup with a chicken friendly flavor and get great taste! my husband loved it!

I thought this was okay, but my husband really enjoyed it.  I doctored it up quite a bit, though, by adding broccoli, onion, garlic, and pepper mixed with the chicken.

I love this! I've always creamed 1/2 cup cream cheese in place of one can of soup then mix it with the soup, milk, and cheese. I also bake the crescents first, just until golden brown, then put it back in the oven so all the cheese melts. i never can make enough to go around. There is no such thing as leftovers with this meal.

Very easy to put together. It is time consuming but worth the time. My teenage picky eatting daughters really liked it. Which says a lot in my book! Thank you for sharing this recipe with all of us!

I made the following changes: Cut the amount in half (but kept the original amount of cheese). I used 2 boneless, skinless chicken breast, shredded. I cooked this with 1/2 the cheese and added 4 ounces of cream cheese. I wrapped this in the crescents and baked (no sauce). I mixed up the soup, milk, the rest of the cheese, and 4 more ounces of cream cheese, and cooked in a sauce pan until smooth. so good.

I just wanted to comment, this has ben a classic in my family since I was a little kid. im now an adult and still love this. you people who say it was bland need to be creative. its a vary good dish, but like any one person taste differs from family to family. such as changing seasoning and adding diffrent stuff. I still love the chicken but tend to add steak every once in a while...good dish.

These were wonderful!  I did cook the chicken in half of the soup mixture with some milk and I also added some lemon pepper seasoning to the chicken.  I rolled them with some cheddar cheese and put them in the pan with a small amount of soup mixture around them.  Cooked them for about 10-15 minutes and then covered them again with cheese and poured some of the soup mixture over them  We loved them!!  Boyfriend said they were worth 4 stars....will make again sometime! Thanks for the recipe!  Wonder what it would taste like if it were a pot pie filling with some veggies?  Might have to try that!  Thanks again for the recipe!

Thank goodness my husband is the sweetest, most gracious man alive! This was not good. The soup prevented the crescents from cooking on the bottom making a big, hot, raw soupy dough MESS. If I dare try this again [BIG IF] I will take the advice of another user and cook the crescents with the chicken before adding any sauce on top.

This turned out to be a soggy mess.  I should have listened to the other reviews and baked the crescent rolls first.

Huge hit!  Everyone loved it.  Following 1 of the suggestions I made 1 large sheet of dough with the 2 pkgs of crescents, put the chicken in the middle and rolled in up and put it in a 9x13 baking dish.  Cooked for 20 min without soup mixture and then added soup mixture and cooked until bubbly and crescent golden brown. I also added garlic powder and a sprinkle of season salt to soup mixture.  Everyone asked for 2nds!

This was absolutely fabulous! Here's what little alterations I made: 1st I threw chicken breasts in the slow cooker with some garlic salt,salt and pepper until it fell apart and shredded easily. Then I tossed in shredded Mozerella and chedder cheese. I used one of those new Pillsbury flat, no seam refrigerated doughs and layed the chicken mixture down the middle, pulled up the sides and ends to form a tight seal flipped it over in a 13x9. I poured the sauce down the sides(not over top)and baked until dough was slightly brown then I sprinkled shredded Colby/Jack cheese over the entire dish and baked until cheese was melted. I then sliced it into individual servings. It was so much tastier and easier this way then when I rolled them individually the first time. This will be a new family Favorite.

My son and I gave this a five, hubby says 3. I rolled them up and baked them the full time, then we used the sauce at the table on top. I had made this one time before, and the sauce added while cooking just sogs up the rolls ALOT. Made the sauce with 2 cans soup and 1 cup milk. WAY TOO MUCH SAUCE!! Should've just used 1 can. 
Yummy though and very filling!

Great recipe! Although, I changed it up some: cooked chicken tenders in cream of chicken soup mixed with heavy whipping cream on the stove. Rolled tenders in crescents. Added a SMALL amount of soup mixture to baking dish (just enought to give the cresents flavor, but not soggy) Placed crescents/chicken in dish and added cheese to top and baked until crescents were lightly brown. YUMMY!!! Boyfriend loved 'em.

I should've followed other reviewer's advice, and cut soup in half as well as reduce milk.  I did not do this however.  Realizing I was going to have a mushy mess if I poured more soup mixture over the top, I simply through into the remaining soup mixture the remaining chicken and cheddar cheese, and heated it through on the stove top.  We had a great sauce to pour over the crecents.  My picky 5 year old asked me to make this every night.  It's a good occasional dish, and I will be making this again, just not on a regular basis.  Even with only the bottom layer of soup mix, the rolls still are rather mushy.

One of the ladies at the domestic violence shelter where I work made this last night for supper and it got rave reviews, especially from the kids who came back for 2nds and 3rds!  Here's what they did differently. Three chicken breasts, cooked and shredded, mixed with a large can of veg-all, an 26 oz. can of cream of chicken soup and a little milk to make it pourable, all mixed together in a sauce pan until warm, pour into a 9 x 13 baking dish. Bake at 350 until bubbly around edges, about 20 minutes. Roll up crescent rolls and place on top of mixture and bake until rolls are browned and done.

As written, I give this a 2.  This turned out to be a sticky, gooey mess.  The dough was not baked after the first 15 minutes.  I baked it 8 minutes longer before it "looked" alright.  I then added the rest of sauce and cheese and baked for another 2-3 minutes.  The dough was uncooked on the inside even after the additional baking time.  The flavor was good, so I will try it again, however, I will follow other reviews and bake the cresents alone and add the sauce only when I can be sure they are done.

This was good.. I also baked the crescents alone for 15 minutes then poured the soup mixture over the top at the end. I added some peas and carrots in the soup mixture and served it with mashed potatoes on the side.

Good basic recipe.  I bought a roasted chicken from the grocrey store and pulled the meat off of it.  I also used Creamy Chicken and herbs soup.  I took another persons suggestion and rolled the chicken and cheese in the crescent rolls and baked those first.  I should have baked them longer than I did (hubby had to take over in the middle so I had no control) and then I poured the soup mixture in the dish and baked them for an additional 15 minutes.  They were really good even with the crescents not being 100% done.  I will be making this again.

I made this for dinner last night--my family loved it. I used shredded turkey and mozz cheese(was out of cheddar). I added garlic & onion powders, basil, sea salt & pepper. This makes for an easy weeknight dinner. Thanks for sharing!

The sauce the cheese, chicken and soup made was yummy- but the cresent rolls were so soggy and doughy like (even though I cooked them long enough) I couldn't eat the rolls.

I'm giving this recipe a 3 as is but with a couple changes, it's easily a ****. I changed it up a bit the second time I made it by cubing boneless, skinless chicken breasts and cooking them in a skillet with 1/2 can of the soup and 3/4 c heavy cream. I also waited until the crescents were cooked to pour the sauce over because I thought they were too soggy when cooked the way the recipe suggested.

This came out good. I accidentally only bought 1 can of cream of ck soup and followed the other reviews by adding less milk and only 1 can. It came out fine. I do recommend having more crescents, unless you want more sauce than crescent. Would make again. Thanks!

I used puff pastry instead of the crescent rolls (I dont like the sweetness), and it came out quite well.  I made 4 puff pillows instead of the rolls.  I would definately follow the previous suggestion of seasoning the chicken first.  Great recipe thanks!

This was a great recipe, very tasty.  My 2 year old does not eat veggies so instead of 2 cans of cream of chicken I used 1 can of cream of broccoli (one time broccoli cheese) and it was even better!

Super easy! It was maxing but I did tweak it a littleI used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken with cheddar cheese soup! I also recommend baking the rolls before adding any sauce mixture because our rolls were a tad soggy!! Will make again!

This was yummy, my husband had three servings! Next time I will modify the recipe a bit. I'm going to cut the cream of chicken and milk in half. I will also take the previous suggestions and cook the crescents first and then add the cream of chicken sauce.

This is one of my husband's favorite dishes. It's very salty but still yummy. We boil boneless breasts and prebake our rolls for a few minutes before adding the soup.

Very good recipe, but even though I do it the same way every time, it comes out differently.  Sometimes it its very creamy and others it is too dry.  A little plain as well, but overall pretty good for a soimple meal filled with carbs!

This was so quick and easy. Just boil the chicken for a little bit and follow directions!!! The only thing I did different was instead of 2 cans of cream of chicken, I did one cream of chicken, one cream of mushroom, and used fat free milk. Delicious and loved by all guest I was suprised to find out that they were coming over!! All things I had on hand. great with peas :)

This recipe was GREAT!!!! I made some minor changes, but everyone in my family liked it so much, i have made it 2 times in the past week. Rathre then using cream of chicken i used 1 can Cream of chicken w/ herb & one can of Cream of potato. Alos, I boiled the chicken instead and threw in some carrots. Once stuffed, i mixed the rest of the chicken & carrots in with the soup mix, and waited to pour in untill the cresents were about finished, that way they didnt get soggy. All n all a GREAT recipe!!!

I make this offten, but I cook the crescents before adding on the soup so they are not soggy.  Once they brown I pour on the soup and return to the oven till the soup is bubbly.

amazingly good......i had to stop myself from eating it all!  bake it with the sauce around the crescent rolls, then after baked, pour some on top so that you get the taste of it with the chicken.  it kind of tasted like a chicken cheese-steak to me!  yummy!

We used this recipe loosely as a base. Two pieces of bacon were cooked on the stove top until perfectly browned. It was then crumbled and put in to a 13x9 pan. We then sauteed a half of a cup of choppen onion and one and one half cloves of garlic in bacon juices. Once that was nicely done it was poured into the pan and stirred. Added one can of cream of chicken and can of cream of mushroom. Added one tablespoon of chopped fresh basil, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 Tbsp of black pepper, and stirred. Cooked two very large frozen chicken breasts on 350 for about 46 minutes. Shredded the chicken and mixed it in. Topped with  a layer of cheese and then eight, unrolled, crescents flat on the mixture. Cooked at 426 uncovered 15 mins, loosely covered at 350 ten minutes, then uncovered at 350 for five minutes. Our stuff came out excellent. The chicken mixture was hot and bubbly, cheese was melted, and crescents were brown and flaky. Tasted pretty good. :)

My hisband and 9 year old daughter really liked. I din't care for it though. I baked it without the sauce and let everyone add it at the end.

My boyfriend loved the dish. I enjoyed it. I think the ingredients have very good potential, but the recipe needs to be seriously modified. I didn't read the previous reviews. If I had, I would have made a few changes. First of all, I would cook the crescent rolls with the chicken and cheese before adding the sauce. I felt the rolls didn't have the opportunity to rise and brown resulting in a doughy taste. Second, I would only use half of the sauce mixture after the crescent rolls have browned. I did use more than one cup of cheese.  I feel once I make these modifications to the recipe it will be worth 5 stars.

Should have read all the reviews first.  This one really needs to be adjusted as there is way too much liquid to follow the recipe and have it come out edible.

My boyfriend liked it and so did I but I thought it was missing something? Just not quite sure what. I did follow others suggestions about not adding the soup mix until the cresents were cooked for about 10 min. Overall will probally make again.

We have VERY PICKY eaters in our family and we all enjoyed this dish. Be sure to have your rolls almost all the way baked before topping with remaining soup, cheese and chicken that will keep it from being too "doughy"  I think next time I will add a can of veg-all to the mix.  Thanks Kay for sharing your recipe.

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this, even though I made it completely incorrectly.  I started making this thinking I had all the proper ingredients on hand, oops!  I had biscuits instead of crescent rolls, and no milk.  

I layered the biscuits on the bottom of the baking dish and just put everything on as a topping.  I upped the cheese, since I LOVE cheese... so my bread to filling ratio was definately skewed to the filling side, but we liked it.  Since I didn't have milk, I just melted the cheese in the soup mix along with a couple of tablespoons of water to thin it out.  Poured it all on top and baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  The biscuit in the middle was not all of the way cooked, an extra 10 min would have done the trick.  I look forward to trying this recipe as it was actually intended, as we enjoyed my made up version quite a bit.

This recipe was too RICH and had too odd of a taste in it for my liking. Would have preferred it with either the soup and no cheese or vice versa. Will definitely not be making this one again.

This was wonderful and so easy!!  I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked the chicken and pastry in the oven for about 10 minutes, and then I added the soup and cooked it for another 10 minutes.  It turned out great!

My husband and I both flipped over this recipe.  Instead of just putting chicken in the crescent roll, I added chopped green onions and some cheese.  I also added 1 cup of cream cheese to soup mixture and that made it more creamy.  My husband has asked me to make this meal for his family when they come to our house for dinner.

I have to say that my husband really liked this recipe. My son (5 years old)who is an extremely picky eater ate all his food. The only thing I have to say is that I seasoned the chicken so it wouldn't be bland.  This is a good recipe to try.

My bundles were rather sad looking but tasted really good.  I followed the advice in another review to cut way down on the liquid and it seemed to work out.  I added some spices too.  The only problem I had was that they seemed to need longer in the oven than the recipe said.

DELICIOUS!  I used 2 cups Cheddar cheese, next time I'll use 2large or 3small skinned, boneless chicken breast.  I'm still deciding if I should use 16 crescents or not - this sauce is excellent over the brocolli that I made with it!!!!!

My family loved this! I used 1 can cream of chicken and one can cream of mushroom soup and added broccoli. There was more shredded chicken in sauce bc I used a store-bought rotisserie chicken to save time. I also baked it for 35-40 minutes. Delicious! My husband liked my homemade condensed cream of chicken soup ( found here on Allrecipes) and suggested using it for this dish next time. Be creative- add spices or veggies you love.

Family loved this -  however, the first time i made it, the dough didnt cook through. I now bake it (covered) without the soup on top. After it bakes for 12 minutes, i add half the soup mixture. bake again for another 10 minutes. Pour remaining soup on top and bake a little longer until its bubbly. (for the final 5-7 minutes of cooking, uncover it)

I adapted this recipes to accomodate my love for chicken cordon bleu. Instead of chicken filling, I used a mixture of chicken and ham. Instead of cheddar, I used shredded Swiss cheese. I love the texture of the crescents with the soup. I will definitely make this again, and next time, I think I'll try it the way it's written.

I will make it again.  Followed hints from others and baked the crescents before adding the soup mixture.  I also wrapped a thin slice of cream cheese with the chicken in the crescent.  Put extra cheddar on top after adding the soup before baking a little longer to melt the cheese.  It was very good and my picky husband really liked it.

I made this just as I should and no one in the house liked it. The cream of chicken mixture was just so overpowering almost. Everyone has different tastes though....so this is just my opinion.

Loved this recipe. Easy to make and delicious. I did reduce soup to 1 1/2 cans and made sure to brown crescent rolls well before adding last bit of cheese.  I also stuck it under the broiler to brown cheese quicker. We will definitely make this again!!

I love this recipe but you need to cook the stuffed crescents with very little sauce around them, otherwise they become soggy. I also add shredded cheese on top at about 5 min from the end of baking.

I have been making this recipe for years now. I do make it a little different though. I add a can of green chilis to the chicken and cheese mixture along with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Sometimes I add sour cream to the soup mixture as well. My whole family loves this dish!

My husband and kids like this recipe.  I actually make some with the sauce and some without.  The kids like to just pick the "roll" up and eat it like normal instead of it being more like a casserole.  Overall easy and tasty.

I chose this recipe because I wanted to use leftover chicken and some crescent rolls and I didn't have any cream cheese.  They were surprisingly pretty good. I halved the recipe.  I also mixed the chicken, cheese, and some of the soup (so it would adhere)then pre-cooked the stuffed crescent rolls for about 20 minutes.  I should have cooked them for longer because they were still a little gooey.  Then I added the rest of the soup and cooked for another 10 minutes.  Not bad for a quick meal...

My mother made this meal when I was young and it has always been one of my favorites. I cook it now for my husband and kids and they love it. I also cook the sauce on the stove and pour over the crescents after they have baked in the oven. Love this recipe!

Based on the other reviews, I made some modifications as well, but with the changes, it was great!

I used the chicken breast, boiled then shredded. Then, I used one can of Cream of Broccoli, one can of Fiesta Cheese soup, 1 1/2 cups of milk, and added frozen peas and carrots to the soup mixture. I put half the soup mixture in the bottom with the extra chicken and sprinkled with cheese, then added the chicken and cheese crescents, baked as suggested, and then topped with remaining soup and a layer of cheese- VERY yummy!!!

I followed others' suggestions, used 1 1/2 c milk, 1 can of soup, and baked them without the soup mixture. Totally yummy, if not a little bland, and my daughter's loving them at 19 months cause she won't eat anything not white in color lol. Kinda small but good, just make a side to go with them!

My husband thought it was really good. I took some suggestions from other reviews,& tweaked it a little bit. I seasoned the chicken & put onions in it after I shredded it.In the sauce, I added diced red bell pepper,onions & black pepper. The sauce was great! I poured it over the rest after I cooked them,but the cressants were still a bit doughy for me. It was kind of like an odd verson of baked chicken & dumplings. Also the time was a little more consuming.

This was really good. I will agree a little salty. I just put a tablespoon of the sauce  over the cheese before I rolled them up and they were perfect. Still flaky. I need to figure out the salty problem and then we will for sure make again.

This was a big hit in my house tonight!  My older two daughters, 8 & 6, helped assemble the crescents.  I took the advice of some readers and didn't pour the sauce on until after they had baked.  I also used both cans of soup, but half the milk and a little more cheese to make the sauce thicker and cheesier.  To lower the calories and fat, I used low fat crescents, low fat cheese (don't use fat free, it won't melt properly), 1% milk, and low fat/low sodium soup.  Will definately make this again!

This was really, really good! The next time I make this I will wait till I serve it to pour on the soup mixture. I thought that the crescents came out soggy. Other than that, this will definitely be made in this house again! Oh and I used a can of the cheese soup as well.

I wish 4.5 stars were an option.  This was a very good & very easy recipe.  My initial reaction was that it tasted too salty, but everyone else gobbled it up like there was no tomorrow and thought I was crazy.  The toddlers weren't impressed at all, but that's not saying much.  We talked about making a few minor additions... finely chopped celery & slivered almonds would have given it a nice texture and mild flavor.  I'll certainly make this again.  I wish I could tell you how they are left-over... 4 adults and 2 toddlers ate them all up!

My boyfriend only asks me to repeat recipes if he really loves something since we both love trying new foods. He had barely finished his first bite when he said this one was a keeper! I thought it made way too much sauce, but he said to keep the amount the same and serve it with mashed potatoes next time, as a sort of gravy. I cooked the crescent rolls with the chicken in them for about 15 minutes, until they were almost done, then I added the soup mixture, which I had been cooking on the stovetop. I baked for about 10 more minutes, until the crescent tops were browned and crispy. I had quite a bit of leftover shredded chicken so I just mixed that into the soup while it was simmering on the stove. I did use 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cheddar cheese soup. Thanks for the yummy comfort food recipe.

The amount of sauce that this recipe made seemed to be far too much for the rolls, and I found that the rolls did not cook properly in the time specified with all that liquid around them.  The concept is good, though, and I believe I will make it again only cooking the rolls and sauce separately and pouring the heated sauce over the top before serving.

A classic family favorite my mom used to make.  Delicious, filling, and easy---but appears to guests to be difficult.  Try adding cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup for a great twist!  Also, a spoonful of soup mixture inside each rollup of chicken makes this extra moist and creamy.

SOOOOO yummy!  I had 3 picky 13 year olds for dinner and everyone loved it.  I didn't use all of the sauce.  I would recommend only using one can of soup.  For the chicken, I just used a rotisserie chicken from the store...simply wonderful.  Oh and I used low-fat crescents and no one could tell.

The recipe says to pour half of the chicken soup mixture into the dish and then pour the rest later.  I only used half and poured it in at the start then set my crescent rolls on top and it was not too soggy at all.  I also made sure I sprinkled some of the cheese into the soup mixture and that caused it to thicken up as it baked too.  Overall I thought this was a good dish.  I used precut chicken tenders to wrap up in the rolls.  They were a good size but I cooked them on the stove top.  I think I will bake them next time.

This was okay but we didn't care for it.  The crescents came out soggy.

Easy, fasy and the kids loved it - that's enough to get 5 stars from me!  Not something you make to impress company, but good enough flavor to throw together in a pinch.  Would also be easy to modify to your own taste.  I used canned chicken.  I'll be making this again.

I love these things!  I made a few changes...I LOVE cheese so I added more cheese.  I also found a quicker way to make these.  I had a craving for these & didn't want to wait the time to boil and debone the chicken.  I used canned chicken and it worked great.  I also made an extra pan of the sauce to pour over them at the table.

This recipe is a regular at our house.  Its quick and easy and we love it!  We have started using smoked whole chickens from our grocery's deli.  The chicken is already cooked, so we just debone and shred.  So easy and the smoked chicken gives it a great flavor.

My family really loves this recipe. As soon as my husband tasted it, he said "it's a keeper!" Very easy, too. I used canned chicken instead of cooking a whole one, and I used Sargento brand salsa cheddar cheese. Yummy!!
