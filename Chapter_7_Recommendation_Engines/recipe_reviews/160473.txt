I left out the alfalfa and used my own vinaigrette - and the first cucumber from my garden. Fresh, beautiful, excellent.

Excellent through and through! A veritable cornucopia of flavour for the taste buds, that kept my mouth entertained to the end.

This works perfectly for a tasty and simple salad.  I used baby spinach this time and will try the arugula next time I have it.  Balsamic compliments leafy greens very nicely.
