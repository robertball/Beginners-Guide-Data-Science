I give this recipe 5 stars not really based on the original recipe (although it is a good base), but rather on my own adjustments which I made after reading comments that it was bland on its own. I will eventually add this as a separate recipe. My husband loved this recipe.  My adjustments are as follows. added 1tsp garlic powder, added 1/4 C dried/crushed spinach, 3/4tsp salt, used onion powder rather than onion salt, substituted rotini for the spaghetti. The only thing I omitted was the bay leaf. Followed directions, but added the flour to the butter/onions before adding broth. added cooked pork to sauce before pouring over pasta.  This turned out very well, but next time I will cover it with aluminum foil for the first 20 minutes to prevent the pasta from getting chewy.

This was great! I used some left over porkchops that were marinated in applejuice & seasonings. I accidentally skipped the sour cream, parsley and lemon juice and used half & half instead of milk just because I had to use it up. This was a very tasty, creamy and delicious recipe!

Good base, but definitely would've been tasteless as written.  Used egg noodles instead, added frozen chopped spinach and sliced black olives.  Substituted quite a bit more pork stock for chicken stock, a splash of cream and greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.  Added a lot of italian spices and garlic.  Topped with the bread crumbs and parmesan.  It was very good and I will make again, but without all the extra spice, the sauce would've totally fell flat (tasted it before adjusting it).

This was a perfect recipe to salvage a mediocre pork roast.  My entire family (even the four kids ages 2-9) LOVED it!  This is a keeper.

Never made pork into tetrazzini before ... huge hit for these leftovers!  Family enjoyed, even husband, who says he is "not big on casseroles."

The main reason I'm giving this a 5-star review is because it's very kid-friendly, and my 3- and 5-year old loved it. They had three servings. In my opinion, it was pretty bland and very heavy for a summer dinner, but since the kids ate it, I consider it a home run! The pork I used was left over from a crock pot meal I made earlier in the week that consisted of a pork roast slow cooked with beef bullion for 8 hours on low. The meat turned out pretty bland, so maybe using a better recipe to cook the meat would have made it turn out better. The bread crumbs on top were a nice touch to make a different consistency. I also used a 16 oz box of spaghetti and a much larger casserole dish (13 x 9), so we have more leftovers.

I doubled the recipe and used shell shaped pasta because we had no spaghetti.  I also more than doubled the veggies and added red pepper.  Added a little cream cheese at the end with the sour cream and a few extra spices including garlic powder, paprika and a little hot sauce.  I really like the addition of a bay leaf in the cream sauce, I've never thought of that before.  Yum!!

Very bland. I even spiced it up because of the other reviews.

It was a good basic start.  I added quite a bit of Italian seasoning to mine before I added the broth.  That helped a lot.  It was a great meal for my family.

While this was a little dull, it was a great way to use up leftover pork roast.  This would definitely benefit from additional seasonings.

Not good at all. I am dumbfounded by the great reviews of this. It was so bland and unappetizing! The sauce just tasted of flour paste. I didn't change a single thing about this recipe and I wish that I had... more spices, less flour... something! At least it was just a waste of leftover pork and cheap spaghetti noodles. Thanks anyway.

Very good basic recipe.  I did not use the lemon juice because I was using leftover lemon pepper pork loin.  I wouldn't make any changes.  My kids ate it up!
