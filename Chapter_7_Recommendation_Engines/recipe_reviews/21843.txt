I tried this recipe and was pleased with the easiness in preparation...However, I felt it could use a few additions... I would add

1 tsp of vanilla extract
1 tsp of sugar
1-2 tbsp of butter/margarine (melted)

When I added these three ingredients. The result was a more flavorful pancake,  so play with it!
The lingonberry idea was great! I'm never using syrup again

These are super easy,excellent and turn out beautifully! I like to roll them up like crepes with yogurt inside and then sprinkled with powdered sugar. Try them!

This are delicious.  If you have ever had the Swedish pancaes at IHOP, then these taste an awful lot like them.  I could not get lingonberries,  so I used some red currant jelly instead on the side.  These were so easy and I'd serve them to holiday guests - they'd never realize how quick and easy these are to prepare. Yum Yum Yum!
