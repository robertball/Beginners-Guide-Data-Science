Great recipe - I took the suggestions of other reviewers and did the following:  doubled the recipe; put pecans, 1 stick of melted butter, and 1 cup brown sugar in the bottom of a 9x13 pan before pouring the batter in.  In the batter,  I used 2 large eggs and didn't double the baking powder.  Just before putting in the oven  - I sprinkled the batter with cinnamon.  It came out perfect - inverted the pan on a platter and served with the pecan side up.  Made it extra rich by serving with a combo of melted butter and syrup, with a side of bacon.  Was a real treat - like a dessert - cross between a sticky bun and pancake!  DH loved it!!

I adjusted just a couple ingredients to reflect what I had on hand--I used "soured" lactose-free milk, melted margerine instead of butter and a full egg instead of egg substitute. This baked up beautifully. Between the two boys, they ate the whole pan spread with margerine and my homemade blackberry-raspberry jam. NOTE: If you're feeding a larger family, you might want to double or triple the recipe and use a bigger baking pan. This one made six "squares" for us.

I thought this was great.  I topped them with the Sauted Apples from here and they were fantastic.  I used 2 regular eggs instead of egg beaters, and brown sugar instead of white.  I also cut back on the baking powder as per some other suggestions and did half AP and half WW flour.  My hubby said there is no way this would be 16 servings tho...he could eat half himself...lol!  All in all this was a great quick breakfast...I am sure I will do this again.  Thanks Jen!

I made these for my 3 boys this morning, and they loved them. I added brown sugar and cinnamon to the batter for flavor. I agree that this doesn't feed 16, between me and my boys we finished the 9 squares it made, and they still wanted more. Also I did a breakdown of the calories and 1/9th of a piece equals around 192 calories, add 1/4 cup of syrup to 2 pieces and you have an additional 210 calories. I had 2 squares 1/4 cup syrup, and 8 oz of orange juice, then added the calories up and was disappointed to find I had consumed over 700 calories for breakfast. So I guess if you are watching your weight this is not the recipe for you. Needless to say I won't be eating much the rest of the day. Otherwise great for kids.

This was pretty good but I changed a few things. I added 2 TBS more sugar, 1/2 brown sugar,reduced the amount of baking powder and I put on the bottom pecans, 1 cup brown sugar and 1 stick of butter melted in the pan then poured the batter over and baked. They disappeared fast. Even my dad at 3 peices!

Good BASE recipe.  Quite bland alone.  Definitely need to add chocolate chips, nuts, bananas, cinnamon, etc, whatever you like.

This is AMAZING ... I did the version with the butter/brownsugar ... but as written the recipe would be awesome, too!  For those who said it was bland, do you not realize that pancakes are supposed to be served with margarine or butter and syrup???  The batter is sweet ... I only used 1 1/2 tsp white sugar, 1 tsp of baking powder, and forgot to add the salt.  (Good thing... baking powder has enough sodium in it anyway!)  Hubby said this goes in my repertoire.  Thanks for the recipe!  You ROCK!
UPDATE:  Once again, we were out of pancake mix and (amazingly) we had the ingredients on hand -- Made it again -- without the caramelized topping ... OMG !!!! (as the kids say) Melt in your mouth, absolutely fantastic -- It's easy and fills you up (but it does not feed 16 servings -- okay, so the measurements were made to make it attractive to calorie counters -- it does not make this recipe bad! -- This is definitely a keeper (and so much cheaper then pancake mix!)

This was really great.  It didn't rise as much as I expected, but I did mix about 3/4 - 1 cup of wild blueberries into the mix, so that could have affected it.  Next time, I'll put the blueberries in the bottom of the pan and then pour the batter on top.  (This would be great with sauteed apples on the bottom too!) I also used 1 jumbo egg in exchange for egg substitute.

I used soy milk instead of dairy milk and the squares came out awesome!  Yummy recipe, especially with chocolate chips in them.

I was looking for a tasty, easy recipe to make for overnight guests but this isn't it.  First, it does not make 16 servings but that's kind of obvious using an 8x8 baking dish.  It's more like 4 adult servings.  It was quite bland so the next time I made a few changes.  I used 2 eggs, 2 Tbsps Splenda (could have used double), 1 tsp cinnamon, dash of nutmeg, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/8 tsp salt and 1/4c chopped pecans and it was still a very dry and bland without some powdered sugar and lots of syrup.  Next time I'll try adding some sauteed apples or something to add some flavor.  Good idea though!

I followed the recipe and my family, unfortunately, did not like them.  I thought the idea of serving these for a crowd would be quick and delicious.  The recipe also states for 16 people.  They would 1 inch by 1 inch squares and other items would need to be served.

This was okay.  I would recommend cutting the baking powder down, because it has that "baking powder taste".  Also, unless you top it with fruit or syrup, the overall taste isn't very good.  We used fresh bing cherries and didn't have any leftovers, but I won't make this again.

My kids love this and I make it all the time.  Would never make 16 servings though.  Love the butter and brown sugar idea on top.

i agree with other reviewers; this recipe was quite bland alone.  I ate them with honey and cinnamon on top and liked the texture, but if you're looking to make this recipe, be sure to add your own spices and flavors to up the excitement level for your taste buds.

ps lower the amount of baking powder

I thought this recipe tasted more like cornbread than pancakes. I even added chocolate chips, but it still tasted really dry and bland.

Pretty good base recipe, though it needed a little more milk. I might try to make it thinner next time. Cool texture though. Great topped with cinnamon, sugar, and whipped topping.

These were so easy and fantastic!  We like to make "breakfast for dinner" and I've always avoided pancakes because they are so time consuming when cooking for a family.  These pancake squares were a cinch to mix up and pop in the oven.  They disappeared!  We like to serve these with hot syrup or homemade berry sauce.  Yum!

This is a good alternative to regular pancakes.  I just used regular eggs and it turned out great.  If you have a larger family, you may want to double the recipe to satisfy everyone.

Heavy and not very sweet. Pretty bland all things considered. It might be better with different add ins, but it would still be very heavy and dense

I followed the recipe exactly except for adding a touch of cinnamon and mine also tasted more like cornbread than pancakes. My boyfriend liked them only when they were smothered with syrup but I did not care for this recipe. Thank you anyways.

Super Yummy!  

The nice thing is that this is an adaptable reciepe, so you can make the pancake bites whatever flavour you'd like.

This is perfect for a travel day . . . they made a great snack in the car during a long and sometimes weary road trip.

This was pretty good, I used almond milk instead of regular since we were out and added two big dollops of sour cream. I also modified the brown sugar on the bottom, chunks of butter (1/2 stick) instead of melted, 1/4 c brown sugar and no nuts. It came out tasty, almost like syrup, kids loved it. Next time we'll try to make it a bit more savory with bacon and green chili and no sugar topping.

So good! I took the advice of others and came up with an oatmeal-cinnamon-sugar flavored cake. So great topped with syrup, honey, or jelly. I tried it all. Thank you!!! I will make this again and again.

My husband typically eats cold cereal for breakfast and is not into pancakes, but he loved these. He actually went back for a second helping! I doubled the recipe and made 2 pans because I was feeding 3 boys, my husband, and myself. I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour with the white flour. Very light and delicious!

This was extremely simple and good. It tastes like pancakes with a cornbread consistency. I served it with the buttermilk syrup recipe also found on this site.

I used this recipe for my weekend with my two grandson's, and they loved it. I had no chocolate chips, so sprinkled some mini M&M's on top. My grandson's didn't like the chocolate!! Amazing, as they are 8 and 6 years old! I served it with sausage patties, a fried egg, and marionberry syrup. I also doubled the recipe, and baked it in an 9X13" pan, and used two eggs instead of the substitute eggs. I will make this recipe, without the chocolate, the next time I have company. I had all of the ingredients ready the night before, and it was so easy! I also thought of slicing it, and adding berry jam, or serving it with sausage gravy in the future. Great recipe!

WOW! I made a few alterations (Because I'm a health FREAK!) and they were GREAT!  I used fat-free margarine, 4 egg whites rather than egg substitute, Splenda in place of sugar, whole-wheat flour and 1 cup of frozen blueberries.  Had to use muffin tins because the wife lent all of our baking dishes out, and baked them for 20 min.  PERFECT!!!  The kids LOVE them!

These were merely okay for me, and the base recipe here requires a lot of doctoring.  I used a medium egg instead of egg substitute, half the baking powder, added a splash of vanilla, and before I poured the batter into the pan, I melted 4 T butter, mixed it with 1/2 c brown sugar and some macadamia nuts in the bottom of the pan.  After baking, there was a lot of excess butter around the edges I poured off before inverting it on a plate.  The brown sugar was still a little grainy.  A nice change from saturday-morning pancakes or waffles, but probably won't be a mainstay.

I liked this, but didn't love it. Its very easy and if i do make it again I will add blueberries or something. It was a little plain and not "pancake"-y" tasting. I guess I was expecting a bit more.

This is a good basic recipe that's adaptable to so many garnishments.  And best of all, the ingredients are all on your shelf...usually I have no buttermilk when I am in the mood for pancakes. I used one large egg and 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, 1/2 c. allpurpose and they were great.  I also like how portable this breakfast is!

AWESOME!  tasted just like pancakes and so quick and easy.  My 7 year old and husband loved it.  Will use again and again.  Would be great recipe to double or triple and take to a brunch pitch-in.

The kids really liked this one.  The texture was like corn bread and the flavor like pancakes.  The recipe says it makes 16 servings, but it makes 16 squares.  (About four servings)  I had to make a second batch to fill everyone up.

Great base recipe that can be adapted to meet family's tastes and/or mood.  Uses ingredients I usually have on hand in the pantry.  I doubled recipe, baked in a 9x13 casserole dish, and fed my family of six (kids ages: 10 to 4 years).  I used real eggs (2 in place of 1/4 cup egg beaters).  I also placed melted butter, brown sugar, pecans, and a smattering of mini-chocolate chips in the dish before pouring in the batter.  No syrup needed.  Kids loved it!  I've made it as written and doubled with the addition of flour-dusted frozen blueberries (which requires a little extra baking time) and the family finishes the entire 9x13 dish.

Made this for dinner.  Added vanilla, used two eggs instead if egg substitute and frozen blueberries.  Also doubled the recipe.  My two kids loved it!!!!.  Served it with bacon and maple syrup.  This is a keeper. Perfect for cold winter nights or cold mornings.

I agree with Yvonnellam, Seemed like a decent base recipe. It is very plain if you leave it as it is written out. Definitely need other ingredients for flavor. I used a butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon glaze. I slathered it over the top during the last five minutes of cooking and it came out like a cinnamon roll cake :-)  Happy cooking!

These taste absolutely nothing like pancakes. they come out really flat and look like cornbread. the serving size is ridiculously small. two boys were still hungry for more food after eating this.

My guests really liked these last weekend, and I am planning to make the again for my B&B this weekend.  That deserves 5 stars!
I serve them with a blueberry sauce on this site - a perfect summer breakfast!   Thanks for the post!

When I decided to make this, I only had whole wheat flour in the house.  It still turned out pretty nicely.  My family thought it was okay, but nothing to rave about.  I think I'll stick with pancakes made on the stovetop!

Really good, especially if you like your pancakes thick with a bit of a crunchy edge. The edge gets just a bit crunchy- YUM! I sprinkled fresh blueberries on the top before baking- DOUBLE YUM!

Pretty good. I used whole wheat flour in mine, because I love whole grain pancakes. I also used 1 egg instead of the substitute, because I didn't have any on hand. The best part is how easy they are to make! I always tend to mess up regular pancakes, and this is much less hassle to deal with. Next time I think I'll try them with blueberries...

This has become the new weekend request.  I've varied it twice: I added mini chocolate chips once and I added pumpkin puree and vanilla extract another time.  This recipe is so easy and guaranteed to please!
