The bananas, I didnt mind. But the mustard sauce  with the raisins was gross...too thick and ruined the fish. I threw everything out.

The combination of both bananas and mustard was not as good as I had expected.  The raisins were good though, I think minus the mustard it would taste really good.

This was delicious! I didn't have any bananas, so I used a mango. I know bananas would taste great in this dish, and can't wait to make this again.

This dish is quick, easy and the sauce is delicious. I didn't have lemon juice so used several grinds of lemon pepper. Everything else the same. Will use again.

I have made this dish twice already because we really enjoyed the flavor. However, we felt we had to hunt for the fish there was so much sause. Next time I make it I will double the fish and keep everything else the same. I also used frozen mashed bananas one time because there are so many in the frezer. Made it sweeter to counteract the spice. Too sweet for one of my brothers but the rest of us enjoyed the change.

For 2 of us, I made half, and followed the recipe fairly closely.  Have to say, this was very unusual, and a spectacular blend of flavors. I used whole-grain mustard, and a previously frozen, overripe  banana and added extra milk when the sauce was too thick.  The soft bananas blended well into the sauce once cooked, and the result was such a different and delicious surprise.  My husband kept raving, and even talked more about it today.  The tasty sauce let the mild fish flavor come through.  This recipe is worth a try.
