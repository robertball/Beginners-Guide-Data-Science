I would give this five stars, but I just thought the beer flavor was to strong.  At least for me.  I would make it again with about 1/2  the amount of beer. The beef was very tender, and the chocolate and cinnamon in the recipe give it a unique taste.  I topped mine with mozzarella cheese and some chips.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I was looking for a chili recipe that had both chocolate and cinnamon in the ingredients list. This is the one I chose. I heard that these ingredients were the secret to winning a chili cookoff. WELL, lets just say I'll never make a recipe to serve (especially to be judged) without giving it a trial run first. The people were commenting on the flavor while taste-testing my chili (and not in a good way). Over all, the recipe was a flop. People were warning others not to even try this one. So glad it was anonymous! I dumped it when I got home.

Yum! I omitted the beer entirely, and used about 1/4 C of cocoa powder instead of the chocolate  (since I didn't have either of these ingredients). I will be making this again, probably adding corn and another can of beans.

We substituted poblanos for the green peppers and a tablespoon of ancho chili powder for one of the regular chili powder and loved it. We also had it over some rice to bind with the great sauce. The meat was very tender and flavorful. Canâ€™t wait to make it again.
