Another winner from Chef John. Marinated for 24 hours. Amazing flavors and VERY moist. Did NOT get a chance to taste the onions since my husband snarfed them all. Next time I will double the onions, for sure!

After reading through the reviews, I decided to bake mine in 2 cast iron skillets. I believe the key to not having burnt onions it to bake this in a dish, and not on a baking pan, and being sure to place the onions UNDER the chicken. I put a heavy layer of onions on the bottom (I think I used almost 3 onions.) Drizzled them with a little olive oil & seasoned with salt & pepper before continuing. Then after everything was in the frying pans, I filled in the spaces between the chicken with cut up red potatoes. Baked, covered, at 400 degrees for about 45 minutes then removed the foil and baked a few minutes longer to get that golden color. It was delicious.

This was excellent! I'm not a big Dijon mustard fan. But this was really good! I would definitely do it again! I didn't have red wine vinegar and used apple cider vinegar. Didn't have cayenne and used red pepper flakes. I'm usually a purist to sticking to the recipe as written. But I'm broke! So buying additional stuff just wasn't happening this week!

I suggest using Pyrex. My heavy duty baking sheet warped in the high temps and no need for foil with the lightly greased dish. This also made it easier pouring the drippings into the saucepan....also... double the onion...... Absolutely Delicious!

Made this recipe for my family with boneless, skinless chicken thighs and they just loved it - we left out the chipotle and cayenne due to personal preference.  They raved over the onions and couldn't stop talking about it!  Definitely be making this again!

This was a perfect chicken dish...first off - thighs.  You can't do better than tender, juicy thighs.  The seasoning was out of this world, and it imparted such a wonderful, crusty finish.  Try this.  You will NOT be disappointed!

Awesome recipe!  It was the first of many receipes tried from Chef John of Food Wishes.  I didn't change a thing except to add an extra onion and a little more garlic.  We're big onion and garlic in my family.  My picky father gave it 2 thumbs and 2 toes up:)

Marinated for 6 hrs. using boneless, skinless thighs. Between Chef John's comment and another reviewer, I figured they would work fine. Trouble is, cooking time should be adjusted.  Boneless cook faster than bone-in.  I took the thighs out earlier than what the recipe called for (could tell they were done) but they were still a bit dry.  I was also expecting more flavor 'pop' with the ingredients of the marinade.  Might give it another whirl with bone-in.

This came out perfect. Had 7 ppl for dinner, normally would not try something new on guest but I was confident it would be good. Rave reviews from all. Full of flavor and so moist. I followed the directions exactly, which one should always do with Chef John. He knows what he's doing.

We have made this recipe several times, it's now one of my absolute favorite meals.  The onions alone are spectacular.  The sauce created would make an old shoe taste delicious. I make it as is, no changes.  If I could give it 6 stars, I would.

I tried this first with bone-in skin-on thighs, without chipotle powder (which I did not have) and thought it was outstanding!  I marinated overnight, baked, and could have licked the pan.  Today, I am using bone-in skin-on chicken breasts (with the chipotle I might say) and the aroma is driving me out of my mind.  CJ you rock!!!  This has to be the best chicken recipe ever!!!!!

I made this precisely as written and it was a big hit with my family - now in the top of the chicken rotation.  Please adhere to the recipe if you are going to review it, Chef John is a pro who consistently comes through.... if you don't go making goofy substitutions to his well constructed recipes.

Let me start this by saying that I am not a cook. I ruin the easiest of meals. I did not ruin this meal and my husband was THRILLED with the outcome. The marinade was super easy to make and when I didn't have something on hand (crushed chipotle peppers, for example) I just substituted something I thought was similar (like paprika). So good. We will be making this again and again. Thanks for the awesome and budget friendly recipe!

Excellent, just perfectly delicious.  Skipped the chipotle because I didn't have it and only had four hours to marinate, and was still an amazing dish.  Can't wait to make it again and marinate for longer.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe earlier this week, and the only changes made were using white vinegar with 1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar added instead of red wine vinegar, as I didn't have red wine vinegar. Also used 1 tsp of the liquid chipotle sauce as I don't have the powdered chipotle.  It was very easy to put together and I left it to marinade 4 hours. The chicken browned perfectly, the meat was juicy, and the sauce made with the marinade plus onion and cooking juices was AWESOME. I must emphasize that there is NOT a strong mustard taste as the other ingredients and meat juices blend all the flavours together.  This is one of the best oven-baked chicken recipes I have ever made and will definitely make it again.

I did my usual seat-of-the pants version, tossing the marinade ingredients right into the bag. No brown sugar so I used white sugar plus a teaspoon of Chinese dark soy sauce to get that molasses taste into the marinade. I mulched all the ingredients in the bag until the sugar dissolved and put the chicken into the bag. I refrigerated it overnight and all the next day and made it last night. Wow, a lot of taste for such simple ingredients. I baked mine for 1 hour at 375 degrees without onion rings and got mahogany-brown chicken pieces that were spicy, sweet, juicy, and tender. I might reduce oven temp to 350 next time. It gave off a lot of fat.

This was quick and everyone loved it, even my 9 year old! The flavor is amazing and not too sweet, spicy, but that is adjustable and the flavors just go so well together. We will be making this regularly! I used thighs with no skin or bone and as a time saver, I did not marinate, but it was wonderful without it, I can't imagine how marinating would increase the flavor. Give this one a go! More people need to give this a try. No pic was attached cause we ate it all!

First time I've written a review.  This is absolutely delicious...the family raved about it.  Even our picky eater loved it.  This is the best chicken I've ever eaten.  We will definitely be serving this often. I used part skin on thighs and part skin off, both with bone in.  We preferred the skin off.  The skin didn't add anything to taste and too much grease. Thanks Chef John.

Followed the recipe as provided -- LOVED it and will make it again! Perfect blend of sweet and spicy; something about the Dijon mustard makes this recipe extra yummy. I suggest first trying the original recipe and then increasing the sweet or spicy to taste. For me, I will slightly increase the spicy by adding hot sauce of some sort to the marinade. Keeper!

Fantastic flavors! Ended up in the marinade for about 8 hours which seemed to suit my wife and I just fine. Made Sarah's Rice Pilaf and small tossed salad as a side. I wonder how this would be grilled. May be my next experiment :)

We loved this chicken, although I confess I used bone-in breasts with skin instead of the thighs. The breasts stayed nice and juicy and the meat was extremely flavorful in spite of the fact I forgot to add the garlic to the marinade (and added garlic powder on the meat instead) and also forgot the onions! What a forgetful day it was! But dinner was yum in spite of it! I marinaded the meat for 5 hours and roasted some chunked Yukon golds with a bit of olive oil and herbs off to the side of the meat, in the same pan. It was all done at the same time...perfect! Thanks for a great recipe!

Closer to the bone....   d@mn straight. This one never fails to please!!! I've done it to the T. I've improvised. I've added this and that. 
I love this best served over a bed of spinach with brown rice and some variation of squash. 
The husband raves( He's Greek from Athens and all that entails),  Guests swoon. I, as a foodie and secret Fat Kid,am tickled pleased to no end!! 
go ahead, DO IT.

I can't express how good these chicken thighs are. I let the chicken marinate for about 24 hours. I also added the extra salt and cayenne to the top before baking and baked for about 40 minutes. I had no issues with the onions burning and the pan sauce was AMAZING and worth the extra few minutes. Served this with the Lemon Basmati rice recipe from this site and some veggies. Looking forward to the leftovers tonight!

This was delish. I removed the top layer of skin on my bone in chicken thighs only because I have baked them before with the skin on for other recipes and found it to be to greasy/fatty. After following the rest of the recipe exactly as it reads, I was really pleased and surprised by the results. The chicken was moist and the reduced pan sauce was so flavorful! I made jasmine rice to go with it and went great with the onions and chicken. I gave this five stars because the recipe is perfect for me just the way it is. We don't normally use these types of flavors with most of our cooking so it was a nice change of pace. Just the perfect amount of spicy and sweet. Do try this one!

Made it with pork chops, adjusted amounts for five pork chops, reduced the chipotle and omitted the cayenne. It was really good. Served with buttered noodles and sautéed cabbage (in butter with onions). I have to try it with chicken (and a nice creamy coleslaw).
Thanks Chef John. I will continue making this. If I don't want to turn on the oven, I can always grill it indoors or outdoors, with grilled onions as well. Anyway, GREAT!

I hate being one of those who change the recipe and rate ite it, but I did and I am.  I used chicken leg quarters (@19 cents a pound, who wouldn't?).  Also used a 13"x 9" Pyrex dish, made the pour easier and doubled the garlic, you can NEVER have too much garlic!

This was awesome. But I didn't bake at 450 I baked for 70 min at 400.. The onions caramelized, and the onions went on top at serving. It was moist and so delicious. Will definitely make again. Thank you Chef John.

Wonderful flavor after marinating for only two hours!  I can only imagine how good it would be if I'd had the time to marinate for six hours.  This does not taste like mustard.  All of the ingredients blend together for a wonderful, slightly spicy flavor.  I will definitely make this again!  (I used boneless chicken thighs)

Awesome taste. I did not get to marinade it for 24 hours, but started early am. I also used crushed red pepper flakes in place of the hot peppers. This was SUPERB!

Yum! I marinated all day and instead of roasting them in the oven, we bbq since summer is coming to an end. Very tasty and moist. A nice balance of heat and sweetness. :) As always, you don't disappoint Chef John!

This was excellent and smelled divine! I only marinated for about 4-5 hours and it was still well-flavored. No changes made- or needed! All I plan to do differently next time is let it marinate longer. Paired very well w/rice pilaf and roasted parm broccoli. And a beer! Thanks, Chef John!

Wow, these were awesome!  Double the onions for sure and I would cut down the salt just a tad bit.  The only alternate change I made was to use a teaspoon of canned chipotle peppers.

Only change I made was using boneless and skinless thighs. Marinated over night and grilled on the grill! Everyone wanted the recipe.  It's a keeper.

This is my go-to chicken marinade! I've been making it for a few years now. It gets rave reviews every time. I use boneless, skinless thighs and marinade overnight. I also use balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine. This works w/out the chipotle powder, but it adds a great element to the flavor profile, so add it if you can! We typically make these on the grill. I used this recipe for a party last night - 4x the marinade for 55 thighs! I'd say one batch of marinade is enough for up to 15 small boneless, skinless thighs.  Enjoy!

Loved the flavors but hated the cooking method. I made this receipe exactly as directed in the Chef John Video but baking in the foil covered pan turned out to be a big mess. My oven was covered in hot grease and the house filled with smoke before the cooking time was over. I had to finish off the chicken in the microwave, air out the house and clean the oven. Next time I will cook on the grill.

I make this using bone-in skin-on breasts. Comes out great. I'm still working on adjusting the cooking time so that my onions don't get too blackened to eat, though, something is awry in my substitutions. 2 breasts is probably rendering enough fat & water to replace 8 thighs, but 4 breasts is too much food, soo...still working on my perfect middle ground. Thanks for sharing!

How odd, I didn't like this one bit. The recipes by chef john usually become a family fave.  It was plenty spicy and sorta resembled a wasabi taste which I hate.  Maybe if I omitted the dry mustard powder, it should be okay.

This was the perfect  recipe. Not too spicy and not too sweet. I substituted apple cider vinegar for red wine and used chilli powder in place of the chipotle. I also used 1/3 cup of brown sugar for a little extra sweetness. This will definitely become a family favorite!

Disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly, including bone-in, skin-on thighs marinated overnight. There was way too much fat, and the thighs didn't cook thoroughly. (I used a temperature probe and took the chicken out when the probe hit 165F, well after 45 minutes; turns out, only that one thigh was thoroughly done. And with bone-in, it took forever to finish the thighs in the microwave.) I'm usually cooking for one (unless there's company), and I planned to package the leftovers for later meals. With that in mind, I'd make changes next time: boneless skinless breasts or thighs; then refrigerate cooked chicken and onions; cook juice to reduce it, then chill it; scrape the fat off once the juice cools (easier than skimming the hot fat), then add a spoonful of the chilled juice in the microwave as I heat some of the chicken for a meal. But I don't think I loved the marinade enough to use this recipe as is. The marinade was spicy, but I think I'd like it sweeter.

This was a really good recipe.  It comes out juicy and really browned and was very appealing.  My husband wowed at the presentation.  I followed it exactly and will be doing it again.  We like things spicy though.  I think it can be modified for anyone's taste though.

We've made this one many many times- it is delicious! I usually double the sauce and serve over rice.
I have adjusted a few things along the way- I reduce the black pepper to 1/4 tsp, Skip the oil (it's got enough with the skin) and add a bit more garlic. Don't skip the chipotle- it adds so much flavor!  And it really does need to marinate overnight. I cook it in a Pyrex pan for easy cleanup.
This recipe works great with bone in skin on chicken breasts as well.

Oh my goodness!!! This was so delicious! I stayed true to the recipe except for upping the onions to two based on the reviews. Everything else I kept exactly the same. This marinade is out of this world and I can't wait to use it with chicken breast and other cuts of meat. Thank you so much for this recipe. I will be making this many times over.

Wonderful recipe! Marinated thighs for 24 hours. Great flavor, thighs were tender and moist. Best of all, my husband loved the meal, and wanted me to make it again the following week!

This turned out fantastic!!  I got it marinated for almost 5 hours. I was out of red wine vinegar so I used white wine without a problem.  I almost didn't make the sauce at the end with the pan drippings, but did, and so glad that I did!  It was yummy :)  Great recipe!

I first made this for a friend and I. He went back for seconds, a rarity with my cooking. (Hmpf!) Making it a second time tonight just for myself. Just popped it in the oven a couple minutes ago and the place already smells great. I recommend this to everyone who likes a little sweet heat.

We loved this! I had to make a few minor changes because of lack of ingredients but it still turned out great. Mine didn't have enough sauce after baking to pour into a sauce pan to reduce but that could be because of my changes. I used chicken thighs, legs and wings. I omitted the vegetable oil altogether and I don't think it needs it. I will definitely make this again.

Love this recipe! Easy to make; love the flavor, and the onions were amazing. Even my husband, who generally leaves the onions for me, really enjoyed them. My toddler enjoys this also, which is a huge plus. Have made a couple of times already and will be making again this weekend!

This was so delicious,full of flavors any side dish would complete it.I used seasoned potato and broccoli.I love it because I can get it organized in the morning and at dinner bake.I cut the opinions,lined my pan with foil and made the marinade and cut the vegetable in the morning.While it cooked in the evening I made the salad and steamed the vegetable cooking the potato with the chicken.

I was looking for something different to do with chicken thighs and found this recipe. It was fantastic. My fiancé isn't a fan of Dijon mustard but said it made the dish. I was afraid it might be too spicy for me but it wasn't at all and I loved the onions. I'll definitely be making this one again.

I haven't even cleaned the dishes up and stopped to write this review. SUPERB!! I followed the recipe except I removed the skin from the chicken thighs and trimmed as much fat away as I could. We followed someone else's suggestion and cooked everything on top of the broiler pan w/a foil lined pan underneath for easier clean up. The meat was tender and very flavorful. Yes, I did marinate it overnight. The onions were wonderful and my 13 & 11 yr old boys even ate them. The house smells amazing too. Thanks Chef John!

I made this for my family and it was an instant favorite. My wife and daughter could not stop saying how delicious the chicken was the entire meal. I left out the cayenne pepper because my wife doesn't like spicey foods but after eating we think we will try again with the cayenne next time.

I rarely do chicken thighs because of the fat factor, but this recipe with that marinade is out of this world! This is my third time making this recipe and I am speechless. This recipe is the ultimate high. I substituted the dried chipotle pepper for Sriracha sauce and it was divine!

One of my favorite chicken dishes EVER! And I make chicken several times a week. The onions are AMAZING. I put as many slices onions as I can under the chicken and elsewhere around  the pan too. No such thing as too many. This recipe is so flavorful.

This dish was a huge hit with the family. I marinated the chicken overnight and my goodness, a delicious flavor throughout the chicken. I decided to cook the chicken on the grill as summer is coming to an end and there will not be many days left for the grill. However, I am looking forward to cooking this dish inside, which means I will try the onions too. Thank you for sharing we will have this one in the future for sure.

Great recipe and easy. Chill overnight for a deeper flavor. Although the recipe calls for cayanne chipotle pepper, the mustard and vinegar cut through for a blended and complex flavor.

Everyone loved it. It is amazing to find a dish you can make this cheap that tastes this good. I used bone in skin on chicken thighs from Costco. The fit for foodies people thought I should open my restaurant. I marinaded this over night. I made a double batch and the cooking time was about 40 mins. I used a meat thermometer to get the meat to 165 degrees. This was not too sweet and not too spicy, but the blend of flavors was awesome, all the way to the bone. I also doctored the sauce with some added pepper, salt, cayenne and chipotle just to taste. You could server this over pasta with enough sauce, but would have to strengthen the sauce a bit as the pasta would knock it down a bit. .

Love this recipe!(and most of Chef John's recipes that I've tried). Saved the sauce for the next day and ate it with brown rice. I marinated the chicken overnight to make sure the flavor sipped through the chicken. A little too spicy for my daughter, so I will take it easy on the cayenne pepper next time. Will do it again, definitely. I didn't change anything.

I'm rating this low mostly because the chicken was incredibly dry.  I will be trying this recipe one more time since the first time I made it with white wine vinegar instead of red.  DO NOT DO THIS!!!  Hoping these will be better if I follow the recipe and reduce cooking time.  Will re-rate once I try this again!

This is the best chicken I have ever tasted in my life. Hands down. I made it as directed, however my local grocery store did not have chipotle pepper. Didn't matter. Was outstanding anyway. Me, my husband and two picky eater little boys all cleaned their plates. This will be my go-to chicken recipe from now on.

The very best chicken thigh recipe ever!  I can always count on Chef John's recipes to delight family and friends. But most especially me! 
I didn't make any changes to the recipe. It was perfect as written. Try it.

This was just ok for us.  I followed the recipe exactly and after 40 minutes at 450, the oven started smoking so I turned it down to 375 for another 20 minutes or so (I think I almost set my oven on fire!)  It basically took almost an hour to get them done but I guess I had really big chicken thighs. I was disappointed in the lack of flavor even after I marinated the chicken for over 24 hours.  I added a bunch of seasoning to the gravy we used to drizzle over the chicken so that helped.  Thanks for the recipe but I probably won't make this again.

From the first time I tried this, everyone loved it including my picky eaters. They always look forward to it. This is now my go to chicken recipe. 
I didn't have enough Dijon mustard and so I used 1/4 cup Dijon and 1/4 cup regular mustard. Still came out great. Because I have a thing for hot food, added a little extra chilli which gave it even more kick. 
Will continue making this.

Very good flavor combo...hot, sweet, mustard. Yummy! I doubled the onions and upped the heat. Thanks!

Loved this! Followed recipe exactly as John said - love the video and his sense of humor! This is a definite keeper - mustard flavor mellows and is not over-powering! Love the onions with it - and the foil makes super easy clean up.  Didn't use such a high oven and it still cooked in same time & browned beautifully! We have this often - only thing I do different is slice up a bunch more onion and only skim the fat (if there is any) from the pan - other wise I don't bother reducing. My husband, who doesn't really like dark meat loves this recipe too and he says the guys at work are jealous of his left overs lunch!

Made these according to recipe except that I did not add all the peppers. It was delicious, very juicy and tender. Even my boyfriend who is not much of chicken thigh guy said that was the most delicious chicken I've cooked so far. I definitely recommend this recipe!

Aah Chef John you've done it again. This chicken was sooooo good. I used a whole chicken that I butterflied and marinated overnight. If you are trying to impress someone with your awesome cooking abilities, this is the perfect recipe.

These were so easy, moist and delicious. I happened to have the chipotle pepper as I use it in my rib rub and thought it was an important element in the smoky "heat" against sweet. If I didn't, I think I would have used smoked paprika and more cayenne. FYI, the sharp mustard flavor dissipates with cooking. I made the marinade in the morning, cleaned the thighs and left just a "square" of skin on the top and let them marinate all day. I toyed with grilling them but glad I tried them exactly as specified. Even the onions underneath them were a nice accompaniment. I did boil the marinade and brushed them once at the end. I'm glad I did as I didn't really have enough pan drippings and it made it easier. I might do them on the grill but think I would do them in a pan with the onions. A definite keeper! Thank you!

This recipe is a keeper!  I made it using the skinless boneless thighs and baked them for just 30 minutes. No need to boil down the sauce. It was plenty thick and delicious right out of the oven.  Thanks Chef John!

Wow this was a big hit.  I am always looking for a new way to fix chicken.  I must agree with others, more onions, they are so yummy.  My hubby says this is a keeper.

Yum, yum will make this again ! I loved this recipe, I love mustard so this was a no brainer, I made the marinade early in the morning, left it all day and cooked it tonight. I loved the onions on the bottom, the sauce cooked over them and it was a nice glaze. I didn't have any chipotle so I didn't add that, but I don't think it hurt it a bit. This is a keeper for me! Oh also, I didn't have any red wine vinegar so I used rice wine vinegar it was soooooo good!

I made this chicken dish as directed, except I took the skin off of 2 of the bone in skin on chicken thighs, 2 of us love the bone in skin off and the other 2 love it bone in skin on, for 2 of us, with the skin off, was a calorie thing, but we loved the way they turned out, will make again for company, love the spice, will use 2 onions next time, for the love of them.

This was absolutely delicious, just perfect amount of mustard + spice. I didn't even reduce the sauce, just discarded it, but the chicken was perfectly moist. I served with honey roasted potatoes and green beans, good all around!

My husband LOVED this. Said it is one of the best things I've ever made. I did not bother with the sauce, only used half the chipotle pepper and no cayenne. The flavor was amazing but not spicy - it would be fine for kids. The onions were a bonus - so delicious.

These were so tasty! Our whole family scarfed them up. Just the way we like the sauce, sticky & sweet. I did skip the chipotle though, have two little ones at home. Next time I make a batch I'll make some separate for the kids and add the spicy!

Great dish. This guy can cook. I did two pans of three each. One was amazing and one sent me into a sweat coma because I added a boat load of habanero  powder. I thought I could handle the heat and WTH. Well, hell it was and I was in it. Dont do this ever.

Chicken was amazing and will definitely make again. Onions are a fabulous addition to any meal. But with the brown sugar in the sauce, combined with the onion's natural sweetness, I may just sautee them separately next time.

I marinated it for 45 minutes but the flavor was still amazing! I only used 4 chicken thighs so I used a little less of everything in the marinade. Chicken was moist, full of flavor, and the sweet and tangy flavor came through with the vinegar. I'd add a bit more spice next time though.

Marinated this for four hours.  I don't have the patience or foresight enough to go longer!  Spicy and sweet at the same time.  Minimal mustard flavor.  On my make again list!

Wow! These are amazing! I had them marinating vacuum sealed for 2 days and then cooked them! Suuuuuper good! And the onions turned out soooo good too! I was iffy about them because onions aren't my favorite, but the Mustardy flavor was super good.

Really nice change to my usual marinades.  I made using chicken breasts on the grill.  Left out the chipotle as I didn't have any, but substituted Weber's horseradish mustard and Frank's hot sauce.  Wish I'd have made defrosted more chicken as there were no leftovers.

Great recipe! I marinated the thighs for 24 hrs, and I'm sure that's why they came out flavorful and moist. I only had boneless and skinless thighs on hand that needed to be used, so I went with those this time. Another time, I'll also add more onions because they came out SO good. At first glance, the recipe looks long and complicated. but it's not. Will definitely be repeating this one!

I really liked this. I had it marinating for two days...  it did not become overpowering, in fact quite the opposite. I should have sprinkled some seasoning on before roasting for a bit more kick.

I used wings, and a Scotch Bonnet.  I left out some of the brown sugar and added a tad of orange marmalade.  The final result was great; it was a perfect appetizer for a luau.

Used all the ingredients as written, but used skin on/bone in breasts slicing into the meat as suggested for the thighs. Refrigerated for 24 hours. So my cookie sheet wouldn't warp in the high heat, I used the bottom of my broiler pan with the foil just large enough to accommodate the chicken over 3 medium onions sliced. Poured the rest of the marinade into the bottom of the pan. The chicken had a sense of Dijon/sweet flavor. The skin was the best part. It made plenty of juice which I left as is to serve over Jasmine rice. I tasted the mustard ( in a good way ), and the sweet, but didn't taste the hot. I'll probably try it once more since overall it wasn't too bad. I'll just add more cayenne next time.

5* for the marinade and seasoning of the chicken.  Hubby & I agree however we simply don't care for baked chicken thighs - we just can't get past the amount of fat in them.  The onions scattered about the pan burnt to a crisp (and I only had to cook for 35') - which was disappointing - while the onions underneath the chicken were divine.  I also ended up with virtually no drippings (which was confusing as my thighs were nice and fatty);  again, a disappointment.  Chicken itself was moist and juicy.  If we make again, however, I think we'll simply grill the chicken and/or try it with chicken wings.  Now *that* got hubby's attention :)

Marinated the chicken thighs for 6 hours and doubled the amount of onion  - I sliced two onions into rings instead of one.  In making the sauce, I noticed that I had a little bit of 1/2 and 1/2 to use up so I added it to the reducing sauce.  Everyone liked it, my husband said "wow, this is really good!"

I used chicken drumsticks for this and marinated them for about 11 hours.  I didn't have any chipotle powder so subbed paprika instead.  We liked this recipe very much.  Slightly too sweet;  I might cut back on the brown sugar a little next time but we will definitely have these again!

I liked this, and thought the chicken was even better cold the next day. Unfortunately, hubs didn't like it at all, thus the 3 star rating. It's a fine recipe, just not for us.

This was okay. I really expected the chicken to have more flavor and to fall off the bones, but it didn't. I made it with rice and the sauce with the rice was pretty good.

The chicken thigh is my favorite cut, but I usually remove the skin before cooking - which I will do when I make this recipe again.  The marinade is not something I would normally gravitate towards, but we were pleasantly surprised by the end result.

Now in my monthly rotation, it’s that good!  And please, bone in, skin on chicken thighs only.  You will not regret it.  Agree with doubling the onion, so delicious cooking in those chicken juices.  Going to make again tonight!

this was so quick and easy and really delicious. i only had time to marinate for 45 min but the chicken came out moist with a beautifully crisped skin and packed full of flavor. i did substitute red peper flakes for the chipotle powder which i didnt have and i added about a tablespoon of honey and 1/4 cup of apricot preserves. cant wait to make this again.

Loved this recipe! The best part is the marinade/sauce. Don't skip the last step of boiling the pan drippings and leftover marinade. We served it over rice. Excellent. Will definitely make it again.

Great tasting sauce and made perfectly crispy thighs in the oven.  Don't change a thing with this recipe, unless you add a smidge of hot sauce to crank up the heat.  It is not too spicy.

Very moist and flavorful chicken. Used boneless thighs and cooked for 25 minutes.

Easy, delicious, my entire family loved it (kids 11, 13 & 15 yrs old included).  It is a bit spicy so cut out the cayenne if you don't like spicy food.  I added a sliced red pepper, on the baking sheet along with the onion, just because I had it on hand and it was yummy.  I served it with roasted potatoes and steamed broccoli.

This recipe got a high five from my kids. It's a bit too spicy for me, but anything that has no leftovers is a winner in my book! If I made this just for me, it would be easy to tone down the spice.

Due to time I didn't have the luxury of marinating so I just put the sauce on and cooked.  It was still perhaps the most delicious chicken I have ever had!

I made this as written and it was delicious.  Flavorful and juicy.  I'm usually not a fan of chicken thighs, but I'm sure using them here made a big difference.  I served this for company and got rave reviews.  It was easy to make as well. I served it with roasted tiny potatoes and the Parmesan Asparagus from this site.

Had everything except the chipotle, just substituted a small red chile pepper.  So tender and delicious!  I think the marinade made the difference.  I'm not a fan of onions, but these onions caramelized and made a fan out of me!  Served everything on a bed of brown rice.  Pure heaven!

I used bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts. These are bigger,  but I baked them for about 45 - 50 minutes as well. I really liked the flavor, even though it wasn't really "fall of the bone" quality...
might bake a little shorter next time for a juicier result.

I have made this for large groups 3 times now and every time I am asked for the recipe by several people.  It is SO delicious!  I made it twice by following the recipe exactly, putting the thighs on the barbecue to crisp the skin and then finished it off in the oven.  The 3rd time I made it I used erythritol in place of the brown sugar since I eat Keto and it was just as delicious!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

Followed recipe exactly but did let in marinate for 24 hours. I thought if the chicken could turn out tasting as good as the marinade smelled, it would be a winner...and it was. I usually don’t use bone-in skin-on chicken, or even thighs for that matter, but I’m glad I did.  It made a very enjoyable meal.

I get stuck in a rut with boneless skinless chicken breasts over & over. I followed this recipe to a tee and the crispy, slightly mustardy, sweet skin on the thighs was the highlight of my week. Okay, I may have not had the best of weeks but you get the point. This recipe is spot on!

Well, another great recipe from Chef John !!  Very tasty and this marinade really made the chicken juicy !!   Some minor adjustments though, did not have red wine vinegar so I used the apple cider vinegar,  used regular chili powder instead of the chipotle powder.  Main difference is I grilled these instead of baking them .  Really came out good !!!  The chicken was almost falling of the bone!!  Can not wait to make again !!!

Awesome. Left out the chipotle chili powder and put  crushed red pepper flakes instead. Sliced the garlic and put it in the marinade. Removed it before cooking as one family member isn’t a fan. Everyone loved it.

Greedy, I automatically DOUBLED the sauce, 1/2 for marinade and 1/2 reserved to thicken on stovetop for extra to pour over thighs.  BIG mistake.  The chipotle packed a LOT more heat sitting for 24 hours (the length of time i marinaded/stored in fridge prior to baking/thickening) than when I tasted it upon mixing together initially.  MUCH too hot.  Took away from the other flavors.  My fault.  I will make again, cook 33-35 minutes only and use ONLY what the recipe calls for with regards to the marinade.

Here's another Chef John masterpiece!  The only change I'll make in the future is to remove the skin on the thighs.  And I will perhaps add a touch more heat because this is really not spicy (unless my chipotle was a little on the older side).  Thanks, Chef!

Delicious.  Made it as described. Perfect sweet/savory flavor, with juicy tender chicken and sauce.  Anybody would love this.  For those using boneless -- you really will miss the moistness and full flavor of the bone-in recipe.  Expect dryness and less than perfect flavor if you go boneless, and don't blame Chef John :)

Great recipe. I added too much chipoltle and cayenne (more than in the recipe), better I bet with less. I baked mine on a cast-iron grill.  Good.

Very good! I used boneless and skinless chicken thighs. Instead of paprika, I sprinkled Mesquite and salt on the chicken. I then left it in for 30 minutes, turned them over and cooked another 5 minutes because the underside is so ugly. lol  The taste was good. I used a whole onion, but I didn't care for the slight onion flavor on the thighs and the onions themselves tasted just okay. Next time, I will omit the onion. I reduced the pan drippings by half and removed as much of the oil as I could. Overall, it was a nice recipe. If I remember next time, I will try to leave it over night.  I had left it for only 3 1/2 hours because I started late.

This was delicious. I made it with humanely raised thighs from Whole Foods. I was low on fresh garlic so I added a bit of garlic powder and I may have upped the brown sugar just a bit. I would use more onion rings next time because they were so good (I used a Vidalia onion).

DELICIOUS! My husband is a chef and said this was the best chicken he has ever had! Made it exactly as recipe instructed. Marinated 2 days as our dinner plans changed. Used leftovers for tacos following night and equally as delicious! You gotta try this.

I used legs/thighs since that is what I had in the freezer. The result was sweet and juicy, but not hot or spicy like I expected. It wasn't anything special so likely won't make it again. It's easy to prepare, just have to do it ahead of time. I let it marinade for 4 hours.

I have to admit, after tasting the marinade,  I was scared that the flavor would have a strong mustard flavor, but thankfully, the finished chicken was very mild. No strong mustard flavor .. I used dark brown sugar which gave it an added depth of sweetness. I DID NOT bake it at 450, but chose instead to bake it at 375 with convection. It turned out perfectly crisp and brown on top. ( Please see my photo of this chicken in my photo gallery ) The presentation was absolutely off-the-chart! My family loved this chicken, and I will surely make it again.

I did not use fresh garlic and I grilled the bone-in chicken thighs instead of baking, but even after only a 5 hour marinade, they were fantastic. The recipe called for a lot of mustard, but the mustard flavor did not overwhelm the food. Would make again, next time perhaps adding a bit more spice.

Used boneless skinless thighs and cooked for 30 minutes at the recommended temp then turned oven off and let sit for another 5 minutes. In addition to the onions added celery, carrots and jalapenos, perfect! Will revise using skin on and bone in thighs.

this is seriously my favorite main dish ever.  I make this once a week at least. my only suggestion would be to use the good mustard, the stuff that comes in the glass jar! I bake this in my cast iron pan so I can just put it on the stove to reduce the sauce.

I made this and it was really good, but I did alter the recipe which wasn't the best thing to do (since it was my fault I didn't let that impact my rating). I decided to get creative and use a mix of stone ground mustard, yellow mustard, and spicy brown mustard. This along with the dried mustard, proved to be too much mustard flavor and it overpowered everything else. Now I understand why dijon mustard was selected for this recipe, because it is cut with mayonnaise and is milder so that when it combines with the ground mustard, the flavor gets lifted, but it probably wouldn't overpower the sugar and spice. Balance was the key to this and I missed the mark, but I will be sure to follow Chef John's Recipes to a T after making this mistake :-) Oh one last thing, I didn't have a lot of time to marinade, so I halved the chicken breasts and pounded them with a mallet under saran wrap.

We loved this!  Made it as written except I used chopped, canned chipotle since I didn't have any dry chipotle.  Thought it was excellent!  Chicken was nice & juicy.  Also roasted some small red potatoes with the onions as another viewer suggested.

Because I wasn't clever enough to read the recipe ahead of time, I cooked the chicken in my Instant Pot in hopes the pressure cooking would make up for the chicken not being marinated. I put the chicken in the Instant Pot, poured the marinade over it, and mixed it around to make sure the chicken was coated. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs because Mr. Pickypants doesn't care to deal with bones or skin. Oh my goodness, this was delicious! The marinade mellows out with cooking, and is indeed both tangy and sweet. (I omitted the cayenne because we are wusses, LOL.) I will definitely make this again!

I'm giving this 4 stars for now. Most of it is my fault. I thought I had red wine vinegar (I usually do) and didn't,  so I used white wine. I only used a pinch of Cayenne pepper,  didn't have the onions, forgot to cook down the marinade, and I think I left the chicken in too long. It was still pretty good. Next time I'll follow it to a T.

the only thing I did different was to grill the thighs. I then sautéed the onions in butter then added the remaining marinade. I had no time so I only had it in the marinade for 1 hour. can't wait to try it with longer marinade.

Delicious.  Only had 1/2 of an onion, added celery and carrots so as not to let all the good marinade go to waste.  Also added potatoes around the edges per another reviewer.  Excellent one dish meal, will make again!

I have made this at least 30 times, and every time is a smash! I've not made any changes to the recipe, unless I was out of something, but it comes out of the oven delicious, $9 you could eliminate reducing the pan juices, but they address awfully good.

I really liked this! I had all the ingredients except the chipotle seasoning. I did have a chipotle blend so I used some of that and reduced the salt and used a little red pepper.
My husband didn’t have it until the next night (he fell asleep), he really liked it also! He doesn’t even like chicken! Much to my, not very happy. Recommend!

We loved it. I already made it again, this time with LOTS of onions and Mustard etc.  Marinated for 48 hrs in the fridge. Leftover sauce will be used for fried potatoes or will freeze it for the near future.

This was very easy and excellent! I had 10 minutes to prep the chicken before I had to run in the morning.. popped it in the oven later and WOW! I didn't have red wine vinegar so I just used balsamic and I didn't have chipotle so I used chili peppers and paprika. It was so tasty and not too spicy for my kids. next time I might add extra spice to the "grown up" pieces.

Very tasty.  I forgot the onions (phooey - i had several!), but otherwise followed the recipe.  My husband liked it too, and even said I could cook this recipe if I was on Chopped!  But I reminded him that, what with marinating and baking time, it would never work, LOL.  UPDATE 3/3/19: Had onions this time, and, again, made per the recipe. The onions get soft and yummy, oh my! Served with tossed salad and roasted red potatoes with butternut squash.

So good!!! I make this recipe all the time. It’s a great week day recipe especially when you have kids at home. I’ve made it following the recipe to the letter and while good, I’ve made a couple changes. Way easier to throw all the ingredients in a ziplock bag and mix everything that way. Also, I don’t do the cuts on the chicken primarily because it doesn’t make a difference if you don’t. This marinade is great because you can leave it in the fridge for two days and it tastes amazing. I also add way more garlic and Dijon mustard. Soooo good!

I followed the recipe pretty closely. My changes: used a bit of canned chipotle pepper, minced, because I didn’t have the powder. I also DID NOT marinate it for hours, only about 30 minutes. Hey, this was still really delicious. What a wonderful combination of flavors! Since I scraped away much of the excess fat (but left the skin) from the thighs, there wasn’t much in juices after roasting. The onions soaked it up and saved me from having to cook down the drippings. I just served up the chicken with those onions on the side. Wow! Be sure to use plenty of onions!

Made as written.  It is a delicious hearty meal that satisfied everyon in the house.  The gravy over the  chicken, smothered onions and rice (we served with rice) was one of the best I have made from this site.  I will continue to make it although I just double the recipe as I am making for 6 and three of those wanted at least 2 chicken thighs -- I wasn't sure about the recipe so I only made one per person.  Make it tonight -- you won't be sorry!

Used a glass Pyrex dish sprayed with cooking spray. Doubled the onions. Substituted honey for brown sugar, balsamic vinegar for red wine vinegar and garlic powder for minced garlic.  Left out the dry mustard. Marinated for 6 hours. Baked 6 large thighs at 450 F for 40 mins. Superb recipe! Highly recommended.

Made this, doubling the sauce, used 12 thighs instead of 8, and didn't feel the need to brush the thighs with oil before putting in the oven. Other than that I made it exactly as written  and my family Raved! We ate the leftover gravy on potatoes or rice for the next 2 days--they loved it so much! It was Very easy to put together so it's a win-win.

This was absolutely delicious.  I was a little skeptical, but both my husband and I loved it.  My husband created a scrumptious  sauce after separating the fat.  This one is a keeper!

What a yummy chicken recipe!  It comes together easily.  I marinated over night.  Threw it in the oven for 45 minutes and wow'ed the family with the results.  It went really well with rice pilaf.

I love chicken thighs and this has become one of my favorite chicken thigh recipes.  It is the perfect combination of spicy and sweet.  The skin comes out nice and crispy.  I sometimes  use sliced fennel instead of onion rings and it comes out amazing.  The onions are good also and sometimes I do a combination of slides onions and sliced fennel.  They come out roasted and soft and the flavor is phenomenal.  Another hit recipe by Chef John.

Update: I’ve made this twice more, following the recipe to a T. Just the absolute best chicken dinner ever. Need to figure out how to keep the onions from burning in the corners of the pan tho. Original review: Winner, winner, chicken dinner (seems like something chef John would say). New favorite, 10 stars! I did screw up however. When I measured out my dijon mustard, I found I only had a 1/4 cup. Ug! So I used a 1/4 cup of spicy brown mustard and I did taste it in the finished product. I also took the tip from other reviews and sliced up 2 onions, which I highly recommend since they were so delicious. Can’t wait to make again with all dijon.

I admit it. I was cautious with the mustard. I already know that Chef John has this infatuation with Dijon mustard that surpasses most people's appreciation for it, so I deliberatly went light on it, but I probably shouldn't have. It would have benefited from a little extra zing. I'm not taking points off for that, though, since I should have listened. I'm deducting points since the cooking time was way too short. I've calibrated my oven with an oven thermometer, and at 30 minutes, my chicken was still plenty pink. It took another 10 minutes in the oven for the thermometer to register 160 degrees. After standing for 10 minutes, they were safe to eat, but nowhere near  separating from the bone.  So the chicken was tasty, but still a lot chewier than  I like. I'll definitely do this one again, but I'm going to drop the temperature down to 425 degrees and check the temperature at 45 minutes. If it isn't 165 degrees internal temperature, it goes back in the oven until it is. These are chicken thighs we're talking about! They aren't going to dry out if the final internal temperature after resting is 170 degrees.

Amazing flavour! Allow to marinade for 2 days and it comes out amazing!. Will make sandwiches with leftover chicken. Also good with a salad or mashed potatoes. Thank you for a amazing recipe Chef John. This will be a family staple at dinner time.

*Really* tasty way to prepare thighs. Made as directed using boneless, skinless and cooked shorter time, about a half hour. The sauce you thicken at the end really sells the dish, and the vinegar gives it a nice tang. Made it with Raye's Dundicott Hott mustard (which is similar to Dijon but also a bit spicy) and it was fantastic. Going to make again with bone in as directed. Highly recommended.

It’s really quite good. Not good are Chef John’s disgusting sexual innuendos (e.g.,”I like sweet and hot in any context,” “high and perky” referring to the meat and others). In this social climate, he should be given some sensitivity training or lose his job!

I didn't have any ground mustard powder, but it still turned out great. Don't skip the last step (reducing the pan drippings for the sauce - it was fantastic).

Didn't have dried mustard or chipolte (in Costa Rica) so substituted 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.  I forgot the onions, but no matter.  I wasn't able to get just thighs so cut apart legs & thighs.  Everyone loved it.  Will make again.

Delicious!  I am admittedly terrible at cooking chicken. This turned out amazing. I didn’t have chipotle at home so I omitted that one ingredient. I only had 4 thighs so made this in my cast iron skillet. I definitely will make this again!

Absolutely delicious.....  I forgot all about needing to marinate them ahead of time and they were still amazing! I don't know how Chef John does it but wow! I put baked potatoes on the tray too and it worked very well.  Next time I will definitely marinate and do more onions!

I added 1/8 cup of honey to the mixture and marinated overnight.  Next time I will pull off the skin as we all found the skin rather slimy.  The taste was delicious and I cooked it for 40 minutes.

We loved, loved, loved this recipe, which might easily be the tastiest we have tried on this site. Served it with Chef John's Rice-Ah-Roni - also delicious. The only real change I made was to add extra garlic to the baking pan, as I couldn't remember if I had added it to the marinade. WOW - daughter says I can make it every other day. I wasn't sure if the marinade should be poured over the chicken before baking, but I was glad I did - the sauce was  amazing. My daughter literally licked the plate (after her second helping). Thanks Chef John. Our next effort will be the Monte Carlo Benedict, which looks equally delicious!

Love this recipe!  I didn’t have thighs so used chicken drummies  and it turned out perfectly.  I will definitely make this often but will use thighs as suggested and it will be even better.

Followed the recioe exactly. Not what I was expecting with the flavor and consistency, but still tasty. 
Also, very soft and mushy for me.

Absolutely fantastic! I did not modify the recipe, and It came out famously. I was truly impressed with how well the skin crisped up with the vegetable oil spray, so crispy I would have swore they were deep fried. The chicken was incredibly moist and the flavor from the marinade was out of this world. I served this up with Chef John’s Farro and Wild Mushroom recipe. There were no leftovers.

Vacuum sealed the thighs with marinade for about 30 hours (because I forgot about them). Did a couple of the thighs with the skin removed (wife’s request). Flavor was great and the meat was quite juicy. Will definitely make this one again because it was so easy.

Just WOW! This recipe is easy, inexpensive and super flavorful. I couldn't believe how yummy this was. I never deviate from Chef John's recipes but this time I found myself without red wine vinegar so I used Paul Newman's Balsamic lite salad dressing. It totally worked! Chef John, I just love you.

Made this last week and my husband loved it - told me not to lose this one in my stack of recipes.  I did use more onions on the bottom because I love them and had quite a few on hand.  This recipe is delicious!  Love Chef John!

The mustard taste was too much. I had first baked it and it was so greasy, my family didn't like it.  I grilled the leftovers the next day, and then it was much better.

Made it for the family. I marinated at night and let is sit overnight to make the following night. I actually let it sit for two days because my husband surprised us with takeout dinner the next day. Everyone loved it. I left out the chipotle be I don't do spicy. LOL!!! Made mashed potatoes and veggies. Great dinner. Easy prep I will def do it again. This is something my daughter can prep while I get the current meal going.

Delicious. Wife and I thought it was wonderful. So good that I have shared with my cooking loving friends. Fantastic! Highly recommend. The marinading element is very important. At least 4 hours. Eight is preferred.

This recipe was so easy and so delicious.  If you follow Chef John's directions, your dish will turn out just as pretty as his on this video.  
Pair with steamed squash and mashed potatoes or a just a simple salad.  So good!

Doesn't need any change. Fast and easy. You can prepare it the day before in less then 10 minutes.  I made it and was a success on first attemp. It is perfect when you want to cook chicken and have a different and delicious test taste.

Instead of using Dijon mustard I used Sam's Choice Smokey Sweet onion mustard, because I didn't have any Dijon on hand.  Used paprika in place of chipotle and added a little bit of corn starch and little more salt (kosher) to chicken dropping mixture while boiling. Had a good gravy after adding corn starch but made mistake of letting boil to long and corn starch begin to lump. To get rid of lumps in mixture, after I spooned over chicken thighs place back in oven for 5 min. Family LOOOVED this recipe sooo much! Even my picky 4 year old who isn't a big meat eater asked for THIRDS!!! If you make this there will be no leftovers.

This is another Chef John keeper! I used a little honey garlic mustard with my Dijon but otherwise I stick to the recipe and it was fantastic. I poured off the fat of the drippings and started to reduce the broth when I decided to make a gravy. It was amazing. Began with the fat, added the flour, chicken broth and a  bit of sherry.  As Chef John might say, you're the Dali of your drippings.

My husband and I really liked this, especially the onions. I used sweet onions. Only thing I did differently was omit the dry mustard and chipotle as didn't have any on hand. I only marinated 4 hours as didn't have time. Next time will marinate longer. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious!  Mustard flavor was very delicate.  Had to use chili powder instead of chipotle.  Ended up marinating for 36 hours because it was just to hot to turn on the oven. Sprayed foil with Pam.  Sprinkled with seasoning salt and a touch of cayenne prior to  baking.  Baked at 375 degrees for 1 hour and was done (checked with thermometer).  Removed onions and chicken and drained juices.  Put chicken back in for 15 minutes to crisp up a bit.  Used 5 pounds of chicken leg quarters which gave me 5 thighs and 5 drumsticks.  Wonderful recipe--very juicy.  Can't wait to make again using chipotle.  Had some concerns about the high heat but may try baking at 425 degrees next time.  Update:  Used apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and thought the flavor was much better; the red wine just didn't seem a good fit for me.  I also skipped the onion; used a foil lined baking tray with a cooling rack placed inside for a baking rack.  Rack was slightly larger than pan so it laid on a slant in the pan, but it still worked to elevate the chicken.  Sprayed well with cooking spray before adding the chicken and it came out crispy and delicious.  Cleanup was a snap.

This recipe is AMAZING. Best chicken thighs I've ever had. I've made it exactly as it says and it comes out perfect.

I've also made using the spicy yellow mustard (just the french's stuff) and then leaving out the cayenne. I actually prefer it that way, it's nice and spicy and a little sweet. 

As others said, use two onions. I could easily eat one onion to myself from this, they are so unbelievably delicious. I've made this once a week now for a while, that's how much I love it!

These were so good. I marinated them overnight and they had so much flavor in them. I baked mine a little too long because some of the onions and sauce burned. I think 35 minutes would have been enough. I wouldn't change anything at all in this recipe. I will  be making this again for sure.

Made this last night for dinner because I had everything in the house to make it.  I let it marinate for 5hr. or so and it turned out wonderful.  Next time it's for over night  and then grill outside.  Thanks.

I ended up having to use brown deli mustard because I ran out of dijon, but this was delicious!  Made it with lots of onions and didn't really waiver much from the recipe.  Will definitely make again! :)

This chicken is the bomb! I used 3 skinless boneless thighs and reduced marinade to 1/4. Since I had s/b thighs, I altered the cooking: thickly sliced BIG onion and 2 small potatoes quartered went in bottom of casserole with EVOO, S&P , tossed and baked covered at 400 for 15 mins. Put thighs and marinade on top covered for 30 mins, uncovered and cooked 10 mins. more.  The baking method I got from a previous poster and it was right on! I'm drooling just thinking about it.

Delicious! I used an extra onion based on others comments, which was a great tip. Also, cooking the thighs at 450 temp  produced great results. Will do that will all chicken thigh dishes. Really tasty overall, will absolutely make it again.

Made as directed except substituted Mrs. Dash Chipotle seasoning for the ground Chipotle (did not have on hand).  It was just OK though.  But that's probably my fault for substituting the chipotle.  Also discovered my husband does not care for Dijon mustard.  Next time will use spicy brown mustard in deference to him and won't sub the chipotle.  I thought it had lots of flavor.  Oh,  I did cover when baking for around 35 minutes, then uncover and bake at 450 for about 5 minutes or until golden brown.

Spicy hot with a touch of sweetness - reminded me of hot buffalo wings but moister, and more plentiful meat.  I didn't have the ground dried chipotle pepper so used ground Cayenne red pepper instead, which worked out fine.  I marinated it ~ 16 hrs, so may have been spicier than intended, but I liked it.  I will be using this recipe again!       3/31/17

I followed the recipe exactly and it is wonderful. My wife loves both the mustards in this recipe. The thighs came out moist and the spices were just the right amount of heat. I will definately be making this again! Served it with just a bed of rice with peas. Awesome!

This was my first time using a recipe from Chef John, but it definitely won't be the last! I accidentally left out the cayenne pepper so it may have come out a little less spicy then it was supposed too, but it was still incredibly delicious. I marinated the thighs for around 12 hours and the result was very moist and flavorful chicken.  The onions were amazing too.10/10!

Made this chicken for my family for dinner. I used a combination of boneless chicken thighs and bone in thighs. I also do not keep the skin on my chicken. I did, however, cut slits in the chicken so that the marinade would get inside. I started the chicken out at 450 degrees for the first 20 minutes but then I cut it back to 350 degrees since I had a side dish that I was making along with it. They turned out perfect and my family has requested that I make this again anytime.

I'm sure I will make chicken thighs other ways in the future, but it's hard to think of any reason to. Very tasty marinade. I wish my children hadn't liked it so I could have theirs!

fantastic recipe....don't  mess with anything ( except triple the onions, chop them in half and separate layers).   i like to add a little extra heat - 1 t cayenne pepper.
B sure to use high-quality stone ground mustard: it does make a difference.   will work with skinless thighs also,  just not quite as juicy

I marinated for only a few hours and it was still wonderful. Served with instant risotto (mushroom flavor) and broccoli. The kids and adults loved it! I made a lot "extra" so I wouldn't have to cook dinner the next night but there was almost none left! Definitely making this again.

Made this tonight for the family, my husband wasn't too excited at the idea of a new recipe but I tried this out anyway. I'm so glad I did. My finicky 8 year old ate all the meat on her plate which rarely happens, usually I have to tell her to eat the meat before she can have more sides but not tonight. My 13 year old enjoyed the drippings and onion over her rice along with the flavor of the chicken. My husband, my biggest critic, well he could barely tell me how good it was between bites. He happily agreed to add this one to the dinner rotation, which is a good thing because tomorrow night is leftovers!

Oh my god, so good! I guess that's what I get for following a recipe shared by a chef. I was lacking a few items (onions, garlic, red wine vinegar) but the culmination of the other ingredients is still heavenly.

Some differences:  
-I saved a couple of tablespoons of the marinade (pre marinading the chicken of course!) for the pan sauce, and I liked that. 
-I dropped my oven to 425 degrees and did 35 min because my oven tends to run hot. 

I dislike dried chicken and usually just ignore it and go for red meat, but chicken thighs are going to change the way I eat! Super moist. Super Tasty. Thanks Chef John!

I love all of Chef John's recipes and have tried many of his creations. This is one of my favorites. I never enjoyed chicken thighs before these. I have made them several times and often recommend the recipe to others. They are exceptional. I would highly recommend this recipe.

So good!  I used both thighs and breasts because hubby only likes chicken breasts.  I'm just glad that the chicken breasts came out moists as well due to the sauce.  I always double up on the sauce when I make anything with chicken breasts.  Of course the thighs came out great.

I didn't add anywhere near the hot peppers... wife still said too hot... she kills me. Lol I marinated over night. I baked a total of 30 minutes... I included carrots... 15 minutes into cooking I added some green beans. Super good meal! Another signature dish! Lol I might add more sauce as I really didn't have enough to pour into a sauce pan and reduce.

My family requests this at least twice a month (which says a lot). I decreased the Chipotle  powder to 1/4 tsp (Fam can't handle too much heat) and replaced it with a 1/4 tsp smoked paprika.  It's a wonderful meal.  Love Chef John been a fan of his for many years.

I'll be making this again and again! I added another onion and a couple peeled and cubed sweet potatoes to the pan as. The 45 minute cooking time was a bit long for roasting sweet potatoes, but they were still delicious and complimented the dish well!  Didn't have any pan drippings, which I'm assuming was from the sweet potatoes soaking up the juices, but they weren't really needed i.m.o.

This is such an easy recipe and SO delicious! I've had equal success with both thighs and breasts. I do add 1/4 cup of honey to the marinade, as well as double the spices for extra kick. I'm so lazy and ill-prepared when it comes to last minute meals, I often only marinade for 20 minutes and it's still incredible!  I cook mine in a shallow baking dish and pour the rest of the marinade in with it, and usually spoon it over the chicken halfway through cooking to really build up the flavor. This has been a hit with friends and family and I keep coming back to it for more!

Delicious! A keeper. Thighs fell off the bone. I cooked for about 35 min - so moist. Use  2-3 large onions if you like onions- yummy and carmelized. You could cut back on the sugar a bit and it wouldn't sacrifice at all. Didn't use chipotle because I didn't have. I made 10 thighs and my husband ate 5!! Be sure to cover baking sheet entirely with foil, otherwise the caramelization is a bit difficult to get off. Use a glass dish?

These were fantastic! Made it exactly according to the recipe. My husband and I have always been chicken breast people, but I decided to go ahead and give this a try. We are now chicken thigh people, and especially THESE chicken thigh people! Will definitely make these again.

The chicken turned out much better than I expected!  It was delicious!  The only thing I did different is I ran 3 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce through my mini food processor because I didn't have chipotle powder.  I also baked it in a baking pan instead of sheet on top of 2 thinly sliced onions instead of one.  I used boneless, skinless thighs so I lowered the cooking temp to 400 and it took about 25 minutes to get done.   I was also lazy and didn't boil down the drippings for a sauce.  I just spooned the juice over the chicken one last time and served. So full of flavor!  Yum!

Scrumptious! I mostly followed this recipe (much more than I normally follow recipes), but needed a little extra marinade because my chicken pieces were big, so I added a little red wine. I cooked it for 35 minutes, but I think it could have gone another 5 minutes and still be perfect.

My guests expressed surprise when they found out it was the first time cooking the recipe. I used all fresh ingredients, but substituted local honey in place of brown sugar and Zatarain's Creole Mustard in place of dijon. Served over Thai Jasmine Rice.
It came out fantastic and I have a pork tenderloin I am going to try same marinade on.
Only warning is that I had very little juices left with which to make a reduction....they mostly cooked off in the oven.

I only had white wine vinegar, which changed the colour of the finished chicken, but otherwise made to the recipe.   Marinated for 24 hours.  My-oh-my the aroma during cooking was soooooo yummy that DH kept asking when dinner would be done.   Very good, easy to make, sauce is so tasty, chicken tender and moist.   Adding to my rotation for guests: make it up the night before, little to do the night of the dinner except cook it and enjoy it.  Not mustardy at all.

Delicious! I took the advice from other reviews and used 2 onions. I also had to use smoked paprika in place of ground chipotle pepper because my grocery store was sold out. Next time I will definitely use it, we love heat!! Boyfriend and I both went back for seconds and are now laid up on the couch about to pop!

We love this recipe!! I used bothe thighs and breasts and prefer the breasts myself. I used bone in breats and I cut them in half through the bone so they would be about the same size as the thighs. Marinated over night and ued grey Poupon mustard. not too spicy so even the kids coould eat it. I made with 2 onions the second time becaue we love the onions with it. Placed the onions all sirectly under the chicken and turned out perefect.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  Made it exactly as written with just a bit more cayenne pepper.  (We like things hot!)  Very easy to make.  I did let it marinate overnight.  Maybe that's why the flavors came together so perfectly.  Will be making this many more times.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This dish has so much flavor.  I didn't have chipotle, so I used chili powder instead.  Aside from that deviation, I followed the recipe as written.  Excellent! Will definitely add this to the chicken rotation.

Love this recipe!  Didn't have chipotle, so upped the cayenne a bit.  Used fresh chicken thighs, added the marinade and froze it all in a ziplock bag.  Nice to pull out for a ready made main dish.  Also great when barbecued!

Excellent recipe!!!  The Dijon Mustard gives this chicken such a unique flavor, it is so delicious.  It does not taste like mustard at all.   The brown sugar kind of balances the flavor.  It's worth making, my family loved it!

It's 95 degrees outside so I chose to grill outside on a double-foiled pan.  When the remote thermometer read 160, I took it off and funneled the juice to a waiting pan.  I really wanted a crispy skin, so I broiled it inside for 2 minutes while inside making the gravy.  I will make this again and again and I've already sent pictures to friends who have signed up!  I think the left overs will be AMAZING in tomorrow's salad.

I made this last night, using a mixture of thighs and drumsticks.  I put everything in a glass baking dish and covered with foil for 30 minutes, then continued cooking uncovered for an additional 30 minutes.  Flavor was excellent, even though I only had time to marinate chicken for about 2-3 hours.  Cooked to perfection, and enjoyed by all!

Followed this recipe exactly and it was perfectly delicious, one of the best recipes I have made  for chicken in a long easy too. I served it with crisp stir fried snow peas, carrots and garlic from my garden along with wild rice.  So GOOD!!!

This is so good and preparation is very easy. The only chopping required is for onion and garlic. The rest of the marinade comes out of bottles and herb jars. Next time, I double amount of onions and reduce slightly the brown sugar used. This is a permanent addition to my recipe box.

Made these to carry as my lunch at work for the week.  I think my only departure from the recipe was to use a coarse-grain Dijon. They were very tasty. The ingredients combine well, with no one flavor dominating. I poured off the residual "juices" and (after cooling and removing the fat) will probably use them to flavor a pot of rice.

Oh ... one departure, I found I had no ground chipotle, so omitted it form the marinade (which, for me, was more a paste than a liquid) but .. after a quick run to the grocery ... was able to liberally sprinkle the thighs with chipotle before they went into the oven. By the way, I was fearful the high-temperature roast would make for a smoky kitchen ... but that didn't happen.

My husband loved it! it's another keeper!  The onion rings baking with the chicken made it more flavorful. But next time I'll do two onions instead of one. Great recipe.

So good and easy to substitute what you have for what you don't.... Including marinade time!  So, I have chicken thighs, but what do I do? And, I'm short on prep time... Hmm, this recipe looks good, but I don't have chipotle or fresh garlic and onion. And oops, no Dijon mustard.... Well, let's see what happens... I've got minced onions, minced garlic, chili powder.... Check... Replace Dijon mustard with mayo and a bit of yellow mustard.... Whip it up.... Cut "x" into the top of the thighs, and spoon in mixture, and drizzle the remainder on top! Bake in my monster cast iron skillet. 400* for 40 minutes.... 4 minutes on broil... And BAM! We've got dinner... So moist, so tasty, and so forgiving! See, it doesn't matter if you don't have time to marinate or if you need to "go with what you've got" in the pantry! I'm a rock star and my husband thinks I can cook! ?? ... All thanks to a great recipe!??

I made this exactly as written, and my family loved it! It has a great balance of tang, saltiness, sweetness and heat. I've made it several times now and everyone raves about this recipe. I marinate the chicken overnight and place each chicken on its own ring of onions (oh I guess I use a bit more onion to support the chicken off the cookie sheet so it isn't sitting in the juices which produces sogginess). The extra onions are gobbled up too because they cook in all the flavoring. You have to try this recipe once! You won't be sorry!

This recipe is so good and SO easy! A great weeknight dish because it can be put together the night before and then put in the oven after work. I didn't have any dry mustard, but it was fine without.

Easy and delicious. I more than doubled the onions and baked it in a Corningware dish so I could reduce the sauce in the same dish. I served it with grilled asparagus and I added toasted cashews to Sarah's Rice Pilaf from this site. Great meal.

DELICIOUS! And so easy to make. The only thing is you have to marinate it overnight for best results, but overall preparation and cooking is a breeze, and the results are AMAZING! The perfect blend of sweet and spicy, it is truly finger licking good. You don't really taste the mustard, or the Cayenne pepper, but together they make a delicious team!

Oh so good! Even the onions were delicious. I used bone in chicken thighs and legs combo as I had them on hand. One of the best recipes for this type of meal. Served with Lemon Rice with Peas recipe by ReaLemon on this site. Will make again!

I made a few changes but was absolutely delish!  I used boneless/skinless thighs, no sugar (we don't add sugar to anything), no chipotle spice (didn't have it) so added chili pepper, and apple cider vinegar in place of red wine vinegar (since it's healthier).  I didn't have mustard spice, but used a stone ground mustard.  Baked at 400 for about 30 minutes, and it was a huge hit

Made it with boneless-skinless and was positively delicious.
Reduced the temp by about 50 degrees and covered the baking dish with foil for the first 20-25 minutes. Basted and uncovered for the remaining cooking time.

I thought this recipe was delicious- the only change I made was instead of ground chipotle & cayenne I used ground red pepper as that's what I had on hand. The onions are a fantastic addition too. My husband thought the marinade was too sweet so when I make again I will cut back a bit on the sugar, but I personally found the recipe to be well-balanced as written.

This is an awesome recipe! Very easy to make and loaded with flavor.  I made as written since Chef John knows what he's  doing.  Between the slight Dijon flavor and the  sweetness of the brown sugar,  the chicken thighs are wonderfully tasty, tender and terrific! And don't skip over the last step with the pan drippings. This really makes the dish! !

Can't go wrong with a Chef John recipe. Cooked this tonight as a "cooking together" date night. Girlfriend loved it. We skipped the pan drippings and enjoyed it as is.

I basically followed the recipe up to making the sauce. I was a  bit in a time crunch so skipped that step and enjoyed the chicken, I will make this again and add the sauce, 
This was a breakthrough for me as I hav always been a chicken breast person so now I realize that thigh meat is tasty and will try other recipes using the thigh .

This, like all Chef John recipes, was delicious!  I only had boneless skinless chicken breasts but they came out very moist and flavorful.  I baked it in a baking dish which made getting the extra sauce into a pan a bit easier than a baking sheet.  Don't skip the pan sauce step - that's the best part!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE the flavor in this marinade. Even though i used boneless skinless thighs and i fried them in a pan till done....they were divine! Be careful though...yu may want to lightly rinse them before you fry them. The sugars will char the meat. Then yu can put the reduced sauce over them. The longer the marinate in the fridge the better! I added one tsp of my fave BBQ sauce..."Kinders Organic Mild BBQ Sauce" from Costco. I will keep the addition but will bake next time and buy them with bone in...skin on! This recipe will not dissapoint!

This is by far the best chicken I've ever had! The balance of sweet and hot is perfect! Made it without the garlic, not for preference, I simply forgot to :P but it was still amazing without it. Even my dad, who doesn't like chicken went for a second piece. This is a keeper for sure!

This is super easy and delicious. Sugar is completely unnecessary - I leave it out when I make this and it turns out  completely scrumptious. There are never any leftovers with this one.

This was very tasty and very easy.  I marinated only about 3 hours and the flavor was still there.  I did not have Chipotle so I used Ancho chili and it was fine. Other than that,  no changes.   Everyone is right,  the onions are delicious and I did make extra!  This recipe is saved in my Allrecipes box,  as I would make this again! UPDATE: Made this again using chicken AND pork chops.  Uh mazing! I meant to mention,  I use about 1 T of Chinese hot mustard in the marinade, and SWEET ONIONS...  Makes it so delicious.  This marinade is easy enough that is worth making from scratch.  Only marinated for about 2h. Scored the cops as well.  Delish,  delish,  DEE LISH!

This was really good. Followed recipe exactly. Was a little fatty, but the flavor was great! Will definitely make again but either use boneless, skinless thighs or breasts.

I'm not big on mustard & thought that came through strong. Also, I like things that look done, not pale. The title says "sweet", which I didn't taste a sweetness to it.  If you like mustard, you'll like this. It is very interesting & has flavor, little spicy even. I was willing to try with less dry mustard since I thought that might be the culprit, but hubby didn't want to try again. We did marinate overnight but used chicken breasts without bone or skin on so maybe that makes a difference in how things come out.

Made no changes and it was exceptional.  Not dry, not too spicy, not overwhelming and a great chicken for a weeknight with some orzo and veg.   Now, instead of passing the sauce, I make a batch of orzo or rice and toss the onions and sauce with the pasta and lay the chicken on top.  Yum city.

Loved the extra flavor that scoring the thighs added as well as the extra crispy skin from cooking at a high temperature.  This recipe is a keeper!

Easy enough to make, but it tasted somewhat bland to me and the mustard flavor was a bit overpowering.  I marinated it for over 24 hours.  The onions didn't cook all the way through and were, at best, "interesting."  Cooked for 50 minutes.  Probably won't make again, but it seems to be tasty to others.

This was a hit with the crowd ... Delicious!!! I would use honey (sweet) mustard with heat (I live in Canada and used the PC Brand Sweet with Heat) and will certainly slice another whole onion (Vidalia or other sweet) as one was not enough.  I also marinated the chicken thighs 48 hrs (not intentionally; it just worked out that way).  Will be making again for sure!!!

Made for dinner last night and it was delicious! I didn't have cayenne or chipotle so I did a sprinkle of ground chilli powder and 1/2 tsp of smoked paprika. My family loved it. It had a great taste. I served it with steamed brocolli and a packet of uncle Ben's special rice. Delicious. Thanks Chef John.

My DH is diabetic, so I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and a brown sugar substitute. I only had 4 hours to marinate. Everyone loved this recipe and asked that it be put into the rotation. Thanks for a great recipe (and easy!)

This was outstanding.  FULL of flavor!  The mustard was a little strong the first night, but the left-overs the next night were heaven.  Next time I will cook it a night in advance and let it rest overnight.  Serve over white rice with spinach.  Don't use extra Dijon and do marinate overnight.  Do use extra onions and cover for first 15 minutes of cooking.

Made this tonight for dinner; big hit even with picky 3 and 6 year olds! Did not have red wine vinegar so used apple cider vinegar instead; also used as glaze instead of marinating. Did not use chipotle peppers either, my little ones do not like any heat. A pinch of cayenne with the pepper was a good balance.  So good :)

Although I didn't marinate it overnight or even for a few hours, I coated the thighs with all of the marinade and baked them as is for 45 minutes.  Great taste, and will make again.

Will Definitely make this again!  I followed the marinade exactly (used 2 chicken breasts, 4 thighs and 4 legs) and placed in the refrigerator over night.  The next day I put it in the Crockpot on low for 10 hours.  Added 2 onions on top of the chicken about 6 hours into the cooking process.  Typically I follow Chef Johns Recipes to the tee...b/c his meals are so phenomenal and I don't want to ruin a good thing; but I needed the oven for many other sides.  So I thought I'd try it in the crockpot and it turned out Fabulous!

Yummy.  Made it exactly as recipe called.  Only suggestion:  use more onion as they ate delicious in their own right and merit more of a taste than just as a garnish.  Since alloven are different and thighs vary in size, do keep watch in last few minutes so that chicken skin isn't beginning to dry out under the high heat (mine would have burned in 5 more minutes so I took it out a bit earlier.)

I made this exactly like it is written, we thought it was great. I'm going to make this again this week, but this time I'm going barbecue it on the grill and see how that works. I don't care if it splashes inside the grill.

I've made this a couple of times and am just now rating it...4.5 stars.  We did enjoy the spiciness and I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs.  A keeper!

Made this tonight, so easy! Followed recipe exactly except that I didn't spray the oil on top in the last step before putting in the oven, and I didn't salt. I also omitted cooking the sauce to put on top 'cause I ran out of time. Still came out delicious and cooked in exactly 45 min. I added extra onions under the chicken. So good! The whole family loved it! Thanks CJ! Great recipe and I will definitely make again.

I made it just the way the recipe called for.  I allowed the chicken to marinade overnight.  It was delicious - even my 7 year old and 16 year old, who are very picky about their chicken, really enjoyed this.  I did skip the sauce step.  I didn't feel like it needed any sauce.  It was tender and very flavorful without it.

I have yet to encounter a Chef John recipe that wasn't great. To the people with boneless/skinless saying it came out dry, if you watch the vid he did say you need to adjust times if not using bone in.

I made this recipe last week and I have to tell  you it was excellent.  I did not change one thing.  So simple, and not all wanted the thighs so I threw in some chicken breasts.  I marinated everything about 6 hours then followed the recipe.  I served this with roasted carrots and squash.  This was all comfort food, and something that will be on my make again soon recipes.   Thank you Chef John as your recipes are the best.

I followed the recipe pretty much, except for three things. I used 4 bone in, skin on chicken breasts (just cut more slats).  I found a McCormick spice (Southwest) that had both chipotle pepper and paprika in it, along with a few other spices, so used that instead of those spices separately.   I skipped the bowl and combined all the ingredients right into the heavyweight plastic bag. It was much easier to mix with much less mess. I then added the chicken and let marinate overnight. Came out great! Even my finicky 20-year-old daughter cleaned the bone! The dog was not happy…

Did not care for the flavor or I should say lack of flavor especially after overnight marinating.  I was surprised because of all the positive reviews.

I really, really wanted to love this ... especially after waiting patiently for 24 hours as the chicken marinated, and using an extra onion as other reviews suggested, but it simply wasn't a hit with the family. My oven runs hot, so I immediately knew both the time and temp listed in the recipe would be too long and hot (I used boneless/skinless), so I decided on 45 minutes at 375, which still resulted in rather dry chicken.  The marinade (which I did exactly according to the recipe) didn't impart the flavor profile I was hoping for either based on the ingredients, which was disappointing. Overall, I found this to be a lackluster recipe, especially for one so highly rated.

Made this tonight for dinner and we enjoyed it very much. Moist chicken, wonderful onions. Easy to prepare which makes it even better. I marinated the thighs 4 1/2 hours which really did not penetrate the chicken, but the skin was very crisp and tasty. I did not put the sauce over chicken because when we eat the skin we like it crispy, not soft and mushy.

My husband loved the smell of this cooking in  the kitchen, and his favorite was the crispy skin. He raved about it for days. Making it again tonight. I made additional cuts to the meat to get more of the flavor into the chicken, as I only marinated for 4-5 hours.

This was delicious!  I would serve this to guests with wild rice and a vegetable on the side.  I  made it as written except for using boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  If I make it again, I will use the bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and do them on the grill.   This one is a keeper!

Great flavor!  I thought the oven temp. was a little high as the skin started to burn in 20 minutes.  Next time I will set oven at 400 degrees.

Just made this for dinner last night.  I did everything like the recipe said, except I cooked it right after I rolled the chicken in the marinade.  I cooked them for the whole 45 minutes.  The thighs had so much flavor and were very moist.  Everyone loved them!

This is one of my favorite recipes! I don't change anything except putting an ungodly amount of onions under the chicken to soak up all the juices. Also, I once marinated it for 2 days and it's even better!

This is a big hit with the family. the flavors are great with that slight spicy sweet savory taste. I made a couple of substitutions I was out red wine vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar I didn't have the chipotle seasoning so I added more cayenne pepper and I sprinkled a little of brown sugar on top to have that caramelized sweetness on the chickens skin.

We didn't make any changes to the recipe, except that we made it with boneless chicken breast and it came out wonderful. Easy and so yummy!

Oh my this is good!  I made it exactly as written except I didn't have time to marinate--I just poured the sauce over the chicken and baked.  I can't imagine how good it will be next time I make it and actually marinate it!

Out-of-the-park home run!  I didn't boil the pan drippings. Just used it as is. I forgot to brush with oil. It didn't matter one bit! The skin was gorgeous and crispy! I'm sorry I didn't take a picture. It really looked perfect!! Fabulous dish! This is the only skin on meat that I ever eat.  Triple those onions. They are fantastic!!

Delicious and easy. Use boneless skinless thighs, added about 2Tbsp sherry.  I stab the chicken with forks to expedite the marinade time, 3 hours.  Loved it and will make again.

Amazing as a grill marinade. I substituted agave syrup for the brow surgar and marinated 6 hours. I then prepared a grill for high heat offset and grilled over heat for 5 minutes each side, then moved chicken to area of grill without heat. I let roast for 30 minutes and everything came out crispy and perfectly moist. This will become my go to chicken thigh/leg recipe

Delicious recipe! My husband LOVED it! I made it almost exactly as described with these changes: 1. I used honey for brown sugar 2. I used Trader Joes spicy brown mustard AND Trader Joes sweet and hot mustard for Dijon mustard 3. I omitted the dry mustard and halved the salt and pepper. 4. I made the recipe with half the chicken (7thighs) but made twice the marinade (half of it went on the chicken to marinate (not a long time maybe an hour) the rest I cooked down a bit in the microwave and served on the side) . This was a huge success! I highly recommend you try it!

I luv u Chef John... And your humor!!   I used my large lasagna dish and had 10 thighs.  We like more onions so I used a VERY large  vidalia onion in bottom of dish with some sliced mushrooms, I then sprinkled the thighs with Paprika instead of more cayenne for my husbands sake.  (I would like the cayenne, oh well) I then did everything Chef John instructed.   I moved the thighs and onions to a nice serving dish, put the juices in a small sauce pan and whisked in some corn starch until slightly thickened and served it on the side.  Served with fresh green beans from the garden with Penzey's Fox Point seasoning and also their Roasted Garlic seasoning (so yummy together) and some angel hair Alfredo pasta.  The second time I served garlic mashed taters on the side with the mustard gravy over them and corn seasoned with butter and Penzeys Fox Point seasoning, Delish! Since I used more onions, the chicken sat up high in the dish and browned and crispened perfectly.  Remember to pour the marinade from the bag over the thighs before baking. I sent a plate over to my neighbor who's wife was out of town for a day and he sent her a pic of it and told me she'll be gone for at least a month!!!  I'm going to try this marinade on salmon, so good!

I pounded the chicken thighs.  I used champagne  citrus vinegar, jalapeño mustard, and omitted the cayenne and substituted 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes.  This recipe was gobbled up by my family.

First off I am usually not a chicken thigh fan, but I ate this down to the bone.  This was SPECTACULAR.  I made as written except I had more thighs so I doubled the marinade.  I only marinaded it for two hours because I did not read the directions soon enough.  It was still delicious.  It was the best chicken I have ever made and I make a lot of chicken.  We want this one once a week now.  Thanks for sharing.  Oh and I am a small person, and I ate three chicken thighs.....I never eat that much.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe (except the onions, as my boyfriend is allergic), and it came out great.  I am making it tonight, but I subbed balsamic vinegar since that's all I had. 
I'm wondering if anyone has tried another veggie in place of the onions? Maybe potatoes or cauliflower?

I made this dish tonight using boneless skinless chicken thighs. I allowed them to sit in the marinade overnight. Baked on 450 for 45 minutes and they are absolutely delicious and really tender.

I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar because that's what I have. I also put paprika instead of cayenne pepper so my daughter can eat it. It turned out really delicious. This is an instant favorite!

oh...my.....

i had 10 chicken thighs and doubled the mixture to get a really great coating.   This is the best chicken i've ever made.  It is unbelievably flavourful and amazing.  i baked for 45 minutes.  I already know this will be a family favourite.

Chef John, thank you so much for posting this recipe!!

As usual, Chef John created a nice recipe for chicken. This is a winner, even though it takes second place to his Cherry Bomb Chicken, also found on this site. Thanks, Chef John!

Just finished eating this!  Was wonderful. I marinated overnight.  I brushed olive oil on the onions prior to putting the chicken on top.  As other reviewers noted, the onions are DELICIOUS! I used skin-on chicken thighs and breasts.  Took about 45 minutes to cook.  I'm a fan of Chef John's recipes.  This one is outstanding!  Thanks!

This dish was absolutely scrumptious! That is saying a LOT considering I do NOT like dark meat AT ALL! But this one I could devour. I followed ingredients and directions EXACTLY, I didn't add or omit anything! I prepared thighs and marinated overnight, I was getting a little ancy,(praying I wasn't wasting time and money on something that I figured only my son would/might eat)So I prepared my baking sheet, then laid onion rings, and only 2 of the thighs,around 11 a.m.,USE VEG OIL, and don't forget to salt the chicken before you bake. I also lowered my oven rack, make sure your onion rings are thick. I served with quinoa, it was fantastic! Will make the rest tonight for when my son gets home. Thank you Chef John

I am putting this recipe together right now however after going over it several times, it doesn't say when to use the garlic. I would imagine it goes into the marinate. Will use extra onion when cooking as others have suggested. It looks to be a great dish though.

I made this recipe exactly as stated except I used boneless skinless chicken breasts (pounded even) and I poured a little reserved marinade on top of the chicken before baking. Because I was in a hurry for a recipe I only marinated these for about an hour and they still turned out moist and delicious! Thank you for the recipe!

My day was crazy and I ended up just simmering the whole thing in a pan.  It was still amazing!  Any recipe that can be messed up that badly and still be a winner is a keeper for me!

I didn't have time to marinate it at all but the flavor of the sauce was fantastic. Next time if I use the bone-in, skin-on, I will put it on a rack. There was a LOT of fat. Or we could grill it. I think this would be great with the boneless skinless. I'm looking forward to marinating it. The sauce didn't really work because there was just too much fat. 
Made it again with boneless, skinless. Still not a lot of marinating time so need to increase that. Made it in a Pyrex and there was still a lot of drainage. Didn't reduce the sauce but the flavor was still very good. Convection roast at 425 for about 20 minutes.

Amazing! I used boneless skinless thighs and kept everything else the same.  This was a huge hit with my husband, my son and myself. This is the third recipe from Chef John that I've made and everyone loved.  Try it....you won't be sorry you did.

This was delightful. So delightful that I actually need to post about it. 
At first I kind of side-eyed the recipe. Had no idea what Dry Ground Mustard was. (Still don't. I ended up getting Ground Mustard.) But, I decided to go for it because the picture looked so tasty. It called to me. And I'm glad it did. I let the chicken marinate over night and it was worth it! The chicken was very moist and juicy. The flavor perfect. The only fly in my ointment was the bone. I hate bones, but I read the bones help absorb the flavor. Or something. Anyways, this is definitely going in my rotation. 

Oh, one thing. The onions burned up in the oven. Not sure if that was meant to happen. Also, once the chicken is pulled from the oven, apparently there is more cooking to be done. I didn't have enough marinade/juice left over for that, so I called it a day and ate my chicken. Still delightful.

This was amazing. I'd highly recommend broiling the skin a little bit right before serving. This is the perfect marinade and will use it often.

I love cooking with chef John. I just recommend not using really large thighs. It seems to dilute the wonderful Mustard sauce. I increased the recipe and served 15 people last nite with rave reviews. This recipe is a winner!

Substituted  some ingredients because I did not have sweet hot mustard and Chipolte pepper (Horseradish mustard & Chilli powder). Did marinade for 4 hours (only 30 min,). Baked 30 minutes. Very forgiving recipe, loved it.

As a Don that's cooking, this is truly a wonderful chicken thigh recipe. It has wonderful taste it looks like you took hours to prepare. No mustard taste what so ever if that's what you're worried about. Just make sure you have plenty of time for your chicken thighs to marinade. So that you get the full flavor of this dish.Definitely a keeper in my book and should be in yours too.

This was fabulous and quite easy. I had to substitute horseradish mustard and it still mellowed out and the sweetness came through. This would probably make a great batch of chicken wings or drummies for snacks for Sunday Football.

Wow! A family favorite! I removed the skin from the chicken, doubled the onions, and added some julienned carrots to the onions on top. This provided more veggies to the dish and added a beautiful orange color to the presentation. A meal fit for company.

So tasty!  Quick and easy to put together.  Only had 1/4 cup mustard so adjusted the recipe.  Also didn't have chipotle so left it without.  Didn't have any foil so that will make for tough clean up but well worth it.  Will definitely make again.

Made exactly as written.  The husband, who's least favorite part of the bird is the thigh and who doesn't like sauces couldn't stop raving about it and dipping his chicken.  I never see him dip.  The thigh IS my favorite part and while it was good and it looked exactly like Chef John's ...I thought it was a tad too vinegar-y and greasy?   The onions were sweet and to die for...definitely load up on the onions.  I will make this again because my husband will ask for it...but I'm going to try a little less vinegar and maybe cut off just a little bit of the fat flap of the thigh...the part that tucks under because it didn't get crispy and maybe that was the greasy part for me.  Can't stress enough to add more onions!!

My husband and I liked this, but my daughter wasn't a fan. I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar as that's what I had so I reduced the amount by a bit. The chicken was flavorful and tasty, but for me the best part was the onions - after the chicken was fully cooked I mixed the onions from underneath it with quinoa. It was excellent! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I didn't have Dijon mustard so used spicy brown and didn't have chipoltle pepper so used a tad more cayenne. I also fixed on the grill rather than in the oven. My son,who is not a fan of chicken, said it was 'absolutely delicious' and whenever I make chicken I need to make it like this. I tried it and think it has the perfect amount of sweet but needs a little more heat. I will make this again, stick with the brown mustard but add more cayenne. And definitely grill, not bake.

Poured half the sauce on the chicken to marinate and reserve red the other half to base the chicken on the grill. It was delicious!!

Really good.  I didn't have chipotle pepper so I left that out.  I also only had boneless skinless chicken thighs, so I only needed to cook them for about 25min. This is so easy and will be a regular part of our rotation!

Loved it! Definitely do again!  Did as is, except for the chipotle seasoning since I didn't have it.  Going to get it for next time.  Can't wait to do it again.  Next, want to try it on country pork ribs as medallions with pineapple and grill'em...  Sound good?  Hubby loved it too!  It was a dinner that was so good I dreamt about it!  Love that!  Try it!  You won't be disappointed.  Also I marinated for day and half with 2 thighs and one boneless skinless chicken breast scaled down the recipe of course (only two of us).

I did something stupid and tried this on the grill and it caught fire.  With that said, we pealed off the skin and it was still moist and delicious.  I will definitely try it the right way next time!

Excellent!  Used skinless thighs - came out perfect.  Moist, tasty.  Dumped the marinade into the pan to cook w/the chicken.  I think this receipe would also be good as a kebab marinade.  Going to try it this summer - too hot to use the oven now.

I made this last week using chicken leg quarters because that was what I had. My hubby who does not like chicken went back for seconds!  The only thing I did different to he marinade was use apple cider vinegar and do it on the grill.

Soooo Super Good, my husband is not a big fan of Dijon and he thought it was out of this world. We are pretty picky eaters too. By that I mean we like good, flavorful  food. I will be adding this to my recipe rotation for sure...

Made this last night - the taste was great! The skin got nice and crunchy and the bone-in thighs really ensure that the meat stays juicy. Anyone using boneless skinless thighs is really missing out in my opinion. Couldn't find dried chipotle pepper, so just upped the cayenne, but other than that made exactly according to the recipe. We did have a mishap where the onions along the edges of the pan burned so we may have used too big of a pan. We just chucked the burned parts and everything else was still delicious. Will definitely make again, in a different pan!

Very good, but not amazing. Followed the recipe except used two onions instead of one. Would definitely recommend at least that many for medium sized onions.

It was delicious and also fun to make. I will absolutely be enjoying this one again. Sadly I had to skip the Cayenne pepper and Chipotle because of a nightshade intolerance. So it wasn't as hot as it should have been but it was still amazing!

Everything from chef John is awesome! This was super easy and everyone loved it. Its true, the onions rule. I did however have to bake the chicken for about 55 minutes to receive the desired temp. The one i was temp testing was the biggest thigh.

Here's what I did to accommodate my circumstances - a meat dish for about 50 people.  I chose to debone and skin the thighs and cut many of them in half.  I marinated them as directed (can't get dry mustard powder here) and cooked the thighs all packed closely together in 3 large pans.  I reduced the liquids as per the recipe and then put everything in a large slow cooker, in the fridge, for the next day.  About 3 hours before eating I turned the crock pot on "keep warm" and they were steaming hot and beautifully infused with flavour by the time we ate.  A HUGE hit with everyone here in Italy!!  Thanks Chef John!

I cooked a meal for 200 people last night using this recipe. I had numerous people returning for seconds! As I was thrilled about a successful dinner, I had to give credit to this luscious chicken recipe. The chicken was an easy fix that brought a huge WOW factor. It was juicy, tender, sweet, spicy, tangy, PERFECT. Kuddos to the chef!

Great recipe!  I made it with breast meat and they were very tender.  I was also thinking it might be good with some bacon slices on top while cooking.  Had it with white rice.

Yet again a PERFECT recipe Chef John!  Marinated the thighs overnight and they turned out not only EXACTLY as you showed in the video but everyone ate them up as fast as they could.  Put this on our menu and expect a wonderful following.  One thing:  You didn't mention how great they smell while they are cooking.  It is so good it  makes your mouth water.  EXCELLENT!

Followed the recipe as written except omitted the cayenne and halved the chipotle (one of the kids is sensitive to heat) and added one onion per other reviewers suggestions. It was moist and delicious, definitely a keeper! Definitely add an onion, the kids devoured them! Yum!

i tried this recipe last night, using a chicken that has been sitting on my fridge for 4 days. Adjust the recipe a bit, using whatever I got left on the shelves. Turned out fantastic, only marinated for 30 mins or so.

I wonder if i marinated it over night, my chicken would taste awesome

million thanks Chef
