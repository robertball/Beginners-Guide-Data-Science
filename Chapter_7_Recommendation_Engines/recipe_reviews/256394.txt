This stir-fry packs a  flavor punch that was delicious. The Rice wine vinegar comes through strong, but we enjoyed it thoroughly.  I think the serving size of four for this is a little optimistic , we had three and it all went quickly.  This is a recipe that you could easily double without any worries at all.  Thanks for the great recipe, this is now in our rotation!

I made a vegetarian option, without steak; added more vegetables - red and yellow peppers, broccoli, cauliflower. Added a dash of sesame oil at the end of cooking. Most importantly, double the sauce ingredients - the more vegetables you add, the more sauce you need to cover them. Very tasty, thank you for sharing this recipe!

Great flavors, except for the steak. Think I may try grilling it whole, slicing and then mixing it with the sauce and veg at the end.  Maybe some scrambled egg too.

Yuck. I followed the recipe. I didn't have fresh mushrooms, but rehydrated some shiitake mushrooms.  It just tastes like too much vinegar and not enough veggies in it. My husband though it was ok, but I just couldn't eat it. I'm dumping the entire dinner.  Too bad I made I adjusted the recipe for the full lb of meat I had. Wish I could salvage it somehow.

This is a good starting place. Definitely double the sauce, especially with the veggies. Instead of onion, I browned minced garlic and the ginger together in olive oil before browning the beef. I added carrots for some color, and sprinkled toasted sesame seeds for a finishing touch. I prepared the rice in beef broth for a little added flavor. It was a crowd pleaser. 5 stars, will make again.

Delicious!  I used 1/2 the recommended amount of brown sugar but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. My entire family loved it!
