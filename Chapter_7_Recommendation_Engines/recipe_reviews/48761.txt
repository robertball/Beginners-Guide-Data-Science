This casserole is amazing!  I make it every chance I get.  I do use a lot less pepperoni (only about 1 oz.), and I chop it up so that I can have a little pepperoni flavor in every bite.  I also use just 3-4 zucchini and about 3 tomatoes, and even then I have trouble fitting it all into a 9 x 13 pan.  I must be using bigger veggies.  I usually  add leftover cooked pasta in a layer in the middle.  It makes it a little more substantial.  I also serve it with french bread for dipping in the leftover juice.  It just tastes so wonderful.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is now our favorite zucchini recipe.
I sprinkled salt, pepper and garlic powder on the zucchini, and the flavor was outstanding.

11.10.05 I'm convinced that great sauce the other reviewers love has nothing to do with this dish.  It's only good tomatoes that flavor the fresh bread.  You have good tomatoes, you'll get good sauce.  It looked really good, but lacked a lot of flavor.  The pepperoni seemed too easy to spice this dish - & it was.  It did nothing.  Some simple recipes magically tranform into a dish you'd never dream was so basic; but not this one.  Darn it.

This got great reviews at a dinner party I hosted!  I was a little sceptical about the pepperoni especially when I accidently bought spicy!!  It gave the casserole a delicious flavour!  Yum

I just fixed this for dinner and my husband had seconds!  The only change I made to it was I added salt, pepper, onion powder and since I didn't have pepperoni on hand I used prosciutto slices.  Only had one type of cheese - cheddar, but the casserole turned out great!  Thnaks for another option for zucchini.

I made this a vegetarian casserole and omitted the pepperoni and added spinach and mushrooms. Because I didn't enough cottage cheese, I added a little leftover alfredo sauce, which turned out to be AWESOME. I agreed that this is way too watery and I don't know how to fix it. If that could be fixed, it would be a five star casserole.

WOW!  This recipe was awesome and amazing and I could not stop eating it!!  It was very watery, I guess from the tomato's and zucc's but STILL well worth it.  I did melt a stick of butter and mixed a sleeve of crumbled Ritz crackers in the butter and put all over the top, WOW!  I also just made it one layer, in the order the recipe said but that filled a 9x13 glass dish, did not follow how much the recipe said to use, just cut enough of each vegetable to fill the pan.  Unbelievably great taste, thank you!

One of the best zucchini casseroles ever. Everyone loved it... I added some extra hot and sweet peppers in the layers & it was great. (Just wish it wasn't so watery...but that's easy to deal with...just drain it. It's even better on day 2.)

Excellent summer dish!  We add 1 cup uncoooked rice to the bottom of the baking dish to absorb the wonderfully flavored soupy goodness!  We also add oregano, garlic, and pepper to taste.  Delicious.

I love this recipe. It has tons of great flavor! The only thing I don't care for is how watery it gets, although it's not a huge deal since I just use a slotted spoon to serve and serve with french bread to soak up the juice.

I really like this recipe, but I have yet to find a zucchini recipe that I don't like.  I did have to drain about a cup of liquid off after baking it, but then it was fine.  I seasoned each layer of zucchini with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  I would make this again.

I liked it.  My husband said it was an OK way to eat zucchini.  My kids took one bite and declared it inedible.  I think this is one for people who are already willing to eat zucchini, but not one for winning them over.

Tastes great, but does have a lot of liquid.  I don't think the liquid is coming just from the vegetables.  It's also fat from the pepperoni and maybe whey from the cottage cheese.

I thought this had very good flavor but there was too much water in my zucchini and it was very runny. The next time I make it I will sprinkle some salt on the zucchini and let it draw out some liquid before assembling.

I did not change the recipe but one 16 oz container of cottage cheese was not enough, so I added extra.  I did sprinkle a little Italian seasoning over the cheese layer, otherwise I was true to the recipe.  My Dad and I ate the whole thing!  He said it was good enough to serve in a restaurant!  I'm making it again tomorrow.  Thanks!

Used 5 tomatoes as suggested,  garlic and herb Dash and pepper for more flavor. The dinner party of 6 devoured it! This recipe is a keeper.

Yummy recipe.  I only made 1/2 a recipe.  Sprinkled each layer with garlic powder, salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning.  Was delicious.  My husband loved it.  I am going to try adding some hot banana peppers next time.  Also, I baked it for a lot longer than stated.

This recipe tastes SO good. Great way to cook of garden abundance!

I had leftover ricotta cheese from making lasagna- seasoned appropriately with egg etc. I added that instead of cottage cheese to use it up and it worked out great!!

Liked but did not love the recipe like I thought we would. Would make again but make some changes. First of all, needs some added seasoning, perhaps garlic and salt/pepper. May also try adding some marinara sauce to it next time as well. Lastly, the recipe says to cook 30-40 minutes. I did this but did not cover, zucchini was no where near cooked and cheese was burning so I covered it and will do this from the beginning next time. Great way to use up all those zucchini from the garden.

This was really good. I used part-skim ricotta cheese and only one layer of pepperoni. I only had two tomatoes, otherwise it would've been even better! (I gave 5 stars only because I changed things, otherwise I would have given it 4 stars.)

This is the best tasting casserole I have ever tasted. I love the differnt tastes and textures that all the ingredients add. It is a truly AWESOME dish. I dipped pumpernickel bread in the juices. It was sooo AWESOME. I bet tsmom is a great cook just by sampling this one recipe. I bet she's quite the looker too. Can I give you a call. I'm looking for a good cook to be my wife!!!!     bd
