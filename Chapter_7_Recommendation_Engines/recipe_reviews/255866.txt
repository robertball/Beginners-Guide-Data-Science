This was delicious chili. I know I have eaten nopales before but not in ages and I know I have never cooked with them. They added a nice favor to the chili and were tender.  My changes.. hominy instead of corn and my canned tomatoes  had diced chili in them so I left out the chipotle.. good thing as it was plenty spicy for me this way

Amazing and thankful for a spin on traditional chili.  Loved the tanginess from the nopales juice.  I did add a lb of pork chorizo and used Mexican chili powder so it want too bland.  Lastly I subbed one can of black beans with navy beans.  It was hit and will share with others.  This makes a large crock full so plan on freezing some.

This was honestly the best chili I ever had. Be warned though that this recipe calls for enough chili to fill 2 standard sized crock pots. After I combined all my ingredients I had to borrow a friends crock pot just to handle all of the chili. It was so delicious that it was gone within 2 days though. The tomato paste adds a really nice  savory flavor.

Not bad for tomato based gringo "Chili" without an 'E.' Instead of corn, use posole or hominy. Posole has a better texture. A little more Red Chile powder. The chipotle give s nice taste but the recipe as stated isn't very hot. Don't forget a dollop of some sour cream & tons of cheese to top off the bowl.  The Nopales are a nice touch.

Loved it! For just my husband and myself I made a half recipe.  This was an excellent twist on chili and will be making it again soon.

This dish was a great success for us. I made a vegetarian version by leaving out the meat. Added some carrots and peppers. I absolutely recommend it. This is going to be one of our favorites.

Excellent base recipe!!! To make it thicker, I actually only used half the amount of tomatoes called for. I also added one more chipotle pepper and a little more sugar.  Note: The portions filled a crockpot with some left over. So using all tomatoes will probably fill two crockpots.

This chili was delicious. Just enough spice and was yummy! This specific recipe makes a lot of chili, so you can split the ingredients in half to make a smaller portion. My new favorite chili. 

Nopales (cactus) were hard to find but if you have a local Kroger you should be able to find them in a big jar. I would also suggest cutting them up before putting them in the chili so they aren't so long.

I took it to our country clubs cook off. It was well liked, I thought it was very thick and I added a bit of water, but the consensus was it was still very thick, I think next time I will add tomato juice. but the flavors are very good ( I used a poblano instead of chipotle, and then the canned chipotle in adobo sauce (about half the can) and half a jalapeno, seeded)
