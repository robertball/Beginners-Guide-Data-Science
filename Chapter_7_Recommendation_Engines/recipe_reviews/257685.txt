Really easy, but sooo tasty. I added a splash of lemon juice, and it was great! I love this on muffins and it freezes well, too.

4.8.17  Had some very ripe strawberries in the fridge that needed to be used up, so I gave this recipe a try.  I just used my mini chopper which ended up leaving small pieces of strawberries, so you really get a taste of the fresh strawberries (had it this morning on some cinnamon toast).  I think this is a good base recipe for using other fruits such as raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, etc.  Quick, easy, tasty, and  that's good enough  for me!
