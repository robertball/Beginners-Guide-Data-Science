I doubled the recipe and added 4 eggs.  The cheesecake took over an hour to cook but came out beautifully. I decorated the top with Chocolate Ganache and Whipped Cream.  No one in my family is crazy about sour cream. Happy St Patrick's Day!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was the only dessert dish that was empty when we left!  My family loved it!

I switched the amounts of cacao and mint (using mint flavoring rather than creme de menthe), and I made my own crust, and it came out very good.

A nice variation on grasshopper pie.  I made my own crust (2C chocolate wafer crumbs, 2T sugar, 6T melted margarine) in a springform pan.  I only had one pkg (8 oz) cream cheese, but it still turned out fine.

I made this for a fund raiser where we sell slices of pie. It sold very well! The next week a guy came for another slice but he was very disappointed that I hadn't made another. Promised him I would make one this week! I did add a bit of peppermint extract to bump up the minty taste.

Love it! Made it for work so I had to use the non-alcoholic version. Everyone gave it a thumbs up! Have to make it again!

This recipe is tolerable, but not our favorite.  The creme de menthe made the pie taste weird (imagine fruity,  fake mint flavor) and if I were to make it again,  I'd use peppermint schnapps or extract.
