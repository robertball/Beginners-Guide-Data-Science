This was very, very good.  I used the marinade on B/S chix and grilled them, such wonderful flavor.  Next time I think I'll add a tad more curry powder, and use hot curry, for a little extra zing.  Highly recommended, and thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

Since I couldn't edit my review, I'll just add that I didn't use Soy sauce and used garlic powder and half an onion instead of green onion.

Yum!!!  If you love curry, you will love this as we did.  This could've used a bit of heat though such as adding garlic chile or whatever heat component you want to use.

What a simple yet tasty recipe! Curry+soy sauce is a great combination. Since I didn't have time to marinade, I modified it by boiling it instead of baking it (about the same cook time). I started with just enough water to cover the meat and ending it with enough sauce to go with the rice. I did also add a medium size purple onion (sauted it) and two tomatoes for richer flavor and thicker sauce. My daughter loved it!

I suggest for better flavor brine the wings in salt and brown sugar overnight. I added smoked paprika and red pepper. Last 10 minutes of cooking turn oven up to 425-450 for crispy wings.

These were alright.  They have a subtle flavor so what my husband did was drizzle maple syrup over them when they were done.  Also, we had to cook these a lot longer than the recipe calls for.

I had to follow the serving guide for 3 people (12 wings) since I only had 10 chicken wings. I had to bake them for 75min at 350° to achieve ideal brownness and crispiness. The overall seasoning flavor was subtle.

I agree with others that these need some heat or some extra flavor. I marinated my wings for 2 hours and they only had a mild curry flavor. I think I will try these again but add a little more spice and marinate all night. 3 stars for the recipe as it’s written.

Love it, so easy.  I did double the sauce, added extra curry, garlic chili sauce for that extra zing.  Definitely into my wing rotation.

I used more soy and added 1 serrano pepper.  Marinated overnight then grilled them low and slow.  They came out nicely caramelized and fall off the bone moist and tender.  I will probably add more curry next time as well as another pepper to add a bit more of a kick.

These were very tasty.  I like to double up the sauce.  The family all had seconds of this dish. This is a keeper.

I marinated for 5 hours and the wings were ok but the flavor was too bland for my husband and I. If you like curry flavor but don't want spicy, this recipe is good.

Well, I'm in search for the holy grail of chicken wings.  I like them but hate to pay someone to make something that should be so easy to make.  These were very good and I will make them again. The ones I made, look more like the second photo. I made them exactly as shown in the recipe.  I noticed that some of the critics said the recipe tasted a little bland. So, I left them in the marinade overnight and they tasted about right. 

Maybe next time I make them, I will add a little heat with some sciracha sauce or something like it. Thanks Musher for sharing.

The flavor didn't seem to soak into the chicken despite marinating. They smelled and looked amazing, but upon eating were just so-so.

Very easy to do.  I doubled the seasoning plus accidentally doubled the curry again.  But the chicken turned out great.  I did marinate over night.

I loved this! I didn't have soy sauce so I used Ponzu. (A citrus like soy sauce) Also, my curry powder was super spicy and I was making this for someone who wasn't as keen on spice as I am so I used a non spicy curry paste and then a few dashes of the curry powder.
