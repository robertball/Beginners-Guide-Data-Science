Very good.  If you don't have a fresh orange, sub some of the water for orange juice. I cut way WAY back on the nutmeg (just a dash) and the sugar and nuts (too many calories).

Myself, 5yo, and 3yo all really liked this. 
We didnâ€™t have fresh cranberries, but did have craisins, so we used a 1/4 of those, and almond milk instead of water, which was fine with the dried cranberries. I left out the nuts.

This is now my standard recipe for oatmeal.  It is delicious, a world that probably is rare used to describe oatmeal!

delicious and easy recipe, especially with brown sugar and cinnamon added. Cranberries and apples are such a great combination. Thank you!

My 3-year-old likes it too! I subbed orange juice for about 1/4th of the water (1/2 c) and just used a dash of nutmeg. I also drizzled a tiny  bit of maple syrup over the bowl before serving! Fast + delicious = make again material!

Delicious and tasty. I would add apple sauce next time to add some more flavour and natural sweetness. Also great for cold mornings.
