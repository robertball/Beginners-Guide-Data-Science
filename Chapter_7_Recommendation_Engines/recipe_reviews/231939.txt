This was really good!  I seasoned the chicken with salt, paprika and ground mustard powder as suggested by another reviewer.  Then, I browned the chicken in oil and removed from the skillet and added about 4 cups of stir-fry veggies to the remaining oil until heated through.  Then I poured in the sauce mixture, which I doubled to accommodate all the added veggies, and added back the chicken and let the sauce reduce some.  Finally, I added a little cornstarch mixed with cold water to thicken it a tad.  The amount of sauce was perfect to coat all the meat and veggies and mix well with steamed rice on the plate.  Yum!

This recipe is so easy and quick to fix, and it tastes good too. I used lite soy sauce and only 1 huge chicken breast, but I made the entire amount of sauce so there would be enough to pour over the rice. Definitely a keeper.

I made this last night; it was a big hit with my boyfriend. I used more honey and pepper flakes, and about half of the soy sauce. It was a little runny when the sauce/chicken was on the stove top, so to try to thicken the sauce up and give the chicken more flavor, I actually transferred the chicken and sauce into a baking dish and put it into the oven at 350 for 20-ish mins. It was wonderful that I did that. The sauce thickened a little bit, and the chicken was so amazing because the sauce was able to infuse into the chicken more (like a glaze is suppose to do). Served it over rice and had stir fry vegetables as an option to mix in or keep on the side.

I added some minced garlic to the sauce...and also before frying the chicken I dredged it with flour (and a little bit of salt and pepper)...after adding the sauce I brought it to rapid simmer and let it reduce so it would glaze over also the flour from the chicken helped the process taste very similar to what you'd get at a Chinese take put place but half the cost!

Double the sauce & used LITE soy sauce!  I seasoned the chicken w/salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder, paprika & ground mustard powder as suggested by another reviewer. Then, browned the chicken in oil & removed from the skillet & added @3 cups of stir-fry veggies to the remaining oil until sauteed. Poured in the sauce mixture (2X amount), to accommodate all the added veggies, added back the chicken & let the sauce reduce some. Finally, I added a little cornstarch mixed w/cold water to thicken it. The amount of sauce was perfect to coat all the meat & veggies. Served over cooked rice.

I've made this recipe twice now and both times it was very  tasty.   The first time I made it I  thought it was a little runny, so the second time I made it I put  2 Tbs of cornstarch in a plastic bag and coated the chicken prior to cooking.  Not only did it thicken the sauce, it also added some crispness to the chicken.

A GLAZE is supposed to stick to the meal. This wasn't the case. It was runny. Also, I expected it to be sweet (the honey) AND salty (the soy sauce) AND spicy (the red pepper). The honey overpowered everything.  Wouldn't recommend to anyone.

Super easy and tastey. Make this all the time. We stirfry some zucchini, squash, onions, and red bell peppers. Make some extra sauce to put on these veggies. Make brown rice as the base. Then the veggies. Then the chicken. Also added some sesame seeds!

Delicious! I make this at least every other week. I add about 1-2 teaspoons of freshly grated ginger (use a less if you're using the bottled ginger), and it tastes even better!

I sprinkled chicken with yellow mustard powder, paprika and salt while cooking in olive oil. Then after adding the mixture of honey, soy sauce and red pepper I added about 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and mixed up while cooking over medium heat. Sause became thick like a glaze. Served with white rice and added cooked broccoli.

Good tasting, I had a hard time making the glaze stick to the chicken. So I removed the chicken and reserved the glaze in the pan cooking it down till think. Poured it over the chicken. It worked much better that way. I will make it again.

It was pretty tasty. I did like other reviewers and used salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and paprika to the chicken while saut√©ing. Had 3 mongo breasts, so doubled it. Minute Rice for 4 servings, and it worked for 3 of us with another meal for 2. Used cornstarch to thicken sauce. With the changes, I'd make again.

We love this!  It is very easy to make and tastes great.  The only change we make is a bit of corn starch in the sauce to thicken it. This helps the sauce to stick to the chicken better.

I love it! I'm on limited diet, little fat and no spicy food. I can easily omit the red pepper and add it to pieces for my husband. I seriously needed something other than breaded chicken. This was perfect!

Good recipe.   Like previous post I added corn starch to thicken the glaze.   Recipe calls for a red pepper but doesn't tell you when and where to add it.

Easy (though it took me longer than the 20 minutes the recipe said) and my super picky kids loved it.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added some onion and garlic powders.  I also added some cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce.  I will definitely make again.

Yum!  I was so tired after work today and almost decided to just order in. So glad we didn't!  This recipe is so fast and easy!  After I started the rice I realized what I thought was soy sauce was actually teriyaki, so I used that instead. I doubled the sauce and added some onion and garlic.  The perfect recipe for a busy day.

I'm a newbie cook, and I modified the recipe a bit for more chicken.  The sauce didn't turn out as thick or sweet as I thought it would, and two of my three kids thought it was 'too spicy' from the crushed red peppers.  I liked it, but will tweak the recipe some next time.  Looking forward to trying more recipes on this app. Thanks!

This was yum. I needed a quick dish that would still taste good. The flavors in this dish were perfect.  The sauce isn't too think but I was fine with that as I had this chicken over salad ..so liked the sauce drizzled over my greens

This was delicious and easy!  I was concerned about the sauce at first, but if you let it simmer for a little bit (5-10) minutes on medium-low heat it will actually glaze the chicken.  My only problem was that my chicken was still just slightly frozen so it was a little tough.  But I'll definitely make this again... Often!

This came out REALLY good however, I added a few things to the recipe. After dicing the chicken, I tossed it in flour mixed with salt, black pepper, lemon zest, and garlic powder. Then I let the chicken brown in the skillet and gradually stirred in the honey mixture. I cooked the chicken in the mixture on low heat for about 7-10 minutes. It tasted a little too sweet so I added in a half tsp of white vinegar to break up the sweetness. It's soooo yummy!!

Wanted something simple and new to make and ran into this recipe.  Had all the ingredients so I made it :). It was so good, flavorful, smooth, sweet with that hint of spicy. The only thing I changed was I added a table spoon of garlic for a extra flavor to the honey. Will make again :).

This is a delicious recipe and easy to make. The only thing I do is toss the chicken pieces in cornstarch before browning. This makes the chicken a little crispy and the sauce thickens just enough.

I followed other reviewers suggestions and added some seasoning like salt and pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, ground mustard but the  honey overpowered everything. The sauce never thickened so I added some cornstarch.  I'll give it another try because it was so quick and easy, but cut back on the honey.

For a recipe this simple and quick, it was surprisingly flavourful! The chicken was still tender and the sauce thickened up nicely to go over rice or any other side dish. This will be my go to dinner in a hurry. Thumbs up!

Easiest sauce ever. I do suggest adding some corn starch or in a pinch, even flour worked for me to thicken but if you boil it long enough, it gets sticky on its own. My chicken or pork is usually done by then so I hate to overcook to thicken the sauce which is why I add a thickener. Either way, delicious!

Made this and loved it! Followed a suggestion to season the chicken with paprika, salt, & ground mustard. Perfect addition. I also added a bag of frozen veggies and thickened with a little corn starch. Served with Asian Coconut Rice from here as well.

The sauce is very runny, as others have noted; however I decided to put my chicken on top of a salad and used the extra sauce as the dressing. I also used corn syrup instead of honey and it was amazing.

This dish was great because I already had all the ingredients in my kitchen. It was very quick and easy. The only issue I had was the fact the sauce was too thin so it didn't stick to the chicken that well. But other than that I was delicious served over brown rice. Even my 3 year old liked it

This was super easy and very good.  I just through in frozen (pre-cooked) chicken with the honey and soy sauce and it liquified nicely.  No need to add oil.  Very good.

Excellent! Made some edits: #cut 1LB skinless boneless chicken breast thighs into bite size. #mix 2tbsp flour & 1/2tsp of the following: paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano; coat the chicken. #on medium heat, get oil hot on a skillet. Brown the chicken (& add any remaining powder mix) on the skillet for 8min. #Mix 1/4c honey & 2tbsp of soy sauce (w/ ginger if available). And add to the skillet & reduce until the chicken is fully cooked. #remove chicken & cook fresh/frozen spinach/kale in the skillet as a side

The sauce is completely runny, as said by another user, so it's not really a glaze. Flavor was still good though, and it's a super easy and quick recipe to whip up, so I can't complain.

We made this as is, and everyone in the house loved it.  Tonight will be the 3rd time it will hit our table. We have quadrupled the recipe except the red pepper flakes because the last batch was a touch too hot.  We serve it over white rice with a veggie side. It is one of our favorites.

We really liked this recipe. I did make a few changes following some of the other reviewers suggestions. I prepared the chicken  in bigger chunks than shown in the picture.  I gave the chicken some salt and pepper and then dusted it with enough corn starch to evenly coat. I then cooked the chicken in a large skillet with vegetable oil until about almost done. I then added the honey sauce.  The only change I made to the honey sauce was to add a tablespoon of Lingham's hot sauce. Lingham's Hot Sauce is a sweet hot sauce that can be found in the Mexican section at Walmart. (The sauce is spicy on its own - but with the chicken and the honey it added what we thought was the perfect little addition!)

OMGoodness! This was so good! I was a little concerned at first when I tasted the honey/soy-sauce mixture alone, but when I added it to my chicken stir-fry and finished cooking it - it was utterly delicious! I used boneless/skinless chicken thigh because that's what I had on hand. I did embellish a bit... added some onion, bell pepper (red, yellow, and orange), and two slice mushrooms (had on-hand/about to expire). This would be fine on it's own but also a great recipe for adding your "odds 'n ends" veggies you have in the fridge. I think if you've seen it in an Asian dish, it could easily be added here. Yes, I will make this again! Thank you!!

Made a ever so slight adjustment - added 1/2 tsp of corn starch and doubled the recipe. I also substituted chili pepper flakes for the red pepper flakes.

It was sweet with a nice little kick for the finish - awesome meal!!

It was delicious. We like our food spicy so I added extra pepper flakes and dredged the chicken in flour before frying. Tasted so good.

I needed something in a hurry so I decided to try this recipe.  We loved it.  I didn't change a thing.  Plan to keep this one handy so I can make it often.

Good quick dinner. I tossed the chicken in flour before I fried it. Help keep the sauce from falling off.

We really enjoyed this recipe with mods. I listened to the comments and seasoned the chicken which garlic powder mix, paprika and salt and pepper. I also thickened the sauce with cornstarch and doubled the amount. We also added asparagus and peppers to the mix. Yum!!

Great recipe!  I added a little bit of minced garlic and corn starch to the sauce.  I also seasoned the chicken breasts with Salt, Paprika, and Ground Mustard.  Served with white rice and corn.

I sliced up a green bell pepper and an onion and sauteed those in the oil about 3 or 4 minutes before adding the chicken.  This really added to a well-rounded flavor for the dish that I would repeat again.  Also, I found the glaze to also be runny, so whisked in maybe a teaspoon of corn starch to thicken it up and then it was the right consistency.  I think I would try adding more pepper flakes or a bit of vinegar next time, to add contrast to the pretty strong honey flavor.  But overall, it's a good basic bones for a VERY simple and highly edible weeknight meal!

Taste was good, but it needed something else. Next time I'm going to add red & yellow bell peppers and I will probably add the rice to the fry pan before removing the chicken.

GREAT DINNER! After reading the reviews I mixed corn starch, paprika, garlic powder & dry mustard & shook it with the chicken in a bag. Browned it & in another pot steamed fresh green beans & carrots to tender crisp. Threw some green onions into the chicken the last minute then added the sauce & let it thicken. Dumped the green beans/carrots in & heated & served over rice. Just the right amount of sweetness/spicy! Much easier than the stir fry I‚Äôd been making - thanks!

I am so glad I found this recipe. I‚Äôm trying to be healthier and eat more chicken, but I honestly don‚Äôt like the taste. I LOVE this recipe and it‚Äôs so flavorful I don‚Äôt even taste the chicken. I will definitely be making this all the time. Way healthier than getting it at my Chinese place. I threw it over some brown rice and mixed in some peppers, broccili, and carrots and it‚Äôs great!! So quick and simple too!!

My husband adores this recipe and it's simple enough that he can make it himself. We are still adjusting the levels of soy sauce and honey to really click with our tastes but we've made it a few times with some broccoli thrown in as well and it makes for a nice weeknight dinner.

So yummy!  I dredged the chicken pieces in flour before cooking as other people suggested. The pieces were fully cooked before I added the honey/soy sauce mixture and I cooked till it was thickened, which the flour covered chicken helped.  I think the cook time was too long, I did less (I didn't time it though). The chicken was moist and delicious.  I recommend making more sauce so there is some to have with rice.

(I cooked some fresh picked sugar snap peas in more honey soy sauce mixture and it didn't thicken, making me believe that the flour/corn starch is necessary to get a thicker sauce.)

I wanted a non spicy version so left out the red pepper flakes. I coated chicken in flour. Texture was good. I didn‚Äôt like the taste. I added some things at the end to try to salvage it: ginger, garlic powder, salt. My husband thought it was decent. I could eat it. My toddler son didn‚Äôt like it.

Simple and delicious! Easy to modify as well!  I used chicken thighs (taste preference plus it's what I had) and doubled the sauce recipe. Added a little cornstarch prior to mixing in the honey and soy sauce. Plus a little bit of garlic powder. Added steamed stir fry veggies too at the end. Delicious!

Delicious! I wanted to try something new for dinner and found this recipe. I followed the recipe, I didn't make any adjustments as others did in the reviews. My family loved it. It's a keeper!

This recipe is very tasty and easy to put together. It also doesn't require a lot of ingredients which is nice when you don't want to deal with putting a lot together. The red pepper gave it a nice spiciness and the soy sauce balances out the honey so it's not overly sweet. However, it took about 20+ minutes, not 5, in order for the sauce to actually thicken into a glaze. I had just given up and had begun preparing a baking dish to try to thicken it in the oven when I noticed it was finally thickening. If I were to make the recipe again I would also double the amount of sauce. This only makes enough to cover the chicken and not enough to pour over the rice. Because of this, I felt like there was not enough flavor when eaten with the rice.

I read the reviews first and made some modifications;
1. dredged the chicken in flour and spices (pepper, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder)
2. added a half spoon of extra soy sauce to the sauce
3. replaced red pepper with chili powder (didn't have red pepper, but it worked)
The sauce came out thick and perfect as a glaze. This could be due to the flour.
It was delicious, and (thanks to the extra soy sauce probably), not too sweet, just right!

I would definitely make this again.   Love the simplicity of only a few ingredients, and it was very tasty. In my opinion doubling the sauce is a must, as I did,  (if not tripling.)  If you prefer a sauce that coats and stays on the chicken I'd suggest making a roux like I did.  After the chicken was cooked I removed the chicken from the sauce mixture and set it aside.  Into a measuring  cup I added 5 or 6 tablespoons of the warm sauce and added a heaping tablespoon of flour.  Mixed very well, and then incorporated it back into the sauce in the pan and mixed constantly with a whisk.  I then brought the heat up to high until it boiled for a few minutes and became thick, then added the chicken back to the pan.  It coated the chicken beautifully. Absolutely delicious over Jasmine rice and broccoli.  Simple, tasty and will definitely make again.  Thank you to the original poster for sharing!

My husband loves it! I add more pepper flakes than it calls for since he likes it! But it was a little runny so to thicken the sauce I added flour to the chicken before putting it into the pan and that sure did the trick. I also season the chicken with spices like onion powder, etc. Great recipe! Thanks.

Really good! I added about a half tablespoon of sriracha to the glaze which really enhanced the flavor. At first the glaze did not seem to stick to the chicken but the more it cooked the thicker and stickier the sauce got. Tastes great in flour tortillas!

This chicken dish was good, easy and fast. I did season the cubed chicken breast first with a little bit of adobo, and I added 2 cloves of minced fresh garlic. To the sauce, I added about a tablespoon of cornstarch to help thicken the sauce. Otherwise, the dish was perfect! Thank you for the recipe and the reviewers with their slight adjustments.

This sucks. I've made this twice. Completely forgot about the first time and when I remembered how much it stunk I cooked it using a variation off a comment I read. Did the whole add garlic powder, pepper, onion powder, salt, paprika mix and then put in the oven to thicken sauce. It still sucked. Reviewing this so I remember not to make it next time I'm too tired and just want to cook something quick and easy.

I made this per the recipe except the longer it cooked, the waterier it got.  I did use a little corn starch to thicken the sauce.  Turned out great and we both liked it enough to cook it again.

The sauce is very good. I did not put the red pepper flakes in, but instead used 1 clove of garlic. I would recommend marinating the chicken in the sauce and then cooking (for more moist and flavorful chicken).

I honestly didn't have high expectations for this but my wife wanted it. I quadrupled everything cause one chicken breast is basically nothing but it was GREAT! I will say it took a LOT longer than 5 mins to thicken the sauce haha cause of the big batch but I added Xanthan Gum to thicken (great little ingredient if you are unfamiliar) and it turned out AMAZING. restaurant quality Chinese style honey glazed chicken over a bed of Jasmine rice

Added pink salt and paprika to raw chicken and green peas at the every end. Switched the red pepper flakes for central markets southwestern marsela spice mix. Needs more sauce, not  a glaze because it‚Äôs to runny. But as a sauce I would double it next time and add more chicken and veggies because for two people it doesn‚Äôt go far: We had it with white jasmine rice.

I made this for my family however doing everything it said I found that it was not 4 servings and more 2 servings which was kinda disappointing for I had to make extra. The flavor was good but to make the ‚Äúgravy‚Äù thicker and stick to the chicken the meat became slightly over cooked. The flavor did not change and was still good and my family injoyed it but be warned with this.

Will certainly make this again, I did make some alterations to the recipe. I doubled the Honey initially and used 1/3 cup of soy sauce and just eyed the red pepper flakes. Came out a little salty so I finished off the bottle of honey (12 oz bottle) and added a little more red pepper. That got it perfect, after cooking it with the chicken I noticed as other reviewers have said that it was a little thin, I solved that by taking the meat out and reducing the sauce to the desired thickness

Super quick and easy recipe with ingredients I typically have on hand.  Seasoned chicken before cooking. Doubled sauce and stir fried carrots, red onion and red pepper with it.   Added cornstarch/water mixture at end to thicken and topped with green onion.

This was delicious and super easy. I added about two tablespoons of chopped yellow onion and served over rice. I also seasoned the chicken with salt and paprika before cooking based on another review. I will definitely be making this again.

This was really yummy and easy. I dredged the chicken in flour that was seasoned with salt and pepper. Also added chopped garlic and zucchini. Next time I might double the sauce.

Excellent. My husband is very picky but I decided to give this a try anyway. I seasoned the chicken first with salt, pepper, ground mustard and paprika. I then tossed the chicken into a bag with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. After the chicken browned, I removed it from the skillet and added a can of Chinese vegetables. Once the vegetables were heated through, I added the sauce. When it started to thicken, I added the chicken.   The red pepper gave it just the right amount of kick. I sprinkled some sesame seeds over it and served it over brown and wild rice. Next time, I‚Äôll probably add cashews since my husband loves Asian dishes that way. By the way, my husband couldn‚Äôt get over how good this meal turned out.

As is, the sauce is a little thin/runny for my taste. 2nd time I made it, I floured the chicken before cooking and it came out great! We served with rice and even my daughter who doesn't like chicken thought it was ok.

Quite good but could pre-thicken the sauce so the chicken doesn't get over-cooked.

Made first time for dinner tonight, yummy! I followed some advice from other reviewers and added a little fresh garlic and ginger to the sauce. I dredged the chicken chunks in cornstarch, salt, and black pepper which gave it a nice crispy crust and no problems with thickness of sauce. Served over white rice and side of vegetables. Will make again with double the sauce for veggies.

This was pretty good. My wife is pretty picky but I try and mix things up as much as possible. I seasoned the chicken with Lowry‚Äôs, garlic powder, and paprika. I left out the red pepper flakes on account my wife doesn‚Äôt like spice. However this for me tasted very good.

Delish! cubed chicken and marinated 30 min in a dry satay style rub. browned it in sesame and Mediterranean oil blend. Set chicken aside and cooked broccoli in same pan then added the chicken back in plus sauce. It was a big hit with my family.

Instructions did not say to drain the broth from the cooked chicken before adding the honey mixture, so the glaze ended up being more watery than a sticky glaze. The recipe is simple enough and flavor good enough to make me want to try it again sometime--only draining the chicken before adding the glaze.

This recipe is great for week nights, because it is so quick. I love garlic, so I chop a couple of cloves and place it in a plastic  bag with the bite-sized pieces of chicken and a bit of olive oil. I let it marinate before making the actual recipe. Also, I like a thicker sauce so I mix a little cornstarch and cold water at the end.

Yum yum yum. After reading reviews, I floured the chicken before pan frying. This crisped the chicken a little & helped thicken what little sauce there was. After adding the sauce, I sprinkled with garlic powder and powdered ginger, mixed it up & dumped it in a baking dish. Then in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes and the sauce was deliciously caramelized. I served with fresh steamed broccoli & jasmine rice. It was super delicious & LOVED by my husband. One note: I never know how much a ‚Äúchicken breast‚Äù is in a recipe. My freezer had a 6 oz breast and an 11 oz breast. So for me, the 2 breasts totalled close to 1 pound. The sauce totally coated the chicken with no extra in the pan. So, if your chicken breasts are on the larger size &  if you want sauce to put over your rice, then you should double the sauce recipe. Two thumbs up!

I was intrigued by the simplcity of this entree as well as it's 4.5 rating by 277 reviewers.  I made it.  We were greatly disappointed. 

My ingredients were fresh, chicken tender, but there was NO TASTE to this dish.  What a waste of good B/S breast meat.

Easy to make and tasty. I did what some of the other reviews suggested and added salt, pepper, dry mustard then covered it with flour before putting in the hot oil. I also added 2 tbsp of corn starch (diluted with cold water) and added it to the chicken mixture to thicken it. High marks from my two teen sons.

This made a great dinner. As others suggested we dusted the chicken with corn starch before cooking. After the chicken was done, we removed it from the pan and stir fried some veggies. Then we added the chicken back to the pan before adding the sauce that we had doubled.

Made this last night and my husband asked me to put it on the "short list" of dishes to have for dinner. I shook the chicken pieces in 2T cornstarch before browning and while they were cooking, sprinkled some yellow mustard powder, kosher salt and paprika as previously noted in other reviews. I also doubled the amount of the sauce so when I added my steamed veggies for just a minute at the end they were fully coated along with the chicken. Since I steamed the veggies separately they were crisp but covered with the sauce before serving. I served it over sticky rice but it would've been great alone.  Thanks for the recipe!

9 9 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/231939/honey-glazed-chicken/  ... I made this the same night  ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/240993/lemon-garlic-chicken/ ... 'Liked 'em both!  This one, the honey one, the chicken didn't brown - as in visually.  "Hello, Olive Oil"  :/  Since I was literally cooking both at the same time, I cooked it in olive oil then when the garlic chicken was done, transferred to the pan with the remnants - brown & garlicky.  Tossed the chicken around.  Removed it & added the sauce.  'Heated, thickened with 2T cornstarch & added the chicken.  Next time, I'll be sure the cornstarch is completely cooked before adding the chicken.  It was still a bit cornstarchy.  ;)  Surprisingly lightly sweet, slightly spicy, a bit salty;  none in a bad way.  :D  The seasoned pan added garlic, salt & pepper.  Green onion would be a nice addition - or other vegetables.  Oh, had three thin breast halves (were huge & sliced 'em horizontally), but doubled the sauce & it definitely wasn't too much.  I'd venture to say the amount listed would be too little.  Pretty.  :D  'Nice to have Asian that doesn't require marinating, too.  A hit of sesame oil would be good.  :) ... 10 11 17 K, 18, 3 stars.  It's fast more than it is good, but it's good, too.  :D  'Used 1 1/2# chicken cubes & doubled the sauce.  Half would be too little.  Double was a bit too much.  :/  :)

A decent meal. Like other reviewers, I added salt,  ground mustard and paprika to the chicken and finished it (with the glaze) in the oven. Glaze was thin, but that isn't an issue for me. Overall,  a fair recipe.
Edit: I made this again, and this time, i followed the recipe as written. I prefer the original recipe. It's little heavy on the red pepper flakes. Maybe a sprinkling is enough.

First I saut√©ed the 2 chicken breast pieces rubbed with 1/2 tsp each onion salt, garlic powder and dried ginger and set aside.  Then saut√©ed broccoli and cauliflower, onion and whatever yummy vegetable available.  Set aside.  Added chicken broth to scrape up bits of yum.  Returned everything to stir fry pan and added glaze.  In the meantime I steamed a carb alternative (turnips).  I did mix some cornstarch with water and quickly added to stir fry.  Served over the turnips that I mashed with a bit of butter and cream.  I did add additional black pepper to taste.  Absolutely awesome.

This dish, though easy, was pretty rudimentary.  If you add enough soy sauce and hot sauce, the taste is pretty good.  I do like the ease of cooking and it does have a very good clean taste.  It is definitely a mid week dish with the kids.

I haven't used this recipe yet.  I will in the near future.  I would say, however, that if it's of the same quality (as I expect it to be) of all the past recipes I've found on AllRecipes.com, I am sure it will a five star rating.

I added some veggies, which may have created some water. My sauce did not thicken, but it didn't matter to me, still tasted good! I love how easy this recipe is, when you are pressed for time, it's fast.

Excellent.  Added some dried white beans that I cooked previously to the mix.  Added a nice crunchy texture.  Doubled the sauce.  So good.  Will definitely make it again.

Super fast and easy, but too sweet. I sprinkled some garlic powder when cooking the chicken (still not enough flavor for me) . The flavor of this dish was from the sauce not the chicken. Well this is a quick dish don't expect that much...

Quick easy and tasty.  I did not make any changes as  I had everything in the pantry. Served for lunch with friends and  just added a fresh salad. They all loved the chicken.

We just had it for dinner.  Although I liked it ok, I found it a bit too sweet; I had doubled the sauce to pour over the rice.  That would have contributed to the extra sweetness.  Anyway, both my husband and daughter enjoyed it very much and didn't think it was overly sweet.  So,  I would make it again, but perhaps reduce the quantity of honey.  I followed other reviewers by adding salt, pepper, mustard powder, paprika to the chicken.  I also fried some onion and garlic before adding the chicken.  Those additions were good.  All in all, it was a quick dish which I served with rice and vegetables which I did not add to the sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

Would like to know how many calories? It was really good  and fast. I squeezed half a orange in the mix and added onion flakes for more flavor.  Also poured some glaze over the asparagus.  Was delish!

The chicken cooked faster than the glaze thickened, so I removed the chicken, reduced the glaze, then poured it over the chicken.  Served over rice, and it was delicious.  Next time I think I'd add pineapple chunks for a variation.

Easy to make and easy to make into a stir fry over rice. As with most people you build off the recipe to accommodate your own tastes. But will definitely make again and appreciate the recipe.  I added sesame seed oil and cooked with safflower oil instead of olive oil.

This was good.  I used thighs and the flavor was awesome.  Paired this with roasted fingerling potatoes mixed with Brussels sprouts.   Next time I will try the chicken breasts.  A keeper for sure.

I had to up the recipe because I made more chicken than it calls for. I also used chicken breasts, not thighs. It turned out amazing! I will say I hated the way it smelled, so if you have a sensitive nose just don't trust it lol! Give it a try. The honey taste is real subtle and the red pepper flakes give it this tiny little kick that turns out to be really good. I'll definitely be making this again.

I love this as a super quick meal to make.  I added carrots and pea pods.  I wish I'd read all the reviews first because I think increasing the amount of sauce (to accommodate the veggies) and thickening it with corn starch will make it even better.

Really tasty although a touch sweet! Next time I'm fount to try adding a little citrus to try to balance it out. I made this with thin sliced chicken breast and served it over rice. The sauce was so yummy we poured the extra over the rice. Also going to double the sauce recipe next time so we have more for rice also!

Amazing.  My entire family LOVE it.
I made it twice now, the second time, I used a little bit of brown sugar instead of using so much honey and it made the sauce a little thicker. I caramelized some water chestnuts and some bell peppers with the same seasoning and added them to it, it was amazing

I think this is delicious and so easy to make. I let the chicken simmer until the sauce reduces and thickens. However, the chicken does dry out if you cook it too long. The sauce is still great.

Nice blend of sweet and hot. As another reviewer suggested, dredged the meat in flour before frying. Also used sesame oil for the flavor, and served with a sprinkling of chopped green onions. Will make again.

Delicious! I did as others suggested: seasoned chicken with salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder & garlic powder. Then lightly coated the chicken with cornstarch. When it was almost done, I then added broccoli, squash, purple onion & carrots. Then poured the sauce on top. To the sauce, I added minced garlic and a few dashes of ginger. Served over rice.

This was delicious! The only thing I did differently was adding some salt and pepper to the chicken while it was searing.

The recipe was a good starting point, but I felt it needed some stronger flavour. I start with marinating the chicken in the soya sauce, cornstarch, red pepper flakes, finely minced garlic and ginger.  That was saut√© in the oil.  When browned the honey was added, and left to simmer.   The cornstarch help to thicken the honey and let it stick to the chicken.

Did not seem to have quite enough honey or whatever is needed to get the glaze to stick to the chicken. Would need a few improvements.

Great.  I spiced the CHicken with spanish smoked paprika, Mustard powder, Garlic powder, Onion Powder, and a bit of salt and pepper.  Also added just a bit more soy sauce.  Takes a while to reduce, Make sure to give it enough time and let it set for 30 seconds after it reduces.  Careful with Red pepper flakes, my wife isnt the biggest spicy person so we will probably use a bit less next time.  All in all good.  Could be a good base to build from.

It's great and easy to make, added more chili flakes to spice it up and chicken thighs are better than breasts.

The chicken was great! I may have missed the "serving size", but I doubled this recipe, and it can feed 3, maybe 4. Unless I didn't get as much chicken as I thought? New to cooking...

I added fried rice and vegetable stir fry to this meal, and it was great!

I bought some "fancy" honey that I was not crazy about but was not about to throw it away so I decided to use it on this recipe and WOW... the end result was delish and so easy! I did think it needed some seasoning when it was done so I sprinkled some ginger powder and a little bit of salt. I think just about any seasoning you have on hand would work well. I will be using this recipe again!!!

This couldn't be any quicker or easier! And bonus - it's delicious! This will be a keeper for my family for sure. Only one small mod- I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder before the initial sauteeing. I add garlic to everything!

I'm not a good cook and I burnt the chicken, but I did my best to overlook this in my review. Not a bad recipe at all, just a little bland. I used the recommended measurements, it probably could have used more red pepper flakes and a little less soy sauce, but that's subjective. It's simple enough that I'd be more than willing to give it another shot.

I did dredge the chicken in flour and seasoned the meat with paprika, salt ,pepper, and dry mustard like it was suggested by one of the reviewers. When I make it the next time I should use chicken thighs instead of chicken breast and use more soy sauce.

Doubled the sauce and might add garlic next time to make a honey garlic chicken a d perhaps switch out the chicken for pork once in awhile to mix it up a little. Original recipe delicious though just some ideas to consider.

Super easy, even novice cooks could pull this off. I did add about 1 tbs corn starch to the sauce before adding to the pan. Once I allowed the sauce to boil it became very thick and sticky and was a perfect glaze. I will make it again and probably double the sauce so I have extra for the restaurant style fried rice (also from this website).

I made this for my son who doesn't like hot foods, so I left out the pepper. I'm a vegetarian. I also coated the chicken chunks with corn starch as someone suggested and the result was a nice, crunchy crust. I also used Tamari instead of soy sauce so it was not nearly as salty.
When I looked down in the pan, I thought I was going to have the same problem as others mentioned of a watery glaze. I just let it cook, and in 5-10 minutes, it was a perfect glaze.
Lots of tips in the conversations here to spread across lots of different glazed bits.

Very quick and easy. I cooked the chicken, added the sauce then removed the chicken and boiled the sauce until thickened then added the chicken back in. The chicken was nicely glazed. Served with brown rice. Will make again.

Quick, easy, and tasty.  Added carrots, onion, and broccoli. Thickened sauce with a touch of cornstarch.  Served over basmati rice.

I didn't deviate from the recipe.  I used each ingredient in the proper amount, maybe it was because I used soy sauce packets from the Chinese restaurant, the flavors didn't unite well at all even after whisking well. My suggestion is to taste the mixed liquid ingredients before putting them on the chicken to make sure you like it.

I made the suggested changes by dredging the chicken in flour with smoked paprika and garlic powder. I also added stir fry veggies and doubled the sauce. My family finished every bit even my tiny soon to be daughter in law. Loved it and so quick and simple.

this recipe was very simple and didn't take long which is great for me since I don't get home some nights til 530. the only thing I would change next time is seasoning the chicken and adding some garlic to the sauce. I paired it with rice and next time I would definitely add some veggies to the mix as well.

The best thing about this recipe is how simple and quick it is to make. The flavor was great. My only complaint is that I expected the sauce to thicken, since it's supposed to be a glaze. Mine stayed a watery consistency. I'll definitely make it again, but I might add a little cornstarch to the sauce while cooking.

I found the sauce was not getting thick so I added a little bit of Cornstarch in when it was done cooking and it was perfect. There were no left overs.

SO EASY! Dredged the chicken in corn starch before cooking and added a tablespoon of minced garlic to the sauce. Also used boneless-skinless chicken thighs. Next time I will add stir fry veggies and double the sauce.

It was ok. As other reviewers suggested, I sprinkled salt and pepper on the chicken and coated in corn starch. Then I followed the recipe exactly. The glaze still didn't thicken much and we're just not into the soy sauce flavor. I'll probably repeat it using corn starch in the sauce and and alternate flavor- perhaps honey BBQ.

This was a good starting recipe that accommodated changes/additions.  I added 3 small cloves of garlic, garlic powder and lots of rice vinegar. USED not quite 1/4 c. honey, glad I reduced a little.  Browned chicken, which I salted,  peppered and sprinkled paprika on,  in peanut oil for more flavor. ADDED a little cornstarch to thicken. Wish I had doubled the recipe!! Yummy!

I followed the exact recipe the first time and thought it was a little boring. So, the second time I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and added sesame seeds toward the end. I found that the seeds added a little touch that brought the dish to a higher level. I do not recommend anyone using clove honey. I used raw unfiltered honey. The more pure, the better the result.

We loved this!  So quick and easy to make.  I used equal amounts of honey and soy sauce.  After reading some of the reviews about the glaze being a bit runny, I coated the chicken pieces in corn starch before stir frying them.  The sauce then thickened as it cooked with the chicken.  It wasn't runny at all.

Let me start off by I'm a beginner cook... and loving this website and app. Now about the chicken absolutely loved it but next time will not put as much pepper it was a little to hot for everyone else in the household. I made a stir-fry to go along with it so that toned the temperature down alot on the chicken I mixed the chicken and the veggies together and it tasted alot better. Also the honey sauce was a little runny so I did thicken it with a small amount of flour maybe a tbsp or so. So all in all great recipe just to get started on the basics but the food will probably need to be modified to your liking.

I read the reviews and made changes accordingly.  I added salt, fresh ground pepper, 1/4 tsp of ground mustard, paprika and ground mustard to the raw chicken (used 3 chicken breast halves).  Saute in oil until a nice brown color then set aside.  I then added to the pan about 1/2 cup of shredded carrots and 5 chopped green onions.  Sauted those for a couple minutes then added chicken back in pan. Poured in honey sauce, thickening with cornstarch and water, cooking about 5 minutes more. Really yummy.  Served my family of three.  I didn't prepare any sides so we ate it all. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good! I doubled the honey and soy. It cooked very quickly. Just what I needed after getting home late from work.

Good recipe, I  doubled the sauce, and added stir fry vegetables
And served over rice. The sauce was a little thin but worked well with the rice. Will make again

The flavor was good. Once I added the glaze to the chicken it became very thin and soup like consistency. Next time I will add some cornstarch like other have suggested to thicken it up some more.

cut down amount of soy sauce in order to get the glaze, otherwise you end up with looks like just soy sauce sitting in the bottom of the pan. tastes great!

This was delicious. I made it almost exactly as the recipe stated. My only changes were to add some Adobo seasoning and I let the chicken marinate in the sauce for a fewhours before cooking together. Also, I doubled the amount of sauce and didn't cut my chicken into strips. I served it over top of homemade chicken gravy and a side of rice pilaf. I will probably make it again but add more red pepper if I do.

I love this recipe I used a hit of lemon & pepper season salt instead of the red pepper and it was amazingly good. The homey mixed with soy evens out the sweetness. Very nice!!!

This is SOOOO good! Yes the glaze doesn't "stick" to the chicken, but it's incredible how simple and easy this recipe is. I am a college student so my budget is tight. Making this with simple ingredients was great! I did leave out the red flakes and I let the chicken sit in the sauce with the heat off for a few minutes to make sure all the flavor would be absorbed. Will make again!

I loved this recipe!!  I used less say sauce and I drained the chicken liquid and oil liquid before adding the honey sauce and boiled it until the sauce had become a reddish brown!!  I think it could have used some sugar with the honey next time I will add brown sugar and try it with that!!

The honey flavor was kind of overpowering and I didn't feel there were enough other elements bridging the space between the flavors of the honey and soy sauce.  The end result was somewhat awkward tasting and difficult to pair with sides.

Ate this last night. We coupled it with rice and mixed vegetables. Very delicious; sweet and spicy! I was raving about it all last night. Most people will already have the ingredients--which is great.
We had fun "deboning" chicken breasts. Overall YUM!

This was quick and easy.  I think I'll add pineapple and/or garlic next time. Sauce was not as thick as I would prefer. But overall, we all liked it.  Thank you!

This was really good and versatile. I added the rind of an orange and cooked the chicken in oil infused with chili peppers. I will make it again.

Definitely double this recipe. Red bell pepper and Chinese five spice are great additions. I didn't have red pepper flakes so I added a little cayenne pepper after cooking and it was great!

Tried this recipe last week and I already want to make it again! Super quick and easy to make, low on mess and such amazing flavour. Only change I made was adding a little bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce. Oh and I added some diced red pepper too. Definitely going to be a regular meal in my house :)

My mom and I absolutely loved this. We seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and seasoning salts and also threw some ginger into the sauce. I'll be making extra sauce this time so we don't have to fight over it lol.

I'd love this with a pinch of smoked sea salt.  Love the salty sweet combos, but the hint of smoke would knock this out of the park.

Delicious recipe. I add orange extract to the honey mixture. Also sometimes I'll cook the sauce off with the chicken to give it a thicker glaze

This is really tasty. I modified the original recipe, though. I got a bag of the frozen stir fry veggies, and one of sugar peas. I stir fried them in some oil, and added a couple of cloves of garlic. I cooked the chicken in another skillet. When the chicken was done, I put it in with the veggies, mixed it all up, then added the honey sauce. You really need to cook the sauce down, and it took longer than five minutes. That might be because I made a double recipe of the sauce to account for the veggies. Worked out great.

So I used chicken thighs instead of breasts, so I don't know how much better it is than the breasts, but it's pretty good.

came out fantastic! was done in under 15 minutes, and my goodness was it delicious. cooked it for me and my mom for dinner tonight to prove that eating healthy meals don't have to be bland and take hours to make, and I definitely got that point across tonight :-) followed the recipe as is- it was perfect. served it with some brown rice and saut√©ed carrots on the side, scrumptious!!! will definitely be making this a staple for quick chicken-based dinners. so, so easy. and so, so good. can't go wrong. p.s- you could even make this healthier by switching the honey out for agave, just a thought!

Tastes like hogi yogi chicken bowl. Beware though, it's pretty strong.

Quick easy meal. Not the best I've ever made but it was good over some brown rice.

Me and my family loved this recipe. The only thing i did differently was I used whole bone in chicken breast, and took the skin off. I doubled the recipe because I used 4 whole breast. The recipe itself I followed the recipe as directed just doubled it. And of course I cooked it a little longer.

Very easy to make. I added an extra chicken breast. So I mixed up a little extra sauce. Kinda hard to mess up the sauce too. Very good dinner.

Really nice.  We added a few shakes of poultry seasoning to the chicken as it was browning, and ate it with brown rice pilaf and broccoli.
