I made this for my daughter's French class Christmas fete.  Yes it is alot of work but worth it. I followed other tips like beating the egg yolks a good 5 minutes, greasing the parchment paper very well and I put quite a bit of powdered sugar on the dish towel before rolling.  I had enough of the mousse left over to decorate.  Here's what I did and it was beautiful (will post a photo later).  I cut one end of the log (about 4") at an angle.  Frost the sides, top and bottom and use some mousse to "glue" on the stump (piece cut off earlier) then frost the stump as well except for the top. Next run fork tines across the log and upward on the stump so you have ridges like a log. Then dust with powdered sugar and decorate with holly or mistletoe or pine sprigs.  I also made mushrooms from chocate truffles stuck onto a piece of broken candy cane rubbed with chocolate, and dipped in powdered sugar.

This cake received applause at our Christmas dinner.  And, it should have.  After all, my mother and I had to make it twice.  Let me explain.  You MUST BEAT the egg yolks and sugar until they are very pale.  For all of you Texas Aggies out there, BTHO the egg yolks.  Let the electric mixer run at the highest speed for at least 5 minutes.  Because this cake contains no rising agents like baking powder or yeast, its "fluffy-ness" depends upon the amount of air that you "BEAT" into it - hence the stiff egg whites and the pulverized egg yolks. 

We decorated the cake with whipping cream and homemade mushrooms (hershey kisses and small marshmallows on toothpicks - with red gel polka dots).

Wow, this was so tasty! Thanks to 1. the reviewers who recommended spraying the parchment paper with non-stick spray, 2. the reviewer who emphasized the importance of beating the eggs enough, 3. the reviewer who suggested rolling out gumdrops to make holly leaves, and 4. the reviewer who suggested using a fork to make lines that looked like tree bark. My bûche turned out like a work of art! And did I mention it was really tasty? Wow!!

I made this two days ago for the holidays. Incredible outcome! For anyone who has had trouble, make sure to follow all of the instructions AND the hints on the allrecipes page for this recipe. Remember, baking is a SCIENCE. There is NO FLOUR in this recipe! If you aren't getting the desired outcome, you are probably not beating the egg yolks/whites long enough. If there is no flour in something you are going to need to whip more air into the eggs to make the cake fluffy in the oven. Also make sure to let it cool a little bit before you try to roll it. The cake needs to set/solidify. Make sure to grease your pan, and make sure to use parchment paper and a towel coated in powdered sugar! Just basic hints, here, folks. If you care to see how mine turned out, click on the "Photos" and check for katelovesbaking's photo, its toward the end. :) For the mushrooms, I googled for a meringue mushroom recipe. It's very easy. I used a ziplock bag to pipe my meringue. For the green and red holly leaves/berries, my mum took gum drops and rolled them flat, and then used a knife to cut out the shapes! Good luck and have fun baking! :)

This recipe was delicious.  Only thing I do have  to recommend is to spray the parchment paper, otherwise you will never get it off....highly recommend this recipe to anyone, and it may become a new christmas tradition in our house...

This recipe was easier than I had thought. The cake is dense and wonderfully chocolaty and chocolate whipped cream.....how can you go wrong. Made this for my Mom's birthday and it was thoroughly enjoyed.  Try this recipe...you won't regret it.  (Make sure you let the cake cool at least 10 minutes before turning it out on the towel)

This was a really good recipe, I wish I could give it 4.5 stars instead of 4.  I down graded it because it needed to be a little more clear. The cake was nice and moist and my French students loved it! Here is what you need to know: 1. Grease the pan and the paper. 2. Beat the egg yolks until they are very very pale. The egg whites should be stiff enough to stand on the spatula. 3. Make sure the cake springs in the middle not just the edges. 4. Dust with lots of powdered sugar. 5. When you roll with the towel, roll the towel inside of the cake.  If you use the towel to roll the cake onto itself, it will stick and you might have issues. 6. Prepare this a day ahead. It is so much better the next day!  Thank you for the recipe. It is a keeper!

Very rich, but who cares!!! When serving, after dushing with powder sugar, we topped ours off with sliverd almonds, but could also try shaved chocolate. We experienced the cake sticking to the dishtowel, so will dust heavier next time.

Like a chocolate omelete with whipped cream. This recipe was identical to a recipe in one of my cook books except the flour was missing in this one....wanted to try with all the good reviews...But this was NOT what I hoped.

I would be lying if I said I didn't follow any other reviewers' tips. I beat the yolks 5-6 min on my Kitchenaid's highest speed, sprayed parchment paper with Pam, cooled the cake 10 minutes before turning out onto powered Silpat, cut off one end to make a stump, iced the outside with the cream and used a fork to make log marks, toasted some coconut to scatter around as snow covered dirt; meant to brush the cake with cream de cocoa but forgot, darnit. Anyway, with all these tips and a few of my own (cut a slice off both ends to get rid of the crusty edges and for a nice, smooth, clean look whether or not you want a stump; there is plenty of whipped cream to spread on the cake as well as to ice it with–I even had some left over; I did not bring eggs to room temp as I figured beating those yolks on high speed would warm them up fast enough and I've always heard you need cold whites to make a good cream; I always sift my powdered sugar and cocoa first before adding to a recipe), I could not believe how awesome this cake turned out my first go 'round. Directions (along with tips) were easy to follow and I didn't find it terribly time consuming or taxing on my bowls. Whip whites in large bowl as you have to add the yolks later. Be sure to parchment paper the whole pan as the cake batter does fill the darned thing all the way up to the top. I had just cut a piece for the bottom like a stoop. But I really sprayed everything with Pam so it turned out okay. Check out my pic.

This recipe was very, VERY rich. I did some adjusting on the cream to make it a bit sweeter. I found it to be much too rich for my taste, but everyone else found this recipe to be a delight.

I took this yule log to a Christmas gathering last year and was asked to bring it again this year.  It sounds intimidating, but really isn't that hard.  Last year I turned the cake out on to a tea towel, which worked pretty well, until it came time to do the laundry...then I had to deal with dried pieces of chocolate cake stuck all over the towel.  This year I had the brilliant idea of using my silicone baking mat instead of the towel to roll the cake for cooling.  It worked!  I dusted it with confectioner's sugar as suggested for the towel.  The cake came off perfectly and no weird laundry!  I iced the outside with the extra filling, made holly leaves and berries out of red and green "fruit slice" candy and put them on top of snow made from some of the filling recipe I saved before adding the cocoa.  This recipe makes me look like an expert baker!

I made this for Christmas this year and the entire family loved it.  My husband said it was the best dessert I had EVER made. I have to admit, however, that  I was skeptical when I took it out of the oven..it seemed so thin,  but it rolled up nicely.  I scored it with a fork to make it look like a log.  I only dusted it with powdered sugar added a few candied cherries for decoration. If you like chocolate, keep the recipe as is.  It would be wonderful for anyone who has celiac disease, as it is gluten free.  I know my family now expects this every year for Christmas!!

Now it's Easter...and  my family want "the Buche" back..now, it's "Buche de Pacques"...I omitted the cocoa powder in the filling..so it was just vanilla. Then, I made more whipped cream and frosted the  whole log and decorated with peeps and jelly beans on the side. It was awesome!  Lighter and not as chocolatey as the Christmas version. "Best dessert in 20 years of marriage" raved my husband!

It wasn't all that difficult and the results were outstanding! Just remember the basic whipping rules; eggs at room temp, whites without a drop of yolk or grease, yolk beaten till lemon yellow, and your cream should be ice cold. Watch that time on the cake. I pulled it out at exactly 12 mins. I frosted mine with "Chocolate Ganache"  from this site.

I am very happy I chose this recipe.  I admit I was a bit skeptical about the no flour in this recipe and almost opted not to make it but I love the texture and how it turned out. I was scared after unrolling the "cake" part, it looked horrible, but after I put in the filling and re-rolled it, it did look just like a log!! I opted to ice the outside with the chocolate whip cream filling from this recipe and used another recipe found here: Yule-Log for the filling inside. I am so glad I did! Turned out wonderfully festive and everyone loved it.. I will start making this every year now. I look forward to finding little trinkets throughout the year to add to the log. I couldnt find any this year so all I added was a sprig of holly and a few maraschino cherries for the berries. Cant wait to make this again!

This cake was a little extra work, but really fabulous and everyone loved it.  I didn't frost mine, and I feel like it would have been too sweet if I had.  I dusted the towel with confectioner's sugar (very generously) before turning the cake onto it AND dusted the cake before rolling.  It kind of looked like a birch log when I finished, so I cut a piece of copy paper into narrow triangular strips, laid them across the cake and gave it an extra dusting of confectioner's sugar.  I also added some extra striations with a vegetable peeler.  I've uploaded the picture to share.  This one might become a yearly tradition!

In gathering up my Christmas dessert recipes, I simply cannot wait to make this again this year.  For those who have not tried this, PLEASE--make this dessert!  It is easy and fun--and the end results are spectacular!  Everyone will think you spend DAYS making this! As an extra, I toasted some coconut and placed it on the bottom of the plate to look like snowy soil.  In addition, I did use fork tines to make the frosting look like tree bark.  This is an impressive dessert!

It is a cake that can really impress everyone! I got the holy leaves from the neighbors fence (it looks like one) and I used glace cherries for the berries. I baked the  muschroom shaped cookies (cap + stem,  stick them with cream). It turns out really well and it's really nice as seen in the picture!

The cake was REALLY good, but it was a liitle more difficult than I had intended.  The cake didn't come off of the parchment paper very easier.  Everything worked out fine, though, besides the parchment paper deal.  Very good tasting cake, my french teacher and class loved it!

I love the presentations of the traditional buche.  I tried making one back when I was twenty.  I ended up trying three times and I failed.  This time I was determined to be successful.  I beat the yolks for about 5 min--this is necessary to ensure that the cake is not too dense and chewy; something I wish someone had told me whan I was 20.  I beat the whites til stiff and shiny.  I baked on parchment paper lined cookie sheet.  I used the cream in this recipe for the filling, but I knew that my BF would need something sweeter for the frosting.  He has a major sweet tooth so I used the Chocolate Butter-Creme Frosting recipe from this site to frost the outside.   I also cut off a branch at an angle from the end and placed it atop the buche.  Enfin, un grand succes!

I made two buche de noel's last year this one and a martha stewart one, I must say this one was easier, looked nicer, and had a much better mousse.  The cake however was not as good, I must agree w/ others it was quite eggy but that is probably what made it easier to roll.  The eggyness of the cake is the only reason it didn't get 5 stars.

It was delicious and looked great. Maybe the next time I use half of the filling to spread on the sponge cake and te other half as frosting with confectioner sugar.

The cake turned out great but when I got the whipped cream mixture out of the refridgerator it was no longer stiff.  Don't know what I did wrong.  I rewhipped it and added a packet of unflavored gelatine.  It kept it's stiffness then.
I will use this recipe again but I will always add gelatine.

I loved this recipe.  It was easy to make and it looks beautiful.  I especially love the chocolate whipped cream filling.All will love this if you make it. I've had this at French bakeries before and I like this recipe much better.

I followed the recipe exactly and my cake turned out beautifully.   I was worried that the filling was not sweet enough, but after the cake was completely constructed it tasted plenty sweet.  I would recommend greasing your pan and parchment...I did not, and although I was able to remove the parchment paper, it was a very delicate and scary process.  I made my cake 2 days before serving it and kept it in the fridge, wrapped up tight in plastic wrap.  Before serving I covered the cake with the remaining filling and used a fork to rake "bark" lines and then heavily dusted with powdered sugar.  I'll post a picture.  Thank you for this recipe!

The recipe is delicious and easy. Definitely grease between the parchment and the pan, and then the top of the parchment as well. The cake will fluff up higher than the edges of the pan, but then shrink as it cools. I made some extra cream (doubled recipe) and covered the outside as well, texturing it so it looked log-like. I made sure there was one meringue mushroom per person. Added a couple of sprigs of real greenery, and a dusting of cocoa. It was a huge hit. Lots of whipped cream, but no one complained!

This is a great recipe. I made a variation on it years ago that used only five eggs instead of six, and I prefer this one.
  When I made it long ago, my mother convinced me that wax paper was a good substitute for parchment paper. Not true! Now I know why I had such a hard time peeling the paper from the cake all those years ago. The parchment paper is a MUST. I sprayed it with cooking spray and had no trouble at all in removing it from the cake.
  When I made the filling, I waited to add the cocoa.  I used around half of the filling inside the roll, and then I added cocoa to what remained and spread it over the roll. I then ran fork-tines through it to make it look a bit like bark. Also, when I cut one of the ends off of the log, I then attached it to the side of the log to make it look like a branch. When it was "frosted" with the chocolate whipped cream, it looked perfect. Putting the whipped cream on the outside was an extremely simple step and made the Buche de Noel look that much more special. It was absolutely DELICIOUS!
It is IMPORTANT to remember to whip those eggs for a long time. Remember that you can't have ANY egg yolks mixed in with your egg whites when you first whip them, otherwise they'll never whip up as light and fluffy as you need them to be. It also helps to have the eggs at room temperature so that they whip up more easily.
We made two... one for my son's French class and one for us. They were both absolutely beautiful and were big hits.

This was very tasty.  However, unless you already have 3 "large bowls" suitable for mixing, you have some hassle with washing bowls and transferring e.g. the whipped cream mixture to a medium bowl so you can re-use the bowl for another step.

This yule log was decadent! The cake itself wasn't so sweet, but when frosted with chocolate butter cream, it became very rich. The cake part cracked when I unrolled it from the towel, but no one noticed after I filled and frosted it. I halved the whipped cream portion of the recipe, but I barely had enough. Next time I'll use 1 1/2 c. whipping cream. This was so delicious, and I'll definitely be making it again!

Just perfect! I followed the recipe exactly, and beat the egg yorks for a good five minutes on the highest speed of the mixture, and it could not have been more spongy! Thanks for a great recipe, this one is a keeper for sure!!

We made this recipe for Christmas Eve. A perfect recipe--very easy for a Buche de Noel. I made it with my two daughters. Since they wanted frosting, we put canned chocolate frosting on the top and made lines with a knife in the frosting to make it look like a "log". We then flattened green gumdrops with a rolling pin and cut them to look like  holly leaves and sliced red gumdrops to make "berries" .With these placed on our log, It looked marvelous and tasted heavenly, better than any other Buche de Noel I've had!

Bakeries charge a fortune for these cakes so this was my motivation.  I was amazed at how easy this was to make.  A KitchenAid mixer is a 'must have' to make short work of this cake.  I followed the recipe exactly and used the filling as the frosting also.  I doubled the recipe and made a single log with multiple branches.  Absolutely delicious and a big hit at the holiday party.  Make sure to make the Meringue Mushrooms on allrecipes as the perfect garnish. (They are fun to make and much easier than I expected.)

This is very yummy.  I followed a reviewer's suggestion to whip the dickens out of the yolks, as well as the whites, to get as much air into them as possible, and you could tell that it worked as it looked like it was going to overflow the pan as it baked!  But all remained within.  It did reduce to a fairly normal height as it came out of the oven.
It was easy to roll.  I opted to roll it along the long side instead of the short (so as to have as long a log as possible) but this only gave it a 4-5" diameter, so more or a branch. LOL  But still, it was the full 15" long of my pan.
I was running low on heavy cream, so modified that and simply folded it into a whipped chocolate  buttercream.  
Very yummy!

This was not as difficult of an undertaking as I thought.  It turned out beautifully.  However, my number one tip would be to combine about a quarter of the egg white mixture into the yolk mixture before folding it all together.  This lightens up the the consistency of the yolk mixture (which is still quite heavy even when whipped) and makes combining the whites and yolks a bit easier.  You really have to be careful not to deflate your eggs.  I've seen this done by Martha Stewart, Bobby Flay, Alton Brown, etc.  I also added just about a quarter cup of cake flour at this point, just to give it a little more substance.  I put a little less cocoa in my whipped cream, and then made a chocolate ganache icing to spread over top.  Way delicious.

For some reason, I was intrigued by the idea of making a yule log this year.  When I came across this recipe, I figured I would go for it.  I'm so glad that I did!  This cake was much easier to make than I thought it would be.  I used a silicon baking mat for the cake and rolled it onto parchment paper.  After filling it, I topped the cake with chocolate ganache.  It looked great and tasted even better.  This will be a new tradition in my house!  Thanks!

Initially I didn't believe that you could make a cake without flour, but according to the Cooks' Encyclopedia, it's all about the power of eggs. Now all I can say is, you've gotta try it to believe it! The cake was entirely melt-in-the-mouth.  Only thing is, as DH said, beware the cholesterol...
I greased and floured my greaseproof paper before pouring the batter in, and had minimal issues with tearing the paper off later. Also turned out the cake onto a piece of greaseproof paper  dusted with icing sugar and rolled it up, worked fine. And used a Whip Topping from my local bakery supplier for the frosting. Can't wait till Xmas Eve to present it to my relatives!

I love this recipe as did my family and friends. I used the leftover filling to coat the outside to make it really look like a log. I used a metal frosting spatula to creat the wavy look of bark and then decorated it with candy holly leaves and berries (these can be found in the baking aisle of the grocery store, but oly at Christmas time...at least where I'm from).

Absolutely sensational! I did have a little trouble gettig the cake off the dishtowel - next time I'll use more powdered sugar. However, a little powdered sugar on top covered up any imperfections and the flavor was fantastic! The cake was nice and springy and the filling was creamy and extremely rich. It was gone in less than two days. This is a wonderful recipe if you are cooking for someone who is gluten intolerant as well. I will definitely be making this again, and next time I'll probably make two.

This recipe is great for chocolate lovers.  I think the cake should cool for more than 30 minutes.  Ours crumbled up.  Be careful unrolling it!  Put the filling on top as icing, too.  Add smashed peppermint candy canes for a minty taste.  YUM!

I am in high school and I made this for my French Class Christmas party. I did it on a Thursday night, with limited time. We heard many reviews saying it was very hard to make and the cake would crack or break. However I found that if I did not rush anything, I turned out perfectly, except for one small crack in the side, which was only about an inch long. We ate a slice to taste test it, and my family loved it and its a great recipe

Putzy but well-worth it. This was a wonderfully light dessert following our heavy Christmas meal. I used a little bit bigger pan than the recipe suggested so I adjusted the baking time a bit, but it still turned out wonderfully!

I thought this was a great "first timer" recipe.  I have never made this before and felt that it was pretty easy.  There is no recipe for the "icing" or the Meringue Mushrooms so I had to go on a search for that, but honestly this was a very light and yummy dessert.  I omitted the cocoa from the whipped cream and left it subtly sweet.  Thank you!

Great recipe, very chocolatey cake.  Followed the recipe exactly, pretty easy to prepare.  And very close to the "real" buche de noel in France.  Will definitely make this recipe again...  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious and quite easy to make. I made this for Christmas Eve and everyone loved it. It takes like a mousse cake. I took another reviewers advice and beat the hell out of the yolks-until it looked liked melted butter. I used the whipped cream for filling and had plenty to frost the cake. I decorated with fresh cranberries and mint leaves to resemble holly. Turned out delicious and very pretty!

This was great!! I'm so excited at how well this came out. I just tried to make a buche noel with a cake mix doctor recipe and it cracked in a bunch of places and wouldn't roll, a major disappointing disaster. So I tried this one and it was perfect! No cracks looked great. I followed other suggestions, I buttered the jelly roll and parchment (but I'm sure pan is good too), made sure egg whites were very stiff (5min), and I cooled the cake about 5 min before turning out of pan but ran the knife around the edge right away. I used a sifter to dust the towel with. This recipe was great and even more gratifying after having one fail.
Oh, since my family isn't into rich desserts I used plain whip cream with brandy mixed in for the filling and chocolate for the outside.

This turned out beautifully,considering I've never made a "log cake" before. Rave reviews from everyone! However, I did make my own chocolate frosting in place of the powdered sugar.

This one is kind of a pain to make BUT so very worth the effort! Use fresh eggs, and be sure to refrigerate to keep that "eggy" taste away. We like to add more sugar to the frosting to sweeten it up a bit as it can be quite powerfully cocoa  tasting. Decorating this cake is a fun holiday tradition for us. We like to dust it with confectioners sugar to make it look like snow, but don't do that until you're ready to present/serve it as it will get a bit clumpy and not as attractive.

I have made this 3 times.  Frankly, this is better than ANY other version of a Buche de Noel that I've ever tried.  The cake is so delicate, and the mousse is to die for.  Everyone loves this cake when I make it.

I really enjoyed this recipe, it was so like and yummy tasting.   The only thing that I didn't like is that the cake was so thin after you rolled it.  I would have liked a thicker cake portion.  So the next time that I make this I will be making 2 cakes and try rolling them together to see if that better.  The one thing that I did was I iced it with a chocolate icing from a can, I won't be doing that again as it make the cake waaay to sweet for some.

I am French and when I was young my mom always purchased a log for Christmas.  Living in the US now it is difficult  for me to find a pastry shop who makes it and it is usually very expensive.  This recipe was so easy to follow and the result was "delicieux".  My mom was ver impressed  and could not believe I had made it myself.  Thank you.  I will recommend it.

Just made my first Buche de Noel, and it was incredibly fun!  It is the most creative dessert I've ever tried, and the decorating was delightful.  The bits and pieces I "tasted" along the way prove the whole thing will be a tremendous success at today's Christmas dinner.  I added a chocolate granache to the outside and striated it with a fork to make it look like a real log.  Also used holly leaves and some branches from a fir tree to decorate with maraschino cherries.  The whole thing looks so elegant.

I made this with a quarter cup of sugar in the egg yolks, and it was perfect.  One of the guests said, "This is better than restaurant quality."  I also made a dairy free version by whipping soft tofu instead of cream, and not frosting it.  Marzipan mushrooms and shelf fungus perfected it.

Wow!  This turned out perfect!  I am not a pro, but I had 3 people ask me if they could hire me to make it for them.  I frosted to look like a log.  Added fondant holly.  Beautiful!

This cake was, in my opinion, amazing. I had never made a buche de noel before, so I was excited and a little nervous, but it came out very well! It makes a fair amount, and the chocolate whipped cream is delicious! My parents' only complaint was that the cake was a bit eggy, which might have just been my fault, we'll see next time. I also made marzipan mushrooms to go with the cake. ^-^

Very light. Always a hit at whatever party I bring it to. I find it easier to travel with it when wrapped in saran wrap completely and placed on a plate. Can be dressed up on location and that prevents further cracking.

Made this for Christmas eve and it was a huge success. I took a tip from another reviewer and rolled it with a silpat mat, fabulous. Made meringue mushrooms to decorate it. It did crack while I was rolling but I was able to hide it with the cream. I found the cream a bit too 'cocoa' and next time will use melted semisweet chocolate for the cream. I will definitely make this cake again as it was light and meltingly delish.

The recipe sounded intimidating but it was surprisingly easy. The cake was fabulous, everyone complimented me on it.

Parchment paper is a requirement for this recipe. I sprayed it with PAM for Baking and the cake practically slid off the paper.

I made this cake for a competition in my french class. I coated it in chocolate frosting, then made the frosting darker and made little swirls and lines, so it would look like a real log. Then I attached a decorative tip to the frosting applicator to make a bunch of little leaves, and made bunches of litle cherries. After all that, I lightly dusted it with powdered sugar. It was sooooooo yummy and I got 2nd place for decoration!

The directions are written clearly, if you follow them exactly you shouldn’t have a problem.  When I served it on Christmas Eve my family raved about it, including my husband and his father who both lived in France.  The one thing is… when a couple friends tried it several days later they said it was “eggy” tasting.  So, maybe this recipe doesn’t keep well.

The cake for this yule log turned out really light and fluffy. Overall, the recipe made a very rich and decadent dessert. However, it was too rich for my taste and I wish I had reduced the amount of whipped cream/cocoa mixture I added. Although it was time-consuming and a tad complicated, the cake turned out to be beautiful and what can be more festive than a yule log?

This recipe is SUPER DELICIOUS! I think everyone would have eaten the whole thing if they could...seriously! Only a few quick tips: 1) Make a bit more filling, and use it to ice the log. I just added 1/2 cup more cream, and 1/4 cup more sugar, along with a tablespoon or so of Hershey's chocolate syrup:) 2) I'm only 12, and have a hard time separating the eggs, so here's an easy trick I like to use;) When separating the egg yolks, crack the egg onto a saucer,  and use the rubber top of a baster (or a clean empty water bottle if you don't have one, don't worry if it looks a little smaller than the yolk), squeeze and sort of suction cup it on to the yolk. Then release. The yolk will have squeezed into it! Wait for all of the white to come back out, and then squeeze the yolk into the bowl. 3) When you're about to blend the eggs and sugar, make superfine sugar by sticking it in the blender on high for about 30 sec. It dissolves easier;) I gotta go now, We're having guests tonight, and I'm making another one of these!!! Enjoy!

Last year I paid $45 for a store bought Buche de Noel. This year I made my own following this easy recipe and our Christmas dessert was even better than last year's! I took the advice of other reviewers and beat the heck out of the eggs for about 6 minutes and generously sprayed the pan and parchment paper with Pam, which is super important. For the frosting I added a 1/2 cup of melted semi-sweet chocolate chips and a tablespoon of Rum just so it was a little darker than the inside frosting. It was a definite hit!

This is an excellent recipe. I used one cup of heavy cream and one cup of baileys brand cream (with irish cream in it).  It was a really nice addition.  It's very important to whip the eggs until thick and fluffy.  I imagine that some of the other reviews that complain about the texture didn't beat the egg long enough, or were not careful when folding the egg yolks with the egg whites (omelete!? did you whip the eggs at all??).  When you fold the two parts together I find it helpful to use a spatula and mix only until the colours are blended.  I also didn't have a pan that was exactly the right dimensions.  Mine is 9.5' x 13.5'.  I lined with parchment paper and then sprayed the paper and the sides with cake release spray.  I still used most of the batter, so it did rise a lot.  I remedied this by putting on a clean silicone oven mit and actually patting down the cake a bit after it had cooked for the recommended time, I then cooked it for a few minutes longer.  I think the flavour is very nice, it is rich but I would disagree with other reviews that say it tastes like eating cocoa powder.  I also iced mine with chocolate buttercream, which made it a bit sweeter.  I decorated it with chocolate leaves and marzipan and fondant mushrooms and acorns.  I think it may be my favourite cake I have made so far.  The video was also very helpful.

This recipe was great and super easy to do!  I made a few changes to fit our tastes.  We did vanilla whipped cream for the center instead of chocolate.  And to frost the outside I did a dark chocolate ganache.  I used a fork to make lines in the chocolate to make it look like bark, put it on a bed of green colored coconut (grass) and topped it with sifted powdered sugar for snow.  It was so pretty, and the ganache was very pretty.

This was incredibly good. Could some one tell me if I could use round cake pans to make this a year round confection. My family is in love with this recipe.

My family was stunned when they saw the Buche.  Not only were they shocked at how pretty it was but they were amazed at how great it tasted.  I made a cocoa buttercream frosting to go with it.  The cake is so rich that it probably doesn't need it, although it does help with the looks.  Perfect luxury for the gluten free folks in your life.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I agree with those who suggested spraying the parchment paper. It does help. That said, the product was extremely difficult to roll -- it kept cracking. The refrigeration helped keep it all together...and my family raved about it. While I swore I'd never make it again due to dealing with the cracking, I may change my mind after the family feedback and tasting it myself. It truly is a fine holiday treat.

Lots of ways to hide your mistakes (and I made a lot, even dropping the cake and rescuing it just before it hit the floor).  Happily there was more than sufficient filling to "ice" cake.  Clutch marks couldn't be seen.  I added a sprig of holly with red berries.  Very pretty.  Guests all loved it.  Four stars only because it's such a pain to assemble.

This recipe was fairly easy -- BUT -- I used my kitchenaid mixer on high to beat the egg yolks (5mins) & then the egg whites (3+mins), individually of course. It was simple to put it all together just sooo time consuming. Beat the eggs forever, (i only have one mixing bowl - so transfer yolk mixture, wash & beat egg whites, fold mixture together carefully to not lose any air, bake, roll, cool, fill, cool, frost, cool - refrigerate... It was definitely worth it for an added dessert at Xmas Eve dinner, but for me this recipe is going to be reserved for Xmas & possibly Easter.... any possibly upon special request. :)

I made this for our dinner club Christmas Party.  It took me a couple of tries to get it right, but it was a hit.  I used some of the helpful hint from other folks including really whipping the egg whites (6 plus minutes on highest speed), and greasing the pan and parchment paper well.  Fun cake!

Hmmm, I am an experienced baker and I have made this cake in years past, but this did not turn out for me.  The cake was very thin and ripped and could not be used.  Not sure what I did wrong - I followed the recipe exactly.

This is outstanding! The chocolate filling is soooo rich and tasty. Easy to do also as long as you use the parchment paper in the pan and follow instructions. Don't dust it until JUST before serving as I found the powdered sugar just dissolved into it otherwise.

So good and so surprisingly easy! I did make a double batch of filling and use some to frost my cake - it just added to the presentation and, after all, you can never have too much chocolate whipped cream. It was a huge success at my Christmas Eve dinner.

I made the recipe as written and it came out great. The only thing I didn't do was use the dish towel to turn out the cake- the fibers in the towel would have stuck to the cake so I just used anther piece of parchment paper.  The batter was fluffy and wonderful looking. After it cooked for 13 minutes, it was still spongey and great. Next year I will get more fancy with decorating- this year was a test run and Yummy!! So good

I made this for my family Christmas dinner, and it was a BIG hit! I'd never made a real French dessert before, so I was a bit hesitant to try since it was a VERY last minute decision (think the day of the event with 4.5 hours until guests arrive, and no ingredients). Luckily for me, despite complications like the cake sticking to the parchment paper (I really recommend that you grease it or something), it came out beautifully and finished right on time! Not to mention, it was delicious, although rich, and BEAUTIFUL!

We love this cake.  It takes a little effort, but is well worth it if you like to take pictures of your food before you eat it like me.  It's not too sweet and the filling is so light.  I do add a little extra 10X sugar to stiffen it up.  Decorate to your hearts desire.

I made this twice over the Christmas hoiday. The first time I did, I did not pay attention to rolling the warm cake so it was actually quite cooled prior to rolling, but it was easy and did not crack. The advise on heavy sugar on the towel in great, especially with the warm cake. I did not heavy whipping cream, so I filled the cake with items I had on hand: homemade buttercream frosting for the inside, canned chocolate for the outside. This cake was a HUGE success with my family, who all love sweets! For the second cake, I did purchase whipping cream, which I used to fill the inside as well as the outside, sice there was so much of it.(pic sent). This one was less sweet, but still delicious. I sprinkled both with powdered sugar, for effect, but wait until serving for that since it dissolves into the frosting.

The cake had a nice texture and flavor-light and spongy. Instead of making the filling from scratch, I filled it with a whipped topping. It looked really pretty and it was tasty.

I decided to make this cake for one of my classes.  It seemed like a difficult recipe, so I asked a friend to help me prepare it with me.  The cake ended up sticking to the parchment paper (I have to admit I did not grease the parchment paper) and when I unrolled the cake, it fell apart.  I tried to put it back together and it was no use.  I was even disappointed with the taste:(  Maybe I did not follow the directions as well as I had?

This was a fabulous recipe.  It was fairly easy and everyone raved about it.  However, the final shape was more of a flattened log than a round one.  I saved some of the filling and frosted the log, then gathered some holly leaves from my yard.  I placed sets of 3 leaves together and placed 3 little red candies in the center like berries and it looked pretty cute.  Give this one a try!

FYI - Haven't eaten the cake yet, but filling is amazing!!  The only problem I had with making this cake is the parchment paper wasn't easy to get off.  Next time I will spray a little baking oil or butter on paper before put batter in. Also, make sure you use a stand mixer for the egg whites (it takes a long time to get them to the stiff peaks).  Enjoy!!!

Excellent taste!  There was a lot of filling.  I used about 1/2 of the filling inside the log and the rest I used to frost the top.  Yum...

Very good!
Icing tastes like Chocolate mousse - yum!
Beating the eggs takes a while, but is worth it. 
I am not a huge chocolate fan, and I admit that this was too much for me, but all the chocolate lovers who tried it loved it!

I find it confusing that it doesn't say what to do with the first bowl. I suppose I'm supposed to assume that's the filling? I'm using Swiss meringue buttercream for my filling. I'm glad I didn't waste ingredients.

It was easier than it looked, and I followed every single tip that previous reviewers provided, like setting up the ingredients first; spraying the parchment with non-stick spray; I even greased the pan UNDER the parchment; beating the egg yolks to death (as in Texas - BTHO) making sure they are PALE yellow; beat the egg whites sufficiently; heavily, heavily, heavily dust the towel with powdered sugar; look at it after 12 minutes because you almost certainly want to take it out then instead of waiting for the full 15 minutes.  It was chocolate-y, delicious, not too sweet, very rich, and we loved it!!!!!

This was easier than I thought & so delicious!  The only thing I did differently than the recipe was to add a few teaspoons of instant espresso powder to the egg yolk mixture to boost the chocolate flavor.

I love this holiday cake.   The cake and filling are low in sugar which allow me to add a french buttercream frosting which, for me, takes this  cake Over The TOP!  yum yum!  The only tip I would add is if you have an electric beater, START by whipping the egg whites.  Once they're full of firm peaks, transfer them to a bowl, then add the yolks and sugar and beat hard (for 5 minutes like others said) Next, hand stir the cocoa and vanilla.  Once well mixed, HAND STIR the meringue into the bowl & GENTLY mix it with the chocolate mixture with just a few stirs bc this is what gives the cake its airiness ~ the meringue.  If you incorporate completely it will collapse the airiness of the meringue so just a few gentle, deep stirs and into the ready greased pan it goes.  Don't mind a few white lumps!  (I beat the whites first, then move to a different bowl bc I can just load the egg yolks and sugar into the same bowl and proceed.  I don't need to clean to start anew.)  LOTS of spray oil on the parchment or the cake will stick.  Puddle it on there.  Then, have your clean towel ready and sprinkled when the cake comes out of the oven, then flip it onto the towel, remove the parchment and roll tightly.  Let cool on a rack.  Proceed to fill once it's cooled and have fun!  Making it look like a tree branch &  decorating with meringue mushrooms etc is a lot of fun!  Enjoy and happy holidays!

Very good but use an 11 x 17 jelly roll pan or half-sheet pan - this makes too much batter and filling for a 10 x 13 - will overflow and make it more difficult to get it out of the pan

Okay first of all you really need to take a lot of the other reviewers advice. Made this twice, first time did not turn out well. Second time it came out perfect. You really need to beat the egg yolks for at least 6 minutes. The more you beat them the more air will get into them. The chocolate whipped cream was a major plus. I also added chopped walnuts before rolling. If you don't beat the eggs long enough the cake will not be spongy and light. Thank you for an incredible recipe !!! And thanks to the all recipe folks for the how to video. I would never have taken on the challenge if it wasn't for the video. Well done !!!

I followed the recipe exactly fur the cake and filling. My log did crack a little upon the rolling and did it get stuck to the towel even with a lot of powdered sugar sprinkled.  I just picked up the pieces and put it back on the cake. Not a big deal once you cover it with some chocolate frosting. 

I added some melting chocolate chunks from a another tutorial I saw on a blog to give it the a bark like effect.

I found the cake very easy to prepare, but rather bland. I used Chef John's chocolate mousse recipe for the filling instead of the chocolate whipped cream in the recipe, and that helped make it a bit more substantial. Topped it with chocolate ganache. It looks more impressive then it tastes, but looks REALLY impressive, if you do it right!

Excellent flavor but somewhat one dimensional (remember, few ingredients)... I added split fresh raspberries to the filling for a nice twist. Recommend against baking on silpat -- lost the "skin" of the cake against silpat. This will fill the pan to the top and then deflate as it cools, so grease to the entire pan to the top of the rim. :-( For the frosting, would recommend "dutched" cocoa for darker, more tree-like  results! Impressive looking cake to present at parties. :-)

I made this for a Christmas around the World class of girls age 7-12 and they all loved it.  I didn't find it to taste eggy at all.  I did follow all the tips regarding beating the eggs, parchment, etc.  and it turned out great.  I didn't have enough cream, so I used 1/2 batch of whipped cream in the center and frosted with buttercream.  It was almost too sweet (and I LOVE sugar), so I'd stick with all whipped cream next time.  I'm gluten intolerant, and recipes that are converted to be gluten free often come out horrible. It's much better to find recipes that didn't have gluten in the first place.

Delicious and not as hard to make as you would think. There is plenty of chocolate cream for the inside and outside if you want it on the outside. It's actually very pretty without frosting - looks more like an actual log. But we like frosting so I did use the cream to frost the outside as well and used a fork to make it look more like bark. Still very pretty and tasty. I will definitely make this again. I followed the recipe as written and it was delicious.

This is absolutely one of my favorite cake recipes now. My mother has called it the every holiday and occasion cake. The frosting which is more like a very yummy mouse can stand on its own, only about half of it made it to each cake(I made three) The first one I put too much salt in though which lets just say it made its way to the garbage. The second and third though came out absolutely wonderful and everyone adored them, even thought they were too beautiful to cut.

I had to use my handy dandy electric mixer just to get everything to the right consistency and still took a bit of time, but it was definitely worth it. I have to say that the best way to cool it down is sticking it in the freezer for about half an hour, otherwise no matter how much you cool it in the fridge the frosting will become a little liquidy (at least that was a problem I had with one of the cakes)

Anyways, I will definitely be making this wonderful cake again and again!!

Happy with the results.  Use a very light/airy frosting on the exterior because the cake is very delicate.  My teenage kids had trouble spreading without wrecking it.  Overall, success!  Try it!

Was so excited to try this out as it looked so cute and fun. My husband and I found this extremely time consuming. In the end it wasn't worth all the effort sadly. The taste was awful, was like eating cocoa powder. Cake was so thin it was really difficult to roll without breaking. Lastly when it was all said it done it was so much tinier then I imagined. It was a good thing it wasn't a hit at our Christmas party or their wouldn't have been enough for everyone. Maybe someday I'll try again and make my own recipe to improve the taste and size.

This was really good! I made it for the first time just today and it tastes wonderful! Light and fluffy despite being flour less.  My weary Mom tried it after a few of my cooking disasters and her mouth dropped because it was so good.  I am so happy to have found a gluten free recipe like this! The only alteration I made was I added an extra half cup confectionary sugar to the frosting. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was amazing! Definitely recommend it!

I only used the filling part as we made a genoise cake for the sponge as it is easier then this recipe, my 11 year old son was making it for Christmas dinner. We used 3 cups of whipping cream to fill and frost the cake, I also added 3 envelopes of Dr Oetker's Whip It to stabilize the whipping cream. We cut one end off to make a knot and used a fork to make bark like surface, decorated with mushroom cookies and silk holly and berries from the dollar store.

Delicious and a total hit at our Christmas party.  Love that it's gluten free too.  Decided to make a chocolate frosting to top it off and used coconut to add more snow around on the ground.Glad I did.

followed all directions AND some tips from others- cake wound up breaking when rolling it but i managed to salvage it. also the frosting tastes exactly like cocoa powder which is very unappealing.... i really wanted a creamy chocolatey flavor

Great Recipe! glad I read all the reviews and tips. 
My tip would be that if you do not want cake crumbs stuck to your dish towels, cover them front and back with press n' seal (sticky side against the towel of course).  Worked out great for me and no cake crumbs stuck to my towels.

This recipe is simple and easy to follow.  It makes a delicious and beautiful Yule log cake.  I frosted mine with chocolate buttercream frosting and textured the frosting by running a fork down the sides to give it the look of bark.

It was fabulous. Thank you reviewers for the tips. I made tiny mushrooms with white chocolate, and holly berries and poinsettia with gummy drops. Everyone was impressed.

This is a great recipe - intense to make the first time but if you follow instructions correctly, it turns out beautifully.  My family is French/French canadian and my grandmother always made the buche.  She is too old now and so I took on the job.  This isn't the same as what she made but my family loved the new cake.  Thanks for the updated version of an old tradition!

I made this for a Christmas brunch and, oh, my goodness, was it a hit!  The recipe is easy to follow and turned out perfectly.  I did follow the suggestion to frost the outside with buttercream icing. Thank you Tyra; this is a real winner! Peggy2012

Super easy recipe, and it comes out great, I've done it 2 years in a row now.  But, last year I thought the chocolate whipped cream filling was too chocolatey, so I would back off the cocoa there just a bit.  Also, I used Whip-It whipped cream stabilizer, and it holds up really well, even at room temp (accidentally left it on the counter all last night).

I prefer the other roll up recipes to this one.  Just too rich for any of us.  Maybe with a non-chocolate filling it would have been better.  Too bad.

Just made this for the second year in a row and it turned out spectacularly again. I change nothing about the preparation. To decorate, I save some extra mousse and ice the buche with it. I cut a section and lay it at an angle rather then try to get it to stand up. Following a previous suggestion, I score the mousse with a fork to give the appearance of a log. I use red, white and green gum drops for decor. The white ones I stick on toothpicks for the mushrooms and the green ones I flatten and cut into holly leaves. Another triumph! Great recipe!

This was the start of my Christmas Afternoon Tea! I was nervous about rolling up a cake but it was easy because I let it cool in the pan for 10 mins before flipping it out onto a well- covered powder sugar coated dish towel! I also followed the advice of other reviewers and sprayed the parchment liberally with non-stick spray and made sure the yolks were mixed for a full 5 minutes. For a cake filled with whipped cream it is a decadent and rich dessert, the slices I served were only 1 inch thick and that was plenty. 

I also used the recipe for Meringue Mushrooms on this site to decorate it. For a final touch I cut one end off at 45 degrees to make the "nub" of the log and I ran a fork through the frosting to make it look like bark.

This was my first attempt at a yule log, and it was a success!  I had to use an 11x17 pan, so the log ended up being longer and thinner.  However, it looks great!  I followed the directions to a T and it turned out wonderfully.  I was nervous about rolling it off onto a towel, as I had never done so before, but it turned out great.  I will use this again for the holidays.

This was my first attempt at a buche de Noel, and I have to say this recipe was pretty easy.  Followed the recipe as written and it turned out great.  I will say there was too much filling.  I didn't use nearly all of it and I still wish I had put less inside the cake.  I did not use the filling as frosting either.  I did a deep chocolate buttercream frosting, made some frosting holly leaves and berries, and made mushrooms out of marzipan.  It really looked great if I do say so myself!

I've always wanted to make this but was a little intimidated by it.  I had to take a dessert to our Mary Kay Christmas Party, so I decided to take the bull by the horns and do it.  It took a little while to put it all together, but it turned out wonderful and I received many compliments on it.  At the end of the party, there wasn't any left to take home.  I won't hesitate to make it again :)

This was a great recipe, and thanks to the tips about over dusting the towel and whipping the eggs to oblivion, mine turned out wonderful.  Some comments I got were: "this is the best cake I've had", "this cake is gorgeous and yummy".  It was rich for sure, but very delicious.  I will make this again as it was not very difficult at all.

This was an amazing yule log.  No one at the table could discern that it was GF.  I made it as described with exception of the cream filling.  I made it as suggested by AllRecipes, as detailed in their magazine.  The result was a beautiful velvety chocolate "cake" and a not too sweet filling that wonderfully complemented each other.  I will make this again and again.

This was a beautiful addition to our Christmas table! Very easy and the mixer does all the work of whipping egg yolks and whites! I was worried it would be heavy but it was anything but. I only gave 4 stars because the recipe- as written- doesn’t include the tips that make the recipe successful. 
I followed other reviewers’ advice and made sure to beat egg yolks for 5+ mins, the same for the whites. I lined the pan with parchment and greased it. The cake rose a bit while baking but- like a soufflé, which it pretty much is- it ended up falling when it came out. I hoped it would keep some of that volume, but it didn’t.  It was flatter than I expected. 
The whipped cream frosting made about 2x more than you need for this recipe. I frosted the outside with it, too, and still had a ton leftover. I’d cut that in half next time. 
The cake itself is pretty low calorie, compared to others. It didn’t have any oil or butter and had a small amount of sugar. The bulk of the calories come from the icing, which is light and fluffy and not too sweet.
I decorated with sugared rosemary and cranberries, and some chocolate curls.

This turned out better than I expected. It was delicious!  I think my sponge cake may have fallen a little flat but since I’ve never had this dessert before I can’t be sure. Overall pretty easy to do, I sprayed parchment paper really well, was very liberal on the powdered sugar on the tea towel. I followed the tip to beat the yolks & sugar 5 minutes, took cake out of pan after 5 minutes. 

I used Christmas picks to decorate, I hate meringue so didn’t want to do the mushrooms. Also found some candy snow flakes at the store & used those as well. Powder sugar on top.  Very pretty, flavor was amazing. Love the whipped cream frosting which I will use on other cakes.  Overall I’m really happy! Oh & ignore the toothpicks in the cake pic, I was using to hold foil off the frosting & forgot to take them out.

This turned out amazing, no issues rolling it at all! We sliced the end off and used it as a little extra appendage. We also used only half the whipped cream inside the log, then used the rest of it to decorate the outside. We used a fork to create the bark pattern. Our family was so impressed!!!

Followed the tips of beating the egg yolks super long and let it cool before flipping it over - plus sprayed the parchment paper w PAM before adding the “batter”

A great recipe! I made it exactly as it directed me to and the outcome was superb! I added some chocolate bark look on top by melting chocolate chips and spreading thin on wax paper- freezing- then pasting on the top with a little filling.

We love it and have made it for the last four years as a new annual tradition.  The only change would be to coat the parchment paper to discourage sticking.

It looks and tastes very good. Not like the picture but I am not a pro. The recipe was difficult to follow as it is very undescriptive. There was far too much filling that came out. But let's be honest, who doesn't want more frosting.

Turned out beautifully for a first try. The only mistake I made was overfilling with the cream, which was delicious, but affected the spiral. Great tasting recipe!

So so so good. I want to eat the whole thing myself. The recipe makes almost twice as much filling as needed, but I don't consider that a problem! I'm also used to pouring chocolate ganache over the top but this recipe is so rich you don't need it at all - the powdered sugar is enough. I will definitely be making this again.

This is an outstanding cake.  Its light, flavorful, and not very difficult to make.  It just takes time and patience.  Made this for Christmas and it was a great hit.  I will certainly make this again and encourage all to give it a try.  Its really not that hard as long as you roll the cake up while its warm and then let it thoroughly cool before unrolling and filling with the delicious chocolate mousse filling.  Used the extra filling  for piping on the outside of the cake and it was so pretty!

I am not a skilled baker, but this worked well!  I made sure to beat the eggs for a long time and my  cake was nice and light/had a good rise.  I think this would taste great with some variations of the extract flavor!

I would prefer a richer chocolate flavor cake. Also my cake cracked and flattened as I removed it from the pan and rolled it.  Was good but I expected a denser cake.

Great recipe! Followed the steps exact.y and got a great cake. The cake is on the bitter side, so most people did not eat a lot. In the future, I will use sweetened cocoa for the inside icing.

It turned out very good IF you don't hold back on the whipping. Especially on the egg yokes, make sure you whip them until they are so pale they're almost white. There are no rising agents in this recipe so it's very important if you want to prevent it from turning out as a chocolate omelet with whipped cream.

This turned out amazing. Rave reviews from everyone. I made "bark" from melted, hardened chocolate and some meringue mushrooms from recipe on this site. Also made sugared cranberries and used some fresh greens from a fir tree in my yard. Sadly I forgot to sprinkle the powdered sugar over it before serving but no one noticed. Will add picture later.

It's a beautiful cake.  I  doubled the recipe and incorporated all of the feedback from other reviewers--beat the egg yolks for 5 minutes and used a significant amount to icing sugar on the dish clothe.  Other changes: 1.  I used plain whipping cream fill because I did't want to be overloaded with chocolate and  2. I didn't  use all of the fill (cutting it by 1/4) because I didn't want it too sloppy.  I topped it with chocolate butter cream frosting, chocolate bark flakes and meringue mushrooms and it was just lovely.

Oh my gosh... to die for. Absolutely delicious. It is pretty to look at as well when the dish is completed. Its a very rich but also a very light dessert. Perfect for after dinner with a nice cup of coffee or hot chocolate.

It came out great although I was very concerned when I looked in oven and saw that batter was growing rapidl a half way through the cooking!  When I took out from oven batter came down.  The final piece is fantastic !
I will it again next Christmas.

Followed the recipe to the T, as well as the comments about whipping all the eggs good, chilling the cream, spraying the parchment paper. It's one of the best deserts that I've made, and it's flourless! Making it again for Christmas!

First time making this. Next time I will likely use less whipped cream filling (maybe 25% less) on the inside and save some for the outside. The cake was rich and light without being sweet.

Followed the recipe exactly, it was super easy and turned out really great! The only thing I would do, would be to add frosting and make a little less filling. Really great though!

I've made this recipe at least once a year for the last 9 years. My mom's birthday is December 18 and she perfers this over any birthday cake. 

When making this dessert remember that the more air you put into the ingredients the better the batter and icing will be. So mix mix mix!!!

This Yule Log was delicious. It's light & airy. I had never made a flourless cake, but I made sure to beat the eggs until very fluffy & it turned out great!

I loved this Yule Log. It was so light and airy that it simply melted in your mouth. I had never made a flourless cake, so I made sure to let the mixer beat the eggs for a couple of minutes until they were completely pale, since I read that was the key. Overall, my family enjoyed it. I will be making this again!

I liked the cake, the Icing/filling stuff could be better though. I didn't have parchment paper and I'm impatient so I just used Crisco. Don't use Crisco in this recipe. Only half the cake came out of the pan. Then it fell apart. Otherwise It was GREAT!!! Warning: ALWAYS USE PARCHMENT PAPER!!!!!!!!

Love this recipe!  It was so easy that I ended up making two! One for my family and one for my in-laws.  Everyone said I put in way too much work.  For the "bark" I melted some chocolate chips and then placed it on wax paper  and rolled it around my rolling pin until it hardened.  When I unrolled it they crumbled off into a nice bark which I scored with a toothpick.  I also made mushrooms out of fondant and dipped them in cocoa powder for "dirt"  The cakes came out beautiful and I plan on making them every year now.

We have made this recipe 2 Christmases in a row. It’s incredible! I’m a French teacher and so excited to make this a family tradition. We usually add chocolate buttercream frosting to decorate on the outside as well as powdered sugar, chocolate shaving (grated chocolate bar) and red berries. The hardest part is taking the cake off of the parchment paper and then rolling it without having it break or crack, so watch out for that!

I only used a quarter of a cup of cocoa in the whipped cream and it worked great. Save about 1/4 the cream filling for the “frosting” on the outside . Also I saved a big step by  just using the parchment to roll it up. I had brushed melted butter on the pan and then on the parchment.  I left the cake in the pan to cool for about 20 minutes then rolled it and let it sit for about an hour. I then unrolled it, filled it, and rolled it up again right off the parchment. A few chocolate shavings and icing sugar and it was done.

So easy to make!! I followed reviews and beat eggs until very pale. I refrigerated it overnight, it was perfect. I made the mushrooms out of fondant and made "bark" out of some melted chocolate chips, vegetable oil, and creme de mint. My family could not stop talking about it, and ate the entire thing!!

First time making anything like this and it turned out so amazing that I made another one and it turned out just as great! Thank you so much! My  family can't get enough however my daughter is gluten free but doesn't like chocolate so I may try this vanilla and spread some fruit preserves and then the cream filling. We will see how it works out.

I heard about this in a Hallmark Christmas movie and wanted to make it. I was nervous making a rolled cake because I’ve avoided trying one. It was surprisingly easy and fun to do (although uses a lot of dishes). Did as others suggested and beat the egg yolks for 5 minutes. I made as is and greased the parchment well and dusted the towel well with powdered sugar before flipping the cake over on it. I left out some of the filling to frost the cake and made fork marks on it to look like wood. I decorated with spearmint gummy leaves and maraschino cherries for holly. My Christmas guests loved it and my husband wants me to make it again already for New Years! Also, I have a couple gluten free family members so this worked well.

Really good and pretty easy to make.  Definitely want to beat the egg yolks a long time.  I also sprayed some cooking oil on the parchment paper and the cake came off easily.  Watch the cooking time - I went just a bit long and it was starting to burn on the bottom.  Next time I'll try to make the mushrooms!

I really enjoyed this recipe and had no problems- I did make sure the parchment overlapped all the edges. I let it cool for maybe 10 minutes before flipping unto the dusted cloth. 
I did not grease the paper and had no problems - ??

Incredible!!! Follow the others advice to beat the yolks for five minutes and it turned out light and fluffy and delicious! I made the bark by spreading a small thin layer of chocolate bark on parchment paper then loosely rolling it up and putting in the refrigerator and when it unravels it breaks into little pieces which I attached to the log with more melted chocolate. I also made this with the meringue mushrooms. Rave reviews!

I have always wanted to make one of these and this turned out perfect, it was a huge hit. I do think the next time I will try it with a vanilla filling instead of the cocoa filling, it was a lot of cocoa and I think the contrasting flavor might be more to my liking. Followed directions and tips on greasing the pan and parchment and was sure to use lots of powdered sugar for rolling, perfection. Also had plenty of filling to use for frosting the outside, dusted it with powdered sugar and made meringue mushrooms, it looked beautiful!

Wow.   Growing up I used to live near a Hostess Factory.  My dad would bring home freshly made Devil dogs from the factory.  This cake tastes like a super fresh devil dog (same chocolate taste).  
I really super whipped the egg whites and made sure the yokes and sugar were extra blended.  My cake was very very fluffy.  The only thing I forgot to do was spray Pam on the parchment paper ( I read to do that in one of the reviews).  So my ends were a bit jagged because of some sticking on the edges.  No problem though, because after I filled and rolled the cake, I just cut them off the ends to make it look “clean” and had a snack.  Yummmmmm.  I can’t wait to make this again.  
The filling is super chocolate.  I loved it.  But I could see if you’re not a chocolate fan then (white) whipped cream filling might be the way to go.  I LOVED THIS Yule Log!!!

Not sure what I did wrong - came out of the oven fine, rolled OK, cooled, but completely fell apart when I tried to unroll it. Disaster. And was planning to bring it to a Christmas party. 

Did taste fine but won't try a rolled cake with this recipe again.

My daughter was recently in a production of "Miracle on the 34th Street" at her high school. My husband made this for their cast party.  My daughter and I both have Celiac disease, so I was thrilled to find a flourless recipe.  It is absolutely delicious.  

I admit, due to the nature of teenagers....we did substitute a cream cheese buttercream for the filling.

They were amazing.  We've made four in the last week for various occasions.  The cake has been beautiful each time.

Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.

I was leery about the recipe, but gave it a shot because of the reviews. I followed the advice to whip the egg yolks really well. It looked like light yellow whipped cream once I was done that part. While it was baking it didn't look like I was expecting. When it came out, it seemed kind of foamy, but eventually the cake collapsed and resemebled more of what I was expecting. This was my first attempt, I will make it again next week for Christmas dessert!

Alternatives: This is a very good recipe as is. I'm just suggesting alternatives ways of doing it. 

Instead of chocolate whipped cream, mix the vanilla with 1/2 cup raspberry preserves, then mix that into the whipped cream AFTER it's whipped. Chocolate and raspberry is a great combinations.

Spread chocolate ganache all over the log once it's complete, instead of powdered sugar. As others have suggested, use a fork or knife to make ridges so it looks like tree bark. 

Keep the chocolate whipped cream, but add at least 1 teaspoon orange zest to it. Or add the orange zest to the ganache, if you do that.

First time making this cake was a practice run for Christmas this year - so very pleased with it!  I followed all the recommendations from previous reviewers which were excellent - the ingredients are fine as is - just tips for the process.  Instead of using parchment paper, I used a silicone baking mat (I did spray it with nonstick spray just to be safe) - worked great!!  I also used a silicone baking mat instead of the towel, which also worked great.  I followed the recommendations for beating the egg yolks for 5 minutes, ensuring the egg whites are properly beat, also waited 10 minutes to turn out the cake onto the towel/mat.  I was able to easily reserve some frosting to frost the cake top, I used a fork to make marks resembling tree bark, and I melted a block of semi-sweet chocolate in the oven, spread it thin, then refrigerated so that I could break into pieces of "bark."  My practice run cake ended up looking amazing.  I recommend holding off on frosting the outside until ready to decorate and serve.  It also DOES taste better the 2nd day as another reviewer commented, so very easy to prepare in advance, refrigerate, and then decorate/serve the next day.  I had several people taste the cake - they loved it!

I've made this multiple times and it turned out great, everyone loves it.  No cracking when you roll it up.  I fill it with freshly whipped cream and use a chocolate buttercream frosting.  So good.  Be sure to use best quality cocoa.  
I have no idea why one reviewer said it was like a chocolate omelete.  It doesn't have an eggy texture at all, they must have made a mistake.

Everyone loved it, especially me, the biggest chocolate lover!  It was way easier than I expected and so delicious!  I was disappointed there wasn't more than 1 slice left after Christmas dinner!  Like another person who reviewed, I am making it for Easter, as I can't wait until December to have it again!

Made the cake and icing for Christmas  and the family loved it. Did not make the meringue mushrooms which my grandson wanted but ran out of time. Next time I will try making the mushrooms. The icing did not get thick enough to make the bark like icing. Will probably add gelatin to the whipped cream next time.

What an excellent template to work with!  Based on reviews, I did add some flour and baking powder to "firm up" the cake - about 1/4 cup flour, 1/2 tsp bp - and with a lot of careful time in the egg-white-folding part due to the stiffness of the batter (but wanting to preserve that airiness) it turned out absolutely perfect.  Raves all around.  Loved that it was not cloyingly sweet, and that this recipe just lets the dusting of powdered sugar finish it off -- no frosting or ganache etc. necessary.  This will become a go-to for birthdays, too!

Couldn't make it work so am looking for a yule log recipe with flour - more substance.  Maybe I didn't bake it long enough but it fell apart.  The taste is very light - not in a good way.  Didn't care for taste of cake or whipped cream (which is funny because how can you not like whipped cream?).

This was a first in making a rolled cake and this recipe. If you follow the directions  exactly as written it was easy to do.  The taste was absolutely wonderful.  Will definitely make this a favorite for sharing with friends and family.

Made on Christmas--my family gobbled this down!! Only had one piece left!!! I'm planning to make it again next year. Next time I will definitely grease the parchment paper--I lost half the cake because it stuck to the paper badly.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I made it one week before Christmas and stored it in the freezer rolled up in parchment and foil. I cut the ends off while still frozen to form the knobs. I used store-bought chocolate frosting and frosted it while it was frozen. I drew "bark" with the tines of a fork and garnished with fake holly leaves. This can also be made ahead and stored in the refrigerator for several days. I know this because the leftovers will still fantastic a few days after Christmas. This is a super easy recipe and I will be making this every Christmas!

I wanted to make this ever since hearing talk radio guy Mark Steyn tell a very funny story about U.S. Customs confiscating a Buche de Noel from some Canadian pastry chefs at the Vermont-Canadian border. So I read the recipe over and over again, read the reviews and comments, watched the video, even on Christmas Day. I still managed to make a major mistake: after allowing the sponge to cool for 10 min after baking (12 min), I spread the filling on and started to roll everything up in my well sugared towel. Then I thought, hey, all this cream is going to stick to the towel. Uh OH! I had forgetten that step of rolling up without filling. I think I was saved by the fact that the 10 min cooling off period was enough to save the filling from collapse, I put the log (yes, it looked awesome) in the fridge. It tasted wonderfully and looked beautifully log like. I will make this again, once I learn how to make macaroon decorations.

I followed the recipe exactly.  After reading the reviews, I did as many suggested, greasing the parchment paper (I lightly sprayed it with some oil), and using my whisk attachment on my kitchen aid mixer I beat and beat and beat the egg yolks and sugar!  Seriously, beat the egg yolks and sugar for at least 5 minutes.  Keep going until you think they look good, and then do it for another 2 minutes!  
The cake puffed up nicely in the oven.  It did crack/split a little when I rolled it (rolled in a tea towel with a good amount of powdered sugar).  Let it cool completely before unrolling.  Then fill with the chocolate whipped cream.  There was enough of the whipped cream to put inside and frost the outside once it was filled and rolled.  I also melted chocolate, spread it thin on some wax paper and stuck it in the freezer, then broke it up and placed it on the roll to look like bark. 
Neither the whipped cream or the cake are very sweet. It is very rich, very chocolatey, but not sweet.  If you want sweet, this isn't for you.  I made this at my 6 year old's request (choosing this recipe for its good reviews), after he learned about this french Christmas tradition and had one at school.  My 6 year old informed me that the one at school was better, his teacher informed me it was a swiss cake roll!  I enjoyed it, but again, it isn't sweet.  Hope this helps!

Was extremely well received at our Christmas party. 

As other reviewers mentioned, be sure to beat the hell out of the egg whites. I was actually concerned during baking because it seemed to rise much higher than I expected, but it deflated down to where it should be after taking it out.

Roll it while it's still warm to keep it from breaking.

I found this recipe at least 5 years ago & I have made it every Christmas since. It's delicious. I buy fondant and make the mushrooms, & holly leaves & berries. It has become a tradition to make this cake. It also has no flour which is great for my daughter in law who is gluten free. I highly recommend this cake.

We used a lot of cooking spray on our parchment, a little too much, as our cake folded on itself. Fortunately, we were able to save it. We loved the rich chocolate frosting. We will definitely make it again.

I found this recipe on my phone and it wasn't until I put it on my computer that I realized the cake was supposed to crack all the way through to the filling.  Sooooo, third time was the best, however, I still couldn't get the look of the picture quite right.  I followed the recipe and added ALL the filing the first two times and the cake just squirted out.   The third time I added less filling and it worked out much better.  I  buttered my parchment paper instead of spray, and followed all the other tips.  Even though  I would consider the first two attempts"fails" they where oh so yummy.  I found the latest try good enough to present for my company Christmas party but I still would like to master the log look from the picture.  Next attempt I'll try running a knife in a pattern to coax proper breakage.  Worth every effort.

Delicious and easy.  I did think the cake was a little dry (maybe I will need to take it out sooner as my oven temp collaboration may be higher) but next time I might brush on some simple syrup to give it more moisture.  It is also quite time consuming so you really need to be in the mood to do this cake.  The filling was delicious.  Tastes exactly like the mousse version I make which is whipped cream folded into chocolate ganache.  I prefer this easier version - my new go to.  Got raving reviews.

I did a test run of this recipe prior to Xmas Eve.  My son has Celiacs so I was thrilled to find a "cake" that he can enjoy.  I did comb through the reviews and followed the advice given by others. I beat the egg yolks and sugar on high with the whisk attachment on my Kitchen Aid for about 6 minutes - then followed the directions as written. I  greased the parchment with butter and has no issues with sticking.  I did decrease the cocoa in the whip cream by 1/2 and it's PLENTY rich.  I think the cake has a nice light spongy texture and I will definitely make this for Xmas Eve. I do plan on making meringue mushrooms.  For my test drive I did frost the outside of the cake with the whipped cream and there was still quite a bit leftover.   I'm not sure I love the chocolate whip cream ...I probably would prefer plain but that's me.  We plan on serving the peppermint ice cream.  Not terribly hard to make -- and will make a pretty presentation.

This is so worth the work! My husband is looking forward to this Christmas just so I can make this again. A very impressive dessert and it tastes just magical! I followed the recipe exactly as stated with great results, but I will be doubling the chocolate whipped cream filling. I sprinkled the log with confectioners sugar as directed, but the log absorbed it within minutes and since I was taking this to a Christmas Eve dinner it wasn't the best for presentation. This year I will double the filling and use half to coat the log, draw a fork through it to create a real bark look, and THEN sprinkle a little bit of confectioners sugar on it. I think I may try the meringue mushrooms this year as well for that extra WOW factor.

End result was heavenly delicious dessert with amazingly light, airy texture.  Was a little difficult to roll the cake, and it broke in several spots for me, but luckily the frosting covered everything and nobody was the wiser.  One tip - if you're adding powdered sugar to look like snow, wait until the last possible moment to add it...it quickly melted into the frosting and disappeared on me.

I loved the filling. Had leftover and ate it as a pudding with whipped cream. Would use the filling again. 
This is one of the desserts I always wanted to make and I loved it. Follow all the suggestions and it is perfect

This was much easier than making a genoise.  Plus it's GF ! 
I followed the recipe exactly, and followed the advise of others and made sure the egg yolks were well beaten.  Spray the pan to hold the parchment in place and spray the parchment so the cake won't stick.  It was light as air!  I filled the log with the chocolate whipped cream, then made a chocolate buttercream, (that was a little sweeter) and frosted the cake.  It was a huge hit!  My new tradition.  Will leave more time to make the meringue mushrooms next year.

This was delicious: Light yet rich, perfect for Christmas dinner.
Based on another review, I frosted the log with half the mousse, but I also needed to re whip the mousse with more powdered sugar, so that it was stiff enough to hold onto the log. Since the mousse was not very sweet to begin with, this tasted even better.

I made this for my family Christmas Eve dinner and everyone loved it! (Even my sister in law who doesn't like chocolate) I took the advice from other reviews about oiling the wax paper before baking and that helped quite a bit. I would also make sure not to use too much of the whipped filling when rolling it because A. It will overflow like crazy and B. Makes it a little harder to roll up.

I loved it and so did my French class(for our Christmas Fête)! But I didn't realize that this recipe didn't include icing for the cake so I didn't have it. Overall the flavor was great and compensated for my non-'icingness'. I also saw that people added theses little mushrooms so I looked that up and added them too!

I beat the egg yolks and sugar for five minutes. I folded a small amount of meringue into the beat yolks, then folded the yolk mixture into the meringue.

The cake puffed up quite a bit and I got nervous that it would be too thick to roll, but it cooled to be as tall as the edges of the jelly roll pan. 

I decorated it with flattened gummies I cut into holly leaf shapes and holly berry shapes. I also made mushroom meringues which were a HUGE hit! Everyone at the Christmas party marveled over them and loves them. Everyone said the cake was really good. Next time I make it, I think I'll roll some chipped nuts inside it for texture.

I found this recipe seven years ago and have made it every Christmas Eve since... It's become a family tradition and I'm not allowed to show up to dinner without it. Thank you, TYRARACHELE for this wonderful recipe! We pair it with the following dark chocolate sauce, which we drizzle over individual slices: 
In a bowl, over simmering water, melt and stir together 5 oz bitter or semi-sweet chocolate, 4 T unsalted butter and 2.5 T light corn syrup.

I made this for a holiday party and everyone lost their minds over the appearance AND taste. I decorated with meringue mushrooms, plain whipped cream (added a little gelatin) lumped on top for snow, chocolate bark, and a plastic holly sprig. The bark was melted chocolate that I spread on a Silpat and draped over a pitcher to make it curve. When I was cleaning up the cake plate at the end, the host ran over to scrape every last bit off.

I tried this for the first time today in my French class after a classmate made it to go along with his presentation. I didn't think I would like it because I'm not the biggest fan of sweets but was pleasantly surprised. I came back to learn the recipe to make some for myself. I would definitely recommend this.

My daughters had a homeschool co-op class. We picked France to represent for our Country at Christmas. We decided to make this. I made 2 my first one was not as pretty but it tasted amazing and my second one turned out great! The children loved it as did the adults! I would make this again!  I didn't change a thing about the recipe.

This is truly an impressive recipe! Mine came out perfect! As my high school's French Club President, I made this for this year's French National Honor Society inductions. Since it is April, I made a "spring" version, and decorated it with spice drop roses instead of powdered sugar. 

I made sure to really beat the eggs, which sucked because I have an electric hand mixer and not a standing one, so my biceps really got a workout! I realized that someone had packed away my old jelly roll pan so I went to Publix really quickly and bought a cheap foil cookie sheet with the correct dimensions that worked beautifully (and with no mess!). I lined it with parchment paper greased with Pam ( I still had to tug a bit to remove the paper). 

When I rolled it, I dusted the towel with powdered sugar as well as the other side of the cake because I was suspicious of the "wetness" of the freshly baked cake and didn't want any sticking. It didn't stick. 

I frosted the outside of the cake with store-bought fudge frosting to appeal to kids' sweet tooths, and colored the leftover cream filling with green food coloring. It turned a mossy color because of the cocoa powder darkening it, and I spread it around my cake to disguise the plastic tray and give it a grassy feel. I made a stump by cutting off a small angled piece and gluing it to the top with frosting as well. I also trimmed a small slice off the other end so that the pretty spiral is visible and clean-cut. Then I used fork tines

I LOVE this recipe! It's the perfect capstone to a fine Christmas dinner. It's delicate chocolate flavor add a nice, light finish to a busy season. Here are some recommendations that I would consider if you have never made this, or any other flourless cake before.
1. keep your egg whites in the bowl you intend to mix them in, in the FRIDGE until you're ready - they need to be cold.
2. spray the parchment paper with cooking spray first! There's no oil in the recipe. If you forget (like I did), you will need a spatula, and a second pair of hands to carefully roll the cake on the prepared dish towel.
3. If you're giving this to kids, it's not sweet enough for them. I have 2 boys who like my twist on it - I make the recipe as described above, but then I frost the cake once it's assembled, with a chocolate-buttercream frosting. 1 stick of room-temp butter, lots of confectioners sugar, good cocoa, milk/whipping cream and I add 1 Tbsp cold drip coffee so it's still classy and not over-powering.  The frosting recipe isn't precise, because I make it by trial-and-error.

Enjoy this wonderful cake - it's a long-standing tradition at our home that my grandmother started years ago, and I continue each year in her memory.

Definitely a keeper, I liked the whipped chocolate for the filling and coating. Much better than the thick chocolate bark I have seen elsewhere. It looks more intimidating than it is. Just be sure to follow each direction and READ THE REVIEWS. They are VERY helpful for clarification. Notes:

-This recipe works just fine for high altitude
-A bubble formed on the cake while in the oven, but deflated just fine when taken out
-Spray the parchment paper with Pam or similar
-BTHO of the mix. When you think it's good, keep going.
-Dust the towel thoroughly with powdered sugar (we dusted both sides of the cake too)
-We took our cake out at exactly fourteen minutes.
-Swipe a bit of melted chocolate chips or something gently over the outside after refrigeration for a nice barky finish
-Refrigerate it!

We used this recipe for the mushrooms to decorate: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/meringue-mushrooms/

(Don't refrigerate the mushrooms. They get sticky.)

I make this about every other Christmas so family and friends think it's too hard to do yearly! It's actually quite easy although time-consuming. I forgot to grease the paper before pouring in the batter. Won't do that again! Picking off paper very labor intensive. I always make a "stump" on the top and use powdered sugar as "snow." Icing seems like overkill although my family chocoholics LOVE it. I also rob my holly bushes of a few leaves and berries for extra frou-frou.

Just did a very similar recipe, except that it had a buttercream frosting.  Using this, pulling tines of a fork through it after frosting and adding meringue "mushrooms" gives a bit more feel of a log.  Absolutely delicious, this recipe, but won't win any awards for healthiness!  Who cares?

This is a nice recipe. It's easy & quick to make. The cake was light and spongy. As with other reviewers, I lightly sprayed and floured the parchment - not sure if it's necessary, but it came out clean. Other things I did that aren't exactly in the recipe:
Used a 12x17 pan & it was just fine. Done in 12 minutes.
Cut the end off at an angle to make a side branch (like many of the photos).
Covered it in a chocolate buttercream - dragged fork tines to make it bark like. (Used recipe from C&H Powdered sugar box - super quick/easy and pretty good!)
Added meringue mushroom decor (surprisingly easy - did them 2 days ahead of time) (Used Joy of Baking recipe but attached tops/bottoms with melted chocolate - looks like the underside/gills of a real mushroom and is tasty)

Made this for our Christmas dinner.  It turned out perfectly.  I garnished it with the Meringue Mushrooms (fount that recipe here).  We used to buy it from the local French patisserie for $35.  Won't have to do that again.

Nice!  I didn't have heavy cream so I used all buttercream frosting which made it a little heavy.  I made sure to beat the egg yolks until pale which was 5 minutes.  Next time I'll spray the parchment with cooking spray as the cake did stick a bit.

FAIL PROOF ... but Wow was it LABOR INTENSIVE!!!!   I think when decorating I went overboard and simpler is better.   You also need a really nice platter which I didn't have.  Haven't eaten it yet.

Although it tastes great ( very rich), it was very labor intensive, especially if you only have a hand mixer. I had to do the egg white mixer twice because I couldn't get the consistency right and ended up adding 3/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar. The cake was veryyy thin, but at least the whole cake is covered in frosting so it doesn't matter if there are cracks. I also needed to make 2 of the frostings because one wasn't enough to fill the cake and ice the top. 
Although tasty, not sure if I would use it again.

I have just finished making this recipe, and to say it was a disaster is an understatement. This was my first try at making a cake from scratch I admit, but I've made much harder things than a cake. Considering the amount of mess just prepping I was hoping this would be a delicious cake, but instead I have a pile of chocolate frosting with some cake scattered throughout.

Best Buche de Noel recipe I have ever tasted or made.  The cake is light and tasty and the mousse like filling is very good.  I added more sugar to the filling though.   I also added a chocolate frosting that I have put on my Buche de Noels in the past that was very chocolatey and made it even more tasty and beautiful. These things are usually prettier than they are tasty, but this one was the exception.  I only wish I would have sprayed the parchment paper, but it still came out great.

Just finished making this cake about an hour ago. It turned out amazing! Appreciate the suggestions about beating the eggs thoroughly and sprinkling lots of confectioners' sugar. In my case, I had no parchment paper but non-stick cooking spray worked great. The only critique I have is the 'cake' itself turned out a bit salty. I'm not sure if it's because I didn't mix it well enough. Other than that, it tastes amazing! Highly suggest this to anyone.

I made this for a Christmas dessert because I have a daughter who is gluten free. It was delicious but took too much time for me. I like something easy, but my daughter loved it. I would make it again if she wanted it!

I am not sure what I did while baking, maybe it did not bake long enough, however, it was very thin and came apart from out of the pan and during roll up.  It also cmae apart further when I unrolled to fill and before rolling up again.  It wasn't very sweet.  I am not sure I will make this recipe again.

I was looking for a traditionnal European Christmas dessert when I found this one. Since I was going to travel quite a long journey, I was not sure how the filling would hold, so I replaced it by an almond flavoured cream cheese filling. I also frost the cake with a cocoa frosting, making a pattern on it to resemble stripes on a wood log. Got rave reviews. Will make it again, the way it is written. Thanks for sharing
