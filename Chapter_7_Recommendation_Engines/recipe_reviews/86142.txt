I love this dip! I followed the modifications of another reviewer (1/2 lemon- juiced, 1 Tbsp chopped garlic, 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper & sub 2 TBSP chopped fresh italian parsley for the cilantro)it's out of this world! I follow the WW Core Plan and this fits in great. It's the best served with homemade pita chips but is equally delicious with raw brocoli, celery and red pepper. I've already made this 4 times this summer!

I make this all the time, it is very similar to one that Giada makes on Everyday Italian. I reduce the lemon to 1/2 of a juiced lemon, add 2 tablespoons of fresh Italian parsley, omit the cilantro, 1 tablespoon chopped garlic and 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper. Serve with pita triangles that have been sprinkled with olive oil, oregano, salt and pepper(both fresh ground from a salt & pepper mill) and then bake the pitas for 8 minutes at 400 degrees. Fabulous with the dip and good for you too!

it tastes great with pita chips but I also think the lemon was to over powering.

I could eat this with a spoon.  It is so, so good.  I also used parsley instead of the cilantro.  I couldn't stop eating it after I tried a bite when I was finished making it.  It's really good on the new Townhouse FlatBread Crisp Crackers-we had the Sea Salt and Olive Oil ones here.  What a fabulous (and very inexpensive) recipe.  I already bought more beans last night to make it again!  Thanks for sharing this, I love it!!!

Super easy to make and one of the best dips we've had. This went over wonders with the family. My husband is an Italian chef and raved that this was one of my best yet, all his favorite flavors together. This is a keeper!!

Great stuff...a dip that tastes great and is not full of saturated fat.  Try it with pita bread that has been cut into triangles and baked with herbs until crisp.

This is a great dip for celery -- or to stuff the celery with it, just use less olive oil. I didn't have any cilantro on me when I decided to make this, but I did have chili powder. Turned out great, and will definitely make this again.

Yummy! It's hard to judge, though, what the "juice of 1.5 lemons" is - I have a tree with very juicy lemons, so a real measurement would have been helpful. I started with one lemon and adjusted to taste. I didn't find the lemon overwhelming at all.

I made this last weekend and in my opinion the lemon was overpowering. I'd use less lemon juice (maybe lime juice would be better...?). I added more cilantro and some sugar, and then this dip was ok. I'll definitely make this again, though. Just with less lemon juice!

Delicious dip!  I followed the review and added less lemon juice.  It definitely tasted more cohesive and smooth after letting the flavors blend in the fridge for 2 hours.  I would suggest that before serving.

Absolutely wonderful!  Not ONLY that, but easy, cheap, and versatile!  I doubled.  Used some with some lemon, some with hot crushed Chile peppers, and with and without cilantro!  Cilantro won!  Will not be without this at family gatherings again.  Thank you All Recipes!

Hi, Love this dip. Made it last night and used it for the base of a bruschetta with tomatoes and feta.   Having today with leftover roast chicken on a baguette as a sandwich. Am thinking about tossing it with pasta tonight. So good! Haven't used it as dip yet :)  The only thing I did slightly different was to drizzle the olive oil in after everything else was pureed. I drizzled it in while the processor was running until it was the consistency I wanted.

I made this one evening when we had friends over. I used fresh parsley instead of cilantro and used slightly less olive oil to save on calories. We served it with freshly baked pita chips. I thought the amount would be too much for only 4 people but it was ALL gone by the end of the night.  Everyone loved it!

This is a good recipe...I add more pepper than normal but then again, I like pepper; also I've used flat leaf parsley rather than cilantro.  A great addition to this is 1 can of tuna, flaked and folded in with 3/4 chopped green olives...really pumps it up!

Fantastic dish! Quick and easy to make, with inexpensive and widely-available ingredients. And as an extra added bonus, it's good for you!  I made this following many other reviewers' suggestions (used parsley instead of cilantro, cut down olive oil to only 2 tbsp, and cut down lemon juice to juice of 1 lemon, added some crushed red pepper flakes). One other change: Had to use great navy beans because could not find any cannellini ones at the store.  I'm currently eating it with Triscuits and am going to have a hard time putting down the dip! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this dip for a party and it was a huge hit!  I already used a lot of cilantro in the salsa for this party so I used curly leaf parsley instead.  The parsley added such a great texture that I couldn't imagine this dip without it.  My husband said I used too much garlic but the bowl was empty by the end of the night!

I agree with other reviewers that this would be better with parsley.  I used a good quality extra virgin olive oil and the flavor really comes through--which I like--but it's a bit strange with the cilantro.  To make it with cilantro, I would use a lighter olive oil and lime juice instead of lemon.

I am on a really strict diet for nursing a food intolerant kid. So, have been working with his recipe for sometime! I add some dijon mustard, use rosemary instead of cilantro and add dried cranberries by hand at the end. Tastes like a chicken salad almost! SO good.

This was just ok for me. It comes out nice and smooth but it is too bland. I used lime instead of lemon. I added some green onion, smoked paprika and salt. I prefer a hummus. I cut way back on the olive oil (used only about a tablespoon). It really doesn't need that much.

A simple recipe that produces a great dip. So easy to make, my family prefers this to store-bought hummus. I don't add cilantro because we don't like it

Yum - what delicious flavors! I added 1 whole avocado (diced)and 1/2 red onion (finally diced) and I did not blend it - I left everything rustic so that guests can enjoy each individual flavor. This was a big hit!

Wow. Wasn't expecting to love this! Used Northern Beans, a little more than 1/3 cup oil, it wasn't blending well, and only 1 lemon. Didn't have cilantro so I used 2 Tablespoons of dried parsley and a small palmful of cajun seasoning probably about 1 T). I love cilantro and will buy it for next time. I'm sure it will be delicious!

As prepared according to directions, I found this bland (hence the three star rating, for the amount of tweaking required for my tastes). I followed tips from other members because it usually turns out better (1/2 lemon- juiced, 1 Tbsp chopped garlic, 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper & sub 2 TBSP chopped fresh italian parsley for the cilantro) but it was still kinda bland for me. I like A LOT of spice and flavor I guess. I doubled the recipe since I cooked too many beans for a soup I was making. After following the above suggestions, I added more lemon juice, more minced garlic, 1 tsp cumin, a healthy dash of cayenne peppers AND hot sauce. At this point I thought it was very tasty, but too watery/loose so I added 1/4 cup instant potato flakes to thicken...

So, if you are a spicy and garlic fanatic like I am--maybe this will make the perfect version of this dip for you? I also saw a suggestion to thin this with chicken stocks for a soup and I think that would be good and I may try that since I have a large bowl full now. If you are watching your fat and calories, I think you could definitely cut back on the olive oil amount.

My family and I did not care for this recipe.  It tasted too much like olive oil :(  If I were to make it again,  I would puree the beans less and add much less olive oil!

Very good, my 7 year old loved that it's just like humus which he loves. Put in less lemon and it was still very tangy. Will definitely make this again and tweak it to suit. Thank you for sharing.

I did like this. It was kind of like hummus. I added a pinch of cayenne pepper.

Pretty good but needs more spice.  Best made a day ahead.  Made pita chips with garlic powder and butter spray.  They were better than the dip!

This was good. It was sooo easy to make. I put everything in my food processor and it was done in 15 seconds. I used only 3 tbsp. of lemon juice and 3 tbsp. of olive oil.

This is a great dip. I agree with some of the other reviewers about the amount of lemon juice the recipe calls for. I added the juice of only a half of a large lemon. I also used much more garlic and no cilantro merely because I dislike it. Wonderful Jessica and thanks!

Just made this and love it.  I did not have cannellini beans-used garbanzo beans and halved the recipe.  I also used parsley bc again I had no cilantro.  I added the lemon, parsley and garlic to taste.  Fresh tasting, super easy and inexpensive!

Wonderful! I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.  I served it with pita chips and veggies.  I used both cilantro and parsley, and added a few green onions.  I just added the lemon juice in small amounts until I liked the taste.  It tasted better after sitting in the fridge for an hour or two.  This has no dairy, so it will be great sitting out during summer parties.  I will use this often.

I make an oil-free version that's very good.  Use one can drained beans, one can undrained.  Agree with other posters that more than 1-1/2 tsp lemon juice is probably plenty.

I removed olive oil, used 1/2 lemon, and substituted parsley for cilantro.  Just as good with a fraction of the calories and fat.  Olive oil is fattening so we don't treat it like it is good for us.

This is excellent.  I amped up the garlic just a bit and cut back on the cilantro (not a big fan) before refrigerating so the flavors could meld.  Served with crudites and pita chips.

I made a lot of adjustments to this recipe (due to lack of ingredients on hand), but it was still tasty.  I kept the beans and garlic, but pretty much eliminated everything else.

I absolutely loved this one! I'm supposed to follow a low saturated fat/cholesterol diet, so this was perfect! I didn't think the lemon was overpowering. I also didn't have to use salt or pepper...I found it very flavorful without it!

Don't substitute the cilantro for parsley! It's what makes this so good! Cilantro & white beans are good friends... I only had one can of beans & used 1/2 of a lemon. This is a great snack with celery during my diet...

Great base recipe! Loved the tanginess from the lemons and the combination with the cilantro. The dip was almost hummus like in texture but a little more garlicky. Great dip for last minute guests.

I thought this tasted okay for a quick healthy snack dip. It doesnt have a bunch of spices like similar dips. My only issue is, I made it for a lunch and the herb turned it a mint green color for some reason. Mine was also slightly on the thin side. It's okay just made, but get acidic tasting after a day or two in the fridge. I definitely suggest making it just fresh.

This is very good!  I sort of halved the recipe because I used one 19 ounce can of cannellini beans.  I added 2 whole cloves of fresh garlic, 2 T of olive oil, 1 T of lemon juice and just a generous amount of fresh cilantro as well as some red pepper flakes.  I need to either make some pita bread or get some because so far I've only tasted it off a spoon but it is oh so delicious!  Thanks!

Great base recipe. Took the idea but tweaked it a lot! Used chicken broth instead of olive oil to cut the fat, 3TBSP lemon juice, 1Tsp red pepper flakes, and fresh parsley instead of cilantro. Turned out really good after sitting in the fridge for the flavors to meld.

I make this as a bean salad - just skip the food processor. It's a great side dish and I've had several requests for the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Please don't be scared of the cilantro!  I probably put more than the recipe asked for and it was fantastic. Such a tasty change to hummus.  This is the type of recipe that you tweek to your tastes.  I love garlic, cilantro and lemons so I added more than suggested!

I did the cilantro version of this dip, cutting the lemon to the juice from 1/2 large juicy lemon and adding a bit of crushed red pepper as recommended by others. The kids found the cilantro and garlic too much (so I may try the parsley version and tone down the garlic) but the adults loved it!  Very very good!

Loved this dip.  I stored in small containers and took on my lunch for a quick, high protein snack.  Yum.

This is great! I used it for a sandwich spread and added more lemon juice (3 lemons) to match my personal taste. YUM!

It was OK to use up some white beans I had on hand, but I wouldn't make it again.

I omitted the cilantro (because I didn't have any- but will be sure to try with it!)  used less lemon juice and served this with homemade pita chips. Yum!

I would recommend to adjust the recipe. The lemon taste overpowers the dish somewhat. Less lemon and more garlic.

This was okay. Not as flavorful as I had expected.
