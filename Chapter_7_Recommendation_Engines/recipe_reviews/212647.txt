This was really good! Ihad some cooked chicken breast so I used that,and used frozen mixed`veggies instead of peas (which my kids hate). I also added cheese. This was liked by the whole family,including my very-picky 11 year old son!

The kids (8 and 11) would rate this five stars.  A nice addition is to add parmesan to the top in addition to or instead of bread crumbs.

I've been making an almost identical version of this for years now. It's simple and easy and really not a bad flavor on it's own, with no added seasoning. For that reason this recipe is a part of my regular rotation. I make it every other week or so. I usually use Italian flavored bread crumbs and salt the water for the noodles for added flavor.

I add a can/jar of sliced mushrooms, some minced garlic, pepper.  Also I use the cooked grilled chicken from the refrigerated case in the grocery, instead of caned.  For the topping, I crush up seasoned stuffing.

Very good!  I didn't use the peas because my husband doesn't like them.  I did add some cheddar in the mix and used tuna instead of chicken.  Very easy to make.

it was just ok...no one really ate much of it though and the leftovers went to waste. i'm always trying new recipes, and ask my family if its a yes or no to make again. this was an all around unanimous NO.

Pretty tasty. Definitely tastes like some kind of chicken helper boxed dish but its probably better. I added fresh mushrooms, onion, and carrots and 1 and 1/2 cans CofC. I followed another persons review and added fried onion topping. Definitely worth it! It was hard to fill a 9X13 baking dish, maybe next time I'll add more noodles and the rest.

Add some poultry spices. Kids ate it. Used fresh broccoli, uncooked, and it was great.

Made this last night and really enjoyed it.  I added extra bread crumb topping.  My daughter can be picky but she loved it.  I might try one reader's suggestion and use french fried onions next time. I did use canned peas because that's what I had on hand.  Very tasty.  Will make again!

Great basic recipe for a quick dinner.  Time not being an issue when I made it, I sauteed an onion in 1 Tablespoon of butter, then added the soup etc.  Also added a can of cream of celery soup.  Thawed  2 frozen chicken breasts in crockpot with 1 cup of chicken broth.  Shredded cooked chicken.
Very good.

This was good, but I took another reviewer's advice and added a sprinkle of cheddar cheese and french fried onions to the top instead of breadcrumbs and butter and it was great. I also added a little garlic powder to the mix.

very good hearty meal but i had to add some cheese because my family loves it and i used grilled meat as well from refrigerated section but was kind of bland so while cooking i added some season salt and pepper...will definitely make again but next time will not mix butter and breadcrumbs because it made chunks, will just sprinkle breadcrumbs over the top

I used cooked, shredded chicken and added in some corn.  I also cooked this in some ramekins because my kids love the individual dishes.  Great, easy weeknight meal that we all enjoyed!

my husband loved it, i liked it. a perfect use for left over chicken. i changed it some: i used fresh chicken, a frozen veggie mix of carrots, corn and asparagus, and elbow macaroni. super easy and came out great but i had to double the amount of breadcrumbs; two tablespoons is just not enough!

This was pretty good!  I used fresh veggies (green beans, mushrooms and broccoli), whole wheat noodles, and three cans of cream of mushroom soup.  Next time I think I'll add some pepper and parmesan cheese.  Yum!

My husband and I tried this tonight, and we both enjoyed it.  I had to make some changes based on what I had on hand.  I used cream of mushroom soup in place of the cream of chicken, and did not add peas.  We added some shredded cheese before eating.

Very good.  I made a few modifications, but I don't think they were significant.  They made it a slightly more interesting meal for me but still stayed fairly close to the original.

I'm kind of tired of peas, so I only put in about 1/3-1/2 cup of peas and added onions and carrots like someone else suggested.  Next time I'll either shred the carrots or used canned (or previously cooked) carrots since my little carrot chunks were not cooked in only 25 minutes.

Oh, and I used a can of cream of chicken and mushroom soup instead of just cream of chicken because I had that on hand.  I think it would be equally good without the mushroom.

Well I made a mistake while making this (as usual), but I'll get to that in a second. So I started by using 2 cans of soup instead of 1. I poured it into a bowl and mixed in about 3 tsp of spur cream. For the chicken I seasoned it with some chicken fajita seasoning and pepper. Added both to the dish, mixed in milk and frozen mixed veggies. I forgot to add butter so I just cut up some thin slices and placed them on top, covered my casserole and placed in the oven for 10 mins. Then I took it out, stirred it up, covered it, and placed back in the oven for another ten mins. I took it out again, added a sprinkle of cheddar cheese and crushed butter garlic cracker crumbs and placed in the oven uncovered for 5 mins. It was very good although I think next time I'll season it more.

I've been making this for a couple years, adding a can of mushrooms or fresh sauteed mushrooms and using rotisserie chicken makes a nice flavor and texture difference!

This was pretty good.  I didn't have frozen peas so I used canned peas and instead of bread crumbs I topped with cheddar cheese and added some onion.  My husband ate three helpings so that tells me it was pretty good.  He usually doesn't eat that much.  I will keep this in mind on those nights I don't feel like cooking.  Easy to through together.

It was easy and okay.  I will make it again, but it really needs a little help in the flavor department.  I will try some of what people suggested here.
