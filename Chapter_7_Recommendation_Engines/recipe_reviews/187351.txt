This is fantabulous!  My husband was still raving about it this morning. My daughter took a small portion and immediately went back and got more.  Only made a few modifications: 1. used fat free half and half and worked out great 2. sprinkled just a bit of red pepper on as was suggested by another for a little zing 3. used linguini noodles just because I think spaghetti noodles are boring 4. used cooked shrimp and added later in process as I had them on hand-would not advise doing this as they got a little tough, recommend following the recipe. It was also a very pretty dish! Thanks!

Most excellently orchestrated! Totally delish. Didn't change a thing except to add tomatoes at the end. So, when are you going to create another masterpiece?

This was so easy and yummy! I made enough for leftovers, thank goodness, because we absolutely loved this recipe. I added about a teaspoon of red pepper, just for spiciness, while cooking the mushrooms and shallots. I also substituted 2 tablespoons of butter for olive oil. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This recipe has been on the radar (at least mine anyway) for a loooong time and frankly  I don't know why I haven't tried it until now - and I regret it.  Keri, I'm impressed.  You were certainly up to the challenge on this one.   To be given a prescribed, predetermined set of ingredients, as was the case here, and come up with a dish - let alone one as good as this - takes a seasoned and creative cook so kudos to you!  I changed the cooking method  a little for my own comfort level, and didn't measure anything precisely.  But aside from using heavy cream rather than half and half and a mix of butter and olive oil, I did not deviate from your creation.  Hubs took my mom out for dinner tonight at a very nice restaurant in Milwaukee (I'm in Naples) and I can only hope their $$$$ dinner was even half as good as mine.  This is just a simply beautiful dish all the way around, in presentation as well as taste.  No need to deviate from your recipe at all.  It's perfect.

Whoa nelly, this makes a lot of food! I added the tomatoes at the end so they were still a little firm, and I only fad frozen spinach. I also found that I needed a little more half-and-half. It turned out great though. I was looking for a recipe that I could make fast and without having to go to the store, since we were low on groceries and it was raining out. This one fit the bill. Thanks AR exchange gang!

Wow Keri! This is delicious! Everyone loved it and made a point of mentioning that they would love to have it again soon. I followed the recipe except used sliced mushrooms (instead of diced), a mixture of Roma and Grape Tomatoes (to use up what I had on hand) and a little more half & half and Parm (to stretch the sauce to serve 6). The sauce is absolutely incredible. I usually cut the wine back a little in recipes but used the amount called for and it was perfect. I love the fresh, bright flavor the lemon juice gives this. My daughter's friend was here when we served this. She insisted on taking the recipe home with her when she left. Compliments all around. We will enjoy this often. Thanks so much for sharing!!

Wonderful recipe!  I used sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil instead of fresh.  I did place the tomatoes in paper towels to absorb some of the oil to keep the dish from being to oily.  I used a 6 oz bag of baby spinch too.  My husband said he felt this was restaurant quality!

Thanks Keri et. al. for your wonderful creation.  My whole family loved it. I made it as posted except used swiss chard instead of spinach as it needed to be used or tossed out.  I eyeballed everything and ended up putting too much pasta in the sauce and it ended up a little dry...maybe next time I'll measure and it will turn out perfect!

Very meh.  Even using two full T of minced garlic, the shimp taste overpowered the spinach, tomatoes  and mushrooms.  I love shrimp, but I felt like I was eating Shrimp Stew... not a pasta dish.  I won't make this again.

Keri and the gang, this was one delicious meal. I had some lump crabmeat so I added that as well. The sauce was soooooo good and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. I will make this again for company. Thanks for a terrific dinner!!

This recipe rocks!  We will definitely make it again for guests.  My entire family was on board to help out with the prep.  We decided splitting up the prep is definitely the way to go.  It comes together pretty quickly after the prep is done.  This Gang recipe was made by my whole gang.  The results were unanimous, it is delicious!  We did not change a thing.  It was terrific just as written.  Thank you, Recipe Exchange members!  This recipe is a keeper!

I did add a couple shakes of red pepper flakes, used diced can tomatoes Italian style and fat free half and half. I also doubled up on the veggies. Super delish!

I made this dish last night exactly as written except I doubled every ingredient as I always do. I did not "mince" the shallots or garlic (I chopped them).  Also I cut my mushrooms in half "not diced" and cut my grape tomatoes in half, left some whole (not quartered) just for personal preference.  Used "angel hair" pasta as it is our fav and does not take away from the flavors!!  Oooops, I also added quite a bit of "red pepper" for some added spice!  At the end I did add more wine and a tad more haf-and-half just because we LOVE our recipes with extra sauce!!  Also, besides the "shredded" parmesan, I added "grated" parmesan to each dish and topped with culy parsley.  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, I make a similar recipe (which I should post) at the end of the summer using all of my leftover veggies from the garden.  Zuccini, red, yellow, green peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, etc. but no half-and-half....similar but lighter for all of those left over garden veggies.  This is a very good recipe and you MUST use "uncooked" shrimp.......YUM, can't wait for leftovers tonight.  My family consists of ages 7 to 53 and as always, EVERYONE LOVED.  ENJOY ~ Thanks Exchange Gang!

This was quick and absolutely delicious.  My husband commented on it again this morning!  I made it with home-made fettucini which made it even better, and I also added some cubed fish, but the sauce was really the star.

I took the fancypants off this recipe, by which I mean I made lots of substitutions with stuff I had around the house that was all a little simpler. And it was still quite good. The subs I made were that I replaced the shallots with onions, the shrimp with chicken and extra garlic, the white wine with cooking sherry, the half-and-half with milk, and the grape tomatoes with romas. Next time I make it I will cut back on the lemon juice just a smidge; it wasn't overpowering but it was detectable. Or maybe I'll fresh squeeze a Meyer lemon.

Very good!!  I followed the basic recipe making some minor adjustments / adding some additional ingredients and we all loved it!  Will definitely make again!  I used the spaghetti noodles as called for (but used 1/2 reg spaghetti and 1/2 wheat spaghetti b/c that's what we had) and grilled sweet onions with the mushrooms and garlic instead of using shallots.  Also added some fresh brocolli, sliced red pepper and yellow summer squash/zucchini after grilling the onions/mushrooms for awhile.  I put a lid on the pan to steam the veggies some while I put some ready-to-eat shrimp (without tails), little butter and garlic in a seperate pan to cook up some then added it to the veggie mix.  I made double the sauce by adding double the white wine, double lemon juice & double cream/milk (used 1/2 cup half & half and 1/2 cup reg/skim milk & double parmesan cheese.  I made some garflic bread and salad as a side.  Sooo good!  FYI- I made double the sauce it called for b/c I added the extra ingredients and recipes never seem to end up adding enough sauce.  Will deifinitely be making again! Thank you for sharing!!

This was excellent!  I sauteed my onions and mushrooms along with minced garlic first and since I was using cooked shrimp, I added them along with the spinach and tomatoes closer to the end as many other reviewers noted.  I used light half and half and gave a nice sprinkling of red pepper flakes before serving over whole wheat spaghettini, yummy!

This was really bland. I think the half and half ruined it. It needs fresh basil and oregano.

I added some red bell pepper and I think everything else was by the recipe.  Used Angel hair pasta and it was fantastic.  Possibly add asparagus next time.  Fantastic meal and it's very simple.

This was great.  Added bacon and a little more cheese than the recipe called for, but I like a thicker sause.  I also added bacon that I crumbled. Very good.  Will make again.

This dish has become a staple at our Christmas Eve table for three years and running.  It is excellent as is, but for my personal preference I increase spaghetti to 3/4 lb. (It is still LOADED with shrimp.) Tomatoes are cut in half rather than quarters and added with spinach at the end.  I increase wine to 1/2 cup and use light cream.  Unlike half and half, light cream is readily available at my market in a smaller size and the store brand contains less fat.  For such an elegant meal this is very easy to make.  My entire family loves it!

Delicious.  The only change I made was using diced plum tomatoes instead of the grape tomatoes because that is what I had on hand; and  I added the shrimp and wet ingredients at the same time to assure that the shrimp would not get tough.  Everyone enjoyed it.

The recipe is good but compared to a few other simpler shrimp recipes I've tried this is more work so while I will make it again, it won't be as often as some others

This dish was fabulous.  I loved the different flavors mixed together.  I basically made the recipe as directed with the exception that I added some basil and crushed red pepper per other reviewers.  Will be making again.  Thanks Keri for the recipe!

I was really pleased with this recipe.  It was satisfying and had a good combination of flavors.  I made a few changes, but nothing that would greatly affect the flavor.  I doubled the sauce and added the sauce components directly to the noodles.  After everything was hot, I stirred in a couple of beaten eggs to thicken. I kept the tomatoes whole because I like how they pop open in your mouth when they are cooked just right.  I made the veggies and shrimp separate because I wanted a more "layered" pasta as compared to having everything integrated.  Thanks for the recipe!  We will be having it again.

I wanted to make a shrimp dish yesterday. I found this in my files and said Yes! This is it! I did make a few changes Only out of necessity. I was out of spaghetti so I used Penna instead. I did not have any wine so I subbed chix broth. There was a little too much liquid in the pan,and for that, I used the goat cream cheese I had in place of the 1/2 & 1/2 cream. I Finally found the broccoli Rab, I have been looking for, forever. I added that instead of the spinach.I was pressed for time and used cooked shrimp.This dish was the BOMB!! The Whole family and 1 cousin ate the entire dish!! I sprinkled the parm on at the end and added the tomatoes at the end like some reviews said to. This was a wonderful dish!! Thanks to everyone who contributed to the creation of such a fine meal!! I rounded it out with toasted garlic bread. AAHHH Keeper! Thanks Deb!! You Rock!!

I added an extra shallot and clove of garlic but for some reason there wasn't a lot of flavor.  I was really looking forward to this but for some reason, even with all of the flavorful ingredients, it was bland.  Sorry!!

Thanks to the exchange gang...i don't know how you did it but i wish i had been a part of it...i followed the recipe to a T and it was great. The only thing i would do different would be to thicken the sauce but thats just personal taste. (oh, i did add crushed red pepper flakes as suggested by others so i guess i didn't follow the recipe to a T...sorry, i lied!

Wow, family loved it.  Next time I'm making a double recipe!  Made recipe as stated except, I used canned mushrooms (Didn't have fresh), I used chicken stock (Didn't have wine) & used Romano cheese instead of parmesan cheese.

I've been wanting to try this recipe, but to do so had to make some changes because of allergies in my household.  So I switched the shrimp (shell fish allergy) with pre-grilled chicken, didn't include the mushrooms (sad, I know,-allergy again), and used chicken stock instead of white wine.  The result was still wonderful, and the next time it's just me eating and not hubby, shrimp and mushrooms will be added.  But, if you have a similar concern in your family, the Parmesan cream sauce was divine with the seasonings spinach and tomato.  Better than most things I've had at OGarden.

Very tasty and simple.  I followed this recipe almost to a tee.  I did use low-fat half and half and a little less butter.  My kids (8 yrs and 6 yrs) loved it too!

This turned out really great. I didn't have shallots so I used half an onion, and I didn't have half-and-half, so I used milk. I also didn't use shrimp as a vegetarian option. I do feel like it's missing so kind of seasoning, like parsley or basil, something. Really great, though. Will make again.

This was GREAT!!! My husband LOVED it. No leftovers. The sauce was not very thick but no big deal. I used fat free half and half, and I used 2 chopped plum tomatoes instead of grape tomatoes. I always make whole wheat pasta and used rotini since that held the sauce better than I thought spaghetti would. I will definitely make this again and again, thanks Keri!

This came out fabulous.  We used corn/quinoa pasta to make it gluten free but otherwise made no other changes.  The only thing I think I may do next time is cut the tails off the shrimp before cooking them.

An instant favorite!  My crew has dubbed it "Gangsta Pasta".  I substituted chicken broth for the wine and and added broccoli, asparagus, zucchini, yellow squash and red pepper.  Awesome way to get your vegetables!

I made this substituting some ingredients.  I used green onions for the shallots and chopped, on the vine tomatoes for the grape tomatoes.  I did change the cooking method just a bit.  After sautéing the onions and mushrooms, I added the garlic and sautéed until fragrant and then added the tomatoes, wine,lemon juice and half & half.  I heated this until it began to gently simmer and added the shrimp.  Once the shrimp had turned pink, I stirred in the spinach and covered it to help wilt the spinach.  The spinach wilted within a minute or so and then I plated this over linguine.  Excellent dish!  I was concerned that the shrimp would get tough if I allowed them to simmer for an additional ten minutes as indicated in the recipe.  But by eliminating all that simmering time assured that the shrimp would be perfectly cooked and not at all tough.  Good job Exchange Gang!

I used the exact ingredient, but made minor alterations to the directions so I wouldn't risk overcooking the shrimp. I think that a red bell pepper and a pinch of red pepper flakes would work with this.

So good, yet so simple!  The only changes I made were based on what I had on hand.  Finely diced onion for the shallot, and diced regular slicing tomatoes for the grape tomatoes.  Though next time I would give the halved tomatoes a squeeze to remove some of the juice, it was still fabulous... not to mention quick and easy.

Really a great recipe!  I made it as written except I did omit the mushrooms as the DH doesn't like them.  Also, I added the tomatoes just after I wilted the spinach down.

Wonderful and so adaptable!  I didn't have grape tomatoes, so used canned (drained), no white wine (used vermouth), used frozen spinach (drained).  Prepared rigatoni (no spaghetti on hand) and lightly oiled a baking dish and put pasta on top.  Put the slightly modified recipe on top and then grated about a cup of cheddar on top.  In the oven for about 25 minutes and had guests going in for THIRDS!  Makes a ton of food and so simple.  Thanks for the recipe - a definite keeper.

This was amazingly good and easy to cook! I am a real amateur and I still was able to pull this dish off very well. This will be one of those recipes that I will cook for years to come.

Perfect!  I added a dash of cayenne for a slight kick.  My sauce was watery, but that was my fault.  I quick-thawed my shrimp and frozen spinach in water at room temperature within 30 minutes of cooking.  Because they didn't fully drain I put 1 teaspoon of flour in the mixture and that helped.  Next time I will plan ahead with both the shrimp and spinach.  Thank you Exchange Gang!

Hats off to you Keri for this delicious meal. All of the flavors fused together beautifully. I added an additional clove of garlic (because we love garlic) and I used Linguini noodles instead of spaghetti. There is quite a bit of prep so I recommend getting everything diced and chopped up before you delve in. A+! Thank you so much for this recipe, I absolutely love it.

This recipe was so good! My boyfriend ended up licking his plate clean (well, basically haha). The sauce didn't "thicken" as much as expected but this is probably because I used much more mushrooms and tomatoes than called for.  I thought about adding some flour to thicken the sauce up but it didn't really need it. I'm not sure what other reviewers are talking about when they say it requires a lot of prep time.I didn't think so. When cooking, everything should be chopped, diced, minced etc before you begin cooking. If you want to cut down the prep time, buy pre-sliced mushrooms, pre-minced garlic etc.

I finally convinced my grilfriend to eat seafood tonight and this was the perfect dish.  It's great because it doesn't sit heavy like other pastas and the colors are so vibrant, it's a treat.  Definitely took everyones note about cooking the tomatoes a little later. I actually threw them in close to finishing (about 5 to 8 minutes before) and it was perfect.

Simple to make and tasted pretty good but nothing to wow about. Followed the recipe pretty much exactly except for one thing- used a can of fire roasted tomato(drained) instead of fresh.

I made this today, doubled the recipe for my family of 3 teenage boys, my preteen daughter and my Hubby. I was so eager to make this, so I subbed the white wine with chicken broth and the half and half for 2% milk. The entire family enjoyed this. I served it with some good crusty french bread. A very easy dinner but looks and tastes wonderful! Try it, you will not be disappointed!

This was very tasty. I doubled up on the recipe. I used fresh spinach from the garden but did add some more frozen spinach because I love spinach. I ended up having to make extra pasta for the sauce because it tasted soooo good! I served it with "Sweet and Savory Kale" which complemented the dish. Thanks Keri and the AR Exchange Gang for creating such a delicous meal.

I'm afraid I didn't like this one, too many ingredients that don't really mesh well, there was nothing in it to really wow the senses, the earthiness of the mushrooms didn't jibe well with the shrimp, if I make this again I will omit the mushrooms, perhaps even the spinach, the visual appeal of cooked spinach does nothing to help this dish.  It all sounds good but when assembled it's not a pretty dish and that's about half the value of a recipe.

Delicious.  I prepped everything before the guests arrived  and this came together so quickly.  Everyone loved it.  I used Italian tomatoes and increased the sauce a bit but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely.  Next time I would add more spinach just to veg it up some but this is really a good recipe. Could use scallops or chicken - highly customizable.

Very tasty dish. I used angel hair pasta instead of spaghetti. I would caution about the total amount of cooking time for the shrimp, it can easily become overcooked and tough.  I also increased the amount of sauce because the pasta quickly soaks it up.

I would definitely make it again.  I substituted vodka instead of the wine, and I used wide Lo Mein Noodles instead of spaghetti.  I didn't have cream, so I substituted "Sweet Cream" coffee creamer.  My husband, said it was restaurant quality.  It will definitely be made again.

My family chowed down on this. It’s fatty, with the butter and cream, full of cholesterol with the shrimp, but tasty. I substituted for the mushrooms, spinach, and grape tomatoes with fresh corn, squash, red pepper, kale, and cold diced tomatoes on top. Fresh parsley or basil would be a good topping also.

I’ve made this many, many times & it’s always a big favourite!  Sometimes I use shrimp but it’s also fantastic with cut up boneless skinless chicken breasts. Also great with sun dried tomatoes instead of fresh!

Definitely a keeper!  Husband loved it. It was very good and easy to make.  I only had frozen pre-cooked shrimp and used that.  I will use uncooked shrimp next time per recipe instructions, as I think the shrimp might have gotten a tad well done, but that was my fault- not the recipe's.  I also only had about 1/2 of the mushrooms on hand vs. what recipe called for- but it didn't seem to distract from taste.  I believe you could omit entirely if you wanted and this would still be great. I would not hesitate to recommend and will be making this again.

Very good. Used white onions instead of shallots and chicken instead of shrimp.  Will use shrimp next time. Otherwise pretty much followed the recipe. Used shredded and grated Parmesan..  Used 4 servings pasta measuring tool and was more than enough for two meals for 2 of us.

Great recipe!  Wonderful taste and presentation.  Most of my guests added red pepper flakes and/or hot sauce to their servings.  We also used fat-free half and half, and it still came out delicious and surprisingly creamy!

This turned out really good!  The only sub I made was to use chicken broth instead of the wine and then I served over fettuccine noodles.

Made this last week. We really enjoyed it.  The h@rest part was cleaning the shrimp.  Next  time  I will buy it already cleaned. Taste  was great. Served it over pasta.

The only things I did different was that I added 2 bags of spinach and some extra shrimp.  It was very bland.  There is a lack of spice to this dish.

This was amazing! I followed the recipe to the dot with the exception of using spaghetti squash rather than regular spaghetti. My 8 year old lived it!

Delicious ! Only change was that I used an 8 oz container of fresh mushrooms and frozen pre-cooked shrimp (I always have some in the freezer)

My husband is STILL raving about this dish so I decided that I would write my first ever review.  This was sooo good.   I won't say I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT...... that really bugs me.  My changes were minimal, I used cream instead of half and half and served it over fettuccine.  My husband also said that it was restaurant quality and he had not read any of the reviews .  It was the perfect meal for Valentine's Day and when my hubby asked me to make sure and make it again, that was the best Valentine's gift I could have gotten.

This was really good. I tried the recipe as it was written. I added some ground garlic and sea salt towards the end to give it more flavor. i had more than enough sauce at the end so i let it sit for a while to let a thicken. i would suggest adding the shrimp at the end with the half and half to prevent the shrimps from turning out chewey. i will try this again but with a little less half and half next time

We loved it. Took longer to prep than 15 minutes though. Took me nearly that long to clean, peel and cut the mushrooms. Like mentioned before next time I'll add the tomatoes later, so I don't have skins floating around, I think I'd like a little more spinach also. I failed to reduce the sauce enough this time, but I know better now I will keep this recipe and make it monthly.

I excluded the shallots because a guest can't eat them for digestion reasons.  I also added asparagus to try and add some flavor that was lost from excluding the shallots.  The asparagus added a bit of a sourness to the final product.  It wasn't offensive but I would like to try this again when I can follow the recipe as it was written.

Wonderful! I made a few modifications, but stayed very true to the recipe. I didn't have shallots, so used 1/2 a sweet onion, diced very fine. I love veggies so I used more - a pint of grape tomatoes, halved, 10 oz sliced mushrooms, extra garlic, & doubled the spinach. So I also had to increase the sauce - doubled that. Unfortunately I didn't have enough raw shrimp, so I used the cooked shrimp and didn't add that in until I added the spinach. Since I used extra veggies in the recipe, I just served with garlic bread. It was a hit with the family! Thank you Keri and gang!

Ahmazing. I sub linguini. Sub red onion only because I didn't have shallots on hand. Also, I cut the parm cheese. It seemed unnecessary. It was sooo good. I will for sure make this again. For. Sure.

I made up something like this recipe last night except I roasted the split cherry tomatoes with pieces of fresh asparagus, left out the spinach.  These ingredients work great  if you add chopped fresh basil.

Loved it!  I made 2 small changes. First I added about 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper along with the tomatoes and garlic to add just a little heat. Second, I doubled the amount of sauce, because my family always says there is no such thing a too much sauce, but I don't really think that it needed the extra sauce.  This was a very tasty dish that I will be making again.

I tried this recipe on a whim after my husband requested "something Italian." The husband loved it and I was relieved it turned out :) I made it again today, after another request from you know who. It's so simple but quite tasty!

This was so GOOD! It remind me of my favorite Cheesecake Factory dish - Bistro Shrimp Pasta. Now I can make my favorite pasta at home. I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. I used regular onions, mushrooms that were previously frozen, can chopped tomatoes, chicken broth (instead of wine), arugala, and Kraft parmesan can cheese. And with all theses changes it was still delicious!

I really like this recipe.  I'm not a very good freestyle cook but I can follow a recipe like a champ.  I didn't have any mushrooms and I used sweet onion instead of Shallots due to what I had on hand.  The flavour was very good.  The timings and qtys were spot on for combining flavours.  This was very easy to follow and turned out a really delicious and colourful meal in a short period of time.

Thought this was a quick and delicious meal.  I substituted grilled chicken for the shrimp and red onion (all I had in the fridge) for the shallots and it was excellent!

Thank you for this.  I made this for a very special dinner and fireworks should have gone off at first taste.  Absolutely amazing!  This is definitely a keeper!

This was delicious!  Left out the mushrooms cause I didn't have any and added just a bit of cornstarch/water mix to the sauce to thicken it up quick cause we were starving!  One of my new favorite pasta dishes!  Thanks Keri!

Amazing! We added an entire bulb of garlic, but that is just our family. Delicious without adding anything though!

overall this recipe was very good. it was very easy to prepare and all ingredients were very well balanced. i made this exactly as written and found it a little bland that is why it gets only a four. will definetly make again, just kicked up a little bit. thanks for the inspiration keri, you did a great job.

good meal... would like more sauce so next time I'll probably use a little more cream and try experimenting with some sun-dried tomatoes or red peppers

I remember seeing this post on RE and was glad that it got published. And now I have the chance to try it out for myself and leave a review! I did make a few minor changes. I used a cup of diced (possibly Roma) tomato, one cup frozen-then-thawed torn spinach, cooking cream (also called heavy cream), cooked shrimp (which I added near the end of cooking to heat them through), penne instead of spaghetti, lemon-lime flavoured white wine beverage diluted with water to cut sweetness (still used lemon juice called for in recipe also to reduce the sweetness of the beverage, which actually worked). For big eaters, this makes two generous portions (like us, lol). Only thing that disappointed me was that the sauce didn't thicken as much as I would liked... Will use a little cornstarch next time to remedy that. Overall an excellent and filling dish that I will make over and over again. Thanks!

Good for a quick and easy meal. I agree that it could have used a little more flavor-maybe some oregano and basil would have helped.

Absolutely fantastic! I used diced chicken which was great, and I will definitely try shrimp when I have it on hand (I used pre-cooked shrimp so it will get added at the very end). I added a big pinch of crushed red pepper while simmering and the dish was perfect. Such a great set of ingredients - swapping out fresh and frozen depending on what you have in the kitchen works as well. I can't wait to make this again. Thank you for the recipe!

Very tasty but it was a bit bland.  I'll try the red pepper suggested by other reviewers next time.

I used big pasta shells instead of spaghetti.  It made sense with the shrimp. ;D  It was delicious though. My boyfriend and I had a good time making and eating this. And I got leftovers. Awesome.

Amazing pasta! I left out the spinach because I'm not a huge fan of cooked greens, but left everything else the same. The flavors in this are perfect. If you haven't made it yet, please do! You won't regret it.

I used half the butter, and subbed fat free half and half, and it was still delicious! Even my picky boyfriend liked it!  Thanks so much!

Very tasty, and actually quite easy to whip up.  This came together quickly which allowed me to have dinner on the table in no time.  I think next time, I'll use fire roasted tomatoes to create a little more liquid.  Maybe even roast my own fresh tomatoes; yum! I also like the suggestion of red pepper flakes by some of the previous reviewers.  Thanks for creating and sharing this recipe!

Delicious!.. I followed this recipe using Sherry for the wine because I love the taste.  My shrimp were pre-cooked so I didn't need to cook them as long...  I may try with yellow grape tomatoes next time and thicken just a tad since most of the sauce went to the bottom.  Thanks Keri and Gang!.. :)
