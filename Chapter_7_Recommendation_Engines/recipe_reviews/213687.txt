Exotic, spicy, delicious!  I reduced the salt & pepper, instead just shaking them well over the chicken & marinade mixture while stirring. I didn't have everything on hand so omitted tamarind, curry leaves; subbed canola for coconut oil, used yellow onions and whole dried red chili peppers cause that's what I had...  This was fabulous.  I think the quality of the curry powder matters, the recipe calling for at least twice what I've ever used in one dish before.  I used a Madras curry powder purchased at an Indian shop near my parish.  Served this to company, everyone had seconds.  Goes great with beer.

This curry was one of the best and most delicious I've ever had. It was rich and had a wonderful blend of flavours. Definitely a keeper. The only thing I will do differently in the future is to cut down on the salt a tad. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My boyfriend is Sri Lankan and I used this recipe to test out my Sri Lankan cooking ability! He thought it was as good as (if not better) than his parents chicken curries!

I used chicken thighs with skin and bones, more salt, 1/4 cup of home made tamarind liquid, a mit of extra chilli, and used cooking oil instead of high-saturated fat coconut milk

This was insanely flavorful, and very delicious!  The only thing I would change is reduce the salt - I used the recommended 1 tablespoon and it was really too much.  Next time I will cut that in half.  Great recipe!

This was very flavorful and the combination of spices was spot on.  Unfortunately I did not have the curry leaves or tamarind but I am sure that would have made it even better.  I used half the salt as some reviews mentioned and found it not lacking.  It was very spicy, even omitting all but one of the green chilies, I was the only one in my family who could eat it and my husband made everyone else sandwiches.  I would watch the spice level if you are serving to a family or are not that hardcore.

This is very good! I used a couple of dried red chilis, and it was fiery hot. Also, I dumped in a whole can of coconut milk by accident, but the consistency was still fine. Thanks for a great recipe. Delicious!

This is better than another curry recipe that I've tried previously.  I think the curry powder really matters.  I cut back on the green chili peppers and it was still very spicy.  The curry leaves made the dish very fragrant.  I cut back on the salt though.  I also let the meat marinate for a couple of hours before cooking.

The only thing I did differently was to allow the chicken to marinate in the tamarind, vinegar and spice mix for a few hours.  We eat Indian food all the time and loved this just as much.  I will absolutely make this again and again.

Delicious, even without tamarind juice. I replaced the curry leaves with large basil leaves and small green chile peppers with one roasted, skinned Anaheim pepper. I used ground cardamom instead of the pods.  I added the whole can of coconut milk.  I garnished it with cilantro.  Love this recipe.  It was very flavorful.  I'd probably add a dash of nutmeg to sweeten it just slightly or an extra cinnamon stick but even without those additions it was delicious. I would not replace the coconut milk as it is essential in my opinion to a good curry.

Truly Delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used just a dot of tamarind paste instead of juice, and i accidentally forgot to add the garlic. I didnt even notice. This dish with good spices and fresh ingredients is really lovely. I had to add a lot more water to cover the chicken however, but that was fine for me because it's such a strong curry. Yumm!!

My family enjoyed this dish very much. It has a lot of flavour. I only reduced the amount of the curry powder since here in India we make our own curry powder and it's kind of very spicy.
But a great dish to cook. Smells and taste like the a restaurant dish. 
Thanks for the recipe Sriyani.

Really delicious, but just a warning that it's very spicy , when using Badshah brand Madras Curry powder. I didn't have curry leaves or tamarind, but still delicious!  and also left out green chilies and it was plenty spicy! I also used probably 1.5 pounds of chicken thighs, without changing the amount of other ingredients and it was very flavorful and enough to cover all that meat, plus with plenty of sauce.

I've made this several times and its fantastic. Be sure to use Madras curry powder and fresh whole spices from an Indian store to really make the flavors pop. pour over rice and you've got a great meal.

Tried it minus the tamarind. After frying the onion, chilli, cardamom, curry leaves, etc. I made a paste of it. Loved the consistency. Best teamed with steamed rice.
