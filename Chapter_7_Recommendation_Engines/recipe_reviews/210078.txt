this is excellent with a few additions.  made exactly to recipe..pie was too solid,& not too flavorful.so the 2nd time I added 1/4 lb of ground beef, 1 tsp Italian seasoning,1/2 teasp. basil & only 4 eggs.Also made it with 1/2 mozzarella & 1/2 Sharp cheddar.Excellent.  And as Laurie said, perfect cut cold for appetizers. My friends loved it. Thanks.

Replaced the pork, fennel, crushed red pepper, and salt with 1-1/2 lbs. hot Italian sausage removed from the casings because the pork mixture in the recipe is really just loose Italian sausage. If you don't like peppery heat, you could use mild Italian sausage instead. Didn't have Asiago, so I used Parmesan. Reminded me very much of something my Mom made all the time when we were kids, only she made it into calzones instead of a pie.
