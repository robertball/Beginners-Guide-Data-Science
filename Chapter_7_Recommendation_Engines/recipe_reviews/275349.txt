Tender, sweet, moist and delicious describes this cake.  My Sicilian Grandmother used to make a cake exactly like this one.  When she passed on I thought the recipe was lost forever.  A big THANK YOU to the person who posted this recipe!  My family loves it.

awesome!! replaced the glaze with a home made syrup made with 2 lemons juiced and zested 100g of sugar and 100ml of water.  Simmer till reduced and syrupy about 15 min.  Pour the syrup while hot on the hot cake.  Let the cake soak up the syrup

Made this for a New Years Party. Everyone loved it. Added extra lemon juice & zest to add to the lemon flavor since others said it needed more lemon flavor. Even added some lemon curd to the glaze.

Really delicious cake as is although I only cooked for 35 minutes and for the glaze I used 1cup confectioners sugar, juice from half a lemon, zest from a whole lemon and a tablespoon of limoncello. Light and very flavorful.

I wasn't impressed with the recipe - it came out flat and needed more lemon flavor.  I'm thinking my pan was too big?

This cake is all that it was meant to be! Light and fluffy with a great lemony taste. Moist and rich tasting. My family raved about it and I will make it again and again.

Very moist and great lemon flavor.  I baked in a 9 x 13 pan and used almond flavor in lieu of vanilla.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  Such a great cake, and I'll definitely be making it again!
