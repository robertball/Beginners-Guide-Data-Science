If I could give this more than five stars, I totally would.

This. Was. Wicked. I was skeptical that all these ingredients would work, but it TOTALLY does. I used Fireball cinnamon whiskey in place of the schnapps, as that was all I had. Everything else I kept the same. This was so flavor intense and burned on the way down. But, it was oh, so good. I would only make this every once and a while because of the kick. I recommend everyone try this at least once. And make sure your ingredients are CHILLED!

Yum Yum Yum!  If you leave out the Jaegermeister it's called a Gingerbread Man.  DEFINITELY use cinnamon liquor like Goldschlager.  I had a bartender make it with Aftershock and it was NASTY.  You're looking for the "hot" cinnamon as compared to the "cool" cinnamon flavor.  Just get Goldschlager and you can't go wrong.  Cheers!

The recipe I make doesn't call for cinnamon schnapps, but coffee liqueur. It's really good but very thick! Everything is in equal parts so I measure it out into a quart container and keep it in the fridge.  Served over ice on a cold, snowy night, there is nothing much better.  A good drink for winter time.  I don't think that I would want it when it's hot out.  I'll have to try it with the cinnamon schnapps!  That would add a little fire to it.  Try it with the coffee liqueur--Excellent.

We made these for our party without the jagermeister - and they were a big hit. Make sure you use regular cinnoman schnapps and not Red Hot or other extreme varieties.  We crushed up gingersnaps and rimmed the martini glasses and everyone loved them!

This was amazing it really did taste like an oatmeal cookie! I also made a 2nd drink only this time used some heavy whipping cream for an oatmeal creme pie drink which was also very good!
