Delicious...I omitted celery & used low-fat soup & fat-free sour cream & it did well...except the chicken was too tough. Next time I'll shorten the cooking time and/or pound the breasts flat.

I made this recipe for my picky husband who only eats chicken and wants me to find a million different ways to make it. He loved it. I omitted the vegetables (he doesn't like them) and I pounded the chicken thinner and seasoned it with a tiny bit of garlic powder. I also added red pepper and placed it on top of the chicken. I poured almost all of the soup mixture over the pasta before I placed the chicken on top so the noodles wouldn't get dry spots in them. Then I placed the chicken and peppers on top and poured the rest of the soup over it. It was delicious. He now regularly requests it.

Easy to prepare but no wow definitely needs something. May be a hit with kids I don't have any at home anymore.

I made this in a pan on the stove. While the spaghetti was boiling I also boiled the chicken (in separate pans). Used 1/2 can Campbells beef consumme instead of chicken broth 1 whole can cream of mushroom soup 8 ozs lite sour cream (we like our pasta kind of soupy). Topped with 3 cheese dry bread crumbs. Very yummy!

I cut the chicken in bite size pieces. I omitted the onions and celery (don't like). Used onion powder and celery salt. I added mozzarella cheese to the liquid mixture. And I added garlic powder and some parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs. My hubby and his buddies loved it. I'll make this again.

I followed the recipe pretty closely except I added about 1 tablespoon of minced onion to the sauce. I used fat free & reduced sodium where I could. I had leftover roasted chicken so I used that instead of uncooked pieces. I had about 1/4 cup of Parmesan that needed using too so I added that to the sauce. I also used only 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup white wine (I know tetrazzini usually has shery but all I had was chardonnay lol).... Ended up mixing it all together instead of just pouring it on top. Pretty good and fairly easy... always a winning combo in my eyes.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I omitted the celery because I didn't have any on hand, used boneless skinless chicken thighs cut up instead of breasts (our preference) and had to use canned mushrooms because I didn't have any fresh, but it was very good.  My only concern is that it didn't seem like all of the chicken was cooked through, so when I make next time, I think I will precook the chicken a bit.

Added carrots and a bit of mozzarella under the bread crumbs. My husband likes the crust browned so added a few minutes under the broiler. This was a fun easy dish!

I made it according to recipe. I found it to be very dry and didn't have much flavor. I cut the chicken up into smaller pieces and would probably make them even smaller next time.

My very picky kids loves this. I used chicken thighs instead of chicken breast and cut them up into cubes.

Made this pretty much as written except omitted the celery. Based on the feedback about seasonings I also added some celery salt Bell s poultry seasoning fresh garlic along with fresh cracked pepper. I d definitely make again except there was a lot of sauce so I will probably coat the spaghetti with soup me and then pour the rest over.

It turned out good preparation wise... but it definitely could've used something else. The seasonings could be better selected. I changed mine up a bit and used real garlic real onion and threw some parmesan in... but overall I've made better tetrazzini with more flavor using other recipes. Was it edible? Totally. Is it tweakable? Totally. I highly suggest using this recipe ONLY if you have an awareness of how to season. Would I use this recipe again? Nah.

I made this for dinner tonight. I did a couple things different. I used roasted garlic mushroom soup and, I also used only 8 oz of sour cream. It turn out creamy and very tasty.

follow the recipe to the T. As you can see I topped it off with shredded cheese before throwing it in the oven. It added the perfect touch!
