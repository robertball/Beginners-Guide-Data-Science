Yummy and Easy!!!! Would be great with Jasmine Rice.  I added fresh grated ginger and about 1 Tablespoon brown sugar.

Another 5 stars because my family really enjoyed how the  catfish was cooked in this recipe.  The only change I made was instead of using cooking oil I used butter.  Just a personnel preference over cooking oil for this recipe. Not having used coconut milk for much cooking this was a delightfully light, aromatic and delicious fish recipe.  I paired with a Trader Joe's Harvest Grains and frozen peas.  Yum! 
This one is in the recipe box

Took all the advice: added jalapenos, garlic, peppers and ginger. But the coconut milk made all the difference. Served over rice noodles. We really enjoyed this!

This recipe is awesome.  I added minced ginger and seeded & finely chopped jalepeno peppers.  When served, added some avocado slices to the plate and it was fantastic.  This is so much like one of my favorite Thai dishes I used to order.  Fast and easy, too!

I was looking for something other than fried. I’ve done ‘baked’ as well. I had some ‘Lite’ coconut milk and the rest of the ingredients…so thought I’d give it a go. Sorry purist rater types…I always change things up. For added heat I finally put some Harissa I’ve had to use as well. I also used minced fresh ginger to go w/ the garlic. Fish sauce is an option as well as sour cream. Turns out quite flavorful. Put it on rice or thin noodles or whatever. I used catfish nuggets since they were on sale for less than half the price for a fillet.

I'll be honest, when I saw these ingredients, I was a little afraid it wouldn't all work together. But I decided to go ahead with it anyway, and I'm glad I did! I followed the recipe exactly except for using light coconut milk. Once everything was cooked, I tasted it, and it tasted good as is; but I kinda felt like it could use a little "zing." So I added the zest and juice of 1 lime, and that really took it over the top! Great recipe, thank you!

Oh my this was yummy... I was looking for something different and love catfish but have only ever had it fried. I made this one but made it spicy how I like by adding to jalapenos. Seeds, ribs, and all. It was even great the next day... I had ran out of rice and used drained ramen noodles ..... that was even better than with the rice.

Great recipe!  I added a little bit of nutmeg and cinnamon to the sauce during the simmering process.  It came out delicious.

This was so bland and oily, even after adding cayenne and black pepper.  Sorry, didn't care for it.  If you try it, I would definitely try adding jalapenos or something.  I didn't, because of the kids.  Also, maybe cutting back on the coconut milk and using half flavorful broth instead to cut back the oiliness?  The sauce was somewhat good on the rice. . .
