This recipe is great!  I am not usually a chicken fan, because I don't like how dry it is, but this is not dry at all.  We have made this one several times.  The only problem I had is that it was a bit too salty.  I changed the croutons and switched to a soup with less salt, and the problem was fixed.

I took "Chikee's" advice by using 1 can crm of chicken, 1 can crm of mushroom and seasoning the chicken first.  Also, I added some chopped celery, and the last of my freshly sliced mushrooms. Added a little shredded cheddar cheese, used garlic & herb seasoned croutons, and served over hot rice.  Honestly - slop is right: it looks less than appealing BUT taste isn't too bad (not amazing but not bad either) and I esspecially appreciate the little amt of time it takes to prepare and cook - PERFECT for those hectic nights when cooking is THE LAST thing you want to do.  Will keep this in mind for those nights when I would rather poke my eyes out than cook.

Comforting and quick, but noted earlier reviews and used low-sodium soups.  Also, I eighthed two russet potatoes and sliced a red pepper into strips, adding them before the soup.  The potatoes reduce the salty flavor, and the red peppers added some color.  I suppose you could add chopped celery and onion, too. :)  Thank you!

This was very good and I did add garlic powder and black pepper to the chicken when I made it.  I also used Cream of Mushroom instead and my whole family enjoyed it including my two year old.  The sauce was very good with white rice.

Excellent and quick.  My picky youngest even likes it.  Used a can of Cr of Mushroom, Cr of Chicken and Cr. of Celery.  Baked at 400 for approx. 50-60 mins. but could be because of bigger chicken pieces.

First I made this recipe with cream of mushroom soup, and it was pretty good.  Then I made it with cream of chicken soup, as directed, and I did not like it very much.  It had too much chicken flavor, so I recommend the mushroom soup.

I agree with everyone else - croutons got too soggy and the whole dish was too salty.  I took some people's suggestion and added shredded 4 cheese which did help a little with the salty factor as well as add some more flavor.  I served with a garlic rice pilaf and a caesar salad.

Surprisingly yummy and EASY!  I used the 98% fat free soup and "restaurant style" larger croutons (weren't mushy in the end).  The soup and crouton mix created an instant stuffing and gravy to go with the chicken.  Meat was nice and juicy.  I liked the salty taste myself, went well with the chicken.  Very easy to make, and great for kids to help with.  Next time I'm going to throw some raisins in to add to the stuffing effect.  This busy mama gives it 2 thumbs up!

Very good, but a little too salty. I wouldn't recommend using 3 cans of cream of chicken.  Maybe cream of mushroom...

As is without changes, this recipe is blah boring.  Great to serve old people or those who like bland food.  Next time I will try adding chedder cheese and some of the other suggestions made by others.  It is super easy though, I like that.  I also think using a good quality crouton will make a huge difference than the cheap safeway brand.

Simple and quick as advertised. I substituted low sodium cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken soup. The crutons may have gotten soggy but that's the point right? They're supposed to end up like stuffing. I highly recommend this to my fellow lazy bachelors who are not afraid to use an oven once in a while. This generated many microwaveable leftovers.

This recipe was so so.  It lacks the extra ingredients of the spectacular Sour Cream Cheese Casserole from this site.  I suggest skipping this and trying that.

Very quick and easy, but I'd recommend using LIGHTLY seasoned croutons as the regular flavor makes the recipe quite salty.

This recipe was alright. I made it for some friends who got a look at it when I was taking it out of the oven and asked somewhat frightened "Is that dinner"? I did season the chicken beforehand,used garlic flavored croutons and baked with shredded cheddar on top. The taste was not bad, but some of my croutons were way too crunchy from being baked. I served this over rice and with a side salad.

Wonderful!!!  This was so easy to throw together and tasted very good.  I too seasoned my chix with garlic powder and black pepper, and halved the recipe, therefore using two cans of soup.  I used on cream of mushroom and one cream of chicken.  Will definately make again - thanks!

this tasted good, but looked bad.  my husband and son didn't want to try it.  i changed one can of cream of chicken to cream of celery.  i also added a little cheese and cut the chicken into large cubes.  i would make it again, but not often.  i didn't have a salty problem because i got low sodium soups.

The other reviews were right, this recipe was SO salty.  But because it was so easy, I will probably make it again, with low sodium soup.

I've made this a couple of times (I always give new recipes at least 2 chances) about 2 years ago and haven't made it again since. 
I agree with others, it does look sloppy. It was the best the first time we had it. I also subbed 1 can of cream of chicken soup with cream of mushroom. The chicken is somewhat bland, although would be a good standby for those nights where you don't feel like cooking and want to feed your family "real" food. 
I might make it again with some of the alterations that others have suggested, but I still feel that it probably won't have changed my mind - it's just what the name says - chicken slop.

5 stars for being so easy to make! I used Tyson Boneless Skinless Chicken Tenders (no thawing required, and substituted 3-4 for each breast), 3 cans of mushroom soup, and caesar croutons. I added some leftover stir fried beans to part of the dish just to test it out. Baked for 45 min. and that was it. Kids loved it and even ate the green beans. I'll make it again!

This was a great quick & easy main dish!  The chicken turned out very moist & juicy.  The crutons were a great addition!
