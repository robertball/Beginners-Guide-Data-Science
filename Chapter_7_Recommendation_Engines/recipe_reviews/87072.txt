Great olives but way too fussy for an appetizer.  What I ended up doing is stuffing the olives with crushed garlic mixed with fresh chopped thyme (dry would work too) and softened cream cheese.  I imagine some of the flavored cream cheeses would work too...possibly salmon-flavored cheese stuffed olives?  But still a good basic recipe that you can build upon.

The olives are very tasty but WAY too much work for what you get ... after mixing and filling two cans of black olives, I only had a little bowl of appetizer for my guests and it took me almost an hour to do.

if you like green olives you will love this. Everyone thought they were very yummy. I thought they were very easy to make and I will be making them again.

I questioned whether to use a whole bulb of garlic, and ended up using just 1 clove of garlic, which seemed to work perfectly for the amount of filling.

I recently made these at Thanksgiving this past year, they were AWESOME. It wasn't hard at all and filling the olives was very simple. I acuttaly doubled the cheese mixture which doubled as an awesome cheese spread.

The taste of these was SUPERB however I had trouble stuffing the olives. I used sever different tips but the mixture was too thick to run through them. I ended up stuffing by hand which was not only a lengthy process but a messing one to boot. If I can find the right tip to pipe with these wouldn't be a fuss at all and I would most definitely make these again. I can't wait to try this with green olives.
