I'm a big fan of this recipe.  When people invite me to holiday dinner parties, I'm expected to bring this dish.  I change the recipe a little, adding a half pound of crisp, crumbled bacon, sauteeing a cup or so of minced onion and fresh minced garlic instead of the dried stuff, and using pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar.  It's unusual to have any left over after the carnage.

This is a wonderful side dish.  I followed the suggestions of "pinewood" and added about 1/2 pound of cooked crumpled bacon.  I also sauteed about 1/2 cup of minced onion and 4 cloves of garlic instead of the dried stuff.  I also added a jalepeno pepper seeded and finely chopped to give it a little spice since I did not have any spicy cheese.  My whole family loved it.  We will make this again!

What I liked about this is that this is not your typical green bean casserole. This was great and easy to make.  I was a little hesitate when I saw corn as the ingredients but this turned out delicious. The corn and cheese are an added zip. One thing I did different was add some of the fried onion into the mix to give it a little crunch and there was still plenty left for the topping.  Rave reviews - will definetly make this again

I have made this recipe again and again - it has become a favourite among my family and friends. It is the most requested side dish I make. In lieu of white corn, I will add whatever I have on hand - usually frozen yellow corn or even frozen mixed vegetables (peas, carrots, corn and beans). I use onion powder if I don't have onion flakes on hand and it's just as tasty. Also, I use 2 cans of french fried onions as they seem to be a favourite topping. Delicious!

I'm not a huge fan of green bean casserole but this was really good.  I liked the addition of the corn and cheese.  Reheated it was a bit greasy from the cheese, but it was still very good.  I stirred in some of the French's onions and then also topped the casserole with them.  I omitted the salt because the onions are so salty and I was glad I did.  Thanks for the recipe.

So yummy! We devoured it tonight. The only change I made was that I used a 16 oz defrosted bag of frozen green beans instead of canned. I tried to get the lowest sodium cans of ingredients to keep it as healthy as possible. This has entered a permanent position in our meal rotation!

I made this for a church picnic; it was a nice change from the original green bean casserole....I don't think I'd ever go back to the original.  I forgot to buy jalapenos as one suggested so used red pepper flakes to add a little zip.  I got a little carried away and it was a bit spicy for some, however, my husband loved it.

This was pretty good.  We didn't "love" it but it was a nice change from the standard green been casserole - and I can definitely see using other veggies in it.  The only thing I did differently was use onion powder instead of the minced onion.

This was a nice twist on the classic recipe.  I didn't add salt because the amount on the onions was enough.  I did add a clove of garlic like another review said.  I'll be making this again.

Good recipe, way better than the basic one with just beans, mushroom soup & french-fried onions. My nephew, who will not eat green beans, had thirds! Thanks for sharing.

I followed the directions to a "T" and found that it was the least favorite out of everything I cooked... Everyone asked me for the traditional green bean casserole. I don't recommend this- especially for left overs! The cheese gets really greasy and leaves a weird after flavor.

A nice change - not quite your standard Green Bean Casserole, also not the same Shoepeg Corn & Green Bean Casserole I'm used to. I did use yellow corn (frozen) because it's what I had on hand and I used fresh onion sautéed in a little butter (again, because I had it & needed to use it up). I also replaced half the cheddar with pepper-jack cheese. Everyone enjoyed it!

My family LOVES this recipe.  It has been requested again and again.  Thanks for a wonderful jazzed up casserole.  Oh, and we add the bacon.  I haven't tried the pepper jack, but maybe this Thanksgiving we'll try something new!

This was so easy and good even when I ad lib the ingredients! I had no white corn so I used hominy, no cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of chicken, not enough cheddar, so I used 1/2 mexican blend, no onion flakes, so onion powder~ It was REALLY good! My 15 year old who hates everything even liked it!

Delicious way with vegies.  Cooked frozen beans then added 2 'cup'a'soup' packets (pumpkin) to the beans and the water they were cooked in. Used lite cheese as that was all I had on hand some cheddar and some mozerella mixed in sauted onion.  Pretty much what was on hand all mixed in very tasty.

Well it was a change but not something I'll make again.  I must admit I prefer cut green beans to French style and I might like it better using those but I'm not sure I'll make it again.  Didn't taste bad just not something anyone raved about.

LOVED THIS SIDE DISH!!!  I seem to always be looking for a change in side/vegatable dishes for supper.  Seems like I'm always doing the same boring grn.bean cass or just openning up a can of plain vegatables.  My husband (who's never been a huge fan of g.b.cass) fell over for this.  It's a "must try"/"must keep" recipe!!!

OMG! I am a vegeterian and have made many vegetable casseroles including the traditional green bean casserole and the added cheese and corn in this recipe  makes an amazing difference. The only thing I changed was instead of white corn I used a can of the mixed yellow and white corn, that was what I had and it came out so good that is what I will continue to do. My husband begs me to make it every time we have our Sunday potlucks at church and it is always quick to go!

Made this as a side dish at Christmas, I ate it as a meal, myself and went back for more.  I LOVED it.  The corn added a great "crunch".  Delicious.

I make this every year and I always get so many compliments. I have been making this recipe for 6 or 7 years now. I add about a cup and a half of cooked white rice to it (one small "boil in a bag"). You can also add chicken to it and it becomes a main dish.

Very tasty alternative to traditional green bean casserole. Next time, I'll go easy on the cheese and french fried onions and add some bacon, as other reviewers suggested.

Wow !! Changing up the standard green bean casserole recipe was scary for me but I’m so glad I gave it a shot this Thanksgiving!!! It was a total hit.  I didn’t have any dried onion flakes on hand so went with dried chives.  I used a 1/4 less than they asked since chives can be powerful.  I used Mexican style shredded cheese and a can of grilled corn, just all stuff I had on hand.  I added about 1/2 tsp of salt and pepper to taste, added my fried onion strings on top for the last 5 mins of baking.  SO GOOD.  I was worried about it being too salty but it was perfect.  This was the first dish to disappear, everyone loved it.  Thanks for this amazing recipe!!!

I added cooked chicken to the bottom and served it as a main dish. Wonderful! I didn't use as much cheese as it called for and I used onion powder instead of flakes. Also only used 4oz of fried onions. My 6 yr old didn't like it but I think it's because she isn't used to green beans. This was basically how I make tater tot casserole though. Chicken instead of ground turkey and no tots. I always add corn and greens to tater tot casserole to make it a little healthy.

Used a Garlic Cream of Mushroom soup as well as added some Maple and Brown Sugar bacon, fried and cut up, to the dish and it was great. First time there was NONE of the casserole left. Nieces and nephews asked for more!!!!

I made this recipe last year and I am getting requests for it again this year. Green bean casserole was not part of our traditional recipe but will be from last year on out because of this simple but great recipe.

Not very good. I made it for my family and no one thought it was that great. I prefer company green bean casserole instead.

Fantastic!  I made this for Thanksgiving dinner to take to my boyfriends parents house and everyone loved it.  His mother, sister and my mother all asked for the recipe, which is a high compliment coming from them.  I made the recipe exactly as instructed except I added a little more minced onion in the mix for added flavor and used garlic salt and garlic pepper instead of regular salt, pepper, and garlic powder as that was what I had on hand.  It is a great recipe and the corn really made it tasty and different than others.  This is now my official green bean casserole recipe!

I love the corn & cheese in the mix, but it was a bit too creamy.  I think less cheese would solve the problem.
