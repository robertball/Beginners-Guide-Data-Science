Based on everyone else's suggestions, I doubled the cream cheese (four bricks total) and these were awesome. It made a ton of wontons (more than one package of wrappers). I deep-fried half and them steamed the rest in my steamer for 12 minutes -- they came out wonderful (and no fat from the oil). Some people preferred the fried, others preferred the steamed -- every single one was eaten. Yum!

WOW!!   Excellent taste...the sesame oil and scallions are a must in this recipe...the flavors were perfect together.....made them for a family gathering.....they were gone!! Will make these again and again....I used canned  lump crab meat which i like better.

This recipe is very good and easy. I used egg-roll wrappers instead of wontons.I also served it as a dip with crackers.

this is absolutely the most disgustsing and disappointing recipe i have tried on this website.  if you are going to make these, use only a fraction of worcestershire, soy, and sesame oil that the recipe calls for.

We used the little salad shrimp instead of crab and minced it in the processor before blending all the ingredients together.  They turned out great!!  Next time we make them (oh yes, there will be many more next times for this recipe!) we are going to scale back the recipe first of all, because I ran out of wrappers with half the filling left, and use less sesame oil and worchestire sauce and add pepper and see how they turn out.  I also wonder how these would taste with a little wasabi worked in.... mmm lots of possibilities with this gem of a recipe!  I agree with the other reviewers in that you can't put too much filling or they will leak, but I found that when they start to leak they are ready to come out of the oil anyway.  Thanks so much! :)

I threw all my ingredients in the food processor to acheive a more even distribution of ingredients on this recipe. If I change anything next time, it'll be to add four times as much cream cheese (or rather, cut everything by 3/4 except the cream cheese) in order to acheieve a crab rangoon more like those in the restaurants I go to. Otherwise, it was quick, easy, and awesome!!! Thank you for posting this recipe.

I make my own crab rangoons all the time...we like a litle more stuffing in ours than the restaurants around here add.  I read the reviews and decided to change up the recipe just a little.  I omitted the w. sauce and reduced the sesame oil just a little.  We really liked the results.  Thanks for something different.

These are soooo addicitve.  They take a little time but are well worth it.  The flavors come together so well.  I doubled the recipe for these last time I made them and froze about half.  They freeze very well after frying.  When I'm craving for them I just pop them out of the freezer and into the oven or toaster oven.

Lots of reviews and lots of recipe tweeking; which I think points to a very tasty recipe, with many variations. I'm reviewing because many reviewers have suggested or speculated on doubling the cream cheese; so with that I tried the recipe with half the remaining igredients and I thought it was pretty bland and unexciting. I love cream cheese, but I think the point here is to highlight the sweetness and richness of the "crab"; so, ultimately: I did indeed use a cuisinart for a smooth textured filling, increased the crab to 16 oz., reduced the sesame oil to 1 tsp, reduced the worcestershire to 1.5 T. and added a pinch or two of salt and table sugar - the soy sauce I use is a really mild flavorful one from the asian market, so I'd go lighter on that too if you're using Kikkoman or the like. The results were light and rich, the 1 tsp. of filling standing up nicely in flavor to the wonton wrapper rather than having to increase the filling quantity and render them heavy. Pairs perfectly with a little sweet chili sauce.  I'm serving them for an upcoming appetizer/cocktail party and they will be a big hit I'm sure!

I followed this recipe to a t and it was alright. I think the soy and w sauce was too bold in it. I think next time I will cut out the w sauce and double the amount of cream cheese. I think with a few adjustment it will be a great recipe, thank you!

I gave this review four stars because I tried the recipe version and then tried my own version, and here is what I found:

In my opinion, the Worcestershire sauce and the soy sauce are a little overpowering in the original, and they do seem to make the consistency too runny. However, if you halve the soy and the Worcestershire, the end result is absolutely delicious. 

I changed nothing else in the recipe. This one deserves a great rating!

Very yummy. Followed advice, used the 8 oz of cream cheese but then put in "4 servings" to adjust measurements and was PERFECT. Will make again! Thank you!

I am not sure what I did wrong, but it was not as tasty as other people stated it was. I like the restruant ones much better. Not going to make this again, but it was fun rolling the wontons. : )

I made this without the crab and used avocado.  I also made a desert batch: I mixed some vanilla, cinnamon and brown sugar in the cream cheese, diced up strawberries and put in a few chocolate chips.  After frying I sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon on top- oh baby!!!

This is almost how I make mine, but I don't use the W. Sauce, and I add water chestnuts. Also, I just use water to seal the edges instead of egg whites. This is really yummy.

I made a half batch and they turned out good.  I think it could have used less soy and worchestershire sauce but my family loved them per the recipe.  Also when folding the wonton, bring two opposite corners together and then the other two together (sealing with water), making little baskets.  They turned out okay that way.

I didn't add the crab but just did cheese wontons. I used the recipe for wonton wrappers and sealed them with egg whites. They were fabulous! Cooked up great.

I love Crab Rangoon when we go out for Chinese so decided to give this a try. Reading the reviews, I was careful with the Worcestershire and soy sauces, only adding a tsp of soy and 2 tsp of Worcestershire. Since my husband isn't fond of the strong flavor of sesame oil, I only used 1 tsp of that. A full "bunch" of green onions is far too much, two or three onions is plenty. My filling wasn't too wet and I had no explosions. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it is so much work to make.

Based on some of the reviews that the filling was sloppy, I decreased the soy sauce, sesame oil and worcestershire sauce in half.  The filling was VERY easy to work with and the wontons stayed together. I didn't have any explode in the deep fryer.  My family LOVED these.  I'll for sure make them again.

I like this recipe. I cut the Worcestershire, soy, and sesame sauce in half. I like the idea of scallion in this recipe. I changed it up with pastry dough vs. wonton wrapper, and I used cans crab mixed with imitation crab meat and imitation lobster meat. Baked at 350 degree.

They were very good, but they had a little too much soy sauce for my taste. Will definitely try them again with a little modification!

Thanks for a great recipe! I made it for a cocktail party as a DIP served with crackers instead of Wontons everyone raved about it. I was asked to make it again for upcoming Christmas gatherings! The only thing I changed was I used Real crabmeat instead of imitation!

Awesome recipe, much better than my favorite Chinese restaurant!  And, the filling is a great start to a wonderful crab dip!  My only issue was finding the wonton wrappers at my store, they are in the produce section near the organic and pre-chopped veggies for those of you with the same problem!

What a waste of very good ingredients!! Very bad results. I followed the recipe exactly, but the filling was to runny,and the flavor of the soy sauce overpowered the flavor of the cheese and crab. I closed the wonton very well but because the filling was to runny the wontons broke in the oil. The kitchen was a total mess!! oil and filling all over. Will NEVER make again!. Next time I will try the Local Kine wonton.

At first, these were great. After a few more times, I came to dislike the color of the filling that turned dark from the soy sauce and worchestershire. I appreciated the sesame oil flavoring, but at the end of day, I long for the pure flavors of cream cheese and crab.

It is good, but not my style, I think I will omit the soy and Worcestershire sauces or very little, can't taste the crab.  Good though this way too, just not the flavor I was craving

A minus one star would suffice. Seriously, I didn't even add a full tablespoon on Worcestershire sauce and the taste was awful. Next time I will definitely omit that. They would have been so much better without it.

Salty.  I followed the recipe on the first batch I made, it came out tasting salty.  I adjusted the second batch by excluding the Worcestershire and soy sauce and it came out a little better, just tastes like cream cheese

Overall this was okay, not too good.  To make it taste better I would use about 1/4-1/2 the imitation crabmeat and twice the cream cheese.  Also, I would cut up the crabmeat into fine pieces.  Also, I would not use the Worcestershire sauce.  With these changes I think they would be great!

I did not enjoy the taste of these wontons. I was looking more for that sweet cream cheese taste.  I think the worchestire and soy sauce were too strong.  The recipe made too much mixture.  I would not do this recipe again.

I use more cream cheese, add paprika and seal the wontons with water instead of egg whites.  These are so great and really easy to make!  Everyone always comes back for more, and they're even great cold the next day.

this was an expensive mistake!  it was runny and nasty.  Gloppy.  It either needed double the cream cheese or cut WAY down on the other liquid ingredients.  It wasn't even recognizable.  Yuck.

THERE WERE TOO MANY SAUCES IN THE FILLING.  THEY WERE NOT NECESSARY AT ALL!  I AM GOING TO TRY THESE AGAIN, BUT ONLY ADD THE: CREAM CHEESE, GARLIC, & GREEN ONION (I'D KEEP THE CRAB, BUT I DON'T EAT SEAFOOD.)  BY DOING THIS I HOPE TO RETAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE CREAM CHEESE FLAVOR.  ALL OF THE EXTRA SAUCES ARE JUST TOO OVERPOWERING.  MY HUSBAND THOUGHT THE WON TONS TASTED LIKE THEY WERE STUFFED WITH FRENCH ONION DIP.  HOPEFULLY WITH THE REVISIONS THEY WILL BE GREAT NEXT TIME AROUND.

I have been making these for over 2 years, this recipe and others. Ive found that cream cheese ( my opinon) goes with just about any fish.  Ive tried so far crab,clam,smoked salmon, tuna ( not from a can ), tonight I made it much blander for my husband because he has a ucler and it was still good.
little paprika, green onion, little garlic salt and some clams. I added more for mine but they were both good!

I didn't care too much for these, they didn't taste like the ones from the restaurant we love...  I don't know if it was the Worcestershire or the soy sauce or what but we probably won't make them again.

Yum! Didn't have crab meat but I'm sure it would be great with it! Skipped the worchestershire like other reviewers, also added about 1.5 t fresh minced ginger. Served w/sweet & sour sauce - was terrific! Will make again.

These were very tasty, but some of them burst when I fried them.  I had some leftover filling which made a very good dip on crackers.

I was so excited to try this recipe but was disappointed.  It was probably due to my error though.  Kept losing the inside of the wontons while cooking, I think due to my oil being to hot.  But with an old electric stove the temp was hard to control.  The taste was okay.  I think I was expecting something a little sweeter?  Anyway, despite my disappointment, the hubby and kids (5 and under) absolutely INHALED them!  Hence the four stars. Served with the Oriental Dipping Sauce from this site.

The first time I made it was perfect but I just replaced some ingredients...  but for it to be tasty and crispy, make sure u use THIN WONTON WRAPPERS. It worked perfectly when I did mine. Also, for some people complained about wonton openning while frying... DON'T PUT TOO MUCH FILLING AND USE VERY, VERY LITTLE EGG WASH to seal. Also, cook it in a medium high temperature. Medium and High just makes the wonton too dark or too oily. Also, use real crab (crab in a can works fine) for SPECIAL PEOPLE, and for parties use imitation crab meat. Just have a good sauce like the sweet chilli you buy from the asian market.

These just didn't live up to my expectations. Maybe I did something wrong. Others who tried them say they need a dipping sauce. I might try again.

Very Good!  I did not have any trouble with the wontons staying together.  Make sure to brush the egg white on all four sides this will keep them together.  I will use less seaseme oil next time.

I prefer a recipe which focuses more on the cream cheese and crab flavor. This had way too much worchestershire sauce. I am not sure if I made a  mistake with the recipe, but the filling was too wet. And for inexperienced wonton makers who often have filling escaping the wrap, it led to a lot of spitting oil.

The mixture tasted yummy when I was mixing the filling, but when I went to fry them, they got air pocket in them, popped and all the filling drained out (making it a deep-fried disaster).  I lowered heat and I went over the edges again to make sure they were sealed properly.  A wasted night and money.

I enjoyed this recipe although, I believe the measurement for garlic was a little toooo much! I had to add more cream cheese to beat the garlic out.

Love it! Don't change a thing. This recipe made me famous and goes great with sweet and sour or sweet chili sauce. People have literally sworn I was going to be a star or genius when I grow up (I'm 13) after trying these. Great for crowds and easy to make with kids ,like me, or on your own. One thing lower the oils temp to 350 so the wontons brown not burn.

More like a rangoon instead of a cheese wonton, but delicious all the same. If you are looking for a cheese wonton definitely add more cream cheese.

I liked the flavors but I was expecting something that tasted more like what I've had in a restaurant. The soy sauce and Worcestershire overwhelmed the light flavor of the crab, I think.

These are amazing! We did double the amount of cream cheese, half the amount of sesame oil and totally omit the Worcestershire sauce but they turned out delicious. However, because of the increase in cream cheese, we think we have doubled the total yield of wontons, but that just means more later. Would definitely recommend! Would rate as a 5 after modifications.

A little bland but I liked them! I would not add more cream cheese or else it's just too cream cheesy. I did however add some red pepper jelly to the second batch and that was nice as it goes great with the cream cheese.

Very tasty!  Note how many it makes - it's enough for a large party.  

Be sure not to over-stuff each wonton, or you'll have trouble closing them up.

Also, be sure to seal the wonton edges completely, but don't pack them tightly - a bad seal will leak, and a too-tight wonton will burst when fried -  putting the filling into your oil and making quite a mess!

All in all, a great recipe!

These were pretty delicious!  I added more cream cheese by suggestion on former reviews.  I also used lowfat cream cheese and added pineapple tidbits inside as opposed to crab. I did not deep fry, but put a little oil in a pan and just crisped them.  They turned out pretty good!  Will do again!

Once you get the hang of assembling these before frying, they turn out really well.  There was extra cream cheese so maybe next time I'll buy two packages of wrappers.

Needs to be scaled down for smaller dinner party apps, due to left over filling. If making for a crowd purchase extra wrappers because you will need them.  I used imitation crab as suggested and the flavor of the wontons was very tasty! Thanks for the recipe.

I'M SORRY, BUT THESE WERE NOT GOOD AT ALL.  AFTER READING REVIEWS, I CUT THE SOY, WORCHESTIRE, AND SESAME OIL IN HALF AND THEY STILL OVERPOWERED THE CREAM CHEESE AND CRAB. SORRY.

My husband and I thought that there was too much soy, sesame, onion, and worcestershire sauce. It was a little over-powering for us. We ended up adding 4 blocks of cream cheese to try and dilute the mixture. They were still horrible. I will not make these again!

Oh my goodness these were so tasty! I would DEFINATLEY reduce the sesame oil & worchestershire sauce though. I only added 1/2 tsp. worchestershire sauce & 1/2 tsp. sesame oil & it was perfect! I made a batch with just the cream cheese mixture & then the other half I added imitation crab meat to it & my hubby loved it! I served the Wontons with fried rice & it complimented it nicely!

Of all the crab rangoons recipes I tried so far, this was the best of all 4.  I was always looking for the missing ingredient in my previous batches and I think it could be the sesame seed oil.  Not sure but I will make this again.  My husband likes it too.  I only used two tbsp of worcestershire based on other reviews and that worked fine.

these were great, everyone loved it.  it was super easy to make as well.  i didn't use as much crab meat and it makes the filling creamier and more like how they serve it at restaurants

I made appz and dinner for over 30 people for Chinese New Year. I have had these growing up in MN however my future in-laws and family, who are from Vietnam, had never heard of such a thing. WOW were they impressed!  Thank you so much for this recipe! I followed it to the T and would not change a thing! Ok... I'm off to make some more.

We didn't care for these much, think it was the Worcestershire, might try again without it.

My husband and I thought that there was too much soy, sesame, onion, and worcestershire sauce. It was a little over-powering for us. We ended up adding 4 blocks of cream cheese to try and dilute the mixture.

I made these as one of the appetizers for a dinner for my parents 25th anniversary.  I followed the recipe as it is other than using real crabmeat.    I didn't have any problem with the filling leaking as some other reviewers had mentioned, but I was careful to leave a thick sealed edge outside the filled area.  I served these with a sweet and sour dipping sauce and they were a hit!

I've made these before and they are good.  Try buying baby shrimp in a can and mince instead of crab.  Tastes good too and not as expensive if you buy real lumb crab meat.  Great with warm sweet and sour sauce to dip in.

My husband made these.  He did tweak the recipe a little (he always does) and they were great, though they lost some filling during cooking.  The 4 star rating is probably due to his tweaking!  Good recipe.

I loved this recipe.  I just changed a few things up.  My husband and I don't like onions, so we left them out, and we used real crab meat.  We also added a little more soy sauce.  It was great, and pretty easy.  (Once you get the method of wrapping the wontons down.)

This recipe was delicious. I didn't have any crab so I used shrimp instead. Like others I did have a problem with the wontons breaking open and leaking out the mixture. This is the only reason that I rated this recipe 4 stars. For taste it's a 5 star recipe.

these were yummier than those at a chinese resturant! I found the wontons easily enough at pick n save in the produce department. one comment though... make sure you seal the wontons, otherwise they will explode and you will lose all of your filling!

First of all I love these things I always order them at my local chinese place but it was SO HARD to find the wonton wrappers....i couldn't find them but i found a recipe online to make them...the recipe for the mix is very good but with the wontons i made it was aweful.  VERY messy, and didn't taste that great.  Not to mention it stunk up and smoked up my kitchen.  I don't recommend it unless you can find wonton wrappers...maybe that will make it taste better
