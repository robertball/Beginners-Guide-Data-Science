This is a very delicious cookie. Easy to make & was a big hit with everyone. I used the lemon flavoring and after baking I dusted the tops of the cookies with powdered sugar. The powdered sugar added a nice touch.

Light Dreams, the only thing I liked about this recipe was the time efficiency, otherwise very bland and boring.

This is amazing. I highly recommend it. I used lemon extract and it turned out great. The one thing is that you should not melt butter and let it cool, but instead just let it warm a little to room temperature. Don't overmix!!!

You will create the best cookie!

Best cookie recipe yet!! I subbed the butter for margarine and it worked great. So light and it does feel like eating a dream! 10/10 would recommend.
