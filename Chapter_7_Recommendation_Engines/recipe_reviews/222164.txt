Yowza! This was spicy and salty!!! Oddly enough, I sat down to write this review and the first one I see says, "Needed more chili powder and salt for our taste." I guess it's all a matter of perception, but this isn't the mix I'll be using in the future.

I used this as a replacement for my "lack-of" in my pantry.  It serves well as a replacement.  I prefer my brand with the chunks.  I used dried minced onion instead of powder.  I added some spice with 1/2tsp cayenne pepper.  Thanks!

I was making a casserole that called for taco seasoning and realized I had none in the house, so I came to Allrecipes to see what I could find. This was the easiest one and I had all the ingredients on hand, so I made it. I tasted it before adding it to my dish and it seemed to taste exactly like what comes in those packets. I won't be buying the pre-made stuff anymore!

Very simple to make, as I keep all those ingredients on hand to begin with. Could maybe use a wee bit of cayenne or something like that to give it some "kick". Otherwise, the combination tastes great - I will use this as a base, and play with the heat level.

This really has a nice flavor.  I added a 1/2 tsp of cornstarch and some water to try and thicken a bit like the packets.  That would have to be played with a bit but I like the flavor.

Didn't have onion power, so I used minced onion (1 TB) instead. Worked like a charm!

For reference I use 1/4 cup of this seasoning mix and 3/4 cup water per 1Lbs of meat. This recipe is an awesome base for tweaking to your own tastes, for us it has just a bit to much sugar and salt and lacks a touch of heat so I adjusted the salt to a 1/4 Tbs and the sugar to 1/2 Tbs,  and added 1/2 Tbs of red pepper flakes and it's almost perfect,  we also use dried onion instead of powdered onion in the same amount.  I dislike when people leave an extremely poor ratings without explaining how they could have made it better or what is wrong, these people lack the imagination to make a recipe truly work! It's all about having fun and trying new things.

As advertised, quick and easy.  Didn't think it was that spicy and probably could use some red pepper flakes--everyone has an opinion about spice that is personalized, so adjust to your taste.  I am still not sure about the sugar component--not sure what it adds.  I'd prefer to leave it out next time.  It's relatively flavorful and works in a pinch, plus it makes enough to store.  I like to keep empty spice jars and re-use them for things like this, and it was enough to go in my recipe that I needed, and to almost fill a 2.62 oz McCormick spice jar.  Thanks for the recipe!

Nice flavor.  Probably could use a little more chili powder for more of a 'taco' taste.

I am so happy you posted this recipe. I never realized those were the ingredients that went into those taco seasoning packets> Lol. You would think I know since Im Mexican-American. I love that it's easy and quick to make!! Thank so much and I will be making enough to use with my Mexican cooking. :-)

This was okay.  Needed more chili powder and salt for our taste.  It was very easy to make though.  Thanks for posting the recipe

This is a good base, and I will definitely use it up; however, it's not one I'll be making again. I used this for a taco dip and for smoked sausage tacos. It worked fine in both recipes, but I think it was lacking a little in flavor. I prefer minced onion in my taco seasoning instead of powder, and it needed a pinch of cayenne pepper for our tastes. I also think it has a bit too much sugar. And if you're wanting to use it with any ground meat, it needs some flour or cornstarch.

I have this same recipe from another site and it calls for one TEASPOON of everything but the chili powder (still 1Tbsp) and salt (still 1/2 tsp.). As written, this recipe would yield 1/2 cup of mix (8 Tbsp); far more than the equivalent of a commercial taco seasoning packet that the recipe stated it would yield. That, along with the fact that 2 Tbsp of onion powder is way too much given the amt of chili powder called for, leads me to believe that we have a typo here. Chili powder is always the main ingredient in any homemade taco seasoning, not onion powder as this recipe suggests. I think  the author meant to state teaspoon rather than tablespoon in all the ingredients except for the chili powder and salt. I made this corrected version and it was perfect.

This is my go to taco seasoning now. I made it without salt and sugar just because I don’t care much for salt and only had stevia on hand. Was fine without the sugar. However one batch goes for at least two batches of tacos. I add it right to the meat during browning (no liquid like some packets require).

I love this mix. First time I made my own taco seasoning,  and I will not be using store bought versions any more. Very tasty, and not spicy at all, even little kids had no complaints. The second time I made it, I added just a hint of spice with 3/4 teaspoon of cayenne...still a hit.

I had every single one of these ingredients in my cabinet. This was great, a lot better than the prepackaged mixes. Making your own also allows you to add more or less of an ingredient if prefer certain seasons to be dominant.

I will stick to buying the mix from the store before I try this one again.  I appreciate the effort, but this is definitely not one of my favorites.  I followed the recipe to a t, but it was bland, so I tried to spruce it up with some parsley flakes, and it did help, but not my idea of what a taco should taste like.  Also, the instructions doesn't let you know to add water, so I drained my meat and added the seasoning.  I went ahead and added a little water, but was afraid to add too much because I didn't want it to be runny. Very disappointed.

I like having the option to make seasoning packs myself as i already have all this on hand. This is good. Made per the recipe.  However, seems like too much sugar and needed more hot stuff. Next time, I'm going to try a teaspoon of sugar and 1-1/2 tablespoons each of chili powder and cumin.
