While this worked surprisingly well, I feel like there is a flavor boost missing and I can't quite decide what it may be.  I added finely sliced red onion, but it still needs something.  This is a good base and I will keep fooling with it.  Thanks, Pugmama.

I'd swap out the evaporated milk with a little Miracle Whip or mayo mixed with more sour cream and a lot of dill.

No evaporated milk in the house. Used 1 part condensed, 3 parts 2%. Added onions. I could eat the whole bowl myself!!

Not a bad basic receipt, I added one cup plain yogurt and dill to taste about one half teaspoon for my liking. It will be saucy, to aide in the cucumbers sweating slice with then sprinkle with salt and let rest while making sauce.

Not bad, I added some dill. I only had two large cucumbers so I used less condensed milk. The kids thought it tasted like european cucumber salad. Easy to make.
