DEE-licious!  Admittedly salmon doesn't need a lot of help to taste wonderful, but marinating it in a bloody mary mix is brilliant idea. Being someone who likes my Bloody Marys spicy, I made sure to add a generous  amount of horseradish to a store-bought mix before pouring it over the filets. We served it with rice pilaf and a nice buttery Chardonay. Unfortunately, we had no fresh greens in the house but I'm sure asparagus with go great with it. Only suggestion, we marinated the fish for almost an hour and it wasn't really enough time to allow the spicy flavor to permeate the salmon -- I would recommend a much longer marinating period, maybe over night.

Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe, very simple. I'm always looking for a new salmon method. When I tried this one, I used an "extra spicy" bloody mary mix and very thinly cut some shallots to single layer on top of the filets while I baked them. Came out superb. Definitely marinate these for as long as humanly possible -- mine were done for about 10 hours, and I could see letting them go for double that time in the future.

This was so good. I let the salmon marinate for 24 hours. This was an easy, and it gets lots of praise from everyone.

Good - and different. I used the Bloody Mary Deluxe (minus the vodka) recipe from this site as the marinade for my salmon. I basted it again when the fish was done and served it with Bloody Mary-ish veggies. Thanks!

AMAZING!  We loved this so much, even the kids did. It is very quick and envolves very little work.
***We have made this several times now, the spicy bloody mary mix is necessary in order to live up to the expectations of the recipe! It continues to be wonderful!

I did not like this recipe at all - - and no one was more surprised than me.  I love the spiciness of bloody marys and horseradish.  But this marinade made my salmon very fishy tasting.  I even added lemon and extra horseradish but it didn't help.  Sorry.

I loved this recipe.  I did add the juice of one lime, sliced ginger,worshestire sauce, crushed garlic and 2T of sugar to the marinade.  It was great.  I also marinated the fish all day. Kids gave it thumbs up!

We had this for dinner last night. I took the salmon out of the freezer in the morning, placed it in a large ziplock bag, added the mary mix, and left it out on the kitchen counter all day to marinate and thaw out. Worked just fine. Wife said it is a keeper.

I improvised a little by using dry bloody Mary seasoning.  I mixed it with tomato juice and marinated the salmon for a couple of hours.  Prior to broiling, I sprinkled the salmon with additional seasoning to ensure that it was good and spicy.  For the first time, I actually enjoyed eating salmon.

I let this marinate for quite a while, I think next time I prepare it, I am going to had some lime juice to the recipe.  I definitely recommend that you broil it, not bake it.

This was simply amazing!  I marinated the salmon in the Bloody Mary mix for at least 8 hours.  I cooked it exactly like it said.  I served it for a dinner party of 6 and everyone was shocked at how moist and YUMMY it was!!!  They all gave it a 5 stars.  I used Zing Zang Bloody Mary mix.  No additional spices needed!!!

Based on the reviews, I marinated the salmon for seven hours vs. 30 minutes. I will not do that again. Although the salmon was very tasty, the citric acid changed the texture of the salmon and made it quite mushy--almost like a ceviche. I will try it again, but this time I will stick to the recipe.

Very easy recipe.  The Bloody Mary marinade suited the salmon nicely.  However, I did agree with a previous reviewer that there almost wasn't enough Bloody Mary taste.  I marinated overnight, so I'm pretty sure that wasn't the problem.  I'll make these again, and maybe spoon a little more mixture on top before broiling.

As someone else said "Salmon doesn't need any help". This recipe is fabulous. I let it marinate over night, using Extra Spicey Bloody Mary Mix.
Will add horseradish next time. Served with baked potato, a nice green salad and White Zinfendel. Thank you for the recipe this is definately a keeper.

I love this!  I have found that it really needs to marinate at least night to absorb the flavor.  In my variation I use the extra spicy bloody mary mix, and add black pepper and a tablespoon of lemon juice.  I serve it over white rice to absorb the extra sauce and also add cooked celery.

For as simple as this recipe is to make, it's surprisingly delicious! I marinated the salmon in the mix for about 2 1/2 hours and I found it to be very tasty. 
I broiled it differently however because the last time I broiled fish it came out perfect so I broiled skin side up for 2 minutes, remove from oven and peel skin off then broil again for 2 minutes, remove from oven, flip over fish, and broil for 5 minutes. The fish I bought was really thick so I ended up broiling for 2 minutes extra. 
Great recipe, I'll definitely be making it again!

This recipe was good, but I have to admit I expected a little more flavor. I will make it again, but perhaps marinate it overnight first!

This didn't live up to our expectations.  We didn't taste any of zippy tastiness of the bloody mary mix (and I used extra spicy with a squirt of lime) -- instead it tasted like salmon in tomato sauce.  I WAS pleased with how quickly it broiled, and that the salmon didn't taste fishy.

I was pleasantly suprised. Used extra spicy bloody mary mix and added spicy green beans on top (the kind you usually add to a bloody mary). Delicious. I will make this again.

Yummy!  I let it marinate in the Bloody Mary mix for a little longer and I use the spicy Bloody Mary mix.
