I used my Kitchen Aid from beginning to end with this bread. I proofed the yeast in my mixer bowl with the warm water and sugar for ten minutes, then added the oil and last, the dry ingredients. The dough seemed a bit dry, but kneaded up nicely. I set it to rise on my warm oven in a large, greased bowl covered with saran wrap for an hour. After, I formed it into a loaf and set it in a loaf pan and covered it again with saran wrap and let it rise again. This made one monster loaf. Very flavorful. Most wonderful.  One of the most tender loaves I've eaten. And the smell while baking was insane. I served this with Slow Cooker Creamy Potato Soup. Nice combination. I'll make this again for sure.

I'm not sure what the cheddar cheese' contribution is to the bread because you can't really see it and you can't taste it, but it must do something (I would hope with 1-1/4 cups of it!) because this bread is good! Maybe it's the 3 T. of olive oil...or maybe the potato flakes.  Or maybe it's that every ingredient contributes its part to come up with this wonderful, almost rustic loaf.  I reduced the sugar to 1-1/2 tsp. as I like no sweetness in my bread, and used fresh rosemary rather than dried.  I like the "crustiness" that the extra rising and baking time the French Bread cycle provides so used that rather than the basic setting.  Nice crumb, not too yeasty or soft, with a subtle rosemary flavor.

I liked this bread, but I only gave it four stars because of the changes I made to improve it.  These are the changes that I made: 1) Use two cups whole wheat flour and one cup white 2) Make dough in machine, but do one final rise out of machine and bake in oven. 3) Skip the cheese (it adds nothing except lots of extra calories and fat) 4) A little extra rosemary and a pinch of oregano. A good basic recipe, but changes required.

Great bread but couldn't give it 5 stars due to a few changes I made. I used the dough setting on my bread maker but opted to bake it instead (350 for about 30 minutes). Along with the rosemary, I added about a tablespoon of garlic powder, also eyeballing a  little milk when I noticed the dough seemed dry while it was mixing. In addition, I also added shredded mozerella cheese along with the cheddar cheese. Turned out very yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great flavor for bread, but we had trouble with the measurements in our breadmaker. We measured everything according to the recipe and the dough was very dry. We had to add 5 tablespoons of water to achieve the right consistency dough to pick up all of the flour. We thought it was fine and it rose beautifully but fell 15 minutes before the baking was done. Next time we'll add the rosemary and cheese to a traditional bread machine recipe.

this is so good. I don't have a bread machine so did this by hand.  Just mixed the dry ingredients together in 1 bowl while proofing the yeast in water, added  to the dry w/the oil. Kneaded it a bit then worked in the cheese a half cup at a time. this takes a bit longer to knead by hand, dough will be heavy. needed 1 1/2 hours proofing in a warm oven. about 40 min. second rise. baked @400 degrees for approx. 23 minutes.  perfect amt. of rosemary and not too sweet but just sweetened nicely. very moist dense bread that would be perfect w/pork or lamb main course.  used 4 cheese potato flakes; it is what I had on hand. thanks for this recipe!

Nice texture.  I used fresh rosemary instead and was concerned it might be too strong but it was balanced.  It didn't rise as much as the bread machine usually does and the top crust was uneven.  I'll have to play with it to see what caused this.

Everyone in the family loved this bread.  I would cut the sugar back to just a Tbsp to proof the yeast.  I also rolled the dough out and sprinkled the chesse and rolled it up for a "swirl" bread.  Excellent!

The bread was good but the smell in the house as it was baking and as you bring it to your mouth to take a bite is awsome!!  I used the sweet setting on the breadmaker because of the sugar and the cheese, a medium crust (but would use light next time) and a 1.5 size loaf setting.  Definately happy since it was only my second loaf of bread in the a bread machine!!!

I enjoyed the taste of the bread and the aroma while it was baking; however, I gave it only three stars as written because the one cup of water was not enough to form a dough ball, much less pick up all of the flour.  I added about 6 tablespoons of extra water - one Tbsp at a time.  (I had to manually incorporate the water into the dough in the bread pan.)  Like another baker reported, the loaf appeared to be fine after adding the extra water; however, about 20 min before the end of the baking time, it fell in...about an inch or so.  I would suggest reading ALL of the comments about this recipe before attempting it or else sticking around to "babysit" your loaf to make the needed adjustments as the machine's cycles progress.  I would not suggest just hitting the start button and then going out to work in the yard or taking a nap!
