I have read all the reviews. I made these tonight. They were wonderful. I add a few caveats- 1) Don't be in a hurry. The potatoes need time to cook. 2) Add the onions about 7 minutes after the potatoes so they don't cook down to nothing. 3) I had to add some liquids to get all the good browned bits off the bottom during the potato cooking time- first time I added about 1/3 c of the chardonnay I was drinking. 2nd time I added about 1/3 c of chicken broth/stock from a can. This allowed the potatoes to steam a little- I left the cover off the potatoes the whole time. 4) I didn't use 3 slices of bacon. I used maybe 1 1/5 slices and browned them first in the skillet. I took the crispy pieces out and processed them in a small food processor. I mopped up 3/4 of the grease w/ a paper towel, but left a little for flavor and 5) I only used about 1 1/2 T of butter. I also added salt and fresh ground pepper. I suppose the wine and the chicken broth made up for the lack of butter, but I felt better about it being a little lower in fat content. I used 5 oz of bleu cheese. They were WONDERFUL. We ate them with filet mignon on the grill and sweet peas. Delicious- you just have to take your time for the best results. You won't be disappointed.

Delicious - the 2 potatoes only served the "2" of us!!!  I microwaved the potatoes for 5 minutes, then peeled and sliced them.  The potatoes then did cook through in 15 minutes. (If you microwave the potatoes first you can slice them and the onions and prepare it earlier in the day.)

I made these last night and served them with a grilled flank steak, my family LOVED them. My husband (your typical baked potatoe with sour cream guy) told me I needed to make them everytime we have steak. They were SO easy to make and had a very nice flavor, I didn't have enough blue cheese crumbles, but I think we still got a good bit of flavor with what I had, about 1/2 of what was called for.

We loved it.  I did have to put about 1/2 cup water in with potatoes to really get them cooking and somewhat softer.  Just kept stirring then.  came out just delicious and savory.  We had it with steak.  Will make again for sure... and I'm not even a bleu cheese lover! :-)

Wow...was this ever tasty!  It was the perfect side-dish compliment to my Buffalo chicken meatloaf!  I used a few more potatoes because the one's I had were small and I used turkey bacon, I even threw in some sauteed mushrooms because we love them so much!  It was good reheated the next day as well.

WOW!! What a great recipe.  I would not change a thing.  If you love blue cheese you'll love this recipe!  I had to fry my potatoes a little longer than 20 min but you'll know when the potatoes are done and as soon as you add the blue chesse your mouth will be watering!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!!!!!

This was so good, it was almost too good.  It was delicious and easy.  Next time I'll try olive oil instead of butter, leave out the bacon, and reduce the amount of cheese....because it's so rich.  It's great if you're not watching calories, or if you just decide to treat yourself!!

As a general rule, fried potatoes just aren't my thing, but I LOVE blue cheese, so this caught my eye.  I'm so glad I decided to give this a whirl, because it was wonderful!  So simple, yet so flavorful.  I cheated and use "real" bacon bits to make it even easier and these were ready in all of 20 minutes, including prep.  THANKS, leslie, for a sure to become staple side at the LTH house!

I doubled the butter...but otherwise, these were amazing.  I had a few leftovers and am looking forward to eating those for breakfast.  I would definitely recommend this recipe!

Tasty. Instead of butter I used bacon grease (I save it from every time I make bacon), skipped the bacon, about 3/4 cup blue cheese crumbles and a little red wine (port) for de-glazing the pan. I recommend microwaving the potatoes a bit to soften/slightly cook them before finishing them off in the pan- otherwise when adding the onions they will cook down to nothing. Paired well with "Simply Divine Meat Loaf with Spinach: from AR.

I fixed this with a steak and peas and we really enjoyed it. I used red potatoes because that's what I had on hand. I added a little water to the potatoes and onions and covered the skillet and let the potatoes steam. We will definitely make this again.

I made this as a side dish with brats and it was great.  My husband and I love blue cheese, bacon, and potatoes so this recipe was a natural for us.  The blue cheese adds a little bite without being overwhelming.  I suggest that if you really like more blue cheese flavor use more cheese or a stronger variety of blue cheese.  I will definitely be making this again.

This is a good side dish.  The cooking time of the potatoes took a bit longer than stated but the flavors were great.  Next time I will do them in tin foil on the grill.

Three stars with my making it.  Five stars, if anyone else does.  Four, here.  I have the magic touch with some things, but not potatoes in a skillet.  Mine too 40 minutes & still were a bit firm.  I liked 'em though; just got tired of cooking them.  I bet this would work better for me using leftover baked taters.

Added a little more water for the potatoes but overall. AWESOME. We had them with steak and oven roasted asparagus. I will make them again.

These potatoes are wonderful if you really like blue cheese! I used three potatoes instead of two because mine were rather on the small side, but other than that I kept the recipe exactly the same. They did take a while to cook, but that is just the way potatoes are, well worth the wait for these. The onion really sweetened up as it cooked and the potatoes tasted well seasoned from cooking with the butter. Although I did think the blue cheese was a little overpowering (and my husband thought so too), it still tasted great! If you're not such a big fan of blue cheese you could always decrease the amount even up to a half and I think you would still get the great taste without it being too much. I will be making these again since we liked them so much and it is a very easy recipe, even with the wait time for the potatoes to cook. Thanks for the recipe, Leslie!

Really good. This is an excellent dish. I precooked the potatoes in the microwave. I separated the dish before adding the cheese - blue cheese for some, cheddar for the family members who don't appreciate blue cheese. The cheddar version would be great with a dollop of sour cream.

Nope, it's not pretty, but it IS pretty good!  This was my second (and expected last) time trying this recipe; after all, I have another blue cheese potatoes recipe with rosemary that's A+++, but it's a bit more labor & time intensive, and I wasn't in the mood for the extra work.  So, dusted off the mandolin, took tip to add onions later in cooking, kept a bit of bacon grease in pan with butter, added S&P early in cooking, and once potatoes were done (@30 mins.), sprinkled bleu cheese over top with bacon, covered over min. heat to let cheese melt slowly, and YUMMMMMM!  One other big hint: I used my largest Le Creuset braiser which helped spead out pots & onions to cook better/faster.  Plan to tweak this a bit more the NEXT time I make it, but that'll just be for my taste -- not 'cause the recipe needs more tweaking beyond what I did last night.  It's a keeper!

Not a big hit at my house.  The onions cooked a lot faster than the potatoes and, although I like blue cheese, it was just overpowering.  It also made for a funky smell in the house lol.

These were awesome.  I agree with the person that said take your time because we love the potatoes nice and brown on the outside.  I also added some white wine and chicken stock while they were cooking to let them soak up some additional flavor while getting brown on the outside.  All in all I probably cooked them at medium for an hour, but we all raved about them during the entire meal and my husband I fought over who was going to get to the leftovers the next day.  Thanks!

LOVE these! Fabulous taste. The one reviewer is right about needing a lot of cook time though. They do take awhile, but worth the wait!

These were very tasty! I used some of the bacon grease to cook the potatoes and only a 1/2 tbls. butter. I also used a mix of shredded mozzarella and cheddar instead of blue cheese, just because my husband is allergic. I think it would have been even better with the blue cheese, though.

Absolutely loved this.  I used Gorganzola which is a somewhat milder blue cheese, and that works for my family.  It's so nice to find a new potato side dish!  Thanks!

A delicious recipe to use up leftover baked potatoes.  Because my potatoes were prebaked, my dish was ready in the stated time frame.  My DH is not a fan of bleu cheese, so I made a part of the pan with bleu cheese and the rest of the pan with feta cheese. That simple change could be made with any type of cheese.  I served these with 'Buffalo Chicken Sausage and Pepper Sandwich', another AR recipe.  We both enjoyed our dinner tonight.

Mmmmmm these were so good. The only thing I added was about two TBS of water to help steam the potatoes and didnt add the onion until the potatoes were halfway done. Yum! Perfect as steak pairings

I prefer to boil the potatoes for about 10 minutes first before adding them to the onions in the skillet.  I like to add a little chopped garlic too.  It's excellent without the bacon as well, so usually make it that way.

Wow!!!  Incredible!   Broke up the bacon in food processor.  Added some chicken broth to keep from sticking to pan.

Amazing!  Have made this 2x now.  The second time I microwaved the sliced potatoes for 3 min's before browning them --- just took too long last time and potatoes were still a bit crunchy.  Will for sure make this again!  Thinking about trying it w/ sweet potatoes and gorgonzola cheese for the next go around!  Great dish!!!!

These are amazing. My husband who is not a bleu cheese fan raved about them. I made them a second time and didn't have enough bleu cheese so I added 2 tbsp. of cream cheese and they were just as amazing! The crispier the potoates the better.

These were ok-we thought they were kind of bland. The kids didn't care for them at all. I don't think the addition of blue cheese & bacon really added anything to the potatoes & there DEFINATELY wasn't enough butter to fry them in-I ended up adding much more &  when that all soaked into the potatoes, I just added oil. I covered them(like I always do fried potatoes).

My husband thought this was a 4 or 5, but I just couldn't. I'll make again because I liked it, but will make changes. I'm going to either dice or shred the potatoes. It was to hard frying such thick slices. Also, the blue cheese was to overbearing for me. I'll use less & add some cheddar jack or monterey jack type cheese. My onions burnt putting them in right away with the thick sliced potatoes. Being so thick, the potatoes didn't cook through well either.(I used a large frying pan even) I think I'd probably add miced garlic & not cook the bacon as long so when it is added to potatoes it can finish browning. These were good, but for me needs tweeking if I'm to make again. If hubby cooks, he'll probably do as is.

Deeelish! I completely forgot to add the bacon, but it turned out just fine. Fab all around! Oh, and i did double to amount of potatoes, which made it more like four servings, since I was figuring no way on earth would 2 potatoes feed 4 people.

I don't know if I cooked these too quickly or what, but they came out mushy instead of crispy.  The flavor was good but the texture/consistency was awful.  We threw out the leftovers.  I think next time I would bake the potato slices until crispy and then saute the onions and toss with the potatoes and blue cheese just to blend.

Good except by the time the potatoes were cooked through the onions were burnt to a crisp! Had to take them all out before adding the cheese & bacon. Next time I would cook the onion first then remove and add back to the potato once cooked.

Add a dollop of sour cream at the table if you want to soften the strong taste of the blue cheese.

I didn't LOVE this dish. I tried, but I just wasn't moved by it. I microwaved the potatoes for 5 minutes before cooking, but they still took 30 minutes in the pan. Actually, they still weren't tender, but the steaks were ready. By that time, the onions were cooked down to nothing. You couldn't taste them at all. The blue cheese melted and disappeared. Quite disappointing since potatoes, onions, and blue cheese are my favorite foods.

WOW!  What a GREAT recipe! We paired this with "Savory Garlic Marinated Steaks" from this site.  The whole family gobbled them up.  I doubled everything in the recipe except I used 6 oz of blue cheese crumbles.  I also used 8 new (red) potatoes instead of baking potatoes.  It took about 30 minutes for the potatoes to cook.  A new favorite indeed!

Yumm, how can you go wrong? I do think that next time I will pass on the bacon though- it just does not need it. Perfect with our steaks and easy (as long as you have a mandolin). Thanks!

These potatoes were excellent! I fried them up while my husband grilled some burgers. I too waited 5-7 minutes before adding my onions and also used 5 oz bleu cheese. We enjoyed these a lot more than the regular potatoes and onions on the grill.

It was OK, but you really need to like blue cheese because the flavor is overwhelming. I smothered mine in ketchup. However my dad who is a big blue cheese fan LOVED this recipe.

Very good!  They do, however, take quite a bit longer than the time stated. I didn't add the bacon because I didn't have any, but may try that next time.

It's a very good and easy recipe, the blue cheese gives it a twist from the usual boring potatoes. It's true that the onion disappears quickly and you could add it later, but the taste is there anyway. The potatoes did take longer to cook than stated, and you're better to be certain they are thoroughly cooked; I didn't put the bacon, but it really is not necessary, and used olive oil instead of butter. The only drawback is they are not so "pretty" to serve, but my guests gobbled them up all the same

These were great. I did not use the bacon thou but the blue cheese you add when they are just about done and it melts into the potatoes and they taste gourmet.

This was really good...I made no changes other then a little extra time on the potatoes.  If it was good for us I'd make it again but I don't think we loved it enough to make it a regular.

very yummy. It tasted awesome, but didn't look outstanding.  Will make it again and really crisp the potatoes for our liking.

this was absolutely awesome! My husband ate almost all of it. Great change for a side dish, goes great with grilled steak. I will definately make again!
