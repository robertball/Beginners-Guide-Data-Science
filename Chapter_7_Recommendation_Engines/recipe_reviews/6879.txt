Abs fab! Light, oh! so light an egg bread! On the advices of several people, I used half the recipe. I also proofed the yeast and let the dough rise one extra time. Delicious! Feathery! A keeper!

Delicious recipe. I found it did not take as long to bake as the recipe suggests. Instead of 45 minutes it was done in 35. Also this bread was much larger than expected - It baked to be the width of my oven!

Yuck! After all the time I spent on this bread I was VERY disappointed on the outcome.  I followed the recipe exacally, but it didn't taste at all good.  My husband didn't care for it either, but my daughter ate it with LOTS of butter.   Definatly watch the cooking time-it does NOT take 40 mins. to bake.  Considering all the other reviews I coundn't wait to try this bread, but I will not be making this one again--not worth all that time at all.

This egg bread was very easy to make.  I cut the recipe in half because I wasn't sure if the bread was going to taste good or not...but it was good!  My mom thought I got it from a bakery!
The bread came out very big!  It makes me wonder how big the bread actually is, if I had followed the recipe without cutting it in half.

I made the dough in the bread machine, then shaped it and baked! I made french toast for Thanksgiving breakfast. The entire family loved it! It was gone before the end of the parade!

Fantastic. I also made this substituting 1/2 whole wheat flour and it was still tender and delicious. A must try!

I made this to go with spinach dip and everyone at work loved it.  i would recommend doubling the sugar, using just 6 eggs instead of the 3 eggs and 6 yolks, and baking for 20min tops.  This is a great recipe that I will be making often.

This turned out great! I had never made bread before, but it was really easy. My boyfriend thought I bought it at the store! Keep an eye on the baking time though, it only took 15 minutes to cook in my oven.

I'm giving this recipe five stars because its being posted resulted in the best bread I've ever baked.  I made the following changes though, per other reviewers' suggestions:

I added 1/4 cup of organic honey
I used six eggs total (not including the brush on egg) instead of de-yolking and whatnot.

I cut the cook time down to about 25 minutes, and I probably went five or so minutes too long.  

This bread is fabulous for spinach dip, and went miraculously with some butter and Russian Mushroom and Potato soup from this site.

Thank you so much for the recipe - the only future change I might make is to bake it in two loaves since it's so enormous!

Imade this recipe for one loaf again this week I added 2 TBS extra sugar with slight improvement in taste.  Used 2 1/2 cups flour instead of 2 1/4 as recommended.  Found consistency of bread much better.  This time bread rose to nearly 4".  If you cook for 40 minuetes as directed you will probably end up with charcoal at 375 degrees.  Found 25 -26 minutes adequate for one loaf.Note: there are inconsistencies in recommended amounts of eggs and flour in recipe.  This should be corrected.  Bread very good.

Egg breads are my favorite kinds of breads to make, which is why I found this recipe so irresistible. 

It's super easy to make because the dough is so workable and smooth. Just don't rush the rising times. 

I made this into rolls instead of loaves and they were good. Excellent with jam or cream cheese.

This is so delicious! I love it! One note I want to make is that if you try to make this into one loaf, it will probably be gi-normous. I have made this twice and have always halved the recipe (the loaf is still huge!), and a half-recipe will only need 20 minutes in the oven. ( One trick I learned from Alton Brown on an episode of "Good Eats!" is to let the dough rise in a (not turned on)oven  with a pan of hot water beneath it. Also, if you've ever had trouble getting the yeast to rise - like myself - make sure you stir the yeast in the sugar-water until it completely dissolves, then let it sit for a couple minutes 'til it gets really  foamy.

This is one great tasting egg bread, I made it last weekend,  my sister had come over just when I was pulling it out of the oven, and all she said was you made this, it looks like it came from a bakery.  The loaf is huge, next time i am going to split it in half and make 2 loaves.

This bread is delicious and tastes like a very rich challah bread. I made it today (day before Easter) and it was enough for 2 medium loaves. This is a very rich recipe, not at all for the dieter, but something to perk up up a holiday meal. The dough was very sticky so added flour at the mixing stage a little at a time. You may need to add more based on stickiness. It is very good tasting!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some eggs, and came across this one.  This bread came out wonderful and looks and tastes amazing!  If you are looking for a more dense challah or egg bread, don't try this recipe.  This recipe makes a very light and fluffy loaf.  And for those of you who don't like to eat challah plain, try it with whipped cream cheese, it is sooooo good!  Thanks for the recipe, it was a good way to use up extra eggs!

I've used this recipe many, many times for home use and for my small catering business.  It always works and it always is HUGE!!!  I have to cook it diagonally!! Lay foil over it gently at first so top doesn't brown too fast.  Truly a great recipe!!

Wow Kevin! Loved this version of Challah very much. Only change I made was subbing honey for the sugar. I made two loaves out of the dough; one of which I gave as part of a Christmas gift. So pretty and glossy! Thanks so much!

The texture is ok. But it's WAY too eggy for me. It was cooked in 20 min. I tripled the sugar and still it was just slightly sweet.   I don't think anything could overpower all those egg yolks. Bummer.

A very successful recipe! It works great for hamburger buns as well as cinnamon rolls (just add 2 tsp. more sugar) For the best results do not rush the raising times. Chaeya

The first time I made this recipe, I got rave reviews from my guests.  Just for kicks, I added 1/4 C of honey (to a double batch) the next time I made it, and now I am told it is the best challah ever.

This is a great recipe but don't be surprised
when you let your dough rise that it looks
quite small.When you let it rise the second
time,it double's in size,and one more thing,
it grows even more when you bake it.
It truly is a wonderful piece of art.
Go a head and try this one.This is a recipe that 
you can be proud to say you did it.

Just a quick point, it could be that people are having different results with this because of altitude. If this recipe came from Hawaii, it's most likely a higher altitude recipe.

I have made a lot of bread and many recipes, but this one is the best of all. Thanks for sharing it. One tip...divide the bread into at least 2 loaves. It is very large recipe.

This for sure makes 2 loaves.  I added a shot of Anisette to this.  It turned out great.  It is a light and fluffy bread.  I think you will be pleased with it.  Try it!

This is so delicious.  For the first attempt at an egg bread recipe...it was easy, fast and came out wonderfully delicious. I figured it would make a great gift and ended up making 3 loaves because my family and I couldnt help but eat the first ourselves......GREAT!!

As an egg bread, very nice. As a Hawaiian bread, not so much. IF you are making this as a Hawaiian bread, add more sugar. I'm thinking of increasing the 1/4 c. of sugar to at least 1 c. I made these as Hawaiian rolls and was able to get 15 nice size rolls in a 9 x 13 glass pan. They rose incredibly well and had a nice flavor, although not quite to the sweetness of Hawaiian. Mine were done after 22 minutes, so 40 minutes at 375 was quite long- a little warning just to check them at the half-way mark. With some tweaking, I think these would make an excellent Hawaiian roll to make sliders, morning egg sandwiches and more.

This bread turned out ok, I cooked it for 25min per others reviews, but I think that was still a little too long.  It came out really light and pretty but I feel like this bread is missing something.  Maybe more sugar or some honey like other reviewers suggested, or more salt like another reviewer mentioned.  Overall, I would try making this bread again but definetly with some adjustments.  We also found that it was very sticky kneading it at the beginning but by 7 minutes of kneading it gets a lot better.

Absolutely fabulous! This was the first time I have ever tried making bread. I read about "proofing" on this site so I did that and I did use my stand mixer with the dough hook.  I turned the oven on the lowest temp. then turned it off and let the dough rise in there with the oven door open.I couldn't believe how much the dough had risen the first time. A wonderful aroma will fill your kitchen when baking this bread. When it comes out of the oven all a lovely dark golden brown colour you will be amazed. "A work of art"

This bread is phenomenal, and the aroma while it's rising and baking was more wonderful than you could imagine.  And yes, it does bake up to be one enormous loaf, but for Thanksgiving, I'm going to make it into individual rolls.  I have the feeling they're going to be the hit of the gathering.  Try this recipe...you won't go wrong! :)

I made this for a scrapbooking party and just made 2 round loaves. After they were finished baking & cooled, I sliced 1/4 of the tops off and hollowed them out. Then I cut the insides into chuncks, filled the "bowl" with spinach dip, arranged bread chunks around the bowl and, "Viola!" It was a fantastic treat!  I also used this recipe to make "soup bowls" with cream of broccoli & cheese soup and everyone's plate was empty and I swear licked clean! (children too)

This recipe is outstanding.  The loaf came out very, very light (very close to king's Hawiian bread) and huge.  If you are  experimenting with this recipe, I suggest you half it.  My loaf, using the complete recipe, came out to be 5" high, 7" wide and the length of the cookie sheet.  Mind you, it is so light I didn't mind at all.  I did double the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I think I could have used even more.  I've searched and tried many challah recipes.  This is by far the best.  Definitely a keeper.

Used this recipe, and made dinner rolls instead of braiding it (baked at same temp for about 10 min). They were beautiful, light and fluffy and delicious. I served them at my brother's wedding reception and I got so many compliments!

This recipe itself has some issues.  First off, there is no way this needs to bake for 40 mins.  It probably was done after 20.  And it was lacking in the sweetness of Hawaiian bread that I was looking for.  Don't know if I would ever try this one again.

This bread turned out exactly as I had hoped. Giant, light, fluffly and golden.  I halved the recipe and still ended up with a normal challah sized loaf. To those who say this bread is bland... when was the last time you bought some bread and just ate it plain? very unusual I say. This bread is fantastic with just a little jam or honey, equally good dipped in soup or stew. Doesn't need anything at all. However, I think the addition of lemon zest, poppy seeds and some extra sugar might make it a stand alone bread.

Not enough sugar... this thing is HUGE. It was as wide as my half sheet pan when made as a braided round wreath... so 13 inches in diameter.     Baking time is too hot and too long. I did NOT preheat based on reviews warning about it. I put it in and started at 375 deg and after 20 min I started to worry, so I cranked it to 350 and went another 10 min for a total of 30 min baking.  Then I let it cool.  It was fine, but a little darker on top than I like.     Very good texture and airy though. Also a nice yellow color and easy dough to work with.     Next time I am going to try with 1/2 cup sugar, butter instead of oil, and 350 deg for 30 min or 325 for the 40 min.

Nice airy bread but to dry for our tastes. I will try this again and see if it improves. I will add a little more sugar, melted butter and not cook as long (I cooked 29 minutes and it was very crusty)maybe 20 minutes as I see others said. Wish I had read reviews first.

Absolutely deserves 5 stars!  I halved the recipe, added 2 Tbsps. honey for kicks, and sprinkled poppy seeds on top of the egg wash.  One added note about this bread - unlike almost every other homemade recipe out there, this one remained acceptably fresh and soft for three days in a large ziploc bag - that's very rare and valuable!

A fabulous recipe! I added a 1/4 cup honey but otherwise didn't alter the ingredients. I proofed the yeast with the sugar for about 10 min before adding  the rest of the ingredients. I made two loaves from the resulting dough rather than one and let them rise a bit longer than called for during the second rise. They made very normal-sized challah loaves. Beautiful and very delicious. They only needed 20- 25 minutes in the oven. I sprinkled them with kosher salt before baking and they looked great. I think they turned out perfect, and I have tried a wide variety of challah (or egg bread) recipes on this site. Thank you, I have a new go-to recipe for my challah!

Oh my goodness, Kevin... this is the softest and best braid I have ever made. Thank you for sharing the recipe. I made the dough in my bread machine and also took note of comments made by other reviewers. Firstly, I made 1/2 the quantity and baked only 20min (altho next time, I will make two and give away one since baking time is so short), doubled the quantity of sugar and substituted whole eggs for the egg yolks (ie. 6 egg yolks =3 eggs). Because I used whole eggs, I needed a bit more flour. I just added flour bit-by-bit and watched the dough form until I was satisfied with how it looked and felt. Still thought it could do with either a bit more salt or sugar - can't decide which one. Now this is how I've always wanted my braids to turn out but never succeeded. I can imagine this looking great if baked in a loaf tin too or with the addition of raisins.

This was easy and delicious!  The bread was great on its own, and even better as French toast the next morning.  I doubled the sugar because I like my egg bread sweet, and it was just right.  I halved the recipe and made one loaf.  A word of caution when making one loaf, I only cooked it for 30 minutes and I think it would have been better after 20-25 minutes.

I made the bread into two regular loaves and baked it.  When I put it into the oven, it was the regular sixe of bread, but when I took it out the loaves were HUGE. They looked like a couple of double decker buses.  But oh so yummy!!!  We did try french toast and it was delicious.  Will definently make this again.  I don't want to invest enough effort to braid it, but maybe three or four loaves would be better.

I had my high school cooking class prepare this bread. We cooked it a muffin tin in cloverleaf bun shapes and there was not a bad batch in 12 kitchen. Great easy and tasty recipe. If a hormonal 15 year old can make it, You know its easy :)

Wow! A positively delicious egg bread recipe. It is perfect. I followed it exactly, even though I am that person who will always change something, simply b/c I'd never made egg bread and wanted to get an idea of a basic recipe. This was so incredible! The only thing I did differently was that I made it into two basic loaves, rather than a braid. It makes two good sized loaves that are awesome for toast or sandwiches. Like other reviewers I cooked it for only about 30 minutes rather than 40 and it came out beautiful!

The bread was huge so you'll definitely want to cut this in half.  It looked great but, when we went to eat it, we found it be extremely dry.  Huge disappointment.

This bread turned out P E R F E C T !!! better than I'd hoped. Iv been trying different egg bread recipes for a while, and have enjoyed most of the outcomes... But this one... Oh my! It will be hard for me and my boys to not devour it all & wait for my husband to get home.. He's going to be thrilled! ( not to mention proud of me !!yay!! ) - I cut the recipe in half as iv read suggested, using 3 yolks & 2 whole eggs. Then just the left over whites as my wash. Bakes for about 15 minutes? Cooked verrry fast due to how light and fluffy and airy the consistency.. It would have burned had I put on the timer for the recommended time & left it. Be careful. By far, the BEST egg bread yet. Thanks for sharing! BLTs tonight! WOOP!!

I would give this a 5 star, if not for 2 corrections I had to make. Upon reading the reviews, I decided to make 2 loaves out of this recipe instead of one. Which I was very thankful for, because it made 2 14 inch long loaves. Crazy!
Secondly, I only had to cook it for 20 minutes instead of 45 and it was a dark, golden brown. 

Other than that, absolutely delicious. The people who said this is gross simply can't cook bread worth a hoot or don't know what 'egg' bread is. 
YUM! I'm putting this recipe away for later use!

This was pretty good. I am not very experienced in baking bread so i used the time measurements for the risings rather then sight and wound up with an enormous loaf of bread! I will make this again, the flavor is very good but i won;t let it rise quite so much!

This is the third time I've made this bread, it always turns out great! I use the full recipe, because I love how big this bread is. It's plain, so it goes well as an an accompaniment with other foods.

I did the same as others and halved the dough.  Made one nice loaf.  I had a little problem because I was short an egg, but I just used the whites from the 6 eggs I only needed yolks of and made do.  Very good bread but boy did it make a mess of my kitchen!  Super sticky and hard to manage during the kneading process.  Other than that, though, it was good.  My first time to make it.  Can't wait to put it in my French toast casserole for the morning!!!

This bread came out so good. I cut the recipe in half and came out with a huge loaf. I don't know what I would have done if i made the whole thing. (baked in 2 batches?) I did let it rise an extra time, but it was soooooo good. I will defenitly make again. I used this bread in the baked french toast recipe and it's in the oven now yum!

I made this bread yesterday just to give it a try. I was so pleasntly surprised. One of the members said it was bigger than expected. WOW was it. I think it tripled in size. Beautiful bread. Very pretty. So light and fluffy. I made French toast this morning for the family. Heavenly!! I will be making this recipe again. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This bread is beautiful to look at and tastes good, especially when I used it in the Baked French Toast recipe on this site.  CAVEATS: I did double the sugar.  I bake in a 24-inch oven (smaller than traditional) and at 22 minutes in was running to the oven to discover a very dark loaf that was already smelling done.  I covered it to stop more browning and let it finish it's time.  I'm a lazy baker and a dough this sticky was very hard on my mixer, so next time, I may try kneading by hand.  But it is super-light and makes a great braid, and my kids loved it as regular toast.

I have to admit, I was a tad disappointed in this.  From all the rave reviews, I was expecting this to be spectacular.  It wasn't bad, mind you, but it wasn't something I would rave over.  While it did come out very light and fluffy, I found it a little on the dry side, and lacking a little flavour.  I'm sure it will be great used at french toast or bread pudding (I still have one and half of the loaves left), it's not something I would eat on its own.  I baked two loaves rather than one, and they were done in 25 minutes.  I think I'll stick to the Challah I recipe from this site.

Even though I read the other reviews, I forgot to make two loaves. No matter. I made one, gigantic loaf of this bread, and it is delicious! It is light and crusty and wonderful. A person looking to win a ribbon at a county fair could do worse than bake this bread. BTW, I baked mine for 45 minutes, but I covered it with tinfoil for the first 30 minutes. Thanks Kevin!

Great! - played with it a bit - proofed the yeast (fast acting worked better), added 1/4 cup honey, 1tsp salt plus more flour since it was sticky, plus did a second rise after kneading.

Topped one with sesame, the other with poppy seed-also 30 minutes at 350 worked better. Irrestible.

This is the best bread I have ever eaten!  It is very rich.  I made half of the recipe.  1/8 cup of honey made it just a little sweeter.  Coating the top with egg as directed gives the bread a beautiful shine.

not even 2 minutes out of the oven and it's half eaten! Tip, cover bread with foil the last 15 minutes of baking, to prevent over browning, excellent recipe!

This recipe actually teeters between 3 stars and four stars.  The dough was easy to mix and kneaded well.  It took a longer time to complete its first rise.  Cooking time also needed to be decreased as well, so keep a sharp eye on your bread.  

Finished product was pretty, the texture was good, and the flavor was a light sweetness (suprisingly not overly eggy).  I personally did not care for the flavor, but my husband and kids liked it.  So for me it was only a 3 star, but my hubby and kids gave it 4 stars. 

This makes a lot of bread (you could actually get two decent sized loaves).  I cut the recipe in half.

Based on other reviewers, I halved the recipe, and added an extra rise.  It was perfectly done at 23 minutes.  Maybe the full recipe would have taken longer?  It was qiuite yummy.  We ate half and froze half for another night. Will definitely make again.

This bread did not have much flavor and I used farm eggs.    It seems like the salt or something needs to be tweeked.     The free range farm eggs were very dark orange and made a beautifully colored bread.

I halved the recipe.  Used 1/4 cup warm water to proof yeast; added pineapple juice to make required liquid, increased sugar to 1/3 cup, and baked for 25-30 minutes (all ovens vary).  As soon as it's cool enough, I have a slice, because it's gone in no time.  My family can't get enough of it.

I halved the recipe and, as other reviewers suggested, just used 3 whole eggs. I also added 1/4 cup of honey.  I was not happy with the results--the bread did not rise enough and was crumbly?  BUT, since I didn't stick to the original recipe, I didn't think it was fair to ding the rating too much.  Just thought I'd warn other cooks to think twice before tweaking the original version too much.

gorgeous color, huge!, great texture, delicious.  My 15 year old daughter made it, she was thrilled at the results.  I will be making it again as a centerpiece for thanksgiving.  When you see it, you are awestruck.

I cut this recipte in half & completely cooked this in my bread machine. Used bread the next day for French Toast. Really good. I also froze left over French Toast & these toast up really well in a toaster for a quick school morning/work breakfast.

I decided to divide the recipie in half and it still made a HUGE loaf! I had to add a little more flour because it was sticking to everything! I used it the next morning for french toast like others suggested and it was great. My only complaint was that it was a little "eggy" for me.
Still a great recipie and it looked beautiful!
Thanks so much!

This was a great egg bread dough.  I wrapped it around some smoked sausages (like pigs in a blanket) we've eaten them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

I have to say this is the BIGGEST loaf I've ever baked.  I also would make it into 2 smaller loaves next time, unless you're doing it for a party... it certainly looks IMPRESSIVE as one giant loaf.  And with the egg wash- it's just so pretty.  Be careful with the time in the oven.  Mine only took about 30 minutes.  Check it with a thermometer.  A loaf like this should read between 200-210 degrees when it's done.  Don't overcook it.  It is very light.  The only change I would make to the recipe is adding just a tad more salt and maybe 1/3 cup sugar instead of a 1/4 cup (but I DO like my bread a little sweeter).  It is the lightest textured loaf ever, just melts on your tongue.  Would definitely make it again.  But if you're looking for the rich tasting challah bread that you used to get in the bakery, this isn't it.  It is in a class by itself, but not a substitute for traditional challah.  Excellent for french toast.

Pretty good recipe! Used it to make Challah bread this past Thanksgiving and although we are not Jewish it came out excellent. The only thing I would change is cutting the recipe in half unless you are cooking for a large crowd. it is a time consuming process but can't really expect anything else since it is homemade and if done right it is worth it!

This recipe was a hit with my family! Easy to make and so very tasty! Like many others commented it does make a very large loaf ( a bit bigger than a new born baby) but I think thats great because it is going to go fast!

I followed the recipe to the letter, smoke came out of my oven after 23 minutes, but the middle of the bread was still unbaked, so i let it stay in there the full 40.  The outside of the bread is completely burnt, and though the inside is OK, the taste is nothing noteworthy, reminds me of bad grocery store egg bread.  Maybe halving the recipe helps, but I doubt it helps the taste.

Truly a great bread recipe! I started by proofing the yeast. I find that this helps in getting great results with any type of bread. I used a kitchenaid with a dough hook to help with the kneading. It makes a huge loaf, halving the recipe might be better if you don't need such a big bread. Also, I cut the cooking time to 30 minutes. Enjoy!

Great tasting bread!  I made it exactly as written and turned out two large braided loaves and 4 small buns.  A little disappointed in the texture.  It was moist but almost crumbly kind of like a sponge cake.  I was hoping it would be a bit chewier.

Fantastic and simple recipe! Scaled it way down to 6 servings and shaped the dough into round buns instead of braiding. Beautiful golden brown sheen on the outside, fluffy and light texture on the inside. I sprinkled mine with poppy seeds after the second egg-wash, and they make the end result very attractive. Delicious! Make a batch today and your kitchen will smell heavenly.

it was ok, it needs more sugar. the kneading was a sticky mess i had to add flour while i was kneading so i could free my fingers from the stickyness of the dough. it bakes really fast, i got distracted and left it over 40 min. i guess it only takes about 25 min. it was dark on the outside but the core was fluffy. i would probably modify it next time by adding sugar or honey and some butter to add flavor.

The most beautiful bread I've ever made. I read the reviews and divided it into two loaves. They were both HUGE, beautiful and delicious! It does only take about 25 minutes to cook though.

LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOOOVE this bread! I found the recipe a few weeks ago and Ive already made it about 6 times. I usually make it as is or sometimes I double the sugar.  It always comes out PERFECT.   PLEASE WATCH THE COOKING TIME!  Ive never cooked it any longer than 30 minutes when making one big loaf.  Ive been making 2 loafs from this recipe, and they only take about 25 minutes usually at the most. This bread is also very good the next day.   I am so glad I found this recipe, its a keeper!

This is on of the best recipes I have used.  It is so easy and make.  the whole recipe will make 2 big loaves.  So I. make 1/2 the recipe for just the two of us.  The amount of flour depends on the size of the eggs.  Also, I use 3 whole eggs and forget the egg yolks. I always buy jumbo eggs so in half the recipe I use almost 3 cups of flour, also I use 1/3 cup sugar.  So it is an easy recipe to add your own influence too.  No matter what you do, it turnes out delicious.

I understand what one reviewer said about it not having a lot of flavor... I'd definitely increase the sugar next time.  But, I made the recipe exactly like it's first written and the bread has a beautiful texture.  I'm not an experienced bread baker and yet I was incredibly impressed by the professional-quality texture!

This bread is totally unediable on it's own, I was so disappointed when I tried it fresh out of the oven that I did not even serve it.  Since I hated to see so many ingredients go to waste I decided to make bread pudding and it was delicious, so I'd recommend you use it to bake with but not to eat plain.

Excellent Challah bread - it even came good when I cut the recipe in half and made a smaller loaf.

I make this a lot, especially at the holidays.  I like to throw in cranberries, walnuts and cinnamon.  It'll blow your skirt up toasted with butter.

Overall, the recipe is excellent, and tasting it made me discover that this might very well be how some of my favourite Chinese buns are made.  It came out fluffier than anything I've baked yet, and might become one of my favourite methods to use.  

The only problem that I have with the recipe is that it called for much too little flour, or too much moisture.  I accidentally used all 560g of bread flour to begin with, which is (I presume) all 4.5 cups, but the pre-rise mixture was too sticky, and unworkable.  Seeing as how the recipe uses AP flour, this should have been more than enough, but I ended up adding...perhaps another 100g of flour to the mixture to get the cohesive unit that I am used to working with.  

If anyone could post what they used in baker's percentages, that would be fantastic.  I would love to make this again, but it would help to have a solid recipe for reproducibility.  Thanks everyone!

Perhaps I screwed up the recipe, but I followed the directions and the bread was heavy and dry, didn't rise very much, the top cracked and was unusually hard.

I cut this recipe down to 1/3 and it was fairly easy. The bread had a wonderful texture but definitely needed more sugar, or something else...I will try again with a few changes.

This was my first time making bread at home from scratch, and I wanted to make something close to hawaiian bread. I love this recipe, and I'm excited to try it again! I baked it 45 minutes by distraction, and the crust was a little tough,, but the taste was awesome! Next time i'll just have to watch it more carefully :-)

I had to add more sugar and honey. I also had to cook it longer, but it still didn't taste right. I ended up making it into croutons. I will try a different recipe next time.

This was my first attempt at making bread, so it's possible this was my fault.  However, it seemed to come out okay, but I didn't like the flavor and it was annoying using so many eggs for one recipie.

I used only 4 cups of flour and the dough turned out perfect. I followed the recipe instructions exactly. My suggestion would be to cover the loaf for the first 20 minutes of baking as this browned way too quickly and when finished it had a hard thick crust. 

It was not the most flavorful loaf of bread and all that the egg really did was make it a little heavier than a normal baked bread recipe. 

I will try it again to see how it works on a lower heat.....maybe 325.

I took some reviewers suggestions  and used 7 eggs ( because 2 of them were very small) instead of using eggs and yolks. I also added 1/4 cup raw honey in addition to the white sugar. I let it rise 3 times instead of twice.  It made a HUGE loaf. I let it bake for 20 mins and sit in the oven a minute or two.  I can see this being a staple in our kitchen!!

This is our go to recipe for bread. It's rich and eggy.  I skip the braiding and bake it into 3 loaves, either in loaf pans or round loaves on a cookie sheets. About 25 min @ 375.

I wish I would have made 2 loaves, as this thing turned enormous. Plus, I cooked it for 40 minutes, thinking I’ll take it out early, only to find it was already a bit darkish. I expected this to be a little on the sweet side but really, there’s not much of a distinctive flavor. Since the recipe description mentioned Hawaiian ladies,, in the back of my mind, I’m thinking sweet like the store bought rolls. If I made this again, I would tweet the ingredients. As it stands it would probably make a good breakfast casserole or French toast. My house smells so good.

I really wanted to love this bread. It was so easy to put together. It made large,soft , beautiful loaves. Unfortunately, it was so terribly bland. I am not sure what it is missing, but it just missed the mark on flavor.

Tastes like newspapers! (Sorry). Beautiful paper mache crust,  this is basically 2 full sized loaves of a cream puff like delicacy.  
To add flavor i would suggest double the salt and sugar and add half cup dried milk powder.  
.....Beware!  This doubled so high it hit the top of my oven!  You must divide it.  Cooking time way too long.  Check this at 20 minutes.

WARNING!  This recipe makes a huge "take up the whole oven" loaf of bread!   I knew it would and separated the dough into 3 separate breads.   Overall it's a good recipe.  I found it to be a little underwhelming.   It lacked a sweetness I was looking for in an egg bread.  Next time (and I will make it again) I will add a bit more sugar.  Also, it you are making 3 loaves from the recipe the cook time is only 20 minutes.

This is a very simple and quick recipe, and the bread tastes wonderful. I was making an English summer pudding which is a bread pudding with fruit. It was perfect and I had enough egg bread to make it 6 times. As several reviewers suggested, I divided it into 2 loaves, and even with that they were pretty big. I need some practice braiding, but I think they looked pretty good. It freezes well and I am planning to use the rest for a savoury mushroom bread pudding.

Good recipe.  I made two loaves instead of one. They are huge! I also changed the amount of yolks to 2 and added 5 eggs. I baked it for 18 minutes. I will do it again for sure!

This bread is absolutely amazing! Be careful of the baking time though. My bread was ready after only 20 minutes. 40 minutes would over cook it.

My family loved this bread. I was asked to make another loaf before they were done eating the first one.

This was my first experience making bread and it turned beautifully! I made 2 smaller loaves instead of 1 but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was ready to come out of the oven in 20 minutes. Highly recommend this recipe!

This is an amazing recipe. It is very moist and rich without being sweet. Makes great french toast. I have made a loaf of this for thanksgiving every year for 3 years. The only time I wouldn't recommend it is if you don't have a large family since this bread is pretty big. This year I even shaped and made it into a turkey.

I made this almost exactly to the recipe, but ended up adding 1/2 cup flour because the dough was way too sticky (I measured the flour by weight so who knows if something was lost in translation).     I also only needed 20 minutes bake time, bottom rack and tented for half of it.   

Like other reviewers, I ended up with two good sized loafs.  They were extremely light, and very bland.    I'll ding the recipe for the blandness, but I suspect it was my own personal preference that egg bread shouldn't be that light.   

I plan to use the rest in French toast, but that's about it.

5 starts for taste and consistency, absolutely delicious. 
Needed changes to recipe: 

Bake time, maybe 25 mins tops, or it will burn.

Cut rise times in half or maybe go with 1 yeast packet. 

Following the directions exactly yielded a GIGANTIC loaf - thought it was gonna push the oven door open and make a break for it ;-)

But still delicious!

I made this bread and it was definitely burned and I took it out 10 minutes early. After taking the crust off  it tastes great, so I will probably try this recipe again, but at 350 F instead of the 375.

Excellent recipe, great for using up heaps of eggs. Thank you for sharing. As advised by other reviewers I just used 6 whole eggs. Used honey instead of sugar (we have bees as well as chickens).  I did this in the bread machine to the dough stage. Needs to cook in foil as also advised somewhere. Made into two huge plaits - loved it:-)

A very good bread. I chose to make this because I had a lot of leftover egg yolks from a different recipe. I made the whole recipe, but divided it into two braided loaves. It cooked in about 15-18 minutes. Its a little on the bland side. I'm not sure what its missing (possibly a touch more sugar?) but its a good bread to put with something- soup, spinach dip, jam, etc.

This was good, but it could be better! The texture was good, but the bread needs WAY more than 1 teaspoon of salt. I ended up with a huge loaf and was disappointed as it was sweet, but bland. I made meringue the week before and had 6 leftover egg yolks, so this recipe was perfect for me but I doubt I'd make it again unless I have leftover egg yolks again. If I did, I would definitely use closer to 3 tsp of salt. Also, I baked my loaf for 30 minutes and it was browner than I would have liked, and the interior was a bit too dry. I think 20-25 minutes would be better, depending on your oven.

I did not make any changes to this recipe and was so excited to try it based on the reviews here. I'll say that I thought this baked perfectly and the instructions were fine but there is no sweetness what-so-ever in this bread. I will make it again, but most likely will omit the white sugar and add honey.

This was a easy recipe but because the batter was very sticky it was very hard to braid but it turn out well. What I found put was to wet the towel that covered the dough in hot water and it doubled the size in half the time.

This recipe does not disappoint.  I followed it but added 1/4 cup of honey.  It turned out soft and fluffy inside and crispy outside.  Delicious!

This was ok. It was really light and fluffy but it just doesn't have much taste. My son found out that he loves it when he makes cinnamon toast out of it, so that's a plus. I chose this recipe because I had 7 leftover yolks from making meringue  cookies and the only thing different I did from the original recipe was to add the extra yolk. Be warned that this makes a HUGE loaf!  Mine measured 18"x 9"x 3.5"

Love this egg bread. I make it super rich by changing the oil to butter and use milk instead of water. I actually make rolls with the dough rather than bread. Comes out perfect.

We used 8 duck eggs and one used for the egg wash.  2 tablespoons of yeast and 1 1/2 teaspoons baking power.  Used a 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Takes 5 1/2 cups of flour in the end.

The Egg Bread was delish! I cut the recipe in half so it would serve 9 people. It was very light and fuffly. So overall this bread is a little time consuming but it was worth it. If I could fix one thing it would be is that cook it for 20min-35min it was done at 25 for me. I would totally try making this bread if I were you!

As previously mentioned, the baking time is  way off. My oven runs hot so I baked it at 350 and it was well browned at 26 minutes.  Splitting the dough into two loaves would also improve the recipe. The taste is unspectacular. I expected something much richer considering the number of eggs involved.  I wouldn't have made it if I didn't have a ridiculous number of eggs to use up and I doubt I'll be making it again.

This recipe is awesome!  I have made it quite a few times with perfect results every time. I am always getting requests to make it for friends.  I have made it both with 6 yolks and 3 eggs as well as just using 6 whole eggs with pretty much the same results.  The dough is very sticky so as some suggested I added additional flour once and the bread turned out too dry. So for me it's best to work with the sticky dough. I also have convection oven. I set to convection bake 280 degrees, cover bread with foil after 8 to 10 minutes and it's done after a total of about 24 minutes.  Try this recipe. You'll love it!  It makes awesome french toast as well as bread pudding!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This bread is fabulous! Light and airy. I did bake it at 350 degrees. I also put it on two pans, so the bottom would not overbrown. I found that 30 min. was enough. I used a piece of dry spaghetti to test the bread doneness.  It comes out looking "gourmet".

The recipe is huge, and cutting it in half would yield a nice sized loaf. The bake time recommended is far too long; I baked mine for about 25 or 30 minutes. The bread is very light, however it is also quite flavorless. I will not be making this bread again, unless the french toast I make with it turns out to be out of this world... Kind of defeats the purpose of making fresh bread at home, though.
