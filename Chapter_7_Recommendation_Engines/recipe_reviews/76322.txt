Great jello salad, loaded with fruit.  We love all things tart and this fit the bill.  Per other review, I will make with raspberry (or maybe apricot?) jello next time & there will be a next time.

Easy and delicious. I think its better with raspberry jello, but this depends on your taste buds.

My family makes something like this, but we have never added lemon. We do add a lot of coconut which helps it keep it shape (put it in a jello mold and it is very pretty to set on the table).

I normally use cherry Jello and add pecans. Usually put it in a food processor to chop apples, oranges, cranberries and nuts. Love this dish!
