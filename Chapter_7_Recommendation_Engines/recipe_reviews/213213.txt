This fudge was fantastic.  My only regret was that I didn't find the recipe before Christmas.  I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing I would change is add nuts next time.  It did take more cooking time (about 30 minutes) but that could have been because my butter was cold from the fridg.  I'll warn you...this makes a lot.  I poured it into two 9x13 cookie sheets.  The peanut butter addition really made this special.  Everyone loved it and I will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I have tried all my life to make fudge. I have tried so many recipes and this is the only one I could get to work and it tastes great--my boys love it, I can't keep it in the house!!

This recipe was perfect. I made this fudge for Valentines day and it went over so well. Warning it makes a lot! Only change I made was adding a bit more chocolate (4 ounces more of the chocolate candy). AMAZING!

Very tasty! I'm a first time fudge maker, and a few things happened that I'm not sure were supposed to: 1) Because of the large quantities of ingredients in this recipe, I used my cheapo stock pot so I would have room to accomodate everything. Even though I turned the heat down to medium low and stirred constantly, my butter/milk kept scortching. 2) There was no way that after I had squished the fudge into the 13x9 pan, room temp peanut butter was going to incorporate itself into the fudge no matter how much knife swirling I did. I melted the peanut butter in the microwave, poured it over the top and then swirled it in. It tastes delightful upon initial sampling, and once I cut it up a little more, I'll let you know how it holds together

This stuff is awesome!  It is so easy to make compared to other candy recipes I've tried, it feels almost like cheating - I just made a half-batch in about 10 minutes yesterday while entertaining my 7 month old.  I'm a bit of a fudge snob so I was surprised how good it is - really creamy.  I made it without the peanut butter and it's still good - I used Hershey's and am going to try it with Ghirardelli next time since I'm guessing it might be even better - but awesome either way.  Thanks Fat Pete!

I thought this fudge was way too sweet, but it was very easy to make.  I made it for Christmas and family members enjoyed it.  I followed one reviewer's suggestion and added half of the peanut butter to the mixture in the pot and swirled the rest of the peanut butter into the 9x13 pan.  Since you need to work quickly, I recommend mixing your chocolate chips, candy, marshmallow, etc. together in a large bowl while your butter, sugar and evaporated milk is heating.  Then, just add the entire bowl of ingredients to the pot in one shot.

So easy!  I halved this recipe and put it in an 11 x 7 pan---worked great.  The peanut butter is a must!  (even though it is hard to swirl)  I will definitely make this again.

omg, this fudge was to die for.  I used Hershey's milk chocolate bars and semisweet chips.  It really wasn't hard to swirl the peanut butter for me.  I just dropped globs onto the fudge and then swirled it around with a knife.  I tried the Aunt Teen's fudge a few weeks ago and this was far superior.  I liked the consistency way better of this fudge.  It was nice and soft and delicious!  I will definitely be keeping this recipe.  Thanks Pete!

This recipe makes one deliciously fine fudge.  What I did, though, was use Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips and left out the peanut butter.  The fudge was rich and devinely decadent!  And it makes SO MUCH I was giving it away for weeks.  I kept it out in the garage which was quite cold over the winter holidays and it seemed as if the longer it sat the better it tasted.  This is one recipe I will keep and make FOR-EVER!!!  Thanks!

Excellent!  You don't need to use peanut butter if you want just plan fudge.  I used all chocolate chips because I didn't have a candy bar.  I also only used one jar of fluff by accident and it still turned out great.  If you use peanut butter, don't warm it in the microwave, like some suggest, because it gets way too runny, unless you want to pour a layer of peanut butter on top of the fudge.

Wonderful! This was my first time making fudge and it is so good that I can't stop nibbling on it.  I didn't have milk chocolate chips on hand, so I had to use semi-sweet.  I also took the lazy way out and used Reese's Peanut Butter Candy bars instead of chocolate candy bars and swirling peanut butter on the top. I took some to work and they raved about the taste and the consistency.  Next time I will make it exactly as the recipe states because I have no doubt it will be perfect that way as well.  Just a great recipe!

I was looking for a recipe similar to what I grew up with, and this was it! My only changes were to use semi-sweet chocolate chips, and use 3 cups instead of two, rather than adding another kind of chocolate candy, and to add 1 cup of peanut butter with the chocolate, rather than swirling it. I make a separate batch of PB fudge, so adding just a cup of PB adds a nice touch to purely chocolate fudge. Rather than refrigerating it, I let it cool at room temperature, and cut it a few hours later. This recipe is a keeper!

I'm not personally a fan of fudge, but the family thought this was just "ok."  I got a couple reports that it was too marshmallow-y, the color was off-putting (I guess it was not the super-dark colored fudge they're used to), and the peanut butter was not consistent (which was my own fault).

This was a big hit at Christmas! It was smooth and delicious ... had no problems with the peanut butter and thought it was fairly easy. I put it all in one 9x13 pan ... some people mentioned they had to split it but it worked out perfectly for me as is ... didn't change a thing!

this is officially the best fudge I've ever eaten.  I cut the recipe in half but forgot to half the evaporated milk, and maybe this is what kept it soooooo creamy.  Like butta.  I used a Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate bar in place of the Hersheys.  No one could believe I made this.  thank you thank you thank you......

This fudge is really good!  Let me start by telling what I did...I think that this is my biggest cooking goof up ever!!!  I bought all of my ingredients and was ready to do this!  I made it just like the recipe said and tasted it and had to spit it out!  Why?...b/c I used 4 1/2 cups of SALT, instead of sugar!!!  So, I was determined and made it again with SUGAR (I highly recommend that!) and it's great!  I will make this again and make sure that the salt is put far away from me!!!

This fudge is YUM-O!!!  It's a lot of creamy goodness.  :)  It is definitely worth the arm work in mixing.  I didn't add the peanut butter at the end because of time and it was quite dense once poured into the pan.  This will definitely be somethine I make throughout the year.

This is the best! I was afraid it might be too sweet, but was wonderful and creamy. I only added peanut butter to one half of the pan so I could decide which way I liked it best, but you couldn't go wrong either way. It would be good too if you added pecans to it just before you poured it into your pan. I will definitely make this again!!

Made it by the recipe, got tons of great comments on it. 16oz if chocolate candy is a lot more than I expected. Microwaving the peanut butter to be able to swirl it in is essential! This makes a nice light(hahha) fluffy fudge.

This really caught my eye and turned out wonderful despite all my modifications due to the fact that I did not have candy bars (used another bag of milk chocolate) or marshmallow creme (used a large bag of marshmallows).  It is setting now in my fridge and I know it is going to be wonderful!!!

SO GOOD!  I followed the directions exactly and the result was delicious.  It does make quite a bit, but we shared with several people.  My peanut butter swirl did not work out quite like I expected, but who cares?  It still tasted good.  The end result smells exactly like a Reese's Peanutbutter Cup.  Yum!

This fudge was delicious. I made this at Christmas time with another type of fudge I often make, and Fat Pete's disappeared a lot more quickly!

Super simple and fast fudge that is so adaptable! I used this recipe to clean out the little bags of various leftover chocolate chips from my freezer and a 3/4 jar of marshmallow creme I had.  Only made 1/2 batch and used less than 1 jar of marshmallow creme.  Made as directed, boiling the candy mix 7 minutes over medium heat.  I then threw in the mm cream, 5.2 oz of milk chocolate (3 pack of little belgian milk choc bars from trader joe's), about 3 oz. of milk chocolate chips (ghirardelli & hershey's), a cup of semi sweet choc chips, and about 1/3 cup of ghirardelli bittersweet chips.  These were just what I had, and I would definitely try it with all milk or just a little semisweet, too!  After I mixed the chocolate in, it was basically a dough, but spread pretty easily into the foiled, greased pan.  I microwaved about 3/4 cup of pb to swirl in, but it really wasn't swirling at all, just sort of mixing it with a lot of work, so I only added about 1/2 of it and just basically mixed it into the top of the fudge.  Result still tasted like pb-choc fudge, but the top layer had an odd texture.  I think I'll do all chocolate next time.  Still very yummy and super easy!

This fudge is absolutely amazing. But I read a few comments that say that it makes too much, so I halved the recipe-I should have followed it because the fudge was less than half an inch thick. Otherwise, it was wonderful :)

Very yummy! Creamy and oh so good. Had a challenge with the p-nut butter. Used a 9 x 13 pan and it was the perfect size; would not cut recipe in half. Thank you Rita for sharing!

I tried this recipe around christmas time, because I wanted to do something different instead of cookies. This was so good, everyone was fighting over the last piece. My cousin hid it in her room so nobody else could have it. GREAT RECIPE, THANKS FAT PETE!

All of the other fudge recipes I looked at were so intimidating!  Not only did this recipe have wonderful reviews, it gave simple instructions without the need for a candy thermometer!  And on top of that, I made it and it worked!  This is delicious fudge with a great consistency and flavor!

Well, I'm not the biggest fudge fan, but decided I would try this for a cookie exchange we were doing. I thought I had hershey bars at home, but I only had one. But I did have reeses peanut butter cups, so I substituted those for the chocolate bars, and took out the peanut butter. They were good, but I guess I still just not  a fudge fan, but those who were fuge fans absolutely LOVED these, some even said it as the best fudge they ever had.

I made exactly as the recipe called for.  It is rich & very creamy. I might just put 1 cup pf pnt butter next time as some pieces were very pnt buttery.
I had a hard time cutting it even tho I left it in fridge overnight. (by accident) It's not a firm fudge. It's very tasty & if you luv pnt butter & chocolate, you will luv this! It does taste like a Reese's cup but much better!

This was delicious, fast and easy... easily the best fudge recipe I have used.  1/2 my family likes nuts, 1/2 likes peanut butter, I halved the peanut butter and swirled it through 1/2 of the 13X19 pan and put nuts in the other half... Only had to make 1 pan to please everyone.

Easiest and best ever fudge!  Have made several times and follow recipe exactly - except w/o the peanut butter.  Last time, I forgot to let it boil for 5-7 minutes, just stirred in the marshmallow and chocolate right after it came to a boil and it still turned out perfectly!  I get requests for this recipe every time I make this.  LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!

This fudge was delicious and I love the fact that it made a lot.  It is a very soft fudge and i did find it difficult to cut.  I think next time i might buy some inexpensive small foil pans and pour the fudge in then and give out the small pans as gifts.  Very easy to make and yummy though!!!

This is so awesome! Rave, rave reviews from everyone that tried it! I would recommend cutting the batch in half unless you want a ton of fudge, or splitting the batch into two pans.

I didn't like this fudge, at first - but after letting it sit for a day, it grew on me. And, received GREAT compliments from all that tried it. It's easy enough to make. I made a batch w/out peanut butter for my son who has peanut allergies and nobody liked that near as much as the one with peanut butter. I also found it hard to swirl the peanut butter, so think I'll go with other reviewers and just melt the PB into the mix, next time.  My biggest hang-up regarding this fudge is that the color is not that appealing. I used a mix of semi-sweet and milk chocolate which turned a weird gray-brown after adding the marshmellow.

Mmmm...it was very sweet and very good. I think it was a little too much peanut butter for most people, but I love peanut butter so I'm not complaining. I will definitely make this again & very soon because Christmas is right around the corner.

This was the best fudge and the easiest to make. It's my first time to ever make fudge, but I saw this recipe and figured it's easy, so I did it. I took it to a small party and it all disappeared with so many wonderful comments and praise. Thank you for this delicious fudge!

Taste is good, but I'm only giving 2 stars because even after letting it refridgate overnight, it is still the consistency of nutella.  I followed the recipe precisely, and the end product did not set up even after an overnight.  I'm not sure where I went wrong.   So now I have a 9x13 pan of chocolately goo.

For Pete's sake this is good fudge! :)  The consistency is spot on in my opinion, very smooth and creamy.  The peanut butter was no problem swirling in because I microwaved it maybe 20 seconds, then poured it on. I used chunky peanut butter...fabulous! Thank you Pete, and Rita for sharing!

I halved this recipe and used a 8x8 baking dish. I used peanut butter M&M's as the chocolate candies, added a half cup of chopped salted peanuts and used extra chunky peanut butter. The end result was fantastic, one of the best fudge recipes I've made yet. The peanut butter is what makes this fudge, I think.

Wow! I like this much better than Aunt Teen's, because it is not as sugary tasting and easier to manage for me. I followed the recipe pretty closely, except that I used Reese's mini peanut butter cups, dark chocolate chips and crunchy peanut butter. Just tasted it, and it SO good I will make it my go-to fudge recipe from now on. Thank you dearly, Fat Pete!!

Super good. I mixed 1 cup of the peanut butter into the batter and then swirled the other at the end. Very thick in a 10x13 pan. Could easily make 2 pans.

I can't believe I would say this about fudge but this recipe was way too sweet!  I love the name and how the poster discovered this recipe and  that's why I tried it.  As for a review... if you like really sweet fudge this is the recipe for you.  I followed the recipe exactly (my prerequisite for reviewing) and if I were to make it again I would either cut down the sugar or choose 60% bittersweet chocolate.  The texture was beautiful and the end result was a nice looking candy as well as a seriously fun name ... but for me way too sweet!

An excellent flavor to add is malt powder stirred in after removed from heat.  Don't add to recipe during cooking.

This was an excellent recipe. Freeze or refrigerate it to get it to set up properly.  My daughter-in-law called it "magical!"   Thank you Fat Pete!

Loved it! It rivals my family's recipe, which takes much longer and is very tempermental and can sugar easily if not handled correctly. This was fast, easy, creamy, sets nicely and presents beautifully . No thermometer or expertise needed. I left off the peanut butter and added lots of walnuts - we are a nutty family. ;)

I was expecting more of a "pop" of flavor. Seemed to meld and not stand out.

I have used this recipe for 5 years now!  I don't really like fudge, but this is delicious.  The peanut butter helps balance the sweet.  I use semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate.  I divide the batch into 2 pans bc it makes a lot.  Sometimes I keep one side plain or add cherries or nuts.  My family and friends love it!

This is definitely a recipe I make every Christmas since I found it three years ago. Hubby loves it and it makes a great (easy) alternative for cookie exchanges!

This fudge was easy to make and tastes very good. The recipe makes a lot! In my 13" x 9" pan, it was a 1 1/2" inches deep! If I make this again, I'll halve the recipe but use the same pan. Also, I used natural peanut butter on the top but it never set up like the fudge did. Next time, I'll pour half the fudge into the pan, add the layer of peanut butter, and then pour the rest of the fudge on top.

Made this for the holidays and found this to be very creamy and smooth but very soft as well.  Took a long time to set and even then it would turn almost to mush after about 5 minutes out of the fridge.  Peanut butter did not mix in well either leaving large globs of peanut butter within the fudge.

Perfect! Loved this recipe. The only thing is, it didn't need 2 cups of peanut butter. If you just want it marbled on top, one cup is more than enough. I loved the contrast between the PB and chocolate. Better than regular peanut butter fudge.

I'm not a fudge fan, but made it for my fam and got rave reviews.  I did like the others suggested and put the peanut butter into the pan.  I also did half almond butter, half peanut butter, just for kicks.

This recipe was fantastic! I made it for the first time for a New Years Party, and not only was it easy, but it was delicious. I made 1/2 of the pan peanut butter, and the other half regular fudge, and both tasted amazing. I would highly recommend this recipe. I will be making this one for years to come.

An absolute favorite at my husband's work for Christmas!  I do use 16oz of milk chocolate chips and then 2 1/2 cups of semi-sweet chips.

Tried this recipe and it's simply delicious. I decided to become creative and switch it up to make white chocolate fudge as well. I switched out the milk chocolate chips for white chocolate chips and used Hersheys cookies n cream candy bar instead. To make it even better I topped it off with nutella instead of peanut butter. This is most definitely a dangerous recipe! You have been warned!! Happy eatings everyone.

This came out really well even though I didn't quite do everything correctly. I didn't have quite enough evaporated milk, I used an entire bag of mini marshmallows (because I was too lazy to count them all out to substitute for the marshmallow creme), and a mix of semi-sweet, milk chocolate chips and baking chocolate for the candy/chocolate mix. I boiled for six minutes and stirred occasionally to make sure it wasn't sticking. 

My fudge started to set before i could even swirl in the PB, so i had to do the microwave-and-spread trick like some other reviewers. My fudge was really hard to cut, and just a little too sweet for my taste, but really smooth and something I will be happy to gift for the holidays! I will probably add even more baking chocolate next time to neutralize the sugary-ness, but I am keeping this as my standard fudge recipe!

Super yummy, though it started to get hard to stir very fast. Added peanut butter and it was a hit at my family's Thanksgiving get together. Will make again!

This is a DELICIOUS recipe. I used Hershey Kisses as the "chocolate candy". I don't think I cooked the sugar mixture long enough since the fudge loses it's shape after being at room temperature for 15 minutes. Granted, I could just keep it refrigerated but for the sake of passing it out as Christmas gifts, it needs to be able to keep it's shape while transporting. Also, I love milk chocolate so this was great for me. For those who don't enjoy their chocolate as sweet, I would recommend using half semi-sweet and half bittersweet or even ALL bittersweet since the recipe uses quite a bit of sweetener.
