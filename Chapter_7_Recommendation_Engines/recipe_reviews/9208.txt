I have made this recipe just as it is (except with a little less bourbon :) or have combined it with a sweet potato souffle recipe and it has been phenomenal both ways. Whenever Thanksgiving comes around my friends are constently asking for the recipe. To combine it with a souffle recipe I simply fold in one or two eggs and add about a teaspoon of vanilla to the recipe. I then add a crubled pecan topping that consists of pecans, brown sugar, and butter. Yum!!

This is so good.  Not too sweet.  I chose to leave the marshmellows out.  I have made it several times now and everyone loves it.

Yummy! Didn't have the bourbon or the pumpkin pie spice, so added allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg. Browned the marshmallows as recommended. It came out great.

This was very good but the orange flavor was overpowering. Might be good for someone who doesn't like the flavor of sweet potatoes. Next time I make it (and I'll definitely make it again) I'll half the amount of orange the recipe calls for.

Easy, and delicious.  I didn't have an orange, so I substituted with std orange juice, and it turned well.  This will be a fall staple at our dinner table.

Great dish!  I loved the addition of the orange flavor and zest in sweet potatoes!  No bourbon and don't need marshmallows - it's sweet enough.   Maybe candied pecans on top would give it a nice crunch?

Not sure what I did wrong, but the sweet potatoes didn't get tender enough and I ended up having to put them in the food processor.  A mess!  The finished product tasted good, but wasn't a huge departure from traditional sweet potato dishes.

I had to use canned sweet potatoes. I didn't have oranges either so I substituted clementines ('lil cuties) for the juice and zest.  I added walnut pieces to the top and pushed them into the sweet potatoes.

I used yams rather than sweet potatoes, and crushed pecans in place of marshmallows. Came out wonderfully.

Great way to jazz up sweet potatoes! I didn't have any bourbon so I just added enough orange juice to give it the right consistency. I left off the marshmallows to cut down on calories. Was still sweet but not too sweet.
