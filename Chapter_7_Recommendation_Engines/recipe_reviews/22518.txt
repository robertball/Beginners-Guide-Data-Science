Based on another review about the oiliness, I cut the oil back to 2/3 cup and used 2/3 of the package of ranch dressing. My family likes less salt and fat, so the modifications were perfect for us. Great snacking material,Bea. As you said, nice change from the other party mix and a lot easier.Thanks.

Very good.  Shook ingredients in paper bag to absorb some of the oil.

If you do not like buttery popcorn, you will not like this recipe - skip it.  However, if your family is like mine and likes their popcorn the butterier the better, then you will LOVE IT! I love the ranch flavor and the simplicity of the recipe. A+++

This was soooo good!!  It is absolutely addicting.  I was worried it was going to be greasy but it wasn't at all.  I gave it to my parents for Christmas and they said it was the best mix I've made for them yet.

I agree--it's too oily, but I solved that problem.  I laid out newspapers on the table and put paper towels on top and spread the mixture on that.  It absorbed the extra oiliness. The stored it in zipper bags.  It makes so much that I can use it more than once and have leftovers.   It is Very addicting!  I love it!

Be prepared!  This makes A LOT of party mix!  Two of the really large round Tupperware bowls.  Which is a good thing really.  Very tasty and quite addictive.  I made it for my 4th of July party and a lot got eaten, but there was so much I brought the leftovers to work the next day and when it was gone people were still looking around for the bowl.  The only change I would suggest is adding more nuts.  They kind of got lost in all the crackers and cereal.

I make this and send it to family and friends who are away at college, usually around midterm and just before final exams...I ship it in a small, new trash bucket.  This snack mix is consumed immediately and is much enjoyed because it is a little spicier.  Hats off to Dana! :)

Yum! I couldn't find most of the ingredients in the sizes listed here. My rice cereal, oyster crackers and cheese-filled sandwich crackers were available in smaller sizes. I reduced the oil since my ingredients weighed less and I omitted the nuts (just not a fan of them in party mix). My favorite part are the cheese crackers!

It was a little too greasy, but that small factor aside the flavor was delicious. Will definitely be my new favorite party mix recipe.

Some of my ingredients were of a smaller weight than the recipe, however, I used all of the oil/seasoning mix. It looked oily when I first mixed it up in a paper grocery sack.  Because I had the time, I went ahead and baked it for 30 min. at 300 degrees. It did not seem oily after baking. Because i was taking it to a workplace, I put it in snack sized bags and filled 40 with the batch. Very tasty and a nice change from traditional mix.

Loved it!!!!!  I've made it 3 times in the past 3 weeks.  Only substitution was cheez-its for goldfish....just personal preference.  Did not think it was too oily.  I cut down on oil first 2 times.....3rd time followed recipe.....it was perfect.  I make this for my neighbors at Christmas.....they love it.

Very simple to make, and well liked by all I served.  Makes three large ziplock bags of mix.

This was great, I didn't have the popcorn oil so I used olive oil. It gave the whole thing a bit of a Mediterranean taste.

Very good and easy.  I left the nuts out since my family does not care for them.  It is a little oily but I will try some of the things others used to absorb some of the oil next time.  Oh and its 3 year old approved :)

I did not have the cheese-filled crackers. I just added in more goldfish crackers. I also used a homemade ranch dressing mix. I did bake this spread into a deep pan--250* for an hour, stirred every 15 minutes just to make them crispy and to help that oil soak in. We LOVED this snack mix. GREAT for movie night and the kids asked for me to pack some in their lunches the next day!

Awesome stuff!  I had to change it a little bit because of either taste preferences and/or store availability; for example, one packet of ranch wasn't enough for our taste buds so we added three, and we used cheese it instead of nuts which also made up for the smaller boxes of chex that were available to us in the store.  Somebody said they'd give me $100 to make $100 worth of this stuff.   Some of us really liked the rice Chex, some of us did not, etc., but overall it was a Christmas hit and a hit for my spouse to share at work.  ******NOTE to the people who said it is "too oily": it is oily because you are trying to eat it right away; let it sit for several hours or even a whole day before you eat it because then it won't be oily at all.   I have a large bowl, but it wasn't large enough to mix it all together, so I dumped it into a scent-free plastic garbage bag, and mixed it every so often.

I made this without the cheese crackers. I forgot to buy them. This party mix is great no matter what you put into it. I used coconut popcorn oil with the ranch dressing. I also put the large stainless steel bowl in the oven at 175 degrees to dry the mix — mixing with a spoon about every 15 minutes for about an hour. Delicious!
