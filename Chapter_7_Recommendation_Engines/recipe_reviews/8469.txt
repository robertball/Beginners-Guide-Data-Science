I was excited to try because it was so freakin' simple and good.  Here are my SUPER EASY CHEATS:  Use a pre-made Nilla Wafer crust, canned apple pie filling and the pre-made tub of Philly Cheesecake Mix found in your grocery deli section by the cream cheese.  Add yummy caramel and chopped nuts to the top (or crushed toffee bits/candy) and let it sit for a few hours.  EASY AND YUMMY!

My impression was that it was pretty good, but there was something about it I didn't care for, although I couldn't put my finger on it.  Then my husband tried it and said it was "interesting" (translation: I'm not sure if I care for this or not - which was basically my reaction).  He said he loved the apples and caramel part, but the cheesecake part was very bland. It was a fluffy consistency, not a creamy consistency.  I think the filling needed more vanilla to help with the flavor.

I thought this came out really well.  I put in a full teaspoon of vanilla after reading other peoples comments, and also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the mix.  I made the crust and put 1/4tsp cinnamon in there as well.  turned out yummy.

I used this recipe for inspiration but tweaked it a bit using other recipes found on this site.
First of all, I used the pie crust recipe for "Healthier Pie Crust".  I thought that the oatmeal crust would pair up nicely with the apples.
Then I followed the technique used in the "Double Layer Pumpkin Cheesecake" recipe to make the filling.  I spread half of the filling onto the crust.  Then I mixed in about 1/2 a can of apple pie filling, some spices, and whipped it with the cream cheese.  I was able to blend the apple pieces using my mixer, but you may want to cut them into smaller chunks if they are large.
Finally, I spread this layer onto the plain cream cheese layer and baked it.
I didn't add any apple filling onto the top because it looked moist enough already, but I did drizzle some caramel over the top before baking.
Thanks for the inspriation to experiment with different cheesecake flavors!

REALLY REALLY GOOD! I hold an annual Cheesecake Party every year in December, and this was one of this year's samples. Among 11 other cheesecakes, this was voted on by the majority of my family and friends as the favorite of the night. The only change I made was to make my crust out of cinnamon graham crackers,butter, and ground pecans instead of using a store bought one..I think it really enhanced the flavor. The apples on the bottom were a nice surprise mixed in with the cheesecake. This is definatly a make again!

This is the best cheesecake recipe I've followed yet!  The cream cheese filling was so smooth and creamy.  I made this for Thanksgiving and I'm already getting requests for Christmas.

Using "cinnamon & spice" apple pie filling and 1 1/4 teaspoons of vanilla extract (instead of only 1/4 teaspoon), were the only changes I made.  This gave it more flavor, I think.

I made this for my husbands birthday for something different other then a cake. All we can say is WOW! This is so different and delicious. I read what other people's comments were, I added 2tsps vanilla to the mix instead of just the 1/4tsp I also added cinnamon to the canned apples. Becareful though this is a very RICH desert, but well worth it. Easy to make as well.

Good and easy!
Try it with the "sauteed apples" recipe from this site instead of the canned apples..as well as "sauteen peaches" (sub peaches w/same recipe) for a yummy summer cheesecake when peaches are in season (eliminating the caramel topping) and you could sautee chopped pecans with small amount of butter; add cinnamon and brown sugar to go w/peaches. Thank you for the recipe!

I just made this for a dorm Thanksgiving luncheon. It wasn't appealing to look at because the top slid off the apples when it was cut into. Once I started getting people to try it, it was gone in minutes!!! My commander even had two pieces:P
I don't know if letting it sit overnight would help. I did and it still slid.
Definitely going into my cookbook!

This was good. My husband had a cheesecake like this in a diner and wanted me to try it. I tried it bt added a streusal topping. It was delicious but the recipes says CHILL UNTIL READY TO SERVE, and ours wasn't set enough. I would suggest making it the day before and chilling overnight. Thanks

This recipe was quite delicious and super easy! I used the pre-packaged mini graham cracker crusts b/c I can't make a crust to save my life plus I was making for my mom's bday and didn't want to give her half the pie as I HAD to see what it tasted like.  Nonetheless, I used the no sugar added apple pie filling (use sugar added if you can find) and I did notice a little difference in the taste...so I added a little cinnamon and a bit of sugar and it turned out fine!  Placed the apple filling in the bottoms and covered with the cream cheese filling.  Baked at 350 for about 20 or so minutes with a water bath below.  FIRST TIME A CHEESECAKE DIDN'T BREAK ON ME!!  I let them cool for a bit on a rack then transferred to frig.  I made the sauce and added a little more cinnamon and let it cool a bit as well b/c I thought the warm sauce/cool cake would ruin it.  It turned out perfect!  Try this one, its easy and tasty.  I added a dollop of whipped cream when I served.

I was searching the internet for a new cheesecake recipe and saw this one...  Kinda funny that this was a Paula Deen recipe circa 2005 (foodnetwork.com).  Regardless, it is awesome!  I've been making this for years and everyone loves it.  I don't do the nuts and usually do the mini graham crusts for single servings but it's been my favorite cheesecake for years!

This cheesecake was delicious!! I was reluctant to using canned pie filling as it can have an artificial taste but I followed the recipe exactly and the end result was amazing. It was the perfect finish to our Thanksgiving meal...thank you for submitting such an easy and heavenly recipe.

Everyone has loved this cheesecake!  I added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the apple pie filling because I couldn't find it already with it.  I also topped with crumbled toffee pieces.  SO GOOD!!   It was definitely better on the second day after the flavors melded. Just finished making a second one and this time around I added extra caramel into the apples in the bottom.  We'll see on Thanksgiving how it turned out.... I will definitely make this again and again!

Super simple to put together.  I changed it up a bit buy using 2 ready made crust.  Pressing 1 1/2 crusts into a ceramic pic plate.  Using the remaining crumbs to decorate the ecdge of the Cheesecake after spreading on the apple/caramel topping.  Of couse, add more pecans.

Very easy and tasty!!  I did not buy a graham cracker crust, just made my own.  When making your own, don't bake the crust first.  I stuck it in the freezer to get it cold before filling it.

I followed the directions exactly. Didn't care for it too much, I guess I was just expecting something a little different. Other people who tried it seemed to like it though.

I made this cheesecake for my boyfriend's bday and it turned out amazingly good! I made it the night before and let it chill overnight and for most of the day. It was a little messy but stayed in tact for the most part. I added about 1 tsp more vanilla than the recipe called for. I also drizzled caramel on top of the apples at the end before placing it in the fridge.

The funniest thing about this is that my sister-in-law made this cheesecake and I never got the recipe from her (it was a busy day!), so I went home and made it myself...it's this exact recipe...  This cheesecake is THE BEST autumn treat!!!!!  I can't wait for fall in a couple of months just so I can make it for everyone again!  --Update: I made this again with cherry filling instead of apple - equally delicious!--

My first baked cheesecake was this and it turned out amazing. I omitted the nuts because we don't like them and I didn't heat the carmel and apples before I topped the cake and it came out perfect. Will definetly make again and again.

Awesome. This was my first cheesecake and I made it for Christmas. It was really good. The apple filling really added to the cheesecake, and I enjoyed the apples, pecans and caramel on top. I don't like anything too sweet, so I went easy on the caramel and found it to be just perfect. Thanks for sharing, I'll be making this one again!

Wonderful light-tasting cheesecake. After reading several reviews saying they skipped the topping, I decided to mix the caramel syrup in with the apple topping as well as added a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Put all the apples in a 9" springform with a self-made cinnamon graham cracker crust.  To serve, I just drizzled a bit of the caramel syrup over the top.

The richest, most decadent apple dessert I've ever had the pleasure of sampling. This comes together quickly and easily with ingredients common to most pantrys - one day I'd like to make my own crust and caramel sauce, but using the store-brought items doesn't compromise the flavor one bit. I didn't add any cinnamon but did at least double the vanilla (a generous pour from the bottle), and wouldn't alter the flavor one bit. I also omitted the nuts - if I were to add some, I think I'd try peanuts to imitate a caramel apple. I might also try garnishing with fresh green Granny Smith apple slices one day. Thank you sooo much for submitting this recipe :)

This is a great tasting cheesecake.  I like more apple filling and more caramel drizzled on top.

I love making cheesecakes and this one was great! I love vanilla extract so for that distinct flavor I always use 2 teaspoon of vanilla. Only thing is that this cheesecake didn't hold up firm enough, also I am not a big nut fan so I just didn't use any. Also big tip here I learned; if you want your cheesecake to come out without any cracks then bake for 10 minutes at 400 degrees then for 45 to 60 minutes at 200 degrees and leave in the oven without opening it for at least 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Refrigerate for 3 hours or more after.

Awesome! I loved this cake! I couldn't find pecans so I substituted walnuts which still did the trick! I also used a mixture of apple pie filling and apples that I peeled myself (I had some that would have gone bad otherwise). I also didn't have an apple pie crust so I used butter cookies with melted butter and pressed them into a cake tin for the base of this delicious cake! Mmmmm mmmm good! :)

This was sooo delicious! I am not a cheesecake person but this recipe has changed my mind. I made it as Father's Day gift and I believe I ate more than he did! Making a cheesecake from scratch makes you feel like a gourmet chef! This will be shared among family and friends for sure!

Ever since i started baking this has only been the 3rd cheesecake recipe i have used. And might i say that is the BEST!! I love the texture and the taste. Sofar i have made this 3 times. Twice with apples like in recipe and once with cherry pie filling. I think i prefer the apples :) I just brought the ingredients again and will be making another one soon. It's sooo addictive :)

Yummy. 
Works well with No Sugar Added Apple Pie mix and Splenda (cut amount of sugar in half) for Diabetics.

Cheesecake portion was a bit creamy rather than fluffy for me. But everyone loved it so I can't complain.

Tasted wonderful and very easy to make. I made my own crust and baked the cheesecake in a 9 inch springform pan. It turned out great and got great reviews from my guests. I also froze mine for a few hours so that I could cut it easier. Then cut it with a hot wet knife.

The cheesecake was delicious! Used cinnamon graham cracker crust and added cinnamon and nutmeg to apple filling and caramel sauce. I let sit in oven after baking time for half an hour without the oven on to make sure the center set.

This was my first attempt at a cheesecake and everyone was impressed.  I added more vanilla than called for in the recipe.  I also included cinnamon in the cheesecake filling and used a shortbread crust.  It was yummy!

Look's like a winner, with the changes I made anyway.  I changed the recipe a lot.  Used my own canned apple pie filling, added lemon juice and more vanilla to cream cheese batter, topped the cheesecake with a streusel topping and did not use saved filling or caramel or pecans on top.  I will make in a springform pan next time.

I tried this recipe and thought it was tasty and easy. I brought it to a function, all women, everyone wanted the recipe. I did change the look from the picture. I arranged apple slices around the outside of the pie in a circle and placed whole pecans next to each slice on the inside. I then poured the rest of the caramel and apples in the center and sprinkled chopped pecans on top. Looked good. Will make this recipe again.

I made this for my mom's birthday because my sisters birthday is a few days before and we were done with cake.  I added 1 1/4tbs vanilla and 1tsb cinnamon to the filling and the texture was perfect.  I also like to make my own crust and I used the cinnamon graham crackers and that made a huge difference!  I also left it in the fridge for about 4 hours and it was completely set!  Great recipe!!

Great recipe, very simple and easy to make. The instructions are well done. I did my own base instead of a pre-made crust. I also used brown sugar when mixing the graham crackers for the base. Extremely tasty and I would make it again everyone loved it.

this was great!!...  my guests loved it!...  i'd suggest using a 10" crust - the 9" didn't seem quite large enough to me (the filling went out to the edges)...  took a bit longer to cook than the recipe called for, but maybe because i live at 6,000+ feet?...

I made 1 1/2 the filling & put in a 9" springform pan. Instead of using can pie filling. I peeled & chopped 3 apples, stirred in a generous 1/2 cup Marzetti Caramel Apple dip, put in pan & cooked about 6-8 minutes, stirring several times until apples were tender, spooned over cooled cheesecake.

Followed the recipe expect for the canned apple pie filling.  Never had such a thing in the house and never will.  Just cooked and thickened some sliced apples.  Delicious!  Only problem with the cheesecake - it does not last.  Gets devoured really quickly.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was good. I made some tweaks, some due to not reading the recipe correctly (mixed the apples in with the cheesecake filling) and some due to ingredient issues (swapped honey for sugar in equal parts) but it still worked. I made it for the first Thanksgiving with my in-laws and my mother-in-law would not let me take it home. Guess it was a hit!

I made this for as a birthday cake for a co-worker.  She likes apple pie, anything with caramel, and cheesecakes so I figured I'd hit them all at once.  I made it in a 9" springform pan and fixed my own graham cracker crust.  I also put a layer of caramel on the bottom, then the apple pie filling then the cheesecake filling.  After it cooled I arranged the rest of the apple/caramel mix on top and let the caramel sort of pool on top to make an all-over cover.  Finally putting pecan halves around the edges and crushed pecans in the middle.  Everyone loved it.  They said they liked it better than traditional apple pie.  I didn't get to eat any, but I'll make one for Thanksgiving since it was so well received.

Made this as a twist on the typical Apple dessert for Thanksgiving.  It turned out perfect, though a slightly longer cooking time to set up.  My mom and dad loved it and asked for the recipe!

This recipe was an instant success! I added a little caramel sauce on the crust, before I added the filling just to add a little more sweetness. I have to make two of these everytime!

Easy to make and delicious! I used 1/3 less fat philly cheese and a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla instead of 1/4 teaspoon. I suggest refrigerating it over night to allow it to set and the flavors to blend.

I found this initially on the food network website, as a Paula Deen recipe.  I have always wanted to try one of her dishes, so this was it.  Amazing!  So so good... and so easy.  I didn't change a single thing.  Everyone loved it because it was a combination of cheesecake and apple pie.

This is a very easy to prepare, delicious cheesecake.  I made the filling as written, but made my own graham cracker crust instead of buying a pre-made one.  Will definitely be making this one again.

Awesome cheesecake!  Very simple.  Great combo of my favorite dessert (cheesecake) and my husband's (apple pie).  I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the apple pie filling.  To the cheesecake filling, I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp allspice, and changed the vanilla to 1 tsp.

Great recipe. After reading some of the reviews I added pumpking puree,increased the sugar to 3/4 cup and  added pumpking pie spice to the cream cheese recipe. Also added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the apple pie filling. My fiancee loved it, even without the caramel topping. I preferred mine with the caramel. Thanks for posting this recipe

Good recipie!  It was quick and easy to use.  Like many others I didn't use the remaining apples, to decorate the top. But the caramel and that cheesecake blended nicely to make a beuatiful presentation.
I will do this one again, using some of the recommendations.
