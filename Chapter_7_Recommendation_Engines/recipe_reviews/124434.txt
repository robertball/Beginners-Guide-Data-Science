I loved this recipe! I did make one change though which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I added a 1/4 tsp of almond extract and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.

I try to reserve five star reviews for recipes that I think are worthy - recipes that go above and beyond the call of duty - recipes that are more than just tasty.  This recipe gets 5 stars.  Here's why.     Last night the children hosted a  sleepover.......EEK!  Tired, crabby, and distraught that my coffee pot picked this morning to walk off the job, I was unprepared for the billion, "I'm hungry!" and "What's for breakfast?" 's that a room full of crazy kids would bring to my morning.  Desperate, I turned to allrecpies and typed in the words, Easy and pancake. This is what I found.    Throwing caution into the wind, I doubled the recipe and baked it in a glass lasagna pan.  I decided, while it baked, sipping on tea, there's no way this recipe is going to be good.  It can't be. Nothing good could be this easy.  It came out like a big rectangular version of the photo.  A hearty sprinkle of powdered sugar, I sliced it into large squares giving each child a nice chunk of the crusty edge and served it up with fresh berries, milk, and flavored syrups to drizzle.  I'm thrilled to report it received rave reviews from all of my critics and a whopping 12 thumbs up!  Thank you, Aunt Edith, for saving the day.  I can hardly wait to try this very easy and impressive recipe on our next camping trip in a dutch oven!

This turned out great.  My grandpa used to make us pancakes like this but he first fried apples with butter, cinnamon and sugar then poured the pancake batter on top, baked it and served it with sour cream.  I made this version for Christmas morning and it was just the way we remembered it.

This is a great version of a German pancake! I make it almost every weekend. It is delicious as is, but for a variation, I add 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon. Fantastic!

We really liked this. My husband has diabetes so I used WW Pastry Flour. I had some frozen strawberries that needed to be used so I chopped some up small. I also added pecans and a few dried cranberries. Turned the heat down sooner, because my house was getting smelly. Served it with Sugar Free Homemade Whipped Cream and some oven baked bacon. It was a delightful breakfast, thanks!

Great pancakes! I doubled the recipe and we made 2 of them for 3 people, and they turned out just like the picture...and were deilcious! We used a spoonful of homemade choke cherry jam as a dip - Yummy! I can see that this recipe is going to lend itself to all sorts of wondermous dishes! I have a nephew visiting that has never cracked an egg in his life and supervised as he made them for us. It was super easy and gave him quite a smile of pride for having made such a tasty and fancy-looking breakfast! Thanks!

I use these ingredients in the exact amounts listed, but put the pancake together a bit differently.  I turn the oven to 400 and put the pat of butter in an 8 by 8 square baking pan and stick it in the oven while I make the batter.  By the time I'm finished with the batter, the butter has melted and I tilt the pan so the butter coats the dish, then pour in the batter and put the pan back in the 400 degree oven.  It's finished baking after 10-15 minutes.  We prefer fruit syrup, maple syrup and cinnamon sugar to the powdered sugar and lemon juice.  Very yummy and super fast and easy!

I've made many of this type of pancake and never enjoyed them. THIS recipe is the one that I discovered and stuck with! Easy as can be, very eggy tasting which is what we love! I don't need to search for any other Puff Pancake recipe after using this one from Aunt Edith. :)

Thank you so much for posting this recipe!  It is a lifesaver for me!  I am gluten sensitive and baking powder and yeast sensitive.  I have missed pancakes for a very long time, but not anymore thanks to you!  I substitute brown rice flour for the wheat flour and I use water instead of milk.  It is so tasty and satisfying.  I eat it practically every day for breakfast.  Thank you!

I was surprised at just how good this recipe turned out to be.  I added some cinnamon and nutmeg.  Honestly, this recipe seems too quick and easy to be this good.

"German pancake" as it was called in my family... though the measurements are a bit different, the basic recipe is the same... I usually add a bit of fresh lemon zest and a little nutmeg to the batter. Gramma would melt the butter in a pie plate in the oven then pour in the batter. Bake till it was puffy and golden. Dust with powdered sugar and squeeze on the fresh lemon juice!!!

Really good, reminds me of yorkshire pudding. Mine didn't puff up as nicely as the picture, but it may be because the oven wasn't hot enough when I put the pan in.

This was the first time I tried something like this.  I could not believe how easy it was to make.  I made the large lasagna pan version for family.  I added a bit of vanilla extract and a bit of sugar.  Everyone loved it.  They couldn't get enough!  Needless to say, there was nothing left!

It just tastes like eggs, and who wants powdered sugar on their eggs? Maybe it would be better as a savory dish with sausage in it or maybe cheese? At least I didn't go to a lot of trouble and the clean up was easy. One bowl, one measuring cup, one pan, cheap ingredients, I had to try it.

I was so sick of frozen waffles and traditional pancakes, so I tried this easy recipe. I slid it onto a big plate, cleaned off the center of the kitchen table, and we tore off big chunks and put on our plates to drizzled with maple syrup. Very delicious and one of my favorite new recipes to make. Thanks!

Yummy!! I added 1 tsp of vanilla and it turned out fantastic!! I can't cook regular pancakes so this is definitely perfect for me!! And there's plenty of ways to dress it up. I am going to try Strawberry Preserves on it and maple syrup for my kids!! I know they will enjoy eating "The Big Pancake!" Thanks for posting!!

Very, very good! These taste just like the German pancakes at my favorite restaurant. My kids went nuts over them. Thanks for a great recipe! I put butter and lemon juice on them, and then sprinkle them liberally with powdered sugar. SO good!

This was great, I added vanilla and cinnamon and some brown sugar. I melted the butter (well, I used margarine) in the skillet first instead of rubbing it. It tasted like french toasted. The only complaint I have is that the margarine made the outside a little salty for my liking but my bf loved it!

I loved this recipe. I was looking for a simple pancake mix when I ran across this recipe. It was so easy and was yummy. I served it with sliced bananas and turkey bacon. My son said it reminded him of crepes and the next time I make it, I should bake it then slice it so I could wrap strawberries, bananas and whip cream it it and serve it like crepes. I just might try that the next time. Great recipe - thank you!

My kids absolutely loved this.  I made 2 and in 1 I added apple pie filling on the bottom 1/3 Cup and cinnamon sugar. Then poured the batter on top.  Just delicious both ways.

This is the breakfast my grandson always requests for his birthday brunch.   He wants a whole one for himself - and we top it with toasted walnuts or pecans, along with sliced bananas and maple syrup (like bananas foster) or with fried apples - and either powdered sugar or whipped cream.   Love it with bacon or sausage, making an easy, delicious and impressive brunch.   There are many versions of this recipe, which we also know as a German pancake, or a Zeider Zee!    This is the easiest of all the recipes I've tried for this fun pancake.

I have made this many times. It is one of my favorite go-to breakfast foods. I usually add a little brown sugar and vanilla. Today I added some frozen blueberries into the batter and we will be seeing how that turns out.

Nice texture...very light...I think beating the egg mixture till it's thin is very important in getting that "fluffiness" effect.  Great recipe!

Simple, used ingredients I always have on hand, and this cooked while I was getting ready for the day. It's nice to find a breakfast meal that does not require constant attention in the kitchen while it's cooking (thus freeing my rushed early morning time up for other things). I didn't much like this though as it was really bland and just tasted like plain eggs and flour. It needed something but I couldn't figure out what. The lemon helped make it palatable but only barely so. I didn't even finish my portion. It sure did turn out pretty though and rose up so beautifully and had a nice light golden color on the top. I used a pyrex pie pan and my toaster oven and this worked out great. Thanks for the recipe, I think it is something that others would like I just don't care for the boring egg taste and I doubt Tabasco or salsa will go with this as is my usual topping for eggs.

Great delicious and easy recipe! I used half egg and half egg beaters and added cinnamon and vanilla extract. I also used Silk Soy Vanilla light milk instead of regular milk and it turned out great. Thanks!

Fabulous--that you have posted this recipe. I have made this for years--and it is just great.  I love the
posting about grandpa  cooking apple slices first--then 
pouring batter over them.  In the original recipe I used 
sauteed apples were served on the side, along with any other cooked fruit.  To that I say--feel free to 
put a jar of jam in a sauce pan and cook 5 min. and serve this hot on the side.
Also had this dish in Austria, served at a fair. The pan used to make it was cast iron of about 35 inches wide. The giant pancake was cut up into chunks, and
served with fruit.  The name was:KAISERSCHMARM.
    The only thing I can add is: 
1) have a shaker of powdered sugar on hand.
2) Put another in the oven as soon as the first comes out.  Unless you have 2 10 inch cast iron skillets. In which case cook 2 of these at the same time.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I found it a tad dry and I'm not sure why. I put a tsp of vanilla in my batter. I baked this in my cast iron skillet and when it came out I spread a layer of melted butter and powdered sugar on it to make an "icing".

This was a quick cheap tasty breakfast. We poured syrup on ours'. My kids loved it. I thought it needed bacon to make it even better and more a complete breakfast.

This was so delicious and very easy to make! I left out the powder sugar and lemon and used the traditional butter and syrup....tasted just like french toast! I've made it now three times and I can't get enough of it! Excellent way to get kids to eat their eggs!

This is an excellent recipe. I first had basked pancakes at an area bed and breakfast. It was so delicious. I started looking for a similar recipe and stumbled upon this one. It is fantastic!

I followed the recipe exactly! I have made this several times now, and I make this one for me and a slight variation for my husband, stirring in diced sausage, bacon and cheese to the batter for his as a savory one.

I make an apple cider (or juice) syrup with this, as it goes beautifully with it.

Note: I do add cinnamon and 1t. madagascar vanilla to it the batter.

I will certainly be doubling the recipe next time.  I am always looking for something different to give our 3 boys for breakfast (ages 6,4,and 3) and this looked like my favorite german pancake from a pancake house that we used to go to. Boys loved it, but mommy and daddy only got a small taste :( was exactly like I thought it would be though, thank you!!

Aunt Edith knows her pancakes!!!!  I fried sausage links, then sauteed them with apple, cherries, and a little green onion.  Topped the pancake with above mix and a little maple syrup.  Good stuff.  I'll probably only use half the salt next time.

Beautiful!! It came out exactly as the picture. Reminds me of swedish pancakes. One was enough for my husband and I. This is not the "heavy sink in your stomach wish i wouldn't of eaten that" kind of pancake. Yet filling. I made "buttermilk syrup" recipe from this site and that also was yummy. Served with bacon and fruit. Very easy to put together--5 ings--stir--watch it closely as it does foam up. I kept wisking and had to turn heat down a bit, I used a 3 quart pan and it was just right. I'll make this again and again.

I have made this twice, and love it!  It is a great thing to make when you don't feel like flipping pancakes.  
I haven't had fresh lemon with it yet, (I used just a sprinkle of RealLemon) but I am sure that would make it even better!

Thank you Aunt Edith! We really enjoy this for breakfast.  It couldn't be easier to make. I've added berries, sliced bananas and chocolate chips on different occasions.  Its just as good plain too!

So yummy!  I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and sprinkled cinnamon in the mix... My only negative comment is that there's no way this feeds 4!  My family (2 toddlers and 2 adults) finished this off in no time, then I had to supplement with toast.  :0)

Did what another reviewer suggested, put a pat of butter in oven while it warmed to 400 degrees. Also used a 8x8 glass pan.  Used regular pancake mix, which called for 1 egg, and 1 1/3 c. water, znd zdded tsp. pumpkin mix for sn sdded healthy benefit.  Lastly added a few chocolate chips to make it more of a dessert.  You can vary this recipe with whatever ingreients you have.  Thanks!

This was my favorite bkfst served at Potter Elementary School in Tampa, FL. I've been looking for the recipe for years because they don't use the same recipe any more. This is the closest. I add Alaga  Syrup over the top and I add butter into the batter. It's so yummy.

I can't decide between 3 and 4 stars.  This was was pretty good, and I think I'll make it again, with some changes.  I added 1 t. baking powder, 1 T sugar, and 1 sliced banana.  My 3 year old loves pancakes, so I made this for him one night when I didn't have time for the real deal.  It is eggy, and not as fluffy as regular pancakes, but you can't beat it for simplicity.  3 year old was very impressed with the Big Pancake, naturally.

I have been making this for 40 years! For a change, after it's baked, try sprinkling it with some fresh lemon juice, then spreading orange marmalade on it and lastly sprinkle with confectionary sugar.  Yum-m-m.  It's REALLY great, when I use my homemade strawberry or raspberry jam in place of the marmalade. . . . . .THE BEST!!!

I thought this was pretty gross. My husband said it wasn't bad if it was smothered in syrup or something. I followed the recipe exactly and it did look cool like the picture. I didn't put the full amount of salt in and it was still WAY too salty. Much too oily for my taste too.

This is going to be a regular in our home.  I made 2 pans to feed all of us, and hubby still wanted more.  Tasted like french toast.  Very easy as well!  We had ours with powderedd sugar and syrup - perfect.

Tried German Pancake with buttermilk sauce & it turns out with adding more butter (as I did before reading this one), it's about the same as Aunt Edith's.  :o  'Think I"ll try adding a little baking powder as someone suggested in the reviews here.  Double recipe: 1c warmed milk, 6eggs, 1/2c melted butter, 1c flour, 1t salt, 2t baking powder, 2T sugar, 1t vanilla. After trying: More cake-y than German Pancake with buttermilk sauce thanks to the baking powder.  'Think I like it less cake-y though.  But, I did mess up the oven temp.  I will try again.  Regardless, 1t salt is too much for a double recipe.
