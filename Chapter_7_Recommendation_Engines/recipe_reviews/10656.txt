I did not roll out these cookies....I skipped the kneading on the floured surface completely as I wanted an easy cookie to make.  I used a 1 tablespoon scoop, and scooped the dough so that it would be quicker.  The cookies were baked approximately 12 minutes, then I let them sit for 2 minutes on the cookie sheet before removing.  They tasted like slightly richer shortbread cookies, with a hint of sweetness.  I substituted raising for currants and omitted the carraway as they were for DH's office potluck and I thought many would prefer without.  His coworkers ate them all up...and sadly I only had one cookie myself to test them after they came out of the oven.  Everyone loved them.

I made this recipe for St. Pat's Day.  I did not roll it out, but dropped the batter onto parchment paper-lined pans in half-tablespoon dollops, about two inches apart, and baked for thirteen minutes.  They came out heavenly!  The caraway gives them an unusual and delicious flavor and they are not too sweet.  Thanks so much for a great new tradition!

I just made a test batch of these to see if I wanted to bring them for a holiday cookie Swap. I will definitely be making these!To make them more christmasy I used Craisins (and chopped them up to make it easier when cutting out shapes)instead of currants and I left out the caraway seeds (didn't miss them a bit!)For my cookie swap batch I Plan to use holiday cookie cutter shapes. I'm already planning to make these for my daughters class at school for St. Patricks day and using a shamrock cookie cutter. Definitely my new favorite cookie recipe!!! Excellent!

Delicious! Definitely sweet enough. And you're missing out if you  leave out the caraway! That makes it different and adds an exotic flavor. I, too, added more currants to my 2nd batch; more caraway, too! Give them a try.

Fantastic recipe!  I left out the caraway seeds, used raisins in place of the currants and I dusted the finished cookies with confectioners sugar before serving.  My customers were skeptical at first, but once they sampled a cookie my entire double batch was gone in less than 10 minutes!!!

Wow, these are fantastic! We made them without the currants or seeds 'cause we're not big fan of "stuff" (other than chocolate) in our cookies. I did have to add a little more buttermilk too, to get the dough to a rolling consistency. They turned out so great -- I like them unfrosted but of course my kids must frost and sprinkle every cookie they have a hand in making! ;) Thanks for the recipe!

This was such an easy recipe, and the cookies came out great!  I used dried cranberries instead of currants, which turned out well.  I also needed to use closer to 1/2 cup of buttermilk to get the dough to the right consistency.

cookie was good, more cake-like texture than I was expecting.  Easy to make except when cutting into triangles, was difficult to cut through the currants.  They went over well at my St. Patrick's day party.

I will definitely make these again. They had just the right amount of sweetness. I didn't add the caraway seeds, not too fond of them myself, but they turned out great anyway. They were just as easy to make as rolled out Christmas cookies, with no chilling involved. They were a hit at the St. Patty's Day party I brought them to. Thanks Laria!

I made these cookies as something a little different for our potluck at work. I rolled & cut with my shamrock cookie cutter and sprinkled with a little green decorator's sugar. They looked very cute, but how would they taste? Having made soda bread only once before with disasterous results, I was a little wary. But, much to my pleasure, these are SO good! Sort of like a sweet biscuit. I will make these again over & over...not just for St. Pat's, either! Easy, light and tasty! Oh, and do not skip the currants or caraway seed...very tradtional.

I was a little skeptical about trying to do anything other than the traditional Irish soda bread, but after all of the positive reviews, I just had to test this recipe out.  These were delicious!  I also did not roll them out (feeling a little too lazy, I guess!), but I rolled them into balls.  The result was that they looked like mini Irish soda bread loaves, because they pretty much held the rounded shape!

This is an excellent recipe. For me, these did not turn out like cookies but rather like a biscuit but that's OK because they taste so good. I did not like the taste of the caraway in the cookie. Next time I would leave that out. I don't think it belonged. This is easy to roll out if you just sprinkle it liberally with flour. Also, at the end mix it with your hands. I make my own buttermilk. Just add a bit of lemon juice or vinegar (like a teaspoon) and add enough milk to make 1/4 cup. Also, make sure these sit overnight. They'll taste better the next day. Also, I used plain ole raisins in place of currants. Excellent and loved by all. Thanks for sharing.

What a unique concept! Easy to make.  If you manage to keep them around for more than a day, they taste even better.  I pride myself on being a cookie lover, and this is now one of my favorites.  Can't wait to make them as gifts for family and friends.  Used various cookie cutters instead of triangles and squares.  This recipe would be wasted to use only for Saint Patrick's Day.  Thanks much.

Did the recipe exactly as instructed. Rolled them out and cut in a four leaf clover for an Irish funeral I was attending. They baked on sil pads in a gas oven for 11 minutes, middle oven and turned out perfectly. I made a very light icing and sprinkled green sprinkles on them. Not one cookie left, made 26 cut out cookies.

Great version of Irish Soda Bread...the sweet kind, made into a cookie!  Took them to a St. Patty's party and I turned around and they were gone!  I'm making them again to have some at home!

Very good cookie.  Didn't change a thing.  I beg to differ with the reviewer who said this has a "hint" of sweetness.  With 3/4 cup of sugar it's quite a bit sweeter than soda bread.  If you have to bake this in batches, be sure to divide and chill dough well wrapped in plastic wrap.  It's a little difficult to cut these with the currants, so next time I may try the cookie scoop method and flatten them slightly.  Thanks for the idea.  Thanks for the recipe.

These were OK but I would prefer just making plain old Irish soda bread.  In fact it is less work to make the bread instead of the cookies.

Was looking for something to bring to work on St. Patrick's Day and these seemed like a convenient alternative to the traditional bread.  I enjoy the flavor of caraway but not the texture of the seeds so I ground up before adding.  I rolled out the dough and used a cookie cutter; re-rolling the scraps to produce more cuts each time.  I baked for only 12 minutes until lightly toasted on the bottom.  The cookies came out soft and subtly sweet.  I'm sure the office will enjoy tomorrow : )

Tasty, especially with the hint of caraway.  Caraway is a new flavor for many people and a good accent to the currants.  I doubled the number of currants and would love to have had even more!

I wasn't sure how these cookies would go over with the caraway seeds in them.  The flavor they add is just a hint and they've been a big hit at home and work. The children especially like them.  This is another keeper.

These are awesome!  I did a trial baking of them tonight to see if they would be good for a party we're throwing on St. Patrick's Day and they will definitely be served.  

I skipped the caraway seeds because I was going for authenticity. 

I used a shamrock cookie cutter that was a little under 3 inches in both directions and and got 30 cookies out of one batch.  Boyfriend doesn't like currants so I mixed up the batter with none, split it in half and added currants to one of the halves.

Both varieties turned out great!  The currant cookies are slightly sweeter but you can't really feel the texture of the currants. Boyfriend tried a piece of one and was surprised that he liked them as much as he liked the plain cookies.  

Also, I wasn't sure if I should grease the cookie sheets.  I decided not to and the cookies were fine.

Excellent recipe!  I accidentally added too much buttermilk and kept kneading in flour to soak it up and switched raisins for currants and they still came out great!   Will definitely be breaking this one out again.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I have been making these cookies for the past 7 years.  I follow the directions as written. When I was still teaching, I would makes these for my class when we studied Ireland and the children loved them.  My whole family always looks forward to St. Patrick's Day, because they know I will be bringing the soda bread cookies to our festivities.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have not had these in years and a few weeks ago my daughter had chosen Ireland for international day! I didn't want to bring traditional food my grandmother made, so I was reminded of these cookies that my great grandmother made.  I came across this recipe which is similar....actually better....then the old family recipe!  Since I live in the middle of no mans land, I can't get currants.  So I used dried cranberries like someone else mentioned!  I also just made them drop cookies instead of rolling them out, as I never seen them done that way.  Normally these cookies you would drop a spoonful then use a spoon to make a dimple then add a fruit preserve.....which I always hated!  So that makes this recipe awesome and simple! I recommend this to anyone....even if they don't know or like caraway seeds....it adds to the cookie and you won't even know they are there.

Absolutely fabulous!  These taste incredibly close to my Grandma's soda bread recipe that I can't find (she passed away this past summer)!  I spread these out into a bar cookie since it was said that it is similar to a shortbread recipe - perfect!

These were great and very simple to make.  I used a large cutting board to knead the dough. I didn't roll it - just pressed it out about 1/4 " and used a pizza cutter to make triangles.    The only changes I made were to substitute raisins (because I forgot to buy currants) and I used a heaping teaspoon of caraway.  Definitely use the caraway!

I thought these would be okay as an addition to my st patty's day meal, but ended up really liking them! I left out the caraway seeds, topping half of the cookies with them before baking and I used a mix of golden raisins and cranberries.

This was excellent!  I doubled the recipe and used NO caraway. I also used raisins instead of currants because it was for my sons 3rd grade class.  They were a lot sweeter than I expeced and if they were for an older crowd I would cut down on the sugar a little.  It was almost like a thicker sugar cookie. I also used green sugar crystals for the top before cooking just as added flair for the kids!
I would definately make these again!

Excellent recipe. I used golden raisens in place of the currants and anise seed in place of the caraway seeds.To roll the dough easier I put dough in refrigator for 2 hrs.

Not a very sweet cookie. These taste best the next day when the caraway "mellows" a little.  Would be awesome with anise seed in place of caraway.  Perfect with a cup of hot tea.

I omitted the currants and caraway seed, and instead of rolling out the dough, I made teaspoon-ful drop cookies, and flattened them out with my hand. (Also needed to use about 1/3 a cup of milk, not 1/4 as the recipe calls for.) My family ate them up last night and I will be making another batch tonight! THANK YOU for such a wonderful recipe! I'd give it 6 stars if I could.

A lovely take off on Irish soda bread. While it is far from traditional it is a lovely sweet treat to enjoy with coffee or tea. If you want more currents add them but I liked it the way it was. A very unique idea for a forgoten favorite. Cheers

These cookies were GREAT!!!!! My 2 year old and my husband finished them all the same day. They were so good I even brought them to my In-Laws !! The reciepe was so easy. I rolled them into 1/2 balls and then flattened them with my palm, since they don't spread like other cookies. I also added golden raisins WOW! THIS IS NOW A NEW FAMILY FAVORITE!!! We will make them again and again. What a great twist on traditional soda bread ! Bravo!

Followed the recipe exactly and they are perfection. They are like sweet little versions of the soda bread.  I made these for B&B guests coming in and I don't think there will be any left by the time they arrive.  So nice to offer guests around St. Patty's day.

Really good cookies! They are just sweet enough not over the top sweet like most cookies.  We like crunchy cookies so I let the cookies cool for about 10-15 minutes and then bake them again for 10 more minutes.  That way they stay crunchy.

I'm tossing all my other soda bread recipes -- this one is awesome!  Start to finish in an hour, and they are delicious!  Easy to serve as well.  I must have made them thicker, because I only got about 20 -- but they were perfect.

I just sampled some right out of the oven, and they're delicious! So easy to make. Did not add caraway seeds, but did add Craisins to half the batter. I can see adding other dried fruits, like apricots, as well. I cut back on the sugar a bit (which I usually do). Instead of rolling/cutting, I just dropped by tablespoons onto sheets lightly sprayed with cooking spray. Baked 11 min and let rest for 5 min on sheets; they pretty much held their shape and are almost biscuit-like. A light glaze would be nice, too. Thanks for the recipe, Laria! I'll enjoy them this St Patty's Day weekend! UPDATE 3/14/18: Drizzled a glaze of confect sugar, vanilla and milk and topped with green sprinkles. I like it better with the glaze, since the cookies aren't all that sweet.

Enjoy a different cookie taste thanks to the caraway seeds.  Not too sweet. Mine baked quicker than the 12-14 minutes - closer to 8 minutes.

YUM! I needed a dessert to bring to a St. Pat's day themed luncheon. I didn't really think I'd like these, but I gave them a shot and scaled the recipe down to make a dozen as a tester batch. I'm so glad I did! I had to sub raisins for currants, but the recipe is very forgiving. Even though I had to guesstimate a third of an egg, etc., they came out great. The caraway seed gives an interesting twist of flavor that plays against the raisins very well. As many others suggested, I rolled them into balls, flattened them, and scored an "X" into them before baking. Scrumptious and so pretty! Thanks so much for sharing.

I don't usually care that much for cookies, but I just finished making these and I can honestly say I LOVE them!  I have never had such a cake-like cookie (which is probably why I love them).  I used raisins (which I soaked in hot water for 10 minutes before adding to the batter to make them extra plump) instead of currants and I made half without seeds and half with anise seeds (the store was out of caraway seeds). I prefer them without seeds, but my husband prefers them with seeds (it has a slight black licorice after taste with the seeds). I also rolled balls and flattened them on the baking sheet. Delicious!

Very good cookies, not too sweet. I made a few adjustments:

I prepared these as drop cookies so I doubled the batch. Doubling made 5.5 dozen, if I had formed them more uniformly they would have made 6 dozen.

I substituted raisins for currants. I used regular milk with a splash of vinegar instead of butter milk. I had to add an extra 1/4 cup of milk to the batter. I skipped the caraway since these are going to a kid's classroom.

The cookies were easy to prepare and baked up beautifully! Next time I want to try sultanas or dried cranberries and add a pinch more sugar.

Delicious - raisens make them perfect, and I added a little green food coloring for extra pizazz!  I also used ground anise seed instead of the spices they suggested because that is what I had on hand, and it was perfect.

These cookies tasted great! I used raisins instead of currants and placed the dough in dollops onto a cookie sheet instead of kneading and rolling it out. The only thing I would change is adding more raisins and caraway seeds next time.

Very tasty! I tried this recipe out to test it as I am thinking about making these for St Patty's Day - they turned out great! I didn't use currants or caraway (didn't have them on hand) and since I am planning to bring them in to my daughters kindergarten class I added mini choc chips bits (chopped them up a little) and sprinkled the tops with green sugar. I used my shamrock cutter - so cute & they are delicious! The kids will really like the choc chip bits & sugar sprinkles, but I would like to try making these the traditional way next time, I am sure that would be great as well, for the grown ups. :)

Though it wasn't love at first bite, I quite enjoy these.  Easy to make, but definitely an acquired taste.  My wife loves them.  My coworkers hate them.  They're definitely of the savory-dessert-variety, not sweet at all, and very bold flavored.

Great recipe.  Sweet cookies...I replaced 1 cup all-purpose flour with 1 cup wheat flour and added 1/3 cup raisins with the currants.  I left out the caraway seeds since this is going to my daughter's preschool class for snack.  I also left out the kneading and rolling as Christy7795 did and used a cookie scoop.  Very good warm.

I really like this cooky. I made these for ethnic food day at my son's school.  I made half the batch without currants, as he thought kids wouldn't like them.  I took the leftovers to work and they vanished.  
I would like to try this cooky dough with other things - walnuts and candied ginger, etc.  I love that it is not too sweet, just a nice treat.

Great cookie.  It was a bit "cakelike" for me which is why I didn't rate it at five stars.  Next time I will use a bit more caraway, I guess I like that taste a bit more than the average person.

I halved the recipe just to see how the cookies would turn out. It calls for 1/2 beaten egg so I decided to use 1 small egg. After adding 1 TBS milk, the batter was way too lumpy. I didn't add more milk worrying that otherwise it wouldn't make a dough at all. So I added more flour while kneading until it turned a soft dough, then proceed with the rest of the recipe. The result was good! They taste classy, soft and not too sweet. Caraway seeds must not be omitted.

These cookies have the great taste of soda bread but a little bit sweeter (which is nice).  I skipped the caraway and I just dropped the cookies on the baking sheet instead of rolling out and cutting them.  They turned out just fine and saved a lot of time.

I am 14 years old and made this recipe with my mom for St. Patrick's day. Seeing how it had gotten great reviews, I expected it to be, well, great. I'm sorry, but it wasn't as good as I first thought it would be. For one, it was much too sweet. Also, there weren't enough raisins. We doubled the raisins to 1 cup and there still weren't enough. These were okay, although I have tasted much better....

I have been making these cookies for years and now everyone looks for them each St. Patrick's Day.  A few months ago, I found out I have Celiac disease.  After making 3 batches of this for everyone else (schools, work, family, etc!) I just tried a gluten free version.  I substituted the flour with gluten-free all purpose flour, added 1/2 tsp of xanthan gum and followed the rest of the recipe as I always do (raisins, 1/2 cup buttermilk, no caraway seeds, dropped on cookie sheet).  I needed to bake the gluten free cookies about 16-17 minutes, as opposed to 12 for the regular batch.  They're still more cake-like and less like a cookie (but they are still warm so they may just need some time).  It's not EXACT but it is very, very close to these cookies!  I'm still learning about baking with different gluten free flours and will post an update as I tweak this recipe going forward.  So far I am so happy to be able to enjoy these gluten free!

Will keep for every St. Patrick's Day. This recipe was easy to make and tasty. I followed the recipe exactly except for rolling-cutting (I'm not great at rolled cookies, or pastry crust, etc.) so I just dropped them and flattened them a bit before baking. Tasty. The caraway seed was just right, but I might try more currants next time, or some orange zest. But they will be made again!!

Delicious, delicate cookie.  I treated like thumbprints and topped with half a maraschino cherry, and some with aprioct jam.  These have less butter and more flavor than the other thumbprints I have made in the past.   I made them without the caraway and currants, but intend to try them with those as well.

These are always a hit and great to bring to cultural events.  I love adding caraway seeds, but a lot of people don't like them so i usually don't include them.  I also use craisins instead of currants.  I always manage to have craisins on hand!  I always get great reviews on these every time i make them for st. patricks day!

I made these for my St Patrick's day dessert and they were a huge hit.  We had no currants so I substituted golden raisins.  We also skipped the seeds for our first go round.  Even my youngest who will usually turn his nose up at any kind of a cookie containing raisins absolutely loved them!

I liked these, but I think I'm going to leave the caraway seeds out next time or put very few in.  It was a little too savory for my taste.  I used raisins since I couldn't find currants at the store, which I think is a good substitute.  The sticky dough was pretty hard to cut with a cookie cutter, I had to add a lot of flour to get it to roll out and keep the surface really floured in order to keep it from sticking.  But they did make very tasty cookies, a good shortbread-type.  I added green sugar to the top to make it a little extra festive and sweet.

I made this recipe this morning and thought the cookies were quite delicious. The cookies are sweeter than the Irish Bread I make, but I did not find them overly sweet as some suggested. 
I decide to use a round cookie cutter, but finding I did not have one, used the cover of a mason jar as my cutter.  Cookies were large (about 3 inches across) and therefore my yield was only 20 cookies. I had just a bit of dough left so rolled into a ball and scored with an X....because it started out as a ball the resulting cookie was dome-shaped like a miniature loaf of Irish Bread. I plan on trying this approach with my next batch of cookies. In my opinion a much better look. Overall a nice alternative to Irish Bread.

My dad was born and raised in Ireland and we've NEVER used caraway seeds in our Irish bread.  I made a batch of these cookies for work and they disappeared. Even the people who dont care for the bread loved the cookies. Im making at least a double batch for the parties over the next couple of days.  One thing i did was slightly score cookies with an "x". They look like miniature loaves of soda bread !

These cookies were delicious and very easy to make!  I made them for a pot luck at work and got rave reviews.  The cookies are more buttery and not sugary which is a definite plus.  The caraway seeds add a tiny bite of flavor which is a nice surprise.

I followed the directions almost exactly! They were delicious! I made if for some friends and they devoured it! I must admit that it is an acquired taste though. There were none left at the end of the party! I would definitely make it again and I wouldn't leave anything out! I had to add a lot more buttermilk, but other than that it was perfect!

Cookie Exchange today...these won the prize for the "tastiest", people said "this is what Christmas cookies should taste like". Made one recipe with currants and caraway seeds as well as one with cranberries. The currants and caraway seeds won the prize, although the cranberries were the favourite with the little children. Thank you very much for sharing your recipe, lots of smiling faces and happy tummies!!! =)

Made about 30, 2” cutouts. I made them as directed and was pleased by the soft, quickly rollable dough. I had been worried that the kneading - rolling - cutting would take a lot more time than drop cookies, but it hardly did. Even without chilling, the dough didn’t put up a sticky fight with my pin. I added the caraway seeds, they’re for a group of adults - for kids I might leave them out, but the dough would be bland without them. Next time, I might add a bit of grated orange rind to complement the caraway! A nicely unusual keeper for my recipe collection.

We love this recipe so much!! Thank you! I find it does need a bit more than 1/4c buttermilk, but that's easy.  They're so good! :)

I used my pizza wheel to cut these into triangles....easy peasy.  They're good.  The only changes I made were to use raisins instead of currants and a gave them an egg wash before baking then topping with green sugar.  Very sweet.

Tried these as an easy alternative to soda bread because I only have a toaster oven which is too small for soda bread baking. My husband loved them so much we had to make a second batch! He doesn't even like soda bread but he loves these! They turned out sweeter than the soda bread I've made in the past (when I had an oven) but that could be fixed with less sugar.

I LOVE this cookie recipe!!  I doubled the recipe and wasn't sorry for doing so!!  These cookies remind me of a scone but a little sweeter.  I made one change and that was the buttermilk.....I didn't have any so I just added 2 tsps. of white vinegar to a half cup of milk.  Everyone loves these cookies and want the recipe!!  Thanks for sharing Laria Tabul.  I am definitely making them again (doubling the recipe).

Used Trader Joe's European style yogurt (not to be healthy, as a buttermilk sub) & craisins, as my grocery had no currants ?? Went a little shy on sugar and did like drop biscuits. Delicious, works just fine for all us fake/half-assed Irish!

My husband does not like caraway so I left them out.  Currently looking for another spice that I can add.   Cookies were great for coffee but needed a little spice.  I will make these again once I found an additional spice ingredient.  Does anyone have a calorie count per cookie?

Tastes like soda bread in a sweet cookie.  Love it!  Made it for St. Patty's day one year but now I just make it any time I have some buttermilk on hand.  Even easier to make it you just scoop by rounded tablespoon onto cookie sheet and cook.  Might not be as pretty but certainly just as tasty!

I liked them as the recipe stated. But not sweet enough for kiddos. Used 1 1/4 cup sugar for them.

TOO sweet for me.  Next time I would maybe reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup.

Great cookies!! Made them for St. Patrick's day and added green food coloring! The caraway definitely was good. Maybe next time I'd use a little more even. These definitely are not really sweet cookies but are still very enjoyable and more so naturally sweet from the currants.

Just made these today for an early St. Pat's Day treat.  They were delicious, although I got 30 cookies (not 36) rolled by hand.  I added a little extra buttermilk, but then it got too sticky and I had to go back and add in some more flour.  Might have had to do with the fact that I was handling the dough by hand rather than using cookie cutters.  Also, subbed raisins for currants, because that's how my family has always made soda bread.

So good! Caraway makes these unique and is a must. I may cut back on the sugar next time as I thought they were a bit too sweet. Froze well too.

I made these for an after-school treat for my kids on St. Patrick's Day, and wondered if they'd like them or not with the caraway seeds in them.  They devoured them!  I was amazed and pleased, and made sure they saved some for Dad, who also enjoyed them. 

I used raisins and craisins (dried cranberries) in mine rather than currants, and dropped them on the sheet using my small Pampered Chef scoop.  Easy and tasty -- we'll definitely make this part of our tradition, along with corned beef and cabbage for dinner every March 17th.
