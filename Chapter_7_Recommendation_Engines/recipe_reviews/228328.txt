The batter definitely needs to rest for at least 5 minutes or you will have flat, thin pancakes.  I ate the first pancake and the flavor was like flour.  I added a little vanilla and cinnamon and the flavor was palatable.  We smothered them in homemade strawberry syrup (thank you Chef John!).  I was disappointed because I am trying spelt flour out on my family and was looking for some good recipes.  This was not one of them.  I'll try a different recipe next time.
