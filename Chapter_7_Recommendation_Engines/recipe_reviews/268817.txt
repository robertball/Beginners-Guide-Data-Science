This "Easy Vegan Polenta" is a good standard recipe for polenta. The garlic powder was a nice touch. I made mine smooth with my immersion blender, as always.  I made: (i) this exact recipe; and (ii) an adapted version of this recipe with: EVOO instead of margarine, minced hot pepper, and flecks of fresh rosemary in season. I liked the adapted version better.  Thank you chefcs for sharing your recipe.
