This was very good!  However, next time I'll use slightly less flour.  My "sauce" turned into an extremely thick paste which could not be poured over the salmon, it had to be spread on! Otherwise, the flavor was delicious!

Troy Kilborn, this was absolutely fabulous!! Since I was serving rice on the side, I doubled the sauce (except the flour, used only 1/3 cup), and added just a slight pinch of salt. The wonderful sauce and the sour cream on the salmon surface, take away any fishy or strong flavor.  Made this for the first time, today, and served it to friends.  You received RAVE reviews.  It's such simple elegance. Served with rice, fresh asparagus and rolls, and additional Chardonnay to drink, it was a totally delicious dinner.  Thank you very much for sharing this wonderful recipe! Do you have any more like this up your sleeve?

I absolutely love this recipe. The salmon stays very moist and the sauce tastes great. I can see where the sauce could become too thick, but I kept a close eye on it and varied the flour as I went. Very easy to prepare. Would be great for any occasion. Thanks.

I did like this recipe, the salmon was flaky and not dry, the sauce went beautifully over the fish. I did a little different with the sauce, I sweated the shallots in 1 tbsp. butter, then wine. Reduced wine/butter/shallot mixture to about 2 tbsp. I added 3 tbsp. flour, made a roux, followed by half & half and a bit of water until the sauce is a bit thin and creamy.

Good but a little bland.  Cream sauce got way too thick while cooking, perhaps I overheated it.  Husband loved the recipe and kids ate it so I will make again.

Fantastic!!!  I made this recipe when we had company coming over.  Everyone raved and even the kids loved it.  I did omit the flour in the sauce and added 1 Tbsp. dill to the sauce.  I served this with new potatoes and fresh green beans!  This recipe is a keeper!!!  Thanks!

I'm glad I didn't pour this dreadful sauce over the expensive salmon before tasting it. I  didn't make any changes so therefore was faced with this extremely thick tastleless sauce.  I had to add more cream, wine, dijon, onion salt, garlic, pepper but nothing helped.  Way too much flour.  I used sockeye fillets and 30 minutes would have been far too long at that temperature. There are far better salmon recipes on this site.  My husband & daughter didn't like it either.

4.5 Stars!
I made this dish last minute; I had the ingredients on hand.  It was easy and really didn't take too long.  I followed the recipe as printed and everyone liked it - with just a little bit of complaint about calories and fat.  I think it would be exceptional with broiled salmon and JUST the dijon cream sauce on the side.  Also, we used the cream sauce tonight with left over chicken and potato cakes and it was AWESOME.  The sauce is a great addition to vegies, starches and meats.  Thanks for sharing!

The salmon was fabulous with the sour cream sauce on top.  I mixed the dill and pepper, along with some red pepper and a pinch of salt, directly into the sour cream.  The fish was moist and flavorful.  However, the dijon cream sauce, in my opinion, was horrible.  I reduced the flour to two Tbs. so the consistency was good, but it was incredibly bland.  I tried adding garlic, salt, dill, lemon juice, onion powder and pepper, but nothing helped. 

I will definitely make the salmon again...without the sauce.

I took the advice of other reviewers and used 1 TBSP of flour and it was fabulous!  I also used light cream (didn't notice a difference in taste) and some sauteed white onions instead of shallots. This is great recipe I'd use for impressing guests!

Fair, not anything that we went crazy over.  I added 3 shallots and 2x's the dill but overall it was still somewhat bland.  I probably will not make again considering the calorie/fat content and the fact that it was just OK.

I just made and consumed this! It was quite good and my husband liked it, but it lacked zip and the sauce was thick even though I took the flour down to two tablespoons. To give it a better texture, I added some more wine to the sauce after thickening. Next time, I would increase the dijon to two tablespoons. The sour cream was a nice touch and seemed to flavour the salmon a bit. To add some presentation, you can always add a bit of dill weed after you have distributed the sauce over the salmon pieces (my husband remarked how pretty the fillets looked coming out of the oven, but that gets covered up with sauce. All in all, it was a nice break from the way I usually cook salmon, so this recipe is a keeper.

This was a good cream sauce but I thought that it drowned out the salmon flavor too much.

The sauce was certainly tasty but I'm not even sure that it needed flour.  The taste of the flour was definitely noticeable.

Follow the sauce recipe exactly "except" reduce the flour to 1T, add some garlic, tarragon and seasoned salt to the sauce. That's what was missing for us. Did you guys get into the Chardonnay? Pinot Grigio works better!

The sour cream sauce you bake the salmon with in the oven tasted bland. The dijon sauce you add is tastey, but a bit too thick. This recipe has potential, but the ingredients need to be adjusted.

overall it is a very easy, time-saving way to approach salmon. however, the flour used is too much, i've already reduce it in half, i guess timing is very important as well, so once you pour in the half-half and  flour mixture, cook for another 15-20 seconds, that's it.

I am not sure if you had problems with it being too thick  because of half and half we used plain 2% milk and it was wonderful.  Served at party and this salmon was the first to disappear we all loved it.

FANTASTIC!  I used less flour in the sauce & it was perfect.  I served what little was left over for brunch with home grown tomatoes and English muffins.  This sauce also worked very well with talipia

Didn't make the salmon...only the sauce.  Agree with other posts that the sauce was way too think.  1/4 cup flour for such a small amount of liquid is over the top.  If you reduce the flour to about 4 teaspoons and add additional salt you'll be just fine.

My rating is 3 stars though my husband gives it 4 stars but since I'm the cook... after having read the reviews I made some changes... I skipped the sour cream, used a bit of white pepper and lemon pepper, along with the dill to season the fish.  Baked it at 350 degrees F for the time specified.  It came out moist and nicely seasoned.  The sauce, well... I cut the flour down to 1/8 cup (which gave a decent consistency), ended up adding another tablespoon Dijon mustard and 1/4 teaspoon salt to the sauce for more flavor.  Maybe a little more wine next time... I'm not sure, it needed a little something more.

(Based on other reviews).............
I decreased the flour (to only 1 Tablespoon).  I substituted the wine with broth and the shallot with some fresh minced onion.  Fantastic!  And the sauce left over is great for toasted roast beef sandwiches (almost like a flavored mayonnaise)  Yummy!
Will be making this again, as we are BIG salmon fans.

I used this recipe for the sauce to top a BBQ'd cedar plank salmon.  As many mentioned before the flour was a bit too much so I ended up adding double of everything else.  The sauce was still a bit thick.  I also added a bit of tarragon as the flavor seemed to lack any significant character (maybe it was the mustard I used).  None the less this is a good place to start for what could be a wonderful salmon sauce.

Delicious.  I followed the recipe pretty closely except I didn't have any dill.  My husband loved it.

I cooked the salmon differently, (see: salmon in the dishwasher - great method!)  But the sauce I tried.  Was not impressed.  Like the others, I reduced the flour and it was still way too thick.  Tried adding more half and half.  The flavor was not there, tried more mustard, tarragon, etc.  Not a success.  I almost hated the thought of putting it on my very precious and costly wild salmon fillets.  My husband did like it, but I would look elsewhere for a creamy dijon sauce, sorry!

This was a good recipe, but even after doubling the dill and pepper on the fish, it was still quite bland.
