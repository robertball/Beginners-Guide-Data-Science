I froze and thawed the cranberries and found it too "soft" and syrupy for my taste.  Next time I will use half frozen and half fresh.  I also used orange juice instead of liqueur.  When our family would use it as a chips and salsa dip I added onions and it made a big difference!  So for the reviewer, "Mickey", I think I understand your disappointment and fresh chopped onions is what was missing for you.  I also used the salsa for our holiday dressing rather than traditional cranberry sauce, and added cream cheese of course for a spread.

Sorry, this salsa didn't suit me at all! I was very disappointed w/ the outcome of this. As the recipe directed, I prepared everything in advance, allowing time to sit overnight so that I could serve it w/ chicken tacos the next day. I was a bit worried about how this would turn out b/c it tasted VERY bitter (I "tested" tiny spoonfuls as I was making it), despite adding extra honey to compensate. Something about the jalapeno seemed out of place to me as well. Hoping that the flavors would "meld" overnight, I took another "test" sample b4 making dinner, and, at that point, decided to toss it all (my fiance didn't try this; he HATES cranberries so therefore topped his tacos w/ "traditional" condiments). I 1/2'd the yield amount, so I have plenty of cranberries, cilantro and honey left to use in other recipes (as well as the booze I already had in my pantry - for drinking!), but the $'s spent on jalapenos and limes were a total waste. I think this recipe needs sugar to sweeten it, NOT honey. If you think about it, the tartness of traditional cranberry sauce is balanced w/ sugar, so why mess w/ what already works (?). Oh, and I did freeze my cranberries 1st, and then allowed them to thaw b4 processing (which I don't think made that much of a difference, IMHO). Too bad! This would have been a nice fall salsa to add to my recipe box. It seems that most people enjoyed your recipe, Bluestocking, but unfortunately, it wasn't to our liking :(

I made this for a Thanksgiving appetizer, and served it with corn chips. It was delicious. I modified the recipe slightly. I used a chipotle pepper instead of jalepeno because I like the smokey flavor. I also used 1/4 diced sweet yellow onion. The end result was fabulous!

This gets better with time. Plan to make it ahead of time.  Even my friend who doesn't eat hot peppers liked this one.

Maybe its because I didn't let it sit very long, but I used only half the about of jalepenos and it was SO spicy! It's an interesting flavor for a salsa, though.
