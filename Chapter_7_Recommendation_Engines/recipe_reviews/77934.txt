I liked this soup but I thought it was a bit spicy I say cut the tumeric and caynene pepper in half if you don't really like spicy food.

This was easy to make and really delicious. I left it a bit chunky when puree-ing the soup. I like my soup to have a bit more texture so it eats like a meal.

I made this soup but substituted soy milk for the half and half.  I also used veggie stock and fresh ginger.  My first few tastes of the soup were delish...but then it just made me sickened...  couldnt bring myself to eat it....I would leave out the cayenne next time if I do decide to make it again....

This was great! I’m a vegetarian so I substituted seared tofu for the sea scallop and used veggie broth instead of chicken.  I did put a sea scallop on my husband’s soup and he loved it.  I also cut the cayenne pepper in half and it was just enough heat.   I served this with some warm bread straight out of the oven and a small salad.

Great recipe! Be sure to use glass or ceramic containers to store and heat this, or the turmeric will stain!

Thanks for the recipe! I make many variations of this soup from leaks, butternut squash or broccoli and was excited to try the cauliflower. The preparation method though let the taste down a lot. Instead of sauteing the onion and cauliflower next time i'll boil it in water. Then use the bullion for the soup, instead of adding water or chicken broth. This way you preserve the flavour of the veggies, the soup has a much better punch to it and the spices aren't that sharp. Not to mention it's healthier :)

I really liked this, but could definitely have done with a bit less spice. It made my throat burn.

I made this for a retreat, and it was great.  One attendee said, "I don't even like cauliflower, and I loved this!"

This was a very flavorful, spicy soup. It was a little too spicy for my kids, but my husband and I liked it. I think it needs some more texture too it. I felt a little like I was eating baby food. Maybe leave some chunks of cauliflower or add some celery, carrot, or potato chunks. We had it with wheat french bread. The sweetness was a nice contrast. I made it with fat free half and half and didn't miss the fat.

I liked this soup.  However, 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper is TOO much.   The heat detracted from the flavor of the soup.

Perfect! Nice and spicy. I didn't change a thing except I omitted saffron because I didn't have it on hand.  Ver, very good!

I followed the recipe procedure but adjusted the spices.  I used fresh ginger, putting in with the garlic.  I didn't want it to be spicy hot so left out the cayenne completely.  I used about a quarter cup of heavy cream.  Result:  Delicious, not too spicy, very flavourful.

Very tasty and will likely make it again! A lot of people are saying that it is too spicy, but as someone who likes spicy, I would not adjust the spices. I only used half a cup of heavy cream, which was fine, and it would have been OK without it entirely for those who are cutting calories and/or diary. I didn't use any scallops but I would if I was serving this to guests. Also, this was my first time using saffron, which is a monetary investment, but, oh, what a pleasure for the senses!
