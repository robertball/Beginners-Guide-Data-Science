Great recipe! Nice variation on basic salmon patties.
Did some tweaking because it did seem like proportions were out.
Here are my changes:
Sauce-doubled garlic to 4 cloves
     -doubled green onion to 2 stems
     -halved lime juice to 2 T.
     -added 2tsp. wasabi powder
Patties-halved bread crumbs to 3/4 c.
       -used 1 lb. leftover salmon
        (fresh not canned, cooked)
       -finely mince onions
       -form into patties and
        refrigerate at least 15
        minutes

I enjoyed this recipe (and it was a hit with my 1 yr old, too, and "okay" with my 7 year old and 36 year old).  I made quite a few modifications, because I made it impromptu.  

For the sauce, I did not have miso or sake.  I added rice wine vinegar instead of the sake (not quite 1/4 cup) and extra lime.  I think that the cakes are good on their own--better without the sauce--or maybe just a little lime/butter sauce would be good.

I amended the cakes as well, since the proportion seemed off.  I used a whole can of salmon (14 oz), and less bread crumbs--maybe 1 cup max?  I had to use 2 eggs to get them moist enough.  I added a bit of lime juice as well.  My 7 year old complained that there were too many onions, so I'd chop them more finely next time.

I must say that this dish was absolutely delicious. I used authentic Miso paste and Sesame oil from Japan. I used a tablespoon of the Miso paste, and it was a little too much. The other user was right. You just need maybe half a tablespoon, but all other measurements were perfect. Salmon cakes came out good texture, and the sauce with it was yummm. I made my own chinese fried rice to go with it, and it was really tasty, my hubby just ate up the whole dish! It came out to be about 7 salmon cakes. :)

This was a crowd-pleaser served with teriyaki rice.  I loved LOVED! the miso cream sauce.  I was amazing.  I little goes a long, long way, so don't make much.  The sauce would be good with sushi as well.  As for the salmon cakes, they left something to be desired, but the overall flavor with the sauce was good.  I would like to know if someone has a better basic "cake" recipe because it was a bit bland.  There was too much bread crumb to the rest.  But I assume if we decreased the bread crumbs the patties would fall apart.  I don't know...  I will definitely make this again.  I will probably try some variations to the patty next time.  Don't know what that will consist of yet...

I made this recipe tonight to the letter.  I tasted the sauce before serving and decided to add about a tsp of fresh grated ginger.  It was delicious.  Very simple recipe for salmon cakes and the sauce was just flavorful enough to complement without killing the taste of the salmon.  I often make salmon cakes and get crazy with the ingredients trying to spice things up but this is a great recipe that lets you enjoy the simple goodness that is a salmon cake.  I served this with steamed baby bok choy and the Vietnamese Rice-Noodle Salad recipe from this site (substituting hoisin sauce for the fish sauce and adding a tbsp of rice vinegar).  Everything went together very well.  Will definitely add this to my permanent recipe book.  Thanks for sending it in.  Oh, the sauce made a lot more than I needed for the 6 salmon cakes I got out of the recipe so I might try it as a pasta sauce tomorrow.

Love this dish! I make it all the time. Sometimes I subsitute a dry white wine for sake if I don't have any and it works well. We like to eat it with steamed bok choy and rice and drizzle the sauce all over it. Yum.

These were wonderful!!!  I used miso soup base, because I couldn't find miso paste and I used fresh salmon.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  They had a great flavor and texture and the sauce was fabulous.  These were better than any crab/fish cakes I have tried.

I had a big fear of canned salmon but it worked well with a few modifications. This sauce is great but, because of my fear of can salmon, I was afraid it would be too salty. I added mirin and 1/2 tsp. of sugar to sweeten it up a little to combat the salt. This was wonderful. I also added pickled ginger to the patties. These two additions added a great flavor to an already great recipe. Thanks for sharing it!

I love crab cakes and was a bit apprehensive about using salmon and cilantro in this recipe.  I didn't have any soy sauce on hand but I did have fish sauce (don't ask). The cakes along with the sauce were worthy of a fine Asian restaurant, baked or fried.  I'll definitely add this dish to my reperatoire!

Turned out great. Like others, I made some minor changes, using more salmon to increase the ratio of meat to crumbs; I also had to double the egg mixture. I had no sake, so used mirin. I'm not sure if that's why the sauce seems a little sweet. No big deal, it's really tasty anyways. One quibble with the directions: I had to really almost boil my sauce to thicken it. In my cooking lexicon, a simmer is just a few bubbles at the center; I hd to get the sauce going a lot harder than that to get it to the right consistency. Once I did, all was good.   I served this dish with a simple Japanese sunomono (pickled cucumber) salad and got rave reviews from the family. Definitely will make again!

I LOVED this recipe; yummy yum yum.  And healthy for you too!  I added slightly more salmon as I had some leftovers which I combined with a can of Sockeye.  I also used Soy Milk instead of milk since I'm learning to eat for my blood type.  I used rye bread for the bread crumbs for the same reason.  I highly recommend this one guys, 5 stars.

This recipe is amazing with a few mods:
 -saute onions (and cilantro if you prefer a mellow taste) before mixing with the salmon mixture
 -if you don't have heavy cream, use a combination of butter and milk. Then mix in some cornstarch or flour to thicken the sauce
-Cut down the breadcrumbs by at least half! 
-If you don't have sake, use cooking wine or any type of white wine.
-Cut the sauce recipe in half unless you will be using it for other recipes.

These salmon cakes had way too much bread crumbs. I didn't taste any salmon. The sauce was okay but overall probably a waste of sake and miso paste. Thanks for the recipe though.

Easy to prepare and quite delicious.  The sauce seems flexible enough to use with chicken as well.

Not only did these cakes crumble, even when I tripled the amount of liquid binder, but they were mostly breadcrumbs with very little salmon. I'm the kind of person who actually wants to taste the crab in crabcakes, not the "filler". The sauce was really overpowering, not that tasty and a waste of sake.

Thought it was ok.  I made the thickness about 1/2 inch on the 2 inch variety. Not sure it was cooked through even though the outsides were nicely browned (had heat med high).  Will try to reheat later in the oven to see if that takes care of it.  Had trouble thickening the sauce, will probably thicken with some flour later but sauce was not as deep a flavor as I expected.  Think the cakes would go just as well with a salsa.

I roast my own salmon and flaked it for this recipe.  The sauce was great but the salmon cakes were a little dry.  I might use a combination of dry and fresh bread crumbs next time.  They were quite flavorful!

I used panko crumbs and didn't have any sake. It worked out great. I might try baking/broiling this this next time as I'm not too fond of fried food. Also need to make sure the ingredients  are finely chopped to help it hold together. Flavours were excellent

Very good. I am not a salmon/crab cake fan.  But had leftovers I needed to use so thought I would give it another try. Very, very good.  Winged it on the ingredient amts as I only had a small amt of leftover cooked salmon. And no cream but substituted coconut milk. WOW!  Used the sauce over the steamed asparagus we had with it.  Again excellant. Will definitely do again!

Love this staple at our house! remember that canned salmon is DRY and you can cut WAY back on the bread crumbs! Here in Canada, we get a lot of great fresh & moist salmon so the bread crumbs keep it all together. (The salmon will stay moist if you dont overcook it when your using BBQ leftovers!) Kinda of like meatballs, use your hands and eyes to tell how much bread crumbs is enough!  : )
