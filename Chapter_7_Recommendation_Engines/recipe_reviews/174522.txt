Very tasty and easy.  You can modify this any way you want to suit your taste buds.  You can do cinnamon and sugar instead of pesto for something sweet.  You can add a thin layer of spaghetti sauce, chopped pepperoni, and basil for a more pizza flavor.  Sharp Chedder Cheese and bacon bits would be good too.  Explore and have fun!

These were excellent! I made them for a family party and they were a big hit; even my 2 year old cousin loved them! I will definitely make these again!
