These are absolutely DELICIOUS. I made the batter as directed. The first batch of cookies flattened too much, but after the batter had sat for about 10 minutes, it thickened nicely and the cookies were perfect. I used a 2 tbsp. mini ice cream scoop so they'd be the same size, and I had no problems with them keeping a funky shape while baking. They smoothed out perfectly. I used a different filling: 1 large tub Cool Whip, 8 oz cream cheese, 2/3 cup sugar and 2 tsp. vanilla, whipped together. It was light, not too rich. The flavor of the pies was much better after they rested overnight. MAKE THIS RECIPE. You won't be disappointed.

Very yummy.  Mine were done at 10 minutes.  I do prefer cream cheese filling with pumpkin, so I used the cream cheese II recipe from this site.

OMG!!  These were amazing!  I made them for a FBLA fundraiser for my son, and they were the first thing to sell out.  Not before hubby kept some for himself.  I did use a different filling (1 cup butter, 1 cup marshmallow creme, 2 cups confectioners sugar & 2 tsp vanilla).  These are heavenly!

I have made these whoopie pies close to a dozen times since I found the recipe and they always turn out excellent. Everyone loves them because they are not overly sweet, but are super moist. I always add a little extra cloves or "baking spice" to make them extra spicy, just because that is the way I like them. If you beat your egg white until stiff peaks form the frosting is even fluffier. It is true that they turn out pretty much how they are put onto the cookie sheet so using a piping bag (or a ziploc bag with the corner cut off) will result in a smoother cookie top. I have never tried the cream cheese filling but I would think it would be too rich. The best part about this recipe is you can eat more than one, because they are not icky sweet.

These cookies are excellent! Make sure to bake at least 12 minutes. When trying a new recipe, I always do a trial run with only a few cookies to see how long to bake, space apart on the cookie sheet, etc. My first batch appeared to be done, but then the cookies fell and I realized they were underdone. The rest of them came out perfectly. I used a regular cookie dough scoop and the cookies looked great. With the icing, make sure to beat your egg white at a high setting for about 10 minutes. I added just a touch of cream of tartar to it during this stage. The icing took about 15 minutes to make and I had some left over. The cookies are not too sweet, which makes them so enjoyable. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

Can't keep my hands off these!  Everyone says they would be better with cream cheese filling, which I tried.  But, I still prefer the creamy white filling.  The cream cheese seams to take away from the delicious pumpkin cookie.

This was really pretty good. I loved the filling, it wasn't too sweet, but worked well with the pumpkin part. I used the EggBeaters eggwhites instead of  regular eggs, and they worked great.  One problem I had with the pumpkin part though was it ended up very sticky, so I couldn't wrap them, and eating them left chunks on the fingers. Something else to bear in mind, these don't really spread out, so whatever shape you plop them onto the pan in is the shape your cookies will have. But the cream filling? Fabulous, especially for someone that isn't keen on exceedingly sweet things.

You have to try this....Moist, tasty, and a great crowd pleaser.  They are better then bakery sold.
  Very easy to prepare, could probably use mix for muffins.  FYI, does not spread all to much on baking sheet. How you scoop it, that is the shape that primarily comes out

I originally got almost this exact recipe out of a Family Fun magazine several years ago - they were called Pilgrim Pies and my son LOVES them. For the Piligrim Pies you use an entire can of pumpkin (which is only a small difference) and 1 Tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice, which I'm sure would also be very similar.  The Pilgrim Pie recipe calls for this Cream Cheese filling; mix 4 oz of softened cream cheese and 1 stick of softened butter.  Add 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 4-5 cups of powdered sugar, 1/2 cup at a time until you get the desired consistency.  This is a fabulous and fun recipe......something a little bit different, kinda like a mini cake complete with frosting!

Fan-freakin-tastic!!! Add my voice to the Greek chorus praising this recipe. Super tasty, soft, moist cookies filled with a yummy, fluffy vanilla frosting. I used a scoop that holds about a tablespoon and a half of dough, and was able to make 37 "sandwiches" at that size, which were still pretty big. Enough filling that I had some left over, even after spreading it on generously, such that it oozed out when the two cookies were put together. Perfectly spiced (yes, spice is measured in tablespoons, not teaspoons. Hallelujah! I love spicy cookies!) they are good enough to stand alone without the frosting. Hint: Adding a big pinch of salt to the frosting helps round out the flavor for those who thought it tasted too much like shortening, and be sure to whip well, until fluffy. These treats are so outstanding that they are all but guaranteed to please even the fussiest cookie monster. Everyone at my husband's work went crazy for them.

The cookie was very soft and moist. I didn't like the way they looked so I piped cookie dough pinwheels onto the pan instead of dropping them with a spoon. It looked much nicer! I'm used to whoopie pies with a thicker frosting, so I give the cookie 4 stars but the icing 3 stars. Next time I'll either add more sugar to make the icing more dense or I'll use a different recipe. Either way I'll still add a little maple flavoring in the icing, it really compliments the pumkin flavor of the cookies.

I don't know what happened.  I bake all the time.  They tasted too doughy.  Texture was off.  Does 1 can of pumpkin = 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin puree.  Maybe that's why the recipe was off.

I make these for my bake sales, sprinkle a little powdered sugar on top, and they always sell out! I do make a cream cheese filling that's not too overpowering with cream cheese but brings out the flavor; equal parts cream cheese and marshmallow creme, 1/2 part margarine or crisco, dash of vanilla and then I add enough powdered sugar to make the right consistency. They taste/sell better that way and you don't get a greasy aftertaste in your throat.  The first batch I baked held their shape so I slightly flatten them and then they look perfect.   Dont overbake these and they will stay moist. I also make them slightly smaller than the picture and for some reason it seems like they taste better that way! You can serve them yo your guests and they reach around better. :)

Wow, so good! Admittedly, I did not use the given filling... found a recipe on this site for Maple Cream Cheese frosting and thought it would be amazing with the pumpkin. Yep, it was a match made in heaven. These baked up very nicely and the taste and texture is great. I think they taste amazing right out of the fridge. Thanks! :)

This is a terrific recipe and the result is out of this world. My kids were begging for more. I did tweak it as follows: used 1 c. white and 1 c. brown sugar; added not quite 1/4 c. of molasses to the wet batter; and next time I will put some cinnaomon in the filling for a little extra spice. happy autumn!

Very easy and delicious! I let my batter rest for a good 15-20 mins before I began scooping. I used a mini ice cream scoop and they came out nice and uniform. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion and used cream cheese frosting for the filling, I think that was the key. I'm sure the original recipe is great as is, but to me pumpkin and cream cheese frosting just go :) Anyway, make sure to let them set up before serving to avoid the filling oozing out. These were a huge hit and everyone went on and on about how good they were. Thanks for sharing!

Cookie is excellent! No changes needed to that. Adjusted the filling by adding another egg white, extra 1/2 cup of confectioners' sugar and 3/4 cup marshmallow fluff. Cut shortening down to 1/2 cup. Meringue powder may be substituted for the egg whites.

HEAVENLY. So, so, so good. The filling tastes just like oreo cookie filling and is just toooo good.  These have been a big hit at my holiday parties - I made the recipe as directed but only made 1/2 the cookies so that I could make the rest on Christmas Eve and bring these on Christmas Day!

Made these for a Christmas party and they loved them!!! My son in law said they were like "heaven". After you make the cookie be sure and do not stack together even after cooled they still tend to stick together. Keep laid out separately. I cut out a Christmas tree stencil from image printed offline and laid on top ea. cooke and sprinkled powder sugar on top and it made a beautiful display of white Christmas trees! I want to explore even more flavors of "Whoopie Pies!" Thank you so much!

These are even better with cream cheese frosting in the middle. I use 4 ounces of cream cheese, 1/2 cup of butter or margarine, 2 teasponns of vanilla extract, and a box of confectioners' sugar.

Great base recipe..added more sugar and the reviews gave some great tips. Used cream cheese filling and people at work loved them. My son loved them plain without any frosting so this is a winner!

If you are a whoopie pie lover this recipie is a must! The whoopie pies don't puff up very big, but what they lack in size they make up for in flavor. Also I used a cream cheese filling for these and it was amazing. I'd highly recommend using the cream cheese! They also make the house smell amazing - a great way to welcome fall!

OMG!!  I made these for my hubby for Valentine's Day - he LOVES pumpkin anything!  They were so good, I LOVED them just as much as he did and I usually prefer chocolate desserts!!

One thing I changed, though, was the filling.  I think pumpkin pairs so well with cream cheese so I made a filling with cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, vanilla and a touch of Silk.

De-lish!!  They were so easy to make as well!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I used my own recipe for the filling. These cookies are extremely quick & easy to whip up anytime & they taste great. Very moist & yummy. Thanks for a great recipe!

How many recipes do you know where people say, "Save me one!  Wrap one up & HIDE IT for me!"  Seriously, they are *that* good...  We made these about 5 times while we stayed with relatives over Christmas.  The neighbors from whom we had to borrow powdered sugar complained that we paid them back with *only* 6 whoopie pies.  We prefer using 1/2 the oil, and dark brown sugar.

Really good, moist and flavorful.  The only thing I didn't like is there was way too much spice for my liking, especially cloves.  I would probably only add half as much next time.

These are very light and cakey. I substituted applesauce for half of the oil and the cookies were still moist. I used a pastry bag to squeeze them out into very small, neat dollops and only baked for about 5 to 7 minutes per batch. They held their shape well and were delicious without any frosting.  I made a lemon cream cheese frosting and it made them a very rich but not too heavy treat that could be eaten in one big bite (or two small bites, if you're dainty). Next time I might leave out the lemon and try just a simple cream cheese frosting-or the recipe on this page.

Wonderful "pie," but I used a cream cheese frosting for the filling, and they were perfect.  I don't like the flour paste/crisco/sugar filling.  I used a cookie scoop and baked them on parchment paper, and they came off the baking sheet perfectly.  I will definitely use this again.

I loved these! I altered the recipe a bit as I always do and I filled them with a whipped cream cheese rather than the recipe filling. I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour because I used a 15 ounce can of pumpkin. I also added a few dashes of nutmeg. I found that the batter needed to sit for at least 5 minutes before I could cook them because the first pies just flattened out. I used a 2 tablespoon cookie scoop to put the batter on the pan and it worked like a charm.

Quite good. I was hoping for a little stronger pumpkin taste. C'est la vie. If I make this recipe again I will be doubling the filling. It's jut not nearly enough.

Made for co-workers, they loved them! Doubled recipe but otherwise left alone. Did not have ginger/cloves but they tasted good with just cinnamon and nutmeg! Was lazy on the frosting so used a $2 can of whipped cream cheese frosting.

This review is just for the cookies themselves.  OMG they are so good.  Moist and very flavorful.  Definitely will make again.  Did not make the filling as it's getting late but if it's as good as the cookies I can't wait to try it.

Excellent Recipe, my family absolutely loved them.  The only recommendations I would make would be to used 1/2 c. oil and substitute 1/2 c. applesauce.  I would also recommend baking these on parchment paper.

I loved these!  I did make changes suggested by KSWillis and they came out beautifully.  Using a cookie scoop (1/2 TBSP), I got exactly 36 pies.  i put 12 on a cookie sheet, but you could get a few more.  Mine came out about 2" in diameter.  I had just a little filling left, so the measurements are dead on.  I did substitute Neufchatel cheese for the cream cheese.

These are amazing. They are so easy to make and so tasty. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except I was out of brown sugar so I mixed cane sugar and molasses. I think that made the cookies a little bit richer, but I also added extra spices because I like that extra kick of flavor.
Great recipe!

I thought these were OK but my hubby and daughter LOVED them!! I didn't find them sweet enough, but they were good. I also didn't like how the recipe for the whipped middle used raw egg because I'm pregnant. But otherwise, I'll definetely be using this recipe again!

These were excellent!!  I made them for my 2 year old's daycare class for their Thanksgiving meal.  They were the perfect size treat for little hands, and a toddler friendly way to introduce pumpkin as a dessert:)  I did use a different recipe for the filling because I normally don't cook with shortening.  I had no problem making them about the same size as each other (a previous post encountered that problem).  I didn't realize making Whoopie Pies could be so easy.

Not sure what I did wrong as I just thought these didn't have a lot of taste and I should have used a cream cheese frosting inside.  I used Pumpkin Pie spice instead of the spices listed and I used pumpkin cooked from scratch as I had 3 pie pumpkins I cooked.  So not sure I will try again or not.

These were so delicious!   As others recommended, I used 2T as a measurement for the dough and they were the perfect size.  As a personal preference, I cut down on the cloves (used 1/4 tsp instead) as I'm not a huge fan of the clove taste.  I also used the Libby's cream cheese filling recipe (6 tblsp butter, 4 oz cream cheese, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1 1/2 c powdered sugar) instead.  I will definitely make these again!

I used half applesauce/half oil and more cinnamon, no cloves and about 1/2 cup more pumpkin.  I made the cake portion different ways and found that piping it with a large decorating tip worked the best and kept the cookies a consistent size.  The pumpkin flavor in the cakes is really good.  I also used a cream cheese icing, as that is what I had, and they turned out wonderful!  I froze the whoopie pies both before and after icing and had no problems with any sticky cakes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These are delicious!  I used my cookie scoop to plop the dough onto the pan and they came out perfectly.  I used a cream cheese filling instead of the one given (personal preference).  The only issue I had was that they are sticky, so don't stack them on top of one another like in some of the photos.  It will tear out big chunks of the cookie.

Wonderful! I even made them slightly lower fat and less calories.  I substuted 1/2 the oil with applesauce and used Splenda's brown sugar substitute in place of regular brown sugar (just remember to use just 1/2).  I too used a simple cream cheese filling.  I like the cookies even without the icing.

This is the first time I made pumpkin whoopie pies and these are delicious!  I used an ice cream scoop to make them big, and baked for 15 min.  Yummy!

These are wonderful!!!  Don't change a thing!  I did do the filling in a different order:  I whipped the shortning first..I did not want any chunks by adding shortning to egg whites and milk.  For the person who said they were too runny...do not add all the milk at once.  Use a little at a time until you reach your desired consistancy. Thanks for an awesome recipe!!!!!!!

These are delicious! The cookie was nice and moist, and the cream filling light and fluffy. I might try the cream cheese frosting next time, but these are great as-is. This recipe is definitely staying in my recipe box!

I have made these every year for Thanksgiving and they're quite the hit. Kids love 'em and non-pumpkin lovers like them too. I substitute butter for crisco though.

I tried this recipe and the cookies turned out perfect.  Good enough to eat by themselves.  For the filling, I added 1 1/2 C. powdered sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 3/4 C. marshmallow creme.  This made it a 'spiced' filling with a little more body to it.  Gave some away and heard back promptly that they were really good!

I recently made this recipe and did not like it at all. The cake part was ok but didn't have much of a pumpkin flavor, and the frosting was very bad.

Amazing! I followed the recipe exactly for the cookie/cake/pie part. I used a melon baller so that I had mini versions. For the filling I did the same as the review below... 1 big tub cool whip, 8oz cream cheese 2/3c powdered sugar and 2 tsp vanilla! AMAZING!!!

My 8-yr old grandson and I have been making them this morning. First time and they are great! I used pumpkin pie spice instead of all the spices individually. We made the filling as instructed. It was all delicious! Between us, we ate the first batch! Definitely will be making these again! Next time I will try the Maple Cream Cheese Frosting I think, just to see if I like it better, but the original is great, too! Thanks for the recipe!

Made these as my first attempt at a whoopie pie. They were VERY good cookies! They stayed nice and soft. I used a 2Tbl sized cookie scoop, so they were nicely uniform. I used an entire can of pumpkin rather than leave a little in the can, and increased spices accordingly. I gave it five stars, because of the COOKIE PART ONLY. The filling was really pretty nasty. I added some canned cream cheese frosting to try to get rid of the nasty taste of the shortening. I'll definitely find another filling for the next time, but the cookie itself is a definite keeper. I didn't find a good way to wrap them. I used saran wrap, but it makes them a little sticky. I am thinking wax paper is the best way to wrap these up, then store in an airtight container of some sort. I stored a gallon bag of them (individually wrapped) in the freezer. They are just as good right out of the freezer! The cookie stays soft and they taste better chilled (IMHO). Will definitely do these again - everyone loved them, but will look for a better filling. The one here is just not good, with a funny aftertaste of shortening.

Made this according to recipe except used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of the whole 1 cup of oil.  Loved them!  Yummy.

I am giving this a 5 because my 14 year old made these while I was at work and surprised us with this dessert. She did a great job on her own. Cakes were moist and nicely spiced and the frosting on the inside was not too sweet. She used butter instead of shortning. The only teeny flaw was that I only had whole cloves in the house and she was unaware that I had a seperate spice grinder. So, she decided to chop the whole cloves the best she could....LOL....so yes, there are small pieces of the cloves in the cookie...but she tried and a definate 5 for this tasty treat. Thanks!

Great!  The only change I made in the recipe was to substitute 1 cup of vegetable shortening for the vegetable oil.   Even though I know that vegetable oil helps to keep baked goods moist, I felt that the vegetable shortening gave them a better texture.   

My filling consisted of 2 cups confectioner's sugar, 1/2 cup shortening, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.   Then, I add warm water, one tablespoon at a time, until the filling reaches the consistency I want.

I used a different frosting to fill these (Philly cream cheese frosting recipe from their red velvet cupcakes online) but the cakes from this recipe were fantastic. Moist, spicy, and SO tasty!

So good!!!  These were much easier to make than I expected.  I got kind of a late start making these (at about 8 pm) and was worried that I would be up half the night filling them, but I was done in about an hour, and they were gone much quicker than that. The cookies bake up in such nicely rounded shapes, and the frosting was the perfect consitency.  I actually found it easier to put the frosting in a piping bag to fill these.  They are really good, still slightly warm from the oven with the frosting practically running out of them.  We lost a few cookies this way:)

These were delicious!  The only difference I made was to add a few more spices (just my personal preference).  I also cook these in muffin tins so they all come out uniform!!

These were a big hit.  I also used the Cream Cheese II frosting(just a really small smear).  We used fresh pumpkin that we had roasted and mashed. These were great.

These are very good!  I agree that the cream cheese filling is a much better combination with the pumpkin.  However they are just as good without the filling.

These were sooo good! but i did make a few adjustments. i only had to bake mine for 9 mins so keep an eye on them. to the spices i added a little nutmeg, and a couple dashes of black pepper. my baking soda was a little old so i added 1/4 tsp extra. I did not make the confectioners sugar frosting. I made one by blending 8oz cream cheese, 2tbsp brown sugar, 2/3 cup confectioners sugar, and 2 tsp pure vanilla, then folding in 12oz of cool whip- fantastic combo of pumpkin with cream cheese. The cookies were light and fluffy with just the right amount of spice and not too sweet- will definitely make again. :)

I made this for a church potluck meal and they were a huge hit! I used a cookie dough scoop to make the pies the same size; however, next time I will use a smaller scoop. The pies are very filling and most people could not eat the whole thing.

This is a great recipe!  I use this for our cookie recipe as well.  For the filling, we use our homemade cream cheese frosting.  The cream cheese goes well with the pumpkin!  No changes to this recipe, a keeper for sure! We omit the clove, hubby hates clove.

Instead of the ground cinnamon, ginger, and cloves I used 2.5 tbls of pumpkin pie spice.  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site for the filling.  These were so good!  Everyone at work asked for the recipe.

This is cake not cookies.  Also, the filling/icing makes it way too sweet.  The seasonings made the house smell great while they cooked but I will not make again.

I made these for a bake sale but I made a cream cheese filling instead. When the cookies came out of the oven, I pressed them with a large cookie cutter shaped like a jack-o-lantern, they were soft enough to take the imprint yet stand up to it without crumbling. Everyone raved about them! One of the teens whose mom bought some came up to me and told me he LOVED them; they "tasted like pumpkin pie"!  I kept some for my DH and me, too - and, refrigerated in a sealed bag, they were great snacks even two days later!

This recipe is perfect for fall and anyone with a sweet tooth! I have made these Whoopie Pies twice. I followed the recipe exactly both times with the exception of the filling. The first time I tried the cream cheese recipe everybody was suggesting and the second time I used this recipes filling. Both were very very good, it is just up to individual taste (although my boyfriend strongly prefers the cream cheese.)  The first time I made these, I used a greased air-bake pan. The second time my boyfriend insisted that I use a normal pan with parchment. He thought his idea resulted in a better cookie, but I honestly couldn't tell a difference. The cookies were very thick, sticky and slightly underdone the first time. Thats because I made them way to big. Make sure to follow the recipe and use a heaping teaspoon. You might also want to spread it into a cookie shape, I don't think they expand very much.  This is a fantastic recipe and I will definitely be making it for years to come!!!

This was my first time baking with pumpkin, and the Whoopie Pies came out delicious!! I just had trouble with the filling so I used cream cheese filling instead.

These were just what I was looking for. This was the second recipe I tried and it will be my keeper. I used my own cream cheese icing just because I love it with anything pumpkin. The cookie portion was perfect.

I made the pies with the original recipe as is but used the cream cheese frosting II.  I baked the pies for 9 minutes and they were great.  The only problem is when storing the cookies they stuck to everything,(wax paper, plates, cooling rack) then they are not as pleasing to the eye but still taste great. I too used the 2T scoop to measure my dough, came out perfect size every time.  You need to be consistent with size so that the matching side will be the same. Very good.

OMG! These are soo good. I made them exactly as the recipe says and they came out YUMMMMMYY! I like them just by themselves without the filling...but they are scrumptious with the filling too. I think I will try the cream cheese frosting next time just because I love cream cheese and it compliments pumpkin flavor extremely well. One warning - they expand...My first batch I made a little big to try to get them nice and round...those were some BIG Whoopies!! A heaping teaspoon is perfect size.

I have been making these treats for 8 years and nobody ever gets tired of them.  We have several families to visit for the holidays and one year I didn't bring these and didn't hear the end of it.  I keep a cup of warm water handy to dunk my scoop/spoon to remove dough easier.  You can also pipe the dough.  I also add pumpkin spice in place of individual spices.  Very delicious! Very filling!

These are pretty good if you are looking for something not too sweet.  The batter doesn't move once it's on the pan so if you want circular pies you must spread it out before baking.  My second batch was super sticky and at first I wasn't sure why then I remembered I left the first batch in the oven a bit longer because I was busy scooping out more batter.  So next time I will bake them for 15-17 minutes and maybe that will cure the stickiness issue!  I used unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil and chose pumpkin pie spice and nutmeg for the spices.  I made the whoopie pie filling but added 4 oz of cream cheese to it.  This addition was wonderful!

Just made these today.  Used the Cream Cheese Frosting II that others recommended.  I got 43 whoopie pies using the small Pampered Chef cookie scoop.  It seemed like a lot of spices, but really, it's not.  May even add pumpkin pie spice next time.  These are super soft.  Make sure you store with waxed paper between pies or they will stick together.

My family will not stop raving about this recipe-they love it!  I followed another reviewers advice to let the batter sit for 10 minutes to thicken.  Also used "ACPHIFER's" idea for the filling.  I was not crazy about using the original filling because of the raw egg-just my preference.  Also, when preparing it, I was surprised at the quantities it called for on the spices, but don't cut back!  You need that much for a delicious recipe.  Only drawback is that they stick to the plate they are placed on (and each other if stacked) and can leave behind some of the cookie bottom.  Will definitely make again!

WoW! These were incredible! I will be making these often, not just at the holidays.  I made it exactly as written.  I will however experiment with different types of fillings to fit the occasion. If I could give 10 stars I would! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

So yummy good!  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the ginger and cloves, and I took some other reviewers advice and made a cream cheese filling.  A cookie scoop worked perfectly for me and I ended up with uniform size and shaped cookies!  This is a wonderful festive holiday treat!

I made these for Thanksgiving this year, and will probably be making them every Thanksgiving from now on.  For the filling, I used the suggestion of others and made a cream cheese frosting.  They went so fast that it made my head spin.  The kids and adults loved them.  I told my nieces and nephews that you have to shout "WHOOPIE!" when they eat the Pumpkin Whoppie pies.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I did not make these, nor would I.  I watched the video, first questioning who ever would add vanilla to dry ingredients and who would take a chance with uncooked egg in the filling.  Odd, just odd.

This recipe is AMAZING! I wanted to bring a new and delicious dessert to a post-Thanksgiving feast with friends and I found this recipe. And the crowd went wild!!! Most thought it was an old family recipe handed down from generations. I admitted it was a cool recipe I found on Allrecipes.com a few days before! There was one guy that ate at least 4 of them and took a few more home!! They are like light, moist, pumpkin cake-like cookies with a layer of sinfully sweet cream in the middle. I have a feeling I'm going to get request for this one every year! Thanks for sharing!

These were a hit with the kids. I followed the recipe, but I used 2.5 TBSP of pumpkin pie spice. For the filling, I did not use the egg white.

I stuck to the recipe as I always do the first time around. I wouldn't change anything. Let the batter rest though....that's a big step not to miss. I also used a cookie scoop. Perfect size. Thanks for posting it.

Excellent! Only change I made was using butter instead of shortening in the filling, and adding maple extract to the filling. They travel nicely when wrapped individually in plastic wrap.

These were good, my only complaint is it had too much cloves, if I make these again I would decrease the amount of clove. Otherwise these are very tasty, and simple to make.

Delicious!  However I do not use the egg white for the icing--I do not want to accidentally infect people with salmonella.  Use another icing without raw eggs to prevent taking the risk of food poisoning.  Cream cheese icing is a wonderful substitution.

I made these for a cook-off at work and won 3rd place!!!  My co-workers were complimenting me for days.  I used a small cookie scoop to drop them onto the cookie sheet and flattened them out before putting them in the oven.  I made a test batch and after letting them sit for a day they became really soggy.  I baked the second batch longer, but they still end up being so moist that if you don't eat them within the first day, you end up eating them with a fork.  It doesn't matter though because they taste great no matter what!

Great flavors and so moist!  I used a filling that is similar to the one for the Giant Ding Dong cake on allrecipes except I used all butter (no shortening) and added maple extract rather than vanilla.  This provides a really fluffy and not too sweet addition to the cake-like cookies. This filling is commonly used for a Red Velvet Cake icing as well. I also "dried" the cookies on racks over night to keep them from sticking to each other or the container. Then filled them, placed wax paper between them, and refrigerated the container before taking to work the next day. Yummy!

The Whoopie Pies VIII is a better recipe.  These cookies baked up small and round, no doubt because I had refrigerated the dough for quite awhile before baking.  I would also use a cream cheese-type filling as this one is really too sweet.  Still mighty tasty!

Great Recipe, I did not have cloves so substituted 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg instead and still turned out well. For the filling I added an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla  and extra 1 cup of confectioner's sugar to the recipe to help cut down the taste of shortening.  It still tasted pretty good and not too sweet.

I have made this recipe twice in the past week.  Very good!
I used fresh roasted pumpkin and otherwise followed the recipe for the cookie/cake part.  I used my favorite cream cheese frosting recipe for the filling. I particularly liked that the cookie/cake part is not tacky to the touch once cooked.

Ok I'm reviewing this strictly on the advice of others - I personally can't STAND pumpkin anything.  I've made these a couple of times and got rave reviews - one thing is to make sure you check the cakes by slightly pressing on them - they're done when they spring back.  If you don't do this they undercook and will become gummy as they cool.  I put the batter in a pastry back and cut off a corner, and use that to make circles for the cakes.  It's easier and they come out more uniform.

My only problem was these ended up more like cookies and less flat like whoopie pies--hard to fill!  Great flavors though.

I made these for Thanksgiving in order to have something different that was still very much in the feel of Thanksgiving food.  These are very yummy and a pleasant surprise to people when they see and eat them for the first time.  Suggestion is not to make them too big, (which is tempting!) as they are very rich.  People were a little shy trying them the first time so I was cutting them in half. Next time I'll make them a little more along the lines of two bite sized.  Perfect for fall, perfect for bake sales, everyone loved these whoopie pies!

The whoopie pies turned out great, nice and fluffy texture, but next time I think I'll add a bit more pumpkin and spice, I just wanted it to taste a little more pumpkin pie-ish.  Also, I should have followed my instincts and just used butter in the filling instead of the shortening since I find the texture off putting and I found myself needing to add way more sugar and vanilla as well as some cinnamon that I felt was missing in the cake.  Overall, great starter recipe to make adjustments to, but I'm glad I made a trial batch before Thanksgiving, I'm sure my co-workers will be happy with this tomorrow!

I used a large ice cream scoop to drop the dough and they came out big, soft, fluffy, moist and delicious. For the filling, I mixed shortening with powdered sugar, vanilla extract, water, and marshmallow creme. It made the creamiest frosting/filling I've ever tasted and was a perfect compliment to the cookies. Great recipe! These will be a permenant part of my holiday baking.

The cookie part was good but next time I will use the cream cheese filling. I did not like the filling recipe that was provided as it was too sweet for me. My kids loved these cookies with or without the filling.

These are delicious. I made them with 1/3 whole wheat flour and used a different filling but the spice was perfect and they were moist and lovely.

Let me start out by saying that these are AMAZING! I had 3/4 cup of pumpkin leftover so that's the sole reason I decided to make these. (just halved rest of ingred.) I never really had any desire to make whoopie pies. However, I'm SO glad I decided to! As another reviewer suggested, I used a dash of nutmeg because I didn't have any cloves or ginger. I also left them as cookies and topped them with cream cheese frosting and mini chocolate chips-- DELICIOUS! I am embarassed to admit how many I've eaten in the past 24 hrs. :) The batter is a bit thick, but don't let that throw you off, also let batter sit for about 10 min before baking. I will be making these A LOT, can't wait to make some for my next family get-together! Thanks for the recipe!

First of all, these are AMAZING.  I listened to the other reviewers and doubled the cookie recipe and made cream cheese icing.  I'm not sure what I did, but the cream cheese filling was runny and gross.  Then I made the filling on this recipe using hazlenut creamer instead of milk and adding a little pumpkin pie spice, WOW!  Everyone raved about them.  The cookie/cakes were so moist and delish, when making them I ran out of canned pumpkin, so I used a little canned pumpkin pie and they turned out excellent.  Overall, a really really good fall recipe!!

I used this recipe with a Pumpkin and Leaf Whoopie Pie pan.  I loved the flavor but in order to get it to work with the pan (expand into the cracks and crevices) I had to tweak it a bit.  At first I just tried adding water to thin it out.  This worked but after sitting overnight they got sticky.  Next I tried using a frosting bag and tip so I could manually fill the cracks/crevices.  This worked but since the batter doesn't really spread you could see every piped row in the finished product.  This sort of took away from the leaf/pumpkin look.  Next I tried using a tiny bit of water to thin it just a little (I made it so that the consistency was somewhere between cake batter and cookie dough but closer to cookie dough) and used the frosting bag and it worked perfectly!!  I still have a hint of lines on some of them but mostly gone!  They taste fantastic and look great.

Also - I used the cream cheese frosting recipe I found on this site.  It is perfect!

This is an awesome recipe! I had never made whoopie pies or even tried one before so I had no idea what to expect going into this. Anyway, I followed this recipe exactly (except I substituted meringue powder for the egg white in the filling) and it was delicious!! The texture is unlike anything I've had before. Like a moist, billowy, pumpkin spice cloud that just melts in your mouth. I will definitely make these again. Everyone loved them. Thank you!

these turned out great, I use the Libby's pumpkin pie mix instead of the puree, just saved me the spices step, I'm all about easy, did make 1/2 the icing listed and 1/2 cream cheese icing, they both are great!

Love love LOVE the pumpkin cookie. The taste and consistency was beautiful and moist. I used a 1 tablespoon cookie scoop and the shapes were perfect - they did not spread out much at all, just puffed up.  On the other hand, I took off one star for the filling. Frosting with all shortening, to me, has a greasy texture. Next time, I would follow one reviewer's suggestion of mallow cream - yummmmm. That being said, I took them to work and have had people gushing all day : )

The cookies were fantastic!  The filling was not tasty due to the shortening.  I prefer cream cheese filling because it doesn't taste oily.

These were delicious! My only problem with anything pumpkin that I make is that they become very moist after cooling. In order to decrease this effect, I store them in the fridge. Still amazing! Also, I used a different filling recipe with confectioner's sugar, shortening, milk, and marshmallow fluff.

I made these for my daughter's tailgate party after their playoff game.  They were devoured in minutes.  I added nutmeg to the dough mixture in equal quantities to the other spices and in the filling I added 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  The pumpkin pie spice added the little extra that I thought the recipe needed and tied it all together beautifully.

I love pumpkin Whoopie pies. I have been a fan of them for many years and have been baking them them self just as long. This one has good pumpkin flavor and bakes to the perfect size. I make mini Whoopie pies and send them to school with my kids or to school with my wife for her class. I did change it a little. I used room temperature butter instead of the oil and half white sugar and half brown sugar.

The cookie recipe itself is wonderful, though like many others, I didn't like the filling. I decided to make a maple meringue filling instead, using 2 egg whites, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon maple extract. After filling the cookies with the meringue, I baked them at 300 degrees for 10 more minutes. This did not change the consistency of the cookies at all, they were still soft and delicious after the second bake.   Another minor note: Do not grease the cookie sheet. Given nearly all cookie recipes call for ungreased sheets, and this specifically said otherwise, I thought there may have been a reason. There is not. On a greased sheet these cookies spread out far too much, but they turn out fine, and don't stick, on an ungreased sheet.

These were absolutely yummy!  Easy to make and delicious.  The shape of my first batch came out odd (I just used a spoon).  Then I had the idea to use my cupcake tin and they came out perfectly shaped!

These were fantastic! I believe someone even said it was the best dessert they had ever eaten. I followed the recipe exactly, but people should be aware that if you spoon the dough onto cookie sheets, they won't turn out so pretty. I used a piping bag with no tip to make my cookies, and they were very smooth and pretty on top. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Possibly the most delicious cookies I have ever made (and that's saying a lot).  I made these with the filling in the recipe (using pasteurized egg whites) and I definitely wouldn't use anything else!  Found that they tasted like pumpkin pie, but maybe even better.  Used a small ice cream scoop to make the cookies a regular size and filled using a ziploc bag with the corner cut off.  I baked them for about 10 minutes and they stayed very moist.

You've got to try this recipe!!  Moist & flavorful!  However I did not use the cream filling suggested.  Instead I made them with a cream cheese filling that was to die for!  Can't keep them in the house, they were gobbled up as quickly as I made them!

Yum, just got done making these. I made two different frosting recipes, because I didn't think I'd like this one. I ended up throwing both out. I finally decided to try making this one. I wish I had done that that to begin with! It went very well with the cakes. I gave this a four star because the flavor of the whoopie pies was really good, but not great. I will make them again, but will probably add some pumpkin spice along with the other ingredients. Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies were not a favourite of mine...but everyone who had one, loved them.  I think one with tea would be about all that I would want, but they didn't hang around long when I gave them as gifts.  Used a ounce sized ice cream scoop to pan and filled with buttercream icing.  Would make again...

A great recipe!!  The only change I made was to use traditional whoopie pie filling (using marshmallow fluff - look online for the recipe) instead of the filling in this recipe.  The end result was spectacular!!

This is the yummiest recipe that I have had for a wonderful pumpkin treat!  I have made 3 batches in less than a week and have given so many away to teachers and neighbors!  My kids keep eating all the extras!  I didn't alter the recipe but did use the 1c butter, mallowcreme and pdwrd sugar filling and it was awesome!  Everyone loved it and it was such a nice treat to give to people.  I am going to be making another batch tomorrow or the day after.  They are all gone again!  Oh-I used a small ice cream scoop to measure and make uniform cakes and sprayed the scoop with non-stick spray. Not great,but it helped.

This has got to be the BEST pumpkin whoopie pie recipe I’ve every made!!  I only made the cake part because I have a favorite cream cheese filling I’ve been using for years but the cakes were FANTASTIC!!  Moist and full of flavor.  This will be one of my go to recipes for family gatherings for years to come!!

This is a great recipe!  I made everything the way it was written, but would change the filling to either a cream cheese frosting or a marshmallow type filling, because of the amount of shortening.  But it was great, very yummy!

very good recipe and different from regular whoopie pies, I chose to make a cream chees frosting for the middle.  I was a little worried that the 1 tablespoon of cinnamon was a misprint but I used that amount and they turned out great. This recipe will be a new fall favorite ! :-)

Love love LOVE these! I’ve made them four or five times now and each time they get better and better!! The only tip I have is that you need to let the egg white beat until stiff white peaks form, otherwise the butter cream will be the wrong consistency.

These are a huge hit with our family, but we do prefer the traditional cream cheese filling. It's obviously much heartier than the fluffy version this makes, but the men in our family love them!

Oh man these were bangin! The pie shell itself was intensely pumpkin-y with loads of spicy goodness. Followed the recipe pretty closely; i didn’t have any cloves so i subbed pumpkin pie spices keeping all the others the same. I used a whole can of pumpkin (about 2 tbs more than a cup and a half). I scooped the batter with a cookie scoop and hit exactly 18 cookies. I used wet fingertips to mush down the tops so they’d be smooth. It worked really well. I baked them for 15 min also. For the filling i used someone else’s recommendation with shortening, marshmallow Creme and powdered sugar it was great tasting but a little soft/squishy. Def recommend giving these a go.

Make with butter rather than oil...because that's what I had on hand.  They were easy, came out great.  Tender, moist and yummy.  I'll make these again and again.

These are magical! I did make a few revisions because I was making it for my son's 3rd grade class. I pretty much halved all the spices, but if I were to have just made it for my family, I definitely would've kept the original amount. I added a bit of allspice, more pumpkin, more brown sugar (I wanted a denser "cookie"), and filled them with a cream cheese frosting. If you really care about consistency in shape and size, I scooped the batter into a whoopie pie/muffin top pan with a small cookie scoop and made sure to spread it out to the edges. They came out perfectly and everyone loved them.

I’m picky with pumpkin, and these were AMAZING!! I added chocolate chips, and didn’t do the sandwich thing, just cookies, everything else was true to the recipe. Also I baked for 10 minutes in northern Utah and they were perfect, if that helps anyone for timing

I'm going to make it for my school bake-off! It's healthy, yummy, and I can make it gluten-free! ( Which I need to do because I'm allergic to wheat )

The only change I make to these (and other baked goods) is to use Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 Gluten Free Flour in place of regular flour.  Large amounts of wheat flour don't sit well with me, so I'm still able to use my grandmother's filling (plus spices).  These are outstanding every time!

I thought I made this recipe as written but miss read the recipe.  I then made another batch, following the recipe, and everyone liked the mistake whoopie pies better.  In making the first batch, I added 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp ginger and cloves. The ingredient list says to add Tablespoons. Is this a mistake? I made my second batch with the tablespoons of spices and the whoopie pies were so strong in spice flavor. Noone could taste the punpkin flavor. In the future I will add teaspoons instead of tablespoons.

The cakes were delicious, I did decide to pipe them out because the batter spread unevenly. I used my own Whoopie Cake recipe for the filling, 1/2 c. butter, 1/2 c. Crisco, 1/2 c. Marshmallow creme, 1 c. powdered sugar. Also tried adding some cream cheese to the filling, which was pretty tasty. I will definitely be making these again.

These are soooo good! They were cooked to perfection in exactly 10 mins. I would definitely suggest a small ice cream scooper so all cookies are the same size.

The cookie itself was soft and moist, but I would have liked a bit more fall spice flavor in it. Will add more ginger and cloves next time. Overall, an appealing and delicious cookie.

I didn’t have any clove so used nutmeg instead and it was delicious. It’s a new family favorite. The video goes way to fast in places.

Recipe made 28 Whoopie Pies baked on parchment lined baking sheets. A 15oz. can of pumpkin puree is exactly 1 ½ cups. Whoopie Pie filling was just the right amount for the 28 pies. Food colors to color sugar filling. Piped filling with a pastry bag with tip #7. The only change for next time is substituting half of the shortening with butter.

The sugar from the filling  didn't dissolve, so I just made some flat meringue for that. My family said that the blend wasn't too sweet, nor too bland; It was just right. Thanks!

No changes needed to the cookie.
Everyone loved the softness of the cookie.
I did use Wilton decorating frosting which is always my go to filling for my family and friends.
Who knew pumpkin flavor was a year round favorite.

I used coconut sugar in the creme filling instead of the regular confectioner's sugar. Probably not going to do that again, the result was way sweeter than desired. Super good otherwise!

Made this today for a Halloween party - we are going as an Amish couple.  I filled them with the recommended Cream Cheese II icing. DELISH!!!
11/3/ update  - rave reviews from the host. She actually hid them from her family, they were so good.  LOL  Now how can I make these with chocolate?

Took the advice of another review - let batter sit for a bit and spread them a tad to shape.  PERFECT!!!

These were sooo delicious! This will be a new,  fall treat in our house,  for sure. I just need to evenly distribute better next time. I'll enjoy the practice, to be sure, lol. I used the maple cream cheese frosting recipe from this site as the filling,  and it took it to a whole other level.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe in my food service class, and I had 5 people come up and ask me for the recipe. I made it twice, and it tasted really good. It's perfect for people who don't have much of a sweet tooth, so anyone can enjoy.

these bake up so beautifully.  I used 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice in place of the individual spices.  for the filling, I beat the egg white to stiff peaks.  The filling was a beautiful consistency, much like buttercream, very light and fluffly.   I used my large size Pampered Chef cookie scoop to get uniform cookies.  The amount of filling is just perfect for the cookies.  I sprinkled some fall colored sprinkles on the edges to attach to the filling and they looked so pretty.  thanks for this wonderful recipe.  Will definitely make again.

The whoopie pies were excellent and I will make them again for sure.  Regarding the filling, there wasn't a clear indication of how stiff to beat the egg white - I beat  it to a soft peak stage and followed the directions the rest of the way. The filling stayed inside the 2 cookies beautifully.  I left a dozen as whoopless (singles w/out filling).  All were consumed by the end of intermission at a house concert I took them to.

Made these  yesterday and they are terrific.  Soft, cake-y cookie , great flavor.  I did use cream cheese instead of shortening in the filling.  Just could not make my self eat lard.  The kids at school thought they were great!

Being lactose intolerant, I used cashew milk and these were perfect: moist, sweet, and finger-licking good! My whole family loved them (including my picky eater).

I doubled the recipe for a bake sale fundraising for on of our sons, it was easy and so yummy! Used a 1" melon ball/cookie dough scoop for more precision sized/shaped cookies and they came out perfectly. 
I balled the dough onto parchment paper for easy lift and cooked for 11.5 min per baking sheet full. The frosting is perfect consistency and also VERY easy to make. Whipped my whites to soft peaks before adding other ingredients. Delish!

Make these every Thanksgiving because my nieces and nephews beg for it.  They are very delicious without being overly sweet.  My only complaint would be that they become very moist and sticky, but it doesn't seem to bother anyone.

I love this recipe. I'll be honest and say I've never actually made the filling, so my review is essentially only for the cookies/cakes (cakies?) themselves.  Once I had a bite of the cakie, I realized they were perfect the way they are. Sure, I realize that doesn't really make them a whoopie pie, but it doesn't make them any less delish. They are so tasty and moist. Not overly pumpkiny, but a spicy in all the right ways flavor.  And since I had the confectioner's sugar out, I usually finish the cakies with a light dusting of the delicious c-sug, and call it a day.

I have a friend who LOVES pumpkin and I took her a batch while she was sick and she ate 10 cakies in one day.  With a cuppa (tea or coffee, your choice), it's amazing.

This is the second time making these for me.  They are just delicious and everyone raves about them!  The first time I made a batch I didn’t let the cookie mixture set and the first half weren’t shaped as well.  Once you mix the cookie mix let it sit for 10-15 mins and it will stiffen up.  I purchased mini Whoopi’s pie pans off amazon.  At first I thought they were too small but the size is perfect!  Used with a cookie scoop made these a breeze!

I've made these every year for the last four and taken them to fall festivals and events, and now I get regular requests for them. I follow the recipe as is for the cookies, but use a slightly different one for the icing: 2 egg whites, beaten stiff, 2 tsp. vanilla, 4 T. flour, 1 c. butter, 4 tsp. milk, and 2 c. powdered sugar. The combination is amazing! Best cookies ever!

I love making whoopie pies and this recipe did not disappoint. I made a batch to take to work for a Halloween potluck. Apparently, it did not take long for all of them to disappear. On top of that, I got rave reviews from many of my coworkers. I'll be making them again soon, so more of my coworkers can enjoy.

I liked the flavor, but cookies did not flatten so could be iced evenly. Too much like a round ball.

Made these for the first time for a Halloween party over the weekend. I don't usually eat pumpkin stuff but these were awesome! Instead of the filling in the recipe I made a maple cream cheese frosting that I read about in one of the comments. I cut the recipe in half and it made about 15 whoopee pies. Everybody loved them!!!

I'm not a baker, but these were easy and delicious and they looked so pretty.  I followed the recipe exactly. My batter was a little stiff, so the cookies kept the whirl shape from piping.  They got rave reviews at the housewarming I took them to.  Might try one of the different fillings next time, this one is super sweet. They had a nice moist spongy texture. So much flavor from the spices. Baked them for 10 minutes and they were perfect.

I am giving this a 4 because I am not finished with them.  I will fill them on turesday.  However they came out sooo good thus far.  Easy to make.  Put batter in a zip lock bag and they really are all one size.  I think I am going to make the maple cream cheese filling that another reader suggested.  
Again...thank you all recipe.

Absolutely LOVED these!! The recipe makes a ton. I think I ended up with about 3 dozen fully assembled whoopie pies. I’m not mad about that though - more to share with friends and family. I did decide to make half of my pies with a cream cheese based filling. I thought the confectioners sugar and shortening filling called for in this recipe was a bit sweet, but still very very good. Overall, I’m absolutely positive I’ll be baking these for years to come!

Super scrumptious as written in the recipe.  I also loved adding the zest of about half an orange into the white cream filling.  The little citrus kick was wicked good.

I don't generally rate the recipes I try on here but talk about ADDICTING!!   These cookies are so good you won't be able to stop eating them.  I didn't make the filling as of yet because my husband and I love the cookies just as they are!  I highly suggest trying them!

Perfect whoopie pie recipe. I didn't change anything about the pies. For the filling, I used a can of vanilla frosting and mixed it with 8oz of cream cheese, cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger to taste. So yummy!

love pumpkin whoopie  pies. I mix the dough and let it set pre haet oven when I have finished mixing  ingredients together. I let the cookies cool competley  before putting filling between two cookies to form a sandwich. I wrap each whoopie with plastic wrap. these travel and keep very well . we take them fishing in the bush in cananda.

These were delicious! The only problem with them was entirely my own fault. They were just way too huge to make a double cookie so I just iced each one separately and left it at that. That's just more icing per cookie. Also cookies were more of a consistency of cake rather than muffins. Still delicious.

Reduced the ground cloves to half a teaspoon instead of half a tablespoon and they turned out perfect. Very moist, and the filling makes you go for seconds and thirds!

I made these & brought to work, my boss made me hide them as  he couldn't stop eating them (he ate 3 within 5 minutes).  my coworkers,  loved them too  they didn't last long.  I  buy extra cans of pumpkin to keep on hand so an make over & over  nice soft cookie.  I add some of the spices to the cream filling to bump up the flavor.  this is a great cook for any time of the year

These were a total hit over thanksgiving. My MIL actually drove back to our house the next day to take more home.   I let the batter sit a bit as suggested before baking. I made the filling as listed in the recipe but it seemed to be needing a little salt. I did notice that after a night in the refrigerator the filling tasted much better so not sure if I will try with a little salt next time or not.

Delicious!  I substituted the filling with 8oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, 1 tsp vanilla & 1 1// cups confectioners sugar.  I also sprinkled the tops, before baking, with chopped walnuts. Next time I make them I will reduce the sugar because my filling is sweet. 
I found waiting a few mins before scooping helps because batter thickens.  They do spread so space is a must. 
Thank you for the recipe!

I loved the cookie part. I substituted premixed pumpkin pie spice (1 tbsp) and it turned out amazing.

For the filling, I substituted cream cheese for shortening. I'm not a vanilla filling fan...and it turned out delicious!

Definitely a recipe I'll keep and share!

This is a keeper.  Just got done making these and they are delicious.  Sitting here with a cup of tea and my whoppie pie.  Husband likes them too.  Been looking for a good recipe since we visited King Arthur in Vermont.  They had delicious whoppie pies.  This recipe  is as good.  The only thing I did differently was I added about a half teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to the icing.  Yummy!

I followed the instructions near perfectly  (except I added a whole 15 once can of pumpkin) and this made a great tasting moist cookie, but I did find one major problem--for me at least. The baking time as written (10 minutes) was far from accurate and left me with underdone and doughy cookies. I baked them on a nonstick whoopie pie pan and used a tablespoon sized cookie scoop. That size needed about 17 minutes at 350° and it still came out really moist. I needed wax paper to keep them from sticking to each other or the plate I stored them on. I highly recommend always baking a tiny sample amount first when trying a new recipe. This recipe as written made nearly 40 whoopie pies for me. Note: I DID NOT make the filling on this recipe, just the cookie. I bought a pre-made whipped frosting and that worked just fine.

This recipe is rediculous- they taste just like pumpkin pie (possibly better?!?!)
The only change I made was adding an extra half cup of flour. I read reviews before baking and I agree that the batter seemed a touch thin- 1/2 cup extra was plenty & the mix did seem to thicken while sitting in between batches.
The entire family loves them & I am excited to share them this holiday season!

Made these for a bake sale fundraiser.  They were gone very quickly, so I made another batch for the next day, which went just as quickly.  Made a third batch, and were gone within a couple of hours.  Have had several requests for the recipe!

me and my friend were going to make these to sell for a yard sale. We were following the recipe exactly as shown and then i get to the spices. For some reason i got the ginger measurements and the cinnamon measurements mixed up and i did 1 1/2 tbl. of ginger!!  But we still went on with it and surprisingly that still tasted good! In fact they tasted great! So the cookies turned out awesome and the rose great. Then we get to the filling part. I didn't want to use shortening so i used butter because i thought it would taste better. It tasted really good but it was a mess! so if you want perfect looking pies than use shortening. But if you don't care about looks i recommend butter:D

Made exactly to the recipe, I thought these were quite nice. The only thing was I had to bake them longer than the instructions. The icing isn't sweet and compliments the cookie well although I ended up with way too much left over icing. I would make these again.

These came out really good! I only did a few things differently.  I used my own pureed pumpkin, sunflower oil, and I made a cream cheese frosting. Be careful when you put them on the pan because a small dollop goes a long way!

So I used my own pumpkin puree and it didn't worked out. The batter turned out to be too thin, so I had to use muffin cups instead. But it was tasty anyway.

I can only rate the cookie, but they are awesome!! We liked them a lot. I followed someone's advice of spooning the batter into a Ziploc and cutting the corner, I then spiraled the circles onto parchment paper and cooked for 12 minutes. Mine did not have the moisture that others described where they stick to everything like waxed paper or your fingers, they were perfect. They are very good for eating alone or making a whoopee pie, although I think I like them better alone.  Thank you. My husband was eating some store bakery pumpkin cookies that were full of whatever goes in there. I feel better about him eating homemade.

the only thing I did different was the filling......cheated and used bought cake icing. Wasn't impressed with the flavor and thought they were too dense. I would like for them to be more cake like.

This recipe is fantastic! The cookies are so moist and the icing is just perfect. I recommend waiting a few minutes before baking to let the batter thicken up because that made the cookies rounder and nicer looking. I will definitely be making these again.

Loved it but not going to be making them for a while because I made around 225 actual whoopie pies frosting and all for a catering order.

I've searched for a recipe for Pumpkin Whoopie Pies that matched a family member and this one hit the mark.  They were super moist and beyond delicious.  Great just as they are.

Absolute perfection! Everyone is raving about them. I used a cream cheese frosting instead but that was personal preference. I've made them a few times and each time they turn out delicious.

These tasted great!!! (And pretty easy) I was a little worried at first because the batter/dough was a little soupy. But if you let it set for a few minutes it firms up a bit. Definitely making these again!

I made the cookie exactly as caked for, but let the batter sit for 10-15 minutes. It is a very sticky batter and can be a little frustrating,  but these were amazing. Planned on making the filling, but never got to it since most of them were gone in an instant. They are super fluffy, almost like a cake cookie. Absolutely Amazing and always get rave reviews on them!

This recipe produced the perfect pumpkin whoopie pie!  I made exactly as the recipe stated except I only used 1/4 tbsp. of cloves due to personal preference.  It does have quite a bit of spice - it still was a little too much clove for us.   They cake part was unbelievably moist and flavorful! I thought I would prefer a cream cheese filling, but, decided to go with the filling in the recipe.   It was light and very fluffy and traditional to a whoopie pie.   I am glad I chose to stick with the recipe.   This would have easily have been a five star recipe for me with the reduction of some additional cloves. 
  Thanks for the recipe!

These are amazing. The only change is that I use a cream cheese filling. We even made them as wedding favors for 125 guest. They come out great everytime. Sometimes if I don't have cloves or ginger I will substitute allspice. Definitely will continue to make over and over

Great recipe. I make my own fresh pumpkin. Split & seed a Sugar Pumpkin, place in a deep baking pan, add water and bake @325 until shell gets tender when press with a fork. Cool and put through a foley food mill. I pack in zip lock freeze bags by the cupfuls.

Can't tell you how many times I've made these!  My niece needed something for a church tea so I made a batch for her to take.  She called me and said the women raved about them.  I use a small scoop to make them, I don't use the filling recipe, however.  I make a cream cheese filling.  These are to die for!!

This is a great recipe!! The cookies where perfect on how they raised and the way they tasted.. The only thing I did differently was instead of cloves(I do not like cloves) I added nutmeg. I also use the cream cheese II recipe that's on here.. Cream cheese frosting makes such a difference..

I made this for a tailgate party! Fun!  I put batter into small egg shaped cake molds. I really loved the texture and flavor of the cakes but I wished I would have taken other's suggestions and made a cream cheese filling.  After baking in the egg shape I let cool and split in half, added filling and then replaced the top to form football shape. I decorated by putting filling in a plastic baggie and snipping off just a tiny bit of the corner to squeeze icing out of. It had been suggested to use a toothpick to help your lines on the football but I did not have one, and I think it would have helped. All in all they were delicious and fun! I'll be making these again but switching to cream cheese icing for sure. I used dark brown sugar to make the appearance look more like a football too:)

Absolutely delicious, even after being frozen. Very soft, moist, and flavorful. Used Tasty Kitchen's 'The Best Frosting Ever' recipe for filling. Great recipe, loved it! Thanks

Very good!  I didn't have any ground cloves, so I used 2 1/2 tblsp of pumpkin pie spice in place of the seperate spices.  As other reviewers said, these do not spread at all, so make them whatever size you want the finished product to be.  Used my own filling recipe which worked fine, but I think next time I'll try a cream cheese one.  Oldest son who hates pumpkin pie, is not a fan of chake, or whoopie pies, absoutely loves these.

Instead of greasing the cookie sheets, just put a piece of parchment paper on cookie sheet. Also, when I made other whoopie pies, I wrapped them in wax paper individually and placed in the freezer for storage.

These are wonderful!  Although, I admit I have yet to finish making them, I know they will be delicious.  I will be making "Cream Cheese Frosting II" from this site. The reviews were correct in that they essentially bake in the same form that they're placed on the sheet.  So, after using a mini-2-tsp cookie scoop, I dampened my finger and flattened out each cookie and thinned it out a bit.  I used a stone cookie sheet, and baked for 12 minutes.  This made 54 pies (or 108 halves).  Very fluffy, and very delicious!  Can't wait to taste the final product!!!

I used just a teaspoon of ginger and a teaspoon of cloves which was plenty.  I also used 2 cups of unbleached flour and 1 cup of cake flour instead of regular all purpose flour.  They turned out extrememly light and fluffy.

My kids love these.  Always begging me to make them, and they are very picky about desserts.  I use a cream cheese frosting for the filling.

This was my first time making whoopie pies, an overall sucess I think!
The big thing that I did was I actually made these pumpkin- cocoa whoopie pies by adding between 1/4-1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and a handful of white sugar. The cookies themselves came out very well. The texture reminded me so much of a devil dog, which I love! 
The filling was a bit scary for me because I never have had much sucess with whipping, though it came out pretty well. The big dilemma that I ran into was that the filling was way, way, way too sweet for my preference. To balance it out I started adding some nutmeg, pumpkin pie spice, and cinnamon. While I put the nutmeg away after about 1/4-1/2 teaspoon, I think that I might have added at least a tablespoon or two of cinnamon and about half as much pumpkin pie spice. The spices were still understated though helped balance out the sweetness a bit. 
When I assembled I found that I ran out of filling with three sandwiches left. Maybe I used too much, though according to pictures of how much cream you see in the middle, I think I might have gone a little bit light. 
Overall, good recipe!

I really like these cookies. Though I did find that you must be careful not to stack them on top of each other. They are so moist they will stick together.

These are moist and delicious.  If you're not a huge fan of the spices, I'd cut down the amount of cloves that you use and maybe reduce the ginger slightly as well.  If you like a lot of filling, I'd make 1 1/2 - 2 of the recipe for the filling.  I got about 20-22 whoopie pies (40-44 cookies) out of it (some were small), and I had just enough filling for them--some had only a very thin layer.  Otherwise, they were fun to make and very tasty.

I made these for a work party and they turned out really well.  I used my cook TBS cookie scoop as many recommended and it made the job very easy.  I used parchment paper and baked them for about 12 minutes each.  I also used the cream cheese frosting recipe.  All told, it was a smidge sweet for me, but as much as I have a sweet tooth I prefer things that are not cloying this sweet.  If I could deduct half a start for that I would.  Next time I'll cut the sugar in the frosting and the cake by 1/2 each and I'm sure I will personally like them even more.

Also, I set them up after they cooled and put them in tupperware in the fridge overnight.  In the morning they were perfect, and didn't even stick to each other.  This is part of why this recipe is so successful!

I love this recipe. The first time I made them I made them exactly how the recipe was and entered them in a fall cookie bake off and won first place! The second time I made them I did not have any cloves so I used nutmeg instead. I also used the cream cheese II recipe from this site for the filling. I have a gas stove and bake them at 12 minutes and they come out perfect! The hardest part is not eating all the cookies as they come out of the oven, they are delicious!

I  make the chocolate version all the time. I wanted to try these to make something seasonal. I make a different filling for whoopie pies using Marshmallow Fluff (takes uncooked egg whites out of the equation), shortening and powdered sugar (the ratio is 1:1:1) I enjoyed these but think that I would lessen the Marshmallow Fluff by 1/2 and add the same in the form of softened or whipped cream cheese to enhance the  flavor/texture. I think that would pair nicely w/ the pumpkin.

These are amazing. I use a pastry bag with a large round tip to make the cookies the same shape and size. I try to avoid using shortening whenever possible so I used a cream cheese frosting for the filling instead.

Just perfect!  I have searched and tried several different recipes-this one came out perfect the first time.  I have already made them three times in one week-two for  home and one for my coworkers who have requested recipe.  We have all been trying to find the recipe of the ones we used to get from a lady in Maine who no longer makes and sells them.  We are thrilled to have found a great recipe. Like all other reviews, use the cream cheese filling of your choice.   They look just like the photos but taste even better. Thanks for the great recipe.

After making tons of pumpkin puree today, I thought I would try the Pumpkin Whoopie Pies.  OMG, I am so glad I did!  On recommendation from other reviewers, I did let the batter sit for 10 minutes, but I think I will go a little longer next time.  This did help the cookies not spread as much.  I also used a cookie scoop.  I did not grease the baking sheets on the first batch of cookies.  They were a little harder to get off than the sprayed pans.  The first batch had rounded sides, but I noticed that additional batches had a little crispier edge.  I really think next time I will let the pans cool much more between batches.  My husband, who loves sweets, said he will only be able to each one of these per day! I didn't have enough filling for the amount of cookies I had, but the cookies by themselves are great also!  My grandson will love these!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic cookies.  I brought them for my co-workers and they made me very popular.  I, like other reviewers, used a 2T cookie scoop for uniform cookies, and Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site in place of the filling.  I also added nutmeg to round out the pumpkin pie spices.  I will absolutelym make them again.

Excellent! And very easy - I don't know why I waited so long to make these.  Only change for the cookie was to use my own Pumpkin Pie Spice Blend, which includes cinnamon, ginger, cloves, but also nutmeg, allspice and mace.  Used my small cookie scoop to measure out the batter.  The cookies bake up nice and soft and cakey - perfect whoopie pie material!  I added a half tsp orange extract and another 1/2 cup confectioner's sugar to the filling mixture to get the flavor and consistency I was looking for.  Very pretty and tasty treats!

These were exceptionally tastey.  Instead of the whoopie icing, i used cream cheese icing II from this site.  It was wonderful.  My only complaint is that the pumpkin part sticks to plates and things and eventually falls apart.  But I guess I really shouldn't be complaining about how amazingly moist they are, haha.

Great! Threw in about 4oz of cream cheese into filling. Other than that I followed the recipe. They were fab!

This recipe has become one of my families favorit fall cookies. We follow the recipe as is with one exception, we put cinnamon and nutmeg in the filling for extra flavor.

These tasted very commercial to me. Maybe it was the shortening. But I gave them as a gift and the receiver was pleased. I did have an allergic reaction on my fingers after spooning out the dough though, so I only made one batch! :(

This is a good recipe, but I make the filling without the shortening. I use instead: cream cheese, butter, cinnamon and confectioners sugar. The cookie base is very tasty though, and moist!

This is a great way to use canned pumpkin and spices other than in a pie. Our tasters loved it. The icing was good and perfect for the "Gobs". We also thought cream cheese icing would be yummy too.

Fantastic! I hate pumpkin pie but wanted something traditional for Thanksgiving dessert...these fit the bill and were enjoyed by everyone, inlcuding me! Can't wait to make them again. Added a softened block of cream cheese to filling - YUM!

These were easy to make and very tasty.  My picky 10yo son asked me half-way through baking "what smells so good?"!  He couldn't wait to try the first one and he loved it.  My Mom liked it, too. The cake was moist and spiced just right.  I used a pastry bag to shape the batter onto the cookie sheet so they came out looking pretty and they kept their shape perfectly.  As far as the filling goes...I could take it or leave it.  The filling seemed a bit too soft when I made it so I put it in the fridge for 30 minutes and then used an icing bag to frost the cakes.  The filling still seemed too soft to be bitten down on between two pieces of cake.  I have them in the fridge now and will see what they are like later tonight.  Either way, I will make these again, but I may play with the filling recipe a bit.

Great recipe! I did substitute pumpkin pie spice for the spices, and used a cream cheese filling. The cookie stayed nice and high without spreading and being flat. This is definitely a keeper.

have not made these yet but they look great. I was wondering if you must use shortening in the filling for them to be authentic whoopie pies cause that is what ive heard.  I usually use butter in my fillings and frostings let me know :)

Very yummy and easy!  When I first tasted the filling, I thought it was not flavorful enough but once you put it on the cookies, it is just perfect.  I'll definitely be making these again and again!

This was a very good recipe! My family and I loved them, but when my Mom and I mixed the ingredients together, we added 3/4 Tsp of McCormick's Pumpkin Pie Spice, to give the whoopie pies a more "pumpkin" flavor. This was a very delicious and fun dessert :)

These are the best!! My family all loved these and begged for seconds. I took other reviews advice and also used a  different filling, equal parts cream cheese, margarine, and marshmallow creme, mixed with an electric mixer until smooth and then added powdered sugar until it tasted sweet enough.

Used only the filling recipe and it was great.  for the shortening portion I used 1/2C marg, 1/4C shortening and also added 1/2 a tub of marshmellow cream and let it all whip up.

I was hoping these would resemble the chocolate whoopie pies I make, and they didn't.  They were too cakey.  In fact, they didn't even taste like pumpkin.  I don't like shortening frosting, so I mixed a can of store-bought cream cheese frosting  with a jar of marshmallow creme for the filling.  They tasted kind of like carrot cake.  My boyfriend liked them, which is the only reason this gets four stars.

We loved these at work-everyone went quickly. However, I did substitute a cream cheese filling since I'm not fond of shortening fillings. Will definitely make again (for my kids this time).

These were so awesome! I was afraid they would be too rich but they were really light. I recommend eating them fresh, but if you have to store them use an airtight container and layer with paper towels to keep them from getting sticky.

Thanks so much for this!!  I had a cookie while making the batches and it actually saved me from having a low blood sugar.  They were WONDERFUL!  My husband had to comment on the filling...he said it was wonderful consistancy and fluffy.  One of his favorites! We will make this again in the near future! Thanks for sharing this with us!

taste great really moist. they don't spread out any while baking so how you drop them on the pan is how they come out. I used cream cheese frosting for the middle.

I'm getting ready to make them again...the first time I made them everyone who tasted them said,"Those are delicious!"  I agree, very yummie.
