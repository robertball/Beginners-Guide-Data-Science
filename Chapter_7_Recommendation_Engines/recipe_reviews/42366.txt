These are so good and are always a hit at parties. I've been making these for years and my husband just loves them. Be sure not to use too much onion. Chop it finely or grate it so it doesn't overpower the other ingredients. I use about 1/3 of a cup. People can't seem to get enough....

Okay, so I thought the directions were a little vague. Or, I'm just slow. I ended up taking two packages of the crescent rolls and making twelve pastry bowls. I was able to fit the ham mixture into the twelve pastry bowls, minus the onion. I also added 1 tbsp. of mayonnaise to the ham mixture to get it to stick together better.(My kids don't care for onion and I'm not eating any, so I omitted it.) I'll update how the family liked them after dinner. EDITED: When I made them in the way I did, they turned out like muffins. They were inhaled by my husband and kids, though I think they would make a better breakfast food this way. I'll make them again.

I made these for a party once and now I'm asked to bring them everywhere I go.  I left out the onion because I'm not a big fan of onions and it still turns out wonderful.

I left out the onion, and these were a big hit at an appetizer-only party. I thought they were much better fresh out of the oven than later when they cooled down. They did strike me as "kid food," but everyone seemed to like them.

Very good flavor. I needed to use up leftover ham from the holidays, so I used leftover spiral ham added some fresh crispy bacon chopped, a bit of red pepper flakes and a bit more pepper. I like it spicy! I only got 12 mini's instead of 24. I used too much filling in each cup. So the leftover crescent roll dough I formed over the top of each cup to make a filling stuffed bread ball. Superb, wife could not stop eating them. Thanks for the recipe it is now in my recipe box. AA++

Very good! I've made this several times and the way I make it is: double the filling (not the onion), add a few shots of hot sauce, 1/2 tsp garlic salt, and I use biscuits. The small kind with 10 in a can. I press them into a cup shape, fill them with about 2 tbsp of filling and bake for about 15 minutes at 375. Delicious! Update: I've made these a lot and I use whatever cheese I have on hand, and sometimes add another egg if we're extra hungry. :)

This was surprisingly excelent. I make them on Sunday and my family snacks on them all week. I also sometimes use the refrigerated biscut dough and cut each biscut in three thinner biscuts because I find this easier than cutting and forming triangles.

Quite good!  I made these for a Christmas Eve party and they were gobbled up fast!  I admittedly didn't measure any of the ingredients but used all the same ingredients.  The best part is that you can eat these room temperature so you don't have to worry about serving them hot.  Will definitely use this again.  Maybe try cheddar next time.  Turkey.  Etc.  Thanks for a versatile snack!

Easy and delicious.  I received many compliments and will make again.  I would use 1/4 to 1/3 cup chopped onion so the onion isn't so overpowering.  I couldn't find Dijon mustard so I used spicy musturd.  It was a hit!

I used the pie crust IV recipe from the site instead of crescent dough. I rolled out to about half an inch thickness, cut circles out of the dough with a circle shaped cookie cutter, and placed them into regular sized muffin tins (they looked like mini pies). I baked at 350 for approx 25 minutes until lightly browned. My boyfriend and his sis devoured them all in less than a day... I made 16 of them!

These were very simple and quite yummy! I actually didn't make enough! The kids didn't like the ham so I think next time I'll try bacon or maybe even chicken but they were easy! I used shredded mexican cheese so I think whatever your favorite cheese is would be good in this!

These are a great party app.  I use shredded Colby Jack and green onion and they are always a big hit. So easy to make.

These were very good, and the mustard is not overpowering!  My husband and I loved them.  I took them to a party and barely made it home with any because my friends kept coming back for the few that were left as I was going out the door!  One note - I could only get about 1 tsp. into each of the little dough cups, but it was plenty of flavor!  Otherwise, didn't change a thing!

I left the onion out but still they turned out just fine. One 8oz crescent roll was not enough so i was only able to make 12 puffs. How can i make 24 puffs out of one 8 oz roll?

After making it the way it was written I tried a variation. We wanted a bit more flavor so I used chopped pepperoni, italian spices and some hot sauce. That way it was good and I'll keep trying different combinations. It's a good recipe to play with and add what you like.

My kids aren't egg lovers and I decided to try this recipe on them for breakfast.  The girls didn't notice the egg in them.  I didn't really measure the ingredients, just sort of mixed it together.  Although I love onion, I thought there was too much.  I omitted the mustard and used mayo since this was going to be eaten for breakfast.  I also slightly secured the top corners of the crescent and they turned out almost like stuffed muffins.  The kids, my husband, and I really liked these.  I can't wait to try them again with mustard.  I like these better than the breakfast pies I made from this site.  By using the crescent rolls vs. biscuits allows for more filling in the middle.

These were so great! I am desperately looking for new ham recipes to use up Christmas leftovers. I just came upon this and whipped it up in just a few minutes and my husband and I were so happy! I only used ham and cheddar because it was all I had on hand. Thanks for sharing!

These were good. I made them ahead of time and kept them in the fridge, then popped them in the oven half an hour before the party. (I topped them with a few pieces of chopped red and green pepper to make them look festive for our Christmas party.)  There were only 2 or 3 left at the end of the night, so I have to assume they were a hit. Easy to make, too. Will definitely make these again.

Very easy to make with what I had on hand.  I had ham left over from the Holidays.  I used about 2 1/2 cups of chopped ham.  I tried two batches - one for the kids just as the reciped is and then added red pepper flakes for the adults.  Both turned out great.  I used dried onions that I bought at Costco (1/4 cup).  If I chop onions up next time I may add garlic.  I think that chopped jalapenos would also be a good addition.

These were a huge hit. Made 96 of them, first batch I made as the recipe called for.  I would agree with the other reviews and mince 1/4c onions,  up ham and cheese to 3/4c each. Yum!

We really enjoyed these.  I used the reduced fat cresent rolls (roll out each 1/2 of the tube and then cut down the center length wise, cut that into 12 pieces).  I only used 1/2 a large onion chopped very finely.  I used regular yellow mustard (don't care for dijon) and this was very tasty.  I think it would make a great appetizer as well as the breakfast we are eating as I type this!

Excellent.  I used slab bacon since I did not have ham.  Took them to work and they disappeared!  Easy and just darn tasty.  Cannot just eat one!  This is a keeper for certain.

We liked these. I used a regular sized muffin pan and they came out like little ham and cheese topped dinner rolls. I used a couple Tbsp. of dried onions instead of fresh ones.

These were pretty good, but did not "wow" me.  However, some of my overnight guests enjoyed the leftovers as a late night snack.  Next time I will try them with biscuit mix, an extra egg and more cheese.

Yum!!!  The minor changes I made were:  cheddar not swiss, made 12 large not 24 small, and cut WAY back on the egg because I don't like egg and wasn't sure if it would be eggy tasting.  I threw in a bit of mayo--again, personal preference.  Very easy to throw together and delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

I used pepper jack and cheddar as my husband doesn't care for swiss and they turned out great! Everyone loved them! Great snack at room temp too. Thanks for the great post!

Really great. Everyone here liked it, but next time I might cut back on the onion a bit or use spring onions instead -- they'd add a nice dash of color to which would be an extra bonus.

My family raved about these.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.  I thought I was going to have an issue getting them out of the pan, but with a little "coaxing" they popped out fairly well.  Excellent recipe

Excellent and quick!  I had left over ham and was looking for something to do with it.  I avoided going to the store with a few substitutions.  Shallots instead of onion, Colby Jack & Monterey shredded cheese, and dab of cream cheese, just cuz i like it:).  Very Tasty and next time i'll make the actual recipe. Although i might keep the shallots:)  Thank you!

I used 1/4 tsp onion powder because I don't like chopping onions. A Mexican mix cheese (colby, cheddar, and mozzarella). I also added 3 tsp half-n-half, and forgot to add the pepper. These came out very nice.

These are really tasty!  My kids were not huge fans but my husband and I loved them!  Husband went back for more which is very unusual!  I used leftover ham steak but should have cut it in smaller pieces.  Four out of five stars because the croissant thing was kind of vague.  I had to purchase another tube of croissant rolls and mine were not the prettiest.  These would be great for a potluck breakfast.

liked this a lot. i was a little short on swiss so added some cheader as well. I also sauted (sp) the onion as some of the comments said onion was strong and I added some garlic with the onion and wilted some spinich that need to be used up in with it. I let that cool then added it to the ham and cheese mustard and a bit of mayo plus egg mix. I am making again tonight for a party and doing half of them meat free by uping the spinich, onion and garlic. they keep well and reheat in microwave well - but best hot out of oven.

Needed some garlic or something. Way too bland for me but they did cook and set well. I might try them with some sausage or something a bit spicier next time. My teens devoured them.

Like another review posted, I think the instructions are a little vague. To divide the dough into more or less equal portions, I just cut, with kitchen scissors, the tube of rolled dough in half. I took one half and cut into 12 discs then did the same with the other half. I pressed the discs into the bottoms and up the sides of the muffin cups. I think the only thing I would do differently is chop the ham and onion even smaller, and add some spices. The taste is a little too plain for me.

Couldn't keep these on the table at all!  Had to make more in the middle of a party to keep people happy!  I didn't use the onion; used cheddar instead of swiss; used spicy brown mustard, and then used a mini-loaf tray with some of the roll dough on top of each one.  They came out like mini breakfast breads.  Yum!
