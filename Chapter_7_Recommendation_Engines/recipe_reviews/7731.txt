I soaked the fruit mixture in bourbon overnight for a little extra kick. Yummy. Has a lighter texture than traditional fruitcake but still dense enough to satisfy my husband's fruitcake  craving.

I was going to add this recipe, but checked to see if it was already listed. Yep, it was. I love the consistency of this bread, the crust is lovely, and have made it many times using different fruit. This week I'll use coconut, dried mango, and pinepple--whatever I find in the dried fruit gorcery section.
This bread is not sticky, so mails well, keeps well & freezes well. My Brother in California loves it!  I don't like fruitcake, but this is wonderful!  You'll need a large mixing bowl, the batter will be thick, and I cook it in 2 loaf pans!

I have been making it for many years since I found it in All recipes, there is no way you can get it wrong.  I love the moisture and the versatility, I just use any fruits I have everytime and it always turns out great.

This cake is ligther and in my opinion better than the traditional christmas fruitcake. I added a cup of currants, and baked it in a bundt pan. Had to cook an extra ten minutes, but otherwise no changes to the recipe. Next time I will add more cherries(my wife likes lots of cherries). I will make this again.

I made it half the quantities and it was absolutely great! It baked perfectly in the oven and tastes just great! I loved it and so did my parents I strongly recommend this easy to bake cake. Also, I dont know if this had any influence but I put a bowl of water in the oven with the cake. I heard it keeps the cake from getting burnt.
