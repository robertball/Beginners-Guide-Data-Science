I added a can of corn to this and I precooked the pasta before mixing it in. I also precooked the bacon and drained it then added it crumbled to the ground beef mixture while it was cooking. This rated high with my family.

This is a great, easy recipe.  I had a little spicy bulk sausage in the fridge so I browned that with the onion and used canned tomatoes with jalapenos, nice kick!  This has become a weekly dish in our home.

I made this dish once before exactly as it was written, but my husband and I were not super impressed - it tasted quite watery and a little bland.  However, I made it tonight with a few changes - I left out the water completely, I used a 28oz. can of diced tomatoes with the juice, and a 14 oz. can of tomato sauce.  It was delicious!!

This was very good.  Reminded me of the "spanish rice" my mother used to make back in the 50's. I divided it since I cook for just myself, but still have alot of leftovers.  I would use less water - maybe just the juice from the can of diced tomatoes as it seemed like I cooked it down simply to get rid of that excess moisture. I sprinkled some shredded parmesan cheese on the top of my serving - very good.
Served with a side salad this was easy, filling and good.

Great, simple and nutritious (especially if you choose your bacon carefully!).  I didn't add the 2.5 cups water...found it unnecessary.  I added a can of drained kidney beans for flavour and to boost the nutritional value.  It was yummy...the kids loved it.

Good, in a pinch for something to make, however the flavor was just okay.  I added some garlic and that seemed to help.

This is a very tasty recipe.  I cut the recipe in half and it still made enough to feed a family of four or five.  I also did not use as much water as the recipe said.  I will definately make this again.

Ladybug, I thought the same thing when I read the reviews... 
This is really good.  I personally can't imagine making it weekly because of the amount of bacon - it's not the healthiest meal ever... The thing I love about it is how well it reheats.  It tastes much better the next day, and this is important because it makes a ton! Thanks for the recipe, we'll make it again (probably with healthier bacon).

This was ABSOLUTELY delicious! I used a can of Italian Style diced tomatos that was already spiced with garlic and basil. Then as an extra I topped it off with some Italian Style shredded cheese. This is totally a meal I will crave. Big hit with my husband too!

This was a great recipe!  I did not need the water, the tomatoes provided enough eventhough they were drained.  I also forgot to cut the bacon into pieces before I cooked it, made it a little harder.

I thought this was really good. It reminded me of something my mom used to make. I used less bacon than called for and less water. It was great!

This made a truly wonderful meal and my family loved the flavor of the bacon.
I made this a second time and I did make a few adjustments. I made a half of recipe just to try. I used stewed tomatoes in place of diced and added some green pepper. A lot of my family love stewed tomatoes and green peppers so I thought they would also like it this way and they did.

I made this tonight for dinner and my family really enjoyed it.  I did add some fresh garlic and some basil.  Unlike other reviewers, I had very little leftover but I am feeding three teenagers who went back for seconds.  I will add this to my favorites for a quick and easy meal.  Thanks!

No Ladybug, you're not confused; someone else is. Not only is there no beef in this recipe, but neither is there sausage. Cook your pasta while the sauce is simmering. Serve the sauce over the pasta or just mix it in. Your choice.

This was okay - had to doctor it up a lot because it was kind of bland. I added garlic and Italian seasonings and that helped but it still needed something. Finally added some Cajun Andouille Sausage and then it was good! I only added about 1/2 cup water and let it simmer. Probably won't make it again; its very much like another recipe that I've used for years as comfort food.

This is very similar to a dish my mother made. She made it very much like Juliebu's variation--leave out the water and add drained kidney beans. My mother used spaghetti instead, but I liked it with the shells. Also used more onion in addition to kidney beans. Definitely tastes better the next day!

The sauce had good flavor, but I think I must have done something wrong because the sauce never thickened. It was really watery. My family doesn't like onion, so I used garlic instead. Maybe that contributed to my problem?

I made this tonight and thought it was just okay.  The sauce was bland so I added italian seasoning, garlic powder and a bit of sugar to cut the tomato sauce acid.  Using bacon instead of ground beef for a pasta dinner was a good idea and it was a quick and easy meal.  I probably won't make it again though.

I wasn't that impressed with this recipe.  Reading the other reviews had me hoping for something wonderful, but it was just OK.  My husband (who will eat pretty much anything) was not blown away with it.  And I had LOTS of it left over.

Nice, easy and quick.  Quicker if you don't add water that you have to cook down--I didn't add any water, just didn't drain the can of tomatoes.  I halved this recipe, used mini wheels (couldn't find shells in the house), added mushrooms, olives, and garlic, and was done in 20 minutes.  Served with salad and garlic bread for a quick weeknight meal.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made it again - even non-pasta-eating 23 year old daughter ate it.  Everything is better with bacon :)

18yo son likes this - and it's filling.  

Bacon, onion, mushrooms - used spiced diced tomato with the liquid, spiced tomato sauce, add Italian seasoning, less water.  Easy quick cheap meal with few ingredients.  

Serve with green salad and garlic bread and you're all set.

Thank you for posting this recipe - I never would have put the combo of bacon and tomato sauce together on my own!  This was a wonderful way to use up pasta, tomato sauce, and diced tomatoes that I had on hand in the pantry.  I made a half recipe and wish I would have prepared the whole thing for leftovers!  

After reading comments I omitted the water from the recipe and added seasoning to our taste (Season All salt and Italian seasoning).  It was delicious!

I needed something really quickly tonight, and this fit the bill. The only thing I did differently was to add some garlic powder, and Italian herb blend. I topped it with a little grated Parmesan, and served it with garlic bread. Absolutely delicious! Thanks!

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars as written--good, but not great.  I've also prepared this with 2 cups water and added a large can of baked beans.  This changed the recipe substantially, but it was both healthier and more flavorful that way. I'd give it more like 4 stars with the beans, and will always add them in the future when preparing this dish.

I made the recipe as written except I used diced tomatoes with basil, garlic & oregano because I felt it was going to need some seasoning.  Perhaps it was not meant to have an Italian taste.  It was OK but not teriffic.  But...when my kids were young they would have loved it.  Maybe I'll try again without the seasoned tomatoes.

This is a very tasty, quick, and easy supper to make.  I used turkey bacon, since we don't eat much red meat and I wanted to cut down on the fat.  My husband really liked it, as he got to feel like he was splurging with all the bacon.  I've made this a couple of times and it's been good both times, so the recipe is consistent.
