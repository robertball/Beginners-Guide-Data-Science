Very easy to make and tasted delicious! I also tried it with raspberry preserves and was just as tasty. I do though always add 1/4 tsp of salt to even out the sweetness. Thank you for the recipe. Happy Baking Everyone!! :)

I was looking for a pumpkin cream cheese frosting, when I came across this one. I substituted the jam with Libby's pure pumpkin and added some cinnamon, ground cloves, and nutmeg to it. It came out super creamy and delicious!!!!

Excellent frosting! It's so creamy & slightly gooey. I used Kirkland Signature Organic Strawberry Spread from Costco for this recipe. I put it over a chocolate cake recipe I get from the Hershey's cocoa container. For the cake recipe itself, I substitute half the sugar as packed light brown & sometimes use heavy cream in place of the milk. I also like to use some Rodelle cocoa powder whenever possible. This frosting perfected the super moist chocolate cake for a decadent treat. My husband couldn't resist it. I can see this very simple recipe being easily modified with other flavors like cherry with almond extract. Hmmm... I think I'm going to try peach over a yellow cake next. I like the pumpkin idea too. Definitely saving this recipe.

I used blueberry jam and lemon extract in place of strawberry jam and vanilla. It was delicious on lemon cake. It is a generous amount of icing. I had a little left over so I iced some graham crackers for a snack. Will definitely keep this recipe close to hand. It is quick and easy . I also like being able to switch out jams for different flavors. Cherry and lingonberry also good.

Followed recipe as is and was perfect. It is a bit gooey but perfect for covering a cake. If you want to pipe at all, this is not a good recipe or would need some adjustments. Taste great, can't wait to test other flavor jams.

It came out really runny and sticky and after adding so much additional confectioners sugar, it was just too sweet.

This is my first time making a homemade frosting, and it turned out wonderful! I am pairing it with a basic white cake recipe  I found on here as well for my daughter's 3rd b-day tomorrow. I added more strawberry jam for more flavor and red food coloring for a bold color.  Funny thing is, I had to make 4x the recipe for the cake, but I actually ran out of about 1 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar but it still tastes great! I think if I added the rest of it, that it may have been too sweet. Well done, and I will recommend to everyone!

Followed this recipe exactly.  Felt a little 'frisky' so I added some orange marmalade along with the strawberry preserves.  I frosted a 9x13 chocolate cake.  Chocolate, strawberry, and orange makes an awesome combination. Thanks for this easy, as well as delicious recipe.

This was really good, though we used more jam, making the icing and adorable pink colour! So good on lemon cupcakes.

We love this frosting. We have made it with many different jam flavors. I love the slight color in the frosting without any dye.

Made a strawberry refrigerator cake and didn't want to use canned frosting, but was in a hurry.  This was perfect.  And not overly sweet.  Was easy to make.

My all time favorite frosting! I have been looking for this recipe because I lost the cookbook that I kept it in. It tastes great with any jam you want to use including lemon curd!
