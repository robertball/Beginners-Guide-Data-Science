I really really enjoyed this smoothie, Missyfit! I found it just thick enough. Although I did half the sugar ( I had very sweet berries)! I recommend to all, very easy and tasty. Best smoothie I have ever had!

We like our smoothies thicker, so I just increased the amount of crushed ice to reach our desired consistency.  Was a little concerned about the amount of cinnamon overpowering the flavor of the vanilla Greek yogurt and the blueberries, so I cut that in half which was perfect for us.  The blueberries were very sweet, so I didnâ€™t need any sugar.  This was creamy, fresh, and was a welcome treat after doing yard work this morning.  Missyfit, I love smoothies, and this one will be a regular in this house...very nice!
