For meatloaf, it's very moist, which was great. With a tiny bit of worchestershire sauce it didn't even need the ketchup (vital since we have a little one who hates condiments). Very simple to make, cute idea for a Halloween meal.

Great recipe for meatloaf and what an ingenious idea for a halloween dinner.  My family loved it.  The meatloaf was very moist and extremely flavorful.  I will definitely be adding this to my recipe box of holiday treats!!!

I made this for a Halloween party at work.  It was a hit!  Very moist with just enough of a "kick" from the cajun seasoning.  I used a few pieces of cooked spaghetti surrounding the knife in the belly with some ketchup (blood)!

This was really good tasting.  I added some diced tomatoes (personal preference in meatloaf).  Kids thought it was so cool, and all we have left is half of the face.
