I did not care for this until I added 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup canola oil. I made it without at first and it was way too tart for me.  I then mixed the sugar and oil together and blended in the vegetable/vinegar mixture.  It was really good with the change.

I liked this recipe because it was made with simple ingredients and made a lot fast.  It is crisp and cool.  I added olive oil and salt and pepper which almost completed it.  I think it still needs fresh chives or flat leaf parsley.  With that said, it devoured at a cookout and seemed liked by all.

Definitely needs some seasonings: salt and pepper, maybe a little bit of sugar. Use less vinegar. It doesn't need to be drenched in the dressing. Just enough to give a bit of zip to the salad. Dressings should never be the focus on a salad. They are to "dress" the salad. Hence the name.

I love this salad. When I first made this salad I was just putting together veggies and flavors that I love and I think that the vinegar and blue cheese compliment each other well. I do add salt and pepper to mine, I don't know why I left it out when I wrote the recipe. I don't add oil because I was making a salad with no fat and sometimes I don't like oil in my salad dressing. Hope you enjoy as much as I do.

This is an easy and yummy salad especially for those who don't love lettuce.  Be sure not to dress it until the last minute as the vinegar can start to break down the veggies.  This is outstanding with Indian or spicy main dishes as it has a cooling effect.  Great every time!

Loved it!  Try using 1/4 c balsamic vinegar instead of 1/2 red wine vinegar.  Delicious!

Made as written, colorful, crisp and easy. Needed a little something, tried salt and pepper, made a big difference.
Not sure how well it would keep, did fine. I drained off the extra juice the next day and enjoyed it again!

This was good.  You have to like blue cheese and a marinated cucumber.  I left out the olives- just a personal preference and all the rest of my ingredients were fresh and organic.  Thanks for sharing.

Quick & easy. I did take others suggestion & only use half as much red wine vinegar. Hubby thought a sprinkle of salt was needed. When making again I'll use 1 less stalk of celery - personal preference..

This was way too strong and i like vinigar. I didn't think the blue cheese went well with these ingredients either. Something seams out of place.

As I was making this salad, it seemed to me that there was too much vinegar.  Accordingly, I only added half the amount called for and it was perfect.  Will be going on a picnic next week with the girls and this will be my contribution.  Thanks so much, mommyof4, for a healthy, super salad.

Not enough flavor, (seasoning) as is, plus the amount of red vinegar called for was too much, it was very overpowering. Did a bit of altering until it was more to our liking.  Added a few pinches of kosher salt & freshly ground black pepper, a pinch of sugar, used kalamanto olives from the local deli (dislike canned olive) cut back on the amount of red wine vinegar, and added a glug of olive oil.

This was really tasty and healthy.  I added one cup of fat free plain yogurt, a tablespoon of sugar, and salt and pepper.  I will make it again.

Delicious and simple to make.  Will definitely make again.  Probably would have rated it 5 stars had I used fresh vegetables from my garden.

This is good, but does need some sweetner ( I used Splenda).  Next time I would use more cucumber and less celery, but that is just personal preference.

Great salad with fresh vegetables, but something different than a salad with lettuces.
