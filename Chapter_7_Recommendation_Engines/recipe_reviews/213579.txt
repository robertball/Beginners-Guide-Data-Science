I've eaten a lot of nanaimo bars in my life and most are far too sweet for my liking, this one is definitely tastes much lighter with the sugar which i appreciated. I did miss the coconut but the walnuts were a nice substitute. Although i like the taste of dark and rich chocolate i found the top layer too cocoa-y tasting. Overall i enjoyed the bar but longed for a bit more sweetness, but possibly just because im used to them being overpoweringly sweet. On the other hand my bars looked AMAZING, i made sure to let the top layer get extra cool before spreading and they were absolutely flawless in every layer, very tidy and professional looking!

Thanks Grandma Chase, this is a great recipe! My family LOVED them. I added red food colouring to the middle layer in celebration of Canada Day! I also replaced the walnuts with coconut (Sorry, but it just isn't that classic Canadian dessert without it). I will definitely make these again!

I used coconut instead of nuts because my husband cannot eat nuts. I thought these bars were  just okay. There wasnt anything wrong with the recipe, it turned out just like the picture. The flavor of the bars were not to my liking. I doubt that I would ever make these again. Its still sitting in my frig and no one is eating it.

This is a great recipe; easy to follow and easily enjoyed by many!  I would say that this recipe is not made to fill the 9X13 pan, it fit better in a 9x9.

Wow!!  These are fantastic!!  I thought my husband was going to melt into a puddle.  Easy to make, but you need to watch it when heating stuff, make sure you don't scorch anything.

Fabulous recipe Grandma Chase!  I like this recipe much better without the coconut.  They however are very rich and need to be cut into small pieces.  Thanks for posting a new summer go to recipe.

My family and I are Canadian, but live in California. My father requested Nanaimo Bars for Father's Day, since it had been many years since he last had one. Made this recipe for him and he LOVED them (the rest of us too)!

I started making this recipe 5 years ago for a friend who hates coconut but loves Nanaimo bars. (Funnily, I'd told him inadvertently that the bars always have coconut in the bottom layer, which he didn't know before. He stopped eating them and I felt guilty so found some I could make w/o the coconut.) Now I make them every year for his bday. I was just refreshing my memory of this recipe and want to tell you that these are delicious. I have had many Nanaimo bars and these are my favorite. The pan recommendation is too small, but I double the recipe and make it in the recommended 9x13. Otherwise you need a smaller pan. They are better when thicker...and with a thicker layer of chocolate on top! Yum. So happy it's his bday again.

I have made this several times. I double the filling for a 9x13 pan and I have experimented with different flavors of  pudding. My husbands favorite was when I used the "white chocolate" flavor. I added a little Hershey's to change the color to chocolate for something different. Wonderful recipe!

I just made these for my family. Like what another reviewer said, I found it a little difficult to spread the bottom mixture into a 9"x13" pan, it's doable but not easy. The middle layer: I have made Nanaimo bars before using custard powder so I was reluctant to try these with pudding mix. I tasted it and added more because it just tasted like icing to me. If I were to make these again I would deffinately increase the chocolate topping by at least half as this too was nearly impossible to spread, it ended up swirling into the middle layer because it was so sparce to spread.All that being said, my husband & 4 kids all love these...and that's what really matters!!
