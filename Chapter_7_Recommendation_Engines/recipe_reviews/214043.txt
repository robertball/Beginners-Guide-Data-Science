We enjoyed this dish.  I took other's advice and doubled the sauce, ( I didn't double the red pepper flakes, though).  Should have went with my gut and not used as much cornstarch slurry as it called for.  I doubled it since I doubled the sauce and it was very thick and not very sauce like.  Next time will slowly add in cornstarch slurry until I like the consistancy.  I will make this again as it was quick and easy!  Served with green beans and eggrolls.

I really liked this. I used cayenne powder instead Chinese 5 spice because I didn't have any. The sauce is a lot like the sauce on Chinese takeout sweet garlic ribs.

This was really good - I only made one minor modification to the recipe, and that was to add cayenne instead of the red pepper flakes.  Next time I make this, I will not use the cornstarch/water mixture because after reducing, the sauce is thick enough without having to thicken it further.

This is awesome!  We just finished eating dinner and I got ablsolute raves from everyone (including 3 kids)!  I had extra time so I marinated the chicken in orange juice and soy sauce.  Don't know if it changed the outcome of the tast but it was delicious.  Better than any local "chinese takeout"  Thank You!

Thought this was pretty good. I did double the sauce but thought it was a bit too sweet. So I will decrease the amount of brown sugar next time. The chicken came out a bit chewy even though I only browned it for about 6 minutes. I don't think the chicken needs to brown that long if it is going to simmer in the sauce for 30 minutes. Added mushrooms to the sauce and served over jasmine rice. Might also try to add other veggies next time.

Awesome recipe!!  As for a previous reviewer's comment about the ratio of water to rice: it depends what kind of rice you make.  Brown rice is 2c water for 1c rice, some sticky rice is 1c to 1c.

I cooked this last night for supper.  I was surprised that I had almost all of the ingredients on hand...save the Chinese five-spice powder.  We don't like things too hot, so I only used 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes.  It was very good, but I think the next time I make it; I'll double the sauce portion of the recipe.  We like a little more sauce to put over the rice.  I cooked my rice in our rice cooker and it was perfect.  Very good though and came together rather quickly for a weeknight meal.  Thank you for sharing.

Try dusting the chicken in a  flavored conrnstarch mixture. The chicken will get a nice crust on it and the sauce will thicken as well.

Pretty good recipe.  I added shrimp and whenever possible use stock instead of water.  For this recipe I used chicken stock for the rice and sauce.

My 12 year old son gave this a 1000 stars.. I personally would not used the cooking method listed hence the 4 stars.. too much simmering. Also would always add vegetables, I think your losing a good opportunity witha great sauce not to get your vegetables in..The sauce.. 5 stars..Only a couple changes.. used orange juice concentrate instead of juice and eliminated the peel. Used dark mushroom soy, rice vinegar.. They only change my son would make is to 1/2 the red pepper.. It was fine for me.. Doubled the sauce..  I cooked more like stirfry.. Marinated my chicken in a little of the sauce for about an hour.. added cornstarch to the sauce itself.. A little oil in wok and I cooked my chicken till almost done.. removed from wok.. a little oil and I added a healthy bunch of broccoli and snow peas to wok and stirfried couple of minutes.. added in sauce.. simmered a couple of minutes till it started to thicken and added back in my chicken .. couple of minutes and it was cooked through and we were eating..  served over rice..  Would definitely make again with these changes.

HOORAY...My pickey family loved this recipe!  We do not like spicy dishes so this was perfect for us!   I did not have chinese 5 spice or orange peel so I didn't add them.  I did add a pinch of ground ginger (I love this spice) when browning the chicken.  I served it with sushi rice and edemame!  It is now on my weekly dinner menu!

This dish was great!  This is what I did:
I left out the orange peel, used rice vinegar for white.  I doubled the sauce (except I accidentally tripled the 5-spice - still turned out great!)  Instead of red pepper flakes, I chopped 3 fresh red peppers and substituted hot chili oil for the olive oil.  I cooked the chicken (dredged in cornstarch) probably only 3-4 minutes, to give them a sear.  Then I added the sauce and let it simmer for about 10 minutes.  I added julienned carrots for another 2-3 minutes and viola - it was done.      
I agree with others that I did not need the cornstarch slurry.  Even with just cooking the sauce for less than 15 minutes, it thickened up nicely.
The only reason I took 1 star off was because if I had cooked the chicken and simmered it in the sauce as stated in the recipe, it would have been bone dry!  Cut down both the times to avoid this and get perfect chicken and sauce.

This one got a rare five stars from my husband.  I doubled the sauce, but not the corn starch, (we don't like 'goopy' sauces).  It is perfect in every other way.  I think adding vegetables to the chicken mixture might be good, but it's good as is.

Pretty good recipe. As everyone seems to have noticed, make sure you double the sauce! I went as is with only two chicken breasts and it was enough, but you will need more if you plan to serve this to more than two people. I added some sesame seeds to the recipe (once the chicken had browned) and also used sesame instead of olive oil and it still came out tasting good. I also added some broccoli and carrots to give it some nutrients :) I added those veggies after the chicken had browned.

Very good!  Although the 30 minutes of simmering is totally unnecessary, hence the 4 stars.  My chicken was done in the amount of time it took to brown it, so I removed it from the pan.  I then added the sauce mixture, brought it to a simmer and added the cornstarch slurry.  I had precooked some broccoli florets and sliced carrots and when the sauce was thickened to my liking, I added the veggies and chicken back to the pan, just to heat them through.  I made the full amount of sauce for only two servings so we had plenty to serve over basmati rice.  I would make this again!

Wow...this surpassed me with both its simplicity and good taste. It takes a few minutes to pull the sauce together, but after that, it is super simple and quick. I knocked off one star because it cooks *much* faster than the directions state...if I'd cooked my chicken pieces for 40-42 minutes, I would have been badly overfilled. So adjust your cooking times (you can tell when it's done before adding the sauce and then just simmer the sauce for about 10 minutes) and you have a meal that is sure to please. I also added some steamed broccoli to the dish to make it a complete meal.

10+ stars!  I have found a new favorite recipe.  Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU, Scarlett!  Now to make note of the slight changes I made (which I don't think affected the quality of the end result, and therefore didn't affect my 5 star rating).  I used boneless skinless thighs instead of breasts, just out of personal preference.  A lot of reviewers suggested doubling the sauce, so I doubled all the sauce ingredients except the crushed red pepper flakes (again, personal preference, I don't like things too spicy)... and I'm so glad! This sauce is awesome.  I wasn't sure you'd be able to taste the orange juice/zest in this since the Chinese 5 spice powder smelled so strongly when it was cooking (not that this was a bad thing, it smelled wonderful), but you can really taste the orange.  It's subtle and delicate.  A nice balance for the spice and heat.  I didn't exactly measure my cornstarch and water... just dumped a spoonful of cornstarch into a bit of water (less than 1/4 cup), and added it slowly until I liked the consistency of the sauce.  I saved a portion for my hubby's lunch tomorrow, but I am already finding it difficult to resist the temptation to just gobble it up!

This dish was outstanding.  I cubed the chicken and marinated it in orange juice and tamari for about 45 minutes before cooking it up.  I'm not sure if that actually did anything but it was delicious.  I also doubled the sauce recipe and added a few shakes of cayenne before adding it to the chicken.  This dish is my new "go to" dish for when I really want to WOW company.  Its spicy but not overly spicy, just a ton of flavor.  Next time, I'll definitely add some vegetables.

Delicious!  I did not have the Chinese 5 spice, so I used a substitution one other reviewer suggested: 1/2 tsp. ginger, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, and 1/8 tsp anise seed.  I also did not have any orange juice, so I just left it out (I have found thru experience that there is no good substitute for OJ!) and added 1 TBS hoisin sauce, just 'cause I had it in the frig.  I can see where the asian chili sauce would add a kick too, like one reviewer said, but I did not have any.  I found there was plenty of sauce, I would not double.  Will def make this again!

I made this tonight for my family.  It was fantastic.  I did double the sauce recipe like other reviewers suggested, but next time I will triple it (we like a lot of sauce for the rice). It was a bit sweet, but the sweetness definitely helped balance out the spiciness of it.  Great dish and very quick to put together.  Next time I will mix the sauce ingredients together and cut up the chicken the night before so when I come home from work it will be super quick to put together.

I cooked this for my roommates and we all really enjoyed it. I followed the other reviewers' recommendations and doubled the sauce recipe. I did not double the corn starch and thought that my sauce was adequately thickened. I also did not add the Chinese five-spice powder because I didn't have any. I heated up some frozen stir-fry veggies and served the chicken and the veggies over brown rice. I will definitely be cooking this again.

I used boneless chicken thighs and like some other reviewers, I doubled the sauce.  I didn't have Chinese five-spice, so I used some Far East Sesame ginger blend from McCormick.  Instead of cooking rice, I used Uncle Ben's Instant 90 sec. Jasmine Rice.  I also added mushrooms and green beans. This was delicious!

WAY BETTER THAN TAKE OUT!!  I made this last night, and it was FANTASTIC!!  The only thing I did differently was double the sauce, without green onion or cornstarch (didnt have either)  I used the zest and the juice of 2 oranges (cuz I doubled the sauce).  It had just the right amount of tang and sweetness with the perfect amount of spice YUM!   The only thing I will do differently next time (and there WILL be a next time) is  to add some crunchy veggies.  Like pea pods, water chestnuts, bell pepper, sliced onion, fresh basil, maybe even a handful of peanuts.  The beauty here is YOU can decide, add whatever you like.  I will be making this again!  Thanks for a great recipe!!!  We loved it :)

Just made this and served it to my family of 6.  No one liked this and I followed the recipe EXACTLY!  I did double the sauce as suggested by many others, but now wish I hadn't. It's too bad, because we live in an area where there are no Chinese take out restaurants, and we were really excited for an authentic tasting dish.  I have had such success with so many other similar recipes, and with the great reviews, we thought we were in for a taste sensation.  I recommend the crispy orange beef from this site instead.  Sorry, but 6 of us really didn't like this.

Fantastic recipe! I took another's reviewer's suggestion and used cayenne instead of chinese five spice. I didn't have any on hand and hate buying spices I'll rarely use. It was the perfect amount of heat and sweetness from the orange. Next time though, I won't cook the chicken for long before adding the sauce. It definitely doesn't need that if it's going to cook for 30 more minutes. It made plenty of sauce for me, but you could definitely double it if you prefer a lot. I used all but about a tsp of the slurry. I threw in fresh chopped broccoli for the last few minutes and served it over brown rice. Delicious!

Wonderful!  I followed as written but doubled the sauce as I was using almost 3 lbs. of chicken.  It was the perfect ratio.  I used the juice from one whole orange and the zest as well.  Great orange flavor and the Chinese five spice powder adds that little something special to the dish.  I served with white rice, roasted asparagus, and pot stickers.

Wow amazing! Definitely the best homemade orange chicken dish that I have ever tried... And I have tried a few! I used the comment to coat the chicken in cornstarch before and it made such a nice coating.  Not the deep fried texture you get from fast food.  Also this means you don't need  to do the extra step of adding more corn starch because it thickens all by itself. also really easy to make this gluten free- just use GF soy sauce!  I also doubled the sauce and the chicken so that I would have left overs. Can't wait to have it again tonight!

Gave this four stars for being easy & quick, perfect for week night crazies.  I did double the sauce because if served over rice, it will get absorbed. (Especially when re-heated as left-overs).  I cut the brown sugar down to a big pinch because it was too sweet the first time I made it. If one is sensitive to spice, cut back a wee bit on the heat of the pepper flakes. For anybody wondering: I always make my rice in a rice cooker. I use approx. 1 1/2 Cups water to every cup of rice, and I prefer Jasmine. Hard to mess up when using a rice cooker, I highly recommend for anyone who cooks rice occasionally.

This was excellent.  I substituted the ginger for the five spice powder, but I will try it next time as stated.  I also omitted the orange peel since I didnt hav an orange, but I think I may use lemon zest next time instead because I can see where something was missing.  I also dusted the chicken with cornstarch prior to cooking for a nice authentic look.

This was pretty good -- just finished eating a bowl.  Doubled the sauce, but not the brown sugar since that would have been way too sweet for my tastes.  Added red peppers and broccoli to the chicken.  Hubby will love this; he really likes sweet dishes.  Edit: Just tasted this about 30 minutes after having my bowl and it tastes 100% better now than when it was first cooked.  Interesting.

This was delicious. I omitted the Chinese five spice and replaced it with cayenne pepper. Gives it a really nice spice. Served it over brown rice with pot stickers on the side. DELICIOUS!

This is a great recipe as is.  I shortened the simmer time -my family was stalking the pan lured by the awesome aroma - still turned out great.  Double the recipe for 6.  The Chinese 5 spice powder really adds to the flavor and aroma - brings out the orange flavor.  Use reduced sodium soy sauce if you are worried about Sodium.  The 5 spice powder and orange peel add to the complexity of the flavors without needing all the salt typically found in Asian recipes.  Thank you scarlett.

OMG its SO good!!! I definitely recommend doubling our tripling the sauce depending on how much sauce you like on your rice, I made it according to the recipe and there was very little sauce. It also is awesome as a dipping sauce, we had mini eggrolls and were great dipped in the sauce. My 3 year old kept saying "this is super duper duper duper delicious!"  This is DEFINITELY a keeper! As a side note, the sauce is such a great base to add peanut butter or cashews to it which I plan on trying :)
Thanks SO much for sharing this recipe!!!

I actually didn't even have any crushed red pepper or Chinese 5-spice powder, but I was desperate for a recipe so I tried it anyway.  I added a little ginger powder (the only thing I had on hand), and it was very yummy!  I'd like to try this recipe, adding pineapple chunks, too.

Excellent. Made exactly per the recipe with the exception of making more sauce and adding a bit more orange zest and fresh orange juice. I may never order takeout Chinese again. Something to note, however, is that we got about 2.5 restaurant-sized portions out of this recipe. If you're hoping for six servings as the recipe indicates, they will be small. This dish is good enough for company. Excellent over brown rice as well, just follow the directions on the package instead of the ones on the recipe of course.

This was pretty good. I read some reviewers say that the sauce was too loose (didn't get thick). Here's what I did. Well, I doubled the sauce, but here is what I did to make it thick. I combined 3 tbsps of cornstarch with 3 tbsps flour. I thencubed and season the chicken with salt and pepper. Next, I coated the chicken in the cornstarch and flour mixture. I fried up the chicken, drained the excess oil in the pan, poured the sauce over the chicken and then let it simmer for the 30-minutes. The cornstarch and flour coating from the chicken will help the sauce thicken as it simmers (saving you the 2 tbsp of water and 2 tsp of cornstarch step). I love Chinese five-spice seasoning and always keep a bottle in the fridge, but I did not use it though. I thought ground ginger would go best with the sauce, so that's what I used. It was very good.

This was simply wonderful. I was surprised at how easy it was to prepare. I only used 2 chicken breasts, and still prepared the same amount of sauce. I didn't need the corn starch since it thickened very well on its own. I didn't have green onions, so I used some chives I had growing in a pot. Wow, this was good.  I had wished the meal would go on forever, but unfortunately, one can only eat so much until the next time! ;o) I'm glad I took a picture of my plate before I demolished it! Thank you, Scarlett!

I give this recipe 3 stars as written.  You have to double the sauce on this recipe or you will have no extra sauce for over the rice.  Also, 30 minutes made the chicken dried out, I think 20 would be adequate.  I think it could be a 4 star with these modifications.

This is the best Asian chicken dish I have ever had. My family agrees. The only change I made was to leave out the five-spice powder, as we don't care for it. I didn't double the sauce like other reviewers suggested, but I was generous with all of the sauce ingredients. Otherwise, make no changes to the recipe--it's perfect! I will make this often! Thank you!

This was pretty good, reminded me of what they used to serve at school. I couldn't find 5 spice powder, so I looked up a recipe and emprovised a bit with what I had. Not a very authentic Asian taste, but still good.

Delicious and took barely any time to prep! 30 min on the stovetop (put on a timer) and we had a delicious satiating meal. I didn't have any 5-spice powder, and I doubt they sell it here in Israel. I was out of red pepper flakes, so I threw in two shakes of cayenne pepper. No need for thickening the sauce afterwards, it reduced to the perfect amount. A1so, I only realized after prepping the sauce that I was short two chicken breasts (which was fine since it's the two of us), and the sauce amt was just right anyway, so I recommend doubling the sauce. Add a veggie as a side, and this meal is a keeper!

I thought the sauce on this was very tasty, better than take-out, but maybe a little on the sweet side. Next time I might decrease the brown sugar just a bit and maybe add some steamed broccoli and maybe some sesame seeds. I had never heard of Chinese Five-Spice but was very happy to find it at my local supermarket. I think it added lots of flavor. I used Jasmine rice instead of white rice and it was great! Overall this was a great recipe!! Thanks for sharing!!

Deliciously Satisfying!!  I made this pretty close to the recipe. I didn't have orange juice so substituted lemonade, and didn't have the 5-spice so eliminated.  So very good!  My husband thought it was a little heavy on the heat, so next time will add a bit less red pepper flakes (for him - I loved the heat) though we ate nearly all of it -- just enough left over for a light snack tomorrow!

As written, this recipe isn't so exciting. The cooking times for the chicken will dry it out, the sauce is on the bland side even with the five spice,and the cornstarch slurry makes it a bit heavy.
There is good starting flavor here. I would marinade the chicken in the sauce for at least the our before, or even overnight. Cook up the chicken quickly, and add the sauce. Cut up chicken breast cooks very quickly!
I took the chicken out, and cooked up greenbeans in the sauce and served over brown rice.
It was quick and filling and did have nice if subtle flavors.

I admit, I was a bit skeptical at first.  I grated my first orange peel, which increase my skeptism but I trudged through the recipe.  The end result is tasty chicken!  I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs instead of the breasts and it was a good choice.  The flavor seeped into the tender meat which made every bite full of flavor.  The sauce was a little thin, but I just added 2 tbsp of potatoe flakes and that worked just fine.  I will DEFINATELY use this recipe again.  Thanks Scarlett for sharing!!!!!!

Excellent dish, thank you! Everyone loved it, rave reviews. The tip to marinate in OJ+soy was great; add cornstarch to velvet. Only 1t cornstarch needed to finish the sauce, which was terrific. Thanks for the tip of replacing 5-spice with cayenne and ginger, it worked great. A winner!

I love this recipe.  I know it's also in the Taste of Home cookbook, basically called "oriental chicken," except it's made with bone in chicken thighs with the skin removed - seared in a nonstick pan for about 15 minutes and then cooked in the sauce for about 25-30 minutes, turning them every so often.  I think the dark meat of the thigh holds up to longer cooking times better (also with the bone in).  Love the sauce though!

This is really simple yet wonderfully delicious.  I doubled the sauce ingredients but quadrupled the orange juice (used Passion Orange Guava).  Didn't have a fresh orange so I left out the zest.  I've made this twice - once with chicken and once with shrimp.  Both were super yummy.  This recipe would be great with pork as well.  Served over steamed basmati rice and asian vegetable medley - it was better than take-out!

The sauce for this recipe is very good, and the picture accurately reflects the amount of sauce you will get from it.  To prevent the chicken from becoming tough, I'd suggest reducing the cook time.  Cook the chicken no more than five minutes or when all pink is gone.  Add the cornstarch slurry (but only a tablespoon cornstarch) to the sauce immediately in the skillet to quicken the thickening.  It should take another five minutes or so to thicken and the chicken should be cooked through by then.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Me, my husband and 9yr old loved this. You know it's a good one when the hubby says 'this is a keeper'. I didn't have Chinese 5-spice so I subbed cayenne red pepper. Not too spicy, just right. The cool orange floavored was an excellent compliment to the spiciness too. You must try this recipe.

YUM!!!  Like others I doubled the sauce (not the red pepper flakes).  And only simmered the chicken about 12 minutes in the sauce since others said it was dry when cooking longer.  It came out great.  This will be a regular in our house.

Excellent receipe.  I doubled the sauce as per other's suggestions and added a bit more heat.   The one thing I changed was to cook for less time.  I used chicken thighs - stir fried for about 4 minutes to brown, and then added sauce - simmered for about 15-20 minutes.  Chicken was not overdone.   Excellent recipe - thanks for sharing!

The flavor was good, but why was the chicken so dry?  I followed the recipe exactly.  Maybe I should try it in a slow cooker?  I was disappointed after seeing the high rating.

This recipe was very good. I am a ginger lover so I upped the ginger and used honey, not sugar and it was fabulous. Definitely needed some corn starch to thicken the sauce. Keeper!

I will never order orange chicken out ever again. This recipe was very easy and super tasty! I marinated the chicken in the orange juice for 9 hours before cooking and the flavor went thru the chicken very well. Thanks for sharing!!!

This is an excellent recipe. I did double the sauce just because we love sauce. I would have used the chinese 5 spice, but could not find it. I used cayenne pepper in place of it. I served it over brown rice and it was a hit. I will definitely make this again. I may add some veggies next time, but this is excellent as is!

I LOVED this recipe. So did my family. I doubled the sauce recipe as well, since I had read that in the reviews, and substituted extra chili flakes as I had no 5 spice seasoning. I was surprised at how moist and tender the chicken is. And the sauce was delicious, spicy, yet sweet and had a very lovely orange flavor. I also grated orange zest into it which made the flavor more pronounced,  added half part sesame oil in with the chicken, as well as 1 tsp grated ginger. I will definitely make this recipe again. VERY YUMMY!!

Doubled sauce ingredients (except brown sugar and pepper flakes) per everyone's recommendations. Shimmered uncovered 10 min and covered 20. Sauce reduced to near nothing before I added cornstarch mixture. Stirred in mixture, then added about 1 additional cup water, and simmered another 2-5 min. Not thick like gravy, but accurately described as sauce at this point. Served with steamed asparagus. Didn't have 5-spice on hand, but pepper flakes give sufficient heat to make my nose run. Husband liked it, 2 and 4 year olds ate it, I had thirds (finished it off). Loved it!

Made this for dinner this week and it was great!  I did not cover the sauce when it was simmering and therefore didn't need to use the cornstarch.  I will def make this again when I'm craving chinese food!

Good, uncomplicated prep. I doubled the sauce, but (mercifully) forgot to double the spice. It was spicy! I didn't have Chinese Five Alarm spice, so I just used more cayenne in it's place. I will make again, but reduce the cayenne, and maybe try out the Chinese spice. Served over 6 servings of white rice with broccoli and applesauce. Everyone liked it except my non-spice eating 9 yr old :)

I've made this recipe more than probably any other found on this site.  It is just THAT good.  It's fast and easy and pleases everyone.  DO NOT SKIP THE ORANGE PEEL -- if you don't 
 have peel on hand, don't make it -- you'll be disappointed if you do. I always double the sauce but NOT the red pepper flakes because my sadly the rest of my family doesn't like spicy food. I also don't fully double the brown sugar.  I simmer the sauce on the chicken for about 15 minutes then thicken with corn starch and cool water in a cup that I make a slurry with by whisking until smooth.  Added a little at a time until it was thick enough. I use garlic and minced ginger because I dislike Chinese 5 spice.  I used to buy a packet of seasoning from the grocery to make "orange beef" but they stopped carrying it. This is better because I know what's in it!  I've used this on fish and it's amazing, and can be used on so many things: pork, veggies, you name it -- it'll be great.

Love this super easy recipe!  I changed it up a bit.  I double the sauce and only put in 1/4 tsp of the 5 spice and 1/2tsp of the red pepper flakes.  It just seemed to be to over powering.  Oh and I also put in a little bit more orange zest.  Last night was the second time I've made this and my family LOVES it!  Thank you

I dredged in flour first, and omitted red pepper flakes (kids taste), and we LOVED this! Will be using this recipe from now on instead of take out. Served with steamed rice, steamed broccolli, fresh carrots, and edamame beans...wow, never seen a 2 year old eat so much before!

It was alright.  I have never made any asian dishes before so I didn't know what to expect. I think it was the 5 flavor spice it didn't care for. If you like asian food I'm sure it a good recipe.

I used 3 chicken breast and doubled the sauce (but don't double cornstarch) I also marinated the chix in some soy, orange juice, and fresh ground ginger. I used a well seasoned wok which helps bring all the flavors together. I did not have any five-spice powder so i used some fresh grated ginger  instead. For the rice i replaced a can of chicken broth with 1 cup of rice instead of water. I also added some fresh garlic to the rice as well. To kick the sauce up a notch I added some pineapple and fresh red pepper (not the crushed red pepper, regular peppers), really nice addition to the recipe! Made this way, it taste as good as any restaurant orange chicken.

Like everybody else, I doubled the sauce. I also added fresh grated ginger and halved the sugar. Great dish.

Thought this was a little bland.  This needs something else.  I don't think I cared for the taste of the Chinese Five Spice powder.

I have been looking for a great orange chicken recipe and my search is over. Thise dish is super amazing. I took the advise of others and doubled the sauce recipe but kept the red pepper flake at a 1/2 teaspoon and for the cornstarch slurry I used 3 teaspoon cornstarch and 3 tablespoons water,came out perfect. Also since clemintines are in season I used them since that is what I had on hand.Super delish will be making again and again!!

Excellent!  I definitely recommend doubling the sauce.  However I left the brown sugar and red pepper amounts the same (as if I didn't double it).  This dish just had great fresh orange flavor.  Will definitely make again.  Even my 1 and 3 year old kids and 7 year old brother ate this!

I made this last night for my fiance and I to try something different with chicken.  It was amazing!  I didnt have the chinese 5-spice so I used cayenne pepper instead and it was awesome!  I also double the amount of the sauce.  This will be a repeat for sure!

This was very good.  I did not have 5 spice (or the ingredients for it) so I threw in a tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of cloves.  I liked that the sauce actually reduced and I wasn't left with cups of sauce leftover.

This is a awsome recipe.  I was not sure when I read it, but tried it as written before I did any changing, and was very pleased with the results.  Nice and spicy with very good flavors. Next time I may put some orange segments, canned mandarin I think would work, to add to the orange flavor and maybe cut down on the water and substitute either juice from the canned oranges or more orange juice to the liquid mixture.   Just some thoughts from one who has been cooking for a number of years. You should try this it is well worth it. ;)

My husband and son really loved the dish.  It was so easy, but I had to run out for a moment right after the sauce was mixed and when I came home all I had to do was cook the chicken and rice simultaneously and dinner was done in 30 minutes.  This gave me an idea -- with all the ingredients out anyways, why not premix a few batches of the sauce and keep them on-hand either in the frig or freezer for future quick fix dinners -- talk about a 30 minute meal!!!

Good!  Doubled recipe as others suggested, and cut back on the red pepper flakes because of my 7 yr old.  Also steamed broccoli for a side/to add in.

This turned out really good.  Like another reviewer, I substituted cayenne pepper for the Chinese spice.  The sauce had a kick, but not too spicy.  I could actually taste the orange - just like takeout, but much healthier.  I doubled the sauce like most people did (it's a lot of sauce, but you can then drizzle it over the rice and/or veggies you serve it with, plus have some for leftovers).  The only thing I'd caution is be careful not to cook the chicken too long in the olive oil.  You definitely don't want to pour the sauce over raw chicken, but it doesn't take long for the chicken pieces to overcook and get rubbery, and then they're supposed to cook in the sauce for another 20 minutes, then more time after you add the cornstarch.  The chicken was a bit overdone, but the sauce made it still taste great.

This recipe isn't perfect, but it tasted so good that I can't give it less than five stars. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and seasoned and coated my chicken cubes with Paula Deen's House Seasoning (4 parts salt to 1 part each garlic powder and black pepper) and corn starch before adding cooking them. I had one small package each of chicken breasts and boneless skinless thighs; both turned out equally good as I was careful not to overcook them. When they were done, I lifted them out of the pan and threw in a sliced onion to saute in the leftover oil. I left the onion in when I added the sauce mixture. I didn't have an orange handy, so I used 1 T. OJ concentrate from the can for each sauce recipe, and I did double that as suggested. We don't like much heat, so I used only 1/4 t. red pepper flakes for the double recipe, and that was detectable but not overwhelming for us. We steamed some broccoli and added that to the mix along with the chicken at the end. My husband raved about it, and I loved it, too. Yes, it's a little sweet, but the balance of flavors is great, especially considering my husband claims to be fearful of soy sauce and doesn't like sesame oil or teriyaki. (I couldn't make this stuff up!) We'll be having this often. Thank you!

This was the perfect recipe for the day I tried it.  I'm making this again tonight.  I took the MissKori advice and coated the chicken in seasoned cornstarch (salt and pepper).  I also removed the chicken after cooking and sprinkled it with sesame seed, then sauteed some bell peppers, then added the chicken and sauce to finish.  Served over brown rice.  I'm going to try it with quinoa next time.

Excellent recipe! This recipe is very usual on my weekday lunches: it’s not complicated, ingredients are easy to have on hand, and the taste is really amazing, I don’t add cornstarch and never miss it, you can skip this step easily. Also the chicken served without rice is an option for a low carb meal.

This might be ok for most adults, but we all thought it was way to spicy, especially the kids. And I normally like spicy foods. But it would be good it you cut the spices down.

This was really tasty. I doubled the recipe and then quadrupled the sauce. My whole family enjoyed it and I had everything on hand minus the chicken. :O) Served it with white rice and brocolli with garlic butter and cashews, an allrecipe. Didn't have any cashews though.:O(  It was a nice paring though.

I have made this for dinner at least 4 times, the previous 3 times, the consensus has been it's too sweet. This time I finally remembered to decrease the sugar to 3 tbsp as opposed to 4tbsp(1/4 c) and I thought it was perfect!

Very tasty midweek dinner.  I wouldn't make this as a special meal but for a quick dinner, it's a crowd pleaser.  I added several veggies and did not simmer as long as called for.

One of our favorites. I've made as written and the flavor is delicious. I definitely triple the recipe when making for 4 people (two teenage boys and two adults). 
The only real change I've ever made is to add some peanuts - my boys love the crunch.

This was delicious! I followed advice to double the sauce and reduce the sugar. I also reduced the initial chicken cooking time to 8 minutes, which kept the meat from drying out but it wasn't as crunch as was probably intended. Still, this meal was very tasty.

Excellent recipe & wonderful flavor.  I read the reviews & doubled the sauce, but not the cornstarch slurry.  It made it perfect.  Only trouble was that my family liked it so much there was nothing leftover. (and this was with one of my kids out of town) Next time I'm going to up the recipe to 2.5-3 lbs of chicken!

This was a great recipe if you like orange chicken. My boyfriend hated it, but he doesn't like much of any dinner that tastes sweet. I would maybe use less orange zest next time, I probably used too much. I loved it though! Delicous with sticky rice.

I followed the recipe except took other reviewers advice and doubled the sauce and it turned out VERY good.  It was a little on the spicy side which we like, but maybe next time less red pepper and Chinese 5 spice, since I doubled those with the double sause.

Better than any Asian chicken I've ordered for take out. Like others suggested, I doubled the sauce but do not double the cornstarch mixture. It will make the sauce too thick. If you don't like it very spicy, cut the red pepper (I used cayenne) in half. Absolutely amazing dish, though. I've made it quite a few times. Even my Asian friends ask for the recipe.

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  I made it the way the recipe called for, but left out the red pepper flakes.  When I make it again, I will double the sauce and make thicker.  I will also add peanuts for something extra.

Tried this for dinner and hubby and I enjoyed it. Did double the sauce as some recommended. Also used cayenne in place of the 5 spice blend and added grated fresh ginger. It was very good.

I made this as directed with the exception of cayenne pepper in place of the chinese five star and fish sauce in place of soy sauce. I also increased the amount of OJ to 2.5 tbsps. 

The dish came out fantastic, really absurdly flavorful - especially with rice underneath to catch the sauce. I agree with others on here who say they use little to no cornstarch/flour mixture at the end - the sauce reduces to cover the chicken quite perfectly.

This sauce was great. Just not enough of it. I wish I had read the reviews before I made it so that I was prepared to alter the dish a little like after adding the sauce only cook it for 15 min. max. I cooked it too long and lost almost all my liquid so the dish was dry. I would double the sauce and add vegetables. I will do this dish again very soon. It was awsome.

Sauce has a good flavor. My son and DH do not like rice. Sauce was very runny. So if you are not putting it over rice, be warned. 
I added 1/4 cup brown sugar to final 2 minutes of cooking to help thicken. Be careful you do not over cook chicken by trying to thicken sauce. 
Next time will add veggies and serve with noodles.

I've never had a penchant for Asian cooking, though I love the food.  Just never seems to come out right when I do it, but this came out very well.  I followed the directions until the corn starch part.  I just didn't think it needed much thickening.  I also did not have Chinese Five spice, but had fresh ginger, so I used that based on another reviewer's suggestion.  Wonderful flavor!  Thanks for sharing :)

This is very sweet, orangy and heavy on the 5 spice and the garlic, so leave out the 5 spice if you're not into it.  If you're into these flavors, then I can see how this recipe would be perfect for you.  I wasn't sure if I was to use orange juice from the bottle or squeezed from the orange, I just went with the latter. My issue with this recipe is that the chicken pretty much is cooked after a few minutes, and then adding it back in for another 30 just really overcooks it.

I liked the spiciness and mixture of flavors in the sauce, but it was way too sweet for my taste. Next time I'll cut a lot of the brown sugar. I doubled the sauce and added broccoli and we ate it with brown rice.

Really good. When family says "what do you mean there was no more," I know it's a winner. Love the bright flavor from the orange. I used pre-seasoned oriental chicken breasts that I had in the freezer. Worked out perfectly.

Like other reviewers, I doubled the sauce.  I also mixed in some steamed veggies at the end.  I used Jasmine rice, but the nutty flavor of brown rice would do well too.  For less than 400 calories per serving, this recipe is hard to beat.

This was excellent, except a bit hot. My wife rated it a 2 and I gave it a 5 and compromised with a 4:-) She thought it was way to hot, while I thought it was just a bit hot. also. Used a 1 tablespoon of sesame oil to add some flavor.

Make it a 6 star by adding 3 tbsp of rice wine vinegar, and a can of chopped water chestnuts. I used less chicken so we ended up with the perfect amount of sauce for the two of us.

This is a very good recipe.  I didn't have the 5 spice or red pepper flakes, but this turned out very well.  I did add 1/4 tsp of ground ginger instead.  It is a keeper in our house.  I served this with green beans and hubby stated that an egg roll or crab rangoon would've been a nice addition.  Definitely will serve again.

We thought this was great! I hadn't paid attention to the reviews saying to double the sauce, and the lack of sauce was the only thing that wasn't ideal. I thought it odd that there wasn't any need for the corn starch mixture because the sauce all evaporated into the chicken, but, even so, the flavor was phenomenal! I was making amuch more complicated orange chicken recipe but I think I like this one better! Thanks Scarlett!

I have made this twice and loved it both times!!  We are not big fans of crushed red pepper so I use cheyenne pepper instead.  We are veggie lovers so doubled the sauce and added a boad load of veggies; broccoli, small corn, red peppers, mushrooms, carrots...part of the dinner rotation!!!!

Excellent easy recipe.  We loved it.  Better than any asian style orange chicken takeout and healthier too.   I took others suggestions and doubled the sauce except for the crushed red pepper flakes (since the family can't take too much spice) and used low sodium soy sauce. I only browned the chicken about six minutes - it cooks up tender in the sauce.  Be sure and spring for the Chinese five-spice powder - it's worth it and you will be making this again and again.

Fair, will not make again.  The chicken breast meat is dried out.  No need to simmer for the length of time mentioned.  I recommend draining the meat before adding the sauce, I did not and it was too soupy with the sauce.  I was expecting a more sticky thick sauce and it was not like that at all. I had to use the cornstarch & water to get it edible but it was still poor.  I followed the recipe exactly and I was disappointed.  I am glad I did not double the sauce as many suggested.

This was good and pretty easy but didn't blow me away. I added cashews and veggies and served over brown rice.

This was my first time using 5-spice powder and although it made the recipe very authentic in flavor, next time I will use less 5-spice powder. Otherwise the recipe was tasty.

great tasting--but the chicken must be dead if you cook it as long as is called for in the recipe.  Once cubed chicken is browned, it's pretty much done.  I only cooked it in the sauce for about 10 minutes & it was fine.  Uncovered it for the last 5 minutes so the sauce thickened.  I added onion, ginger & broccoli (stir fried separately), which made it more authentic & more of a complete meal.  Also cut back on the brown sugar since it seemed too sweet for us.  otherwise, great idea to build on.

LOVE IT LOVE IT...have a large family so I don't exactly measure the amount of chicken I use but we are all sauce lovers so I make more than suggested.  I served it over basmati rice the second time around....highly recommend.

This was great.  Definitely took the advice of others and doubled the sauce part of the recipe and only used about 1/2 the corn starch slurry becuase didn't want the sauce to be too thick.  Did take a little short cut and used a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken instead cooking chicken breast for this.  And didn't simmer it for the entire amount the recipe called for and it was still flavorful and delicious!

The flavor of the sauce was awesome, but mine didn't thicken enough. Next time I will add a bit more cornstarch.

This was a quick and easy meal. I used thai seasoning instead of the chinese 5 spice. I also added broccoli to the chicken and sauce.  Husband loved it.  Flavors taste better as it sits.  I tried a little when it was forst cooked and then had seconds about 30 min later and the chicken tasted so much more flavorful.

Pretty good stuff. I also doubled the sauce except for the red pepper flakes and sugar. I didn't double the cornstarch slurry either, the amount listed was enough.

This was a simple easy dish!  Def. one to keep around for something different and it's a nice alternative to calling in for chinese take-out.  I didn't have the chinese 5 spice so I omitted that completely still delish though!  I also added a cup of canned pineapple and maybe 1/4 cup of the canned juice.  It does need a little color next time I will add some sauteed red peppers maybe chopped brocolli or snap peas.  I think it'll make the plate pop, but try this one out you wont be disappointed!

This was really good.  I took someone else's suggestion and coated the chicken lightly in flour before cooking.  Didn't use the cornstarch b/c the flour thickened it.  Just used a little olive oil on bottom of pan, not as much as recipe called for.  I doubled the sauce, but not the sugar.  Next time I would cut the red pepper flakes to 3/4 tsp (with recipe doubled).  Used fresh orange squeezed and just a little of the peel.  Added a little ginger not 5 spice. Added some broccoli at the end.  Would make again.  :-)

This was soooo good!!! and pretty quick easy to make. I did follow some other reviewers advice about doubling the sauce and it still was just enough to coat the chicken, no extra. Next time I think I'll triple it so that I have a little extra to go on the rice. I didn't have the Chinese five spice powder but I just added a little bit of cayenne. I also didn't quite double the sugar because I didn't want it to be too sweet, just used a little over 1/4 c. Otherwise, great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

This was very good, made it exactly as written. It definitely needed the cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the end. And it is much healthier than the breaded variety of orange chicken. Thanks for sharing.

Made this recipe last night after viewing it on the main page as a feature recipe.  I did not have the Chinese 5 spice powder but made it anyway.  I doubled the sauce as others suggested and also squeezed a whole orange into the sauce mixture rather than using concentrate OJ.  I also breaded the chicken as most restaurants do.  i fried the chicken pieces and then removed from pan.  I poured in the sauce, let it simmer until it began to reduce a bit.  Then added the cornstarch/water a little at a time until it was the consistancy I was looking for.  Added the chicken back in to coat with the sauce.  Served over rice and it was absolutely AMAAAAAZING.  We LOVED it.  More than my favorite Chinese restaurant!  More than Cheesecake Factory.  Will DEFINITELY make this many times!  Thank you so much for sharing!

I made this for dinner tonight.   I didn't have the chinese five spice so I used a little of the chinese chili sauce.   It was pretty spicy but had a good orange taste.   I used dried orange peel since I didn't have fresh and it was fine.   I will made this again.

This was definitely not as good as I anticipated. I followed the instructions exactly and the end result was far too sweet (and I'm a sugar-holic) and the 5 spice (which I normally love) was overpowering. However, the chicken cooked perfectly in the sauce and it thickened beautifully. Bottom line though, my fiance and I ate it mainly to not let it go to waste, and I will not make this again. Disappointed.

super delicious! I had some nice center cut pork chops I had to make use of, so I subd that for the chicken. Otherwise, I made it per the recipe, and everyone- even the finicky 5 yr old LOVED it!! I served it with sugar snap peas and chow mein noodles on the side. Thank you so much for this recipe that will surely become a staple in our dinner rotation!

This was SUPER easy to make and very tasty!  I also doubled the sauce recipe, but did not use the cornstarch mix.  Next time I won't use as much red pepper flake though.  No worries on this recipe at all - give it a try!

I like the fact that the chicken is not breaded and fried like most orange chicken recipes.  I wish the orange flavor was a little bit more pronounced though.  Next time I think I'll try orange juice concentrate instead of orange juice.  Served mine with JASMINE rice, of course.

i think this was a pretty good recipe with a nice flavor, but my hubby didnt seem to like it very much. had boneless skinless thighs on hand. Used a little less brown sugar and added some peas at the end, because it looked so plain alone and it didnt even make a difference in the taste, but at least it looked more appetizing.  maybe even carrots or mushrooms would be nice with it.  I used jasmine rice and added some cardamon to the water while boiling and that always gives a nice flavor.

Very yummy!  I would definitely recommend doubling the sauce, though I did not double the red pepper flakes and it was plenty spicy for me.  I also added sugar snap peas, and I would consider adding another vegetable as well - probably broccoli since that is my favorite.

No leftovers!  The recipe should say to cook the rice according to package directions, then there isn't any confusion.  I served egg drop soup with it.

Hubby loved this one!  Marinated cubed chicken in OJ and Teriyaki sauce for about an hour.  Added steamed broccoli.  Served with Jasmine rice.  Great recipe!!

I made this the other day and it was pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I have never used the five-spice, but wanted to try it.  It did give it an unusual flavor, but my family all liked it.  I think I will make this recipe again, but will add some veggies--onion, broccoli, sugar snap peas, water chestnuts, etc.  Would definitely bulk this up and make it more of a one-dish meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was easy and excellent. Followed the recipe exactly, except used chicken broth instead of water. Doubled the sauce but not the sugar, which was good because it was plenty sweet. Also added a large red pepper. The crushed red pepper gave it a little kick and love the chinese 5 spice.

Excellent.  Made exactly as directed.    Paired with a nice riesling wine.  Would be great with some steamed broccoli and/or sugar snap peas and a little sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds.  Will definitely make again!

I made this tonight and my husband and I really liked it.  I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs - cut up into bite-size pieces & I dredged them in flour and browned them.  Then I removed them to a casserole & placed in oven at 325 - then I cut up half a sweet onion and sauteed in the browning pan with some cut-up peppers - then added the sauce ingredients & simmered it down.  finally added it to the chicken in the casserole and it was thick enough without the added corn starch.   I used powdered ginger instead of the Chinese 5-spice powder with the pepper flakes - we like the heat it adds.  Served with steamed rice, fresh broccoli and carrot coins.  I will make this again.

Very tasty! I didn't have the Chinese five-spice powder and put in some ground ginger instead. Be sure to drain the oil/liquid before adding the sauce, otherwise it can be a little greasy.

This dish works great with tempeh.  I only sprinkled in some red pepper flakes and also didn't use the cornstarch.  Key is to simmer for a while so the tempeh soaks up the sauce.  It was great!

We really like how the flavors of this dish come out - the orange, the sweetness and the 5-spice powder. I doubled the sauce and found it to be more than enough. Will make this again.

I love Chinese 5 spice powder and I loved this dish. I doubled the spice powder, but I wish I'd doubled all the sauce ingredients.  After combining the sauce with the cooked chicken (3 large breasts) there wasn't enough sauce to bother with the cornstarch.

I've made this many, many times and it's a favorite and excellent recipe. My only suggestion is to saute the chicken in Asian oil, or a mix of sesame and peanut oil.

I doubled the sauce as others have recommended. I cut the sugar in half. It was plenty sweet.  I didn't much care for it the day I made it, it seemed bland, soupy. The next day it was a lot better! The sauce had kind of absorbed and the flavor was much improved. If I make this again I don't think I'll double the sauce.

It was good, I wouldn't say it was amazing. I read some reviews and doubled the sauce but not the cornstarch. I also added steamed broccoli for nutrition and a vegetable. I wouldn't say it reminded me of take out Chinese and/or fast food chain. I'll make it again if my husband requests it. Missing something maybe.

I read a lot of the reviews and did double the sauce although I'm used to dishes that don't have a lot of sauce so it was OK for us. I didn't double the red pepper flakes and I'm glad I didn't. I added a lot of vegetables that I had in my crisper . Carrots, snow peapods, broccoli, celery. And then I added some peanuts at the end. That was a good touch.   I really didn't taste much orange    but we agreed it was a keeper

With the exception of doubling the sauce, I made it as the recipe was written.  Had an unusual flavor (possibly the Chinese 5 spice?) and the chicken was dry.  We ate it, but won't be making again.

This is a big hit with my family! After reading reviews, I added a teaspoon of fresh grated ginger and marinated the chicken in the OJ I squeezed from the orange that I had for the peel.  Doubled the sauce and glad I did. Added broccoli and dredged the chicken in cornstarch before frying in a little peanut oil, using a large non-stick skillet. Served over Bastimi rice. There were no left-overs!

Everyone loved it and I got requests to add it to "the list" of things we have again.  I did not have 5 spice so winged it with a very small pinch of cinnamon and fresh ground black pepper, which worked well.   You have to be very careful with cinnamon, I have ruined plenty of dishes doing that, but not this one.

Doubled sauce other than Red Pepper Flakes and Garlic 6 rather than 8. Added carrots about 5 minutes into covered cooking and broccoli about 5 minutes later and it turned out awesome over rice. Needed about an extra tsp of corn starch to thicken it slightly.

LOVE this recipe. I make it regularly and usually double sauce. I prefer chicken thighs to breasts. Tonight I accidentally left out all the spices(!) and it was still great.

The was very good! Even my pickiest eater came back for seconds. I followed the other commenters' advice and halved the red pepper and doubled the sauce. We will definitely be making this recipe again.

Too sweet - need to really cut down on the sugar.  My kids (14 and 11) liked it at first bite - but the sweetness got to them real quick.  They said it would be good if not so sweet. I'm going to cut it down and try again.  Otherwise it was an easy recipe to follow.

I can not believe I haven't reviewed this recipe yet! I've made this numerous times, it became a staple in this house. This recipe is delicious as written, however after making it a few times I always just zest and juice an entire orange and don't bother measuring it. I've added green beans with the chicken and it's great! Peppers and broccoli would be just as good. Tonight I am making it and don't have any chicken breasts so I am using the sauce over chicken thighs and baking it, smells good already! Thank you for the great recipe!! :)

This was pretty good. I followed the recipe as written except for omitting the red pepper since I have young kids in the house. The orange flavor stood out a lot.

Although I'm rating this a '5' as is, I do think I will boost it up next time.  The sauce is to die for.  I should have doubled like so many others have said.  This recipe is going into my 'box' but I will add peanuts and perhaps some snow peas next time.  It would be even better with crunch! If you do not have the Chinese 5 spice...get it..order it online if you have to. It makes this dish..along with the wonderful orange flavor.

Once a week I make meals for a large group (15 - 20.) I scaled this recipe up and it got rave reviews.  Some of the group is vegetarian and I used fried tofu instead of chicken for the vegetarians - they gave it rave reviews also. Obviously the sauce is everything here.  This recipe lends itself to all kinds of variations - add veggies (I add stir-fried broccoli and carrots to mine) and try using chicken broth instead of water for a richer sauce; use lemon zest instead of orange zest, stir-fry in peanut oil instead of olive oil, etc.

I thought when I read this recipe that we would love it.  I made it today and, yes, yes yes, I was right: we love it! I followed the recipe exactly for the sauce, except I made triple.  Did that because I had nearly double the amount of chicken. We found the flavor perfect!  Lots of garlic, but don't be afraid, it tasted so good. I didn't have orange peel so omitted that.  Omitted the Chinese 5 spice powder too.  I added pineapple chunks because I like them in such recipes, but didn't add the juice as I wanted to follow the sauce recipe as written (apart from those items I didn't have).  I did add more vegetables -- yellow and green peppers, onions, and carrots in addition to the green beans. Instead of crushed red pepper, I chopped a mild pepper and put it in.  It was a bit zippy for me but my other half said it was the perfect hint of kick for him. Definitely a 5+ star recipe for us and we will be having it again and again.  Easy to make, too.  Thank you for sharing it.

It was fine, not exceptional, but I don't think it was the recipe.  i more than doubled the recipe (and even more sauce) and while trying to get the sauce to thicken the chicken got overcooked -- stewed, really.  :(  
Next time would take out chicken to thicken sauce then toss with thickened sauce.

I would make the following changes: Reduce the sugar by half, coat the chicken with cornstarch before cooking, reduce the pepper flakes, add chopped fresh basil, cut up the orange you used to get the orange zest and throw it in at the end. I didn't have the five spice powder, so I used ginger. This is very good, and uses available ingredients. I did double the sauce. It doesn't need to cook for 30 minutes, so it can be ready in no time!

Easy to double.  Cut the sugar in half. Go light on the red pepper flakes - only 1/4 to 1/2.  Made my own 5 spice - ground pepper, cumin, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger. Used orange juice concentrate for more intense orange flavor. Ron and Dori raved! Dori wants the recipe.

Favorite recipe that I made in 2012!  My family raved about this meal.  I made it as written, but because I wanted vegetables with the meal, I added them to the mix.  I steamed fresh cut carrots, broccoli and onions to add right at the end.  Not only did we get our veggies, but it also stretched the meal.  Because I was adding extras, and we like extra sauce to go over the rice, I doubled the sauce.  The sauce as written is a nice amount of heat, but my guys would like me to up the red pepper flakes the next time I make this.  I served this over white sticky rice and we had a wonderful meal.  Thanks, scarlett for sharing your recipe!  It is fantastic and will be made many times over.  I’ve also recommended it many times on “thebuzz”.

This is a family favorite - did not change a thing.  There is a pretty long list of ingredients, but worth the little extra effort for such a wonderful blend of flavors.  I keep making this again and again!

I've made this recipe twice.  The first time I followed it to a T and it was good. I give it a solid 4 stars as written.  The second time I made it, I used leftover boneless chicken thighs that I had marinated in a sesame ginger dressing and grilled the night before.  I used rice vinegar instead of white, omitted the orange peel (didn't have any), and added a tablespoon of sweet red chili sauce (maybe Thai Kitchen is the brand?).  Wow! It was 5 stars the second time around! It was actually a tad too spicy for my kids, I probably should have omitted the red pepper flakes since the chili sauce had a little heat to it. I had meant to stir fry some veggies before I added sauce to the pan but forgot, so we had snow peas on the side.  My husband rates this as a perfect 10.

This was really good! It’s very sweet and spicy with a mild orange taste. I love spicy, but I noticed that my husband kept sniffling. So maybe next time I won't add as much pepper flakes. Also be careful, I was on a roll adding my ingredients and the way its spaced in the recipe above I ended up adding the olive oil in to my sauce. My bad!, So since I was doubling it I added 4 tablespoons in it! I tossed it and was pretty mad at myself. So just a heads up not to do the same thing I did :)

I thought it was good, but everyone raved over it so much I had to give it five stars.  Particularly since the kids said they would rather have this than order Chinese take-out.  The restaurant version of orange chicken is usually breaded and fried so it is a lot less healthy.  I did a few changes.  Rice instead of white vinegar, fish sauce instead of soy, then soy to serve with it and I served it over brown rice.  I served it with cashews and a medley of quickly sauteed sliced carrots, boc choy, savoy cabbage and snow peas.

This tasted so good!  I would have put a bit of the seasoning onto the chicken before cooking, just cause the sauce was very flavorful but the chicken was a bit lacking.  Also, I would increase the sauce amount since we love our chicken really saucy!

Made this for a Sunday School social on Friday night, then made it again Sunday afternoon for a family gathering because it goes together so easily and looks and tastes good. I did add veggies for my version...also doubled the sauce and halved the red peppers. I think the orange zest is what puts this over the top in flavor.

Very good - I think it would be even better if water chestnuts were added (my husband's suggtion).  I'm glad that I doubled the sauce as suggested by others but next time I won't double the orange zest because it overpowered the taste of the sauce. Served it with sugar snap peas.  I will definitely make again.

Delicious!  Followed exactly except doubled sauce also and added cayenne pepper.  My DH loved it too!  I didn't have any chicken in the house except Nuggets which I fried and added to sauce.  Next time I will try the breast or thigh meat to make it healthier!  I didn't have the chinese five spice but used the recipe for it on Allrecipes. I didn't have any anise seed though.  This will definately be a keeper.  I am sending it to my daughter who buys the packaged Orange Chicken in the store!

Didn't have 5 spice powder or red pepper flakes. Without, this tasted not exactly asian, more of a tangy barbecue.  My kids loved it!

Very nice home made chicken. I used more Orange peel than recommended (3 tsp) I also seasoned the chicken with pepper and salt. Next time I would season more and let it set longer. I would also toss some veggies in with the sauce and chicken so that the veggies get a sauced up. Def double the sauce

Wonderful dish!!!! I saw this recipe and how easy it was so I decided to try it out and it was amazing!  It had so much flavor and I had all the ingredients in my kitchen already!  I added more red pepper flakes for more kick.  I actually made it with precooked chicken and it was even easier.  I will definitely make this dish again!

We make this at least 3 times a month!  I don't even measure the ingredients any more, but it's always so delicious.  Definitely recommend that you double the sauce, and I always put in more orange juice and zest because we love the orange flavor to come through.

Pretty good.  I used flour instead of cornstarch to thicken it.  This would be good as a stirfry with chinese veggies too.

This is an AWESOME recipe. We LOVED it! I wish there were a way to make it taste as good and not be quite so high in sodium, but it really is delicious made just the way it is. I DID thicken the sauce with cornstarch but didn't quite use all of it...just until I thought it was the right consistency for my liking.

This was great as I tested it while cooking right up until I added the corn starch...I had increased the recipe and maybe the increased corn starch amount was too much but it made it goopy and had a weird texture and changed the flavor. Next time I won't use corn starch, as imo it had thickened enough on it's own anyway, and i am sure it will be awesome. i also didnt have that 5 spice stuff so i left it out, and I used worstechire instead of soy cause I didn't have that either. and no grated orange peel which i will definitely make sure I have on hand next time

Made a quadruple batch tonight so we could have leftovers. Needless to say there wasn't much left over. It's a favorite every time. Only thing different I do is leave out the crushed red pepper. The kids don't like it spicy, and so whoever wants it can sprinkle some on later.

This is excellent!  It drives me nuts when folks change the recipe a great deal and then review it based on the changes.  In this case I don't think my changes impacted what the original recipe tastes like.  I used sesame oil instead of olive oil and 1 tsp of that was a chili sesame oil.  Since I used that chili sesame oil, I didn't use the crushed red pepper.  Next time I'm going to add cashew nuts and maybe some broccoli!

So good!  I also doubled the sauce and it boiled down and I didn't need to thicken.  Served with steamed broccoli on the side but mixed mine with the sauce, devine.  The whole family thought it was too spicy but I did just open the jar maybe it's very potent but next time I'll just add a few shakes.  Weird we all like somewhat spicy but this was close to unbearable.

I made this 2 days in a row! My family loves it! I used Braggs Liquid Amminos instead of soy sauce. I used organic arrowroot powder instead of cornstarch; I needed to double the amount of arrowroot when substituting it for cornstarch. I tripled the sauce, doubled the chicken; and used 3 cups of rice and 6 cups water as my rice portion. I also stirred in 8oz of chopped pineapple at the end just before serving.
The glaze and extra amounts of it were just right; but the flavor was incredible! Not too spicy, with a hint of orange and so good I had to keep "testing" it.
We had given up going out for Chinese food because of MSG's and soy sauce, but now we can eat one of our favorite kinds of food again! Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

This was amazing.  I cooked the chicken breasts whole, then cut into cubes and added back to the oil. Then added the sauce and so on.  I didn't end up with much sauce.  It was still delicious over white rice.  Next time I am going to add broccoli, and maybe some mushrooms and onions.  Definitely going into my recipe box ! Thank you.

My family loved it and it was perfect for my sister and her bf's Gluten Free diet :) Next time I will just increase the ingredients to make more sauce as I didnt have enough but might have been that I used too much rice or chicken... Overall.. followed it exactly as written and the flavour and texture was wonderful :) will definitely make again

This was delicious; I used chicken thighs and let it sit in the sauce mixture for a hour before cooking. I made another batch of sauce to add as the recipe suggested. Try adding snow peas, carrots, mushrooms and onions. Serve over jasmine rice!!!

My hubby said it tastes like something my mom would make (which is a VERY big compliment). I stuck to the original recipe. While I was cooking, I thought that maybe I should've double the sauce as some reviews suggested, but when I started eating, I found there was no need to. For me, there was plenty of sauce to spread in the rice (once you started mixing it). However, if you like your orange chicken to be sitting in a pool of sauce like in the Chinese restaurants, I would double it, but keep in mind that the 30 minutes of simmering is good enough for the juices to really sink into the chicken and that the pool of sauce (as done in restaurants) may be because of their shortage on time.

This was awesome!!! super easy, fast, and delicious! I have a very picky four year old who only ever wants asian foods (soup and rice usually). so i am always trying to get him to eat some meat for protein. i have experimented with several other asian meat recipes, he has turned them all down. this was a big hit! not too spicy, just packed with flavor! my son even helped me do some of the cooking so he was doubly thrilled! husband loved it too, will definitely be making this again, probably once a week!

I made as is and found that it tasted quite sweet (and orangie considering the zested orange) and initally didnt exactly enjoy the taste. HOWEVER, i packed a few lunch size portions and let sit overnight and the flavours really marinated together nicely. i REALLY enjoyed it for lunch and would maybe just consider a little less zest! overall easy and flavourful.

This was absolutely amazing!  My family, picky ones and all had seconds.  I doubled the sauce and thank God I did.  When we ran out of chicken, we went back and sopped up the remaining sauce with the rice.  I am getting ready to make this for the second time this week due to popular demand!

This recipe is fantastic.  I doubled the sauce as others suggested, it was perfect!  I added the green onions when I added the sauce so they could really add to the flavor.  We will definetely eat this often in our house.  No need for take out!

Fantastic! Definitely making this whenever I crave Chinese. Like others have said, I didn't need the cornstarch, I just let it reduce on the stove until it was concentrated yumminess.

This is very good BUT definitely needs more sauce.  Next time I think I'll at least double and maybe triple the sauce.  Otherwise delish!

This is absolutely delicious!  I didn't have to use the cornstarch to thicken the sauce because it thickened enough for me, and I would like a little more sauce to put on my rice, but all in all it was very good! Thanks for posting!

This dish was absolutely wonderful and amazingly easy.  I didn't have the chinese powder nor the cornstarch.  I substituted with curry powder and 2 tbsp. of all-purpose flour.  I also added bird's eye stir fry vegetables. Umm Umm good!

YUM. Packs some heat and has more kick than I normally go for, but it works to balance the sweetness and is deliciously true to the Chinese-American flavor profile.  I don't plan on reducing the amount of red pepper flakes when I make this again. 

Super-quick and easy to throw together, and will become a personal favorite. I'm confident the recipe as-is would hold up, thus it gets 5 stars even though I made some mods. 

First, I chopped and sauteed a small onion and half a red bell pepper I had hanging around. Added them to the sauce mixture .

Didn't have 5-spice powder, so put a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon into the sauce, so it'd have a little more depth and complexity. 

Grated an entire orange skin right into the sauce, squeezed that juice into it.

Before I cooked the chicken, I tossed in a little flour and black pepper. Browned nicely and made the cornstarch steps unnecessary.

Wonderful! I cooked it just as written and doubled the sauce but not the cornstarch mixture when thickening.  Next time I'll add some onion and red bell pepper.

Double the sauce!  Excellent recipe!  If you want to make it more like orange chicken that you get from a restaurant, consider dredging chicken in cornstarch first.  It will also thicken your sauce later.  I followed the recipes just doubling the sauce and it was wonderful!

I made this last night for dinner and it was a big hit! I omitted some things I didnt have on hand (ketchup,chinese 5 spice, orange peel, cornstarch) and it still came out great. I only browned the chicken for a couple minutes before I put the sauce in and it cooked perfectly. I added some steamed stir fry veggies to the chicken and sauce at the very end to get some green in. If you are a veg you could even leave out the chicken and just use veggies, it would still be amazing.  This will definitly make it on my menu again. (I doubled the sauce because we like sauce, but its not necessary)

This dish was Amazing! I've made Orange Chicken before with a much more difficult and time consuming recipe and it did not turn out nearly as good as this one. To save time I just used frozen popcorn chicken bites (not as healthy but a definite time saver!) and I did not have the Chinese five-spice powder so I just omitted it. The chicken still had a nice spicy flavor to it without. By the time the chicken was done simmering in the sauce I didn't feel like I needed the corn starch as a thickener- the sauce had already thickened quite nicely on its own. I paired this with Chinese Chicken Fried Rice II (from this site) for an excellent and easy Chinese inspired dinner.

Excellent. Doubled sauce except for the garlic and red pepper flakes. Didn't have 5-spice powder or orange peel, so I omitted and used 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger instead. Don't forget to double cornstarch mixture, too. Family loved it.

Everyone seemed to enjoy for the most part.  We all agreed that the orange zest was too much.  We doubled the recipe but kept to one orange, anyways, and it was still too much.  I think the orange juice alone is just enough citrus.

This recipe was great! A little of everything - sweet, sour, salty and spicy. The only change I would make in the future is to cut back on the thickener ... less is more with in this case. Also I did make one addition to the recipe - I added a chopped green pepper right before adding the sauce. I just needed a veggie in there somewhere. Thanks for the recipe!

My entire family loves this recipe. I was looking for a recipe to use for lettuce wraps and tried this and it is perfect. I actually prepare it in the slow cooker and it turns out great. Get some Boston Bib lettuce and serve it up with rice and Chinese Noodles. Good stuff!

This is REALLY REALLY sweet with a strong orange taste, but the orange rind is needed because the dish is flat without it. Five Spice can be found in the international aisle at Publix. This will not be a repeat for me.

This was really yummy. I chopped half an onion and a whole red bell pepper and sauteed with the chicken. Next time I'll add even more veggies. Broccoli would be good too! My VERY picky 16 yr old daughter scarfed it down. :)

It's very good. Did not have Chinese spice, so I would add more crushed red pepper for a little more spice. Also I added broccoli and baby corn. Will make with a little more sauce next time.

Tasty recipe, definitely double the sauce. I followed another review and used ginger, did not have five-spice...and I added veggies. Yummy served over rice.  I'm also a wimp spice wise so when I doubled the sauce I did not double the red pepper and it was perfect to me.  I will definitely make it again!

Pretty good sauce that even my son who can't stand tasting 'fruit' in his food liked.  I even added a bit extra grated orange peel and substituted spices on hand to make up for the five-spice powder.

Very good, made with fresh oranges off my backyard tree, chicken was very tender and my guest raved about it. Served with sesame stir fried broccoli and bell peppers.

I think this chicken is just as good as Applebees Orange Chicken Bowl.  The red pepper flakes add a wonderful zing to the dish.

I usually have a hard time making asian food at home that I like. And this recipe was really great! I made the chicken exactly to the recipe. I made a nice veggie stir fry with some whole wheat pasta and coconut milk instead of rice. It was delicious Thanks!

So good!  I followed the advice of others and doubled the sauce, which I will do again next time.  I didn't have the 5 spice powder so I used a dash of cayenne.  I added fresh broccoli at the end which I highly recommend- it was perfect.  My sauce could have been a little thicker but no complaints!  This will be a regular in my house.

Great great tasting recipe.  I really loved this.  I did not have crushed red pepper flakes or Chinese five-spice powder, but it was delicious just the same.  I did add some frozen green beans in the skillet the last 20 mins of cooking.  (I am a big fan of all in one meals)  Served it over minute rice and it was phenomenal!  I will make and eat this again and again.

LOved this, I changed a few things though. I dredged the chicken in flour before browning it, omitted the cornstarch step, and doubled the orange juice and only used 1/4 C of water.

This recipe was delicious! I followed the recipe excatly except I did not add the cornstarch because it was already thick enough. I also served it with some steamed broccoli and carrots. My only suggestion is to double the sauce as other reviews have suggested. I did not double the sauce the first time I made it and it could have used it. If there are leftovers you should store the rice and chicken seperately so the rice does not get soggy from the sauce.

I am so sorry but I didn't care for this.  I hardly ever say anything is too sweet, but this was (for a non-dessert especially!).  My kids liked it, but my husband and I had to force ourselves to eat the leftovers just so we wouldn't be wasteful.  I did follow the recipe exactly.

Very good.  Served with a side of steamed broccoli for a quic, healthy dinner.  The only change I had to make was to omit the five-spice powder because I didn't have it and couldn't find it at my local store.

Very good but I should've scaled back on the pepper, it was a little spicy for my taste. I will definitely make this again with less pepper flakes.

This was pretty dang good, but a little sweet (and I LOVE sugar/anything sweet).  Next time I will cut back on the brown sugar, but it was otherwise very good.  I also doubled the sauce as other reviewers suggested and definitely recommend that others do the same.  It was very saucy, but one batch wouldn't have been enough to pour over the rice.

This dish is very good - the sauce is very flavorful.  I made it for my husband and I, and we didn't have alot of leftovers.  I would make more rice if I were serving 6 people.  I added vegetables such as broccoli, mushrooms, green pepper too.

This dish was really good! I think next time I will take the advice from others and double the sauce, as our rice was bit dry. We also may stir in some vegetables with this dish...it seemed to be missing "something" but the sauce was awesome and we will be making this again! Thank you for sharing!

This is a delicious meal!  I cut the b. sugar and olive oil amounts in half and doubled the sauce.  We just finished dinner and my daughters nine year old  friend was over for dinner.  He begged me for the recipe so he could give it to his mom!  I served it with salad and egg rolls also from this site.  Great dinner.

My 11 year old tried Orange Chicken in a restaurant and loved it.  So, I tried to recreate the dish with this recipe.  This recipe worked very well in my electric wok.  I served it with brown rice to make it healthier.  Yummy and simple.

Sauce was okay, but didnt thicken up like I thought it would. I was expecting this recipe to mimic the chinese restaurant version of Orange Chicken. I left the orange peel in the sauce for extra flavor.

This is such a terrific dish - each one of our 6 family members had positive feedback about this recipe. It's pretty easy to make and it is also easy to control the amount of spice. I like to make this with the Pea Pods and Onions recipe from this site. Thanks!!!!!

This was definitely a good recipe but like others, it didn't wow us either. We felt it needed more spices including a bit more heat and it seemed a little on the sweet side. I guess due to the zest I tasted a lot of orange which I would have liked to have toned down some. However, would I make this again? Oh yeah I would because the recipe has great bones and honestly, that's where it starts and this was a great beginning. Thanks so much Scarlett!

I cooked this today and added a small bag of stir fry veggies. The sauce  was way too sweet. But all in all a good recipe.  Will just use 1tsp of brown sugar, next time I make it.

Hands down the BEST orange chicken I've ever had! Better than any restaurant.  I added a teaspoon of Sriracha (red Thai chile sauce) to the sauce mixture-which was a big hit. Next time I won't add the cornstarch, though. Paired great with sizchuan green beans and jasmine rice.

The chicken was nice and tender but over all the dish lacked in flavor.  I mixed the marinade up and tasted before adding it to the skillet.  Even then the 5 spice, which I am a big fan of, overpowered the rest of the flavors so I added some dry sherry to round it out.  Didn't work.  The 5 spice completely overtook the rest of the flavors.  It ended up feeling like I was eating a 5 spice rubbed chicken.  Will make this again but with major changes.  Will up the soy sauce, OJ and maybe the vinegar but will cut back to a "sprinkling" of 5 spice.  Also, as much as I love garlic it about knocked me over while the skillet was simmering.

This was really good  I doubled the sauce and instead of using Chinese five spice powder, I used 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  Delicious served over rice and with an eggroll.

Extremely delicious!  I doubled the sauce ingredients (we like extra sauce for our rice), and added broccoli.  Also, added a little extra orange juice, as I didn't have an orange for the peel.  My family loved it!

I'm giving it 3 stars bc I changed it.  I would give a 5 to my changes!  I doubled the brown sugar, and added generous squeeze of honey.  I halved the garlic (I used the kind that is in a jar, and a teaspoon is one clove.  2 tsps seemed like more than enough.)  I added a few shakes of "hot shot", which is a black pepper and red pepper mix.

This had a delicious flavor, everyone loved it. Had never tried the Chinese five spice powder but it gave it a very unique, yummy taste.

I made this last night for my fiance and I and we both absolutely loved it. I made it primarily for him since he is a big fan of all things orange, not I, although I loved it as well!! It had so much flavor and zest! I made it exactly as described, and am actually making it again tonight in fact, but this time I am easing up on the red pepper a bit. It was a little too spicy for my taste but for all you spicy asian fans out there, this recipe is a sure fire hit! Enjoy, I know we did!

Made this tonight for dinner.  Doubled the sauce (and the chicken for that matter since I wanted leftovers) as other reviews recommended.  Forgot to get the orange juice, so I used orange marmalade and some water instead.  Otherwise I did not change a thing. Husband and I liked it a lot and I'd definitely make this again.

Yumalicious and nice and spicy.  Double the sauce, add cornstarch/water as needed.  We served it over quinoa, but brown rice would have been better.  Definitely add veggies next time.

Just made this recipe, and will definately make it again! Next time I'll follow the advice of those who doubled the sauce, and will use less of the thickening agent, as the sauce seems to thicken nicely during the cooking process. I used the juice of 1 fresh orange, and then zested that orange into the rice - ties the flavors together very nicely. One of the best recipes I've found here so far!

This was SO SO good.  We really enjoyed it.  I doubled the sauce, shook the chicken in a baggie of flour before sauteeing in the oil, and instead of measuring the orange juice I just juiced a full orange after zesting it.  Served over the rice in a bowl with broccoli.  Will definitely keep this in the rotation.  Delish!

This sauce is great (even though I didn't have 5-spice powder). I doubled the sauce and had too much - 1.5x would have been enough. I steamed some fresh broccoli and we tossed them together on our plates - yummy! Will make often. Thanks!

This dish was absolutely amazing!  I made it just as written and wouldn't change anything, except possibly use a little less than 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes - it was a little spicy!  The orange flavor was perfect!  Also, I did use Uncle Ben's Ready Rice to cut out time and it was well worth it!  This is a keeper - I will be making this again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good - a keeper!  I didn't have any green onions, so I sauted about half of a small sweet yellow onion with the chicken and it came out great!  Also - served it over brown rice with a couple shredded carrots added to the rice at the end.  I also added about 2 T. of orange marmalade to the sauce since I had some hanging out in the fridge.

Double sauce. Use only half of cayenns and chinese five spice. I used half of cayenne (1/2 tsp) and 1/2 tsp five spice and it was way too hot. Great sauce, just too hot.

This was wonderful! I cooked the chicken and veggies first and added the sauce at the end (after everything was cooked). I'll be using this sauce recipe over and over. The orange flavor was perfect. Yum!

Made a double batch last night! Awesome! All liked it including the dog who sampled a fallen piece of chicken. I assembled the sauce ingredients  in a sauce pan and simmered while I stir fried chicken in 2 batches(3lbs.).As for what I altered, cause we all do. I had no 5spice so I made a ground clove and cinnamon mix. I used half the crushed red and it still had heat. I also finely julienne cut green and red pepper.      Just ate the cold left overs for lunch and thought this would be good on a salad with pine nuts.

Yummy and Easy!  A little spicy for the younger children- so I'll adjust the peppers the next time I make it.  I skipped the cornstarch step as mentioned by a previous reviewer, as the sauce thicked nicely just by reducing during the simmering stage.  Over all- super simple and very tasty.

Simple to make and delicious. Got thumbs up from everyone. Few changes, I used cayenne pepper and boneless chicken thighs instead of red pepper flakes and chicken breast). I also forgot to put grated orange peel and green onions for garnish. I'm sure if I used those 2 it would have been even tastier. Definitely a keeper.

This is an easy delicious dish with just enough spice.  Even my 6 year old loved it.  Will definitely put this on our dinner rotation.  Next time I will  double the sauce, but we like it saucey.  Served it with steamed broccoli for rice bowls.

Five stars because this fits my criteria for a 5 star recipe: Ease of preparation; quick; great taste; nice presentation and ingredients that I normally have on hand.  I made it as written with only a couple of tweaks.  A bit of salt and pepper added to the pan while the oil heats gives the chicken a nice texture and I added about half a cup of chopped onion, as well as the minced garlic, when the chicken was almost browned to my liking.  Didn't need the corn starch slurry, as I only did 2 breasts and the sauce was sufficient and thick enough for our taste.  Finally, a lime wedge squeezed over the plated chicken and rice really brightened the flavors!  Thanks for posting this one; it's a keeper for us.

This was absolutely AMAZING.  I doubled the sauce like most people did, which is the only reason for the missing star.   I didn't have Chinese five-spice powder, or orange peel. Also, The only vinegar I had was "white balsamic". I used a lot more cornstarch/water - until it was basically as thick as it is at the Chinese restaurants.   This was a HIT!!!! SO EASY!

It was super easy to make and SO yummy. I made the sauce x3, because of other reviews, and it was perfect. I didn't cook it the full time either. I only simmered it for 20 minutes, and it wasn't tough or dry. I didn't have the crushed red pepper flakes or the Chinese powder. I substituted cayenne powder and chili powder. I made this as a serving for two, so I added approximately a 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne and a good dash of chili powder. (even with the sauce tripled)  It still had a nice spice to it. I did NOT add the cornstarch/water mixture. It was good as is. Will make again! I served over rice and had green beans. Hubby was happy and said I could make it again. A++

My husband and I LOVE it!

I've referenced this recipe for years, particularly for the sauce, which is outstanding. I've made a few changes to the steps.

1. Marinate the cut up chicken in OJ for a couple of hours. The citrus makes it more tender and juicy.
2. Prepare the sauce as directed in a small sauce pan, over low heat.
3. Remove the chicken from the marinade, dredge it in cornstarch (or cornstarch / flour mixture) and pan fry in oil of your choice. Cornstarch gives it a crispy result.
4. Drain the fried chicken pieces onto a paper towel, then turn on to a serving dish.
5. Meanwhile, increase temperature on your sauce. Whisk a little cornstarch with water and stir it into the sauce. Stir until thickened.
6. Pour hot sauce over meat, give it a quick stir and serve.

I doubled the recipe. Did not double the red pepper flakes since my husband is not a big fan of spicy food. Easy and delicious! Husband said it had a great orange flavor. I will definitely make again!

Made this so many times over the years. It’s a family favorite. I like to add either peanuts or cashews. I usually use 3 cut up chicken breasts and triple the sauce recipe. I don’t triple the red pepper flakes though, that would make it too spicy for us

I changed one thing. I had no Chinese 5 spice so I used pumpkin pie spice. Really good sauce! I used an instant fried rice instead of white rice. This recipe would taste great with ANY preferred rice. Will definitely make this again.

For the listed amount of chicken, double the sauce & the rice.  I subbed chicken broth for the water.  Since no Chinese five spice, again this is the doubled amount to make 1/2t:  1/4 anise extract, 1/4t ground cinnamon, 1/16t ground cloves.  Oh, no orange peel added & reduced the crushed red pepper to 3/4t.  I went with coating chicken cubes with cornstarch, about 1/4c, rather than thickening the sauce.  Coating keeps the chicken moist & cooks slightly crispy.  I only browned the chicken then simmered until cooked.  The sauce was thickened & the chicken was cooked in fifteen minutes.  Pretty nice.  ;)  I stirred in a bit of sesame oil.   Very slight orange flavor & medium-heat spice.

Excellent!   Made it just as written except I used cooking spray to sauté the chicken instead of oil to lighten it up.  I only simmered the chicken in the sauce for about 10 minutes because I was short on time.  We are watching our calories and this was pretty light as well.  My husband loved it too so this one is going in the rotation!

Delicious and easy. I doubled the sauce, like someone suggested. But, I did not double the orange peel or red pepper flakes. It was gobbled up by my husband, who is not a huge lover of chicken. This recipe is a keeper!

Excellent base recipe when in a rush. Could easily be modified with vege's also. I let my g-dau make this. I think she used too much Br. sugar. It was too sweet. Next time, I'll make or help her, we shall see. Thanks for sharing.

This is one of our favorite Asian dishes.  I gave it four stars because I made a few changes because as it was it was lacking vegetables.  The changes I made was to double the sauce, marinate the chicken for at least a couple of hours in the sauce, and last but definitely not least when the chicken is done add a bag of frozen stirfry veggies.  Simmer a couple of minutes until the flavors have a chance to blend, serve and enjoy!

I added sauteed/browned onions and steamed broccoli.  I added 1/4 cup lime juice to the sauce...reduced the sauce before added to the chicken  as I didn't want to boil the chicken and get it over cooked. I omitted the cornstarch. The amount of sauce was enough for 2, double if there are more folks! Everyone loved it.

I made this with mandarin oranges and some of their juice from the can and it turned out really  well! I obviously did not have orange juice and an orange to zest, and I just made this again tonight minus anything and everything orange, and it was very very delicious. It’s nice to know that a recipe is versatile, so that makes this one a keeper for me. I do hope to make it with the orange juice & zest sometime. Also, I did what others did by using a scant amount of cayenne in place of 5 spice, and I always use waaay less red pepper flakes than what a recipe calls for (about 10 little flakes). My family doesn’t like a ton of spice.

I did double the sauce recipe as some others have.  And I did double the red pepper flakes because I like spicy things. However that wasnt the best choice for the company I had over.  If you double the recipe dont double the red pepper.   When cooking the chicken I actually lightly coated the pieces in wondra flour and a little salt and pepper in a ziploc bag to give the chicken a little texture and seasoning....probably wasnt needed.  After the chicken was done, I wiped the wok and quickly stir fried some snow peas and broccoli.   Took that out and kept warm then added the chicken and sauce back to the wok.  I didn't come close to using the amount of corn starch slurry that it calls for because the wok created a pretty thick sauce as it was.  Oh!  I also used regular minute rice instead of anything that takes 25 minutes...just way easier and it comes out the same consistency as what youd find in a takeout place.  It is a great recipe.  Sometimes sticking to what it calls for and not "making it your own" is the best advice.  Thanks for sharing!

I've made this twice now and it was a big hit both times.  As someone recommended, I made extra sauce (about 1.5x the recipe) and I think it's about perfect.  One other thing, use paper towels to pat as much moisture as you can from the chicken before cooking.  If you don't, you just end up boiling the chicken and the water never cooks off.

I've made this a few times and my husband and I love it.  I used brown rice the last time, but much prefer white rice or pasta.

I am not a fan of orange chicken but made this for my husband.  I made it with lo mein noodles instead of rice.  He LOVED it!  The sauce is just the right thickness, and it makes plenty of it (hubby loves sauce).  I used rice vinegar instead of regular vinegar but otherwise didn't deviate from the recipe.  It is perfect!  I even ate some :-)

I did not have Chinese Five Spice, so I googled a substitute, and used a mix of ground cinnamon,  ground cloves, ground ginger and ground anise instead.   Also, cut up some pineapple and several of us liked it mixed in.  I also made a separate batch with veggies for the vegetarians in our house (what I had on hand:  onions, green peppers, carrots, celery, and water chestnuts).   It was equally as incredible.  I opted to mix some of the veggies in with mine as well, and that was terrific!  Definitely making this again!

This was a hit, even for my super picky eater. I doubled the chicken and tripled the sauce except for the cornstarch and brown sugar, left those at double. Tasting at the end of the cooking time, it seemed a bit bland so I added onion and garlic powder and more soy sauce.  My picky guy said I should make this every week, so will definitely be making again.

Yummy! I’ve been holding on to this recipe for a few months and finally made it tonight. I thought there would be leftovers, but I was wrong. Everyone in my family loved it! I followed the ingredients to the letter, but did double the sauce as other reviewers suggested. I’m glad I did because we served it over rice and the sauce was a great addition.  As other reviewers suggested, I did marinate the chicken in a mixture of orange juice and soy sauce the night before I made it. I drained the marinade well before sautéing. After sautéing the chicken I took it out of the pan and set it aside. I poured the sauce in the same pan and brought it to a very low boil, stirring constantly for 3-5 minutes. The sauce reduced and thickened with out adding the corn starch. Once the sauce was think, I turned off the cooktop tossed the chicken back in to coat and served over rice with broccoli on the side.
Thanks for a great recipe!

I was out of orange juice, so I opened a can of pineapple chunks in pineapple juice, used the juice. Since the can of pineapple was opened, I added some pineapple chunks to the simmering chicken.  Also threw in some baby carrots and about 3/4 cup of peas.  The meal got great reviews at dinner time.

Very good, kids loved it as well, and easy to make.  Didn't need as much cornstarch slurry as it had thickened up on it own a good bit, maybe half of what is listed next time.  Chopped green onions across the top

Made this just now and I was surprised how much I liked it being as the uncooked sauce smelled strange. I doubled the recipe and substituted vinegar for lemon juice and cayenne pepper in place of 5 spice which I'm glad I did because the sauce was pretty sweet! I followed tips on previous reviews and dredged chicken in cornstarch and only cooked a few minutes before adding sauce. Once sauce was added I turned the heat down and let simmer for about 15 minutes and it was ready to go! Thank you for an amazing recipe this was fun to try

Usually don't like Oriental food with orange juice in it but this was good. You need to double the sauce like others have suggested or it would be dry. Either the red pepper flakes or the five-spice powder gave it a zing that was the really the cherry on top. We did use broccoli & mushrooms that was also suggested. Will make again.

Very good sauce. I basically just made the recipe for the sauce alone. I had leftover chicken from a large roaster, so I did not need to cook chicken breast first. I doubled the sauce recipe as many had suggested and just let it simmer down for 20-30 minutes until the majority of the water had evaporated off. I made a few changes, with reducing the red pepper, I did not have orange zest, and I added a drop of both ginger and tangerine oil. Once the sauce was cooked down, I tossed the cooked chicken, a bag of cooked Asian style vegetables, and a handful of cashews, and let it heat through. Served everything over ramen noodles. It tasted as good as delivery!

It was wonderful! Everyone loved it! The only thing I would change is to at least triple the recipe if you want extra sauce for the rice. I made another  batch on the side so we had sauce to add to the chicken and rice at the end.

Quite spicy - and I didn't even add all of the recommended red pepper flakes (added about 2/3 of it) - Made double the sauce, which gave nice amount of extra sauce for the rice, etc.

After reading others comments, I doubled the sauce but not the red pepper flakes and didn't quite double the slurry.  It was still to hot for us.  I also added water chestnuts and green beans when I added the sauce.  It was very good, but I'm not sure I'll make it again.

This was one of the most delish Asian meals I've ever made. It takes a few minutes to gather all of the ingredients, but I broke it up into 2 stages, getting all the dry stuff together earlier in the day. Served it over rice. The red pepper flakes gave it just enough heat. I simmered for about 15 minutes, and when I went to add the cornstarch, it was so thick I ended up only adding a tiny bit of it.  I did make more sauce. It was just so yummy and can't wait to make again!

Very good recipe!  Taste!  The Chinese five spice adds quite a unique flavor to the chicken.  I added some broccoli, carrots, baby corn and water chestnuts to the chicken.  I will be making this again and will try to find other recipes that use the Five Spice.

I used jalapeno ketchup, just because I had it in hand. Made it a little spicier. I will make this again!

Hubby loved it even more than I did. This is a great combination of sweet and spicy! I only had chicken thighs so I cut them off the bone. Since my chicken pieces were smaller, I didn't cook the chicken as long. Definitely double the sauce!

The chicken tasted very good, but the chicken itself was on the tough side.  I will make this dish again and only cook the chicken for 15-20 min instead for th 30 min in the recipe.

This dish was a hit. I made it as directed and didn't change anything except for doubling the sauce as suggested by others, and for dipping the chicken pieces in cornstarch before browning.  I did not double the red pepper flakes when doubling the sauce, though I might increase the amount when I make it again, to increase the heat somewhat. I will make this recipe again because it was really delicious and I have had requests! I served it with broccoli, and  a mix of quinoa, brown rice and wild rice which I found at Costco.

I made this last night WOW! No more ordering take out ... as many suggested I doubled up on the sauce except for the crushed red pepper flakes. Served over white rice and a side of brussel sprouts. My husband couldn't stop raving 'you can do this again'! That's truly  5 Star Rating in my books.

So good! I used most of the ingredients as written but changed the cooking method a little bit. I used 1# of chicken tenders cut up. I used the cornstarch to coat the chicken (and added garlic powder and five spice to that) instead of making a slurry.  I browned the pieces in oil about 5 minutes on the first side and 3 on the second. Then I removed them to a bowl and added the wet ingredients to the pan and brought it to a boil.  Turned down to a simmer after 3 or 4 minutes and added the chicken back to the pan.  I stirred to coat and then used a meat thermometer to check for doneness.   It was already 156 degrees so the tenders cook very quickly!  I did double the sauce ingredients except for the sugar and left out the crushed peppers as a personal preference.  The best sauce ever!  Served with brown rice Pad Thai noodles and steamed broccoli.  My picky 8 y/o ate everything!

Thank you for this recipe!  Not only was it easy but it was very tasty. My 9 year old did a two thumbs up. She said the sauce was perfect. I'm so happy to add another meal she likes to the menu. We paired it with the rice and added a side of steamed broccoli.  I did what others suggested and doubled the sauce but didn't double the slurry and it was perfect. I added lots

I added diced green pepper and onions during the last ten minutes. I did not have the seasoning mix called for, but it still was very tasty.
I will make it again. It was quick and easy to make.

This orange chicken recipe is amazing! It had amazing flavor and the sauce was well balanced; not too salty or sweet and overpowering! This dish is certainly an authentic asian dish and is so much better than what you can get in the restaurant! I defitnely recommend this dish to anyone (if you don't like spicy things you can add the red pepper flakes, just don't put the required amount or you can leave out). Thank you for this awesome dish! Sure will make again! :)

This is a delicious dish! I used 1.5 pounds of chicken, added two heads of broccoli, and doubled the sauce. Absolutely amazing, sweet, savory, and a little spicy. I thought it was a little strange that you simmered for 30 mins but I did it anyway-- chicken wasn't dry at all and really helped hold in the flavor.

This was a great recipe!  I followed the recipe and I would recommend that you use the corn starch water mixture slowly as stated.  I did not need it all as my sauce thickened pretty quickly.  I did stir fry some green and red peppers and onions and added them when I served.  Delicious!

A win! Will definitely be making this one again. Unfortunately I overcooked the chicken just a touch. I think I went overboard on the initial browning. Otherwise whole family enjoyed this. I paired it with some broccoli and everybody was satisfied.

It was ok, and I could attribute some of the differences to not having the 'exact' spices available to me at my grocery store. Still, the taste was all right; nothing to write home about. The consistency of the sauce was a bit of a problem; still too watery, even with the cornstarch.
All in all, it hit a spot I was looking for, but didn't really make my day.

My husband and I LOVED this dish!  The second time I made it, I added diced red pepper and yellow pepper, mushrooms, and broccoli, used 2 1/2 pounds of chicken, and tripled the sauce.  I sautéed the veggies separately, then added them to the chicken mixture at the end after the sauce had thickened.  We garnished the dish with sliced almonds.

Hubby and I both say it's a keeper recipe.  I make a lot of stir-fry dinners and the orange in this sauce really makes it special.  I doubled the sauce and added some chopped swiss chard which is  plentiful in my garden right now.  Served it over some leftover rice.  Wonderful!

Excellent, very aunthentic tasting!
I doubled the recipe for the sauce and glad I did as it was just enough.  I also did not add the cornstarch to the sauce; it thickened on its own as it simmered.
It's sooo good!

I never write a review but this is my second time making this in 2 weeks and I'm in love. I did finally find the 5 spice but I ended up buying McCormick Japanese 7 spice, that's the only thing I changed. I always double recipes but I actually tripled the sauce. First time I made this is omitted the rice because I had frozen Asian dumplings in the freezer....so good. I added broccoli to the finished recipe and I did Not have left overs.

My husband and I found the recipe little too hot for the delicate orange flavour.  I made the recipe as written, but when I make it again, I will definitely be making some changes.  Good base, but some changes need to be done for it to be a 5 star.

Substituted  cumin as I did not have the Five Chinese spice. Added green and red pepper just because I had to use them in something.I did not double the sauce.  Had plenty but extra would not have been a bad thing. Delicious.

Loved it! I did double the sauce. Cut back on the amount of spices and garlic, just our personal taste. It's a definite "make again" for me :)

I tried this, but found it was too much spice for the dish. I  would lessen or omit the 5 spice.

Love recipe. However made changes. I did not have chicken breasts on hand and used 2 1/2 lbs drumsticks instead and chose to cook in Crockpot. Of course increased amount of ingredients and added pinch cajun seasoning.

Great recipe! I doubled the sauce for rice drizzle and used half of the Five Spice called for in this recipe. I replaced the missing Five Spice with cayenne. This  recipe is especially delicious served with a lemon infused rice.

Made per recipe except for no orange peel (don't buy oranges) and did double sauce, as suggested.  Turned out very good, and with leftover added steamed broccoli and carrots, water chestnuts and the leftover rice.  Excellent the second time around, too.

We found this to be really different, really tasty.  I hesitated to try the five Chinese spice as our tastes are pretty tame.  But I ended up adding another quarter teaspoon after I doubled the sauce ingredients, minus the chile flakes, as we do not enjoy heat.  Will definitely make this again, and enjoy adding a variety of sautéed veggies for a complete meal.  I used a bit of onion, celery, sweet red pepper, and a can of water chestnuts, adding them at the end, just to heat through when I thickened the sauce with a single amount of cornstarch slurry.  Delicious!  Thank you!

Definitely make again.. I cubed the meat and seared it til done -maybe 10 minutes- added the sauce  which I doubled with only 2teaspoons cornstarch..used seasoned vinegar and orange juice concentrate undiluted. Will definitely add stir fry veggies next time. Cooked up quickly..the chicken will be tough if cooked as recipe directs..4 1/2 stars for sure!

i did not have the chinese spice , might be worth findind it , i doubled the sauce like it says in the comments and the sauce had thickened enough just to add a little bit of corn starch and water to finish the desired thickness but the cayenne made it a bit to tangy for my taste. I might redo it and play around with the taste of the sauce....

I made this for dinner last night.  Followed other suggestions and marinated my boneless, skinless thighs in the orange juice and soy sauce.  I doubled all the sauce measurements because we like it saucy.  I didn't have Chinese 5 spice so I just used some ginger.   I also threw in some carrots and red peppers to get some veggies into my kids. 

It was delicious!!  Better than at a restaurant!!! My family loved it!

This was an easy 4 right off the screen and a solid 5 when tweaked to our personal taste.  What we like:  double sauce, a tad less sugar, & more chili.  This also works well with pork.  For beef I'd suggest dark soy sauce and double chili.  Veggies are better steamed as side dishes as they will  be over cooked if added in the normal stirfry sequence.

Seriously? So good. Used thighs instead of breasts because I thought breasts would get too dry and rice vinegar because I didn't have plain ol white.

This was delish!  Like others, I doubled the sauce portion.  Used all the ingredients, except went easy on the pepper flakes for my husband's sake.  Safeway carries Chinese 5-spice but they were out.  Went to a nearby Asian grocery store and bought it there. 5-Spice is not always the same spices.  I chose the one I bought because I liked what it had: fennel, anise, ginger, cinnamon & cloves. I also added a couple diced zucchinis and finely chopped carrots right before I added the cornstarch and water.  Did not double this, but did add more after a bit -- probably due to the water in the zucchinis and carrots. Served with sticky rice - Hinode Calrose White Rice Medium Grain.  Will definitely make this again.

Wow - this was so good. Used chicken broth instead of water, doubled the 5-spice powder and coated chicken chunks with seasoned cornstarch. No need to add cornstarch water to thicken the sauce. The timing on this recipe is off, especially if you use a wok. No need to simmer very long. Next time I'll add some veggies - onions, snow peas and water chestnuts.

This was delicious! And pretty easy. I used coconut sugar instead of brown to make it a little healthier, and added a tablespoon of cornstarch right to the sauce. It was the right balance of sweet, spicy, and tangy, and a great consistency.

Made the recipe AS IS ( forgot to read comments first) and it turned out AWESOME! I added pea pods and replaced the lid to steam them for a couple of minutes before adding the cornstarch mixture.  Skipped the 5 spice and red pepper flakes as I didn't have any and it was STILL GREAT! More sauce would be ok but I served as lettuce wraps and had plenty of sauce. Kids and hubby loved it!

This is a great basic  recipe! I followed other reviews and double the sauce, and added less brown sugar. I was also out of garlic and the Chinese spice, but I substituted with garlic powder and cayenne pepper. Great recipe for a quick meal!

It looks complicated, but it comes together easily and fairly quickly.  I made it exactly as written, and I think the 5 spice powder is a little overpowering for my preference, but it is just a personal preference. Overall, this is a wonderful recipe that delivers a satisfying meal: moist chicken, sticky sauce, right amount of spice.

This was a very good, simple dish that I could make with very little time to do it. I had all of the items in my pantry already so it was a perfect spur of the moment dish. All of the family loved it and my husband was happy to have some leftover for work the next day. I did double the sauce as recommended by other reviewers. Definitely make sure to add the cornstarch slurry slowly so you don't over thicken.

Yum!  Decreased chicken by half and left sauce amount the same to serve two.  Didn't have five spice, so sprinkled on a little cinnamon and pepper.  I used about a tbsp of flour to make slurry since I was out of corn starch. It worked great, not too thick.  I also didn't simmer for half hour so my chicken didn't get tough. Will make again!

Came out great! The sauce is amazing! I did not have chinese 5 spice so i used cayenne, cinnamon, cloves and fennel. I also had chicken breasts already cooked and just cubed them and let it simmer in the sauce. I also didn't have an orange for zest so i used a lemon. I substituted white rice for brown rice, and I added broccoli, onions and carrots and it came out like a stir fry! Definitely making this again, next time with water chestnuts and pea pods!

Loved this. I agree with the other posters who suggest increasing the sauce. Not much is left to spoon over the rice. (Not sure it needs the corn starch. It's pretty thick after cooking for 20 mins.) But this is going to be great for nights when I want Chinese food, but don't want all the calories of take out. This will be in regular rotation for sure.

Loved the sauce! I was really on the fence if I should double the sauce. In the end I did not double it as I only used 2 chicken breasts and the sauce to chicken ratio was great. I marinated the chicken in the sauce for 2 hours in the sauce first. I did use a bit of cornstarch to thicken at the end and I only cooked the chicken for 10-15min or so to not dry out the meat. It was easy to make and will make this again for sure!

The whole family (minus the 5yr old who wouldn't try it) really enjoyed this dish. It was super easy to make after prepping the chicken. I did take the suggestion of using a cornstarch/flour mixture to coat the chicken before browning. I did not use an egg wash before coating! The sauce thickened up wonderfully and the chicken was delicious. My only complaint is that the orange flavor seemed really mild. Next time I plan on increasing the zest and maybe the juice to see if this helps.

I had been put off a little bit by the combination of ingredients, but decided to make it anyway, based on the rave reviews. I made it EXACTLY as written and it was fantastic! Not only will I make it again, this has leap-frogged to the top of the list of my new favorite recipes. Thanks, scarlett! UPDATE: I made this again in a friend's kitchen. She didn't have a cover for her skillet. While the flavors were still there, the chicken was much tougher.

Delicious recipe. It's fun to play around with the sauce. Definitely make extra sauce. I tweaked the sauce because we love spicy. To sauce I added siricha . I made my own Asian 5 spice ..ginger cayenne garlic salt ground pepper and wasabi powder. Also added chunky peanut butter to thicken sauce a bit. I didn't add cornstarch to sauce. For chicken I marinated in orange juice and hot pepper sauce. Then dredged in cornstarch spiced with salt and pepper. Cooked in oil for maybe 4 minutes.added broccoli carrots for a minute then sauce. Brought to boil simmered for 20 minutes. . Perfection over basmati rice

Turned out way to spicy after doubling the sauce but only using 1 serving of the red pepper flakes.  Also, the sauce did sit over night in the fridge, so that may be part of it. Did follow a lot of reviews when making this.   Will not make again.

This is so yummy. The only changes I made was no red pepper flakes so it wasn't spicy (kids dont like spice) and I doubled the sauce. Served over Jasmine rice. Was amazing is what my 13 year said. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is one of the best chicken dishes I have ever prepared and so easy.  I did as others suggested and doubled the sauce and I also doubled the cornstarch and water mixture.  I may have simmered it a little to fast, so ended up adding some water to thin and making more sauce.  I used orange concentrate but 6 tablespoons instead and no orange peel.  Great flavor.  Served it over brown rice.  It will certainly be on top of my list for easy entertaining.

Oh wow, this was delicious!!!! My only complaint? I didn't double the sauce like other reviewer's recommended!!! I followed the recipe with only 2 exceptions: I didn't have the 5-spice mix so I used cayanne and I didn't put orange peel in (didn't have an orange). My boyfriend LOVED the chicken(and he's picky) as did myself and my daughter (she had it on vegetarian chicken nuggets). This was a big hit in my house and I will def make it again! Great recipe, thanks for sharing!!!

Love this with chicken and beef.  I don't use the Chinese Five spice, just because I don't have it in my pantry or ever use it.  Taste great even without it.  I serve with fried rice and edamame.

Even adjusting for all the ' equivalent' foods, it's still taste good. I thought I thawed out chicken breasts, but it turned out to be thighs, didn't have oj but had my toddlers half finished tropical juice, didn't have 5 spices but had a random ' seasoning' on the shelf. Didn't add any chilli flakes, added some cabbage so we get some serving of vegetables. No ketchup but wanted to finish off the opened jar of tomato paste. Obviously, no peel too, as did not have the fruit. And it still turned out pretty tasty ==^.^== I took the double the sauce advice but end up using only around halved the corn starch thing, watched slowly, the consistency of the sauce change.

This is quite good. I doubled the sauce, but only used 1/3c. of brown sugar. I dredged the chicken chunks in cornstarch so as to avoid the last step and only browned them for about 2 min. Then I added the sauce and cooked, covered, for only 15 min. more. When done, I stirred in broccoli and red bell pepper that I cooked in the microwave for just a bit so it still had some crunch. The orange flavor in the sauce is good but pretty subtle. Served over basmati rice. *UPDATE* Made this again the same way I previously did but this time served it over quinoa, which I prefer. Really good!

Followed as directed except cheated with Uncle Bens boil in a bag rice. The sauce is outstanding. Did not have the chinese 5 spice or cayenne pepper so added a bit of ginger... I doubled it as we have teenage boys....it was gone!

I have to say it was a very tasty meal. I agree with others about doubling the sauce and THANKS to all for the suggestions. Also I made sure to back off the sugar to keep it from being to sweet. I will use this one again when we have company.

Great Recipe! I took other's advice and double the sauce. Also, I dusted already boiled chicken pieces with cornstarch and fried them until golden brown. This gave the chicken a little bit of crunchiness that mixes very well with the sauce. Thank you for an awesome and easy recipe.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I have made this dish several times and have made a few edits to punch up the key flavors. First, I use about a Tbsp of orange zest and use all of the juice from the orange. That equals about 1/4 cup of orange juice if a large, juicy orange is used. Also, a heaping quarter tsp of five spice is the way I go. I forgo the olive oil and simply use a non-stick wok. Additionally, I see no need for the corn starch at the end. Just take the lid off during the last 5 or 10 minutes of the cook time and the sauce thickens naturally. The next time I make this I am going to try adding bits of pulp from the orange! I love the bold, orangy flavor!

Amazing - first time for using Chinese 5-spice powder - love it. Made the Coconut Rice on this site instead of regular rice.  Note, I forgot step 4 (it was on the back side of my print out) and it was still yummo!

I followed this recipe exactly.  I prepared the sauce the night before to save time.  I ended up decreasing the amount of chicken by half so there'd be enough sauce.  I will definitely make this again.

I gave this 4 stars because although the taste was 5 stars, the portion size was way off! It said serves 6, it served 3 and barely! So if you try this recipe, definitely double the entire recipe!

I found this recipe to be very sweet with rather in-your-face flavor, nothing subtle about it.  I knew it was aimed more at kids, so I knew my husband and I would both find it edible, but not a favorite.  Problem was, neither our ten year old nor our seven year old cared for it at all.  The older eats anything with ketchup on it, too, but this was too much sweetness even for him.  Not a keeper.

This was good. Totally satisfied my Chinese food takeout fix. Only changes I'd make would be to cut the sugar in half and use a bit less of the starch mixture. Also, it is a good idea to double the sauce. Otherwise really good!

My family really likes this dish. We have made this dish at least 5 times. Each time tweeking it a bit.
I use boneless thighs instead of breasts or half and half.
I double the sauce except I cut back on the red pepper and 5 spice to half of the original recipe. 
I add green onion to the chicken while browning and drain the chicken before adding the sauce.
And I add peanuts and snap peas at the very end

Doubling the sauce is a must.  Cornstarch is not needed. The sauce thickens up pretty quick. Next time, I will add snap peas or other vegetable.  Otherwise, it looks too plain.  I cut back on the sugar & it was a little too sweet for me with the Jasmine rice.  Next time, I will try brown or regular rice.

I had almost the same result as cook ArianaMelodie. My sauce turned out almost black (really, really dark brown) and was incredibly strong. As in way, way, way too strong. It didn't just overpower the chicken -- it drowned it out. I followed the recipe exactly and it really didn't turn out good at all. My wife and two daughters also thought that it was way too strong. I don't think that I will make this one again.

For those who loved this recipe try the Asian Lettuce Wraps from this site.  They are very similar to this.  My husband made this and left out the orange peel(didn't have an orange) & used half the amount of crushed red pepper so it would be too hot for me who is not a fan of spice & our daughter.  I do agree that it could've simmered not as long because the chicken did dry out.  Otherwise, it was very good!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I did double the sauce and it was the perfect amount for 5 servings.  I cubed the chicken and browned in 6 minutes til just pink in the middle then simmered in the sauce before adding the cornstarch slurry.  Turned out very tender! All 3 kids liked it but 2 felt it was a bit spicy, although I wouldn't describe either of them as spice lovers.  It was the perfect amount for me - you get the feel of warmth but not unpleasant heat.  But I DO like spice.  So be aware and adjust the cayenne accordingly :)

Really delicious.  Skipped the orange peal and Chinese 5 spice, but added 3 T Sriracha sauce and 3 T Szechaun sauce (San-J).  Cut up onions into chicken stir fry.  Would be good to add more vegetables, like peppers and carrots.

I recently made this for my family and I have to say, it was a big hit!!! Thank you so much for the recipe! The family loved it except for the three that contracted food poisoning. That might have been my fault and not the recipe.

Recipe was great, very sweet with a bit of a kick! I didn't have actual oranges, so there was no orange peel in it and I did not put the Chinese 5 spices in either. But it turned out just fine! I did broccoli cooked in soy sauce and minced garlic on the side too. Yumm! (:

Delicious!  Made just as written, and it was a total hit, but next time I might cut the sugar down to see if I can get away with it, not for the sake of taste (because it was delicious) but just for health's sake.  Will definitely be making this again and again.

The whole family loved this! Doubleing the sauce is a must. Instead of corn starch I just added 2 tablespoons of flour when the timer was almost up and it came out perfect.

Been wanting to try this for a long time because the picture makes it look so good! I am so very disappointed that it does not taste as good as it looks. I followed the recipe except did not add orange zest or pepper flakes (had neither). Even adding those 2 ingredients would not have made it any better. Will not be making again. I'll stick with my own Asian Chicken recipe.

PERFECT. This is the best Asian chicken recipe I've found. I didn't use the red pepper flakes or the 5 spice because I didn't have any. So I used ground red pepper and just a pinch because I didn't want it too spicy. And I added a little ground ginger. Will defiantly put this into our weekly menu and make extra for lunch the next day. I did the rice separately according to it's package directions.

This was a hit with my family! I doubled the sauce and used 2 lb boneless chicken thighs. I omitted the orange peel because I didn't have it on hand, otherwise followed the recipe as written. I will definitely make this again!

Pretty good recipe and easy too. I doubled the sauce and did not use as much red pepper and did not use the Chinese 5 spice either since I did not have any. It still had enough spice for me.

So good!!  I doubled the sauce, too.  I didn't have 5-spice and don't like red pepper flakes, so those were omitted.  Everything else was as written, and it was fantastic!  No reason to go out to eat when you can make this at home!

this receipe was amazing! I added some orange and plum  pieces and also honey to sweeten it up a bit. Definitely needs more sauce. Much nicer with vegetable egg-fried rice. My sauce was thick enough without adding cornflour. Highly recommend this dish with the above modifications.

This is a delicious sauce recipe but a little too hot as is for us.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a chili head and love spicy food but this was a bit too hot.  I doubled the sauce since we love lots of sauce and next time I will leave the red pepper flakes at 1/2 tsp.  Great recipe that's so easy and better tasting than bottled mixes.

Recipe was easy, I had all the ingredients on hand.  I cut up my chicken and let them soak in an egg wash with salt for a few hours.  Before cooking them, I dusted them with flour for a nice crust.  The sauce was delicious tasting.  I only ended up using 1t of cornstarch to thicken it.  Would definitely make again.  Thanks!

Made a few adjustments but it got rave reviews. Definitely precoat chicken pieces in cornstarch before cooking. I also doubled the sauce as others suggested otherwise it would've been too little. I used 2 heaping Tbsp. of orange juice concentrate in place of the juice to give it more prominence, added 2 tsp. freshly grated ginger, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 anise seed, 2 shakes of curry powder, and 1/4 tsp cayenne. Didn't have Chinese 5 spice but it had a nice low but consistent spiciness. Will absolutely make again

fantastic recipe. i did not add cornstarch to the sauce to thicken, found it reduced fine on its own, though coating the chicken in cornstarch did help to thicken everything and bring the dish together. personally found it a bit to sweet, going to lessen the sugar and add a bit more spice to it next go around.

Yum!  This had some heat to it and I may make it a little less spicy next time (my 2 year old ate it but he required two glasses of milk to cool his mouth off).  I didn't have the special Chinese spice, so I just added a bit of ginger.  Will make again!

I really liked this recipe but because I did not follow it exactly I did not give it 5 stars.  Like others I tossed the chicken in cornstarch and then cooked it in oil.  Once the chicken was done I poured the sauce over the chicken and let it thicken up which only took about 15 minutes.   I also doubled the sauce recipe.  I did not have the Chinese 5 spice powder but we did not seem to miss it.  What I really liked about the ingredience for the sauce is that they are staples I keep in my cupboard.  I will be making this again.

I have tried this recipe a few times, I triple the sauce because we like extra.  This does take about an hour from start to finish but doesn't most dinner's.  I will make this again and again! JJNKC
I did add orange marmalade instead of orange rind, worked just a well and had on hand.

Doubled the sauce.  Used rice from my rice cooker.  I marinated the chicken in OJ for a few hours before cooking.  Family scarfed it right up.

Very decent.  Fast enough for a weeknight dinner.  I didn't have the chinese spice and just used cayenne.  I accidentally dumped in way too much so at the end I added just a little heavy cream to cut the heat.  The cook times are way off.  There is no reason you can't have this started and served in 30 minutes.  Like the others I doubled the sauce and I added a bag of stir fry veggies.  I also used coconut oil and sesame oil instead of olive oil.  I just mixed them together.  I also omitted the orange zest and the green onions.

My family really loved this recipe.  We tend to like things a little on the spicy side so I increased the  5 spice powder and tossed in some extra red pepper flakes.  When I made it the second time, I really let the sauce and meat simmer low and slow. It gave the dish that nice warm back of the throat heat.  A definite keeper!

Tried this tonight. Took the advice  to dredge the chicken in cornstarch and this thickened the sauce when it all cooked. Chicken came out soft. The sauce was good consistency, I also doubled the sauce ( sans red pepper flakes) and it was the right amount of sauce. My only problem was that it still came out a bit too spicy for my family. Next time I will use half the red pepper flakes and a little less Chinese five spice, I thought it dominated the flavors.

Just made this for a church committee meeting and everyone enjoyed it, but I found the red pepper flakes a little too overpowering. Could have been my mistake in measuring).  Since I doubled the chicken and added a package of frozen broccoli and califlower and also added a package of baby carrots, but forgot to double the sauce, it was somewhat drier than should have been. Overall, a good blend of food and spices.

Living in Europe, we have given up on going out for Asian food.  Went out on a limb last night and tried this, after craving sweet and sour chicken for a couple of weeks.  We were not disappointed.  This is easy to make and tastes wonderful.  I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce (not the cornstarch), and had plenty of sauce for our rice.  My picky family enjoyed it so much, there were fights over who would take the leftovers to school for lunch!

Delicious-I doubled the sauce but didn't double the crushed red pepper.  It was sweet for the kiddos but still spicy enough for my husband.  If you like General Tso's Chicken this is a nice, unfried version.  Making the recipe again this week!

This was easy and delicious. I made up the sauce earlier in the day and stored in the fridge. I followed it exactly but lightly steamed broccoli at the end. I would make this again!!

Teenage boys and hubby LOVED this - best ever, they said.  I was out of orange juice and orange zest, so I used lemon zest and apple cider.  Still had that sweet and spicy flavor.  Yum!

This was an excellent dish! I did as recommended in another review and doubled the sauce. Well worth it. I also did not use all of the cornstarch. (I used 1 tsp for the double batch of sauce.) and it turned out just right.  I did not have any 5 spice so I replaced it with the cayenne pepper as recommended in another review. OH and I did add one cubed green bell pepper and 1/2 a chopped onion for a bit of crunch.

I ended up simmering this dish with the lid on for about an hour due to my husband arriving home later then intentended and the chicken was still tender making this a very flexible dish on time.

I use a rice cooker and usually double the water to rice ratio and it turns out perfectly each time.

I will DEFINITELY be making this again. My daughter went back for seconds and thats unusual. Thanks for the recipe! :)

I usually use cayenne pepper instead of five-spice powder for a slightly different flavor and more kick.  I also add plenty of stir-fry type vegetables like peas, broccoli, red peppers, and bok choy, but then you definitely have to double the sauce to make the flavor spread over the whole dish.

I used about 1/2 the amount of chicken and browned it in Pam, but left the sauce the same. It didn't thicken up for me, maybe because of not having the oil (?). It was delicous, though, and next time I won't even bother mixing in the cornstarch slurry. Only reason I changed at all was to make it more Weight Watchers friendly :) It was a hit

This is a fantastic recipe and I have made it several times! My kids will ask for this by name. The only thing I do different is add some red bell pepper and some sugar snap peas. Also I've never had Chinese five-spice powder so I just use a little bit of cayenne pepper. And I agree you should definitely double the sauce.

Absolutely wonderful and super easy.  My family likes noodles so in place of the rice, I cooked spaghetti noodles, added to chicken in skillet and tossed.  Like others, I did not have the Chinese five spice so I sprinkled in some ginger, curry, and cayenne.

Tried this tonight....11 year old son and hubby loved it!  Took others advise and doubled the sauce recipe.  I would have given it five stars, but I didn't find it a "quick and easy" recipe..by the time I measured out all the ingredients, etc., it seemed to take a long time to make.  That said, I will definitely make it again.  Thx for a great recipe!

This orange chicken is fantastic!  I will say that I didn't use plain white rice, I made a side of fried rice instead so that I didn't need sauce for the rice.  Also no five spice seasoning, so I made due with a little cayenne pepper like another reviewer did - and it was fantastic.  I've made it a couple of times now, and it's going on my permanent recipe box.

It's okay.  Followed the instructions and the suggestion of doubling up the sauce.  It was meh - We might try again but with dredging the chicken in cornstarch first.

This was very good. Even my picky family members said they would like it again. My 13 year old son was disappointed that the chicken didn't have a bready crust on it, but loved the taste.

Alright people- This is IT!!! THE best, fastest, healthiest and CHEAPEST way to have the beloved Chinese-Buffet-style Orange Chicken. I have searched and tried and eaten many other Orange Chicken recipes and they have all either been way too time consuming, breaded and unhealthy or not taste anything like the buffet style. THIS RECIPE satisfies all the needs to making that great orange chicken you love ordering for take out. One of the things I love about this recipe is that you can buy one orange & use 1/2 of it to squeeze out the 2 T of orange juice you need (freshly squeezed orange juice!) and grate the peel of that 1/2 to satisfy the quotient of grated orange peel, then use the OTHER 1/2 of the orange as a garnish by slicing it into rings & decorating the plate! This recipe makes me look AND TASTE like an amazing cook that spent hours in the kitchen when really, I'm sticking to this recipe because it's easy!

Great flavor - loved it. I doubled the sauce as most people recommended and was glad I did. I think I overdid it on the orange peel because it was a little over-powering, but I think that was my mistake adding to much not really measuring it.

I liked this a lot. I took another person's suggestion to substitute fish sauce for the soy sauce in the marinade and added some carrots, snow peas and broccoli. (my daughter is gluten free and can't have the soy sauce.) I doubled the sauce and am very glad I did as it was just enough and less wouldn't have been enough. I did not add double the orange zest and still thought it had a good orange flavor.

Yum! great combo of sweet and spicy. Husband and EXTREMELY finicky daughter loved it.  I left out the cornstarch step and didn't have 5 spice so subbed with xtra red pepper and a tiny bit of cinnamon, cloves and white pepper.

This is one of our favorites (and a birthday dinner request for tonight)! A definite staple in our house (my kids call it orange chicken). I prepare it as directed- but have to triple (yes- triple) the recipe for my family of 7. With rice and broccoli- yumm!!!

This was so tasty and easy to prepare.   I tossed in some slightly steamed shredded cabbage at the end and it was a good addition for crunch and added nutrition.  This is even very good cold right out of the fridge!

Really delicious. Used orange pineapple juice instead of straight orange because that is what i had. A little spicy. Used cayenne pepper and some ginger instead of the chinese powder. Everyone loved it!

Wow- this was an amazing recipe, the only part i left out was the Chinese five-spice powder i could not find it anywhere. I also added bell peppers and green onions. This recipe taste just like we got chinese take out! Altought i do recommend that if you dislike spicy or hot foods leave out the crushed red peppers. Amazing!!!

Very good dish! 4 stars as written, 5 as modified. A bit too sweet - next time I'll use half the sugar. I used cayenne and ground mustard in place of the five spice, added just a bit of wondra in place of the cornstarch slurry, and added sautéed mushrooms and onions! Also didn't cook the chicken as long as the recipe suggested. Only simmered for 15 minutes. Tender, moist, sweet and spicy and yummy! Will make again for sure.

I didnt have the five spice, pepper flakes, or orange peel, but decided to go ahead and try to make this recipe.  It was so good.  I dont know what those ingredients would have done to it - but this is certainly a keeper recipe.   I should have followed others suggestions and doubled the sauce - it wasnt quite enough to cover the rice.  Next time I will double the sauce and add vegetables to make a complete meal out of it.

The flavor of this sauce was excellent! I had my doubts but it really was good, similar to a chinese-american restaurnt sauce.

I DO agree with others - double the sauce. I did not double it but I used half the chicken and I felt like that was just right. The chinese 5-spice really made the dish, I feel.

I have made this dish several times now and my family really loves this dish. I didn't have Chinese five-spice so I substituted with Cayenne Pepper and I double the sauce mixture (with the exception of doubling the cornstarch mixture). I serve with a vegetable stir-fry and white rice.

Ok, THIS one goes in rotation. :) Doubled the recipe. Substituted cider vinegar because that's what I had, used slightly less brown sugar and slightly less red pepper than the recipe calls for, and didn't have an orange to zest so just was a little more generous with the OJ. Next time I think I'll double the sauce, just to saturate my rice and put on my steamed veggies too. Thank you for this simple and delicious recipe!

Wonderful!  I did add some diced red, yellow, and orange pepper, as well as one serrano pepper for extra kick.  I also made my rice with chicken stock and some herbs.  I made double the sauce because we like a lot over our rice.  Then I served it with salad on the side.  This will definitely become a regular meal in our house!

This was excellent, the whole family loved that it wasn't to orangy. I made alterations including using Orange juice concentrate for more of a tangy flavor and I added onions to the chicken while it was browning. I think next time, I will not add the red pepper, it was too spicy for me. Thanks for sharing!

Made this tonight. I've made two other orange/asian chicken recipes before this one and this one topped them all. I too doubled the sauce and it was perfect. I also coated the chicken in flour, cornstarch, s and p, and garlic powder before cooking. This eliminated the need for a sauce thickener. It turned out great!!

Love this! Changes I made were to double the sauce and coat the chicken in flour before browning it. Then the sauce thickens up all by itself! I also cooked it for half the time as I made my chicken pieces fairly small. All my kids gobbled it up!

Excellent recipe, made it tonight for the first time, my guy and I loved it! I doubled the sauce recipe and glad that I did, the only ingredient that I did not double was the red pepper flakes, and it was still very spicy. I used approximately 2 1/3 pounds of chicken breast. I added some fresh grated ginger, also added about a 1/4 cup Hoisin sauce.  Served with brown rice and sugar snap beans. Will be making this again, and again, and again .... Thank you for sharing such a fantastic recipe!

Super easy and tasted like orange chicken!  Didn't have cornstarch but a little flour thickened the sauce perfectly!  Kids loved it!

Delicious! Even though the kids thought it was a little spicy, there were no leftovers because they had seconds and thirds.  Easy to make and wonderful to eat.

Awesome! my family loved this chicken, my husband said that this is the best orange chicken he's ever had, I made a some changes because i was in a rush I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, I seasoned the chicken with S&P only, and I fried it in olive oil, , I used a tbs of orange marmalade instead of the orange peel, and I used light brown sugar and rice vinegar for the sauce,  I also used frozen broccoli florets, with success boil in the bag rice.

Easy, fast, and you probably already have all the ingredients you need!  I added bell pepper and cut back on the crushed red pepper.

This dish is fabulous.  So many raters said "better than the restaurant version", and they were right.  In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if that's where this receipe came from.  I doubled the sauce.  I didn't need/use the cornstarch slurry, it wasn't necessary (the sauce thickened nicely on it's own).  So happy I came across this little dish!

This was fabulous!  I love Chinese and this orange sauce was one of the best I've had.  A couple tips to really make this meal shine: add a small can of chunk pineapple, brocolli,  and some red and green bell peppers. YUM!  I've also tried with the  breaded crispy chicken "nuggets" you can buy pre-cooked.  I heated them up in the oven to get them crispy, then added to the sauce. Delicious!

We thought this recipe was delicious, even my picky 2 year old liked it.  I will be making this again, though next time I would double the recipe (it didn't make near enough) and add a bit more spice maybe a little cayenne

OMG!  This is delicious!  I followed the directions exactly as written for the sauce and chicken.  The second time I made it I coated the chicken pieces in cornstarch and browned them, which gave them a nice crust.  I also added large chunks of softened onion, bell peppers and chinese snow peas.  It is kind of like a sweet and sour style chicken... fabulous both ways!  My family can't get enough and they thought I must have gotten take out. Thanks for sharing Scarlett!!

This is better than some restaurants! We are really lacking in good Chinese food where I live and this really hits the spot. I like to toss the chicken pieces in flour before I cook them so we get that breaded orange chicken but if you do that make sure you don't simmer it in the sauce more than a couple minutes or it will get soggy!

Great recipe.  Kids loved it and requested more.  I followed the suggestions and doubled the sauce.  I used 2 lbs of chicken and didn't need the cornstarch.

This was ok.  I doubled the sauce per other reviewers recommendations and I am glad I did - we are definitely "sauce" people... but the chicken was pretty blah.  I'm not sure what I could have done differently - I suppose it's hard to cook chicken breasts in cubes and not expect that they'll be a little tough/dry...

Great Recipe! We are a gluten free household, and this satisfies our chinese food craving! ( We use Tamari instead of soy sauce ). I try to double the sauce when i make it so there is extra for the rice. Thank you for the recipe!!

So good and so easy! The only thing different I did was double the sauce. Served over rice and with sauteed fresh green beans. Will definitely make again and again.

One of my favorite dinners to make, it is simple to make and has a great flavor.  Every time I make it, my husband says it tastes like it's from a restaurant.  We like to have it with rice and edamame.

Delicious!  I dont normally post on recipes, but this one was awesome.  I think the 5 spice really makes it!  Dont try to substitute that.  I used lemon juice instead of OJ and doubled the sauce.  I will definitely be saving this recipe for later.

This is chicken with an orange sauce that is too running.   I was hoping it would form a sticky coating like orange chicken at an Asian restaurant, but it doesn't.  Not what I was expecting.

I made this the other night, and it didn't turn out well.
Im thinking I must have done something wrong though, since everyone else loved it so much. The sauce was REALLY strong tasting, like it should have had more water or something in it. 
I like strong flavours but this was insane, lol.
It also didn't look like the the pictures! My sauce turned out almost black. I can't figure it out. 
The version I made sucked, so it gets a 2, lol, but Im sure the REAL recipe is tasty. I am tempted to try again sometime, after my ruined version fades from memory a bit....

This was a good quick meal. I had to make a few changes to the original recipe. I didn't have any chinese 5 spice or orange juice. I substituted orange marmalade for the orange juice. I also added a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables.

This was great!! Some people said it didn't make enough sauce to also eat with their rice, but I thought it was the perfect amount. I do think there is *something* missing, some kind of orange punch that just wasn't there, but it was still delicious and I'm adding it to my list of regular meals. Next time I will add more orange juice and more orange peel and see if that works. Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe was amazingly good even without the Chinese 5 spice (we didn't have).  We breaded and deep fried the chicken, added brocolli to the sauce and let it simmer while the chicken was frying.  We added the chicken while slowly thickening the sauce.  No more Panda Express for us!  Thank you for this recipe!

EXCELLENT!!!
My son asked me " where did you get it from"
I doubled the recipe and thus quadrupled the sauce. the only problem that I experienced was it took a lot more corn starch to thicken it.
served it with the stir fried cabbage.
It looked and tasted just like a meal purchased at a chinese resturant.
Definetely will make again

Really yummy! I doubled the sauce too (not the red pepper flakes) and served it up stir-fry style with rice and veggies. I look forward to finding Chinese 5 spice but read that allspice could be used as a sub when necessary. My picky kids ate it up!

This is our second time having this recipe and it's a keeper. I have to omit the crushed red pepper flakes for the kids and I don't have Chinese five spice (nor can I find it) but it's good with and without! One down fall is that it doesn't make as much as you would think it would. I have a family of 5, and I doubled the sauce, like the suggestions say, and it barely feeds us. I used 4 regular size chicken breasts. Other than those small things, which are small things, this recipe is very good!

Awesome, I added mushrooms and onions, and turned out great. Another way to keep the chicken moist and good, right after you cook the chicken add the sauce for about 5 mins., then scoop out the chicken and set it in a separate bowl until you are done thickening the sauce

Thanks Scarlett. This is a wonderful dish. Easy, yummy, healthy. Everyone in my family loved it. It's a regular at our house now. Way better than take out. We like it with brown rice instead of white. Also, we've had it with boneless, skinless thighs as well, which are good for variety and lower cost. Other than that, no changes. It's perfect.

This had really nice flavor, although I could NOT find Chinese five-spice ANYWHERE!!  I used some red pepper and omitted the red pepper flakes (kids).  I also had no orange zest, which I think would have really added a nice orange-y flavor to this.  My only beef with this recipe was that after simmering my chicken (I used chicken breasts) for 30 minutes, it was dry and a little tough.  I think dark meat might be a better fit.  That, or I would fry the chicken using the Sesame Chicken recipe from this site (just the batter portion), then toss with the orange sauce and serve over rice.  I look forward to trying this again!

I forgot to put in the garlic and it was still great! We thoroughly enjoyed this and will make it again. Doubling the sauce is a must.

I really liked this recipe and so did my husband but my kids were not crazy about it.  They ate it but didn't rave over it at all.  I say make this one for a romantic night with your special someone.

This was good, I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce.  I made this again and used only 1/4 teaspoon of the red pepper flake as it was too spicy for me to handle.

We made this twice.  It was interesting to use the 5 Chinese spices.  Luis did not eat the second batch.  He got bored w/ this recipe.  We are making a salmon dish this week so hopefully he won't get bored w/ it.

This was pretty good-I didn't have Chinese five-spice so I substituted cayenne pepper, otherwise stuck to the recipe as written. I found the sauce was rather runny even after adding the cornstarch/water mixture, but just turned up the heat and cooked another 10 minutes to evaporate excess liquid. In the future I will make the same sauce but prepare the chicken differently with a type of light coating and fry before mixing the chicken and sauce together. The flavor was quite good, just couldn't get the sauce to adhere to the chicken pieces like it would if there was a coating. Served with jasmine steamed rice and steamed snow peas.

This recipe was fantastic.  My family loved it and I will be making this again.  Tastes every bit as good as the local Chinese restaurant, but this is a healthier version.  I served it w/frozen potstickers.  Delicious!

Yum! I followed others advice and doubled the recipe. The amount of sauce that made was perfect with extra to go on the rice. I did 3 chicken breasts, cubed. I did not have the 5 spice so I omitted that and also the red pepper as my family does not like spicy. It turned out great. My 8 year old step son was saying "mmmm" throughout dinner!

VERY tastey.  Did as other suggested and doubled the sauce (but not the heat part and slurry), floured the chicken too.  We also threw in some broccoli during the last 15 mins with the sauce and chicken.  Both kids had no problem eating this.  It's a keeper.  Thanks Scarlett for sharing!

Made this the other night, definitely adding it to our house's favorite meals list!  My husband kept saying it was even better than a similar dish at P.F. Chang's, for wayyyyy less money!  I tweaked the recipe a bit to fit my needs, and it turned out great.  Didn't have soy sauce so I used 1 1/2 Tbsp worstershire sauce.  Also didn't have Chinese 5 spice powder, so I did a few shakes of paprika.  This dish had enough heat without being overpowering.  Oh I also used thighs, not breasts, because that's what I had thawed!  Great recipe, will definitely make again.

This is my first rating ever on this site.  I have to say this is a wonderful recipe. I did double the sauce and added mushrooms and it turned out great. I would add more veggies next time.  Carrots/Brocolli would be perfect.

Excellent recipe!  I did like others suggested and doubled the sauce and it turned out just right.  The only thing I might do different next time is to reduce the red pepper flakes.  It was a a bit too hot for me.

This was very good. I did not have the Chinese five-spice powder so I just left it out and it was still delicious. I doubled the sauce per other reviews, but felt it would have been enough as written in the recipe. My husband loved this and it had a bit of kick which was nice. Yum!

My family loved this recipe, such a melody of flavors. I used chicken thighs instead of breast. I think next time I might dip the chicken in rice flour before browning it.

I loved this recipe! I did not have chinese five-spice - but used a previous reviewers suggestions. I also did not add the cornstarch. I cooked this meal for my husband and my immediate family and they all loved it. My 4 yr old brother asked for seconds. Thanks Scarlett for a great recipe that I intend to keep for my permanent future menu.

This was excellent!  I made the sauce exactly as listed but did only use 1 lb. of chicken.  This left a little extra sauce for the rice and it was the perfect amount for 2 people!  Also, I used on 2 t. of olive oil instead of 2 T. to cook the chicken and the extra calories and fat were not missed with all the flavor in this dish. Love it!

I have to agree with most of the comments- this is a great dish- I also made some adjustments to it.   I doubled the sauce and cooked the chicken in pure sesame oil which gave it a really nice asian flavor.  I also used Rice Vinnegar instead of plain old white; I toasted some sesame seeds in the oven and stirred them into the chicken and sauce while it was about done simmering.    Next time I may throw in some brocolli and carrot to color it up a bit.

This was very good. I doubled the sauce, and I may even triple the next time I make this recipe. Have to be careful with the brown sugar and soy sauce and of course if you don't like spicy don't double that. I did not add the thickening agent. It reduced fine on its own.

My family thought this was good but I thought the seasoning was a little off.  I made this as written except I used cider vinegar instead of white.

Loved it! Even my picky eater ate his fill.  I took the other reviewers' suggestion and doubled the sauce. I didn't have the Chinese five spice powder, but that's okay as we don't care for overly spicy foods anyway. I actually cut the red pepper by half, even as I doubled the other ingredients. I substituted ginger for the five spice powder. It came out just right - tangy and sweet with a hint of spiciness.   I also did not bother with the cornstarch. As others have noted, the sauce thickens up nicely on it's own after simmering for 30 min.

This was easy and delicious!!  I didn't have any Chinese Spice so I looked it up and made my own.  the nice thing about the recipe is that you can do other things around the house while it simmers and the rice cooks.

Yum!  I like that this is not fried - my family didn't miss it a bit!  I doubled the sauce but kept the chicken the same.  So good over basmati rice with some toasted almonds on top for crunch.  A keeper!

I made this recipe with shrimp instead of chicken, allowing them to cook during the simmering part.  What a wonderful, flavorful, deliciously different sauce this was!!  It will definitely be served again and again!

The only thing I will do differently for next time is cut down the amount of brown sugar - it was very sweet for my preference.  But, the chicken came out vey tender and the rest of the flavors were great!  :)

It's nice but didn't wow me.  It's not offensive though and has a pleasant flavor.  Time will tell if I make it again.  I followed the recipe exactly and did not double the sauce, nor would I want to.  But if you like a lot of sauce with your stir fry, then you should double the sauce.  I also added the cornstarch and did not have a problem with the sauce being too thick.  In my mind, too think is as gelatinous as Panda Express orange chicken.  This isn't anywhere near that.  It would still all pass through a sieve, no problem.    I will say I think the rice instructions are wrong, so read your rice bag.  It's usually 2 cups water to 1 cup rice.    I added broccoli to our dish.  It worked.

This sauce was sweet and tangy. I didn't use the Chinese five spice but substituted cayenne pepper and ground ginger. It was still very enjoyable and I plan to put it on the menu in the future. My recommendation is to double the sauce and add some vegetables. I like broccoli but my fiance prefers snow peas.

Thought this was very tasty; doubled the saucy and then simmered it down for a while while we waited for rice to finish instead of adding cornstarch.  The doubling (done per other reviewer's suggestion) would have left it very saucy if I hadn't reduced it so much and just thickened.  The recipe as-is would have been enough for us.  Liked the amount of red pepper flakes; just enough to keep it warm on the palate.  Also, while I like the taste and texture of pan-fried chicken, I think the amount of cooking may have dried the chicken out a little.

I made this chicken for a group of friends and they absolutely loved it! I doubled the recipe and tripled the sauce mixture (since I doubled the chicken). I also used chicken broth in place of most of the water and used cayenne powder since I didn't have Chinese five-spice powder. What I love about this recipe is that is very easy and most of the ingredients for the sauce are things you probably already have in the kitchen. Fabulous dish!

Great flavour, easy and quick to make but next time I'll use boneless, skinless, chicken thighs. My stove top doesn't do simmer very well and I find the breasts dry out and get chewy when I cook them for longer periods, even in sauce. Canadian gal

I used less sugar than it called for and still a little sweet for us.  Also doubled the sauce and added fresh ginger.   Added broccoli too.  Good healthy meal.  I will make it again with less sugar.

Very good recipe. I doubled certain parts of the sauce since I knew it wouldnt be enough for us. I also added in mushrooms,peppers, and bean sprouts. It stretched the meal farther and tasted great! Thank you for a wonderful recipe:)

I made this recipe exactly as is.  Very delicious. My husband loved it.  The only thing I might change is a little less red pepper flakes and if you want more sauce I would double the sauce ingredients. I also added steamed broccoli and sugar snap peas before serving over rice.  This is definately a keeper.

I loved this dish, a bit to spicy for my kids, so next time I might cut back on the crushed red pepper, but otherwise really good.  I think the sauce would be great over chicken wings and then served as an appetizer at a party.  Great recipe and easy!!!

Delicious! I made as written other than subbing the orance peel for extra orange juice and making about 1.5 times the sauce. I'd make again for sure.

Great recipe - a new favorite of my teenage daughter. I doubled the recipe except for the sugar. I used 1/3 cup instead of the full 1/2.  Also, I browned the chicken leaving the inside a little pink and then cooked with the sauce for 20 minutes. It was cooked through and tender.

I used 3 tblsp of concentrated orange juice for more orange flavor.  My husband really loved it.  The sauce was so flavorful and the chicken was very tender. I would cook this for company any day. Much healthier than the deep fried chicken versions.

Great recipe, my family loved it! Got the approval to make it again. I did like many other reviews and doubled the sauce but not the pepper flakes. I also did not have the Chinese five-spice so I added just a very small dash of cayenne pepper, be very careful this recipe can get spicy hot really fast. If your sauce thickens to much just thin it out with a little water. Perfect balance of spicy hot and sweet together. Yummy!

This is a nice tasting dish.  However, in my view, you can get the same results from buying bottled stir-fry sauce, and you'll have lots less dishes to clean up!  Also, I couldn't figure out why the recipe tells you to simmer the chicken for 1/2 hour!  It's boneless chicken which has been cut into chunks!  The chicken will be done in ALOT less time than 1/2 hour!!  Also, I added some stir-fry veggies to the dish - I recommend that, and I doubled the sauce because my family does not like dry rice. I agree with others who said it's too sweet.

This is fantastic! It's easy to make and I had all of the ingredients on hand. I did only put half the amount of red pepper flakes(my husband and I aren't huge on very spicy dishes), and nixed the Chinese Five-spice powder ... since it wasn't something I had in the cupboard, and it still turned out great! Not too spicy, and not too sweet! I will be making this again very soon!

We didn't have the Chinese Five Spice, so used other reviewers advice to substitute ginger.  That said, the flavors were weird, too much orange and not very good other flavors.

I used green pepper and added some mushrooms finely chopped to the sauce mixture, just cooked regular white rice I already had according to the box directions. Came out really well and made the whole house smell yummy!

We really enjoyed this dish!  My husband sometimes does not like "sweet" dishes, but he really liked it.  My 4 year old son was apprehensive to try the sauce with the chicken, but after he did he really liked it.  I omited some of the ingredients like red pepper flakes, white vinegar, and the Chinese seasoning and it was still tasty!!!  Thank you!

I made this last night for my husband and we really liked it a lot. We weren't too sure by the smell of the Chinese 5 spice powder (has a licorice smell), but it was really tasty and I will definitely make again. I too did not use the cornstarch, the sauce was already really thick and it didn't seem necessary. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

On the positive side, the consistency of the glaze on the chicken is just right.  The flavor, for me, left much to be desired.  After adding a bit more orange zest and brown sugar, it helped to give the dish a much more balanced sweet/savory/salty flavor.  Will not make this again.
