Put your rutabaga in the microwave like a potato, let it cool and it will peel and chop with ease.

I'm always curious to try new veggies. Last night was the first time either my boyfriend or I had ever eaten a rutabaga... and we loved it! Thank you for a yummy and easy recipe, great for first-timers. Yes, rutabagas are not easy to chop up... but use a quality knife and put a little muscle in it! It's worth it! Preparing and cooking the rutabagas was very similar to making mashed potatoes: the boiling times are about the same, and mashing them is about the same. Thank You for making me a rutabaga lover. This will now be incorporated into regular meal plans.

My husband enjoyed this recipe. I thought it was okay.  For some strange reason, my dish was quite watery and the milk didn't seem to blend as well as it should have.  After sitting for about 3 minutes, the milk sort of floated to the top and had to be mixed before each serving.  I finally placed it in the oven to try to dry it out...??

Yes, rutabaga is often so hard you want to use a hatchet.  But thats what made it a good veggie for the winter.

This recipe is a basic recipe and does the veggie justice.  The carrots tone down the unique taste of the root, and with just butter, a bit of salt and pepper........ good for you.  If one is used to sugared and seasoned foods, this recipe is not for you, unless you add to it.  Why not enjoy the rutabaga for itself?

The directions are incomplete-- it doesn't say what oven temperature to use or how long to cook!

perhaps it's just because I'm a southerner, but I found this recipe a little on the bland side.  I ended up sauteing the carrots (cut into matchsticks) and some onion in olive oil with fresh garlic, and I added ample pepper, salt, and a splash of balsamic vinaigrette to give it a little "oomph."  Still needs a little something else, though.  It was fun to try rutabagas!
