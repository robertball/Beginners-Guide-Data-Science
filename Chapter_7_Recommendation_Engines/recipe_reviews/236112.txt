This is my go-to chili recipe.  I love the mix of ground beef and italian sausage.

Prize-winning Chili Haiku: "Did a little swap. (But stayed true to recipe.) Good, just not awesome." Not a fan of the pinto bean, I replaced those w/ kidney beans; otherwise, was faithful to the recipe as written and thought it was a little more "yawn" than "yay." Sriracha sauce to the rescue!
