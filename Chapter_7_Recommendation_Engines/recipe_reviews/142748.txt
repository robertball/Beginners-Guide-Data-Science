This was very good!  I did add more ingredients for a more flavorful omelet.  I used chopped turkey bacon and leftover red skinned potatoes.  I added dried italian herb seasonings and a small amount of fresh shredded cheddar cheese.  Tasted great.

This receipe is good as is. The great thing about this basic receipe is you can add anything you want and it is good! Very versatile. We have added jalapeno jack cheese for extra kick.

I made this for a quick dinner after work last night.  We like having breakfast for dinner.  This was good and hearty, sort of comfort food.  I doubled the recipe since my husband is a big eater.  We finished it all!

This was very good, however it seemed like something was missing. Next time I will add some green pepper and onion too for flavor. Maybe a handful of shredded cheddar would make this even better. Ketchup was good with this. I had trouble flipping mine over, it sort of fell apart, but tasted fine.

Complete breakfast for the entire family. I added Italian Seasoning when I added the egg back to the skillet. Threw a handful of Colby cheese on top at the very end. YUM!

Great recipe!  I cook the potatoes a little longer, add a big handful of cheese, and half a pound of turkey sausage.  I also use turkey bacon instead of pork bacon.

So delicious and so easy. Made one batch exactly like recipe; the other, I added shredded cheddar cheese. Made an easy and quick dinner on a rainy night.

Thank you - very nice change from most breakfasts.  After cooking 4 pieces of extra thick bacon, saut√©ed 1/3 cup of chopped onions, 1/4 cup of chopped red bell pepper and 1 tablespoon of finely chopped hot peppers in the bacon grease.  While the potatoes cooked, beat eggs, vegetables, 1 tablespoon of sour cream and 1 tablespoon of cream together.  Served with sliced tomatoes.  Next time would use less potato or more eggs.

Not one of my favorite recipes. Took a lot of time to make and was just ok.  Wouldn't recommend it.

This is similar to the omelet I had my first night in Germany.  Next time, I'll add some onion and maybe some green pepper.  Served with some bread and salad, it would make a nice light meal.

We've made this for years, only we use Spam, and add lots of cheese.  The kids and husband love it, and it's a must make when camping!

I love this. It's tasty and very satisfying. I add onions and whatever veggies I might have on hand such as red/green bell peppers or squash.
