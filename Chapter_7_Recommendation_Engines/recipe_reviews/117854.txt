“I’m leaving on a jet plane” in the morning (again) and needed something for supper because I didn’t want restaurant food, but the challenge was that I hadn’t been grocery shopping in three weeks.  Nor did I want any leftovers.  With a No Name Steak in the freezer,  a couple of peppers , a red-ripe tomato and some parsley from the garden, an onion and some garlic in the bin, some rigatoni in the pantry and this recipe I put one, fine dinner on the table. I followed the recipe loosely, improvising a bit and not measuring precisely.  I did not include the balsamic – not a fan.  I didn’t broil the steak – I sliced it thinly while it was still partially frozen for ease in cutting.  I sautéed everything up with the seasoning and added fresh tomato and parsley at the last.  Tossed that good stuff up with some rigatoni, gave it a good sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan and had an excellent, impromptu dinner served in the time it took to boil the pasta.

I really liked this. For as much flavor as it had, it was pretty simple. I served it with some spicy fried potatoes.

This was delicious, and very easy.  I didn't have steak, only cubed beef, but I tossed it all together and cooked it that way, and it was really good.  It was a nice change from the usual pepper steak.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is very good! I followed the directions exactly; no need to make any changes. I doubled the seasonings for the peppers & onions and used the other half to season a side of angel hair pasta. I will definitely make this again.

I just used this recipe for the steak.  Broiled a 2/3lb bone-in steak for 3.5 minutes on both sides for a medium-rare.  Only used about 1/4 tsp for the Italian seasoning though...next time I will try 1/2 tsp instead.
