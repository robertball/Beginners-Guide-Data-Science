This came out really delicious!  The vanilla flavor and the sugar make it really sweet so much that the vodka taste almost disappears.

Mine came out on the sweet side.  I'm not sure if this is due to the type of plums I used or the amount of sugar in this recipe.  Guess I'll have to try again next year ;).  Very good in plumtinis.

I made this recipe following the instructions exactly. I also made another batch with less sugar. I did not use wax to seal the jars--I used regular mason jar lids, and I stored the jars in a cool dark place, shaking every week or so to combine ingredients. The results were very good. We enjoyed the lower sugar batch more than the full sugar one. The low sugar liqueur was plummier. I think the syrupy batch would make a good topping for dessert.
