FANTASTIC! I have to say that I, personally, did not make this, but my mom did and she shared...it was truly amazing. Just like you would get at the Italian bakery. She did say that it was a bit 'time consuming', but it was very easy, and because it was such a hit with the whole family, she would definitely make it again. She topped hers with tomatoes, caramelized onions and fresh mozzarella~YUM! I cannot wait to make this myself...VERY soon! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very good Focaccia! I used a very high protein European style bread flour and it was great.I thought before I baked it that the dough was a bit slack. It wasn't. The rise held up nicely with the hg flour. I had tried it with regular supermarket flour, and, no slam at Pillsbury, there's no comparison

This is an amazingly simple and, I'd say, forgiving recipe. I used fine semolina, instead of semolina flour and the result was great. The bread had a slight bite to it which was amazing. Thinly sliced olives on the top are an excellent addition, adding a little brine-iness to the bread. I served it with herb roasted chicken; was a great hit. Thank you Chef John!

This was very good! Was easy to make and tasted so elegant. However, it did not keep very well. it tasted chalky after a couple days.

Very nice and authentic tasting.  Family loved it.  All that olive oil made the difference, the focaccia tasted rich and delicious, I used sea salt in the recipe as well and thought it could have turned out just a tad more seasoned, but maybe if you use table salt you get the right amount.

It was easy and turned out really great. Just a tad too salty. Ill definitely make this again but of course with a little less salt :)

Used this for my Thanksgiving stuffing croutons. I substituted turkey spices for the rosemary in step one of the recipe, as well as for the topping with the sea salt. Worked great. Once it cooled, I cut it into 3/4 inch croutons, dried it a bit, and used it in my usual sausage stuffing recipe.

I made two of these for a dinner party last weekend, and everyone loved it! I served this with EVOO with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar for dipping. I didn't have any semolina flour, so I just used additional bread flour in place of it.

Check oil...says 6 tbsps.  But seems like 9 tbsps if you follow recipe to a T.  I stopped adding.

Wow! Really good bread. I made an 8 portion bread with italian spices, before the second rise I divide it into 2 and let it sit for 15 min then I sprinkle grated parmesan and black olives and placed the second dough on top pinching both together and bake

Followed the directions and the Focaccia was amazing, the best I’ve ever had in my life, better than ones from gourmet restaurants and even better than the one I’ve been dreaming of that I are in Italy!  It really does come out moist, and  for the ones I cooked a little much crunchy but still delicious. It really does smell and taste like It’s got butter in it, it’s a super easy recipie!

when i brushed over the oil in place of using normal olive oil i made a smoked garlic infused oil.

i putted one glove in a pan on high heat until it has nice char marks ather that i grabbed a little metal bowl (normally used to hold your boiled egg) and put the garlic in there with a tiny drizzle with oil (the pan stays dry) then i sprinkled some Rosemary around on the dry pan and closed it of with a full closed glas lit. let it smoke for around 6 minutes and then take the pan of the stove and put the piece of garlic in a glass of water to cool. while its cooling put in a small bowl some olive oil crushed rosemary and Italian spices and grate the now cooled garlic over the bowl. then you can heat it up with a pot (i used the microwave for 30 seconds) and its ready for use.

Turned out beautifully.  The only thing I would do differently is not brush the last bit of sea salt on as I ended up ‘brushing’ off the top.

We really enjoyed this! I didn't have access to fresh rosemary so I subbed in 1 tsp of Italian seasoning and topped it with freshly grated pecorino romano. I won't make this often but I will make it again.

The amount of olive oil seems excessive when you're making the dough, but I have to admit, the finished product is amazing.  I made this as a snack for my guests while finishing up the main meal - it was completely devoured and 4 people asked for the recipe.  It's that good!

This was fantastic. I reduced the bake time by 10 minutes, let it cool, sliced it in half, spread sauteed peppers, onions, garlic and chicken strips on  half, covered it with fresh sliced mozzarella, spinach and sliced tomatoes. Put the other half on top, drizzled with oil and Parmesan and baked for 10-15 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes and drizzled with sweet Balsamic reduction.

I made it many times my family and I just love it. There is a down side to it though, I now have to make it at least once a week otherwise |I am in trouble. I've made a variation of it with Kalamata olives, red onion, sundried tomato and once you get a hang of it sky is the limit.
Thank you very much for this and your other recipes and keep up the great work. P.S. I am actually working on one right now. It is in final stages of relaxing before going in the oven. I am attaching a picture of the one in progress and one of my previous ones.
Thanks again

This is the best focaccia I've ever made, but that's not saying much. :( I watched the video and printed the recipe but still made a mistake, which is that I put the rosemary, sea salt and olive oil on the bread before that final rise. It didn't rise as a result. So don't do what I did and it should be great. I made it for a dinner party and it was gobbled up in spite of not having that final rise airiness. Will try again, and should be able to give it 5 stars.

Hello  Chef thank you for your recipes. I am a big fan not into ratings but have always tried and enjoyed your unique recipes. I tried your focaccia bread and I know once I get it right its going to be amazing but until then, I have been having trouble with the dough not rising. I even used 2 different yeasts but no luck yet. Is it possibly due to semolina? or do you have any suggestions?
Thank you

It took me two tries to get this recipe right, but once I did, it was amazing. The first time I made it, it was dense but that is because I added more flour than it called for and I also did not kneed it enough. Now, I do not even add the last 1/4 cup of flour. I find that I don't even need it. I also use my stand mixer to kneed since I'm not very good at that yet. But definitely try this recipe. If you can get it right, it's to die for and it will probably be eaten within 24 hours!

It was very easy to make and taste delicious (I brought it to work with a artichoke dip and they were begging for the recipe lol

Tasty end result, but I had a hard time getting the yeast to start. I'm not sure mixing the salt (a yeast inhibitor) into the yeast with just 1/4 cup of flour as fuel was a great idea. Next time, I'll proof the yeast with the warm water, 1 teaspoon sugar, and the semolina flour and let that sit for 10 minutes or so until the yeast reactivates before adding the rest of the flour and the salt. I planned to top my focaccia with sliced kalamata olives, so I omitted the sea salt from the sprinkle mixture at the end, but I won't do that next time I make it. Kalamata olives or not, that little salty crunch is essential to the success of the recipe. My rating is based on the recipe as written, and the only reason it looses a star is because the yeast starter was slow. With the changes I proposed, it would be 5 stars easily.

This is crazy good...I tripled the recipe and in hindsight, I should've baked it 5 minutes longer because it was thicker, but it still came out fluffy without being gummy.  I also topped it with cooked Italian sausage and home fries during the dimpling stage, then drizzled an olive oil pureed with scallions after it came out of the oven, then sprinkled on som ekosher salt.  One warning:  Kneading  all that olive oil in stages is physical work.  Be prepared.

Hey there chef. I made this wonderful bread, but at the end it came out as a biscuit rather than a bread!!! The temperature was on 220 C and time was about 15 minutes. The dough hight was also like what you mentioned in the recipe and video... Could you please help me?

I had wanted to make this recipe for quite awhile after coming across chef John's video here on All Recipes, mainly because I was intrigued by the amount of olive oil in it. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out sooooo delicious! The olive oil, indeed, adds a rich buttery flavor to this focaccia and I will be making it again soon.

Great bread but loads of oil. I don't make it too often because of that.  Used thyme and rosemary mixed in bread and half amount of both on top. Need to cut back on the salt flakes a little, too salty.

Would give 10 stars if I could.  I used Italian seasoning instead of all rosemary (personal preference) and rapid rise yeast (because that's all I had).  Otherwise followed recipe exactly and ended up with a delicious, fragrant "loaf" that took 3.5 hours, start to finish.  Best eaten the day of, but left overs made tasty egg salad sandwiches the next day.  Another hit for Chef John.  You HAVE to make this bread; if I can do it anybody can.
