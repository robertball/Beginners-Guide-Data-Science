Absolutely amazing. I used beef back ribs and marrow bones, and had so much I needed 64oz of beef stock. I added extra curry powder, paprika, and ginger paste for the difference. I didnâ€™t have a Dutch oven, so it all went in a stock pot on medium low for 2.5 hours. Serving it over rice. Definitely making this often.
