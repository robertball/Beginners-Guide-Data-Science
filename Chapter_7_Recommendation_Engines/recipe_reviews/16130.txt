Good dressing, but I can't say it was outstanding.
Needs garlic, oregano, etc. for a little more flavor or zip.

Laura, thankyou, this is a great salad dressing! I did cut the sugar in 1/2, and added 1 crushed garlic clove. I didn't have lemon pepper so I followed another reviewer's advice and used lemon zest and black pepper. This reminded me of a wonderful dressing that my grandma used to make, thanks!

This is not only a fabulous dressing (even my kids said so) but a great marinade!  Both for chicken and pork chops!  I use less than half the oil though, otherwise it is perfect.

I tried this dressing a month ago, but I only had Garlic vinegar (rice vinegar) instead of balsmic vinegar.  IT WAS EXCELLENT!  I ate the whole bowl of salad and had to make my husband one for himself.  Actually this dressing is the only one I will now eat on my salad and have been able to lose 7 lbs the last month, I JUST LOVE THE TASTE OF THIS DRESSING!!!!!!!!!!!

This is one of my favorite dressings!  I have made it several times.  I like it best using 1/2 of the vinegar (1/4c) as 1/2 cup is too strong.  I have also made it with a brown sugar substitute which was good.

I scaled this recipe down to 3 servings.  Then I sauteed peppers, onions and zucchini and poured it over the vegetables.  Great in wraps!  Excellent dressing!

I liked this dressing - I halved it and then I added a bit more sugar to satisfy my sweet tooth. My husband felt the balsamic vinegar was a bit too pungent for his tastes - I plan on making it again with either regular vinegar or wine vinegar - and perhaps a bit less than the amount that the recipe called for.

I tried this dressing over a chicken vegetable salad - everything tasted so much different than a bitter vinegar-type dressing.  This dressing was sweet.

I thought this was going to taste better than I thought it would.  Didn't have very much flavor and a full tablespoon of lemon juice made it too tangy or something.  Maybe I didn't use the right kind of balsamic vinegar because it just didn't taste right.

I tried this one and it wasn't very good for salad. It would make a nice marinade for steak, pork. It was to thin for salad and it had to much vinegar. That's just my opinion of it, but someone else might love it. We all have different taste! Thanks for sharing .

This is a great, lite dressing to fit any salad. I also made one with only half the brown sugar and I put in a clove of garlic - it was delicious!

I've pretty much stopped buying salad dressing, because I use this recipe exclusively.  I leave out the lemon pepper- there's already lemon juice- and I throw in a pinch of red pepper flakes for a small zip.  I've also tried it with a hint of garlic, but either way, the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, brown sugar, and lemon juice are all you need for the best dressing.  Thanks for sharing, Laura!

Good base recipe for dressing, five star worthy once some garlic and oregano are added.  Whole family enjoyed this one not only as a dressing but also used as a dip for slices of sourdough bread.  thanks for sharing!

An uncomplicated and quick to make salad dressing that has very good flavor despite having so few ingredients.  I used good quality balsamic vinegar so I only needed 2/3 of the requested amount of brown sugar.

I loved this recipe! I did substitute kraft FAT FREE zesty Italian salad dressing for the oil. I just couldn't bring myself to eat that much oil, but even with the substitution it was fabulous! I ate it on a spring mix green salad and poured it over roasted red potatoes, yummy!

Freakin' amazing on a mixed spring green salad. I rubbed fresh garlic on my bowl before tossing a bit of the dressing on today's salad. VERY good. I think the garlic is a necessity but I'd pretty much add garlic to anything.

If you love balsamic and are a fan of sweet vinaigrettes you will love this!  I was looking for a dressing to go with greens, mandarin oranges, and pecans - this was perfect!!  I was skeptical when I tasted the dressing alone, but on the salad it was fantastic!!  I even ate a salad for breakfast because I just craved this dressing.  I did make one change - I used sukonot (granulated whole sugar cane) instead of the brown sugar.

This was excellent. I served it over a grilled chicken salad with spinach, dried cranberries, pecans, red pepper and carrots. I made two substitutions - I used Splenda instead of brown sugar, and I didn't have lemon pepper so I used the original Mrs. Dash's seasoning. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Yummy.

This would be more magical if the recipe included salt and had a different ratio of vinegar to oil -- I like a little less vinegar in my vinaigrettes. I made this as directed other than adding salt after I realized there was none included. With salt this is 5 stars, without it, 4 stars because it is a little flat. Thanks for sharing!

I recently went to a restaurant and was served a delicious homemade balsamic dressing with my salad.  The server told me the secret ingredient was the brown sugar.   This recipe tastes just like the restaurant dressing I had.  It's sooo good.  I used sunflower oil instead of olive oil and cane sugar instead of brown sugar because its what I had on hand.  Thanks for submitting this recipe!!

Very good. I used this recipe 2 nights this week. The first on mixed greens with cucumber, red grapes, and feta (which was fabulous), and the second on blanched, chilled asparagus with cucumber and red pepper (which was also fabulous). Depending on the quality of your balsamic, you may want to play with the brown sugar measurments. Thanks for the recipe!

You've made me a believer. I'm not normally a vinaigrette person, but this one has the perfect blend of flavors for a green salad.  I added these lovely toasted sesame seeds my mother brought me from Morocco that really added something to it.  I also subbed lime juice and pepper because that's what I had on hand.  Regardless of additions, the dressing is a masterpiece as-is.  Thanks!!

This dressing was very good.  Here's a variation I used.  Simmer some balsamic vinegar until it is reduces (the more it simmers, the sweeter it will be). You may want to play with the ratios of olive oil/vinegar until you get it to your liking. And you can then cut back (or eliminate) the brown sugar.  I made this with adding an avocado (mash up half of it, leave the the other half in chunks).  It gives a sweet and nutty dressing. Don't omit a squirt of lemon juice.  You definitely need the acid to help balance the sweet.

Simple, and tasty! I added silvered garlic into the dressing bottles and put a bit extra lemon pepper in for spice and it turned out wonderfully!

I loved this and so did my family when I used it on a salad at a picnic last weekend. I did use the lower sugar version of brown sugar and added a bit more. I used less vinegar.

Love it. It's the only thing I use now. Have made it with and without the clove of garlic. Great either way. Thanks for the recipe!

This was quite nice. For salad dressings, I usually take the lazy route and either buy a pre-made bottle, or just use oil and vinegar. This recipe is almost as easy as either of those, and is very tasty. I'll bookmark this and will probably make it again.

Loved it! I made some changes...like everyone does. I used about 1/4 tsp of galic powder, I left out the lemon only because I forgot to put it in. 1/4 tsp of salt and I used about 15 shakes of McCormick lemon and herb seasoning. Really good!

Wonderfully light and refreshing for a spinach salad!  I did cut back on the lemon pepper seasoning and only used a sprinkling of sugar.  I think this tastes even better the next day.
