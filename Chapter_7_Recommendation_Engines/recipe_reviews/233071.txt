My mother-in-law gave me this recipe years ago. She called it Jewish Coffee Cake (and she wasn't Jewish either). The only thing she did differently was to pour half of the batter in, sprinkle the topping, then pour the rest of the batter and sprinkle remaining topping. It's easy to make, tastes good, and everyone enjoys it.

I only used about 1/2 of the sugar/walnut mixture(skipped the butter) and it was sweet enough for my taste. I also split the mixture between the middle and top which worked well. For the yellow cake mix I substituted  1 1/2 cups flour+ 3tsp. baking powder+ 4tbs corn starch+ 1 1/3 cups sugar+ 2tsp vanilla as suggested by a user on a similar recipe. The texture was great, very fluffy and delicious, will definitely make again!

I also layer the brown sugar mixture, half in the middle and half on the top.  One time I was out of vanilla pudding and used butterscotch pudding, still turned out great.  Never have any leftover.

Hubs wanted something to take to his fishing buddies tomorrow.  I had everything on hand to make half of  this recipe, and it actually allowed me to use up half a cake mix and half a box of pudding mix that were leftover in the pantry.  I could see no reason why this called for that tiny bit of butter so I left it out.  I did however, add 2 T. of melted butter to the brown sugar/walnut mixture to moisten it up and I used half in the middle of the cake and half on top.  I used a 9” springform pan and baked this for 32 minutes.  I made Vanilla Glaze from this site to drizzle over the top, which worked out well.  Hubs came home proclaiming the fishing guys loved this, so five stars it is.  The only changes I would make next time, if making half he recipe, would be to make half again as much walnut/brown sugar mixture and I'd use an 8” inch pan to give this a little more height.

this was very good and extremely sweet. Totally easy to make. My family loved it. I would put a finer chop on the walnuts. The walnut mixture was totally delish and the whole recipe turned out well. Felt the top was bare after it came out of the oven, so a little powdered sugar was a nice addition.

Absolutely incredible recipe.  I only had French vanilla instant pudding as opposed to just straight vanilla so I don't know if that changed things, but if it did it was worth it. Plus I didn't have walnuts so I swapped them for pecans. Can't wait to make again!

This was pretty good. A very easy recipe to satisfy a sweet tooth craving! I also thought the top was a little bare so I made a thin icing glaze (about 1/4 cup of confectioners sugar, a dash of vanilla and a bit of milk to make a thin paste) and spread it overtop while the cake was still warm. It added to the sweetness of course but still think its better with it.

Great recipe! New Year's Day I found this recipe.  Only had butterscotch pudding and white cake mix. Made it anyway and it was a hit!  Thank you for making me look like I know what I'm doing. Lol Happy
 New year!

I used hickory nuts rather than walnuts. Best time I’ll save half of the nut mixture to use as a topping on the cake

Since my family does not care for nuts, I substituted the nuts in the streusel topping with some shredded coconut, oats and chocolate chips.  I followed the advice from others and spread half the batter, topped with half the streusel topping followed by the remaining batter and topping. I baked it a little under 40 minutes. It turned out delicious and I'll make it again.

I made this for Christmas and it was absolutely outstanding!  This is my new go-to coffee cake recipe.  Incredibly easy, moist, and very flavorful.  You can make this cake in less time than it takes to drive to a bakery and love it just as much.  I added a dusting of powdered sugar to the top for a seasonal look and used almonds because I had no walnuts.

I made this for my class at church. It turned out really well. Moist and rich. I made it with pecans instead because we have a friend with an allergy to walnuts. It would be great without the nuts and double the brown sugar. This will probably be my go-to coffee cake.

Not sure what went wrong, but the streusel sank to bottom of cake.  Still tasted good, but not very pretty.

Will definitely make it again.  Substituted pecans for walnuts, used the butter with the brown sugar and cinnamon and pecans.  

Used 3/4 of the cinnamon/pecan mixture after pouring 1/2  the batter into the pan.  Used the remaining on top.  

Used a 9 in springform pan, took 45 minutes used foil over top last 10 minutes to keep it from getting too brown. Everyone loved it.

Made as written except I didn't add the butter because I'd forgotten to let it soften. Not sure what difference that little amount of butter would have made... but this was delicious anyway.
Easy to make and moist. Will make again.

Made it exactly as the recipe said even though I planned to layer the cinnamon mixture, I just forgot. It was very moist, almost falling apart. Serve it at the Shaw B&B and the guests said they enjoyed it. Might try it again but bake it a little longer.

So, so good.  And very easy.  I was having company at the last minute and I had all the ingredients for this recipe.  I whipped it up and they all went for seconds.  This will be my "go-to" coffee cake recipe.  Just delish.

I made this with a gluten-free cake mix (pilsbury) and it worked great!  I only had about a half-cup of oil in the cupboard, so I just used that and it was still moist.  Will probably only use a half-cup next time as well.  My boys loved it.

It had great flavor and we really enjoyed it, but when I make it again I think I would cut back on the amount of nuts and brown sugar and maybe try a bundt pan.

A co-worker gave me this recipe over 20 years ago and it's still my preferred coffee cake recipe. I do put half of the streussel in between the layers and the other half on top. It always comes out moist, it's always a hit.

I had never made a coffee cake before, but I was attending a brunch and needed something fast. It was so simple. Like others, I layered the brown sugar mixture with half in the middle and half on top. I used red velvet cake mix, because that's all I had in the house -- and it was definitely noticed (in a good way!). I would definitely try this with various mixed and puddings.
