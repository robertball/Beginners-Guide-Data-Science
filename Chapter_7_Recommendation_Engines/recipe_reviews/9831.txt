This is a great recipe but if you want a more fudgey, chocolatey brownie use 3 eggs instead of four and use 1 cup of flour instead of 1 1/2. The more eggs you use, the more cake-like your brownies will be and the more flour you use, the less chocolatey they will taste.

I followed the recipe to a 'T'...read the reviews first and the repeating responses of not chocolatey or sweet enough but decided to follow exactly and could always add a frosting if not sweet enough.  I gave a '4' rating because of ease of presentation, just the right size for a 9x13 pan, they baked up beautifully in my oven for 28 minutes(just until they started to pull away from the sides of the pan), and there were no scorches, burns, and very evenly baked.  The texture is somewhere between cakey and fudgey so I think they would be suitable to please everyone on both ends of the sprectrum.  The color is not a deep chocolate color so do agree they need more chocolate, and they are not really sweet enough.  I am going to finish these off with a frosting and they will be lovely.  I did add a bunch of chopped walnuts to the batter but kept everything else the same.  They would be better if a bit more chocolate and sugar were in the recipe.  I'm still searching for a really fudgey rich brownie like my friend Joan used to make.

These are some of the best brownies I have eaten. I have tried many different recipes but they never seem to be the right consistency of fudgy/cakey. These are perfect. The joke amongst my friends and I is that you can't have just one. It is unfortunately true.

These are awesome! My family attacked them right out of the oven. I used 3 tablespoons cocoa to 1 tablespoon canola oil as a substitute for each choc. square. Super fantastic!

I made a few changes, and out came the BEST brownies:
Used 8oz dark chocolate (70%)
Used 1cup dark brown sugar with 1cup white sugar.
I mixed the eggs with both sugars until almost double the volume, then added the vanilla, chocolate mixture, and finally the flour mixture.  Baked for 30 min in a pan lined with parchment paper, and it came out just great!

I halved the recipe and cooked in an 8"x8" pan...the results were amazing!  I confess to eating most of the brownies myself instead of the house guests they were meant for.  They made great brownie sundaes and held up well in packed lunches (mine, of course).  I wouldn't put frosting on them...they were great as is.

If I could give this more than a five star rating, I would'  Absolutely one of the best brownie recipes ever.  Added 2 T cocoa powder, a bit more semisweet chocolate, and walnuts.  Had to make twice within 12 hours for family.  What a hit' Thanks'

These are delicious! Great warm with powdered sugar on top with vanilla ice cream. Instead of using chocolate squares I used 3 tablespoons plus one of vegetable oil of unsweetened cocoa for one square. Add an extra tablespoon of cocoa at the end for a more chocolatey taste.

I just made these brownies for a dinner party and they were disappointing.  They are very cakee and not chocolaty.  I thought they where a 2 but everyone else gave them a 3.  I would not make these again.

I took PamMar's suggestion and used three eggs and cut back the flour to one cup. I really wanted them to pack a chocolate punch so I used 4 ounces Scharffen Berger unsweetened DARK chocolate (you can find this brand at any Giant Eagle) and added a half cup or so of mini chocolate chips. I baked these in my Perfect Brownie Pan--thirty minutes at 350* was.......perfect. They turned out fudge-y and just over the top delicious.

I made these twice. The first time I agreed with some other reviewers who thought they weren't chocolate-y or fudgy enough. The only change I made when I made them the second time was to decrease the amount of flour from 1 1/2  cups to just 1 Cup. It did the trick!

4 1/2  I use this recipe all the time and it is very popular with my church friends.  I use half regular cocoa and 1/2 extra dark premium cocoa or special dark.  Also add 2 or 3 TBSp extra cocoa.  I also throw in a generous helping of good quality chocolate chips and then frost with chocolate butter cream frosting.  Yum.

Very good recipe, however i did make a few changes to suit my taste. I used 3 eggs instead of 4, and i added 1/2 cup of peanut butter and one small package of dream whip. Then i cut back on the flour by only using 1/2 cup. With the dream whip it puts some thickness into it and you won't need as much. Plus i added some pecans. Try it yourself it is wonderful!!!!

followed recipe exactly, took a lot more than 25-30 minutes at 350 F.  Taste was nothing spectacular.  Have way better recipes than this, should have stuck to them.  These are easy to make though.

I used semi sweet squares and then added 4 T of cocoa powder and it made it even more rich and a little less sweet! I also added white chocolate chips,dark chocolate chips, and semi-sweet chips, and the pan was gone by the end of the night!!!

pretty good recipe but definitely needs 1 cup of flour instead of 1 1/2 and 3 eggs not 4. I used bittersweet chocolate and added 1/3 cup of milk chocolate chips and 1/3 cup of chopped walnuts. For coffee lovers - try adding 1 tsp of instant coffee (decaf works well too).

I loved this recipe! I disagree with those who've said it's not sweet enough. Next time, I will use 6 squares of chocolate instead of 4 to make it a bit more chocolatey. Thanks for posting this, Linda.

I tried this recipe 2 different times, and usually everything I bake comes out perfectly, pretty much... But these came out not so great both times! The first time I used the suggestions of other reviewers, and cut the flour down to one cup, and only used 3 eggs...  But they were way too dense and gooey- not in a good way...  The next time I used the recipe as it is written, and they still came out bad, they just taste like they are missing something, maybe baking soda?  I will not be using this recipe again- they just aren't good brownies.

Amazing! I did some slight modifications. I halved the amount of bakers chocolate, and instead added 6 TBS of Dutched cocoa and 3 TBS of Canola Oil. This gets rid of any lack of cocolate flavor. I then added some out of the can 'Fudgey Chocolate' frosting. Heaven in a Brownie! One of my favorite all recipes yet!

I made these at the last minute before my sister came to visit.  I didn't have unsweetened choc. so I used semi-sweet and scant cups of sugar.  My sister (a brownie lover) raved about them claiming they were the best brownie she ever tasted!!!!!!!!  I thought they were a little sweet, so I would probably cut the sugar a little more when using semi-sweet.  Still...an AWESOME brownie!! (I used 9x13 pan and they came out about 1/2-3/4 inch think.  SUPER!

I found this recipe on this site and read all of the reviews, finding many of them very useful.  I use 2 eggs, unsweetened butter, and 1 cup flour, and substitute Ghirardelli's semi-sweet chocolate chips for the nuts. I also use Ghirardelli's 70% cacao extra bittersweet chocolate instead of unsweetened.  Rather than waiting for the brownies to pull away from the sides, I test the center to make sure a toothpick comes out clean.  Anyone who can follow directions will end up with spectacular brownie.  People go crazy about my brownies--I have probably given out my version to about 40 people.  PS Don't worry if they seem wet when you cut them--they are not underdone as long as the toothpick comes out clean.

This turned out great the first time I made them..fudgy & gooey. I kicked it up a little the 2nd time by adding 4TB cocoa powder and a few chips & some M&Ms left in the bottom of a bag that was hanging around. They took me to the hospital for chocolate overdose.

Make sure chocolate mixture is not too hot to add eggs you may be prematurely cooking your eggs.  This was an awesome brownie recipe.  Next batch I will increase chocolate by a square and add 1 tsp of cinnamon.     MMMMMGood!

Before these brownies, I had always made them from a package.  I used some of the suggestions made by other reviewers and they turned out really well and were super easy to make.    If you don't really like a cakey brownie, do what I did.  I only used 3 eggs and 1 cup of flour.  I also added 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and a splash of cold coffee for more flavor.  The coffee thinned the batter a bit, though, so they took longer to cook.  I will definitely be making them again.

This came out quite awful! But, I don't really blame the recipe. I think it was my fault for using the 4 blocks of unsweetened chocolate (which it told me to do) and not melting it enough. I tasted only the flour and other ingredients and then the unsweetened chocolate in other places. Very disgusting.

These are the best brownies I think I've ever had. My husband requests them once a month and affectionately refers them as "crack brownies" because once you've tasted them you find yourself wanting seconds, then thirds...  I didn't have baking chocolate on hand so I used a 3.5oz 72% cacao Godiva chocolate bar to melt into the butter and then added 2 TBSP of Scharffen Berger unsweetened cocoa powder to the flour. Otherwise I followed the recipe They turned out perfectly sweet and deeply rich for my tastes.  Thank you to the wonderful person who originally posted this recipe!!!

My husband just walked in from work and asked if I had made brownies today, so I logged on and found this recipe.
I just finished making these brownies with 5 squares of semi sweet baking chocolate and 1 square of unsweetened baking chocolate because that was all I had on hand. I also added some unsweetened baking cocoa for good measure. I tossed in a handful of pecans as well. What a quick and yummy recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This is one of the best brownie recipes on this site.   Much prefer brownies that are made with chocolate and no baking powder.  For those who feel they are not sweet enough try substituting half semi sweet chocolate.

These brownies are quick, easy and awesome.  I tend to like fudge like brownies, so I followed the advice of PamMar by cutting the eggs down to 3 and flour to only 1 cup.  I also did add a bit more chocolate in the form of dark chocolate cocoa, and they were wonderful!  If you like cake like brownies, they are probably yummy as is.  If you like fudge like, very chocolate brownies, cut the eggs/flour and add more chocolate.

The kids loved it but I just added a little more chocolate to the mix and sprinkled the top with chopped nuts.

Very good recipe - to me this is the quintessential brownie.  They were not extremely sweet but could be iced if you like them sweeter.  I made them according to directions except (accidentally) left out the salt.

I followed the tip from the other reviewer who doubled the chocolate, used 1 c brown sugar, and beat the eggs separately with the sugar first. (Though I only used six 1-ounce squares of unsweetened chocolate (didn't have 8 squares handy)). I thought the brownies came out nicely, though a bit plain tasting. I was fine with them not being super sweet, but I think next time I try this recipe, I would add coconut or peanut butter (or chocolate chips) to give the brownies more volume and flavor. Overall not bad at all and very easy to make.

These brownies were ALMOST ideal, but even though I added chocolate chips (as one reviewer recommended), they were still not sweet enough.  The texture is pretty good, but I would prefer them more dense and soft inside.

I thought these were great. I was worried when people said they weren't that chocolatey, so i threw in about 1 c. mini choc. chips. They taste delicious, and the texture is perfect. Not too gooey/fudgy, and not too dry/cakey. A happy medium. I will put some frosting on next time for fun. yummy stuff.

Keep in mind that I am visually impaired so for me to even attempt at this well let’s just say, that it’s going to come out a little bit odd. For my recipe I used a 9/3two bags of brownie mix, half of a bag of chocolate chips, two eggs, 1 cup of water and 1/3 cup vegetable oil. After I got the oven preheated to the temperature it actually

Definitely needs more chocolate. As suggested in comments, I dropped some flour and one egg, and it didn't help. It was very thick  batter, and the end result was extremely gooey. They are definitely sweet enough with the two cups of sugar, though.

Pick this because of the few ingredients already available in my pantry for a midnight snack.I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x8 pan. Good texture. Outside was chewy and inside fudgey if you don't overbake it. Flavour wasn't chocolatey enough though. Next time I'll throw in some cocoa or maybe more chocolate.
