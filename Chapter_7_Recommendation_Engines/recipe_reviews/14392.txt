This was quite a hit at a ladies' luncheon.  Everyone requested the recipe.  I cut the zucchinis in half lengthwise before slicing, and this made nice bite-size pieces.

This was good but definately has to sit overnight.  I made it for company and served the same day - it didn't compare to how it tasted once it sat the following day!  Very yummy.

This is a GREAT salad.  Using SPLENDA instead of sugar allowed me to serve this to a diabetic friend and it was a hit!!  A few other changes - Red wine vinegar instead of white wine,  and I added yellow sweet peppers for color and about 1/2 sliced Vidalia onion.  This is a definite keeper recipe.

After baking 689 loaves of zucchini bread, I STILL have zucchini I don't know what to do with!  This recipe came out phenomenal.  I threw in just about every veggie I could find in my frige-cherry tomatoes cut in half, red onion, cucumber, broccoli, sliced olives, even a can of garbanzo beans!  Just make sure you don't over do the vinegar (I only used the 1/2 cup white vinegar, not the cider vinegar).  I have also made this succulent salad with rice wine vinegar, brown sugar, and a dash of soy sauce for a more Asian approach.  It was good!

I only tried this because I had loads of zucchini. I expected my family not to care for it.  We loved it!  Really wonderful summer recipe.
I never thought we would like raw zucchini.

It was wonderful.  I will also use the dressing for other things when Zucchini season is over.  I think it will make a great 3 bean salad dressing. This salad was great the next day and was not soggy.

I thought the onion soup mix would be gross, but you could barely taste it.  I didn't have white wine vinegar so I used red wine vinegar and was still very good.  Made two batches and it disappeared!!

Very good. As other reviewers suggested, I made it the night before so the flavor would be enhanced. I also used red pepper for color.  It's a good (and different way) of using up an abundance of zucchini.  I'll make this recipe again.

Wonderful flavor. I didn't use the peppers. Instead added more squash. Not just zucchini, but a mixture of yellow squash and zucchini. My family loved this dish. Thanks for a fresh and interesting way to use the squash from our garden.

I loved this!  Even my husband who doesn't eat zucchini ate this.  I modified slightly by substituting rice vinegar for 1/2 the white wine vinegar.  Also used red peppers instead of green.  Note: you should probably double this recipe since it will go FAST....

This salad was a little too vinegary for us.  I think if I make it again I will use 1/2 vinegar and 1/2 water.  Also the onion soup was a little strange.  I think I would like it better with fresh onion.  Sorry.

This is a great alternative to a lettuce salad.  Surprisingly, it has a very similar flavor to three bean salad.  I followed the directions precisely and also let it marinate overnight.  Next time, I will use red bell pepper instead of green for a slight taste variation and more color.

Very tasty recipe!  I did not use the cider vinegar, because there was plenty of marinade with the oil and white wine vinegar.  Since I do not like celery, I used sugar snap peas, instead.  I wouldn't have touched this as a kid, but I will definitely make it again.  I made it for a family dinner gathering and people loved it!

I brought this to a staff picnic, everyone loved it!  I used red wine vinegar instead of white (because I didn't have any). I also used red pepper instead of green to add some color. I took the advice of other reviewers and made it the night before so it could marinate overnight.

This is yummy. Even my husband who doesn't like zucchini said "I can eat zucchini this way." The dressing is the star and zucchini's inherent blandness lets it take center stage. I used Splenda to cut the calories and it was fine that way. I left out the cider vinegar because when I made it, I tasted it and the vinegar taste was strong. However, that does mellow as it sits. May try it with next time. Definitely want to let this sit before serving. Dressing is too strong on the vinegar if you make and serve immediately. Didn't know how 7 small zucchini measured up to the huge ones from my garden. I used 3 lbs but could easily have done 4 lbs. Added half a red onion because I had it. Really could add any crunchy veggie you want such as broccoli or carrots. There is plenty of dressing to accommodate more veggies. Just depends on how many servings you want to get from it. With 3 lbs. of zucchini and the onion, I did get 7 servings. More veggies would have bumped that up to probably 10. A great way to use up the summer zucchini crop.

I made this for a summer potluck, and it was the most interesting thing on the table.  Hard to believe, but the onion soup gave it such a great flavor.  You MUST make it a day ahead in order for the flavors to marry.

I substituted red wine vinegar for both the vinegars that the recipe called for, julienned the zucchini and refrigerated overnight. Made it to bring to a friends BBQ at her beach house-everyone loved it! Next time I make it I will use a red or orange pepper for color.

Followed directions, no modifications.  Served with potato salad with radishes and olives--recipe on this site.  This salad overpowered the potato salad but the combination seeemed to work well.  Might add dill and more pepper to the potato salad next go-around.

Just made minutes ago with only zucchini because that is all I have at midnight, and although I agree that it needs to marinate, but this dressing is AMAZING!!  Of course it's a vinegar based dressing, LOVE IT!  Onlly added 1/2 c sugar figuring I can add more after it sits overnight if I want, but for now I'm already wondering what else I can use this dressing on.   Yes I was skeptical w the onion soup, but genius!  Thank you for sharing!

changed the oil to canola oil, took out the salt and apple cider vinegar added sweet onions and yellow bell pepper. chopped the zucchini into cubes. Make sure to chill overnight. I also made my own onion soup mix to control salt.

Thought the soup mix would be a little weird - but it's really yummy!  I added scallions and left out the celery, but followed everything else exactly!  My 11 yr old daughter ate a bowlful and my zucchini-hating husband even liked it!  Am going to make to bring to a picnic this weekend, only I'm going to play a little and add garlic and some crushed red pepper flakes.

I really loved the flavor of this.  As others have noted, it is a lot of dressing, so I was able to add other vegetables later.  Instead of green pepper, I used yellow and red ones.  Instead of celery, I used asparagus.  My only real reason for giving it a 4 instead of a 5 is the appearance.  It looks fine when first prepared.  But after sitting in fridge, the onion soup mix/dressing kind of coagulates, causing the bits of onion to stick to the side of the bowl, and look like things growing on the vegetables.  But if you can get past this, it really is delicious.

What a great dish. I did use splenda, 1/2 cup and I didn't have cider vinegar so i used red wine vinegar. The FIRST day we had it I only had time for it to marinade 5 hours. Company loved it. It was a perfect mix of vinegar and onions. Day 2, I added more zucchini and took it to a pool party. Rave reviews again. Unfortunately, not as oniony today Day 3, I have thrown in cauliflower and peppers. I will be so sorry when it is gone. Tomorrow will be our last meal of it.

A great dish for a potluck.  We didn't have any white wine vinegar, so we substituted rice vinegar instead and the flavor was great.

PERFECT for summer!  And a great way to use up all that zucchini from your garden!  I made this to bring to a 4th of July party and 2 people asked me for the recipe!
I accidently bought rasberry flavored white wine vinigar, but I think that made it even more of a summery dish and I will make it that way again!

I wish I would've discovered this recipe years ago - it's a delicious salad that's easy to put together. Even though I like zucchini I was dubious I'd like a salad of raw zucchini, so I was pleasantly surprised at how good this dish is. The rest of my family liked it too, though I practically had to threaten them to get them to try it. This would make a great potluck vegetable dish.

Refrigerate overnight for best flavors.  Also, 1/2 onion mix would cut down on overall salt intake, and less vinegar would be my suggestion.  Too salty, too tart.  But, the real test is the folks I served it to; THEY LOVED IT!  So, the 4 stars is my taste; 5 would be the eaters.

This was seriously sooo good!  And easy to make, too!  I marinated for about 6 hours, mixing it up every couple and it was perfect!!  As recommended by other reviewers I subbed red wine vinegar for the white wine. I also used slightly less sugar (maybe 1/2 cup) due to my own personal preference. I had some extra cucumbers on hand that I needed to use up so I added that to the  mix. Everyone in my family LOVED it! This is definitely a keeper.  One thing to note:  When I first mixed it up I didn't think there was near enough liquid. But as it marinates, it draws out the water in the zucchini - hence the reason for mixing it up every couple of hours.  By the time it's ready there will be more than enough liquid, so don't add any additional!  Thanks for the great recipe, Christy!

I made this recipe but with some alterations.  We have some restrictions and so altered to fit our family.  I shredded 2 zucchini; used 2 large white mushrooms sliced, coconut sugar instead of regular sugar, lobster pieces and green onions added instead of bell pepper and celery.  Absolutely delicious, highly recommend it!

It seems that I always get those onion soup packets every time I buy a mayo and never knew what to do with it.   I made it a day before.  My hubby and I both agreed that it was too sweet.  Although I did not care for this, he loved this so I gave 4 stars.

This salad is amazing! The dressing is fantastic, almost like a sweet onion vinaigrette. It's definitely going to be my new go to recipe for BBQs and whatnot.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that I think it should really say  sugar to taste. I didn't use anywhere near 3/4 of a cup. I would say start with 1/4 cup and go from there. Also, the more veggies you add, the better it tastes. Seriously, you need to try this right now!

I made this recipe this weekend.  I made per recipe except added red bell pepper instead of green.  I also omitted the extra teaspoon of salt.  I think the onion soup mix has enough salt.  It was wonderful.  Even my picky husband liked it!  I am going to make this again this weekend for Labor Day.  Thank you!

Had to do a side dish for a gathering of friends and was not too sure how this would go down. Used the main recipe but substituted a few items, canola for the vegetable oil, ranch dressing for onion soup mix, red wine vinegar for the white, a combo of yellow and red bell peppers, no green, added snap peas, scallions and a few slices of onions medium chopped. Many complements and only one serving was left. One of the friends who already had 2 servings with the meal took it home with her and asked for the recipe. Very different way to serve vegetables and definitely will do this again.

Really refreshing and yummy! I used rice vinegar mixed with red wine vinegar in place of the white wine vinegar and did not add the extra cider vinegar.  It was just the right amount.  I used a ranch dressing mix instead of the onion soup mix, as it was what I had on hand.  I also added apples, a couple of green onions and a handful of sunflower seeds.

This is a keeper recipe for sure!  I added dry ramen noodles broken up in it.  Let them soak up some of the liquid before serving.

Loved this recipe!  My husband hates zucchini, but took seconds.  I used a yellow bell pepper instead of green since it's a little sweeter, delicious!

This is my go to recipe when zucchini is in season, but after adopting a healthier lifestyle I made a few switches to reduce the fat and calories.  I used 1/2c of fat-free Italian dressing instead of the oil, cider vinegar, salt and pepper.  Replaced the sugar with no calorie sweetener and used a whole red bell pepper.   It was a hit.

Wonderful side dish!!  I made the homemade dry oniion soup mix from this site instead of the packaged kind, sliced the zucchini into bite size pieces and used a red bell pepper as that is what I had on hand.  I let this sit in the fridge overnight, occasionally stirring ( and tasting...yum ).   Everyone loved this and there were no leftovers.  Thank you for sharing a delicious different way to use zucchini, CHRISTYJ.
