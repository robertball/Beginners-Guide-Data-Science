This recipe wasn't designed for the omega3's that ground flax offers.  It is more for fiber and to add a nutty flavor to the granola. However, if you chew the flax seed, you are grinding them, breaking them down and getting the benefits they offer.

Very poor recipe. Flax seed must be ground in order to benefit from the nutrients. Quinoa is a wonderful grain but not like this.

Has the consistancy of something like bird food, but has a good flavor.  I added more cinnamon and some dried apples as well.

I like this because there are no oats which I react to. It is very granular though. I did change it a lot. I used mostly puffed quinoa but the rest was red quinoa, liquid honey rather than maple syrup, organic coconut oil to have a softer taste & I used sesame seeds in place of flax seeds for calcium and because that is what I had on hand. DD1 (years old and I liked it sprinkled over yogurt & bananas with extra liquid honey drizzled on top.

I used this as cereal and loved it. I substituded the flax seed with walnuts and added a ripe peach. It's filling and very crunchy wich is a win win for me.

I like quinoa but didn't care for this one to much. Even though it was easy to put together, I had problems with picking the tiny seeds out of my teeth and it didn't make it enjoyable to eat and the flavor wasn't that great. I felt it was too small for granola the way it was and personally, we weren't crazy about it. Sorry, won't make again.
