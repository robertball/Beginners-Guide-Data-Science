The acorn squash has been on my kitchen table since mid October with other small pumpkins and gourds. I decided to roast it since I have never cooked acorn squash. This recipe was easy and delicious. My husband doesn't like squash but I put it on his plate with rice and chicken for dinner and he told me the sweet potatoes were excellent! Yay! I will make this again.

Very simple acorn squash recipe, but, it was very tasty and a perfect fall side dish.  It did not take a full hour for mine to cook, but, it could have been the size of my squash.  Mine was completely soft at about 35-40 minutes.   I also didn't use the full amount or salt or butter, but, again it probably was because of the size of my squash.  I think you will just need to see how much flesh you get from the squash and decide on the quantity of the butter and salt you need to add so it isn't too salty or greasy.  Thanks for the recipe!
