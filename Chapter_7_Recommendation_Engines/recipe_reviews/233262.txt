I made this in the a.m. and ate it in the p.m. to give it a chance to come together. I'm not quite sure what this needs but I found it to be a bit bland. Then again, what the heck do I know? I think everything needs some spicy heat. Maybe more onions and radishes. I'm not even sure what the standard is for radishes in a bunch. Oh well, I will try this again and add some diced jalapenos.

I was looking up something quick and easy to make with my radishes and came across this. I had to make due with what i had and thankfully it came out amazing. I used miracle whip and greek yogurt instead of mayo and sour cream..i thought it may be too sweet, but it is very very good. Excellent idea for use of cauliflower as well. I love this recipe, thank the original chef!

I made this for a family gathering this weekend. We enjoyed it; I think the crispness and freshness was a nice foil to the other rich foods we served. I did add a bit more parmesan cheese than the recipe called for. Use full fat sour cream and mayonnaise.

Didn't do it for us.  Maybe a little vinegar & salt would help.

I had a head of cauliflower and wanted to prepare it a different way then how I normally make it. I found this recipe to be very bland. I followed the directions as written.  After sampling it I made a few changes and salvaged the dish but I won't be making it again.  Everyone has different tastes so if it sounds good give it a try. That's what I do. ??

I made it mainly because I could use my radishes. We loved the crunchy texture with the creamy sauce. I've already been asked for the recipe. That's a win!
