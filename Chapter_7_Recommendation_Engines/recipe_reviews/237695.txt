This is an excellent dish.  Although it takes a while to cook, the prep time is moderate. The flavors blend very nicely into a new combination that is not dominated by any one ingredient.  I modified the recipe only by adding less water to keep it from being to "soupy".  Instead of the 2 quarts of water (10 cups) I added only 5 cups.  I am not really sure what purpose the ground beef provides and I may leave it out of future meals and substitute bulgar or an additional cup of freekeh with appropriate addition of water. The dish is moderately spicy and one could alter that by the number of Serrano peppers or Cayenne.  It freezes well for future enjoyment.

This is a warm variation on algerian traditional shorba. My husband and father in law love this soup and are algerian. I only use the stew meat but follow all other instructions.

Next time I will cook the hamburger separate and drain the grease. Not doing this led to it being a tad greasy. I will also add more spice. I made this for my Algerian boyfriend who was very excited when I told him the recipe I had found. He loved it but wanted it to be spicier.
