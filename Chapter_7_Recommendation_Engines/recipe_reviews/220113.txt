Thanks for trying my recipe and I'm glad you all liked it so much!  The only difference between this and Succotash is the addition of green lima beans.  Also, I noticed that some of the changes they made to my wording when the edited my recipe made it more difficult to understand.  The Thyme is optional and the Thyme and Parsley should be finely chopped, not minced.  Also, to cook and stir is to saute. I've used sweet corn or shoepeg corn for this recipe and it's wonderful either way. You can also substitute chicken broth for the beef broth and add a little sage, or substitute seafood broth and add schrimp for some different flavors.  Thanks again!

Hubs is in LA and I’m home by my lonesome.  As the saying goes, “When the cat’s away, the mice (make that mouse) will play.”   Dinner for me tonight was something I could never make if Hubs was home.  Halibut?  Nope – he doesn’t care for it.  Corn?  Not with his sensitive innards.  This corn maque choux, which I confess I was not familiar with, was just the thing for me to make tonight with the halibut.  Other than using chicken broth rather than beef, and cooking it WAY less time than the directed (whoa!) 20 minutes, I prepared this following the recipe fairly closely, but not measuring precisely.  It’s a pretty dish with lots of flavor, the humble vegetables enhanced and made better by, I might add, the bacon, fresh thyme, Creole seasoning and garlic.  This turned out to be just the right choice to serve with Baked Halibut with Crispy Panko, also from this site.

This is one delicious side dish.  I used yellow and white corn, more creole seasoning, spicy salt in place of the salt and cayene. Oh, and about four rashers of thick cut pepper bacon (more YUM!). I also used about a cup or so of beef broth and let it simmer down and absorb all of that flavor. Highly recommended, thanks so much for sharing this.  It's a do-over for sure.

Made this for Recipe Group...We really liked this a lot! I omitted the thyme, b/c I didn't have any and we are not big fans of it, but followed it otherwise. This was a nice change and will be a repeat side dish in my house~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great recipe, and easy to make.  Mostly I stuck to the recipe, but as suggested in the Allrecipes magazine, I used 6 slices of bacon.  I also used about 24 ounces of corn, instead of 20.  I will certainly be making this recipe again and again.

I really liked this!  I used a yellow pepper vs. celery because I thought it would blend in with my Mardi Gras theme better!!  I didn't use the bacon only because I have vegetarian friends.  I know it will be that much better with the bacon though!  
I also used cajun seasoning vs. creole because I wanted more spice.
Thanks Dumplin!!

Recipe Group Selection:  02, February 2013 ~ We enjoyed this side dish very much.  I didn’t have Creole seasoning, so I made up “Creole Seasoning Blend” from AR to use in this dish.  I had fresh corn that we froze during the summer so I used that instead of store-bought frozen corn.  We loved everything about this dish, from the sautéed vegetables to the seasoning to the taste of the corn itself.  I served this with hot ham and cheese sandwiches and a salad.  I knew that there would be leftovers, so I added the bacon right before serving so it wouldn’t get soggy.   Thanks Melody for sharing your recipe, it is a keeper in our house!

I made this recipe for the weekly recipe group selection. I've never had this dish before so can't really compare it to others. We enjoyed it, my son really loved it. I didn't simmer the veggies as long, we like a bit of crisp to them. Served up with  some grilled Cajun Chicken from this site, a great pair.

First time I've had Maque Choux so I have no basis of comparison.  Nontheless, this was delicious, spicy and a welcome change for side dishes.

This recipe was off-the-charts phenomenal.  We wolfed it down.  The only change we made was skipping the optional thyme.  So glad we found this recipe!

This was remarkable! Everyone had seconds! I was more liberal with the creole seasoning, which added a nice touch of heat to this dish. Plus I used chicken stock instead of beef. I also had made it earlier than I needed to, so the veggies were definitely not al dente. But the flavours of all the vegetables, broth, seasoning and bacon were able to marry so wonderfully. I will most certainly make this dish again! Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome.  Used fresh corn cut off the cob (its summer-sweet white corn).  Used 6 slices of bacon.  Crumbled and added right before serving.  Adds nice crunch. Used red and yellow pepper cause that's what I had on hand.  Also used Creole Seasoning, thought I had Cajun, but again used on hand.  Its a lot of cutting but definitely worth the work.  This is absolutely delish.  Will make for special occasions.

Wow is this delicious. I was cooking up a pound of bacon to freeze for making quick sandwiches and i figured since I had a pan with bacon fat I'd try this recipe. Glad I did. I will definitely make it again.

I followed this recipe to a "T" and while I liked it, the remaining family members were not as impressed.  It reminded me of a "succotash" dish that my mom used to serve when I was a kid.  The bacon and thyme were a nice addition, IMO.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, Melody!

This was really good!  My version:  I used packaged real bacon bits and olive oil instead of the bacon grease, chicken broth, and added a little sage in addition to the other seasonings. I was using a partial bag of corn so I intended to cut the recipe in half. But I forgot so I used all these ingredients for about 8-10 oz corn. Not too much in my opinion but I'm sure it would be great with the intended ratio of corn to everything else. Definitely a keeper!

Absolutely delicious as-is, but like other reviewers, I'd use 4-6 slices bacon.  I also used dried thyme instead of fresh, which worked just finne.

This was just utterly fantastic! I could not find a recipe and I even posted on Facebook, Allrecipes themselves helped me find this fantastic one ! I did everything exactly ( Well, I added an extra piece of bacon ) and it was just great!  Everybody should try this recipe at least once and try for themselves.

My husband make a Thanksgiving lunch for 20 people at his manufacturing plant. They asked him to make jambalaya because they all love his recipe. I found this recipe for him to serve as a side dish, and it tastes fabulous! He will have to make this again so I can have a big portion instead of the tiny spoonful I was allowed this morning. Thanks for posting this recipe.

Awesome!  Made for a work party and this was the only thing that had no leftovers and I made a double batch!   I used a good slab bacon with nice smokiness.

I doubled this recipe for a potluck dinner. I used 1/2 tsp. Creole seasoning and thick sliced bacon. It is absolutely delicious! Since it calls for freshly chopped parsley, I filled a baggie with my fresh cut parsley and tucked it in my purse to be sprinkled on just before serving. When I opened my purse after the meal, there it was. No harm done. Yummm!

Recipe Group selection 2/2/12.  We liked this so well I made it twice this week.  The first time I followed the recipe faithfully and that would have been rated 3.5 - 4 stars, but to be fair I have had this in NOLA at the restaurant Court of Two Sisters in the French Quarter and that was what I was measuring against, but I thought with a few small changes this could be as good.  So my changes were to use a Fresno pepper for the red and a Jalapeño for the green and replace the beef broth with chicken.  I also omitted the added salt, the bacon had enough for our taste.  Then I tossed  8 or 10 shrimp in for the last few minutes of cooking, oh and I used about a full tsp of homemade Creole seasoning.  It still wasn't what I remembered but the little extra kick was well received bu my family.  Thanks, Melodie.
