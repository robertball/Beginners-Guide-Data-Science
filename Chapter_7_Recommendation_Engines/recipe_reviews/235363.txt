I typically prefer my pulled pork with the sauce on the side but this was really good. The red pepper flakes are optional but I highly recommend using them. Thanks for a great sandwich!

I found the tomato paste was a little too overwhelming for my taste. I probably will not make this again.

The sauce is excellent! I added a heaping tablespoon more brown sugar. it just seemed to need it.

This was exactly what I was looking for!  Incredible sandwich.  All my boys loved it!  No one was talking while eating this, it was so good.  Nice rich  BBQ flavor.  I will definitely make this again
