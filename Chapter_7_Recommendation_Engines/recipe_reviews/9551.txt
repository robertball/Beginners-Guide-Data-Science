I tried this recipe twice, and I've perfected it now. The trick is to use confectioner's sugar, not white sugar like the recipe specifies. I tried once with white sugar and 2 times with confectioner's sugar. Confectioner's sugar is in 99% of fudge recipes - there were a lot of people on here saying their fudge came out grainy, and that would be why! So make sure to use confectioner's, and I've found that 7-8 minutes is the right amount of time for the "soft ball stage" to be reached, but you really ought to try it out in a cold glass of water every 30 seconds until it forms little balls in the water. I added a little more peanut butter in my 2nd try as well, maybe 1/8 cup more, and my family definitely liked it better, so if you're a PB stickler like me, add more peanut butter!

This is the fudge my Mother made. It does take white sugar, not powdered. The reason for the graininess, is stirring it too much. Mom always said, Don't monkey with it or it'll go sugary on you. Soft ball stage is dropping a teaspoon full in a cup cold water..If it stays together in a soft ball, it's done. Good luck with this recipe, once you do it right, you'll feel so accomplished.

I think the problem people were running into when they say this mixture never got to the "soft ball" stage is this: the soft ball stage does not mean that the mixture in the pan comes together in a ball, like dough does, but rather that a drop of the mixture, dropped into a glass of ice-cold water, will form a ball that flattens slightly when you place it on a flat surface. You can also tell the stage with a candy thermometer. This recipe is pretty sweet, but has a nice texture.

This recipe is missing a tsp. of vanilla extract at the end of the cooking process. This is the very same recipe that I lost that was my grandmothers. I agree with the othe lady,my grandmother always told me to leave it be as it cooked to. 

** Follow the recipe. Add the sugar, cocoa and milk.. Bring it to a slight boil.. Until the endges are boiling.. Turn the heat down and let it cook stirring OCASSIONALY... UNtil a soft ball forms in a seperate cup of cold water. 

Take it off of the fire and add 1 tsp of vanilla extract, the butter and peanut butter. (my family loves p3eanut butter so I added a cup to this recipe) stir vigorously until smooth. Then put the WHOLE PAN in a slightly larger pan of COLD WATER.. ( that grainey stuff.. this will stop the crystals from getting bigger) Stir until smooth. This is all a very quick process.  

Then butter your pan, pour in the fudge and place it in the fridge until it's hardened. You guys will love this recipe once you get the hang of leaving it alone to cook. I just got finished making this recipe. It took 20 minutes total and so far it is firming perfectly. 
I hope this helps you all. If you have a question. Email me at Zammada@Aol.com... Thanks, 
Crystal

Just responding to graininess issues - don't forget that candymaking is a crystallization project.  You need to form the proper sized crystals in your fudge to have a creamy texture.  If the crystals are allowed to grow to large, the candy becomes grainy and, if very large, hard and brittle.  You need to stop cooking fudge at the soft ball stage as measured by a properly calibrated thermometer.  If it is a recipe that requires beating, you need to stop as soon as it loses it's gloss; further beating allows crystal growth which changes the texture.

Also remembering that making any substitutions may change your inhibiting agents and allow crystals to grow larger as well.

Really Good, to be the first time that i make it of course we love peanut butter so instead of the original amount of peanut butter i used 1/2 Cup crunchy PB and 1/4 creamy PB and instead of evaporated milk i improvised and used normal 2% 1&1/2 C and also i added 1 Teaspoon of vanilla it came out sooooo creamy of course i added and extra 1 TSP of butter and cutted it as soon as it was semi cold kinda semi warm so it wont brake, i submited a pictured and guess what? it Melts in your mouth, not grainy or crystalized and even tho i dont have a candy thermometer i did it and just let it boiled till it became a very slow boil and all the way to the top, so for those who dont have a CT just let it boil till it raises like if its going to overboile and the trick is when it is boiling really slow like not boiling at all. I love it, and plan to make it again just as i did. again not bad for a first time make!!!! Jen

I followed this recipe and it was just like my mothers fudge.  We lost the recipe and now I found it again.  This is exactly like MOMS!  My family loves it.  I put 1 tsp of vanilla in at the end.  I used regular sugar and it turned out perfect.  Only needs to cook about 5-7 min. after a rolling boil.  Thanks for the recipe.

I don't know how some people got a creamy textured fudge out of this.  I have been cooking and baking since I was 12 years old and this recipe stinks!  I am now 68 years old.  I did everything right of that I am sure.  It is toooo sugary, too grainy and also it got hard as a rock in a matter of hours.  Don't even try this one, it's a waste of all the ingredients!

This was a horrible recipe! I tried it twice and both times immediately after adding the peanut butter the fudge hardened up and became rock solid and crystalized. I was sad to have wasted all my ingredients on this recipe

I feel bad for the people who tried this recipe and got bad results because it's great!  It sounds like the "soft ball stage" is the tricky part.  I had no clue what the soft ball stage, so I just cooked & stirred until my husband and I thought it looked good.  It was really quick--about five minutes to get to the soft ball stage.  Mine's a tad grainy, so maybe I didn't go long enough.  But if your not sure on the soft ball thing, just go about 5 minutes and it will turn out great!

The recipe, as it's written, is a great basic fudge recipe. I was looking for an "old fashioned" recipe, without marshmallows or sweetened condensed milk & this was THE one! I did try substituting powdered sugar a couple of times like some other reviewers suggested... but each time, the fudge didn't set properly. But when I tried the granulated sugar (as recipe suggests), it turned out beautifully. Smooth... not grainy & set up really well. I didn't place the granulated sugar batches in the fridge though until AFTER it had set. Not sure if that made the difference or not. 
For my best batch of fudge, I reduced the sugar to 2 3/4 c. & increased the peanut butter to 1 cup. I used reduced fat Jif & it made no difference at all... also used dark cocoa instead of regular and it was not only delicious, but the dark color made it look even more scrumptious! Thanks for a great fudge recipe... I will definitely be making this one again!

I make this all the time and it turns out perfect every single time.  Bring it to a full boil while stirring.  Reduce the heat to low/medium so that it's still bubbling a little bit.   Let it bubble for 8 minutes.  When after the 8 minutes, drip a tiny bit into some cold water, if it floats to the bottom and turns in a little ball, it's ready.  That's it.   The soft ball stage seems strange but it works.  Then add the peanut butter and butter and stir it until you can see the scraps on the bottom of the pan, it means it's starting to get thick, pour it in the pan before it gets too thick.

Tastes great, but I must have cooked it too long, it got too hard and I was unable to cut it-it just broke apart.  Any suggestions?

For the people having trouble getting their fudge to set...Make sure it isn't raining when you make it!!  I assume it's a humidity thing but my sister-in-law swears "you can't make fudge in the rain".....I love hillbillies, they know all the tricks!!

Sorry, I didn't care for this at all. It was very grainy and a lot harder than most fudges.  I prefer the creamy type.  The directions were good, and only needed a few ingredients but it's not a fudge I would give at Christmas.

This turned out perfect for me. The reviewer below had the right idea, it has to boil for about 8 minutes to get to the soft ball stage. After boiling on medium for six minutes, I tested the dough in water about every minutes onward. So so so yummy!

I have made this recipe twice now, and the 2nd time added just a little more Peanut butter... we're fanatics here....  I was reading the reviews and people mentioning the grainy results.... I have found through making other fudges and candies, the graininess comes from stirring the sugar mixture too much during the cooking process and also having the heat up too high. When it cools, more sugar crystals form instead of keeping the mixture form. Cook to a soft ball on a low heat, not anything above that. Be patient when cooling... do not try and cool too quickly, and just leave it sit do not mix... As for the powdered sugar? well, was ok, but prefer the granulated more and so does my family....

This is great, BUT you must use condensed milk NOT evaporated milk (=evap. milk makes it runny, whereas cond. milk makes it soft like fudge we're all used to)....

I added a photo today of this recipe; the texture is right and the flavor is right... but it's just not as glossy as I expected it to be. I think that next time, I'll increase the peanut butter and see if the extra oils help.

This was easy and great if you love peanut butter. Once it comes to a boil don't stir it too much and it will come out creamy. If you stir it too much after it has come to a boil you will get the grainy sugar texture.

There are a lot of great things about this recipe. It's very easy -- if you use a candy thermometer and cook it to 235 degrees. It's also inexpensive (compare this to other fudge recipes that call for chocolate chips and marshmallows). The chocolate peanut butter flavor is a sure crowd-pleaser. If the "rolling boil" part confuses you, you can just ignore it and cook on medium until you reach 235 degrees. On the minus side, it's not quite as peanut buttery, creamy, or smooth as fudge can possibly be. But it's a solid basic recipe.

What exactly is a "soft ball" stage?

I guess I figured it out well enough for a first time fudge maker.  It turned out delicious and creamy, and it was so easy to make too!  Perfect to satisfy that chocolate craving!  My husband who is not a big chocolate fan even liked it!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, will definitely make again.

I tried this recipe twice with horrible results.  While cooking, I waited and waited and it never came to a softball stage.  By that time it was cooked too long.  A total waste of time and waste of food!  It almost ruined one of my pans.  For those who got it to a soft ball stage, I can see why it would be dry; it has to cook too long.  I also believe you would need to add marshmallow for it to a creamier texture.  Try a different recipe!

I made this last night, it was my first time ever making fudge. It was AWESOME!!! So smooth and yummy! I let it bubble for about 8 minutes, put a couple drops in the water like some of the other reviews indicated to do. It was perfect. It set up in about 15 minutes and its been really hard not to just eat it all!!! I will totally be making this again!!

I was looking for a smaller chocolate peanut butter fudge recipe. This one fit the bill and is tasty too.     My normal recipe calls for a five lb. bag of sugar so starting with three cups was a different experience for me.     I used this a jumping off point and used a whole can of evaporated milk (about 1 and 1/3 cups)instead of the 1 cup called for and used 1/3 cups cocoa instead of the 1/4. I would probably use even more cocoa powder next time just because I like my fudge to be very chocolaty. Using more cream probably increases the cooking time too.    It was a nice recipe to begin with. Thanks for posting this! I was not quite sure where to begin when using smaller amounts of ingredients. Thanks!

Im sitting here eating a big piece of the fudge I just made and I LOVE IT!!!I have been searching for a recipe for pb fudge like my mom used to make (using white suger NOT marshmellows!) and I FOUND it!! I did not add cocoa. I added a lot more pb than the recipe called for. Also I added vanilla...not sure whether it made a difference...it's just what momma used to do. This isn't really creamy fudge like you buy in the mountains....but I like this kind better! You have to try it once....and don't forget...double the amount of peanut butter!

I can never get the soft ball stage right and I can't fin a candy therm. for the life of me!  But, I read alot of the reviews and followed the tips that I had read and lo' and behold- THE PERFECT FUDGE resulted~! I think next time I would add a bit more peanut butter and maybe swirl some in on the top while it's still hot for appearance! Will be a family fave, I'm sure!

This is an excellent quick fix recipe. I used 2 cups of powdered sugar instead of 3 as suggested. I write in from India, where we evaporated milk is not freely available. Can regular milk be substituted for it?

This was my first attempt at making fudge.  I followed the recipe to the best of my ability, but had trouble deciphering the "rolling" and "soft" ball stage.  I believe it would have helped if the recipe creator added approximate cooking times.  I cooked this fudge for at least 25 minutes, but never hit the "rolling ball" stage.  After I poured the batter into the pan, it never hardened.  It was likely that it was undercooked.  Directions for this recipe are vague.

I tried this recipe after several failed attempts at other peanut butter chocolate fudge recipies. This is by far the BEST recipe I have made.  I made it exactly how it is written and I doubled the recipe.....between 4 kids and my husband it only lasted about 12 hours in our house LOL.  The key is making sure you get it up to temp.  it makes sure the sugar granules are all disolved and it's a nice smooth fudge.  I highly recommend it (and do so on pinterest lol)

This reminded me of the fudge my mother made when I was young. It got great reviews for the critics that matter most and that's what counts. It's 12/21/12 and if the world ends today, I've got a smile on my face and great fudge in my belly. Thank you

After reading the reviews I was afraid of a mess, but it came out pretty excellent. Reading the reviews taught me what the soft ball stage was, and also I took the suggestion to add vanilla flavouring. Make sure to refridgerate to make more solidified. So yummy.

I did everything as the recipe says and while it taste fine, it is hard a a rock and not at all like fudge! Next time I think I will either try as some others have said and use powdered sugar or just get a new recipe all together :(

I tried this recipe, and it didn't turn out like I thought it should.  It almost seemed like if I'd pt oatmeal in it, that it would've made No Bake cookies.  It was too grainy and gooey.

I try every year to make fudge and fail every time. I actually got this one right. I read all the reviews and it helped a lot. I did use white sugar...just didnt constantly stir. I also added some vanilla...Really very good and not grainy at all.

I just got finished making this and it turned out FANTASTIC!!! I used the hershey special dark chocolate powder and just a tad bit extra peanut butter and a teaspoon of vanilla. Within minutes of pouring it into the pan, it already began setting up. I have tried several other recipes and this by far is the best. Thank you!

I've made fudge many times and decided to try a new recipe.  This didn't even come close to my expectations or standards!  I know what a "ball stage" is, and this certainly never occurred.  The description is very poorly written, my mistake for even trying it.

This is good fudge. Although it took me 3 times to perfect it. And I tried it with confectioner's sugar and white sugar. I decided that the white sugar worked better. Made a great Halloween Treat! Just be sure to boil it on the high temperature long enough (almost like its about to boil over), otherwise you wind up with frosting like fugde instead.

Great fudge and easy to make. It's a little sweet and could use a little more peanut butter in my opinion. I've never made fudge before, and this recipe was great for a beginner!!! I will definately use this again.

Good recipe....but I emprovised.  The first time, I must have cooked it too long until it got to "hard-ball stage" because like the one of the reviews said, it just broke apart.  

The second time, I used a glass of ice water and tested the mixture every minute.  It seemed to take about 12 to 13 minutes after the rolling boil to get to the "soft-ball stage".

I did emprovise with regular milk instead of evaporated milk and added my own vanilla to the mixture (I love vanilla).  I also used a baking squared instead of coco powder but I shredded it which took a little longer and added more than the recipe called for.   I never follow directions completely I usually just use them as a guide...but it seemed to turn out well anyways.

Easy to make, and tastes delicious! I researched the 'soft-ball stage' and found that it is when the mixture reaches between 235 and 240 degrees F. I bought a candy thermometer and my fudge turned out terrific!!!!

Hmmmm....No disrespect to the chef....but this didn't taste much like fudge to me.  Too much sugar maybe?  It pulled like taffy.  Something about it didn't agree with me!  Could be my fault....  :(

I'm making it this very minute and followed almost all of everyone's advise. I used 1 cup of peanut butter because we're peanut butter freaks and I added 1-2 more Tbsps. of cocoa because I love chocolate. So far it's been boiling 11 minutes and still hasn't reached the soft-ball stage(when I drop it in cold water). Maybe it's because of the high altitude where I live. I noticed everything takes longer to cook here....
It's now at 12 minutes cooking and still no soft ball :(
13 minutes now...NADA!
Well boys and girls, I've been cooking this for 15 minutes now and I'm beginning to think I've just wasted a lot of good ingredients.
Now on my 16th minute and....
wait!...can it be????
OK, after 18 minutes, it's finally somewhat holding its shape! Not a soft ball but it's like fudge sauce consistency. Can it be possible that the altitude can make that much of a difference in the cooking time?
So, now it's been 20 minutes and I'm afraid to overcook it so I'm going to call it good and go ahead with the rest of the instructions and add the peanut butter and stuff. 
After beating in the remaining ingredients, it's very smooth and creamy...and it tastes out of this world! But time will tell if it solidifies enough to cut in squares and hold it's shape. If not, well...we'll just eat it with a spoon because it's just that tasty, smooth and creamy! As long as it's not hard and grainy,I'm good with it. I can only give it 3 stars until I know if it will solidify. I'll report back later today.

I made the recipe according to the directions except I added more PB and lined my 8x8 pan with wax paper. I used a candy thermometer and it turned out excellent. My husband love Reese's PB cups and he was very impressed by this fudge. It's better than the stuff I used to buy in the candy shop. Thanx for sharing!

After adding the peanut butter we found that the "fudge" was extremely dry. To fix that issue we just added a bit of the evaporated milk until it became stirrable and sort of pourable. We then kneaded the "fudge" on wax paper until it was a good consistency and poured into pan to cool.

All I can say is beat, beat and beat some more and you will have an awesome fudge! When I made it it was okay but grainy so I thought about chopping it up reheating it and trying again, what did I have to lose? I did not cook it quite as long (and I had to add a little milk to get it more liquid) as before so it did not start to firm up right away. As soon as I pulled it off the burner I began to beat it with an electric mixer until it became stiffer then I beat it by hand for 2-3 minutes and let it finish firming up in a glass pan...it was creamy and tasted great!

This is so tasty, but I can't get it to set up correctly. Can anyone tell me why it never hardens. I did make a change, I substituted non fat condensed milk for regular and used powdered sugar as someone suggested. I did use a candy thermometer so I got the temp right. Am I stirring too much? I thought I had to stir continuously. I'd love to get this one right. Any help would be appreciated.

Tastes like peanut butter cup basically - the "cooking to a soft ball stage" was beyond me - but my mom helped me figure that out. The fudge is okay - I'm not a huge fudge fan but BF is allergic to eggs. He's eating a lot of it though - so I think it was a success!

delicious recipe!  I followed it exactly and it came out great.  I followed another person's review and cooked it for 7-8 minutes on medium heat (timed after the rolling boil) and mine solidified great.

This was great!  I followed BoobyBabyMommy's advice and let the mixture start to boil over then I turned down the heat and used my trusty candy thermometer until it reached the soft ball stage.  I also made sure I didn't over stir it! I added a little bit more peanut butter (cuz I LOVE chocolate and PB) and everything turned out creamy and delicious!

I have used a very similar recipe for many years (I add vanilla at the end with the peanut butter).  I  doubled this recipe to make a 13X9 pan of it.  Doubled, it was perfect.  I just added vanilla at the end (and, really, it didn't need it, was more from habit than anything else!)  I have to say, that this double batch was the best batch of fudge I can remember ever making!!!   Thank you so much for your recipe!  I hope you don't mind, it's going to be the one I use from now on!

I don't like a super-smooth fudge.  This was not, although I'm sure it had more to do with my cooking than the recipe iteself.  I would suggest doubling the peanut butter if you want a nice PB flavor in the fudge.  The amount called for is not enough.  A good recipe though, thanks!

After spending a morning at Bass Pro Shop smelling their delicious fudge cooking in the cafe, I returned home ready to make my own (rather than pay $12.99 for a pound!).  I took the advice of some commenters and replaced the granulated sugar with powdered sugar.  I set the timer for 6 minutes once I turned the heat down to medium and I have to say this is the absolute easiest and best fudge recipe out there.  It is perfect and fool proof!

I've been looking for a chocolate peanut butter fudge recipe for awhile.  This tastes just like my mom's recipe; she got it from the Hershey's box years ago (I do mean years, like 50).  I did add extra peanut butter 1/4 cup, but still not peanut buttery enough. Next time I'll probably put in more. This is so creamy and smooth. I just love it. My hubby said it's the best fudge I've ever made. Didn't have to use a chizel on it (LOL) and didn't have to eat it with a spoon. Thanks Jean for a great recipe. The last time I made fudge was almost 15 years ago. I'll be making this again soon.

I didn't like how you can feel the granulated sugar. I suggest using powdered sugar. & it needs much more chocolate. AANNDDD I suggest chunky peanut butter.

I also used the powdered sugar instead of white sugar and it looked and tasted very good, it just didnt harden as much as I thought it would!

Very good. This was my first time making fudge. I used an 8 x 8 pan. The only change I made was I added 1 tsp. of vanilla. I used a candy thermometer. It took 10 minutes for fudge to reach 250 degrees. Make sure you work quickly when poring fudge into pan.

Super simple! super good, i love it! and hubby loves it too! 
i used half powdered and half granulated, worked out well.
Boiled about 5 minutes and tested for soft ball stage, had to let it boil another minute, minute and a half. good and fudgey! :P

Twice in a row perfection!  The soft ball stage is when a small dab is dropped into a glass of cold water and it stays together as a ball.  The trick is to follow the recipe, not modify it.  If it is too grainy, it is not the type of sugar, you arent cooking it all the way too the soft ball stage.  This is a great recipe, simple to follow and easy to adapt, without PB or with nuts.

This was awesome!  It was my first time making fudge, and it turned out great.  I did add more peanut butter and cocoa, but I had no problems with graininess - I made sure to reach the soft ball stage and not stir too much, and it turned out great!

Not a terrible recipe. I didn't want to make a huge amount so I cut the recipe in half, and it's always turned out. I'd give it five stars but I have decided to unrealistically give five stars only to recipes that can self correct the mistakes I make when I make them. I'm doing something wrong and I suspect it's stirring too much. But that darn wooden spoon is just so hard to put down!

I was scared to make this but I have a LOT of evaporated milk that I won't use and a bunch of sugar that wouldn't fit into the container.  Thank you Proofhead for saying not to monkey with it...it worked!  My husband all but licked the pan clean and I've got to make at least 2 more batches!

This is the first time I have ever attempted fudge.  My husband wanted some so I decided to use this recipe.  It turned out very good.  I used confectioners sugar like one reviewer suggested.  It tasted more like peanut butter than chocolate to me (which I like better)but if your looking for choclately fudge, I wouldn't suggest this one.

Mmmmmm.  So good.  My 2 year old bawled when I told him no more.  It does taste like a no bake cookies minus the oatmeal, but no bake cookies are my favorite.  I doubled the chocolate and used 1% milk because I was all out of canned.  I'm sure it would be even better with canned milk.

I tried making this fudge and it actually never solidified...even when I had it in the freezer.  I think I didn't boil it for long enough.  Also, I agree that confectioners sugar would be better suited.  Although it tasted good, the texture was off.

Ok...maybe it was me...I never made homemade fudge before, but I consider myself a very experienced baker, and rarely have I ever had anything I've ever made come out this bad.  I read all the reviews and made sure to follow the recipe to the letter.  What I got, was a very dry and dull looking fudge. It tasted ok if you could get past how it looked and the intial dryness...but I guess I won't be making fudge again for a while.  This really discouraged me.  Sorry.

perfect recipe, this wont get grainy if you don't stir and/or cook it to death, on my stovetop it took 8 minutes on medium, take it off add peanut butter and stir and pour, that's it.  I did add a teaspoon of vanilla and a pinch of salt, an instant read thermometer should read 234 to 235 degrees and you're good to go.

This is a variation of the recipe handed down from my grandmother, who made this and sent it to my grandfather in WWII. To keep it from crystallizing, butter the sides of your heavy sauce pan before you begin and do not stir it much. Mama always said the best fudge is the untended fudge! Try adding a teaspoon of instant espresso powder when you begin. And don't forget the nuts. Chop them and gently heat them in a skillet as the fudge cooks. When the fudge is done and you are beating in the butter and peanut butter, add those warmed nuts and quickly pour it into the prepared pan. Score while warm for cleaner cuts. And although I g

So this was my first attempt. I was nervous after reading all the reviews.  I went with the suggestion to reduce to 2 3/4 sugar (still too sweet) and 1 c. peanut butter and dark cocoa (not enough chocolate flavor so will add more next time) with vanilla at the end.  Although it's creamy and not grainy, it's not setting up as firm as it should be.  But very tasty and creamy.    I think  out of fear of overcooking, I undercooked.  I used the advice to not stir too much.  I did the softball trick in the water but guess I guessed wrong.  I used the idea to put the saucepan in a larger bowl of cold water to prevent the crystals from growing and creating a grainy texture.  I think that helped cause it's super creamy, not grainy at all.   It's like a super thick creamy hot fudge sauce that would be delicious on vanilla icecream.  Too bad I don't have any to try it out!  I will try again later with more tweaks.    UPDATE:  The longer it's in the fridge the better but it's been about 1.5 hrs and very soft.

There is NOTHING wrong with this recipe. It amazes me that people can look at photos of a recipe that turned out perfect  for someone else and then say something is wrong with the recipe. No..It's you..not the recipe. Candy making is almost like a science. If you don't know the basics you will get a mess. All of you "experienced" bakers out there..I don't believe it for a second. Geez. Baking is not candy making either. Rant over!

The first time I made it I forgot to beat it smooth. Still turned out great. This time I used sweetened condensed milk, with a tad vanilla at the end, forgot to beat it again!  Turned out wonderful.

I made this for desert. I tasted the batter before I put it in the frig to cool. It was very sweet. So I modified it and it still was way too sweet for my taste. I used 1  1/2 cups peanut butter, 3/4 cup cocoa and about 1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. I will make this recipe again. But next time, I will cut the sugar by almost 1/2.

I tried making it, but when I went to lower the temperature, the whole thing overflowed and destroyed the pot I was using! I was able to salvage some of the mixture that was left... Wish I knew what went wrong!

I have never made fudge before but have wanted to for years. My great aunt made the best fudge ever and I have searched for so long to find something that at least came close. Although I don't think I could ever duplicate her fudge, this recipe was the one to try. I just made it and it was easy and is currently setting and I would say nicely. I did sneak a taste and YUMMY! 
Before trying this recipe I did read all the reviews which I found extremely helpful. I followed the recipe exactly with one exception of adding a little extra peanut butter. I used a candy thermometer as well as did the soft ball test with water(which I had never heard of). I also used a tip from reading the reviews, I lined my pan with lightly buttered wax paper.
Only downfall was cleaning the pot, but a price I am willing to pay to have this yummy treat. Looking forward to sharing with the family for Thanksgiving. 
Thanks for sharing Jean

Great basic fudge recipe, reminds me of what my mom usually makes.  I doubled the peanut butter and it was yummy, but a bit too sweet.  The next time I make it I will put less sugar in it, then it will be worth 5 stars for my family!

This turned out great! Mine turned out very smooth, but I did brush done the edges of the pot as it was cooking. It was a very quick process. I added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter based on other reviews, but I think I will try the original amount next time because you can barely taste the chocolate, even though I am a pb fan. I also added a tsp of vanilla, too. Overall, I thought it was great: easy, quick, smooth and creamy. P.S. Don't forget to sift your cocoa powder and sugar before cooking it!

This is pretty much the same stuff that I use to make with my mother. I had no problem getting it right the first time; although I do agree with others that the over all directions here are vague. I added in a splash of Vanilla when I added in the peanut butter. I do however recommend using only enough butter for your pan. Mine was a little smaller then the one suggested and I ended up with a layer of butter under my fudge that gave the bottom a weird consistency.

I love this recipe!  I used to 'help' my grandmother make fudge, and could never find a similar recipe. . . until now!  I don't care for the super creamy varieties, this is perfect. Very smooth and great flavor, I did double the peanut butter (personal preference)but otherwise, perfect.  Don't be afraid of soft ball stage, 6 or so minutes it's ready.  I started eating it warm, I couldn't wait! I poured it into pans lined with buttered wax paper. Thanks Jean!

I don't have a clue how this recipe wouldn't work for someone. I am a cook. Not a baker. I truly can't even make cookies right without a detailed and thorough step by step instructional so finding this recipe was a dream come true for me. No baking involved to make a sweet treat :)I followed the directions to the letter, also having no idea what a soft ball nonsense meant. Just boiled until it bubbled reduced heat immediately and cooked until it felt right. For me that just meant smooth and thick. Added peanut butter and butter (no margarine in my house) and it stirred in beautifully. It started setting quickly (which I expected) and was so lovely! The only thing I did different was line my setting pan with lightly greased wax paper. Simply because I don't like mess. GREAT RECIPE! Thank you!

This is delicious!!!! You need to cook it long enough, but not too long. I'm 17 and this is my 2nd time making it and it's delicious!!!! I also added extra peanut butter, but this time my peanut butter had nuts, so it gave it a crunch.

This is fabulous.  I used about 3/4 cup of peanut butter and added 1tsp of vanilla extract when I added the peanut butter and butter.  I followed the rest of the ingredients list exactly.  I've read other reviews that said this is grainy and they gave suggestions for how they "fixed" it.  Graininess can be avoided by simply cooking to the soft ball stage as stated in the recipe.  Soft ball stage is achieved at approximately 234 - 240 degrees farenheit.  DELICIOUS!  Thanks for sharing this one.

This was wierd.... we followed the directions carefully, measured right, water..... But after we put it in the pan- it never set! It has been 5 hours now, and it is the consistency on thick, creamy.... frosting! But we had some over ice cream..... DELICIOUS!!!! I did substitute powdered sugar, so next time, I will just use granulated. Has anyone else had this happen? Tips?

It was my first time making fudge and this recipe was VERY simple to follow.  I did do a little research about how long to stir while it's cooking and how long to beat it after it comes off the heat.  All in all, not a bad recipe.  Thanks!

A little addition I add to mine that I have done for years. No one complains. A little less sugar and more peanut butter. Also add a cup of marshmallows when you add peanut butter and favoring.

This fudge recipe is fantastic. I like peanut butter but am not a total nut fanatic so the amount of peanut butter suggested was perfect. I followed the recipe exactly, stirring almost constantly for about 7.5 minutes after reducing the heat after attaining a rolling boil. My fudge is delicious, smooth, not grainy in the least!  I used fat free evaporated milk and the results were lower fat and calorie than it's full fat counter part would have been. Ten points for a recipe that's easy, accurate, and tasty!

Wow, after reading how hard of a time people had making this, i was scared.  I followed the advise of using confectioners sugar, and finding that "soft ball" stage of 7-8 minutes, and it turned out perfectly. Didnt last long in our house!  It didnt have much of a peanut butter taste, but whatever, it was good, and it set up perfectly!

Great recipe! The only problem I encountered was a little overboiling incident - other than that, it came out perfectly creamy, smooth and delicious! Thanks for giving me something wonderful to make when I was running low on groceries. :-)

I made this fudge for a holiday gift for those with whom I work.  One of my colleges emailed me to say it was just like her grandmothers recipe.  Everyone said it was awesome!  I used fat free evaporated milk, reduced fat peanut-butter, and 50/50 margarine and butter to make it a bit less guilty.  I didn't stir at all once it hit the heat, thanks to those who said not to stir or the sugar will be grainy.  Maybe the word stir should be removed from the recipe? If one little word is the only critique, that's awesome!

Thanks!

You probably won't get it right the first time but once you get the hang of it it will come out great everytime. I have also used this as a topping for brownies and topped with walnuts.....yummmm

I only stirred the darn stuff 3 times and it was still a teeny tiny grainy.  Maybe my boiling wasn't "rolling" enough... I didn't want to overcook it.
This was my first time making fudge alone, and I do not have a CT.  My mom said the top would look "quilted" and when I had it on a rolling boil it did.  ONE TIP: use a big pan because this recipe really PUFFS up big when you first heat it.  
I also went a little crazy with the peanut butter and added like 1 1/4 cups.  As far as I can tell it only added to the creaminess.
It's cooling right now... hope i didn't overcook it!!!  
Fudgemaking is a fine art we all should learn to do. Maybe Santa will bring me a CT!!!!

I am guessing that the person who's fudge turned out grainy missed the soft ball stage or stirred too vigoursly after it did - which can cause graininess. Fudge is tricky! I always use a candy thermometer - it takes away a lot of the guesswork.

Thank you for putting this recipe up!!!  It is just like my mom's recipe and I lost her's and she passed 2 years ago.  2 batches turned out perfectly and the last was almost perfect!!  I think I learned how to get the soft ball stage test right.  I made sure the water I used was out of the fridge cold and I when I dropped the fudge in the cold water and mushed it around it formed a ball!!  First time ever!!  I have been trying to do this recipe for years and gave up!  Thanks to you I got another chance!

I have been looking all over for this recipe.  I had it years ago, but lost it in my move across country.  Yes, this is a harder fudge than many people are used to, but it is my favorite!  AWESOME!!

I made this recipe and we loved it. I did make a change or two, I used the 2% milk, and left out the baking cocoa    and added 1 cup of peanut butter and 1/2 cup chopped pecan. and I used a CT till it got to 250 and it was a good soft ball stage.and it was soft and creamy

I would have liked this to have more of a chocolate-peanut butter taste, and more creamy. I did add a bit more butter, and some vanilla. It did not have the "grainy" texture that some others experienced; probably because I cooked it for the right amount of time (about 8 min.).

I followed the advice of the icing sugar and the recipe turned out OK. I have a candy thermometer and know how to do the soft ball stage with the glass of cold water. The fudge turned out a little softer than I like, but overall OK.

I was limited to the microwave for boiling the syrup, and was worried that it wouldn't set because I hadn't reached the soft ball stage.  After microwaving and stirring for short bursts so that it wouldn't burn, I decided to add half a bag of chocolate chips to the mixture.  It set up almost immediately, and my flatmates were so impressed with how chocolatey and rich it was.  I also used powdered sugar instead of white; I think only about 2.5 cups in addition to the chocolate I added.  Thanks for a great base recipe!

I used confectioners sugar as suggested by some others but the fudge was still a little grainy, and it was still kind of soft.  I will try this one again, but will buy a candy thermometer first.  Also, I'll line the pan because although I buttered it well I still had to scoop it out with a spoon.

This recipe was a hit with all my friends.However i feel that it was too dry. It didn't have that creamy fudge taste at all. It was very dry. I don't think i'll make it again
