We used KNORR brand sauerbraten pot roast recipe mix which I buy at a local grocery store but have also purchased online.  We think it has a better taste than the McCormick brand. The mix calls for 2 1/2 cups of water +1 tablespoon firmly packed dark brown sugar (optional). I also added whole mushrooms.

I made it for the first time and it came out really good. The flavors are really good given it all comes from that one seasoning packet. The whole family loved it. Really easy to make as well.

Easy to make, which is a plus. But as presented, there's not enough seasoning or flavor. The vegetables were bland and the meat needed extra sauce added after it was done. I'd make it again, but add at least salt, pepper, and a bay leaf. Probably other spices too.

I got this recipe & decided to try it. Once the soup was done, we tasted it, and the broth tasted like water!!!
