I love this recipe. Anyway, I always roll out the dough between two sheets of wax paper, then loosen the paper on both sides before cutting the cookies out.  This way, you can cut out cookies immediately without waiting for dough to get cold.  We use this for our gingerbread houses, too.  It's a very sturdy gingerbread.

I'm really surprised on the reviews on this one! I've never made Gingerbread but the kids wanted too. I just took out of the oven a few minutes ago decorated one, ate it and they are awesome!!! I followed the recipe except I used butter flavored crisco for the shortning (its what I had) and added a pinch of nutmeg and cloves plus a little more cinnamon. Rolled between wax paper and the rolled great, cut great and came right off the pam sprayed cookie sheet just perfect!  They are not real spicey which I like better and when the kids wake up from a nap they are going to decorate!  I think these are a must try!!!!

Never having made gingerbread before, I figured that I'd try one out.  As another reviewer pointed out, the hardest part was waiting until the dough chilled.  I had also doubled the recipe, but was surprised at all the negative reviews.  I did add slightly more ginger than the recipe suggested (1/8 tsp), but the taste was fantastic.

Excellent recipe.  Using my "KitchenAid" made this a breeze.  I blended the shortening and brown sugar for a full five minutes, till almost fluffy, and gradually added the molasses and water. Using a sifter, mix all the flour, baking soda, and spices in another bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, one cup at a time. The "KitchenAid" does all the work. Everything was measured exactly as the recipe called for. Thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe.

Funny how what works for some doesn't work for others.  The dough turned out too soft.  After the cookies baked I attempted to remove them with a spatula to cool, but they squashed together and I ended up with "Gingerbread Sumo Wrestlers!"  The flavor didn't really ring any bells either.  Onward to the next recipes!

I love this recipe! My 7yo and I have a strange tradition of making these when school ends in May and decorating them with jellybeans or M&Ms. We have done this for several years and used this recipe. Thanks for the post and the memories! I also made them for Christmas and hung them on the Christmas tree as ornaments but our Boston terrier likes them, too, and he would pull them off the tree and eat them.

These cookies are just sweet enough and have nice texture. I cut the molasses with honey for my little one. I like spice and would have doubled the ginger for myself. The consistency of the dough is what I would expect for a rolled cookie but I did use a smaller cutter than recommended to get more mileage.

Dough was a little dry to work with after chilled.  Kneading it in the hands warms and softens it, though it's still a bit crumbly when rolled out.  Tastes great, makes nice soft cookies.

This is the first time I have made gingerbread cookies, and this recipe was not only easy to follow, but the cookies looked and tasted great!  I love the mild flavor - most gingerbread I have tried in the past has been too spicy.  I will definitely be making these again.

This was really easy to make, but as I used butter rather than shortening, and as the dough seemed to be a bit dry and crumbly, I added an egg yoke to be safe.  They turned out lovely :)  Though I think I'll add a little extra spice next time, but I think that's just my personal taste.

I doubled the recipe to give me a nice army of gingerbread men. I ended up cutting the molasses with about 1/4 cup of honey because when I smelled the molasses, I became horrified and worried I wouldn't like the cookie flavor. I added all other ingredients as written.
The dough is wonderfully easy to work with, unlike Eileens Spicy Gingerbread men.
I baked them for about 9 min and they came out crispy on the edges, tender in the middle. The flavor is mild, and not too spicy.
Overall, I think this is a good recipe. I like my gingerbread men a tad more "cake like" so I will keep with Eileen's Spicy Gingerbread Men recipe nest time.

I made these with butter instead of shortening, and at high altitude, and they turned out great! I didn't roll them, just made balls and then flattened them with my palms. I thought that 12 minutes might have been too long since I really wanted them to stay soft, so I experimented and found that 11 min was perfect in my oven. Anything less and they didn't fluff up. I did add a LOT more spice and ginger; they are very mild without it and seemed slightly bland. I also dusted mine with powdered sugar after they cooled. They stayed soft and the dough kept well in the fridge for 2 days when I got busy.

This recipe turned out amazing!  The cookies were soft and delicious.  I was very concerned when I made this - the dough was SOOOOO soft, but rolling it out on floured parchment did the trick.  We like our gingerbread a little spicy so I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp allspice, 1/2 tsp cloves, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I also cooked them for only 9 minutes.  The first batch was done for 11 and my oven may run a little hot, so 9 worked well.

Since this was my first attempt at making Gingerbread Men, I found this recipe extremely easy to make AND roll out. The dough was glossy and smooth, on a lightly floured surface rolled out perfectly! Lifted up with no effort, and I agree with the recommendation to use a wide spatula. Flavor was good, not too overpowering. Just right mixture of ginger and molasses. Decorated with Royal Icing recipe from this site, and it was tons of fun for my 7yr old! She was amazed at how good they came out! Thanks!

This was my 1st time making gingerbread men and these turned out fabulous! I didnt change a thing, but I did freeze the cookies overnite and took them out and thawed them, this made them stay chewy instead of drying out! A++ recipe:)

This turned out perfect for a gingerbread house. I did add 1/2 tsp of allspice. There was no problem using the dough right away. I just made sure to roll it between sheets of wax paper. This recipe made just enough for the walls and roof pieces for our cookie house, and a couple little men to put out front.

I followed the recipe but used unsalted butter instead of shortening. I have made this recipe three times and each time, it has come out perfectly. Rolling the dough between parchment paper really does make it easy to roll and the dough doesn't stick. I also bake the cookies right on the parchment paper that I rolled the cookies out on. The flavor of the cookies is not very strong compared to other gingerbread cookies. They taste like a gingersnap from the store. The cookies can be hard or soft depending on the thickness that you roll them. The thinner the dough, the faster they cook and the crisper they become. I had my kindergarten class bake these in school. They were able to make the dough and roll them out. They decorated them using mini chocolate chips for the eyes and buttons and sunflower seeds for the mouth. The chips and seeds were put onto the cookies before they were baked. I was also able to write the students' names on the parchment paper before baking so the correct cookies went to each child. We made them after reading several different versions of the Gingerbread Man, The Runaway Latke and the Runaway Tortilla. It was a great way to celebrate the season.

First time ever making gingerbread men and I think they turned out awesome! I used Tenderflake (lard) for the shortening and I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the recipe. I chilled the mixture in the fridge for 1-1/2 hours before rolling it out. Have to be pretty careful rolling it because it is very sticky and careful picking them up to place on cookie sheet because they break easy but once baked, they harden up.  YUMMY!

I made this recipe as it is written and it is fantastic. This was my first attempt at making gingerbread men in all of my 58 years. Very easy. I did not let the dough chill for an hour, however. I immediately rolled the dough between waxed paper as one reviewer suggested...and yes that worked very well. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

These were great except I added more spices to the mix since I like a very spicy cookie.  I used a small gingerbread cutter and when they were cool, I spread lemon curd on one and topped with another to make a sandwich cookie.  The combo of lemon and ginger was a huge hit!

Easy and delicious! I made the dough for my kindergarteners to cut-out, bake, and decorate. I was afraid that they might not hold up after all that, but they were great! One mom even asked for the recipe the next day after having a nibble of her child's cookie. I will use this recipe every year.

This is the first time I made gingerbread cookies.  I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly.  Cooked 11 minutes at 350, and the cookies have a great texture and are nice and chewy.  Good gingerbread flavor.  Took one advice and rolled the dough out between parchment paper, made dough easy to work with.

These were very easy to prepare, not too sweet and have a beautiful brown color.  I didn't decorate mine with icing, but it probably would have added the perfect touch.  I will make them again, but I will consider adding more spices.

I followed the recipe to the T, except added 1/2 tsp more ginger and also cinnamon. It turned out too dry and flaky and wouldn't bind so I had to add more water - I'd say I added another 1/3 of a cup. Because the dough was so stiff I didn't chill it - it rolled well but it was difficult to get very thin. I used 4" cutters and the recipe made 16 cookies - not sure why the recipe says 5 servings? So the Nutrition Info is incorrect. 

I only baked them for 9 minutes and 12 would have been WAY too long for sure! Thank goodness I am an obsessive watcher of my baking! They were quite cakey, but I like that, however even with extra spice they still weren't very gingery. Would be good for people who like it very mild! Was great to decorate and it is more delicious the day after for sure! It's not super sweet, so that's what sold me on this recipe in the end!

These cookies turned out pretty good, though just a little dry and not as spicy as my usual gingerbread recipe.

At first I didn't care too much for these.  But the longer they sat, the better they became!  They became softer, and much move flavorful.  Went from a 3* to a 5* in about 3 days!!

The dough was very easy to work with and we enjoyed cutting them out.  
However, our family did not care for the taste of these cookies AT ALL!  They 
tasted like gingerbread that we tasted at a working colonial farm one time.  
I think this is because the major sweetener is molassas.  We ended up feeding
them to the chickens.  Sorry!

hmmm...not so sure what to say about these.  i can't tell for sure if it's the recipe, or if we are just not gingerbread likers in thishouse.  as another reviewer suggested, i cut some of the molasses with honey when i realized mid-pour that i wasn't going to have enough to fill the measuring cup, so perhaps that contributed to it, but these weren't so stellar.  they were fun to decorate and easy to roll out, but if i'm honest at least half of the batch went into the trash about 2 weeks later  :(

Followed directions as written except I used butter instead of shortening and doubled the spices and added some nutmeg and cloves.  I took the advice of many on here and rolled it between parchment paper, but still had trouble keeping the cut out shapes intact.  My husband happened to walk by and suggested that i roll the dough in batches, keeping the rest in the fridge, and then take the rolled piece and put back in the fridge for a few minutes.  It worked like a charm! I was able to cut and place on a "pam" sprayed cookie sheet without any trouble at all.  The cookies are the perfect texture and yummy, though I taste more molasses than spice, even though I increased the spices. Next time I will increase the spices more, but otherwise, it's a keeper!

My son made them.  We had to add more water, but it was probably the way he measured the flour.  We didn't have molasses, so we used dark corn syrup.  They taste great.  I don't like a strong molasses flavor, so I'd probably go 1/2 c molasses and 1/4 c dark corn syrup if we make them again.

This was the best gingerbread cookie I have ever had.  You can really taste the molasses which I LOVE LOVE LOVE and they are soft.  I mostly used a circle and gingerbread men for my shapes and they held up really well (not so soft they fell apart).  I made enough last year for 20 servings and shared with my friends and family and they all loved the recipe.  The only change I made was I used two sticks of margarine instead of the shortening because I didn't have any.  Thank you so much Annamaria for my favorite cookie recipe.

Did not work for me at all.  Dough did not have enough moisture to form into a ball after mixing.  I stopped adding flour after 3 cups cause the dough was starting to become to tough for my KitchenAid mixer.  Even after chilling dough it was not able to be rolled, just crumbly. Dough taste was not what I was looking for either.

These cookies did not work out for me. I tried them twice. The first time I added spice and followed the rest of the recipe exact and the dough came out crumbly so I added a bit more flour and shortening. Big mistake. Since this was my first time trying gingerbread I wasn't sure how the dough was supposed to look. It tasted good as dough but when the cookies came out they were very thick and biscuit tasting. Soft though and tasted better the next day, but not like the traditional gingerbread men I wanted. Today, I tried again, I doubled the recipe, added additional spice once again (pinch of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg) and the dough came out much darker and creamier, like a normal cookie dough. It took about 2 hours to chill and I've just rolled out the first batch and they are practically flavorless. I couldn't tell when they were done because the bellies didn't "pop back" like the recipe says they will and overcooked the first tray, so they were a little burnt and nasty. I've wasted a lot of ingredients on this recipe and will not be using it again. Hopefully the cookies will taste better tmrw.

Since I only had 3 inch cookie cutters, I cut baking time down to 7 minutes. I found that any longer and the cookies became hard.  I was able to make about 32 cookies from this recipe.  I'm giving it a 4 because I didn't care for the taste.  I glazed the cookies to make them sweeter.

I only changed shortening to Becel margerine. The rest as is and this recipe is simply fantastic.  The cookie is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  If anyone had issues, they must have done something wrong.  Thanks Annamaria!

Dark, spicey, but still retain their sweetness. The proper thickness keeps them soft, baked for 6 minutes then let cool for 5 before transferring to wire racks. Delicious!

Having never made or even eaten a gingerbread cookie ever these were fantastic.  My kids really wanted to bake some for Christmas cookies and I thought that they would be tricky.  But they turned out wonderful & were very soft, but not so soft that they fell apart on you.  Follow the directions & you can't go wrong.  The ONLY thing I did differently was I had to add just 1-2 tbs. more of water,  These will definitely be a Christmas tradition at our house.

I love this recipe, but I have to give it four stars rather than five for the following reasons.
The baking time was entirely to long, perhaps because of altitude differances? I found 12 minutes made them burn, and cut back the bake time several times until they came out perfect, Finally settled at 7 1/2 minutes baking time for a perfectly browned and soft cookie!!

The dough was a bit bland, so I added 1 tsp. ginger 1 tsp allspice 1 tsp cloves and 1/2 tsp ginger.

The first batch I made and followed the recipe exact and was not pleased that 1/2 of my cookies were ruined due to finding an appropriate cooking time.

the second batch I made with my alterations. This recipe is a four but mine with alterations got rave reviews.

classic gingerbread recipe, goes perfect with this icing:  

1 tablespoon margarine 
3 tablespoons boiling water 
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 
1/8 teaspoon salt 
2 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar 

also, dont overcook these, you will be able to taste it and they do get hard when they dry and butter your pan as they stick

i would also recommend decoring heavily with icing and using margine such as sticks like Parkay. thay turnd out fine that way

Eh... I really had higher expectations for these cookies.  I usually enjoy milder gingerbread so judging by the reviews I thought I would like this.  Unfortunately these were too blah.  They turned out fine for decorating so we will have a lot of fun with these, but as far as giving them out to family, I don't think so.  The dough was so easy to work with, required no chilling, and I used another reviewer's recomendation to roll between two sheets of wax paper, perfect and now mess, so that is why it is getting 4 stars.  Taste - 3 stars.

This cookie was okay, but has too much molasses for me. I didn't refrigerate the dough because it was so hard to begin with, and it rolled out just fine. This is a good recipe for kids because the dough is so tough, and easy to cut with cookies cutters. If you bake the dough a little longer than suggested it makes great ornamental cookies for the tree.

Excellent! I think the key is to under-bake them to make them soft and chewy.  I made it just like the recipe called for and the only change was that I used 3 inch cookie cutters and baked for 5 minutes. I let the cookies cool on the cookie sheet. My son loved them!

Delicious gingerbread men!  Never thought I cared much for them, but after making this recipe, I have changed my tune.  My three year old son was slamming on them!  I had to hold back eating one while decorating them for gifts for people.  Really, just don't over-bake them, cool them properly, and they really are a good, and soft, cookie!

Everyone really liked these! They come out with a bit of crunch on the outside but soft and chewy inside. I am not a "gingerbread person" but I liked them too. Not too strong of a ginger flavor like some. It was just right! The dough was a bit soft and fragile for me but I consider myself an experienced baker so next time I will add a bit more flour.  Also a huge tip for people who say theirs is too stiff... you may be packing your measuring cup too full. You should scoop the flour into your measuring cup then level it off. It is much easier to add more flour than to take away! Also Sifting really is important, if you do not own one you can use a whisk in your flour container to loosen up and fluff your flour, just swipe the whisk around gently a few times. Hope this helps!

I was pretty unimpressed with this recipe. Most of the comments were good so I thought I would try it while my friend made a differnt one. Hers was 100% better. We feel their was A) not enough cinnamon B) too much molasses which gave it a very awful taste and C) there was no egg in it? please save yourself from disappointment and use a different recipe!

We took the suggestion of slightly increasing the ginger, and that made it exactly what we wanted. We took our gingerbread men to a party, where they immediately vanished.

Great recipe.  I was looking for a recipe that didn't come out of the oven hard; these are soft in the middle but not "cake like"; I did keep the cookies in a tupperware container which I think kept them from going hard.

My husband made the dough and said that it was very hard to mix.  We left it in the fridge to bake the next day, and it rolled out beautifully!  This is going to be an annual event, and we will be using the dough to make a gingerbread house!

I don't know what went wrong. The dough, chilled overnight was very dry and crumbly. I had to add water both when mixing and rolling.
The flavour and texture, once worked was very good. The only thing I could think of is that I may have erred when measuring. Anyways, my mini ginger men were tasty, not hard and spiced just right.
My dog stole some off the cupboard, so she liked them too.

I made these with margarine instead of shortening, but forgot that margarine does not firm up in the fridge very well.  Had to freeze the batter in order to be able to even roll it into balls (there was no way I was going to be able to roll it out - it would have needed at least 1/2 cup more flour than that).  However, my mistake actually made these SOOOOO SOFT! Delicious flavor (doubled the cinnamon only) without being too spicy.  YUMMY

Perfectly soft, flavorful and addictive. I had never made gingerbread before and this was easy. I took these to the office and they were gone within an hour!   I added 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves, allspice and some extra cinnamon for more flavor and took them out of the oven a little early to be sure they were soft. Make sure you spread them out- these expand quite a bit. I used the sugar cookie icing recipe and they were perfect!

These cookies were great! I was a little scared to make them, because I have never made gingerbread men before, but they tasted amazing, were not too ginger-y, and were a hit as christmas dessert. Don't be scared to try something new!

Mmm! I didn't have shortening so I used butter, no difference really. I didn't bother sifting everything else either since I lack a sifter. In other words, I'm quite the lazy chef. =D I also made them about 1/8th inch thick since I don't like really fat cookies, I like them crunchy and thin, so I left them in the oven for an additional 4-5 minutes or so. I like it better this way. =)

Good recipe. You can really taste the molasses in these. They aren't very "spicy," which I like. They are not overpoweringly sweet, either, so they taste even better with icing. Dough was quite sticky, even straight out of the fridge; I had to add flour before I was able to roll it.

This was my very first time making gingerbread but they came out absolutely fantastic.  I know I like my gingerbread a little spicier so I took the advice of others and added ginger, cinnamon, allspice, cloves and nutmeg on top of the spices in the recipe.  The dough was sticky.  I suggest only rolling out a small portion and keeping the rest refrigerated until ready to use.  If it gets too sticky, put it back in the fridge and pull some from the chilled portion.  I've tried different types of icing but I like Paula Deen's for decorating cookies.  3/4 cup powdered sugar and add 1 Tbl milk.  Mix.  If you need more milk, add by the dropful.  A little milk goes a long way.

These are pretty good.  I rolled the dough out on floured parchment as another user suggested and it was very easy to work with.  They aren't spicy enough for my taste and have a stronger molasses taste. They have a nice chewy texture that I like. A good cookie, but not quite what I was looking for.

I used the recipe for smaller (2 to 3 inch cookies), and they are perfect.   I ended up with about 50 cookies per batch.   The only problem is that they weren't gingery enough for my tastes.   I would suggest adding a pinch or 2 more ginger.   Also try the "Gingerbread Frosting for Cookies" for added kick.

These are certainly soft. So soft in fact, that when I wrapped them up and put them aside overnight and went to decorate them the next day, I discovered that they had broke up into gingerbread...body parts. Oh well, the taste was there, but the cookie itself was too sweet. Will not make again. Thanks anyway.

These cookies were a big hit with my friends, they were gobbled up really quick!  I was scared reading some of the reviews that they might not taste good so I added some extra ginger and some allspice.  They aren't as gingery as some gingerbread cookies but they are still really good (as long as your not in some gingerbread competition).  I ended up having a little less molasses than I needed (just under 3/4 cup, maybe 2 tablespoons short) so I didn't find it to have a strong molasses taste.  The only thing I'd complain about was that the dough was really dry and flaky and I ended up having to throw a lot of that stuff out but that could be because I used 1 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour and 2 cups all purpose instead of entirely all purpose flour.

My daughter and I had a ball making gingerbread shapes!  I only used 6 cups of flour and found that the dough did not need to be chilled before cutting.  I doubled the recipe (not necessary!) and froze half the dough for later. The cookies baked well but lack flavor.

Ended up with large, brown flat cookies. Tasted ok, but hated to see gingerbread men end their lives that way.
I’m a much better savory cook than a baker. I’ll do better next time.

I loved this recipe! made it a while back but forgot to save it. used the trick of rolling between two sheets of parchment paper worked great. I have a cookie cutter that indents the cookie and this dough held the shape extremely well! plus they're soft and taste great.

This was easy to make.  The consistency was good.  A little too crisp for my liking.  There was no flavor.  That was the problem.  Followed the recipe closely.  Will not make this again.  Moving on to a different recipe.

My only change was to use butter instead of shortening. The recipe was soft when underbaked but promptly turned very hard and crispy when fully baked. We did not particularly care for the flavor of this recipe. I had simultaneously made a hard gingerbread for our house project, and made these cookies to eat, but my children and sister who were visiting all strongly preferred the flavor of the other. Perhaps adding more spices or sweet would have helped, but we will experiment more another time. The texture and ease of recipe was good, flavor lackluster.

The flavour is terrible! All you can taste is the molasses. Too bland, not sweet at all.

I originally chose this recipe because it was vegan. I chilled the dough overnight and it was fine for rolling out, but when i went to transfer my gingerbread men to the baking sheet, the dough was so sticky, the men warped and became unrecognizable, even though everything was well floured.

I ended up giving up after 1 tray and just making circular ginger bread cookies.

A very tasty recipe, but not good for cookie cutters.

sorry yall, i have a catering business and have used ALOT of recipes. This one is BY FAR the worst recipe inhave ever used. I followed the instructions down to the letter. The molasses reigned as far as smell of the cookie goes, it literally made me nauseated at the smell. HOWEVER, i continued to prepare them in hopes that after chilling all would come together nicely. NOPE! The dough was like taffy, consistency was horrible, and wasting two hours of my valuable time will not hapoen again on this recipe. I highly recommend that you move onto the next recipe.

Great recipe! We're eating them fresh out of the oven. I barely managed to mix in 3 cups of flour. I'm thinking elevation had something to do with my issues, I live at about 4,400 feet. I added about 3 tablespoons of water to the final product and it wasn't crumbly anymore.

These are very good soft cookies. The dough was very easy to handle once chilled. They were mildly flavored. That is good for me because I make particularly spicy molasses cookies with butter regularly. These are different but just as good and easier to make. I added a tiny bit of allspice and mace to the dough. I will definitely make these again. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These turned out great! I added the egg yolk as suggested in a review, and I added a heaping tsp of the cinnamon, allspice,ginger and nutmeg. I baked them for 9 mins, and my family loves them!

I could tell that this was going to be a pretty easy dough to work with after it came together.  I did chill it for about an hour. It is a sturdy dough, and they hold up after they come off the cookie sheet. I like mine spicier so added accordingly.  The flavor is great, but 10 min. was enough in my oven. I suggest cutting these out thicker, as they are more of a gingersnap type texture if made too thin and at 12 min.  I will put a slice of bread in the container to soften some of them up some.  thanks for this nice recipe.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for! I followed the recipe exactly except that I added 1/4 teaspoon of cloves.  I did find that I had to work some extra flour in when rolling them out between two sheets of waxed paper.  I put  parchment paper on my cookie sheet and they were simple to remove with no problems of breakage, etc. I even refrigerated half of the dough overnight and still had to add the flour. The cookies are a mild flavored soft gingerbread.  They freeze well and taste just as good when they have been thawed out. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I just made these cookies. I baked them at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 12 minutes, per the recipes instructions, and when they came out the bottoms were all black! The second batch I only baked for 8 minutes and they turned out fine, but I'm kind of disappointed that I wasted my ingredients on burnt cookies.

Great recipe, tastes really great.  I like a little more bite from the ginger, so I added 1/2 tsp.  The dough was also a little crumbly, so I just added about 1/8 cup of shortening after chilling and it came out beautifully.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Very easy recipe!!!  My kids loved helping cut out and frost these cookies.  I didn't have all the molasses that the recipe called for so I substituted 1/4 karo syrup to make up for the difference.  Cookies still tasted great.  I am making this recipe again in the very near future.
Thanks!!!!

My two year old daughter and I made these today. The dough was so easy to work with and I loved that we could roll them out right away instead of having to let the dough chill. I agree with some of the other reviews that they may not be the best tasting cookies- but they are definitely kid friendly which for this project was more important :)
Thanks!

Pretty good and easy to make-- not very sweet, definitely needs some icing, but other than that, a very good dough to work with. Bakes to be the same brown as the raw dough was.

Excellent gingerbread flavor and the dough is verstile.  I've made gingerbread men and houses.  The dough rolls out well and is easy to work with.

Not impressed.  Only thing I did like about this recipe is that it contains no eggs, and so would be good for my vegan friends. (I myself have no prob w/ eggs).  I found the dough to be hard when chilled, too gooey when room temp. Most of all, the flavor was disappointing.  So I added half again as much sugar and doubled the spices plus an extra dash of ginger, and then some allspice.  I added these to the dough just before the second rollout, since the first batch was so disappointing.  This DID improve the flavor somewhat.
