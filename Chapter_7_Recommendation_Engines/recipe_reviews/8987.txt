This recipe is one of my husbandâ€™s favorites. It is quick, easy, and delightful. Though, I did add a few things to spice it up a bit. I also prepared it differently. The way that I prepared it takes much less time. Cook chicken in large saucepan over med/high heat; meanwhile follow directions on box of scalloped potatoes for STOVE TOP. When chicken is finished cooking and liquid runs clear, add potato mixture, cover, and reduce heat low/simmer for 20 min. While mixture is at simmer, dice up a ripe tomato and set aside. When 20 min. is up, add diced tomato along with bacon bits and pinch of oregano. My husband likes a lot of bacon bits, but you can do it to your taste. Recover for 5-10 min, or until done. You can even top it off with some shredded cheese when served to make it extra cheesy!

My whole family loved this casserole! I used Betty Crocker's AuGratin Potatoes mix in a box and it turned out great!! I added a little extra milk, half as much cheese, and 3 potatoes instead of 4. I also added the bread crumbs another reviewer suggested. YUMMY!!! We will definitely have this casserole again!

This was very yummy and super easy..it was also a family hit! I think, though, that next time I will micro the potatos a little bit before putting them in the mixture. The potatos were still a little bit too hard for my liking. I would definately add more cheese too! We are cheese people, thats for sure. Other than those two thing I think I would add veggies to it the next time to make it a complet meal. This was a great recipe for our family!

This recipe was as easy as it gets! I added some parmesean cheese and bread crumbs to the cheddar on top to make a crust which turned out really nicely, I may add broccoli or peas next time I make it so it's a full meal.

This was a HIT with my family! ~ It reminds me of a homecookin/comfort food kind of dish.  I actually don't use boxed scalloped potatoes very much, but I just happen to have some on hand to try this :)  I added some sauteed mushrooms and onions (just b/c we LOVE these in just about ANYTHING) AND a little garlic powder.  AND I "missed" the part about adding extra milk to the scalloped potatoes so I added it later (before folding, but while potatoes were still hot) WITH a couple of TBS of Cream of Chicken soup I had in the fridge I needed to use up.  I also added some bread crumbs and some green onions on the top too with the cheese (for flavor and color as well).  It's a little time consuming (not difficult, just not a really "quick" meal), but worth it :)  It would be a GREAT recipe re the time when you had some leftover chicken already cooked.  I was thinking after the fact it would be even BETTER with some bacon bits mixed in and/or on the top too ~ just in case it's not FATTENING enough for you :))  I will definitely add it to my favorites for a great weeknite "comfort food" kind of meal.  Thank you!  :)

I found the instructions to be rather vague.  I couldn't find scalloped potato mix alone so I had to buy the boxed w/potatoes.  I followed the liquid measurements best I could since the ones on this recipe and the box didn't match.  This was a disaster!!!  It may have been my fault but I have made several casseroles that have turned out great.  This is my first official "failure".  We're having mac and cheese for dinner tonight. :)

After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to par-boil the potatoes before adding them into the packaged mix.  It turned out great, and the potatoes were completely cooked.  Definitely a terrific choice if you're looking for an easy casserole.

The recipe as written probably only deserves 4 stars...but with my changes this is a 5 star recipe! First off, the potatoes need to be bake a bit before they are cut and put into this...otherwise they will come out crunchy. I also made sure to add a can of cream of chicken soup to this, as well as a small can of mushrooms. I'm thinking about tossing in some parmesan cheese next time as well.

I started making this recipe earlier in the day so I had enough time to do everything.  I cooked the potatoes on the box for stove top.  I added 1/2 tsp of poultry seasoning to the chicken and s&p as well.  I also added onion powder and poultry seasoning to the potato mixture.  The place that I got confused was when to add the actual potatoes to the scalloped potatoes.  Next time I think that I will par-boil them per another review here.  If I had done that the first time then maybe I wouldn't have had to cook the whole casserole longer than the recipe states. I also added bread crumbs to the top with the cheese for more of a crunch.

It tastes so good. I actually didn't have any scallop potatoe mix, so I seasoned the chicken breasts, cooked them until tender. Then I put 1 cup of milk and a can of cream of mushroom, put the chicken and potatoe mixture together, and WOW what a dish! Thanks for this awesome recipe!

I found this recipe to be rather bland, which could easily be blamed on a bad choice in my scallop potato mix.  Be sure you have a good tasting mix, this was a lot of work for a bland dish.

this turned out really well--reminded me of chicken pot pie. I did make several adjustments: used two boxes scalloped potatoes and cooked on stove. Sauted seasoned chicken and diced onions. When both were done, I mixed chicken in pot with potatoes, added a drained can of mixed veggies, and about a half can of cream of chick soup. Baked for 35 mins covered, then added cheese and italian bread crumbs and baked uncovered for about 15 mins. Many thanks to earlier reviewers for the good tips--this is a keeper!!

It was very bland.  The one packet of scalloped potato seasoning gave it absolutely no flavor...  And after an hour in the oven the potatoes were still crunchy (and I sliced them VERY thin); also watery.

I didn't brown or shred the chicken, just put it into the casserole dish, and it was fabulous as is... The Betty Crocker scalloped mix I used didn't have stovetop directions, so I mixed and put into the casserole dish as directed on the box, adding 1/3 cup more milk. Potatoes didn't quite get done to my liking, but I think next time I'll leave them covered to bake a little longer than recommended... Will attempt again because the chicken was amazing!

Tasted great! Like most others, I did have a few changes. I had leftover pork roast rather than chicken and actually added a potato since our local Russets are smaller than supermarket ones. I topped mine with herbed bread crumbs and green onions and a scattering of extra cheese. I missed that I wasn't supposed to put the cheese in with everything else and just stirred it in. I just cooked it for the total alloted time and it worked out great. Do grease the pan though! My sides were very burnt. I also added some thinly sliced carrots and will add peas or beans as well next time.

I'm giving this recipe only 4 stars because it does need the additions mentioned by other reviewers (onions, cream of mush. soup), but my boyfriend devoured it and the leftovers.  Very tasty and no mess!  Thanks for a keeper!

This recipe was not very spacific with what kind or scalluped potato mix you were supposed to get. I had to get dehiderated scalluped potatos. It got very confusing because the two didn't match up. I messed up and it seemed like it was going to turn out bad. It was watery and the scalluped potatos were crunchy, I had a very strange way of saving it. i added bread crumbs and parmasan cheese and fried it on the stove. it turned out diffrent, but good.

I had to cook this dish for at least an hour.  Also, the prep time was long for those of us who do not have a food processor to slice the potatos.

This was great!  Even got a 5 star rating from the husband who does not care for casserole type dishes.  Followed all instructions along w/ parboiling the fresh potatoes but added frozen broccoli before poping in oven only because I didn't want to dirty another pot :)  However I did not shred the chicken only because I have a non meat eater in the house but other than that it was wonderful, thanks for the recipe!!

It doesn't taste bad, which is why it didn't get only one star,  but it doesn't taste like anything.  Also, after 45 minutes the potatoes were still raw so I uncovered and baked for another hour and it was FINALLY done.  I ended up having to feed my younger kids hot dogs because this took so much longer than stated.  If you really added a bunch of other things it would probably be good, but I don't think this would be worth the extra trouble.  I'm deleting this from my recipe box.

This was pretty good and very simple.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for this time.  Next time I will season the chicken before I add it to the potatoes.  This was a hit with the kids!

fantastic! My friend made this for me two summers ago and it has been a favorite ever since! With reflux disease as advanced as mine is, it's difficult to find yummy food that doesn't disagree with me. Thank you for the recipe!

This was a really great meal! My husband loved it! I got the box of scalloped potatoes with everything already in the box-and i put it in the skillet like it said-then i cooked my chicken and put some chicken seasoning and i also cooked some broccoli with it as well i put a pinch of garlic seasoning like someone said and it gave it a nice taste- mixed it all up and put it in the oven! We will be fixing this again!

i don't know what i did wrong, but it turned out more liquid than anything else and did not look appetizing, so i made mac and cheese instead.

I followed the basic idea for this recipe, except that I made real scalloped potatoes with layers of potato and onion. I used mozzarella cheese since I didn't have cheddar. I also sliced up a kohrabi and threw in some peas as well. And I sprinkled onion soup mix powder between the layers and poured in a little milk. It was a hit.

This was a lot of work and tasted like nothing, despite the fact that I first fried the chicken with garlic, oregano, and basil, ground black pepper and sea salt.  If I tried this again, I would add a can of nacho cheese soup, but I don't think I will.  Too bad, it sounded like such a good idea!

This recipe is pretty awesome and cheap! The only things i changed was that i lined the casserole dish with a layer of seasoned rice so it was more of a meal itself. One of the times i made it, i also used bacon instead of chicken! All in all though it is super delish :)

This recipe did not work for me, the potatoes remained uncooked and hard as rocks.  I think perhaps the potatoes should be not just prepared according to package directions, but COOKED.  Then add the chicken and cook together.    I "prepared" the scalloped potatoes as directed, but did not cook them.  I added the cooked chicken, covered and baked.  But obvisouly, this did not work.

the dish turned out good but the recipe was so off. I can't help but wonder if this person actually made this before putting the recipe online. The milk amount was way too much. I had to cook it an hour and 15 mins on 400 just to get it where it was a casserole and not soup. So by the time it was done, my toddler already ate and wouldn't eat this. Not a quick fix dish at all.

We all loved this recipe. 4 potatoes were WAY too much. Had to compensate by adding half and half, more creamier and thicker than adding milk. Added some seasonings and some ham cubes. Turned out great. I will try using only 3 potatoes next time

Prep time definitely off. This took a lot longer than expected so if you are looking for a quick meal, this is not it. Directions are confusing, had to tweak it a lot. I used 3 potatoes and that was more than enough. Also added garlic and onion powder and LOTS of salt. Would have been very bland without it. Also added more cheese, which made it better. Cooked the scalloped potatoes by stove top directions (along with fresh potatoes), and it had to be cooked a lot longer than box directions, even with added milk and water. End result...if you can use this as a basic recipe, and make changes well, it might be good. Have to admit, kids loved it.

I made a few changes to the original recipe to add a little flavor.  I sauteed the chicken with some chicken/poultry seasoning, added half a can of cream of chicken soup to the sauce, sauteed some diced red pepper and onion to throw in, and tossed in some cooked broccoli.  I also mixed some crushed Ritz crackers with butter for a crumb topping.
I made this for a church potluck, and when I took it out of the oven this morning it looked (and smelled) fabulous!  However, after sitting in an oven "warming" for 2 hours at church, it lost some of it's appeal!  The sauce turned kind of a greenish yellow(which could be from my broccloi addition), the brocolli was mush, and the crumb topping had all but dissappeared!  So, this is maybe more a serve right away kind of deal instead of a potluck dish.  However, I still thought it tasted really good, despite its sketchy appearance!

My family enjoyed this meal but I only rated it 4 stars because I decided to add cream of mushroom to it the 2nd time around.  It was very good.  Easy to make.  Add some salt & pepper & the soup and it will be even better!

It turned out really great!  My whole family loved it, even my grandfather who is quite picky.  Only problem was it took a hour to cook rather then 30 min.  I think the recipe could be a little more clear.

I cooked it last night and it was so very good. My Wife and I loved it and it is great as leftovers! Like others I only used 3 potatoes but used 4 breasts only because we love chicken. Next time I think I'll add broccoli or another green vegetable to make it a complete meal. Great easy recipe!!!

Wow...this is great.  Next time I will cook longer - I cooked mine 25 minutes before adding the cheese...I bake closer to 35 next time.  Like others, I did not add additional potatoes due to time but may try it next time.

The recipe was vague and I had the same problem as other reviewers.  It was probably me but mine was not cooked thoroughly and had to finish it in the microwave.  It was a lot of work and came out dry to me even though I added the extra milk.  I probably won't try this recipe again because it was too much work to turn out a total disaster.

1 cup milk was way too much and it was very bland.  I would suggest maybe trying some of the other additions other uses put in.  My husband and I did not like it and we will not make it again.

I made this ahead of time to take camping and just reheated it and I think it made it too dry. It was good when I first cooked it but to warm it up, was not such a good idea and I even added milk. So I would say good recipe but not a cook ahead of time to save time kind of meal.

Not good at all- the potatoes were not cooked nearly enough and we ended up having to throw it into the microwave to cook it enough to even be edible.

I thought it was great. To make sure the sliced potatoes got done, I put them in the pot first. Once it started to boil I added the box. I also added steamed broccoli, green peppers and onion before baking.

I eliminated the pkg of scalloped potatos. I did add a can of chicken gravy and two teaspoons of cream cheese. Pour over chicken/potatoes in dish. Bake covered for 45 mins or until potatoes are done. Take out spread liberal amounts of  cheese in casserole and stir. Then add liberal amounts of  cheese on top. Put back in over for 10minutes.

I was looking for something to make tonight to work as a side dish for my leftover meatballs, and double as a quick reheat breakfast in the morning. I decided to make this but with bacon instead of chicken. It tasted ok, but I found it a little salty and apart from the salt a little bland. Chances are the mix I used or the fact I went with bacon instead of chicken made it salty, so may need to try the original version of this before I criticise the saltiness too much, but in any case it needs some pepper or spice to give it some more flavour. My 4yo ate hers and she is fussy with any form of potatoes that isn't a chip, so this is still a win and something I will make again, just with some tweaks.

I agree, as is-the recipe isn't a "wow factor", but jazz it up,and its amazing!  I added frozen veggies to the casserole and seasoned with salt,pepper,basil,and oregano.  Cooked for 40 minutes,then topped with crushed croutons and shredded cheddar cheese.  Then cooked for another 15 minutes. I think this should DEFINITELY COOK FOR ONE HOUR to make it a casserole, and not soup.  Thanks for the recipe! It was really good and worth waiting for.

I tried this recipe but due to a time crunch I used 2 boxes of the scalloped potatoes, 2 large cans of chicken (instead of cooking it myself)and I added extra shredded cheese. I used a 9x13 baking pan. It was a huge hit. I plan on trying it with ground beef soon.

Good idea, added some cubed ham to mine.  Really takes on flavor if the potato mix you choose.  My family ate it and seemed to enjoy. My husband also enjoyed leftovers the next day for lunch.

I thought this was delicious and easy. I had put my chicken in the crockpot in the morning and let it cook throughout the day. Then when I got home is all I had to do was shred it. To make it even easier I used a boxed three cheese potato mix. It only took me about 10 mins to whip it together and throw it in the oven.

The flavor was definitely there but next time I will boil the potatoes first that way they won't come out with this uncooked texture.

this recipe was really good. I made it for a large group of friends and everyone thought it was great.  I changed it only slightly by adding some diced onion. also, I mixed a third of a package of stove top stuffing mix and added another third of the stuffing mix to the top halfway through baking it.

Yum! We loved this recipe, and we have some picky eaters! I skipped the oil and used Pam to cook the chicken. I think next time I will add broccoli/cauliflower and then top with the cheese. Some nice crumbly bacon on top would be good too!

This recipe was okay.There was nothing wrong with the taste there just wasnt really a whole lot to it. I had it as a main dish and it probably should have been a side dish. I used 1/2 more milk than it said because I didnt have the right size pan and the liquid didnt cover all my potatos so I was afraid they wouldnt cook. But the 1/2 cup milk helped. I will make this again as a side dish.

I made this yesterday and it was very good. My boyfriend that isn't a fan of potatoes or chicken loved it. I wouldn't say that it was a quick meal though. I used baby red potatoes and cooked it for an hour to make sure the potatoes were fully cooked. I also added some bacon in with then cheese. I still felt like there was something missing though. I'll have to tweak it the next time I make it :)

This recipie was yummy and easy to make. Everyone ate it and it came out perfectly cooked at just the amount of time stated. I did jazz up the chicken before sauteing with some seasonings and cooked it in EVOO and some minced garlic. I also added sauteed onions and frozen peas to make it an all in one. Instead of the extra milk, I added a 1/4c Coffeemate. Really helps keep the fat down and gives that creamy taste! Will make again

I followed it exactly but i made it for 4 people so I downsized a bit, I used the suggestion of bread crumbs and Parmesan on top, It was really rather good, I would say i will definitely make it again just with more cheese! Thanks for the suggestions!

This was a good, comfort food sort of casserole.  I too was a bit confused as to what to do with the box mix and potatoes, but it worked out perfectly the way I ended up doing it.  I used a store brand box of scalloped potatoes, threw in the extra sliced potatoes, and cooked it all together with about 1 1/2 cups total of milk.   While no one raved about the end result, they seemed to enjoy it and the leftovers were finished the next day.  I will make this again when I feel in the mood for some comfort food.  Thanks for the recipe!

I too was slightly confused by the "mix" and potato idea.  I used no-name brand boxed scalloped potato mix (with the dehydrated potatos in the box), and followed the instructions the same, other than adding ten minutes to the cooking time to make it a little thicker.  Sure made for an easy and quick dinner.  I chickened out (no pun intended) and didnt put in canned peas or corn this time, but certainly will try that next time.

Very delicious.  But I had to cook it for much longer than the recipe said.  Overall, a wonderful dish that we truly enjoyed!
