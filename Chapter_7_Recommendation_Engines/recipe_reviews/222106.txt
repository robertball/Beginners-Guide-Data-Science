Tasted good. I added a bit more of the chopped veggies, left out the butter - added butter buds to get buttery flavor, used fat free cream cheese and broccoli instead of peas. Chicken was done WAY before 5-6 hours.. more like 3.5 - 4

Added celery and way more carrots to make it one dish meal.  Used 8 oz reduced fat cream cheese.  Served over quinoa. Yum!  Looks like it will freeze well for single servings for work!

I haven't tried the recipe and did want to comment on the critical note about it being a healthy recipe. I believe it said healthier, not healthy. Is that not a good starting place for those unhealthy people!

This was very tasty and easy to make. The only change I made was that I noticed that it was looking dry during the last 1/2 hour of cooking on high so I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth and it came out very nice. I do agree that it cooks in about 4 hours - 5 or 6 is much too long.

Easy.  To cut down on salt. Don't add the tsp. Of salt and make your own hicken broth. Eating healthier sometimes takes a bit of work. You can also buy no salt broth.

Delicious! My husband loved it and he only likes hot dogs, salisbury steak, and ice cream. The comments on it not being "healthy" shows that "healthy" is in the eye of the beholder. For me, 32.7 g protein and 6.5 g. carbs is really healthy. I substituted broccoli for the peas, so it was less than 6.5 g carbs. Sodium and fat are no big deal. One question: What is "natural cream of chicken soup?" Guess I must have used the unnatural kind.

I haven't tried this yet although I probably will. I think I would leave out the tsp of salt and let everybody season as they wish. I kept going back re-reading the 1 Tbsp of onion and carrot. Why in the world would you use that small of an amount for 4 chicken breasts?

This recipe was really easy and had good flavor.  I added more celery, onion, and carrot and only sprinkled in pepper.  I also added some mushrooms for more flavor.  My soup box had 12 ounces so I added all of it, which helped because I added cooked rice in the end to put it all together.  Overall, it had positive reviews and will be a regular in the house!

This was delish!  Do not skimp on the lemon zest and I even squeezed some lemon juice in for good measure. I had some herbs de Provence in the spice drawer and used in place of the parsley.  I really enjoyed this dish  it reminded me of some of the rustic specials I tasted while visiting Provence a few years back. It was not overly salty either. I added a bit of salt and pepper T the table in fact.  Also reviewers are right. It only takes 3-4 hours in slow cooker. Did. It have to put on high the laser 1/2 hour. Just used low setting.

Delicious and easy. It uses ingredients that most people have on hand. I cooked the chicken for four hours on slow, then added the remaining ingredients and cooked the dish on high for thirty minutes. The chicken was cooked through, yet very moist. My husband, who usually needs to be prodded about what he thinks about a dish said, "This is really good!" after the first bite. A definite "keeper."

Really great dish!   I made a few small modifications as per others to reduce fat and added broccoli , not peas.  Even my picky toddler ate it.  Yay!

Great base and wonderful suggestions for adjustments.  Thanks all for your input.  I served this to guests tonight and it was really tasty!  Please note, however, that I also followed the suggestions of various others (more carrots & onions, half the salt, did not have cream of chicken soup and don't know what "Neufchâtel" cheese is so used coconut milk and cream cheese, and cooked for about 4.5 hrs by the time we ate).  Will definitely make this again so I can try to make the original version.

Almost all recipes tried on this site are outstanding.  However, this one was not one of them.  The first time we ate it, my husband and I both thought it was rather tasteless.  I added more spices, also sour cream and soup to try to save it.  I thought it tasted pretty good but I took some to my son's house and my 7 year old grandson asked me why I brought that gross casserole.  Sorry, but this is not one I will make again.

Very easy to make. I think I'd put more carrots in it next time, and perhaps a sharper cheese to pep it up a bit. But overall really good.

Quick to prepare and tasty.  Substituted a large can of chicken (we're snowed in and this was on hand) for the chicken breast chunks.  Will use this recipe again.  Thank you!

We all thought this was good and would eat it again.  It's comfort food!  I left out the lemon as one of our family doesn't care for it.  I also left out the salt, something I always do.  I used 3 large chicken breasts.  After about 3-1/2 hours I added the soup, cheese, and peas.  I continued cooking on low, then set the slow cooker to warm after an additional two hours.  The peas were overdone, I should have added them later.  I served this over hot brown rice.  We think it needed a bit more seasoning, but not sure what.  It is a bit bland, but stroganoff is generally bland.  Next time I will try leaving out the butter.  After reading the reviews I noticed another did that with good results.  I think I may add slices of carrot and celery next time.  Maybe more garlic and onion as well.  A keeper recipe.  Thank you for sharing it!

I plan on making this soon, but will substitute a lower sodium alternative to the canned soup. It sounds almost more an a la king than stroganoff, but still sounds tasty.

I just bought a bag of frozen peas and carrots, and added two cups instead of the one. Also replaced the neufchatel cheese with cream cheese, and served over noodles. Tasty!

This as FABULOUS but with a little tweaking.  I don’t like “boiled chicken” so I lightly browned the chicken cubes very quickly first.   I didn’t use “regular” soy sauce.  I use California Secrets organic soy aminos.  I only cooked for 2 hours on low so chicken didn’t dry out.  Used Organic cream of chicken soup and then cooked on low with cream cheese and peas for about another 45 minutes.  Then let sit all day in crock pot til dinner time.  Served over gluten and soy free noodles.  DELISH !

very, very, very , very bland.  it needs A LOT of seasoning. I don't know how it got such a good rating.  I will make it again,  but I will make sure I add seasonings that will come through.

Just okay.  It was definitely nothing special.  Won't bother making it again.

I used 3% fromagais frais and a chicken knorr stock pot instead of the tinned soup, left out the cheese and sprinkled my own grated parmesan on to individual serving. It was very tasty with or without the cheese and enjoyed by all the family
