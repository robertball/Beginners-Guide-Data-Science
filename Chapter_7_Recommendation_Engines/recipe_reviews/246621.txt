Doubled the spices, added garlic powder.  Quarterd sausages.  Tossed and put all on cookie sheet.  Baked at 350 for 50 minutes.  Yummy!

I made this recipe slightly different , I omitted the Rosemary as we are not big fans of this herb, and used grilled chicken with hoisin sauce (soy vay) on it instead of the sausages as we are trying to stay away from processed food. It was absolutely delicious, the blend of the Brussels sprouts, sweet potato,red onion and the other spices was perfect . If you like it a little more spicy just add more cayenne pepper, otherwise try this recipe like it is written and enjoy.

I only made the veggie part as a side with my grilled split Cornish game hens. Prepared as directed and cooked in the cast iron pan on the charcoal grill with the hens. Stir the veggies every five mins or so to make sure they don't burn, but let some of them get crispy -- heaven!  Will make again and again.

The contrast of the different vegetables and spices was quite nice. I added a bit more cayenne since I like things spicy. I'll definitely make this one again.

Didn’t have red onions, swapped for a shallot. Roasted in oven at 350 for 50 minutes.  Keeping this one for later!

I did not have sweet potatoes so I use regular Yukon gold potatoes with skin on. I doubled the spices

Didn't have BBQ chicken sausage, just hot Italian chicken sausage so added BBQ smoked seasoning. Very tasty. Be careful not to over steam vegetables.

Yum! Grilled chicken with it instead of sausage. Made it a bit too spicy but I'll just say these are tears of joy.

Delicious! Even without the meat. Has a faint BBQ taste without the tomato. Like BBQ potato chips

Loved this!  I did not add the chicken nor the rosemary just cause I didn’t have any and it had just the right amount of flavor.
