Delicious, pretty, and simple. It needed a squeeze of lemon juice to cut the sweetness.

Used reduced fat cream cheese and walnuts instead of pecans.  Doubled the vanilla and added a bit of milk for consistency.  Delish!

I took another reviewer's suggestion and added a bit of lemon juice to cut the sweetness. I also used reduced fat cream cheese. This is delicious--we ate every bite.

I feel like a cheater when I make this salad. EVERYONE loves it and asks for the recipe. It is ridiculously easy and it makes me look like a kitchen goddess - Ha! I add a bit of cinnamon to the cream cheese. otherwise, it is wonderful as written.

This is a great fruit salad. I added red seedless and green seedless and with every bite full it's a little bit different of a flavor. I also used a little brown sugar and didn't use as much white it was delicious

So yummy and people loved it.  I substituted regular cream cheese for whipped cream cheese.  Makes it easier.

I made this and it was a hit. I added equal amount of sour cream to this recipe. When throughly chilled its mouth watering and cooling on a hot summer day. Dusted it lightly with graham cracker crumbs and toasted pecans.

A nice, refreshing summer salad.  We liked this, but the cream cheese mixture was a little thicker than what we would have like.  Next time I will try another reviewers hint of adding some lemon juice.  It will cut the sweetness, a little, and make the mixture a little thinner.  Overall, the taste was good and the salad was enjoyed by all.
