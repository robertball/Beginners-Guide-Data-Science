I hate ham, but my mother-in-law ordered me to make one for Easter dinner (we had it a day early this year). I bought a Costco pre-cooked and pre-sliced ham and used this glaze instead of the one that came in the package with the ham. I made extra glaze and was very, very generous with the glaze when cooking, and also put some out on the table so people could put extra glaze on their ham, if desired (I can only tolerate ham when it has tons of yummy glaze to cover up the hammy taste). OMG -- the ham was DELICIOUS. Everyone commented about how good it was, and my husband said it was better than Honey Baked Ham. This is my new favorite main course to serve when entertaining since it is so darn easy and stress-free.

I made the recipe exactly how it is written. That said, there were no directions on what to do with it! So, after cooking my 6 pound ham (covered) for 30 minutes at 325 degrees I put on the glaze. I recovered and cooked another 30 minutes, but I basted it after 15 to keep it moist. It turned out great! Note: I started with a fully cooked ham.

We've been trying to find a simple yet tasty glaze for our Thanksgiving ham and found and tried this recipe.  We are so glad we did!  It's Christmas now and we are making another ham using this recipe.

What a great and simple recipe.  It turned out to moist and flavorful. I had to use about 1/4 c maple syrup and 1/4 c honey because I didn't have enough honey and it was delicious!

Before putting on the glaze I rubbed the ham with maple syrup and brown sugar. I basted the ham every half hour. With a 1/2 hour left I heated the glaze until it thickened. I wish I would of done that from the start to have it stick a little better to the ham. The flavor was great.

I made this for a ham that I took to a pot luck on Christmas Day.  The ham was very moist and tasty.  I have cooked ham before without a glaze and it seemed to be dryer.  I will definitely use it again.

Wonderful and so simple -- an excellent base!  Leaves plenty of room for creativity.  I changed it up a bit, and added 1/4 cup pineapple juice and 1/4 cup of orange juice, instead of a 1/2 cup of orange juice.  I also added 3 tsp hot sweet mustard,  about 1/4 tsp of ground ginger and about a TBS of grated orange peel.  The pan gravy tasted so good with this glaze!

This is a nice, quick and easy glaze, but it IS VERY sweet. A lot of reviewers claim it's not that sweet, but IMO it's extremely sweet. The ingredients are: honey, brown sugar and orange juice. I guess if you drink a lot of soda and/or consume a lot of sweets, this might not seem that sweet to you, but I don't eat sugary things that often.

This is probably the 4th or 5th year I've used this recipe. Easy and amazingly delicious! I don't even both to use the ham glaze that comes with the ham. Only change I made was to double and sometimes triple this - only because I really really really love the flavor. My husband, who says he doesn't like ham, even loves how the ham turns out with this simple recipe.

I bought a spiral sliced ham and the glaze packet was missing from the package so I searched Allrecipes and found this one.  It was so easy and way better than the one that usually comes with the ham. I love that it's all real ingredients, natural.  I'll use this one from now on.

Easy to prepare and makes the ham taste super yummy. I used a little less orange juice and added some pineapple juice for a little extra zing. Very good.

It was tasty, but was too much/too sweet for my wife. I thought it tasted good. Will try tweaking it a bit next time and review again.

This is an excellent glaze and I will use it every time I make a ham. I had guests for New Year Day ham, everyone raved about the flavor of the glaze. So simple but really good. I studded the ham with cloves and the combined flavor was excellent.

Thought this would taste like a shoe. To my delight it tasted like a shoe with pineapple. Felt like Julia Child’s in that movie where she goes to Italy and preys on Hungry Young men in cafes.4 stars. For the movie, not the recipe.

Excellent basic recipe. I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of cloves (I would have added more of both, but my daughter prefers very sweet ham sauce). I only had 1/3 cup of honey, so I used maple syrup to make up the rest. 
I put all the ingredients in a saucepan and heated them to a boil, then glazed my ham every thirty minutes. I saved the rest to use as a sauce. 
I'm so glad I found this; I've been making hit-or-miss glazes for the last ten years.

This was so good! Made exactly as stated, not too sweet at all and gave the ham a very good flavor. Thank you for sharing :)

Made this glaze today for the easter ham.  It was my first time  being in charge of the ham so i was hoping to make a good impression.   Everyone in my family complimented how great the ham was multiple times... Even the very picky eaters that seem to always find something to complain about.  My son said it looked like food you would see on a tv commercial it looked so good, lol.   Very easy.  very good.   Will definetly make again and would recommend to everyone.

I'm not a huge fan of ham but WOW!  This is the only way I will.ever prepare a ham again.  I used a spiral sliced ham instead of a whole ham.  I also doubled the glaze and warmed it in a saucepan to help the sugar dissolve before basting each slice of ham.  After about an hour in the oven, I basted the slces again.  It took some time but well worth it.  Honey baked Ham has nothing on this recipe!

Nice, simple glaze. I used it on a ham steak when I pan fried it, and my husband liked the flavor and how juicy it kept the ham. Thank you!

Easy to make and tastes great with our spiral ham for Thanksgiving!  Added during the last 15 minutes of cooking.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone here enjoyed it! Like another reviewer, I did not have enough honey on hand. Therefore, I used 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup pure Maple syrup. My husband isn't really a fan of honey, so this substitution turned out perfect for him! For years, I always made the glaze with mustard. But this recipe will certainly replace it!

I switched up this recipe quite a bit but it came out fabulous. I used dark brown sugar , cutie juice, honey and about a table spoon full of jim beam. Combined all ingredients in a small pot, whisked it all together until the sugar dissolved and let it come to a boil. Taste it and if it has too much liquor in it add more cutie juice and honey.

It is so delish, I couldn't stop tasting it.. The only change I made is, I put cloves in the ham before basting it with the glaze.This glaze is a definite keeper!!!!!! It is so easy and fast to make, and really NO clean up. Don't think I would ever use another store bought glaze again....

Made as instructed. As a mom with a toddler, loved how quick and easy this was. Tasted good, nothing extraordinary, but it fit the bill! Might try tinkering with it sometime when I have more time...thinking about maybe adding some mustard or apricot, or maybe some cloves.

I made this glaze following the directions.  It was just sweet enough (and I like things sweet).  My daughter really liked it too. I will definitely try this again.

Delicious! My family raved about this glaze. Really made this the star of our Easter dinner. I didn't have orange juice and substituted with pineapple juice. Added some bits of crushed pineapple too. Would definitely make this again.

Awesome.  I just added a little lime juice for extra citrus kick and let it reduce down a bit.  Delicious.
