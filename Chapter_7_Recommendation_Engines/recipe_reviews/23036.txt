I thought this recipes was great!!!  I didn't add as much chicken to the broth, when the dumplings were added.  I only used 1 1/2 cups.  It was perfect.  I also didn't use any taragon.  It was the best soup I have ever had...

Delicious, but difficult. The dumplings were pretty mushy for me, and fell apart during cooking, making the cooking liquid very thick. 

Still made for a delicious soup, though, and I will definitely try it again, hopefully with prettier results.

I thought that everything about this soup was delicious.  Easy to make, and when the batch was gone, my husband wanted me to make another batch the same day!!

Very good flavorings.  I changed the recipe a bit, though.  I used reduced sodium chicken stock (and omitted the salt), added a couple of bay leaves (take out before serving), and instead of the dumplings, I put the chicken in the soup and used a tube of (reduced fat) refrigerator buscits (Pilsbury, etc), quartered.  It was a big hit with my family.

Even though this recipe took a long time to make, it was definately worth it.  The spices make flavor of the soup so delicious!(Although I wouldn't suggest using a blender because I had to purchase a new one after making this. I also wouldn't suggest that you hang on to the left overs very long due to the fact that the tarragon permeates the entire soup after only a few days.)

Dumplings taste a little dry, and I thought at first I had just made them wrong, but it's because there's chicken actually IN the dumplings.  It seemed like an interesting idea, but I think I'd prefer regular dumplings.  And, there were LOTS of steps to make it. But, it tastes good!

I used this soup recipe as a base for a lighter version of chicken and dumplings.  I also put a couple of diced potatoes in for hubby.  I found at the end it needed a little something, more salt and some cajun seasoning.  I liked the addition of all the veggies and the lighter broth.

We loved this recipe. I didn't like the chicken in the dumplings. I think they taste better without it. I have made this for family and friends and everyone loved it.

This was excellent with a few modifications. Colleen L's suggestion to reduce the chicken and add 1 tsp. baking powder was great, the dumplings formed just fine. I also omitted the terragon. Also, save yourself some work and reverse steps 2 and 3 and forget about draining the dumplings. I made the soup mixture first, then boiled the dumplings and poured the whole thing into the soup - delicious!

My husband & I loved this soup.I did not add tarragon or parsley.I only added 1cup of chicken to the   dumpling mixture but added 1tsp. baking powder & 1/2 cup of extra flour because the dough was too runny. We loved the dumplings because we like them heavy.I also sprinkled fresh chopped green onions on top.

when my mom was cooking it,it smelled good.when i tasted it was pretty good.i didnt really like the dumplings.[my mom added peas and subtracted a little flower]. zack
Mom:  I cooked the chicken, carrots, celery, and some quinoa in the crock pot while at work.  It was easy to make the dumplings, boil stock and throw it together.  I liked it;  will make it again, might go more Italian like a wedding soup

I enjoyed making this dish.  It was my first time making chicken and dumplings and it turned out tasty.  I will make this again but with a couple of changes.

I agree the dumplings were a bit too mushy.  I added a little flour.  I made a few other changes, simply because we like our carbs.  I added more broth and bowtie pasta.  Overall, this was a fantastic recipe.  We loved it and will definitely make it again.

I omitted the chx in the dumplings, and halved the chicken in the pot. I added a chopped potato and substituted cinnamon for the tarragon. Also, I ended up desiring a thicker, creamier soup, so i mixed a few Tb flour with a cup of milk and stirred that in towards the end. Delicious outcome and fabulous recipe.

VERY GOOD*****I modified it a bit with adding less chicken & used fresh tarragon for my dumplings. It does take longer than listed however it's worth it!

Excellent.  Savory.    I did the dumplings in two batches, so there was room in the sauce pan.  Used rotisserie chicken, which stayed moist. Used Low Sodium Broth.  Cut most of the salt. Made 1/2 batch...next time it will be full batch.

This sounded so good and to me that is part of what makes a good cook if you can look at a reipe and tell if it's good. Well, I lost out on this one. The soupy part was good, but the chicken dumplings were not. The texture is what was so bad. I didn't like the tarragon flavor in this recipe, though I like tarragon. The dumplings were too soft to work with and the recipe as a whole was very time consuming. What we didn't eat, we froze. We will probably discard the dumplings and replace them with oysters....my husband's suggestion. Anyway, sorry SILVANUS, but I have to give a thumbs down on this one. I will not try this again.

Rich and flavorful. I couldn't stop eating it. One WARNING--it's extreemly difficult to get the dumplings to form. I finally gave up and added the dumpling mixture to the soup which created a very rich broth.  Also, I did NOT put chicken in the dumpling mixture and put it in the soup instead.

Absolute best chicken dumpling soup recipe ever! Bursting with flavor, though i did change it a bit: For the dumplings, i used whole wheat flour and only 1 cup of turkey. (It was a dumpling and turkey soup because that's what I had, but it tasted phenomenal!) They were fantastic, though i would recommend cooking them for at least 10-15 minutes. As for the soup, I followed what it said, but didn't use onions or celery and sauteed minced garlic in about 1 Tbsp. butter, I also used peas and carrots, and added 2 bay leaves, about 2-4 tsp. parsley and 1/2-1 tsp. tarragon. All-in-all....AMAZING and will be making often!

I didnt use the flour in the broth as not sure how it would taste and wanted a more healty alternative.  the dumplings were wonderful.  I saved a ton of money buying a whole chicken and making my own broth.  I also added parsnips love it.  I love this web site!!!

This is the only recipe I have ever found that I didn't modify drastically. I only cut out the salt (the saltiness from the broth is plenty), blended everything but the flour and whisked it in and added more broth. Awesome, thank you!

I grew up around Chicken and Dumplings.  My grandma is southern and makes it all the time.  I have her recipe and through the years have given it a couple tries myself.  I have always liked it.  I stumbled on this recipe and gave it a try.  I LOVED this one soooo much more.  No offense to dear grandma but this soup is delicious.  My family begs me to make it and although it does take some time the outcome is rewarding.  The thing i like the most is actually using chicken in the dumplings.  It is not only delicious but very filling.  5 stars!  if i could give it more stars i would!

I thought this was a great recipe. I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery to save time...I would recommend to reduce the salt if you do this. Otherwise really good and hit the spot on a cold winter night!

Awesome soup. Rich and flavorful enough to serve at a dinner party like I did. Family loved it.  I had problems with the dumplings not all taking shape.  It might have been me. Pro
portions of ingredients is perfect.

This was the best chicken dumpling soup I have ever tasted.  It had lots of flavor, We loved it, it was well worth the work.  Thank you Letha!

I don't really cook very much but my boyfriend was sick and this is what he wanted so I made it.  It was soooooo good....I was surprised.  It is a bit of a pain to make but well worth the effort and the smell is incredible.

Made per recipe.  Been successfully cooking 60  years and this just did not go well.  Threw most of the dumplings away. Dumplings would not form.   Left with small bits of partially cooked flour balls floating on surface.  Wanted to like it, just too much work for disappointing results.

Amazing soup!  I did do some alterations including: added a little half and half (1/2 cup?) to the soup for a little creaminess.  Also used corn meal in the dumplings for texture.
YUM!!

The dumplings turned out great for my family.  Even my wife ate them and she said she did not like dumplings.

This soup was outstanding! I made it for my friend and I (she loves dumpling soup). I made a few changes though. First, I didnt put everything in a food processor, just the meat (I actually used left over turkey) to make it fine and crumbly. I beat the egg and mixed into the turkey along with the flour and the other ingredients. I ommited Tarragon because I didnt have any. Also, I boiled the turkey carcus in the chicken broth for a good hour to make a more flavorful stock. This dish was SOOO good. The dumplings were perfect. Although, some reviewers said they were too mushy...I added extra flour to mine and the texture was perfect. Worth the work. YUM!

This recipe is pretty great, although I tweaked it a bit based on what was (or was not) in my fridge. As recommended by another reviewer, I added potatoes to this and simmered them with the celery and onions. Because I didn't have enough carrots, I added about a cup of mushrooms to the recipe as well. I also didn't put the chicken into the dumplings and as a result, had to add a little extra flour to bring the dumplings to the proper consistency. Finally, at the very end of the entire cooking process, I added a 1/4 cup of light cream and a tablespoon for fresh lemon juice just to freshen it up a bit and make the soup even more substantial. It was AWESOME. Will totally make it again...
