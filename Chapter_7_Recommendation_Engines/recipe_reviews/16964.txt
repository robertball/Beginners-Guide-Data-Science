I'm very shocked at how much my family enjoyed this! I chose this recipe because even though I generally do not like casseroles, my husband and daughter enjoy them and I had these ingredients on hand. I made a few minor changes and it was fantastic, my husband ate 4 plate fulls and wants what is left for his lunch tomorrow!  I halved the recipe, used reduced fat cream of mush soup, added 3/4 cup of sour cream, I used 3 slices of kraft deluxe american cheese and about 1/4 of a block of colby jack cheese, some garlic powder and sauteed the onions in olive oil until tender. All I had was a packet of the new "fresh" smoked starkist tuna and it worked beautifully, no fishy taste! I undercooked the noodles slightly and after I mixed all the ingredients together I poured it into a greased casserole dish.  I mixed about 3/4 of crushed butterwheat crackers with a tablespoon or so of melted butter and topped the casserole with the crumb mixture. I added a grating of fresh romano cheese and baked at 350 until the top was golden (about 20 minutes).  I let it set up outside the oven for 5 minutes and served it. It is one of the few casseroles I have really liked, and that my family loved! Try it, and adjust it to the taste of your family, quick, easy and yummy.

Awesome, we'll never buy tuna helper again!! :) I adjusted the recipe as follows to make less and account for our tastes:  1/2 package noodles, 1/2 can peas, 1 can cream of cheddar soup, 1 can tuna, 1/2 onion chopped and sauteed in olive oil first, 5 slices american cheese.  I also heated the soup, cheese, and tuna in the microwave before I added it to the cooked noodles in order to have it mix well, which it did fantastically!  This made plenty for four.  You could use any cream soup,and brocolli would be a really good vegetable too.  Even my 2 year old ate this!  Be sure to sautee the onions before adding them if you don't want them crunchy!

It really is quick and easy, but I added about a cup of milk and it was much better.  Without the milk it was a little too "stuck together".  Tasty!

My roommates all have midterms so I wanted to give them a little taste of home. So I gave this one a try because it looked good and didnt take a long time to cook. I substituted Jack cheese for american, and added sauteed mushrooms and garlic to the onions. I also sprinkled some garlic powder after everything was mixed. Everyone loved it and after 2-3 servings each,i have none left over for tomorrow!!! Even the roommates that dont like fish loved this one.... its a keeper!!!

It is near grocery day and I was looking for a quick and economical dish with what I had in the house. I halved the recipe, and it fit nicely in a medium sauce pot. But, there is something I do not understand about this recipe. HOW CAN ONIONS COOK IN 2 MINUTES? When I read the recipe and it said cook until the cheese melts I had a feeling the onions would still be "CRUNCHY!" So, I chopped them to a practical mince. But, they were still crunchy, as expected. If you are looking for a quick affordable meal this will work. It is as good as any oven baked tuna casserole and creamy. This is a dish I would make for kids but not adults, so if that is your intent it will work. However, I would pre-soften the onions slightly until transluscent before adding to the pot.

You will never use Tuna Helper again after trying this recipe!  I thought it was actually easier than Tuna Helper and the end result was fantastic.  I used less peas (personal preference) and I sauteed the onion first so it wouldn't be crunchy.  I also topped it with cheese and seasoned bread crumbs and put it under the broiler till it was nice and bubbly.  I needed something in a pinch, being short on time, and ingredients since I didn't get to the grocery store today.  This recipe saved the day!  Thanks Jennie!

I used ingredients I had on hand: 1 cream of mushroom and 1 cream of celery, canned peas, rigatoni pasta, and 1 cup shredded cheddar, along with remaining listed ingredients. It was still pretty good, but could have used some celery salt, garlic powder, and a pinch of ground mustard.

Bacon and the Holy Trinity were my additions to the great simple meal.  My hubby is not a huge fan of tuna, so I jazz it up a bit to make him happy.  Four  slices of smoked slab bacon crumbled in and added with the all white tuna (less fishy he says).  I drained but didn't clean the skillet after the bacon, then added the butter and sauteed the Holy Trinity (onions plus carrots & celery diced small), before adding the soups (plus a half can of milk). A dash of celery salt and some sweet basil added nice complexity to the creaminess, and voila, even He loved it! ;)
ps forgot to add that I left the cheese out of the sauce and just layed it over half the topping - he's weird in that he's not big into cheese, so this way I got it, but he didn't have to.

My husband had two helpings and said to give it five stars!  Used half the pkg of pasta and while the pasta was cooking, I sauteed chopped onions, broccoli, canned mushrooms and diced ham in olive oil with a little pepper and garlic salt in a pan.  Then stirred in one can tuna (didn't drain), one can cream of mushroom soup and three handfuls grated cheese. I also added frozen peas and carrots mix at this point.  After the cheese melted, I added all this to the drained noodles sitting in the pot and kept cooking until the peas and carrots were heated through. Simple and easy dish to make!  Had a can of sliced olives I was going to add to it but forgot -- next time!

Overall, a very good recipe. I used cheddar shreds, dried onions, and added some sour cream. Very easy and adaptable.

I've been making something similar for 25 years. My mom made it for years before me with cream of mushroom as well, but one of my kids doesn't like mushrooms, so I've always used cream of celery soup! I saute diced celery and onion in a small amount of olive oil until soft, add the soup and half a can of milk along with the drained tuna and stir until bubbly. Pour that into your cooked pasta, stir well, and turn half of the pasta mixture into a casserole dish. We LOVE cheese, so I top it with a mix of grated cheddar and jack cheese, (per your taste) layer the remaining pasta, then another layer of cheese. We prefer veggies on the side (rather than mixed in) or a salad. But that's the beauty of this dish; it can be customized so easily for your family's taste. You can also use canned chicken if you don't like tuna. Yum!

This was one of the favorite Friday Lenten dinners growing up. Delicious!  A great added touch is throw it all into a casserole dish with crushed potato chips on top!!!  Put it in a 350 oven for 15 minutes or so.  Thanks!

I was looking for a tuna casserole recipe and was just not sure what I was looking for. I found this recipe, and used it as a "base" if you will. I made several changes, although I am sure the caserole would have been just fine if I followed the recipe to a "t".

My changes were as follows:

Instead of egg noodles, I used elbow noodles, only because I forgot egg noodles at the store and I had elbow noodles in my pantry. Instead of using 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of celery soup. I replaced frozen peas with frozen chopped broccoli and instead of using american processed cheese, I used shredded mild cheddar. I also added some french fried onions to the mix. I topped with a little more cheese and some more french fried onions and baked in the oven until golden. 

We liked the casserole and will eat it again. It was nice and quick and easy, great for when you are just coming home from work and don't really feel like cooking!

My mom was cooking tuna casserole when i was a kid, only she used cheese soup, later we started using the jars of queso in the chip aisle and mixed in with the mushroom soup. She also crushed potatoe chips and in the last 5 mins of cooking she poured them on top of the casserole.  and let it cook uncovered for 5 mins more.  The chips really make even more of a difference

I have made this for years.  Instead of cheese & noodles separately, I use a box of Kraft mac & chez.  Tastes great and is quicker and easier!!!

I made this a vegetarian version and made with 1 can of garbonzo beans (mashed) instead of tuna. I did not add cheese either. I used 1 can of sweet peas instead of frozen. I mixed all ingredients on stove top and then put in a 9x13 casserole dish. I sprinkled potato chips on top and baked for about 20 minutes until bubbly. Was fabulous!! So much easier than making from scratch! Will FOR SURE make this again!!!!

My daughter has never ate tuna. I made this recipe and we told her it was chicken. She kept saying how good it was. Finally, her bowl was empty and we told her that she ate tuna. She was so proud of herself and we were proud of her as well. Needless to say, this is a keeper recipe for me!

This was very good and easy!!! I added 2 stalks of celery (sliced) and I browned it with the onion with garlic and oil before adding it to the pot. I also added chili powder, garlic salt, a little more pepper and I used shredded cheddar instead of american cheese. After it was done in the pot I put it in a baking dish and covered the top with shredded cheese and baked it at 325 for 10-15 min until it was all melty. It was delicious! Thank you!

followed the basic recipe with a few tweaks and came out with a good little meal.  I was surprised how well the processed cheese slices melted over the noodles.  too bad i just discovered my roommate hates the smell of canned tuna.  she is running around the apartment screaming.  perhaps i will refrain from making anything-tuna for a little while.

We loved this recipe - I did combine it a few things from another on this site, but this recipe was the base.  After combining everything I added shredded cheddar on top, baked at 350 for 20 minutes - added french fried onions and baked for 5 more minutes.  Thank you for an easy tasty one dish meal!

My family enjoyed this recipe very much.  I did a few things different.  I added 1/2 of milk and cooked mixture in a 9 x 13 for 15 minutes then put cheddar cheese on top and melted that in the oven.  I will make this at least twice a month.  Great recipe.

This was very easy and tasted like comfort food.  I don't like mushrooms so I used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of celery soup instead.  I also added about a cup of milk at the end as it was a bit thick.  Next time I'll also let the mixture cook just a bit longer to soften the onions.

Quick and easy, definitely.  Tasty, very much so.  Only change I would make next time is to put the chopped onion in the boiling water with the pasta and peas to soften it a little.

I made some of the changes that other reviewers recommended. I added about 4 cloves of garlic, a cup of milk, some fried mushrooms and I fried the onions and because I don't like peas, I used corn. I also put it all in an ungreased casserole dish with mozzarella and breadcrumbs on top and baked at 375 for 20 minutes. It was pretty good, first time I've ever had tuna casserole but something was missing. It wasn't very flavorful, I really felt it needed maybe some celery salt or who knows. If you can get the right spices in here, it would be good. Perhaps if I did this again, I would do one can of mushroom and one can of celery soup.

I made this with only a few very small adjustments. I added a half cup of milk as another review suggested (so it's not pasty). I added some Garlic powder, and sauted the onions first. It was very good and is definitely a meal adults can eat (not sure why someone else said this would be ok for kids but not adults). This tasted even better reheated the next day. I gave it a 4 star rating instead of a five star because without the milk and cooked onions, it would not be as good. Thank you for sharing this.

Very good. I made as directed and did not miss the crumb topping. While the pasta was draining I did cook the onion in 2tbsp butter to soften it, then added back all the ingredients to the pot. I also had a steamer bag of frozen veggies so I microwaved them as directed and added with everything else. I do think this needs more tuna (I used 3 5oz cans). Thanks for sharing.

Made this yummy casserole yesterday and enjoyed it for supper. (Froze the remainder for a later meal.)  I used a 22oz package of large macaroni, added an extra can of mushroom soup and 1/4 cup half and half to make up for the extra pasta.  Also didn't have cheese slices so I cut up a brick of processed cheese into small cubes and put them in the mixture to melt.  Otherwise everything was the same.  It stretched the recipe and didn't change the taste at all.  It was creamy and delicious.  Will be a huge hit with grandkids.

I didn't use as much cheese as the recipe called from and it was still delicious.  Use your own judgment on things like cheese.

This was yummy, and a great meal to whip up using the contents of the pantry/fridge/freezer.  I only had one can of soup, so added some leftover sour cream and milk to compensate.  I fried the onion and also some extra mushrooms.  Used cheddar and parmesan instead of American cheese as I'm not in America, and added cornflake crumbs to my cheese mix which I then sprinkled over the top before baking in the oven until it browned.  It's a keeper.  I'll be making this again

MADE THIS LAST NIGHT JUST FOR THE WIFE AND I (1/2 RECIPE) AND HAD ENOUGH FOR TWO MEALS. IT WAS DELICOUS. TOPPED IT WITH A BIT OF ASIAGO CHEESE AND PAPRIKA.
NOTE-NOT A BIG TUNA FAN, SO I WAS REALLY SURPRISED.

My family does not like tuna casserole so I substituted chicken in place of the tuna. I also sprinkled panko bread crumbs on top and baked at 350 for about 30 mins. It was delicious.  I may even try it someday using tuna, who knows it may be the first tuna casserole my family will eat.

This was super! =D I followed the recipe as much as I could. I didn't have tuna, so I used canned chicken instead. I also don't keep processed cheese on hand, so I used shredded sharp cheddar. I sauteed the onions with the peas, mixed in the cans of cream of mushroom soup and a can of milk because it was too thick without it. I also baked it because I like the crunchy, melty top you get when you add cheese on top. I will definitely be using this recipe again and again! Yummo!

Very good!  A nice, basic tuna casserole recipe.  I think even a small onion chopped would have been too much for this dish - I used about 1/4c finely chopped and it was plenty without being overwhelming.  I also used only 1 can of soup and added I can of milk for a creamier consistency.  I also added a little garlic powder, dried mustard and a touch of celery seed.  The sliced American cheese was a nice addition and I had some from the deli that I wanted to use up, but only used about eight slices.  Will make this again - hubby loved it.
ETA on 9/10/10 - I am making this again and looked up the recipe and wanted to add that I also baked it for 30 mins at 350 and tonight I'm adding fried onions to the top.  Hubby just loves this meal and that works for me!

Yummy.  My 3 young girls have been making this for our family since we found it here several years ago.  At the time they were 7, 7 and 5 years old.  One is an extremely picky eater but when she gets to cook this she can't seem to get enough.  I've even convinced them to add extra peas to the dish.  Now the only problem is keeping track of who's turn it is to cook it!  :)

A quick and delicious recipe. The onion flavour can be overpowering so I suggest only using half an onion. This will bring out the taste of the tuna, the peas, and the creamy mushroom. I enjoyed it very much and will make it again with less onion.

I made a lightened version of this, and it came out wonderful.  I am sure the full fat version would taste even better...however being that I was able to lighten up I feel better making this for my family.  I cooked the pasta and peas and set aside.  I sauteed the onion in 1 T light Margarine.  Then I blending in 2 T of flour.  I added 1 cup of skim milk and stirred, it thickened quickly.  I then added a can of reduced fat soup.  Then, the rest of the ingredients.  I also added about 1/4 t of salt at the end...it needed it.

It really made A LOT of food too.  I know she had down 5-7 servings.   For us, its more like 8-9.  In fact, this last time there was so much I ended up freezing it!

This was great and quick, and easy to turn into a lower fat meal.  I haven't had much success with recipes that meet both criteria so I was very pleased to try this creamy no-cook dish.  I sauteed up broccoli and onion and 1/4 c. corn and did what others suggested with microwaving the soup/cheese/tuna and milk. (I also added a c. of milk with just one can soup.)  The sauce was the perfect amount and it tasted delicious.  I will probably add ham and carrots next time, but only when the kids are out. They liked the dish but complained bitterly about the veggies. Also, I will steam the brocolli instead of sauteeing it since it was a little too crunchy for our taste.  I wouldn't add more cans of soup or all that cheese, like the recipe suggests.    Making it this way cuts down on the fat without compromising the taste.

This was really good.  My husband called it a winner! I did alter the recipe slightly: only used 1/2 a large white onion, used 1 cup sharp cheddar and 5 pieces of American cheese, and I did add about 1/2 cup of skim milk so it wasn't so thick.

I followed this recipe exactly for tonights dinner.  This casserole is incredible.  My kids loved it and so did we!  My husband and kids crumbled their crackers over the top of their servings and it was gone before I even sat down!
Thanks for a fantastic easy recipe!

I thought this was pretty good, and I'm not a huge tuna fan.  My hubby had asked for tuna casserole, and I had never made one before, so I gave this one a try.  I followed the recipe as written but thought it looked a tad dry so I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream.  My hubby had 3 helpings and asked that next time I put crushed potato chips on top.

This was just okay, I have another Easy Cheesy Tuna Casserole recipe from another site that I love and it's just as easy.  Although, the steps were very simple and was perfect for a single mom like me to put together after getting home late.

I really liked this!  I just used healthy request cream of mush and cream of chicken, since that's what I had.  Also threw in some garlic powder, a dollop of sour cream, and some canned mushrooms since I love them.  I mixed in 2 slices of cheese and laid the others (which ended up being 5 more - so a bit healthier) on top and baked covered, removing cover towards end just to get hot and melted.  It was good!

I sauteed the onion (and a little garlic) in olive oil first, then added the other ingredients. I don't really like egg noodles because they are too mushy, so I used bowtie pasta instead.

I used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of shrimp.  I put this in a casserole dish and added shredded cheese on top.  I only have one question about this recipe.  Maybe I used the wrong cheese.  It wouldnt melt.  I used ten slices of kraft cheese.  I will be making this again.  It was very nice.  Next time I will used velveeta.  Thanks

this was a very good meal that was very quick and easy.  i added 1/4 cup milk and 1/3 cup mayo and only used 6 slices of cheese and the sauce was perfect. we didn't have peas so i used canned mushrooms instead.

This was an easy and ok recipe. Not bad and not something i'd make every month. I used french fried onion rings instead of onion and added some pimento. DO not use more than the 12 ounces of noodles, or this will be very dry. Next time i think i'll try the "tuna noodle casserole from scratch" recipe on this site, as i am really looking for a different sauce rather than canned soup.

This recipe was all that was promised!  I made a few minor alterations to this recipe based on ingredients I had on hand and turned it into more of a casserole.  I added 1/2 can of milk to thin it out a bit, and I used shredded colby jack cheese instead of the american cheese because it was all I had.  After it was all mixed together I placed it in a casserole dish, sprinkled fried onion rings on top and baked it at 375 degrees for about 8 minutes...just long enough for it to heat up and the cheese to melt.  The only reason I finished this recipe in the oven was because I didn't like how my pot was cooking it on the stove.  I'm sure when I get a new pot, it will cook up just fine on the stove top!  All-in-all a super easy tuna dish that just became a family favorite!  I will never use that salty tuna helper boxed stuff again!!  Thank you!!!

We all thought this recipe was the best Tuna Casserole we have ever had.  I had subsituted a can of Cream of Celery for one of the cans of Cream of Mushroom, because our children aren't terribly fond of mushrooms.  I also used onion powder instead of fresh onion, just to save time. I followed the advice of one of the other reviewers and warmed the soup/tuna mixture together while the noodles cooked.  I made enough to feed an army, and it was all gone in one meal...with some of the boys asking for more.  I will definitely make this recipe regularly!

I've made this recipe twice. Both times it was great.  The second time I used half the noodles, only 1 can of tuna, 1 can of mushroom soup, half the cheese, and no onion.  I also used frozen mixed vegetables instead of just peas.  But the thing I found made the most difference was that I heated up the tuna/soup/cheese in a wok while the noodles were cooking. This saved time and the dish turned out much hotter.  Plus you don't burn the bottom of the pot. The first time, I couldn't get the dish hot enough without burning the pot.  When the noodles were ready I just put them in with the mixture.  This tuna casserole is delicious and is so fast.  It only took 20 minutes.

It really works!  Nothing fancy, nothing funny.  Add the veggies you like, your favorite creamy soup, add some olives or peppers, and adjust the amount of onion to taste.  Or, don't cook any noodles and serve over biscuits or toast.  We enjoyed this on Good Friday (and my husband is very much a meat and potatoes man...)

I added a can full of milk to this too, and a whole bunch of Velveeta so it got nice and melty. I added some steamed broccoli and sautéed half an onion. I baked this at 350 with more cheese on top and topped that with some garlic croutons that I'd pulverized. Yummy!

This recipe is okay except that I made the mistake of putting the onions in raw.  My husband's first comments was, "the onions aren't cooked."  Do everyone a favor and sauté the onions before adding them to this dish.  Otherwise, an acceptable recipe.

My first time making this casserole. I liked that it did not involve the oven. I added ground  red peppers to the recipe for a little more bite. " Perfect".  Easy to make and delicious to eat. I did not use the onions

This recipe works great for the person that is always on the go or just don't feel up to taking several hours to get a meal ready. I tried it last night as I didn't feel like making my regular tuna casserole since I had knee surgery earlier this week and not to mention the boyfriend has been begging me to make him tuna casserole. Lol. I did a couple things differently and I was a little skeptical at first since this casserole is only made on the stove top and doesn't require the oven, of course you as the cook can change all that, it just requires more time. Instead of using egg noodles, I used a 16 oz box of elbow noodles that was sitting on my shelf, a can of peas (drained) two cans of cream of mushroom soup condensed, added a soup can and a half of vitamin D milk. I also sautéed the onions in a little skillet with olive oil and some garlic salt, don't sauté the onions complete, leave a little bit of a crunch, add the whole pan to the mixture as well but make sure you don't use too much oil or seasoning. Once I drained the noodles and added all the ingredients, I added garlic powder, garlic salt, black pepper and salt, season to your taste. We did do the 10 pieces of Velvetta cheese and I did end up using four cans of tuna instead of two since both the boyfriend and I love tuna and there just seemed like there wasn't enough. After we tried it, I was really amazed, the casserole was very good. Will do again! The bf couldn't stop eating it! It wasn't too cheesy either! :)

Great recipe! Have used this recipe for the past couple years and my husband absolutely loves it. Says its better than his mother used to make....oh Touché?? That aside, this is a great recipe. I always try to stay with the basics and don't go too far on the wild side with different ingredients.  The only change I made to this was using cream of onion soup instead of mushroom, added milk (I fill the small can after I pour out the soup into my mixture) and about a half cup of sour cream. I sautéed the onion in some good extra virgin olive oil (first cold press made in Italy is the best). Thanks to the prior rating I read about sautéing the onion:) Oh, I left out the peas too but that's up to you. Great recipe. Everyone will love it!

Excellent easy recipe!  The only thing I changed was to fry up the onions a bit so they weren't raw.  I also used regular cheddar cheese instead of slices.

Made some alterations to suite our family. Sauteed onion in olive oil. Used 2 cans tuna, 1 can cream of mush, 1 can cream of chick, black pepper, garlic powder, 3 slices of cheese & 1/4-1/2 cup shred cheddar & mozzarella as recommended by others.  Thinned sauce with milk as we like it more saucy!  Topped with Italian bread crumbs & tossed in oven at 325 for 30min.

This is a great weeknight meal, it's quick and easy and tasty!  I make it about once a month.  I omit the onion and I replace processed cheese with shredded cheese of any sort.  American cheese tastes disgusting to me.  I throw in a lil cottage cheese too, maybe a half cup or a lil more.  A little milk keeps it moist, can't go wrong there either.  And oh wait, no oven here.  I mix it all up and throw it covered, in the oven for 30 minutes.

This was really gooey-perfect for a winter dish.  Who knew that such ordinary ingredients could taste so good?  It was really easy because unlike other tuna casseroles, you don't have to wait for it to bake in the oven.  Next time I will cook the onion beforehand, though.  The raw onion gives it a crunchy texture, but the flavor was so strong that it went up my nose as if I was eating wasabi.

This was yummy and easy. Added a little dill to cut the classic tuna taste and I'm toying with the idea of adding a breadcrumb or crumbled crouton sort of thing next time, just to add a little crunch but it was really yummy as is. It's like tuna helper but without all the added garbage in processed foods.

I made this the other night for my family and it was good but bland. I even used a little more seasoning than it called for. I will make this again I just might add more seasoning to add more flavor. Otherwise,  my family enjoyed it.

Great easy recipie when you have 4 hungry kids to feed!  I have to double the recipie and barely have anything left!  I use 4 cans of tuna, a bag of frozen peas & carrots, 2 bags of egg noodles, 1 package of cheese slices(15), 2 cans of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of cheddar.  Left the onion out and seasoned with grail and onion powder, pepper and a pinch of Italian seasoning.  This one is a keeper!

Added about 1/2 soup can of milk as others suggested.  Used mozzerella (2 cups.)  Used 1/2 chopped onion, microwaved it for a bit to soften.  Baked in the oven after mixing up in pot, at 350 for 20 min.  I'd be tempted to put more tuna in it next time....but maybe not.

Quick and easy. Used elbow macaroni, provolone, and canned Veg-All (because it's what I had on hand). Turned out quite yummy

This was simply outstanding. Everything blend well and Mom certainly enjoyed it. However, my boy did not take a fancy toTuna. He kept on saying, "Sorry Charlie." Still going to have it again this week. Great Meal with reasonable cost. Thanks!

Not that great.  Taste was bland, but it was very easy to make since it doesn't have to be cooked in oven.

some people that read the directions would wonder why you did not say to pre heat the oven to 350 or whatever temp? & then bake for 30 min or so?? please remember - some of the up & coming cooks in hear are beginners.

This recipe is pretty tasty. I'm a college student and this is the kind of quick recipe I've found myself hunting for recently. 

I scaled it down to serve 2. When I went to the store this weekend I forgot to buy peas, but it's still good without them. I'm a busy and broke student who doesn't feel like chopping onions, so I used dried chopped onions instead of chopping a fresh onion (note, fellow students: you can buy 5th Season chopped onions for 50 cents in the spice section whatever store you shop at). 

Next time I make this I think I'll sub one of the American cheese slices for Swiss (two servings calls for 4 slices of cheese) or Colby-Jack or something and definitely won't forget the peas. I think adding some sliced mushroom would give it a little something extra too. It would be a five star recipe with mushroom slices and another cheese. 

But, hey, to me four stars is pretty dang good. I would eat this again, and in fact I will eat it again when I heat up the leftovers tomorrow.

This was extremely quick and easy.  I made a few modifications, I used one cream of mushroom and one cream of chicken/cream of mushroom soup, fat free cheddar, and added some fresh chopped spinach, and browned some seasoned bread crumbs to sprinkle on top. It was pretty tasty for what it is, and will make it again when I'm crunched for time.

This was a HUGE hit with my family! The only thing I did differently was saute the onions in the pot after I cooked the noodles-otherwise they would not have had time to cook to our liking.  My family keeps asking me when I am going to make this again!!!

A nice tuna casserole. I did add about half a can of skim milk to make it a little 'looser' and also I sauteed the onion with some celery.  Those are the only changes I made.

Great recipe!  I made a few changes.  I sauted the onion with 2 cloves of minced garlic.  Then I put everything except the peas and noodles into the saute pan to heat it up.  I also added 1/2 cup of milk.  Next time I would increase the milk to 1 cup to make it more creamy and less sticky.  I also added crushed Ritz crackers (about 1 cup) mixed with a little bit more than 1 Tbs of melted margarine on top of the casserole.  I cooked it at 350 for 20 minutes.  Turned our terrific.

Great recipe.  However, I used some of the reviewers suggestions to make it my own.  I used 2 cans of tuna vs. 1, 1 can of cream of chicken soup, & 1 can of cream of mushroom soup.  I also used Italian breadcrumbs since I had it readily available.  I seasoned the tuna with black pepper and Old Bay.  Lastly, I thought I'd add broccoli to make it a one dish meal.  Overall, I thought it was a good recipe.

Quick and easy, yes. However, this casserole was extremely bland for my tastes. I followed the recipe up until the end, then transferred to a casserole dish and topped with crushed potato chips. Baked at 350 for 15-20 minutes. This is a good base recipe, but it really needs something else. I think I would sautee some celery and mushrooms with chopped garlic to add some flavor and variety. Also, adding a bit of shredded cheddar would help punch up the American cheese slices. Nothing wrong with the recipe, just not flavorful enough for us. Thanks :)

This was VERY easy to make, cheap, and it makes a lot.  So these days - that equals a great recipe in my book.  I made some adjustments.  Added 1 cup of sour cream.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Very good quick meal.

delicious! we modified it a little to made it healthier: used one can campbells "healthy request" cream of chicken and one can "healthy request" cream of celery. also sauted the onion in olive oil to soften it up before adding it at the end. we used low-fat cheddar rather than processed cheese and added 1 tsp. garlic powder and lots of salt and pepper for flavor. topped it with more low fat cheese and bread crumbs and baked at 350 for 15 minutes. my family gobbled it up. will make again!

SOOOOO good!  I had to change a few things just because of what I had on hand.  I added about a cup of milk, used one can of peas, about 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, added a bit of pepper, salt and onion salt and topped it with some crushed saltines mixed with melted butter. I baked ita bout 20 min at 350 and it was perfect.  We will make this again for sure!!

Just a note: this makes MORE than enough to feed 6-8 people.

Tuna casserole is easy to make. I used macaroni and green beans instead of noodles and peas because that's what I had. I used about 1/2 cup cubed Velveeta and 1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar. I left out the onions but added a few french fried onions and added some more for a little crunch on top. I added a can of extra mushrooms, a little milk and a little butter and a bit of garlic salt. One can of soup seemed like plenty with the milk, butter and cheeses. Not anything you'd want to order in a restaurant. It's just tasty and satisfying home cookin' family comfort food. All beginner cooks should learn to make the quintessential tuna casserole.

The best tuna casserole I have had.  I did make a couple of minor changes: I added 1 cup of milk, and I baked it at 350 degrees for 20 min., then added a can of french fried onions and baked 5 more minutes.  Delicious!

I made this for supper last night and wasn't sure how it would go over.  My usually picky 7 year old *loved* it.  I think it was the first time ever that he was done eating before us.  He had more for a bedtime snack, and he asked me to send it in his lunch today!  My partner and I thought it was good.  Better than tuna helper for sure, and an easy, quick meal with ingredients I usually have on hand.

I used someone else's suggestion and put it in a greased casserole dish, topped with cracker crumbs/melted butter and popped it in the oven for 20 minutes at 350.  I also sauteed the onions while the noodles cooked.

Pretty good, but a little bland.  Of course, like most of the reviews, I tweaked a little based on what I had on hand; I used shells rather then egg noodles and shredded colby jack rather then American cheese, and I also sprinkled in a little Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning (basically an Italian mix).  It definitely needs a little something crunchy with it, and some more seasoning of some kind-- maybe a little more salt or garlic powder.  A great base to start with though!

ETA: 2nd try was much better.  I used some Velveeta in it this time as I was out of 'real' cheese.  I also added a sprinkle of crushed crackers to the top for the last 5minutes of baking and finally got the texture it needed.

Great for a really easy and fast meal. I microwaved the chopped onions (1/2 as earlier suggested) in a few drops of water before adding them. I think they would have not cooked otherwise. I also used shredded cheddar cheese instead of American.

I give this five stars for a quick easy dish when you don't really feel like cooking!   I especially like the one pot, top of the stove cooking and being able to give my oven a rest!  Thanks!

This really was one of the easiest meals to make ever.  I like that it uses staple ingreedients that I normally have on hand at the house.  And it's tasty, we had leftovers for lunch today too, great reheated!  Will make again.

I loved this!  Not because it's great food, but because I can make this soooo fast and my kids like it.  I added 1/2 cup milk and used shredded cheese instead of processed.  I'll definitely make this one again when time is short...Thanks.

I liked it.

I modified it a bit. I mixed in shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and used a baking pan.
I put the mix in the pan, placed the sliced cheese on top and then the next layer of mix.
I topped it off with sliced cheese and a little bit of shredded cheese.

This was ok, very bland. I had to add some corn as I didn't have enough peas, and I used shredded cheddar instead of cheese slices. I think it needs some garlic or something, to add some flavour. I added more cheese to my leftovers the next day, and that was definitely better. I made this in the pot the day before and put it in a casserole dish covered with with French Fried onions, baking it the next day for dinner. Probably wouldn't make again, unless really in a crunch

I substituted 1 1/2 cups sharp cheddar cheese for the american cheese slices, sprinkled some extra cheese on top and baked for 10 minutes.  I am not a tuna casserole lover, but this was excellent!

For as quick and easy as this is, it was pretty good!  I made the following changes: halved the recipe, cooked the onion in olive oil, added about a 1/4 cup of milk, used reduced sodium/fat soup and used a frozen peas & carrots mix for added color.  The best part was not having to turn on the oven!

This is quick and easy! I used leftover flaked grilled tuna, an 8-oz. package of egg noodles, a (10-oz.)package of frozen peas and an 8-ounce pkg. of shredded Cheddar cheese instead of the cheese slices.  This is a "hearty" casserole

THIS TASTED JUST LIKE A TUNA CASSEROLE YOU WOULD BAKE BUT ALOT QUICKER. I TRY GO LOWER IN FAT WHEN I COOK SO USED LOW FAT CREAM OF MUSHROOM SOUP. THIS WAS SO TASTY I HAD LEFTOVERS FOR LUNCH THE NEXT DAY.

Nice, quick recipe that doesn't taste like it just took a few minutes to throw together. Like other reviewers suggested, next time I will heat the tuna/soup/cheese mixture together so it blends better. Great recipe!

Great dish for the weekday.  I enjoyed how quickly this was "whipped-up."  I made my own variation by adding sautéd onions, zuccini,yellow squash, and frozen peas to the mushroom soup mixture.  I had left over grated mexican cheeses so I dumped that in there too, and it was "hearty".  If you want a quick and inexpensive meal for a whole family this is it.

I  used Reames Frozen Egg Noodles and also added 1/2 cup of milk.  I also used a package of Medium Cheddar Cheese rather than the American slices.  When ready, I crunched up some Kettle Cooked Potato Chips on top and served.  Very good recipe.

FYI...NOODLES WILL CONTINUE TO DRAW MOISTURE FROM THE REST.  ADD 1 (ONE) CUP OF MILK TO KEEP THE CASSEROLE CREAMY AND NOT DRY.  ADD MORE VEGGIES!

This casserole is great. I am a hungry, full-time student, and to have a delicious, simple-ingredient meal is a fantastic alternative to having toast for supper. I've made it in a casserole dish, and I've also doubled the recipe for a crockpot. Thank you for the recipe; I am definitely having it again.

Bland. Onions uncooked is rough. No flavor. Way too many peas. American cheese? I always follow a recipe as stated the first time then go from there. Not very good unfortunately.

This was just ok.... I think if I make this again I will use less cheese and add one or two minced garlic cloves to add flavor. Also, something I used to love as a kid.... when my mom made tuna casserole she would always top it with crushed potato chips which gives it the perfect little bit of a salty crunch!

gross.  Made exactly as the recipe recommended and can't understand for the life of me how anyone could actually like this.  Bland, gelatinous and just yucky.  Threw it all out and ordered pizza.

I made some additions of milk, garlic powder, sea salt, and sour cream. Delicious! I also sauteed the onion in olive oil while the pasta and peas drained. I added the soup, tuna, milk, cheese and seasonings to the onions. I added the  pasta (bowties) and peas to the mixture. After a good stir, I added sour cream. Fantastic!

Well, it's complicated.  Yes, I liked it, but, never, ever again with those frozen peas!!  Had I had a brain in my head, I would've substituted a can of drained vegall, or a bag of frozen veggies. I would'e also reduced the recipe by at lease half.  Other than that, it was very good, and yes, I'll make it again, without all those peas.

I halved the recipe for my daughters & I.  Left out the peas since they're not crazy about them.  (If I made this for myself I'd keep the peas in) Added milk throughout the cooking, about a total of 3/4 cup, to keep it from being too thick.  Also added some garlic powder & italian seasoning.  We loved it!  Will definitely make again.

I've been making this for years - my children grew up on it and as adults occasionally ask for it.  The only change I make is I don't use processed cheese - I make a sauce out of the mushroom soup, grated cheddar cheese, and a little bit of milk.  Sometimes I put mushrooms or chopped green or red pepper in it.  An easy, solid recipe.

I agree the onions should be sauteed first or they'll be almost raw; you might substitute dried minced onion flakes. The main problem is that this recipe is  too dry--add one soup can of milk to the two cans of mushroom soup and it's much better. Also, our family likes it with a few dashes of curry powder stirred in before baking--it adds a nice little flavor.

I've made this twice already. Its very very good. I have two second graders and they love it. So easy and you can add almost any vegetable you like. I use rotini vegetable noodles also. I will neverr buy tuna helper from the box again. This tastes better. I'm a skeptic and i always read reviews before i trt anything and I'm a consumer reports subscriber. This is the first review I've left on any food recipe I've found online.

This recipe is awesome! I didn't have any egg noodles so I used macaroni instead also I scaled down the calorie content by making my own cream of chicken soup. I only made one serving because my family does not care for dishes like this. I think it is great because it taste like tuna helper without the box. I hate buying meals in boxes like that anyway.

Basically.... this is a good recipe.  Subtracted the peas and added broccoli.  Added 1/2 can milk. Added 1/4 tsp powdered mustard.  Subtracted American cheese slices.  After combining all ingredients, I turned into a 9 x 13 in casserole dish and sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top... Also added potato chips (actually would not use again).  I poured @2 cups chicken broth over.  Baked at 350 for @ 15 min.  Result... Delicious!

The pasta tends to get sticky, so I added 2 cans of tuna and one can of mushroom soup. I also added one cup of milk to moisten. More milk may be needed when reheating. Vaughn loved it.

Yummy, fast, and cheap! Next time I will sauté the onions before adding to the mix, they were pretty crunchy. I also added a cup of Greek yogurt for additional creaminess as well as fresh green beans instead of frozen peas.

Delicious, I would either use a small onion, or half of a large. Top with Panko Flakes for extra pleasant crunch!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. Just as other mentioned, we modified ours some, mainly so it wouldn't be dry, and so it would be flavorful. I did 2 cans of cream of mushroom, and 1 can of cream of broccoli. I sautéed mushrooms & opinions, and added those to the mixture before baking. I also added 1 additional can of tuna, to make it meatier. Last modification was adding milk (per another review), to give it a creamy texture. All in all, it was Great! I will definitely be making it again.

I do like this recipe but I did tweek it a bit. I used 4 1/2 c shell noodles (I didn't have egg noodles at home). Instead of cheese slices and 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup I used a can of cream of cheddar soup and one of cream of chicken. I also used 2 cups mixed veggies because we don't keep peas at home--no one in my family likes them. And the final adjustment I used dried onions instead of normal onion because Im not an onion fan,  about 1/8 c. Turned out pretty good! Will make again! :)

Wow! Needed something for work for the potluck. I work for the Postal Service and these guys can be picky. Needless to say this dish was the hero of the day. It out did all of their sandwiches and hotdogs and hamburgers. Plus this one pot fed around 17 guys! Thanks Jennie!!!

I made this recipe and LOVED it. So easy and absolutely delicious. "5 servings" is very generous, be prepared to have a lot of leftovers! But in this case, it's not a bad thing.

This really hit the spot. I did sautee the onions like others have suggested.
(Edit)
This time, I made it without sauteeing the onions (except half-recipe, which is plenty) and it was really good. 
Sriracha works well as a topping, as well.

Nice recipe as most of us have the ingredients on hand, or if you don't have noodles use macaroni, no cream of mushroom soup?.. you can use celery or chicken, if you dont have frozen peas you can use drained canned peas or leave them out, no American processed cheese substitute shredded cheddar or omit, no fresh onion use dried minced or powdered onion.

I used half a bag of egg noodles, 1 can of low sodium cream of mushroom, 1 can very low sodium albacore tuna, 1 cup frozen peas, sauteed 1/4 of a white onion, 1 cup of shredded cheddar and three tablespoons of non fat sour cream.  Put it in the oven for 15 minutes at 350.  I put it in a 2 quart dish and it was about 3 to 4 servings.  It came out wondeful.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you!!

Great basic recipe but needs a bit more flavor.  I used 3 cans of tuna  and cut the peas in half and substituted broccoli and mushrooms.  Tastes great just a bit bland. sauteed my veggies too and they were perfect.

I never made a tuna casserole because the thought of eating warm, canned, tuna fish, with pasta, just didn't appeal to me. I finally decided to try it because I had 2 cans of tuna fish that were taking up pantry space for way too long! To my surprise, I loved it! I did make some changes for personal preference. I added 1 tsp. liquid smoke and 2 large cloves of crushed garlic. I love the slight smokey flavor with the tuna. I sauteed the onions and garlic in 1 Tbls of butter. I also used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom. I will definitely make this again! Thanks for helping me overcome my tuna casserole fear!

Made this for dinner last night for husband and son and they absolutely loved it. Love that all ingredients are what you have on hand. Very simple and cheap. Kept everything in the pot didn't need to put in oven. One review said they sauté the onions so I did the same. Will be making it again:) Thanx for sharing.

I choose this recipe because it wasn't baked, it is 90 degrees here, don't really need to heat things up more. Kids liked it ok, not too much different than the tuna casserole I'm used to. I used wagon wheel shaped pasta and only one can of cream of mushroom soup. Not bad!

Great recipe that's easy to make.  I only used 5 slices of cheese and sauted the onions.  My 2 year loved it!!  I agree with previous reviewer, no more tuna helper for us.

I was really surprised at how well this turned out with as simple as it is to make.  I made it exactly as described to try it out first, and it was fine.  Then I went ahead and added a little sour cream and garlic, then topped with some grated sharp cheddar cheese and fried onions.

I was looking for a quick tuna recipe because I couldn't make tuna cakes.  After looking in the cupboard I had to make a few substitutes to this recipe, especially since this was only going to be for 2. I used 1 can of tuna, 3 light mozz cheese sticks, and mac-n-cheese noodles.  I seasoned well with an all spice I had, added some more garlic, and added 1.5T of butter.  It turned out very well and the hubby liked it too!

My adult daughter is the fussiest eater we have ever known and she LOVES this!  The changes I made were:  Used flavored crackers to add a mild flavor that is very good (buy them at Costco) AND more importantly I added about a cup of sour cream.  It tastes wonderful and the consistency turns out wonderful.  LOVE IT!

This was my first tuna casserole and it was very easy to make. My changes: I used an 8 oz. package of egg noodles, 1 1/2 - 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese, garlic salt, and 1 1/2 cans of cream of mushroom soup. Also, I used a 1/4 of an onion (hubby doesn't like them), and 2 cloves of diced garlic. I cooked the onion and garlic in oil before adding to the mix.   Overall, this was very good. Next time I might use less tuna.

Like previous ratings, my husband ate a whole plate full and wanted the leftovers for his lunch the next day.  I used 3/4 cup sour cream and a couple extra slices of processed cheese along with 1/4 of a block of colby/jack cheese.  i also added a tsp of garlic powder and a pinch of salt.  I placed it in greased baking dish and topped with plain progresso bread crumbs (mixed with 1 tbs butter to make the crumbs)  placed in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes.  LOVED it, this will be added to our dinner rotation!

It is what it is titled, quick and easy. It was fine, nothing outstanding. Next time I'll saute the onions a little also. I make my own white sauce so I don't have to use the canned soup. Thanks for the quick meal recipe with a simple ingredient list.

Needed a quick and easy meal.  Had to substitute based on what I had.  Used green onions instead of yellow onion, sharp cheddar instead of american, cream of chicken instead of mushroom, and solid white albacore.  Also added a little milk.  Still turned out tasty.  I will make again in some form or another.

Based on some of the reviews I thought this recipe would be great - I gave it only 3 stars.  I have to admit it was quick and easy, though.  I took the advice of some of the readers and added 1/4 c milk, 1/2 c sour cream, sauted the onions in olive oil before adding, 5 cheese slices and 1/4 block of colby jack.  After mixing it all, I transferred to a casserole dish, mixed bread crumbs (fresh) and butter together to make a crunchy topping and baked for about 20min in a 350 oven.  The kids ate their entire servings, so they liked it, but there were no raving reviews from my family.

We didn't hate it but we didn't love it either. Makes a lot, I'd suggest cutting the recipe in half for a family of four. Tasted like something I would've really enjoyed in college (since I subsisted on Ramen and Hamburger helper then).

This is fantastic my husband and I loved it. I have made it twice now, both time using about the same modifications: 1 can cheddar sour, 1/2 can cream of mushroom, 3/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 to 1/2 cup milk, three slices of cheese, two cans tuna, 1 onion cooked in butter to soften, garlic powder and crushed crackers on top with some cheese and cooked in the oven for about 10 minutes at 400. I didnt add peas as I dont care for them, however second helpings were a must!!

Very easy & delicious! I used what I had on hand ~ elbow mac, 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can tuna, 1/2 can peas, 1 big handful shredded sharp cheddar on top, 3/4 cup milk, salt & pepper. Put it in an 8x8 dish and baked in 350 oven for about 40 minutes. Excellent and super easy!

Delish! The only change I made is to undercook the noodles and put the peas in completely frozen. I put the whole thing in the oven so the top got brown and crispy. Just a personal preference.

I had to modify the recipe a little due to what I did/didn't have on hand so instead of egg noodles I used macaroni noodles and I had to use one can of cream of celery soup and one cream of mushroom soup, almost a full block of velveeta chopped up (small block) and I sauteed the onions.  I added some shredded cheddar on top along with a little bit of breadcrumbs and broiled it until brown.

The only thing I'd do differently next time is to add about a cup of celery to the onions when sauteeing them just to give it that much needed crunch.

But, my 10 y.o. said this is now his third favorite dish so we'll keep it around as an easy version of tuna casserole.

Extremely easy to make. The cheese turned out crunchy by accident the first time I made it and it was yummy! Grate cheese instead of shred and make a relatively thin layer. It should come our crispy. =)

I have been making a version of this for years. To make it faster I use mac n cheese.I cook the onions in a little butter first, then mix everything together. You can top with french fried onions and bake until the top is a little crunchy for a special treat.Everyone will think you worked really hard...

I gave it 4 * as I changed it up a bit to add more flavour and moistness.  I added 1/2 can of milk; mixed the frozen peas in (the flavour of the frozen peas mixes with the mushroom soup as it cooks); can of drained mushrooms; 1/2 tsp of dry mustard; 1 can of French's onions to the top (instead of 1 chopped onion). No cheese. My family loved it!

Very good for a quick and easy tuna casserole. Doesn't have the crispy topping of a baked casserole, but much quicker and much less clean up. I thought it was very thick and added 1/3 cup milk at the end to make it a little creamier. I also added an extra can of tuna and 5 slices American cheese and 1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar just based on my personal preference. Very good meal for when you want something quick and easy!

This is so good!  I halved the recipe and added celery, carrots and onions (because I'm not a fan of peas).  I used one can of tuna, one can of cream of mushroom, about half a bag of shredded colby jack cheese, plus a dash of italian seasoning.  It really IS quick and easy...start to finish in maybe 20 minutes.  Next time I'll add another can of tuna, but other than that, this is great!

Thought this was pretty good! The second time we had this I made a few changes and we liked it even more. I added mushrooms, more tuna (about 2 more cans) and used Velveeta instead of the slices. We will definitely be having this many more times to come!

My husband does not like tuna OR peas, so whenever he goes out of town on business, I make something using both, for my kids and I.  I was very pleased with this recipe!  Pretty simple to put together and I LOVED the fact that it was done quickly and with a stockpot instead of a casserole dish in the oven.  (Living in Oklahoma, I look for dishes I can make on the stovetop in the summertime, instead of using the oven.)  Because I wanted it to be kid-friendly, I only used 2 T. of finely chopped onion.  (I threw the rest of the onion I chopped up in the freezer for another day.)  I only used 5 slices of American, but then grated in the better half of a block of cheddar.  I added one can of milk.  I also used 2 C. mixed vegetables and could have used more!  I topped it (right in the pot) with a mixture of a tad melted margarine and half a sleeve of crushed Ritz crackers.  My 3 year old daughter unfortunately, is being difficult and won't taste it, but we'll see if I can get her to later tonight.  My 10 month old son loved it!  (I have been introducing more mashed table foods recently.)  I did add generous pepper and a bit of salt to my own dish, but liked this so much I may even try and get the husband to eat it!  I'm now trying to decide what perfect dessert I want to make to follow it.  I'm thinking Coconut Custard Pie or Brownies!

This is a solid quick meal to make.  I only used a 1/4 onion and used cheddar cheese instead.  I've made this a few times already and the last time I cooked it, I threw it in the oven to finish it off with a light layer of cheese on top for a crispy finish.

Overall, we really enjoyed this casserole. As suggested by other reviewers, I added some milk and used shredded sharp cheddar in lieu of the American.Baked for about 10 mins. The consistancy of the casserole was perfect. Nice and creamy. My only complaint... the onion flavor was a bit overpowering for me (not a big onion fan anyway). Would make again....minus the onion or maybe use half of a sweet onion.Thanks for the recipe!

Little bland, but good.  Classic.  I had a small jar of pimento that I added.  Water chestnut, sliced, is good also for a little crunch.  Made in 2 pans and froze one.  Reheated a month later and tasted just as good.

I thought the flavor was just ok. While the pasta was boiling I sauteed the onions a little, but they were still crunchy after I mixed them in. After combining all the ingedients, the mixture was a bit "gooey" so I added 1/4 cup of milk which made it a little creamier.  I wouldn't make this again.

Because there's only 2 of us, I halved the noodles and dropped 1 can of soup, but kept the 2 cans of tuna.  Used mild cheddar for the cheese, and added a few tablespoons of milk.  Overall very simple.  Mental note, though ... if you're using an onion, make sure it's mild, or sautee it briefly.

This is so quick and easy it's almost embarrasing!  I used a can of Green Giant Summer Sweet Peas and I was in heaven.  I gave to recipe to my 20 yr old brother to try out someday and he just raved.  What a time saver compared to the traditional casserole!!  Thanks!

This was an okay tuna casserole, but not great.  I think next time I'll try using shredded cheddar instead of the american cheese, it just tasted kinda funny, and not really cheesy at all.

I love this recipe, it's wonderfully versatile, quick, tasty, and satisfying!  I make it for myself using a can of cream of broccoli or broccoli and cheese soup with broccoli florets and peas.  Mmm, whatever your taste is I'm sure you could alter this to suit yours.

I made this because I had most of the ingredients at home. When I read the recipe I realized that the onions would not be cooked if I put them in the pot last for 2 minutes, so I used the ingredients of this recipe as a base for what I made.

I did the following while the egg noodles were boiling:
I chopped some garlic and onions and put them in a sauce pan with butter. I cooked those until the onions were translucent and then added 2 cups of frozen peas. I let that cook until all of the peas were warm. Next, I added to the mixture 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of celery (its what I had in my cabinet), and following that the cheese. I let this cook until all the cheese was melted. I then added the tuna and mixed it in.
When the noodles were cooked, I drained them and added the mixture to them. I stirred the mixture and served hot. It was very good this way, and will serve as 2 nights of meals for my husband and I.

First, I’m very much a novice at cooking, or usually anything that has to do with the kitchen (excluding refrigerator and microwave).  I love reading the “Easy” recipes.   Even then I set up the kitchen in advance of starting the process.  Looks like an operating room.  But I digress.  Immediately following the recipe I race to the reviews to get others ideas.   Fascinating.  I disagree that amending, adding, etc. to these wonderful recipes is derogatory to the original.  I feel it is the highest of compliments to “build” on another’s’  great ideas or recipes.  I blended this recipe with the “Easy Tuna Casserole “.  Nothing like “Two Easys “.  
I think that’s what is wonderful about cooking...the tweaking.   Don’t mean to preach...oh, and everyone loved it.   Apparently I still have issues with quantity.   Ended up making two casseroles.   Young couple next door loved it.  ??

Super easy to make. I used cream of chicken and mushroom which I purchased on accident. Still tasty. I will probably add some milk when I reheat the leftovers. It could also use a bit of salt and pepper.

I made half this recipe for lunch today but used canned chicken because I discovered I didn't have tuna.  Then I used cream of chicken soup because I was using chicken.  I think the amount of noodle may be slightly too much and it could use more meat maybe double that in the recipe.  It was easy to make and I'll probably make it again for a quick lunch but increase the meat and use just slightly fewer noodles.  Thanks for a quick lunch.

I combined this recipe and another recipe together. I added peas to give more vegetables and I used Swiss cheese instead of American cheese. It came out well.

Not sure what exactly happened and why we didn't like, as we all like the individual ingredients.  Something just didn't work for our family.  Really too bad, since it was a very easy and affordable recipe!

I made this recipe with some modification. I used broccoli florets instead of peas, and also cream of broccoli soup and cream of chicken soup. The dish was a little bland so next time I will add some seasonings to it besides the pepper.

Made this last night. Shared with two different neighbors since it makes enough for a large family. Both enjoyed it and one even asked for the recipe. Very easy to make and very tasty.

I give this a 4 star because it is Fast, Easy, Cheap, and Tasty!

I cut ingredients in half, perfect for 2people, didn't use onion and used Mexican shredded cheese in mixture and sprinkled on top. It took under 20 min. and maybe cost $2.00

It is Quick, Fast, and in the Oven under 25 minutes of prep. I’m a traditionalist therefore I have a Bag of Potato chips that are crumbled on top during the last 5 to 8 minutes of bake time.

Excellent! I added some pan-fried pancetta bits to the mix and it was great.  Simple, easier than I thought.  I also mixed all of the sauce ahead of time and folded it in after, so you can make the bulk of it ahead of time.

This was really good! I did make a couple changes though. I added the onions to the boiling water so they weren't crunchy, and I also added leftover frozen corn I wanted to get rid of to the boiling water. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it's yummy! I will be making this again!

I did not like it with raw onions, but they are not my favourite.  Next time, I will make it without them.  Maybe I will add some onion powder or saute some onions.

I made a few modifications to this recipe which I feel turned out great! I used about 2 cups egg noodles and 1 cup frozen peas, prepared as directed in original recipe. I sautéed my onion in about 1T. butter until translucent (5 min) before adding cream soup, 1/2 soup can of milk and 1 cup shredded cheddar (in place of American cheese slices), 1/2 t. garlic salt, 1/4 t. black pepper and tuna. I then stirred in  the drained noodles and peas until heated through. I topped with an additional handful of shredded cheddar before serving.

Really yummy & INCREDIBLY QUICK to make !! I didn't have peas to add - would probably be a great addition. I don't like how the cream of mush made it a bit mushy but still tastes nice. Next time I wanna bake as a casserole! I'd Definitely make again!

The only extra things I added were a half cup of milk and 2 cloves of fresh garlic.  I love how the uncooked onions gives this an extra crunch!

I made this without onion because my other doesn’t like them and used ziti noodles, yet it was an instant favorite among my household! Pair the simplicity of the dish with the combination of several different flavors and textures has made me a celebrity chef in my family. I think the best part is the flexibility with ingredients like differently shaped noodles or different vegetables because I’m a mad scientist in the kitchen. In conclusion, I wrote a long paragraph instead of being concise and to the point, but this recipe deserved it. Magnifique!

It was an "okay" dish. Nothing earth shattering, but okay.

I replaced the peas with frozen broccoli florets and it added more substance to it.

I  used left over salmon that I had, instead of tuna. I also incorporated shredded co-jack cheese instead of american cheese. Oh boy, it was a great way to use left over salmon and added some extra spice, to "flavor it up"!

Super easy!  I cooked onions and celery on the stove first in a little butter mixed with evoo.   I didn't put mine in the oven with bread crumb topping.  I like it just the way it is

I like the easiness of this recipe and I had all the ingredients in the pantry, but I agreed with the one reviewer that it was too thick, so I did not have milk and I like half and half better anyway because there is more flavor, garlic, bread crumbs on top, but I only use Progresso Italian breadcrumbs because they definitely have more flavor because there are spices in it.  I did put enough to cover the top with the leftover cheese, bread crumbs and butter.  I also only use fresh ground pepper now and added more on the top and fresh parsley on top from my garden.  Fantastic!

Amazing recipe! I tweaked it a bit in a few areas.. I made it as directed except instead of making it on just on the stove, I decided to pour the pot into a 13x9 to bake it for 25 minutes. Before baking it, instead of bread crumbs & processed cheese on top, I substituted the bread crumbs for pork shake & bake which gave it a little spice & instead of processed cheese, I mixed 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese in the mixture & then added 6 thin slices of real sliced cheese on top & like I said, baked it (-:  It turned out delicious!!! Of I almost forgot...I forgot to add the white onions to the stovetop cooking step so instead cut up 3 scallions & put them on the side for anyone who wanted  to garnish the dish with them. We all added the scallions & Im already being asked to make this again asap. Very good stuff!

This was just ok; a lot bland and I even tried to "dr." it up. Sautéed mushrooms, salt, granulated garlic and a topping of Parmesan cheese helped.  Then we scooped it with wheat saltines which gave it the crunch it needed.  I used 2 cups of shredded Colby jack instead of processed cheese slices.  I also added one soupcan of milk to make it creamy.  After all my "tweaks" it was tasty, but not real inspiring - but then it's just tuna casserole, so there you go.

I used canned chicken instead of tuna (my husband doesn't like tuna). I also used Colby jack instead of processed American, because.. Processed. I also added about a cup of milk because it was too dry otherwise. It still came out mediocre at best. I'm glad I tried it, but I definitely won't be making it again.

This recipe was a very big hit.  But instead of using canned tuna I used fresh, simmered lightly in water and onion until just done and added to the recipe.   I will make it up about an hour or two ahead of dinner time  and then just pop into a 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes or until warmed.   I use this recipe often and it's always a crowd pleaser.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Will definitely make this again, but only gave it a 3 because I made a number of changes - the onions needed pre-softening + I used grated not processed cheese and a 1/4 cup of cream cheese + I just couldn't bear to serve it without baking (I had some time). Baked for about 20 min with some shredded cheese and bread crumbs on top. With those changes it was delish. Even my 7 year old uber picky eater loved it.

It really is quick and easy.  Great if your short on time/don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. I sautéed the onions in some butter and tossed everything in the pan on med-low heat until warmed and melted. Also, 1 cup of milk makes the sauce creamy.

So easy! I made the mistake of dropping the cheese all in at once and had to stir quite a bit to mix it in since it formed one big lump at first. Still, fast, easy and it tasted just like a tuna noodle casserole should.

Never really liked the idea of tuna casseroles (or fish pies) but I decided to try this, fully expecting to hate it but loved it. Hubby loved it too. Passed it to my sister who  loved it as well. The only thing I will change next time I make it is to add a little chopped red pepper.

I knew from reading the recipe that the onions needed to be sauteed in olive oil first.  There is no way that the onions would be cooked enough with the recipe as it is.  I also used a couple of cups of shredded cheese blend.   It came out good.  This recipe also works well with canned chicken.  Sprinkling some fresh roasted slivered almonds on top gives it some crunchy texture.

I added celery as well as some orange pepper. I also sautéed all the vegetables to the side before adding them. Except for the peas-- those I just added at the end. :) I also baked it for just a bit at the end while waiting for family to arrive so it would keep warm. Super delicious- very homey feeling!

I really liked this. I made it without the onions because we don't care for them. I loved the potato chips, just like mom used to make!! I'd make it again. I used albacore tuna which is preferred at my house.

This was delicious, quick, and easy!  My kids had second and third helpings.  The only change I made was American cheese for the processed cheese.  Thank you for this recipe!

Needed something quick and this recipe caught my eye.  Made it by the book with no changes.  Can't be much simpler and we were eating in a jiffy.  Great comfort food meal.  Had a garden salad on the side.  Will definitely make it again.

A hit with the entire family!  For next time, I think I'll add a 3rd can of tuna and follow the suggestion to add a topping and bake it in the oven a bit.  Don't overcook the noodles or they'll disintegrate while mixing.

Very good and will make all the time now.  Does need milk added or too dry.. also threw in some cream cheese.  Used quality cheese instead of the other.  Cooked onions in butter first  Very pleased I tried this.

It was better when I crushed some crunchy fried onions and Ritz crackers on top and let it broil a few minutes but overall it was an easy way to make a retro favorite.

It was good and my two men loved it.  I used an alternative to sherry because I didn't have it (vermouth) and I thought that that (vermouth) flavor was a bit strong.  For leftovers I added a good brand mushroom soup a a little more tuna and my men had seconds.  Would make it again.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because I think it would be very good as written. I did make a couple changes, though. I used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of celery, and used 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese instead of the american cheese. My family really loved this casserole, and there was enough to freeze for another meal.  This is a recipe that can easily be modified for variety, For example chopped broccoli could be used instead of the peas. Also, different kinds of cheese would also be good, and cream of broccoli cheese soup would be good for one of the soups.

I love this recipe!  Everybody I've ever fed it to loves it too.

Suggested adjustments: 
1. Sauté some peas and corn with olive oil with some minced garlic, the Italian seasoning and the onion before hand. 
2. Don't quite finish cooking the noodles.
3. Add in some half and half in there to make it creamy.
4. Add half a bag of cheddar the mix.
5. Add two TBSP of sweet pickle relish.

After you finish prepping the noodles and vegetables,  throw it in a casserole pan, put a half a bag of cheddar on top of, and let the noodles absorb the sauce into the noodles for 25 minutes at 350 degrees.

If you can let it sit overnight that's best. It comes out in perfect little blocks like lasagne. 

AWESOME!

This was super easy, altho I modified it. Instead of peas, I used raced cauliflower and instead of the big noodles, I used small shells. It was excellent! This recipe is easy, plus it feeds ALOT. For my husband and I, we had 3 dinners each out of it. Next time I will cut it in half as I asm not big on serving leftovers . Very good recipe!

This is not a five-star dish, except if you primarily value speed.
Sometimes a dish is greater than the sum of its parts. In this case, it is simply the sum  of its parts. It is edible, economical, but forgettable. Be sure to saute the onions first.

This is almost identical to the one my mom made except she made hers with a macaroni and cheese mix and added a half a block of shredded cheddar cheese. I used spiral noodles and like moms,I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of American processed. Why mess up a good thing by adding fake yellow cheese?

Add 1/3 cup of milk to make it easier to mix; otherwise, the noodles will tear to pieces while mixing. Next time, I will mix together the soup, milk and cheese, melt it all together, then add the noodles and peas. I was worried about this being "fishy" tasting and smelling, but it wasn't. All of the ingredients blend into a satisfying, comforting meal.

Great easy recipe! The only thing I did different was omit the onions and added garlic instead and I added fresh mushrooms and used half a can of CMS (cream of mush) Even my hubby liked it and he's not a fan of tuna. Keeping on my list for sure!

Cut the recipe in half.  loved the cooking in the pan however at the finish of the stove cooking put it into a casserole dish and put crushed potato chips on the top and baked in an oven until chips were browned. Took  the hint to Sautee onions in olive oil before adding to the pan. Good suggestion.

Boy, you sure didn't change our childhood comfort food at all!  No wonder Americans are obese today if you are still serving this.  Yeah, it tastes OK, but there has to be a healthier way to prepare it!  Processed cheese? Cream of Mushroom soup?  Please try to find a cleaner way to do this!

Quick easy delicious!  I didn't have a lot of time and I wanted my veggies a bit softer so I boiled them (onion and carrots) right in the water with the noodles for 7 minutes then drained and added the cream of mushroom. Everything came out perfectly.

Used all of the ingredients mentioned, seemed bland. Felt like it needed something else. The wife liked it, though.

This was made last minute with things I had on hand. I substituted farfalle noodles and topped with breadcrumbs and French fried onions and baked for a few minutes. Yummy!

I mixed shredded mozzarella with the sauce instead of using cheese slices, and I sprinkled bread crumbs on top before baking. Turned out so great that my family gobbled up the entire dish. I was hoping we'd have leftovers...whoops!

Made this without peas (husband hates peas) and it was alright. The recipe calls for way too much onion, and the way they have it laid out the onion doesn't get cooked, so you eat way too much raw onion in the recipe.

This was very good. I sautéed the onions and I put shredded Parmesan and sharp cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheese slices. Will definitely make again!

We are not big into fish but will do tuna casserole now and then. I loved that I already had all the ingredients (don't we love it when we already have all the ingredients? :-D )
This was nice. I took the advice of Shimmerchk and added some crackers/butter to the top and baked it  at 350 for 20 min. Was going to use the sour cream but ... it had passed over to the other side. Next time.
I wouldn't say that we all went wild for tuna casserole but I was in a major menu rut and it certainly made a nice break . Thanks for making me appear like a total "I'll just whip something up from scratch" Suzy Homemaker to my family.

I made this casserole in a half an hour one busy Tuesday.  It came out great!  I used mixed vegetables instead of peas.  

Next time, I'm going to use shredded cheese instead of cheese slices; they get a little unwieldy when you're stirring.

This is the easiest classic tuna noodle casserole I've made! I did find that it was too thick to stir together as written, so I added about a half cup of pasta water to the final ingredients in the pot, and a dollap of heavy cream. Loosened it up to stir very nicely! I also added some salt to taste. I don't stock American cheese slices, so I threw in about a cup and a half of shredded Mexican cheese. Melted nicely and tasted delish! I wouldn't hesitate to make this with one can cream of mushroom, one of cream of chicken, and a large can of Kirkland canned chicken for a nice change from tuna. Hmmmm that will be my next experiment! For those of you who have to have a topping, pour the casserole into a four quart casserole dish, top with one sleeve of crushed Ritz crackers drizzled with butter on top, and warm in your 350 degree oven for 15 minutes. Yum yum yum!

I took other readers advice and added some milk. I also topped with a mix of bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese and dotted with butter before baking at 350 for 20 minutes.

I made this in a 4 litre dutch oven and added double the cheese , an extra can of soup & a large package of fresh mushrooms  sliced. Also added some cayenne pepper for some zing. It turned out very well & I'll definitely make it again although with the cayenne it's definitely not for the kids !

I also found this is to be bland, and while mixing the ingredients together, I also found it to be very dry, so I added a 1/2 cup of half & half cream, which made this dish a bit creamy. The raw onions did add a nice crunch, and I think I added about a 1/4 cup of diced yellow onion. I also cooked the noodles and frozen peas for exactly 8 minutes. Since the stores no longer make 6-ounce cans of tuna, I think the 2 (5-oz.) cans is just the right amount of tuna. Also, when it came to season the dish, I used Lawry's Seasoned Black Pepper, which is a coarse blend of black pepper, and other spices. This is a good basic recipe to start with, and I have been reading others reviews to see what I can add to make this dish just a bit better. I don't know why the person who submitted this recipe, called this a casserole, as casseroles are baked in the oven, where as dishes made in a pot (or skillet) on top the stove, are called a hot dish, at least I thought so!

This recipe saved my day. My son had been awake all night sick and 3 hours of sleep and making dinner didn't really sound very appealing to me. This was super easy! I did only have one can of soup so I had to add a little bit of milk which worked well. I felt like it was missing something so I added about a fourth cup of mayo which really really topped it off. I used green onions instead of regular and crushed up some butter crackers to put on top with a pickle on the side!! It was marvelous!

I don't eat peas, whatsoever.  I substituted chopped celery and I used 1 can of Cream of Celery soup.  I didn't think the onions would cook in the time allowed in the recipe, therefore I sauted them until they were just soft.  I added the celery to saute about 1/2 way through.  Really easy comfort food.

Super easy comfort food. We have an onion hater so I substituted red bell pepper which added a nice color contrast. I sautéed the pepper while the water was coming to a boil. I suspect it would be better to do this with onion as well.

This was so easy, but a bit bland so after making it as writte, I added some flavor. I didn't have a lot on hand so I just added some extra cheese, salt, garlic powder and a bit of Old Bay. It's a good base recipe and I'll probably play around with it some each time I make it, but this is good for a quick weeknight meal.

Family really enjoyed it. I sautéed a couple T. of minced garlic and added the tuna to it before the rest of the ingredients.  Next time I plan to used canned chicken instead of tuna to see how that works.

I rate this recipe 3 1/2 stars with a potential 4 stars if you add bacon bits.  This was a quick and easy meal to make, which I greatly appreciate but, it tasted like it was missing something.  My husband suggested adding bacon crumbles to it after we ate a bowl.  he went for seconds, tried it with the bacon crumbles and it made all the difference!

This recipe is easy, quick and yummy. I didn't have enough american cheese slices, so i used a little velveeta cheese and I added a splash of whole milk. My husband and 14 month old daughter loved it.

Definitely perfect for the nights you don't want to cook. Only change I recommend is definitely sautéing he onions and only using half of an onion. My 5 year old loved this!

This was good. The first time I made it, I found the onion flavor too strong. The second time I used only 1/2 onion and sauteed it in olive oil before before adding it to the dish, which I felt was better.

This was a great simple recipe, I tweaked it a bit after reading reviews and to accomidate my picky husband. I added another can of tuna and 1/2 cup milk and when it was done I topped it with crushed ruffles chips and put the pot in oven on 450 for 15 min. Was delish and hubby was happy.

It's pretty good but I personally recommend sautéing the onions before adding them to it. Also adding a few more slices of cheese would hurt.

Very simple recipe. Mi would definitely sautéed the onions before adding.  Instead of slice cheese I followed the recipe and after mixing everything I added it into a baking dish along with a generous helping of shredded cheese on too and baked for 5 minutes.  My husband and I both loved this dish.  I also added some garlic powder and paprika.

Used a combination of monterey jack and a couple of other cheeses instead of processed cheese.  Also added about a cup of milk as suggested.

Turned out fantastic! I needed a quick weeknight meal that I could easily substitute ingredients so I didn't have to run to the grocery store. I halved the recipe, didn't have egg noodles, used macaroni noodles, didn't have crm of mushroom so used crm of celery, and didn't have peas so used broccoli. I followed another reviewer's suggestion, added about 1/4 cup of sr. cream, a little milk, and added a little sharp cheddar cheese that I had left over with 4 slices of cheese. I sautéed the onions with garlic, mixed all together, and put it in a casserole dish, topped with itialian breadcrumbs moistened with butter, then baked for about 20 mins at 350 and turned out delicious! Pleasantly surprised and full! Thanks to Shimmerchk for her great suggestions, I think it really upped an okay dish to delicious!

Simple, tasty. I had to pan cook the onion as my husband hates it raw, and I subbed a can of cream of chicken for mushroom, simply because I didn't have two like I thought. I used what was left of a mild cheddar packet. All said, it was quite tasty! Next time I'll try to plan for it instead of just using what I have to see how the base recipe differs, but I do love a forgiving recipe like this one.

I started making this casserole in college and it has become a staple.  I won't say how many years that has been but rest assured it is a lot of years, lol.....
Add anything you have on hand and it will still be great.

Better than expected! It wasn't the greatest meal I've ever had, but it was extremely easy to prepare and really easy on my wallet. My only additions were two cloves of garlic and a few strips of crumbled bacon. After I spread it in a casserole dish I sprinkled seasoned bread crumbs and some grated parmesan cheese on top. I also did pop it in the oven for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees. Overall it turned out really good. :)

This is a GREAT recipe to make with your kids - easy, fun, and tasty.
I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but pretty close (I added milk and butter to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pot and I didn't use as much cheese).  I cannot believe that those basic ingredients taste so good together.  This is on the "make it again" list.  Next time though I will omit the onion.  I think it will be fine with some onion and garlic powder.

Had a craving for tuna casserole and wanted to find an easy one.  Which this was.  I made it exactly as written. Would make again but would add some seasonings and a cup or so of milk to the sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

This one disappears fast! :)  We do make two small changes.  We saute the onions first and we prefer mozzarella cheese.  Quick, easy, and changeable with whatever veggies you like.

GOOD.  I added a stick of butter.  This recipe is a good base, but next time I would use a 1/4 cup of milk and half of the onion.  The onion was overwhelming in this recipe.  I may also try to cook a little longer next time.  I don't think the peas were done.  It seemed to taste better the second day after being warmed in the microwave.

The second time I made it I changed a few things that made it 5 stars for us.  I used 18 oz tuna instead of 12.  Substituted a can of cream of chicken for cream of mushroom and added a little milk, celery salt, and mustard powder.  My husband and I actually liked the crunchy onions that some other commenters did not enjoy!

I loved it! I left out the onions and substituted the american cheese for  shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Yum. I also baked it for 10 minutes at 350 degrees after boiling the peas with the pasta. I used 2 cups of pasta but should have used 3 cups.

I didnt enjoy this recipe.. Maybe it was the cheese? I think velveeta cheese should be used and I used the pre-packaged sliced cheese. It just tasted very bland to me.

Super easy & made an excellent weeknight meal. Per review's suggestion i added garlic. Also crushed wheat ritz w melted butter as topping & browned 350 for 25 minutes. A keeper recipe that'll be too easy to modify. Next i'll try it with chicken breasts.

I made a few adjustments,  I used 1 can of mushroom soup instead of two, sauteed the onion in 1 T of butter, added 1 C. of milk, 8 oz of low fat sour cream, and put in 8 oz of low fat colby monterey cheese instead of the cheese called for.  This was excellent!  I loved it.

I make this all the time now that I have found this recipe.  I do use regular cheddar cheese because I don't keep processed cheese around.

This was very good.  As easy to make as the boxed varieties, but with much more flavor!  I will definitely be making this again, very, very easy and filling.

I really liked this!  I'm a beginner so I stick to fairly simple recipes, and this worked great for me.  I used two hickory flavored tuna packs instead of canned tuna, and I boiled some onion pieces with the noodles (sort of accidentally) so I didn't add any additional onion.  I used four slices of cheddar (which didn't melt, I took the recipe literally but you may have meant continue to heat after mixing in the other ingredients) and I grated about 1/2 cup of Monterey Jack.  I didn't use peas because I didn't have any and don't really care for them anyway.    It was delicious!  Best tuna casserole I've ever had!  Thank you so much for sharing this.

Tuna casserole is one of my favorite comfort food dishes.  This is a great recipe, and easy to tweak to personal preferences.  I sauteed the onions with some chopped up mushrooms to the point where the onions and mushrooms were tender but not too soft (I like a little bit of crunch in my tuna casserole).  I used shredded mild cheddar.  I think next time I'll go with sharp.  Very tasty, very comforting.

Very good, quick and easy dish. I added about 3/4 c milk (dry without it) and used frozen broccoli cuts instead of peas. Topped it with french fried onions and baked it in the oven for 5 mins. Plenty of leftovers!

Overall, this was quick and tasty.  I would use some milk next time as it is pretty sticky and "gunky".  A baked tuna casserole comes out prettier, but you can't beat this for ease and speed of preparation.

I have made this twice now, and a little different each time.  This recipe is a good starter to adjust to your own taste.  I especially like how quick it is because I am not very good at planning ahead for dinner!

Great recipe!  Obviously everyone will change seasonings and such to make this meal something your family will eat.  Changes that worked for our family were: saute onions before adding mix soups (mushroom and celery), onions, mixed veggies and seasonings(garlic powder and pepper) together add 1/2 cup milk to the soup mixture before adding the noodles. add shredded sharp cheddar cheese and mix together Put in a casserole dish and cover with sharp cheddar cheese bake until bubbly top with cubbled butter crackers before serving I added the butter crackers right to everyone's dish so that they would be nice and crunchy.

Fantastic. Didn't have noodles so I used elbow macaroni.  Sauteed onion and a little minced garlic. Added milk, a little sour cream and about 5 slices of crumbled bacon and Celery salt.  Topped with buttered corn flake crumbs mixed with Parmesan cheese.  Baked at 350º for 20 minutes to brown topping.

This was defenitely very easy to make and the taste was great...I did however make a "lowfat" version (minus the cheese) and that was great! I also took other reviewers advice and added garlic powder, seasoning salt, onion powder and even some oragano...i'm big on seasonings, but don't forget this was minus the cheese! enjoy!

I was very impressed of how tasty this was considering how easy it was.  As others also suggested, I added about 1 cup of milk for a creamier consistency.  It was too thick without it.  I also sauteed the onions with butter and garlic salt prior to adding it to the soup mixture.  Enjoy!

I decided to try making a tuna noodle casserole different.  Well guess I had better stick to my way of making it..we didn't like the peas or the cheese in it. I don't know just too many flavors.

This was very good.  I boiled the onion with the noodles to try to keep them from being crunchy.  It worked somewhat, but next time I will take another reader's suggestion and just saute the onions separately.  I added a cup of milk as another reader suggested, and I added more cheese as personal preference.

I followed some other reviewers advice and halved the recipe. I used some cheese slices as well as some shredded cheese and sauteed the onion with a bit of garlic. The end product came out fairly bland, so I added italian seasoning, some italian bread crumbs (in it and on top), as well as some garlic salt. I think tomorrow this will be more tasty. Also, I think you've got to have one can of cream of celery soup (with the cream of mushroom) to make the taste just right. Will make again, just tweaked. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't put onion in it, used 1 cup of shredded cheese instead of the American processed cheese (which I sprinkled on top) and I did use the garlic powder and breadcrumbs on top.  My family really liked (and so did I.)  A great meal that I can put together in the morning and have the babysitter put in the oven to be ready when I get home.

I made this because my boyfriend said he'd never had it before.  He loved it - he took two huge servings of it :)  It was so quick - I left work at six and had dinner ready by seven (I love this method because baking is not required).  My only modifications were to use canned peas (they were cheaper) and one can of cream of celery soup and one cream of chicken (I hate mushrooms).  I think next time I will try it with a can of mixed veggies or cheddar cheese rather than American. This recipe is great as it is, but there is a lot you could do to personalize it and fit your taste.  The best thing about this recipe is that it makes a ton - and ALL the ingredients only cost me $6.75.  Wow!

My family and I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I always like to experiment with recipes so I add italian seasoning, a little crushed red pepper and garlic powder.  I also used grated colby jack cheese instead of the sliced cheese and it was wonderful.  Very easy and pretty quick to make too!

This tasted really good and it took only minutes to make!  I used fat free products and it still had a lot of flavor.  The servings were also very large.

This is the best tuna casserole I have had!  My husband said "you better rate this the highest." I didn't have an onion so I omitted it and I used half a block of velvetta cheese.  It was good with a splash of red pepper and french onions on the top. Note: No need to bake as some reviewers have.

I thought this was really great comfort food. I made a few small changes, (sauted the onions, cheddar cheese instead of american slices, some garlic powder and sour cream and milk) but I think what made it the best was putting it all in a casserole dish with buttered breadcrumbs on top and baking it for 20 minutes. Yum!

I made this for my husband when we first got together over 3 years ago, he loved it Tuna Casserole is his favorite. The only thing he likes diffrent is two cans of peas, he loves them. He also said there was no need to add cheese or onions that it still tasted the same. I think this recipe tasted even better.

If for nothing else but the sheer ease of this recipe, I give it five stars. It's an added bonus that it actually tastes good! I used frozen mixed veggies instead of peas and it was lovely. This took less time than tuna helper!

Easy and excellent.  Added sauteed onions and zucchini as well as 1/3 cup of milk and used unprocessed shredded cheddar with bread crumbs on top.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

Very good, fast and easy. All the ingredients were already in my kitchen.  I made a few minor changes.  After draining the noodles and peas, I melted a little butter in the pan and sauteed the onions.  And after everything was mixed together I sprinkled shredded cheese and bread crumbs on top and broiled until crispy.

This recipe was so great--quick and easy.  I did modify it a bit by combining it with mac and cheese for an even cheesier taste and it was great.  I also put it in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes to warm everything up and to brown the top.  My husband loved this meal and so did I.

It's definately a keeper. But to make it a little healthier, I replaced one of the cream of mushroom soups with 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup and used fat free american cheese slices. Still tasted great! I also added a cup of white mushrooms 1/2 cup of fat free milk.

I modified this recipe. I added 1/2cup milk and sauted the onions with some garlic. It made it a lot more creamy and not such a potent taste of onions.

This was a good recipe. I modified it a little by adding 1 can cream of celery soup and an extra can of cream of mushroom soup.  I'm not a peas/carrots person, so I only put in 1 cup.  It was real tastee and something different!! I will definitely make this again!!

This recipe was very tasteful.  My fiancee really liked it.  I made a few changes by sauteeing my onions and mushrooms and adding a bit of milk so that it wouldn't be so rich.  I added one can of tuna and one can of salmon, sprinkled garlic salt and cheddar cheese on top and put it in oven.  It turned out great. Thanks for the recipe.

This was pretty good. I made it just for myself, because my boyfriend won't get near tuna. When I ate it, it reminded me of something my mom would have thrown together for us kids when I was little. My friend came over later that night and was hungry. I told her to help herself. Initially she looked worried about eating it, but once she had a bite, she kept saying how surprised she was that it was really good! 

I used cheddar cheese, and I did sprinkle cracker crumbs on top of it as other reviewers suggested.

This was incredibly easy and tasty and makes a big ol' pot of this stuff! I cut the cheese down to 5 slices, and it turned out delicous, even cold! Great recipe to have on hand when you're in a hurry.

Good, quick recipe.  Instead of American cheese I used Monterey Jack.  I also sprinkled some cheese and bread crumbs on the top and baked it in the oven for abbout 8-10 minutes to give it a nice golden crust.

Tuna Casserole does not get any easier than this. I was having a craving for it tonight and this seemed easy enough. The only thing I did different was while my noodles were cooking I added the chopped onion to a frying pan for a little while just so it wouldn't be quite so strong. 
I even used the 98% Fat Free Cream of Mushroom soup and half of the amount of cheese. Still YUMMY!

This recipe was extremely easy to make and went over well with my husband.  I left out the peas and I forgot to add the onions and green peppers.  I will add those next time, but the recipe was very good without.  Kids would probably like the way I made it.  Will definitely make again.
