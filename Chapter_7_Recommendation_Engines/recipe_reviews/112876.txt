Oh man, absolutely delicious. One of the best uses for Matcha (powdered green tea) that I've ever seen.

I did everything the recipe called for, mixed everything by hand, and added raspberry filling on top after it cooled.

Notes:
- Probably needed more than an hour to cool. I was in no hurry so I let it cool for about 4 hours after making it, so I don't know for sure. But it didn't look firm enough after just an hour.

- Raspberry and Green Tea combination is delicious! Also prevents any naysayers from turning it down on the green color alone.

- Would probably use a different crust next time. Graham cracker texture was wrong and was generally too sweet for the filling. Maybe shortbread like the other reviewer, but will have to experiment.

In general, HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Wonderfully delectable!

Absolutely fabulous. I just about died when I saw this recipe. Being the matcha addict that I am, I quadrupled the amount of green tea powder. Like another reviewer, I used a hand mixer on low to avoid a rubbery texture. I also suggest refrigerating for a few hours (as long as you can keep away!) because warm cheesecake is no good. Otherwise, perfect taste, perfect texture and consistency ... the only thing I'm sad about is how much weight I'll be gaining scarfing out on this cheesecake!

This was really easy and has a nice subtle green tea flavor. I like the idea of this but prefer my cheesecake on the drier side. The fat-free cream cheese gives this a rubbery texture. So if I did this again I would just adapt it to my favorite cheesecake recipe.  I used splenda, and did not like the after-taste of it. I used a shortbread crust. The recipe suggest chilling for one hour but it needs much more time than that to chill up. Green tea varies by color and strength depending on the quality of it. And the older it is, the weaker it gets.

Increased the amount of matcha to 3.5 tbsp and thought this was perfect (I wanted a more than subtle taste) - could really taste the green tea without it being overpowering. Regarding the "rubbery" top comment from another reviewer: I used a hand mixer at low to medium speed for all steps and fat-free cream cheese and the texture was absolutely fine. I thought the graham cracker crust worked for this recipe and the raspberries are a MUST!

very tasty. I made it for my sister's birthday. I used splenda and fat free cream cheese, and I topped it with berries. My family was raving about it.

After it was baked and refrigerated, the top looked rubbery -- it felt that way, too. I was really excited to try this recipe. It's very simple, and that's a good thing :) I agree with using a shortbread crust (the one on this site is really good!). The taste of the filling was kind of off, and the rubbery top functioned as a... "membrane?!" The top "membrane/skin" kind of held the inside filling in, which was... interesting. I did add some raspberries as suggested to mask the strange rubbery look and taste (as I had almost-powder green tea, it was a little bitter and unsmooth). But despite that, I was still grossed out. I really thought this recipe had potential. I want to try it again and get it RIGHT, but I would have to BUY the powder and not attempt to grind up the leaves (as suggested in another recipe). I would try again if I don't mind risking more ingredients, though! Thanks for the recipe, even though I might not use fat free cream cheese as written, because that might be what caused the rubbery top!

It was good, not too sweet and as said by another reviewer the cake had a subtle matcha flavour.

I added 2 .5 teaspoon of green tea powder and about 3/4 cups of low-fat yogurt.  It's a lighter softer texture.  I used brown sugar in place of white sugar.  I also made this recipe into mini-cheesecakes using broken pieces of gingersnaps.  So good.

I am torn between giving this recipe 2 stars or 3 stars. The flavor was alright, but the consistency was horrible.  I did follow the recipe exactly and it just did not work out. I doubt that I will attempt this recipe again, but I did love the idea.

This came out totally amazing. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except I used low fat cream cheese instead of fat free, and I also added 3 tbs of green tea powder (though my green tea powder has been sitting around for over a year, so it's probably not as potent as fresh powder). I like a stronger green tea flavor, but I do think 1 tbs may not be enough for most people. Either way, this is definitely a keeper!

Amazing! I make it a lot for functions where I want to make a fancy, classy dessert. Instead of pre-packaged graham cracker crust, I usually make it with a shortbread crust. (Can use ground shortbread cookies with butter) And I usually double the green tea for a less-than-subtle green tea flavor (I love matcha). Always comes out tasty. I have also served it with fresh blueberry Coulis, or fresh whipped cream with vanilla. The longer it cools the better. Green tea flavor improves after 12 hours of chill time.

I made this for a potluck and people loved it. For the crust I used vanilla wafers, which I thought perfectly complimented the cheesecake. Thanks for the recipe!

I have used this recipe  several times. It is delicious.  My grandaughter requests it often. I make it exactly how its written, with  the exception of the cream cheese. I dont use the low fat.

I chose to do a variation of this recipe. I substitute the low-fat cream cheese for the traditional one and I added 100g of melted white chocolate. It was an absolute success!

This was a great recipe. I made some modifications. I doubled the green tea powder, used regular cream cheese, and used Oreo pie crust. Then I topped it with chocolate syrup, whipped cream, and raspberries.

I made a couple changes. The green tea powder at my local store was $8.99. Too rich for my blood, but they had a sweet green tea powder for $4.99. All it is, is green tea powder and sugar. It was over 1/2 cup worth, so I just added regular sugar to fill out the rest of the 3/4 cups total. I also used non-reduced fat cream cheese.

This was very easy to make.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and made a shortbread crust (I've never been a fan of graham crackers!) and it turned out well.  Every one raved and 3/4 of it was gone instantly!  The batter was very thick, but I didn't feel it was "done" when I took it out of the oven, however I followed the instructions anyway and it worked out fine! (It probably could have stayed in another 5-10 minutes as the very center was a little softer than desired) I couldn't find the Matcha powder, so I opened green tea bags & used a mortar & pestle to grind it fine.  That worked great. Overall, it was delicious and I will probably make it again.  Thanks!

I liked this recipe with some modifications based on other reviews..  I didn't use fat free cream cheese to avoid a rubbery texture. For a creamier taste, I added .5 cup sour cream. I used 2.5 tbspn of matcha powder, but would reduce to 1.5 tbspns. I would leave overnight to solidify before eating! It was good but needs some tweaking based on personal preference.
