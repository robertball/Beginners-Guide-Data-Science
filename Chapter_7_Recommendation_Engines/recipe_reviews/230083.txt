I have made this recipe twice; on the second time around I made a few changes that made a delicious difference.  I halved the recipe, and used low fat sour cream, then I added the juice of 1 1/2 lemons to the batter, I tasted the batter to make sure it had the tang of lemon before I was satisfied.  I used the full recipe for the crumb topping, in other words doubled it for a halved recipe. When the muffins came out of the oven I drizzled a glaze of fresh squeezed lemon juice and powdered sugar over the top and in the crevices of the warm muffins, it made them even moister and more lemony.  I will make this recipe over and over for my family and gifts for friends.  If you love lemon you will love these changes.

This recipe was originally published in Taste of Home and I noticed that it leaves out the most vital step of the whole muffin experience! There is supposed to be a Lemon Juice/Sugar syrup that you drizzle over the warm muffins. Believe me, this is so important to make these muffins top notch. They already have a beautiful texture and light lemon flavor, but the sweet tang of the syrup takes these over the top! For the full batch, the original TOH glaze recipe calls for 1/2 cup sugar and 1/3 cup lemon juice. Mix to dissolve the sugar, then drizzle over your warm muffins. I sometimes warm the sugar syrup in the microwave a bit to dissolve the sugar, and I always drizzle the muffins while they are still in the pan because this sends the syrup down the sides of the muffin and creates a wonderful experience in your mouth when you finally have a bite! Plus, it's less messy overall, keep the mess in the pan right! They are easy to take out of the pan, too! I made the entire batch one day and couldn't bake them all that evening, so I saved the remaining batter overnight and baked them the next morning and I had no issues with them rising at all. Also, if I have plain or flavored yogurt to use up, I use that in place of the sour cream. I've made these many times according to the recipe and I find that I like more lemon flavor, so I add 2 - 3 tsp of Lemon Extract to the batter with a little more lemon juice as well. Very forgiving recipe and freezes well!

The muffins had a great base and they came out wonderfully but I don't find them to be that phenomenal. Without the crumb topping they would have been very boring. If I ever make them again I think I'll add some more lemon to it; the flavor was rather faint in the final product.

I made these today & they are amazing!  I did make a few changes: I used French Vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream and also added lemon extract.  For the topping, I mixed brown sugar, white sugar & lemon zest then sprinkled that on top before baking.  From this recipe, I made 24 mini muffins, 12 regular sized muffins then, with the leftover batter, I added frozen blueberries & made 2 lemon blueberry loaves!  YUM!

I think there were aspects of this muffin that I really liked but it would need a little tweaking to the recipe to work for me. I prepared exactly as the recipe stated except I added a little extra lemon juice because it did not seem lemony enough. I also thought the crumble was a little powdery. I think it needs a touch more butter to make it more of a crumble. The batter is unbelievably thick so don't think you did anything wrong once you make it. Based on other reviews I made a simple syrup with 1/3 cup lemon juice and 1/2 cup sugar and drizzled over some of the muffins while they were hot. The ones that had the drizzle were definitely better than the ones that did not. They were slightly dry and they were definitely not overcooked. The texture is heavier than a typical muffin but still good. I would make these again but drizzle a little extra of the simple syrup I made on them next time and that may help with the dryness. I think it would be better with a little extra lemon zest added also.

yummy! but the serving size must refer to small muffins.  using large/jumbo cupcake liners, when i halved this recipe I only got 12 muffins out of it.  tasty! I increased the heat to 425 degrees and baked about 20 minutes for a nice rise on the muffins. also added finely chopped pecans, bout 1/2 a cup to the recipe. since i was low on sour cream, i subbed vanilla yogurt and sour milk. also, i used oil in place of the butter in the muffin batter. next time i will use only two eggs, though- it was a little dense.   will make these again!

I also scaled down the recipe to make 10 muffins. I didn't change a thing other than drizzling a little simple glaze (made with granulated sugar and lemon juice) over the tops while they were still warm. Next time I may add a little lemon extract to the batter and some grated lemon zest to the topping to make them a bit more lemony. All in all these are very good muffins.

So so delicious. I scaled the recipe to 10 servings and followed exact other than adding dried lemon peel to the crumb topping. Excellent texture and just perfect lemon flavor! Convect baked at 325 took about 25 minutes--do not wait for the topping to brown:) Thank you so much for sharing your recipe Cindi!

By far the best lemon muffins I've ever made. I made a few changes to reduce fat and calories and use up what I had on hand. I only made 1/2 the batch which produced 24 muffins. I used 2T of butter with 1 cup unsweet applesauce and plain nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream. Also I reduced the eggs to 3 and the sugar by 1/4 c. So perfectly sweet tart tangy.

Soooo Good! I halved the whole recipe exept for the lemon zest and lemon juice (I substituted the lemon juice with lemon extract). Some reviewers said it was a tad dry but I didn't think so. Maybe next time add a splash of milk and see what happens. Also I added some lemon zest to the crumb topping. GREAT RECIPE!

I love these. They aren't overpowering lemon. I've thrown in a can of pumpkin and they are smooth sweet and delicious. I've added other fruit pie filling and they come out great every time. You can substitute milk for sour cream just fine. This is my go to recipe for my large family. I make it several times a week.

I loved this recipe. I made a recipe for 15 muffins. Not the healthiest muffin but we all need some indulgence from time to time. But just to feel less guilty I did substitute half of the flour for whole wheat flour and I used fat free sour cream. I don't think I had enough lemon zest on hand but used what I had and they turned out moist and full of lemony deliciousness:)

I am appreciating the bounty of a friends lime crop. I did what another chef did- halved the recipe but kept the full amount of crumb and drizzled lime juice and powdered sugar on top. I added more juice and zest than the recipe called for cuz I am in to tang. These muffin are amazing- they are so much better than those little costco lime bites. Wow

I made this as I had fresh Meyer lemons from my tree. These were very good. Good texture...light and fluffy. I will be making these again. I made exactly as recipe except I changed the servings to 12.

Worst muffin recipe ever. I changed the recipe to 24 muffins instead of 40. I added 5 eggs like they suggested in heading. The muffins were way too eggy and greasy and tasted terribly. The only nice part of this recipe is the crumble topping.

The recipe is delicious but I had to substitute buttermilk for the sour cream because I absolutely hate sour cream. I love how the middle of the muffin is chilled by some sort of chemistry involved in the ingredients. Thanks for a great recipe!

I am having a love affair with lemons. I just love the tang and the tartness. The more lemon the better. Mmmmm! I have tweaked this recipe to make it my and my mom's favourite. I increased the amount of lemon zest to all the zest from 6 good sized lemons and added a couple tablespoons more freshly squeezed lemon juice. I have put some of the lemon zest in the topping a couple of times. Greek yogurt gives it a good zing as well. After the muffins come out of the oven I put more freshly squeezed lemon juice on the tops while they're still hot. I boil a kettle and pour the hot water over 6 ripe yellow yummy lemons and let them "stew" until the water cools. I first zest the lemons then lightly roll them on a cutting board to release more juice. Then I cut them in half and squeeze out all the wonderful juice. Don't be afraid to experiment. It's amazing what you can come up with when you veer off the path just a little. Lastly I pour the water that I heated up the lemons with into a spray bottle and use it as a dusting spray. Told ya I was in love with lemons!!!! (;

So good even though I made a few changes. I went to make them only to find myself out of a few key ingredients (lemon zest and lemon juice) so me being the creative mind I am used dried orange zest and I used lemon extract at half of what it called for in juice and I also added 1/4 tsp of cardamom and 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the batter. AMAZING!!!!!

The recipe by itself is very good but I did make some changes after following the recipe exactly the first time - hence the 4 stars. The second time around I doubled the lemon zest and lemon juice in addition to using 1/2 tsp of lemon extract. It still had a mild flavor of lemons but much more noticeable than before. Rather than using the crumb topping I also just sprinkle a little extra sugar on top to give it that "shimmery" look and a slight crunch.

I too made a few changes: Since I didn't have any sour cream I used yogurt instead. Added a little vanilla used one medium lemon's zest for 8 muffins and I totally forgot to add lemon juice. I also put a little amount of the lemon zest to the crumbs mix. Both me and my mother agreed the result was great!

This recipe was so yummy! I made it exactly how it is said on here with the addition of a splash of milk to make the muffins a little more moist and a little extra lemon juice for flavor. Definitely a favorite and definitely makes plenty of muffins!

These were very dense I was looking for more of a cake texture.
