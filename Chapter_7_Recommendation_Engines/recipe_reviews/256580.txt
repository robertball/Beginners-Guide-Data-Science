This is ok. It's kinda like eating a smoothie with a spoon. My husband loves it, but it didn't taste like frozen yogurt you'd get at FroYos or somewhere. It's not a recipe I would make again.

This was just okay for me. Not sure I liked the tang of the greek yogurt in this. I think I'd prefer a milk/cream mixture instead. Good concept though, with the frozen banana, chocolate chips and walnuts.
