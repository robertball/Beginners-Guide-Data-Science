Coach Doc, you have a winner!  Followed your recipe fairly closely, timing was right on, and we gobbled it up before I thought to take a photo.  Empty plate says it all!  Delicious.

What a perfect flavor combination for last fall.  We enjoyed the sweet and tangy flavors of the chutney although for our tastes I would add more apples or use less bacon.  It was really good with the chicken, but we wanted to have another flavor along with the salt and pepper.  Perhaps some sage or pumpkin pie spice.
