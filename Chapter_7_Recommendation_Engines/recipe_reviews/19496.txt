I used alterations from three previous reviews, I substituted 10 ritz crackers for the bread. And used parmesan cheese instead of the flour. My husband is on a low-carb diet and this was perfect for him. I did add one more egg too as a binder. The sauce I made to go with it was 1 tablespoon dijon mustard mixed with 2 tablespoons of mayo. This is a great dipping sauce for chicken cordon bleu as well. He loved it and so did I and I'm not a fish lover. Wow! will definitely make this one again. Also baked it as one of the reviews suggested too! 375 for 20 min.

These are SO delicious!! I dusted the patties with parmesan instead of flour- it made them really crispy outside, tender inside. A new family favorite!!

Delicious! :) This is fine resteraunt quality! I buy 2 large cans of salmon you have to pick the bones/skin out of.. because it is much tastier than the only meat cans. Reserve a bit of juice incase your pattys are too dry. I would add a few tablespoons of the salmon juice and extra bread crumbs if it needs more. This gave me about 8 salmon cakes. Also added one extra egg. The rest of the recipe I followed exactly. My kids LOVED these and I'm going to choose this recipe over an old favorite recipe from now on. I think the chopped onion is great in it. (was a bit curious how that would turn out)  I wouldnt use the onion powder over it personally.

I served this recipe for the first time at a family party.  Everyone loved it, even people who don't usually eat salmon.  My only change to the recipe was I baked the salmon cakes at 375 for 20 minutes on each side.  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely delicious. I used 12 oz leftover grilled sockeye salmon instead of canned and doubled the amount of hot pepper sauce as we like things a little more flavorful (it definitely was not spicy). I only used half the recommended amount of butter and olive oil, and that was still more than enough. I served the salmon cakes with a dollop of sour cream horseradish on the side (1T prepared horseradish stirred into 3/8 cup lite sour cream) and it was fantastic. This is what I'm doing with leftover salmon from here on out!

Excellent.  Baked them at 375 for 20 mins and then browned them in a pan.  Used fresh leftover smoked salmon and used 2 eggs instead of one.
Thanks for the recipe!

I loved the flavor that the cheddar and the Worcestershire gave them.  I also added some garlic and lemon pepper to the mix.  I did fry them in the butter and EVOO.  But next time I will givve baking them a try....Thanks Jeanie!

This was definitely a good base for salmon patties.  I like the idea of using cheddar and worchestershire sauce.  But the cakes definitely needed something more.  I added lemon pepper and minced garlic, but they were still lacking a little bit.  I'll definitely try them again though.  Also, instead of frying, I covered them in cornmeal and baked for 20 minutes to cut down on all that fat.  They had a nice crunchy coating.

This was good.  I added a little more hot sauce and some garlic.  I was out of flour (I know, pretty weird, I had no idea), so I used Ritz Crackers for the coating.  I also added about two teaspoons of mayo cause it wasn't sticking together very well. It turned out great.  I do agree w/the reviewer who said it needs a sauce.  I dipped mine in lemon juice, but a nice mild white sauce would have been great.

I was browsing around the site yesterday for recipes for Salmon Patties when I saw this one.  I noticed that almost 4,000 readers had saved this one so I figured it must be good.  I was looking to add some kick to my basic recipe.  After reading all the reviews I followed some of the suggested alterations and added some of my own.  I used a small red onion to add some color, added one more egg, extra hot sauce, Parmesan instead of Cheddar cheese, dried parsley instead of fresh, no butter, and some of the reserved juice from the canned salmon to ensure moistness.  I also added onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, and Old Bay seasoning.  Other than those additions, I followed the recipe except the dusting with flour.  After mixing I shaped my patties and chilled for about 30 minutes.  They held together nicely.  I then dusted them with yellow corn meal and baked them on a baking sheet sprayed with butter-flavored Pam at 375 degrees for 10 minutes on each side.  They came out golden but not crispy so I fried them in my cast iron skillet for 2 minutes on each side.  I also made the garlic mayo dipping sauce (1/2 cup mayo, dash of paprika, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon minced garlic).  Delicious!!...crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  My fianc√© said they were the best I had ever made.  My sides were jasmine rice and okra.  He even saved one for lunch the next day.  This is the recipe I'll use from now on with my alterations.

These were delicious!  I have tried many salmon cake recipes and these by far have been my family's favorite.  I added an extra dash of black pepper, an extra egg, 4 squirts of lemon juice, 3 cloves of garlic minced.  I omitted the hot sauce so my little boys would eat them and didn't coat with flour.  I baked at 375 for 20 minutes each side, perfection!  I also made a dipping sauce that another reviewer reccomended: 1tbsp of dijon to 2 tbsp mayo, delish!  Thank you for the awesome recipe!

This is the first time one of the recipes off this site was a bit of a disaster. I think it called for far too much bread crumbs. Perhaps next try I will cut back on the crumbs and perhaps add one more egg. It was very dry and failed to stay together for me. Having said that it wasn't too bad in the taste dept. but turned more into a scramble egg presentation rather than patties.

These taste amazing.  I made these exactly as written.  I baked at 375 for 20 mins with greased tin foil on a baking sheet.  It tasted BETTER than fried.  We did not make the sauce and it stood alone.  I'll try the sauce next time.

Great Salmon recipe!  Perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I didn't have cheddar cheese, so used parmesan...  They were so good - can't imagine what they would taste like with cheddar!  I also made them into 6 smaller patties instead of 4.  Perfect - will keep making this one!  **Also, I leave the bones and skin from the canned salmon and just mix it all up together - you would never know the difference.  :)

Incredible! Jeanie Bean, thank you so much for taking the time to post this recipe.  My suggestions from making these several times and from other reviews:
-check label to make sure canned salmon is boneless and skinless
-use 10-12 crushed Ritz crackers in place of breadcrumbs
-salt mixture lightly before forming into patties
-bake at 375 for 15 minutes on a sprayed cookie sheet, then flip and bake another 10 minutes
Baking somehow produced nicely browned cakes that were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  With rice pilaf and sweet peas, this might be my husband's favorite meal.  Thanks again for sharing!

Lovely! I tweaked the recipe just a tad by adding colorful bell peppers, a little garlic and another egg (because the mixture didn't bind well when formed). The recipe also made more patties than called for (I formed seven 3" to 4" diameter patties). That's a bonus. I'm heartily impressed!

Very good recipe.... I added a bit of parsley and some Old Bay Seasoning just to give it a little more kick.  Also - if your salmon is a bit too "fishy" squeeze in a bit of fresh lemon juice and it tones right down.  A keeper for sure

These are great and go together quickly, especially now that you can buy the salmon 
already boned & skinned in those vacuum packets!  I use cornmeal to coat them before 
frying and they come out nice and crispy.  My husband likes fish a lot and it's not one 
of my favorites, but I really like these a lot!

Delicious!  We especially love these with creamed spinach & mashed potatoes.  If we don't have a creamed vegetable, though, we feel this recipe needs a sauce.

Very good recipe! Simple to make and tasted great.
The only thing I did different is add 2 eggs instead of one and dusted with panko crumbs.

Excellent taste and texture. Easy to make substitutions as well. Really great if you're not a real fan of "straight" salmon but want the health benefits.

Made these as an appetizer and ended up skipping dinner becuase they were so filling.  They were perfectly delicious - didn't change a thing and they came out great!  I served them with a creamy lemon dill dipping sauce. This one is a keeper!

Delish!  I left out the worcestershire, hotsauce and flour and added some lemon pepper seasoning & they were still tasty!  They were still great the next day (cold or hot).  Yummy!

this was very easy to prepare and was really good. I added an extra egg and baked the cakes for 20 min at 350 according to a review I read and then browned them on top of the stove.My husband absolutely loved them.

We love this easy, no-fail recipe.  Excellent also with addition of chopped bell pepper.  We baked it onces in the oven, and have never gone back to frying.  Dip in parmesan cheese before baking, and the cakes will be browned and tasty! :)  It's become a weekly favorite.

These were yummy!  I made 8 patties instead of 4 (much easier to handle - used the ice cream scoop that I use for my muffins.)  My 3 year old ate 2 of them, and commented on what a good cook I am:)  I was so pleased to get salmon into my daughter - I will definitely be making these again.  Just a few minor changes - I did not use any butter (yikes! 1/4 cup - they would be soo greasy) and I coated with a breadcrumb/parmesan mixture instead of flour.

This was lovely and rather easy. I changed it slightly though taking other reviewers advices. I used corn meal instead of the flour to coat the outside of the cake, and added some paprika for the color (it helped bring out salmon's pinkish cue on the inside of the cake and some cayenne pepper to give it extra kick; I also added a dash of garlic powder). I baked them on buttered non-stick cooking paper and they turned out awesome. With artichoke rice salad and dill dip from this site it made for a sublime dinner.

These are the best salmon cakes I have ever made. I substituted cracker crumbs for the fresh bread crumbs. I omitted the butter and just cooked them in olive oil(it was plenty). My kids eat them up every time I make them. Very flavorful.

This was delicious.  I baked it as was suggested in another review.  I sprayed the dish with Pam and drizzled a little olive oil before baking.  I didn't have time to chill the patties first so, of course, they didn't stay together. I just ended up mashing the whole thing together into a sort of salmon loaf.  I cook for 10 people and they all said it was a keeper.

These are very tasty. I omitted the onion and hot pepper sauce since we're not fans of either. I dusted them with cornmeal as suggested. I only used olive oil to cook them in. Even my son who hates fish liked these.

These were very tasty right off the grill. Nice and crisp on the outside. However, did lose crispness after refrigeration/freezing, which I guess should be expected. They are quite a bit better right after cooking.

Delicious!  I used 2 eggs to help it bind, a bit more hot sauce and worcestershire sauce, about 1/2 Tbs. Old Bay, a squeeze of lemon juice and dusted with Parmesan cheese.  Sprayed foil with cooking spray and did these under the broiler for about 10-12 minutes, flipping about halfway through.  Made a dipping sauce of about a 1/2 c light mayo, 1 Tbs sour cream, 1 tsp. Old Bay, 1 tsp horseradish cream.  YUM!

These were awesome! Instead of an onion I used onion powder, because I didn't want pieces of onion in it, and it turned out fine. Also used dried parsley instead of fresh. Also didn't use any butter, just olive oil. And I followed others suggestions and dusted with parmesan cheese instead of flour. I doubled the recipe and came out with about 12 patties. Served with aoili sauce, mashed potatoes, and salad. Husband LOVED IT! Will be making this again and again.

GREAT recipe. My first time making anything like this. I just did a few tweaks. I used 1 small can of Wild Alaska Pink and 1 small can of Wild Alaska Sockeye (I think they are like 6 ounces?). This added richness in flavor and appearance. Mine needed 2 eggs to hold together, and instead of bread crumbs I used some crushed melba toasts. Dried parsley was fine, and I followed others' suggestion of parmesan cheese on the outside instead of flour. One more thing: I went to get my cheddar cheese from the grocery store salad bar and since it was what that had, I used half blue cheese and half cheddar. yums! Finally, I patted out the cakes on Thursday but didn't get to cook them until Saturday. I don't know how much this influenced the flavor, but they were definitely delicious!
To cook, I browned both sides of the cakes in an ovenproof skillet in only olive oil and then finished warming them through in a 375 degreen oven for about 10 minutes. perfect!

We made these lastnight, they tasted wonderful! and were pretty easy to make with not alot of mess. The only changes we made was we added about 1 tablespoon of mayo to help hold them together.We also added just a dash or 2 of Old Bay seasoning. We will make these again and again.

This was ok I guess.  The taste was very bland.  My son who loves salmon Cakes took one bite and asked for cereal instead.  I baked at 375 for 20mins as other stated and I have to agree this helped but I will not make this again.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used 2 eggs, Parmesan cheese and about onion powder instead of onions. I also added some garlic powder for good measure. These were delicious! I really liked the Parmesan, although you might want to use the Cheddar to get kids to eat them.

This recipe is fantastic.  Even my husband, who isn't all that fond of salmon, loved them and when looking for more.  They're super easy and they reheat wonderfully.  The only thing I changed was that I rolled them in cornmeal for a little extra crunchiness.  Thanx Jeanie Bean.

This is a wonderful recipe! I just made it for the first time tonight and we LOVED it! I had a leftover piece of salmon fillet, about 14 oz I figure. Per other reviews I used 2 eggs, I replaced the cheddar cheese with mozzerella and I added 2 tsp of Old Bay seasoning. 


It says it makes 4 patties but I got 9 of them. Maybe mine were smaller than they planned. I used about 1/2 cp of the mixture to make each patty.


I also baked them for 20 min and then fried them like many others suggested but next time I'm just going to bake them and turn them once during because they were quite crunchy just from the baking. 


Another reviewer suggested a delicious and easy sauce that I made to go with it.  1/2 cp mayo, 1/2 tsp minced garlic, 1 tsp lemon juice and a pinch of paprika. It's so good I'll be using it for other things too.

Very good!  I think canned salmon is a little fishy tasting, so serving this in a bun (with "Mustard Cream Sauce from this site) would make it less noticeable.  I followed other reviews and used crackers instead of bread crumbs, and 2 eggs.  I didn't think the onion would get fully cooked (I'm picky about that!), so I sauteed mine in 1/2 Tbl. butter before adding it to the mixture, and would definitely do that again!  I didn't dust the salmon cakes with anything - they were just fine without it.  I also left out the cheese, as I just didn't think it went well (sorry!).  I baked mine for 18 minutes at 375.  Thanks for the recipe!

The texture of these cakes came out outstanding. I used an extra egg and added garlic and lemon pepper. As other reviewers mentioned, they were a little bland. However, if you pair these with the remoulade sauce from this site you will get a ton of delicious flavor!

I didn't really like this much at all. There is something 'wrong' with the binding. I added a cup more bread crumbs to try and get it to stay together, but the flavor just wasnt' there for me.

We baked ours in the oven at 375 for 20mins (10 on each side). They tasted lovely but I bought tinned salmon that had a lot of tiny bones in and I don't think the cakes were worth the hour of deboning!
Will try it again with salmon that doesnt need deboning though!  Didnt have a crisp coating so next time will fry them to see if that works

Way too many onions, and I used even less than it called for. I would make these again with much less onion.

I liked these very much and it was easy to prepare.  I wish there were a way to give 4.5 stars though.  I would give 5 stars o a recipe that is simply amazing.  Although these were good salmon cakes, they could definitely use a little more flavor as well as a better consistency to shape the patties!  Forming the patties took forever but maybe next time I try this recipe I can judge the consistency better and adjust the ingredients accordingly.  At any rate, they were all gobbled up and everyone enjoyed them.

This was my first attempt at salmon cakes, I would cook on medium heat, not medium high, and I would add and extra egg since my cakes fell apart.  I would also cook in a different oil.  I think they will turn out better the second time.

I know a good salmon patty when I see one, but these are GREAT! Follow the advice of 1 extra egg, roll in parmesian cheese, add red pepper flakes to taste, Panko instead of bread crumbs-DIVINE!

These were really good and the kids liked them too!  I think the portions are a little off-I got six nicely sized patties.  Also, I used packaged bread crumbs, so I added an extra egg to keep it together, but that may not have been necessary.  An easy and inexpensive way to get more fish in your family's diet.

Great recipe! I made it exactly as shown and it turned out fantastic! Instead of using flour I coated them with crushed Ritz cracker crumbs then baked in the oven as other reviewers did, just to make them a bit more healthy. I doubled the recipe and used a half cup measure to make the patties and I got 8 patties.

These were very good and super easy. I have to say that I was a little worried about the cheese so I left it out and added another egg to help as a binder. They were fantastic and came together in hardly any time at all. I actually served mine as salmon burgers with a dijon lemon mayonnaise, tomatoes, and spinach.

Excellent recipe.  Although I didn't have any hot pepper sauce to use, I omitted it and the salmon cakes still tasted WONDERFUL!  I don't eat much fish, but this recipe makes me want to eat it more often.

These are awesome!! I used fresh cooked salmon, rather than canned, but didn't change anything else on the recipe. I used a sauce of one part dijon, one part lemon juice, and two parts mayo. YUM!!!

Not good.  The bread crumbs were too mushy, the W sauce too overpowering and not enough salmon.  Too bad as it was easy to make...

Absolutely delicious! I've been trying to find more ways to use up our Salmon Fillets and this was perfect! I used 3- 6 oz. fillets instead of the canned salmon. I broiled them with Lemon Pepper seasoning. Flaked them out of the oven and cooled it down. Then I chopped them up and added everything it called for in the recipe. But doubled b/c this made 10 Salmon Cakes instead of 4. I also added garlic and salt. They turned out so delicious that even my 1 and 3 year old ate them! Next time I'll try baking them liked suggested. Also, I served them with a mixture of Mayo, Dijon mustard and some Tabasco. Super yummy...Thank you so much Jeanie for the Fabulous Recipe!!!!

These were very good.  I did not use the parsley or cheddar (dh does not care for cheese, imagine!).  I also substituted the 10 ritz for the bread crumbs and added an extra egg. Added 2 tablespoons Miracle Whip and 1 tablespoon dill weed and upped the hot sauce.  Made 6 patties.  Put together early in the day to cook for dinner, so they were in the fridge much longer than the 20 minutes and did not dust with flour until just before cooking.

Loved this recipe. The first time I made this exactly as written and it was great. Thought I would try it this time with parmesan cheese and liked it just as well. I prefer baking it instead of frying and served it with a sauce made of Hellman's light mayonaisse (1/2 cup) thinned down with a bit of white vinegar to make a dressing consistency. Then added a tbs of guldens mustard, a tbs of relish and 2 tbs of cocktail sauce. Excellent

Wow! Great recipe!  I used 1 can salmon, 1 egg, 1 T mayo, 1 t worcestershire sauce, 1 t onion powder, bread crumbs, grated Cheddar cheese, and grated Parmesan cheese, all combined. I added 1 T vegetable oil to my baking dish, shaped the mixture into 4 patties and baked at 375 degrees for 20 minutes per inside, and oh so yummy!

Really nice use of leftover salmon. I took a previous reviewer's recommendation and substituted parmesan for the cheddar and baked them for about 20 min before lightly frying to get a crisp edge. I also made up a quick cucumber dressing that I usually use with gyros.

My other half loves salmon cakes, but they always seem mushy inside to me.  Using this recipe as a base, I turned mushy to fantastic!  I don't want to take away from the original recipe, but I used green onion, grated parmesan cheese instead of cheddar, and threw in a spoonful of chopped pimento for more color.  The technique of making the patties ahead of time really helped them stay together.  Plus I baked them as others suggested, then lightly browned in a fry pan to make them crispy on the outside.  PERFECT!!

These were fabulous!  I couldn't stop eating them, excellent mix of flavors especially with the cheese and worcestershire.  The recipe for creamy dill dip by Jackie was a great recommendation.  I added one mashed potato to the mixture, and used crushed rice krispies for a coating and it turned out great.

We really enjoyed these!  I followed other reviewers suggestions and added celery and dusted with corn meal for extra crispness.  I also served with the "Dill Sauce" that I found on this site (Posted by Lisa).  I will definitely make these again, I even loved eating them cold, right out of the fridge!

Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This was pretty good.  I've never made salmon cakes before and these were pretty easy.  With all of the butter used for frying they won't be a regular for dinner!  But they were a nice treat.

Oh My Gooooooooodness!!! I'm stuffing my face with this as I type!  Alterations: 1/2 teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning, 4 cheese Mexican blend, dusted in parmesan instead of flour, used dried parsley (none fresh on hand), and since I don't like onions raw, I saut√©ed a small onion with two mini bell peppers (yellow & orange), and a tablespoon of minced garlic. I added that mixture to the salmon and other ingredients and mixed away.  I added more butter to the pan as it began drying out during cooking.  I made cheese grits and saut√©ed some baby spinach and kale mix in a little butter just to wilt it.  I placed the grits on the plate first, then piled the spinach/kale mix, then the salmon cake on top...scrambled eggs right next to it.  YUMMY!!!  There was a party going on in my mouth!!!  This will be a staple brunch dish in my home.  I wish I had a photo to share but I cut into it the moment it got on the plate.

These were great, no leftovers. I served them with garlic aioli. Next time I will try with grilled salmon.

Yes, this was excellent! Even my seven year old loved them. I used leftover salmon from the grill instead of canned and it worked just fine. Also I used only about a tablespoon of butter and olive oil as needed when doing them in the pan to cut down on fat and calories. will definitely add this to my repertoire!!

Great as a next day side dish  as well. Must admit and as previously mentioned more Worcestershire sauce is needed and use parmesan instead of flour.

Great recipe!  I followed almost exactly except used fresh salmon (pre-cooked on the stove top) and red pepper flakes in place of the hot pepper sauce.  I do agree with some reviewers that this needed a sauce for dipping, but was still good as is.  It is a little tough to keep together, but if you gently use a spatula, you can keep these intact.  I made these with garlic smashed red potatoes and steamed broccoli for my husband's birthday.  His only complaint was that it wasn't spicy enough, but he is a hot head and I thought they were perfect!

Just what i was looking for. Only tweaks i made was adding garlic, halving the Worcestershire, and using grated Parmesan cheese in place of flour. Oh i also baked them fora bit healthier version.  Came out very tasty.  Will be making these again!

I've never been a big fan of salmon but when I saw this recipe, it reminded me of the my childhood when my grandmother used to make salmon cakes.  They were easy to make and the result was REALLY good.  I didn't change anything and was really impressed with how easy and fast they were to make.  I'll definately make this recipe again and again!!  Definately five stars!!

Awesome salmon cake recipe. I know the review should be made after trying the recipe as is but I didn't have any worcestershire sauce and had to improvise. The recipe is a fantastic building block. I used salmon filets that I cooked with lemon, olive oil and some garlic then flaked for the cakes. I also used some white wine and garlic powder to make up for the missing worcestershire. I only used extra virgin olive oil to cook the cakes. Yummy! These cakes don't need any condiments as they are quite tastey as they are and left-over cakes make a good sandwich. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Great! Easy and filling for a quick weeknight dinner. I followed the advice of other reviews and used Parm instead of cheddar, and Ritz instead of breadcrumbs. The flavor was fantastic. I only removed the really obvious bone pieces from the canned salmon (used wild Alaskan) and it was so flavorful. A tad salty, but I think that's b/c the canned salmon has salt already added. Next time, I will use 2 eggs and they were a smidge dry and fell apart a little in the pan. But GOOD!

I don't eat fish at all and I actually ate these!  Not fishy at all, but it did need a sauce - I used the Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties recipe found on this site.  A perfect pair!  Everyone in the house ate these up.  Will make again!

Nice recipe.  After mixing the ingredients, discovered it definitely needs another egg as a binder.  Also, followed the recipe on half of the patties and the other half I coated with parmesan instead of flour.  These held together much better when transferring from plate to pan, but I didn't notice a big flavor difference.  I actually didn't know which were which on the serving platter and couldn't easily identify a difference.  Next time I'll try baking as others suggested.

These were better than I expected them to be.  I used half panko crumbs half Ritz crackers for the bread crumbs.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and wet the mixture with some of the salmon water from the can since it was pretty dry.  For the sauce I made the mayo/dijon sauce that was recommended and I feel like it was necessary for this dish.  My whole family liked this so it was a success! FOR MY OWN INFO NEXT TIME:  I made 1.5 times the dijon sauce this time and it was too much.  Stick with the first reviewer's recommendation.

These were really good but I did change it up. I added 1/4 cup shredded carrots, 2 tablespoons dried chives, a little garlic, a tablespoon lemon juice, and a 1/4 cup creme cheese. After everything was added it made 10 fair sized cakes.

This was actually good. I wasn't sure how it would hold together without cream cheese or something along that line, but it did. Yum. Will be making these again.

Tasted delicious and was really quick! I made these in less than 25 mins. I used about a cup of chopped green onions instead because thats all I had, and I let chill in my fridge for about 10 mins. I'm a beginner cook, so I'm assuming hot pepper sauce is the same as hot sauce. Either way, it had a really good flavor, and I really liked the cheese idea. Definitely 5 stars!

I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and used fresh salmon, 2 eggs, and crackers instead of bread crumbs. I browned then on the stove first and finished them off in the oven at 375 for 20 minutes. I thought they were tasty but the texture was a little heavy. I served them with bearnaise sauce which was a perfect match!

Great, but I added some lemon and added a dash more worceteshire sauce and used more than double the hot sauce ( I used texas pete by the way). I used italian bread crumbs because it was all I had. It would also be good with crushed saltines. I served with a lemony tarter sauce. Fried to perfection, these were great!

My DH and I both really enjoyed these.  I noticed some commented on dry and bland.  We experienced neither.  I followed the directions and most of the ingredients.  I didnt want to open a new bottle of hot sauce so I used some Southwestern Chipotle sauce instead and I was out of olive oil so I used Canola but added about 2 tbs of butter for a little punch of flavor.  Oh gosh, I just now read you were suppose to add butter anyways, oops my bad.  Well no wonder it worked out for me :-)  Anyways, these were very good.  I topped them with a Ranch dressing mix.  Will add these to the rotation.  Thank you for sharing.

A new favorite.  I use crushed crackers instead of bread crumbs and omit the outer coating.  I put it on my stoneware and put in the oven at 350 for about 20-25 minutes, but have left it in longer with good results.

I make these - as per recipe - rather frequently.  They really do need time in the fridge to hold together while frying.  Absolutely delicious with aioli.  Served over a baby lettuces, spinach etc. salad for a light dinner.

These were a great way to use up the canned salmon I had. The first time I made these, they fell apart & were a mess. This time I added 2 eggs instead of 1 & that helped a lot..

I left out the parsley (because I didn't have any) and substituted cayenne pepper for the hot pepper sauce.  Turned out great!

This is deliciuos! My husband can not have gluten so I substituted 3/4 cups rice krispies for the bread and flour, I also added 1/4 cup diced red and green peppers for flavor and color. I baked ours in a 350 degree oven for 25 minutes to help cut down on the oil. Yummy!!

Delicious! I substituted tuna for the salmon, but followed the recipe to the letter otherwise.  I used my own sourdough breadcrumbs, which made the cakes a bit soft but good.  Sauced with a sweet pickle remalaude sauce, the dish was kickin! Hint, add an egg to the recipe if using fresh bread crumbs...

Yum!  I mixed the recipe exactly as written (ok, confession, I used canned bread crumbs) and this was excellent.  I used sharp cheddar cheese and it was great.  I would like to try this with fresh grated Parmesan next time. 
    Instead of making 4 patties I made 8 small ones so the onion would cook better and because I really like the crust/moist ratio.  This is a definite "keeper!"

I wasn't overly impressed with this recipe before modifications; however, with a few adjustments they are great. I used Ritz crackers crumbled instead of the bread; egg beaters (more than the equivalent of 1 egg.) Extra Worcestershire sauce, & hot sauce or BBQ sauce; add 1/8tsp garlic powder. You may use canola instead of olive. 
For a nice sauce, mix your favorite Dijon or honey Dijon mustard, mayo, lemon juice, garlic powder, & pepper. If you like yours with a little more kick, add a little horseradish sauce. Yum! Thanks for sharing!

These are great!  I am not a big fish fan so really liked the added flavor of the hot sauce, worcestershire, cheese and onion.  I use dried parsley (1 tsp for every tbsp fresh).  My husband, a salmon lover, thinks these are fantastic too.

these are just wonderful.  I have been making salmon patties for years, and I use Parm. cheese instead of cheddar, only half an onion (sometimes onion powder) and fresh parsley....Also I don't coat them with flour, I don't find it necessary, they hold together just fine.  I also use red pepper flake instead of hot sauce.  Same basic ingredients, just different flavors.  Now I am hungry for these, have to make them this weekend. :)

Tried this and just didn't think it was brilliant. It seemed dry, and a bit bland. I even served these with a bernaise sauce and that still didn't make them great.

I've been making this for several years, and over time have changed it a bit. The original recipe is great, but I get lazy...
I skip the parsley if I don't have it and I usually replace the hot sauce with a dash of red pepper flakes and the cheddar with Kraft grated parmesan. I don't like canned salmon, so I boil four frozen single serving pieces of salmon. Also, to cut the time & calories, I will often make this as a loaf- put it in a buttered loaf pan, top with cheese, melted butter and bread crumbs, and bake for 45-60 minutes at 400 degrees.  It's not as fancy, but still one of our favorites.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good stuff here!  A little bit different taste from the traditional salmon patties I make, but very refreshing change.  Next time probably add more hot pepper sauce and maybe double the receipe.  4 patties went fast in our house!  No problems with them falling apart.

This was great. I added some extras: dried dill, dried parsley, parmesan cheese, Old Bay seafood seasoning  and a few drops of lemon juice. I think I added a little too much worcestershire sauce so be careful. Added a bit more Tabasco which is always good and lastly, worked out great to bake them before you fry them. Good recipe.

Absolutely Delicious!! Made a recipe for 4 and my husband ate for three..Served it with yellow rice and a salad.  Needless to say, we ate very little rice & salad.  Thanks for a great recipe..(I think the little bit of cheeze makes it even crispier).

This was an easy recipe but bland. I think they were missing something. Next time I will addd diced bell pepper for some flavor. You can easily cook these cook in olive oil insted of all that butter.  I used leftover salmon and not the canned.

I left the parsley out because my husband hates it, but we enjoyed them for dinner. The outside was real crisp and they were very flavorful.

I made these for valentines day, they were great and super easy. I followed the directions and modifications that many suggested (extra hot sauce, some garlic, paprika).  I used a quarter of a whole onion and kept some of the salmon juice from the can. Like many suggested I baked the cakes on a cookie sheet coated in pam at 375 for 10min on each side. Then I finished them off with a  quick 2min fry on each side. They came out crispy on the outside and moist in the center. The sauce I added was 2Tbs mayo 2Tbs sour cream, 2tsp old bay, squeeze of lemon and fresh chopped parsley. The only thing I would have done different is to make the cakes smaller. Rather than four big cakes I think 6 or 8 smaller ones would have been better.

Four starts only because I tweaked it a bit. I substituted the cheddar for parmesan. I'm just not a fan of cheddar and didn't want to run to the store. I also added some tiny shrimp to it (maybe a cup? I'm terrible at measuring) and an extra egg. Everyone loved them and asked for more.

I loved this recipe. I usually steer away from seafood but this reipe was delcious!!! I follwed the advice of previous comments, replaced flour with parmesan and made the Dijon/Mayo dipping sauce. My own twist I used italian breadcrumbs and eliminated parsley ( I didn't have any on hand), I also added about 3/4 of a tblsp of fresh garlic and made made 8 smaller cakes (in order to have a bit more crunch per cake). Next time I will serve this as an appetizer with a drop of sauce on top and parsley leaf on top!!

I  used Panko bread crumbs, just a dash of cayenne pepper in place of hot sauce and half the butter and two more TBS of olive oil, medium heat 5 minutes both sides and perfect! I made 8 cakes and my husband ate 4 in one setting! Served with mashed potatoes and garden canned corn which equaled out to the perfect southern home cooked meal!! Will definitely make again and my southern cooking mother will now too! Been making salmon cakes for years and this was the perfect variation

I use a few heaping tablespoons of cornmeal fish fry --like Louisiana brand--instead of cracker crumbs.   Tastes better and holds together better.   Better for frying.

I made this just as written. The outside was crispy and did hold together. That is the only good thing I can say. The inside was mushy and spongy and the only flavor was of onion. I am cranky that I didn't notice how 99% of the reviews changed the recipe significantly. I would not make this as written again, and don't want to try to mess with it to make it good.

We really, really liked this. Based on other reviews, I used a combo of flour and Parmesan cheese as the coating and I baked at 375 for 12 mins then broiled for a couple minutes on each side to brown them up. made a really quick sauce using mayo, horse radish, Dijon mustard and lemon juice.

My husband loved these and said they had a lot of flavor.  I substituted onion powder for the onion, crushed Club Crackers for the bread crumbs, and grated Parmesan cheese for the flour for a little extra crunch.

My daughter loved these.  We put honey mustard dipping sauce from this site over the top after serving.  Will make again!  Next time, I will try making with oats and oat flour to make gluten free.

The best salmon cakes (or patties as we call them) that I've had so far! These are so easy and completely redeemed salmon patties for me. Even when I get lazy and use seasoning instead of an actual onion it's still good. My sister also "hates salmon patties," and I was surprised when I looked over and saw a clean plate without ketchup smears. I'd say it's a keeper in our home.

Made this with leftover grilled salmon.  Didn't want to waste it so made these cakes the next day.  They were kind of bland but with a super seafood sauce they were decent, I wouldn't serve them to the president or anything.  I left out the cheese and I didn't have any crumbs so I put in some ground up some old pita chips. Waste not want not. Might have been better if I had used canned salmon.

2.18.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/19496/salmon-cakes-ii/ ... Since "the boy", 16, liked 'em I'm giving it four stars.  For me, only three.  I followed the recipe pretty much except subbed 12oz tuna, onion powder (since in other recipes, the onion doesn't cook only heat), no parsley & substantially less oil & butter.  Crisp & tuna tasting, not so much cheese tasting, but it helped bind it together.  I topped with another slice of cheese & suggested 2T may w 1T dijon mustard mix.  A pretty good, inexpensive meal.  A little parmesan in it might be a good idea.  For shredded, the regular not fancy shredded, is too stiff. Note:  For sauce 1T horseradish & 3/8c sour cream.  Or 2T mayo, 1T dijon.  Sugg: sub parmesan for flour & bake.

These were good. I didn't care for the flavor of cheddar cheese with fish AT ALL. If I were to make these again, I'd make them without the cheddar cheese, and add some Old Bay seasoning and/or lemon juice at the very least. And definitely eliminate the butter and fry them in a little vegetable or canola oil.

Made this exactly as written (okay maybe with a few extra dashes of hot pepper sauce) and served with a reviewer's dip of 1 part dijon mustard, 2 parts mayo. Dee-licious. I'm no salmon cake expert as I've only had them once before and that was years ago, but these on their own with no comparisons were yummy and deeply satisfying.

This was my first time ever trying to make salmon cakes and it definitely wont be the last. I would have given 5 stars but i made a couple of changes to the recipe. Instead of using regular bread crumbs, I used seasoned panko breadcrumbs in both the filling and instead of the flour. I also didn't use any hot sauce or worcestershire sauce. Instead  i diced up a couple of pepperoncini and added those as well as a bit of the water they come in, and a little bit of crushed oregano and fresh lemon and about a 1/4 tsp of minced garlic and used only half of an onion since I'm not a big fan.

After reading other reviews i agreed that they needed a little bit of sauce or something to at least dip them in, so i mixed a little bit of mayo with hot sauce and lemon. The end result in my opinion was a great success, I will definitely make these again.

These salmon cakes are AMAZING!!!! WOW. I just posted this recipe on my Facebook for many others to try. I did substitute a lot of things in this recipe, only because I didn't have them on hand. I used fresh salmon rather than canned. I didn't have an egg on me so I drizzled some olive oil into the mixture to hold the cakes together, which worked out really well. Next time, I'll try baking it, since some of other people recommended it. Love this recipe!

Good recipe for salmon cakes--it would be much better still with the expensive red salmon instead of the pink! Also, I could not get the cakes to hold together--mine were in pieces, but still tasty.

Good...  I would definitely make again.  I did make these a few more times.  This last time I used 1 tbl of Parsley & 1 tbl Chives,  I also used Mozzarella instead of  Cheddar because that is what I had in stock.  In addition I just broke up a bread crust for the Bread Crumbs.  This was by far the best batch yet.

My cakes fell apart :-(  Next time I will add an extra egg to try holding them together more.  Coated with crushed ritz crackers before first trying to bake (tried to go for the healthier alternative) then threw them in the frying pan. The taste was amazing!  My picky eaters loved them! (Probably because I made a packaged hollandaise sauce to go on the side, also over some steamed broccoli!)  Will definitely make again, and hopefully they will stay intact!

These were fabulous! I used 3- 6oz. cans (skinless and boneless) that I've purchased through price club. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used dried. Didn't have Cheddar cheese on hand so I used 1/4 cup grating chesse instead. Didn't use butter (I forgot) just olive oil and it still came out great! Will double up next time on hot pepper and Worcester sauce for more kick. Great with a tossed salad on the side.   My son said it tasted like tuna so..BRAINSTORM.. after running out of salmon, I used canned solid white tuna with the same ingredients. Still good but salmon was better.

Have tried many salmon cake recipes over the years and have never been completely satisfied with any.  I think I finally found a keeper!  The cheese adds an interesting flavor, and I like the way the cakes fried nicely and stayed together.  Served mine with a garlic aioli sauce (the picture looks like that's what they used) and we loved them!

As written, delicious!  Served  it with a cream cheese garlic dill sauce which made it extra yummy!  Definitely a go-to-last-minute company dish!  Made a home-made mac and cheese with broccoli for the side.  A quick and easy scrumptious dinner!

These were good.  I did use an extra egg because they seemed a little dry, plus I crushed up ritz (10 crackers) because I didn't have breadcrumbs.  I coated in cornmeal rather than the flour, but otherwise made as written.  I did feel they needed a dipping sauce, so I made both the dipping sauces listed by 2 previous reviewers (1Tbsp dijon and 2Tbsp mayo and the second 1/4c sour cream and 1 Tbsp horseradish)  Will definatly make again.

Nice easy recipe with ingredients always on hand so a no brainer for a nice meal when you forget to take meat out of the freezer before you go to work -maybe that's just me.  A dolop of light mayo and dijon mustard added flavor and creaminess.  Dipped in panko and brushed with butter to save frying. Baked 420 for 20 mins - last minute broil for extra color and crisp top.  Lovely!  Give em' a try.

Soooo delicious! I substituted the bread crumbs for cracker crumbs as well and they were crispy crunchy on the outside and creamy and moist on the inside. I thought the Worcestershire and cheddar worked really well together. Terrific. Will definitely be making these again!

OMG!!!!!!!!!!! The best fish cakes ever. I did alter a little, used 2 salmon fillets that I steamed seasoned with salt and pepper. Used parmesan cheese instead of flour and 1/4 tsp of hot sauce, and baked for 20 minutes. My husband asked me to make them again tomorrow.

I made these last Friday night for our supper and we all enjoyed these so much.  My daughter could have eaten all four by herself, that is how much she liked these!  I served these with Creamed Peas and Mashed Potatoes would have been and excellent side dish to serve, as well.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Great way to use canned salmon! I changed only a few items. Added crumbled bacon & since I didnt have bread crumbs used crackers.. all I had were 'smoked chipotle' crackers. I didn't sprinkle flour on the cakes but used parmesan cheese. Excellent!

Delicious, but I made a few changes. I used fresh, baked salmon and shredded it. I crushed 12 vegetable ritz crackers instead of the 1/2 cup of bread crumbs. I didn't have hot sauce so I substituted cayenne pepper. I rolled patties in parmesan cheese instead of flour and baked at 375 for 20 min. and then browned in pan for about 2 min. each side. Turned out amazing and we dipped in a mixture of horseradish and sour cream. Yum!

I used what I had on hand to make this recipe.  I had to substitute two tsp. of dried parsley for the fresh and used Italian bread crumbs instead of fresh.  I also did not add the hot sauce.  The recipe still turned out great! I can't wait to make it again following the recipe.

Yummy, but I have a few recommendations:  Use mayo instead of olive oil for a great consistency; add 1/4 cup crumbled bacon to intensify flavor.  I always add 1/2 tsp of lemon juice to bring out the salmon taste, but cut the Worcestershire sauce down to 1 tsp in this recipe.  Last, consider "breading" these in corn meal instead of flour.  I use the boxed or packaged corn meal muffin mix to bread mine and give them a crunch.

I've been making similar salmon cakes for years. For those that mentioned needing a sauce combine a mayo with a few squirts of ketchup and a dash of worchestershire to taste.  It makes all the difference!

Good but not great. I didn't see anyone else complain, but mine didn't stay together well and I had to fuss with them when I flipped them. The cheese didn't add anything for me. I made a sauce with yogurt, lemon, dill, and salt that added a lot to them, though! Good start for me, though, and I will try Old Bay instead of worcestershire next time.

What I made was a 3 star salmon cake but I made a few modifications so I'll add a star to give the recipe the benefit of the doubt.  Modifications I made:  left out hot pepper sauce, used mozzarella in the cake and topped with cheddar, added an egg, and subbed 1 T sesame oil instead of olive.  I think next time I will add more vegetables and bake them as these were way too greasy.

Made these tonight with 3 - 6 oz cans of wild salmon - no bones to sort through. Same as recipe, except used 2 eggs, same amount of breadcrumbs (1 slice sprouted bread) and probably more cheese. Made 10 medium patties. Each had 2 for dinner with 2 sides.  Family really enjoyed. Served with red cabbage slaw and a cucumber/tomato/feta salad. The sauce I made was Greek yogurt with a diced pickle, parsley, dill and garlic salt.  They said it was a keeper!

I used a quarter of the onion asked for but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  They were fine, just not amazing.  My husband didn't like them and wouldn't eat them (but that is pretty common!).

My DH requested these and I had never had them before. I chose this recipe because of it's simplicity and it was perfect! DH said it was just like his mom and meemaw used to make. I didn't add anything to them and they were perfect. My 2 yr old didn't care for them but my 4 yr. old loved them. I will be making these on a regular basis from now on. Just a sidepoint though, I had no idea how icky salmon in a can was. I picked out the skin and bones. EW!

Made this exactly as the recipe states, except that I added a few dashes of Old Bay, as other reviewers suggested, and omitted the butter (fried them in just the olive oil).  These were very, very good.

i just made this for dinner because there were salmon trimmings in our fridge. i made 9 smaller cakes instead 4 there were easier to handle and cook. i didn't have cheddar cheese so i just subbed parmesan and it still turned out great! i made a mayo sauce for it as well to give it more flavour. will definitely make it again!

These were great!   Used 1/2 Dijon, 1/2 mayo dip suggested in another review.  Lots of salmon - next time I'll add a bit more egg and bread crumbs to bind it together more.  Made 9 smaller cakes instead of 4 - everyone loved it, even the kids (ages 1, 4 & 6).  Excellent Friday main course - will definitely make again!

Very easy to make, and very good to eat!  Baked mine @ 350 for 10 min per side.  Also sprinkled grated ramano cheese with garlic to the patties before baking.  It's a keeper!

I didn't really measure anything, just eyeballed it, and the cakes turned out deeeelicious. I only made a couple changes...I used dried parsley and instead of bread crumbs used a prepared chicken coating that I use for everything because it's sooo good! I also recommend frying in peanut oil instead of olive oil and butter - the latter mixture burned way too fast!

These just did not wow us.  I did use leftover salmon.  If I make these again I would use green onion, less breadcrumbs, less Worcestershire, add garlic, and coat with Panko breadcrumbs instead of flour.

I did make some changes. Instead of using bread crumbs, I used sea salt and pepper croutons and some original flavor baked crackers. (You can see the crackers in the picture.) I used sweet and sour sauce with a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. I skipped out on the salt and pepper since the croutons had that already. I topped the salmon cakes with sweet and sour sauce and served them with the baked crackers. I would make this again.

Yummy!  I scaled the recipe for two, used 1 6 oz can of salmon, added about 1.5 tsp of mayo, 1 tsp of garlic powder, doubled the fresh parsley, and fresh lemon juice/salt/pepper before serving.  Made a chile mayo sauce using approx. 1 part sririacha to 6 parts mayo.  Incredible!

Great recipe.  After making according to the recipe, I agree with one of the other raters who mentioned extra hot sauce and the addition of garlic.  As written, the cakes are slightly bland.

These were great and easy to make.  Like someone else, I used 10 Ritz crackers instead of the breadcrumbs (and I'd use a little more the next time because my patties had a hard time staying together).  I put the onion in the food processor and processed it to death and added the crackers to break them up.  I fried my patties in about 1 1/2 Tbls butter + 2 Tbls olive oil.  I took the suggestion of someone else and made a dipping sauce:  1/3 c lowfat mayo, 1-2 Tbls coarse ground dijon mustard, 1/8 tsp garlic powder, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper.  It was all very delicious (and I'm not one for canned fish) and I will make it again.

I have made this several times and have not changed the recipe at all.  They are always a hit.  This is the first time I served them on top of a fresh baby green salad.  This is perfect for a light lunch or a great dinner.  Nicely done.  The only thing I say about any and all recipes is after you add the basic seasoning play around with different flavors. Excellent!!

I had a can of Salmon in the pantry so I found this recipe which looked pretty good after reviewing all the other Salmon Cake recipes on this site.  We really liked this but I made a few changes because of what I had on hand.  I used Panko (Japanese bread crumbs) instead of fresh bread crumbs because that's what I had, also I didn't have fresh parsley so I used some dried dill - about a teaspoon plus a teaspoon of Old Bay and 2 tsp. lemon zest.  I coated them in Panko also - it was just easier.  I cut down on the butter/oil mixture some.  After I made them they wanted to fall apart so I carefully put them in the hot skillet and cooked till they were pretty crisp before flipping them and cooking the other side to a nice crunch.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My family loves salmon cakes and thought these were wonderful.  I had to add one more egg to the mix because I could not get them to hold together even after chilling.  The extra egg did the trick.  These were very flavorful. I will make them again.

These tasted very good and were easy enough to make. The hardest part was picking the bones out of the canned salmon. I completely forgot to dust with flour before frying (darn kids distracted me), but I don't really think it was necessary. They were very good without it.

Delicious, but like some others I added 2 eggs and they still didn't keep together as much as I would like.  Increased hot sauce and coated w/parme cheese, baked 375 for 30 mins, flipping after 15, in CI skillet.  Added celery w/tops cause I didn't have any parsley.  This is definitely a keeper for me but I will tweak it to fit my tastebuds.  Noted some other suggestions like Ritz crackers and Spanish olives and will give them a try.  Also used leftover grilled salmon not canned - not a fan of the can.

These were really good!! I added some sliced spanish olives, and a teaspoon of Old Bay Seasoning to the mixture. The shredded chedder topped them off. I also added just a little bit of corn meal to the flour for a little bit more crispiness on the outside. My two year old is just a little finicky when it comes to food but she liked these. I'll be making them again.

These were fantastic.  A great way to use leftover grilled salmon.  I used fresh Parmesan instead of cheddar.  I was worried the cakes were going to fall apart, but once they were cooked on one side, the held up great.

Very tastey.  I used my own home made crutons out of italian seasoned bread that i made from this web site.  i didn't toll the patties in flour and i used corn oil to fry them.  served them on italian rolls from this site.

This was terrific.  I love that I can make this lunch or diner using ingredients I usualy have on hand.  I made a simple dipping sauce using mayonnaise, lemon juice and "essence", a mix of spices and herbs inspired from chef Emeril Legace of course.  It's a keeper.

I was looking for a quick lunch idea -this fit the bill.  I used 2 eggs, added one stalk of celery, substituted 6 crushed crackers for the bread crumbs, coated them with wheat germ instead of flour, and omitted the butter and olive oil (used cooking spray instead).  My husband said they were the best ever!

Will make again, but add more hot pepper sauce & cheese.  I didn't have any white bread so used cracker crumbs instead.  We didn't care for frying them in the butter & olive oil so will use canola oil or butter flavored crisco.

This recipe was okay.  I followed the recipe exactly and ate it with cabbage and squash.  For some reason, the smell of this salmon mixture was super strong.  I thought the flavor was okay.  I've had better recipes.

The best!  I have finally found a salmon cake recipe the whole family loves!  My husband told me I could make them as often as I wanted too.  My kids gobbled them up as well.  I did use corn meal instead of the flour, and it did make them crispy!

I decided to get clever and make an Asian version of this recipe: To some leftover salmon I added a small minced red onion, 1 minced celery rib, 1/2 cup Japanese panko bread crumbs, 1 Tbsp soy sauce, 1 Tbsp Sriracha hot chili sauce, 1 Tbsp minced ginger, 1 minced garlic clove, 1/8 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp salt (or to taste), 2 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro, and 1 or 2 eggs (depending on the dryness of the mixture). I added the egg(s) only after first tasting the salmon mixture to make sure it had enough salt and other flavors; add more or less of the spices according to your taste preferences. I coated the patties in a mixture of cornmeal and panko crumbs and let them set in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. Through experimentation, I found that both baking and frying the patties gave the best results. First bake them at 375 degrees for 15-20 minutes to thoroughly cook the inside, then pan fry with olive oil until both sides are nice and crisp.  Serve with a wasabi mayonnaise and these salmon cakes are amazing, moist on the inside and crispy on the outside! They were an absolute hit!

I had so much salmon that I doubled the recipe. This was awful. It didn't firm up after 30 minutes in the refridgerator. It didn't cook through. They burnt on the outside and was doughy in the middle. I ended up baking them...but that didn't make them taste any better. This was a disaster. I would NOT recommend this to anyone.

This is a great base recipe. I found them a little dry and not as flavorful as I had hoped. I used the can salmon( have never purchased this before),it seemed alittle strong flavored. I'll go back to using the salmon I get out of the seafood dept. at the store. With a little doctoring this could be an excellent recipe.

They were okay, following the recipe as written.  I think they need some salt and garlic for more flavor.  I also would prefer sauteed onions instead of raw onions.

I‚Äôve made salmon patties a few times before this and I think this is the best recipes out of all the ones I‚Äôve tried. I used Parmesan cheese instead of flour as another reviewer suggested and it was more flavorful than the ones I made previously.  But although I‚Äôve given this recipe a 5-star rating, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that salmon patties just aren‚Äôt my thing. I prefer my salmon in a steak/filet form not mushed.

I will probably try this again but heads up to whoever posted this recipe it did not stay together.  I am a very good cook and I followed this recipe to the t but it did not hold together once I started to fry it.  It was very embarrassing.  It needs another egg or other liquid.  It tasted ok though but not up to my standards.  Sorry.

This turned out really good, I had 1 piece of cooked salmon and one piece of uncooked salmon left over from dinner last night so I thought I would give this a try.  I shredded the cooked salmon and finely chopped up the uncooked salmon and then I pretty much followed the recipe however I did add a little more hot sauce, I added garlic powder and used Parmesan cheese for crust.  I wanted to see the difference between the baked and fried so I did 2 of each.  I used Pam cooking spray instead of oil and butter and those came out delicious.  For the oven patties I put them in on 375 for 20 min on one side and 10 on the other.  The ones done in the oven were drier so I would probably try again and cut the temp and time, perhaps 350 for 10-15min each side. Easy delicious, a must try.  I will NEVER throw leftover salmon out again.

Excellent. But try this twist. Eat them cold!  I had two cakes left over and kept them in the fridge overnight. Cut them into quarters and place them between two saltine crackers with a thin smear of mustard. (One salmon cake and 8 saltine crackers makes 4 little sandwiches.) Makes a fabulous snack or lunch!

These were delicious! I also used 12 ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs and dusted with Parmesan instead of flour. Cook on med low heat so you don‚Äôt burn the cheese and it becomes crispy and golden brown 5 min per side). I didn‚Äôt even need the oil and butter just a nonstick pan and cooking spray. Cuts 200 calories of fat!

I am eating these now! Fabulous. I used a fresh salmon filet that I pulsed in the food processor along with 2 eggs, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, garlic and onion powder, black pepper and crushed herb croutons, dried parsley and grated romano cheese. Used a 1/2 cup measure to make the cakes so got 4. Put them on a plate dusted with more grated romano cheese and topped with romano cheese. Put in fridge for 20 minutes. Added them to a cast iron skillet wiped with coconut oil and into the 375 oven for 15 minutes on 1st side and then turned for 10 minutes on second side. Crusty on outside and moist on inside. A bit dense certainly not a light cake but tasty. Did not coat with flour. Served with horseradish cream sauce and the sauce recommended by others of mayo, mustard, lemon juice and paprika. Excellent recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Husband and I both love this recipe. Salmon isn't our favorite food, however, this dish is going to encourage us to eat more fish and we're very happy about that. I didn't make any changes to the recipe.

Make sure you mince the onion.  My pieces were too large so the patties did not stick together.  I used Parmesan cheese and flour mixture to roll the patties in. They came out very well

Really nice basic recipe that allows you to play with flavors. I like to add a sprinkle of garlic powder, Old Bay, dill and use green onion in place of regular. I do usually bake them, but you have to admit - they are so sinfully good when fried. This time I used crumbled club crackers in place of breadcrumbs and yum!

Used leftover Atlantic salmon and left out the hot pepper sauce. Adults are in food heaven. Kids? Well kids are a pain sometimes. Fantastic recipe in my opinion.

I replaced the bread crumbs with Ritz crackers, so that may be why they seemed a tad salty. Otherwise, i enjoyed these! I also added a little each of garlic and onion powder.  The cooking time was spot-on, about 5 min per side for a nice browning. As a dipping sauce, I added some Dijon mustard to mayo as a reviewer mentioned.

This was just OK.  For me, it wasn't worth the effort.  I won't make it again.  The only variation was I left the mustard out, and I baed it rather than frying.

I an a novice and followed the directions.  The patties fell apart so I ended up with some tasty salmon hash.  I did add an additional egg after half was in the skillet.  I don't know if I will make this again,  or make it with the extra egg to bind.

This was delicious! Unfortunately I didn't have canned salmon, I had fresh. Otherwise I made it exactly how it said. My 15 year old even loved it! Very filling. After trying one cake by itself,  we dipped it in some spiced up Yum Yum sauce and it was to die for! New house hold fav!

I will definitely make this again and again!! 

I did make it gluten free though. I put the Glutino Vegetable crackers in the food processor and ground them up for the bread crumbs (because I didn't have any GF bread crumbs in the house), and then I used an all purpose GF flour blend for coating. I also left out the parsley.

I made a mayonnaise sauce that everyone seemed to like...I just took olive oil mayo, added a little of the same cayenne pepper sauce, some onion powder, pepper and garlic salt and stirred it all up!!

This is the best salmon patty I have ever had for dinner.  I did use herb butter with olive oil when cooking.  I also made dill sour cream and put a dollop when serving with a squirt of lemon juice.

These were great! I added cilantro instead of parsley, added a little salt and forked-pulled some fresh salmon instead of using the canned stuff. I don't know, but the canned stuff can be kinda gross some times (skin, bones, etc.). Other than that, this recipe made a great breakfast sandwich (in a croissant with avocado)!

Salmon Cakes II Haiku: "Very good salmon. Used Ritz instead of bread crumbs, baked instead of fried." Other than subbing 10 crushed Ritz crackers for the bread crumbs, and baking 375 deg. at 15 min. per side, I followed the recipe as directed. Oh and I definitely chilled for longer than 20 min. to ensure that they'd be firm enough to hold together when flipped. They tasted great, but I actually preferred the one lone leftover patty the next day in an open-faced sandwich w/ tomato, swiss and pickle.

Used parm cheese to coat the outside of parm
Didn't use the Olive Oil 

Loved this... can't wait to make it again!

These were excellent! I didn't chill them as long as directed, but they held together well. Next time I am going to try baking them instead. I also served them with the sauce recommended by another reviewer: 2 TBSP mayo & 1TBSP Dijon mustard. Very yummy,

I am currently eating a gluten free diet.  I substituted gluten free breadcrumbs and used coconut flour instead of white flour.  These were great.  Helped me to use up leftover salmon and made a great meal!  For a quick sauce I used a little chipotle ranch dressing diluted with coconut milk and warmed.

WONDERFUL, VERY TASTY. I USED THE SALMON JUICE TOO, ALSO HAD CREAM ON HAND AND USED THAT INSTEAD OF MILK. I HAD CORN FLAKE CRUMBS ON HAND , SO I USE THAT TO DUST THE PATTIES WITH. ENJOY THIS GREAT RECIPE. I ALSO MADE LEMON SAUCE FOR THE PATTIES. MARLENE VANKATWYK

Really good! Followed the recipe except used leftover BBQ'd salmon from another recipe here, dusted with parmesan cheese as well as flour. Olive oiled a baking sheet then baked @375 for 15 min., turned over for another 10 then broiled for a couple minutes for extra browning. Made the sour cream, mayo, horseradish, and paprika sauce. Served with corn on the cob and a green salad.

Absolutely delicious!! My picky child loved it! I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs, added two eggs, & mayo to get it to hold together.  I used more of the Italian seasoned bread crumbs to coat the outside of the patty. For a sauce, I mixed 2tablespoons of mayo, 1 tablespoon of sour cream, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp Mrs. Dash table blend, 1 tsp of dill seasoning, & dill pickle juice to taste. The two combined made even my picky child go back for seconds.

But I couldn't resist altering mine, plus, I wanted to make more than just four cakes.
I added more hot sauce (we like it spicy), and replaced parsley with dill. Also, added lemon zest from a whole lemon.

Made these last night. I thought they were good but the raw onions in the mix was too much for me. I did mince the small onion.  Next time I'll either do half the onion or saute them just a bit before putting in mix.  Then I would say, this was a great recipe.  I also made a great little sauce to go with them.  Mayo, Dijon mustard, dill, lemon juice and a dash of salt.****made again and this time I sauteed the onions a bit, it worked.  Also this time I didn't have fresh parsley but did have cilantro and it worked great.

I really enjoyed this recipe! The cakes were absolutely delicious! The prep/cook time were time saving. The ingredients were inexpensive. I made a Mediterranean fish soup, the salmon cakes, sauteed asparagus, and we ended with a flan dessert. Thank you!

These were really good, but I think just a couple of adjustments made it an absolute hit!  I used fresh salmon, not canned. I used 10 ritz crackers in place of breadcrumbs. I put parmesean cheese on top. And the absolute must was the sauce another reviewer recommended....2 tablespoons of mayo and 1 tablespoon of dijon mustard, chilled.  I think that simple dipping sauce knocked it out of the park! This one is a keeper.

I made this recipe as is except used crushed saltines instead of bread crumbs and dry parsley instead of fresh. I always use canned red sockeye salmon because it's less salty and has more flavor. I did add a little of the juice to make the patties a little more moist and held together.  They fried up beautifully without dusting with flour.  I made tartar sauce out of miracle whip, dill relish, and a little lemon juice to dip them in.  They were very good and I served them with salad since we are dieting.

It was good!  I don't measure anything, but I added an extra egg and used more cheese than it called for.  I also substituted Ritz crackers for bread crumbs, which I do for meatloaf too.  I used less butter in the skillet also.  Overall, very good base recipe.

I'll start by saying "I hate fish of any variety" but my family likes it and I know I should eat it, so I keep trying. For fish, these were good, not fishy tasting and no weird textures. My kids loved them and I think they would be great on a bun with burger fixings, similar to a veggie burger. I did use the extra egg which did help it hold together pretty good. I tried some with parmesan cheese coating and some with flour, once cooked, I really couldn't tell the difference as far as taste or texture. I also used italian bread crumbs because that is what I had on hand. I will be adding these to our regular menu and maybe trying to find a good sauce to go along with them.

My hubby loved these. I used the package of salmon. Easy. I subbed with some red onion, green onion, and dried parsley and left out the hot pepper. Served over salad greens. Always looking for quick lunch ideas.

Used fresh salmon, added a bit more egg, used crackers, substituted parmesan for cheddar, fried in olive oil, added a bit of soy sauce, and served with the dijon-mayo suace... turned out very good. I didn't chill for 20 minutes and it turned out fine.

Everyone was very impressed with these salmon cakes! I added an extra egg per recommendations and used fresh salmon. I cooked the salmon in the oven first and then flaked it off of the skin and pulled out the bones before mixing it with the other ingredients.

Very good flavor.  Not fishy at all!  That was a must with my husband.  I made it with a dill sauce from the "Salmon with Creamy Dill Sauce" recipe.  Very good mixture.

Yum!  I've made salmon cakes with many different recipes.  This was the best yet.  Changes I made:  Sauteed the onions and red bell pepper (my add) and then added to the rest of the mixture.  Served with a mayo, chipolte, pickle relish and shallot sauce.

For this recipe I decided to use fresh salmon and it turned out pretty good.  I did add 2 banana peppers to the mix becuase my husband likes a  little spice. After baking the salmon in foil for 40 minutes I just covered it and let it in the fridge for a few hours then came back and made the cakes for dinner. It was time consuming but good!

The best salmon cakes ever! Also used ritz crackers as others and didn't have worcestershire so I used A-1 sauce.I left off the flour when I fried them. Baking is healthier, but I just love them crispy! Topped them with the creamy dill sauce off the website as another reader suggested and BAM!

This was my first time attempting these salmon cakes and I loved them.. I didn't have a lot of ingredients including the hot pepper sauce, black pepper and parsley but these still managed to come out yummy in my tummy. I do believe next time I will try to put some mayo in it to keep the patties more together..i mixed ketchup and mayo together to make a lovely sauce for them...DELISH!!!

This is so delicious, it's staying in my recipe box forever! I started with one fillet of frozen salmon - thawed it and cooked it on the stove for a few minutes and flaked it.   Then I mixed it with the egg, Italian bread crumbs, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, cheddar cheese, dried parsley -- I also added red pepper flakes (which wasn't really necessary), onion powder, minced garlic and a little bit of Parmesan cheese. Then I followed the rest of the directions. I didn't need to cook for the entire 10 minutes; more like 8. This made three small-ish cakes, but if I could do it again, I would have made two larger ones. The Worcestershire sauce really stands out (to its benefit), but make sure not to add more than the recommended amount.   This was so fantastic. I'm so glad I decided to go with this rather than a simple baked salmon with lemon!

Good flavor, though my hub didn't like it with canned wild salmon; we'll try fresh next time. I, too, added mayo as a binder, dusted with cornmeal and baked instead of pan frying. The cheese and Worcestshire aren't overwhelming but add a nice savory flavor. We will definitely make these again as our go-to salmon cake recipe!

Quite tasty!  I think next time I make salmon cakes I'll add a little celery and corn to the salmon cake mix - I'd enjoy the added crunch and sweetness.  Peppers would also add color, but I think I'd steer away from bell peppers because they so easily dominate anything to which they are added.  Perhaps a serrano or two is in order - we'll see!

Followed the recipe exactly and the cakes turned out great! Next time I might use a smaller onion. I wasn't sure exactly how the canned salmon would turn out, but it didn't seem to affect the overall quality. Great recipe

I thought they were good but not great. If I make them again I'll add some additional seasoning - probably Dill, fresh garlic, etc. And, if I were making for just myself, I'd add a lot more hot sauce. I'd also probably suggest a white cheese of some kind instead of cheddar. Something with a more complex flavor. Again, they were good- but I think they could have been made better with a bit more work.

We all thought this was very good.   The only change I made was when I was gathering in the refrig I saw several green peppers.   I chopped up about half of one and added it to the mix.  The green color an the added flavor was great.  It needed another egg to make it stick together. Suppose that would depend on the type of salmon you use.   What I used seemed to be a bit dry.

Very good.  I do not like dill and enjoy trying recipes for salmon that do not include dill.  The Worcestershire sauce was great in these patties. I followed the recipe exactly except my fresh parsley was no longer fresh so no parsley.  Will make again.

I had one large fresh filet of salmon left in the freezer, and this was the perfect meal to make with it!  I followed the recipe to a T, except for a couple variations: I didn't use fresh breadcrumbs or parsley and I added about a teaspoon of garlic powder. That's it! My husband raved and raved about them...he ate all 4!  To dip them in, I made horseradish sour cream, that another reviewer had suggested. Yum!

I needed to add an extra egg or else the mixture wouldn't even hold together. It wasn't that strongly flavored, either, so I added some Italian herbs. Otherwise it tasted like Worcestershire sauce and that's it. I had to do a lot of doctoring to get it to work and even then it was very "eh".

I used leftover salmon like some others had, however I am not sure what I did wrong because mine came out super dry and tasteless. The cooking time was way too long. I would not make these again.

Wow! Way tasty. I could only find Panko (japanese breadcrumbs) so used about 1/3 of  that. Added half a red bell pepper, diced very tiny, I used red onion hearts for my onions, less harsh, plenty of flavor. 1 teaspoon Old Bay TM seasoning and 2 tablespoons dill weed. I did fry in the olive oil/butter mixture but I coat in flour instead of dusting, coat again in Panko and then pan fry. Tried baking, same great flavor, just not enough calories. :)

Excellent!!  Tried baking at first - it was good but preferred sauteing lightly in olive oil with the two we had the following night. A bit more healthy.  I served it with a dollop mayo,dill,and garlic sauce on top.  Wow, good.  Didn't have to add another egg, or anything else. Did use a better grade canned salmon that was boned and without skin.

Really enjoyed this recipe! I used fresh salmon (not cooked) and I needed about a cup of breadcrumbs to absorb the extra moisture. I baked the cakes 20 minutes per side at 375 as suggested by other posters and they browned up very nicely. I wish I had used some nonstick spray on the baking sheet- it would have kept the cakes from sticking when I turned them.  Will definietly make again!

Added the suggestions of the other reviews: garlic, a second egg. Also threw in more hot sauce than recommended. Ended getting 7 patties from 2 250g cans of salmon. Served on mixed greens with taziki sauce - very nice!! Will totally make again!

THE SALMON CAKES KEPT FALLING APART, HAD TO ADD MORE FLOUR TO HOLD THEM TOGETHER. NOT SURE WHAT THE BUTTER WAS SUPPOSED TO BE USED FOR, THOUGH. GOOD & EASY RECIPE.   I WOULD ALSO TRY TO BATTER THEM IN CORN FLOUR.

I took the recommendation from others and added an egg.  The cake held together beautifully and definitely benefited from the rest in the fridge.  The cakes fried up nicely, but could have used a bit more kick.  Garlic and dill will be my next adjustments.

Great base recipe, especially for the cheese.  Thank you!

I will make these over and over again.  I took the advice of previous comments and Baked them 350 20min on each side and they came out perfect.  I also mixed Mayo, garlic and dill for a topping.

Not really impessed with this recipe and I followed the recipe exactly. It needed something...I guess it could be a good base recipe but more is needed.  I will keep looking.  Thanks anyway.

I did not particularly care for these, although having never tried crab cakes it could just be my taste... HOWEVER! Be careful not to buy "traditional" canned salmon. I bought chicken of the sea in the 14.75oz not knowing it had skin on and there was a lot of bones, even a spine!YUCK! I wound up having to supplement a little tuna after giving up after over and hour and a half spent picking bones out of the canned salmon.

My salmon cakes turned out suprisingly well considering this was my first time making them. As a matter of fact, these are the best that I think I have tasted. I also used the garlic mayonaise recipe from the Moroccan salmon cake recipe (ie mayonaise, paprika and a clove of garlic) as a topping.

These were pretty good. I don't like fish, but I liked these. My one sister absolutely loves these though. She keeps asking me to make them again. I did add extra hot pepper sauce because I love spicy food. I will make these again for sure.

This was a great recipe, a lot of flavor. The cakes were crunchy on the outside, but not dry. I will definitely make them again.

Perfectly crispy on the outside while nice and soft on the inside.  I'll be making these again.  I wasn't sure about this cause I grew up on tripe salmon cakes, but this is very good.  Recipe would probably make an excelent crab cake as well.

These are DELICIOUS!  Friends always want to come over when they know I'm making these.  Instead of using canned salmon, I cook fresh salmon filets in the oven.  I usually cook the salmon with a bit of olive oil, butter, and lemon in a foil pouch.  When it's done, I flake the salmon and follow the rest of the directions from there.  Sometimes, instead of a whole minced onion, I put half a minced onion in the mix and then add a medium sized minced shallot.  Quite tasty!  Serve these with a lemon wedge.

These are very good.  I baked in the oven for 20 minutes @350 then browned in a skillet as per others suggestions. I also add a little chopped celery, chopped red or orange pepper and a little hot sauce to spice them up just a bit. Have made them many times and always enjoy. Delicious!

My husband really liked this recipe (hence the high rating), which surprised me, because I'd give them maybe 3/5.  I baked the patties, rather than fry them.  Next time, I won't dust them w/ flour (oops!).  And I will add a second egg to bind the cakes a little better.

These were very good!! I used diced onion which was ok but next time I'd mince it up more. Also, I used double the hot sauce, and it still wasn't very spicy. Might add more of that next time too.

Good! A bit dry, but we ate every bite. I started with fresh grilled salmon, maybe the can adds moisture. Great way to use my leftover salmon. Thanks!

This was awesome! My husband said he would NEVER eat a salmon patty but I talked him into trying this one and he loved it! I substituted parmesan bread crumbs but otherwise followed the recipe. GREAT! This one is definately a keeper - very flavorful. Thanks for sharing!

I just about never cook fish for dinner and decided this would be a nice way to add variety to my lineup.  I followed some of the recommendations in the previous reviews and am glad I did.  I added an additional egg and mine stayed together fairly well.  I also added 2 oz. of pimiento and this made the dish for me, I'm adding more next time.  A finely chopped stalk of celery added nice crunch, and I will cut back on onion next time.  I wished I had had a topping of sorts for these, some sort of sauce.  I'll have to look around.  Good though!

I agree it was hard to keep them from coming apart. I used the crackers instead of bread so i'm not sure if that would have helped. All in all, the taste was excellent! I even impressed a very picky friend!

Great with the cheddar but you have to pay *close* attention when they cook.

I substituted crushed Ritz crackers for the bread crumbs and also used them on the outside in place of the flour.  I added 1/2 tablespoon of lemon juice to the salmon mixture.  On the advice of previous posts, I baked for about 20 minutes at 375.  I would recommend using cooking spray if you bake them, otherwise you won't get to eat the bottom (voice of experience).

This is a great recipe that can be changed in whatever way works best for you. I used fresh salmon and cracker crumbs. As long as you have enough of a bread product and egg, it should hold together well.

This was just awesome!  I used a previous tip and dusted lightly with cornmeal and fried in olive oil.  My daughter who is really not a salmon eater ate two cakes.  I cooked some home-made mac and cheese and a salad.  It was easy and quick.  I heated up a cake the next day for lunch and it was just as delicious!  Yum.  Thanks for the recipe!
