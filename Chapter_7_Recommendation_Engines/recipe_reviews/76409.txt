This is not real Bahamian peas and rice. No real Bahamian puts cornbeef in their peas and rice. if they did the food wouldn't cook properly and the meal itself wouldn't taste good at all.

Ok I think the cornbeef must have been a misprint. OMIT the cornbeef and you've got yourself a very rich and yummy peas and rice! The browning sauce gives a darker colour,but if its hard to find  just get a really thick tomatoe paste eg.Hunts.I don't like my peas and rice too dark.Its prettier when its rosy brown and you can actually see the peas,bacon,thymme etc.

This isn't authentic.

Though you can add the coconut milk (AKA: coconut water)or shredded, non sweet coconut, no Bahamian I know puts corned beef in their rice. 

Corned Beef is a separate dish. Good stuff too :-)

Instead, crab (yes, shell and all), salt pork, or smoked bacon can be added to dress up the rice.

I'm sorry to report this was terrible.  I thought I liked anything with rice in it but this was bland, flat-tasting, and heavy.

This is not an authentic Bahamian recipe. I did not try it so I do not know if it is good or not. I will however say that it should not be misrepresented as a typical Bahamian preparation for one the country's most loved dishes.

As I recall from our trip to Nassau in the early 90's, the peas and rice on the Sea Island Adventure was done in a light, but spicy tomato sauce with fish. The crew did the fishing on the trip for the next day's lunch. They said they were catching Wahoo. I don't think the spices in this recipe are the ones in the recipe we ate that day.

Never having been to the Bahamas I cannot vouch for the "authenticity" but I thought this was a pretty good recipe. It looked gorgeous while cooking! I was making this as a companion to jerk pork, but needed to also satisfy my vegetarian friends, so I eliminated all the meat. I also didn't know what browning sauce was so I threw in some soy sauce. It turned out pretty good. I think the bacon probably would have added some body to the flavor but it was still a hit. The coconut milk is a must! Thanks for a good recipe.

Hi! My husband and I were fortunate enough to spend the winter on our sailboat in the Exumas.  We ate a LOT of peas and rice.  This recipe doesn't sound like anything we ate (except for the peas, rice , and tomatoes - oh, yes - lots of fresh thyme for sale at the produce market in Nassau!

A great foil to spicy jerk-style chicken or pork.  I omitted the corned beef (as I had none) and subbed black-eyed peas for the pigeon peas.  The coconut milk is key!!  Will make again... thanks!

My wife of 22 years is Bahamian so I thought I would surprise her.  I have never seen her use corned beef in it, nor have I seen her mum use it (she was head cook at a restaurant before she retired).  Without the corned beef the flavor is tremendous.  However, I did not have a tomato so I used a can of petit diced tomatoes and didn't take into consideration the extra liquid and it became mushy but the flavor was great.  I also did not have bacon but did have prosciutto.  I have no problem making it again but would add another cup of rice.  I would never put corned beef in it as to me it would not be authentic.
