This was tasty. I didn't really change the recipe to much but I did use a little less chicken broth. And it looked a little bit to soupy for my tastes, chili for me has to be thick. So I spooned out some of the beans, about a cup, and pureed them then added them back in so it would thicken up. The family really enjoyed it. Thanks!

I made this for dinner tonight. It was easy, quick and tasty. I added corn, red bell pepper and tomatoes. Also I added the cayenne pepper heavily which gave it a nice kick. This is the best white chicken chili I have made so, I will continue to make it again and enjoy the leftovers!

I thought that this recipe was ok but had I read the other comments I would have maybe had more luck. It was pretty bland I thought, adding tomato, corn, and more cayenne like another commenter mentioned could have really helped.

This came out really good, but as a harried mom of 3, I always look for shortcuts and doctor things accordingly for the picky eaters of my tribe.  First, I used canned chicken (jackpot!), dried minced onion, and garlic powder, which easily took off 25 minutes of dethawing and chopping up chicken, chopping onion (kills my eyes every time), and dealing with mincing garlic. I added in carrots (also canned) and 1/4c flour for thickness. Kids loved it, wasn't up to my elbows in raw chicken juice and it took 20 minutes tops. Add sour cream and cheese on the top.

I changed it up a little, used frozen corn and fresh red bell pepper toward the end of cooking so they had a little crunch, also blended one can of cannellini beans into a paste and added it as a thickening agent. Served it with cubed avacado, dollap of sour cream, sprinkle of fresh chopped jalapeno and 4 Cheese Mexican blend on top.... YUMMY!

AWESOME! My wife loved it!  Making it for my church group right now!  I did listen to some of the other reviews in that I did puree one can of beans to thicken and I actually added another ingredient....MILK!  It was a little too spicy for my wife and I know that milk kills the burn, so I added a little.  It really added substance and hartiness to the dish!  This dish impressed me with the many layers of complexity it offers!

This is very delicious.  I like my chili thick, so I only used 4 cups of chicken stock.  Next time I'll only use 3.  Instead of 2 cans of diced green chiles, I used 1 can of green chilie and 1 can of chiles and tomatoes.  I also added a diced bell pepper.  It was fantastic!

I love this recipe as a baseline, but I make several changes. I add a half a bag of frozen sweet corn, a can of diced tomatoes, I use a rotisserie chicken (most of it and I use the rest for tacos-yum!), I reduce the amount of chicken broth and purée at least 1 can of the beans to thicken it up. I also add and bit more cumin and cilantro towards the end because I live the infused flavor of cilantro in my food, but I know not everyone is a cilantro fan. These changes make the soup a little thicker and and interesting to the palate. I put some diced avocado on top when I'm ready to eat. Timers!

This was really good! I did not find it too spicy as others have written. I added a little more garlic, used rotisserie chicken shredded, I also used the immersion blender after I had put in one can of beans. This helped thicken it as it was too brothy for my liking. I will definitely make it again.

Very tasty once I got the idea of traditional chili out of my head, it's more of a soup. We forgot to get fresh cilantro and dried was good. We also added a handful of chopped fresh kale to bump up the nutrients. Yum!

This is good- definitely good- and sure is as hot as the reviews claim it to be (though I'm not too shy!).  We followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of a frozen cup of corn and shredding the chicken.  My one wish was that it was thicker, but I see other reviewers suggested pureering a can of the beans (what I would have done had my mini blender not been broken, sad day) to make it thicker. Will try that next time, and cut down on the heat if making for guests.  Nice recipe, though!

I omitted the oregano and cilantro and added a bit more of the cumin and cayenne pepper and salt. I also added 2 cans of Northern Beans and 2 cans of white kidney beans.This is sooo good!! My husband hates chicken but this was a hit with him. Will make this again! Yum!
I added a dab of sour cream, cheddar cheese and tortilla strips for garnish. Super tasty!

First timer for chicken chili. At the end of cooking time, it still needed something, added in some chili powder and a little more cumin. No cilantro-eww. It was still too thin for us for chili, so I thickened with a little masa flour slurry. Family rated it good enough to eat! Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of the better recipes.  I left out the cayenne pepper and added chipotle chili powder, 2 tsp of chili powder and fresh jalapeno's instead of the can green chili's and add diced tomatoes.

Wonderful recipe. I skip the cilantro and shred the chicken instead of slice it. I also add a bit of arrowroot powder slurry to thicken it a bit and add a TSP of minced garlic.

I was a little skeptical about how this recipe would turn out, but it was the best chili I've ever made!  I followed the suggestions by multiple reviewers to cut down on the broth (I used 3 cups instead of 5), pureed one can of beans, and doubled the cumin and oregano.   I also added a tsp of the cayenne pepper (I like it spicy) and doubled the recipe so it would last most of the week.  Delicious!

Love this recipe! The only thing I changed was I used ground chicken instead of shredded. It was a big time saver and tasted excellent. This will definitely be in our regular dinner rotation.

I made this and it was great. I did make some minor adjustments. 5 cups of the broth was perfect . I also cut the chicken into chunks ahead of time, then mixed about half of the seasoning with about 2 tsp of oil to coat the cut up chicken and refrigerated for about an hour. This simplified things  as once the chicken was browned I just added the rest of the ingredients. I also added about a cup of diced red bell peppers.  One additional can of beans mashed up to thicken the chili as suggested by another reviewer worked well. This is a really good recipe and is very easy to make.

After I read all the reviews, I changed it up by adding corn and a can of diced tomatoes, and also pureed one can of the beans to make it thicker. I added more cumin and oregano too. This was more like a "soup" than a chili but it tasted great for my work gathering, and my husband enjoyed the leftovers. On the side I served chopped avocado, chopped green onions, and tortilla strips. It was a hit.

When I make this recipe, I do something a little bit different. I add 8 ounces of cream cheese. It makes it creamy and eliminates the tanginess, for my kids. It makes it more palatable for my three daughters.

I use this as my base recipe. I use 4 T of Cumin and 4 - 4oz cans of diced chillies (hot ones if you like more bite) and less broth. Not fond of corn so don't add it. Sometimes I buy a roasted chicken at deli and debone and use it. Lot more flavor.

My first time making white chicken chili. I added carrots to the onion and garlic, then I made a roux to thicken the soup because reviews stated it was too thin and we like a creamier soup in our home. I also use a rotisserie chicken instead of chicken breast. I only used 4 cups of chicken broth as I didn't want to open another container. Corn was also added. I think next time I would add more vegetables for added nutrition.  This was a great base for the soup and create to your own liking.

I have made this recipe several times, and everyone always loves it.   I add dried cilantro directly into the soup while it’s cooking, and I also add the cheese directly into the pot of soup.  I use low sodium chicken broth as well.

New family favorite! I followed one of the hints in another recipe and mashed some of the beans to thicken the recipe. I have also used leftover refried beans to thicken. Delicious!

Great recipe.  There is a similar one that adds heavy whipping cream at the end. Take it off the heat and add whipping cream.  I tried both ways.  Liked without cream.  But ... we did have sour cream to use as a "topping."

A pretty decent basic recipe you can add things to. I added carrots and corn and left out the chilis. The kids ate it, so it's a keeper.

Needed some doctoring, IMO. I thought there was too much broth; thickened it up with some milk as others suggested. I also added a can of corn to bulk it up. And increased the amount of spice including adding onion powder as well. It was good with the changes, just exceptional. I will keep looking for the "perfect" white chicken chili recipe.

Great and easy.  I added a splash of lime juice and added the cilantro right to the pot from my frozen stash.  I only add two cans of cannellini beans, I also used a can of garbanzo beans.

Fantastic flavor! As other reviewers recommended, I blended one can of beans with a bit of chicken broth to add more thickness. Served with freshly-sliced jalapenos and avocado, this was a huge hit in our house!

family favorite I don't use the green chilies. I use roasted Reds. Also, I do three cans of beans in it. And two cans pureed in the food processor. To give it that thicker consistency.

Cooked chicken tenderloins in olive oil until done. Removed from pot. To pot added onion, garlic and one chopped green pepper. Cooked until tender. Added 2 cans of beans,  another can drained, one can of chili peppers and 4 cups of chicken broth (don’t think you need anymore plus I read reviews beforehand saying it was too soupy) After adding spices, added chicken back in and cooked for 1 hour. Served with avocado, cheese and chopped cilantro. Yummy. I would probably up the spices next time. I like a little more kick but hubby added tobacco and he was happy. Easy, healthy meal.

Adjusted recipe for 2 and used Knorr Chicken flavored bouillon in the jar. Didn’t have any cilantro (raining to hard to go out) and it was delicious and not very spicy. Definitely a keeper.

The broth made this a winner. I usually add noodles to my chili anyway, so I added it to this one as well. Very filling with just one helping. I made this for a get together. I added about 7 cubes of chicken buillion with the equivalent water; plus peeled, diced tomatoes. I also added one other chicken breast and shredded the chicken. I will make this again. Love the green chilies.

I was looking for a different recipe when I came across this one that had similar ingredients to what I am used to. This recipe is perfect as is but if you like it spicy you'd definitely want to increase the cayenne pepper quite a bit.  Easy peasy and very yummy!

I've been making this for years, always doubling the recipe because it freezes well.   However, I'm always requested to bring it to tailgate parties and this is where the embellishments come in!   Double the recipe, quadruple the amount of cumin, add 4 tbsp. Hot chili powder, a cup or two of frozen corn kernels.  (I skip cayenne, but do add 2-3 shots of sciracha).  Of course, the chili is no longer white, but the flavor is wonderful.   This will fill the slow cooker.   Other tailgaters wander by, enticed by the aroma.  There is never any left.

I added the cilantro in while cooking. Also after I sauteed the onion, I transferred everything into a crockpot and left on high for 5 hours. Everyone enjoyed it! It's great with sour cream mixed in when served. 
Thank You!

As presented, the recipe was rather bland with the consistency of plain broth. Taking suggestions from a previous review, I blended 1 can of beans with some of the broth and poured it back in to thicken it. I also blended in 8 oz cream cheese which made a fantastically creamy sauce. Instead of the cilantro we opted for sliced fresh jalapeño. With those changes I’ll make this again.

The dish taste great, but had to much liquid in it for me. Chili should be thick. May be more beans would help.

I love the combination of flavors and the simplicity of this chili which is more like a soup, but I love a great soup!
The only change I made was substituting one of the cans of cannellini beans with Great Northern beans. 
I also experimented by adding some instant potato flakes at the end in an effort to thicken it a bit.  I will make it again and I have already shared the recipe with a friend who loved it.

I didn't want to make a big batch so I modified and added some  ingredients. I used rotisserie chicken, 2 cans of white beans, 1 can of green chilies, 1/2 onion, 1 clove garlic, 1 container of chicken broth, 1 tsp. cumin. I added 1/2 cup heavy cream and a can of corn, a squirt of cilatro paste and about 1 cup of cheddar cheese into the soup. It turned out great. I seasoned with herbamare.

Tastes great but too thin--more like soup. I prefer a thicker chili.

We really love this recipe.  It's so easy with leftover chicken, my teen (14yo) can handle making this.  I'm not entirely sure what he did the last time, he thinks he added some leftover heavy cream or half and half, and it was crazy good also.   But this recipe "as is", is a staple in our house.
Please, if you change a recipe, DON'T rate it!!!

This makes for a yummy meal on a rainy day. My husband and I gave it a strong B+. It has lots of flavor and I loved the added 2 pinches of cayenne pepper. I liked it lighter on the cilantro but a small amount of cilantro was nice for a fresh taste. I plan to make again.

It was more like soup like some have said but still very good.  I downsized the recipe to fit our needs and added Himalayan salt.  I had mine with Jasmine rice and my son ate his plain.

we make this a lot. I like to sub in ground turkey or chicken for the meat. add a can of beans (pinto or cannelini) and pulverize them before you put them in to help thicken it up. add a package of frozen corn.

So good and so simple!  I cooked my chicken in the oven (with just a spray of olive oil), and then used the juices to cook the onions and garlic on top of the stove. I also added a can of whole kernel/nibblet corn.  I was light on spices.  Soo delicious!

The flavor is really good but it’s more of a soup then a chili. Even though I cut the liquid by one cup, drain the beans, and puréed one can of the beans. It’s still too liquidy to be called a chili. But the flavor really is good.

I used leftover chicken and  only 2 cans of beans. Upped the cayenne to 1/2 tsp. but might be too spicy for those who don’t like spice. This recipe is GREAT!

I used dried cannelli beans that had been soaked overnight.  I pureed about 1 cup of them with the broth to thicken the soup as another reader suggested. I also added a few shakes of  cajun seasoned salt .  It was a hit with the family.

I made this in the pressure cooker and it was ready within 15 minutes. Used boneless skinless chicken tenderloins, added bell peppers, added some cajun seasoning and served it with quinoa and garnished with chopped green onions. The family loved it - both of my toddlers gobbled it up. Next time, I'd thicken it a little - was soupy.

This is a delightful, healthy and very tasty updated version of an old standard.   I added cubed red pepper and some additional seasoning as well as thickening with flour.  Quite delicious!

This is a good recipe.  I like the creamier broth in this recipe because of the cream of chicken soup. I did not have enough chicken, so I adjusted the seasonings accordingly (1 tsp of cumin and oregano).  I added a chopped and seeded poblano pepper to the recipe.  I did not add the olive oil, since the chicken I was using was leftover and already cooked.

I made this for hubby.. he's on a low or no carb diet and this is a good Chicken Chili just for him!  I only put in 1 can of the green chiles because I'm not a fan of them and I wanted to eat it too. 

It was very tasty... full of flavor and I'll make it again!

Based on other reviews, I used 1 less cup of chicken broth and added an extra clove of garlic and 1 heaping teaspoon of cayenne pepper to boost the flavor. I also used fire roasted green chili’s. I served  it with a dollop of sour cream and a four cheese blend including pepper jack.  I would definitely make again.

Love this recipe and make it often! I replace the cheese with a can of coconut milk to give it the creaminess since I do not eat dairy. Excellent and easy! Hubby loves it to, which is a bonus.

I used ground chicken and cut back on most of the ingredients.   I let it simmer a couple hours thinking it would thicken a bit. 
 Next time I will try to puree some of the beans to thicken it up.  Super easy and good flavor.

A good one! Even my young daughters liked it. A bit on the "cumin" side for me but still good staple to add to the list of ones kids like and will eat. Served with a sprinkle of parm cheese and some honey cornbread muffins! Yum!

Wasn’t a huge fan. Unlike other white chicken chili’s - this recipe was very watery and didn’t have as much flavor as I’d like from a “chili”

made this twice, people went back for seconds at a potluck, instead of all the spices I just add 2 packets of taco seasoning, 2 tsp of red chili powder, 1 tsp of oregano. 1 also decreased the water/stock to just 1 box of stock and reduced the  whole thing down till it was thick enough to have over tostitos topped with sour cream, green onions (or chives) and mexican blend cheese. The key to making chili is never throw out the juices that come with the beans, just dump them into the chilli!  Also great to eat alone with a spoon, without adding any other carbs/fats.

I added a can of unseasoned Old El Paso refried beans to thicken it (I do this with my navy bean soup as well) and it was perfect.  Hubby loved it--a rare occasion as he's the world's most finicky eater!

This is the second time that I have made it.   My daughter and bf really like it.  I add a Poblano pepper, and a can of  drained corn along with chili powder.  The third can of cannelini beans I puree to thicken a little.  Since I rated it 4 stars and not 5 is that I'm not overly fond of Mexican food, but they love it. I put their cilantro (Yuck) on the side.

I used a large jar of Randall Great Northern beans (crushed some of it like the other reviewers) a couple of spoonfuls of salsa, and spiced it to taste.  I used a 4 cup chicken broth carton (no need to add 5 + cups).  This is a forgiving recipe that you can tailor to your preferences.  I had 2 cups of leftover chicken saved for this recipe, so it came together pretty quickly for an after-work easy meal.

Love white chili over red anytime. I had to reduce many things because I was working with only enough eftover chicken for 2 and had everything else in the pantry. used shredded 3/mexican cheese, it's what I had and it was a nice thickener....only thing I added was corn bread croutons, because I had made cornbread and had the left overs in the freezer...great way to use leftovers. Hubby was happy....

Used ground Turkey, chunks of chicken would be better but it turned out pretty good. I did not use as much chicken broth as I wanted more of a chili instead of a soup. I also thickened it up with a little flour and water,

I used 5 chicken breasts to even out the meat to bean ratio.
5 1/2 cups of chicken broth seemed like it would make it too soupy, so I added broth to cover. I came out to about 3 cups.
Also, before adding the liquids, I stirred in a tbsp of flour to thicken, and make it more "chili" like.

I reduced the chicken broth to 3 cups and found it watery.  If I make it again,  I would try making a paste out of the beans like others suggested.  I felt there was too many beans and not enough chicken.

Good basic white chile but I would leave out the oregano next time. I used just 2 cans of beans with 2 cans of green chilies, 2 very large Chicken breasts and only 1 cup of chicken broth; I like mine a bit thicker as well.

I made this dish on a cold day! and it was great. I did notice the amount of broth makes it almost soupy. So next time I will be decreasing that. I also added black pepper and corn with some quick homemade tortilla strip chips to top the chili off. I did make two batches. One vegan ad one regular recipe. I just switched out the chicken for tofu and used veggie broth instead of chicken broth.

Only needed two chicken breasts, and I cut WAY down on the spices, as small children at table. I served with sour cream to make it white and yummy. Also cut way down on amount of green chilis.

I followed others' recommendations. I blended one can of beans and used less broth. I added a can of corn and Rotel tomatoes. I added some chili powder as well. It doesn't taste like white chili but it's good. The green chilies and cayenne give it subtle heat.

This is a favorite recipe of mine to cook and live off for a week--even after sharing with friends. I take some creative freedom by switching out cannellini beans for kidney beans, which are a bit cheaper. I also love to add tomatoes and garlic and pair it with white rice to make it last longer. Also to make the cooking more time efficient, I cut up the chicken into bit-sized pieces, sprinkle with salt, pepper, and paprika, and cook the chicken while the pot of broth and ingredients boil.

I've made I a few times, stick mostly to the recipe.. I do agree on he less broth, have also added the tomato,okra,corn mixture, just for something different  & visual appeal...also when to soupy, transfered to cast iron skillet topped with corn muffin mix..1 box  Bake until golden brown top with butter.....this is my favorite, soaks up the extra juice...it's just delicious this way!!!

We love this chicken chili.  And it's great the next day as a leftover.

I follow the recipe but put it all in a crockpot.  I don't precook the chicken - and it comes out great!  I use a bit more than a pinch of cayenne because we like it a little spicy.  I serve it with tortilla strips.  DELICIOUS!

I haven't made this recipe per say. I do make my own version. It's easier cutting the raw chicken into pieces and then cooking it. I use a whole box of chicken broth/stock. I add 3 cans of chopped green Chilis 1/2 a cup of heavy whipping cream and 16 oz of sour cream after letting it simmer for 30 minutes or so. Eat with tortilla chips and cheddar cheese..very yummy!

Only used one can of beans and then added a can of white hominy.  Used Costco rotisserie chicken.  Also included about 1 cup of frozen corn and a whole bunch of spinach.  Sautéed the onions and garlic ahead of time.  Threw it in the crockpot  and set it on LOW for about 3.5 hours.  It was really good and quite easy.  Only giving four stars because of the changes made.

Used pinto beans. It was what I had on hand. Put in some hot peppers I had frozen and green peppers, and corn I had canned.  Was soupy so I thickened it with cornstarch.  Left everything else the same.  Was really good.

I made this using leftover cooked chicken from the freezer and made the mistake of chopping it in the food processor.  So texture wise, was really off for us.  Spice wise, this was very mild and the green chili flavor really came through.   Very good for people who don't like a lot of spice or for kids.  We will have again.

I had never made a white chili before and this was wonderful! Easy to prepare and the smell while it cooked filled the house with deliciousness. I've shared the recipe with friends and will definitely be making it again!

This was effing fantastic, we gobbled it up for dinner and then leftovers for lunch the next day.  I modified as follows:
(1) used ground turkey vs chicken - next time I will try the chicken
(2) doubled the green chilles and cayenne   (per preference to amp up the heat)
(3) roasted a head of cauliflower in the oven, then puree'd it and added it about 1/2 way through the cook time...this thickened the consistency and enhanced the flavor

I didn't have any green chilis so I used salsa verde. Made it just so good!  Must have with cilantro and avocado to get all the flavor a to dance.

I used less broth as others suggested, and simmered the chicken for 20 minutes in the broth instead of browning it. I still added the oil. Yes, I will make it again.

The taste is very good following the directions, but this recipe was far too soupy. 

I used a 32 oz container of chicken broth, about 4 cups instead of the 5 cups called for. I also added a can of corn,  and to thicken, added 3 tablespoons of corn meal and simmered an additional 30 minutes. Still soupy, I put 2 cups of the soup into a blender, pulsed a bit and added it back in.  This helped somewhat but still not a desirable solution for the thickness I prefer chili to have.

love this recipe, I used a rotisserie chicken from the store cause I was running late also only had 1 small can of green chili's and 1 small can of chopped jalapeno's so that's what I used and it was the perfect amount of spice for my husband who doesn't care for spicy stuff much. was pretty soupy at first but the next day it was pretty thick and all my co workers loved it since I made too much for just 2 people as usual lol. made in the crock pot and this will definitely be a continued dish in the winter.

Yumaroni! I boiled a chicken carcass for my broth and chicken which nearly doubled the recipe. Thanks to the reviews, I pureed one of the four cans of beans I added. I quadrupled the garlic, just because, and added a few dashes of Mexican hot chili powder.

This was AMAZING!! My kids and my boyfriend loved it!! Great taste I did change it a little... I chopped the chicken breast into small pieces then seasoned with salt, pepper, all seasoning while cooking in skillet.. I didn't use fresh garlic I used minced jar garlic and I did not use green chiles. It didn't have the consistency of chili more so if a regular soup.. Still was amazing !!!

It was wonderful. Quick and easy. Had most the ingredients except chilies.But keep them now.Grandson doesn't care for beans so Grandaughter and I put one can in the blender before adding.Thickened the broth but we added more tomatoes and corn and it was perfect. We had enough for seconds and lunches.bkarr

Good recipe. I used ground turkey as that was what I had on hand.  Didnt use as much chicken broth as required, just added it on an as needed basis.  For those reviewers who say they added tomatoes- then what u made was not really white chili.

This is a fantastic recipe. If you make your own bone broth, and use that instead of the boxed kind from the store, it's out of this world. I also add 2-3 avocados cubed, I don't drain the beans, and I blend half of the beans up with the broth so it comes out creamier. Add some sour cream, cheese, and tortilla chips, and you are set!

I thought this recipe was too bland and soupy/watery.  I had to make adjustments so I added diced jalapeños for a little more spicy flavor. Also added some chili powder. I seasoned the chicken separately and cubed it before I sautéed it so it would cook faster and be cooked through fully before adding to other ingredients. Because I had already added all the broth and it was soupy, I had to add corn starch to thicken it.

I made this as a quick week night meal. I added a pack of taco seasoning because I thought from reading the recipe it might need extra flavor. I also cut up some  left over flour tortillas in small strips and sprayed them
with canola and baked them until brown. They were a great extra accompaniment.
