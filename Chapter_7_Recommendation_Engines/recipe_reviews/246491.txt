Was looking for an easy chicken recipe to include tumeric and this was it. I didn't have the mushrooms, but it was still delicious.  I will make again, but going to add something more to spice it up. Still a quick easy recipe.

Was a bit bland, but had a mild flavor. Would add more spice next time...and more salt (sea salt).

I followed it exactly and everyone enjoyed it (including my 8yr old and 12 yr old).   Next time, I will increase the amount of turmeric and paprika. Served with steamed broccoli. Yum! Thanks for posting this recipe.

Loved this recipe and so did my whole family including our 5 yr old and extremely picky husband! Didn't include the mushrooms and didn't have any lemons/lemon juice, but it was still so yummy! I did add a couple of splashes of chicken broth when I added the cooked rice just to give it a little more moisture because I forgot we were out of lemons.

Quick and easy, thought it needed another layer so I added some cayenne and molasses.  I also used juice from (1 whole) lime along with lemon.  It was fantastic and the recipe was requested:)
