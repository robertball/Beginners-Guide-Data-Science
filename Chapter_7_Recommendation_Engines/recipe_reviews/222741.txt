I made a double batch as I had extra tofu to use up. I think that was a little too much vinegar so will add to taste next time. Turned out yummy! Added black beans for extra fiber:)

We made this last night as a side with portabello burgers--very tasty! It was great warm last night but also delish cold for lunch today. The only change we made was to throw in some red bells too b/c we had them on hand.

I really enjoyed this recipe but my family...not so much. My son felt it had way too much vinegar. I disagree but I do love balsamic. I used a green and a yellow pepper and we served over brown rice. Probably won't make again because the family didn't love it but I would recommend it if you're looking for a tofu dish.

I did some improvisation and was thrilled. Instead of onions I added leeks and to the vinegar I added a teaspoon of minced ginger. I only had cherry tomatoes so halved 40 and used instead of regular tomato. Dish was delicious.

I tried this recipe today. I've never cooked tofu before but this was a wonderful introduction into it. Never again would I distrust tofu....it tasted great. I added portobella mushrooms just to add more veggie meatiness to the dish.

This was pretty tasty. It definitely needs to be served over something. Pasta or couscous.

I'll admit to making just a couple of changes (as you can see from the photo!) I had to use red and orange bell peppers because my green one was WELL past the point of use. I also only had plain tomatoes so I added some chopped garlic and Italian seasoning to make up for it. And I added mushrooms...because they were about to go the way of the green bell pepper and I couldn't stand to waste them! This was great and I intend on making it again with the green bell peppers but it's always nice to have a recipe like this in your arsenal that uses common ingredients (at least in my fridge) and comes together for a quick meal. I served it over whole wheat pasta and it was light filling and I now have leftovers for lunch! thanks!

Just made this for the first time tried to follow it as close to the original as possible. Only had diced tomatoes with green chilies so that was the only substitution.

I thought this recipe would be bland, but it was surprisingly flavorful with the balsamic vinegar. I was afraid the balsamic vinegar would be overpowering, but it was fine. But I did add extra oregano, onion powder, and garlic powder.

I found it a little bland but maybe I didn't add enough salt.

Skipped the onion. Used granulated garlic. Added a teaspoon of chili garlic sauce (left over from Thai takeout). Substitute butter for oil (no oil on hand). Saut√©ed peppers for closer to 10 min and then whole thing for another 10 to stew together. Yummy!

This was great!! I had some garden tomatoes to use up so went w/ another reviewer's suggestion and used them plus some dried basil and oregano plus 3 large garlic cloves minced. Also added chunks of mushroom. Very simple but very flavorful and good! We thought the vinegar was just the right amount. Did serve it over brown rice. YUM.
