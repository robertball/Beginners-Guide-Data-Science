Loved it!! I made this for s family gathering and they loved it. I could not find can lentils so I used 3 cups of cooked lentils, which I cooked according to the packaging instructions. Aside from that I made the recipe as written and served it warm topped with crumbled feta along tortilla chips. Delicious!! I froze  the leftovers to serve with tacos or burritos.
