Made this for Thanksgiving. Delicious!! It was great because we deep fried a turkey and had no drippings for gravy.  I did not end up with as much stock but added chicken broth.

Awesome, but a fair amount of subs as Borneo stores didn't carry stuff.  2 turkey necks plus 4 strips bacon, 1/4 cup dry white wine plus 1 t brandy to replace Marsala, 1 c. Kallo vegetable broth from cube, 1 c. brown mushrooms with onion-carrots-celery to replace porcini.  Left veg in broth overnight then strained.  For sauce, about 1 c. brown mushrooms chopped finally.  Absolutely delicious!

I've made this for the last 3 Thanksgivings and it's delicious. My trick to simplify this recipe is this- after cooking the turkey necks and onion/celery mix and deglaze the pan as instructed with marsala wine- you then put the rest of the ingredients in the crock pot and cook overnight. All that's left is 'the sauce' instructions the next day. Easy and it always turns out perfect.

I made this gravy last year at Thanksgiving and it was a complete disappointment. It was a *ton* of work and resulted in so much less gravy than suggested by the recipe. I followed the instructions closely and watched the video twice. I can't imagine what went wrong. Not only did the recipe not yield much gravy (nowhere the amount suggested), but the gravy was also rather unexciting. I highly advise against this recipe. It's so much work and you get so little - both in quantity and taste - in return.

What a time saver! Made the gravy the day before thanksgiving. First time I used porcini mushrooms, was amazed at the flavor. Lots of raves about the gravy, will make this a staple for me. Thanks

I was worried that I had a quart and a half of gravy for Christmas dinner, serving four people. I husband loved it so much, I would not be surprised if he drank the leftover gravy.

This gravy was delicious, but too watery.  I had to add quite a bit of corn starch to thicken it up.  Also, it was far from 16 servings.  It's a lot of work, but great flavor.

This gravy/sauce is very good.  The author is correct about using sweet wine.  I used turkey drumsticks as I couldn't find the necks at the store I was in.  My daughter brined the turkey and the gravy from that brine was way too salty.  Glad I made this recipe!

This was the best thing at Thanksgiving. It saved me so much time and I really needed it. I wasn't able to find the turkey necks, so I substituted chicken thighs. I also used regular brown mushrooms. It turned out fantastic.
