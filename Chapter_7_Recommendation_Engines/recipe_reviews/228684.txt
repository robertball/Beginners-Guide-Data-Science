We made this for breakfast. Perfect!! Hearty, moist, and tasty. I added an extra bannana and a handful of quinoa flour . I love that it's low in fat, high in protein, and has no sugar. Everyone loves it!

Very moist; great bread! I used almond meal instead of almond flour and honey instead of agave. I have tried other grain free/paleo breads, but this one is much more moist and flavorful.  I did have to cook mine about 50 minutes. Will definitely make again!

I customized this recipe a bit to make it more kid-friendly.  I used 1cup almond meal and 1 cup baking flour and then added a streusel topping (2 Tbl softened butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 2Tbl rolled oats, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon).  It was delicious!

After reading the reviews, I decided to try this recipe as muffins instead of a loaf and they turned out wonderfully! Here are the revisions I made:
~ Added 1/2 tsp of ground nutmeg
~ Increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tbsp
~ Used vanilla soy milk instead of water
~ Used vanilla extract instead of almond (didn't have any almond extract on hand)
~ Used a combo of agave and real maple syrup (1/8c each)
~ Added 3/4 cup of extra dark 65% cacao chocolate chips

The muffins were super moist but firm and I WILL be making these again! Oh, and I used a muffin pan with light spray of oil instead of paper cups because paper cups tend to stick way too much. 

Thank you!

These are delicious! I made them with about a 1/2 c raisins and cut down on the agave for some shredded coconut. Also, I subbed1/4 of the almond meal (1/2 c.) with ground flax seed, which I always do with almond-based recipes to help retain a little more moisture. This is a fantastic foundation recipe to continue tweaking with the ingredients I have on hand. 

Also, I used a mini-loaf pan (4 loaves instead of 1 large one) and they baked perfectly in 45 minutes. Grain-free quick breads often perform better in smaller baking sizes since the leavening agent has to do less work.

Followed the recipe to a T ... but when the loaf was still jiggly in the loaf pan after the allotted time, I covered the top with a tent of aluminum foil and gave it another 15 minutes.  Loaf was a toasty golden brown all over.  Let it sit in the pan for an hour after removing it from the oven.  It was as dense and wet as a saturated sponge.  Smelled great, but the flavor was absent and the consistency was mealy.  Let it sit overnite and tried it the next morning -- no improvement.  Disappointed.

Did some tweaking: substituted almond milk for 1/2 water, ground flax for 1/4 almond flour, honey for agave. Stuck with almond extract. Used small loaf pans and it filled 3 pans just over 1/2 way, all cooked nicely in 45 mins. Due to picket eaters in my house one loaf was plain, one with choc chip morsels, one with choc morsels and walnuts. The choc chips definitely added needed sweetness, and the walnuts topped off the yummy-ness. Agree with reviewer that this is a great base with which to experiment.  Without chips would add more honey or other sweetener.

Really delicious. And so healthy! I used maple syrup instead of agave. Skipped the almond extract. Used vanilla extract instead of vanilla bean paste. And added a handful of raisins. 
It takes longer to cook than the recommended time. It might do better in two smaller loaf pans.

I followed the recipe exact except I left out the vanilla bean paste and added another banana. I poured the batter into a muffin tin that held six large muffins. I baked them for 45 mins at 350 and they came out absolutely perfect consistency! They were moist and delicious with just the right amount of sweet. So yummy and will make again for sure!

I doubled the recipe, used 6 small bananas and no sweetener.  I baked it in an 8x8 pan and left it in the oven for 20 minutes longer.  It smelled AMAZING while baking. Came out a beautiful dark brown.  It was a bit more wet than I like even with the extra 20 minutes baking time, but the 2 extra bananas probably had something to do with that.  The flavor was wonderful and will definitely make it again in a 9x13 pan or as muffins to have more baking surface.  Very nice.

I wondered if these would be really heavy and dense, but they were just the opposite! I made the recipe into muffins and they were delicious! I added a streusel topping which made it even yummier!

Made this recipe into 11 muffins (works better than a loaf) with the following substitutes: 2 eggs and an extra egg white, 3/4 c of  fine almond flour and 1/4 cup of coconut flour to bind better, a third banana, 1/3 cup of almond milk instead of water, 1 tbsp of vanilla instead of almond paste, 1/4 c of honey instead of agave, added 1 teaspoon of baking powder with the baking soda, and a nice pinch of salt for contrast. Added 1/4 cup of mini chips to slightly dePaleo things for my husband, but otherwise kept it clean. Baked at 325 for a little over 30 minutes, until they had about a half inch of brown around the edges. They turned out moist, but not overly so, and got 5 stars from both my husband and my chef nephew, the FIRST time in my many efforts in Faileo Baking that the results did not go directly into the garbage. Thank you for posting this recipe! We need as many successful Paleo baking recipes as we can get!

I'm sorry, but I really dislike this recipe. I tried it twice, thinking I did something wrong the first time. After the second go, and read and re-read the recipe to make sure I didn't miss anything, but results were the same.

I agree with a previous reviewer. Cooked on the outside, but mushy, wet and spongey on the inside. I lowered the temperature and kept it in there for a total of an hour and half. Still the same texture on the inside. Not "dense" at all, just plain wet. I give up on this recipe and will find another. I also noticed that no one posted a recipe of what the bread looks like sliced...

I'll have to give this one another try.  I made it and it turned out really wet but it's my fault I think.  It looked very done on the outside, and when I put in a toothpick it came out clean.  I didn't want it to be too dry so I took it out 5 minutes early.  It stuck to the bottom of the pan (not the bread's fault - I need a new pan it happens all the time) and the inside looked like oatmeal.  So I put it back in and was able to salvage part of it.  The flavor is good, I just need to work on getting the "doneness" down.  Not the recipe's fault though.  The flavor is good and I think the texture would be good if it were done.

I made this for breakfast today and it was lovely. I followed the recipe except that I used maple syrup instead of agave and I used ground almonds instead of the almond flour. I left out the water because of all the reviews that say it is too wet. I used large bananas, which would produce a different result to small ones. I think with recipes like this where the consistency depends on fruit which is variable depending on size and ripeness it is best to judge how much liquid to add after you have added the fruit and other wet ingredients. I ended up with quite a thick batter, like a standard cake mixture. If I had added the water it would've been very thin. So my advice is to only add water if your batter is very thick once you have added all the other ingredients.

I did not like the consistency of the bread. It kind of "fell" so it was squished together. I am just learning to cook the Paleo way, so it is possible it was me!!

The texture is mealy and it's not that flavorful.  Very disappointed in this.  I took it out after 45 minutes and decided it wasn't done yet, so put it in for an additional 15 minutes.  The outside was golden brown, but inside is like oatmeal.

These turned out good for me.  I made them as muffins and used Pam Coconut Oil Cooking Spray to grease the pan. The texture was dense and the muffins slid right out of the pan when done.  I am not experienced at baking gluten or wheat free.  I did not have almond flour on hand, so I made the following substitutions and additions:  I used 1 Cup all-purpose gluten-free flour and 1 Cup Coconut flour for the almond flour, increased the eggs to 3 instead of 2, doubled the water (the coconut flour really soaked up the liquid), and added 1-1/2 tsps. xanthum gum.  I did not have vanilla bean paste so I omitted that.  The flavor was mainly lacking in sweetness, so I will make it again and add an extra banana and/or some fruit, like blueberries, dried cherries, etc. OR use a fruit juice or nut milk for the water.  I can see why some people suggested a topping for these.  I think maybe some nuts or seeds added would be nice as well.  These only took 32 minutes to bake.

I really enjoyed this recipe! It was about as good as it gets when it comes to paleo friendly breads. I would recommend using vanilla instead of almond,and an extra egg to make it less dry. I also added a little bit more cinnamon. I used the same recipe a second time, but used rhubarb and strawberries instead of bananas and it worked fine! but it is hard to make rhubarb tasty without using sugar, so it ended up a little tart.

Too much liquid!  After baking it for  45 minutes I put it back I the oven and baked it 20 minutes more.  The next morning I tried to cut it and it was very gooey inside so I placed it on foil and baked it 30 more minutes and it was still not done on the inside.

I have been making this for a year.  Very moist and tasty.  I use honey and applesauce instead of agave.  I now use mini loaf pans and/or muffin pans.  My kids love it!!

I loved this recipe. Thanks. 
I am new to the paleo diet and the muffins I made with this recipe totally helped me with my cravings for bread. 
I'm making more muffins today. 
:)
Yay.

i made muffins with this recipe. it was really good and hit the spot. I think next time i will use 4 bananas instead of 3. it was moist but outside was a little crispy. my fault, i'm sure, after reading reviews i added 10 mins so it would cook thoroughly and think i cooked it too much. we really enjoyed it and will make again without a doubt.

Not my favorite paleo BB recipe.  Try using Almond Butter and Sunflower Butter.  Adds a nice touch.

Very very moist. Tasted good. Initially, I didn't like the way it looked but after an hour, it looked and tasted great.  halfway through, was a bit darker than I'm used to and I thought it might be burning so I turned the temperature down to 325 for the rest of the time.  I added Walnuts and a bit of sour cream to it.

The easiest banana bread ever! It is easy, quick and delicious! Not overly sweet but that made it very special and a lot less calories! Family approved and rated with five stars!

The bread came out delicious -- my fiancee and I could not stop eating it and consumed the loaf within 24 hours!! It is VERY moist and falls apart. But if you're not married to the idea of what bread "should" look like (and you're not planning on spreading something on it or whatever), you will be verrrrry happy!

Have tried a few different Paleo breads. This one is a keeper! Moist and flavorful. Only change I made was using maple syrup instead of agave. Only drawback is there seems to be more almond flavor than banana. But still very tasty!

Made a couple of substitutions (honey for agave and vanilla extract for almond) since I was missing some ingredients but still turned out delicious. Whole family loved it.

Added fruit and nuts for variation. Love this recipe as a base because it's packed with nutrition. it seems to be a little too moist for me so I put less water.

I followed the recipe exactly and like the others it was runny.  I put it for another 25 mins at 425.  Still no luck.  I would suggest less water and make it into muffins for more cooking surface.

This turned out fantastic for me and I can't wait to experiment with other combinations. Based on other reviews I waited to see if I needed to add more liquid before adding the water and did not need to. I used maple syrup and vanilla as that is what I had on hand and I added walnuts for fun.

This was delicious and moist.  Texture is not doughy like traditional banana bread, more like a brownie texture.  Would work wonders as a dessert with ice-cream:) Used honey instead of Agave and used slightly less than a 1/4 cup as the banana's were very ripe.  I could reduce even more next time as it was still sweet but very enjoyable with a cup of tea!  Would definitely make this again.

I'm not sure what went wrong because I followed all of the instructions exactly and I reread them once I was finished to spot any errors but I couldn't find any mistakes but this recipe did not turn out. Looked great on the top and edges after 45 mins but when I flipped it onto a plate the inside was basically wet and even though I sprayed the pan it was all stuck to the bottom as well.

After reading the reviews I did add an extra banana. also substituted syrup as I did not have agave in the house.   used a scant teaspoon of both pure vanilla and almond extract.  Used large size muffins and they cooked in about 35 minutes.  They have a wonderful aroma.  Outside texture was a bit crunchy.  Inside  texture was great.  I should have oiled or sprayed the muffin papers because the muffins did stick.  If you are making these as a gluten free alternative I would drizzle with a cream cheese glaze for a little extra sweetness.  I will be making these again.  My 4 year old great granddaughter liked them as well.  I had gastric sleeve and half of one of these was great as I had been craving banana bread.

Just made these. Substituted 1/4c baking mix (zanthan gum in mix) and 1/4 c oat flour for almond flour. Used maple syrup and maybe an 1/8 c water and only 2 tsp cinn ( will use Tbls next time). The texture was beautiful. Did have to adjust baking time, as I baked in muffin pan,starting out at 20 minutes and adding as needed. Maybe another 7 minutes. Will definitely make again.

I doubled the recipe, added two more bananas, an extra egg for moisture and 1/2 c coconut flour to sweeten it a bit.  Came out great!  Made in mini loaf pans and stored in ziplock bags in the fridge for multiple breakfasts.

Based off some of the reviews I decided to make these in to muffins. They turned out great. I don't know why so many people complained, my husband and I thought they were delicious. The texture is obviously going to be slightly different.

I've made this four times now! Absolutely love it.  The only change I made was that I used honey instead of agave.  I also added semi-sweet chocolate chunks to one of the loaves and it was great.  Will continue to make this recipe for sure.

This is good. I added some thawed dark cherries (made sure to fully drain them first) and I used muffin tins instead of a loaf pan. I look forward to making this again, maybe with apples.

I made the following changes - Substituted almond extract with vanilla extract. Used unsweetened vanilla almond milk instead of water. Used 1/4 tsp liquid stevia instead of agave syrup.  I also used 3 ripe bananas instead of 2 and added a little nutmeg. If came out fantasic! Super moist and yummy, my so not clean eating hubby loved it too.

Smells delicious while it's cooking and tastes great, but I would add a bit more sweetener and maybe some oats or something to give it a bit drier consistency, as mine came out a bit on the wet side. My first time cooking gluten free so I'm sure I'll improve in time!

I thought this turned out pretty good. It was my first time using almond flour. I used vanilla extract, no almond extract, and sprinkled chopped walnuts on top. I added a little extra flour because the mixture was so wet. It baked through in about 50 minutes and tented with foil for the last 10. My bread collapsed, but still tasted good, mostly of cinnamon, not much banana. I also used some nutmeg, too.

Made this for nice after dinner treat. Made it to recipe except for the paste and used maple syrup instead of agave, then added 1/2 cup of coconut and a half cup of dried cranberries. It turned out awesome! Definitely making quite a bit for the holidays, possibly double the recipe and make a bunt style bread.

Made a few substitutes: didn't use water or almond extract. Used 2 TBSP of Stevia instead of agave syrup. Since this was a dry product, added 1 TSP of vanilla and I had three small ripe bananas. No vanilla paste either. Yes I did add a few dark chocolate chips. But it was moist and awesome!!

Very moist and dense with a great flavor. I used honey instead of agave nectar and vanilla extract instead of almond (using what I had available in my cabinet). I also added two tablespoons of raw sugar and a tsp of sea salt. Very tasty!

I followed the recipe exactly, but mine fell apart when I tried to take it out of the pan. I was way too moist.(yes I did oil my pan)Maybe it's my almond flour.  It's Bob's Red Mill Almond meal/flour.   The taste was excellent.  It's the first bread I had in 3 weeks. I will try it again when I find almond flour.
