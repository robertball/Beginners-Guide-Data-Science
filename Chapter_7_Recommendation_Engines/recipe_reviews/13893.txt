My fiance and I really enjoyed this... but I made some changes based on what other reviewers said.  First of all, I made 16 servings instead of 8 and froze half. It froze and reheated really well!  I would definitely recommend this.  It is so easy to go ahead and double the recipe, and a huge time-saver b/c of all the vegetables you have to chop.  Secondly, I added more vinegar to mine... I felt it gave the recipe more of the characteristic sloppy joes flavor.  I went ahead and added twice the amount.  I also only added 1/2 the amount of chili powder the recipe calls for, and 1/2 the amount of black pepper.  I like spicy stuff, but all that pepper was still a little too overpowering for my tastes and it took away from the other flavors in the recipe.

Overall, this is really filling and even sort of fun to eat too, especially with the kaiser rolls!

"The best vegetarian food I have EVER tasted"..."A meat lover's perfect non-meat meal"... those were some of the wonderful things my boyfriend was saying as he was eating his. He was almost in shock at how great they were (he's a carnivore at heart). I thought they were spectacular as well... and being a vegetarian myself, I was able to appreciate them even more. I made a few alterations to the recipe though... my favorite alteration was using a red pepper instead of a green pepper. I think it added just a tiny bit of sweetness to an otherwise super-spicy dish. It also livened it up with more red color. I left out the celery because I didn't have any, but truthfully, I think it wouldn't have been as good with it. Since I didn't have any diced tomatoes, I added 2, 8oz cans of tomato sauce (which I think was a wonderful substitution). I also followed previous suggestions not to put in so much chili powder, so I put in 1 1/2 teaspoons instead of 1 1/2 tablespoons. This was absolutely the right decision. Even a drop more chili powder and it would have been way too spicy. The best part was that my boyfriend was complaining when he was done that he was too full. That is by far the biggest compliment of them all, because he's rarely full after eating a vegetarian meal. This is DEFINITELY becoming a staple in my diet. I couldn't be more pleased.

I doubled the recipe, oh my, way much more than needed.  Good recipe.  I gave 5 stars as it is hard to find healthy recipes that taste pleasing. This is one and it deserves 5 stars.  I added a bit of tomato puree as i wanted a stronger tomato flavor and cut back a bit on the chili powder as previously recommended and i ended up with an excellent sloppy joe.  Thanks for helping me to cook fabulous vegetarian dishes.  Alongside a green salad with walnuts, this is a great nutritious meal.  Definately in my new recipe file of things to make over and over.

Made this a couple of nights ago and, yes, it IS delish!  I didn't have any kaiser rolls though, so we just ate them on wheat buns like normal sloppy joes.  My dad couldn't put his finger on it, but he's never tasted anything quite like this stuff.  I'm surprised at how spicy it was-- usually I leave pepper and added salt out, but I was afraid this would be bland, so at t?e last minute I went ahead and added the black pepper.  Wooo-EEE!  It's not terribly spicy, but I think it would be perfectly tasty with a little less.  I'm returning  to dorm life tomorrow, but I will make this again next time I am home.  Right now I am eating the left overs over brown rice and topped with light cheddar cheese.  It's pretty good!

This recipe was delicious and very filling.  All the other vegetarian Sloppy Joe recipes I tried had TVP or veggie ground round, and they were too rich and not filling.  I think the 1 1/2 tablespoons of chili powder in the recipe was too much; next time I'll reduce it to 1 1/2 teaspoons.  The recipe was easy to follow and this makes a great meal with a large, green salad.  Even my husband was filled up by two rolls and the Unsloppy Joe mix, and he doesn't fill up easily! I will definitely make this again.  Thanks, Karen.

This is great! Even my carnivore husband found them delicious and has asked for them again.  I play around with the spices to suit our tastes. I add more chili powder and a couple of dashes worcestershire sauce to darken the flavor. I also leave out the celery since we hate celery.  I serve it on regular hamburger buns with mustard and chips on the side.  Have already made this recipe several times and will continue to do so.  Thanks!

I made this dish for a lunch get together with a bunch of moms and it received rave reviews.  I served it over rice and lessened the chili powder to 1 tbsp.  I prefer it over the real sloppy joe anyday.

My boyfriend couldn't eat this;  he said that it tasted of nothing but chili pepper.  I thought that it was all right but I don't think I'll make it again.

This was good, but way more like a veggie chili than a sloppy joe. I loved how inexpensive it was. I already had the spices, onion and celery, bought everything else and some nice big wheat rolls for around $8.00. It also went well in a wheat pita for smaller portions. Also it was just as good as a leftover.

Definitely needs cheese added to make it stick together a little better.  I added Monterrey Jack and that was a great finishing touch.  Otherwise, it ends up much like just putting chili on a bun.

Very tasty and filling. If you finely dice or even brunoise the veggies, the texture more closely resembles ground beef and binds better. My changes: 1/2 c chopped red bell pepper, 1 1/2 TEAspoonsof chili powder, 2 T tomato paste, 2 T vinegar, and added 1 T brown sugar and 1 T mustard. Yummmmm

This recipe was easy and turned out pretty well. I love the vinegar in it, it definitely gives it a "meatier" flavor. I found it a little bit uninteresting in flavor, I think it needed a little salt (maybe if you use salted beans it works out?). Anyhow, that mostly just MY salt addiction talking! It was fine- a bit like a vinegary vegetarian chili.

I made a couple changes- out of necessity, I used canned black beans instead of kidney beans. I think the texture of kidney beans would have been better, but the black beans were nice, too.

A also reduced the amount of chili powder as many reviewers suggested- I wish I hadn't! I kept tasting and adding more and more. Different chili powders have different levels of heat! I used a blend of two types of chili powder, one that is incredibly mild with a nice chili flavor, and an ancho chile one that is spicier. My joe mix wasn't very spicy at all... I don't know of some of the reviewers are sensitive to spice or something, because I would have had to use a pretty hot chili powder to make it too spicy to enjoy. A teaspoon of black pepper also didn't really add much heat.

Anyhow, know your chili powder, and add the full amount if it is a milder one, or reduce the amount if you're using a hot powder. (And don't accidentally use Cayenne chili powder- that'll probably burn your mouth right off if you use much of it!)

I actually wasn't much of a fan of this recipe, I'm sorry. It was too much like a really bland chili, and didn't taste like sloppy joes to me. The only thing I did differently was using about twice the garlic. I think I prefer my veg sloppy joes with lentils instead.

This was a pretty good recipe.  We used only 1 tsp of the chili powder.  It would be great with melted cheddar on top.  It also works well on its own or with rice.

The recipe was delicious.  Hopefully you read the comments beforehand and use only a teaspoon of chili powder and not tablespoon.  That would be way to much, I also added in the same amount of brown sugar that I added in of chili powder, simmered for 3 hours and it was simply delicious and had a surprisingly similar taste to Manwich.

I made this recipe twice.  The second time I substituted 1/2 of a package of chili seasoning for the chili powder (waaaay too much chili powder for our taste), used a tablespoon of catsup instead of opening a can of tomato paste and using only one tablespoon, and served it in homemade bread bowls.  It's a great, filling vegetarian meal on a cold winter night.

I think this recipe is incredible! Even my fiance, who is not a veg, adores it. I do cut down on the chili powder by half, though, and it's plenty spicy for us.

YUM! Based on reviews, I used 1 tablespoon of chili powder, a splash extra of vinegar, and a red pepper instead of green since I had that on hand. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of Worcestershire, which I might add more of next time. Might also try it with the full amount of chili powder as it wasn't too spicy.

I had it over brown rice instead of buying rolls and that worked well!

It was DELICIOUS overall, especially as a cheap, quick,  vegetarian, healthy dish.. definitely making again. (Note we are not vegetarian and loved it!)

I was very disappointed in this recipe as written. The texture was great and I was excited to find a vegetarian recipe that didn't call for TVP but the flavor on this one just wasn't there. It basically tasted like tomato paste with a chili powder after taste. Once I added some BBQ sauce, the flavor greatly improved. The next time I make this, I'll use all of the same veggies but use BBQ sauce and catchup!

Very tasty. Serving size is exaggerated though. It says 8 servings, but it'll only serve 2 as a main dish.

The name is deceiving.  These don't taste anything like sloppy joes.  They taste more like stuffed pepper filling or a vegeterarian chili.  I threw the leftovers away.

Way better than I expected. I halved the chili powder like everyone else, added some cholula chipotle hot sauce and smoke seasoning and toasted sourdough rolls with butter on one side and mozerella on the other...delicious!

I loved this recipe! I couldn't believe how close the sauce tasted to meaty sloppy joes, it was perfect! I used red wine vinegar instead of white vinegar, but that was the only change I made.  I would definitely use this recipe again and I highly recommend it.

This recipe reminded me of the sloppy joes that my mother-in-law used to make. I thought it came out quite well. I followed the other reviewers recommendations and doubled the amount of onion, green pepper, carrots and garlic. I skipped the celery and added a red pepper for that. I also left the amount of kidney beans stay the same. I used 6 fresh roma tomatoes rather than canned. Finally, I used about 1.25 tablespoons of chili powder and cut the amount of black pepper to about 1/4 teaspoon. This is a very fast recipe to prepare and I will definitely make it again in the future. Thanks, KDCG for sharing it.

I have made this probably five or six times since discovering this recipe a little while back.  This has to be one of my favorite vegetarian recipes ever.  I always double the recipe because everyone fights over the leftovers.  It is absolutely delicious.  The only thing I do different is to use a little less chili powder, since we don't like things too spicy.  I serve it with homemade bread bowls, sliced olives, shredded cheddar and a dollop of sour cream. Even my husband who insists every meal needs some sort of meat enjoys this.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a wonderful spin on regular sloppy joes. Like other reviews suggested I cut back on the chili powder to 1 tsp. I just felt like 1 1/2 tbsp was a lot. I didn't add the carrots either, but I doubled the other veggies to about a cup each. I confess that I did add a lb of ground beef so that way my husband would eat it. I also added a splash of worcestershire sauce, a tbsp of soy sauce and about a 1/2 cup of ketchup. That really gave it the sweetness that it needed and helped hold it together more. BTW - It was great the next morning with a fried egg and hashbrowns on top served open face. :) Will definitely make this again. Thanx!

I wanted to like this more than I did, but gave it 4 stars b/c my MEAT eating husband thought it was good and that is always a big plus in my book! It did get better the next day when flavors had a chance to mingle a little more... but I also added after the recipe was done(b/c I wasn't really happy with it) so I'm not sure if it was the additions or the actual recipe. Again, the hubby liked it a lot, so I will be making it again. Thanks!

Good base for sloppy joes but a little too much like chili... instead of tomato paste, I mashed some of the beans and that seemed to thicken without adding too much tomato flavor. By the end, I probably added all the chili powder and was still ransacking the spice cabinet as it was missing something. However, it was totally edible as there were no leftovers.

We did not think this tasted like Sloppy Joe's at all.  (We've never had real homemade sloppies, though.  We always eat Manwhich.) I'm thinking about trying a version using the veggies suggested here, but using Manwhich instead of making out own sauce.  We may like that because it wasn't the veggies we had an issue with, it was the sauce.  As the recipe is written, it only gets two stars from me.  We will never make the sauce again, but I'm holding out judgement on the veggie portion...

I really liked these. My family thought they were just ok.  I added some ketchup, BBQ sauce, and a little mustard to mine to give it a kick since other reviewers said it was kind of boring.  Served it on whole wheat hamburger buns.

Underwhelming.  Needs more seasoning and does not resemble the sloppy joe's I grew up eating, in taste.

Not as good as I had hoped.  Maybe needs a spoonful of sugar added or some prepared barbeque sauce.

My husband and I are trying to eat healthier meals without missing out on our favorites.  This recipe was really good.  The kids liked it and I thought it was filling and even tastier than regular sloppy Joe's.  We really enjoyed this.

LOVE this recipe. I cut down the chili powder to suite our needs and also added a can of white kidney beans. I see this becoming a staple in our house.

Not too bad as a vegetarian chili but definitely did not taste anything like Sloppy Joes to us.  I used half of the chili powder, as suggested by other members and it still ended up being overly spicy for our tastes.

I used 1 1/2 tsp chili powder, halved the black pepper, doubled the vinegar, and use red and yellow peppers rather than green peppers.  I really liked this but my sister didn't.  Worth a try, though, definitely.

My boyfriend and I both enjoyed this recipe as is; the amount of chili powder did not seem overwhelming to either of us.  I give this recipe a four because it did not work well as a sloppy joe, and really, I'd call this a veggie chili recipe and make it again but skip the bread.

As written, the recipe's flavor was not exactly what I like in a sloppy joe. The few changes I made took care of that. I increased the garlic to 2 cloves, decreased the chili powder to 1 TBS., increased the vinegar to 2 TBS., and added about 1 1/2 TBS. sugar. This took away some of the heat and acidity and created a slightly sweet and sour flavor.

I made this recipe the other night.  It was okay for the hubby and I but my Kids did NOT enjoy it.  It would have been okay if I didn't use the pepper or chili pepper.  I even cut down the amount and it was still to much.  I think I could make this again for the fam if I take cut most of the pepper out.  The veggis add the flavor it needs as well as the vinegar... Overall it was good though!

This was one of my first attempts at a vegetarian dish. I really liked it.  I would suggest less chili powder but that is a personal perference.  I also added some mustard, a little Worcestershire sauce and a tad of ketchup.  Next time, I am going to try red bell peppers in addition to the green bell peppers.  Overall, a nice intro to vegetarian fare!

I would say the flavor was great but I expected it to be more soupy than it was - therefore I added extra vinegar and even a bit of water.  I also added a bit of ketchup and bbq sauce as recommended below.  I liked the idea of eating it out of a roll though - next time, I'd probably just find a recipe for vegetarian chili.

I made a simplified version of this: no carrots, celery, vinegar, or peppers and garlic powder instead of minced garlic.  I doubled the beans.  This cut the cooking time down to about 10 minutes.  It was VERY spicy, but my boyfriend (a non-vegetarian) and I loved it.  This is  definitely a keeper!!!

I made this last night. I thought it was okay. I did accidentally use too much tomato paste so it may have been better if I had used less. My husband thought it was okay and said he'd eat it again if I made it. My friend said the same thing. It was a lot of cutting up of vegetables for less than rave reviews. I may try it again some day with less paste, but only if I'm chopping veggies anyway.

People are afraid to eat my cooking, and rightly so.  This was so easy and looked good with some sharp cheddar topping.  Healthy, easy dish.  Also, I love spicy food, so the chili pepper was just right.  Could even have used more.

Pretty good!  I reduced the chili powder to one and one half teaspoons since other reviewers said it was too much.

Pretty good for a quick vegetarian dinner.  But nothing fantastic.  I served with flour tortillas and cheddar cheese.  I also cut back on the pepper by half and only used 1T of chili powder and it was plenty spicy.

We both loved this recipe.  Both my meat-eater husband and myself.  I went ahead and just put the mix on onion rolls, not being very concerned about sloppiness.  It is EXTREMELY filling and hearty for a vegetarian dish.

Very tasty and easy to make! The carrots didn’t sound appealing to me so I left them out. Everything Else I made like the recipe. While the beans cooked in the sauce I mashed about half with a wooden spoon to get a more beef like consistency. Very delicious!

This recipe is a winner. My twin two-year-olds gobbled it down, and my husband asked that it be put into our weekly rotation. It was really easy, too! I added a bit of worchestershire sauce and some brown sugar to give it a more "authentic" taste (my mom used those ingredients in her sloppy joes). I also added a bit of cornstarch mixed with warm water at the end, to thicken it up and give it the right consistency. Really tasty!

As written, this is not good. As many reviwers commented, the chili powder is overpowering. I made some alterations and enjoyed the results: I halved the chili powder, and doubled the vinegar. I also added about 1/2 tsp of worcestershire sauce and about 1 tsp of honey. We enjoyed it on open faced sandwiches with a slice of provalone.
Will make again, might try adding a little more tomato, and experiment with other veggies!

I liked this a lot.  Was easy, inexpensive and the family ate every last bite.  I used French bread buns as that is what I had on hand.  reminded me of a chili bowl kinda thing...but since I love those too, this hit the spot on a cool October evening.  thank you for sharing....will be making this again.

Pretty good, but I would make some changes next time. I would not use as much of the diced tomatoes, I'd use ketchup instead of tomato paste, and maybe add some mustard and increase the vinegar. The idea is really great, I enjoyed it mostly because it used beans rather than TVP or some other meat substitute. I'd cut back on the pepper, not because I can't take spicy stuff (I love it) but because cutting down on the pepper balances the flavors more. Thanks for sharing your recipe, will be making it again!

Awesome.  New to the vegetarian thing, and this recipe was amazing.  We added some BBQ sauce in addition to the vinegar, because we like alot of tang in our sloppy joes.  Absolutely make this!

These should definitely not be titled "unsloppy" haha they were fun to eat though! I also added red pepper as I read in a review, the cheese makes it stick together better, but I also think it's too juicy in the beginning I would drain the tomatoes and cook the carrots before anything else.  Balsamic vinegar instead of white really tastes amazing too!

3 stars for being edible and something new, but not one of our favorites.  We are vegetarians, but like to try vegan dishes; however, when I got to the last step, I had to add fake meat crumblers trying to give it some substance.  Doing this made it too dry, so a word to the wise, if you are adding fake beef, add more than one can of tomatoes.  I also used just 2 tsp's of chili powder based on other reviews and the spiciness was not overpowering.  Vegan, yes... delicious, not quite.

This did not pass the test for myself and hubby and 3 kids. I think we all are used to the sloppy joes with meat and it just didn't come close to the texture or taste for us.

Delicious! I am a vegetarian and a lazy cook, so finding easy recipes that I can make is a challenge. This was perfect. I did omit the onions, but followed the recipe exactly. It was so good I made it 2 nights in a row! This will definitely be added to my recipe rotation.

I thought this meal was delicious! Easy to make, filling and tasty. My children loved it! I added more vinegar and tomato paste to the receipe and more of the veggies. My kids like to eat it on a hotdog bun! I did not miss the meat in this typically meaty meal.

This is great! Spicy but great. I honestly don't think it tastes much like sloppy joe's but I am certainly not complaining! It somehow reminds my of a shrimp curry dish my dad made when I was a kid.

I added a little bit of Worcester sauce to make these taste more sloppy-joe-ish; some liquid smoke might be good too.  Other than that, very delicious.  My boyfriend ate 3 before he noticed they were meatless!

This was a great dish.  We did find that the spices were way too much.  We will have to cut back a lot when we make this again.  Once you got past the heat it was very good.  Will make it again for sure!

Not a hit, but I thought they were good. I sprinkled a little bit of sugar on my portion which took the bite off the off taste from the tomato paste.

This was fairly easy and quick, but not my favorite. I used a food processor to chop up the vegetables, which made it easier. Next time I will add some vegetable stock to the vegetables to make sure they do so more evenly. I used cayenne pepper because I didn't have any chili powder and it was way too spicy for me, so I had to add cheese and sour cream to counteract this (which made it more palatable but considerably less healthy). It definitely needed some form of salt to counteract the spice. My boyfriend, who much prefers meat, enjoyed it, though.

I think this recipe is fab. I've made it for a few years now and it makes a great base - I put spices out and let everyone make it as spicy or hot as they want. Cheap, nutritious, filling. Great for a cold autumn or winter evening!

Used italian seasoning vinegar instead of white vinegar and increased it a bit. I didn't have tomato paste so I used same amount of tomato sauce. Simmered uncovered to reduce the amount of liquid. Turned out great, would recommend adding cheese as another reviewer suggested.

This was pretty great.  I did not use chili powder, but added just a light dust of cayenne.  I used red wine vinegar instead (didn't have regular white), but it tasted great!  I mashed the beans slightly to get a better texture, which I am glad I did!  I also added a handful of monterey jack cheese to bind it together.  It is a bit like veggie chili on a bun, but no complaints here!  Next time I will add a little TVP for texture.

Great recipe! Even my meat-eating family loves it! As recommended by others, I reduced the amount of chili powder and increased the amount of vinegar. I also added a sweetener (agave nectar and a touch of stevia) some prepared mustard, and salt. I also added some chicken broth one time for depth. Truly a yummy meal.

Wish I would have read the reviews because it was a little warm and I had already cut back on the pepper and chili pepper because I was serving it to a four an five year old. Otherwise, I loved it (and the crazy 4 year old who was fanning his tongue and saying, "oh yeah mom, I like it!"). It was very substantial and easy. I may rough chop the beans the next time to help mimic the texture of sloppy joes a bit more, but I will definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious! Lightly mashing the beans gave the mixture a nice meaty texture. I also added 1T Thai chili sauce to give a little sweet to the spicy. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was good, but nothing to write home to mom about.  I like that it is really simple to make, and I had all ingredients on hand, so it's a good pantry-ready recipe (hence the four stars). I zipped my tomatoes in a blender a few seconds to make it less chunky.  I left everything else the same.  My chili powder must be pretty mild, or I like it more than other people, because I didn't have a problem with the amount.  Definitely top with sharp cheddar (and tabasco if you like some heat).  ***I still won't write home to Mom about this, but this recipe has become a staple in my home.  I eat it all the time now.  Thanks for a great little sandwich recipe that doesn't use faux-meat.

This is a great recipe!  I too "tweaked" it a little, added more garlic, used balsamic vinegar and a little less chili powder.  My husband, A huge meat eater LOVED it.  I took the left over mix and used it with spaghetti the next night and that was AWSOME!

Yummy!I now prefer this to the meat version. Instead of trying to regulate the seasoning combo, I cheated and used McCormick's sloppy joe mix and it is just perfect. I also added mushrooms to give it a "meaty" bite.

This was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I only added in 1 tablespoon of chili. 1 1/2 would have been way too much. I will be making this again for sure!

Update: I had plenty of leftovers because I ended up eating this by myself; my boyfriend said it was no substitute for sloppyjoes (I disagreed) but that it might make a good spaghetti sauce. So today that is what I did with the left overs. I put them back on the stove in the pot and began reheating, added 1/3 cup of water, 2 tblsp of the tomato paste, 2 tblsp of olive oil, 1/2 tsp. each of garlic powder and oregano, and a large pinch each of ground thyme and parsley, then I put it over cooked pasta. I used egg noodles because that is all I had on hand at the time, but I think it would be even better on angel hair, or shells even as a form of goulash. To top it off I added parmesan cheese. My boyfriend was actually right about something! It came out really well.

Didn't even use any tomato paste or celery. Instead, used 1 green bell pepper and only 1/2 freshly diced tomato. For spices, I used paprika, cumin, red pepper, black pepper, salt, and dinosaur barbecue cajun spice (in amounts that seasoned the mixture to my personal tastes). When everything was in skillet, one must "mash" the beans with spatula in order to get more of a sloppy joe like texture. I added white wine vinegar to mixture sparingly and slowly, otherwise it tends to cover up the other spices. After making these changes, the recipe was amazing. It's a keeper!

I've made this twice now, and I really love it. I do find chopping the veggies kind of tedious, but it has to be done. I have been leaving out the celery and vinegar just because I don't like those things, and I've been adding cayenne pepper along with the chili powder because I love spicy! Its definitely a hearty sandwich, and it keeps well, too.

Wonderful surprise this recipe turned out to be!  My husband loved it too, although he said his taste buds were slightly disappointed in that it does not taste anything like "real" sloppy joes, more like chili served on a bun.  But such a healthy alternative, jaded taste buds or not this recipe is a keeper!  I followed the recipe exactly, I didn't think it was too spicy.  =)

This was a great vegetarian recipe. I cut back to 1 tbls of the chili pepper and I used diced tomatoes with green chilis in them. I also added a little sugar to balance out the pepper. Great the next morning in an omlet.

This was pretty good the night I made it, but very good the day after!  I guess it needs some time to sit.  I used the food processor to get the veggies chopped up pretty fine, and left out the peppers.  I also added some mustard, because that is how I always make sloppy joes.

This was NOT good as a sandwich.  It was very good when I had the leftovers the next day by itself with no bread.  I would make this again and serve it over rice.  I would not use the garlic.  Too much!

This recipe was very tasty.  To thicken up the consistancy, I added one can of drained kidney beans at the same time as the tomatoes, cooked for 5-10 minutes, mashed slightly, and then added a second can of kidney beans.  This gave a really nice, thick consistancy.

We ate these open face on crusty rolls topped with shredded cheese and pickled jalapenos.

We love this recipe! It's a great way to offer beans and veggies to kids and non-vegetarians, and it's super tasty!

I leave out the vinegar-- personal preferance-- but overall, this is an awesome meal which pops up in our menu on a regular basis. Thanks!

These turned out pretty good. Reading some of the other reviews, I halved the amount of chili powder. It was still pretty spicy that way, so next time, I  will use even less. I also ended up adding one tablespoon of BBQ sauce, since something just seemed to be "missing". That made it perfect. Fun recipe and kids will love it!

Maybe a little too spicy for some.  Reduce the chili powder and black pepper, if you don't want a the full spicy effect.

I tried the changes in another review, more vinegar, halved the chili powder and pepper and it had just enough spice for me. The double vinegar was a good idea
My husband and I both thought the dish was okay, but missing something.  I did not read all the reviews, but may try it again if I find a review with suggestions on what can be added to the recipe.

We have been making this and loving it for years. I always double, as it freezes well and is a tasty and nutritious meal. I add more tomato paste because, well, tomato paste is yummy, and it adds even more flavor. Well recommended for anyone looking for an easy veggie meal.

I made this yesterday and had I rated it then, I would have said pretty good.  However, I brought it for lunch and after a day, it was delicious!  Thank you for the recipe.

I tried it with kidney beans, and it sucked. So I tried it a second time and only changed the sort of beans I used. I mushed up some northern beans and mixed it with the paste, and then I threw in whole black beans. It was MUCH better this way.

This was spicier than I was expecting and didn't taste anything like the sloppy joe mix in a can that I grew up with.  I liked it best not on a bun but over potatoes with a little cheddar on top to offset the spiciness.

Quick & great for ur spouse who's not keen on being vegetarian. Used 2 8oz. cans of tomato sauce instead of diced tomatos. Definetly eased up on chilli powder. Used potato rolls, & it was amazing! Not too many changes like other recipes-so gave it 5 stars. Make about once a wk on busy nights

I am super impressed with this recipe it was wonderful! Filling to eat and fast to make. I mistakenly grabbed a can of basil, garlic and oregano diced tomatoes but it still tastes great! I think I may use it every time. Also, my husband decided we should not scoop out our whole wheat rolls. A new recipe to use with out meat!! Thank you so much for sharing.

I doubled this recipe. Instead of celery, I added zucchini, fresh tomatoes instead of canned, 2 1/2 tablespoon of vinegar, and only 1 1/2 tablespoon of chili powder(for a double recipe). I also added two masala veggie burgers for extra flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was quick and easy to make and tasted very good. I like that it uses everyday ingredients, nothing unusual that I wouldn't normally have on hand.  I served it open-faced on half a bun to cut back on bread. My husband liked it too so I'll will probably be making this again.

I enjoyed this recipe to the fullest. I followed the directions, then added a bit more tomato paste based on another review. After a taste test I decided to add a bit of salt and two spoons of open pit bar-b-q sauce because I've always enjoyed the bold flavor bar-b-q sauce brings to sloppy joes. Finally, I topped it off with shredded cheese. Tasty and Filling!

These were really good, however I wouldn't go into these thinking they will taste like sloppy joes.  They taste like vegetarian chili, but it was still a great recipe!

I'm a really picky eater and didn't like this. But I'm also able to see what most people WOULD like and the other people who ate with me weren't picky eaters. To them, this was a decent recipe but nothing really special. They mentioned that they'd omitt the carrots. I probably won't be making this again.

Caution: VERY SPICY!  I made this for an early Sunday dinner today, and my husband and I only had a few bites of our sandwiches before we concluded that it was just too spicy to enjoy.  I have decided to make a second batch tomorrow ~ sans the pepper and chili powder ~ and combine it with today's batch.  I have plenty of veggies leftover, and I don't want all this food to go to waste.  If I am unable to tame the spice, we will not be able to eat it.  I will probably make it again in the future, but with about 2/3 less chili powder.

We absolutely Loved this dish! It was a great way to get my picky toddler to eat her veggies. However, I would recommend bringing the heat down if feeding it to a child. Though my little girl ate all of it, she also was gulping down water like there was no tomorrow.

At first I thought this would just be an okay dish to try just for the heck of it...I had no idea it was going to be such a hit. I served this on "everything" topped buns with sliced jalapenos and sharp cheddar and OM it was soooo good. Check the seasoning as you go on this (as on every recipe really, everyone's tastes are different) and that will probably save you from over doing it.

So good! I added more vinegar (1.5T total) because that's really what gives it that sloppy joe flavor. I didn't see a problem with the chili powder, but went light on the black pepper. I only made one batch and it was way too little.  Overall, really really good, and easy! Thanks for the recipe!

this was great.  My family is never excited about vegetarian night, but since I'm a vegetarian we do it once a week.  They loved this one.  We will definately make it often and double the recipe from now on.

It was very tasty.  I prefer it over rice than on a bun, though.  Despite it's tastiness and health benefits, however, mine tasted nothing whatsoever like sloppy joes, hence the three stars.

definitely a very yummy and healthy veg sloppy joe recipe! i have used veggie "meat" and manwich sauce in the past, but i think this is WAY better because you control the ingredients (especially the sodium, which can get so high with all prepackaged food!) and i love using fresh veggies and beans. i prepared dry kidney beans instead of using canned beans(again less sodium). i also greatly decreased the black & chili pepper amount, and kept adding vinegar until i liked the taste. i added a pinch of brown sugar too. it made a bunch, so i think i might try freezing half as another reviewer suggested. great recipe!

Good recipe. I added a tablespoon of agave nectar and a few tablespoons of barbecue sauce. Next time I will try it with lentils instead of kidney beans.

I really liked this! I agree with some of the other reviews, it's basically chili on a bun, but the flavor was more like a sloppy joe. I definitely cut out a lot of the chili powder, this calls for way too much.  My only other problem was the servings.  It may have filled 8 buns, but this recipe only fed three relatively petite college kids [two girls, one guy].

This is the best recipe I have used from allrecipes.  No doubt.  I rarely make it exactly to specifications because I just use what I have around.  It is still great every time!  I even made it for my non-vegetarian parents and they loved it!

This recipe was good, but it would have been better with less chili powder.  I added mozzarella to the mix, which helped it stick together much better.

We love this recipe!  The only things I change/add is to replace the tomato paste with a healthy squeeze of ketchup (just because I don't usually keep a tube of paste on hand for smaller amts) and I also add about 1 tsp salt.  I do cut down a little on the chili powder, but not much since I think it adds to the whole "sloppy joe" flavor of this dish.  We like to serve it with cheddar cheese and pickles on the buns...Mmmm! Super easy, super tasty, and healthy!

I really liked this. We are trying to add more veggies to our diet and this recipe really kept us full for a long time. Plus we have a vegan sister-in-law and I will try this when she comes over.

This was great.  A little to much chili powder for my taste, I would cut it back to 1 instead of 1 1/2.  My girlfriend and I used hoggie buns then topped it with shredded colbyjack cheese and tosted them at 450 for about 5 minutes to add a nice finish to them.

These were really good.  I served them open face on a toasted wheat hamburger bun...not "hallowed".  I also cut back a little on the chili powder, they were pretty spicy.  This recipe actually made 4 servings for us.

I could eat this every day, twice a day. I love love this recipe, it's healthy, tasty and you can store some in the freezer for another day (or for dinner!). I made it pretty bare minimum, all the ingredients fresh but no vinegar, no tomato paste, and fresh raw tomatoes, not canned. It is so delicious.

One of my all time favorite vegetarian recipes.  I always make a double batch because it goes quickly, even with my husband, who normally despises vegetarian food.  The first time I made this recipe, the two of us ate it in one sitting.  I use a mild chili powder and 3/4 t pepper, otherwise it's way too spicy for our household.

My partner and I really enjoyed this recipe. He ate 3.5 sandwiches! We are always looking for good vegetarian recipes. I did decrease the amount of chili pepper to 1 tbsp. From reading the instructions, I plan to double the recipe next time so that I can freeze the leftovers.

I am glad I read the reviews about altering the spices, we have sensitive mouths around here!  I halved the spices, doubled the vinegar and garlic. Delish! My carniverous father also enjoyed it.

We didn't use this for sandwiches, but it made a great topping for baked potatoes! I lessened the chili powder and black pepper by 1/2 per other suggestions and used a mix of colors of peppers. I also doubled the vinegar and since I didn't have tomato paste, I put in two tablespoons of tomato sauce. 
The baked potatoes and a salad on the side made a very filling and nutritious meal.

Good enough to make again.  I made it just like the recipe said except I used whole grain buns.  I felt like it was missing something, but it's a great basic to play with.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was so excited about this recipe but it did not come up to my expectations.  I am still looking for a good veggie sloppy Joe recipe...perhaps I will use the lentil meatloaf recipe and do sloppy Joes the next night.

I really did not care for this recipe, and neither did my family. I cut the chili powder way back, but it still didn't make it taste right. I think it needed more beans, maybe with another can of kidney beans mashed up? Not sure how to salvage it, really. We ate it, but I probably won't make it again.

I'd suggest cutting back on the tomato and adding some additional spices as it tasted a good deal like marinara after made.

As many others have said, this recipe is absolutely delicious.  What I love the most about it is that it's so customizable to personal taste and you can pretty much make it any way you want, but works great as a general guideline.  Thanks for adding this recipe!

This is a great veggie sloppy joe recipe, although there is nothing unsloppy about them.  I omitted celery (didn't have) and didn't follow measure, I just used 1 onion, 2 big carrots, i green pepper, etc.  used balsamic vinegar instead of white, and added 3 or 4 tbsp tomato paste to make it more sloppy joe-ish, and I added 2 tbsp brown sugar.  So even tho I totally altered it; it was a great guideline for making a great vegetarian dish!  Thank you

These were great! A really nice alternative to the normal meaty, messy Joe. I used red onion. The scooped out kaiser bread made a great bread pudding.

This is just how I remember sloppy joes, minus the meat, of course.

god, this is so good.  i, like other reviewers, halved the chili powder.  i also added a little bit more tomato paste.  this needs a liiittle bit of salt, but other than that, totally delicious and incredibly easy to make!

I also gave this recipe 5 stars because it is hard to find a vegetarian dish that everyone in my family likes. I realized at the last minute I was out of chili powder so I substituted 1/4 t. cayenne pepper and 1/4 t. cumin.  Since regular sloppy joes have a sweet undertone I added 1T. honey. After cooking I felt it needed a little more sauce so I squeezed in 2T or so of catsup.  I spooned it on the rolls and put a slice of cheese on top and slide it under the broiler.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is really easy, tasty, and takes little time!  I decreased the chili powder to 2 tsp and it was perfect. Will make again!

Overall this is a tasty, easy, and healthy recipe.  Instead of the chili pepper I used just a pinch of ground cayenne and the amount of spice was perfect.  My husband didn't like the carrots in them because of the texture so  next time I will grate them.

Great for the whole family!  I also think the serving size was exaggerated, I supposedly made 8, but it was more like 5.  After reading the other reviews, I cut the chili powder back to about 1 Tbsp.  I also added in a touch more vinegar, and about 1 Tbsp. brown sugar to cut the acidity.

My meat-loving husband actually ate two of these!

This recipe was fantastic!!!  My husband and I enjoyed every last bite.  I did reduce the amount of chili pepper added and still thought it was just right.

Better with ground turkey and I added water to make it more juicy. It came out dry the first time.

I make this all the time now.  I love that it's just not TVP with sloppy joe sauce, but it has great flavor and texture and I love the heat the chili pepper adds to it!

I added a little bit of salt to perk the chili flavor-I love spicy food! It was a simple and good meal.
