This is so darned easy and really tasty too.  I did saute the garlic and onion for a couple of minutes in a little olive oil.  I didn't add the cream to the whole batch of soup - those would wanted to tone down the spice could add some - I personally liked it without the cream and it saves a ton of calories.   This might serve 4 as a first course but not 4 for dinner.   Thanks for a great recipe.  :)

I used fresh pumpkin for this and except for an immersion blender/finger/emergency room mishap, it went well. I served it for a brunch with friends with mirliton bread, salad and mushroom crepes and they LOVED it.  I added a touch more seasoning to suit New Orleans' palates and used 1/2 fat-free half & half and 1/2 heavy cream.  It was delicious.  Thanks to you!

This is fantastic--the recipe lends itself well to making changes and additions to suite your taste.   I took the advice of another reviewer and sauteed the onion and garlic (needs much more than one clove!) for a few minutes.  I added the cajun seasoning during this stage, and also added some cayenne pepper and sriracha sauce.  I also decided to split the broth, adding half chicken and half chipotle bullion.  It was easier to just add a teaspoon of heavy cream to each bowl served, adding a full cup (I doubled the recipe) seemed too decadent. Chives and a few blue cheese crumbles worked wonderful as a garnish.  Thank you for posting this great recipe!

This is a super easy recipe. I blended it to make it super smooth, and I made a few substitutions that worked really well for me. Instead of heavy cream, I used plain greek yogurt reducing the fat content and increasing the protein content of the dish. I also didn't have cajun seasoning, so I just sprinkled a bit of cayenne pepper into it. In addition, I added a bit of honey which was the best idea that I had when it came to this recipe. It was delicious!

I used this as a bast to use up some open pumpkin and an acorn squash.  Thanks, Cat, it worked well. I had to make a substitute for cajun spices, as I had none on hand.  I pureed the squash and such  after cooking, then added half n half at the  finish, as that is what I had on hand.  Alot of changes it seems, but your basic thoughts helped greatly. The soup turned out very tasty.

I used vegetarian chicken flavored bullion, doubled the garlic and sautéed it with the onions and cajun seasoning (which I also doubled).  Halfway through cooking I added white sugar and black pepper to taste.  I only added about half the cream the recipe called for, I wanted to retain the orange color but I wouldn't leave the cream out because I like the texture it gave the soup.  (It definitely could be omitted and it would be an awesome vegan recipe).  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!  The pumpkin cooked down so well, this is my first time cooking with pumpkin aside from desserts or bread and I am impressed.  Thank you!

Very easy recipe to make.  The spice was just enough for my hubby and I.  I didn't have any cream so we did without and it was still tasty!

Next time I'll puree the onions after cooking them in olive oil.

This was really easy. I made some modifications though. Since both my husband and I are lactose intolerant, I used coconut milk instead of cream and instead of cajun seasoning, I put in curry and tumeric. It made for a great Indian inspired soup. I think next time I'll add some corriander to the mix. I took the advice of others and sauteed the onions and garlic first. When I served the soup, I topped it with crumbled goat cheese (easier on our stomachs than other cheeses) and green onions.

Loved this recipe and it was easy.  Made some adjustments to lower the fat content.  Used low-sodium broth and fat-free Half & Half.  From my calculations it ended up as 4 WW points for the whole pot due to the high fiber in the pumpkin and the fat-free Half & Half.  I also used the Spicy Hot Mrs. Dash instead of the Cajun spices.  Had a nice texture and taste.

How simple and healthy!!  Delicious.  I used more cajun seasoning and less cream (it tasted great even before the cream but it definitely added a nice texture).  Ran the immersion blender through it after it cooled a little and then heated it back up. It was just enough for the boyfriend and I as the main entree, so I'll probably make a double batch next time because I am wishing I had leftovers today! Paired with fresh rolls and a crisp pinot grigio.

I shall definitely do it again! I did the following substitutions and additions though as didn't have all ingredients at hand. I had no pumpkin puree so I substituted with approximately 300grms raw pumpkin and 2 large carrots, 2 small onions, 1 italian spicy sausage, 40 grms pancetta, and 100ml soya cuisine (substitute for fresh cream). It was creamy and delicious! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Made this soup today to use up four cups of frozen pumpkin.  Found the soup to need more seasonings for our tastes.  Added extra tsp of Cajun seasoning to the double batch and extra clove of garlic as well.  Also added some Magi Seasoning (about 2 tsp) which rounded out the flavor nicely.  We chose not to add the cream this time as it tasted great on it own.  Even the kids loved it!  Served it with toasted Italian bread and white wine (not for the kids lol).  Delicious!!!  Loved how easy and quick this soup was to make!  It's a keeper! Thanks Cat!

This was a yummy soup, but it makes a lot so be ready for a lot of leftovers or (as I did) put half into the freezer for another meal later on--which is so nice!  Also, in the future, I think I would add some andouille sausage for some protein and to make sure that it's a filling meal, or else serve it as an appetizer soup with a full meal coming behind it.  Thanks--I would make this again.

Great cozy soup, especially in the fall. Not too spicy. Just enough heat to warm your throat. I used an immersion blender, before adding the cream, to make it nice and smooth.

Love this recipe, it’s very easy and tastes great!  I didn’t want the pieces of onion and garlic so I used the immersion blender to make the soup smooth.  It tastes perfect even without the heavy cream.  I think when I make it again I’ll only add a quarter cup of the heavy cream. I think adding half a cup took a away a little from the pumpkin flavor.

I really wanted to love this recipe, but I only liked it. I don't know how to describe what wasn't working for me - only that it tasted a bit "flat". I probably won't make it again.

Cajun seasoning? I followed the recipe exact. Except...  I opted for 1.5oz of roasted jalapeño, 3 garden fresh peppercini and 1 fresh Thai chili.  Sauté 3 cloves garlic, onion and add a carrot in olive oil first. Add tbs salt, couple grinds of pepper and voila. I pureed everything about half way through cooking then added the minced Thai pepper to finish.   Northwest Spicey Punkin bisque! Pumpkin forward on the tongue and then it all comes together.  You'll lick the bowl.

I'd been wanting to make pumpkin soup for a while but am not a huge fan of sweet soup, which is all I could find before. This recipe sounded wonderful and simple to make. It was very flavorful, quick to throw together and went really well with my homemade sourdough croutons. I would definitely recommend this to everyone if you like your food with a kick.

I've had this the original way, and I've used a can of coconut milk instead of the heavy cream. I really like it either way. It's a great basic recipe that allows room for experimentation.

I really like this soup. Next time I make it I will experiment with some of the substitutes for heavy cream (reduce the calories) as well as saute the onions and garlic

This came out very spicy, but you can add sour cream or plain yogurt to it to calm it down.  Used half and half instead of heavy cream and even that seemed very thick and creamy. I think plain milk would work fine. Made cajun seasoning from the recipe on this site. Make sure to cook the onions until they're soft unless you want something to crunch on in the soup.

I too sautéed the onion and garlic first. I used half and half rather than cream, added about 2T brown sugar, and enjoyed it with a little honey as my garnish. It was good, but not "mmm, this is wonderful." But, the next day it was absolutely delicious!! My advice for this one would be to make it the night before giving all those wonderful flavors time to mix and mingle. I will definitely make it again. Thank you

Wonderful! I doubled the recipe & added 1 tsp of raw sugar for a more mellow flavor.

I made this "as is" but wasn't satisfied with the heat.  I added some Crystal hot sauce, Worcester, black pepper and some garlic powder.  Also, didn't have cream, so used half and half.  I know people get excited with variations, but I like more of a kick.

Made this lactose-free, and it's delicious! I substituted the heavy cream with 1/2 cup almond milk, 1 T cornstarch, 1/2 T flour. Next time, I'll make it with 1/2 cup lactose-free milk + cornstarch/flour mixture to help cut the heat a little bit and enjoy it more. Very good :-)

Since I don't own an immersion blender, I mixed the milk, cornstarch, and flour in my blender, then added the soup a little bit at a time to puree the whole batch. I'm reading the reviews about sauteing the garlic and onion--wish I'd done that too! Overall, great recipe for leftover pumpkin puree!

Good soup for a cold day.  I read the reviews before cooking.  I sauteed the onions and garlic first, and substituted a homemade spice mix since I had no cajun on hand. I put the batch through the blender before the simmering stage.  I tried it without the cream and I didn't care for it.  I added half-and-half to my bowl (had no cream on hand) and liked it better.  The flavors continued to tease me around the like/not-like axis so I added a small dollop of local honey.  OH WOW!  Try it in your own bowl, it might not be for everyone, but it made this recipe into a keeper for me!

This turned out fantastic. We served it over white rice and leftover thanksgiving turkey and it tasted just like spicy yellow curry from the Thai restaurant. We made it with fresh pumpkin and did not have to change a thing. It did not have a strong pumpkin flavor at all, so even our picky eaters loved it.

Just perfect.  It was quite spicy and I wouldn't mind reducing the amount of cajun seasoning, but it was still amazing the way it was.  So easy!!
