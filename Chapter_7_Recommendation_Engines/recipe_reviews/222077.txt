Delicious - there's nothing like oven roasted potatoes to compliment a grilled steak dinner! Who knew something could taste so good using only 1 Tbsp. of olive oil... The mix of fresh herbs was fabulous and the addition of the red pepper flakes gave it a nice "kick". This is a wonderful side dish!

I used eight red potatoes in this recipe instead of your basic baked potato. I also used homemade roasted garlic in this recipe and I increased the EVOO just a touch. I did bake mine at 400* for almost 45 minutes and they got a nice crust on them. I served these as a fill in for my usual home fries (that I make in the cast iron with bacon grease) and the boys seemed to like them, though I think I did like them a little more than they did. NO leftovers.

Question: why would you peel the potatoes?The nutrients found in potatoes are in the peel. Wash them thoroughly with a brush under running water and cube them with the peel. It adds to the flavor and you get the nutrients also. I have made these many times.But instead of cubing, I cut them in frie lengths and follow same procedure.This recipe is versatile.Other seasonings can be added or removed.Try adding chili powder,cumin,garlic powder instead of minced garlic,Italian seasoning,oregano, basil,you name it,you can use it.I've used a combo of the ingredients and then I've used just a few of them.However you choose,this is a good dish,it healthy and if left unpeeled,you get the nutrients for your bods too!

Delicious!! I made as directed, except I used dried herbs instead of fresh since that is what i had on hand. I used 1 tsp of each and the flavors were evenly balanced and so tasty! Needed more salt for my taste and will be a regular dish at my table from now on!

This is very similar to a recipe that I use, with the addition of basil. I know it will be delish!  And don't take my word for it, my picky son just loved these potatoes!

I made this as a dinner side dish with white potatoes that were on hand and it was great!  I also made them and then mixed them in scrambled eggs for a fantastic breakfast.  My family didn't even put ketchup on the eggs and potatoes.  They kept begging me to make them again.

I guess my potatoes weren’t so healthy because I know I used more olive oil than called for, not measuring but using enough to coat the potatoes.  Since I used Baby Yukon Golds, the skin was so tender I didn’t bother to peel them.  I also stuck to just rosemary and garlic because I love that simple combination (and because roasting fresh basil doesn’t appeal to me).  Turning them half way through was all they needed.

My husband gave it 5 stars but I give it 3 because the red peper flakes over powered the other seasoning.  And to me these were really hot!  Will make again without the pepper flakes

I tripled this recipe for a family birthday dinner and it turned out wonderfully. I used red and yellow potatoes and a bit more olive oil,and left out the red pepper flakes, but all the other herbs made the house smell wonderful. I served the potatoes with Chicken Marsala and they were a great alternative to the pasta that I usually serve. I will definitely make these again; crispy and delicious!

These are fantastic potatoes! The only problem (for my family) was that they were REALLY spicy. I have a VERY low spice tolerance, so maybe that's it, but it was almost too strong for me to finish. But the flavor is great. I'm not quite sure if it's one specific ingredient or if it's the large combination of them all or what, but it was really overwhelming. My husband, who has a VERY high spice tolerance, agreed that it was a bit much, but my mother-in-law, who has a low spice tolerance, loved them, so who knows. Anyway, the flavor is great!

By sheer coincidence, I just made these yesterday. I've been using this exact recipe for years. For a little twist, try this recipe on the grill. Loosely tent with foil and set it on the grill for 20 to 25 minutes, shaking it once halfway through. I sometimes add a few soaked hickory chips to the coals and it gives the potatoes an added  but subtle dimension. Excellent recipe!!

I like the recipe as roasted potatoes are one of my favorites and it is very very hard to mess them up. The low rating is due to the joke of the name "Healthier". This recipe actually has more calories than the oven roasted potato recipe and it takes away the potato skins. The only real difference being the regular one has one has one more tablespoon of oil to it for 4 potatoes. (Different spices are minimal for a potato recipe) I wonder why this is considered healthier and makes it into the 'healthy recipe section"

I used course kosher salt instead of regular salt.  I suggest putting the ingredients in a ziploc bag to allow for even distribution on the potatoes.  The coating is so good until you can enjoy just a few and eat off of these for an entire week.

I don't like to peel the potatoes,they are much better with the crispy skin on. In this case I'm using organic potatoes without chemicals. You just have to wash them right.The heat of the oven destroys everything bad,so you don't have to worry about that. :) I'm also using a little cube of butter before plating,it melts beautifully and tastes really good.

Used dry recipes since I didn't have fresh. I also left the peels on since there is a lot of fiber contained in them.

Really wonderful!  Only change was using garlic powder i/o minced garlic.  My husband ate thirds.  This one is going into our regular rotation.

Fantastic! In an effort to eat less processed food. I attempted this instead of the box of Long Grain and Wild Rice in my pantry. This smelled so fresh and amazing while roasting and the only thing better than the smell? The taste! My entire family (including two toddlers) gobbled these up. I used eight red potatoes and everything, but the garlic, was dried. I'm sure it's even more amazing with fresh herbs. This will go into our regular rotation of sides. Thank you for the great recipe!

Just made for the first time, came out great. Used dry herbs, no red pepper flakes and didn't measure anything. Prior attempts at roasting pot's were epic failures. Will definitely make again, might try some adjustments. Someone mentioned adding onion slices, maybe some season salt or equivalent. Thanks for the comments, I always find some nice variations. ~ Jimbo

So good! I've made this several times and it's always a hit. 1/2 tsp of pepper flakes is too spicy for my kids, but just right for the adults. Just reduce or omit it if you have picky eaters.

This is now my favorite oven roasted potato recipe. I used 1 tsp. each of the dried herbs instead of 1 tablespoon of fresh. Delicious!

This is so good and very easy to make. I used Goya seasoning salt without MSG instead. Made it about 4 times and always a hit for my family.

Just finished eating this easy-to-prepare potato.  It went nicely with cooked spinach.  I substituted the red pepper flakes with a few sprinkles of dried dill.

Very good but a little too much rosemary for our liking so next time will cut in half. Also added a little more olive oil. All kids liked it, will make again. Would love to try sweet potatoes!

This was a really nice seasoning for potatoes. The fresh herbs make the potatoes special. I used red potatoes, kept the peel on. I would make it again.

The red pepper flakes gave these potatoes a nice kick!  I used baby red potatoes and slow cooked them at 325 degrees F:  45 minutes, stir, and an additional 20 minutes.  They came out perfect.

This was really great.  Make sure you spray the pan that you put the potatoes on.  I also added more spice and salt and pepper.  I served this as a side with the Anniversary Chicken I dish.  It was amazing!

These were excellent and so tasty. My family loved them and were so surprised they were baked and not fried. Since recent health issues I have not been able to eat fried foods. Great alternative you will enjoy them. Although I didn't have fresh herbs the spice dried was still good, I can just imagine what they would be with fresh.

i was excited to try this recipe but disappointed at how dry it came out.. i had to add extra oil and i might as well have made the unhealthy version.. i left the skins on.. used dried basil and rosemary.. left out the parsley and forgot the red pepper flakes.. idk if i want to try this again

Delicious! I can't rate it 5 stars because I changed it slightly, but we loved it and I will be making it again! I used a little more olive oil and dried herbs, but that's all the changes I made. Thanks for a great recipe!

Although this was a very easy and healthy dish, DH and I found it somewhat bland.  Admittedly used dried herbs, but doubt that made that much of a difference.

I am giving the potatoes five stars even though the next time I make them I will leave out the red pepper flakes. They were too spicey for our taste but other wise we liked them and they are super easy to make.I look forward to serving them again when they aren't so hot.

Very good flavor. The red pepper gives it a kick. Cooked for over 30 minutes and still weren't browned. Would cook until most are browned next time. 4/3/14

This is a delicious recipe! This recipe has all the elements required for a 5 star rating in my book ... Easy to make, Great taste, Crowd Pleasing Goodness! I make a steak potato recipe that is quite similar to this minus the herb seasonings but I must say THIS RECIPE here is sooo much tastier! Thank you for sharing it with us here! I made these for a potluck dish and they were a HUGE hit! I used russet potatoes and dried spices instead of fresh because that is what I had on hand. I also added a touch of salt & crushed pepper before I baked them, simply because other viewers said they could use a little salt. I will definitely make these again & again! My husband is not a fan of rosemary, on ANYTHING, and HE LOVED THESE!!!

Very tasty! I've made this several times since my first try! Great easy recipe. I make a whole bunch, then we eat them over the next couple of days. These are great leftovers! I do go easy on the red pepper flakes though. A little goes a long way.

These were very tasty!! The aroma from the herbs before they were even cooking blew me away. I used red potatoes instead just because I personally prefer them. I also kept the skin on, more nutritious! Def will make again

I like these, made them a few nights ago and forgot to rate.  Did not have fresh parsley so I used dried instead.  It was still yummy but I can't wait to try it with fresh parsley!

This is my go to recipe for roasted potatoes. They are excellent following the recipe exactly. Only change I make is using dried herbs. My husband requests these often. Only tip I have is to place oil & herbs in zip lock bag and add potatoes. Easy and very minimal clean up! Thanks so much for this healthier version of an all time favorite!!

This tasted great! We like ours crispy, so we kept it in the oven for 30 minutes.  I used fresh parsley, and the rosemary and basil were from our spice cabinet...it still turned out delicious.  I definitely recommend these potatoes.  The red pepper adds a great bite!

I used dry seasonings and added in some paprika.  I also cut up some zucchini and yellow squash to roast as well.  Very filling and more nutritious with the additional veggies. I pair it with a store-bough lemon pepper rotisserie chicken.  Easy peasy!!

Delicious - just added 1 tbls. maple syrup. I also used dried herbs and omitted the red pepper flakes (Kids don't like them)  I will try with the pepper flakes next time.

These were VERY good and fast and easy from ingredients I had on hand.  I had to use dried instead of fresh for the parsley, rosemary, and basil but I just cut back to 1 tsp of each.  I used Yukon Gold potatoes - scrubbed and not peeled.  Next time I'll plan ahead and have fresh herbs.  I had no leftovers.

I didn't "Love it" but I gave it a 5 star because my picky husband Loved these. they were okay I felt they lacked flavor but I'm a flavor freak. Next time I'll just tweak it a little bit, glad for the red pepper tho or I may have brought out the ketchup just like old times when I was 5yrs old lol. Ketchup fixed anything back than.

I used a dry Italian seasoning instead of the fresh herbs and they were still marvelous. (Though I'm sure they'd be even better with the fresh herbs.) I love the addition of the red pepper flakes... gives the potatoes a nice kick without being overpowering. This is a great side dish when you don't want to break a sweat!

Excellent!  I used a bag of various colored baby potatoes, halved.  I'd reduce the red pepper flakes because other family members complained it was too spicy.

Loved this!   I made mine with red skinned potatoes and got a wonderfully creamy interior.  I cut the oil in half and they still turned out great.

Used 12 large fingerling potatoes, halved, 1.5 large carrots and a small piece of Daikon instead of just potatoes. I didn't have fresh basil.  Added Fried Garlic in addition to the fresh garlic which gave it a added depth of flavor. Halved the amount of salt, I used Himalayan Pink Sea Salt fresh ground, perfect amount, any more would be too salty. I would halve the amount of red pepper flakes next time too as I felt they overwhelmed the other herbs a little bit, but still AMAZING first run. The best oven roasted potatoes Ive tasted!!!

We made these as a part of our Christmas dinner - they turned out very well. We didn't have any fresh garlic, so we used garlic salt and that worked.   We will definitely make these again.

I also roasted wedges of onion and fennel with the potatoes, and used a poultry mix of fresh herbs (sage, rosemary, thyme, & oregano) because that's what I had on hand. These potatoes were a BIG hit!

These were good, but almost seemed like there was too much going on.  With potatoes I think sometimes simple is better.  I used baby reds since that was what I had on hand and also only had dried herbs, so cut those down to 1 tsp each.   I skipped the red pepper since I have a 3 year old that was going to be eating them.

I would make this again for sure. I found that using 3 tablespoons of olive oil was better for distribution. For some sweetness I added a tablespoon of agave which made a difference.

Very good and pretty easy.  I did not have red pepper so used cayenne,  I thought it was great, but my family who  mostly do not love spicy food, thought it was a little spicy.  Next time will use less.  Otherwise, really pretty good.

I really love these. I made them as a side for "Healthier Brown Sugar Meatloaf" that I made from a recipe on this website. Both delicious, and paired perfectly.

I really like this. I keep a herb garden an this was a great way to showcase their wonderful fresh flavores. I did up five medium potatoes with no leftovers. Oh, and I did swap black pepper for the red due to family preference. You should definitely try this one.

This was good. Family really liked it. I did find the red pepper flakes a bit overpowering, so will just use a little bit less next time.

This is a very good recipe. I used baby gold potatoes and followed the recipe with fresh herbs. However, I had a four pieces of bacon and a shallot I wanted to use up. I cooked the bacon, drained off the fat and sautéed 1 shallot, chopped which I tossed with the potatoes when they were finished roasting. Not as "healthy" but a little bacon makes everything good:)

I roasted mine for 50 minutes @ 350º (to match my roasted pork temp.) and got nice and crusty potato cubes. I used smoked paprika for color and flavor. I tossed the cubes in olive oil, onion (chopped) rosemary and salt and pepper to taste. You can add grated parmesan when you take them out of the oven. Add chopped garlic at the end so it doesn't burn.

I've always loved roasting all vegetables, and potatoes are at the top of that list. I also love fresh herbs and garlic with a passion, but I've always been afraid to use those when roasting vegetables at high heat sure that they would burn. Still, I've seen so many recipes like this - and with fantastic reviews - that I thought I should try it. Perhaps I'm not as smart as I think I am hehe. Sure enough, it is wonderful. The herbs do turn dark grey-green, but the flavor is not burned. Same with the garlic. Why isn't it bitter? I still don't understand it, but I won't be afraid anymore.

Love this recipe! I have an herb garden on my back porch, and was so happy to find a recipe that uses so many delicious fresh herbs! I added sage to the mix. My family love this, and I'm sure I'll make it this way again.

These were a huge hit with company when I grilled steaks this past weekend.  They made the kitchen smell amazing even before they went in the oven! Loved the combo of fresh herbs with a touch of heat from the red pepper. This one will definitely be made again and again this summer! After these were done, I drizzled a bit of truffle oil right before serving. YUM!

It tastes really good, but apparently 20-30 minutes is too long since they started to burn a little bit. I will also add more olive oil since the potatoes came out drier than what I'm used to.

Very good recipe! I had a few doubts about doing roasted potatoes because of the extra calories in the olive oil, but these are yummy. I find I can reduce the olive oil just a bit more than this calls for and still get the same results. As another poster put it, I don't peel mine and the skins get that crispy/chewy consistency that is so good.

Overall this recipe was pretty good - I used russet potatoes and left the skins on, although I was surprised at how spicy just 1/2 tsp. of red pepper made them. I'll most likely make these again, but without the red pepper. The other herbs give them plenty of flavor.

Great recipe.  Left out salt for added benefit of a no-sodium side dish.  Other spices more than make up for lack of salt.  If necessary may use no-sodium salt (Potassium Chloride).  It was excellent without it.  Always looking for salt-free tasty recipes.

Excellent recipe. Company raved about these. Used Yukon Gold potatoes and dried spices (no fresh in the house!).  Roasted 40 minutes to make them crispy.

I made this recipe to take to a friends house. They loved them. I made it with red potatoes and doubled the whole recipe. I did find that I needed to add a little more oil but I may have used more potatoes too. I also used some dry parsley because I didn't have fresh. I cooked them for about 10 mins on 350 while I cooked meatballs then upped temp to 475 for about 15-20 mins. Will definitely make them again.
