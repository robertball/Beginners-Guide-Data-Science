Nice! I added a little hot sauce to the egg mixture before I dipped the chicken in and that gave it a little more bit. I also cut the chicekn into "nuggets" instead of strips.

If you like the taste of eating a tsp of salt everytime you take a bite then this recipe is for you. The sodium from the bouillon overpowers the cayenne pepper. It overpowers everything for that matter. The only reason I didn't give this one star is because the use of the potato flakes gives the chicken a really nice crunch. I'll just use my own seasoning next time.

Delicious and spicy...the mashed potato crust give it a more wholesome flavor.  We added double cayanne pepper to really give it a kick.

This was absolutely the best oven fried chicken that I have ever had.  The mashed potatoes gave it the real fried chicken texture.  My entire family enjoyed this dish.

These were good but I wasn't in love with the bouillon taste.

Pretty good!  I like the crunch that the potato flakes gave.  In the past, I have always used bread crumbs to make chicken strips in the oven and they always got soggy on the bottom.  These were crunchy all the way around.  I do think they could use a bit more flavour so next time I will add more seasonings.  Oh, I also only used one crushed boullion cube.

My family loved this dish.  It is better if eaten right away.  My husband ate an hour later when he got home from work, and they were not as crispy anymore.

Omitted the pepper since it was for kids and completely forgot the butter but they turned out great! They didn't seem too salty with the two cubes of bouillon but I used a different brand - maybe that makes a difference. Served with homemade ranch dressing for dip.

This was really easy and quick, and most importantly my 20 mo. old loved it! I left out the pepper since it was for my little one, and made them into bite-size pieces for him, but they were great! My husband tried them and requested them for football games. I've also made them with italian seasoning and parmesan in the "breading" and that was really good with blue cheese or ranch dressing to dip.
