My husband and I and one of our 4 kids loved it!  Our other three kids didn't like the texture of the bananas in the pancakes; possibly due to the fact it was something new.  The pancakes were too sweet for me to add syrup.  But they were very yummy with a smattering of butter spread on top.  Next time I make these, I might mash the bananas and add less white chocolate chips.  (oh, I added a splash of sugar free hazelnut syrup to the batter for a nut flavoring with out the crunch because I have kids who hate nuts.  But if I make this again and only for my husband and I, I would add some kind of nut for a crunch contrast)

I really liked the flavor combination in these pancakes.  I had issues with cooking them because I roughly chopped my banana.  I recommend you cut the banana into very thin and small pieces.  If you do not have baking mix: For each 1 cup of mix you need, use 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1 tablespoon shortening.

I added flax seeds instead of the banana. It was okay but I ommited the chips after a couple of recipes since they were just additional sugar.

I made this recipe without choc. chips and it still was awesome. I mashed bananas instead of slicing. The bananas added just enough sweetness for breakfast pancakes.

Delicious!  This has become my staple pancake recipe.  I’ve made them by sliced and mashing the bananas and prefer to mash them.  I’ve also made them without any chips and it was still really good.

I made this recipe using the melt in your mouth pancake directions on the Bisquick box and skipped the chocolate chips.  Top it with warm applesauce and cinnamon sugar, and it is to die for!  Very easy with the Bisquick base.

These were delicious! I did not change a thing, even though I was a bit worried about the amount of cinnamon and choc chips. I was wrong, perfect as is!

Good but not great.  I scaled this recipe down to 5 servings.  I also used the homemade pancake mix from this site in place of the boxed mix.  Other reviewers stated these were too sweet because of the white chocolate chips so I used shaved white chocolate on top of the pancakes and only a small amount in the batter.

What an awesome treat!  I made these for dinner with my 2 yr old son (he mashed the bananas :)).  We'll definitely make them again - maybe for a birthday breakfast.  I used half the amount of cinnamon because I was afraid it might over-power the other flavors.

My husband made these, and I am my 1 year old thoroughly enjoyed them. My 2 year old wasn't as enamored by them, but still ate some. My husband liked them and gave them 4 stars (the highest he goes), but thought there was too much chocolate. He used two bananas instead of three, and used mini milk chocolate chips instead of white. Next time we'll probably do a 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips and 2 bananas. Thanks for the recipe! Yummmm.

These were remarkable! The white chocolate melts into the batter a little bit which makes them quite sweet. You only require a dab of syrup to compliment these. I may double the recipe and freeze the extras next time I make this.

Really easy and very tasty. I substituted bittersweet chocolate chips for the white chocolate and a dash of nutmeg for ginger.

This recipe has quickly become a favorite in my house. My husband and 3-year-old son loved them! I like bananas but am not a big fan of fruit in my pancakes so I used just one which turned out to be just right for us. I have been told I should make them at least once a month so I will definitely be making these yummy pancakes again.

These were fabulous! The only reason I didn't give them 5 starts is because I tweaked it a little. I only used 1/2 of the chips and mashed the bananas. Still a LITTLE too sweet, I think I will only use quarter of the chips it calls for. GREAT!

I don't know what happened. I changed nothing about this recipe. The pancakes turned out tough and were too sweet. 

It's too bad. I was really looking for a 
wonderful end result with these. My kids
liked them but my husband and I were underwhelmed.

If I could give this negative stars I would...This batter is AWFUL!  I cook 6-7 days a week and multiple meals a day, as I have young children, so I consider myself an accomplished cook and decent baker. I can certainly follow a recipe as easy as this.

These were, by far, our families favorite pancakes. I gave it four stars because I followed the other reviewers tips and mashed up the bananas into a kind of paste, and it was so good that way. I think it should be in the recipe that way, from what I've read from people who've made it the other way. But making it with the bananas mashed up was absolutely delicious.

It's true.  This is a very good recipe.  I am a sweets lover, but even for me, next time I make them I will probably decrease the amount of chocolate chips and maybe a little less ginger.  My husband said he could taste it but I couldn't.

My family loved these pancakes. I mashed the bananas before adding them to the batter and substituted the whole cup chocolate chips for one half white chocolate chips and the other half peanut butter chips.

Delicious!  I make them exactly as written and top with a little butter and powder sugar. This is my favorite pancake recipe.
