Scrumptious.  Served it with white rice and left the Tabasco on the side.  It was surprisingly quick to make.

Wow! I made this, and the family loved this jambalaya. The flavor was highlighted and the spices are just right. When I say spices donâ€™t take it to mean spicy, I mean it to be flavorful. I would recommend just following the recipe. If you wanted to add anything after the dish is prepared then do so.
