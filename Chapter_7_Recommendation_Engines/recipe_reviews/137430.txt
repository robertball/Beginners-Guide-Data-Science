I would give this 7 stars out of 5 if that was at all possible. I am a junior in college, and using this recipe, we threw two INSANE parties that drew incredible numbers of people. This is what we used:

3 Gallons of Tampico Orange drink
3 1.8 qt. cartons of Minute Maid Berry Punch
6 qts. Newman's Own Pink Lemonade
3 1.8 qt. cartons of Dole Pineapple-Orange juice
5 handles of Rubinoff Vodka (we're college students, we're broke)

We did away with the white rum altogether, seeing as how it's expensive and low in alcohol percentage.

This recipe was enough to feed 50+ mouths with multiple cups, and everybody absolutely loved it and have been literally begging us to make it a weekly thing. Absolutely cannot stress enough how amazing this mixture is; 2 solo cups' worth will have any person with a normal alcohol tolerance pretty buzzed. Again, 7 stars. Awesome.

Waaay more affordable than the real Jungle Juice.  We mixed the alcohol with some melon balls and sliced kiwi the night before and put it in the freezer to chill then added the juices and soda just in time for the party to start.  You still may want to provide ice nearby as it was closer to warm later on in the evening.  If the recipe is followed exactly you will have a punch that is very close to 8% ABV (or about the equivalent of two lite beers per 12oz cup).  Add a 750mL bottle of Everclear to bring it up to 10.5% ABV.  Very tasty!

I made this for our New Years Eve Party and everyone said it was way to strong. Perhaps it was the recipe in ml instead of ounces or gal. Anyways all we tasted was the alcohol. I wont make this again...

Very good. There are so many variations of fruit punch and many different brands of orange drink and pink lemonade. I tried to stick with as basic of what is called for. Taste like an adult version of a fruity tropical punch. Very adaptable to tweeks. If in mixed company of adults and children mix up the juice in one container and mix the alcohol in another and let the adults add the alcohol mix to their drink to their taste.

Great recipe! Made this for a friendsgiving. I halved the recipe - made about 3 gallons.  I used tang for the orange drink, V8 fruit medley for the fruit punch, simply pink lemonade and simply oj with pineapple juice. Also used Bacardi pineapple. It was so good! Not too strong just the right amount of yum!

Improvised with the ingredients, but used about the same varieties. Was delicious. Added Ginger ale as it needed something bubbly in it. I also froze my orange drink as mini ice cubes and added those throughout the batch. Helped keep it cool and not dilluted.

This drink was really good. It is a little strong, so i suggest cutting it in half. I will definitely make it again, it was a big hit.

This is my new go to drink for parties! Te recipe is great, I just altered it slightly and converted it into percentages for when I am doing smaller crowds. I use 30% sunkist, 10% Hawaiian punch, 15% dollar store pink lemonade 15% Tropicana orange-pineapple 20%everclear (or vodka if you want a weaker drink) and 10%Malibu rum. DELICIOUS
