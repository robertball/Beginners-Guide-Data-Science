If you are like me, you might sometimes take a pass on recipes with a few number of reviews, feeling that there is strength in numbers.  This is the recipe that should make you change your mind! It is an easy cacciatore recipe that saves you the work and effort of browning the chicken and you don't lose an iota of flavor.    I stayed closed to the recipe but added one red pepper as well as a package of sliced mushrooms. I am told that isn't traditional but something called hunter's stew should have mushrooms....very earthy ;-)  I added six cloves of fresh garlic and omitted the garlic salt.   I used fire roasted  diced tomatoes and they really added a depth of flavor.  Because I added veggies, I also added a 14.5oz can of fire roasted crushed tomatoes and the sauce simmered itself to a really thick state.  I didn't have to add flour. Just threw the tomatoes in with their juices from the beginning.  In fact, the leftovers will probably need another can of tomatoes to get some sauciness back.  I did as the writer said and left the skin on the chicken which was a bit problematic as the chicken cooks until is falls off the bone so I had to chase out skin bits throughout the sauce.  I used 2 breasts and a package of thighs.  Next time, I will remove the skin.  Excellent recipe... served over egg noodles.  So good that I hid the leftovers in the back of the fridge where hubby might not find them!

Great! I changed it a bit though...I made it all in the slow cooker, which made everything SO easy. I used skinless thighs. I didnt sautee anything...just put the chicken on top of sliced onion and bell peppers in the crock pot, mixed the sauce in a separate bowl and added on top of the chicken. I added a can of tomato paste and left out the flour. Next time I'll try a little red pepper to give it a kick!  Served over mashed potatoes, which was a nice change :)

Made this tonight and it was excellent! Used frozen boneless/skinless chicken breasts and just added them to the sauted garlic & onions. Added spices, then liquids.  Used 1 cup of beef stock, 1 can of chicken stock and 1 cup of wine for the liquid. Also used LOTS of fresh chopped garlic, but then again there is no such thing as 'too much garlic' in our family.  Cooked the chicken most of the way, then added 1 red bellpepper and 2 small zuchinis.  Excellent way to sneak in extra veggies. ;-) Will definitely make again.  Hubby asked me to put it on the menu to make at least  monthly. :-)  5 stars from my family!

This was really great! I modified it to work in a crockpot - but hands down one of the best cacciatore's I've had in ages! Sauteed the veggies in butter and set aside. Added two chicken breasts, two thighs and two legs to the crock pot, added salt and pepper. Poured in the wine, added the sauteed veggies and italian spices (I had garden fresh basil oregano and rosemary) then topped with one drained can of tomatoes and one undrained can and a can of tomato sauce. I added the extra can of sauce because I needed a little more liquid for the crockpot - but I reserved (like it said i the recipe) the drained juice. And used that with flour to thicken at the very end. 4 hours at high, pulled the meat out and shredded off the bone added back in for another 1 hour on low. it was fabulous and I am thrilled I have so much leftover!

Excellent recipe.  Followed the directions almost exactly.  Didn't do the flour thing and it didn't need it.  Also I served it over Polenta instead of spaghetti.  Thanks for a nice recipe.

This recipe was awesome!  I threw everything in the crock pot (did not saute the onions/peppers), used boneless, skinless thighs and cooked on high for 4 hours.  The only 'problem' was that the 6 thighs practically disintegrated and I could barely find enough chunks of chicken for the 3 of us.  I'll definitely cook it less next time, but the flavor was fabulous!  Thanks!

Very good recipe. The picture is what made me want to try it. It looked like the meat was taken off the bone after cooking - I had never taken it off the bone or used boneless. I tried it this way and will be making it this way from now on.  I made some minor changes by browning my chicken first in the same pan and used colored peppers. Thanks for the great recipe!

It sure is easy, and it sure is delicious!  Here are my substitutions:  used sherry instead of red wine.  DO NOT use the store bought kind, it's loaded with salt, use drinking sherry. Did not add garlic salt, but added about twice as much fresh garlic.  Did not add flour, scooped out the chicken and cooked the sauce down.

I made this for a Holiday Party and it was a great success. The Burgundy gives this dish a sweet flavor. I followed the recipe exactly. But after making this a few times, I do suggest removing the skin before cooking because the meat starts to fall apart and the skin will float around and its hard to remove all the skin and trust me, it's not cute biting into a mouthful of "boiled" skin. The other suggestion is halfway through cooking, remove the bones. The meat will have fallen off the bones at this point anyway, and it takes time to fish them all out. Kim, amazing recipe. Thank you for sharing this gem with the world.

Very good.  I did change the green bell pepper to red bell pepper.  Hubby and I can't handle the green bell peppers any more.  This was very good and made wonderful left overs for lunch!

This is just excellent.  The flavor is fantastic -- I used all fresh garlic rather than the garlic salt, and I didn't have the Burgundy (although I bet that makes it fantastic) but it was utterly divine nonetheless.  When you get raving compliments from an 11-year-old who is not related to you, you know it's good stuff.  ;-)  Thanks so much for sharing this.  It's excellent and even though I just had it last week I'm craving it again already!

i have never made w/ red wine before so i wanted to try this version. very good. i browned the chix in bacon drippings ,then removed the chix, sauteed veggies in drippings, deglazed the pan w/ the wine and added toms. i didnt bother reserving any toms or adding flour and it was still very good. i served this over baked polenta w/ a green salad. (i also added some leftover beet greens cause i didnt want to toss them)

This was very good! I used 4 frozen skinless, boneless chicken breasts. I then followed the recipe with the exception of adding the flour at the end. Very good served over pasta. I would make this again. Thanks!

Best recipe I've made for chicken cacciatore and I've made alot.  The house smelled wonderful while it was cooking.  I added the mushrooms and replaced one can with fire roasted.  Next time I will use 2 cans as it added depth to the sauce.  I also added six cloves of garlic instead of garlic salt.

This is excellent!  I cooked it as directed, but in hindsight, I should have followed some of the suggestions in the reviews.  Specifically, I will remove the skin on at least 1/2 of the chicken peices OR I will brown them first to get rid of some of the excess fat they generate.  I just found that leaving the skin on, when all was said and done, there was a good 1/4 inch of fat sitting on top of the dish.  But otherwise, the flavors in this are simply delicious.

I absolutely loved this recipe! My family too.  I used Merlot because it was all I had and increasd by 1/2 cup.  Added 3 cans of stewed tomatoes, with the juice,  instead of 2 because I added extra peppers and carrots.  Went with the 6 cloves of garlic as someone had recommended  and omitted the garlic salt.  Threw in some basil, oregano and parsley. Left out flour.  NEXT TIME, I will make double the broth and use only thighs or other dark meat for moisture.  We served over rice.  It was almost like a stew.  The house smells great.

Okay recipe, however I like using olive oil vs butter and  red bell pepper and a tsp of crushed red pepper. I also prefer to crisp the chicken first by coating in flour and frying in a bit of olive oil until skin is crisp.  It also seems to help thicken the sauce. This came out too runny and wasn't spicy enough. I think ill stick to my old recipe.

I made this almost exactly as written except that I used bone-in chicken thighs instead of a whole bird and I added about 1/2 pound each of sliced zuccini and button mushrooms to the saute. I also used linguine in place of spaghetti. To me it tasted bland, like something was missing. Maybe the added veggies took away from the seasoning and I should have added more. Don't know. Maybe it's just me since everyone else loved it for the most part in their reviews. My mom had no comment either way but she never does so who knows with her. I'm adding an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce to the leftovers because this really made a huge amount and there is a lot left over.

I had to make some adjustments based on ingredients I had on hand.  I dredged my chicken quarters (all dark meat) in flour/salt/pepper and browned it in olive oil before proceeding with the rest of the recipe.  I didn't have green peppers, so substituted mushrooms in place of it.  We don't drink, use or keep wine in the house, so I substituted with apple cider. The Cacciatore came out tasty and delicious! I've never attempted Chicken Cacciatore before, and because of how easy this recipe truly was, I'm sure I'll be making it more often.

Thank you Ms. Shepheard.  I used this as a reference, as I used cherry tomatoes blended with the carrots and garlic) instead of diced. I have four plants, and they are coming on gangbusters.  I added sauteed finely chopped carrots for extra body, and added more butter and added olive oil as well.  Other than mine turned out a bit thin (i will correct that next time, it was deleicious. It reminded me of the Cacciatore I had while growing up in the Finger lakes of New York. I also used chicken legs, as I like dark meat in cacciatore.  It is delicious on Pasta or rice.

This is one of the recipes I make over and over again without a single change to the recipe.  I serve it with whole grain egg noodles.

This came out really good. I put everything in the crock pot which made it really easy. I just added a little bit of olive oil to the bottom of the pot and then added my veggies, then I added a pack young chickens and drumsticks and the rest of my ingredients. I replaced the red wine with white because it's all I had, also added a can of tomato sauce and used basil and oregano diced tomatoes. Cooked 4 hours on high, one hour on low, added the flour and tomato juice mix in the last hour.  My family was very pleased, will be using again!

Delicious!!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  I used chicken breasts because I had those on hand and it was still very flavorful.  I added sliced olives too.  I'll be making this again and again!

Delicious! Amazing! So simple! This is going into the monthly rotation. It is very savory and will stick to your ribs. So satisfying!

My husband actually said it was the best meal I've made in a long time. (I actually almost kicked him under the table.)

My 6 and 8 year olds had heaping seconds. My 2 year old had thirds! 

I chopped a pound of mushrooms and cooked them with the onions and peppers and an extra Tbsp of butter. I didn't have burgundy :( so I had to sub marsala. 
 
I served it over angel hair with steamed green beans and cauliflower on the side.

Sometimes cacciatore comes out to tomatoey tasting. Not this one.  This was fantastic. I added a tsp of onion powder and a tsp of red pepper flakes to the spices. I did add more garlic- about 5 cloves. What can I say we like garlic. For the chicken I used 2 bone in, skin on half breasts. It was very very good. I also had to sub Zinfandel for the burgundy. This was a huge winner in our house. I didn't have to add the flour mixture as my sauce was super thick on its own.    THANKS KIM FOR A LOVELY MEAL.

Very good!  I used 3 pounds of chicken leg quarters because that was what I had on hand (we like dark meat) and I removed the skin before cooking.  The recipe was very easy to follow and I will definately be adding this to my dinner rotation.  Thanks Kim =)

In addition to what's listed, I added a red bell pepper minced and about a 1/2cup fresh Italian Parsley and 1/4 teaspoon sugar to reduce acidity in tomatoes. I also added 1 cup of grated Parmesan cheese to the sauce and stirred it in. Served it over whole wheat angel hair pasta. This was wonderful!

It was good. We liked it. My only criticism is that it didn't make nearly enough sauce. When I make it again - which I probably will - I'll either use less chicken or add more liquid.

This was really great!  I did think it needed just a bit more flavor and I think next time it would be great to add in a couple slices of bacon or pancetta.  I did sear the chicken first before sauteing the veggies.  I also used san marzano tomatoes, added a lot more garlic, a couple tbs. sugar, a dash of chile flakes, and about 1/2 cup chicken broth.  I didn't need to add the flour at the end, since after simmering for so long, the sauce gets a nice thickness already to it.  We served each bowl with fresh parmesan cheese over top and it was a delicious meal!  Thank you for the recipe!

This was delicious! I did make a few substitutions. I used diced garlic cloves instead of garlic salt. I substituted chicken broth and a tablespoon of cider vinegar for the wine. I also added two cans of V8 juice as we like this with extra liquid.

Mine was meh....but I'm betting it's because I cooked it in the slow cooker (after sautéing the veggies). The sauce never got thick either, but again, I contribute that to the slow cooker. I've seen that it seems the ratings that were less then stellar were prepared that way. Will definitely try again, but on the stovetop.

This was excellent! I didn't have premade Italian spices so I used paprika, oregano, basil, thyme and sage. I also added a small can of tomato sauce and I browned 2 chicken breasts, then the vege's.

Just made this for dinner...sooooo good. I like things super easy and this was. Only difference was I bought a rotisserie chicken, skinned it & removed chicken off the bones. I placed meat in gallon ziplock bag in refrigerator until I was ready to use it. I did everything as recipe said but didn't put chicken in until everything in pot was heated through. I then added the cooked chicken and the reserved liquid as recipe said. It was very tasteful & buying the chicken saved me a lot of cook time!

Followed the recipe except for leaving the skin on the chicken. I took off most of the skin (I don't like a lot of fat/grease in my food though I'm sure it adds amazing flavor) and it still tasted great. I will definitely make this again, but add/sauté some mushrooms with the other vegetables.

Awesome  I did make changes.  I used boneless skinless chk thighs and made it in the dutch oven because I didn't start it early enough for the crock pot.  I used pinot noir because we had some and I added celery, some fresh oregano, because I needed to use these up, and served it with rice.  Thank you for this!  My family just ate it up!  I will double it next time.

I added a red pepper and a package of sliced baby portabello mushrooms, used fire-roasted tomatoes as others suggested, and only added back half the reserved juice from the tomatoes.  At the end the sauce was quite watery; I removed the chicken and veggies, added about 2 tsp cornstarch, and simmered it bit before pouring the sauce back over everything.  Makes a large quantity, good for freezing and bringing back out at the end of the week.  The flavor is not the most complex, but it is definitely tasty and goes a long way.  Has potential to become a regular.

My husband is making himself sick because he can't stop eating this wonderful dish!  I used chicken broth instead of wine and added some rough cut mushrooms. Fantastic.

I just finished eating....it was delicious!  It was so nice out today, that instead of cooking the chicken indoors, I grilled it - good choice!  I also added mushrooms :)  Thanks!

I liked it, but the family wasn't that crazy about it. However, all agreed that it tasted better the next day.

Wow this was amazing!  My whole family loved it.  I made this in the pressure cooker which infused the flavors and also speed it up enough that I could cook it last minute after work.  I tweaked the recipe just a little, like I didn't have any peppers but it was SO good without I won't put them in ever. I used 1 can of regular diced tomatoes & 1 can roasted diced tomatoes because that is what I had on hand.  I didn't brown the chicken, and I took the skin off all the pieces except 3 for flavor. (then removed it with the bones) I added beef broth for the extra liquid to pressure cook. I also cooked up 3 slices of bacon, crumbled and added this plus 1 tbsp of the drippings to the recipe. I used egg noodles because again that is all I had.  I didn't use any flour, I just added a can of tomato paste at the end.  This is an amazing recipe and my family always asks me when I am going to make it again!

Not so good.  Bland.   I tried this recipe again 1 year later in 2015; Tried to spice it up a bit and marinated the chicken for about 4 hours prior to cooking.   Better flavor 2nd time around but  still a little bland.

I thought it was really good!  I was only cooking for 3 people (2 of which were children) so I only made half the recipe.  My kids didn't really like it since they are big fans of dices tomatoes.  I think next time I might have to compromise and used tomato sauce so they won't sit there trying to pick the tomatoes out.

All and all not a bad recipe. I cooked it in the crock pot and will make it again for sure. I will add a bit more seasoning to it the next time. It was just a bit on the bland side.

What a great dish!  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  Few changes/additions as per reviews and to suit our taste.  Added more garlic than called for.  Used two cans of diced tomatoes, one can of stewed tomatoes and one 8oz can of tomato sauce.  Used Shiraz (because that's what I had opened). Left out the garlic salt but added basil, oregano, red pepper.  Used all chicken thighs, and used green and Italian pepper, carrots and celery. Thickened with a little flour.  Very gourmet.  A keeper.
