This recipe was out of this world good.  Every once in a while you come across a recipe where it becomes a staple in your home.  This is one of them!  Few ingredients, easy crock pot cooking and out of this world taste makes this a great recipe.  The only knock I have against this recipe is that I would reduce the sugar to about 1/3 of a cup.

Very tasty and tender!  I usually use half white sugar and half brown sugar. If you don't like the salty taste, try reducing the *amount* of soy sauce--I've found that the "reduced sodium" soy sauce is still very salty-tasting, especially cooked.
The sauce will make your kitchen smell bad if you take the crockpot cover off too many times while cooking--the tomato sauce tends to burn a bit along the sides and gives off an acidic odor--but it won't affect the flavor of the meat.  I just leave it covered until done.  ;-)

This is great I have made this twice now. I do add cornstarch about 1 hour before its done and that really helps to thicken this up. Tender and Yummy! Good flavor.

Outstanding for a simple recipe!  The pork loin I used literally fell apart :)  I did turn the meat half way through the cooking time as the soup did not cover the whole thing.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as stated.

I tried this and it was fall apart goodness! The taste was great. I added seasoned pepper. I flipped the meat half way through cook time. This was a simple and easy recipe. Very little prep time. I will make this again. Thanks

Wow, I would never have guessed this would be so good!  It is so tender and does just fall apart.  The sauce has a nice tanginess to it that we really liked.  I just cut back on the sugar a bit and otherwise made as written.

I used a bone in roast, but followed all other instructions exactly.  The meat comes out very tender and I wasn't sure about the sauce but it was quite tasty.
I shredded the pork after cooking and thickened some of the sauce with cornstarch to make sandwiches.  They were great, and I will be making this again.

This is wonderful.  Used bone in pork roast and left it longer than recipe states--about 11 hours.  The pork just fell off the bone, and the sauce was excellent.  Bf wasn't sure about it until he tried it, and the next thing I knew he was putting some meat on bread and pouring sauce on it like dip sandwiches.  I even liked this, and I am not a big fan of pork.  We will make it again.

I'm not going to lie, I was a little worried about what this was going to taste like considering the ingredients. Wow! I was pleasantly surprised! My husband, who is very un-excitable, told me 4 times that this was "really good" (that's equivalent to a regular person doing a back-flip over it). I followed other reviewers' suggestions and cut the sugar down to 1/3cup, and it was perfect! Super easy, super tasty! This one's a keeper!

I thought this recipe was good overall, but if you are not a salt junky you really will want to use the low sodium soy sauce.  I did not and it was really salty.  I thickened the sauce to pour on and that was barely usable it was sooo salty.  Great flavors overall, but I'll definitely use the lower sodium next time.

The roast was tender, but I just couldn't get over the smell.  I usually revel in coming home to a wonderful roast in the crock pot, but the whole house smelled funky (the only thing I can compare it to is canned water chesnuts, I know crazy, but that was the smell.)  I also threw in carrots, potatoes, and onion as I usually do with roast and the veggie flavor wasn't that hot.  I'm glad I tried this dish, but will not make again I'm afraid.

Very tender and tasty!  Gotta love easy, cheap and delicious!  I used low-sodium soy sauce and only about 1/4 cup sugar and it was perfect for our taste.

this is really good! I just changed half of it lol I read what a lot of you said about the soy sauce and brown sugar and honey mustard. so this is what I did  8oz can of tomato sauce(had oregano and garlic in it) 2 tsp of honey mustard 1/4 cup of soy sauce(instead of 3/4, much better) 1/4 c white sugar 1/4 c brown sugar 1 tablespoon of corn starch   that is for the sauce. the only thing it was done cooking at 7 hrs and I had it on low and my pork loin was over 3 lbs. I dunno why it was cooked faster then it said, but it was good!! my husband loved it!

While the meat was tender, the sauce was unappealing.  Although I didn't care for it at all, the fact it has received so many 5 star ratings just shows that Allrecipes has something for everyone.

I think this is the first two star rating I have given any recipe, but this was SO SALTY!  If I were to meke it again, I would use more tomato sauce and less soy sauce.  Not sure how much a difference that would make.

This turned out a little dry for us. The flavor was great and it's a good thing we had so much sauce left from the cooker, because we needed it to compensate for the dryness. My recommendation would be to check the roast after 6 or 7 hrs. Ours was a 4 lb roast; I cooked it exactly 8 hrs & it seemed over done. Still, I will try it again in the future & cook a shorter time. I expect it will be great then.

The pork came out very tender. I shredded the pork to make some pulled pork bbq. I did add an extra bottle of bbq sauce with the pulled pork and made a sandwhich out of it.

Yummy! I forgot to put it in the slow cooker before I left so, I just roasted it in the oven. It was delicious but, next time I wont forget to use the slow cooker.
I had a 5lb roast so, I made some changes. I used a 15oz tomato sauce, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 cup of soy sauce, 2 tsp of ground mustard,  1 tablespoon of garlic powder, 1 tablespoon of orange zest and a couple of dashes of Marjoram. I added a sliced onion and potatoes to the pan.

oh wow!  awesome recipe!  we also added quartered onions and lots of fresh garlic in the crockpot.  cooked it on high for 5.5 hrs.  perfect!  the most tender and flavorful meat we have ever had.  subbed half of the white sugar with brown as well.  might cut down on the sugar a bit next time.  so easy and guaranteed wonderful to make..thanks, LaVerne!

Followed the recipe exactly.  I don't understand what's supposed to be so good about this recipe.  It was boring, bland and a waste of a good pork roast.  Will not make again.

Made this for tonights dinner.  Entire family loved it.  So tender and juicy.  Followed the receipe to a  tee and slow cooked for 8 1/2 hrs. on low. Could cut it with a fork.  The gravy is delicious and enough for left overs.  This receipe is a keeper.  Will definately make again

I forgot to put soy sauce in so I will have to try it again some day. Maybe that would have evened out the super sweetness of the sugar???

This was very good and pretty darn easy.  Mine stayed very moist and was very tender.  My roast was frozen so I did cook it for a little on high, a little on low.  As I poured in the last 1/4 cup of soy, I thought to myself, OMGoodness and had to look again and make sure that was correct.  The flavor is excellent but from a sodium stand point I might cut that back next time or go low sodium.  I am guessing it would taste just as good to cut the sugar back a little also.  I would cut both back proportionately.  Still should be plenty of juice.  But there is no need to go adding a lot of this or that and increasing the cost.  It is fine as is.  I didnt thicken up the gravy but it would have been very easy to do.  I just put some of the juice on my mashed tators.  That made them were yummy too. I will keep this in the rotation.  Thank you for sharing.

My family loved this recipe, although I did change it some.  I had a 4 lb pork loin so increased the ingredients a little.  I was out of soy sauce so  used 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce & 3/4 cup red wine vinegar.  I added 4 oz of ketchup, increased the sugar to 3/4 cup and used 2 slightly heaping tsp of ground mustard. I also added a medium sliced onion just because we like onion.  After it cooked, I thickened the sauce with flour to make a gravy and served with mashed potatoes, carrots & celery.  The pork loin was so tender, it literally fell apart.  It was a great meal I will definitely serve again.

i thought it was ok but nobody else in my house liked this. and the smell really turned them off!! they didnt even want to try it. i cut the soy in half and still too salty. i liked the idea and maybe with quite a few changes it would be much better. but as is...i'm only giving it two stars because  the meat is fall apart tender.

WOW! This simple recipe makes the tastiest gravy. I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for sharing!

This was really really good. I only used 1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp of soy sauce based on other reviewers' comments. There was no acrid smell coming from the slow cooker (although I was careful to avoid lifting the lid while cooking) and I made a gravy with the juices and some corn starch to thicken. Leftovers made great open-faced sandwiches with cheddar melted on top.   This one definitely goes in the recipe box - perfect for a cheap and easy meal, with ingredients (other than the pork) that I always have on hand.  I'd recommend re-titling the recipe, however, to something along the lines of "Sweet Teriyaki Slow Cooker Pork Roast" to help manage people's expectations about the flavors of the dish.

Great recipe.  Ended up a bit more like a mandarin pork, so I served it with rice.  Easy and tasty; a win-win!

Excellent! Used only 1/2 c. sugar, but otherwise followed recipe. Used bone-in roast and meat was still very tender! Loved the 'teriyaki' flavor.

I made this pork roast tonight and it was very juicy and tender! I did change it up just a bit, used brown sugar and honey instead of white sugar and honey mustard instead of ground mustard. It did turn out very tasty! Thanks and I will definetly be making this one again!

I tried this recipe because it had such great reviews. My husband and I were VERY disappointed.Like the other reviews say, the meat does just fall apart but it tasted terrible. I made it exactly as stated. We couldn't get past the incredibally salty flavor. If you aren't a big salt person than don't try this recipe.

Made this for dinner & it was a hit! The pork literally fell apart. Served with mashed potatoes and veggie. The next day we heated it up and served as an open faced sandwich. This recipe will not disappoint!

I made this super easy pork roast last night for dinner. The meat was so tender! It was really good...even my picky 2 yr old ate it! I reduced the soy sauce to 1/2 cup and the sugar to 1/4 cup. It was still a bit salty but not extremely. I also thickened up the juices with cornstarch and served the roast with mashed potatoes. Might tweak this a little to reduce saltiness but I will definitely make this again! Thanks!

This is a very good recipe. I will admit I was hesitant when my husband said it smelled like syrup, but it didn't taste really sweet. I did use a little less soy sauce (about 1/2 cup + 1/8 cup). This is very easy, the pork is very tender...super YUMMY!

Fantastic recipe.  My husband, the non-chef, didn't screw this up AND he loved it.  In our family of 5, HE, is the picky eater.

We didn't change a thing.

My kids ate it - that gives it an automatic 5 stars.  I found it very moist and rich.  I used a smaller crockpot so the "wet" ingredients were able to really soak into the pork.  

I used tomato soup instead of the sauce (I didn't have tomato sauce).  It worked very well!  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar as someone else did.  Very good.  

I'll make this again.  It's already saved into my recipe box.  Way to go LuVerne!

So Good!  The whole family loved it.  I followed the recipe as stated, but added onion rings and whole cloves of garlic.  I thickened it at the end with a cornstarch slurry after I removed the pork. I served over rice with a side of frozen green beans from the garden.  I will keep this in my rotation, for sure!

This was sooo easy and very yummy.  I didn't have tomato sauce in the pantry so I subbed a can of crushed tomatoes.  I loved that Ididn't have to brown the roast first.  It was in and going in 5 min.  The meat was fork tender and had great flavor.   Will definately make again.

Very yummy!  After reading reviews, I reduced sugar to 1/4 c and Soy Sauce to 1/3 c.  After it had cooked (no need to flip), the sauce tasted too much like tomato, so I removed and sliced pork, added about 1/4 c more sugar and 2-3 tbsp teryaki sauce to sauce left in slow cooker with 2-3 tsp of cornstarch, stirred, and added the sliced pork back in for about 5 minutes.  The flavor and tenderness were exceptional!

This was so easy to prepare and absolutely delicious!  I would definitely recommend using low sodium soy sauce.  I also used no salt added tomato sauce to lessen the salt content.  As another poster recommended, I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  I will be making this again.

I bought a pork roast on sale and needed a new recipe.  This one was different from my regular recipe.  It also wasn't for BBQ pulled pork.  I didn't think it sounded great, but "what the heck".  It turned out delicious!  I doubled the recipe because I had a 5.5 lb roast.  I used table mustard instead of ground.  It was a little salty, so I recommend the low sodium soy sauce.  I cooked rice to go with the sauce and it was perfect.  I love to use the slow cooker because it is so easy. I put the roast on low when I left for work and 8 hours later it was done.  Don't be turned off when you taste the mixture before it is cooked.  It taste totally different when it is ready.  My teenagers loved it.  I will definetly make this again.

Very delicious!  Good flavors.  I added carrots and potatoes w/ the roast.  Also some water-1/2 cup.  Then made gravy w/ juices and cornstarch. My husband and 4 kids loved this.  Will be making it again and again.

Definitely something I would make again.  I know it sounds repetitive but the roast was very tender and although I was a bit apprehensive about the sauce, it turned out very good! I did add some corn starch also about an hour before serving to thicken the sauce, otherwise I didn't change a thing and it turned out great!

Made this a few weeks back and forgot to review it. I thought it was tasty but just didn't ring my bell enough for 5 stars. Thanks for posting the recipe though.

LOVE this recipe!! This is my first time rating a recipe on this site and I have used a lot of recipes on here. This one never fails and is super easy. I have even put the tenderloin in the crock pot frozen and it comes out perfect. I love the flavor and the meat is always fall apart tender. My mom even tasted this recipe while visiting and is now cooking it too! Super easy and delicious!

AWESOME!  I made this exactly as recipe called but did add corn starch to thicken.  It is very easy and delicious!  Will be a staple in our home.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly, except I used reduced-sodium soy sauce and I thought the salt content turned out just right.  While it was cooking, I became disappointed because it just smelled like barbecue sauce and I am sick of bbq pork.  But when it was ready I was really surprised.  I didn't pour the juice over the pork, it was tender enough without it.  It just had a really nice flavor to it.  My husband was pleasantly surprised as well, and my picky 3 year old ate more than he usually does!

This was simple and delicious. It was a bit on the salty side, but I'm sensitive to salt. My family thought it was fine. I'll definitely make this again, but may cut back on the soy.

Loved by the whole family, even my "picky eater" 7 year old grandson. I followed the direction amounts and  replaced the soy sauce with lite soy sauce and the sugar with Equal.

Easy, delicious recipe. Made 2x as much pork - and wasn't near a computer so I kind o improvised on amounts of ingredients.  I don't think you can ruin this one - the gravy was fabulous - over mashed potatoes - yum

The pork roast was tender, as it always is when I cook it in the slow cooker.  The problem was with the gravy.  My family and I felt that it was too salty and too sweet.  I will not make again.

The pork was tender and the sauce was good. I agree that it was very salty, and I would get reduced sodium soy sauce, and add a tbsp of brown sugar.

It came out awful. Dry, too sweet. Tasted like pork with Marinara sauce on top.  I listened to the other reviews that said to lighten up on the soy. It was not fall apart tender. I had to cut it with a knife. I will not be doing this one again. Sorry.

I screwed up and somehow didn't see the sugar and mustard in the recipe, so I made it without.  When I tasted it towards the end it didn't taste finished so I ended up adding about a half cup of brown sugar anyway and that helped a lot.  I only used 1/2 cup soy sauce and it was VERY salty even for our salt-loving tastes.  Even with my mistakes the kids and us adults all really liked it.  Looking forward to making it again and making it right (with less soy sauce).  :)

We really enjoyed this roast! I like how the sauce had a little tang that made it different from the traditional pork roast. I did only use 1/2 cup soy sauce, because that is all I had, but I added 1/4 cup water to make up the difference. I also added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder to the sauce mixture. My roast was just about 2.5 lbs. so I cooked it for 7 hours and left it on warm for about 1 hour. It turned out quite tender and not dry at all. I will be making this again! Thanks for posting :)

The meat was awesome, it fell apart. I didn't have tomato sauce handy, so I substituted with tomato paste and thinned it with water, when it was done, I flaked the meat with two forks and put it back in the sauce. Even my picky 9-year old loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

After reading the reviews, I cut down the soy sauce to 1/2 cup.  I can't comment too much on the taste, since I didn't really get to try much.  DH, my 4 year old and picky 2 year old ate almost all of a 2 lb roast before I ever got home from work.  What I did try was DELICIOUS.  Crock pot meals are a necessity in this house but so many are a flop.  This was very yummy and also easy.  We will make this again!

This was very good.  It made for a very tender roast.  But we left the sauce in the crockpot and put BBQ sauce over the meat before it was served.  The leftovers were turned into BBQ sandwiches.

We did not care for this at all. I followed the directions exactly, but maybe because i'm from NC I was expecting this to be similar to an eastern- NC sauce. It filled my kitchen with a very acrid smell. When my boys asked me what the smell was, I had to admit to them that it was their dinner. To save the meal, my husband suggested to rinse it off and slather it with jar barbeque sauce, which is what I did. Good luck if you make this.

Great!  I followed the directions exactly except that I browned the meat before I put it in the crock pot and I cooked it on high for most of the time.  Still came out very tender.
Great flavor.  This will make super sandwiches.
A Keeper!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I reduced the sodium content and used a bone-in roast, turning it halfway as another reviewer suggested.  Easy/convenient ---but probably a little bland for my family.  I might try shredding and adding a BBQ or steak sauce for sandwiches with the leftovers.

I marinated the meat overnight. Used slow cooker with some water at the bottom. Cooked for 9 hrs. The meat was overcooked - fall apart but already lost the original sweetness, just fibre n sauce left. Used low salt soy sauce. Saltiness was ok but still find the soy sauce taste overpowering. The marinate lacked umami. Quite disappointed as the photo posted on this site looks delicious. My husband said he didn't know what he was chewing. My kids didn't want to eat it.

At first I thought the ingredients were a bit odd, but figured I'd give it a try anyway because I wanted to try something different. About 4 hours into it cooking the smell was horrible! Even my husband, who came home for lunch, thought it smelled terrible. I knew it was something I could not eat and neither could he. We just couldn't stomach the smell.

Great, fast & easy recipe.  I only used 1/2 cup soy sauce because that is all I had and I also cooked it on high for 4 hours and it turned out tender and juicy.
