I used this as an inspiration and added what I had available...some fresh snow peas, some bean sprouts and some tofu.  Also seasoned it with a dash of soy sauce and a drop of sesame oil.  It was delicious and I will definately make it again.

This tasted great! It doesn't make too much though so I added more chicken broth.

I did change this up quite a bit but am giving it 5 because it would be good as written. I only changed it to give it more substance for my non soup loving hubby. I browned my chicken hunks in seasame oil,black pepper, and season salt. I added snow peas and carrots to the broth and then I garnished with bean sprouts, cilantro, and red bell pepper. The only complaint I have with this soup is that it only said to slice the mushrooms when indded the stems should really have been removed. I had never had shiitake mushrooms and have since learned that the stems are tough and rubbery and I will definitely remove them the next time I make this.

I found it quite plain, and i think the chicken needed more flavour/texture.

If i did it again, i would cook the chicken in a wok seperately with fresh ginger, then add it to the soup later.

I would also use a couple of teaspoons of dark soya sauce as well.

My husband was sick with a very bad cold, so I thought I would try this. Very easy and very delicious. I doubled the stock and may double the chicken next time. I will also try it with tofu and I think that would be a nice touch. The noodles should be broken up into small pieces or else you're eating it with a fork and spoon.

I really love this soup.  Pefect for lunch and much heartier than it looks.  I added snap peas to it and doubled the noodles, but it's great in it's original form too!

Easy to make and delicious.  I added a can of water and did not add any egg and
it was delicious.  Next time I might add some more vegetables, like cut up broccoli.

This was good after a few minor adjustments.  I didn't think it had a ton of flavor so I added in Siracha hot sauce.  It made it very spicy but great!  I also doubled the chicken broth because otherwise, I thought it didn't have enough of a soup consistency.  I added some other veggies as well.  After the changes, I thought it was great and will definitely make again.

This dish was a hit with my in-laws!  I took several suggestions from other reviews.  I added fresh bean sprouts, frozen petite peas, and soy sauce because I prefer hearty soups.  The eggs worked very well and had the texture of tofu.  Shitake mushrooms are out of season so I substituted with regular medium mushrooms.  I even found premade chinese noodles and this cut the cooking time in half.  My husband's grandmother asked me for the recipe and she took home a large bowl of leftovers.  I will definitely make this again.

A very good, very simple recipe! I didn't use green onions because I forgot to pick them up! The recipe says to use one can of 14 oz broth, but I used 2 since the cans I got were about 10 oz each. It also didn't seem like there was enough broth anyway. I was scared of the mushrooms since I've never cooked with them before, but they were delicious. Same with the eggs in the recipe. Someone else said they left it out because it was "weird," but trying new things is whole fun of cooking! An analogy would be like trying on clothes, things on the rack might look great on you!

I double everything except the noodles,  and browned the chicken with garlic to give more flavor.
I used 1 can broth, three cans water and two chix bouillion cubes. I though the egg was kinda wierd so I'd leave it out next time. 
Great flavored soup, served it with potstickers, but not something i'd make again.

i tried it and it was delicious, however i had to make a few changes. i took out the mushrooms, made the broth with the chicken in it as whole breasts took them out and sliced them. and when served the vegetables and noodles were served placed in the bowl raw. I also boiled the noodle seperately.

Very nice dish.  A little plain, but enjoyable.  I might recommend increasing the amount of broth, though.

Yum!  So simple, and the limited number of ingredients worked well, as I didn't want to run to the store in order to make a quick lunch.  Used Vietnamese rice vermicelli noodles (as that's what I had in my cupboard), chicken stock instead of broth (we like the additional flavor), five green onions (we just like them!) and a little soy sauce.  The egg reminded us of the "egg flower soup"  at our favorite Chinese restaurant.

I changed this recipe up quite a bit. I spent about 25 minutes searching for a recipe that used mushroom stock as the base of a soup, before I settled on recreating this using that.

I used mushroom stock for the base, made it nice and salty and umami-y. 
Added some green beans since they were just lying there and looking lonely.
Subbed the noodles for lentils 
Added a healthy serving of red pepper flake
Dash of tamari
Dash of fish sauce
Sauteed chicken briefly with salt, pepper, garlic powder, before throwing in the pot
No eggs.

Basically, I changed the entire recipe.

It had mushrooms, green onions, and chicken still.
