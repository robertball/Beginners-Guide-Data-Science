This recipe sounded great, but the overall flavor and consistency of the cake was not really like a pound cake.

I give it 5 stars with the following modifications...1/2 cup brown sugar, substitute cream for milk, add a teaspoon of almond extract and use a full cup or butter...it came out vey moist and yummy! My mom and hubby loved it! I also made a glaze for it 1 cup confectioners sugar, 3 tbs of milk, 3 tbs of melted butter and a tsp of vanilla...poke holes in the cake and pour over warm cake a little at a time...YUM!

Thanks for the recipe! I was looking for something quick and easy to whip up to take over to my parents house as a dessert, when served with strawberries, cream and ice-cream it was a hit! Didn't taste like those artificial pound cakes that you buy at the store (with that really rich/sweet taste) - just right!!!

I tried this recipe a few weeks ago for the first time. I made it for someone, so I didn't get to taste it. Instead of making it in the loaf pans, I put it in a bunt pan. It was pretty short, so when I made it again yesterday for a family gathering, I doubled the recipe and baked it in a bunt pan. It turned out great!!! I topped it off with a vanilla glaze about 5 minutes after I took it from the oven. It was so delicious and everyone loved it!!! Awesome recipe :)

Excellent pound cake, I add a bit of fresh lemon and orange zest.  Great for a summer dessert with strawberries and whipped cream!!  Also bakes well in small, individual pans.

My husband really enjoyed this cake. I thought it missed the texture of a real pound cake. Did have a nice taste as far as the vanilla, but was "eggy".

This recipe makes only 1 medium loaf.  Tried recipe again and added orange extract and dried cranberries and made muffins.  Still not very impressed.  Tops were golden brown & crisp and inside was dry.

Came out very delicious! I baked it in one large bread pan for about 60 min and it was perfect. I topped it with a strawberry mixture and whipped cream. May get seconds because I have a feeling it is going to go quick.

Amazing! I made this for the first time tonight and my family loved it! My son (he's 2) actually ate it which is rare because he normally doesn't like cake. It was so simple to make too! I would highly recommend this recipe.

This recipe is about perfect. It was moist and delicious. And sweet, but not overly. Nice buttery flavor. I'm sure it's bad for us. But whatevs. The only flaw in this recipe (as posted) is that the batter is NOT enough for 2 pans! Putting all of the batter in 1 standard bread loaf pan will give you a loaf of pound cake. Putting it in 2 pans (as directed) can only give you wafer thin loaves!

Giving a 3 for taste because I love the vanilla and buttery flavor.  But the cake turned out flat (both stacked together might have been the same height as most pound cakes I have seen) and the ingredients "settled" to the bottom so when sliced half the cake is light and half dark.  Not sure what I did wrong :(
