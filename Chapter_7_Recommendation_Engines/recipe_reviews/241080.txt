Why is this called Loaded Baked Potato Dip if there aren't any potatoes in it?

I did not care for this. Just strong, unblended flavors of sour cream, onion, and bacon ( bacon's usually a such a good thing!)  We opened a jar of salsa, and tried adding a spoonful of salsa to each helping of this dip. It improved the taste somewhat. Saved some of it to actually put on baked potatoes for dinner the next night, and that worked well.

I selected this recipe because I wanted a football dish for Super Bowl Party. This made A LOT of dip. We were also having a potato bar so it was great to use as a topping for the potatoes. After reading the reviews I decided to add a little more spice to the dip part: worcestershire sauce, Cayanne pepper, and smoky spice. I should have watched Chef John’s video as I believe chilling it for a couple of hours would have made it more moldable. It was pretty soupy so I put it in an oval casserole -which ended up fine, just not as pretty without the green onion grass. Flavor was still just a 3, but it was eaten and made the table look fun!

After looking at the reviews on this was a little concerned as they are so hit and miss. I made this with 4 cups of plain Greek Yogurt and 2 cups of softened cream cheese to add body. I also added one package of dried onion soup mix for flavor. This was not a lot, considering the volume of other ingredients and added just a taste that made this perfect. My friends loved this and one requested to take home the little bit of leftovers. So this turned into a Hit and how can you go wrong with 3 lbs of Bacon!

Edible but was never firm enough to shape like the video shows.
Even added cream cheese to try to stiffen the mix.

It may be a bit sacrilegious for some, but I used turkey bacon and yogurt in place of sour cream.  It tasted great.

Really yummy I modified it a bit.  I used cream cheese with a bit of sour cream and added jalapeños and corn.  I also used turkey bacon.

Loved this dip! It is a hit for those who like loaded baked potatoes. The bacon coating the mixture makes it saltier, so try low sodium bacon and lightly salted chips. Thanks for this great recipe.
