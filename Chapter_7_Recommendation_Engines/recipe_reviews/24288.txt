I've made this twice now and the second time was a lot easier than the first... The first time, the peanut and caramel mixture was really difficult to spread. The second time, I found a way to make spreading the peanut mixture easy.  After you put the peanuts into the caramel, the peanuts cool down the mixture and the cool mixture is hard to spread so I put the mixture back into the microwave and reheated it. Then I spooned the peanuts and caramel on top of the first layer of chocolate. It worked perfect, the hot caramel spread evenly and easily. I also used 34 caramel squares and only 1 3/4 cups of peanuts.  This is one of the best home made candy recipes I've ran across and, yes, it does taste a lot like a snickers bar. I took some to work and shared with employees and several ask for the recipe. I'll make this one over and over....

WARNING...WARNING...WARNING! Do NOT allow yourself to be home alone with this fudge!  You really should use 50 caramels and a little more water in this.  (Also reheat after adding peanuts for ease of spreading.)  I did and it was wonderful!  Super easy, super yummy.  Wait two hours to cool before you can dive in???  Forget it!

Taste like my favorite candy bar! I went ahead and used a whole pkg of caramels (50) and 1 1/2 tbsp of water. I love caramel and the little bit extra made the peanut/caramel mix easier to spread. Next time I will try it with pecans:)

easy to make and very good.  the only thing i'd recommend is to keep in mind that the fudge must stay refrigerated, or the caramel melts.

Everyone said how great this fudge was.  The only reason I didn't give it 5* is because I found the caramel and peanuts hard to spread on and ended up having to do it with my fingers.  I would make it again for special occasions.  I added only half of the peanuts and thought it was plenty.  Next time I'm going to coarsely chop the peanuts so it will be easier to cut.

This recipe is absolutely sinful.  I have tried and tried to make fudge over the years and it never comes out right.  This time it was excellent.  I would however reccomend doubling the caramals and increasing the chocolate chips by at least 50%.  I will try this next time.  I also substituted Pecans and Almonds for the Peanuts since I don't like Peanuts.  Very YUMMY

This is a delicious candy that I will likely make again when it gets to be the holiday candy season.  I took it to work and had several requests for the recipe. I lined the pan with foil before greasing so that I could easily remove the entire chunck of chilled fudge from the pan before cutting. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and used only 1 1/2 cups peanuts.  I also returned the peanut/caramel mixture to the microwave for 30 seconds to keep it spreadable and that worked out very well. This is a very easy (and very good) candy to make.

This is such a wonderful recipe! MMmmmmmmm...
Everyone in my family absolutely loved it, and are begging me to make more! Since it uses the microwave it's a super quick and easy recipe. I've never made successful fudge before, until with this recipe. Definately a winner!

This was really good, but the two days later the top got kind of weird, dull-looking with little white spots.  A friend who ate it the first day though ate about half the pan.  Good if you serve it the day you make it!

Very good and easy fudge.  I am not much of a semi-sweet fan but I followed this recipe exactly.  Next time I will go all milk chocolate chips.  It is definitely rich and also reminds me of a snickers bar.  I think the other thing that I will do next time is add a little less nuts.  They're good but a little too many in there.  All in All this is a great recipe and we will make it again with the few adjustments for our tastes.  I think this would also be great with almonds, pecans, cashews or walnuts or a combo:)

Tasted great, but the caramel runs out if you leave the fudge at room temperature, creating a sticky, unsightly mess.  If you leave the fudge in the fridge, the caramel hardens and it's difficult to eat.  I used toasted pecans and yes, it tasted fantastic, but I would hesitate to give these as a gift considering the runny caramel.

I'm in HEAVEN! If you don't like SWEET, or CHOCOLATE, or CARAMEL... DO NOT try this recipe!! I used the whole bag of caramels (50) and upped the water a little, and used the whole amount of peanuts. I'm in LOVE! My friends are all begging for some & the ones I've given it to are addicted! Great recipe! Thank You for sharing!

Awesome...took the others advice.  Unfortunately, I tasted the caramel/peanut portion, prior to putting it on the fudge, and determined that those two ingredients, melted together, make a wonderful ice cream topping.  The fudge recipe, though, is yummy!

These tasted great, be careful how high you heat up the caramel- when we made them, they set up great, but if it got to room temperature later, the caramel all melted out and made a mess.

I found this recipe in one of the Christmas Gooseberry books and made it this year.  Now I see it here on-line as well.  This was easy and delicious and I will make it again.  I rated 4 because it didn't cut very easily and didn't look as appealing as other items on our dessert bar this year, but it tasted great.

Very, very rich, but very delicious. Tastes exactly like a snickers bar. After reading the reviews, I used about 10 extra caramels and I think that was just enough. These are great for those like me who have an extreme sweet tooth.

Mmmmm.... this is really good.  I love the caramel-nut layer, but the fudge bottom is so-so (I would prefer to add the topping to authentic fudge).  I used about 50 caramels plus a little extra water.  I put half of the caramels on the fudge layer, added pecans (instead of peanuts), sprinkled a little salt on the nuts, and added the remaining caramels.  I microwaved the two layers of caramel separately.  There might be too much butter in the fudge part - it was really greasy to work with and after it cooled, butter solids collected on the sides (I don't think the pan should be greased.) I lined my pan with parchment paper; was able to lift the whole fudge out and place it on a cutting board to slice. I used a large hot, dry knife, and cleaned it off between cuts - I sliced thinly and the fudge looked very neat and pretty. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

My family loved this fudge, I myself thought the flavor was good but it was to sweet (then I'm not a big fan of fudge either).  I will make this again but next time I may cut back on the sugar.  I chopped the peanuts & used a whole bag of carmels.

Excellent!  My coworkers have LOVED them!  I think my boss has had about half of the recipe so far.  :)  I did use the tip of microwaving the peanuts/caramel after mixing the peanuts in, and it did make it a lot easier to spread.

This candy has a wonderful flavor and it is just so darn addictive!  I didn't use peanuts, I used pecans.  The cocoa, butter and sugar mixture was so dry I couldn't get it mixed so I added another tablespoon of milk and returned it to the microwave for another 30 or so seconds and then it mixed up well.  I will definitely use this recipe to take to social events but never again to keep here at the house, I will gain 5 pounds with every batch, I just can't stop eating it!  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Great recipe to add to your holiday goodies tins. I did everything stove top instead of microwave. This made it easier to manage and monitor the temp of the fudge.   Also, the next time I do this recipe I think I will chop my peanuts.

The idea in the recipe was great, but it's certainly not foolproof.  Be careful not to cook the caramel too much or let it get too thick in the fudge.  Became hard as a rock in the middle as the caramel and peanuts formed a concrete, which was harder than peanut brittle.  I think I overcooked the caramel, though.  The other two layers were great.  If I try it again, I'll probably use something else in the middle layer.

This candy is really good!  I made it for a Christmas party and it got rave reviews.  I made some with peanuts and some with macadamia nuts, which I thought made it even better- but then again, I am partial to macadamia nuts.

It was good, but I prefer a different microwave fudge recipe from this stie with nuts mixed in.  It's easier and, in my opinion, tastier.

These are sinfully delicuous! Forget the calorie intake on these, and enjoy! Works well for parties and birthdays, or just secretly make for yourself and stash them away all yourself! Thanks!

I have made this twice and the second time I used a little more water in the caramels to make it easier to spread and it sets up just fine.  I also like it better with pecans.

An easy and time saving recipe! But it's easy to overcook the choc. base, if you're not paying attention and don't catch it when it starts to boil.  As for flavor, it doesn't get any better than this!  It's gotten nothing but rave reviews by everyone who's tried it.  In fact, I've been ORDERED to make at least 1, if not 2, more batches before Christmas.  A definite Keeper!!!!

I would call this a recipe for homemade Snickers' bars because that's what the results reminded me of.  This was very simple to make and we really enjoyed it.

My family and I just loved this candy.  I followed the directions exactly and it was a big hit with every one we shared it with! Be sure to use the hint about keeping the peanut and caramel warm to spread easily.

Very Good!  I made it with a few extra caramels as most previous reviews suggested and microwaved after adding the nuts.  I used pecans (it's all I had in the house) and everyone LOVED it!  The only criticism is that the bottom fudge part is a little soft for fudge and tastes a little more like a frosting- it works well for the candy bar effect, though!

We made this as a family, used chopped almonds instead of peanuts, 50 caramels, 1 cup each of the choc chips.  It was so easy and OMG...so unbelievably delicious.  I am scared to be alone with it!

This recipe was great and everybody that ate it loved it and it was super easy to make.  People everywhere are asking me for this recipe.  And if you know someone who is cranky or having a really bad time, nothing seems to put someone in a happier place than chocolate, especially if its combined with carmel.

This did go together fairly easy, so long as I had all the ingredients measured out in advance.  I'm not a fan of microwaving anything but vegetables, but found, as long as I was watching for the fudge mixture to boil, I was satisfied.  I melted the caramels and water in a double boiler, but as I was melting the caramels, I was skeptical about the amount of peanuts and how well they would mix with the caramel sauce.  I actually used 40 caramels because they looked a bit smaller than the name brand caramels.  All mixed well and am waiting on the finished product in the fridge.  I can't wait to try them.  They will be included in a package of treats for gifts for Christmas.

This was super yummy.  It tasted just like a Snickers candy bar.  They get kind of sloppy though, so chill them a little bit (but not too much) before trying to cut into squares.

This fudge is so good and quick to make. Unwrapping the caramels is the hardest part. I ran out of this fudge before all of the other flavors I made. Definately worth the work.

I made this recipe for Christmas but it got eaten up so fast I had to make it again!
The hardest part of the entire process is unwrapping the 30 caramels but well worth
the effort.  A very tasty treat!
