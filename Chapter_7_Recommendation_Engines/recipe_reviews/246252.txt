This is such a versatile smoothie.  I used organic fresh strawberries and bananas, frozen organic blueberries, fresh russian red kale from my garden in place of the spinach and left out the whey powder.   Because my banana was so ripe, I didn't need any sweetener.

Refreshing and fruity with some superfood nutritional  benefits! After tasting it, I added a little stevia.
