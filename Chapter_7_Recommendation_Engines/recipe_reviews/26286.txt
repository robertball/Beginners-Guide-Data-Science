Quicky, easy, and good.  In Texas, I was taught to also add a can of Cream of Mushroom to the recipe. I also learned that Velveeta is the favorite to use since it melts so well. Some people drain the Rotel, and some don't. (It's spicier if you keep the liquid though).  Either way is good to me. I know a few people who use canned chunked chicken (like canned tuna, but chicken) to make it that much quicker to make.  Occasionally, I like to add diced celery, pimentos, onions, garlic, and garlic powder (depending on my mood). No matter what, it's fool proof! You can't go wrong! The best one I ever tasted was baked, and it wasn't too cheesy (which is good because I'm not fond of things that are too cheesy).  It was just creamy (not too creamy) and good!  Good starting off point for people who have never had it before though!  I like to serve it with garlic toast (or that garlic Texas Toast you find in the freezer section of your grocery store), and green beans (fresh or canned).  Try it out!  You can always tweak it as much or as little as you like!

Great with some additions. I added fresh tomatoes, fresh mushrooms, 8 oz. of shredded chedder cheese. I also added onion and garlic to the chicken while cooking. Tasted almost a good as what you might get in a restaurant.

I was in a hurry when I made this recipe, and WOW, it was finished in less than 30 minutes!  I didn't have the mushrooms or the rotel, so I used cream of mushroom soup with 1/2 can water, 1/2 cup hot salsa (jar) and 3/4 can of diced stewed tomatoes.  This is a new favorite!

This a great busy night dinner.  With all of the prep work done the night before, this can be on the table in about 30 minutes!  I used leftover grilled chicken and added garlic, onions, and green bell peppers that have been sauteed for a few minutes. I also throw in a couple of dashes of chili powder. This is great with a green salad and Jiffy cornbread!

OH MY GOSH is that good!!  I used one can of regular Rotel, one Cream of Mushroom soup, one 4 oz jar of mushrooms and shredded cheese.  Wish I had used low fat cheese and less cheese in order to lower the fat content ~ next time.  I also used Quinoa spaghetti instead of regular spaghetti to get away from the gluten.  It was really awesome.  It's in my favorites for sure.

This is very easy to make. I like to add a little extra liquid, cover with buttered cracker crumbs and finish in the oven.

mmmmmm....this was sooo good! I added onions and garlic powder and left out the mushrooms.  Even my hard to please hubby loved it and asked for it again. It has a king ranch chicken taste to it.

Thought this was awesome & very easy to prepare.  Instead of the processed cheese, I used a can of cheddar cheese soup & also added about 1/4 cup of milk.  It really helped with the creaminess of the dish & had great flavor. Will definitely make again.

I used 1 1/2lb of chicken breasts & grilled them on the stove top with a generous sprinkling of Montreal Chicken Seasoning.  Sauteed 1/2 a green pepper & onion in separate pan.  Added a family size can of cream of mushroom soup, 2 mild cans of Rotel, & a large can of mushrooms.  Used pasta shells & a small loaf of Velveeta.  Baked in the oven for 30 minutes @ 350 degrees.  Was extremely bland, BUT Sriracha added to my bowl made this meal outstanding!  Dont know if I would eat it without the Sriracha.  My husband & oldest son liked it-not a hit with the 7 yr old.  Would probably make again in a pinch.

this was so easy and so yummy! I made a couple changes i did 1/2 mozzarella shredded cheese and 1/2 cream cheese it made it super creamy.  I did 1/2 can of cream of chicken soup and 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup due to others suggestions.  I sauteed onions with the chicken when cooking the chicken.  I also used real tomatoes. the spice from the green peppers was great! I recommend bread sticks as a side.  will do again!

This was a pretty good take on chicken spaghetti. . .I used Rotel and it was a little too spicy for me, but that was my own fault--next time I'll make sure I get the mild Rotel.

I made a few changes to make it a really fast meal to make. I know it would taste even better as it is originally written, but I used canned chicken and shredded cheese. I also used regular diced tomatoes because I don't like spicy food. My family loves this. My kids can't get enough of it.

I made the same thing just sauteed some chopped onion before adding the rotel and cheese. I left out the cream of chicken soup and the mushrooms and it was still really yummy. I'll try it with the cream of chicken soup next time.

This is very easy to make and quick that's for sure!  I was very surprised how delicious this was!  I used spaghetti Rigati noodles, ROTEL tomatoes w/green chilies for some kick, skinless chicken breast, fat free cream of chicken soup and mild cheddar cubed cheese.  This dish was so smooth but spicy.  I loved it! If I wasnt allergic to mushrooms those would definitly be in the dish as I could see how that would be a fabulous addition.  Thanks for sharing!  I will absolutely try this again!

I used cooked salmon in place of the chicken.  For me, this dish is ok because the chile peppers are very over-powering, but my husband likes it.  My children finish theirs too.  I'll probably make it again, but not for myself.

I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't follow the exact recipe. I made my own cream of chicken soup, used reduced fat colby jack, chopped my own tomatoes and green chiles and since the Hubs doesn't like mushrooms, I used canned artichoke hearts and just rinsed them really well and chopped them. I also used whole grain wheat spaghetti to make it more diabetic friendly. It's one of our favorites and pretty quick despite all the fresh cooking I do.

Who would have thought this would be soooo good! Made it on a whim, using stuff that I had on hand...DELIGHTFUL!! I used cream of mushroom soup, and I think next time I will add the mushrooms, perhaps some bell pepper and onions. We had it two nights in a row, and it was still tasty. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This is a great recipe however I add some extras that takes it to WOW! I boil my chicken in jalapenos and green chilies and use the same water for my pasta. I then add extra green chilies to the dish as I am mixing it. If you want it spicier than add more jalapenos to it.

This was so quick and easy! I sauteed half of a green bell pepper, about 1/3 of an onion, and some garlic powder and added that in. I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Absolutely delicious! Next time I would probably use a little less Velveeta.

didn't like it much.  we usually don't cook with 'cream of...soup', so i think it just tasted fake.  also a little too spicy for my 2 year old with the rotel tomotoes.  if i was making it again, i'd use regular diced.  oh well, i like trying something new, now we know this wasn't a home run for our family.

My picky toddler ate it, so that's enough for me!  Used penne, regular diced tomatoes instead of rotel, and added grated mexican cheese blend.

I enjoyed this recipe by ROGIE.  I made some variations though like adding (2) cans of rotel for spicyness and (2) cans of cheddar cream soup along w/1/2 cup of milk for a creamier sauce. Will definitely be using this recipe again!  :)

I've made a variation of this for years and we love it.  I think it's better with cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.  I also saute a small onion and a bell pepper in butter to add to it.  If you find this too spicy, use mild Rotel or use 1/2 the can.

This a great recipe which I will definitely make again, however, I did not realize how much spice the tomatoes with the chilis would give this.  I saw the quick chicken spaghetti and made this on an 80 degree day.  This will be perfect for a cold winter supper.  Spicy comfort food!

I made this with whole grain penne pasta because that's all I had.. but it turned out FANTASTIC. We all loved it. I can't wait to try it with spaghetti noodles. We all loved how it had a spicy bite. (maybe that was the rotel I used.) But it's a new favorite. There are 3 of us here and I had to freeze half of it because there was so much. Definitally love cheap, delicious, and easy meals! A new favorite!!

This recipe was quick and simple but still tasted great!!!  I used about 14 oz angel hair and added a can of cream of broccoli (because thats all I had!!) so it wouldnt be too dry and it turned out excellent.  Its not much work for such great results!!!

Great recipe, but I've modified to make it even quicker and easier.  I usually cook and SHRED the chicken, while allowing the soup, cheese and tomato mixture to simmer.  I then add the chicken to the soup mixture, and allow to simmer more while cooking the spaghetti.  If you prepare the soup/chicken mixture the night before, dinner is super quick....just warm the sauce and cook the pasta.  I use regular spaghetti instead of angel hair, as I think the thick sauce needs a more substantial pasta then angel hair.  Don't mix together....just serve the sauce over the pasta.  Leftovers are better this way!

Always excited to find something my whole family loves AND is quick & easy! I omitted the shrooms & used 8oz of Velveeta light. I also used Healthy Request soup & mild Rotel. To make it really easy, I bought Louis Rich Southwestern flavored fajita chicken.(precooked- just chop- 2 pkgs.) By the way, angel hair only takes 3-4 min. to cook. I might try Cheez Whiz next time; the chunks of Velveeta take a little while to melt. Love this recipe- thanks so much!

I love this recipe!  My husband is not big on pasta dishes, so I made it for my lunches for the week.  I cut the pasta down to 2 cups and the Velveeta down to 6 oz and used can chicken, just for convenience and I thought it was great!  There was nice spice from the Rotel, but not too much.

Pretty good, we did not have chicken so I just left that ingredient out. I also used jalapeno velveeta cheese  and it was just the right level of spiciness

I was actually surprised how good this was, especially for how easy it was to make - the tomatoes/chiles adds a GREAT touch!! I did use fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and added a little more Velveeta than it called for, but i don't think either of those things changed the recipe enough to say the original wasn't already very very good.  Would definitely make this again.

This was simple and really good. I used fresh mushrooms and added green onions. I cooked them with my chicken Also added some red pepper flakes and garlic to my chicken while it cooked. Had a great flavor. I didn't have cream of chicken so had to use cream of mushroom, still turned out great. Will use the cream of chicken next time, but think cream of anything would work.

My first time making chicken spaghetti.  Used a box of shell pasta, 8 oz of shredded cheddar, and it turned out really creamy.  I thought it could use a little more flavor, but overall ok.

Very good. I used K&N's tandoori chicken cubes hence was not sure how it would turn out. It was very good. :) Also added some Tabasco sauce (about 1 tsp) to it. My recipe was for 2 servings only.

This is a definite keeper! I added more cheese, worchestershire sauce, onion flakes, salt/pepper to taste, Italian seasoning, parsley, paprika, & a little sour cream (not much - powerful taste, try a little & add as needed), chicken bouillon cube. I think that's all I used. It was a HUGE hit & will definitely be making this again soon! (secret is the cheese & sour cream - it transforms this recipe!!)

We are not angel hair pasta fans so I used mini-wagon wheels.  I sauted  1/2 chopped onion, 2 cloves minced garlic and 1 diced zuchini.  I used diced canned tomatoes w/ Italian seasonings.  The dish IS comfort food.  Could use a little more Italian seasoning ... definitely, next time.  The dish reminded of Mac + Cheese w/ chicken.  Indeed, it IS a nice change from marinara and Alfredo sauces.  Yum.

At first I thought this recipe was way to cheesy (and I love cheese) but when I reread it I put more cheese than it called for! OOPS! All in all it was fast, easy & pretty good tasting. The only thing I changed was I cooked my chicken with onion & minced garlic. I will definately try again.

My husband loved this recipe and gave it 5 stars, however, it didn't match my tastes as much so I am giving it 4 stars. I will probably make it again because it is easy and fast. The only thing I changed was I sauted fresh mushrooms when I was cooking the chicken. Thanks for the recipe, it will be good on the days when I am pressed for time.

Husband loved it....I did make some alterations - used leftover rotisserie chicken and grated cheddar cheese ( I don't use processed cheese). Put the cheese, soup &  tomatoes into a glass container and microwaved a minute or so - just to melt the cheese. Added my cooked quinoa veggie curls and tossed it all into a dish. Heated in the oven at 350 for about 15 min. We each ate 2 helpings!

Nice recipe, I will definitely use it again. I did do a few things differently though. The pasta was kind of dry for my taste following the original recipe. So I used 1.5 cans of cream of chicken, cream of mushroom, and rotel. I used Velveeta shredded cheese instead of cubed cheese (it melted wonderfully). I used Tyson already cooked grilled chicken breast, it's seasoned really well and tender. Turned out great, kids loved it and they're a hard to please bunch.

I made this tonight to use up leftover chicken.  I didn't have tomatoes so I used salsa and a dash of hot sauce.  For the cheese, I grated some cheddar, and also used some jalapeño laughing cow.  I mixed it up, put it in a casserole dish, topped it with French fried onions and baked it. I could have eaten the whole pot.  Delicious.

Good quick dish. Shredded a rotisserie chicken to make it easy and not have that canned chicken flavor/texture. Made as directed.  Easy to make any number of additions next time. Diced Romas, pimentos, or maybe some sundried tomatoes.

Very good recipe for those evenings that you're rushed.  I did add a little Chipotle Tobasco sauce for just a little more kick & used cream of mushroom (DH won't eat mushrooms, so I snuck them in this way :-)

Added minced onion & garlic. Made it better. Too bland for us as written. It still is lacking something.

My hubby and I loved it, but kids thought it was too spicy - will make 2 batches next time -one with Rotel, other with seasoned diced tomatoes.  I used piccolini pasta also and it worked perfectly.  Thanks for a quick, tasty recipe!

A great recipe but I changed it a bit. I baked my chicken first and I also used some mushroom and 2 portions of Velveeta so it wouldnt be so salty. Insteady I mostly used shredded cheese and a lil bit of celery. I also used whole wheat noodles. But great recipe

This dish was okay. My husband was not too fond of it because he thought it was too cheesy, so I will probably not make it again. Also, the recipe makes ALOT. I would definitely cut the recipe in half if you don't need to feed that many people.

Ok, so I gave this 3 stars not because it tastes bad or anything but because it seriously tastes like top ramen which I'm not a huge fan of. I thought it was just me but then my hubby commented on the taste similarities. I probably won't make this again.

Great recipe for an old favorite!  I used cheddar cheese but will switch to Velveeta next time for a creamier taste.

I added this to my recipe Box less then 3 weeks ago and have already made it 4 times. My family loves it. I have even told my sister about it and she has made it twice. This is defiantly a new family classic around our house. Great for a quick meal in less then an hour and perfect for a large amount of people. Be sure to make extras my family always wants 2nds. Plus I have a 1 1/2 year old and she also can't get enough.

Even using mild can diced tomatoes with green chile peppers - still a bit too spicy for my kids.  The processed cheese gave it a "slimy" texture.  Won't make it again unless I use a good cheese.

Loved it! I fried 2 chicken breasts in a bit of olive oil with a clove of garlic. While the pasta cooked, I shredded the chicken and added the tomatoes and mushrooms and let that simmer together. I thought this tasted great. It was the perfect amount of cheese for the recipe. Also, this does make ALOT of food!

My hubby and I LOVED this!  Very easy.  I wanted it a little spicy so I used a whole can of regular rotel and half a can of the hot rotel with habaneros.  It was perfect.  I also threw in a handful of shredded cheddar and some sauteed onion.  I wanted to use whole grain pasta and couldn't find angel hair that way so I used whole grain thin spaghetti and it was great in this.  Thanks for such a quick AND tastey recipe!!!

I love chicken spaghetti but haven't been able to find a recipe that I like too well- until this one!  Great flavor and SO easy to make.  Just be sure to read the ingredient amounts very carefully...I didn't the first time and wound up with way too much cheese!

this was pretty good.  its something very easy to make and fast.  the chilies give it a little bit of spice.  its very cheesy and rich.  i added sauteed onions and garlic to it.  this recipe probably wont be considered one of my favorites that i would make a lot but if i needed something fast and something with simple ingredients, this would be it.

I followed the directions given for this recipe and it did not come out as good as I had hoped. The overall taste was very bland and even after adding some seasoning, it still was not enough. My daughter ate one bite and decided that was enough for her. I will not be using this recipe again.

This was very flavorful.  I used mild tomatoes and chiles, and a 1/2 box of small sea shell pasta and omitted the mushrooms. There was just the right amount of sauce for the pasta.  I will be making this one again.

OK but if I make it again I'll reduce the amount of cheese used by about 1/4.
My kids loved it.

Used 2 cans of Cream of Mushroom soup, and the whole 8 oz of Velveeta. Next time, will use spaghetti instead of angel hair. Good, quick and easy.

The 1st 2 times I made this I followed the recipe exactly.  It was the most awesome comfort food, and is on my permanent rotation of family meals.  As written, it is delicious, so this time, I got adventurous and added undrained Rotel, 1/4 tsp. onion powder, and 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder, and it was even better.  DO NOT add salt. When I did, it was way too salty.  Don’t know why I added it anyway.  Thank you for this great meal, and a big thank you for ALLRECIPES.

This was easy and quick. I chose this recipe because it used cream of chicken and not cream of mushroom. I also did not add the mushrooms. I have really picky eater and I had no complaints. Next time I would drain the rotel to tone down the spice a little but even with out draining it wasn’t overly spicy.

Really good as is! This is a great basic recipe to which you can add other ingredients to suit your taste. I I have added diced onion and red & green bell peppers which I cooked with the pasta to save washing another pot.

So I had to substitute thin spaghetti for angel hair, and I didn’t have any jarred mushrooms on hand-But-I did use the 8oz of Velveeta, the (drained) can of Rotel, 2 cups of cooked, cubed chicken breast, and the can of crm of chicken soup, so the base flavors were all there. This was just too much like glue for me, tbh. The flavor wasn’t bad, but it quickly turned into a solid-matter dish...Though I did think it was a creative way to use up leftover seasoned chicken breast. I just wish the texture could have stayed creamy, instead of it tasting much too heavy as soon as it came off of the heat. The few bites I had before that happened were pretty good though! Would not make again, however.

Good for the man!! 
Made a cream sauce with diced onion for the cream of soup, used chicken bouillon to taste, used fire roasted diced tomato and cheddar cheese. Wanted spice so dissolved about 1/4 cup FF jalapenos ( comes in a container like fried  onions ) with the cheese. Made a nice thick cheesy  sauce, added cooked pasta and the leftover  diced chicken, put in casserole, topped with bread crumbs because I was feeling fancy, and baked till bubbly...made a lovely garlic bread....

Not really the same dish...but somehow I got there starting with your idea!! Thank you for helping me use what I have instead of wasteful living!!!

This is delicious! I had canned chicken that I needed a recipe for and this worked perfect. I added some garlic salt and some dill weed to give it a bit more flavor and used regular diced tomatoes since I'm not a fan of spicy.  I did not have processed cheese so I used shredded cheddar cheese which melted easily. I also added some water while it was simmering, and sprinkled parsley flakes on top before serving. Yes I can see us making this again! Thank you!

Really easy meal to make and tastes great!  I omitted the mushrooms,  but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.   I was looking for a different sauce to put on pasta since my husband doesn't like marinara.  This was a hit with both of us.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

Great recipe.  Easy.  The kids loved it!  
I used a rotisserie chicken and added diced sauteed green bell peppers.  The sauce was a little thick, so I would suggest adding a little water or milk.  I also put it in a casserole dish to mix it all together, topped it with shredded cheese and put it in the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese.  Delicious!!!

This is pretty good. I cut the amount of Veleveeta in half and added an equal amount of sharp cheddar to it. 
I used cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of chicken and jar of mushrooms
Baked it at 350 degrees for 40 min

Very good for a quick meal.  Easy to please.  I do add cream of mushroom too.  You can also toss it all into a casserole dish with extra cheese and buttered cracker crumbs on top then toast at 350 for 5-10 min

I found a hack that I think works great: a jar of creamy alfredo sauce in place of cream of chicken soup, a can of Rotel - blend together to smooth out the chunks, add shredded chicken, noodles and Mexican and cheddar cheeses. Top w/extra cheese and Bake at 350 for 20-30 min.

I must not be a fan of chicken spaghetti recipes because this is the second one I tried and it was not anything to write home about.  I agree with another reviewer who said it tasted fake.  I even used shredded cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheese.  I also used salsa (as another reviewer suggested) instead of the diced tomatoes which added a little kick.  But it was still just a little blah.  I probably won't make it again.

We call this mexican spaghetti in my family.  It was good, nice spice w/ the rotel, but not quite right for a main dish.  I'll make this again, but as a side w/ other mexican dishes.

Awesome recipe. I seasoned my chicken with salt pepper and garlic powder before cooking. I believe I used a 14 oz can of tomatoes and a 7 oz jar of mushrooms. Very delicious! I will definately make this again and again!! The second time I made this I used a can of chunk chicken. Probably could've used two cans. I also sauteed some fresh mushrooms instead of the canned which I do prefer.

I was disappointed.  But my husband really liked it.  I didn't like the taste of the tomatos with chile peppers in it.  It gave it a semi southwest flavor.  It also wasn't very creamy and I added a whole additional can of soup.

Everyone seemed to really like this recipe. I reduced the cheese as other reviewers recommended. If I make again, I'll reduce the cheese a bit more, maybe substituting some of the processed cheese for a different kind of cheese.

This was a very different recipe but the more we ate it the better we liked it.  Used penne pasta and fresh mushrooms but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Unusual flavor but we liked it and will probably make again.  Next time I'll try adding some diced onion for flavor.

This is a good recipe with a little "bite."  However, you only need to boil angel hair about 4 minutes.  Check your pasta's directions

This is good, but a little dry and sticky.  I recommend increasing sauce ingredients, or adding milk, and be sure to first mix up the sauce seperately from the pasta.  I also decreased the pasta to about 8 oz. I love this, but the kids think its too spicy.
