(Serve on hot cooked rice) Make rice and cut up everything before you strart. Mixing soy sauce and cornstarch doesn't work to coat the pork instead marinate the pork in 1/2 cup soy sauce,  then just dredge in 1/2 cup cornstarch or enough to coat all the meat lightly and fry in enough hot oil to get a nice crisp coating, turn in pan to fry evenly - No water added. Remove the cooked meat, or move to side of wok or large skillet and add oil to the pan and cook the veggies, (I like to parboil the carrots just to soften a little, drain and add to fry pan - then add pineapple and sauce. You can make your own sauce by mixing the following: The reserved pineapple juice, 1/3 c. sugar 1/3 c. ketchup and 1/3 c. white or cider vinegar, 4 Tb soy sauce and 1 Tb cornstarch - only add a little water if needed.Hint: Sharp kitchen shears work great for cutting pork loin meat into small cubes or strips!

This was very very good!  I didn't have enough sweet and sour sauce on hand, so I added some pineapple juice to what I had to make a cup.  I cut baby carrotts in matchstick pieces (it was all I had on hand) and I omitted the green peppers because I didn't have any.  I served with Jasmine rice.  Even my very picky 7 year old ate this!  It's a keeper!

My husband made this for the two of us and our three children tonight.  Everyone agreed that it was a delicious recipe!  It was very easy and quick to prepare, and our three picky eaters(the youngest of which claims to despise sweet and sour anything!) all cleaned their plates!  Can't ask for more than that!  Served over white rice, this recipe is a keeper for sure!  Thank you!

I really loved this quick and simple recipe. I served it with jasmine rice and my husband loved it. I used fresh pineapple because I had it on hand.When I buy a boneless pork loin, I cut part of it in chunks for  dishes such as this.

I had to make my own sweet and sour sauce. The first review was very helpful with that. I didn't cook my pork as long as the instructions indicated, I browned the meat for ten minutes in oil and no extra water, removed and cooked the veggies until just starting to get tender, added the meat back in and cooked just a few minutes together. I then added in my sauce and pineapple chunks, covered and simmered ten minutes. The pork was so tender and the veggies had just the right amount of crisp to them. I think it needs a bit of hot spice next time, some pepper flakes or cayenne.

First, I used AR's Sweet and Sour Sauce I recipe instead of Kimmoman's (but I did use Kikkoman Soy Sauce to make it). The carrots were not cooked after the 10 minutes they simmered with the pork, so I had to add about another 10 minutes so they weren't crunchy.  I thought they were sliced thinly enough, but maybe not.  And then the green peppers lost all of their color and ended up overcooked (onions were fine).  In the future, I will sauté the peppers, set them aside, and then add at the end along with the pineapple just to warm up.  The presentation would be much nicer, as well, because the green peppers would remain bright green.  But all in all, the pork was very tender, and we liked this.  And it was easy to put together.

I made this recipes last night. we used the pork from the pig we got butchered. the place made a mistake and put the smoked ham in the pork roast package. so... we had sweet and sour smoked ham over roman noodles because we burnt the rice. it was still amazing.

I followed GRAMMA GORGEOUS's direction.  Marinated pork in soy sauce, drained and then rolled in cornstarch.  Fried pork, removed, fried veggies, then simmered both together in sauce and added pineapple near the end.  I used carrot, celery, onion, green and red pepper, sugar snap peas and water chestnut.  Her recipe for sweet & sour was a little tart.  Next time I'll reduce the vinegar a bit.

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site.  I usually omit the fresh veggies and toss in froze stir-fry vegetables.  I serve this over rice for a tasty, super-quick weekday meal.

This recipe gets four stars. If I were ranking it compared to restaurant Chinese food, it would get three stars because it's not as good as one will find in most decent Chinese restaurants, but as an easy to prepare home version--it's very good.  My wife and son both enjoyed it. I'm not sure why cornstarch is used with soy sauce because the soy sauce/cornstarch mixture does not provide breading, or if it was supposed to, it didn't work for me.  Still, the receipe was tasty and easy to prepare.  When I'm hungry for Chinese food, I won't hesitate to make this again.

Good recipe, except no sour, so I added 1 tbsp of vinegar and 1 tsp hot chili paste for a kick, only used 1/2 cup of sauce, don't like it too wet.
We all enjoyed it!

This recipe turned out great! I didn't follow it exactly, but only little changes. I used red and green peppers, purple? onion, and carrots. I cut the carrots kinda chunky. I also used more water, then used the leftover pineapple juice from the crushed pineapple and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes. I added the chunky carrots during this time. It turned out great, everyone had empty plates! I will definitely be using this again!

My family gave this one a 10.  Everyone loved it.  I didn't have Sweet & Sour sauce as the recipe called for and I substitued 1/3 cup brown sugar,1/3 cup rice vinegar and 1/3 cup ketchup and it worked great.  Delicious and fairly fast to make.

This is a good recipe for standard sweet and sour pork. The flavor was good and the veggies cooked up nicely. Instead of buying premade sauce, I made some using the Wow! sweet and Sour sauce recipe on this site. I cooked the sauce separately and did not add any sauce or water to the skillet, so the meat and veg just cooked in the hot oil. Definitely a keeper with the adjustments.

Was a great and simple recipe. Did a little alteration . Seasoned the pork cubes with seaoning salt and ginger flavoured soy sauce before dredging with corn starch and sautéing for about 8-10 mins on medium heat ( until brown)
I made a sauce like "Gramma Gorgeous" . Didn't have vinegar on hand so I used red cooking wine . The veg I had on hand (broccoli and carrots )

This was a great quick and easy dinner.  Served over some rice with eggrolls on the side.  Used a different brand sauce and fresh pineapple.  I'll make again.

I tried this recipe and I have to say that is was very good! My kids hate onions and bell peppers where I love them. I tried it without the onions and peppers and used a can of baby carrots that I cut up and a can of small english peas. Zero leftovers! They ate the whole thing! WOW!

Too much sauce for my tastes, had to let this reduce under high heat for an extra 5-10 minutes just to get it down from soupy to stew.  Next time, I could use half a cup of the sweet and sour sauce.  Otherwise, good recipe.

I liked the recipe but it was too sweet for my taste. Also there is nothing quick about it ,sure after everything is chopped up, I also like more heat! Will not make it again, just not to my liking!

This  was very good. I was looking for a quick and easy sweet and sour pork and this fit the bill. I used frozen Asian veggies (defrosted first) and left out the pineapple. Was still good!

I made this recipe but quadrupled it for a large family dinner.
It was fabulous!! The changes I made were,  1/2 cup soy sauce to marinade 5 pounds of cut up meat. Then dredged about 1/2 of the meat in cornstarch and frying it in small amounts in a non stick wok. Half way thru ...taking plenty of time I chose to put about 1/4 cup of cornstarch over the rest of the meat, mixed it well then fried the rest of the meat , turning it to try to fry all sides of meat.  Then added the rest of the raw vegetables and cooked meat to the pan. After stirring I cooked the dish for 20 minutes, covered.  I added the sweet sour sauce , heated then tossed in the pineapple.  I like it a bit sweeter so about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar were sprinkled on top of dish. WOW the family loved the dish.

So good that it's gone I added bok choy and water chestnuts. I will definitely make this again. I did all my prep the day before I actually made the meal. That was a Time Saver come dinner time come dinner time.

Used Kroger brand sweet and sour sauce instead of Kikkoman. Tasted just like the sweet and sour pork we used to get at our favorite Chinese restaurant.

This recipe leaves the pork overcooked and the veggies undercooked. I suggest removing the pork after it has been browned, cooking the onion and carrots for 5min and then adding all the other ingredients. 

I agree that the soy sauce and cornstarch does not work as a coating.

We liked it and will do again.  Mine needed a little more water.  I cooked rice with a beef broth cube, some chopped carrot and added frozen English peas to the rice when cooked and topped with the pork.  Very easy and good.

This was just okay. It wasn't awful but I've had better sweet and sour pork.  It really didn't have much flavor at all prepared as directed.
