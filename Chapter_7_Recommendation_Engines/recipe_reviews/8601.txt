I didn't add the red pepper flakes but I did everything else. The only thing I think is that this needs a small touch of salt. One thing I found though is that if you don't add in the oil with the crumb mixture but rather spray it on before baking it makes them crispier. We personally liked it this way better. We also used boneless skinless chilcken thighs instead of the breasts and like that better too. Great recipe!

this was a good recipe, but was not kid freindly. If you would like it kid freindly delete the red pepper and half the black pepper. I aslo used a whole cup of bread crumbs because we do not like wheat germs. They tasted great. So enjoy.

Wow! These are great and not bad for you at all compared to normal chicken nuggets. I think it took longer to cut the chicken up than anything else. I used a Italian herbs mix rather than the herbs listed. Also, I did not add oil to the dry mix, I drizzled the nuggets once they were on the cookie sheet. I think that I might try breading and freezing them then pulling them out to cook at my convinience. UPDATE: I now make a double batch and freeze half. Once defrosted, I make them exactly the same and they turn out great. My husband is usually a snob about frozen meat and he was surprised to hear (after he finished eating) that they had been frozen.

These were amazing! One thing to keep in mind: They are very spicy due to both the ground black pepper and the crushed red pepper. Next time I will omit the red pepper and half the black.

They were easy to prepare and done quickly. However, they didn't get as crispy as I would have liked. Next time I will cook them longer or put them under the broiler.


EDIT: I've made these again and they turned out much crispier. I double breaded them. I first marinated them in Italian dressing, then dipped them in the bread crumb mixture, then dipped them in the egg and then back in the bread crumb mixture. Also, I baked them on a wire rack on top of a baking sheet according to the recipe. Hope this helps!

These are really easy, fast and yummy! The only problem I had was that they didn't get very crispy, but I may have undercooked them a few minutes in an attempt to keep them from getting OVER done. I used Italian seasoning and Italian bread crumbs, and added some powdered garlic. My 2 year old LOVES them! Definitely a keeper!

really good and tasty. I used olive oil instead of veggie oil, though, which made it even tastier! Thanks, Amy!

These turned out so moist, tender, and yummy, with just the right amount of crisp-ness on the outside.  I was worried they would dry out from the high cooking temp, but they were perfect.  Served with Honey Mustard Dressing II also from Allrecipes.  Used only 2 chicken breasts and almost didn't have enough bread crumb mixture.  I used Trader Joe's bread crumbs to eliminate trans-fats.  I omitted the veggie oil and they were perfect!

My whole family loves this recipe.  My two year old cleans his plate every time I make these.  I have discovered that straining the chicken out of the egg mixture with a slotted spoon helps the breading to stick to the chicken better.

You need to at least double the cooking time or they will not get cooked through.

Usually it drives me crazy when people post reviews of recipes they have changed so much it hardly is even the same recipe that it began as. Hopefully I did not go TOO far, but I do acknowledge I changed quite a few things in this recipe. Anyways, for my breading I used 1/3 cup of regular bread crumbs, 1/3 cup of Panko, about 3 TBS of granulated Parmesan, a few shakes of seasoned salt and 1/2 TSP of the following: black pepper, cayenne pepper, thyme, parsley and basil.  I wanted to cut some of the calories/cholesterol, so I used around 1 cup of 2% milk with a few TSP of white vinegar and eighty-sixed the eggs as well as the oil in the breading.  I used 2 very large chicken breasts (probably 1.75 lbs) which I cut in half the long way before cutting into bite sized pieces. Several reviewers suggested cooking these longer, so I decided to cook them for 20 minutes, I was making mashed cauliflower and forgot to take them out until closer to 25 minutes, but they were perfect. Also, I baked them on a rack I placed over a cooking sheet so they would not be soggy on the bottom or require me to flip them. Whipped up a very easy honey mustard sauce to go with these -- about 60/40 spicy brown mustard and honey respectively then flavor it with black pepper to taste and add a little mayo at a time until the consistency is perfect â€“ but obviously that is just my preference.    Great recipe, it is beyond me how as of now this is not the highest rated nugget  recipe on the site!

Quick and delicious! I had everything on hand and they were prepped and baked in under 25 mins. 
The only personal change I made was to use 1/2 cup of panko crumbs in place of the wheat germ because I wanted them extra crunchy

Really tasty! They came out crispy on the outside, nice and tender on the inside. One little tweak that gave them a little extra crunch: I didn't have any wheat germ, so I crushed some bran flakes cereal instead. My husband and I loved them - this recipe will definitely go into the favorites book!

I made these for my kids for lunch, but I enjoyed them just as much as they did.  I forgot to add the oil in with the spices.  I just added all of the spices directly to my bag, added the chicken, and then realized my mistake.  So after I put the chicken on the baking sheet, I sprayed the nuggets with some baking spray.  This is the first recipe that I have made that has crisped up.  Usually we have chicken nuggets that the coating ends up gooey and falling off the chicken.  These were perfect - love the spices!

I combined this recipe with another nugget recipe on this site. I added 2 tablespoons of sesame seeds. These turned out really well, but I think when I make this recipe again, I'll either double the spices or I'll add more of a different spice as they turned out a little bland. Making a dipping sauce on the side helped. I loved the addition of the wheat germ and none of my family members noticed that's what was coating their chicken.

I decided to make this chicken as full breasts, instead of cutting them into nuggets.  The final result was juicy and crispy, tasted like fried chicken, only healthier!  Like the other reviewes suggested, I did not add the oil to the mix.  I drizzled it over the chicken while it was on the baking sheet, after being breaded.  Also, I didn't have wheat germ, so I used a 3/4 cup of bread crumbs, garlic salt, table salt, red pepper and minced onion.  This recipe was a huge hit!

Fantastic! A healthier version that satisfies my cravings for fried chicken. I'm looking forward to playing with the herbs but the basic recipe is definitely worth a try.

These weren't a hit in our house.  They didn't taste very good and the bread crumb mixture didn't stick very well to the chicken using the method in the recipe.  I would leave out the oil and coat the chicken in a flat pan next time, not a bag.  Then maybe spray it once it's on the baking sheet to achieve browning.  Using milk or buttermilk for the egg mixture helps with the taste I've found in previous recipes.

EXCELLENT!  I served this with Clone of a Pretzel Dip and it was perfect.  Sweet potato fries and a salad are my choices for sides.   I used fresh herbs from my garden.   The baking time and temperature was perfect.   Thank you Amy for sharing your EXCELLENT recipe!

I didn't have any wheat germ, so I had to sub with more seasoned breadcrumbs.  Next time I make them, I will definitely try it with the WG.  These were very good!.  I love trying to find ways of trying NOT to fry things, and this was great!  I highly suggest playing with this recipe if only with the spices (because every family is different).

This is the best chicken nugget recipe I've found!  I've tried some others, but they were not nearly as flavorful!  Instead of wheat germ, I crush either saltines or wheat Ritz crackers.  Either work just fine & you can't tell the difference.  We make this with a honey mustard dressing that I got on here & they are a favorite in our house!

I really didn't like this recipe, unfortunately. It was very dry and bland. Maybe someone else will have better luck, though.

I loved these nuggets.  Easy to make, very tender and juicy, good flavor.  Cooking time was perfect.  I made them just like the recipe using all bread crumbs (have never used wheat germ but will try it next time) and olive oil instead of veg. Maybe my pinch of red pepper was small, but my very picky kids both had two helpings.  Will definitely make these again!

I found this recipe to be lacking in good, cohesive flavor overall. After reading reviews, the only change I made was tenderizing the chicken beforehand to reduce the density. This made the cook time perfect.

Great crunch. Ok flavor.  I halved the amt of chicken and eggs, but kept the seasons the same. Then used bran flakes (in place of bread crumbs, which was a little bran-tasting, but fine) and ground flax (in place of wheat germ). I tried a few with cornmeal too, which was lighter.

I loved the idea of making a healthy version of a chicken nugget.  I modified this a little bit.  I cut the chicken breasts into 1 x 1 inch pieces (nugget sized).  I substituted bread crumbs for the wheat germ.  In addition to the herbs and spices listed,  I also added sesame seeds.  I sprayed lightly with olive oil spray and baked for twenty five minutes at 400 degrees.  Delicious!!

I used skinless & boneless thighs. I substituted herbs with 2tsp mixed herbs, and used 1cup panko crumbs instead of breadcrumbs and wheatgerm as that was what I had already. I didn't put the oil in but sprayed them all over with canola oil before baking. Very nice and definitely much nicer than brought ones. It is a keeper.

Delicious! I didn't have the wheat germ so I just used a full cup of bread crumbs. I also saw the warnings about the heat of the dish, so I left out the red pepper flakes. These were WAY better than anything you can buy frozen.

There were really good! I did 1 cup of bread crumbs because I didn't have wheat germ on hand. My oven was a little broken, and wouldn't heat up to 425, so I baked it on 375 for 18 minutes. crispy and delicious!

This was great!  Easy to prepare.  I baked on one side for 10 mins and 5 for the other.  The chicken turned out juicy on the inside, and crispy on the outside.   Went perfectly with raw honey for dipping.  Will be using this recipe again!

I did this MOSTLY to recipe directions. Yummy! Looking for â€˜dipping saucesâ€™ an Allrecipe recipe called Sesame Chicken Strips with Sweet Sauce one of the reviews a woman added dill to the sweet sauce â€“ OMG â€“ dill in that sauce is totally addictive, also added a little almond milk. I had oat bran instead of wheat germ (none on hand) then 1/3 cup sesame seeds to breading. Asian grocery stores carry very nutritious sesame seeds inexpensively. Next time I make Iâ€™ll do the review â€˜nkki_dwâ€™ â€“ she doubled breading, 1st marinated chicken in Italian dressing then dipped in bread crumbs, then egg dipped then another round in the bread crumbs. Some of the reviews said the time in cooking was off. 10 minutes worked on our oven, browning the crust. I also made a hot sauce that my husband liked better than the sweet sauce. This is a real keeper.

These are fantastic and so simple to make!  First, the changes: I used dried parsley instead of fresh, substituted more bread crumbs for wheat germ, and I drizzled olive oil over the breaded nuggets.  Next time, I will coat the chicken with flour first, then egg.  I will also probably make more breading mixture and bread each nugget in a pan rather than a bag as the coat came out splotchy and irregular.

Hey, these were so well received tonight ! Thanks for the great recipe.  I think having the tbsp of vegetable oil in the dry mix helped to keep the chicken moist, but crispy on the outside.   I also replaced the wheat germ with shredded parmesean, and added a teaspoon of salt as mentioned in another review.  Anyways, my family loved it ! I served it with dipping sauces such as honey-mustard, barbecue, and ranch dressing.  Thank you!

I admit I didn't follow the recipe completely, didn't have wheat germ so I used more breadcrumbs and it tasted well....too "bready" The next day I pan fried the leftovers and they turned crispy and good!

I made this for dinner with some sweet potato fries the other night and my husband and I both loved it!  The only thing I did differently was to not use the olive oil.  I dipped the chicken in the egg mixture then put all the pieces right in the bag with the spices and shook it up really well.  Once on my baking sheet, I used some olive oil cooking spray and gave them a quick douse so they would crisp up.  I spritzed the other side of the nuggets when I turned them over.  Worked well and was super-tasty!

Great recipe.  Instead of the thyme, basil and red pepper I used a Italian seasoning mix and they tasted great!  My boyfriend loved them and asked me to make them again the following day.  The are great dipped in a bit of BBQ sauce.

These Chicken nuggets were great!! The only change I included was to add a little Parmesan cheese to the mixture to add some zing and salt. Great recipe!

*Update*
I have made these several times now, and I wanted to try freezing them so I would not have to go through the hassle of making them from scratch again. Even though these chicken nuggets are great, moist and juicy, when they are fresh, they are very dry when they are baked again. I would not recommend freezing them.

Seemed a little too "herb-y" for me and I left out the parsley (didn't have it).  I'd make these again, but cut down on the thyme and maybe add some Parmesan cheese to the breading.  It was pretty quick and easy.

Very good recipe!  I cut the wheat germ out of the recipe, and cut back on the oil, and found this to be a very tasty way to do chicken nuggets.

No leftovers with this recipe. I also used boneless, skinless thighs. They were very tasty, but it took a long time trimming the fat and cutting them into pieces. I used multi-grain Club crackers instead of wheat germ. The fresh parsley was very flavorful. Tasted great with BBQ sauce.

These were SO delicious! I made them as a snack for some friends and they LOVED them.  These taste really good with ranch sauce. I 'm starting to make them all the time!

All the spices were wonderful together, i might use ground red pepper instead of the flakes next time because there were random hot spots.  I also would cut smaller pieces   to make them crispier.  I made a honey mustard sauce to go along side. wonderful!

Simple and tasty chicken recipe.  I omitted the red pepper as I do not like those.  But it was still great!  My husband loved it.  I am going to make it again for dinner tonight!

Excellent taste. Very easy to make. I omitted the red pepper flakes (didn't have any) and they still had a spicy taste. Also omitted the oil, they don't need it! I need to find an alternative to bread crumbs to skip the trans fat, but other than that wonderful. I'll definitely make these again!

These were really good, the kids liked them and so did my husband.  We aren't big on wheat germ so I used cornmeal in it's place and they turned out just fine.  I also omited the red pepper flakes as suggested in another review.

We loved this chicken! I did a few things differently that made it nice and crunchy, and reduced the calories a little. I used halved chicken breasts, and substituted panko crumbs for the bread crumbs and wheat germ, keeping the seasonings the same. Instead of dredging the chicken in egg, I dredged in 1% milk, which is healthier and less messy. The chicken turned out perfectly. I would really watch the cooking time if cutting the chicken into nuggets as overcooking could make the chicken a little dry tasting. #HealthyWinterDinner

I used fresh basil and only needed 1 egg as I use jumbo double yolk eggs. I also added salt to the dry ingredients. It was delicious. Quick and easy. I served it with chilli mayonnaise. An absolute hit.

These are very good and very easy to make. I definitely missed the salt, but that's just because I like salt a little too much. I omitted the oil, but gave them a light spray of olive oil cooking spray before placing them in the oven and I don't feel I lost anything. I did not have quite enough coating for four chicken breasts, but it was pretty close. 

I did not find this overly spicy like some. I calculated the calories as I went and these were surprisingly low considering the breading (cooking without fats is awesome!).

to reviewer under "MOST HELPFUL"  where does it claim these are gourmet chicken nuggets?  your comment is not a review!

I used everything except for the red chili pepper flakes and I added garlic powder.  I had a recipe for a fried chicken salad and I used this recipe in place of the fried chicken and it was really good!

This recipe is great! They turned out extremely yummy. I may try adding more red pepper flakes, I didn't really get much of a spice kick out of it. But otherwise, completely worth it. A lot better than store bought chicken nuggets and even better than McDonalds. I even made chicken strips using this and they were just as yummy.

it was ok the kids thought it was bland, the mix was sticky and hard to keep on the chicken to make it even. With some bbq sauce it was ok, was just like backed chicken, I would make them again but tweak it to my taste, its healthier then store bought. I also used panko bread crumbs instead

I added Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs, tripled the recipe, used chicken thighs, added 1 tsp and 1/4 tsp of salt and baked two racks(I did switch racks after turning the nuggets over)at once! 

All three of my boys loved the nuggets. Recipe is already a staple! 

Thank you for sharing!

FYI-If you want crispier nuggets, use Panko bread crumbs and not regular ones. It really makes a difference.

These came out perfectly. The only thing I did differently was add about 2 Tbs. of honey to the egg mixture to give the nuggets more flavor. Although I'm a vegetarian, everyone who ate these said they were delicious! Thanks for the easy, quick, and tasty recipe!

Great recipe! My husband and I really liked it. I left out the veg oil, b/c I was worried it would clump up the breading and it seemed unnecessary nutritionally.  I love the wheat germ - nice way to sneak in good things without the "too healthy" taste.  I used homemade whole wheat bread crumbs that were not seasoned, so I added a teaspoon or so of salt, and it was plenty flavorful.

Not my best homemade nuggets, but they worked. I did not use the wheat germ - I swapped it for more bread crumbs. I am not sure how big the chicken breasts are for others, but$four would be way to much for the amount of breading.

I made these for my family.  I cooked them at 435F instead of 425F just to be sure they would be done.  They came out great.  I coated the chicken with the eggs and then put into a strainer with a bowl underneath as I had 3 chicken breasts and there was a lot of leftover egg.  I combined the dry ingredients into a zip lock (to save a bowl) and then put in the egg dipped chicken.   Then shake the bag to coat.  I used Italian seasoning, garlic powder and bread crumbs.  I then put the chicken on a baking sheet and drizzled with light olive oil.  I've added it to my recipe box - It's a keeper!

These are great, I just added some ground flax seed as well as wheat germ and used whole wheat bread crumbs instead of white, and instead of the vegetable oil I used a flavourless coconut oil because the health benefits are far better. The only reason I gave it a 3 out of 5 was because there are some better healthier options you could have applied, but excellent idea.

Made these for my husband and son, just used 1 cup bread crumbs and no wheat germ. They gobbled these up, and the recipe makes a lot of chicken nuggets; more than they could eat and that is saying something! My son is 2 and loved these, so I think they are kid friendly. Served them with mashed potatoes and steam bag veggies, very easy.

The herbs make this recipe awesomely flavorful and my kids love it!  I usually add 2 Tablespoons of parmesan cheese to the dry ingredients, and I subsitute egge beaters for the whole eggs.  Sometimes I don't have wheat germ on hand, so I just substitute any kind of cracker crumbs (plain or flavored, etc.)  We love to dip these nuggets in a honey mustard sauce made of:  1/4 cup fat-free mayonnaise, 1 Tablespoon prepared mustard, 1 Tablespoon honey and 1/2 Tablespoon lemon or lime juice. So yummy... thanks for the recipe!

DELICIOUS!! Only thing I didn't use was the red pepper flakes because I didn't have any. Made them into chicken fingers instead of nuggets because my husband is THAT picky, but he loved them!  I will definitely be making this regularly.

Omitted the wheat germ and used 6 breasts (had to scale the recipe).  Omitted the red pepper flakes as I know the kids wouldn't eat them.  BUT, after I made the kids tray, I added with a heavy hand Louisiana Hot Sauce to the egg mixture.  OUTSTANDING!  Thanks, it was a hit for everyone!

Yeah, these are good.  I don't know about wheat germ, I just used all bread crumbs.  I like the spices listed, but I added garlic and onion powder as well.  Don't forget to add SALT!!!  I noticed someone mentioned these could use some, and they are right.  I believe that's what "seasoned bread crumbs" means, but salt probably should be listed separately on the ingredients list.  Tasty.

I followed the recipe except that I substituted flax seed for wheat germ because I didn't have any, and it turned out fine.  I pounded my chicken thin so that it would cook quickly and evenly.  My kids gobbled it up (although my 4 year old cried when she got a hot pepper on her tounge, and I really only put it in the tiniest pinch).

These were delicious! Cook time was perfect! I marinated my chicken overnight in an olive oil, chicken broth, garlic, salt, pepper blend. Then I used the egg, coated the pieces, and battered them up! I used Italian seasoning for the other spices, plus some garlic salt/pepper. My husband loved these and so did I! He didn't even know there was wheat germ in them...I love sneaking in nutrition! I have some leftover that I plan on turning in to chicken parmesean! :)

I made a few modifications to this recipe and it turned out very good, and even healthier. I used 3/4 cup panko bread crumbs and 2 T parmesan cheese along with the rest of the spices mentioned in the original recipe. I completely left out the vegetable oil as it didn't seem necessary. As another reviewer suggested, I used a slotted spoon so that excess egg could drip off the nuggets easily before dipping them in the bread crumb mixture. After I laid the nuggets out on the cookie sheet, I sprayed them with some coconut oil cooking spray. For a dipping sauce, I combined equal parts dijon mustard and honey, mixed with a little basil. I served this with a side of rice and steamed vegetables which made for a beautiful presentation! My boyfriend loved it. This is a keeper for sure!

These were great.  I boiled the chicken first for 5-10 minutes and it made it easier to coat and that way i had no problem with the chicken being undercooked as some people did.

This was great. I would subtract points for the time spent cutting up the chicken, or how bulky the breading process was, but even so these nuggets were great! They are so tender and juicy. I love the herbed breading. Next time I would bread the chicken in smaller batches OR put it in a bigger bag - gallon sized. Wheat germ is what brought me here initially, trying to find a way to use it, and I did. The only change I made was a few sprinkles of poultry seasoning, and no oil in the breading step (just sprayed the nuggets with oil as they were going in the oven). UPDATE: This freezes and reheats well. Just move the nuggets to the frig the day or morning before cooking.

These were a pretty good homemade alternative to fast food chicken nuggets.  I changed a few things based on what I had on hand: I used all dried herbs; I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I used Japanese panko and added some all purpose seasoning and paprika (just eyeballed the amount); I didn't add the red pepper flakes; I didn't put the oil in the breading bag, instead I sprayed cooking spray on the pan, put the breaded chicken in the pan, then sprayed a little more cooking spray on top of the chicken.  They turned out moist and also tasted good the next day.

I made these for dinner tonight and they were quick and delicious. I added 2 tblsp of cornmeal and used 3/4 cup breadcrumbs and 1/4 panko crumbs. The result was crispy and delicious. My boyfriend raved over them  - definitely a healthy alternative to traditional chicken nuggets.

These were quick and easy. I omitted the thyme and used plenty of garlic powder and extra of all the other herbs and seasonings. I substituted olive oil for veg oil and they came out good. We put them on top of a spinach salad w/ light Italian dressing.

Delicious! I've made this several times already. I didn't have thyme or fresh parsley, but I used some dried rosemary and shredded parmesan cheese. Other than that my only recommendation would be to drip a little bit of olive oil on the nuggets when they are on the baking dish instead of adding it to the bag. This adds flavor and keeps the chicken tender while keeping the seasoning mixture intact. Who knew wheat germ could taste so good?

A great recipe. I omitted the crushed red pepper flakes and added some paprika in its place.

Pretty good! The cook time is spot-on for 1 to 1 1/2 inch cubes of nugget. I use a pre-made Italian bread crumb mix for this, no oil added. Just toss in egg, then in the bag of crumbs, then bake it. Pretty simple and tasty mix!

I had some leftover herbed breadcrumbs from a different recipe (with the same herbs and spices minus the red pepper flakes), so I used that to coat the chicken. The only difference was my mixture had Parmesan cheese. I did add the wheat germ, which I thought added a nice texture. I only used 3 chicken breasts and it was exactly the right amount of breadcrumb mixture; if I had done 4, I wouldn't have had enough. I liked these and felt I was eating a much healthier alternative to battered and fried nuggets, but the family didn't care for them (not for lack of flavor, but rather because they prefer battered while I prefer breaded). I did cook them 5 minutes longer than the recipe said. I would make them again for myself when my husband is out of town, but I think next time I will place them on a cooling rack on a baking sheet so I don't have to flip them.

Although I didn't necessarily follow the exact spices, what I did love is how to bake it - on a high temperature for a short time, it comes out so absolutely soft and moist inside, while crunchy outside too! 
Thank you for the recipe!
Once it comes out of the oven, move the nuggets around so that they don't get soggy underneath.
By the way, a great spice for this type of chicken is Montreal steak spice. So flavorful in addition to the regular spices.

I will definitely make this again, but with a few changes. First, I will dredge the chicken in S&P flour before the egg dip. I may try mixing ranch dressing into the egg mixture. I will double the herbs (at least!) except for the red pepper. I will add 1/2 tsp of salt to the wheat germ/breadcrumb mixture. Also, since the idea of the recipe is to go a little healthy, I'll add some nutritional yeast to the wheat germ/breadcrumb mixture. I think these changes will make it more to my taste, but it is definitely a good recipe to start. Like others, I didn't realize that the oil needed to be added to the dry ingredients and sprayed it on afterward. As a tip, if you bake them on a rack on top of your pan in the oven, they get nice and crispy.

Was delicious! although my 4yr old was not too crazy about it, she did say that was good, although I did make my own ketchup. I think two new things at once was not too smart of me to offer her. One tip I really appreciate was cooking on a cookie cooling rack which was on a regular baking sheet it cooked the nuggets all the way through.  thanks for sharing

I made it from according to some of the suggestions of the reviewers. It was very good once I decreased the pepper. I added 1/4 cup ground flax seed for additional nutrition. Made a double batch, enough to feed my family, plus have some for lunch the next day.

I used a 50/50 ratio of corn meal and GF flour for the wheat germ and crushed rice cereal for the bread crumbs since my mother is Gluten-Free. I have made this at least 5 times already first using chicken thighs and then moving on to sirloin steak to make chicken fried steak. since this is made in the oven, I don't have to use a deep fryer. going to add to the cookbook and making again today.                                                         Update: I did shorten the spices a little bit but it is still GREAT. Adding Panko bread crumbs Should be great but just don't use the whole wheat ones. Those didn't work out so well.

My son has a very basic pallet so I just used "italian" bread crumbs and added a little bit of corn meal. I didn't use any of the herbs, just let the seasoning in the bread crumbs do the flavoring. I think next time I'll put a little more in there. He ate 1 1/2 chicken breasts of this! He's 8 years old and really liked it. Really easy to do and I felt like a "mom win" vs so often when I'm scrambling for dinner and have a "mom fail".

These were really good and crunchy. The only changes I made was to use gluten free bread crumbs and gluten free panko crumbs instead of the wheat germ. I sprayed the top of them with Pam Spray and they came out crispy.  I have tried to make other chicken nuggets crispy but they never turned out. Thank you Definitely a keeper.

As written, this recipe is bland.  Needs a lot more spice and herb added to enhance flavor.  I added salt, onion and garlic powders, more crushed red pepper, and some dried thyme.  Wheat germ doesn't crisp, so used panko instead.  Too many changes required for me to keep this one.

These were just ok. The recipe calls for four chicken breasts. I think she means halves. I used halves and there still wasn't enough coating and I had to make more. Next time I'll stick to Shake-n-Bake.

I didn't have wheat germ so I just omitted it. I dipped this in a "honey/mustard" sauce recipe that I found on here. YUMMY Oh, and I used Panko instead of the bread crumbs stated here.

Delicious! I used more Italian bread crumbs instead of the wheat germ. I also omitted the oil and instead sprayed the chicken with cooking spray before putting in the oven. I left it in the oven for a little over 20 minutes and they came out nice and crispy!

5 stars for taste! Even my 2 yr old who doesn't usually like chicken ate these.  4 stars because I had to double the amount of breading and still had just barely enough, even though I only used 3 chicken breasts. Could have used just one egg because I had a lot left over. I changed a couple other things as well.  Used 2/3 c bread crumbs, 3 Tbsp flour, 4 Tbsp parmesan cheese for breading, subbed 1 1/2 tsp Italian Seasoning for the separate herbs, and omitted red pepper.  Served with Yummy Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce on this site.  As my 3 1/2 yr old says: 'Licious!

I loved this recipe , as did my brother in law and sister. I found the thyme was a bit much, so i wouldnt add as much next time. But everything else turned out great, also i did have to double the ingredients for the coating, but i did do strips instead of cubes.

I liked that these are baked instead of fried. The chicken turns out nice and moist and they have a good flavor. I added salt to the crumb mixture (gotta have salt). I was out of crushed red pepper so used cayenne instead.

These were very tasty-my kids & hubby LOVED them!  They brown up nicely if you cook them longer-I just kept checking till they looked right. I used a 3 lb bag of chicken tenders and doubled the ingredients.  I did not have any wheat germ so I just substituted panko bread crumbs.  I also did not use the red pepper flakes due to the kids.  I will use this recipe over and over!

These were delicious!  The only difference I made was that I used olive oli instead of vegtable.  I usually have to dip my chicken nuggets in ranch or honey mustard, but not this time!  This one's a keeper.

These were okay. I'm not sure why everyone is so concerned with the red pepper flake, one pinch wasn't at all noticable to me or my husband and he can't tolerate spicy things like I can. Although there are enough seasonings here to make this fairly flavorful for some reason they were just really bland. We ate them but I wouldn't make them again, I don't think it was because of any fault in the recipe this just wasn't for us. One thing I do like about the recipe is the oven baked aspect. I love the idea of taking traditionally fried foods and converting them into healthier baked items.

This was good. I do agree this was bland because it has no salt. That is all I would add next time. I broiled it a bit to make the outside crunchy. I liked the small kick the red pepper flakes added.

I'm afraid we didn't care for these at all.  Pretty bland and not at all crunchy, I even tried broiling them briefly to crisp them up, without success.  So sorry, but I can't recommend these.

To my this simply tasted liked your typical chicken cutlets cut into smaller pieces.  Next time around i will def try to add some more spice, maybe try Panko bread crumbs and more cheese.

I deleted the wheat germ and used a full cup of bread crumbs and added garlic and herb seasonings to the dry mix. I also cooked the chicken for 10 minutes on each side, not 10/5. Very yummy!

these presented beautifully! they were cooked perfectly and i made them to recipe except for the oil suggestion and the red pepper flakes because i was feeding the children. son gave them 5 stars but we had to balance with the rest of the family!i baked them in a cast iron skillet.

These were ok.  Nothing special.  I like the weight watchers version better.

These were good. I usually make recipes exactly as stated the first time, and then go from there. This one, I'm sure I'll try again with a few changes.

I thought these were a very good idea. For some reason my breading didn't coat properly. I'll dip the pieces into the egg wash seperatly next time & I think that will take care of it. This was great along side creamy mac & cheese. Fall comfort food.

These are really good! Just made them.  I didn't have chicken breasts so I used the thighs I had on hand (removed the fat).  I didn't have eggs so I used water. For seasoning, I used Lawry's Perfect Blend Seasoning & Rub for chicken & poultry. I took the advice of some of the others here and doubled the cooking time. FINALLY, I have found a good substitute for McDonald's! I kept finding recipes with Parmesan cheese, which were good with spaghetti but not as a replacement for fast food.  THANK YOU!!!  My extremely picky 4 year old LOVES them!!

Instead of bread crumbs, I used ground nuts for lower carbs. I'm not sure if that caused it to be a bit bland, so I suggest adding some Parmesan and salt to the coating to jazz it up a bit. Then they are great...and healthy!

Very yummy! I made these for me and hubby for superbowl and they were a hit! I didn't change the recipe at all. It was very easy and quick to prepare! The wheat germ and the fact that they aren't fried makes them a lot healthier too! Will defiently made them again!

I followed the recipe with the only exception was using olive oil instead of veg oil and I added cayenne pepper. My husband and I thought these turned out a bit bland. There was some flavor it was missing.
