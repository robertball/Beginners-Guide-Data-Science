Delicious!  I basically followed the recipe with a few additions and baked it in the oven.  Used only 2 Tbs. tomato paste, and 1 red bell pepper since that is what I had, large chop.  Additions were:  2 carrots and 2 ribs of celery both sliced on bias, 3 Tbs. minced ginger, 2 chopped and seeded jalapeno peppers for a hint of heat, 4 star anise, and 1 tsp. sesame oil.  Sprinkled ribs with seasoned salt and black pepper before adding the sauce.  Used a large 12" frying pan with a lid so I  didn't have to fool with covering with foil.  Baked at 350 degrees for 2 hours covered, then 1/2 hour uncovered to reduce sauce.  It was wonderfully full of flavor and will make again.  This was the first time I had made them without browning the ribs first and it didn't seem to make a difference.  However, I did pull the ribs up from the bottom of the pan after removing the lid so they could get a little brown.  Skimmed fat from sauce after removing other ingredients.  UPDATE:  Made again, but simmered on top of the stove.  Increased brown sugar to 2/3 c., vinegar to 1/3 c., and added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon.  Reserved 2 Tbs. pineapple juice to add at end with 2 Tbs. of cornstarch to thicken sauce; and set aside pineapple chunks for later. Added carrots, celery, and bell pepper after 1 hour to preserve flavor and texture; added pineapple chunks after 2 hours; added cornstarch slurry at end, cooked 5 minutes. Flavor is fantastic and better than before.  Cooked extra 30 min. because extra thick ribs

The ONLY thing I did different than recipe, was brown the meat on all sides before putting in crockpot.  This recipe was very good!  My husband really enjoyed it over rice.  It’s so easy, and such a hit, I will definitely be making it again.  And again.  Thank You Jemaco2 !!  :)

My husband and I really enjoyed these!  The only changes I made to the recipe were to use hot banana peppers instead of green peppers because that is all I had on hand (and they worked great, gave a nice little bit of heat) and I used stevia instead of brown sugar.  I served rice on the side and used the sauce over that.  My husband likes things a little spicier so he added some sriracha.  Really yummy.
