Aspenglade, your casserole is SO easy! Thanks for the idea.I grew up in a German Catholic community, and Bierox (we spell Bierochs) are absolutely delicious. A couple variations we have used are adding sauerkraut with the cabbage, adding an envelop of onion soup mix, and/or using monterrey jack cheese. The original recipe doesn't call for cheese at all. It also calls for bread dough. You can buy the frozen dinner rolls (easy!). And they are delicious with Dijon mustard or spicy beer and braut mustard. In the original version you roll the dough into a square, place a large couple spoonfuls of hamburger mixture in the middle and pull up corners and pinch together and bake until brown. For crescent rolls, pinch two together to form a square, roll out and then pinch corners. Yummy!

OMG this was SOOOO GOOD! My husband and I used to make bierochs from scratch but we are usually too busy to do that anymore. I was really skeptical of this recipe but it was amazing! I did end up putting in two cloves of garlic because they were on the small side...and I just couldn't use velveta for health reasons, so I cut the amount of cheese way down and just used shredded cheddar and it turned out fabulous! Thank you so much for sharing this easy, delicious recipe! Top 5 recipe for us now!

I did make one adjustment by adding grated Muenster cheese instead of processed cheese. Other than that one small change this was easy to prepare and very tasty. My family devoured it. Next time I will have to double the recipe!

New Family Favorite!!  The only change I did to the recipe is put 2lbs of hamburger instead of 1lbs.  Only because that is how our beef is packaged.  The ratio of hamburger and cabbage seemed just right to me.  Great, easy recipe!!  Will make again!!!

This was ok.  I added cream of mushroom soup to the hamburger cabbage mixture and put the crescent rolls on the bottom and the top, with cheese sprinkled over the top of the cabbage mixture.

This is very similar to my Dad'd favorite recipe. Our family makes this but adds Taco seasoning into the beef mixture and call it Russian Taco's.

I grew up eating my grandmothers bierox, she made yeast dough and rolled the filling inside the rolls.  This is MUCH simpler for a large family.  Thank you!

I like this.  Maybe a little to much cheese.  Maybe next time I'll half the amount of cheese.

We thought that this was pretty good.  I have no idea what "real" Bierox is supposed to taste like, so I'm not sure how this compares.  My 3yr old and 5 yr old even ate this, cabbage and all, and wanted seconds.  It's very cheesy (a plus for my kids!) and the crescent rolls make it really yummy.  The only negative thing was it was a bit bland.  Next time I might add some peppers or a can of tomatoes.

This was a very well-received family meal.  I used ground turkey rather than beef and it was great.  I would also like to experiment with a lighter cheese next time.

I gave this recipe 3 stars because I didn't think it had much flavor and seemed like it was missing something. I didn't care for it, but my husband and son liked it, so maybe it was just me?

This dish was fabulous! There was a couple of things I did different only because I had a green pepper that I needed to use and I didn't have any Cresent rolls so I used a pie crust. Marvelous darling!!!!!!!!!!!

My family loves this recipe! (and I grew up eating beirox at least once a year) We double the cheese and put crescent rolls on top and bottom.

We felt it needed more bread. I think I will try cooking a layer of crescent rolls on the bottom and the add the meat mixture and top with another container of crescent rolls.

I just thought that the sauce wastoo rich & there was too much of it. Also, it needed something, what though, I'm not sure b/c I tried spicing it up and it didn't help the end-result. I love casseroles w/ground beef &  cabbage and I love bierochs, so I thought this might be a winner. For us, I'll stick w/ the real-deal bierochs in the future, but your family may enjoy it and in any case the kids did like it, so THANKS for the recipe!

This was easy and well received. It's very rich and cheesy...Too cheesy, in fact. I think next time I will reduce the cheese by half. Also might experiment with other types of cheese if I make this again.

Surprisingly good, even though it is made with fake cheese.  I made it exactly as mentioned, well I used more cabbage because I love cabbage...  and I was surprised at how good it was.  Next time, I'll probably try a mixture of cheddar and velvetta.  However, the texture was pretty spot on,  mushrooms wouldn't be a bad addition either.

Love this recipe!  I added oregano and dried mustard to it for a little more flavor and it came out wonderful!!   Also used shredded Brussel sprouts instead of cabbage because it's what I had on hand. My husband loved it!

I wish other reviewers would rate the recipe as it is written and not according to their own changes.  I made this recipe last night.  It was lackluster at best.  I went back and looked through the reviews that gave it 5 stars and almost everyone made changes!  At any rate, it was way too much cheese.  Maybe half the cheese.  I would also add another 1/2 pound of beef if I made it again.  I would also make my own cheese sauce because the Velveeta alone was too fake tasting to be pleasant for me...I realize this recipe called for Velveeta and I'm saying I don't like Velveeta which isn't really fair.  All in all, would not make again as it is written.

My family loved it. I liked it okay, I'm not a fan of Velveeta. I will make it again but will try some of the changes suggested by other reviewers.
