This seemed like a pretty strange dish, but I saw the other rating and decided to give it a shot. I left out the walnuts, but I love this recipe, and have made it several times in the past few weeks, including for other family members. I usually increase the amount of miso to about 1.5 teaspoons, and spinach to a large handful. The seaweed and the extra miso are pretty essential for a bit of seasoning. It's great for the single cook, or for using up an avocado.

I saw this and since I like to try very unusual dishes, this was on my list. I didn't have high hopes as I have tried savory oatmeal before and never have liked it.  Surprise.. this was very good. I too don't like sweet foods for breakfast.. well except my coffee, so this is a nice option. I thought I had seaweed but turns out I was out so I added a pinch of salt to the dish. My stomach is very confused right now, but my tastebuds are happy

Kudos- a great combo. I made it exactly as presented. It was fine. I would tweak it next time in the following ways: First, I'd add the walnut pieces at the end with the avocado. I'd like a bit of an acidic accent to distinguish all the flavors, perhaps mirin or rice vinegar. Last, I had to add soy sauce to spice it a bit. All the tweaks would be to my taste as I said, this was excellent and I'll cook it again. Thanks.

I should have added that BEFORE  serving, add the walnuts and avocado and not during cooking process. Thanks people!!

Very good and healthy. The only thing i changed was adding the miso paste after the oatmeal has somewhat cooled a little. Read quite a few places that stated adding miso to hot water destroys the health properties of miso. If you are going to use might as well use it at its best.

I really liked the change of pace from sweet to savory. I added some frozen grilled corn kernels which I quickly microwaved and miso soup concentrate
