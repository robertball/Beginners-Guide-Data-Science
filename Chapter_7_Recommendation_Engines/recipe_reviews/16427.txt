Absolutely AWESOME!!! The prep couldn't have been easier, and the house smelled wonderful all day.  To save others some time, I read most of the 150+ reviews, and here are the most consistent suggestions that I believe made the recipe: 1) Use a chuck roast instead of rump, as it shreds better (and is cheaper!).  2) Subsitute beef broth for the water  3) Double the salad dressing mix 4) After shredding the beef, put it back in the crockpot to cook an additional half hour to soak in the juices.
I only used a 2 1/2 pound chuck roast, but I used the amount of spices called for a 5 lb. one, and it was just perfect.  I cooked on low for 10 hours, and around the 8 hour mark I took the meat out to shred it and it was so easy, it practically fell apart.  I put it back in and it cooked for another hour and a half along with a couple pepperoncini before we finally got to eat.  I served on toasted hoagie rolls with a bunch of optional toppings....sauteed mushrooms, red onion, sliced pepperoncini and sliced roasted red peppers. Then ran the sandwiches under the broiler to melt the extra sharp provolone cheese.  My husband was in heaven and if we weren't already married I think this sandwich would have gotten me a proposal!  
I had never heard of Italian Beef before, but this recipe makes me want to visit Chicago to try theirs!  Thank you for another permanent in our meal rotation!

Tasty and flavorful, as well as easy to make. There is an error in the list of ingredients: it calls for a 4.7 oz package dry Italian salad dressing mix. That would be way too much seasoning. The correct amount is a 0.7 oz package.

Originally from the Chicago 'Burbs, I've been looking for a good Italian Beef Sandwich recipe for AGES... and this one is the BEST I've found, by far! It tastes almost exactly like the ones I used to get "back home"... plus it's sooooo easy to make in the crockpot!

I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted beef broth for the water and added 2 packages of the italian salad dressing mix.  I also added a few sliced green peppers to the crockpot an hour or so before it was done. When it was done, I removed the peppers, shredded the beef, and then returned the shredded beef back to the liquid in the crockpot. I then served the shredded beef and peppers on toasted hoagie rolls. My husband and I were in HEAVEN!! :)

Oh, and here's a tip -- make sure you DON'T drain the meat before placing it on the rolls -- the liquid has an AWESOME taste, so make sure you get plenty of it on your sandwich for the best flavor. In Chicago they say "the wetter, the better" when it comes to Italian Beef Sandwiches!!

Made these changes: omitted salt, substituted onion powder for onion salt, used 2 dressing mixes, added 1 1/2 tsp. dried onion, and added 2 beef bouillion cubes to the water.  Cooked on low for about 14 hours; shredded meat and refrigerated meat and juice separately overnight.  In the morning, I skimmed the fat off the juice, and returned the juice & meat to the slow cooker, along with some chopped green pepper, on high to reheat for a couple hours. Served with horseradish and provolone cheese. Was a hit at our family reunion! Leftovers (if any!) reheat well for a quick lunch.

I moved from Chicago, and the thing I miss most is the food!  This is a great recipe for the Chicago food blues.  I, too, used the 2 pks of dressing mix (I even use the Italian dressing mix on this site), crushed red pepper, the juice (~1/8 c.) of some sweet and hot peppers, and sliced peppers and onions and serve it on warm Italian bread with mozzarella cheese (with the peppers and onions).  The best thing to do is to have it cook in the slow cooker until it is cooked through, then slice it thinly and return it to the juice for about an hour (just like they do at the beef restaurants).  It was a hit at my daughter's family birthday party, and took hardly any effort.  THANKS SO MUCH FOR THE RECIPE!

This recipe was good as is,but I now use it combined with 3 other recipes for french dip and it is great,I use all of the ingredients in this recipe except use only 2 cups of water and leave out both the salt and onion  salt,I add 2 cups onion sliced thin sauted in 1/4 cup butter ,1/2 cup soy sauce, 1 can coke[do not use diet or an off brand] 1 12 oz. can dark beer, 1 can beef broth, 1 can condesned french onion soup [campbells is best] I use the zesty soup mix. I try to get at least a 5 to 6 pound roast rump is o.k. if its choice otherwise I use a sirlion tip roast, this is much cheaper and less fat than a regular sirlion. I also add italian seasoning, basil, oregano,thyme,and white pepper. I slice the meat very thin like a french dip. update I have started leaving the water out and adding another can of low sodium beef broth.

Made this for a casual supper last night and all who ate it said it was the best beef sanwich ever.  I followed advice of others and used 2 cups beef broth and one cup water; also two packages of Italian dressing mix.  My butcher suggested a chuck roast as it shreds more easily for sandwiches.  Slow cooked it and served with optional provolone cheese, thin-sliced red onion, mustard/mayo sauce and horseradish. Buy really good fresh rolls. Soooo yummy and sooo easy - THANKS!

While the beef was moist and tender, there was way too much salt and pepper to make the broth suitable for dipping.  I ended up diluting it with about 2 cups of water.  Next time I'll eliminate the salt (canned broth is salty enough)and cut the ground pepper in half.  Otherwise, the Italian beef taste was definitely there and very good.  For the person in Phoenix, try Luke's at 16th Street and Indian School for their Italian beef.  It's the closest thing I've found to the real stuff.  A suggestion for another reviewer: If you want the beef sliced rather than shredded, make it the day before.  After a night in the fridge, slice it across the grain and gently warm it in the broth.

This is fantastic! I've had so many people request this recipe. I'm really glad I found this recipe. I grew up in Chicago where you can order this anywhere you can buy pizza or a hot dog, but here in Phoenix no one has ever heard of it. It's my little taste of home. This is even better when you replace the water with chicken broth.

The first time I made this it came out tough but the problem was my slow cooker cooks in increments of 4, 6, 8, & 10 hours and I was in a hurry and cooked at 8 hours so the meat was tough and hard to pull. I have perfected my technique and now I have to say that this is a 5* recipe and actually better than some Chicago places. 
I was born and raised in Chicago (Near North side, NOT the suburbs) and know Italian beef sandwiches. These are better. 
1. I use only beef broth instead of water.
2. I use extra Italian dsg than what it calls for. Double
3. I add lots of sliced green peppers about an hour before the 10 hours are up.
4. I shredd the beef and put it back into the cooker with its juices and peppers and let it soak for a half hour at least. Stirring on occasion.
5. Serve with fresh french bread.
6. I start this a 8am and by 7pm we have a fantastic dinner.

My entire family and friends love these sandwiches and we are all Chicagoans. This is an awesome easy recipe to make for when you have many visitors. *****

I made this recipe using a venison roast and my family thought it was better than any they've ever had from a restuarant.  I took the advice of previous reviews and used 2 packages of dressing mix and 1 can of low sodium beef broth in place of the water.  I cooked the roast on high for 5 hours, shredded the meat with forks, then cooked an additional hour.  I toasted some big kaiser rolls and added provolone cheese to the sandwiches.  Definetely will make again.

Instead of water, I used two cans Campbell's beef broth--I wanted more flavor than water would have given it plus I'm cleaning out my pantry. I also eliminated the salt and I made my own dry italian-style salad dressing mix. Before adding the roast, I layered the bottom of my crockpot with sliced onions and minced garlic and I braised my roast. I used thick rolls that I slathered with garlic butter and threw under the broiler slightly before piling on the meat and provolone cheese and putting it under the broiler again. This was good but we all agreed that we like the italian beef with the peppers a little more. LOTS of spice and flavor which we all thought was quite tasty--the two grownups just missed the peppers.  I appreciate this recipe because when you have a piece of beef that's been sitting in the freezer, it can be quite tough if you don't slow cook it. This not only helped me make quick work out of dinner, it saved my meat so I could use it afterall.

I have nothing much to add to the already great reviews. Did all the common ideas ..omitted salt, used onion powder instead of onion salt, used beef broth (hence the no salt added),  used a 3.5 lb roast and same amount of everything else. It did smell and taste fantastic. Made it for Super Bowl. Perfect pick for that. The only thing I must add... is 17 y.o. daughter walked through the kitchen at 11 am, jerked her right thumb at the kitchen counter (crockpot) and says "Whatever is in that thing smells really good and I just might taste some". And unfortunately, that for me, is the highest praise I'll ever get. Oh and btw, she actually ate it. Really good. Love, Mom

We loved this recipe. I used 2 pkgs of italian dressing, 2 cans low sodium beef broth, and left out the bay leaf. I cooked the meat on low for 10 hours in the crockpot. I then shredded the meat with a fork and placed it back into the crockpot to let meat soak up the juices. My husband and I put garlic butter on the rolls and placed them in the oven at 450 for 10 minutes. Then sauted peppers and onions in olive oil to put on the sandwiches. The order of our sandwiches was: roll, meat, peppers & onions, and cheese. We placed our sandwiches in the oven at 450 until cheese melted. Thanks for this recipe, it was wonderful!

I'm gonna commit a cardinal sin & give a (5-star) review even though I made a few changes...Used a 5lb. chuck roast, 2 tablespoons Italian seasoning (just a shortcut, same herbs), & instead of water I used a can each of condensed french onion soup, consomee & beef broth. Added the 1 packet of dressing mix & a small can of pickled carrots w/ jalapeno. After the beef was oh so tender I shredded it & returned it to the crock pot. Made the sammies by pulling the meat right from the juices & served with sauteed onions, garlic & peppers on french rolls w/ melted provolone cheese. It was the recipe that gave me the idea & the blend of seasoning was delish. I just believe that the beef broths added a depth (if you will) & richness that would be lacking, & I really liked the bit of tang from the pickled carrots/jalapenos. Yum yum great - thoroghly enjoyed by all!

Oh boy have I stumbled on something.  I did substitute more beef broth (2 cups) and added a 2nd seasoning packet of Italian as recommended.  When ready to serve, place meat on an open faced piece of bread (hoagie style), then add a few sliced up peppercini's.  On top of that, I added swiss on some, provolone on others.  Stuck them in a 400 oven for 5-10 minutes to melt the cheese and crisp up the bread.  Wow was that a great way to serve these.  I used the reserve juice and served it au jus style.  Got such good compliments and it dressed it up enough for company at an Oscar party!!

Not very impressive, I used beef broth and two packets of Italian and it was still kind of bland!  It was too expensive to make for the result we got.  so disappointed

After trying this recipe, you may just think twice about ordering Italian Beef sandwiches from a fast food restaurant. I recommend using grass fed beef obtained right from the farmer (if you have access to a Farmer's Market or know a good meat guy). This beef is by far beefier tasting than than factory farmed grocery store beef.
I use extra pepper and garlic in the gravy and add several handfuls of sliced bell peppers (assorted colors) and onions around the roast before pouring the gravy in. Also using low sodium *good* beef stock/broth makes for an even more flavorful gravy than using water. The addition of peppers and onions makes this recipe THE BOMB!!!

Great recipe although I did make a few changes.  I used  2 cups of beef broth in place of the water, double all the herbs and salad dressing and cooked on low (makes it so much more tender) also once shredded I returned the beef for a further hour of cooking.  added 2 seeded Jalapenos for a little extra bite.  Great recipe, its my families favorite and I make this time and again.  You really could not find a quicker, simpler, tastier dish...

This is one of the best meals I've made lately! The beef turned out sooo tender and juicy and the flavor was outstanding.

Based on other reviews the changes I made were to substitue beef broth for the water and I used 2 pkgs of Italian dressing mix instead of one. I cooked it for 8 or 9 hours, shredded it, then put it back in the juices for another 1-1/2 hours.

I served it on hoagie rolls with swiss & provolone cheese and toasted it under the broiler. Then we topped it off with sauteed mushrooms, peppers and onion. This is a definite keeper and received raves from the guys.

A tip- if there's any leftovers (I'll always make extra just to be sure!) Try using this beef to make the "Shredded Beef Enchiladas by Christy" from this site. That makes another *awesome* meal.

Big hit at the firehouse. Use Zesty Italian-style dressing mix. Also, use beef stock instead of water. Add a small bit of red pepper flakes for a little extra depth.

I am originally from Chicago and have been dying for REAL Chicago grub.  Though it's not the thinly sliced beef that I am used to from up north it tastes just the same!  It is a great dish and my wife and I make it now almost monthly!  Only suggestion is to premix all the dry ingredients together the night before.  That way, in the morning before you head off to work, you drop in the roast, sprinkle the dry over it and pour over the water.  Fire up the slow cooker and just wait for the end of the day for a hot sandwich of nostalgia.

My boyfriend and I thought this was awesome.  I cannot comment on if it tastes like italian beef because I have never had it, but it was really great as a sandwich.  I know everyone has their own personal tastes, but I have read several reviews that say this is bland even when they use the beef broth and the extra seasoning packet.  I may have a suggestion on how to make the meat more flavorful.  Each time I have made this, I always cook it overnight for about 8 hours, then shred it when I wake up, put it in the fridge before I leave for work, and then warm it back up when I get home.  I know that kind of takes away from the convenience of having something ready and hot when you get home, but I can almost guarentee this will not be "lacking flavor" if this is done.  Maybe the meat just needs to marinate in its shredded form to get the flavor into the meat.  Just a suggestion.  Very tasty, thank you for sharing.  We like ours with provolone cheese, jalepenos, and banana peppers.  Sometimes I will saute onions and green peppers... lots of toppings you can use for this!

Excellent recipe!  Aside from being extremely easy and flavorful, we were able to use the leftovers for several other meals.  Day 1 we made sandwiches and Day 2 we pan fried some of the left overs and used it on tacos.  My husband ate his tacos on corn tortillas with the beef, onion, and cilantro while I added refried beans and cheese.  Both were excellent.  Day 3 I made a lazy version of beef stroganoff with the meat thrown in.  Great easy recipe.  We'll make this again.

Absolute best Chicago Italian Beef clone that I have tried.  I was born and raised in the Chicago area and now reside on the east coast (waa waa).  I miss Italian Beef Sandwiches!!!  This recipe is the closest.  Get your self some hot gardinera peppers and have at it.  A little bit of Chicago right in your own home.  Or top off your sandwich with mozzarella cheese and you have a chief.  Nice this is da best!

Ok, I'm from Chicago. While this is not true Italian Beef sandwich it's close enough. I doubled all the spices and marinated overnight. Browned on stovetop then Cooked on low for about 7-8 hours took out of juice and shredded then returned to crock for about half an hour. I served on warmed hoagie rolls with hot peppers. Just smelling it cook brought back memories. Try it..

This was fantastic! I did follow alot of reviews and doubled up on the spices and packets of italian dressing. I added 24 oz of beef broth instead of water and only 2 1/2 lbs of beef roast. I added strips of a green pepper to the last 4 hours of cooking but wished I had added more. Will make again!!

Love this!  I did; however, tweak it to what I have read.  Replaced beef broth for water, used chuck roast, doubled the salad dressing mix.  Served on toasted hoagie rolls, and topped with extra sharp provolone cheese.  I throw this together in the morning and when I come in the door after work the smells are amazing (plus so easy).

This recipe is fantastic!!!  I agree with "MomSavedByGrace"'s comments: use 2 packets of Italian dressing instead of 1, use beef broth instead of water, and take the meat out early, shred it, and put it back in the juices.  I also prepared our sandwiches the same as hers and everyone loved it.  My daughter doesn't like any kind of meat, and neither of my kids like sandwiches, and they asked for this every day until it was gone.  Very good!!!

I did everything just as the recipe called for it. The house smelled wonderful! And just before it was ready I sliced up some mushrooms, onions, and peppers and threw them in a skillet until they were cooked through and limp. Meanwhile I stuck our Hoagie rolls in the oven at 300 degrees wrapped in foil to let them soften. Once rolls were done, I placed shredded meat on a cookie sheet topped with pepper mixture and layed provolone slices over it and broiled til cheese melted. Put mayo on hoagies and put meat with goodies on the rolls and it was WONDERFUL! Sister in law just had a baby and took over some for her and hubby too! Loved it!

It was excellent but instead of a crockpot, I used a roasting pan. I heated some olive oil, rubbed the meat with salt and pepper seared the meat in the hot oil and then browned 2 large onions in the same pan then poured the seasoning over the meat and covered in foil. I cooked it for 2 1/2 - 3 hours then shredded and stirred in all of the juices and onions together.  Delicious. My family could not wait; they ate it straight out of the pan

Very nice! This makes enough to serve a crowd or to serve you, over and over. Next time, I'll throw in some beef broth and maybe a touch of red wine. I'll also bag it in quart-sized freezer bags and store them in the freezer so they can be used for a quick lunch or supper.

We own a catering company and have put these sandwiches on our "specials" menu for the second time.....an absolute customer favorite! Everyone loves them. We follow the recipe almost exact, add a little red wine in place of some of the water. serve them with a condiment tray of sliced cheeses, onions, peppers, tomatoes & lettuce, horsy sauce, mayo and dijon mustard.....I have received more raves on this menu item than any other!!

I used low sodium beef broth instead of water, omitted the teaspoon of salt because I could always add it later, used the Zesty Italian dressing mix and didn't bother to boil the spices, just didn't see the need as it was going to cook all day any way.  We really enjoyed this.

Made this recipe for a family party and it turned out great.  Used beef broth in place of water.  I also cooked the beef two days ahead and shredded it, saved some of the broth and then reheated it the day of the party with the broth.  Yummy!!  Thanks for sharing

THis is a hit every time I make it.  I don't have to change a thing.  I get crusty Italian sandwich rolls, split them, lay them open on a baking sheet.  Cover one half with some of the cooked beef, cover the whole thing with slices of mozzarella cheese and pop in 425 oven until cheese is melted and the bread is toasty.   Close the sandwich and enjoy!

This was so good!  I suggest using a chuck roast if you want to shred your meat.  If you have a meat slicer then go with the rump - otherwise don't bother with that cut because it doesn't shread as well and Italian beef needs to be sliced thin! (shredded is next best option IMO)  I used 2 packets of the Italian dressing mix and I used one can of beef broth and then added water to it to make 3 cups total.  Served on french rolls (with lots of the juices) with sliced provelone and giardinera.  Reminded me of growing up in Chicago!

This recipe is delicious! We used chuck roast because it was on sale and added two beef boullion cubes to the water. We seared the roast before we put it in the crock pot.  We served it with sauteed onions & green peppers on fresh hoagie rolls from the famous Mancini's Bakery in Pittsburgh.  Sargento makes a Bistro flavor of Mozzarella & Asiago with roasted garlic cheese that was fabulous.  The beef was great by itself and the combination of everything made for a hot, satisfying meal. A definite keeper!

We loved this one!  I used a 2.5 lb. chuck roast.  I used broth instead of water.  I halved the broth and seasonings, but used a full packet of dry Italian salad dressing mix.  I was tempted to brown this off first and deglaze my skillet with the broth, scraping up the browned bits, but decided against it and it was just fine without the browning.  I cooked mine on low for just about 8 - 8 ½ hours and it was perfectly moist and tender and shredded beautifully.  I put the shredded meat on toasted mini sub buns, added provolone and broiled just until it was nicely melted.  I strained the broth and served it with the sandwiches as an au jus dipping sauce.  Everyone loved it.  I got six good-sized sandwiches out of my 2.5 lb. roast.  Really yummy!  In fact I could go for another one right about now!  UPDATE 2/2/14 - I made this again using a 3 lb. chuck roast.  Made as before using beef broth again (one can) and halved the seasonings, subbing onion powder for the onion salt.  Note to self:  Use the onion salt next time.  This 3 lb. roast was done in 6 1/2 hours set on low in my new crock pot.

AWESOME! 
Very easy to put together and has an outstanding flavor! SO tender & juice! I followed the recipe to a T. I really think that the reviews that stated it was too salty, must be also be the ones who used beef or chicken broth instead of water as called for - broth has a very high sodium content. I thought it was perfect as written!
Thank You!

This was awesome. I made this as a quick meal for Christmas Eve since we were going to be on the run. I bought a 3 pound piece of meat and cut it in half (froze the remaining half for later) since I was only making this for the two of us. It was really good. We used hoagie buns and I bought provelone cheese and broiled it on top of the sandwiches before serving. I also used some of the cooking juices as an au jus. My husband loved it.

GREAT recipe!  I took a couple suggestions from other reviews.  I had a 2 pound roast, but I used the measurements for a 5 pound roast.  I substituted a can of beef broth (1 1/2 cups) and added only 1 1/2 cups of water.  Which totaled the 3 cups of liquid required with the recipe.  I added two packets of Italian style dressing mix.  I did not add the salt.  I cooked the roast in the crockpot on high for 3 hours.  Then I cut the roast into large chunks and cooked for another 1 hour.  I then took the roast out and shredded it.  I put the shredded roast back into the crockpot and cooked for another 30 minutes to get the flavoring throughout the roast.  We had this on Gonnella French Italian Rolls.  It tasted WONDERFUL.  It also has a great smell that filled through the house as it was cooking.  My husband also enjoyed this recipe and thought that it was delicious.  Thank you for this great recipe!

Italian beef came out great!  Made the recipe as directed except didn't have the bay leaf and added diced onion instead of the onion salt.  Would recommend cooking on low for the longer time, as I cooked it on high for 5 hours and shredded a little tough.  Another 2 hours on low in the croc and the shredded meat softened up wonderfully and it was a hit at the party.  The only must have is a jar of  Giardiniera, no Chicago Beef is complete without!!!

This was really good. I used a chuck roast all the same seasoning and 1 1/2 pkgs of the dry salad dressing. So simple and so good. I also used 32ounces of beef broth for a 4 lb roast. Came out great!

We fell onto this beefy goodness like a pair of mountain lions! My boyfriend has already told me three times in the last 30 minutes that he LOVED this and it's a keeper. I'm chewing on my second sandwich as I type this! This is great recipe for so many occasions: busy weeknights, tailgates or parties... and it can stretch if you make it on little slider buns as an appetizer. I only did a few things differently. I used low sodium beef broth instead of water. I used a 4.7 lb. bottom round roast which was the best "economic" choice and looked less fatty. The fat it did have was on the outside of the cut. I removed most of the thicker fat before putting it in the cooker. I did not use the table salt, just the onion salt. And I added a generous tablespoon of dried onion flakes. Everything else was just as listed. I served it on toasted hoagie buns with yellow banana peppers, sauteed mushrooms and provolone. As others mentioned, I generously drizzled the broth onto the bun; there was plenty of liquid so I think you could use it in a small bowl a la "french dip", too. This also freezes well mixed in with the jus so I plan to enjoy this a couple more times in the coming months!

Fantastic! I was looking to make something that would take me and my hubby back to our last trip to Chicago, where we ate at Al's Beef after seeing it on Man Vs Food. This fit the bill and a 2.5 lb roast made three nights worth of the most delicious Italian Beef sandwiches. Especially delicious when eaten on Rotella's hoagies and dipped in the juices (I did use beef broth instead of just water.)

Wow!  I've been searching for recipes that bring that restaurant flavor to my table.  I will search no more.  Hands down, this is the best shredded beef recipe I have tried.  I can't stop eating it!  As previous reviewers suggested, I used chicken broth rather than water.  I omitted the salt because of the broth.  

I served this on toasted buns and the result was fantastic!  I would give it more stars if I could!

Loved this recipe.. so easy to make.  I took the suggestions of using (2 1/2 Ilbs)chuck roast instead of the rump roast, used Beef broth instead of water and omitted the salt and also used 2 pkgs of Italian-style salad dressing mix.  Then put sandwiches under the broiler topped with  pepperoncini and  topped with provolone cheese. Yum. Next time might try toasting hoagies first with garlic butter.

I didn't know whether to give 1 star for disappointment or 5 for taste so I went with the middle and gave it 3, here is why: I followed the recipe exactly, and all day my family kept asking if I was making a roast with carrots and potatoes, I realized they were right, that is exactly what the house smelled like. Well I shredded the roast after approx 10 hours, sauteed some onion and mushroom on the stove, and toasted the sub rolls under the broiler with some 6 cheese Italian cheese. It was good, but we all agreed that it just tasted like the leftovers we have a couple times a month when I make a roast. I always make gravy from the drippings when I do a roast and potatoes in the crock, then I shred the leftover roast and put it all in the fridge for hot roast beef sandwiches the next day. So all the left over shredded beef and broth leftovers from this recipe are in the fridge for hot roast beef sandwiches tomorrow.

I made so many changes maybe I shouldn't rate this recipe?? Although they are the same changes most people seem to have made. I used beef broth instead of water, doubled the dressing, omitted the salt and used onion powder instead of onion salt.   It was very very yummy.

Oh my gosh, this is awesome! I made this recipe in an "emergency" when I needed an entree for a casual gathering. The flavor on this was WONDERFUL and everybody there had at least second helpings. It disappeared! (I took the advice of others here and used beef broth instead of water and doubled the salad dressing mix.)

No wonder this is a 5-star recipe!  Absolutely delicious, make a tough rump roast taste like $10.00 a pound roast beef.  I doubled the italian seasoning mix and used beef broth instead of water, and it was so delicious that my husband wanted sandwiches two nights in a row.  This from a man who doesn't do leftovers!  Makes great hash, too!

My husband grew up in Chicago and his mother would make these sandwiches all the time for him.  When I made this recipe, he never wanted me to go back to his mothers.  This is the best beef sandwiches we've ever had!  I have made this particular recipe many many times.

One of the best sandwiches ever! It's so easy, you can hardly believe the results.  I added sliced onions and mushrooms to the recipe and topped the sandwiches with mozzarella cheese on hard rolls.  These were so tasty, I'm going to make them for our next big family gathering.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This recipe was fantastic!  I cooked a roast this way, I did use beef broth in place of the water, after 12 hours took out the meat and shredded it, (put in fridge for the night) then put another roast in the same juices and cooked for 12 hours again.  Shredded it when done and combined the two, then I took out a bunch of fat from liquid and discarded then poured all the liquid over the shredded meat in crock pot.  Served on hoagie buns with sautéed onions and peppers and melted cheese.  DELISH

I thought this was too salty. BUT, it seemed to balance out once in a sandwich. I was pleasantly surprised. Hubby loved it, so I guess I'll definitely be making this again!

I and my whole family love this one. It has become my traditional meal for Christmas Dinner. It's easy and smells Wonderful. I usually do 6lbs. of roast and double the liquid and spices. Also I slice the roasts into large chunks to start. When almost done I place sliced green peppers on top and let them cook in the juices. When done I take slices out and place in small crockpot. Cheddar cheese sauce is a favorite to top off the sandwich.

I've made this twice and it couldn't be easier. Even people who aren't typically red meat eaters enjoyed it. I used a 5-lb chuck roast, an entire 32-oz carton of beef broth instead of the water, and two packets of dressing mix. I cooked 10 hours on low before shredding, and put the meat back in the broth for another 90 minutes. We melted sharp provolone on one side of long rolls in the oven, and spread some diced hot cherry peppers on the other side. Really good! Thinking of trying this recipe with pork and chicken broth...

You know, I absolutely love the Italian beef sandwiches you get in Chicago. This was just OK. I wasn't crazy about it. The texture of the meat was a bit spongey and tasted a little bland. I don't think you can get the same melt in your mouth texture and deep flavor results in a crockpot that Chicago Italian beef places get in their ovens. It's also hard to duplicate the flavor of the giardiniera and find the right kind of bread. I think this is just one of those things you have to go to Chicago for.

This is a great recipe but can be done cheaper and easier.  Season a good marblized chuck roast with garlic salt. Season with dry Italian dressing,shake several shots of worchestershire over meat and pour 1 can of beer and and equal amount of water over all. Cook in slow oven or slow cooker.  Great for parties or pot lucks.

Instead of salt and onion salt, I used an onion soup packet. I had about a 2.5lb chuck roast, but kept all of the seasoning amounts the same. I asked my bf how many stars...he said 6.  He definitely enjoyed it!

I can't give this recipe enough stars.  It is so easy to put together and then go through your day without any worries.  The end results are beyond delicious.  I use chuck roast because of saving $$$.  I also use twice as much Italian seasoning as called for.  Serve this sandwich with Provolone cheese, grilled onions and banana peppers and it is a feast.  My family loves this sandwich.

This was really really good, but if you're going to use a 5 lb roast, I suggest you double all the other ingredients.  I used beef broth instead of water and omitted the salt.

This is an amazing recipe.  I made it twice in one week, and I live alone!  Following suggestions by others, I used a 32oz container of beef broth, 2 packets of Zesty Italian dressing, and Italian seasoning in  place of individual herbs. I DID NOT add salt. Next time, which may be today, I'm going to rub fresh garlic over chuck roast and let it sit for a day before cooking.  I served it on crusty rolls, which I broiled topped with either dill pickle chips or peproncini and provolone cheese.  This will definitely be my go-to party dish.

I'm always looking for new crockpot ideas, and this one is different.  The only change I made and it was after the meat had been cooked, was I felt it needed a bit more seasoning so I added one more package of Italian dressing mix to the liquid. I also toasted the french rolls and then melted some Jack cheese on the botton slice under the broiler. That also helps to prevent a soggy bun. Pretty tasty!

I made this for Sunday dinner today and my family raved about it! I followed other reviewers suggestions and used beef stock (2 cups) but I also added 1 cup of red wine (Merlot) and it was fabulous. I also left off the salt. Even though my stock was homemade and wasn't salty, we still didn't miss the salt. I only had 1 packet of Italian dressing mix (Good Seasons Garlic & Herb), so I added all the other seasonings - but used less pepper and onion powder instead of onion salt. This is definitely a keeper! Thanks for a great recipe.

This was awesome!!!! Next time I have a football party, I am going to serve these with home made fries and a fixins bar with sauteed onion mushrooms, green peppers, hots... The herb flavors blend so well with the beef and it is very tender. This was a huge hit!

SOOOOO GOOOOOD! My boyfriend talked about how much he loved this for an entire hour! I only had 2.5  lbs of pot roast so that's what I used and it turned out great. I kept all of the same ingredient amounts except added 2 packets of the Italian dressing mix and one can of beef broth plus about a cup and 1/2 of water. I cooked on high for 4 hours, removed roast, shredded, removed fat, then put it back in pot on low for an additional 30 minutes, along with green peppers, red peppers, and some onion. I dipped the middle of each bun into the broth from the pot and broiled for a few minutes to make crispy and tastier. When all was done put it on the buns and served with a pickle. My boyfriend ate 3 and 1/2! And my picky 5 year old eater couldn't get enough either. Sooooo delicious, he will be forcing me to make this again and again:) Thanks so much!!!!

used beef broth and added two packets of dressing and omitted any extra salt.  Also used fresh garlic.   like others have said, it was awesome on toasted rolls with provolone.  Cooked in crock pot about 5 hours on high for 4 lb meat.  just keep checking it towards the end to see how easy it shreds.

This is a spectacular recipe!  I used sirloin tip roast and it was all lean. Also took previous advice and used 2 pkgs. of dressing mix and beef broth in place of water.  Served on toasted French rolls with melted provolone ... you can impress company with this one!

My guests loved this recipe, but all of them asked for onions to go with it.  After trying a variety, I found that for this recipe, people prefer red onions sauteed over medium heat, until they are really really soft.  A medium red onion makes enough for about 5 adult servings.

This Italian Beef is absolutely awesome! I used two 0.7 oz. packages of the dry Italian dressing mix and used canned beef broth in place of the water. The flavor was just right! My boyfriend liked it so well, he may just marry me yet!!!

I have already made this 3 times and we love it.  The first time I made it, I made it like the recipe but used beef broth instead of water.

The second time I used a meat seasoning spice packet (Old West Pepper Steak) that I purchased online instead of the recipe spices and that was really terrific!

The third time I made as per the recipe again, but doubled the salad dressing packets and again used beef broth (but more, because we love it juicy).

I am making it again next week with a different seasoning packet.

This recipe is so flexible, you can make it with your favorite spices.  It also makes the best leftovers!

This is FANTASTIC!!  The minor changes I made was to use a can of French Onion Soup instead of beef broth.  I make slits in my roast and added about 6 cloves of garlic.  I also added tons of red and green pepper and onions in the crock pot. (I love vegetables).  The other thing I tried is when I pulled the beef out to shred I added 2 cups of cornstarch in the juice to make more of a gravy!  My husband went crazy!  He loved it!!!

This would be great for a get-together.  It makes quite a bit and people would love it!!

FANTASTIC!  ...and oh man, the aroma is mouth-watering!  Made this for my father for Father's Day, he proclaimed this one of the best ever sandwiches! I did use most of the suggestions by the reviewer 'MomSavedbyGrace'. The end result was a moist Italian Beef that tasted restaurant gourmet!  Thank you, thank you =)

Yum! Followed the recipe a stated. I ate mine on a crusty roll with horseradish, banana peppers and mozzarella cheese. This would be a great meal to serve to a large group. I had a ton of leftovers.

We used a chuck roast instead of a rump, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  These were a huge hit at our Super Bowl party.

Loved this! I used a Chuck Roast, I think the marbling in it adds more flavor than a rump roast, they tend to be dry with less flavor. I used two seasoning packets of the dressing. After shredding returned it to the crock with pepperocinis and some of the juice from the jar. Waited an hour and it was delicious!!

While this recipe has the right flavors the sauce is not potent enough and the ratio of sauce to beef is not quite right.  I used a 2.5 lb roast with 3 cups of beef broth instead of water and double the amount of spices.  The traditional sandwich is served with the beef on a crusty roll soaking wet with sauce! Also sauté green peppers and serve on top of the sandwich.  My husband and kids loved this with the changes!

Okay everyone needs to make this period.  I also used the review that used beef broth and double the dressing packet. This was so good!  I used a chuck roast and it was like butter.  Perhaps this is the best recipe I have made from this site?  Actually almost all recipies I tried are Wonderful.

I have a love/hate relationship with my crock pot. I love how easy it is, but I hate how it makes every single beef dish I cook taste like stew (bleck - not a fan of stew). This is the first beef dish I have ever cooked in my crock pot that doesn't taste like stew. Woo hoo! I followed the directions as written, and it's delicious. Thank you!!

I really enjoyed this recipe and it held up well in the fridge and worked into other recipes, as it leaves a lot of leftovers! After making it twice I give it four stars because I modified it. I sear the meat in my dutch oven prior to going in the crockpot. I also added two cloves of garlic I put in a garlic press. I omitted onion salt and added actual onion. I also replaced the water with low sodium beef broth. I add no salt because dry soup mix is salty.

Wonderfully easy and smelled so great while cooking. I did eyeball the spices and added a bit more than called for. I kept the fat on and placed the meat with the fat side on top. Cooked 8 hours on low, took meat out, removed the fat layer, shredded and placed back in the pot for one more hour. Lots of juice but used a strainer spoon to dish this out. First night we served over buttery mashed potatoes. The second day we made sandwiches with it and topped with melted cheese and pepperoncini slices. I'll be making this one again. (Oh and I made my own Italian dry herb spice from this website - Italian Seasoning I, instead of the store bought brand)

Very good.  I added green pepper and onion strips to cook for about an hour or so then removed them when I took the roast out to shred.  I'm definitely glad I had that to top the sandwiches; some friends ate cheese on it, but I was very happy without cheese.  The only other change I made was adding some beef bouillon to the water.

If you haven't made this before, remember to get some hearty bread that can stand up to the juicy goodness of this meal!

This beef is so delicious, as well as being a cinch to throw together. I use an Italian Dressing mix recipe from this site, about double the stated amount, and I also add about 2 tsp of minced garlic. Shredded or sliced, with or without cheese, this beef always impresses!

It was ok, but not as great as great as some of the other reviews suggested. Based on some of the other reviews, I was expecting a bigger flavor. I doubled the Italian dressing, as recommended. It was better once you took it out of the slow cooker, shredded it, sautéed it with onions and peppers, and then loaded it up like a cheesesteak. But still good - my husband liked it, and that says a lot. He's very picky!

This was GREAT!!! The only things I did differently was to add beef bullion cubes to the water, everything else I followed exactly. And we don't like the meat on sandwiches so I just thickened the gravy and served with mashed potatoes and carrots.. Everyone loved it.

I did use the recommendation however to add 2 packs of the dressing mix as well as using Chuck.
It shredded so nicely.

The first day I made this, I thought it was just 'ok'. I cooked it on LOW for 9 hours...The next day it was 2x's as good...also, next time I think I will use 2 packets of seasoning, and not just 1.

Awesome!!! Took chuck roast out of freezer put in zip lock bag with one package of Italian seasoning and left it out to thaw with the seasoning on it. Sauteed in left over bacon grease from breakfast a bunch of onions, green peppers, and fresh garlic. I Used the beef broth with the seasonings including another package of Italian seasoning, put the onions, green peppers, and garlic brought it to boil and then let it cool. Right before bed put it all in the crock pot on low. Woke up Sunday morning to the most wonderful aroma filling the house. I took the roast out of the crock pot put it on a plate and let it rest while I got everyone around for church. Right before leaving I attempted to shred the beef, but it just fell apart. I put it back in to the crock pot on low while we went to church. Came home from church to watch some football. I thought my husband was going to drool over the smell. I through some more onions and peppers in a skillet and sauteed them up. Put the beef on some chubatta bread with some onions and peppers and put either pepper jack, provolone, swiss, or mozzarella on it and put it under the broiler to melt the cheese. I loved it all fancy, but my husband ate it right out of the pot. lol

Whole family enjoyed these sandwiches tonight. Good flavor, and easy to make. I also added a couple of bouillon cubes to the water, therefore skipping the extra salt, and used onion powder instead of onion salt. I also used chuck eye roast instead of rump roast. For some reason, the chuck eye roasts available locally seem to shrink and give off tons of water, so next time, I will probably cut the liquid in the recipe down to 2 cups, and still use the 2 bouillon cubes. Just FYI, I used a 2.87# chuck eye roast, and it yielded 6 heaping sandwiches. We broiled provolone on a large French poppy seed roll, added sliced tomato and sauteed red onions and mushrooms to the beef and defatted drippings. It was quite good... I don't know how my husband ate 2. Served with a green salad and sauteed zucchini and yellow squash. Beautiful meal. Thank you for the recipe.. it's a nice change from bbq beef, cooked similarly.

I made this for dinner today, and all we can say is WOW! We're Chicagoans, born and raised, and still live there, and this was nearly as good as any Italian beef we've had. I used a 2 lb rump roast, and the night before, I prepared the Italian dressing/broth mixture to allow the flavors to meld overnight. I used beef broth in place of water, the same amounts for the spices, even though it was a smaller roast. I used plain onion powder in place of onion salt, figuring the broth added some additional sodium. I think if one was using a 5lb roast, they should double the spices for the fullest flavor. 

I put the roast in my crock pot, poured the broth mixture over and set it to low. After 9 hours, I used 2 forks and shredded the beef, and then added the following sliced peppers to the pot: 1 green bell, 1 red bell, 1 sweet cubanelle and 1 Italian sweet red Ancien pepper. I re-covered the pot, then headed for the gym. When I returned, I checked the peppers and they were perfect! I had some whole wheat French bread rolls (cause we're healthy that way) that I warmed in the oven, and then filled them with yummy, tender, flavorful beef. I ladled a bit of the liquid onto the beef and bread to soften it, and then added some of the peppers. To mine, I also added some hot giardinera, because I like it spicy. My husband's reaction after the first bite was "Mmmmmm! Oh, that's  good!"

Wow! This was so delicious. Substituted beef broth for the water and used 2 tablespoons of the Italian Dressing Mix recipe from this site instead of store-bought. Halved the other herbs because I was using a 2.25 pound rump roast. Just outstanding! After 8 hours on low, took the meat out and shredded it and returned it to the cooker for another hour or so. Next time, I'll use a bigger roast!

Very good.  I did not have any dry Italian seasoning mix, so I did not add it to the meat.  I kept everything else the same.  When it came time to serve, I halved a French loaf, spread some butter on it and placed it under the broiler to toast.  I sauted some onions in butter and placed the meat, onions and sliced provolone cheese on the sandwich to creat a sort of philly steak and cheese.  It was good!

I have made this for years, but I use nothing but water and three packages of dry Italian salad dressing mix!  It's much easier and most of the dry ingredients that the original poster added are in the dressing mix.

We all liked this.  I topped it with Oliverio's peppers in tomato sauce, but I think I would have liked grilled onions and peppers and a nice cheddar cheese better.  :-)

I made this recipe as is and enjoyed it, though it was a bit blander than I expected. One of my diners had to add salt because he said it wasn't flavorful enough. If I make the recipe again, I will certainly follow the advice of other reviewers and maybe add some more ingredients for flavor. That said, it tasted 10 times better on the second day, so maybe it just needed more time to marinate. The meat was also pretty tough to shred, but that seems to be the nature of the rump roast.

Excellent! First time making Italian beef.  I made it for a pot luck at work.  Everyone ranted and raved about it. This is definitely a keeper!

I made this for dinner last night and all my picky boys raved about this. I cooked exactly as instructed and it turned out fantastic. I made an au jus sauce out of the drippings, melted some cheese on top and dinner was done! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This was very, very good.  Made for Christmas and was hoping it would turn out ok as rump roast was pretty expensive.  It was worth it.  Shredded easily and was awesome when dipped into the au jus.  Thanks for the recipe, we will use it again and again!

I followed the instructions from the first commenter (adding a second packet of seasoning, using broth instead of water, and using chuck  roast). I slow cooked it on the lowest setting over night. Made it for my department at work and for the family at home. It was a HIT.   Some people ate it plain, others ate it on a sandwich with BBQ sauce and I had it on a sandwich with mayo, mustard, and swiss cheese. It received rave reviews no matter how it was eaten. Thank you!

Incredibly easy to make!  I mixed the spices the night before, and the next morning before work put everything in the crockpot as directed, took just a few seconds!  Came home to a great smelling house, and a tasty sandwich!  I did shred the meat 8 hours in and then cooked it for another 2-3 hours.

My husband is from Chicago and was very skeptical that I could make him a "real" Italian beef sandwich.  When he tasted this, his whole face lit up.  He LOVED it.  I used 2 cans of beef broth instead of water, and a 2.75 pound roast.  Instead of shredding I sliced the meat as thin as I could and then returned it to the liquid.  I thinly sliced half a red and half a green pepper and added it to the meat and cooked until the peppers were done.  It turned out just about perfect for him - the only thing keeping it from being absolutely perfect was that I couldn't slice the meat thin enough by hand.

I'm a born & bred Chicago girl who grew up eating great Italian beef, but stopped eating beef/pork and missed Italian Beef more than anything else.  Since this recipe was rated so high consistently, I decided to try this using a frozen turkey breast instead of beef, and it turned out GREAT! Since then, I have begun using frozen boneless/skinless chicken breasts which is easier and AWESOME (and very low fat, to boot despite being so tasty and satisfying)!  I made a few additions such as onion soup mix and vegetarian 'beef' stock to give it more of an authentic beefy flavor, but am giving this 5 stars because the basic recipe was great on its own. I cook 1.5 hrs on high, then reduced temp to low & cook overnight.  I wake up in the AM to my entire house smelling like wonderful Italian beef.  I found that I knocked that turkey/chicken flavor into submission w/all those spices -- this seriously tastes exactly like the delicious, good ole Italian beef of my past.  I will be making this recipe for the rest of my life!

Wow this is fabulous!  I used the beef broth instead of water, 2 pkgs of Italian seasoning-one zetsty and one regular. 1 tsp of garlic salt instead of onion salt. I used a 2.5 pound chuck roast and served on italian bread with Sweet & Hot peppers. Truely devine.

This was my first attempt using this recipe & as such I am treating it as a baseline for using it in the future.  First impressions; it's a good start, but it requires some adjusting & that is the reason for a 3 star rating.  Having grown up in Chicago I have sampled many of the local purveyors of Italian Beef & have a pretty good idea of what an authentic sandwich should taste like.  Proper Italian beef is thin sliced, something most of us are unable to achieve at home & that has a profound effect on the flavor profile.  By shredding the beef we get more of the beef flavor & less of the spice flavor that makes the traditional sandwich so good.  I used the recommendations of the others & used beef broth.  I'm thinking that next time I may use water instead to lessen the french dip flavor profile.  I would eliminate the bay leaf & next time increase the other spices.  I like using minced garlic & granulated garlic.  I may also eliminate the Good Seasons packet & use Morton's Nature's Seasons mix.       The bottom line is that this recipe is a good basic one, but for my tastes needs to be tweaked to account for the differences in the cooking method & serving style.  My advice is to have fun & experiment.

Update:  Two days after making this recipe I added about a tablespoon of Del Appe hot giardiniera & a couple tablespoons of mild giardiniera, let the beef/gravy marinate overnight, & then sampled the next day.  What a difference.  It was the flavor profile I was looking for.

Unbelievable!  This was sooo good!  I made it for a house warming party and it was gone in no time.  The flavor was delish!  I cooked it overnight and shredded it in the morning.  Left the meat in the juices and set the slow cooker to warm, until ready to eat.  I used a 5 lbs roast with beef broth and two packages of italian salad dressing mix.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the awesome recipe......

This is absolutely delicious! I made this with some suggested modifications, used 2 cups beef broth, 1 cup water and added 2 cloves fresh garlic, and 2 packets italian salad dressing. Now, I did not expect to love this because I did not love the smell of it cooking, I don't know why. Boy, was I surprised because it was wonderful! I buttered fresh sub rolls and grilled them, added  provolone cheese on top of the beef and topped mine (not the kids) with sauteed onions. YUM! I made the french fried potatoes from this site.  You absolutely must try this, it is like something you would order at a restaurant. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

After reading lots of reviews, I went with a 3 pound chuck roast, used no salt, 2 packets of the dressing mix, and beef broth instead of water.  I cooked it overnight on low and took the meat out, shredded it (it was SO tender and juicy), and put it back in the juices for the last 2 hours.  I served it on tosted hoagies with melted provolone on top.  Although it didn't smell that good to us while it was cooking, it tasted AMAZING!!  We ate on it for 3 days!  Thanks so much for this recipe, I can't wait to make it for pool parties this summer!

This was awesome!  I made the suggested changes: 2 pkg. italian dressing, beef broth instead of water, omitted salt.  I slow cooked it for 10 hours and it shreaded up very nicely. I used a rump roast and it was great.  I used a 2 lb. roast and didn't change the amount of spices.  This is definately a keeper!  Oh, I added a little hot sauce for a bit of a kick.

Many reviewers suggested using 2 packets of Italian dressing mix but I'm very glad I tried it first using only 1.  I used a 3 lb. top round roast and substituted beef broth for the water.  I kept all measurements and ingredients the same.  I sliced the roast and placed it back into the cooking liquid for the last 1/2 hour.  I served the sandwiches with some of the au jus on the side for dipping, like a french dip.  With just 1 packet of dressing mix the sauce is pretty highly seasoned but very tasty so if you plan to serve it this way I wouldn't use 2 packets.  We all thought it was great!  I suggest getting that roast in the cooker as early as possible in the a.m. and cooking it as long as possible.

Next time I'll use beef broth instead of water.  I did however use two packets of Italian dressing - which it needed.  I think the water made it alittle bland, but I'll definitely try it again, but use the broth. Thank you.

Very different dish for this southern USA family. I have so many frozen roasts that I needed to use up I searched and found this recipe. We liked it! We omitted the salt and used onion powder instead of onion salt - mistake - we missed the "salt" taste. We used 2 cans of beef broth and 1 can of water. This was great on french hoagie rolls with swiss melted on top under the broiler. I liked it both with and without banana peppers. This will be great for Super Bowl / football days. Hubby and teenage sons said that this is a "man's sandwich". The au jus this makes is delicious! By the way, this makes your house smell wonderful! Thank you for sharing Maureen.

This tasted very good but I used a smaller roast and cut back on the water and spices a bit. Even with cutting back on the water this came out a bit on the soupy side. Will make again but will be even more careful next time about the water.

We could not get over how easy this was to make and how great tasting.  We live near Chicago and are used to Chicago Italian beef taste and this one comes the closest of all home recipies so far.  Really good!

Awesome recipe! I never review recipes on here but this one was so good I have to! I used beef broth instead of water and 2 italian dressing packets with everything else the same, except I only used a 2 lb roast. It was so good my husband raved about it!

Delicious and so easy. I used a rump roast because removing the fat was easier for me. I just broke the meat up instead of actually shredding, then added the meat back into the juice. I served it out of the crock pot, but had the oven on so they could throw it in the oven to toast the bread and melt the cheese. I did use two packets of Italian dressing and beef broth instead of water. It's a crowd pleaser!

This was Awesome. I made this for my family yesterday and they absolutely loveed it. I followed the recipe to the letter and came out perfect. My daughter wouldn't quit raving about them and my wife said good thing football season is coming up because these are on the menu for all the games. I will absolutely be making this again. I give it 5 stars only because there are no 10 star reviews.

I give it a 4 but DH gives it a 2 thus the 3 star rating.  DH likes things with LOTS of flavor and this meat has a mild flavor.  Not bland, just mild.  I made it specifically to make cheese steaks so the mild flavor was perfect for me with caramelized onions, mushrooms, and cooper sharp cheese!  YUM - but if you want lots of flavor you should probably look for another recipe or maybe add some hot peppers and juice.

I thought this was bland.  My chuck roast was just over 2-1/2 pounds, but I used all the measurements of ingredients for five pounds as called for in the recipe.  I took the advice of some others and omitted the salt. Beef broth was used in place of water, and I used two packets of salad dressing mix. It cooked on low for about 8-1/2 hours.  I then took out the meat to shred, and found that it was very bland - tasted like a regular beef roast to me.  I added the salt plus more garlic powder, oregano, and pepperoncini (about 4 mild with juice), then cooked it on low for about another hour. It was much better after that, but there is still something missing.  Next time I make this (and I WILL make it again), I will add hotter pepperoncini right at the beginning, and maybe add a little crushed red pepper.  I'll also double up on all the seasonings.  Maybe there was too much liquid for this size roast? Maybe my seasonings are too old? This recipe has a lot of potential.  Thank you for sharing!

Follow all the recommendations you'll find here to zing this up a little, use beef chuck roast, double the spices, and cook in broth instead of water. My one caution is to be careful about the salt levels when doing all of that, because you might end up over-salting a bit like I did. Next time I will go for reduced sodium beef broth and skip as much salt as possible in the spices (for instance, probably can't do much about the Italian dressing!)

Here's my changes. Used the Italian dressing as listed, but that's about it. Instead used Italian seasoning, about 1 teaspoon or more to taste, garlic powder, fresh ground black pepper, dry minced onion or rings of fresh white onions. Fluids are the following, one can 50% less salt beef broth, 1/2 a jar beef gravy, one or two Tablespoons of red wine, and one cup of water. Lightly salt and peppered meat, then grill on gas grill until browned on all sides, this will add a lot of flavor. Then place in crockpot. Once it has cooked for two hours, taste mixture and add salt if needed, but I didn't. You can't go back if you over salt. Add a little more water if desired. Cook as listed.
UPDATE: Getting too much of a "livery" taste from the beef. This happens when beef is overcooked. Friend suggested using lowest temp. possible and increase cooking time. May also try different cut of beef. I have not tried this again as I want to make sure there is no "livery" taste coming back.

I am not a cook, but I try all the time. I try a lot of recipes off Allrecipes I made this exactly as given. My brother whom does not really like to be my guinea pig, fell for this hard. Then I served it to my husband for dinner and he said, "this is the best Italian beef I ever had". Believe me he has two restaurants he always orders the Italian beef. He wanted this served two nights in a row. He asked only for toasted buns and provolone cheese next time. Whoopee!! Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Just got everything into the slow cooker and I just know it is going to be good, just by the smell alone, it sure can't be bad.  Couldn't find a 5 lb chuck roast, so ended up with a 4 lb.  Could not find my dried parsley so that has been left out.  Smell alone gives this a 3 star, can hardly wait to give it the 5 star in a day or so.  Thank you for this one. MAUREENBURR  Going to have a bunch of happy folks. Had to give it a 4 star because I know I am going to like it.

I cut the recipe in half because it's just me and my guy. It turned out great. It was easy to make. I think I shout gave flipped it half way through to make it easier to shred on both sides.

Very good! My husband loved it! I followed the directions and used tips from other reviewers: Beef broth instead of water, 2 packets of italian dressing mix, and deleted the salt. I did add some pepperocinis and some of the the juice for added flavor. I was worried the meat would be tough because I didn't get it in the crock pot early in the day, so in order for it to be done, I cooked it on high for 5 hours then low for 2 more hours. I did see one review that suggested cutting up the beef so I did that to help speed up the cooking. I was sooooo tender!! It shredded very easily and I had the added bonus of being able to pull off some of the fat while I did the shredding. We put the meat and juice on hoagie buns and added provolone and mozzarella cheese and it was delicious! I will make this again and I will try to get it in earlier the next time.

THis was stupendous! Here are my adjustments after reading all of the comments:


2.5 chuck roast
beef broth instead of water
no salt
onion powder instead of onion salt
1 1/2 Italian dressing packets

I heated everything but the roast and let it cool, then marinated it overnight and placed it in the slow cooker yesterday morning, letting it cook on low for 11 hours. I took it out and shredded the meat and put it back in the slow cooker and threw in some sliced peppropncinis and let it go for another hour. I heated up the rolls in aluminum foil at 300° for about 5 minutes then removed the foil, turned up the temperature to 400°, added horseradish cheese and melted the cheese. I then loaded up the rolls (that I got from a nearby Italian restaurant) and topped with sliced sweet peppers and roasted red pepper.

This was a HUGE hit! I was told this was one of the best things I've ever cooked! There were barely leftovers from the 3 of us! I followed the top-rated suggestions: use chuck roast, beef broth instead of water, 2x the italian dry mix, and shred the mixture and return to the crockpot. I served these on italian rolls toasted with olive oil and garlic powder, and topped the meat with sautéed onions and mushrooms + some shredded mozzarella. Perfection! Definitely making these again!

My girlfriend recommended this recipe as a good "lake day" crock pot meal and it was definitely a hit. I used the modifications in the comments left by MomSavedByGrace (2 packets of the Italian seasoning, beef broth instead of water and bought chuck instead of rump roast).

This is NOT my kind of food and I didn't think I would like it nor my husband but decided to give it a shot.  This roast beef is DELICIOUS and will be used in my household regularly.  If you haven't tried it, do so now, you will love it!!!!

Delicious.  Used broth instead of water, only 1/2 a packet of dressing mix because it's all I had, and randomly threw in a chicken ramen packet to try to make up for the missing dressing.  The flavor was amazing.  Cooked for 3 hours on high, 4 on low, and then turned it back up to high for a couple more hours because my meat was still kind of tough.  Came out very tender.  I didn't have the traditional fixings so I added some onion and mushrooms at the end and served it on homemade Italian bread from this site.  Out of this world.  Thanks for sharing!

I have made this recipe several times and received rave reviews. I have made a few changes for our family since I made it the first time (following the recipe as written.) Watching sodium is a priority in our home, and since Italian dressing mix is high in sodium, I eliminate the salt in the recipe and use onion powder and a garlic clove instead of the salts. I also adjust the ingredients accordingly, to allow for a smaller piece of meat if I am not feeding a crowd. I use whichever lean cut of beef is at the best price. I brown the meat before putting it in the slow cooker as I like the flavor that imparts and since I'm reducing sodium, it gives me another layer of flavor in the recipe. Cheese is a nice addition.

Everytime I make this it gets rave reviews. I juse just under one packet of dry dressing packet per 5lbs of meat.  I've forgotten the bay leaves and even left off the garlic and it was still great.
When making it for a big party I've learned to make it the day before and reheat on the day of.  That reduces problems if the cooking time needs to be longer, which happens because I sometimes double or triple the recipe.  I also usually use a chuck roast or something on sale.  I pair this with brat rolls, provolone and sometimes mushrooms.  Yum.

I only gave it 3 stars because I don't think the original recipe would be as good as the one I used after reading some of the reviews.  I used a 2.5 lb roast with the same amount of seasonings as the recipe calls for.  Instead of water I used 1 can beef broth and 1 beer.  Cooked on low for about 9 hours, shredded, then refrigerated it overnight to let the flavors set.  Heated it up on low for about 2 hours the day we had it and it was awesome.  I make a French dip recipe from this site but my husband said this is by far better.

This is delicious. I actually serve this beef with mashed potatoes just like you would a pot roast. For me, it's just too good to put in a sandwich!

Modified per many of the other reviews - beef broth (2 cups) and water (1 cup) along with (2) packets of Italian Dressing mix. Also used Chuck roast. Next time I will use low sodium broth instead and NO salt. When it was finished, I swear it was as good as Portillo's!! Will definitely make again for pot luck in (2) weeks. Awesome recipe.

Great recipe!  If my picky husband loves it, it's gotta be good.  I downsized to half of the recipe.  I used chuck roast for the meat, and for some heat I added 1 tsp cayenne pepper and 1/2 cup pepperoncini liquid from the jar in my fridge.  It came out very good.  Thanks for sharing!

Easy and super delicious!  Works with any size meat, from 3lbs to 5lbs.  I used two packets of salad dressing mix, as suggested by other reviewers.  Smelled awesome as it cooked! Delish!

I normally distain beef, but I cook it for my meat loving hubby.  I must say though that the flavor and tenderness when this was done totally blew me away!  I have tried so many times to make a good roast, this is the best I have ever had.

Oh my gosh!   Wonderful!!   I followed some of the other reviews and used the 2 packages of dressing mix and I used bouillon instead of water.

My crock pot must cook hot because mine was done in 6 hours on low.  I used a 3.5 pound chuck roast.  
It would have turned to mush if I would have cooked it 8 to 10 hours or more.

Thanks for the recipe and the reviews!

As a college kid this was awesome! just woke up in the morning, prepped, and put it in the slow cooker and let it sit the entire day pretty much.  We had a lot of people over for dinner and it easily fed us all!  Definitely going to make again!

Wow! Prep couldn't have been easier. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and used beef broth instead of water.. used chuck roast instead (3.5 lbs was all I could find) and used the exact amount of spices called for in the recipe- this was company worthy- and in my opinion tasted better than any italian beef I've ever had. Can't wait to make again!

My husband loved, loved, loved this!  He can't wait for football season to make it for the guys!  Really good flavor, meat fell apart, so tender and juicy.  I did use two packets of dressing mix for a 5lb roast and did not use the beef broth.  Was a little salty, but very delish!

I used 32 ounce box of low sodium beef broth, ground black pepper, dried onion powder, garlic powder, dried oregano, dried basil, dried parsley, bay leaf and 2 (.7 ounce) Good Seasons dry Italian dressing mixes with a 2 1/2 pound chuck roast.  Added additional beef broth or water if you want to just cover the roast.  Cooked on low for about 8 hours.  Shredded the meat, removing fat, discarded the bay leaf and put the beef back in the crock pot for an additional 1 to 1 1/2 hours along with sliced green bell peppers.  Put on hogie rolls with provolone under the broiler for a minute or two to melt the cheese.  Unbelievably good!!

Amazing! We ate this on Vienna rolls and it was perfect. I didn't use the bay because my husband doesn't like it and I used beef broth instead of water. I added a couple extra cups of beef broth because we wanted plenty of Au Jus. This is a really good sandwich.

Made this for my guys and omg, the praises rolled in! My hubby couldn't stop ooohing and aaahing as he ate and told me we could have it everyday and he'd be happy. I made a couple changes, first I had no rump roast so I used a flank steak (london broil) that I had in the deep freeze. Secondly I used beef broth in place of water after seeing that in several reviews. The meat just fell apart when I touched it with a fork so I let it sit in the juices another 30mins or so after breaking it apart. Toasted a few hoagie rolls, layered meat, carmelized onions, and shredded swiss and melted it all under the broiler for just a minute or two. Unbelievable! Thanks for this recipe, its definitely going to be a regular here.

I have been making this for years.  It is a very forgiving recipe and can be adjusted to your own tastes.  I use beef stock instead of water and I usually add just a little red pepper flakes and even more oregano.  One of the easiest recipes to use if you are having a party and need to serve lots of people.  I have made it on a much bigger scale in my oven in a very large roasting pan.  It has NEVER failed me.

I just made this, went freezer diving and while snorkling around found a 4 lb. rump roast! This is an easy to make recipe and produces tender flavorful Italian beef. I highly recommend it. Serve on good crusty rolls with some zesty pepper rings.

When we lived in Chicago (born and raised) I always enjoyed a "combo". Grill some italian sausage and place on the roll first and then add the beef, green peppers or giardineria. Mmmmm I can taste it now! I also liked mine wet - a fast dip in the gravy pool. 

At the beef stand near our house the owner there told me that he adds a cup of black coffee (not a flavored coffee, just a cup of strong black roasted type) to his gravy. I add a half cup to the finished gravy.

Make a combo your next time and enjoy.

Delicious.  Used a 3 lb chuck roast, two packets of seasoning, and beef broth instead of water.  Cooked for 8 hours on low, and it wasn't tender, so I cut it in smaller pieces and put it on high for 2 additional hours.  Fell apart.  Served on toasted crusty rolls with melted sharp provolone, long hots and roasted red peppers.  Awesome!

I used chuck roast, cut up and tossed into pressure cooker.  BOLD beef stock instead of water, skipped salt, and used home made "Italian 
Dressing Mix", also without salt. Added a couple Hot Cherry Peppers. Removed meat then reduced liquid till thick then added beef back to toss before serving.   Really good served on my modified version of "Italian Cheese Bread" with horseradish sauce.

This recipe is so dang easy its insane.  Not to mention delicious.  I didn't and wouldn't change a thing about this recipe!  Its perfect the way it is!  When I made the sandwich, I dipped the hoagie bun in the "juices" real fast for that extra flavor and ate it really messy!

NOTE:  A tip to a fall apart roast is to make sure it is completely thawed, then sat at room temperature for 10 minutes before placing in the crock pot!

Thanks so much for the recipe!

Such an easy and tasty recipe.  After 3 hrs on low and 2 1/2 on high I shredded the beef and added sliced onion and bell pepper and left it in the crock pot for one more hour.  I only used a 2.7 lb roast and it still made 8 sandwiches!  I used the same amount of all other ingredients except only a dash of salt, and melted provolone onto the sandwich roll before adding meat.  I'm no chef but this made me look kitchen savvy for sure!  Thanks for the Delish recipe :)

This was an easy to prepare recipe.  I subbed half the water with a can of beer.  I also used fresh garlic, fresh parsley, oregano and basil. I added 2 sliced onions and a few long Italian hot peppers.  I used my own dry Italian dressing mix I had made from  this site.  I served it on my Good-N-Crusty rolls from my recipe box along with sharp Provolone cheese, broccoli rabe.  I froze leftovers on rolls for lunches.  Will make again!

This is delicious, and does taste very much like the Italian beef sandwiches at a place in the suburbs of Chicago where my husband grew up. I didn't used the salad dressing, just bumped up the original spices a bit.  I sliced up some green bell pepper and cooked it in the juices  after removing the meat, only took about 5 min. to cook. We like it with the peppers.  Also, I used beef broth in place of the water....then I took the rolls we were using, split them and set them in the toaster oven and hit "toast", just to firm up the bread so when we dipped them in the juice (ahhhh....) it didn't get soggy.  Awesome.

OMG!  Just finished the sauce (using all broth, no water and 2 dressing packs) and got it into the crock -- the sauce alone is amazing!  Can't wait til it's done!! -- OK! The finished product did not disappoint. I only had a 2.5# chuck rst., but used the full amount of sauce/seasonings.  The Aujus it makes is incredible so you'll want plenty...If I use a larger roast next time, I'll INCREASE the sauce ingred's so I wind up with the same proportions of sauce to meat.  REALLY good and couldn't be any easier.  Thx Maureen!!

Try adding 2 envelopes of Lipton beefy onion soup and 3 cups of beer to the water, along with the salad dressing. Leave all of the other seasonings out and add some pepperoncini (to taste) in the last few hours. Easy and very very flavorable. It is a family and friend favorite. I do brown and season my roast before adding to slow cooker. It seals the juices in.

We went to Chicago last month and tried the local food there. We really liked it so I wanted to make it for our super bowl party. It was a huge hit. Everyone thought this was just like the sandwiches we had there. Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

Delicious and very easy! I used a london broil. Unlike other reviews, I do not think it needed 2 seasoning packets. 1 was plenty. Shredded the meat and topped with cheese and hot peppers. Will make it again.

This is now my "go-to" recipe for Italian Roast Beef! I have tried several recipes over the years but this one is IT. Like others, I used beef broth instead of water and basically doubled the sauce (that is to say, I used half the amount of roast beef as it was just for two of us--but used the same quantities of other ingredients). I served on buns with some sliced pepperoncinis. Yum!

Made my husband very happy!  I followed the recipe exactly, all the way down to the rump roast which shredded beautifully after enough cooking time.  At the end, I did opt for the extra package of Italian seasoning which was great!  I toasted an Italian-style hoagie roll in broiler with sliced mozzarella and topped with meat and banana peppers.  Thanks - will be a great go-to recipe for my family of 5 boys!

Fantastic!  I loved this.  I followed the recommendations in the previous comment, using beef broth instead of water and doubling the italian dressing mix, and using a chuck roast instead of a rump roast.  I also omitted the salt, since the broth was salty enough.  This made fantastic sandwiches, and also made awesome soup... just added steamed carrots and potatoes, and used the broth/meat.  I'll definitely be making this again!!

This was just what I've been looking for!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I used a packet of Zesty Italian dressing mix and 1 packet was plenty for a 5 lb. roast.  Served it on crusty rolls with Provolone cheese and sauteed onions...YUM!! Sis wanted the recipe to take home for her family! :)

I've never had italian beef before or been to Chicago but if it's half as good as this recipe I want to go!  The meat was tender and flavorful.  I followed some other users suggestions and wrapped the rolls in foil and put them in the oven to warm.  When I assembled the sandwich I put banana peppers and hot pepper spread and provolone cheese on it.  Then I wrapped it all back up in the foil and put it back in the oven for five minutes.  The roll was warm and the cheese was gooey.  It was delicious!  A new favorite in my house.

I've tried a good number of slow cooker recipes recently and, quite honestly, have not been too impressed with the way they turned out.  And then I gave this a try yesterday...winner, winner, winner!  Just one thing I will do differently next time.  The top half of the meat was not submerged in the cooking liquid and cooked up a little dry.  In the future, I'll turn the roast over at least once to keep the entire roast moist.  I shredded the meat, and then put it back in the juice to cook for a while, so it wasn't a major problem this time around.  Also served some of the juice on the side which we used for dipping the sandwich.  This is DELICIOUS!

We live in South Carolina but I'm from the midwest and we're huge fan of Al's Italian Beef in Chicago.  As soon as I told my husband about this recipe, he rushed out for a rump roast to try it.  We could only find a 4-1/2 lb. roast, trimmed all the fat, but used the same measurements for all the ingredients.  Wow! How easy this was and the smells from the crockpot were unbelieveable!!!  This was delicious as is, but I added a tablespoon of red wine vinegar to the pot about an hour before serving.  This is outstanding and I served it with sauteed red peppers and onions on a toasted Italian bun.  Can't wait for lunch!

This is awesome and I'm not a fan of beef but wanted something the guys could enjoy that were helping my husband clear a field.  Threw this in the crock pot which was so nice and easy.  Consulted ~ 15-20 reviews and found the one's that said they read 150+ most helpful.  Basically, they just doubled the seasonings and used a chuck roast. They also shredded the meat and put back in for last hr to really absorb the flavor.  At this point, I added 1 large onion and 1/2 red, 1/2 green bell peppers all thinly sliced to go with in on sandwiches.  Toasted on thick sourdough bread slices with muenster cheese slices, added jalapeños and pepper jack cheese on some for those that liked it with a kick.  All the men raved and told my husband how lucky he was....if they only knew how easy it was but that's our secret:)

Nice change from plain old slow cooker roast beef.  I don't usually have Italian dressing mix on hand, but I always have the bottled kind.  Used about a cup of dressing, then added enough water to make up the difference.  Threw in 2 beef boullioun cubes and doubled the amount of spices.  Did not add the salt since I only had garlic salt & no garlic powder.  I used sirloin tip (5lbs.), since that is what was what my husband had put in the fridge to thaw.  We bought some Italian loaves, sliced them to about 3 sandwiches per loaf, spread mustard on the bread topped with the shredded meat, topped with Provolone & broiled until the cheese was bubbly & melted.  Added some sliced onion, tomato, & sweet pickles.  You can pretty much top this with any of your favorite sandwich stuff & you can't go wrong.  This is a recipe we will definitely use again!

Made just as the recipe says, had to find a recipe on here for the salad dressing. It was amazing!! My husband and his co worker loved it. I fry it up with mushrooms, green peppers, onions and top it with swiss or mottza cheese. Have made it several times now and its in our monthly meal rotation. It makes so much that I have enough to freeze some for another meal later on.

Used 5 pounds of roast and doubled the seasonings. Used beef broth instead of water.  Added fresh garlic and onion.  The flavor was DELICIOUS!!!  It literally tasted as good as it smelled!  Even my picky toddler was commenting with every bite.  Will definitely make again!

My whole family loved these sandwiches.  My daughter, who is very very picky, ate one and said it was the best thing she has eaten.  I did make a couple of changes.  I took the roast and shook garlic, onion salt, celery salt, and oregano on it.  I then baked it at 475 for 45 minutes.  Took it out of the oven and let it cool.  I then sliced it very thin with an electric knife.  I followed the directions for the "juice".  I let it cool slightly and then combined the meat and the "juice" in a bowl.  Covered it and put it in the fridge overnight.  Took it out and heated on low for about 4-5 hours until it was hot.  Served on hoagie rolls with extra dipping juice.  Loved it!!

I needed a recipe to serve a large group, and this was it.  I needed to double the recipe, so the first time I fixed it, I followed the recipe exactly.  I found that it was not spicy enough.  The next time I fixed it, I subbed beef broth for the water,  doubled all spices including the Italian Dressing Mix, omitted all salt, and subbed onion powder for onion salt.  I served it au jus, and it was a huge hit!  All the ladies asked for the recipe.  This recipe makes more than 10, more like 17 hoagie sandwiches.

I use beef broth instead of water and serve with roasted red peppers and banana peppers.  The sweet & spicy of the peppers with the juicy flavorful beef is amazing.  Serious party going on in my mouth! A game day favorite!

Would give 5 stars with the changes I made after reading reviews.  Used beef stock instead of water (used enough to almost cover entire roast).  Doubled all seasonings.  Put a 5 lb rump roast in slow cooker all day and it shredded just fine.  Melted provolone on top and sauteed some onions to top sandwiches with .  Delicious!

SO easy and delicious!  Like many others, I used a chuck roast rather than a rump roast.  I also used 1 cup of beef broth and 2 cups of water.  Other than than, everything else was the same.  Not only was it delicious on the first night, it was also delicious on the second night!  Make sure you use a crusty bread/roll or the juices will make your bread/roll soggy.

Nice taste, but I think it tastes better when you sub a bit of beef broth and pepperoncinis. If you don't have a slowcooker uou can cook this on low for 2-3 hours on your stovetop to get the same results.

This is a great and pretty easy hot beef sandwich. I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1.5 packs of the italian dressing seasoning mix, and based on other reviews, I omitted the salt. I used a 5.5 lb tip roast from Costco, that I cut into 3 big chunks to lay in the pot. I was worried it wouldn't shred easily, but after cooking 8 hours on low in the crock pot, it feel apart. I did use the 12 hour setting on low, but it was pretty much done by 8 or 9 hours.  Right before serving, I sauteed some peppers and onions to top the sandwiches with, I also put a dish of hot pepper rings out for those that wanted to add a little kick. I loaded up the buns (use a good quality bakery bun or sub bun, the cheap hamburger buns will fall apart ) with the meat, the peppers, then topped it with some swiss or mozzerella cheese and threw it under the broiler for a minute to melt the cheese. These were very good and got rave reviews from the house full of company I had. The scent of the beef cooking all night in the crock pot is incredible.  Go for it, you wont be disappointed.

LOVED IT!  Per other reviews, I doubled all of the dry ingredients & omitted the salt.  I didn't have any garlic powder on hand, so just chopped up 5 cloves of garlic and threw that in.  Also, I didn't have any beef broth, so I threw in 2 beef bullion cubes to the boiling water mix. Finally, the only other change I made was to add in 2 pepperocini's and some of their juice from the jar into the slow cooker.  Let this cook for 11 hours on low, (shredded it at hour 10 and let sit for the additional hour). The house smelled soooo good. When serving, topped with sauteed green pepper and onion on toasted sub buns with melted mozzarella and provolone cheese.  Out of this world delicious!  Everyone loved it & it couldn't have been any easier to throw together on my way out the door to work in the morning.  Thank you so much for sharing!  :)

Good flavor but a bit on the salty side.  I would recommend using more water as my beef turned out dry.  Next time I will cut the regular and onion salt in half.

A breeze to make.  I used a chuck roast it shreds great. Cooked it for about 18 hours added pepperocini and green peppers and was able to enjoy the smell coming from the crock pot all day long.

I had high expectations for this recipe after reading all the great feedback, but we thought it was bland.  It needs a lot more flavor and spice, in my opinion.

Picky husband loved this! I used 2 pkts Ital dressing and beef broth instead of water. No salt needed. Serve with toasted Kaiser rolls,sauted bell peppers/onions, and on mine I melt mozzarella on top! Serve with a bowl of the jus on the side for dipping. Very good!

I make Italian beef a lot with very similar ingredients. A lot of reviewers state that it is kind of bland. I just use the Good Seasons Italian season, 3 packets sometimes I mix it up and buy two Italian and one garlic herb. I pierce the meat with a fork all over and rub the seasoning over the meat then I place the meat in the crock pot and pour one box of beef broth around the meat, pouring slowly so I don’t wash too much of the seasoning off. Before serving I shred the meat and return it back in the crock pot with the beef broth for another hour. It always turns out flavorful. Great on rolls with peppers onions and Provel cheese (Provel is a Missouri cheese Yummy and melts great google it) or Provolone cheese for those of you who have never heard of Provel.

Very good.  I used chuck roast instead of rump roast to get a more tender result.

This was great! I added some sliced onion and stuffed the chuck pot roast with garlic pieces. Also reading other reviews I doubled the spices and used chicken stock instead of water (I didn't have beef stock)It was very good. Thanks

honestly the only thing ive ever made in a crock pot that had a GREAT taste. the only thing i did different was to use all  3 cups of beef broth instead of water. i omitted the salt as suggested because of the beef broth. any way it smelled great and tasted great even the next day. i couldnt slice the meat so it ended up shredded but everybody loved it. i would make this again and again and i live in chicago, easily comparable to portillos!!!

Absolutely fantastic! My hubby is from Chicago and the two things he misses the most are gyros and italian beef sandwiches. I made this last night for his birthday and it was fantastic! Sooo close to the italian beefs in Chicago! 

I made the recipe exactly as it is except i used a round roast because thats what i had. We raise our own meat and the grass fed beef tends to be a little too lean so the slow cooking plus the spices made the meat soo tender and juicy. Just perfect! 

I took bolillo rolls and cut a pocket into one side of them. Stuffed that with the shredded meat and then served with the juice as a dip. He was so thrilled with them that he ate two with meat and then dipped two more rolls in the juice! Next time i'll have to double the liquid part and i will probably try it with beef broth but those are the only changes that id even consider. This recipe is too close to the authentic chicago italian beefs to mess with it any other way! It will definitely be a regular on our menu from now on!

Great, especialy the second day. The rest allows the jucie to intensify in flavor. My only regret is there wasn't enough sauce for "dipping" the sandwiches. I am increasing the sauce today and also mixing two cups beef broth*** with two cups water. I omitted the teaspoon of salt also.
*** The addition of the broth indeed richened the flavor but ... two cups broth made it too salty. Next I will try 1 cup beef broth with 3 cups water.

We loved it....YUMMY.  I bought a 4lb rump roast.  Followed the recipe to a "T".  Left it on low in the crock for 9.5 hours and it fell apart.  I didnt need to use 2 of the seasoning packets or beef broth.  It was great just the way the recipe said.  Then I sauteed mushrooms, onions, jalapenos, and diced tomatoes with garlic salt.  Then topped it off with mozz cheese, and broiled it a bit. I cant wait to make this again... What a hit in our home.. Thank You

Made as written and it went over very well. I removed the meat from the broth and let it cool so that I could de-fat it. I did this the day before I served and just reheated in the crockpot again with just enough of the broth to keep it very moist. Will make again but add some jarred pepperoncini for a little extra kick.

I served these sandwiches during the 2008 Super Bowl. The sandwich was great until Payton Manning through up a garbage Hail Mary and the Giants won. My sandwich ended up splattered on the wall. I would make it again but only under more favourable conditions. Seriously, this is worth the effort. Favre 4ever.

I have made this many times, and it is always yummy. Every time I make it I try something new. I personally like eye of round roasts best in this dish, because I can slice it rather than shred it.  Italian beef in Chicago and the burbs is sliced, not shredded.  Try using fresh garlic instead of powder, and adding  peppers the last hour.  I do use beef broth instead of water, but I never use 2 packets of the italian seasoning.  I think it would be way too salty.

Super easy recipe that the guys could simply not get enough of and wanted more.  I used two packets of Italian Dressing mix, used minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and beef broth instead of water.  I toasted rolls and served these sandwiches with sauteed onions and peppers and pepperoncinis on top.  Great recipe!

Maureen, thank you for posting this recipe.  It was  excellent!  I didn't have onion salt so I used onion powder instead.  It was not salty at all.  I used two pkgs. of Italian Dressing,  1 can of beef stock and the remaining amount of water.  I also didn't have any bay leaves in hand so I left that out as well, but next time I will add it.  I sauteed sliced mushrooms, red and green peppers and onion in some butter, and also browned rolls in the  oven and I melted  some Monterey Jack cheese over them.  It turned out so good that I'm still craving it even though I'm quite full!  This one is a keeper. :)

Great recipe.  Tastes like Al's Italian in Chicago.  I never buy the Italian dressing mix though, and instead used the recipe on this site, using only 1/4 of the quantities.  I also went lighter on salt.  Added the sauteed green peppers, onions and jalapenos on the sandwiches.  Fab!

I thought this was pretty good.  With all the spices I thought it would almost have too much flavor, surprisingly though it was pretty mild.  I did use beef broth instead of water as well and two packs of dressing.   I don't remember the cut of roast I used, I just told the meat guy I was going to shred it for sandwiches and he told me what to get.  Then I served on rolls with banana peppers and provolone cheese.  I would make this again, especially for a crowd.

This is by far the best recipe I have found for beef sandwiches.  I made it for a family gathering and everytime we all get together it is always requested.  The only thing I do different is add another package of the dry italian mix.  (the original recipe is still excellent)

Yum!!!!!!!  My darling husband LOVED this! He's a picky man sometimes and he RAVED about how good this was!  He even requested it for the Super Bowl!  I followed other reviewers' advice - used beef broth in place of the water and 2 packets of good seasons italian dressing.  YUM!  Easy too!  Thanks!

I had a party for 25 adults and 11 kids and served this beef. Everyone loved it. I did exactly what the lady from Chicago said to do. I used 9 lbs of Chuck Roast instead of a rump roast and doubled the italian dressing and it was AWESOME!!!!! I made a similair recipe a few years back for Super Bowl and used a Rump Roast and it turned out tender, but dry. The Chuck Roast is definately the way to go. It was tender and moist and really is meant to cook in a crock pot all day. I will definately make this again.

I made this on a camping trip for two families.  I started it about 8:30 the night before and let it cook until about 4:00pm.  It was great!  I read the other reviews first and used beef broth and 2 pkg of dressing, I also threw in a few cloves of garlic and some peppers while it was cooking.  Everyone loved it and we feed 10 people for about $19 including rolls, cheese, etc.  Used a slow cooker bag-easy clean up.

I was so happy to try this recipe.  I went to the store and got all my ingredients - and happily replaced the water with beef broth and purchased 2 packages of salad dressing mix---got home and quickly made it.  But, Oh My! - I purchased ranch dressing and had already added it.   Yet, it was still Really Great!  I cannot wait to try it with the correct seasoning! I love that everyone can stylize their sandwich to their own tastes and will serve this for family functions to our small extended family of 12 offering condiments and croissants, a variety of cheeses and many vegetables. I am on a huge mission to add more variety to our menus and am thoroughly searching for recipes so thanks to all who add their recipes!  2/07/06:  my husband is already requesting that i make this again despite my error so let me say that you might want to try it "my" way...?

I followed the suggestion of others and used beef broth (2 cans) plus water to equal recipes liquid requirement. I also used 2 pkg's of Italian Salad Dressing. My husband wasn't thrilled by the recipe but my son raved about it. We ate about 1/2 at dinner and the next day my son ate the entire 1/2 roast by himself. He then asked me if I could make the recipe again later in the week.  I thought the recipe was good. I would probably rate it 4 star except that my son absolutely went crazy over it and I didn't follow the original recipe to a tee.

Yummy!  Next time, I wouldn't put the whole amount of salt in, because the dressing mix has salt already (I don't like a lot of salt in my food).  Served with wheat sub rolls which I first toasted under the broiler.  Added provolone cheese and melted it in the oven and served with the strained juices from the crockpot for an "au jus" type thing.  It was delicious!

I used an Eye of the Round roast which came out soooo tender. I also used 2pkgs of the good seasons and the only thing I will change for the next time I make it is to cut the pepper down because with the good seasons and the tsp of pepper it was just a bit overpowering. We had it on rolls with cheese and horseradish/mayo and it was delicous!! This recipe is defintely a keeper in our house.

Being from Chicago and now living in Arizona, you can't get a true Chicago style Italian Beef, until now ! This was so good ! I added 2 packages of Good Seasons zesty Italian dressing mix and used beef broth instead of water. Cooked for 2 hours on high and 2 hours on low, sliced it on my meat slicer, returned the meat to the juices to warm the meat again and there it was, a true Chicago style Italian Beef sandwich here in Arizona!!!! Then added some Hot Giardinera to the sandwiches nad we were in heaven ! Thank you !

As others suggested I used two packages of Italian dressing mix and low sodium beef broth instead of water.  I shredded the meat and put it back in the broth for a couple of hours.  This was a big hit, served on crusty rolls, with banana peppers, provolone cheese, and horseradish on the side for individual tastes.

WOW! This is a recipe I will use MANY times! To anyone who thought the broth lacked flavor try 2 cups beef broth, 1/2 cup water , and 1/2 cup dry red wine-yummy:) This recipe is also great as a beef stew! Seriously, my husband LOVES it. From a wonderful man but a picky eater, that's quite the compliment!:):) Some other suggestions: try Grandma VanDoren's white bread (found on this website) recipe to use as rolls for the sandwich:) Fabulous! Also add red onions, green peppers, and/or mushrooms with your favorite cheese as toppings. ENJOY:):)

Easy and excellent. May I suggest: sauted green pepper and onion. Top that with banana peppers and a slice of swiss cheese, bake until cheese melts and dip into juice before serving. This was liked my youth and adult.

This was a real flopp.  My husband, son and daughter and I were very unhappy with this recipe.  I thought it would be like the 'French Dip' roast beef sandwiches that I got from this website about a year ago... that recipe is fantastic.  When you compare it to this, there is no contest. Trust me, try the French Dip!

This was absolutely amazing. I followed the recipe exactly, and let it cook all day. I did shred the meat, then let it cook for another hour to make sure the juices really got into the meat. I served these on rolls made out of the French Baguette recipe here. Sauteed some onions and green peppers with a splash of balsamic vinegar, and added a slice of colby jack cheese. Very filling, absolutely delicious. Husband had some the next day, he said they tasted even better. I have another roast in the freezer just waiting to be prepared this way!

Made this for the Super Bowl - it was awesome!  I mixed all the spices and rubbed them onto the roast, letting it sit in the fridge overnight.  The next morning I browned it in a skilled and put it in the crockpot with beef broth (I used 2 cups since I only had a 3 1/2lb. roast.)  Once cooked, I shredded the meaat and put it back in the juices and used some of the juice to saute sliced onions and peppers for the sandwiches.
Will definitely use this one again - thanks so much Maureen!

I made this yesterday for SuperBowl.  I used a 7 lb. roast, doubled all the seasonings, and used beef broth instead of water.  I served it with roasted peppers, sauteed onions, provolone cheese, and horseradish sauce.  I thought they were pretty good sandwiches, but everyone just RAVED about the meal! I was nervous making this for the first time for a crowd, but it turned out just great.

I tried this recipe and it was very good.  My whole family enjoyed it. However, I made the following adjustments to the recipe.

1. Used Good Seasons Zesty Italian Dressing mix

2. In place of the three cups of water, I used one 10 oz can of Campbell's beef broth double strength plus one 12 oz beer and added water to make three cups of liquid.

3. Omitted the salt.  The soup and the dressing mix   adds plenty of salt.

4.  Used 1/2 teaspoon of pepper instead of the full teaspoon the recipe calls for. I thought a full teaspoon would make it too peppery.

This is a terrific recipe. We make it often on Sundays during football season. Throw it in the crockpot, cheer (or jeer) your favorite team, and then have an awesome sandwich. What could be better or easier?

Oh my goodness this was GREAT!!!  I grew up in the northwest suburbs of Chicago and moved to Virginia a few years ago and I've been missing the whole Italian Beef scene.  My whole family really enjoyed this and it was so, so, so easy!  I've decided that the next time I make it I'll also throw in a couple of Italian sausages because you can't find a good sausage on the east coast.  A most definite keeper!!!!!!!!!!!

I have been using this recipe for about a year now -IT IS FABULOUS!  For extra color and flavor I use colored bell peppers and onions.  Just cut them up into strips and nuke them in the microwave in a covered dish.  Add during the last hour of cooking.  If you add too soon they turn too mushy.  Provolone cheese and creamy italian dressing also make great toppers.

So tender and delicious! After making this a couple of times I have changed up the method a little.  I normally put this in the crock pot in the morning before I go to work so it can cook all day. I rub the roast down with the Italian seasoning packet mix and wrap it in plastic wrap and let it sit in the fridge overnight, I use beef broth instead of water I think it has a richer flavor this way.   In the morning it's beef broth in the crock with spices and bay leaf and toss in the roast and done. When I come home I can smell it outside the door! Great on Kaiser rolls with provolone!  Definitely a keeper.

Amazing!! I took the suggestions and used chuck roast instead and I'm glad I did! What I didn't know is how many this would feed, by using 5 lbs of chuck I hope it would feed 12+ people and it did but using small hoagies. Thanks for this awesome recipe! Oh! I also did not have bay leaves so left it out and didn't notice!! :)

My husband couldn't get enough, and he always raves about how NO ONE can replicate a true Chicago Italian beef. This recipe proved him wrong. Absolutely perfect. I recommend using a smaller roast and subbing the beef bouillon for the water as advised in other reviews.

This was the best. I added a pinch of red pepper flakes. When finished I drained and cooled the liquid then peeled off the fat cap. Then added back to the shredded beef. Poker pals went crazy over it. Being a guy, I like simplicity.

LOVE this recipe! It was a hit with the whole family! I only tweaked it a little. I substituted the water for beef broth, doubled the Italian dressing packet and added half a jar of banana peppers with juice. It's amazing!

Used a 2.5 lb roast as suggested with the same amount of spices/other ingredients. 4 stars as is. Added a couple of sliced jalapenos from the garden after the meat was shredded and it made a HUGE difference. SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!

I was looking for something different to make for my picky family. My husband, who's from Chicago, loves Italian Beef so I thought I'd surprise him with (I was hoping) a little familiarity and deliciousness from back home.. He ended up eating two bigger sandwiches (topped with banana peppers and cheese sauce) and even used leftovers for more sandwiches the next day! I only used a 2.5 pound roast and the same measurements with seasonings and it turned out great! Thanks for the recipe and a little taste of Chicago!

Born and raised in Chicago, still here and this is nothing like our Italian beefs. It tastes pretty good but I couldn't try and pass this as an Italian beef sandwich around here if I wanted too. We ended up just eating it more like a roast, still pretty tasty.

So good!  I used the leftovers for lunch for several days afterwards.  Toasting the hoagie rolls before adding the meat helped them not to get too soggy, and adding mushrooms and mozzarella then broiling the open-faced sandwiches was so, so good!

I noticed the seasonings in this were just about the same as Italian dressing mix from this site. So I took that recipe and halved it. Heated 3 cups water in microwave until boiling, put the Italian mix in and stirred. Then poured on top of 2.5 pound chuck roast, added 2 beef bouillon cubes and cooked on low for 10 hours. YUM. Made homemade Italian rolls and topped meat with slice of provolone and broiled on hi for about 3 minutes. It was fantastic!

This was FABULOUS!! I am from chicago area and I know my dad loves this so, I made this last week when he came to visit. I do agree with adding the 2 Italian seasonings and skipping the extra salt. We toasted big Italian loaves with garlic butter and added cheese and peppercinis OMG...so delicious. Oh, and used the chuck roast. Great for football Sundays..ENJOY

Made this for our company Halloween party...first thing we ran out of. Used VENISON Instead of beef---had 2 people tell me they don't like venison but loved this (guess you do now). 1.5 packets of Italian dressing, everything else the same. So awesome.

made this today, change it up a little bit.  Used Onion powder instead of onion salt, added two beef bouillon cubes in the sauce pan as well.  Also used two packs of Dry Italian mix for more flavor.  We made combos using grilled sausage as a base in the hoagie roll,  then provolone cheese, then  put the beef on top. Used Mezzetta® Chicago Style Italian Sandwich Mix Mild Giardiniera for the sandwich topping.  Was awesome

This is a pantry recipe that's quick to prepare and has great flavor. I had to halve the ingredients as my roast was only two and a half pound. I used the low setting for ten and a half hours.  It was really tender and shredded easily.  Next time I plan to add a sliced onion or two.

All you need to do is pour an entire bottle of pepperoncinis in the crock pot. Adds nice heat and flavor.

Made it last week end for 6 people as a "dry run" for an upcoming 30 person outside event, rather than the usual burgers. It was absolutely 6 votes for , non opposed !!
 A little twist that I added. I took the stock, boiled and reduced it to approx 2/3rds and thickened it with a little corn starch. The sauce certainly added to the intensity of the flavour!

Loved this recipe! I added beef broth and red wine for the liquid. Next time for a spicier crowd I will add pepperocini's and some of the juice from the jar!

I don't comment normally unless I find a recipe that was to DIE for and this was just that! Oh my this smelled incredible when it was cooking.  I followed everything pretty much exactly except I could only get a 3.5lb rump roast but I didn't scale the recipe down at all. I tend to always make extra juice.  I also used a zesty Italian packet.  Also I substituted onion flakes and salt for the onion salt. First time cooking for my boyfriends parents and everyone was blown away! My bf's mom was concerned that I wasn't running around in the kitchen but this was just so easy! I sauteed some mushrooms and onions and served it up on some toasted hoagie rolls with cheddar cheese and horseradish. Oh my I cannot wait to make this again!  I suggest shredding up the meat 1-2 hours before it's done and let it soak in all that yummy juice! 10 hours is perfect.

I made this twice, the first time exactly as the recipe calls for.
The 2nd time I used 1 can of beef broth and 1 cup water in place of 3 cups water. I used 4 bay leafs instead of 1, 3lb chuck roast and kept every thing else as the recipe calls for. I boiled all the spices and broth and water then poured it over my roast topped it with 4 chopped garlic cloves put the lid on it and 7 hours later I took the meat out which just fell apart, took what little fat there was out and shredded the meat then put it back in the crocky added sliced red onion green bell pepper and fresh sliced mushrooms and cooked another hour. It was soooo good, I can't say enough about it. one of my favorites for sure.

I usually don't submit reviews, but this was REALLY good!  I used a 3 lb. bottom round. Following other reviews, used a 14 oz. can of beef broth, 1 c. of water, and 1 1/2 packets of the italian dressing mix.  Left all other spices as written.  Threw everything in the slow cooker at once, and cooked on high for 1 hour, low for 7, then shredded shredded the meat (which pretty much fell apart on its own) and let it sit in the juices for an extra 30 minutes before serving on garlic bread with melted mozzarella and giardiniera. I've never had a true Chicago beef sandwich, but tasting this made me want to book a trip to the windy city.

Holy moly was this delicious!! I took others' advice and switched the water to beef broth and doubled the Italian seasoning. I used a chuck roast (cheaper and still delicious) and cooked the beef on low for 12 hours. About an hour before it was done I shredded the meat and let the meat continue cooking in the delicious juices. It was ridiculously good and I'll be making this again for sure!

Holy cow, this smells fabulous.  Be sure to cook on a Sunday so you can savor the smell all day long.  Perfect Fall meal.  I slightly modified as suggested by others...used 2 cans beef broth instead of the water and doubled the italian seasoning (go with 2 packets). I served over garlic bread smother with provel, toasted in the over. Divine. Accompanied with a large green salad.  Yum again.  Had enough gravy to spoon a bit over our dog's dried food as a special treat.  He deserved it...had to smell it all day long!

I've made this recipe several times now, with a few minor twists at times, the whole family LOVES IT! That's saying a lot when my wife won't eat meat half the time, daughter gripes about my cooking usually, even mom-in-law and sis-in-law (super picky eaters) LOVE IT. Plus the dog howls for it! They want me to make it every week. Oh and I LOVE IT too!

This was delicious and very, very easy.  I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and used a chuck roast instead of rump, substituted beef broth for the water, doubled the salad dressing mix, and after shredding the beef, put it back in the crockpot to cook a while longer to soak in the juices.  I also added some mild pepper juice and rings.  This will definitely be made often.

This is pretty good.  I listened to other reviewers and used only 1/2 cup water and the rest beef broth.  Next time, I will not use so much broth, as I found the flavor of the broth to come through a little too much.  I used 2 packets of italian seasoning for a 3lb roast.  The amount of seasoning was good.  I sauteed onions and peppers in a little oil with garlic powder and served on hoagie buns with herb butter and provolone.  I think the sauteed veggies made all the difference.  Will make again... with much less broth!

Question for expert slow cookers.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Had a 3.5 lb roast.  I couldn't shred the beef.  I sliced it very thin and my family loved it (great flavor!) but I'm curious to know if I overcooked it or why it wouldn't pull apart.  Any tips?? Thx!

Great recipe. I made it almost exactly as recipe. I used montreal steak spice instead of the italian dressing mix and also added a few dashes of allspice & cinnamon to the water. I did what others suggested: shred the beef and put back in liquid about an hour before time was up & also used spices for a 5lb roast but only used a 2.5 lb roast in my recipe. I put the beef on open hoagie rolls, topped with mozzarella & a sprinkle of oregano. Toasted it in the oven while open to melt the cheese. Tasted amazing. Thanks for a great recipe.

This tasted awesome! However, I didn't use this for sandwiches. We just ate it plain with mash potatoes, stuffing and gravy! Mmmm!

Followed others' advice and used 2 packets of seasoning and beef broth. Used 4.5lb rump roast, shredded and returned to cooker for about 30-45 mins. Topped with provolone, onions, banana peppers, on a homemade toasted hoagie roll. Delicious! I know the leftovers will be amazing.

This was flavorful.  I think I may have cooked mine a little too long before shredding it.  It was still a solid piece when I arrived home from work and seemed a little dry.  I would add a little more water or beef broth next time.

Absolutely delicious!  I only had a 2 1/2 pound roast, but I still made the same amount of "liquid".  Very moist and tender and tasted great on hoagie rolls with provolone cheese.

Wow. I don't care for shredded beef, roast, stew...much of anything like that, but I needed an easy entree for a potluck lunch at work and decided to try this. I tasted some, didn't like it at all, but I'm definitely in the minority! I got lots of compliments, requests for the recipe *AND* my crock pot was empty at the end of the day. Per several reviews, I used a chuck roast, two packages of the Italian dressing mix and beef stock instead of water. Cooked up tender and juicy in about 4 hours on high in my crock pot. I served it with pepperocinis, cheese and sub rolls. Won't make it for myself, but I'll definitely share the recipe and try it again for a potluck.

Doubled all ingredients except for the salt which I left out entirely and the water which I substituted with 3 cups beef broth instead  I used a chuck roast.   Really liked the flavor- although it was better the second day.  Also, it seems as if maybe some of the flavor got cooked away as it smelled so good in the 1st part of the day but seemed to die down a bit after about 4 hours of cooking.  Next time I will add a 3rd round of spices half way through the total cooking time.  I probably would have rated this one a 5 but the family didn't really rave about it so 4 stars it is.  Good enough to make again for sure but will definitely dbl the spices, use beef broth, and add a 3rd round of spices half way through.  Edited 10/7/12- From 4 stars to 5.  Made a 2nd time with the above suggestions.  Dbled the seasonings cooked for 7 hours.  Put crock in fridge overnight.  Scraped the fat off the top in the morning, warmed it up a bit, added a 3rd round of seasoning and cooked an additional 4 hours.  Wow.  Outstanding.  Definitely does not need any salt if using beef broth.  Hubs liked his with horseradish, I mixed pepperocinis in with mine.  Can't believe how good this was this 2nd try!

This beef is awesome!  I did make a couple changes.  I used 2 bottles of beer in place of the water and I added some pepperoncini peppers to the crockpot.  Will definitely be making this recipe again.

This recipe is great as is.  Have used different cuts of beef depending on what looks best and it is all good.  Chuck roast is especially easy and moist with this recipe.  It just falls apart so no need for slicing.  Just make sure you trim the fat before cooking.

This has become a family favorite & is my go to recipe.  Whenever we host anything for extended family, this is what I make. No matter how much I make, there never seem to be left overs, which is really too bad because this is just as good reheated. If I don't make it, people are always disappointed. I have lost track of how many times I haven't gotten asked for "your shredded beef" recipe. I follow the recipe exactly, although I may go a bit heavy on some of the spices, using more of a rounded or heaping teaspoon.

I make something similar to this but using Chuck Roast. I use the Italian dressing but also add brown gravy and Ranch Dressing (all powder mixes right from the envelopes) I use 2 envelopes of each because we do two roasts at a time. I will be using Rump Roast this time (for Christmas) because the store was out of  Chuck Roast which is why I came on here to find a recipe. This way of making roasts in the crock pot is so good and so easy and one of our families favorites. I brown the meat first on the grill and add cloves of garlic and an onion and the powdered mixes and that's it. I cook on high temp. for about  7 hours till it's nice and tender! You won't be disappointed!!!

I've made this several times and also shared with friends and family that had a large group to feed. It really is tasty. I doubled the packet of Italian dressing, just to be sure it had a lot of flavor. Turned out pefect and the left-overs were really good for a couple of days.

This was a big hit at our house this evening! I used the suggestions of others and omitted the salt, used 2 packs of dressing mix and 2 cups water, 1 cup beef broth. Once done, we pulled it apart and added it back into the crackpot with the juices for about a half hour. I served it with fresh hoagie rolls, mild and hot pepperchinis and sautéed mushrooms, onions and bell peppers. Will definitely make this again!

This is a great base recipe, but 2 major modifications - #1 omit the salt or it is too salty. And #2 is big -you absolutely MUST add a can of beef broth or it is just plain not good. With those 2 modifications this is incredible!!

Taste is somewhat plain. Maybe a little more seasoning would help. Also sauteed some onions & green peppers to put on top of the sandwiches, and that helped a lot.

This is a great slow cooker Italian beef! While it doesn't really taste like the Chicago versions, those aren't made in a slow cooker either....I followed the advice of others & added 2 packs of dressing & beef broth. I served on hogies, stuck them in the broiler to melt a slice of cheese on top.

We love this recipe!  I made it as directed for the first time but added 2 packets of seasoning and my husband said that it was the best thing I have ever cooked!  Since then, I have made this several times but add some juice from a jar of peppers like someone suggested.  I just made it for my son's birthday party and all 10.5 pounds of meat was devoured and I could have used more!  I think next time I will add the green peppers as suggested and give that a try!

Delicious!  Utilized reader recommendations and used beef broth instead of water as well as doubled the seasonings.  Also broiled the sandwiches with provolone for a heavenly deli  sandwich.  Save the liquid and use for dipping.  Simply divine!!!!!

Very good recipe for sandwiches. I shredded the beef at 5 hours on high and then cooked on low for about 1.5 hours. Letting the shredded beef soak in the juice is very good.

This was amazing! I did follow the advice of one reviewer. I used beef broth instead of water. I doubled the salad dressing mix and I used a chuck roast. I didn't need to shred the meat as it fell apart on it's own. My hubby raved over it! It was so good!

I made this for my family's 4th of July celebration and everyone loved it!  All my relatives on my dad's side of the family live on the north side of Chicago (go Cubbies) and I was born and raised in a nearby suburb.  I live in the northeast now and haven't had a good italian beef sandwich since we left Chicago... until now.  This recipe is the real deal... even my dad was impressed!  I took the advice of others and substituted beef stock for the water and used 2 packets of italian seasoning instead of 1.  I also didn't have any dried basil so I subtituted fresh. The meat came out very tender and the auju was very flavorful with the perfect amount of saltiness.  I will definately make this again.

Made this last night and it was sensational. I used the beef broth instead and used 2 packs of the salad dressing mix. I also shredded my chuck roast and put it back in the last 2 hours. I had to use a cab chuck roast, thats all my store had at the moment and it tasted and smelled fabulous! The sauce is outstanding and everyone put that on their rolls also. Thank you very much for a reicpe that I will be using again and again.  Love the simplicity of the prep work also.

This was awesome. I used a 4 lb. chuck roast and kept the seasonings the same. Next time I might increase the seasonings more. I recommend the low and slow method for really tender meat. This was great to serve for a summer dinner party because it meant I could talk to my guests instead of slaving over the stove or grill. I served it on hoagie buns with slices of provolone cheese, with pasta salad, chips and watermelon. Fantastic!

This recipe deserves WAY more than 5 stars! I have made this almost weekly since finding the recipe and everyone loves it! Followed reciped with these changes...used about a 2 1/2lb piece of chuck roast, let cook overnight in morning shredded beef then put broth in fridge. When returning home from work took out broth skimmed any fat returned it to crock adding the beef and heated about 2 hrs on low......DELICIOUS! My sister begged for the recipe ... she added noodles and veggies to her leftover broth and remaining meat after making sandwiches one day and had a very good soup! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Absolutely delicious! I served it on crusty buns with sauteed onions, mushrooms, green peppers and swiss cheese and put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes to melt the cheese. I did follow other reviewers suggestions and made it with chuck roast, 2 packets of Italian dressing mix, and beef bullion in place of the water. I'm pleased to have lots of leftovers and I know I'll be making this again!

Not quite enough spice. I doubled the spice, added about 1/4 cup of jalapeno juice, and a shot of hot sauce. It was an overwhelming hit.

This was delicious! I was born and raised in Chicago, so I can't say this was exactly like Chicago Italian Beef but it was very close.

I did make some changes: Upped the water to 5 cups, added 6 beef bouillon cubes, used Italian seasoning and used 2 packages of dressing mix. Halfway through the cooking time I took out the roast and sliced it as thinly as I could and returned it to the slow cooker to finish cooking. The extra au jus allowed us to be able to dip the sandwiches and serve au jus on the side. Fantastic!

It was good but tasted more like pot roast. I live in a suburb of Chicago and this is not like a Chicago Italian beef sandwich. It shouldn't be shredded but sliced. Only thing I did different was brown the meat in oil on all sides before adding it to the crock pot.

Made a similar recipe that used Beef stock and asmall amount of Balsamic vinegar.  The roast was thin sliced after cooked then placed back into the juices!  It makes an excellent french dip sandwich!  The recipe is a big hit with my family!

If you want true southside Chicago recipe, the meat must be sliced wafer-thin and, most importantly, BOTH sides of the roll MUST be dipped in the liquid BEFORE you put the meat in the roll.  I am going to try this recipe very soon.  P.S. You have to have the correct "stance" to eat the sandwich, too.

Fantastic! This was really really good. And so easy to put together. The smell of it just about drove us crazy all day long. I did use beef broth instead of water so I cut out the onion salt and just used onion powder. And for the dressing mix I used the full recipe of Italian Dressing Mix (AR). Thanks for the recipe!

I have been making this recipe for several years. It is sooooo foolproof.  However, I'm not a crock pot cook, so I make it according to the instructions, cover it in a dutch oven or roaster pan, and bake low and slow in the oven @ 300 deg F for 3-4 hours.  Nothing like it.  I have passed this recipe on to countless people.  They all love making it and eating it.

This was very good, and the leftovers tasted even better.  I used less water (had a smaller roast), but left all the seasoning amounts the same.  I also added a little Italian dressing and a beef boullion cube.

Great flavor. Will make again. I used 2 packets of Italian salad dressing and cut down on the the salt as others has suggested. I also used beef broth instead of water. I took it out 1/2 way thru and sliced it thin then returned it to the juice to cook.

This was really good, but made a TON! I followed the suggestion of using two dressing packets. I also used onion powder instead of onion salt. If I were to make it again, I would halve the recipe and use just one packet. Even that would leave lots of leftovers.

I cooked the beef for a about 10 hours on low in the slow cooker, doubled the Italian dressing mix and used chicken broth instead of water. During the last hour I added very thinly sliced sweet bell peppers. Served on medianoche (egg) bread. It was amazing!

This is delicious and simple to make. The only change I made was to use beef broth instead of water.These sandwiches are definitely better a little soggy on the bottom.  I put a little dipping juice out with each platter..

This was excellent. I used beef broth instead of water, cut the salt to 1/2 a teaspoon (next time I'll omit completely), used 1/2 tsp onion powder instead of onion salt, and two packages of dry italian salad dressing mix. My roast was only about 3 pounds, but I'm glad I made the full recipe. It had a very robust flavor. I shredded the beef and returned it back to the cooker for an hour to soak up the juice. Served on sun-dried tomato hoagie buns with cheddar (I wish I had provolone or swiss!) Turned out delish!

Oh my gosh!  This is delicious and simple to make.  I followed MomSavedbyGrace's changes and the recipe came out perfectly.  These sandwiches are definitely better a little soggy on the bottom.  Next time I will put a little dipping juice (from the beef) out for each person.

This recipe was very easy and very good! I made it with a 3 lb. roast and cooked it for 11 hrs on low and it came out perfect, fork tender. The only change I made was to add some pepperoncini peppers and some juice from the pepperonicini jar. I think next time I will add a little bit more of each seasoning, it was good but a little mild.

I wasn't incredibly impressed with this beef.  I was looking for a recipe to re-create Portillo's Italian beef, but this was not it.  I did substitute beef broth for the water, but it was still lacking.  Maybe it was the cut of meat, I might try it again with a better cut like tri-tip, but as is, I felt the meat was dry even with 8 hours of slow cooking... The broth, however, was pretty good, so I did manage to eat the roast despite how dry the actual meat was.  For now though, I'll still have to order online to get my Portillo's fix.

This is wonderful.  We are from the Buffalo area, but have lived in Texas for 25 years.  The flavor is very close to "Beef on Wick".  I will be making this often.

This is my family favorite -- we make it all the time for parties and for Easter and other holidays when Turkey just won't do.  It's simple, tried and true.  It does taste just like famouse roast beef sands from a college town favorite restaurant.

Used a 1.5 pound beef chuck shoulder roast, english cut.  No idea what that means but they were buy one, get one free.  Threw the whole thing into the slow cooker and I did use the exact same measurements of herbs for 5 pounds but substituted one can of beef broth and added enough water to cover the meat. I also just threw in some onion sliced into rings for the last 2 hours.  It was fantastic, amazingly good.   I have a new slow cooker but had it in for 10 hours and the meat just melted and shredded itself.  Will be making this again ASAP.  Served on warmed rolls with melted swiss.

This is soooo good! I forgot hoagies so had to use regular bread and it was so delicious.  It is fatty, so you might want to refrigerate and skim. Not for calories but for mouth feel. Otherwise, I've got no complaints!

I listened to everyone else and used 2 cans of beef stock and no water. I also used two packets of italian dressing. I only cooked a 2.75 pound of chuck roast and seasoned to taste. I cooked on low for 6 hours, the meat was falling apart. I then shredded it and seasoned it again, I thought it was rather bland. I cooked it for an additional 2 hours on low and it came out GREAT!!!. I grilled onions and mushrooms, put that on a roll with provolone cheese and it's one great sandwich. I do have lots of gravy left so I am looking for things to do with it.

This recipe was awesome!  As a Chicagoan, I am picky about Italian Beef :)  My entire family loved this recipe...it didn't last long!  The only thing I would change in the future is that I would double all the ingredients except for the beef, because my family likes lots of gravy!  Thanks for sharing!

Made this for dinner one night it was fantastic. I cooked on high 3 1/2 hrs added one green bell pepper and one red bell pepper chopped and some mushrooms after shredding the roast turned down to low and cooked another 1 1/2hrs. Served on a toasted hoagie with melted provolone. Also I did add two packets seasoning.

So delicious! Everyone loved this, and it's so easy! I originally was going to slow cook a roast with another recipe, and already planned to add diced pepper & onion so I still added them to this and it was great even though they're not necessary, the flavor was just so great!  I was tempted to use another italian dressing package as many suggested but with so many other seasonings I decided to try it with only the one and it was plenty.  We will definitely have this regularly!

This is by far the BEST recipe I have ever made!!!  I too used 2 packets of Italian-style salad dressing and used a Chuck Roast.   Once it cooked I shredded it and put it back in the juice on warm for 1 hour.  My family LOVED it!  We are having it again for my husbands birthday meal with all the family!  You will not be disappointed in this recipe!

My husband made this tonight for dinner... He followed directions percisely, was a little hesitant about not adding additional ingredients, but we are so happy that he stuck with the recipe....Our whole family LOVED the meal.. We served it on toasted baguette slices and my kids, 5,3, and 1, all ate it up... Delicious meal.. Will definately make again!! !

This was SUPER yummy!! I used the comments and used 2 pkgs of dry italian dressing mix and beef broth insteand of water, the rest just like is stated. Tasted great but about 1-2hrs before serving I shredded the beef and threw in sliced onion, fresh basil and oregano (had a bunch in my garden) WOW really pumped up the italian flavors.

This was delicious and made such an easy, family pleasing meal. I had to make some changes due to health and dietary restrictions. I used a 2.85 lb boneless pork roast. I replaced 2 cups of water with low sodium chicken broth. I omitted the salt and onion salt and used about 2 tablespoons of dried onion. I cooked it in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours, shredded it, and then put it back in the broth for 30 minutes while I shredded some mozzarella to top the sandwiches with, toasted some sesame seed hamburger buns, and put together a strawberry spinach salad to go with it. We used the broth for dipping like au jus. This was very good, and we only had one child out of 3 children and 2 adults not eat theirs. Dh and I both had seconds. The meat was so good I had trouble not just picking at that. I also think the broth might make a good gravy for potatoes, or you could use the leftover broth and meat to make a stew. We'll be making this again for sure.

Just did this one last night, started it at about 10pm and left it in until around 11am on low before I finally shredded it and let rest back in the sauce for 30min or so. Served it on buttered toasted French loaf with melted provolone.  I think the only change I'll make when I cook it next time is doubling the salad dressing mixture, with the exception of the bay leaf. I thought the top half of the 2.5lb rump roast I used was a little drier and not as easily shredded as I would have liked.

This is GREAT! My family loves these on toasted buns.  It's nice to have something other than "roast beef" or bbq to do with my roasts.

This was so easy!  Instead of using all of the spices, I had some Emril's Italian Seasoning so I used that instead of all of the individual spices.  It was one of those meals, I didn't have any leftovers.  Great change of pace!

This is one of my favorite recipes ever, and a staple in our home. I do use a chuck roast and the beef broth instead of water, and sometimes change up the seasonings. Try it w/ chili powder, cumin, garlic, onion, oregano and cilantro w/ a generous dash of salsa for a Mexican style.

Great recipe, but feel it's better if you leave out the salad dressing mix.  I felt it was artificially over-seasoned the first time I made it.  Also, some salad mixes have MSG.  Such a tender meat dish with the mix of Italian spices make it very flavorful.  I serve mine on slightly toasted Italian Hoagie rolls with a slice of provolone cheese.  Great for parties!

Oh my goodness, this is soooo tasty, and the smell while cooking will drive you crazy.  I used a smaller beef roast that I already had, then pretty much followed the recipe but was liberal with the seasonings, and didn't do oregano because I was out.  Turned out great.  One thing, remove it from the pot, cool, then shred and you'll be able to remove more fat.  Then put it back in the pot and let it cook another hour or so.  So fine!!  This is a keeper!

My kids ask for this nearly every week. Because it's made in the crockpot, it couldn't be any easier. I serve it on sub buns with provolone or mozzarella slices and sauteed peppers and onions.

I made this recipe today and it was just delicious!  We loved the subtle flavors and tender roast.  I am looking forward to having a sandwich with it for lunch tomorrow.  We will have this again and often.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I doubled the Italian seasoning, used beef broth instead of water, and added some extra sugar. We served with sauteed onions and mushrooms, provolone cheese on a kaiser roll. We browned the sandwich under the broiler before eating. It was amazing!!! I'm only give this 4 stars because it was a bit salty. I will try using minced garlic and onions next time instead of powders (which give it a salty taste).

OMG!  This is really, really good.  The only change I made was to substitute beef broth for the water and didn't add additional salt.  My husband is a huge meat eater and absolutely loved this!  Thanks for sharing the great recipe.

Followed recipe exactly as is. Lacking flavor. Next time i will add another packet of seasoning,maybe double the spices,beef broth instead of water like other reviewers have said to do. This was way too plain.

This was pretty good, I hate to not rate it better since I changed it a little.  Instead of some of the liquid and Italian dressing mix, I put in 3/4 of a bottle of Italian dressing.  My son liked it.  My husband and I though it was ok, a nice change from the French dips we make all the time.

This was a good recipe, and a nice variation from the standard.  I don't think it was as good as I expected.  After reading the reviews on here I anticipated a bigger "WOW" factor.  I did make as directed on here with a few suggestions such as beef broth and extra dressing packets, which I think definitely added to the overall success.  Family liked it but didn't feel like it tasted much different from what I typicall make.

This was awesome with a couple of small changes.  I used beef broth instead of water for more flavor and, even though I halved the recipe (my roast was only about 2.7 pounds), I used the whole packet of Italian dressing mix.  Because of that, I used onion powder instead of onion salt so it wouldn't be too salty.  I served this on sesame seed hoagie rolls topped with melted mozzarella, sauteed onions, and fire roasted red peppers.  It was OMGosh GOOD!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this with a 5+ pound Sirloin Tip Round Roast (that's all they had cut at the grocer) it's a step up from a chuck roast and in the rump area.  Took the advice of many Reviewers:  Used the water and added 2 tsp. beef bouillon granuals.  Used the 2 pkgs. Italian Salad Dressing.  Did NOT put in the salt.  THIS WAS FABULOUS AND EVERYONE LOVED IT !!  Was going to put on the top some green peppers and onions, but decided NOT to.  Only toasted sub buns, put on wet meat and quickly melted the sliced provolone on top.  Served the juice (au jus) on the side for dipping.  No one wanted to take away from the taste the way it came out.  I may add the peppers and onions to the one left over sandwich I kept for later.  But we definately didn't want the peppers to change the present taste the way it was.  This is the way I will continue to make - after all, why break what isn't broken!?   As a slow cooker junkie - a tip I have for cooking roasts that you have added juice to:  Try to make sure all the roast is cooking IN the liquid.  Also make sure to use the right size Slow Cooker.  More is better.  Thanks for this great recipe.  It's already getting passed around.

This was one of the biggest failures in a recipe I have ever prepared.  It turned out like a salty sloppy mess.  I followed the directions exactly as written.  My husband asked me not to cook it again.  I was born and raised in Chicago and there is no comparison to the Italian beef served there. The meat tasted like a bad pot roast and just completely disinigrated in the juice. Too bad we were really looking forward to a taste of home.

I make this the day before, like another reviewer, in order to get the fat out.  With this, and most meat or poultry based slow cooker recipes, you can leave out the water,or maybe add half a can of broth. The meat will give up plenty of liquid, so it won't burn. Keep an eye on it the first time you  omit the liquid as slow cookers do vary.

I did use chuck roast, beef broth, omitted salts and doubled the Italian dressing mix. Had in slow cooker for 9 hours shredded it. As it was soaking up the juices I sauteed onions, mushrooms and peppers. Slapped it on a bun with some mozzarella cheese and put in the oven for a few mins to toast the bun. Let me tell u this was Outstanding!! For me this is one of those recipes that are above the best! Now I envy people in Chicago. hehehe

This recipe rocks!  I have made it 3 times now for different occassions and everyone that has tried it LOVES it... even two co-workers from Chicago.  I use two packages of the Italian dressing mix and low sodium beef broth instead of water.  I omit the salt called for as the beef broth and dressing mix have enough.  I do use the onion salt though.  I'm making it again this weekend and can't wait.  I serve it on hoagie rolls with Provolone that I put under the broiler for a little.  YUMMY!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I nixed the salt in this (there is plenty in the dressing mix) and used onion powder instead of onion salt.  I also used beef stock instead of water.  My family LOVED this!  A definite keeper!  Thanks!

Used 2-1/2 lb meat, but same amount of ingredients.  Was excellent.  Also added some Worcestershire Sauce.  This was excellent on some sliced french bread.  Yum.  Very rich tasting, and not too salty.  Will make this again- perfect for football season!

This sandwich was wonderful. When I made it I used beef broth in place of the water, I didn't add any salt and I replaced the onion salt with onion powder. To prepare the sandwich I spread some butter onto two halves of a hogie and sprinkled some garlic powder onto the butter. I broiled this until it was toasted. Then I added the meat, some sauteed mushrooms and onions and set a slice of provolone on top. I put this back under the broiler until the cheese melted. I chose to eat mine as an open face sandwich. This is a great addition to my recipe file.

This Italian beef had great flavor & the prep was easy.  I made some minor substitutions to the original recipe.  First off, I doubled the ingredients because I like to have extra gravy.  I used 4.5 pounds of brisket rather than the cut of meat suggested.  I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic (minced)as my husband loves it.  I also used beef broth in place of the water for more flavor.  (I did cut the salt considerably as there is plenty in the beef broth).  I cooked it in my crockpot on high for 5 hours, took the meat out to shread & remove the fat, then put it back in the crockpot for another 2 hours (on low).  The meat was flavorful & super tender.  I left the crockpot on until the next day (on warm) & the flavor was even better.  I am going to add peppers the next time, rather than serving them on the side.  I'll be making this again!

These hoagies were AMAZING! I used two packets of italian seasonings and beef broth instead of water as suggested by other reviewers with a 2 and 1/2 lb Certified Angus Beef rump roast. I let it cook on high for 4 hours, shredded the roast with two forks and placed it back into the crockpot. Then I added a bag of frozen 3 pepper and onion blend and let it all cook for another 30 mins. I piled the hoagies with the meat and peppers and topped it off with shredded mozzarella. Into the oven with the broiler turned on high for 5 mins until the cheese was melted and the bread toasted. It was really good and easy, which definitely means this recipe is a keeper!

I put this in the slow cooker before I went to bed.  I woke up to the most delicious smelling meal.  I made the recipe as listed, but I used a blended italian seasoning for the dried oregano and dried basil.  My family really enjoyed this meal and asked to have it again.

Sorry, but not a fan of this recipe as written and probably will not make again. I followed the recipe ingredients to a tee, way too salty and far to much pepper for our liking.  Also, I probably should have substituted the water for beef broth according to other reviews.

This recipe is wonderful!  I did the minor changes people mentioned, add beef broth in place of the water, two packets of Italian seasoning, no onion salt since it's salty enough. I seared my roast before putting it in the crock pot, cooked on low 8 hours, pulled meat apart in crock pot, and let it stew in the juices for another hour - fell apart perfectly.  I normally wouldn't like a"soagy" hoagie with a sandwich, but it is true - the wetter the better!  I added sauteed mushrooms and onions as well as peperoncini, topped with a moz/prov cheese and broiled for a couple minutes to melt cheese.  Pour those extra juices right on top.  Delicious!

as is this is a really good recipe, but of course, I can never leave any recipe alone without making it my own.  I added about 5 cloves of  fresh garlic (instead of the garlic powder)when I put the meat in the crockpot.  I also added some good olive oil at the same time. (about 1/3 cup)  Next time I will cut down on the amount of water.  The broth is really good, just a little too much for my taste, and with the olive oil, there was just too much liquid. I turned the buns into garlic buns (fixed like garlic bread..broiled and all)  then added a good kosher pickle as an extra.  Awesome.

This recipe is awesome!! So easy to make and makes a perfect amount for a small gathering! I had this for the first time at my Daughter's baby shower! I have to admit I am not a big beef eater, but after trying this it was soooo good, I had to make it myself! It has been a big hit with my Family. I have followed the advice to use Beef Broth instead of water, using onion powder instead of onion salt, and two packets of seasoning mix. I think these changes are a "must" for a delightful Italian Beef. The slower it cooks the better the flavor. I have even froze the leftovers and it takes just as good as when it was first made. This recipe is definetly a keeper!

Just made this last night for Christmas Eve at my house.  Absolutely fantastic.  I'm a Chicago native and still live here, and this was better than anything I've ever found at my local beef places - the meat was so moist, not dry like it sometimes gets.  Here's how I tweaked it - First, I used a bottom round roast. The butcher said that was better to use than the rump roast (a little pricier but definitely worth it!) I used all beef broth instead of the water, kept the salt and pepper to 1 tsp., but doubled ALL the other seasonings, including the dressing packets.  Only used 1 bay leaf.  It was so good I couldn't believe it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I gave this 2 stars for being easy and meat was tender. The thing is this wasn't even close to a Chicago beef. I thought instead of going to grab a beef sandwich (I live in Chicago)I would save some money. The main problem was that the meat (because of the crock pot) was shredding. Italian beef is roasted in an oven then sliced thin with a deli shaver so the texture wasn't right with this recipe. Also, the spices were missing something. I'm not sure what though but it just didn't taste like a real beef. I guess you would call this one a French Dip. Nice French Dip recipe but it shouldn't be called Italian Beef. We probably won't make this one again.

Do not use boullion (sp) beef cubes as substitutes for beef broth.  Overly salty to the point I almost threw it away.  There's a lot that melted cheese can do.

I used a three pound chuck roast and put it in the crock pot on high for 5 hours.  As others have suggested, I used beef broth instead of the water.  I put the meat in sub rolls with sauteed onions and fresh mushrooms topped with monterey jack cheese.  Then I stuck the sandwiches under the broiler for a few minutes!  Delicious!

This was great.  Based on other reviews, I used two of the italian dressing packets and was glad I did.  Also, I trimmed the meat well before placing it into the crockpot, so I didn't need to skim the fat off the top at the end.

Love being able to read all of your reviews before I make a dish. This time I followed the advice to buy the chuck roast instead of rump. Saved a bunch of money and the meat FELL APART. The smell in the whole house from this is fabulous. I made twice as much (I have a huge slow cooker) and not a drop went to waste. Friends & family said it brought back that Chicago taste we so miss. Spices are fantastic. The juice is a must. I split Italian bread into sandwich size rolls and added fresh minced garlic to some butter. Spread on rolls, topped with parmesan cheese and broiled them a few minutes to crisp up. Then dump that tender meat and glorious juice onto that bread. Add the peppers of your choice and honey, you're back in Chicago. A real blast from our past. Thanks for this one. Easy and delicious!

This was soooooooooo good!  And easy!  I love that you don't have to brown it for it to be good. The taste was so good and got many compliments.  I used a 2.5 lb chuck roast, 3 cups of beef broth and all the spices as in the recipe.  Put it in the crock pot for 10 hours, shred it at 8 hours, put on whole wheat French rolls and under the broiler with provolone cheese for 2 minutes.  I would cover all of the bread with cheese so it doesn't burn in the broiler!  The 2.5 roast make 7 sandwiches. If you want to impress with little work use this recipes.

As written, gotta give it 4 stars - with changes, I think this is a five-star recipe!  We have even served it to company and they ate it up!!  Made the following changes - used about 5 pounds of chuck roast, doubled all of the spices, used 4 cups of beef broth in lieu of water.  Cooked on high in crock pot for about 6 hours, take out the meat to shred.  Then I cut up about 2 onions and maybe 4-5 green peppers - placed those in the juices while I shred the meat, then add it all back to the crock pot for another hour or two.  Served on toasted hoagie rolls and it is just luscious!

I haven’t read all the other reviews so excuse me if I am redundant. This is GREAT!!!   I use this for “Italian Beef with Cheese and Hot Pepper Sandwiches”…  Open a hoagie bun and place on good helping of jalapeno peppers, followed by the Italian beef then pile on the mozzarella cheese.  Broil on a low rack in the oven to slowly warm the roll and melt the cheese.  It’s kinda unhealthy but really Good!

This was AMAZING!  I did everything the recipe called for with the exception that I used fresh herbs from my garden. 
We actually ate this as a pot roast.  My husband HATES pot roast, but when he smelled this he tried a piece and liked it SOOOOOO much that we opted to eat it sliced with some garlic mashed potatoes and some fresh baby green beans.  It was wonderful.  Thank you for a recipe that has finally let me serve pot roast in my home! I will be shredding the leftovers tonight and serving it with some fried onions and peppers.  YUM! Can't wait! Thanks again!

This was OK...used two Italian-style salad dressing mixes as suggested. It was an easy meal but, not sure if we'll make it again.

Great! We used a 3.5 lb roast, put all the seasonings on the night before (including some minced garlic) cooked it in the crock all day(about 9-10 hours), removed the meat, shredded, added back to the juice in the crock and cooked for another hour, adding some sliced onions, green and red pepper, and some juice from the jar of banana peppers.  After it was done simmering we lightly buttered some hoagie buns, broiled them in the oven, added the meat and some asiago-mozzarella cheese (suggested by another reviewer) broiled for another few minutes and then added toppings as desired (I used banana peppers and a couple of jalapeños). Mine seemed ok with only one packet of Italian dressing mix, though I don't think adding the other would have hurt it any. 1 can of beef broth was plenty and we had a lot of liquid to spare.  Husband reported it was better the second day, and he had to get out plastic spoons and let his coworkers have a taste. We will certainly add this to the rotation, thank you very much!

Very good recipe! The only change I made was I added 2 packets of Italian dressing and also added fresh sliced onions and a jar or pepperoncinis for an additional kick.

This recipe makes a good Italian beef sandwich.  I found a prepackaged seasoning on the internet which contains everything except the salt and pepper.  It's as close as I have had to Chicago deli sandwiches and I get to decide how much salt and pepper to use.  Its called DiFiore Seasoning and its at http://www.difioreseasoning.com

Made this the other night and my husband has not quit talking about it. I did use 2 pkgs italian seasoning, and substituted beef broth for the water. I also topped them with fried onions and roasted red bell peppers and pepper jack cheese and than ran them under the broiler. We will be making these again!

Best italian beef ever!  Although you do need to double the italian dressing mix.  Even better the second (and third) day!  We ate this three days in a row with no complaints!  I also use this recipe with deer roasts - you can't even tell it's deer!!

Went from a 3 star to a 5 star by letting the meat (after shredding) sit overnight. Used 2 cans broth and 1 can water, 1 1/2 packets Italian dressing mix, a hefty sprinkle of kosher salt and dried italian seasoning for more flavor. Also doubled the oregano and basil. Cooked 12 hours, shredded meat, and returned meat to juice (based on another review).  Also added sliced green pepper. Definitely makes the sandwich better. Served it on rolls with melted provolone cheese.  Delicious!! Thanks for the recipe!

Well, I'm from Chicago and although this was not exactly a "Chicago Beef" it was very good and easy to prepare. I doubled the Italian Dressing Powder as others suggested and used a Chuck Roast. This was definitely better the next day...it soaked up a lot more flavor!

Mmmmmmmm, this is an awesome recipe.  My family raved about it.  I did as some other reviews suggested - using beef broth instead of water, chuck instead of rump, doubled the salad dressing mix, put the meat back in to soak in the juices after shredding.  It turned out fantastic - the meat fell apart and it was so tender and delicious.  I'm saving this one to my recipe box for sure.  Thanks for sharing!

OMG, this is fantastic!!!  A definite keeper.  Usually when I put something in the crockpot, by dinnertime I'm sick of smelling it.  This smells fantastic!!!  I doubled the salad dressing mix and used beef broth as others did and we will definitely be having this often!  I did use chuck and groaned when I had to pick all the fat out.  But it was worth it!!!  This recipe made 10 hogie sandwiches for me and I used a 5 lb chuck roast.  Might make more for others but I'm really picky about getting all the fat out of it so that's something to consider when you make it.   Thank you so much for the recipe!   We loved it!!!

10 stars!  I also cooked my meat (use chuck roast) in beef broth, and I added sliced green and red peppers and onion slices to the mixture.  Turned out soooo good with provolone cheese on top.  We put the sandwiches open faced under the broiler to let the cheese brown.  The mixture freezes and reheats really well too.

We served this at a party in Chicago and it was a big hit. Not exactly like what we get around here, but very close. Used the beef stock instead of water, and cut back on the salt a little. One thing we did was rub salt and pepper on the roast and then seared it in a cast iron skillet before putting in the slow cooker.

This recipe was AMAZING!!!! I made 3 batches of it for my graduation party and every single one turned out perfect! I used 1 packet of italian seasonings and a 1/2 tsp of oregano (just bc I'm not a fan of it). I threw some whole pepperoncini peppers and some of the juice.  I also used 2-2 1/2 pound chuck roasts bc they were on sale.  After 12 hours in the slow cooker on low it just fell apart. I served them on dollar rolls with some provolone cheese. I will use this recipe everytime I make Italian beef!!!

Wonderful!  I had a 2.89 lb roast and halved the spices but still added the whole packet of italian seasoning.  Was wonderful.  I also sauted some green pepper, onions, and mushrooms.  I was in a pinch so I toasted some hot dog buns added the meat and some swiss cheese and placed under the broiler for a couple more min and then added the sauted veggies.  Wonderful and will def make again.

Living in Florida I miss my hometown Chicago.  This recipe helped bring a bit of that home.  I followed a few suggestions from other reviewers such as beef broth instead of water and 2 pkgs of Italien dressing seasoning.  Everything else followed the recipe exactly.  This was a HUGE hit with my family(even the kids!).  Can't wait to eat the leftovers.

OMG! This was sooo good! I added a pack of au jus and a touch of red wine to the crockpot a few hours into cooking. shredded up the beef with a fork and put it on buttered, crusty bread. I topped it with some shredded cheese-a three cheese blend-Asiago,provolone,and something else, it was awesome! This will make football party food.

overall a good recipe.  I made a few changes.  I used beef broth instead of water and 2 packs of Italian dressing mix.  It turned out a little salty for my taste so next time I will use half beef broth, half water and omit the salt.  Also too peppery.  I will cut that in half next time.  I served these on sub rolls with provolone cheese and put them under the broiler for a few minutes.  I will make this again.

We loved this recipe.  The grocery meat dept. swears london broil is the same as rump roast, but sliced.  I had to substitute two 2.5 london broils for the 5 lb rump.  Turned out GREAT. I added 2 pkg of italian seasoning and beef broth rather than water per other reviews.  It turned out shredded not sliced which was fine with us.  I served it on homemade onion buns.  I froze extra for future quick meals.

Meat was very tender, cooked for 11 hours on low, definitely needs more flavor, I used 2 packets of dressing and only had a 3 lb roast.  I used beef broth and everything else I did exactly, still not very tasty, I can't believe other people thought it was too salty.  May be shredding the meat half way through cooking will let it absorb the flavor more?  I'll try that next time.

Wow!  This is really impressive.  I used beef broth instead of water, hoping to use the leftovers for beef veggie soup tomorrow, and it was absolutely delicious!  It sounded to me like it was going to be awfully salty since so many of the seasonings were salty, but it was perfect.  The broth it made was to die for.  Thanks for a recipe that I will be using over and over.

Very very good. I also used beef broth, two packets of seasoning, and no extra salt. I did have trouble with it getting tender enough to shred--five hours on high in my crockpot just didn't do it--so next time I'll just allow a bit more time.

TO DIE FOR!! Don't have reservations about trying this recipe. I made a few small changes: added 2 pkg italian dressing mixes and cut out salt and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt because the dressing had enough sodium. Also added a whole jar of mild pepperoncini peppers undrained.  My neighbors wanted to know what I was cooking!  They could smell it next door! Took out the roast and shredded it with a fork, used cornstarch and water to thicken the juices in the pan, then added the meat and stirred well then served.  My kids loved it!

This was amazing!  We served this with a platter of provolone, pepperoncini, roasted peppers, hot peppers and crusty rolls.  It was a big hit for everyone.

Absolute best!!!!  My family and I took a trip to Chicago this summer. We feel in love with Italian Beef sandwiches from the restaurant next to your hotel. I have been craving them ever since we got back. This recipe is like being back in Chicago. I have made it 3 times over the last 2 weeks.   I just left the recipe  like it was. I think I will try some of the other suggestions. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the best Italian Beef I have had at home! I did not change anything, but toasted some hoagie rolls in the toaster oven with a slice of provolone cheese and some spicy mustard... sooo good, my DH likes the whole pepper thing which he adds also.

I thought this was so good and so easy.  I do wish I had read the other reviews first (I trusted the ratings) and tried to double the dressing and use beef stock.  It was yummy as is, but I bet it would be explosive with flavor if I used those recommendations.  We served it on portuguese rolls and loved them.  Can't wait to try it again.

I tried this recipe with beef chuck (pot roast cut) but it came out really really tough.  I had to cook it for 20 hours to make it shreddable.  Maybe I did something wrong.  Anyways, To make it like Portillo's Italian Beefs, I used 1 lb deli sliced rare roast beef.  I used 2 (14.5 oz) cans of beef broth instead of the water and doubled the dressing mix.  I only cooked it for 4 hours (or 2 on high).  I also added 2 sliced green peppers to the cooker an hour before it was done cooking, and served it with mozzarella on the bread.  Make sure to pack away the beef with the juice and dip the sandwich into it!

The entire family loved this recipe.  I used two cans of beef broth (14 oz.) and added two packets of salad dressing mix.  I have had requests to make again.  My  hubby had three sandwiches in a 12 hour period which is not so good for the diet, eh?  GREAT TASTE, EASY AS CAN BE.

I enjoyed "all" the reviews and got good tips from them - it was a hit in our house when our whole family gathered for Christmas - I made 2 recipes of it - one with London Broil and one with Chuck -  most of us like the texture of the Chuck better!

I LOVE this recipe!  I use a can of beef broth and refill the empty can about half full of water.  I have also used beer in place of the water (but still using beef broth).  Usually I have a 2 1/2 pound roast, so there is plenty of liquid.  My Husband and 3 kids love this, and I made it for Christmas day, and it was a huge hit with the rest of my family as well.  I slice sandwich rolls, and toast them under the broiler, when brown, I add provolone and put them back under the broiler to melt... delicious!!!  This is a staple for my reciped rotation!

Delicious!  I love italian beef sandwiches and this one is a keeper!  There were so many reviews that suggested replacing the water with beef broth and adding 2 packages of seasonings, that I decided to do that as well.  This is now my favorite recipe for beef!  Received lots of compliments!

Based on prior suggestions, I used beef broth instead of water, and only a 2.5 lb roast with the same amount of spices.  In the end, the flavors came out perfectly.  I served each sandwich on a toasted whole wheat roll and topped with onions, bell pepper, and mushrooms (sauteed in olive oil), a slice of provolone cheese, and this TO DIE FOR horseradish sauce I found on this site (Flank Steak with Horseradish Sauce submitted by Taste of Home's Light & Tasty...I HIGHLY recommend it! :).  Put em under the broiler for a few seconds and served.  I thought this made some pretty decent meat (may even be good in enchiladas...odd, considering italian spices were used...)...but the recipe probably would not have knocked my socks off without the additions I made to the sandwich.  The horseradish sauce absolutely MADE the meal, as I probably would have been ho-hum about it all, without it!  I will make this again...with the sauce, too - of course!!

Very tasty!  I did add some pepperoncini peppers and used 2 cans of beef broth with 1 cup of water.  Made a wonderful meal with crusty bread and mozzarella cheese and sauted onions.  Will definitely be a keeper.  So easy!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

First, this was my first use of either a roast or a crockpot - but everything turned out excellent!  I didn't have bay leaves and exchanged the onion salt for onion flakes - Also used 3 cups Swanson's Low Sodium Beef Broth instead of water & 2 italian dressing packets as suggested.  Cooked on high and after a few hours it was still tough so I got worried.  However, after hour 4 it was already very tender.  Shredded and cooked for another hour - Came out fantastic.  Boyfriend and son loved it and I'm making it again today!

This is a delicious recipe!  My husband and I both enjoyed it. He likes the au jus style sandwich and I like mozzerella and red sauce. I am not a fan of italian beef, but this was delicious! We didn't change a thing and will make this again.

THANK YOU for this recipe!  I'm from  Chicago but relocated to California 6 years ago and I miss the food back home DESPERATELY!  This fit the bill!  I followed the recipe as it was stated but I agree with a previous reviewer that it would be better to let the roast cook through and slice thin to be just like the consistency of true Italian beef sandwiches.  I also agree that it's best to use 2 packets of Italian seasoning because while this was very tasty, it could have used a bit more punch.  GREAT recipe!  Thank you Maureen!

I did make a few changes; first, I used sirloin tip roast and I also added 1 can of beef broth.  I cooked it in a Nesco cooker @250-275 degrees for 8 hours.  I refrigerator the roast overnight.  The next morning I sliced the roast thin.  Set it in the crocker pot along with it's own juices (after removing the grease off the top which had solidified) and reheated it for 6-8 hours on LOW.   EXCELLENT - Loved by everyone!

Definitely five stars... after a couple of small changes.  I used Zesty salad dressing mix, and I subbed half the water for beef broth.  I tasted the au jus/broth when I removed the roast to shred, and I thought it needed a little extra ooomph, so I added a second packet of the salad dressing mix.  Delicious.  I melted some mozarella on sub buns, then spooned on the meat and yummy au jus, finally topping the sandwiches with pepperoncini rings.  We dipped them in more au jus, letting the sandwich get reallllly wet before each bite.

We make this all the time....It is sooo good and we were raised on Chicago Italian Beef! The only changes that I make are that I use beef broth instead of water (or soup base and water) and I use Zesty Italian dressing mix. Oh, and sometimes we add half a jar of pepperocini peppers. Great recipe!

This was excellent!  I served these on french bakery buns with smoked provolone, carmelized onions, roasted peppers and horseradish sauce and used the juice for dipping!  Great recipe, I wouldn't change a thing.

This was an O.K. recipe but I still plan on using my regular recipe in the future. After sitting in the Italian dressing to cook, we found this not as flavorful as we expected.

This was really good! I doubled the amount of Italian Seasoning packets as we really like highly seasoned food and it was perfect. On hard rolls with some hot giardiniera(Dell'Alpe brand) these were just like Chicago style beef sandwiches.

I let my roast marinate overnight in the fridge. Also when the roast was done cooking, I sliced it and made a gravy with the 
juices by adding flour and water.. poured that over the meat and served with mashed potatoes and butter carrots. It was 
wonderful.. the gravy was very strong and tasty.. we put that only on the meat.. I felt it was too strong for the potatoes. All in 
all this recipe is now a permanent fixture in my recipe box! Plus when is cooks all day your house smells wonderful!!!

These were excellent!!  It was a little difficult shredding the beef, and I basically pulled it apart with my hands, but the taste was unbelievable!  I added onions, green, red, and yellow bell peppers.  My husband loved it on a sandwich, but the leftovers he has been eating without bread!

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I used thick sliced cube steaks, which worked out well. Next time I will try it with a rump roast. I carmelized onions and green peppers for the sandwiches, which was a nice touch. I used half the salt and instead of onion salt used onion powder. A definite make again!

Absolutely delicious, will make it again for sure. Cooking it over night on low, I would suggest over cooking the meat on high. Seasonings have more time to season the meat cooking it in its juices.

After reading numerous recipes and reviews online for Italian beef, I read the notes of MOMSAVEDBYGRACE and felt she had it figured it, so followed her steps. Used 4 c. of low sodium beef broth and added most of a lg. jar of pepperoncini—with juice—near the end. A keeper!

This was absolutely delicious Italian Beef and I live near Chicago and know my Italian Beef!
I used a Chuck roast instead of a rump roast and beef broth instead of water, but all the seasonings in the recipe were used and I used two packets of salad dressing instead of one.
I have a 6 quart Nesco that has a low 225° for slow cooking and I cooked it for 9 hours. It was scrumptious! I used French rolls buttered with garlic butter and broiled. Then added mozzarella and melted that under the broiler. I served it with peperoncini  peppers and marinara sauce....yuuuuuuuum! It doesn't get any better than that.
My roast was 4 lbs. and there was a perfect amount of seasoned broth for dipping.
If you love Italian Beef, this is the recipe you want to use. 
Just for reference, this served 3 people 2 meals...plenty of leftovers for us.

Amazing. I followed all the suggested changes from the top comment which included using beef broth instead of water, double the salad seasoning, Chuck roast instead of rump, and shred then put back in crock pot for an hour. My alterations included thinly slicing 1 vidalia onion which was used as a bed for the meat, 1 tsp of Italian seasoning, and 3 bay leaves. I used a hoagie bun that I cut open like a hot dog bun, placed 2 slices of thin provolone inside, and toasted for 2 minutes under the broiler. This created a good base that held all the gravy in without making it overly soggy. Topped it off with Marconi's Hot Giardiniera. Will definitely be making this one again!

I marinated the roast for 2 days then I seared the roast at 400° in a electric skillet with diced onion and green pepper. Put roast in pre-heated crock pot. De-glaze skillet with beef stock and pour into crock pot. This is the best Italian beef I have ever had.

When I visit my mom in Chicago, I find the sandwiches different from what I got sixty years ago.  Now they are much pepperier and instead of two pepperoncinis you often get a pile of gardiniere, which is much hotter.  Be sure to use crusty bread.  (A section of french bread is good.  Many breads will fall apart when soaked in juice.)   Then soak plenty of juice into the bread.  I just put the bread open-side-down atop the juice in the slow cooker for a few seconds to soak it.  You can also skip most of the seasonings and just use two envelopes of dressing mix.  My wife likes to use zesty dressing mix but I like to taste the beef and not just hot pepper, so I prefer regular dressing mix.

This is a great recipe. I have made it probably 5 times now. I do add 2 packages of dry italian salad dressing mix, fresh garlic, one sliced onion, 1 jar of sliced banana peppers, a few pickled jalopenos sliced, I use one can of beef broth and one cup of h20. I used a chuck roast this last time and it was great. I will have to try w/other cuts of beef but that is what the butcher recommended. I cooked it 7-8 hrs on low. This is a family favorite and I will continue to make it over and over and over forever. Serve on crusty rolls w/ provolone cheese and a horseradish mayo and hot peppers.

Such an AMAZING sandwich! I made it with a 3 pound chuck roast instead because I feel it has more flavor meat wise. I used a crusty French bread, after the meat was out of the crock pot I dipped the bread into the leftover juices topped the meat in then added some sauteed red bell pepper and onions. I then used provolone cheese, put the sandwiches in a cast iron skillet in the oven at 425 for about 10 minutes, just until the bread became golden and crusty. My husband is still talking about this amazing sandwich! So easy to prepare as well!

Almost perfect.. one little difference.  Add 1-2 TBL chili powder and use beef broth instead of water.  Now that's Italian Beef!!!  You cannot find Italian Beef anywhere else except in/near Chicago.

I've tried several recipes for italian beef and this was a huge hit! After reading the reviews, I did substitute beef broth for the water and used 2 packets of dry italian seasoning. I stir fried some onions, peppers and mushrooms and served with a mayo/wickles relish mix on italian deli bread. Amazing!

Loved this...Like other reviewers used a 2.5 pd CHUCK roast, cooked for 8 hours, pulled it out and shredded it, put it back in with a green pepper and pepperchini's. Used 2'x the dressing mix and same quantity of all other spices. My American/Italian guests not only went back for 2nds but couldn't stop talking about it.  Bravo!

I was disappointed. Followed all the instructions, even extra seasonings and used beef broth like others recommend.
We felt it was bland and way too much bread. Would probably enjoy the roast without hoagie rolls.

My boys really liked this and I was able to give it to them for lunch the next day in their thermos over rice.  We ate it for dinner over rice, and will eat it later in the week in the sandwich.  After reading all of the reviews, I need to go to Chicago to try these sandwiches!

Love this recipe, and I make it often!  I followed previous suggestions to double the seasonings (except the salt), using beef broth instead of water, and used either onion powder or dried onions instead of onion salt.

For those with IC, you might substitute thyme for the black pepper (if you can't tolerate it), leeks for the onion salt, a homemade Italian dressing seasoning (and leave out the onion), and an organic or homemade beef broth/stock.  Seems to work well for me, anyway, though I know everyone's triggers are different.

Doubled the Italian dressing as recommended and used chuck roast! I also thought it was important to shred at the 8hr mark. Amazing!

Made this many times. I also use two packs of Italian dressing mix (the zesty kind) and use beef stock instead of water. Also add a cube of Oxo, crushed red pepper, and a bit of Worcestershire.

I have made this recipe on several occasions (with some variations) and it has turned out great each time! The variations was the reason I could not rate this as 5 stars. I think the base recipe is very good and the meat comes out very tender. However I used beef broth instead of just water and a couple tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce. I also like spice, so after I add the salad dressing mixture, I covered the top of the roast with some roasted green chili peppers (with juice) which helps seal the top of the meat and adds to the flavor. Turned out very well and will make again!

This recipe saved me today.  I was starting to make something different but it happened that one of my ingredients had gone bad.  I was scrambling this morning before work to find an alternative and this is what I tried.  I used an Italian salad dressing I had in the fridge and left out the water.  I did not use salt or pepper.  Nixed the parsley although that would have been good.  Used minced garlic instead of powder.  Used 1/2 tsp of onion powder instead of onion salt.  Hubby said it was way better than what I was going to make originally.  We will definitely be making this again!

This recipe was a big hit with the whole family, even my pickiest eater.  We served it on Italian rolls with sauteed onions, garlic and assorted bell peppers.  I added a little horseradish sauce while my husband preferred deli mustard.  Hearty and delish!!

I followed the recipe except I cooked a 3 pound bottom round for three hours on high, removed and refrigerated. Once it was cold I sliced it with a meat slicer as thinlly as I could without shredding it.  Before serving I reheated the reserved cooking juices. I then dipped the sliced meat into the hot juice to reheat before placing on buns. I then dunked the whole sandwich bun and all into the juice before topping with giardinera I bought in a jar. Almost as good as Johnnies Italian beef we ate when we visited Chicago.

When I first started making this I was a little skeptical because of how easy it was. I was happy to find out it is a great recipe! It is nice to put on bread with peppers and I put a little toasted cheese on mine. It was very tasty and I will make it again :)

Ok Im from Chicago and I miss beef sandwiches trust me they are awesome..so I thought lets make it first off the seasoning is way off nothing like a good beef sandwich and chuck?  No you use top round but cooking as long as the recipe states is so wrong and it should NEVER be shredded.  The proper way is onion&garlic powder,Italian seasoning, salt & Pepper.  Coat the meat in a 13x9 pan pour in 2 cups of water and 4 beef boullion cubes/or beef base roast it in a 400 oven 30 min per pound, take out chill the meat overnight or at least 4 hours.  Save the "gravy" Slice meat paper thin then reheat in the juice do NOT leave it in there more then 10 min or it will become like leather.  Thats Italian Beef I really wanted this recipe to be good that I tried but it failed :(

It was so easy to make. Personally think fresh garlic, onion and parsley makes it better. Add some cornstarch to the strained juice to make a great gravy to soak up with the bun. Guys loved it, I think they all went home and made it themselves!

Delicious! Made this using a venison roast, substituted a can of beer and low sodium beef broth for the water and used fresh herbs from the garden instead of dry (triple the amounts when using fresh over dry...I used a tablespoon of each herb, 3 minced garlic cloves and a medium white onion).  It came out beautifully!  Note: I also added a sprig of fresh thyme because I happened to also have that in the garden, but I'm sure it would have been just as tasty without it.  I love a good meal from a crock-pot!

I followed the advice of the most helpful reviewer and this was just ok for me.  I think what ruined it was the chuck roast.  I would make again, but use a different type of beef.  I added mushrooms, onions and green peppers to the slow cooker after shredding the meat so they made a nice compliment to the sandwich.  I also used A LOT of pepperoncinis!!!

I have used this recipe time and again and love it!!! I usually make a double batch so I usually get really heavy handed with spices. At the end after shredding I add a bit of pepperchinni and it's juices. On a big hoagie bun with lots of provalone cheese it's like no other. I have made this for couple years now and everyone think s it is the best they have ever eaten. Thank you for the great addition to my collection!

I love and miss the Italian beef sandwhiches I use to get in the western burbs of Chicago.  Made this receipe and although not quite as good as the ones I use to buy, it did the job of satisfying my craving.  I haven't found any place here in wester OK that serves anything close to this type of sandwhich. I will definitely make it again.  Next time I will toast my hogie buns, and cut down on some of the salt.

LOVED this - with a few tweaks.  I used chicken broth instead of water, and used a little over half of the meat that the recipe calls for.  I think if I had used a whole 5 pound roast, it would not have been enough liquid.  I also added some dehydrated bell peppers about halfway through (I didn't have any fresh on hand), and added some Italian seasoning.  I did cut out the salt, since the broth had some salt, too.  It turned out really well, and I would definitely make it again, with these changes :D

This recipe is delicious. Like many others, I used chuck as it is easier to shred. I also substituted the water for beef broth. I didn't have any dried parsley on hand, but it didn't seem to matter. I topped mine with provolone cheese, mushrooms, onions, and green peppers. I broiled them for a minute so that the cheese would melt. I will absolutely make this again.

Wonderful sandwiches!  I used chiabatta bread rolls and thought I had died and gone to Heaven.  I don't understand what's not to like.  Oh well, to each their own.  Great stuff.

Used a 3 Lb roast (on sale), made 8 samdwiches.  All said the best hot roast beef samdwiches they ever ate.  Total cost $7.89.  Did cut back on the salt, used powder instead of onion salt, served w/horseradish.  Small amount left over & used it to stuff zucchini 2 days later.  Will make it again using a 5 Lb roast & freeze half for a day when I need a quicky.  Thanks for the recipe.

Certainly easy.  We felt something was missing.  Hubby opted for BBQ sauce on his, while I went with pickled jalapenos.  It helped.

I have made this recipe twice in one week because my husband who is an extremely picky eater loved it.I used beef chuck the first time which shredded beautifully the first time and used rump the second which did not shred so nice,so I threw some veggies in and made it a stew and it came out wonderfully.I have a smaller crock pot so adjusted the ingrediants accordingly.I used cambells french onion soup instead of water,and also used Good Seasons Zesty Italian mix.When I used the chuck and made sandwhiches everyone left asking for the recipe. Will most definitly be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! My butcher recommended a sirloin tip roast which I browned before putting into the crock. Otherwise followed the recipe as written. Very good with some sauteed sweet peppers and provolone cheese added to the sandwiches. Served it with Chef Johns Beans and Greens soup (from this site) and a salad for a great casual buffet.

Great recipe, very easy and it smelled the house up wonderfully. It also freezes well. I omitted the salt & used chopped onion vs. onion salt & still found it to be a little on the salty side. I am putting blame on the italian seasoning packet and next time I may try to make my own "season packet" instead of a store-bought one to cut down on the salt.

I made this for a Superbowl party this past weekend and it was sooooo yummy!! followed other reviewers advice and used beef broth instead of the water and two packets of italian dressing mix. I also added some fresh garlic. Was a big hit!! Will make again.

Tasty, but honestly, nothing to write home about.  We absolutely LOVE the Pepperoncini Beef recipe (from this site) and this didn't hold a candle.  Don't get me wrong, everyone liked it ok, but I probably won't make it again.  Used homemade Italian Dressing Mix (also from the site), and used a chuck roast, but kept everything else the same.  Update: second day added a generous sprinkling of more Italian dressing mix and a splash of vinegar.  Ate over rice with some steamed broccoli and it was pretty much amazing.  Definitely the trick for me was lots of extra seasoning, then this really hit the spot!

This was a great recipe.  I used a chuck roast instead of rump roast and didn't use the bay leaf because I didn't have one.  This was delicious and made great sandwiches.

This is one of the easiest and best tasting roasts ever! If you do not have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen then this is a recipe for you. It is really good with a little cheese, mushrooms, and onions on a toasted bun.

This is another delicious beef recipe to use for sandwiches.  I made as written, using 'Italian Dressing Mix' from AR, rather than the store bought version. These were served on a chewy roll with au jus on the side and 'Hot German Potato Salad Casserole' from AR.  This made for a wonderful meal.

Great Recipe!  Absolutely delicious. I made it for 10 people and it went way over the top.  I made the substitutions that were recommended in the other reviews using 2 cups of beef stock or broth and 1 cup of water instead of using all water.  I used 2 packages of Good Season Italian dressing mix instead of 1.  I used the chuck roast which I will never use again.  To fatty and the meat shrinks a lot.  I would use a rump roast instead.  Thank you for this great recipe!!

This recipe is EXCELLENT and VERY EASY to make! My co-workers always ask me if I plan to make these sandwiches whenever we hold an office luncheon. Using some suggestions from other reviewers, I use 3 cups of beef broth (instead of 3 cups of water) and 1 5-lb. chuck roast (instead of a rump roast). For the dry Italian-style salad dressing I use the brand by Good Seasons. In order for the meat to be really tender, I've found that it needs to be cooked on Low for 10 hours, then the meat shredded/pulled apart with a fork, then cooked on Low another 2 hours. Since the meat is juicy, I serve it on nice chewy rolls (I purchase French Hamburger rolls from Publix). This dish produces a lot of au jus so there's plenty for dipping. ENJOY!!!

I've never written a review from any of the recipes I have tried (and I love many) but this deserves it!  As others recommended, I doubled the dry Italian seasoning but didn't change anything else!  The sandwich was delicious!  The following day I put the leftovers back in the crockpot to heat through and used it for tacos and burritos!  My husband and boys LOVED it both ways! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Loved it! The meat was very tender. We used placed the meat on Hoagie buns, added sauteed green peppers and onions, mayo, banana peppers, and provolone. Then broiled until the cheese melted. So good and plenty for leftover sandwiches all week long.

This made for a fantastic sandwich!!  I followed the recipe except for replacing the water with beef broth and using a 3 lb chuck roast rather than a 5 lb rump.  My only issue was the amount of grease in the liquid.  I should have trimmed my roast more.  I took it out after about 8 hrs, trimmed the fat, shred the meat, and skimmed as much fat off the top of the juices as I could.  I then put the shredded meat back in the juices and let them cook more on low for another couple hours.  Total time in the slow cooker was about 11 hours.  I served it with sauteed mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers on hoagies with melty provolone.  Man!! Absolutely delicious!!!!

This is fantastic!! Whole family loved them. I serve them on crusty rolls with melted provolne over top with some homemade baked fries on the side and the extra juices for dipping.

4.5 stars.  I cut all ingredients in half except for the italian seasoning packet.  I sauteed peppers and onions separately and served on toasted hoagies with swiss cheese (after broiing to melt the cheese).  These were quite good!  Thanks for sharing this recipe,

We really enjoy this dish.  I make homemade sub rolls and add lettuce, mayo, tomato, onion, and sliced cheese. YUM! Before I put anything on the subroll, I use a spoon and add the juice from the meat to the bottom side of the roll, for us it seems to give it a little something extra.

This was a hit with my family. I would go a little heavier on the salt or add a few cubes of beef boullion.  plan on about 1/3-1/2 lb per person.

It was a pretty decent sandwich, not anything as good as all the reviews.  I had really high hopes for this recipe.  It must be a Chicago thing.   You know, when you grow up with something it has a special place in your heart.  I did as most of the reviews suggested.  It didn't need any salt and used garlic power instead of salt.  Replaced water and bouillon with broth, 2 packs of italian salad dressing.  I did what one suggested and sliced it and returned the meat to the sauce to cook more.  Don't slice.  Shredding is much better for this type of sandwich.  Also, make sure you use a real crusty roll.  As juicy as this meat is a softer roll just falls apart.  This just needed something.  If I make it again I'll try adding a tbs or 2 of tomato paste and see how that works.

Not great. I prepared this exactly as the recipe suggested and found it to be kind of tasteless. I don't know, others loved it so maybe I just expected something different.

This is a great way to cook a roast.  I only had about a 2 pound sirloin tip, so I cut all the spice measurements in half, except I did use the entire package of dressing mix and instead of water I used a whole can of beef broth.  I omitted the bay leaf because I didn't have one.  I cooked it for about 4 hours on high and it turned out wonderful.  Instead of making sandwitchs with it, I served it over rice, awesome, but I cannot wait to make a sandwitch with the leftovers tomorrow.

Probably one of the best recipes I have made on this site.  Only thing I make different is I use a 3lb chuck roast (it does cut easier) and 2 packets of Italian seasoning instead of one.  Also after I cut up the beef to let it soak in- I add 4 sliced pepperoncini's in the pot.  It adds a great kick but not too spicy :)

Made this for the Allstar program as a recipe I'd never tried before...well, I'll sure make it again! Did cut it down to six servings, but no other adjustments...flavor is amazing, not too salty, one of the best beef roast sammies I've ever had...served on Kaiser roll, next time I'll add a little horseradish to the bun, but it really needs no additional flavoring!

Delicious! Used beef broth instead of water, and added sliced peppers and onions for the last hour of cooking. Made into sandwiches and added slices of white cheddar and broiled for 2-3 min. More calories for dinner than we usually eat, but will reserve for special nights.

Very good! I put them on a hoagie after toasting the hoagie in the oven to help keep the hoagies strong and prevent them from getting too soggy from the juices.

The only reason for the 4 stars was that the original recipe needed a little bit of an upgrade for my tastes.  I followed the instructions of another reviewer below and used 2.5 lbs of chuck instead of rump roast for better separation on the beef. I also used 2 packs of italian dressing.  

The beef was a little salty with the ingredients listed as well.  I chose to use onion powder instead of salt and omitted the teaspoon of salt since the rest of the ingredients were pretty heavy in sodium anyway.  It also helped to let the beef sit in the pot with the juices after shredding for a couple extra hours to keep the meat juicy and soft.  

Provalone is my cheese of choice if using the meat for sandwiches, and a toasted roll is a must.  Throw on some grilled sweet peppers, onions, and mushrooms, and this recipe is an absolute knockout.

Good but not too much taste.  I added a can of diced tomatoes (drained) just to give it a bit more flavor and it really helped. Overall it was good

Beyond delicious.  Made almost to yhe T.  Used a top round roast on low for 8hours.  Served on rolls with provolone cheese under the broiler until toasted.  Used the left over juices from the meat as an au jus for the sandwich.  Hubby said .... To die for!

I took the suggestion of other reviews and added two packets of the dressing mix to a 3lb rump roast and it was fantastic!  My husband loved it so much he said he wants this at least twice a month.  If you love hot beef sandwiches, this is a recipe you must try.  Love it, love it, love it!!!!!!!!

I doubled spices as others recommended. I opened roll flat to make an open sandwich, added cooked up mushrooms, peppers and onions on top, slice of swiss cheese and melted in microwave.  However, found that the next day the leftovers soaking in the marinade all night made the meat extra tasty.  Next time I would make a day ahead and then reheat for the extra flavor after soaking in marinade.

This is it...the real deal.  I am not from chi-town but my best friend is and as a surprise made these delicious treats before he left the states - he thought I went to Chicago to get "the real deal".  The juices were amazing and the meat fabulous.  We made them wet with melted mozzarella.  The only thing that was missing was the Italian Giardineria.  Will definitely make again.

I made this last night and my husband couldn't stop raving about it. I used beef broth instead of water. In a seperate pan, I sauteed mushrooms, onions, and green pepper and served everything on hoagie rolls. Definitely a keeper!

I thought this tasted pretty good. I don't normally care for the broth from the crock pot, but this one had a lot of flavor. I let it cool down, skimmed the oil off the top, and then drizzled the broth on the rolls. I wasn't sure at first if the sandwich would have enough flavor on its own and caramelized onion and pepper rings on the stove on medium to add to the sandwiches. The only downside is it is kind of salty, for my taste, and I wasn't sure of the exact bun best for this. I went for a heartier one and I think a less dense sub roll would have been best. For some reason though I thought it was better the next day and we used the skimmed broth as an au jus type dipping sauce. It was very tasty that way. The bread, meat, and au jus to dip was all it needed.

Soooo good!  I used 3 C of water with 1 T Better Than Bullion Beef paste.  Next time I will try 2 tsp of the paste.  It was just a bit salty.  I didn't add the salt, used onion powder instead of onion salt, but I did use 2 packages of the dressing mix.  I use a 5 pound chuck roast.  After 8 hours it was falling apart, so I shredded and put it back in the juice for 1 1/2 hours.  I was amazed how the meat soaked up the juice, so be sure to do this.  I had cut most of the fat off the roast, but there was still more than I would like to see on top after cooling.  Next time I will use the suggestion to separate the meat from the juice and let it cool overnight, to skim the fat off, before adding the shredded meat to the juice.  I served it on Hoagie mult-grain rolls (Everyone used 1/2 roll and ate it open faced) with grilled onions and fire roasted red peppers.   Also served cole slaw and a fruit salad.  Everyone really enjoyed it and it couldn't have been easier to prepare for a large group. Thank you so much for the "keeper".

this is AWESOME!! the first time I made this - I followed the directions and it was good - if you are making a full roast - use 2 packets of the italian seasoning and add a tbsp minced garlic to it - also, sear the meat before you put it in the slow cooker - mix some flour and you favorite seasonings (season salt pepper onion powder garlic powder) shred it about and hour or two before it is done - at walmart they have different types of bread - my favorite was the garlic parmesan - i tried the everything bread and it was good too - kinda salty though. I sauteed the onions and bell peppers instead of mixing them in with the meat - serve with provalone cheese - YUMMMMMMMYYYYYYYY

Made this using a lean eye of round roast and added some jalapenos and sliced green peppers and onion during the last 2 hours of cooking. I think I added a few too many jalapenos, as it was quite spicy to the taste just eating the meat by itself from the crock pot. I served it on rolls with provolone cheese and it was a hit, although too spicy for my liking. Guests seemed to like it, next time, hoever, I won't add as many jalapenos.

This turned out really bland, even after lots of cook time. I wound up adding pepperoncinis to the sauce and more Italian seasoning, as well as cornstarch to try and thicken it. It's just... really flat.

This recipe is soooooo good! I read a couple of other reviews and used 2 packets of italian dressing and 2 cups of beef broth and 1 cup of water.  After shredding the beef, I added sliced green and red peppers to the mix and let it cook for about an hour.  I served it on homemade french rolls with provolone cheese and carmelized sweet onions.  We were in heaven!  Took the left overs today to my mom's house and everyone there loved it too!  I will be making this again and again!!!

Used equivalent to 2 pkg dressing (home-made from recipe from this site)mix, used beef broth in place of water. Use onion powder and omitted salt. Cooked day ahead, shredded and refrigerated, reheated next day. This allowed the flavors to develop. Served on Italian rolls I sliced spread with butter and garlic and broiled til golden brown. Piled on the beef along with roasted red and green sweet peppers and mozzarella & provolone cheeses. Put back under broiler til cheese was melted, Served with juice for dipping. WOW! Fabulous! 4/12/2012 revised: I tried using one pkg Good Seasons dressing mix plus equivalent to 1 pkg homemade mix. I forgot and added salt that the recipe calls for and it made the juice WAY too salty. However, the meat was  not too salty. I used venison roast and this provided a juicy full flavored sandwich. Did not make ahead of time, served right after cooking. SUPERB! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Wow these are great... the only thing I did differently was add a couple bollion cubes to the water when I boiled the spices... I also but the shredded meat back into the juice and cooked for another hour... I served on a homemade hoagie bun and topped with sauteed onions and green peppers and the juice... AMAZING!!

Wonderful beef sandwiches.  I always get lots of compliments.  Only complaint is that I always struggle to find the bay leaf...I need to start fishing it out before I shred the meat!

My husband loved this!  I followed others advise and used beef broth and the smaller roast with the same seasonings.  Toasted buns and melted provolone.  Added Ghiradino (sp?) peppers.

This meat had no flavor. The broth was ok. The only thing that saved my sandwiches was all the cheese and peppers and onions. I wish I liked it better after all the trouble.

This is awesome! I'm from Chicago and miss a good dipped italian beef sandwich.  I did use 2 cups beef broth, 1 cup water, cut down on salt, and added a few pepperocini with juice.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've used this recipe for both dinner with my husband, as well as for a medium-sized Christmas party (about 30 people-doubled the recipe) and had fantastic results both times!  I used a little less salt and pepper, had to substitute onion powder for the onion salt, and had to substitute garlic salt for the garlic powder.  I followed the suggestion to shred the meat 1-2 hours before it is done...very easy to do.  I have also used chicken breasts instead of beef and was quite pleased with the results!  My husband thought the chicken was a little too "bold" on its own but having it on bread provided the balance it needed.

In fairness, I have never been to Chicago to try the actual sandwich and I am eager and curious to do just that. 
I added beef boullion to the water and used two pkgs of I talian dressing mix (G.S.).
The house DID smell deliciousand I was quite excited! However I cooked it for 8 hours on low,and it was falling apart tender. As much as the smell was wonderful, it tasted like good but bland pot roast. The roasted red peppers and cheese on the sandwich were all that saved it. 
It was an all day not bad sandwich. I am not sure if maybe adding the seasoning later or using more if the delicious smelling flavor would have stayed?
I took half of the leftovers and made Allrecipes beef and cabbage soup, and the other half I turned into a batch of chili.  It could have been delicious I guess if the flavors lasted so less time or more of the ingredients

So easy and tasty too! I have made this recipe for SuperBowl Sunday the last 4 years. Absolutely wonderful. 
I have followed others suggestions to use beef broth instead of water. I omit the salt all together and use onion powder. Definately double the italian dressing mix and I have never used a bay leaf. Some complain about it being to peppery but I have found that while the broth mixture is quite strong the meat is not. Due the the amount that I make, sometimes double, I have started cooking it a day in advance. Let it cool, shred it, then refrigerate overnight. Set on low about 4-5 hours before serving.

My husband and his parents are from Chicago, I made this recipe, along with homemade sub rolls, and my husband and inlaws loved it....they said it was as good as the italian beef that they used to get in Chicago! I don't have a slow cooker, so I followed the directions as written and cooked it on low to medium heat on the stovetop. It is an awesome recipe, the whole family enjoyed it and are asking when i'm gonna make it again, even my picky 8 year old ate it all up and asked for more.....I will definately make this many times in the future!!!

This is a REALLY good version of Italian Beef.  My family has had it several times already and it is a hit every time!  This is a nice base recipe from which you can add you own flare to as well.  I like to put various spices or flavors in this recipe.  Also, I strongly suggest at least offering Banana Peppers and Provolone cheese as toppers for the subs/sandwiches you serve; they really set the flavor off.

This is so easy and it's my son's very favorite meal.  I make it and then serve it the next day.  The flavors are much better the second day.  I serve it on hoagie buns with provolone cheese melted on top.  Thanks for a great crockpot recipe.

I made this for my two boys, and the 10 yr old finished his before I could start mine! I made two changes; substituted beef broth for the water and used two dressing packets. I served it on crusty italian rolls with pepperoncini and melted provolone cheese. Great recipe, this will be a permanent dish in our house. Thanks!

This was really good. However, it was so cooked that it wouldn't slice. It was more like shredded beef. Maybe next time I will take it out of the crock pot sooner. Still really good though.

This is the best recipe to feed a crowd and make everyone happy. We used liquid Italian dressing, and all the spices, just added water as needed. We sauteed mushrooms, onions, and peppers. After shredding the beef, we put it all on hoagie rolls with provolone, and dipped them in au jus that we made from a mix. So good, will make again!

EXCELLENT and easy!  I add 2 beef bouillion cubes to the crockpot along with some peppers, onions and horseradish for a little kick.  Serve it on fresh rolls and you can put out sides like red onion, pickled onions, cheese or even marinated mushrooms to complement the sandwich,

Made this a few days before Christmas for the family to try.  My 17 year old granddaughter is a fussy eater and she loved this.  The rest of the family did too.  My 15 year old grandson can't eat wheat or dairy so I made this without the dressing mix but added a bouillon cube.  Didn't realize that ithad wheat products in it so he coulodn't eat it.  Next time I will try it with homemade broth and herbs.  I am going to make this for my couples card club and I know it will be a hit.

Made this for my mom for Christmas - she was born and raised in Chicago and has gone on about the hot beef sandwiches there since I was a child (20 years now!).  She said this was right on and asked to keep the leftovers!  We did a 3 pound (not 5) roast for 8 hours on low, but with the same amount of of spices and liquid.   Will definitely do this again.  Don't forget the pepperoncini pepper and crusty rolls to go with it!

I live in the Chicago area. This was good, but does not taste like a true Italian Beef. I would make it again because it is tasty and super easy... just not an Italian beef.

I usually don't like this kind of sandwich, but my husband does & it got rave reviews, so thought I'd give it a whirl.  He gave it 4 stars, my 10 year old son gave it 4 1/2 out of 5.  It was a hit.  I followed the suggestions of using beef broth instead of water, using a chuck roast instead of a rump roast, used 2 packets of salad dressing mix, & shredded the meat after 8 hours & cooked it the remaining time after shredding.

I used a can of beef broth instead of water and put in 2 packets of Italian seasoning instead of 1.  Otherwise I stayed true to the recipie with awesome results.  Served on regular hamburger buns with provalone cheese. My husband almost didn't let me have any he liked it so much!

This was great.  I used beef brisket b/c it was really cheap and it was excellent. I just left in in the slow cooker on low before I left the house in the morning and 10 hours later, voila!  I sauteed some onions and peppers and broiled butttered buns.  Then I put the meat and veggies on and melted mozarella on the top and bottoms. Excellent! And the recipe doesn't call for broth so since there were reviews that said it was too salty I justed used water as instructed and there was no issue with the salt level. Maybe you should try following the recipe and not give the recipe a bad review when you modified it.

My family loved this!  10/10!  I added 3 beef bullion cubes, since I didn't have beef broth, and I used a beef brisket.  Shredded the beef about an hour before we were going to eat.  Put the beef and slices of provolone cheese on the hoagie rolls, and put under the broiler for 3 minutes.  Excellent!

I've made this twice and both times it was very dry.  There just isn't enough liquid to cover the meat.  It's also pretty bland.

Ok, let me preface this by saying that I have never had Italian Beef sandwiches so I have nothing to compare this taste to. After reading many of the reviews, I was hesitant to make the recipe as given, but I didn't have any beef broth to add, plus I thought that made it sound more French Dip-ish, so decided to give it a shot as written. My roast was only 2.5 pounds, but I made with the ingredients directed for a 5 lb roast, shredded the beef about an hour before I planned to serve the sandwiches, waited an hour and then tasted.  I was not impressed, very bland and pot roast tasting....so I added half an onion, half a jar of peppercini juice and about a quarter a jar of peppercini's, and another salad dressing packet...waited another hour (smelled awesome- we were starving!) and it was AMAZING. Hubby moaned when he dipped in the juice and took a bite. Everyone agreed this was a keeper, and if I had not had to modify so much, I would give it a 5...made as directed its a 2.

Sooooooo good, I sliced the beef, and placed it back in the broth for 30 minutes before I served.  Also added a sliced onion to the broth at the beginning, also use beef broth instead of water.  Made homemade french bread from this site, is for my bread machine.  Served with Macaroni salad from this site, do not pass up.. Will be a regular to my slow cooker recipes.

My whole family enjoyed this and said they'd like me to make it again.  I served it on hard rolls and drizzled the juice over the meat so the bun soaked up a bit which made a wonderful juicy sandwich.  Without the juice, it would have been dry.   My 13year old rated this as a "10".  My husband and 11 year old rated it as a 4 (until I added more juice to their sandwich), my 5 year old said "mmm this is good"

Delighful! My family loved this beef sandwich with rolls. We thought the dipping broth were savory and the best ever. Used 3.5 lb rump roast, beef broth instead of water, 2 packets and everything else the same. Because I didn't want it to be very tender for shredding, instead, I slow cooked it for 9 hrs, sliced it, then threw back with broth for an additional hour. I also made pickled peppers and carrots (AR) to go along with the sandwich for my husband because he  likes it spicy.

I'm giving this 5 stars b/c it was easy; however, I've never cooked the spices and mix - simply add to the crockpot.  I used beef broth in place of the water and used 3 packets of the Italian seasoning mix. I put two packets in with the roast (used 6 lbs as this was for a tailgate) when I first put it on and cooked it on low for 8 hours. I then shredded, removed the access fat, and put back in the crock pot and added an onion and another packet of the dry Italian seasoning mix and cooked another hour. I served on french bread and had provolone cheese available. This was a huge hit at the game!

This was excellent.  The only changes that I made were to substitute beef broth for water, and 1.5 packets of the Italian Seasoning.  I had it ready to serve opening day of football, and it was devoured.  People had the option of using barbecue sauce, horseradish, or eating it French dip style...it was a big hit.

I did not have all the ingredients, I was missing basil, onion salt, parsley, and garlic powder.  I used Onion and Roasted Garlic soup mix instead, I used the dry Italain salad dressing, and teaspoon each of, garlic plus, Italiano seasoning, fresh ground pepper, 3 bay leaves, (mine were small), 5 pound rump roast, 1 can of beef broth and water to equal 3 cups, did not add salt because of the soup mix.  I trimmed all the llittle bits of fat off the roast, took the strings off. and followed the recipe directions.  The meat fell apart with a fork, I added the meat back to the yummy juice. I melted cheddar cheese on warm NAAN  bread  piled on the beef.  My husband LOVED it.  I will make this again and will have the missing ingredients.  But this version was wonderful!

great recipe. I followed other reviews as followed. 1. I used a 2 1/2 chuck roast 2. used two packets of the dry Italian seasoning 3. used three cups of low sodium beef broth. Also I added all of the   ingredients to the crock pot without boiling the dressing and broth first, and it came out amazing. I toasted some rolls and added provolone cheese. This was a wonderful meal that I will keep in rotation!

Unbelievable. I didn't bother to boil the ingredients before, I just coated the roast with the dry products and put it in the crock pot. I used 6 cups of water and 2 packets of italian dressing powder. Next time I'll use less water - the meat didn't absorb the flavor as much as I would have thought, but was still really ridiculously good.   I put the beef into split bakery hoagie rolls, topped with crushed red pepper and a shredded mix of italian cheeses, put hot pepper rings on top of that and a little more cheese, and broiled them for 3-5 minutes to brown. It was stellar!!!

This recipe is outstanding. I served this tonight for my boyfriend and I, on whole wheat dinner rolls from scratch. Banana peppers really make this  sandwich. I also used the juices for dipping. I used a 2lb roast for the recipe but didn't divide the ingredients. Cook on low for 8-9 hours for the 2lb. I served sweet potatoes as a side and a salad topped with strawberries, pecans, red onion and feta.

Live in chicago and this was closer to the real thing and better then expected. I used others notes and used beef broth instead of water. I also added chili pepper flakes. I left out the salt all together and doubled the salad dressing mix. I only used 2LB beef. It came out salty to me. but will definitely try again.

This was fantastic!!!!  I added 4 fresh cloves of garlic instead of powder and then crushed them when I shredded the beef.  I used chuck roast because it shreds better and I added two packets of italian seasoning and it had so much flavor.  This was delicious!!!!

We made this for approx 20 people.  Used broth instead of water, but otherwise made as here.  A side crock with onions and green peppers, plus a plate of provolone and some hot horseradish really made this a hit.  We received LOADS of compliments!

Yum! I didn't have the onion salt or the bay leaf and it still turned out awesome.  Instead of water I added condensed french onion soup and a 12 oz beer.  Everyone raved about it!

This recipe is delicious and super easy. We add a slice of provolone cheese just before serving and pop it under the broiler. Thank you for sharing

This is my 11 yo son’s favorite meal. I have made it many times over the years. Today I am tweaking and using a 32 oz box of beef stock in place of the water, omitted the salt, but used the 1/2 tsp onion salt and only used 1/4 tsp of pepper. I added fresh garlic and 1/2 cup of sherry.  Otherwise made it as is. I used a 3lb chuck roast and cooked it on low for 9 hours. During the last hour, I threw in fresh sliced mushrooms and sliced onions. I put the meat, mushrooms, onions and provolone cheese on hoagie rolls and placed under the broiler. We then use the au jus for French dip sandwiches and serve with hot mashed potatoes. Yummy!

EXCELLANT!! Im giving a huge party the end of March and love to make homemade food only for my guests.  I wanted to make Italian Beef sandwiches as one of my entrees. I can not say enough about this recipe. Im going to have trouble convincing everyone that I did make this. It is better than any deli/dinner Ive ever had. Other readers changed a few  things with the recipe. I decided to give it a try first before changing anything. Well, I wont be touching it. Recipe is perfect. Dont hesitate to try.

My very first recipe used from this site and my very first attempt at making Italian Beef resulted in a GRAND SLAM. This is a great recipe, a little salty but not to the extent that I'd change a thing. All the flavors came together very well. I ll never need to look for another Italian Beef recipe again.

Love this recipe!  My family loves it too (my 4 year old eats this better than pizza!).  I've made this recipe for several years.  It is so easy.  Great for having a large group over.  Freezes well for quick and easy busy weeknight dinners.

Are you kidding? That is one of the easiest and best tasting dinners we have ever made. I didnt change a thing. Its painful to read these reviews where people change every aspect of the recipe and then give it one star and complain about the taste.. I will admit we used a 3lb roast but it was Phenomenal!!! My seven year old boy who hates everything but pizza went back for seconds. I have had Portillos and i like this better.

Need another star! Had never had Italian beef before but it sounded good and it was! I did the recommended alterations of no extra salt, extra packet of Italian dressing and beef broth. I've been told by the hubby that we WILL doing that one again and again.

This is amazing!  Used 2 pkgs italian season mix and a 2.5 lb chuck roast.  After 8 hrs on high, removed meat, shredded (did that by itself pretty much) and returned meat to juice in crock pot for another hour.  Simply amazing!

This was a really great recipe for Italian Beef. It reminded me of good ol' Chicago food. I didn't add the green peppers (I forgot to get them from the store), but it still turned out fantastic. Next time I'm going to throw some Italian Sausage in to make a combo sandwich. --oh, and a loaf of sliced Italian bread. I'm already starting to drool.

Turned out well.  I used zesty Italian dressing mix instead and added some more black pepper.  It had a good flavor.

My hubbby loved this!  I split and toast some Cotton's French twin loaf bread with a little mayo & the au jus on the side for dipping.  Creates a po boy that is embarassingly easy.  I was a little concerned about the veggies in the jars, but they cooked down to almost nothing.  Snuck those veggies in on my carnivore husband by mashing the remaining whole ones and he never knew it.  It is more flavorful when I season the meat the day before cooking.  4 stars for flavor (something is still missing, but I'm not sure what) and 5 stars for how easy it is to cook.

WOW!!! Fabulous recipe!!! Love, love, love it!! Only changes I made were 2 packages of italian dressing mix, onion powder instead of salt and added 2 beef boulion cubes. Served it on steak rolls with roasted onions and bell peppers, topped with provolone cheese and put under broiler. YUMMY!!! It had so much flavor!! You have to make this, it's the best recipe I have found on this site so far!

Awesome!  Took the advice of those who doubled the italian dressing and would even try it tripled next time.  Sauteed red onions in butter and served on the side along with shredded cheese mix with romano and parmesan.  Found it difficult to shred the meat cooked on high.  Next time I will cook it on low and see if it's any different.

This is positively outstanding! My family was blown away by how good this was. As other reviewers noted, I used 3 cups of beef stock instead of water, no salt, 2 (.7 ounce) packages of dry Italian salad dressing mix, and a chuck roast. I used the seasonings as noted in the recipe. The au jus is to die for! For my sandwiches, I topped them with sauteed onions, peppers and mushrooms, added a slice of provolone cheese. Popped it under the broiler to melt the cheese. Dinner was fantastic!! Serve this to your family and you'll be a rock star ... guaranteed.

My family enjoyed the sandwiches. It's not exactly like a Chicago-style Italian beef, but it's still delicious. I used 3 cups of beef stock (no salt added) and about 1/2 a cup of zinfandel for the liquid instead of water. I also used 2 packages of italian dressing, as others suggested. I used a chuck roast and it turned out great. My roast was just over 4 pounds and it cooked fairly quickly. It was done within 7 hours. I shredded it at 7 hours and turned the crockpot down to low/warm for another hour and a half or so. I'll make this again.

AMAZING!  I used beef broth instead of water as other reviewers had suggested and as I typically do when I make a roast.  At the end, I grilled/sauteed some onions and green peppers in a skillet in a little olive oil, then shredded the beef and mixed it all together (with some onion and garlic salt and some pepper), then served on deli rolls with pepperjack cheese.  DELICIOUS!

I would make this again. It was good but not amazing. I used the beef broth and two packages of Italian dressing mix. I'm glad I did because even using the extra packet of dressing I expected more flavor. I served it on toasted rolls with sauteed onions, provlone cheese and hot pepper rings. Definately easy.

Oh my gosh.  How easy and how delicious!  The roast I had was only 3.5 lbs, so I used just two cups of water.  I used two packages of the dry Italian salad dressing mix.  Put it in the crockpot on low all night and this morning shredded it, then returned it to the juices.  I absolutely love this recipe.

Excellent!  I agree with earlier comments that this must be eaten with as much of the juices as possible.  The tender, juicy beef is made even more delicious served with provolone, peppers, and onions.  This gives me something new to do with a beef roast and my trusty crock pot.

This recipe was fantastic! I added 2 tsp of beef boullion granuales and used onion powder instead of onion salt. I served it on mini Kaiser rolls for my son's baptism and it was very flavorfull and easy to make. I will definately make it again and again.

I grew up eating only the finest italian beef and sausage sands (Gary,Ind). This was great! I added some fresh cubanelle peppers, topped it with a lil marinara, and called it dinner! Definately a keeper!

Excellent! I added a good bit of garlic, because just like with chocolate, too much garlic is just enough. :) The meat was flavorful and very tender. I served the juices alongside the sandwiches, French Dip style. I also made the Creamy Horseradish Sauce from this site, which was a great accompaniment. The whole crowd loved this.

I followed the directions the 1st time and give it 4 stars.  The 2nd time, I added a jar of pepperoncinis and 1 small can of beef broth, got rid of the water, and used all other ingredients.... delicious!

Excellent, simple, and very tasty!! And the kids even loved it.  The great thing about the slow cooker is that it's not a hassle to make a quick side dish to go with.  This one is definitely a repeat!!

I also used mostly beef broth and two salad dressing packets.  I also added some crushed red pepper.  We ate them once without sauted onions and the italian peppers and then ate them again with those on the sandwich.  It was so much tastier after those were added and I don't usually like sauted onions.  We also broiled the sandwiches (open faced) for a few minutes with provolone cheese on top.  So scrumptious!!!  I had to freeze two more meals of this stuff because it makes so much.  It freezes great!  I just warm it up again and add a little more beef broth to the meat.

While this was good, it didn't meet the family's great expectations!  I used all beef broth and two salad dressing packets like others had suggested.  I think to the leftovers I'll maybe add some Worcestershire sauce and horseradish!  UPDATE:  We had this for the Fourth of July dinner, and it was outstanding.  I believe the difference was that I cooked it in three cups of the leftover broth from Ken from CA's Simple Carnitas (I always keep that in one-cup portions in my freezer!).  It was really good on Honey Wheat Sandwich Rolls from this site.  I added carmelized onions and roasted red peppers to the sandwiches!  YUM!

Nice, easy, delicious recipe.  I omitted the salt and used beef broth in place of the water and doubled the dry Italian dressing mix.  This turned out great.  My whole family enjoyed this especially my husband.

Like others have suggested, I used 3 cans low-sodium beef broth in place of water, omitted the salt, used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and used two packets of Italian seasoning. I also used chuck roast instead of rump roast. I shredded the meat an hour before it was time to eat and let it simmer in the broth. We served the beef on toasted kaiser and hoagie rolls, topped with provolone cheese.

Almost 5 star.  I even added a little can of sliced jalepeno peppers to the crock pot, but it still needed just a little bit more intensity of flavor for me.  I will try toping the sandwhich with sliced grilled onions & bell peppers next time.  Very easy recipe.

The final product was delicious.  This recipe was used as a guideline with the following changes:    1.  Water was substituted with beef broth. 2.  I used 1/2 bottle Italian dressing. 3.  All of the other seasonings and spices were substituted with about 2 tbsps of grilling salt combo.  The remaining liquid was used to make a gravy that was poured over the shredded beef on a crispy french bread, sourdough sandwich.    Everyone in my family was impressed with this and would like for me to prepare it again.

I have to give this 4 stars because I deviated a bit from the original recipe. I used beef broth instead of water. I also used a 2.5 lb roast but kept the originally called for amounts of seasoning and water/broth. I put it in the crock pot for 3 hours on high and about 6 more hours on low. About an hour before I took it off I shredded the meat so it could soak up the flavor - this is a pretty essential step. The result was excellent. I don't know if I'd love it so much with water, but the broth was nice. Definitely use low sodium broth! I skipped the salt entirely the second time I made it, and that was a good decision. It's just too salty otherwise. Served on toasted hoagie bread with red and green peppers, sweet red onions, and provolone cheese. This is definitely a recipe we will make again. Thanks.

Great recipe!!  First time having a Chico style beef sandwich.  I made the recipe as it was written and it came out perfect and not too salty like some reviews have said.  Looking forward to making it again soon.

Loved this dish.  Super simple.  I do not even like beef and I had a half a sandwich with this one.  Added some green peppers and provolone cheese to a nice soft french roll and was in "heaven".   Thank you for sharing.

This was very easy and good. As suggested, I used the beef broth instead of water and the 1.5 oz package of italian dressing mix. I also added about 2 cups of onions sliced to the bottom of the slow cooker before putting the meat in, and did not use onion powder. Great-minimal effort, and several people asked for the recipe. Would definately make it again.

This was good, but not really great.  The seasonings didn't seem to stick to the meat like I'd hoped.  I even tried pouring some of the juices on top of the meat but that made for a soggy haogie bun.

This was excellent and very easy to put together in the morning before leaving for work.  I didn't have any onion salt so I used some onion powder instead.  I put some baby carrots in the bottom of my crockpot and let them cook in the juices all day long.  I pulled them out when I pulled the roast out to shred.  I added a little bit of cornstarch to the juices to thicken it up a bit before adding the shredded meat back in.  I let the meat soak up in the liquid for about another half hour before serving.  So tender and full of flavor!

Never having been in Chicago, and having never had an Italian Beef Sandwich, I have nothing to compare this to, but this recipe definitely makes an amazingly tasty sandwich! Following some suggestions, I used two packages of Italian Dressing mix, added some pepperoncinis, and used a chuck roast for easier shredding. My kids and I ate it on a hoagie roll with some of the "juice" to dip, but my husband broiled it with some sliced provolone, and claimed it awesome that way as well. Thanks for the recipe.

This was REALLY easy and very good.  An instant hit.  I added about 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes and a roasted poblano pepper I happened to have left over from fajitas.  It was great.  Thanks.

This was SO good. Perfectly seasoned and delicious! I used beef broth instead of water, and didn't have any onion salt, so I left that out. I cooked on high for 2 hours, then on low for about 7...I shredded the meat and let it soak in the juices for about 3 hours before serving. Even though I only had a 2.5 lb roast, I kept the seasonings the same. This was awesome served on homemade French Rolls. Next time I'll serve with peppers and melted cheese. Thank you!

I followed this recipe exactly as listed and it turned out great. I used a 5 1/2 lb roast. It turned out very tender. One thing to remember with these Italian Beefs - the meat will be shredded not sliced. I believe sliced is the traditional way beef sandwiches are done. After the meat was done I shredded it right in the crock pot. Keep all the juices. This is where the flavor is! We ate our beef on french rolls that were buttered with butter and garlic. After the meat is on the roll we top with moz. cheese or prov. cheese and put under the broiler for the cheese to melt and toast. Add some giardinera for an extra kick.

I am not sure that the cut of meat listed for this recipe was the correct one.  I followed the instructions exactly however, the roast never tenderized and turned into a hard brick.  this was an expensive cut of meat that we had to throw away.  smelled great, but maybe a different roast needed to be used.

This turned out great!! Tastes just like the Italian Beef I had in Chicago. I used a 3 pound roast, but left all of the spice amounts the same. I didn't have onion salt, so subbed it with 3/4 tsp. onion powder and 1.5 tbsp. dried minced onion. Also added three beef bouillon cubes, 2 tbsp. jarred minced garlic and doubled the italian dressing mix. Nothing ever tastes quite right in my slow cooker, so I cooked this in my cast iron dutch oven at 350 for 90 minutes. Pretty easy, even for a weeknight meal!

Awesome recipe! Only made a few changes based on other reviews... 1. Used beef broth instead of water 2. Omitted the salt and used 2 pkgs of italian seasoning, along with other seasonings 3. Shredded meat the last hour and put back into the juice with banana peppers.  Rave reviews from family, thanks!!

Excellent recipe. I used 3 cups beef broth and 2 packages of seasoning with a 4 lb roast. I also minced onion in place of onion powder. I cooked on low for 8 hours. It was wonderful.

Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful!! I made this for family visiting out of state and everyone raved. I used 2 Italian seasoning packets but will use 3 next time. I also added the juice from the jar of pepperoncini jar. I added about 1/2 a jar of the pepperoncini's and then kept the jar available for those who wanted to add more to their sandwich. My mother doesn't like spicy food but she loved this. All the rest of us added more pepperoncini's and the beef was gone in one sitting for 4 people. I made homemade rolls and they complemented this meal wonderfully!

This is very good. One of our favorites!!!I do use Beef Broth instead of water, I think it gives it more flavor. We will make this often. Wouldn't change a thing. We put  shredded beef on hoagie rolls & then dipped into juice.

I've made this before, but have never reviewed it. We both think this is great. I use reduced sodium beef broth, onion powder instead of onion salt, and 2 pkgs of salad dressing. I put pickled jalapenos on mine for a sweet and hjot kick. Yum!

We enjoyed this very much.  Per suggestions, I added and extra packet of dressing mix and used 2 cups broth and one cup water.  Broiled open faced for a minute or two with provolone.  I didn't have onion salt but cooked with about half an onion, cut into chunks.  

Very tasty.

This Saturday will be the third time I've made this recipe for a party.  It's absolutely easy and tastes great and our friends really like it.  I use organic beef broth instead of water and serve it on Amoroso rolls (the gold standard for hoagie rolls in the Philly area) with provolone and it's awesome.  What I like the best is when there's some left over!

Awesome and easy. I use two packets of Kraft Italian Salad Dressing seasoning and a 1 cup or so of extra water. You need no beef broth. Thats just full of bad stuff anyway (MSG). The packets dont have anything bad and just follow the other ingrediants like they are. Instead of onion salt i just use some onions either fresh or dehydrated. My friends and family go crazy over this. Makes me feel like Im the bomb.

Amazing!! I put a 1lb roast (just me and my husband) in the crockpot around 7am with 2 cups beef broth, 1 cup water, and 1 packet of the italian dressing, salt n pepper. Cooked on low for 10 hours and the roast was sooo tender, falling apart basically! Put on french bread with provolone and those spicy mixed peppers, jardinara or something like that! Im making this all the time plus you'll have leftovers for the next couple days!

Be sure to read the reviews on this one before you make it.  As suggested in many reviews, I used a chuck roast, beef broth instead of water and I doubled the amount of salad dressing.  I shredded it in the crock pot and left it on an additional 1/2 hour to soak in the juices.  I assembled the meat and cheese on sub rolls and put them in the oven for about 10 minutes to crisp the bread and melt the cheese.  My son and his friends loved them!  Next time I will be sure to have mushrooms and onions to add on top!

This is a fantastic and easy slow cooker recipe.  I followed some other suggestions and used 1 can of beef broth .  We really enoyed this one!  We made a sandwich topping bar to go along with this.  Each of us topped our sandwiches with something different!  It was very good with crumbled blue cheese.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made this recipe several times now and we enjoy it each time. I use yak meat because cow meat is not readily available where I live. All the spices really overcome the more "game" flavor and smell of the yak. I usually half the meat and spices and add a whole pack of dressing mix like other reviews suggested. We still get about 10 hamburger bun sized sandwiches out of that! Top with a little cheese and some sauteed onions...Great!

I was excited to try this after reading  the reviews but it didn't turn out nearly as good as I thought it would. My meat came out dry and I even returned the shredded beef to the crock pot for another 2 hours. Not sure what happened here. 
I have to say, it did taste better the next day (I left the juices in and put in the fridge) but still not what I was hoping for.

Good, but will try making it with rump roast or maybe an eye of round next time. I followed the advice of another reviewer and used chuck roast. Too greasy, in my opinion, but still very tasty on homemade bread with melted swiss cheese.

So easy and so good. I made my own Italian dressing mix packet and used a chuck roast. I also added some sliced banana pepper rings. I will make these sandwiches again and again. I served them with BLT macaroni salad from this site and corn on the cob. What an easy way to entertain at our lakehouse.

This recipe was wonderful!  The only change I made was using beef stock instead of water.  Its my BF's new favorite sandwich.  We used the sauce for dipping and all we can say is YUM!  I will definitely be making it again.

I don't have too much to say about this recipe except, I just didn't like it.  I was so disappointed after all the great reviews.  I ate what was on my plate but I would not make it again.  My bf, who loves everything I cook, didn't care for it either.

This was wonderful!  I used 2 packets of italian seasoning as some recommended but probably should have omitted the salt then.  It was very salty but I rinsed the meat afterward and it was great!  I added provolone, onions, and banana peppers as toppings, delicious!

I read many of the reviews and made some modifications, like double the Italian seasoning, and using beef broth instead of water. I also used a bottom round roast because it was on sale at the grocery store and it's lower in fat. I was afraid this cut of meat would turn out dry and leathery because it has relatively less fat than other cuts, but it was just the opposite. It was juicy and moist, and it shredded beautifully. Don't forget to put the juice on your roll--it's well worth it! The flavor was great, and very authentic! My husband, who's a pretty picky eater, told me this needed a place in the "rotation" of recipes! Success!

This is great!  I agree with the reviewers who suggest beef broth instead of water.  If you're watching your sodium intake or don't like things as salty, I wouldn't recommend adding the extra Italian dressing.  It's wonderful the way it is.

This beef rocks! I doubled the seasoning packet, as suggested in other reviews, and it was out of this world - smothered in red roasted peppers and pepperoncinis and covered with provolone - this tastes just like my Sicilian mama used to make us. Yum!

Really tasty! My husband, who is from Chicago, knows his beef sandwiches smothered in peppers. I made this for him since he misses his favorite beef sandwich joint in Chicago. He was speechless and said, "this is just like home"! He loved them. I used a chuck roast, shredded the meat when it was done and served on toasted hoagie rolls smothered with roasted peppers and melted provolone. He took one to his dad the next day, who is also a Chicagoian, and he was in heaven. Thanks for making my husband and my father in law's day!

Amazing! Used a 2.5 pound chuck roast with all the spices & seasonings suggested for a 5 pound roast, along with 2 cans of beef broth in place of the water. Cooked it on low for 10 hours, shredded the beef & returned it to the crock pot with some sliced red onion and bell pepper for an additional 2 hours. Piled the meat (and veggies) into a split hoagie roll, topped it with provolone and stuck it under the broiler for a minute to melt the cheese. As I said, amazing!

This was good, but I expected a little more flavor. I made it without reading the reviews, next time I will use beef broth and up the amounts of the seasonings.

This recipe was delicious. I took the advice of the poster on top. (Thank you so much for compiling all of the best advice into your review!) I used a 2.5 lb chuck roast and cooked it with all of the seasonings for a 5 lb roast + I added an extra italian dressing packet. My family is big on flavor! I cooked for 7 hrs and then removed the meat to "shred". It practically fell into shreds. There was minor work involved in picking out the fat. I too returned the meat to the juice and then served on crusty rolls with a side of potato salad. The next day I reheated the left overs and they were even BETTER stuffed into flour tortillas with cheddar cheese. The flavor lends itself well to mexican dishes also! Thanks for the recipe. Will definitely make it again!

Excellent!  Served on Toasted Rolls melted provolone and Sauteeed onions.  I was sure to return the shredded beef back into the crock pot and mix in with the remaining stock for flavor and moisture!   This one has become favorite around our house!

I can't say enough good things about this recipe!  I used a 7 lb. chuck roast for a family gathering of 10 (and some small kids, too), and there is NONE left.  Everyone raved about how great this tasted.  I took the advice to use beef broth instead of water, and doubled the seasoning for a 7 lb. roast.  I also cooked for 11 hours on low, and then shredded the beef and cooked for another 2 hours.  It was tender and delicious.  Will make this time and time again!

like other reviewers, used beef broth and doubled the italian dressing packets.  This was a huge hit for a large family dinner!  Made it again for our superbowl party and everyone loved it!  Also served with jarred red and green pepper slices.  I used 2 roasts for the party and there was none left over.  Thanks for this recipe!

Great flavor.  Reminded L of Quizno's prime rib sandwich.  We served the sandwiches with mayo, onion, and mozz. and toasted them under the broiler.  Definitely a remake.

Everyone I fed this to, asked for the recipe.  I used 6.5lbs. top sirloin roast(it was on sale)and cut it into 3 even pieces.  I omitted the salt, used 2 cans of beef broth, 2 it. seasoning packets, and 1.5 of all other spices.(powders, instead of salts) After 10.5 hours on low, it was so tender that I couldn't pick up a whole piece on a large fork.  Great!

Good stuff.  Not the best, but well on the way.  I used beef broth instead of water and added 8-10 ounce jar of Giardiniera.  Will definately make again until I find a better recipe.

I'll rate this based on my husband's opinion since I know nothing about Italian beef.  He thought it was the best he had ever had.  I took some reviewer suggestions and used 2 packets of italian dressing mix, beef broth instead of water and a chuck roast (only 2.5 pounds but same amount of spices).  Very good

Oh wow! This has got to be one of the best crockpot recipes I have ever made! And I have made a lot! If you are considering making this, you really should. It was fantastic! My changes: Used about 10 oz of dry Italian mix, used 3 cups of beef broth, used a 3 pound chuck roast, after about 8 hours of cooking on low, I shredded the meat then let it simmer on warm for another hour. Put on toasted rolls with provolone cheese. It was phenomenal! My meat was pretty fatty, so while i shredded it, I pulled off the fat. Next time I'll try and separate the fat from the broth once I get the meat out of the pot (before shredding). It's so good, you don't even need the bread! You've got to try it!!

As is, I give this recipe 4 stars.  I made this with some slight changes and with them, can rate it a 5!  I used a 3 lb roast and used 2 cups of beef broth instead of water.  I also added some chopped onion for flavor.  I doubled up on the basil and oregano and added a dash of red pepper flake.  After shredding the beef, I added a tad bit more garlic and salt & pepper.  I did not use a bay leaf at all.  I served the beef on toasted hoagie buns with monterey jack cheese.  Delicious!

Needs more spice punch.  Try putting spices in after draining most of the juice and simmering for the last hour.

I made this because the reviews made it sound scrumptious.  I pretty much followed the recipe to the letter and was completely unimpressed when I served it that night.  My husband too, thought it pretty ho-hum.
The next night, HOWEVER, after 24 hours of refrigerator ripening...my whole family was (almost) fighting over it.  We couldn't get enough. The meat is flavorful and very tender.  You could do almost nothing to it...plain meat on bread, and it would still be very tasty.
Keeping this recipe.  Makes a lot so it'd be perfect to make one day and serve to a crowd the next, just by reheating.

A good sandwich but I felt it needed something extra.  Followed the recipe to a T.  We didn't find it salty as other reviews were noted.  The meat was tender.

I was very impressed with this recipe. I'm from Chicago livin in the burbs and I must say this rocks!!! Very close to the flavor of a well known Beef joint. The flavors really melt in your mouth. I followed this recipe as is, the only chamge I made was adding a little hot gardinera for a little kick. VERY GOOD!!!

I'm so glad I read the reviews before I made this. I doubled the spices, used 2 parts beef broth one part water (didn't have enough broth on hand) and returned the meat to the juice for about the last half hour. I also added green peppers and let them cook till soft. Its soo much better with the green peppers.
It was so delicious, so flavorful! I will definitely make this again and again! Thumbs up!

Delicious and so easy! I took the advice of some other reviewers and made the following substitutions:

used beef broth instead of water; 
used onion powder instead of onion salt; used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.

Used a 2.5 lb roast and a full packet of Italian dressing mix.

Leftovers made a hearty soup - added vegetable broth, Italian-style stewed tomatoes, fresh vegetables and barley. Family loved it.

This was pretty good, though I did change some of the ingredients a bit.  I took another reviewer's advice and used beef broth instead of water and added green peppers during the last hour.  I also used fresh garlic and onion in place of powder.  There seemed to be a little too much black pepper for my taste.  I grew up in Chicago and love Italian beef, and this is nothing like what I am used to.  That being said, this was still a good sandwich and easy to make, though I think I'll cut down on the pepper a little next time.

Tastes almost like the beef you can get in Chicago. The best way to serve it is on a hard crust bread like an Italian but soak the juices into the bread to help soften it up a bit before serving. Next time I'm going to add sweet peppers at the beginning to add more of a kick to it.

I originally made this for my son because I'm not a big fan of italian beef, but I ended up loving it.  I followed some of the suggestions such as doubling the italian dressing mix, using beef broth instead of water, omitting the salt, and using onion powder instead of onion salt.  Also, I used 3lbs of chuck roast.  I didn't change anything else.  It was slightly on the salty side so I made it again using only one package of italian mix but then it wasn't flavorful enough.  I'll have to make some tweaks to get it just right, but, overall, this is a great italian beef recipe.

A really great beef recipe. I did substitute beef broth for the water, and then omitted all of the salts (subbing with garlic and onion powder) - using salts in addition to the salty broth substitute probably does make it quite salty, but without I had no problems. I also used the rump roast as specified, cooked for 12+ hours on low, and while it was about as tender as this cut gets chuck would yield a more tender dinner. I like how lean trimmed rump roasts are, so personally I will make it with rump anyways. Thanks very much for sharing :)

I followed some of the advice in the summary of advice review. The house smelled wonderful and the flavor was great. The only change I recommend is to omit the salt and substitute the onion salt with onion powder. It just seemed a bit salty to me. Other than than, we will be making this recipe again.

Thank you Maureen! This meal was way beyond my expectations! My teenage stepson, who thinks the world revolves around pizza and hamburgers, came into my room after eating this and thanked me. With a thumbs up, he said "That was a 5 star"! It was a monumental moment!

SALTY! SALTY! SALTY! I followed the advice of momsavedbygrace, who usually has great tips (thanks) but this time, for me it turned out so salty that my husband and I tossed out the leftovers. I   followed the recipe exactly, per the changes in the above-mentioned review; even used a bigger roast -- about 2.88 pounds. I added the two dressing packages as she suggested. I don't even think omitting the extra salt the recipe calls for would have made the difference here. I may try this again, but with 1 and a half packets of the dressing, increase other spices individually, omit the salt altogether and use a 5lb roast as the recipe suggests. I recommend adding peppers and mushrooms too; this just lacked something -- not salt though!

This is a good base recipe.  I added pepper rings and more Italian dressing (less liquid)  We all loved this served in a good crusty  hard roll loaded with melted provolone. I am keeping this!!!  thank you so much for sharing this delicious, easy recipe.

This makes the best sandwiches ever!  We add provolone on a crusty roll and go crazy.  My husband has declared this his favorite recipe ever.  I even converted a non-roast person with the sandwiches.  Thanks for this great Sunday dinner!

Wow, this was really tasty!!  I would highly recommend this recipe.  These are the changes I made based on others' suggestions: 1)use beef broth in place of water  2) I used a 2+ lb chuck roast with 2 seasoning packets and 1 tsp of everything else 3) shred the beef and let sit back in the juices for the last 1/2 hour. 4) serve on rolls with provolone cheese!  With these changes it turned out really good!!!

My husband loves this recipe.  I served it at our Superbowl party with roasted red peppers, onions & sweet pepper relish as toppers & it was a big hit.  Everyone loved it & it was something different from the standard chicken wing & chili fare.

Outstanding - a real crowd pleaser.  I toast the buns a few minutes in the broiler and you feel like you are in a great restaurant.  Thanks!

Made this for the Super Bowl and even though our team didn't win this recipe did.  Everyone raved!! I placed a sliced green pepper in the slow cooker one hour before serving ( as another reviewer had suggested)  pulled it out and sliced it for those who wanted pepppers. Turned out great! Will make this again. Thanks.

Huh???!  Where's the flavor?? I used broth & 2 packets of dressing mix (which isn't cheap) and was expecting my house to be filled with a wonderful aroma when I came home from work.  I could barely smell it.  Yes, the meat is tender, but I was expecting more.  The flavors didn't translate into the meat.  sorry . . . I'll look for another recipe.  Now, what to do with all that liquid?  Maybe adding some veggies to it will give it more flavor for a soup for tomorrow.  Oh and yes, more seasoning of some sort.

Umm. This was okay. I don't know what "Italian Beef" is supposed to taste like but this is not what I was expecting. Not really much flavor, and I used 2 packets of seasoning and everything else as author had written. Only a 3 pound roast too. I was expecting it to taste more like Italian dressing, but it tasted more like slightly seasoned beef. Cooked overnight for 12 hours and was very, very, very tender by the time I shredded it (about 10 hours in). 
I have had this in my list for a long time, really wanting to make it, but now that I have, I wouldn't make again.

Hubby said "you can make this every night!"  Followed the recipe with the exception of the bay leaf (didn't have any)and used 2 packets of Italian salad dressing mix.  Also used Chuck roast. Great taste.  Will make again!

This is one of the best recipes I have ever found!  I would definitly use two packages of italian dressing mix.  I put onions and mozzerella cheese on mine and put it in the broiler for a couple of minutes.  The flavor was amazing! Thanks for a terrific recipe!

This recipe is delicious.  I have made it several times for many different people.  Everyone loves it.  I prefer 2 packets of the italian salad dressing and beef broth in place of the water.  I serve it on french rolls that we have sliced, buttered and broiled for a few minutes.  I also add sauteed onions and mozzarella cheese.

This was very good.  I made my own italian dressing mix (Found at this site).  That allowed me to reduce the amount of salt based on other members' feedback.  I am glad I did, because it was still a little salty.UPDATE - - I made this again using packaged Italian Dressing.  I doubled all the spices except the dressing and left out the salt.  I used 3 cups H2O and added a large beef bouilion cube.  I also added 1/4 c pepperoncini juice. YUM!

I made this on Christmas Eve and received spectacular reviews!  I used 2 pkgs. of Good Seasons Italian Dressing Dry Mix, a bottle of beer, and 1 cup of water, and then added the spices listed in the recipe. So easy and so good.  This is a new Christmas Eve tradition at my house!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I'm so glad I found this recipe!  My mom used to make it all the time when I was younger & I loved it!  I made it for a group of about 6-8 people & the whole thing got devoured!  The juices were perfect for dipping the sandwiches in... very good meal :)

I don't know what I did wrong with this one. I got a chuck roast which everyone suggested & I cooked it on high for 4 hours. I guess I should have woken up really early & cooked it on low for 10 hours. I used broth instead of water & 2 pkgs of dressing mix per reviews, & no onion salt. My husband had a fit when he tried to shred it, it was tough so it took a long time. After it was shredded we put it back in the crockpot for half an hour to soak in the broth. It was good on rolls with mozzarella & roasted red peppers, I put it under the broiler  to melt the cheese. One thing that grossed me out, was that I trimmed the fat off the meat very well before making it. After being in the fridge the next day there were little hard pieces of fat all over the meat. I guess you have to buy a roast with no fat at all. I might try this again but cook it on low for 10-12 hours, I wouldn't recommend doing it on high. Thanks.

This had a nice flavour, but we thought it was far too salty.  This was after halving the amount of salt, using onion powder instead of onion salt and using only one package of dressing mix rather than the two suggested by many reviewers.  We thought that the flavour was good enough to experiment with, perhaps by cutting out the salt entirely, but as is, it is much too salty for our tastes.

This was super easy and yummy!  I used chuck roast instead of rump roast because it looked better - other than that I didn't change a thing.  The meet was so tender - it literally fell apart trying to get it out of the crockpot to shred it.  My family loved it and have asked me to make it again next week.  We ate it on soft hoagies with sauteed onions and bell peppers and provolone cheese.  This is an easy, hearty meal - give it a try!

Very good!! I needed something to help with a busy week, and this seemed like the ticket...the beef flavor (and smell!) is outstanding, and my husband and kids all are really appreciating it. I made a few changes - used 2 cans of beef broth (low sodium) and 2 pkgs of Zesty Italian as others recommended. Left out the salt and used onion powder instead of onion salt. Left out the parsley and bay leaf. It was still a little salty and the liquid had cooked down a lot (I cooked it 5 hrs on high, 5 hrs on low, shredded the beef, then 45 min on warm), so I will add a cup of water next time. Served on Portuguese rolls - will probably do a heartier roll next time. A keeper - it's gone into "Mom's Cookbook" where only the great ones go.

Absolutely the BEST Italian Beef EVER!!  I used 5 lb top round, 1 can beef broth, 2 cups water, 2 pkgs dry italian dressing mix and all the other seasonings as listed.  After 5 hours on high, I shred the roast, added one 16 oz jar of mild gardienera and turned down to low for one additional hour -- To Die For!!  Also served on baked garlic bread rolls with melted mozzarella cheese. No more restaurant Italian Beefs for us -- these are better.

This is yummy.  The only thing I do differently is add a few forkfuls of jalapeno slices (from a jar) and a couple of beef bouillon cubes.  I also use one thinly sliced onion instead of the onion salt.  I shred the beef and then make sure it has plenty of time to sit in the slowcooker so the flavors can soak in.  I serve this with Brownberry Sandwich buns and provolone cheese.  Very good!

Used broth instead of water, no bay leaf we don't like the flavor of.  Onion flakes instead of onion salt. Used one packet of seasoning mix.   Warmed olive oil in a pan with two heads of garlic, brushed hoagie rolls with infused oil and garlic, broiled until just lightly browned. Added beef, topped with mozzerella cheese.  Just to good.  Remember add ingredients that you like.  Thanks for the post.

Unfortunately, just because something is liked by most people, does not mean that it is to everyone's taste. We didn't especially like this; we both thought it was "only okay". Although it smelled appetizing, it was pretty bland. I added a lot of extra seasonings (except salt!) after tasting it at the shredding point, to give it some flavour, then I let it continue to cook in the juice. Even the further addition of cheese and sauted onions & peppers to the sandwich itself did not redeem the beef.

Like the other reviewers, I substituted beef broth for the water.  I would give this recipe a "5" for being easy. How can you beat 1 teaspoon of everything?  It gets a "4" for flavor because some members of my family found it so-so.

YUM!!  We loved this recipe.  Per other reviews I used beef broth instead of water.  I also omitted the bay leaf as I didn't have any.  I used a 2 1/2 pound eye round roast with the same amount of liquid which was fine.  I used hoagie rolls and topped beef with roasted red peppers and sauteed mushrooms & onions.  Then I topped it off with provolone cheese and stuck under the broiler until the cheese was melted.  Can't wait for the leftovers.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used beef broth, like other reviewers suggested.  I was hoping that it would have a little more flavor. Next time we make it, I will probably add an extra package of Italian seasoning like other suggested.  We served ours on rolls with Swiss cheese and carmalized onions, and used some of the extra juice to dip our sandwiches into.  Delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is the BEST italian beef recipe I have found. I have great success using a bottom round roast. The only things I do differently are very basic. I use "zesty" italian dressing mix and, since they cook all day anyway, I don't see the need to preboil the water, herbs & spices. I just mix all of them together in a bowl, pour it over the beef in the slow cooker and turn it on.  Tastes great!

Wonderful!  Serve this on hard rolls with swiss cheese and spicy mustard.  We used the juice to dip the sandwiches in and served them with home made butter sour cream mashed potatoes and resh green beans sauted in olive oil and garlic.  Wonderful!  Will make over and over again!

I made this early in the summer for a change (I usually do the BBQ sauce thing for beef/pork sandwiches), and I'm glad I tried it! An excellent way to prepare meat for a simple and yummy (and maybe not-so-elegant) dinner. Add some salad and/or fries, you're set! My husband loved the change, too. I used a 2½ pound roast (I don't remember what cut, but it was the cheapest cut I could find) and cut the seasonings back to half (except the dressing mix, I put the entire package in). I also cut back a little more on the pepper and salt as I don't like too much pepper and there's so much salt in the dressing plus onion salt... Excellent! Thanks for the recipe!

This was outstanding!  After reading the reviews, I decided to go with others and used 2 packets of salad dressing mix and beef broth in place of the water.  I used a 3lb chuck roast and it was about as tender as it could get.  Great recipe!!

I made the changes already mentioned:  substituing beef broth for water, doubling the salad dressing mix and using a chuck roast (5 lb.).  I cooked it in my slow cooker for 9.5 hours, shredded it and let it simmer for another half hour.  It was awesome!  Another great recipe for a party.  Thanks!!!

I got raves over this recipe and will definitely make again soon.  I took the advice of many others and used 2 pkgs. of Italian seasoning and 2 cans of beef broth. My personal feeling was that it was a BIT too salty, so will probably adjust that somewhat next time, but absolutey no one complained. I did chop the meat and put it back in the slow cooker for flavor throughout. I cooked some bell pepper, onion and mushrooms in olive oil in the oven and topped sandwiches with that, provolone cheese and horseradish sauce. EXTRA GOOD! Thanks, Maureen - this is a keeper!

Being from Chicago, I was a little hesitant that these could be true Chicago Italian Beef sandwiches...but they are!!!  If anyone is from Chicago, these are very similar to Portillo's Italian Beef!  I didn't change the recipe a bit!!  Absolutely delicious the way it is and even better as leftovers!!!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I also used 2 packages of dressing mix and low sodium beef broth. I used 2 boneless chuck roasts (they were all very small at the store) and a whole onion chopped and also fresh garlic. We made sandwiches that I melted under the broiler with provolone. Served with green peppers and onions. I used the leftovers in burritos. They could also be used for taquitos as well. The chuck roast shreds better than a rump roast and is also much cheaper. The meat does smell terrific and the taste is even better. Thanks for such a great recipe.

This was really tasty!  I followed some of the other reviews and added a second package of Italian dressing, beef broth, and a dash of ground red pepper.  This meat had great flavor.  I will definitely make this again!

Oh My God! This recipe is amazing! I used a recipe from this site for the salad dressing mix and put twice the amount called for. I also used beef broth instead of water. It was great the first day, but even better the next day. I tried shredding 1/2 the beef, and thinly slicing the other half. Everyone in my family prefered the sliced meat better. I will DEFINATELY make this again!

One of my favorites for parties or send leftovers with my fiance to work.  Inexpensive and restaurant quality.  I use chuck roast instead of rump roast.  Also add your choice of peppers to the crockpot.  Or top with mozzarella cheese.

OK, I have to say this recipe was defienetly 5 star.  Just the smell alone- while it was cooking in the crock pot brout back so many memories for me.  I used to live in Chicago and I ate italian beefs all the time.  Now I live in FLorida and haven't found a good place where they serve this dish.  The only thing I didn't like was I sliced mine, but it wasn't as thin as it should be.  You also must serve with sweet peppers, as in green peppers and onions, would be also good with mottzarella cheese.  I like mine with gardinare- HOT and SPICY please!  OH Yeah one more thing.  Dip your bread in the juice- serve bread almost soggy, if you must use a knife and fork.  Now if someone can post a recipe for a tamale, I'll be in heaven.  Thanks Maureen

Love this recipe, it is so simple.  I purchase a chuck roast at my local wholesale store, stuff my crockpot and pour on the yummy ingredients.  The only thing I have done different is added 3 tsp of "Better Than Bouillon" beef base.  Also, a little red wine when I have it.  It is great both ways.

Great recipe.  We enjoyed it like a pot roast, rather than on sandwiches.  Used the liquid to make gravy.  Made no other changes.

This made very good sandwiches.  I used 2 packages of salad dressing. I tasted a piece of the meat before shredding, though, and realized that the outside was flavorful, but the inside meat lacked flavor.  So I shredded away, and took another reviewer's advice to cook the shredded meat for an additional hour.  This made all the difference.  Provolone or Swiss cheese melted on top of the sandwiches is a definite must.  By the way, it tasted even better the next day--my son loved it.

I have made this 2 times recently and plan to make it again for a Halloween bonfire this weekend.  It's delicious!
I cut back on the oregano, (not a big oregano fan), used beef broth in place of water, and topped roast with sliced onions while cooking. Very tasty!  Thanks!

I thought the recipe was a little bland at first and needed a bit of a kick.   Luckily, I had some pepperoncinis on hand and viola!  It was perfect then.  I'll definitely make this again and again, so long as I have the peppers!

I had to do a lot of work to make this into something. It was rather bland at first so I added two sliced onions, some green peppers and finally some sliced jalapenos because we didn't have any pepperconi. We had two sandwiches and the rest is sitting in the fridge and will probably be tossed.

This recipe was very yummy.  Everyone raved over it and wanted the recipe.  I also substituted beef broth for water and added an extra 1/2 cup water for more juice.  I cut the recipe in half but I still added the entire package of dry italian dressing mix and it wasn't too strong at all.  I melted a piece of provolone cheese over each sandwich and used the broth for dipping.  Will definitely be making this again.

This meat mixture is so flavorful and versatile. When I don't have crusty French bread rolls, I've piled this on top of mashed potatoes or baked potato. Top with some cheese, sour cream and sprinkle with chopped green onions. Like many who have rated this recipe, I substitued beef broth in place of the water. Try replacing 1/2 cup of the liquid with red wine as well. Great comfort food!!

Very good as written, but the salt and pepper were over overpowering to the other "italian" spices, for me. Due to reviews, 2nd time, I reduced pepper to 1/2 tsp, used onion POWDER (instead of onion salt),added 2 cups broth (I had on hand beef AND chicken) and 1 cup water to cover. Slow cooked a 3# (not 5#) sirloin flat roast for 12 hours then shredded right in the roaster)and added MORE dried spice (about 2 tsp. Italian) and let it set, on low, in juices for about 15 mnutes more. I liked the italian spice added near the end for a fresher flavor. With the smaller roast, I had about 2 cups of yummy broth left over for dipping. Thank you Maureen, for a great recipe that we just changed a little for our tastes.

This was sooo good.  I normally don't cook red meat so I was a little afraid but it turned out perfect my fiancee and I had a feast with it.  I actually also put on top a sort of sandwich slaw.
Yummy I cannot say enough good things about this recipe.  Thank you!

I normally don't write reviews but I had to on this one.  EXCELLENT.  I love it.  It smells so good.  The broth is the best tasting stuff.  I use beef broth (two cans) instead of water and zesty italian mix (two packages).  Tonight I'm using this as roast recipe and we'll eat with baked potatos soaked in the broth.  YUM!

I have never bothered to write a review but I have to say this one is good...really GOOD!! I did a couple of things different.  I used one can of condensed beef broth and two cans of water..instead of the 3 cups of water suggested. I used one packet of Italian dressing Plus one packet of zesty Italian dressing mix.  I also added about 3 tablespoons of the dried onions from a package of Lipton onion soup mix(just the onions not the powder).I used a not so good roast and was concerned because after 5 hours of cooking it was very tough...but went back to work and came home and it was Fabulous...yum yum...its a must try!!!

I've made this twice now and it's a complete winner!  I threw in fresh pepperocinis from the garden in the beginning and just let them cook with the meat.  I made it for my boyfriend's birthday and his family at over 10 lbs. of it (even the kids loved it!)

I too used to live in Chicago and would get Italian beef sandwiches constantly.  I had no clue that other areas of the country didn't have these things!  Seeing as so many others from the area rated this highly, I thought I'd give it a chance.  The first time I made it, it was okay, but not quite what I expected.  The juices were exactly what I remembered, which gave me hope.  My husband and children loved it though.  So the next time I made it, when the roast was tender enough, I shredded it, then let it simmer some more.  This time, it was just right!  I sliced up a green pepper and cooked it in a pan with the juices to put on the sandwiches.  This is now a staple recipe in our house.  Now if I can only figure out how to make it with sliced beef...

Easy & delicious. I grilled french bread to put the beef on and used provolone cheese.  We used some of the juice to dip the sandwich into. I like this recipe better than the other Italian Beef recipe I was using from "All Recipes". It is very hard not to overeat when serving this. I also tried a bite with blue cheese dressing on it & that was tasty too.

Excellent at-home recipe for Chicago style Italian Beef.  Eat it on an italian roll with sweet or hot peppers and dip the sandwich in the juice so it's nice and moist - just the way we like it!

Yum Yum Yum!  Throw it in the crockpot, forget about it, and have a fabulous meal at dinner.  My favorite kind of recipe!  I usually replace the water with beef broth, and also add sliced pepperoncini to the crockpot to give it an extra kick.

I omitted the salt, used onion powder vs. onion salt, and added 1 can beef broth in place of some of the water.  I roasted this in the oven at 350 degrees for about 3-4 hours.  It is very tasty, but I had to add more liquid since some of it evaporated in the cooking process.

This was the best slow cooker beef recipe I've ever made.  My husband and I enjoyed eating it for 3 nights in a row.  I left out the bay leaf (don't like the flavor) and parsley (didn't have any) and added 1 can of beef broth in place of one cup of water.  It came of full of flavor and very tender.  We shredded it and ate it on steak rolls with pepper jack cheese.  Will definately be making this again!

This was pretty good. I had my family over for labor day and made a feast, this was part of it and everyone loved it. I made Tasty Rolls and had this shredded beef on it with provolone cheese, lettuce, and creamy italian salad dressing. It was good! Served with lots of other great stuff!

round steak or sirloin works best. rump roast soaks up all the juice. or make double the water and spices and leave the meat the lbs called for in the recipe

This is great!!  I also used this recipe to make barbeque.  I pull the meat apart once it has cooked and add barbeque sauce to it.  My family loves it both ways!  You should try this!!!!

I made this and it came out so perfect! Being from Chicago myself Italian beef sandwiches are one of favorites. This might not be a perfect duplicate of Chicago's best beef sandwich but it comes extremely close! Thank you!!!!

Absolutely delicious!! I followed the changes suggested & had to give it 5 stars. The suggested changes: add beef broth to water,  doubled the Italian dressing package, chuck roast instead of rump roast, doubled seasonings, & added Italian peppers at the end. One reviewer said, the wetter the better & I found that to be true!! That was my first time intentionally making a wet sandwich & I loved it- the juice was everything! Make sure to use thick hoagie bread!

I'm not a fan of roast beef in general and this is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! I followed the recommendation of the reviewer who suggested using beef broth instead of water, doubling the Italian seasoning, and shredding the beef at hour 8 then returning to crockpot to cook for remaining time. Quality rolls, roasted red pepper, picante provolone cheese, and horseradish sauce made this amazing!

Next time use two dressing packets, and maybe throw in some banana peppers the lady hour (as the shredded beef sits in the broth).

Have made this a number of times. Based on the other reviews I use chuck roast. Beef stock, two packages of good seasons Italian dressing mix. I cook for 8 hrs on low then shred and put back in for another hour or two to completely get immersed in the liquid. I like adding sauted mushrooms and onions and provolone cheese to the sandwich and broiling for 30 seconds or so. YUM!

So over the weekend, I decided to buy a London Broil, only because it was buy one get one at the store. I never cooked w/this cut of meat, before, & didn't know that it's a pretty dry, tough meat when prepared. Tried making a pot roast the other day w/one & it was just very underwhelming, to say the least. Swore I would never buy this cut of meat, again. Still, I had this leftover one that I had to figure out a solution for, really didn't want to freeze it but didn't want to chuck it out, either. 

Stumbled on this recipe during my search, decided I'd experiment w/it & have another meal ready to make as a backup, in the event that it turned out like my sad dry pot roast.

The London Broil was ~2.5lbs but I still used the same ingredients & amounts, which I'm happy I did as I don't feel like there would've been enough juice if I halved it all. Only other difference was that I used Beef Stock in place of water & used 2 packets of Italian Seasoning, as suggested by others. 

The house smelled absolutely divine while it was cooking. At the 10 hour mark I checked on it & it was falling apart. I shred the meat up, sauteed 2 green peppers on the stovetop, then returned it all back into the liquid to cook for an add'l 2 hours. Served on hard rolls w/melted Provolone & I made sure to wet each roll. 

Chicago born & raised, so I've had my fair share of Italian Beef & have to say this was absolutely delicious & deserves more than 5 stars!! Will be making again, for sure! Tysm!

I was raised in Chicago and know a good Italian beef "sangwich" when I taste one! I used 2 (14.5 ounce) cans of beef broth in place of water. Also drained the juice from a 12 ounce jar of pepper rings and added the juice to the saucepan, along with a packet of Au Jus mix. I din't need to add salt. Those were the only changes I made, other than using an 5 pound Eye of the Round roast trimmed of fat. Cooked on low 9 hours, and while the meat shredded easily and flavor was excellent, it was still a bit tough.  Next time I think I'll cut the roast into large chunks  instead of cooking it in 1 piece, to see if it cooks better. Thanks for the recipe!

This makes a great Italian beef. 
The next time I make I will cut the amount of pepper by half and use beef broth instead of water. Those are personal and family preferences.

I made this last night. Followed recipe except I used beef broth instead of water.  I used a beef shoulder roast.... perhaps I shouldn't have, as the meat was rather stringy and not tender.  The flavor was excellent, and I will definitely make it again with either a chuck roast or rump roast.

I used 2 packets of Italian dressing mix. I shredded and put the meat back in to soak up the juices 2 hours before it is ready. I served with a lot of toppings like fried onions, tri-colored fried peppers, fried mushrooms and provolone cheese on some good crusty rolls.

This was a hit at a recent party but I did make some changes that just made sense to me.  I used a Chuck Roast instead of the Butt roast which just fell apart nicely after cooking. I used beef broth instead of water and will only use 2 cups next time as there was a lot of unnecessary juice. I diced a large onion instead of the onion powder which just made sense and for people who say they don't like onion they will not see them at all in the finished product. I also used minced garlic instead of the garlic powder. Lastly is used two packets of the Italian Seasoning mix to give it extra flavor. The meat was nice and moist after letting it cook the last two hours after shredding and putting it back in. Very flavorful by itself but people loved topping it off with a pepper and onion mixture I fried up in a skillet with some of the broth from the crock pot.

Very good and very easy.  Definately use beef broth instead of water.  We cooked ours over 2 days and it was perfect.

Sooo good. I will double the spice next time. We topped it with provolone and sautéed onions and peppers. Best birthday dinner I’ve ever made for my husband! I served it on fresh homemade rolls. Mmmm....good

It was just like the reviews said, delicious. Everyone raved about it. I did add two packets of dry dressing- it found it salty but I was the only one. Added some peperoncini juice and peppers. We had a gang and I made two different slow cooker beefs, this was by far the favourite.

This was good, but not like anything I have had in Chicago. I need to stop comparing recipes to Chicago. :-( I would maybe sear the roast before putting it in the crock pot, and cutting down on the herbs? It was not horrible, but not great. Thanks for sharing it though.

Used beef broth instead of water, onion powder instead of onion salt, and chuck roast instead of rump roast.  It is the best we have tried.

Awesome!!! So flavorful! I followed the recipe for a 3 1/2 pound rump roast - I substituted beef broth for the water and used 2 packets of the dressing mix. I had a rough time shredding the rump roast after 10 hours slow cooking it on low so next time I will use a chuck roast as others have suggested. I served the beef on hoagie rolls with provolone cheese and peppers and onions- I will definitely be making this again!

I followed the instructions to the “T” even though I thought 1 tsp of salt and just the bit of salt the 1 tsp of onion salt seemed like way too little for 5 Lbs of beef, I thought maybe the Italian seasoning might add something to it, unfortunately it turned out pretty bland, I also thought 10 to 12 to cook and the last few on high seemed like a lot but since the reviews were so great I decided to just trust it. So since it really was pretty bland I had to add some salt and some Badia Complete seasoning but of course that helped the flavor but not the dryness of the meat itself, there was pretty of juice in which it cooked in but the meat texture was super dry. So I’m giving it two stars just in case I may have gotten a bad cut of meat which by the way was crazy expensive for just 5 Lbs ($30.00+)

Made it last night. Very good on crispy French bread. Followed changes from other reviewers and used 2 packages Italian dressing mix and beef broth. Didn’t add any salt as I was already concerned about the salt in this dish. However the finished product tasted great. I also used the chuck roast which did shred nicely but next time I’ll try a different roast and thinly slice it

This was VERY GOOD.  I made the following changes based on others reviews. I used three cups of beef broth and doubled the spices. I did use a rump roast (Aldi was out of chuck) and after 5 hours on high it fell apart. I shredded the meat and then let it sit in the juice for 1/2 hour. I sauteed red onion, red pepper and mushrooms. Piled the meat and veggie mix on a bun and covered it with a slice of provolone. Put it under the broiler for a couple of minutes to let the cheese melt. The only thing I am going to do differently is get a better bun. I just had hamburger rolls available and they weren't strong enough to hold everything. I am going to use the left overs in a stir fry later on this week.

My parents made Italian Beef that was similar.  If you want thinly sliced beef refrigerate the roast after cooking and take to a butcher shop.  Sometimes they will put the beef on a slicer and slice the roast for a nominal charge.

I liked it on bread but I decided to try to make shepherds pie with this as the meat. That is amazing!!  Make the Italian beef recipe, shred the beef and use most of the juice. Put veggies on that (I just use frozen) and make mashed potatoes to put on top. Put in oven till heated through. The greatest shepherds pie ever.

The meat was very tender. I did a chuck roast as recommended in the comments. The one thing is that I felt there was too much water and it diluted the seasonings. Next time I will do less water and double the seasonings. I couldn't taste them as it was.

Supper Bowl Sunday I made this and it was Awsome, better than the game. Everyone loved them, and the leftovers were even tastier. I used the recipe for the Italian Seasoning minus the salt. All in all I’ll never need to go tp Al’s or Portillos’s again for a great beef Sammy!!!

I am writing this as my family is fixing their seconds during football.   I did as other reviewers suggested— 3 cups beef broth, used onion and garlic powder and used the equivalent of two packets of dressing.  I used a semi-dried Italian herb blend from Whole Foods and added a bit of salt to it to come closer to a soup mix.   I cooked on low for 10 hours and shredded and then let it cook another hour before serving.  It had so much flavor ...it was absolutely incredible!!

I have made this a number of times for many years.  My picky family loves this recipe.  I do, however, cut the water back by at least 1/2 of what it calls for.   I use either 1 & 1/2 cups or 1 cup of water instead of adding extra  Italian seasoning packet.  I also use a 1/2 tsp of oregano instead of a full tsp.  As a role, you should use half the amount of oregano to basil for recipes.  This recipe is very easy to make.  It is very good on a crusty roll/bun!  I use a chuck roast also.  You can top it with roasted green pepper or relish and of course some provolone or mozzarella. Yum

We loved it.  I did make a 2 1/2lb rump roast but used the measurements for the 5 lb.  I shredded the meat after 8 hours and put back in juice for an hour on warm.  

I'm from Texas so I don't have the same Italian  Beef  Sandwich knowledge my husband does,  who's from CT.   He really loved it. For my first one I cooked, I scored an A+

A friend turned me on to this recipe pretty much as-is.  Seems to be a standard as far as I can tell, and oh man, there's a reason!  MOUTH WATERING!!!   I put mine on an open-faced hoagie roll (Martins Hoagie Rolls, my favs) .   I open it up all the way, spread mayo on it, put the shredded beef on it (making sure to cover all the bread so it won't get burnt) and then slapped a couple of slices of provolone on top.  Stuck it under the broiler for about 3 minutes or so and boom bap, baboom bap, THUNDERSTUCK!!!!

It couldn't be easier to make.  Plop it in the slow cooker, put the water and seasonings in, put the lid on, push the button,  find a way to kill a few hours, and then dig in!

As far as something to side it with, don't worry about it, you probably won't have room left for anything else.

Just wonderful! I am from Philadelphia and made this today before the Eagles game and my friends named it the "Philly Special". I broiled provolone on the bread and added red, green and banana peppers. I did cook for about 10 hours and used all beef broth instead of water. I also added 2 packets of Italian seasoning for 4 pounds of chuck roast. UNBELIEVABLE flavor! Will definitely stash this in my pocket of  deliciousness. This recipe is very mush appreciated!

Family loved it. Ended up slicing the beef instead of shredding. made great sandwiches. I did double the Italian seasonings as others suggested and used beef broth instead of water.

It lacked flavor. Since I his was the first time the only change was adding 2 sliced onions to the crock pot.  After it was finished it needed something. We tried more of the herbs nope. So we added another packet of Italian dressing.  That helped. Next time we will add some worshester also. 

After the fixes it was good.  It makes a LOT.

I didn’t care for the smell as the roast was cooking. I used a 2.5 lb chuck roast, since there are only two of us. But it was tender and “wet”-delicious., served on crusty rolls. I look forward to making it again!!

Substituted beef broth for water and used 2 packages of dressing mix. Added half a jar of pepperoncini peppers with juice after beef cooked for 7 hours. Cooked additional 2 hours.  The smell about drove me crazy all day. Served on huge rolls and topped with fried onions and pepppers, provolone cheese and horseradish. Grilled for 5 minutes and finally, taste delight. Yum!

I made this with a London Broil. I made burritos using sautéed peppers and onions plus shredded Mexican cheese  blend. Hot sauce of some type will put it over the top.

Worth the hours of waiting for the slow cooker to make the meat perfect.  Not too spicy after all the herbs I added.  Family enjoyed the sandwiches:  plain, with mustard, and with cheese, on Italian bread.  Some dipped in the juice, some did not.  Everybody is happy, and I am thinking this would be a good addition to the New Year's Day pot luck.

Skipped the bay leaf because I had it simmer on very low heat for five hours in a deep pan, not in an electric gadget. Afterwards, just sliced it when it cooled down a bit. Moist and tasty. Will do again.

Put chopped onion in. Used beef but a different type of roast as pot roast was expensive.  Was easy to put together.  Learned.  Review recipe and check your spice cabinet before you try to make it.  Found it difficult to get basil and onion salt at 4:00 am.

That is not a French Dip. That is Italian beef.  A French Dip is thinly sliced roast beef, piled on a grilled, buttered torpedo roll with NOTHING else. No cheese, no onions, no mushrooms. 
Served with a side of super beefy au jus and super crispy French fries. That’s what a French Dip is.

It was good but when I added 2 Tablespoons of pepperoncini juice and 6 pepperoncini is was better. I cooked it for 8 hrs. let it cool in the fridge overnight and shaved/sliced. I put the slices back into the crockpot for another 2 hrs min.

This is insanely good. Used beef broth and left out the salt. Added an onion and assortment of peppers in it. Didn’t have the Italian seasoning so made it homemade and doubled what is said to use. Highly praised by my honey who declared our other roast in the freezer was to be made like this. 2 enthusiastic thumbs up.

This was excellent!!  I used beef broth instead of water , 2 packets of the dry Italian dressing mix, and a packet of dry French onion soup packet.  Everything else was followed by recipe.  After shredding I added it back into the liquid and added hot banana peppers for the last hour of cooking.  It’s delicious!!

This is amazing.  So, not sure if I messed up the amount of liquid.  I took the roasts out, tasted the liquid and it tasted watered down. Also, I thought it needed some acidity.  So, I put in the juice from some banana peppers I was going to top this with.  Reduced liquid until crazy flavorful and put the beef back on to soak it all up. I can’t explain how good this recipe is.  Thank you for sharing!!

This will do. Changed it just a hair. Used Garlic pepper instead of regular pepper, left out the salt, and used onion powder instead of onion salt.  And I just buy some nice fresh roast beef from the deli already shaved or sliced. Not exactly perfect, but, settles this Chicago Girl's cravings just fine and it doesn't have to cook for hours, can make it quick right on the stove-top and eat right away. Oh, and I used  1 each chicken and beef bouillon cubes.

My family liked it, but one said it needed more spice, and the other said it needed less salt. I do think it turned out really well; it was incredibly tender and juicy.

Wowza! This is a new favorite! The only change I made was to add a jar of sliced up roasted red peppers to the slow cooker (including the liquid from the jar). I sauteed onions & mushrooms as options for toppings; this was a huge hit at our get together! Will definitely be making this again. And again.

I've only had the real thing once in Chicago, but I thought it sounded perfect for guys poker night - and I was right!  Followed recipe, except I cut my roast into 5 pieces and browned them each a bit in olive oil, before adding to the crock pot.  I always prefer beef that has been browned before the crock pot, and I was in a big hurry - only had 4 hours, so I figured this would speed up the cooking.  Just delicious - be sure to save the juice, bcs my Chicago friend told me they are best served "wet" with a pepperocini on top.  All of the guys raved about them.  A new favorite for our parties.

I’ve made this many times and everyone loves it. I use a chuck roast (cheaper) and I like to add some banana peppers and a splash of their juice. I put it in the slow cooker right before bedtime, shred the meat next morning so it can soak for a while, and it’s PERFECT for lunch. Delicious!!

So delicious!  We are from Chicago and love this recipe with some additions Added 1 1/2 orange/yellow sweet peppers cooked in garlic butter and oregano.  Added all this at the end.  Also buttered and toasted the french rolls.  Bread makes a huge difference!  Our new go to recipe.

Great recipe! Used beef broth instead of water, used 2 packages of Italian dressing, and used 6 lb chuck roast from Costco. After slow cooking on low for about 8 hours I shredded meat. Right before serving I drained the meat and saved the broth. Cooled the broth enough to pour fat off. Then put meat back in slow cooker to serve with about  1 cup of broth and served the rest of broth as au jus on the side. Served on crusty mini French rolls toasted with Provolone cheese. Fantastic!

I used the leftovers from a roast I had already cooked.   I added the ingredients that weren't already there, heated it all together on the stove top, toasted my sub rolls & created these delicious sandwiches!   My family LOVES them!    It's a great, new way to finish leftovers without getting sick of the same old thing.   I highly recommending giving this recipe a try!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I substituted beef stock instead of water, used 2 packages of Zesty Italian Salad Dressing mix instead of 1, got some beef fat (free) from the butcher and used about 1/4 pound. I put the beef fat in the pot first and cooked it until there was some liquid beef fat in the bottom of the pot. I used bottom round instead of a rump roast because there is more flavor with this type of cut. I added the beef after the fat cooked a little bit and then added all other ingredients. Slow cooked it, shredded the meat and put it back into the broth. Cooked until tender. A family favorite.

I used chuck roast as suggested and found that though it was very tasty it was extremely fatty. I had to pull chunks of fat and connective tissue off the roast while shredding. I think this should be made ahead of time and all juices drained and cooled in the fridge long enough so the fat can be skimmed off before adding the juices back to the shredded beef. That being said it was delicious served with peppers and onions and cheese melted over French rolls!

I really liked this.  The only change I made was I used beef broth instead of water.  I was very thirsty the next day so I can only assume this has a ton of sodium.  I don't think I will use beef broth next time unless it's my homemade broth.

Fabulous - like being back home on Chicago South Side! Substitutions, beef stock instead of water. 2t onion flakes instead of 1t onion salt. 2t dried minced garlic instead of 1t garlic powder.  Then, double all the spices (makes it 4 each of onion/garlic). Shred meat and return to juice at least an hour before serving. My picky eater friend had 4 helpings!

Highly recommend! To give it 5 stars, double all the seasonings except the salt (I do not add any salt). I cooked it in the oven at 275 degrees in a covered dutch oven for 10 hours. I served it with a choice of hamburger buns or whole wheat tortillas. Both were delicious! If you like extra spicy sandwiches, top your sandwich with Tuscan Garden's brand of "Giardiniera Hot" (a blend of hot peppers, celery, cauliflower and carrots in soybean oil). Enjoy!!

Wonderful recipe!  I did add 2 pkgs of Italian dressing, beef stock instead of water, poured some pepperoncini juice as well as pepperoncini in while cooking.  Added minced garlic as well as the garlic powder, sliced onion & if I have a red or green pepper throw that in as well.  I always use a chuck roast for great shredding and the taste!  My kids favorite (they are adults!)

Living outside of Chicago the flavors of this Italian beef are pretty spot on, problem is my wife has never had an Italian beef, she doesn't eat red meat. Not a problem. I use FROZEN CHICKEN(3lb bag) most of the time for this recipe. It is just as delicious as it would be with beef. I add 2/1-2 cups beef broth and 1 cup of water, in case u want it wet, and also the 2 packets of Italian seasoning. I always seem to add some more basil and oregano to taste. Follow the directions like you would and enjoy. I prefer chuck roast for this, but for all you people who do not eat red meat enjoy the flavors of an Italian beef, but call it Italian chicken.

First time making this recipe and let me say that the beef and gravy (ok.. au jus, for many of you) was spectacularly good! Meat so tender... gravy so flavorful! 
This is going on the Turkey Day menu!!

As far as using it for Italian Beef Sandwiches... eh.. well... the problem I had was more about texture than flavor. Being a Chicagoan... having eaten innumerable Italian Beefs in my long life... this "pulled beef" texture just doesn't work well. The beef is more a mash once you put it on the sandwich instead of the almost paper thin strips that it should be. 

I didn't think that would matter, but it does.. quite a bit.

But since I don't have a meat slicer and will certainly NOT be buying one.. this was a good effort but ultimately, disappointing as far as using it for IB sandwiches.

BUT I will certainly be using this recipe for cooking beef in the future!

I made two changes to the recipe.. I doubled the Italian dressing mixture (instead of buying it in packets, I used a recipe on this site to create it). And I added the equivalent of two bullion cubes using "Better than bullion-- Beef" (my fave beef and chicken bullion solution).

Doubling the Italian mix worked really well... but using that much bullion was frankly unnecessary. Next time I will use none or just one bullion.

This was really good! I will be making it again. It lasted us about two days and we only bought 3 lbs of meat and used two packets of the seasoning.

I made this with some of the suggestions in previous reviews, including using broth in lieu of the water and using two pakages of the salad dressing mix.  I also added slightly higher amounts of the spices and still found this to be bland.

The only changes I made were instead of using water I use one can of beef consomme and one can of french onion soup I also use two packages of Italian salad dressing. Perfect

I use beef broth instead of water and two Italian seasoning packets. Also I always make it with a venison roast! By far my favorite roast recipe.

Took suggestion of using beef stock instead of water, using two Italian seasoning packets instead of one and it was a HUGE hit with kids!  Definitely a family favorite!!

I followed the recipe and I'm not sure what went wrong. Mine came out dry and tasted more like a pot roast than an Italian beef. Won't be using this recipe or cut of meat again.

This turned out great!  I followed the advice of others and used a chuck roast.  I bought a 2.5lb roast.  I doubled the Italian seasoning and left out the bay leaf because I didn't have it.  I also used fried minced onions instead of onion salt.  Those were the only changes.  I cooked mine on low for 5 hours.  It was tender enough to cut, so I did and then put the cut meat back in the crockpot for an hour.  I also added sliced  peppercini's, sliced mild banana peppers (and a little of the juice), fresh jalapeño (seeded), and canned roasted red peppers to the juice for the hour.  It was so good!

Great recipe.  I used a 2 lb roast because that is what I had.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a beef bouillon cube and some fresh basil.  I tossed it all on high in the crock pot for 4-5 hours.  I shredded the beef and used the sauce as an au jus.  I thought the sauce would be too salty to mix into the meat.  Fabulous recipe.  I will use again.

This is tasty. Following other reviewer comments I used beef broth in place of the water, used chuck roast and used 2 packets of seasoning. due to time constraints I prepped the meat the night before. I mixed the seasonings together and put in a ziplock bag. I seared the meat on all sides, I put the meat in the bag with the broth mixture. It sat together overnight in fridgecrockpot on low. 10 hours later - delicious.

Opted for beef broth in lieu of water, skipped the salt and used 2 packets of dressing mix.  Served on toasted hoagie rolls with Mozzarella cheese and giardiniera peppers.  Tasted just like the sammiches back home in Chicago.

Excellent!! Used a 2.5 lb chuck roast and doubled the dry Italian dressing as another reviewer suggested and it was delicious. Used water, not beef broth as some suggested, and cooked on high for 5 hours yet the meat shredded easily and tasted like it was marinated overnight. Also added a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes to add a hint of spice. Definitely a keeper.

I prepare this with all of the ingredients suggested. The only thing I did differently was cooked it in the oven. I started it at 350 degrees and about hour after it went in the oven I reduced the temp to 250 degrees. It cooked for 5 hours and was fall apart tender. It was delicious! Served it on French bread with a salad. Thanks for the recipe!

I made minor changes to the recipe:  Chuck Roast, 3 cups beef broth, 2 packages dry Italian-style Salad Dressing, no salt.  Other than that I followed the recipe and it was absolutely delicious.  Slow-cooked for 9 hours, shredded the meat and cooked for additional hour.  As suggested by others, I made hoagie sandwiches:  Diced mushrooms & onions sauteed in the roast juice, provolone cheese - grilled in the over to melt /toast.  Melted in my mouth.  DEFINITELY a winner!  Will make again.

I made this using a bottom round roast, otherwise following the recipe. It was a 3 lb  roast - will definitely make again but with a 5 pound roast and increase the Italian seasoning packet as others did to account for more meat. Received lots of compliments. A great recipe!

So I had never made Italian beef. This recipe was so easy  and came out delicious. After reading some review I did make changes. I didn't have onion powder or oregano or thyme. I used McCormicks Italian seasoning instead. I also used 1packet zesty italian dressing mix  2 Italian dressing mixes. I used a 5lb rump roast. Placed some pepperocini and its juice at the bottom  crock pot. Put  the meat in and poured in 3 cups beef broth stead  of water. I cooked on  low  for 4 hours and then high for 3. Came out so good. I added provolone cheese and more peppers to the sandwiches

Per a lot of recommendations I added a second packet of Italian seasoning and also used beef broth instead of water. Slow cooked a roast all day and it was amazing! Served on rolls with provolone, peperoncini peppers, and mild giardiniera. These were excellent! Will definitely be making again.

So disappointed, even after following the recommendations from the highest rated, my first sample after 8hrs on low came out tasting dry and without much flavor.  I saved it by dumping out about 2/3 of the broth/liquid from cooking, added 2 more Italian seasoning packets and half a stick of butter to the remaining liquid. I shredded the cooked meat, disguarded the fat and returned meat to the liquid on warm in the crock pot until I served it to guests. By then it had a wonderful flavor.

It was amazing! I did some modifications based on reviews and incorporated other recipe suggestions. I used one can of beef broth and half a can of water. Used onion powder instead of onion salt. Used 2 packets of Italian seasoning mix. I cut up two small onions and put at the bottom of crockpot. Cooked high for 5 hours then I took chuck roast out to shred. Added half a 16 oz jar of pepperoncinis without the juice and cooked it for an hour more. Buttered hoagie buns in over @ 400 for about 10 min then added beef and provolone onto the bun to cook for a few minutes in oven. Used sauce from crock pot of dipping

This was a fantastic recipe!  I used an English roast cut, which is between a rump roast and a chuck roast in the amount of fat-and it was extremely tender and easy to shred.  I also used half of the Italian dressing packet because we can't handle too much spice and it was still delicious.  I sprinkled the meat lightly with sea salt, black pepper, and some of the Italian dressing.  I cooked it on low for 10 hours as directed and my husband devoured it!

I made this.  Very good! I added pepperoni.  I added too much and it was too hot for my liking.  Next time just a few.  My son even asked for the recipe!

Used Beef broth, 2 packets seasoning, all the required seasonings, and a 3.5 lb cut of meat.  AMAZING!  10 HOURS ON LOW.

This is a MUST HAVE!  I've been searching for a recipe like this for a very, very long time!  I did add a carton of Rachel Ray's beef broth.  YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS!  Serve over a firm roll, dip and enjoy!

Didn't have onion salt so I used 1 part salt with 2 parts onion powder. It tastes better the next day. Served with buttered Italian Bread in a Bread Machine off AR.

Perfect on top of polenta!  My family and I liked this so much better than the Tennessee Meat with the ranch dressing.  The changes I made to make it more flavorful is; added 1 envelope of Lipton Onion soup and 1/4 cup Worchestershire.

Made this for New Years luncheon and it was so easy! Used some of the modifications mentioned by others - beef broth instead of water and 2 packets of dressing mix. Meat fell apart after 10 hours on low ... started it at 10p and woke up to delicious smells coming from the kitchen.

Made this for a Christmas gathering. It was a huge hit. Everyone said it was great to break from traditional foods. I did use beef broth instead of water but otherwise made as written. Very good. Will definitely make again, since my hubby already requested me to:)

I personally am not a fan of this recipe but everyone has their own taste buds!  I made this and then added the regular stuff that I add to my roast.  I packet of brown gravy, Lipton onion soup packet and juice from banana peppers.  After I added that it was good for over rice or sandwiches.

YUMMO!  Used beef broth instead of water and salt.  Fresh chopped onion and garlic.  Can double spices to make flavor stronger, and I add extra pepper.  Shred and put back in crock to "stewp up" before serving.  Chuck roast shreds better, but have used many different roasts and it always turns out great.  Great for sandwiches, served with garlic mashed or on tortillas for kids on the go.  New family favorite!

These were awesome sandwiches and I got rave reviews! I followed the previous suggestions and used chuck roast, beef broth (rather than water), and doubled the amts of spices and salad dressing. I served grilled onions, mushrooms and peppers on the side, along with provolone cheese. Since I doubled the recipe for my crowd of 20,  and all 10 lbs wouldn't fit in my slow cooker, I cooked one 5 lb batch in the oven at 325 for approx 4 hours, and the other in crock pot. Placing both in the fridge overnight enabled me to skim off the fat the next day, then heat both together in the crock pot for the gathering. I barely had any left overs......unfortunately!!

It was great! We used a box of beef broth instead of water and had to sub out onion salt (didn't have any). Instead I used garlic salt and onion powder. It made my house smell great and everyone loved it. We live in the Chicago area and have access to "the real thing" but this is a great recipe to make it at home.

This made AWESOME sandwiches and was so easy. But with only the 2 of us, made it with a 2-1/2 roast and used 1tsp. of Italian seasoning instead of separate oregano and basil. Also used 1tsp. of garlic powder, not salt. Used beef broth, not plain water And used the whole .7ounce pkg. of Italian style dressing mix. It really wasn't too much. When the meat was tender, shredded it, returned it to the juices (as others suggested) plus add 1/2 sliced bell pepper. Piled the meat onto crispy rolls, added provolone cheese, placed under broiler till cheese melted. My husband and I loved this recipe, will definitely make again!!

My husband is an Italian beef lover, when I said I was making this I could see the hesitation in his face. It was amazing! I found buns that were perfectly soft and we added a little mozzarella cheese and peppers and it was spectacular! I did use a Tetra Pak of beef stock, not water and added a TBSP of peppercioni juice just to add a little kick. I will definitely be making this as a Sunday ritual.

LOVE. We could only find a 3 lb chuck roast, but MAN did we wish there were more leftovers for later in the week. Delicious times 1000.... and the only changes made were to use beef broth instead of water and to use two packets of Italian seasoning instead of one. (Thanks to previous reviewers for making those suggestions!) Overall, this was perfection - can't wait to make it again soon!

Separate the beef and "pull" it, strain some of the fat off, reduce the liquid (improves flavors) and add pepperonci and add beef back to the braising liquid for a while.
Serve w gardiniera and melted provolone on the rolls.

I throw in a half jar of pepperoni with juice. It adds a nice little kick. Also I  cook it the day before and then refrigerate so it's easy to slice.

I used 2 pkgs of the Italian mix,  and instead of water I used beef broth as suggested in previous reviews.   And I pan toasted the sliced side of the hard rolls with just a skiff of butter for flavor, then served topped with sauteed onions and red bell pepper, and a thin slice of pepper jack cheese.  Will decrease salt next time. Well received by the whole family!  Great tailgate meal.

I used bottom round roast.  Seared in pan.  Also added a package of Au jus and sweet peppers.  Was very similar to Portillos beef.

This was the best pot roast I've ever had!  If it was listed as a pot roast recipe I would give it a 5 star rating.

Great recipe.. I did use beef broth Instead of water and added sliced Vidalia onion as well. But The one modification I made that really  made the recipe POP like a true authentic Chicago style beef sandwich, was I added a small jar of mild pepperoncini rings with the juice, to the crock pot. I got this tip from a friend who owns a sandwich shop in the Chicago area....followed his advice and WOW! True, authentic style Italian Beef sandwiches at home! SO happy with this one!

I wasn't a fan of just water so I threw in some beef bouillon to the mixture too.  Came out a tad salty so I might hold back the seasonings.  Threw in some bell peppers and sweet peppers and had some giardinera to top it off.  Use the broth for dipping, almost like the Windy City!

Wonderfully easy and tasty recipe. I took some advice from other reviewers and added two packets of Ranch dressing powder for every 5 lbs of beef (chuck roast, not rump), and I also added a few spoonfuls of granulated beef bouillon to the herb/water mix. I ended up with a gorgeous pot of roast that shredded beautifully - I just had to pull a few stubborn pieces of gristle from the pot, but I probably could have left them in if I was serving immediately. The leftovers stored very well, and have been used on sandwiches as well as in pasta and over rice. I'd recommend, for sandwiches, some smoked provolone and creamy horseradish, but hot mustard also works nicely.

If the fat bothers you, follow instructions in the other reviews to drain the liquid, refrigerate, and toss out the disk of fat that will form on top. The cooking liquid is full of flavor, so I'd highly recommend adding it back to the beef afterwards.

Next time I think I'll add in some hot peppers in the last couple hours of cooking. Will definitely be making again!

I  used 2 packets of dry onion soup mix instead of the Italian dressing.  I did use all the herbs and spices and I added an 4 teaspoons of dried Italian seasonings.  The last hour of cooking, I added half a large sweet onion, 2 red peppers and 1 green peeper.  Great recipe!

I found this recipe a few years back, and I've been making it ever since. It's easy to prepare, and tastes delicious. I like to use it for parties, served on small Hawaiian rolls. Everyone Loves it!
I don't change anything in this recipe, and I never have. You can also sear the roast and put it in the pressure cooker for an hour. 
Throw any leftovers in the freezer to add to soups later.

Just like home! My family likes spice so I added red pepper flakes. I also added Worcestershire sauce. After I shredded the beef I added sliced bell pepper to the beef to top off the sandwich. Yummy!

Soooo good and couldn't be easier!!! I didn't really measure the spices, threw an almost thawed chuck roast in the crock, and 10 hours later... Perfection. We had it on onion buns that just topped it all off. This will be on rotation now!

Amazing! I will definitely make this again. 
I followed others suggestions and used 2 packages of the dressing, beef broth and added onions about an hour before it was done. I also used 2 lb chuck roast (easier shredding).

I've been making this recipe for our Christmas Eve hors d'ouevre/appetizer menu for years, and just for fun!! Only changes I make:    1)Chuck Roast (2.5-3 lbs)   2)Beef stock/broth instead of water.  3) rub beef with all seasonings, place beef in slow cooker, pour liquid around the beef & cook on low 8-12 hrs. Shred, return to pot for 1 hr. Absolutely delicious, serve on buns/ w optional toppings!

I made this according to directions and I was very disappointed. The meat was dry and it didn't  make enough moisture to cook to a proper consistency. Will not make again.

This was fairly bland. I think it needed some beef broth and more Italian seasoning. We ended up making BBQ sandwiches out of it which was good.

Overall recipe is good. I do have to say I was crunched for time and had to cook on high. THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED. It's tougher than cooking in oven if you do so.

I've made this several times and it is amazing!  I slice a red bell pepper into thin strips and a yellow onion and toss them into the pot on top of a large chuck roast. I sprinkle the roast with salt and pepper and give both sides of the roast a nice sear in my cast iron pan before adding to the crock pot.  When everything is all done I tale the meat out to shred it then I return it to the pot to soak up more flavor. I dip crusty hard rolls in the drippings, top with meat then a slice of provolone and stick the sandwich and top under the broiler open faced to toast. I do not alter the actual recipe as written because this is hands down THE BEST Italian beef sandwich I've ever eaten (better than any Chicago place even). My teen daughter literally giggles and claps excitedly like a small child when I am making this.  Thank you for sharing this, I don't know how we lived without this recipe all these years ;) For those who like to make a recipe their own by making changes,  DO NOT change this one it is one of those recipes that is perfect just as written.

I used eye of round -- cooked it for 4 hours on high, then sliced it and returned the meat to the juices.  So good!  As far as spices, I added 2 packages of salad dressing mix, and doubled the black pepper because we like a little more bite..

This is soo delicious ! As per previous suggestions I used beef broth instead of water and doubled the Italian dressing.  Cooked for 10 hours, but shredded the meat after 9 hours and put back in crock.  Served on rolls with red onion, roasted red pepper and slices mozzarella put under the broiler for a minute or two. My husband ate two whole sandwiches!

Phenomenal!   We've been making this recipe a few years now and it is always great.  We love serving it on Torta rolls from Costco and melting provolone on them before shoveling the Italian beef on.

This is great and can be doubled for a large group.  I use beef broth in place of the water, but follow the rest of the recipe perfectly.  It is very easy and everyone loves it.  I usually serve horseradish on the side for those who like it.

Great recipe. I shredded the roast, However I did make a few changes. I used beef broth instead of water and I added some extra oregano, parsley, cayenne pepper and some minced onion. I took this to a public place of business for a gathering and many people asked what was in it because it was the best they had in a long time . My roast was a little bigger than 5lbs to.  Definitely will make this again

Used 1 can low sodium/ no fat beef broth instead of one of the cups of water (2 cups of water instead of 3).  Used 2 cloves of minced garlic instead of garlic powder.

This is a staple in my family!! It's so simple, perfect for a day to set it and forget it!! I do substitute beef broth for the water and sometimes I make it with chicken instead of beef and use chicken broth instead of water. I highly recommend this recipe to any busy mom!!

I followed what several reviewers recommended:  I left out the salt and onion salt, used 2 packages of Italian dressing, substituted onion powder for the onion salt, doubled all the spices, and used beef broth instead of water.  I also added sliced red, green, and yellow peppers the last hour of cooking.  It cooked for 9 hours, then I shredded the meat (removing the fat), and cooked for an additional 1 hour.   I served with toasted hoagie rolls, horseradish sauce, and giardiniera and topped it with provolone cheese.  I then baked the sandwiches at 400 degrees for 5 minutes.  This was very good!

I used MomSavedbyGrace's review and agree with doubling the salad dressing amount.  The only other change I made to that was to use beef stock in place of the water which really adds depth to the flavor.  This is a huge favorite with everyone I've ever made it for!

I made this for our XMas potluck at work on 12-23-15, and after we got back from Xmas shutdown in January, my department was still talking about how great this was. One said he had dreams about those sandwiches. The only thing  I added was some pepperchinies (spelling?) and the juice they were in, but everything else I used.

It was delicious. I used a bottom round roast that was only 2-3/4 lbs. used 1 tsp dehydrated onion flakes instead of onion salt. Only used a cup water and added a 12oz can of Pepsi. I sliced it after 8 hrs even thou it was falling apart by then. Then put back in broth and cooked 2 more hours. This was so delicious and not as salty as other recipes. I will definitely make it again

Pretty good!  The only things I did differently was to add a 2nd pack of Italian dressing mix and 1 extra bay leaf.  Makes  the whole house smell SO good.  My kids bugged me ALL day about when it would be done!!!

I highly recommend this recipe, especially for busy people. Easy to make in a crock pot while you are away from home. Here's my tweaks: I used a little over a 3# chuck roast. I used the same measurements as called for in the recipe (for a 5# roast), but used 2 packages of Zesty Italian Dressing (I buy the Kroger's brand because it's cheaper). I threw in a pinch of crushed red peppers and DELETED THE SALT and used Onion POWDER instead of Onion Salt (because I figured the ingredients have enough salt). Instead of water, use BEEF BROTH. Cook on low all day. When you get home from work, shred the beef and put back in the broth. At this point, I added a bit of Italian Seasoning, add a little bit of thin sliced onion and thin sliced green and red peppers along with a few sliced Peperoncinis. Let it cook a bit longer. So good on fresh toasted Italian Sandwich Rolls with some melted Provolone or Mozzarella Cheese. Also, recommend sauteeing some green and red pepper strips, sliced onions and sliced mushrooms and serve on top of the sandwiches. Reheats well for leftovers.

If you are looking for a good pot roast, this is really good. I HATE pot roasts but I was able to eat this and somewhat enjoy it.  If you want an Italian Beef Sandwich, move on.

Did the beef broth instead of water and doubled the Italian dressing as well. The only change I would make next time is a little less salt! Otherwise, I loved it! Definitely a keeper.

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and didn't find the liquid portion to be that flavorful.  However, add some Horse Radish Sauce to it, and it becomes fantastic.

I am making this for the first time today. Sounds like a good starter recipe. My experiences with a slow cooker tells me this may need a slightly higher seasoning to meat ratio. So, as I almost allways do, I'm tweaking the ingredients a bit.  I also used beef broth instead of water and cut out most of the salt. Now, we wait about 8 hours to see how it turns out.

This recipe is excellent!  I followed MomSavedbyGrace's suggestions to use a chuck roast, substitute beef broth for water, and use two packets of Italian dressing mix.  I cooked on low for about 8 hours in the crock pot, and took the beef out to shred at the 7-hour mark before returning to the crock pot.  This is great on potato rolls with provolone cheese, although the husband prefers it over rice and not as a sandwich.  Will make again and again!

Delicious and tender.  My crock cooks super hot so I stepped the heat down sooner but cooked it just as long.   Topped with carmelized onion & cheese.  Was a hit!

OMG I don't know what to say.  I was a Lil worried as it cooked. although the house smelled lovely, it smelled like the roast I regularly make.  wow was I surprised.... the first bite I thought it was OK nothing great, but second bite in I was in heaven.  I made a couple minor changes that were suggested by reviewers and I am glad I did.  I simply swapped the water for broth and the onion salt with onion powder , doubled the Italian dresssing threw in 8 pepperocini peppers and some juice from the jar.  this was really amazing definitely worth making again

A big thanks for those who read the many reviews and put together a summary of suggestions. I followed the review by MomSavedbyGrace and can finally  add a slow cooker recipe to my small collection. (I really want to like  slow cooker meals but usually don't like them). 
Everyone loved the sandwich.
Thanks so much for a wonderful meal!

Awesome Italian beef flavor.  We've made this twice and with the left overs used the Italian beef mixed with vegetables to make a Italian beef Shepherds Pie.  Awesome.  The second time we made it we substituted the water with beef broth.  Again just awesome.

5 stars for ease. and I love any recipe that uses the good old rump roast (vice the currently popular chuck)
I started with a scrawny 2.5 lb top round roast (sorta rump). used all the dry ingredients as listed in recipe. As for the wet stuff: didn't have dry Italian dressing so I added 1 cup of olive garden dressing from my fridge, this adds some vinegar and oil into the mix, 2 cups of beef broth, 1/2 cup of merlot. didn't boil anything tossed it all into the crock.  Set the roast into the mix, and topped it with minced garlic, salt, pepper. I'll cook my vege's (peppers, onion, garlic, and pepper flakes ) in a separate small qt sized crock 2 hrs before the meat is ready. tick tock...now I wait for the finished product.

LOVE this recipe!!  My guests LOVE LOVE this dish!!  It's so easy and SUPER delicious!!  Everyone RAVES about this!  I've made it four or five times.  I've made some changes based on the reviews (beef broth, chuck roast), but I've found that i prefer it as-is!!  The only thing i may swap out is the rump roast.  Some of my grocery stores don't carry it so I buy what they have.  i serve on club rolls; with the options of provolone and horseradish.  HIGHLY recommend this recipe!

This was delicious. I made my own dry italian dressing mix (got it from Allrecipes). I also did not add salt and used low sodium chicken broth.  Cooked it for 3 hours on high then transferred it to my pressure cooker  for 40 min or it would not have been ready in time for dinner.  Shredded beautifully, very tender. Used fresh baked rolls and added a little parmesean cheese blend. So good. Will definitely make it again. My family loved it!

Delicious! Like many other reviewers said I used two packets of Italian dressing mix and I added beef bouillon cubes because I didn't have beef broth on hand. Had to cook on high due to time constraints so it was in for 4.5 hours, then took it out to shred and then put it back in the liquid for another half hour. Whole family gave it a thumbs up. Served on hoagie rolls with cheese. My husband said next time he'd add jalapeños and onions to the sandwich! Definitely going into the rotation. And as other reviewers commented, the house smelled wonderful while it was cooking!!

Growing up I never realized that Italian beef was a Midwest thing until I moved away and no one had any idea what I was talking about. This recipe is great and taste amazing. You can't really slice the meat the way it'd be done in Chicago but that doesn't stop it from tasting good. Served up on Italian rolls, don't forget to dip the bread so it's juicy.

This was so good and easy to make. Used a 2.5 lb. chuck roast, used beef broth instead of water, used onion powder since I did not have onion salt. Also, used 2 packets of the Italian seasoning. This one is a keeper and will rotate into my family dinner often!

I loved this recipe.  It is easy to make and great at a get together where you don't want to spend the entire time in the kitchen.  An added bonus is it also taste great as leftovers and you can freeze them for a later sandwich.

Made as is and thought it was great! So easy, and lots of leftovers! My husband hates "cheap" roasts, but he loved this. We raise our own beef, so I'm always looking for ways to use tougher roast cuts. I think this would work very well with chuck. I will definitely put this in my rotation.

This was so delicious! My husband said this is his new favorite dish.  I did make a few alterations. As others suggested; I used a chuck roast instead of rump roast and I did two packets of mix. I only used about 2.5 lbs of meat since it's only the two of us, but kept the ingredient amount the same. Instead of using water, I used 2 cups chicken broth (it's all I had) and 1 cup water. I'm going to try beef broth next time, but the chicken broth worked just fine. 

After about 8 hours; I shredded the beef, removed the big hunks of fat, and threw in an onion (cutting the onion into long strips) and cooked for an additional 2 hours. After the two hours I sauted some bell peppers, still letting the meat cook for about another 30 minutes or so, taking my time knowing that longer cooking time means tastier meat. Once the bell peppers were ready, I put the meat on a french roll along with the peppers (and a few fresh banana peppers) some sharp provolone cheese and broiled in the oven for about a minute, just to get the cheese melted. 

For anyone who tried the meat at 8 hours like I did, do not judge the meat yet. It was good, but I was unimpressed (and actually a little nervous it wouldnt be good) until after the shredded beef simmered for at least 2 more hours. I kept the slow cooker on "keep warm" and snacked on the meat the rest of the evening and it just got better and better. I didn't even use a fork at one point haha!

I think this has been reviewed enough times to make it clear what makes this recipe work: double the salad dressing mix (use the Italian salad dressing mix recipe on allrecipes!), and add a beef bouillon cube (I only use one- this can get really salty, really fast).  A couple more thoughts: I use onion and garlic powder (not onion salt or garlic salt), again because the salt can get to be a bit much.  The other big change I make is, I use a nice meaty soup bone in place of the roast.  I've never used anything but the soup bone so I can't make a comparison, but I can say that the soup bone yields a lovely, rich stock for this recipe.   I serve it on a crusty Italian bread or baguette, sometimes with spinach sautéed in garlic and oil, and always with hot peppers ("hoagie mix" or "hoagie spread" here in PA).  Makes for an excellent meal that freezes beautifully!  We have this once a week and look forward to it every time.

I have made this and along with others substituted the beef broth instead of water but I used the low sodium beef broth. The beef turned out perfect and shredded very easily and  after shredding it left it in the juice for another hour. As far as the peppers, I cook them on the stove separately with olive oil, garlic powder, and oregano. I leave them covered and cook in their own juices and stir occasionally until they soften up and ready to put on the beef sandwich. The next time I make this will put them under the broiler with cheese to make cheesy beefs.

My changes: 3 cups beef broth in place of water, 2 packets dry Italian dressing, and added some hot peppercini and some juice (didn't measure). I cooked on low 7 hours then turned crockpot to high, shredded meat, replaced meat in pot for an hour. THAT made all the difference in my humble opinion. Made this way (as well as suggested by prev reviews) gave the meat a fantastic flavor! I plated the beef topped with sautéed bell peppers & onions, and provolone. Definitely a keeper!!!

I used 2.5 pound roast and the full amount of spices and the meat just didn't have any Italian flavor to it. It was bland pot roast on bun with good melted cheese. Doubt I will try it again.

Soooo Good! Topped these sandwiches with hot peppers and mozzarella cheese; make sure that you keep the juices from your crock pot for dipping - that really brings out the flavors in this dish!

Great flavor...great leftovers 2-3 days later too.
I've made this several times and never have enough juice...  I am going to double the recipe next time.  We like our Italian bread soggy with the juice. 
From Chicago... home of Italian Beef sandwiches
...what can I say.

Made this as written except used chuck roast (with most of the fat removed) and onion powder versus
onion salt.  Served it with a little of the au jus on the side for dipping rather putting too much juice on the bun.  Very easy, very good. Can see were adding peppers, onions cheese, pepperoncini would all be tasty additions.  Topped pepperoncini slices to sandwiches. Excellent!

Pretty darn good!  Could maybe use a little something more, though (beer? A little BBQ?). But considering how simple it is to make, you won't hear me complain!

This turned very well though I made a few changes. First using this website, I found an Italian dressing mix recipe (dry mix) that I used instead of packaged. Second, when the meat is done, I shredded the meat right in the cooking juices and when I served it, I served the juices on the side for dipping. It was awesome!

OMG...I would give this 10 stars if I could. One of the best slow cooker recipes out there. I did replace the water with low sodium beef broth and doubled the Italian dressing mix. Absolutely fabulous.....no bread needed for me....just sprinkled some Mexican 4 cheese on top.....deeeelicious.

Excellent!  Made this today in the crock pot. I used a 3 lb bottom round roast but used the whole amount of liquid for slow cooking.  Absolutely delicious! Made open face sandwiches on ciabatta rolls. Made Asian Slaw for the side.  Family loved it.  Thank you for sharing!

Just made this past weekend. It was so easy to prep. Followed the directions except used onion powder instead of onion salt. It came outexactly as proclaimed, totally awesome! Received so many compliments and was asked the recipe! Will be making this again! Great easy to go too for large crowd dinners!

Mixed my own Italian dressing mix and used 1 1/2 T.  Instead of shredding meat, I sliced as thin as I could and returned to juice.  Delicious!  Served on rolls with peppers and provolone cheese.

Awesome flavor!  Go with what others have done.  Use beef broth instead of the water, and use double the Italian dressing.  I would also suggest cooking on low for at least 12 hours.  Other than that, it's a great meal.  I cut the string off the roast at the 10 hour mark, and it just fell apart.  It was so tender.  I let it cook another 2 hours after shredding to soak up more juice, and it was perfect.  Great meal!

This is really good!  I am a Jersey girl lol so I am not familiar with the shredded beef sandwiches of Chicago fame but we really enjoyed these!  I just used the broth instead of water and didn't really use much other seasoning except for the dressing packet.  I think this is a pretty flexibly recipe.  I fried up some peppers and onions and served on toasted rolls.  I have made these 3 times already.  Very tasty and you can't beat how easy they are to make in the crockpot...highly recommend

The only adjustment I made was to add an extra package of Italian dressing mix and I threw in one sliced green pepper since I had one on hand.  Tastes just like the Italian beef that we get in the restaurant. It was a hit!

Amazing! Tastes even better the second day. Although this recipe is perfect as is, I think I will try an extra italian seasoning packet next time just for kicks.

Made this a couple times now and just made some basic changes for a 2.5 lb roast: kept all spice amounts the same, used beef broth, put one white onion in crock pot, omitted salt, and doubled dressing packets. So easy and tasty!

Very tasty!  Used beef broth instead of water and 2 packets of italian dressing and it came out delish!  Both my kids loved it too.
I also sauteed up some sweet peppers to add onto the sandwich.

Very delicious. I added some Extra Virgin Olive Oil to the salad dressing mix. I pretty much followed the proportions in the recipe, except I used 4 cups of water and two packs of dressing mix. Woke up this morning and the house had this wonderful roast beef smell. Can't wait to try it again and do some tweaking. A little more salt would be good, I think.

I followed the directions exactly, did not do the other reviewers tips, etc. IT was beyond bland and the meat had to be chopped, as it was not shreddable at all. I don't know why, perhaps my slowcooker overcooked the meat.

I followed the review of othes and used 1 1/2 cups beef broth and 1 1/2 cups water. I omitted the salt and used a 3lb rump roast instead of the 5lbs it calls for. I also used 2 packets of the italian dressing. Plenty of favor and topped it with mozz-provolone cheese and baked until cheese was melted. My husband LOVED it.

This slow cooked beef was excellent. My husband starting eating it while he was shredding it. He couldn't wait to eat it. It had a ton of flavor. This is a keeper.

I'm usually not a fan of crock pot recipes but this was very good.  I added cheese and salami to the beef on a multigrain baguette for a tasty sandwich.  If you are looking for a great beef sandwich for football parties, here you go.

Definitely a keeper!  Will be doing this recipe again and again.  I used the beef broth and two packets of dressing mix as other reviews had suggested.  I also would highly recommend the longer cooking time on low.  I even turned my crock pot down to the "keep warm" setting for the last 3 hours or so.  The meat didn't even really need to be shredded, it fell apart when I pulled it out to shred it. We ate it on toasted buns with provolone melted on under the broiler.  Then added sauteed mushroom and onion with peppercinis on top.

I didn't think this was as good as the reviews led me to believe.  My local grocer was out of chuck roast (there was a big sale that weekend) so I bought the rump roast.  I think that was my main problem.  It was not very flavorful in my opinion but I'm going to try again with a chuck roast and see if I have better luck.

My family LOVES this recipe!  We have found that the meat is more tender when cooked on low, rather than high.  We serve this on split loaf Italian buns with melted mozzarella.  FABULOUS!

This was Yummo!  Absoutly easy to make and so worth the time it takes to cook in the crockpot!  I cut the recipe in half using just  2.5 lb sirloin roast, as there are just two of us.  Night one we used it to top hoagie rolls with grilled onions and green pepper, banana peppers and provolone/cheddar cheese.  Tomorrow night we are going to take the au jus it makes and turn it into a gravy and top some mashed pototes with the remainder meat & the gravy!  This is definitely a recipe that will stay at the top of my list!!  Enjoy :)

Used the recipe as is, but I only bought a 2.5 pound rump roast and left the spices the same.  This was soooo good! I am keeping this one in the rotation for sure!

I have made these several times for family and friends.  Each time I use two pot roasts just so we'll have enough!!  As per other comments I use, beef broth rather than water and an extra pkg. of Italian-style salad dressing.  I also saw a recipe in one of my cookbooks that was very similar to this one that said to put in a package of brown gravy, so I do that also.  Very good!!  I butter and toast the rolls, then top them with the meat and  provolone cheese and put them under the broiler for just a minute to melt the cheese and put the extra gravy in a serving pitcher on the side.  This is an easy dish to make and always a hit!  Thank you, Maureen!!

Awesome!  I made this recipe tonight and was completely amazed at how wonderful it turned out.  I used sweet/hot pepper rings as the garnish to the sandwich and it added a wonderful addition to it.  I will absolutely add this recipe to my favorites!

Very tasty as suggested with sliced pepperoncini and melted provolone.  I thinly sliced the beef rather than shredding.

This was really good!  Could have used more Italian spice flavors though as I thought it was a little bland.  I will use 3 packages of Italian seasoning and add more garlic/oregeno/basil to boost the flavors.  I also used the left overs for a fantastic Italian beef breakfast burrito....I will have to submit that recipe for you all.  Yes, my husband said it was the best breakfast burrito he ever had.  I used the remaining sauce and made it into gravy.  Can't go wrong when you get two separate dish meals out of one recipe!!!  Thank you!

I loved it! Followed the recip but I did add in a good size squirt of premade italian dressing to the sauce in the pan on the stove. I used crusty rolls split open with mozzerella cheese sprinkled on it, then I slid the rolls under the broiler for a few mins till the cheese was bubbly. I added some italian Giardinera veggie mix on top. I ate sandwiches for the next 3 days and the meat reheats in the microwave nicely!

My family loved this!  My only modifications were to use 2 packets of dressing mix, 2 cups of reduced sodium beef broth in place of 2 of the cups of water, and omit the salt.  The beef had a really nice flavor, great on sandwiches or even by itself.

OMG Absoulutely amazing!!! these taste better than the way my mom made them when i was younger. My husband loved these! i used a 2.5 lb roast, i read other reviews and used beef broth instead of water. i wanted to add extra flavor so i used 2 tsp on everything but the salt. Also, i let it cook on low for 8 hours then shredded the roast, cut up an onion and placed it back in the juice to soak the last 2 hours! The flavor is amazing!

It was really good, added two packets of italian style dressing mix instead of one, and used a chuck roast instead of a rump. I also shredded the beef towards the end of it being done and put it back in the crockpot to cook another hour. Came out really good.

This is extremely good, even my picky toddler ate it. I used beef broth rather than water. I served our sandwiches with roasted peppers, caramelized onions, and provolone cheese. Delicious!

Just made this for dinner for my family of 4 - it was a big hit.  The meat was delicious and we put it on Hoagie rolls, topped it with mozzarella cheese and put it under the broiler for a minute - the kids loved it too!

As a Texas expatriate in Chicagoland, I fell in love with Italian beef sandwiches the moment I tried them.  This recipe creates a wonderful home-made version.  One caveat for my Texas (and other non-Illinois) brethren:  Real Italian beef is sliced deli-style.  Not really something you can accomplish with slow-cooker beef.  This recipe is still awesome.

this is an easy as pie recipe, smells yummy in the crock pot, great to feed many or freeze leftovers for another go round! We added a slice of swiss and used pan drippings as dipping sauce! YUMMY!

This recipe is fabulous!  I did use beef broth instead of water like some of the other reviewers recommended.  I also took meat out after 10 hours of slow cooking and I strained the broth and skimmed some of the fat.  I shredded the meat and added some broth back in.  I kept the rest in a bowl on the side for anyone who wanted au jus. I'm going to use a larger roast next time and make this for a crowd.  It's like eating great pot roast sandwiches.  A keeper.

This was awesome and super easy for a football game day! I used beef broth instead of water, used 2 packets of seasoning and bought a 3.5lb roast. I cooked in the crockpot on high for 6 hours, I shredded the meat an hour before serving and put it back in the crockpot. I used an olive oil and garlic salt mixture brushed on the rolls and heated them in the oven. Delicious!

This is an EXCELLENT recipe!  I made it just as listed and will definitely make it again (and again).  Originally coming from Chicago, I would have to say the taste is right up there with the ones we'd get at restaurants back in the Windy City.

As if this needs anymore stars! Wanted something a little different for post football game meal. Found this recipe and am I glad I did! Used a 5.65 lb. sirloin tip, upped all the spices, used 3 pkg of the Italian salad dressing mix, threw in some strips of onion and four cloves of fresh garlic. Used all beef broth and cooked about 10 hrs on low. Removed the roast from broth and let rest then sliced with my electric knife. Limited resources as far as bread so I had to use French, which I split and toasted in the oven. Topped with provolone and put under the broiler to melt. The giardiniara is key!!! Couldn't do the hot because of some guests' "wimpy" paletes so I used regular and added sliced pepperoncini. This was amazing! Limited myself to one small 4 " sandwich but could totally have gone crazy and eaten a larger one. This recipe is a keeper!!!

I had an eight pound found tip roast from Costco that I wasn't sure what to do with.  Tried this recipe and the results were amazing.  The only thing different I did was brown the roast first, then put it in the crockpot  using 4cups of water and two packages of Italian seasoning mix along with the other ingredients.  I cooked it on high for five hours, then turned it on low for four.  The outside of the roast was falling apart, and that's what we ate on sandwich rolls with grilled onions, green peppers and provolone cheese.  I then put the remainder of the roast back in the crockpot and cooked on low overnight.  I turned it off in the morning, and the entire roast was just falling apart.  Wonderful  aromas through the house and just delicious.  My picky husband even said it was excellent.  Will have this again, and again.  So easy and  versatile.

Very tasty.  It didn't taste exactly like I remember Italian Beef tasting, but it was delicious.  I think next time I will use more italian seasoning and see how that works.  Will definitely make this again.

This was outstanding. I cooked it on high for 5 hours, but I didn't feel it was tender enough, so I kept it on low a few more hours. Next time, I will do it on low for the entire time (about 10 hours). I served it on a crusty roll with provolone cheese and broccoli rabe. Delicious!

This recipe was excellent! The beef was extremely tender and full of flavor.  I used a chuck roast.  However, chuck roasts tend to be very fatty.  So, next time I will use a leaner cut of meat.

Delicious!  I used other reviewer suggestions and bought a 2.5 lb rump roast and used 2 packs of Italian dressing.  It was the perfect amount with the juice.  I also used beef *stock* instead of water and added a sliced onion.  I cooked mine on low for 4 hours; sliced it and cooked it for another hour; then I shredded it, added the onion and cooked it for an additional hour before I switched it to "warm".  Very good recipe.  A must try.

I prepared this in advance of some out of state relatives coming to visit.  It was a HIT!  They gobbled up all of it in two days as lunch or late evening snacks.  They thought I must have bought this prepared from an Italian deli but I showed them this recipe.  I think at least one of my relatives plans to rediscover the magic of slow cookers.  Thanks!  I'll prepare this regularly.  Note: I did use low-sodium beef broth in place of water and tossed in a seeded, chopped jalapeno into the seasoning mix for a hint of heat.

I really love this recipe, and my husband did too! He is hispanic and has never had something like this but in the end he polished off the whole pot in two days! I used a 5 lb rump roast, 3.5 cups of beef broth, 2 french dressing packets, all the spices as is, for 12ish hours on slow. About 2 hours before end time, i added a dash of all the seasoning again. I removed the meat to shred it and remove the fat. Let meat simmer for two more hours. Served with wheat french bread, grilled onions, red and green bell pepper.

We used a rump roast and followed cooking directions, however, the meat would not shred. We cut it in strips instead.  We did add onions and peppercinis during cooking. Served on french rolls with mozzarella cheese. These were good sandwiches.

Ok, so I'm lazy. It's summer and I didn't want to haul out the crockpot nor heat up the kitchen with the oven. So I went to the grocery and got Boarshead filet of beef thinly sliced from the deli. I used 1 pound, 1 carton of beef stock and the spices as listed in the recipe PLUS three cloves of crushed garlic. Simmered it on my stove top for about 30 min then served on toasted rolls. DELICIOUS. Next time I plan to double the Italian packet and simmer longer for even more flavor. But it is VERY similar to the beef sandwiches I had as a kid in Chicago. Throw on some of that giardirian (or whatever it's called), dip it in shallow dish of the au jus....YUM!

AWESOME!!! I wanted to try the recipe first and now I am convinced this is what I am taking to our Pitch-In at work. I can't wait to see what others think of this recipe. So easy and tasty! This recipe is definitely a keeper. I went with a couple of the ideas others shared. I used the beef broth, cut the salt and pepper in half and used onion powder instead of salt. I also added 1 tsp of crushed red peppers. I chose to use mozzarella cheese and toasted the buns. Thanks so much for sharing :)

I wish I could give this 3 1/2 stars. This was ok but it didn't impress me like the recipe for Pepperoncini Beef. After my meat was cooked I shredded it and then let it sit in the broth to see if it could absorb some flavor. Without the broth it is pretty bland. I had to add some onions, banana peppers and a splash of the banana pepper juice to the broth to make it taste good. This was ok but I don't know if I would make it again.

Very delicious! I used a 2.5 lb roast, but did not cut any other ingredients. In fact, after making round 1 of sandwiches, I actually added more water and Italian seasonings (but not the dressing mix) to the remaining beef and left on the warm cycle until it was time for "seconds" - and those were even better. I give 4 stars instead of 5 because I'm sure if I'd had a 5lb roast and was serving a lot of people I would have run out of au jus, which is a critical part of the deliciousness of this sandwich. Instead of the individual oregeno, parsley, and basil I used 3 tsp Italian seasoning mix. I was also out of onion powder, and don't have onion salt, so that portion was omitted. I used a Kosher flaked salt so I used a full tsp, but for regular table salt would have gone with a 1/2 tsp.   I cooked on high for about 3 hours, then sliced meat thinly and returned to juice on high for 1 hour. Then I shredded the meat and kept on warm for another hour before the first serving. I served on French bread with white American cheese.

We love our Italian beef in Chicago. Unfortunately it's hard to locate the bread for it in other parts of the country I have found...but we make do & I bring back the good Turano rolls when I can. This is my fix for when I'm away from Chicago. I do add some crushed red pepper flakes to the broth (about a teaspoon) & serve with giardinara.

Just great.  It's just like the Italian Beef I've had in many Midwestern restaurants and homes.  Sometimes topped with a melted slice of provolone or mozzarella and the obligatory sweet peppers. Yum!

After four hungry teenage boys devoured their sandwiches, I knew I should add this into regular rotation.  I nixed the tsp. of salt and used onion powder in lieu of the listed onion salt as the dry dressing mix has enough sodium.  Served this on toasted hoagie rolls with provolone and chopped giardiniera.  Delicious!

This is awesome!  I use beef broth instead of water.  Also, after cooking, strain the broth, add a little horseradish for horseradish au jus.

Excellent way to use a lower-quality piece of meat, or one of the random roasts you get when you buy a whole side. The meat ends up being fall-apart delicious and very flavorful, but not overly zesty. We keep the cooking broth and use it as a dip for French Dips. A favorite slow cooker recipe in my house!

To me, this was alright, but I can't really go by how I feel about it because I'm pregnant and can't eat much of anything! My husband, however, really enjoyed it, and ate most of the left-overs as well, so I'll base it on his rating. :)

I doubled the seasoning except the black pepper (just 1 tsp) and used beef broth instead of water. I served it on jimmy john's bread with some hot giardiniera and provolone cheese. It was awesome! Everyone loved it! Definitely will be making this again.

Fantastic aroma while this is cooking, the flavor wasn't quite as good, but close.  Using the right cut of beef is really important.

husband really enjoyed this meat.  i thought it was ok - but i'm not a big fan of bay leaf.  cooked it on high for 4 hours, could get by with half an hour less probably.  would be good on hoagie buns with some monterey cheese and toasted in the oven. thanks for sharing!

The flavour was very, very good. Unfortunately, the meat was a bit dry at seven hours of cooking time, so I would have to try this again with a shorter cooking time in order to see if that can be remedied.

AWESOME!!  I did the double Italian dressing packets as some others suggested.  I put this meat in some crusty french bread with sauteed mushrooms, onions, and provolone and then pop it into the oven to get good and hot.  We dip the sammy's in the au jus.  Very, very tasty!

I hated to waste the juices that the roast was kept in, so saved and used as a dipping sauce for the sandwich. We also sauteed onion & green pepper in butter & put on top of meat in the sandwich. Use fresh bakery buns. Really very good recipe!

I am not one to normally leave reviews, but this was one outstanding meal. Extremely easy and crazy flavorful. I took suggestions from others and replaced the water with beef broth and the onion salt with onion powder. The meat still came out quite salty, but it was not overpowering enough to knock out the other flavors. At the 8 hour mark, I shredded the meat and then let it cook for another 2 hours. After 10 hours of soaking, the meat melted like butter. The ladyfriend was speechless at how fantastic it turned out. Cannot wait to make this one again.

Outstanding! I didn't have the italian dressing mix- all I had was ranch, but decided to risk it anyways. It was amazing- can't wait to try it with the italian dressing mix. I also used a cheaper cut of beef- can't remember which, but it still was very tender. Thanks for sharing!

This was a very good and very easy recipe.  It seemed to be a hit, from what I was told.  Living in Chicago, I tried very hard to make it taste like it does at the Italian Beef joints that Chicago is famous for.  It felt like something was missing though.  Although it is stil a great recipe, it's a little different.

I made this for the Super Bowl, and it was the biggest hit of the party.  The only changes I made was I used a chuck roast (they're easier to shred), and I used 2 packs of Italian dressing seasoning.  Everyone was asking me for a copy of the recipe.  I will be making this again as a regular Sunday lunch/dinner.

These were ok.  I followed others advice and used two packets of Italian dressing mix and it was too salty for us.  Will probably make again, but with only 1 packet.

This is a fine recipe but was quite salty.  I'd like to think that this was because of the brand of Italian dried dressing that I used (Uncle Ben's which is really the only dressing I can find here in my town in Canada - it makes a dynamite bean salad dressing but is way too salty for this purpose)  I think if a recipe calls for something like "Italian dressing" mix, then the brand must be specified.  There is such a wide range in commercial brands.  I think this recipe is great and I love the ease and the fact that the spices are cooked together somewhat before adding them.   I think it may be my dressing brand and the added salt that made it less than stellar.  Omit the added salt on all counts and read your labels!  All in all, my picky eaters asked for seconds so even though I found it too salty, with a few modifications, this is definately a keeper!

OMG, this is SO good!! Everyone in my family loved it, including my picky 6-year-old daughter!  I added provolone slices to the sandwich bread, then toasted them in the oven on Low Broil. I also made some stir fry that had green and red bell peppers and onions, and added italian seasoning to the veggies. Put the meat on, then the veggies, and voila! Almost like a Philly cheese sammich!!

This is a tremendous recipe! I used arm roast instead since it was on sale and used 2 packages of Good Seasons italian dressing instead of 1. I also used a can of beef broth instead of water, but added 1 cup of water.  I cooked it on low for 8 hours and shredded the beef, cooked it another 1 1/2 hours. I broiled it with provolone cheese on top and it was the best italian beef sandwich I ever made!  My husband told me to ditch my old recipe and use this one from now on.  Thanks Maureen for a great recipe!

Delicious recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was definitely a crowd pleaser.  The leftovers just got better every time I ate them as the flavor permeated the meat.

Thought this was great- I did add a few things- 1.  1/2 c. soy sauce 2.  4 beef bouillon cubes  served with onion rolls & used pepper jack cheese ('cause that's what we had around).  Served with Feta Green Beans (from this site) GREAT together!

Nice flavor and very easy. The meat was a little tough to shred so instead my husband crosscut the roast and this made for tender slices. We put the meat on toasted french bread hoagies with melted swiss and used the au jus to dip the sandwiches in. Tasty sandwiches!

I made this the other day and it turned out great. I had to give it 5 stars due to the fact that this is one of the few foods that everyone in my family loved. Its hard to find something that everyone will eat.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic---fast, easy, delicious. I can't give five stars because I did a little bit of tweaking here and there to suit my personal tastes. However, this is fantastic just the way it is. I will be making this again soon!

Easy in the slow cooker.  Just put all of the ingredients in, baste now and then, and break the super tender meat apart in 4-5 hours (with the slow cooker on high).  Delicious and makes lots of juice for soaking buns before loading them with the beef.

I felt like I used a lot of ingredients and received little to no more flavor than ususal.  I'd rather make BBQ Beef.  It tasted good, but it just didn't add much flavoring.

My family really really liked this! The only changes I made to it was I added 1/2 diced green pepper and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. That combined the best of my old recipe with this delicious, easier recipe. I think I'm going to make this for Christmas Eve.

I made this first time for my retirement party in 2008. Made a double batch and it was a hit. I am made it a second time several months ago and was not enough because some of our friends like to pile up the meat. I am making a 7 lb roast tomorrow to celebrate a group birthday dinner. Can't wait. I love Portillo's Italian Beef but this is better than that.  I am already salivating.  Rose

living in/near chicago my whole life, i know a good italian beef ... and this was pretty good!!  the only slightly weird thing is that the beef is shredded so the texture is different.  i don't know what else you would do though (at home) unless you have a deli slicer.  great recipe!

Oh man was this good.  I used 2 cans of beef broth, 2 packets of italian seasoning, put in two tablespoons of white vinegar and also added some banana peppers for kick.  Put the meat in italian bread added some provolone on top and toasted in the oven. This one is getting saved for football on Sundays!

I know I am completely in the minority here, but I did not like this at all. The pepper was so overpowering, and the meat just did not have a good taste. I will stick to my go-to french dip recipe from this site.

I have been making these sandwiches every month or so for the last 5 years. It is a favorite no matter where I take them. I have brought it to potlucks, served it to friends, and make it for my family on a regular basis. It is a hit. I only edit it a smidge. I use beef broth instead of water, 2 packets of ranch and because my family is not too fond of pepper, I only do 1/2 tsp of pepper. It's definitely a keeper!

I was so excited when I read the recipe as I am from Chicago and miss the food terribly. After making this version I was very disappointed.

Perfect recipe!  The only changes I made were the oregano and basil were fresh, I was out of dried and had to pick some.  I did not have any italian dressing on hand I only had the 7seas Garlic and Herb blend.  What an aroma cooking, we could not wait to try it.  I buttered sausage rolls, sprinkled with garlic powder and broiled them, topped them with the meat and cheese, heated to melt the cheese and enjoyed.  After the sandwiches were eaten I could not keep the guys out of the left over meat.  This is now going to be a staple at our house!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

It was great! I used onion soup mix instead of french dip seasoning and it was still great! I halfed the recipe for my sm. slowcooker and it lasted for 2 meals. The meat was so tender my husband was in awe. He loved that it was basically "meat on a bun" and that I suggested the idea...what a hit!

YUM!  I used a very lean roast.  I used beef broth instead of water.  The last hour of cook time I put in red, orange, yellow, and green bell pepper slices and sliced fresh mushrooms and onions.  I served it on toasted buns.  It would be great with some Hot Italian Giardiniera!!!

Very good and very easy meal for a group!  I made the recipe as stated, except I used two cans of beef broth instead of water and omitted the salt.  I cooked it overnight in the crockpot on low, used two forks to break the meat up and then let it sit in the juices for a few hours until it was time to eat.  Served it on rolls with sauteed green peppers, onions and mushrooms and topped with provolone cheese.  Will definitely be making again.

Awesome & so easy!! I used chuck roast and trimmed off most the fat (and it was still very flavorful) Also used 2 packets of italian dressing. Like one other person suggested I cut up green peppers and added them at the end of cooking time. Next time I will add more than one pepper. Served with crusty french bread and hot giardiniera. Felt like I was living in Chicago again! Thanks for the recipe.

I'm giving this one 4 stars....I also used 2 packets of dry Italian dressing,Beef Stock in place of the water,  and used a chuck roast.  Cooked on low for 10 hrs., shredded, and put back in crock pot to cook for another hour or so...the juice has a great flavor, but due to using a chuck roast, I found it a little greasy, and skimmed the top off a few different times before serving.. it tasted like a basic pot roast on french bread...I also added Provolone,  Horseradish Garlic Sauce, and some Hot Peppers. I broiled for a few minutes to melt the cheese...  It was good, but next time I would use a rump roast, or tri-tip.  A better cut of meat for me would have made it a 5 star.I do realize that a rump roast is what is called for in the recipe, but after reading reviews, I found that many used a Chuck Roast, so that is what I chose to try. Nothing againast anyone else's preference, but for me, a Pot Roast isn't the cut of meat to use.... More authentic Italian Beef would be a rump or tri-tip... However, the  flavor of the juice  was Great!!  Thanks for a great recipe.  The family did Love it, and will be making again...with another cut of meat... :)

This made a great alternative to cold sandwiches.  The meat was tender, very easy to shred, and tasty.  It seemed a little plain on its own but topping it with coleslaw was delicious.  Another day we melted shredded cheeses on top and that was great too.  This is a recipe I'll definitely make when we have a crowd over.  You can do it ahead of time and stick in the crockpot for reheating the next day.

Used a chuck roast. A little greasy.I needed to strain the broth in the crock pot prior to shredding. Gave it 4 stars because it tasted ok, kinda plain.

Great on Sandwiches! Put on Rolls with sauteed onions, peppers, mushrooms & provolone. I forgot to boil all the ingredients first and instead just threw everything in the crock pot, still turned out yummy! I also did a Chuck & Rump at the same time, Chuck was a lot more tender!

3/15/10 - Love it!  Have made this a few times and follow the advice of others. I usually end up using a can of beef broth (if I have it) along with the remaining amount of water.  I always double up the seasonings called for.  I never put in salt.  This past weekend I served it on rolls made from Mama D's Italian Bread recipe on this site.

Has anyone tried this in a Nesco?  I've made this in a slowccoker many times.  However, I have a big party coming up (about 50 people) and thought about trying to make it in a Nesco to accomodate the large qauntitiy I need.

Delish!  At the advice of others I used 2 cans of low sodium beef broth and added water until the roast was covered, and I used 2 packages of the dry salad dressing mix.  I used a shoulder roast because that is what was on sale and it was so tender it just fell apart!  I served it at sandwiches with provolne cheese and horseradish mayo, but it would be great by itself or with rice.  Don't forget to save the juice for dipping sanwiches or making gravy!

Made two batches, one with chuck and one with cross-rib roast.  I tried to buy a rump roast but the butcher flat out refused to cut one for me, telling me that the cross-rib would be better!  Sliced roast, versus shredded chuck, seems more authentic to me but both were tender and tasty.  I put the slices in the liquid to heat just before filling sandwich, otherwise it would have fallen apart.  Sliced peperoncini make the sandwich, as does buttering and toasting the hoagie rolls before filling.  Wetter is definitely better!  I did substitute the onion powder for onion salt and eliminated the salt, and used beef broth/water with double the packaged salad dressing mix as recommended.

This recipe made me a hero to my hubby! He is originally from Chicago and misses the local Italian Beef sandwiches. This recipe is about as close as it gets!!! He LOVED the sandwiches and said the only thing that would make them better is to have authentic Chicago rolls. This is a keeper!!! Thanks for the great recipe.

This was SUPER tasty.  My husband LOVED it.  I used 2 packets of dressing mix and omitted all added salt.  I also shredded it once it was done and then let it sit in the crock for an additional hour on low...PERFECT!  Placed the meat on toasted hoagies and topped with provolone cheese, then threw the sandwiches back in the oven to melt the cheese.  Will make again for sure...probably on football sunday for the guys!

Added 2 packets of dressing mix - do not add any of the salt products.  It is not needed.  Also added about 10 whole pepperoncinis along with 1/3 of the juice.  Served on hoagie rolls with provolone cheese and broiled to melt the cheese and then put on a horseradish/ mayo sauce.  Very good.

I really like this recipe.  It is so easy to set it all up in the crockpot so that we have an easy dinner when we get home from work.  It makes plenty if you want to invite a few others for dinner too.

Went like crazy at my husband's jobsite.  I added more seasonings, though, as we like it a bit more savory.  Good stuff!

Really good beef! I followed the directions exactly, except I used a 4 lb top round roast. After 6 hours on high, my meat would not pull apart (probably because of the low fat content). So I just took it out, sliced it thinly, and put it back in the juice. Served this on sub rolls with provalone and banana peppers. Really easy meal that I will definitely make again when roasts go on sale!

I made this recipe for the first time, added a beef bouillon cube and onion powder rather than the onion salt, otherwise I followed exactly.  I cooked overnight on low and the beef was great.  I think adding giardiniera as a topping to the sandwich gave it the kick that some reviewers believe is missing from the recipe. I thought it was great and I'll make again.

I couldn't find rump roast so I chose an eye of round roast (I think!).  I used "zesty" italian dressing and other than that I didn't change a thing.  It has a kick, it was very tasty, very similar to what I've had at restaurants, etc.  We'll definitely make this again!

As written, this was just too bland for me.  I ending up using 3 packets of italian dressing mix and upping the measurements on all other seasonings(except salt). Because it was so simple and tender, I will try it again, but next time I will use beef broth instead of water and add some chopped pepperoncinis to the slow cooker to spice it up.

Pretty darn good.  I took other's advice and used Beef Broth.  I sliced my roast into strips before cooking so didn't do any shredding.  Hubby took it to work to feed his crew and it was really well received. Highly recommend, tasty and easy to make.

So delicious! Huge hit at our house.  I used beef broth instead of water. Added sliced bell pepper with about an hour left. Definitely add the shredded meat back to the juice.  And to make them super authentic - we dunked the entire sandwich - after it was assembled - into the juice!  The messier the better!

Served on Hoagie rolls with swiss cheese. I threw the rolls and cheese in the broiler for a minute or two. I also added half an onion about an hour before removing the beef from the slow cooker. My boyfriend said it was the best sandwhich he'd ever had. It heats up great for leftovers as well. Thanks for a keeper recipe!

So flavorful! I did make a couple small changes, though. I used a 2.5 lb bottom round roast instead of 5 lb rump roast. However, I didn't alter the amounts on the other ingredients. I didn't have onion salt, so I added extra salt, 2 vegetable bouillon cubes, and 1 tsp powdered beef bouillon. I didn't have dried parsley, but I don't feel it would have added enough flavor that I would miss it. I also took a jar of pepperoncinis, poured a little of the juice in, then tore off the stems and seeds and tore the peppers into strips and threw those in. I really think the pepperoncinis added something that would have been missing. My boyfriend told me this is the best thing I have ever made! I put the meat on french hoagie rolls with provolone cheese.

Super yummy!  I used beef broth instead of water and it turned out great!  I used onion powder instead of salt.  Just watch salt amounts if using broth, you may have to decrease or use low sodium broth.

I am from Chicago and this is by far the most amazing Italian beef I've ever tasted! I made the beef for a birthday party, and everyone loved it and went back for seconds. Brilliant!! Made the changes requested. Perfect.

This is my favorite new "go to" recipe.  I make it at least once a week.  My 6 year old daughter asked me if I would make it EVERY day :).  I make it with a lean chcuk roast, but have also made it with London Broil.  I usually follow the directions as written, although I have substituted the water for beef broth, which was fabulous...however I reccommend if you do this you omit the salt from recipe.  Absolutely delicious!

As other reviewers suggested:  Beef broth instead of water, double the dry Italian dressing seasoning packet.  Delicious!  Served on hoagie rolls, with onions, pepperoncini, provolone cheese.  Melted cheese under broiler.  Will definitely make again.  Thank you for this tasty recipe!

I followed the recipe as written as far as the seasonings were concerned.  I used a 3 lb. chuck roast instead of the 5 lb. rump roast, mainly because I had one in the freezer that needed to be used.  I cooked it on low temperature for about 10 hours, broke the meat up to allow the juices to settle in and turned off the slow cooker.  It was fantastic!  When I made the sandwiches I toasted the rolls, melted Provolone cheese on them, put pepperoncinis and marinated artichoke hearts on mine and roasted red bell pepper on both of them.  So tasty!  We will be using this recipe again.

This recipie was DELICIOUS!!!  I am from the Chicago area but I live in Baton Rouge, LA.  Now I love my new home, but you cannot find a decent italian beef sandwich anywhere down here!  The only issue is the meat was a little too salty for me (and I love salt). Next time I will use onion powder instead of onion salt.  Also, making the sandwich with mozzarella cheese help cut back on the saltiness.  But all in all, I will definately be making this one again!

This was a really easy and good weekday dinner.  I had a 2.5 lb eye of round and followed the recipe exactly.  Turned it on at 6am and when I got home at 5pm dinner was ready.  Husband ate three sandwiches!  Will be a keeper!

Love it!  I use the recipe with 2 packages of Italian Seasoning to kick the flavor up a bit so it just doesn't taste like roast.  We put sweet/hot peppers on top as well.

So easy and so tasty!  I used a much smaller piece of meat, but made the entire amount of liquid.  I pulled it out of the crock pot when I got home from work, shredded it and poured out most of the liquid and then put the rest of the meat back to simmer a bit longer in the remaining liquid.  Then I assembled my sandwiches and put slices of provolone on them and put them in the oven to melt up.  Such a great meal!!!!

I too grew up on Chicago style Italian beef.  Since I didn't have any dry Italian salad dressing I used Lipton's Beefy Onion dry mix.  I also used a bit more oregano.  Instead of rump roast, I used a pound of sliced roast beef from the deli and cooked it about 4-5 hours on low.  If you cook it less time the beef doesn't have time to absorb the flavors.

I made this for dinner, tweaking it a little, the way other posters said to do, and I think it is okay. It wasn't as good as I was hoping, but my husband really liked it, so I am giving it four stars.  A few days after I made it my husband was still going on about how good it was so I'll make it again some time for him.  It was definitely easy to make.

Awesome!! My husband LOVES this! I make it on a Monday and he eats it for lunch most of the week! Super easy and delicious! I make mine with a large jar of whole pepperoncini's including the juice for some kick! Also use broth instead of water. Serve on a toasted roll and your good to go!

I'm from Chicago and love italian beef.  This tastes almost exactly like the sandwiches you can get in Chicago.  The consistency was a little different, but the taste was great!  I didn't change anything and it was so simple to make before work.  I'll definitely make this again! Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy and yummy!  I used the italian dressing mix recipe from this site and dumped that and all the other seasonings into a bowl and made a mini rub for the sirloin roast I had and let that stand for 10 minutes before into the slow cooker.  I did mine on high for the first hour or so and then low for another 6 or so.  I tried to pull the meat out to shred it and it fell apart, so I just took tongs and shredded/pulled it apart in the crock pot, and put the whole crock pot out with tongs for people to grab right out of the juice.  Good rolls/buns and hot peppers with provolone make it even better.

We are big French Dip fans, so this seemed like the way to go for a worknight.  Very tender, very tasty, very quick and easy to prep.  It ended up being in the crockpot for almost 10 hours and it was great..the only thing I wish I had done was a little more garlic for my big roast and trimmed a bit more fat.  Very good on bakery hoagies with noodles or potatoes on the side..great juices!

Like others, I substituted beef broth for water and doubled the Italian seasoning. I lightly buttered and toasted sub rolls and served with hot peppers and onions. If you're making it for a Chicago native, don't forget to dip the sandwich in the juice! This is a big hit at family gatherings.

I had never had Italian beef, but I had seen Guy Fieri make it on the Food Network.  It looked so yummy.  This recipe just wasn't what I expected at all.  I didn't think it tasted very good and it was very watery, like soup.  It was a lot like BBQ beef, only with no bbq sauce and not much flavor.  Sorry, this one was a disappointment to me.

Tastes like Chicago!  Takes me back to the Windy City whenever I make this.  As other users, I increased the Italian dressing to two packages.  Perfect topped with giardinira - the hot peppers mix that you find in the grocery store.  Get a good hoagie roll, top with the beef, put some peppers on and pour on some juice or dip the sandwich in the juice.  That's true Chicago style.  Tastes like Mr. Beef. Roll up your sleeves and enjoy!

Let me start by saying I am not a Chicago native, I actually grew up in Rockford Illinois. However even in Rockford there was nothing better than the awesome Italian Beef sandwhiches! Living in Iowa now for ten years I simply cannot find an Italian Beef on the menu at any restaurant and I totally crave them!!! So of course I was very excited to try this after reviews from actual Chicago natives giving this recipe a thumbs up. So I really really wanted to love this...but I didn't. I started out with two cans of broth and one packet of the Italian dressing. When I went to shred the meat it really had no flavor so I decided to add another packet of dressing. About an hour later we had our sandwhiches. Now don't get me wrong it was a good sandwhich, just not great, and certainly couldn' hold a candle to the Italian beefs I'm used to from back home and from many visits to Chicago. For me the Italian dressing was coming through too strong and I kept thinking about that pasta salad you make with the dressing because it was so very strong!Like I said though I did put in two packets when the recipe called for one so that's my own fault. However I did feel like with one packet it just had no flavor. So try this recipe for a good sandwhich just do not expect a great Chicago italian beef from your slowcooker. Thanks for the recipe though I think I may use it again in the future!!

This was delicious! I used a rump roast as recommended and set my crock pot on 10 hours. The meat was falling apart it was so tender. I did double the italian dressing and used 2 cans of beef broth in place of the water. I used all of the other spices exactly as stated in the recipe.

This was good but not as italian-y as we would have liked.  I will be following some of the other comment suggestions (like doubling or even tripling some of the spices) which should make this excellent.

Surprisingly tasty and easy.  Make sure you use a roast (like the suggested rump roast) that has a bit of fat so the meat doesn't dry out.

Before I make a recipe, I always read the ratings and I make it a point to find the lowest rating and read it too... Im giving this a 4 because I had to make some adjustments. I used a 4 lb rump roast, with a can of beef broth, double all other ingrediants (including water) except the italian seasoning. It turned out great, everyone loved it and it fed 15 people. I will make it again.

Hubby and I really liked this!  The meat has an awesome flavor!!  I used a chuck pot roast per one of the reviews and also because it was on sale this week.  I used the seasonings for a 5 lb roast even though ours was only 2.8 lbs.  It was great to be able to leave it all day and then have it pretty much ready for dinner when we got home! We served it on hoagie buns with provolone cheese broiled briefly in the oven. We will definitely make this one again!

I could not be happier,really when this hit my mouth I almost wept. I am a Chicago native and the food there is second to none. I miss it dreadfully. This recipe turned out EXACTLY like the sandwiches back home, smells the same, looks the same and tastes the same if not better than I remember! I used a 3 lb. chuck roast, 2 cups of water and one of beef broth, and did use 2 of the packets of dressing and that was that!THANK YOU for this recipe I will make it again and again.

These sandwiches were delicious made according to the recipe.  Even my boyfriend who isn't a fan of trying new food and my picky kids loved them.  e ate them on toasted buttered bread.

Very good!  I made this for guest we had over.  I used two cups beef broth and 1 cup water.  And I added green and red peppers and red onion.   I toasted the hoagies and topped the meat with the peppers, onions, provolone cheese, and some Horseradish sauce.  Very good!  The beef broth helped make this more of an Au Jus, perfect for dipping!

Good recipe, however, it tastes very similar to a much easier recipe I've used - a couple packages of italian dressing mix and a package of brown gravy mix.

Excellent!  Used beef broth and 2 pkgs Italian dressing; also added some onion and red pepper to slow cooker to help flavor the meat.  Served with sauteed onions (sauteed with some of the juices), roasted red pepper, provolone cheese, and banana peppers--broiled the sandwiches on a pizza stone to help toast the bread.

Very tasty sandwich. I've never had an Italian Beef sandwich, so I don't have anything to compare this to, but the beef has a very good flavor. I pre-toasted some hoagie rolls in broiler and then added my beef, sweet peppers, and provolone and then put it back under the broiler. Now this sandwich is not for the  timid and you're going to get messy, but its worth it!

I make this all the time.  It's wonderful.  I melt some butter and garlic powder and paint some on the rolls and stick them under the broiler.  Then I add the beef to the buns and have a small bowl of the sauce for dipping my sandwich!!!  Yummo!!

Love! Love! Love! this recipe!!! The only change I make is I cut the salt in half and use beef broth, I love the richness it gives.  I also make this a day in advance so I can refridge it and skim off the fat. Otherwise, IT'S A WINNER! DW

Wow, I can't believe how great this turned out!  The same Chicago Italian Beef taste my husband and I crave.  Shredded is better than sliced but only because I can't seem to slice it thin enough.  I wish I had a deli slicer!

This is a WONDERFUL recipe, though with a few tweaks it was PERFECT for my palette. Added 1 cup of beef broth and reduced water to 2 cups (still 3 cups liquid), added 1 more package of dry Italian style salad dressing mix, and used a 3 lb chuck roast. This is a bit more spicy, but if that's how you like your sandwiches, you'll love this!

I rate this a 4 only b/c I make several changes to the recipe that may help someone else.  With my changes, it's a 5 definitely!!  Instead of water, use beef broth. Add extra seasoning (garlic, oregano, Italien seasoning are all good). When serving, add pepperoni to the buns and then put the meat over it. Add sauteed onions and peppers on top of that, cover with provolone and melt in the oven. YUMMMMMM!

This recipe was ok. I thought it needed more punch to it and more flavor. I would probably use beef broth rather than water and add some more italian mix or something.

Yum! These sure beat the stuffing out of the gawd awful thing I had at a Portillos in Vernon Hills, IL last week * they're suppose be the best* I think not!!

Forgot the parsley but did'nt miss it...added 1tsp of minced garlic from the jar and some crushed red pepper flakes.

Used 1c. water and a can and a half of beef broth.

My beef was fork tender within 6 hours so, shredded and returned it back to the juices, added 4 big pepperocinis and after another 1/2 hour..added a half of a green pepper.

Absolutely Scrumptious!!!!

Only thing I'll do different next time is omit that packet of seasoning.  Did'nt notice it's enhancement and heck,  those things cost $1.45 here!

This recipe is delicious. It was just like the sandwiches I used to get from a grocery store deli in South Louisiana. The store has long been gone, but my craving for their roast beef sandwiches has never died and no where have I ever had a sandwich that compared, until this one. The only change I made was using regular onion powder and additional salt (because I did not have onion salt in my cabinet). This was a hit for the whole family. Thank you for this recipe. I know I will be making this over and over again.

This was very good! I served it to my fiance and his friends, and they all gave it thumbs up as well. I used double the salad dressing mix, as reccomended, but I think it still could use a little more spice, maybe the Zesty packets instead, or some green and red peppers.

10+ stars.  I have friend who is from Chicago and goes back frequently just to buy the "Chicago Beef".  When she stasted mine, she asked me "what part of Chicago did you buy this".  When I told her I made it she had to have the recipe.  A lot cheaper than driving to Chicago!!

This recipe is great.  The first evening I added carrots and potatoes to the broth.  I thickened half of the liquid for gravy.  The second evening I heated and shredded the meat for Italian sandwiches.  Also, as suggested I used both beef broth and water.

I did include 3 chopped onions and instead of water I used a cup of chicken broth & a cup of beef broth; also, another reviewer was correct: chuck roast shreds easier than rump roast. This meat is very hard to stop eating.

This is the first time we've tried an Italian beef recipe and I've got to say it was wonderful. I didn't deviate from the recipe at all and it came out perfect. Sauce is to die for with italian bread for dipping. This rather finicky family loved it and will be making it a regular in our meal planning.

Totally AWESOME!!! I followed the recomendnations by MomSavedbyGrace and this was wow,oh wow.I cut the salt in half and used onion power in place of onion salt and used two bay leaves. I also used white pepper for a great boost. I used a arm shoulder roast as it was real lean and no fat. Had to cook longer but it was well worth it. I put sliced peperoncini peppers and roasted red peppers and then 2 slices of provolone cheese and then under the broiler. My oh my was this the best ever. Better then any french dip that I have tried. My wife said I had to make her one more for dinner which is very unusual for her.

I'm gonna say... good not great. The meat was cooked perfectly, but did not have as much flavor as I was expecting. I did add beef bouillon to the water, but next time I would only use 2 cups of water or beef broth. I think I would also use 2 packets of italian seasoning. It was a tasty meal, served on bakery-fresh hoagie rolls with melted cheese, but the flavor didn't pop like the italian beef you get in Chicago.

I cooked this for a birthday party. Everyone loved it, and one person asked for the recipe before the end of the night. I made some changes based on other reviews. I used 3 cups of beef broth, used 2 packets of the salad dressing mix, omitted the salt, and bought a chuck roast instead (cheaper). I cooked on a low setting for 10 hours. Served on hogie buns, topped with mozzarealla cheese, girdaneria (mix of marinated veges), and peperoncinis. Broiled in the oven to melt the cheese and served. I'll definetly make this again!!

My family enjoyed this recipe. While it wasn't what I was hoping for it was pretty good. I would recommend (like others have) to add zip add a jar of hot pepper rings. We split our hoagie buns, added meat, peppers and provolone and toasted in the oven. Thanks!

I doubled the seasonings as recommended.  It was good, though plenty salty.  Served for a party and it was easy and the rump roast is a must as it doesn't have any waste.  Is perfect for a crowd or to go camping (if you have electricity).  Also served a strawberry daquiri (sp!) pie from this web site as well.  I liked this recipe due to the ease and it's something different to do with a roast other than BBQ.

OK. I must admit. I have had a LOVE affair with Chicago-style Italian beef sandwiches ever since I tried my first one at a well-known eatery on Chicago's south side (featured on FoodNetwork and in Details magazine). So, when I found this recipe, I HAD to give it a try (I, a western burbs gal, am a far drive from the south burbs...). Made this for my bf and I and we both thought the beef was good, but not nearly as delicious (or spicy) as the stuff we are accustomed to. My only modification (if it can be considered that) was to use an almost 3 lb. roast b/c I was making half the recipe for the two of us (but I used the amount of water/spices called for). In an effort to make this more suitable to our palates, I topped fresh sub rolls with lots of beef, some cooking juice and girdaneria - a mix of marinated, pickled carrot, cauliflower, pimento-stuffed olives, celery and red bell pepper. No cheese, though (not a Chicago thing). Still OK, but not really what we were looking for. I might consider making this again though if I don't find something I/we like better. Thanks for sharing!

This was good, but not as fabulous as I had anticipated it being.  I reheated later and added a splash of peperoncini juice and that made it much better!

I used a beef bottom round roast because it was cheaper than rump roast.  I added 3 cloves of minced fresh garlic to enhance the flavor.  Ended up with great beef and wonderful juice.  Good leftovers too! Can't wait to make this again!

I don't eat beef, but my husband loved this.  Very easy, too.  When it was done I took a few Tbsp each of butter and flour, cooked those on the stove a bit and added the liquid from the crock pot to make a gravy (I halved the original recipe).  I was really tempted to try it, it smelled so good!

This was GREAT!!  I used chuck roast instead of a rump roast.  I also used 1 cup of beef broth and 2 cups of water.  I didn't double up on the italian dressing mix but I might try that next time to give it a little more zip.  I served it shredded on toasted rolls with melted provolone on top....mmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!

This was delicious! I used about a 2.5 lb roast since there's just two of us, and we still had leftovers, which I'm going to use to make Beef Vegetable Soup. I didn't have garlic powder so I added a minced clove of garlic. After about 11 hours on low heat, I took it out and shredded it, then put it back into the juices for about thirty minutes. The hubby LOVED it! And best of all, it was sooo easy to make since I work full time. A fantastic recipe, indeed!

I followed this recipe exactly, I really wanted to try it as written. Unfortunately, we just really didn't like it. It doesn't have a whole lot of flavor. It really needs something, I'm just not sure what, and I don't think I'm going to make it again to find out. Thanks for the recipe though.

The beef was excellent.  I followed others' suggestions and doubled the seasoning and used a trimmed chuck roast.  I toasted provolone cheese on top of sundried tomato hoagie rolls until very crispy.  I served the juice on the side for dipping!  Yummy!

My husband declared this to be the best shredded roast for sandwiches he's ever had!  I used one box of beef stock and doubled all the other ingredients, as per some other reviewer comments.  Served on toasted sub rolls with melted muenster cheese. Delicious!

These were flavorful and of course messy to eat but as they should be. After reading other reviews I also opted for the cheaper chuck roast and this was super easy to shred. I had mine cooking for a longer time period as we were gone longer than expected and this did not dry out at all. This made lots so I was able to freeze half for a later use. I also forgot to throw on some provolone cheese on top  of each sandwich which really would make these that much closer to Heaven. LOL!! Thanks for a great recipe.

I made some changes that others recommended. I used beef broth instead of water, 2 pkgs of Italian dressing mix & a chuck roast instead of a rump roast. I also made it the day before I needed it so it marinaded over night. What a hit. I made it for a pot luck & it disappeared. Thanks for the great recipe. Will make this again as my husband was mad he didn't get any.

I have made this many times and am amazed at the compliments I get.  I take it to picnics, team parties and family gatherings.  Its so easy and everyone just loves it.  It great to make and freeze for those hectic days when you don't know what to make and time is short.

This is exactly like the Italian Beef sandwich I get from a local deli. I have been trying to match that taste and this recipe does it. Pick up a jar of Italian relish to make it complete. Excellent flavor!

Turned out fabulous! Tweaked it alittle as other users suggested.  Used beef broth in place of water, used 2 pkg of the dry italian seasoning and used a chuck roast. Cooked for 8 hours on low, removed the roast and shredded it (it literally fell apart) then added a sliced onion and a red pepper and returned the roast to the juice in the crock pot. Served on hard crusty bakery buns with provolone cheese.  Also served Hashbrown Casserole II from this site.  Everyone loved both dishes.  Thanks again.

This beef melts in your mouth. I use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, and I skip the parsley, but otherwise, amazing.

This was pretty good overall... the juice was good, but it would have been better with the beef broth rather than the water.  For some reason I can't find the right kind of meat to use that just literally falls apart when you shred it with a fork.  I have tried chuck roast and rump roast and neither one shredded well for me.  (Any suggestions?)  I did cook on low the entire time as well.  So I don't know!  Maybe it's the meat, in any case, this was a good recipe and I will use it again, I'll just modify it a bit!  Thanks for sharing!

It was good the first day, great the next day when reheated.  When I make this again I will make it a day ahead and serve it the next day.  I made it with 3 lb. chuck roast and beef broth as recommended but still added some of the salt....I will omit all the salt next time.  I also added some minced garlic and chopped onion.  Served on french rolls with peppers and giardiniera and it was almost like being back in Chicago!

Very Good. If you have a oblong Crock pot be sure to turn it several times. The first time I did not shred it and the second time I did shred it. I also used the leftovers to make enchiladas and burritos and loved it!

This was very good. I took the recommendations of other reviews and used 1 can off beef broth and one cup of water. I used 1 1/2 packages of italian dressing mix. I threw one peeled uncut onion (which I removed before serving) into the crockpot and used fresh garlic. It was delicious. I will definitely make this again.

I was not disappointed with the recipe to say the least. When I first tasted it I thought maybe a three star rating. Then I started dipping in the juice and thought what a really good recipe. We used french burger rolls with roasted red peppers, and sauted mushrooms and onions. Also provolone cheese. Served with a garden salad. My DH ate two and a half of these at one sitting and he is not a big eater. We used a chuck roast. Made it again and used more Italian seasoning and liked it even better. This time I made sure to rub the spices into the meat ahead of time and I think it made a significant difference.

This was a very good recipe...it is almost 5 stars, but it still needed 'something'....I just don't know what?  I used beef broth, extra seasoning, some juice from the peppers, and fresh garlic, but it needed something else as well.  I will need to experiment a bit to perfect it.

My family loved this and I didn't even make it by the recipe.  I didn't have italian dressing mix so I used ranch dressing mix and instead of pepper I used (some famous man) seasoning.  I did use the real garlic as suggested by other's.

This recipe is awesome!  I substituted two cans of beef broth for the water which gave the juice alot more flavor.  I also cut up a large white onion and added it.  I added a jar of peppers, but it made the juice a little too spicy.

This was a HUGE success.  I made a few changes (of course).  I used beef broth instead of water, and added a jar of sliced pepperoncini (including some of the juice).  This made it a bit spicy.  I then loaded some of the meat mixture into a hoagie roll, added provolone cheese and stuck it under the broiler for a few minutes to melt the cheese and make the bread crusty.  MMMMnnnn!!!!!!!

Yummy!!   I added sliced mild yellow peppers on top of the roast while it was cooking.  It really added a nice kick!  I will make this again!

This was delicious.  Followed recipe exactly.  No need to change a thing.  I toasted hoagie rolls with mozzarella and onions.  Will be making this again soon.

Just sliced, this would have been too dry.  However, shredded and served on buns with the dipping sauce, it was delicious.  I made it as directed and found the seasoning to be just right.

This is an awesome recipe. I didn't have dry italian dressing, so I used half a bottle of italian dressing, it still turned out wonderful!

This recipe is wonderful, the only changes I made were substitute onion powder for onion salt, and around the last couple hours I put in some sliced greens peppers.I received many complements on these beef sandwiches; I will be making this for years to come. This is coming from a chicagoan.

Fall-off-the-fork tender.  Boyfriend loved it, but he is a beef lover.  I prefer it over mashed potatoes, like a reviewer before me :)  I had a little onion and green pepper left over from another cooking project and added it, didn't put in any added salt.  Otherwise, followed the recipe.

This is my husband's favorite meal. He actually eats it like a roast, with mashed potatoes and gravy rather than in a sandwich. My only suggestion is that if you're eating it as a main dish and not a sandwich filling, it's a little salty. I usually subsitute onion powder and garlic powder for all the salt.

This is best beef dish to make ahead of time. Tastes better the next day. I  read the reviews and took some of their suggestions for replacements. Less salt all the way around works and the low sodium beef. I've served this twice with a variety of cheeses and sliced peppers, onions, etc.

This recipe was amazing!  We also tried it with 2.5 lb chuck roast instead.  We also omitted the bay leaf.  It has become our favorite meal, and we have recommended it to family and friends!

I totally dumbed this recipe down. I cooked a 3 lb. roast with one Italian dressing packet and about 5 oz. of beef broth thrown on top of the roast in the slow cooker. I cooked it on high for 5 hours and low for 1 hour. It shredded easily. I served it on sub rolls with provolone cheese and pepper rings. My husband liked it very much! I thought it was good too! I will make this again.

Wow this was good, but make sure you clean up the crock pot right away, it stinks up the house if you let it sit around to cool! I put some geriardona peppers and provolone on top then broiled in french rolls, these were amazing!

I wouldn't say this tastes as good as a Chicago Style Italian Beef but it was a pretty good recipe.  We put it on thick, crusty buns with Provolone Cheese and topped with Giardianare Pepper Mix.  We will make again.

This was awesome! I did use two packages of the dry italian mix, which I think is a must for flavor.  I cooked beef until it was tender enough to slice, instead of shred, then placed it back in the juice to complete cooking.  Served with hoagie buns, banana peppers and onions.

i've never heard of an italian beef sandwich before, but i had a rump roast and didn't know what i wanted to do with it. i'm a stay-at-home mom right now and i cook A LOT, but my fiance actually said that this was probably his favorite thing i've ever made. these really were delicious. i used a 2.5lb roast and it took about 7 hours in the slow cooker. the only thing i did differently was add 3 beef bouillion cubes to the sauce and used provolone cheese. i did drain the meat, but we used the sauce as an au jus for dipping. thank you so much for this recipe!

This is soooo YUMMY! Everyone loved this. We added this to regular recipe rotation. I use a 2 to a 2 1/2 pound chuck roast and I use the amount of spices the recipe calls for.

I used the suggestions of many reviewers, used the boneless butt roast I had in the freezer, and made the whole family quite happy with this one!

Although my roast was only 2.5lbs, I did use the entire pack of italian dressing mix as well as adding extra seasonings from my cupboard.  After 8hrs on low I shredded the meat, dumped about half the leftover juice (remember my roast was half the size called for) and put the shredded meat back into the remaining juices for the last hour and a half.  The meat was tender beyond belief and FULL of flavor.

I served this "make your own" style.  I got some wonderful bakery fresh wheat hogie rolls, offered sauteed mushrooms, sauteed purple onions, and grilled green bell peppers as toppings and then turned on the broiler to "toast" the shredded "pizza blend" cheese I picked up to top it all off with.

This recipe (with the suggested adjustments) is a HUGE WINNER in our book.  Next time we have decided we want to try other toppers too.  Maybe tomatoes or peppercini peppers or grilled squash slices!

Delicious!  I used chuck roast and cooked it on low while I was at work.  When I got home I turned it up to high for the final hour of cooking and it shredded beautifully.  The flavor was great.  I meant to use beef broth for the water and didn't so next time I will do that.  I put the beef on toasted buns, covered them with provolone and broiled them.  They were great!

Very good recipe, especially for feeding a small crowd when you're too busy to cook. I made this for Sunday lunch after church for the whole family, including my grown children and three grandchildren. None of us had a clue how Italian Beef should taste, since we've never had it before, but in general it was well-received. Using some of the suggestions here, I substituted beef broth for the water, and used boneless chuck roast. Next time I'll use a smaller roast...5 pounds made way more than 10 servings. I also added a 16 oz jar of mild peppers. It was still a bit bland, though, so I think I may double the garlic powder and black pepper next time. This will definitely be in my keeper file. Thanks, Maureen!

I first had Italian beef sandwiches in Chicago and could not get enough of them. This recipe is the closest that I have found to what I had there. Thanks for this easy and great tasting recipe.

Loved, loved, loved it.  Very nice flavor.  I added about 1/2-3/4 cup of beef broth because I had a large roast and wanted it mostly covered.  Wonderful flavor!  We ate it with rosemary potatoes and really enjoyed it.

Thanks for sharing.

Because of the rave reviews I thought it was going to be a phenominal recipe but it ws just okay. Next time I would probably add more spices and put the green pepper in the pot to give it a little stronger flavor.

This was great!!! I had a london broil on hand, so used that. The meat was so tender it just fell apart. Served in on french rolls with provolone cheese. Really, really good.

YUMMY YUMMY! Smells so good and easy to prep. I too used beef broth instead of water, and the chuck roast. It shredded so easily! Thanks for an awesome recipe. Will be a staple in our home!

I should've followed the suggestions of the other reviewers but I felt that in order to fairly rate this recipe, I needed to actually follow the exact recipe. This tasted like a regular pot roast meal. It was pretty bland and my husband asked if I put any spices on it! The only thing that really "saved" the sandwich, were the jalapenos and provolone cheese I melted on to the sandwich. I would probably try to make this again but next time will use the beef broth and TWO packets of the Italian Seasoning mix.

I made this recipe to serve 20 people. it was excellent and praised by ALL. i suggest serving it with hard rolls, mozarella cheese, and banana peppers. 

i'm not sure if making so much was the cause, but i had about 3 cups too much liquid in mine. after spooning out the extra, it was the perfect consistency for serving. i would recommend this recipe to anyone.

I made a Chicago boy feel like he was home! Followed other posts to reduce salt and add beef broth. Served the beef on top of an Italian link and his whole family was in heaven! I'm making them again today for the big game. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I make a similar version but Hot and Spicy.  In addition to the salad dressing mix, I use beef consomme, pepproncini and 12 oz. of Italian giardinera (drained)--hot or mild or 1/2 hot and 1/2 mild--.  This is VERY hot and spicy!

So delicious and tender! We drizzled the juice over the shredded beef, like au jus.  It's good served with roasted peppers and onions. Watch out: 3 cups was way too much liquid for our slow cooker, and it spilled over!  2 cups of water is sufficient.

I thought this was pretty good, my husband wanted a second sandwich the next day which is always a good sign as he's not a huge leftovers fan. I made changes as others suggested (beef broth, no extra salt, onion powder instead of salt). My dislike of the recipe is in using the salad packets, there is so much sodium in them and I'd like to find a recipe that uses just the spices, not something pre-packaged so I can better control the salt. However it was pretty tasty meat! Updated: I have since made this multiple times since my husband likes it so much, and it is very good and very easy (guess I'm over the salad packet sodium level for this recipe). We always get several meals out of this so I love that as well!

My son liked it better than I did. I think my expectations were set too high. I  found the meat to be less tender than I anticipated (low - 11 hrs) and it lacked the flavour I was expecting. I topped it in the sandwich with green/red peppers done under the broiler as well as sauteed onion and melted provolone in a toasted sesame seed bun. I'll do it again - but next time, double-up in the spices and slow cook the full 12 hrs.

I made this for the game for my husband and his friends and they loved it!!  My husband has actually claimed it as his all-time favorite recipe which is a big deal since up until now, it was something his mother made!!  I did make some of the alterations suggested by others.  I used beef broth in place of water and 2 packets of salad dressing mix.  This will be a regular recipe for us!  THANK YOU!

Used a 2.5lb roast and beef broth instead of water but otherwise followed all the measurements exactly. By the time it was done cooking (did pull it out 2 hrs before done, shred the meat and put it back in) the meat had soaked up all the liquid and it was super moist and flavorful. Really good.

Easy recipe, and the kids enjoyed it. My husband, who is from Chicago, didn't think it merited 5 stars for being "authentic" Chicago cuisine (whatever that is; I'm from Florida!)Good for a cool fall evening, or a day when you're not going to have much time to fix dinner.

Wow - this was sooo good.  I can't believe how effortless it was.  It made my house smell great while cooking.  When it was done I did as recommended and put the meat on a hoagie bun, covered it with cheese and put it in the oven.  It was great and my boyfriend loved it.

The taste of this beef was very good.  However, my rump roast did not shred apart. I had to slice it thin. Maybe I did not cook it long enough.

I made the recipe as stated and thought it was fine. If you're watching your sodium intake or prefer things less salty, make it as per the recipe first. I did shred it in the crockpot and let it continue on low so that all the meat would soak in the juices. I cooked this for my mother and she raved about it. I bring her meals up for the week and this is her new favorite. Goes very well with the provolone and crusty bread as suggested.

This is so flippin awesome and I swear it's even better the next day.  I use the zesty Italian dressing mix and double it.  Add the melted provolone, sauteed peppers and onions and a little mayo.  Great with a beer.

I used other's suggestions and increased the seasoning to 2 pkgs and used low-salt beef broth for the water. After I shredded the beef, I continued cooking on low for a while. It was even better the next day. Will make this again.

The flavors of this were great.  I sliced the beef very thin and made sandwiches with melted provolone on crusty rolls.  I might use some beef broth next time instead of water.  I think it would make a nice aujus.

Smelled great cooking and the meat came out perfect.  Only thing was it didn't hold much of the flavor.  Everything else about it was great.  Of course taste is most important.

Made this ahead of time for a casual family gathering and it's been made several times over by myself and other family members because it is so easy and tasty!  Almost any roast will do...beef or pork.  We've even combined the two meats together.  I use one can beef broth in place of the water, and omit the salt and bay leaf.

This recipe is a 3 and a half star as is.  Please read the reviews and incorporate some of the ideas into yours.  I got a 5 star from my family by using beef broth (2 cups) plus 1 cup water, 2 packets of Italian seasoning, onion and garlic powder sans salt, a 3.5 pound Chuck Roast, basil/oregano as listed and Mozzerala cheese melted on top of Big Box Mart bakery sub buns.  On the side I had mustard, mayo, horseradish, sweet roasted peppers, pepperonci's and au jus from the roast.  Let everyone build their own and everyone will be happy.  

If you want a "true" italian beef go to Chicago.  
Thanks Maureen.  Awesome recipe.

It's not Mr. Beef, but it was pretty good.  The sauce had a nice flavor, complex but not overbearing.  Unfortunately, my roast was a bit dry, I may try this recipe in a pressure cooker or with a different cut of beef.

Thank you for a fantastic recipe!!!  This was such a hit!!!  The meat was so flavorful and tender.... I filled a hardroll with the meat - topped it with a slice of mozarella cheese and toasted it in the toaster oven!  Heaven on earth!!!! Thank you Maureen

This recipe was so good and so easy!  When my husband came home he said the house smelled great!  He thought it smelled like homemade sauce!  Anyway, everyone loved the beef and I intend to put the leftover meat and drippings into homemade meat sauce.  I use Meaty Spaghetti Sauce recipe from this site and it's delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Not bad, not fantastic.  I shredded the beef and then made gravy out of the broth, to be served over mashed potatoes.  It looked very unappetizing.  When I put it on the table my husband said to our 3 year old "shape up or you'll get seconds". It didn't taste as bad as it looked, and my 10 month old scarfed it down like he hadn't eaten in days. I will serve the leftovers on buns with provolone cheese  and maybe some horseradish/mayo sauce as suggested and I think they will be very good.  I just don't think I'm a big fan of anything that comes out of a crock pot. Maybe I cooked it too long???

We used 40 pounds of chuck roast for my grandson's graduation party and it was great!   We also used the Zesty Italian seasoning plus Italian Dressing (replace some of the water) to marinate the meat.  We just doubled the recipe for the marinade.  It worked great because the meat was cooked by morning and all we had to do the day of the party is pull the meat.  I will be using it for a Croptoberfest event this fall too.  It was all gone!  We served an Italian Pasta Salad and fruit with it.

This is an easy, delicious and tasty recipe.  I recommend this highly.The taste is similar to Italian Beef Sandwiches I enjoyed while living in Chicago.

I added a 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red peppers for a little kick.  Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe is a regular in our house.  I use real onion and in addition, I add some jalapenos in to cook for some spice, and banana peppers on top of the sandwich for a kick.  Pork Loin is a wonderful substitute for this meat, which can also be BBQ'ed.

This was tender and flavorfull.  I cut the recipie in half except for the soup mix I used a whole pack of good seasoning garlic and basil. Threw in red potatoes and carrots. Served it as a roast, then the next day I shreaded it, put shredded cheddar (it was all I had) on top, and I couldn't get enough!  My b.f. even raved.

This was sooo good. I also didn't include the italian dressing, just the beef bullion and seasonings. I made it for my husband for a Sunday dinner, and we just couldn't believe how delicious it was. I thought I made too much for just 2 people, but glad we did, because we ate it for a few days and didn't tire of it!! We're making it this weekend for friends and can't wait to hear the mmmmmm's!!!

I've made this twice in 1 week.  It's awesome.  I used beef broth and red wine instead of water.  Used a whole pkg of dressing mix for 1/2 recipe, used fresh onion, 1 clove fresh garlic & a dash of Italian seasonings.  I also shredded it at least an hour before serving on toasted rolls w/ melted Provolone.  Served w/ a side of buttered noodles.  You can't go wrong!

This was out of this world yummy!!!  I made this for my open house Christmas Eve and there was a single spoonful worth of leftovers!  I took advise from others and used the beef broth instead of water and used 2 packs of Italian dressing.  I only had onion powder on hand, so I used onion powder along with substituting garlic salt in to get the salt content right.  I did slice the roast a few hours into cooking to allow the flavours to soak through all of the meat...really turned out wonderful!!!

We loved this recipe, the only thing I changed was the meat.  I used a bottom round roast and when the meat was done, took it out and sliced it thin and put it back in the slow cooker and cooked till tender.  Yummy turned out perfect!

Very, very, Very Good!  My family loved this.  It was great with some swiss cheese on hard rolls!  The juice had a really great flavor and was perfect over the mashed potatoes!  This is a keeper in my house!  Thanks for sharing!

VERY good.  Use the juices to dip your sandwich in.  Also good to warm up the next day with barbecue sauce on it.

This is a good fall/winter meal.  I used beef broth instead of water, which was a good choice.  I topped the bottom half of crusty rolls with the meat, roasted red peppers and provolone cheese, and broiled them in the toaster oven for a few minutes.  The peppers and cheese, along with a little mayo spread on the top half of the rolls, really made the sandwiches.  They might be a bit bland without the toppings.

Pretty good and reasonably versatile.  I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic and half an onion instead of the dried stuff.  However, 3 cups is too much water for a slow cooker; much of the flavor ended up in the broth.  Leftovers ended up in hash and beef soup (had to do something with that broth).

Yummy!  I used the whole packet of italian dressing mix even though I had a much smaller roast.  I served on toasted potato hogie buns with a slice of melted provolone.

EXCELLENT!!  I have also made this as a traditional roast adding carrots, potatoes, onions, etc. into the slow cooker.  I was worried that the meat wasn't "seared" first but it didn't matter.  It was so tender and had a great flavor.

The flavor was great(a little salty).  I didn't think this was sandwich meat though.  While eating it, I was wishing I had added potatoes and carrots and just made a pot roast out of it.  Before trying that I will probably make it again adding the onion and green peppers that others suggested.  Maybe that will make it seem more like a sandwich.

Awesome - I used a Top Round Roast (all I could find).  Wish I doubled the recipe, we couldn't get enough of this.  Used some of the left overs to make Beef Stroganoff.  Will definitely be making this repeatedly.

This was fabulous!  I made it for my in-laws and they thought it was wonderful.  I ended up putting it in the crockpot and cooking it on low before I went to bed and we had it for an early dinner the next day, so it cooked for about 16 hours total.  I also sliced an onion and cooked it with the roast, which I think made a nice addition.

my hubby was skeptical when i told him what we were having, but he loved this sandwich.  my roast didn't shread well, so it was more like chunks.  i didn't use all the spices called for because i didn't have on hand & subbed beef broth for the water.  Served on toasted hoagie roll w/ cheese & pepperchinis.  defintely will make again and try other topping suggestions.

This is a great recipe! However, I replaced the water with a can of lo-salt beef broth. Also, before serving, I boil about a cup of the juices with sliced pepperocinis to pour on top. Awesome!

Great recipe!! My husband loved it and wanted all the left overs. I used one can of beef broth in place of some of the water. I doubled the seasonings and let the meat simmer a bit after it was shreded.Ate it on toasted hoagie buns with melted mozzarella cheese.We used the juice for dipping.Lots of flavor!

This was very good.  I used a frozen moose shoulder roast which is the toughest piece.  I cooked it on low for 15 hours in the slow cooker until it was falling apart.  The cooking time was probably increased by 2-3 hours because it was frozen.  Very flavourful and tender.  Hubby loved it.  Thanks, Michele, Cambridge ontario

The flavor of the beef was delicious.  I will definitely make again.  I only used a 2 1/2 lb rump roast which made about 7 sandwiches...I will definitely use a bigger roast next time I make it.  This would taste great for a Super Bowl Party.

This made my home smell soooo good while cooking, so my expectations were very high.  Unfortunately I was disappointed with this recipe as I found the meat to be rather bland (although it was very tender. I think I will whip up a batch of my barbeque sauce and use the meat for BBQ sandwiches instead of eating as is.

This recipe made really tender meat, but as others said, it wasn't that flavorful.  I don't have the knack of adding a 'little of this' and a 'little of that,' so I think I'll keep looking for another recipe.

This was pretty good but not as flavorful as I hoped.  The meat did turn out really tender.  I also melted provolone and added some peppers to the sandwich and that added a little extra kick.

I used 2 cups of lower sodium beef broth in place of the water. I added green peppers and onions when i first started it. The meat was so easy to shred for the sandwiches. I cooked it for 10 hrs on low.I would make this again but i think i would use regular beef broth.

This recipe was fabulous, with just the right amount of spicyness! My husband proclaimed that it is one of his favorite meals that I've made. I used a 2.5 lb rump roast for the two of us, and the cooking time was still appropriate. Yum!

After reading the reviews, I expected this to taste better. I grew up in Chicago, this did not remind me of a true Chicago beef sandwhich. It had no flavor. My husband thought it was really bland. He added mayo to his. I added chedder cheese to mine. All in all this was o.k. but nothing great.

I thought this was good, my husband really liked it (he is not a big roas fan).  I just made gravy and we ate it like a regular roast.  It was tender , moist and tasty

Spices smell great, but the beef had incorporated little of the flavor.  The recipe makes good sandwiches with the peppers and a bit of horseradish.

This is so good. I serve it on french rolls with bell peppers and cheese. I also add a can of beef broth (I saw it recommended in another review). I make this recipe for my family all the time. Everyone loves it!

Excellent for sandwiches.  I only had a 3 lb. roast:( but it still was yummy.  I used a can of beef broth in place of some of the water.  The seasonings were a little too much.  I actually wiped some off the side of the s.c. when I took the meat out to shred.  Good tasting recipe.

I have to admit that this was an easy dish to prepare but what I want to know is where have you guys gotten your beefs? This DID NOT taste EXACTLY like a Chicago Style beef but for someone who does not know a good beef from a bad one it was OK.

This was great !! I used a can of beef broth in part of the 3 cups of water. The only change i'd make is to cut back on the salt a bit. Will definately make again.

This recipe was really tasty! I couldn't really tell it was an italian flavored beef sandwhich though. My husband and I really enjoyed it except I used beef broth in replace of the water for extra flavor and it turned out wonderful.  I also cooked it about 16 to 17 hours instead of the recommended 10-12 hours. Very quick meal for the working person! Kaiser rolls worked good too!  Thanks for the recipe.

I have been making this Italian beef recipe for over a year now. It is the best! Very similiar to what you get in Chicago. The next best thing to this recipe is being in Chicago eating one. It is very easy to prepare. I kick it up a notch and add extra pack or two of Italian dressing mix. I have also incresed the spices as listed in the recipe. Make a big batch and have dinners for days. Even better on second day.
