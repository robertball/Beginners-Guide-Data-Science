If you ever want a laugh, spend some time on AllRecipes browsing all of the different peanut butter sandwich combinations.  I love how many different "weird" sandwiches were family favorites, and considered totally normal!  Ours was this one, with a slice or two of american cheese added.  Use real mayonnaise, and super-crisp iceberg lettuce.  For some reason, this has always appealed to me on the kind of not-so-good mornings that sometimes come after really, really good nights out.  I think it's the combination of the rich, salty mayo and cheese, the sweet peanut butter and the crisp lettuce.  Just seems to hit all the right spots.

My absolute, most favorite sandwich. When I was in labor with my 19 year old, the doctor asked what the last thing I had eaten. Of course, it was peanut butter and mayonnaise. He replied that pregnant women eat the strangest things. My DH told him I ate it even when not pregnant. I think it grossed the doc out.

I was speechless when I saw this recipe, I had to call my  husband in to see it!  I have been telling him for years that we used to make these great sandwiches, but he never believed me.  I love them and this recipe is right on!  It does seem "all wrong" but it is great!  Thank you for bringing back some wonderful memories...I will start making them again!  Try them, you will be surprised and pleased.

This sandwich was just okay.  I was concerned about the combination of mayo and peanut butter but thought I'd give it a try.  Only got through 2 bites and that was enough for me.  I didn't think the mayo really added any real taste to the sandwich.  I didn't like the lettuce and peanut butter combo.  My son even gave it a try but after 2 bites he wasn't going to finish it.

My mother introduced this sandwich to me when I was just a kid (about 8).  It was a depression era recipe for something nutritional and cheap.  To this day it is my favorite sandwich.  The original recipe she used on me was peanut butter, Miracle Whip, lettuce and tomatoe.  Sounds discusting but I used to take it to school for lunch and all my friends that tried it loved it.

this just sounds so wrong. I couldn't bring myself to try but a friend of mine liked it. She did creamy peanut butter, i couldn't imagine crunchy. I do like peanut butter & pickles. lol

I made this sandwich as a joke, because my son and I thought the recipe was hilarious. And yeah, it tastes like white bread with peanut butter, mayo and lettuce...exactly as you would expect. I won't make it again, but we did get a good laugh out of it. ROFL; LMAO; LOL

Haha~ I didn't know anyone else made these :o) My mom will be thrilled. So honestly if I hadn't had this sandwich as a child I would probably rate it ** but it's comfort food for me. Miracle whip is the way to go and crispy iceburg lettuce. I'm curious if it's a regional thing: I grew up in the Northwest & everyone here thinks it's disgusting. My family is from the Midwest & everyone seems to have grown up eating them there.

I have been making this sandwich for the past 20 years and my mom has been making this for the past 40 years.  It is a traditional sandwich in my family.  HOWEVER, that being said we only use Miracle Whip instead of mayo.  Mayo is way to bland for this and it does not compliament anything in this sandwich. (And I am a mayo fan.)  For those who do not like this sandwich.  Try it with the Whip and prepare to be plesantly suprised.

I would give 3.5 stars. It was good, but not amazing. It definitely helped to increase the amt of PB and Mayo, otherwise it didn't taste like much. Oh, and crisp romaine hearts work great versus watercress.  I would eat it again and am curious for my toddler to try it.

I have to agree with Shrubik - Miracle Whip is a VAST improvement over mayonnaise in this recipe.  The Miracle Whip adds a lot of flavor that the mayo lacks and compliments the peanut butter's taste very well.  This has been my favorite meatless sandwich since elementary school in the '50s and Mom said they began to appear in the mid-1930s when Kraft introduced Miracle Whip and Depression-weary folks were looking for something cheap to eat.

This sandwich sounds terrible, but when I was growing up, my family went on day trips to the Great Smoky Mountains and we always took a picnic lunch.  The highlight of the meal was peanut butter, mayonnaise, and raisin sandwiches.  Mom ground the raisins before adding them to the peanut butter and mayonnaise.  YUM!

My mom and my adult daughter both love this sandwich. I can't get up the nerve to try it, it just sounds wrong. But my mom has been eating these for 45 years, my brother, and even my grown kids eat these sandwiches all the time, so they must be really good. Yeah, even with the lettuce... as odd as that sounds. I was as surprised as the last reviewer to find this recipe posted, but my mom would be delighted! :)

My oldest brother started this in our family with our BLT's. You just put the peanut butter on 1 slice of toasted bread & mayo on the other slice. Yum! I was the only other family member to turn this into the preferred way to eat a BLT. I definitely recommend adding bacon & a thin slice of tomato.

hmmm....okay then...  surprisingly good.  Unusual but good.  My daughter who is 4 liked it and she added some sliced pickles.  Not as amazing as the other reviews but when the pantry is empty it'll be part of my menu.

I nearly fainted when I saw this - not because I thought it sounded bad, but because I grew up eating peanut butter sandwiches nearly the same way!!!  Not with mayo, but with Miracle Whip  (hurray for the other reviewer who thinks it's great, too!).  And - I kid you not - until I was a grown woman, I thought that this was how peanut butter sandwiches were made.  My husband thinks I'm totally off my nut and refuses to try it, but our three kids love it!  Three cheers for peanut butter and Miracle Whip!!!

I "discovered" this sandwich recipe in 1969 when I was a broke and hungry college student. It must be made with Hellman's original regular normal mayonnaise no modern p.c. mayo. And creamy Peter Pan Peanut Butter.  Crispy lettuce is good but not necessary. Very satisfying comfort food.  Another good PB sandwich is with Oscar Mayer Bologna and Velveeta cheese.

OMG!!!!   I thought my daughter was absolutly CRAZY this morning when she told me about this: it was 7:30 am, and I was making Cam (my daughter a PB&J for her lunch.  She walks into the kitchen and tells me that Grammie, (my mom) taught her to make sandwiches like Papa Wayne made them,  with peanut butter and SALAD.... she said that Papa Wayne taught Grammie and Aunt Cindy and Aunt Julie to make sandwiches this way:  "spread the peanut butter on the lettuce and put in on bread". I was pretty sure she was thinking of celery and peanut butter, so i dismissed it as her being imaginative.... UNTIL I ASkED MY MOM!!!!!   apparently, My Papa used to make this all the time for my mom and aunts.... who knew!!!!  My daughter loves it, and after trying it, i must say, its quite tasty!!!

I'd actually give this 2.5 stars if that were an option. I love all of these ingredients so I thought I might love this sandwich, too. I followed suggestions of using crunchy PB, very crisp lettuce and fresh bread. I took the first bite hoping for a life-altering experience... and was disappointed. There was nothing offensive about the taste or texture, but there also wasn't anything extraordinary. It left me lukewarm. Hence the 2.5 stars. *shrug* Can't please everyone, I guess.

GodivaGirl:  You beat me to posting this recipe, though we always called it "Peanut Butter, Lettuce, and Mayonnaise."  I grew up with this sandwich, and now my kids have, too.  They've asked for it often since they were old enough to ask (they're 12 and 14 now).  Even their friends at school like it.  Something to note: use very crisp lettuce, and use a generous amount of all ingredients - they should all be approximately equal.  A TBS of Mayo and PB are not enough, nor is two leaves of lettuce.  I'd say 2-3 TBS of the spreads and four leaves of lettuce.  Love love love this sandwich!

I am 65 and have been eating these since I was a kid. I still have them often and the addition of the lettace is good. I eat them when nothing else sounds good to me, it is a staple when I don't feel just right. MMM

I am 88 years old!  This has been my favorite sandwich of all time since I started grade school about a hundred years ago!  Okay, how about 83 years ago?  In fact, I want one right now, am able to make one here in my retirement home! YUM!!

I grew up eating this and loved it. Haven’t had it in years so thanks for the reminder. Another great family sandwich was peanut butter and sweet pickles (or sandwich spread, if you can find it). This will be my lunch tomorrow!!!

I grew up with this sandwich but my mom used Miracle Whip instead of Hellman's . I tried it this way and did not care for it. You should try the Miracle Whip instead, it is awesome!

Have them every now & then. Agree with those that mention the lettuce to be crisp iceberg, and miracle whip. Dill pickle chips added is perfect!

Who in the hell needs jelly? This sandwich is delicious! I tried it with the Miracle Whip because I don't have real mayo but that was ok because I read other comments and people said it tastes even better that way. Thanks for this recipe. Will be one of my veggie sandwiches from now on!

When I was a child this was normal to us. :) the only thing different that I think sends it over the edge into heaven is to add some thinly sliced sweet onion (vidalia, texas sweets, walla walla) so so good. I thought we were the only ones!

Like so many of my fellow cooks, I too grew up on this stuff. After browsing the comments if seems that the biggest controversy is whether to use mayo or M. Whip. Even a huge mayo fan/freak like me can allow that are some dishes where Whip is a better fit. What I can't allow though is the term "real mayo." I gotta a secret for ya kids...ALL mayo is real. If it isn't real....it isn't mayo! C'mon folks!

This is one of my favorite PB sandwiches of all times.  I have eaten it since I was about 6.  If I smell PB and Miracle Whip together (while kids are making their own sandwiches), I will have to make one or two of these up for my meal! Love, Love, Love!!!

The BEST sandwich ever! Real comfort food that we have enjoyed for the past 40 years. P&M must be made with real Mayonnaise such as Hellmans. I've made it with white, wheat, rye and italian bread and it has always been great.

This sandwich is delicious!! My dad has been eating them for years.  We always thought he was nuts.  I finally decided to give it a try and I had to call him to take it all back.  He isn't nuts after all!!  This is terrific and will be a regular for me.  Dad says he prefers Miracle Whip too, but I only had mayo on hand.  Will try with that next time.

I laughed when I saw this recipe.  Never in a million years would I have thought to put mayo and PB together!!  First thought was GROSS.  Then I remembered how I ate really strange things in growing up in Taiwan but they were delicious!!  So curiosity got the best of me.  I only had baby argula around which I think gave it a strange taste, but I still gobbled the whole sandwich up!  Next time I will try it with iceberg.   Everyone out there, don't judge til you try!!  Thanks for posting!

I was looking for something else when I came across this. I used to love this sandwich; only I add tomatoes. My kids thought it would be gross and discovered it's as yummy as a BLT(only healthier Mom). They are grown and still love this sandwich. Toasted or untoasted, if you like peanut butter, you will love this and may never go back to a traditional BLT.

After reading the reviews I had to try this. I could only get myself to take 2 bites. It was good but to weird for me.

I grew up eating these!  When I was a kid I just had the peanut butter and mayo, no lettuce.  Now as an adult, I like to have it with lettuce, tomato and alfalfa sprouts!  YUM!

I have never heard of this sandwich I actually came across this while doing a search for vegtables and since I love PB and I love miracle whip I thought what the heck its almost lunch I give it a go and its ok the only thing that I didnt like is that you can taste the two flavors they didnt combine to make one new flavor

Used to eat this as a kid, great sandwich.  Can't give it a 5 star because of the mayo and fat content.

I have to say I was skeptic about this sandwich. Who would have thought that it would taste good together? I used Miracle Whip, as I don't think I've ever had real mayonnaise. Something for me to look forward to when there is no one else at home! Thanks!

My family has always been teased for eating peanut butter and mayo sandwiches!  I'm relieved to find out that there are more of us "weird" people out there :)  We have never tried it with lettuce though, so we will look forward to that addition.  You MUST use REAL mayo (Best Foods) and San Francisco sourdough bread. It's divine.

I LOVE Peanut Butter and I am always trying to find new ways to eat it.  I enjoyed this sandwich though I recommend crunchy PB and adding a slice or two of ham or turkey.  Wish I would have had some pickles on hand to top it all off.
