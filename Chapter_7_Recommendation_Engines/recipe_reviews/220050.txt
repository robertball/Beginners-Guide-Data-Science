I'm giving it 4 stars because (1) it's really easy to make (2) it was different! The flavors weren't excellent, but definitely GOOD. I only used 1 lb of hamburger b/c that's what I had on hand (and make sure you season the hamburger even though that's not mentioned in the recipe). I had never tried the bean and bacon soup but it does have a nice smoky bacon flavor to it. I will make this recipe again, but next time I will use SHARP cheddar cheese and a bit more horseradish. It's  a good recipe!!!!
