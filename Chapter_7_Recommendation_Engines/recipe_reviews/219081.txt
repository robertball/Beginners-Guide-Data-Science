I was excited to try a new recipe, but nothing about these turned out. I have made hundreds of different cookies and this is the only recipe to ever be a complete failure.

Delicious hot from the oven! The sprinkling of sea salt really enhanced the chocolate flavor.

These came out exactly as stated in the recipe. I was worried because the batter was so gooey but once you refrigerate it it scoops fairly easily. I added pecans and the nuts and the salt really added a nice touch. They are very soft and gooey inside, almost undercooked but more like gooey melty chocolate. I am not a dark chocolate fan but these were delicious.

Loved these cookies, and so did the friends I shared them with.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  My only change was to eliminate the chocolate chips added at the end, and instead, added 1 cup Heath Toffee bits and 1 cup chopped pecans.   Soooo yummy!

HEAVENLY!! These cookies are simply perfect. The only changes I made was omitting the sea salt and chilling them for 30 minutes or longer. I had no problems with the consistency of the cookie batter. By far my most favorite cookie now; hard to stop after eating just one.

These were very, very rich!  They were easy to make and I followed the recipe exactly.  These cookies are best eaten warm, when the cookie inside is gooey.  Once they cool they are like a truffle candy!   If you're looking for a crisp cookie this is NOT the cookie for you.

Very Good, def needs alot of milk on the side. I had to use 1/2 cup of flour and finally got a great consistency. Also had to wait until COMPLETELY cooled to get them off cookie sheet without ruining the finish of them.

This is pretty easy to make, just follow the directions and do everything in order. The final result tastes like candy it's so sweet. I wish I put a little more sea salt on them and next time I will leave out the whole chips in the dough since the cookies were a little too sweet with them.
Now let me stress that the ingredient amounts are correct. You do NOT need more flour. If you had a problem is was probably in the way you melted the chocolate or because you tried to mix things out of order.

This recipe is a total and utter failure. I made this at my family's annual cookie bake and it was a disaster. I followed each step perfectly and these "cookies" turned out like a dough-ie mess. Silly me, I obeyed the ingredient measurements, although I thought it was strange that there is only 1/4 cup of flour...Maybe it should've been 1 1/4 cup flour...the "cookies" were runny and gooey. What a waste of time and money. Boooooo. Negative 5 stars.

These were fabulous!  I loved the truffle quality and the sea salt is so complimentary!!  If the batter is baking too thin let the batter harden a bit in the fridge.  I am definitely making these again!  I might try adding nuts next time.

These are a smash hit!  My tips would be 1) add 1/4 cup more flour, 2) refrigerate for at 20-30 minutes or more 3) make them uniform and round as possible since they do spread and they spread unevenly.  Making them look pretty was not easy but they taste like decadent truffles but in a cookie shape.  I sliced up caramels and garnished each cookie in the center with a caramel slice.

I made these for a cookie exchange and they were by far the most popular. Everyone wanted the recipe! Followed recipe exactly except for 2 small changes. used 3 tablespoons of butter instead of 2 only because my chocolate wasn't metling very evenly. Also after adding the chocolate chips let the dough chill for 45 minutes to an hour. The more solid the dough is the easier to ball up the dough so the cookies have a nice shape. Gooey inside and delicious with sea salt! Wonderful recipe

Great chocolate cookies. Only thing I recomend is the recipe calls to chill the batter, if you chill the batter in the refrigerators let it stand for a few mins before baking.

The taste of these cookies is absolutely decadent and the sea salt gives them that extra layer of flavor that is perfect.  However, you do have to chill them at least 30 minutes.  I read some of the other reviews and was apprehensive about overbaking them so I took them out right at 8 minutes.  I knew they would continue to cook on the baking stone so I only let them sit about 3 minutes before removing.  It is very difficult to remove these without ruining the look of them.  They are very soft and somewhat fragile until completely cool.  They are even better the next morning (stored in a covered container).  My biggest issue is that they are a lot of work for just 2 dozen cookies that taste great, but don't look beautiful.  If you want a decadent treat, go for it.  If you need to bake cookies for something, go for something just as tasty, but less labor-intensive!

They were delicious, although I made them to recipe for the first batch with the suggested added nuts and coconut, chilled in the fridge for 15 min, and they were still too runny and never did stiffen up enough after baking for only 8 minutes. The next time I ended up adding almost another whole 1/4 cup of flour to the mix after having mixed all ingredients together (nuts and coconut included). I then put it in the freezer for 15ish minutes till it was a little difficult to scoop and then baked them at 350 as directed on a lightly oiled cookie sheet but for 12-13 minutes, not 8, and they were perfect! Very soft and chewy, but not falling apart too much. I just watched them through the window until the looked like the recipe described regardless of the time -- beginning to crack and stiffen up but still soft. These cookies are really just brownies on a cookie sheet. They are FANTASTIC. My mom, husband and kids (and myself) LOVE them, and the dash of sea salt (which disappears while baking by the way) is absolutely perfect. Next time I want to try melting some Nutella in with the butter and chocolate chips haha. I'm excited about this recipe because now I understand how to make soft chewy cookies! Gooey batter + freezer chilling + baking! So good. PS -- when I say I made it to recipe, I didn't actually use the Ghirardelli chips listed, just regular semi-sweet chocolate chips from Aldi I think. Also I don't have a double boiler, I just melted on low in my smallest saucepan. :)

Saved this recipe at Christmas time. Didn't make them until Valentine's. mmmmmmm the dark chocolate mixed with the salty top. Sweet n Salty in each bite. I made mine a little bigger since I used my small cookie scoop so I had to bake a little longer but they came out perfect.

These are fabulously chocolaty and very rich.  Especially made for dark chocolate lovers!!!  Follow the directions exactly and don't be daunted by the gooey dough.  Bake as directed and get a big glass of cold milk to enjoy them with.

These are phenomenal!  Very rich and perfect for a true chocolate connaisseur like myself.  Gooey in the middle, just like a truffle.  I used hershey special dark chocolate chips instead b/c that is what I had in the house.   I melted them in the microwave w/butter. Chilled dough for 15 min. and cooled completely before removing from tray, just like it says.  Can't wait to share these w/others!

These are fantastic! I melted the chocolate in the microwave rather than a double boiler, which made the recipe super easy. I also added another 1/4 cup of flour and let cool in fridge about a half hour. Spooned easily onto parchment paper. I baked them a little longer than the recipe called for to ensure they were done, even though the recipe stresses to not over bake. I think this helped. They are a really rich cookie but so addicting! I really only recommend these for a chocoholic! :)

I made these last night to kick off my Christmas cookie baking.  They were really easy and other than melting the chocolate and chilling the batter, they didn't take much time at all.  I had a huge "Pound Plus" block of 54% Belgian dark chocolate from Trader Joe's, so I used 13 1-ounce squares (= 1 1/2 cups plus a little extra) of that instead of the 60% Godiva.  For the other 1/3 cup chocolate, I just used semi-sweet chocolate chips (also from Trader Joe's - I'm a walking advertisement for them).  
I chilled the first batch for about 15 minutes before dropping by tablespoons onto a baking sheet.  I baked them for 7 minutes, but they actually were over done at that time (I have a gas oven, so not sure if that makes a difference).  The next batch I chilled for about 30 minutes and they dropped more easily onto the sheet, and baked them for 6 minutes and they were PERFECT.  So soft and gooey inside!  They were pretty flat but I guess that's how they're supposed be with so little flour in them?  Didn't exactly look like the puffed-up cookies in Godiva's picture :)  But amazing nonetheless.  Sprinkled with sea salt AFTER so that the salt didn't melt, and it stayed on the cookies no problem.  To-die-for good.  Will definitely be making these again.

Amazing. Followed recipe exactly, then after we finished those off, made with regular semi-sweet chips (a bit sweeter) since I did not have another bag of 60% chips. I am a chewy brownie girl and these definitely satisfy the craving for brownies and cookies! MUST use sea salt!

I was SO looking forward to these cookies. They came out flat and TOO gooey. I will do this recipe again because I want it to work and next time  I'll double the flour. I did add pecans and that and the sea salt were the only redeeming flavor and textures that saved this from getting one star.

After reading other reviews I refrigerated the batter for about 30 minutes after add the chips/before scooping out onto the cookie sheets.  At that point I didn't have a problem scooping out the dough nor did it spread too much while baking.  I used less salt but found the salt really enhanced the flavor (and I am not normally fond of salt).  My other change was to add ~ 1/4 toasted chopped hazelnuts to half the batter.  We loved the cookies with or without the hazelnuts but my husband and I agreed the cookies were significantly better after they had completely cooled.

This is a great recipe. It's like a grown up version of the chocolate chip cookie.  I've made these four times now to bring to social functions. Each time mine was one of the first empty plates. The key really is to not over bake. Using a nonstick sheet or a silpat is also a big help.

So good, would definitely make again!  I was VERY nervous when the dough looked more like brownie batter!  But after refrigerating for 15 minutes it was perfect for scooping dough.  Mine were not as beautiful as the pictures, but still very, very tasty!

I've made it twice. This is a great recipe. I add some dry cherries, so so good!! A tip: place the batter when smooth in a piping bag, make the cookies with a round tip and fridge for 5-10 min. Then bake them as stated in the recipe.

Since I'm in high altitude, I added more flour and liquid with less sugar.  I ended up baking them at 365 for 9 minutes and totally turned them into a different cookie.  They were quite good this way but given how little flout they had to begin with I think I'll follow the recipe correctly next time.  Still great cookies.

WOW...I lessened the recipe to only 12.  I think that was a good and bad decision.  My husband and I LOVE these.  His response, "MMMMM."  This is a keeper.  They're great without the salt, even better with the salt!

These were very yummy, though the 60% choc chips were a bit too bittersweet for me. I would make them again but I would mix in regular semi-sweet chips at the end instead of more 60% chips.  Made the recipe just as stated, and the batter worked out fine, though don't chill it for too long before trying to mix the chips in or it will be too stiff!  I wouldn't say the gooey-ness reminded me of a truffle though, I thought they just seemed underdone, but they still tasted good if you're okay with that! I would also leave the salt off the top next time, and I usually love salt. Might try coarse sugar on top for the same look.

My daughter found this recipe and insisted that we make these for her cookie exchange in class-tomorrow!  Ingredients met the "safe" list.  The recipe doubles well.  I did add 1/8 to 1/4 cup more flour for the double batch.  If I could have chilled the dough longer it probably would have been fine too without the extra flour.  Thick brownie batter to soft fudge-like consistency. We did not have 60% Cacao chips, so I added a bit of dark baking cocoa to the dry ingredients.  I baked the cookies on parchment, and let stand on pan to cool a bit-perfect!  For topping, mixed coarse demerara cane sugar and coarse kosher salt 3:1.  My daughter has hid them from her sister and wants to make them again with either mint chips or top with crushed candy canes.  Fast versatile base.  Great for chocolate lovers and soft cookie fans!

I was so sad that these didn't turn out.  Even after chilling they spread out too much.  They have a good taste, but didn't stay together.  :(

These cookies are EXCELLENT!  I followed the recipe exactly, baked for 7 minutes and gobbled them up!!!  The sea salt is the perfect touch.

These are INCREDIBLE. I didn't have a double boiler, so I fashioned my own, and they STILL turned out awesome. My only suggestion is to cool the cookie dough for a bit longer than it suggests if your refrigerator isn't suuuper powerful - they'll turn out a bit prettier that way! Seriously though, amazing cookies, dude. I could eat a thousand of them.

Five Stars. I microwaved the Ghirardelli  bittersweet chocolate as directed on their package, and it turned out just right.  Truffles were delicious and enjoyed by all at the super bowl party! PS the mixture needs to be  refrigerated after rolling about 7 cookies; otherwise, it gets too gooey.

Made them for a fundraiser at work. They were a huge hit. Made them exactly as the recipe calls. I doubled the recipe and may have had them in the fridge for about 45 min before I scooped thm out and baked them. Turned out perfect! Thanks for an awesome recipe. Reminded me of a lava cake only in cookie form.

When I make these, I have to do triple batches. These have become the official snack of my boyfriend's office

These are so rich and chocolatey!  You REALLY have to like chocolate for these.  They're amazing warm and gooey from the oven, and the sea salt sprinkled on top is absolute perfection (I am on a sea salt kick right now anyway...).  Found that these were pretty much perfect at 350 degrees in a gas oven for 8 minutes, although the bottoms sometimes got stuck to the pan due to a chocolate chip that got stuck.  No one can tell from looking at the top, though.  Only negative here - SO VERY RICH one is almost too much, and these definitely won't travel well (was hoping to add to my Christmas cookie shipments to friends and family out of state).

I made the recipe as directed, except I melted chips using microwave.  It only made 18 cookies.  Next time I will scoop out the dough and the refrigerate for an hour before baking.  This time I chilled first and dough was hard to scoop out.  The batter was thick even before chilling.  I mixed by hand.   I don't know what people did to get runny batter.
Cookies are a very bittersweet chocolate flavor.  Not for everyone.  I will make again, maybe use white chocolate or semi sweet chips to stir in.  I will keep 60% as base.

This cookie will change your life! I made it exactly as written and they turned out soft & chewy even once cooled, with a dense chocolate flavor amplified by the sea salt. They came together quickly & with no fuss.  The recipe made about 2 dozen for me, so I generally double it now because 24 of these gems last almost no time. I have been asked to bring these to every party since I made them for a cookie exchange the first time. There were none left for party goers to take home since I only made the standard recipe!

So good! Will definitely be making these again soon! They didn't even last a day! I used spelt flour instead of regular flour so I added about 2 Tbsp more because the consistency of spelt flour is similar to whole wheat flour. I also had to bake them for about 11 minutes (my cookies were about 2 Tbsp). They were so soft and chewy! Yum!

Rich! Dark chocolatey! Amazing! I'm a huge fan of dark chocolate and salt together, and this cookie is a dream come true! My only criticism of this recipe is that it does NOT make 24 cookies unless you make the cookies tiny bit-sized drops. I made 2" round cookies and only got 16 out of the recipe. I would definitely double this recipe next time. I also changed the recipe just at the end where I mixed in  1/2 cup chopped walnuts, and only about 1/4 cup chocolate chips. The nuts are a must and is a great compliment to the salt!

Easy and addictive! Good thing for me that it doesn't make that many.
