This one's a keeper!  I made this tonight and my father, a discriminating (meaning picky) eater, declared it "wonderful"!  I used regular cooking brown rice, added a package of dry onion soup mix and cooked.  Added the beans, canned corn (that's what I had) and salsa after cooking.  I'd give this six stars if I could!

I didn't have quick-cooking rice, so I just cooked some brown rice and added the salsa, beans, and corn.  It tasted a little flat, so I added some chili powder and cumin - those really rounded out the flavor!

When I make a recipe for the first time, I always follow as it is written. I thought this was pretty good as written, hense giving it four stars. It was very easy to prepare! I did end up adding more salsa, and water, because I thought it was a little dry.  Next time I plan on adding some cumin and a can of green chiles, as I think it still needed something. I did use the Medium Pace, and might use hot next time as my husband and I like things spicy.

Ok, I apologize 1st. I made or used this recipe today. With several changes. But I liked the recipe and used it for my version.
 Used regular white rice, no black beans(didn't have any), 1 can of corn and onions and peppers. Put it all in the rice cooker. Put in the salsa and then added water to the correct line on the pot.
 So I know it is totally not this recipes version, And I will get the eye rolls, but I really feel both versions are great.
 Be nice to me...:)

Very good!  I sauteed 1/3 cup chopped onions in butter first, then added all the other ingredients.  Also, I used already cooked white rice.  I'll fix this again, for sure!

I just used salsa instead of picante sauce because they didn't have it at the grocery store. It was delicious!

Crunchy. Needed much more cook time and as a result it screwed up a meal:(    All the quick cook rice at our large grocery call for longer cook times.  I used Uncle Ben's instant brown rice which states 10 minutes.  If I make a gain I will cook it for 10 minutes from the start and add more water.
For those looking for Picante sauce it is where they sell the taco kits.  Your store should have it.

This was very good, my whole family loved it!  If you are going to use Uncle Bens "instant" brown rice, you will need more liquid and more cook time.  Here is what I did to make 6 servings: Bring 1.5 cups U.B. Instant brown rice, 2 cups water, and 3/4 of the jar of picante to a boil.  Then add the beans and corn, stir, cover, and cook on medium/low heat for 12 minutes, or until the water is absorbed. (I also doubled the corn to 1 cup). Great easy side dish!

We have been a huge fan of Pace® Picante Sauce for years.  This was so easy and delicious.  I left out the corn and beans and it was still great.  Why oh why did I not think of  this sooner?  

I can't imagine having to add other spices unless you're not using Pace® Picante Sauce.

Very good and simple. I used salsa instead of picante cause that is what I had. The only issue I had was 1/4 cup water wasn't enough. The rice was still a bit crunchy so I added another 1/4 cup and put on low heat for about 3 minutes then off heat for another 5. Turned out great!

Excellent dish!  I used salsa as I couldn't find Picante sauce, and added shrimp as well.  Made a great dinner!

I used regular brown rice and for the last 10 min of cooking added the salsa, beans and corn. A tasty and healthy side dish!

This is a good recipe. However it is not great for leftovers. The rice really absorbs all the liquid, so it's not great the second time around.
