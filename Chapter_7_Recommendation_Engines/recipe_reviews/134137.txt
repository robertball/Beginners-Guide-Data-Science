Amazing salmon recipe! I did not marinade the salmon because I was short on time, but otherwise I followed the recipe. I put the marinade in a jar and shook it to blend the oil and soy sauce, then poured it over the fish before broiling.  When the salmon was finished I crumbled it over a salad of baby spring greens, green peas, and mandarin oranges. I added more soy sauce and oil to the remaining marinade and used it as a dressing over the salad; it was delicious! I will make this again!

Quick, easy and delish!  Easy list of ingredients, plus the advantage of being able to marinate it up to 24 hours before, if necessary.   I baked my salmon at 400 degrees for about 12-15 minutes.  DH asked for seconds! Just be sure to line the pan with foil prior to baking or broiling.

This recipe was great, it allowed me to balance my busy day and still put a great meal on the table for my man. I would advise to not drizzle too much extra marinade on the fish as it will catch on fire while broiling. Otherwise, a great marinade and easy peasy.

This was really good. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I made some changes. I left out the oil and used orange juice instead. I also added some crushed ginger. Very yummy

I have never made salmon before so I was looking for an easy recipe. This marinade really made the dish! All the ingredients are things that I always have. I let my salmon marinade over night and all day and I'm not kidding this is the best salmon I have EVER had! It was so moist! I cooked it in the oven and broiled it the last few minutes to crisp it up. I forgot the lemon pepper but it was still delicious!

this was so easy to make and turned out really well. i didn't have any lemon pepper, so put in the juice of 1/2 a lemon and threw in some green onions i had in the fridge. it turned out great and was really simple... my boyfriend loved it.

Oh my goodness. So tasty.  As suggested by a reviewer i served over a bed of lettuce with peas and mandarin oranges and poured some marinade over the top.  It was the perfect flavor. We were all licking our plates.

Made this recipe using some Alaskan salmon caught by a friend.  Was looking for something easy, and using my existing pantry staples.  Not sure what the "salty" reviewer was talking about.  The marinade gave a subtle, sweet flavor, while still letting the natural salmon flavor come through.  Not at all salty.  Of course, I added twice as much garlic, and cooked the fish on the grill.  Served it with grilled asparagus.  Truly delicious, as the name says.  Will definitely be added to my recipe box!

Awesome.  Will def make again and again!  I baked at 400 for about 16 minutes and used salmon fillets- no skin.  Only marinaded about 3 hours (in a ziploc bag) and it was still wonderful.

I'm so pleased with this recipe Two pounds of salmon disappeared in one night (we're 3 people) and even my daughter, who claims to be "allergic" to fish, ate quite a bit. Only had time to marinate for 4 hours, but the flavor was outstanding. Very appropriately named, by the way! I will definitely be making this recipe many more times. Thank you for sharing!

Absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of broiling.  I baked at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes.  The salmon was so moist.  Just perfect.  Great flavor.  The best salmon I've ever prepared.

This was FANTASTIC and a big hit with hubby and son.  Was exceptional the next day over salad.  I did not have much time so I only had it marinating for a little over an hour and it was wonderful.  Thanks for sharing :)

This recipe was fantastic!  I never write reviews, but since this one had so few, I decided I must.  I used Splenda brown sugar--which was perfect.  Other recipes suggested that fish should be only be marianted for 30 minutes or less-- I let it sit for about 10 mintues before I cooked it.  I altered the baking:  I used skinless filets, placed on foil, poured in the mariande and wrapped tightly.  Placed on a baking pan and cooked for 20 minutes.  I then opened the foil and custom broiled at 350* for 6 minutes.  I served with jasmine rice and mango salsa (1 fresh diced mango, 2 cloves chopped garlic, handful of chopped cilantro, 1/2 diced red onion, and 1 T olive oil.  Healthy and Delicious!

This recipe was easy to scale down since I am the only one in the house that likes fish. This was a great way to cook up a single salmon fillet while the hubby and kids had cheeseburgers.   I pan fried for three minutes each side and it turned out great. When I scaled the recipe down to one serving it called for 1 tbsp brown sugar. This was a bit much for me so I think next time I will cut down to 1/2 tbsp and it will be a five star recipe!

fantastic! best salmon I've ever had. followed the directions exactly. even the pickiest eater in our house went crazy for it - woulda bought more salmon if I'd known he'd devour it. most definitely one for the repeat file.

I made this for Thanksgiving because my mother-in-law doesn't like turkey.  It was a big hit!  My mother-in-law couldn't stop talking about how delicious it was.  The only thing was that I put it under the broiler for only 7 minutes, and parts of it were burnt to a crisp. Next time, I will keep a closer eye on it, and I'm sure it will turn out beautifully. Thanks for a great recipe!

I had never made fresh salmon before, but my dad bought some, and never found time to make it. I found this recipe kind of late in the day, so I ended up marinating it overnight and we broiled it and had it for breakfast. I was worried because it didn't seem like much marinade, but it turned out great. I'll make it again!

Terrific flavor - I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Be sure to be careful with the marinade in the oven.  Some of mine leaked to the pan and burned badly - created some smoke.  You have to make sure as little as possible gets onto the pan.  Otherwise - awesome and easy and quick!

This recipe is just as the name states Delicious!  I'm not a big salmon fan, however this marinade gives it a wonderful sweet flavor.  I made the recipe just as listed, no changes.  Very good!

This was absolutely delicious! My husband wanted to order pizza because I came home late but I convinced him to wait for the salmon. Well he did not regret it! I made it with rice and Spanish black beans. Will definitely make this again! It was quick and easy!

Don't make salmon very often, this recipe is quick and easy using everyday ingredients, just put the salmon in the marinade early afternoon and into the oven at dinner. My family all liked it, will put in my recipe box.

I have never made salmon before and this recipe caught my eye. The best salmon I have ever had and I've tried salmon in quite a few restaurants! I didn't have the lemon pepper on hand and only marinated for about 5 hours. I cooked it on a cedar plank on the grill and served with the roasted vegetables submitted by Saundra on this site. So easy and delicious!!! Thank you!!

I marinaded about 8 hours and cooked it on an indoor grill. Absolutely delicious. My kids asked for it again a few nights later.

I have diligently struggled to prepare "good fish" to no avail until now! This recipe made me "queen for a day" in my house! I had it waiting for my husband when he got home and the look on his face when he saw that I had once again tried to make him fish was less than happy...but when he started eating it there was silence.....he ate the whole serving and said "This fish is good, I want more"! Thank You so much! I will make it again and again!

This was my first time preparing salmon and this was very easy. The taste is great as well. I used a half pound filet and about half the marinade with minor changes because of on hand ingredients. I used splenda brown sugar blend and subbed worcestershire sauce for soy sauce. No other changes. Thanks for a great recipe that is quick and so easy!

Wonderful flavor, not too much of anything.  I marinated my salmon overnight and then put it on the broiler for about 10 minutes.....it was perfect!    This will become a regular in our Alaskan home!

Recipe flavors were good but I wish more of the flavor had soaked thru the fish(it was marinated over night). Think it needs to be cooked in the marinade and then basted every so often while its cooking.

This salmon really surprised me!  So delicious!  I followed the recipe though took the advice of a reviewer and a tbsp of crushed ginger.  Wow!  Dynamite!  Served with roasted black sesame asparagus and a tomato/bell pepper/feta salad for a healthy, tasty meal!

This was so quick and easy to throw together and then to cook after a busy day.  I ended up marinating for just over 24 hours.  I left out the lemon pepper (I was out of it) but added a few splashes of lemon juice and some black pepper instead.  My whole family loved it and my 5 year old finished a whole portion (unheard of for him!).  I served with leftover brown rice and steamed broccoli for a dinner that was amazingly good, especially with such little prep and cooking time.

I only let the salmon marinate for two hours. Broiled at 500 for 10 mins. I mixed the marinate again but this time with less soy sauce and more sugar and used it as a salad dressing over baby greens and fresh green beans. VERY VERY Good!

This was delicious!  I only marinated for about 20 minutes, but I reserved some marinade and put on at the end of the broiling time.  The only thing I'll change next time is to not add so much olive oil.  Also, make sure you put foil on your pan first, and as one reviewer mentions, if you're broiling, don't put too much excess marinade on or it will start to burn.

Loved it ! !  and Salmon isn't my favorite.  I didn't have lemon pepper so added a teaspoon of lemon juice and some fresh ground pepper.  I did bake it but not that long as it was thin fillets. Will keep this one  and make again.

This was just okay in my book.  I marinated for about 4 hours, keeping the recipe as written as far as ingredients and broiling time. I thought it was rather dry but the rest of the family liked the flavor.  Served with rice and roasted brussel sprouts and sweet potatoes.

Very easy and tastes great. I added some zucchini, and onions to the marinade and cooked them along side with the salmon. They came out perfect and I served it along some white Basmati rice. Definitely will make this again.

This recipe was absolutely amazing!!!  My husband and I are trying to eat better and it starts with what I cook. We're not much of a salmon people but everyone says it is so good for you.  And my husband is very picky and not usually up for trying new foods.  But when I ate this salmon he loved it and even asked for seconds.  It was so easy to just mix the ingredients together and let it sit in the refrigerator during the day.  And it cooked so quickly and had a nice sweet crust!!!  This is definately going to be a regular dinner in our house now.

Very good.  I marinated overnight.  Family thought it was a bit too sweet.  Perhaps I marinated too long.  I will try it again, but will tweak the ingredients to be more to our liking.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Yes, the description is accurate.  Very easy to make and very delicious!  I was only able to marinate 2.5 hours and it was still good.  Looking foward to seeing what it tastes like marinated the full time!

I used 1/4 cup of honey instead of sugar and added some lemon juice. I served it with garlic mash, sautéed mushrooms and asparagus, whole baby corn. What a delicious meal. A real treat

This is very good, but I try and eliminate sugar and found a similar recipe using Maple Syrup rather than sugar.  Either are great, it is which ever fits your lifestyle best.

This was OK.  A little sweeter than I like my salmon to be.  I gave the filet the full ten minutes in the broiler and that was too long.

I marinated two fresh salmon steaks for around four hours, then drained off the excess marinade, then baked them in a glass oven dish at 400 degrees for approximately 30 minutes (I'm unfamiliar with cooking fish, and wanted to ensure that they were fully cooked), then broiled them for another 4 minutes to make a nice browned crust. We enjoyed the flavor very much, an fit was easy to prepare & cook. I will make this salmon recipe regularly. Thank you for the tasty recipe!

I've made this recipe dozens of times and it always is a hit with my family. Whether on the grill or from the oven, it is AMAZING and sooo easy to prepare. It's delicious, kid friendly and one that my guys ask for:) I usually serve it with rice and veggies with a bit of wasabi on the side. Definitely the best salmon recipe I've come across!

This was easy, used readily available ingredients, and delicious, though next time I may go a touch lighter on the soy sauce since this seemed right on the edge of too salty. We'll be repeating this one indefinitely.

This was so good on my Salmon at lunch, I made up more and marinated my pork steaks for dinner.  Got my kids to eat Salmon because it is slightly sweet and hubby loved it on the pork. I also sliced some onions to marinate and cook with the meat both times - delicious! 

I do think I will reduce sugar next time - I use organic cane sugar and it wouldn't all dissolve.  Heated the marinade in the microwave to help dissolve sugar, then chilled it before putting over meat.  I marinated the salmon about 30 mins and the pork for 2 hours - both were great.  Cooked the Salmon in some of the marinade but did not leave extra when cooking the pork.

Marinade was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added an extra clove of garlic.  We love garlic and next time I may use more.  I marinated the salmon for about 5 hours.  Our broiler is the bottom drawer kind, so I had difficulty timing the dish as there is no way to set a rack 6" from the heat and the only settings are high and low, and I didn't know what setting to use.  I ended up using low and it took about 13 minutes.  The other issue I had with the recipe was not knowing whether to broil skin side up or down.  Ended up doing skin down and it seemed to work out.  I served with the awesome Asparagus and Cashews recipe on this site and with jasmine rice.  We will definitely try this again, and marinate longer.

name says it all. I did forget to add the garlic but it was tasty enough without it. I added about a half cup of water to the marinate then boiled it until it reduced for a mighty tasty sauce. Served it with minute rice and a salad. took about 10 minutes from start to finish.

I tried this recipe for a quick dinner, and it was absolutely delicious! I was pushed for time, so I let the salmon marinade for about an hour in a Ziploc bag. I then baked it for about 15 minutes in a 400 degree oven. I served it on a plate of Jasmine rice and steamed vegetables. My kids loved it and it was super easy.

From this recipe, I derived my signature salmon recipe - which is the easiest, most amazing salmon you will ever eat!! I buy large salmon filet at costco, and then use the following sauce mixture:  1/2-cup soy sauce, 1/2-cup brown sugar, 1/2-cup olive oil, juice of 2 lemons, and 6+ cloves (1/2 head or more) of minced garlic. Put the salmon on a greased cookie sheet and pour the sauce over the salmon - either a couple hours before cooking, or right before it goes in the oven. Bake at 350 in convection for 20-30 minutes (when the salmon flakes, its done). Cut the salmon into serving peices and baste the peices with the extra sauce. Serve with basmati rice (1-cup rice, 1-cup water, 1 chicken bouillion cube, 1/4-cup water) and steamed peas. The extra sauce is amazing drizzled over the rice!

This is the best salmon I have ever made, the best I've ever eaten! I made this paleo-friendly by substituting coconut aminos for the soy sauce and date sugar for the brown sugar. I don't want to even try it any other way because this was soo perfectly delicious. I'm not a huge fan of salmon but my son is. We both agreed that this was great! I searched it with garlic mashed cauliflower and ginger-garlic broccoli (I have a lot of garlic right now).

Served with white rice, and a stir fry of red pepper, white onion, and zucchini. I didn't let my broiler hit the heat it needed to... in the future I will go safe with 350 for 12-15 and check it at the 12 minute mark so I don't end up with dry fish.
Anyway, loved the flavor. Will use leftovers in a salad with mandarin oranges, cashews, an orange vinaigrette and green onions. nom nom nom...

I make salmon all of the time, and this is one of the simplest and tastiest recipe I have tried yet!  So moist and so tasty.  I did grill it rather than broil it.  Will make this many times again!

This salmon was delicious and super easy!  We only marinated it for a little over an hour and it was great but I think doing the full 4-8 hour marination will make it even better.

Really delicious.  I did 9 mins under the broiler (on HI - my oven).  Not too salty, nice light sweet note to the fish, and nicely flakey.  Cooked this skin side up and the skin just peeled off when finished baking.  Beautiful!

I made his recipe last night and the flavor was perfect!  I had it marinating for 8 hours and it is all simple ingredients that are already stocked in the kitchen.  The only problem I had was broiling the salmon.  I think because they were thick in depth that they were still rare in the middle after 10 mins.  I had to slice them open and broil for 5 more minutes.  Next time I will definitely bake them at 400 to secure the doneness.  But my dad never liked salmon and he made sure there was nothing leftover from anyone.  This is a permanent recipe in my rotation now.

I fixed this salmon for dinner last night. It was so good!! I baked in a 400 degree oven for 15 min. Will cut down to 12 or 13 minutes the next time I make it. The marinade is awesome. I made a second batch of marinade to baste over the salmon before putting in the over and as a sauce to go on the fish while eating. It is delicious but it doesn't overpower the taste of the salmon at all . . . It truly enhances it!

Great Recipe! The flavor was wonderful; I generally don't cook much with soy sauce, but this worked. The salmon was moist. Like other reviews I served over rice.

Just as its name suggests, this recipe is delicious. I didn't have time to marinade the entire recommended 4 to 8 hours, so I just did a quick marinade and then broiled it with some of the marinade and it came out fantastic. Now my mouth is watering again just reviewing it!

Delicious Salmon is the perfect name! Wonderful Teriyaki flavor. I didn't have lemon pepper so I used lemon juice and pepper. I also only marinated it for a couple of hours. Perfect. I baked under the broiler for about 10 minutes and lined the deep dish I baked it in with aluminum foil for a quick easy clean up. I didn't discard the leftover marinade but poured it into a small pot and brought it to a boil then reduced with some cornstarch for a sauce to pour over the fish. Tasty. Will definitely be making this over and over. Oh and served it with Brown rice.  Thanks for sharing! It's fantastic! :)

Oh, wow! This is so good! The only thing I did differently was to add 1 tsp. ground ginger (I was only making for 2) and marinated it for over 24 hours. I then put in under the broiler for 5 minutes in a foil-lined pan, turned it and broiled it for another 5 minutes. The edges had this beautiful crispiness to them and it flaked beautifully. I think I'll have to make this over and over! Sorry, ate it too fast to take a picture of it.

I do not like salmon usually, but this was so yummy!  I would for sure marinate as long, if not longer then it says.  I tried not letting it marinate for long once and it was not the same... always in a hurry I am :)

The marinade is too heavy. Needed an acid to break it up.  Used OJ but even so it needs just more aromatics.  If I bother with this again, it would need fresh rosemary and probably fresh lemon zest instead of of lemon pepper. SOMETHING to break up the heaviness of the original marinade!

Made this exactly as written except I put it in a plastic bag to marinade, so I could move it around and turn it while in the fridge.  This was so delicious.  My husband was talking about how good it was hours after dinner.  Adding to my favorites now!

I make this like twice a week now! It’s delicious! However, I don’t use lemon pepper, I use fresh squeezed lemon juice and pepper. I also use minced garlic not garlic powder... at first I would bake these in a dish with the marinade poured over. Now I make the marinade into a sauce by simmering until it’s reduced enough and I pan sear the salmon and pour sauce over it. It’s amazing!

I followed the recipe to a T, the only thing I did differently is I baked it instead of broiling it at 375 for about 20 minutes. skin side down.

I’m not a big one for writing reviews but I had to for this one.  Ours only marinated for a little under 4 hours and we baked it, then broiled because it was a big serving.  My husband loved it and said twice during dinner that we are making it again. A couple days later while eating leftovers cold, he repeated his statement again.

Only changes I made:  1.  Instead of whisking all ingredients in a bowl, I mixed them all up in a large zip lock bag and put the fish flesh side down in the marinade to reduce clean-up. 	2. I baked at 400 degrees F for roughly 12 minutes instead of broiling.

We added 2tbs of honey. We did not have time to marinade so we seasoned and let sit for one hour. Then took the marinade leftover on the stove med heat. Added 1/4 cup water with 2 tbs cornstarch to thicken. Simmer for 15 minutes. Pour sauce over salmon. Excellent

I...don't like salmon. Never been a fan.  Hubby loves it though,  so I bought him some and found this recipe.  Only had time to marinate for 2 hours but he Loved it. I tried it too, and shockingly,  Really liked it! I definitely will be making this again and again and can't wait to try with the full marinating. Thank you!!!

This is really good. The marinade is extremely simple and was quick to prepare. My husband and daughter loved it. I will probably use this as my go to salmon recipe because you could bake or grill with this recipe. Thank you.

Fast and easy!  This got thrown together really quickly.  Because I was short on time I only marinated it for 3 hours but it was fabulous anyways.  I only used 1 tsp of lemon pepper because I wasn’t sure about using it at all, but it was okay, so next time I’ll use the full 2 tsps.  Will reserve some of the marinade next time to maybe drizzle over the salmon when serving. Can’t wait to make this again.

I was a little surprised by the flavor that comes when these ingredients are mixed together  As a few others said, it is a little on the salty side. In fact,  I think I would add less lemon pepper next time.  But, it has a great flavor!  I will be making this again.

Didn't realize the recipe called for the salmon to marinate so skipped that aspect. Instead Placed the salmon in the mixture flipped it over and then placed on a baking sheet inside a bowl I made from foil wrap. Added 2x the garlic. Baked and broiled equal time. Drizzled more marinade on it halfway through. Then I added a little bit of the remaining marinade to the rice when it was done. Why throw it out.?! Topped the fish with chopped green onion   The rice and salmon were the tits.

Made it almost as is. I didn't have any lemon pepper and used lemon juice and black pepper instead. Marinaded in the fridge for over 24 hours and cooked it in the oven at 190c for 16 minutes. Turned out perfect! Husband loved it with a bed of salad. Will definitely make again

Very easy and very delicious!  I also had no time to marinade so I just poured it over the fish and baked it at 400 for 18 mins (I had a large piece of fish).  I also didn't have any lemon pepper so instead I used one teaspoon of pepper and one teaspoon of lemon juice as a "why not?" alternative.  Sauce was amazing and fish was super tender!!!

We drain the marinade into a frying pan and reduce it until it thickens, then cook the salmon in the reduction, keeping a little to drizzle at serving. Yum!

Absolutely superb!!! First time cooking salmon so I was super careful. I ended up marinating it for about 18 hours and the salmon I bought was a little thick so after 8 minutes broiling it in my convection toaster oven I cut it in half since it wasn’t all the way cooked and baked it at 425 for another 5 minutes. Best salmon I ever had and for a guy who likes to dabble in cooking pretty proud of myself.

I love this recepie, I haven't made it with lemon pepper. I use lemon juice and black pepper. I also double the marinade and cook it in a foil pack till done. then I open it and cook it under the broiler to carmelize the top. I serve the extra sauce over white rice. and for a side I make asparagus with sliced garlic and olive oil that I broil for about 10min.

I’ve made this several times and it’s always delicious. I put the marinade in a pan while the salmon is in the oven. Cook it down and add top the fish with it when it’s done. Beyond delicious! Hubby requests it frequently and I’ve made it several dinner parties and without fail at least one person requests the relics.

Great recipe.  The six inches from the heat source is probably a little too close.  After about 5 minutes, mine started to burn.

This was absolutely delicious! I didn’t have lemon pepper on hand so used about 1/2 tsp pepper and 1/2 tsp freshly squeezed lemon juice. Didn’t have time to marinate so just poured marinade over salmon pieces; baked at 400 for 10 minutes and then broiled in low for about 4 minutes to set the glaze. Heavenly!

OMG, this was the best salmon I've ever made.  I did have a thick piece so I had to cook it a couple minutes longer, but other than that everything was kept the same as stated in recipe.  Will make again!

My 16 year old son bought a box of wild-caught Alaska Salmon from a friend so we're trying different recipes out, this one was outstanding and will be going into our permanent recipe box. I prepared as directed, delicious.

I was hosting a company holiday dinner for 20+ people and made this without ever previously cooking based on the simplicity and the reviews.  It turned out excellent and I received many complements and requests for the recipe.  

Based on prior reviews and because I was cooking 5 1/2 lbs (2 very large pieces) of salmon I decided to (i) cut the salmon into smaller portion-sized servings before marinading and cooking, (ii) use half low-sodium soy sauce and only marinaded for about 60 minutes, and (iii) convection bake for 20-25 minutes and then broil for 5+ minutes at the end.  It turned out lovely and was a hit, plus the leftovers were also delicious on salads.

I follow the recipe exactly except usually use minced garlic in oil for convenience.  Easiest and best fish recipe ever, tastes better than most restaurant salmon.  My wife and daughter that aren't big fish eaters requests all the time for dinner now.

This Salmon Recipe is amazing i i have tryed it both ways marinating the salmon and not when i dont have time.. but i find that if you actually prep it the night before  aka the (sauce) it seems to gets a lil thicker and then apply it to your salmon the next day and let it sit for at least 4 to 5 hours.. it really is so good

Great recipe for salmon. I'm not usually a salmon eater, but this glaze recipe has converted me. I did not change a thing. I didn't use the broiler. I baked in oven at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes, time will vary due to thickness of fish.

I made it with no changes, definitely easy. I marinated for almost four hours. For me it was a mild taste and I would have liked it a bit sweeter (maybe next time I'll lower the soy and increase the sugar?).  Keep an eye on it during broiling! I had to cover the thin half with foil because that edge was close to burning. But yes I would make again, easy and good for company.

This marinade was the perfect balance of sweet and salty. Really delicious! I only marinated it for three hours, but it was still very flavorful. If you like sweet and salty, this recipe is for you.

I had to make sure I let those of you reading that you will not regret making this dish. For it to be so simple yet so flavorful is unheard of! I even ate the skin from the salmon which I rarely do but there was so much flavor in every bite. And this goes well with almost any side dish. Will definitely make this twice a month over the next few months as part of my meal prepping.

I made this but I only had time for the marinade to set for 3 hours. The one I made was a whole 1.5 pound fish. I baked it then broiled so the skin would be crispy. I added a little salt after the fish was cooked delicious.

I made this a few minutes ago because it included all of the ingredients that I had on hand. I was not able to marinate it so I lined my glass pan with foil placed my salmon in the pan and poured the marinade on top of it and broiled for 10 minutes uncovered. IT IS AMAZING! I sautéed frozen spinach and chopped carrots in coconut oil as accompaniments. I served this dish in a bowl with the salmon filet on top of the spinach and carrots and drizzled the marinade on everything. This is now my favorite way to prepare salmon!!!! ??????

This turned out great. The salmon was very tender and favorable.  Though next time I will probably use the low sodium soy sauce.

I didn't have time to marinate the salmon for more than a hour and a half, but it was still packed the salmon full of flavor.  This recipe is very simple and delicious.  I rated it down a star because it was a little bit too salty.  I have a suspicion that it had something to do with the store bought lemon pepper adding in extra salt.  Next time I would suggest making lemon pepper seasoning from scratch to avoid the extra salt.

I made this marinade for my salmon.  I only had about 3-4 hours to let it soak.  Turned out great.  Instead of cooking in the oven I pan seared it.  I like my salmon well done and this flavor was perfect.

I have used this marinade numerous times - I love it.  The only thing I do differently is to bake the salmon in the oven with the marinade and then thicken it slightly after removing the salmon  and use it as a sauce.

Awesome recipe indeed.  I followed the recipe with a few modifications:
- a few tablespoons of melted butter.
- slightly less soy sauce + teriyaki sauce
- slightly less brown sugar + a few tablespoons of honey
- only 45 mins of marinating in frig.
- half can of cream corn

I made this just as the recipe was written and it was delicious! Of course it helps to have a really awesome piece of salmon, but the marinade was great. I only had time to let it marinate for a couple of hours and it was still yummy! My family of 5 scarfed it down.  Will definitely add this to my normal rotation.

This was ok. I marinated the salmon overnight but found that it didn't really give it much flavour. Maybe if the salmon was baked in the marinade afterwards rather than being broiled it would pick up the flavours better? I also found the cooking time way off, but I did have a rather large fillet so I'm not blaming the recipe for that. Still 10mins for broiling even a normal sized fillet may not be enough. Produced a lovely salmon dish, I just wish the flavour of the marinade came through more on the fish. Edit - tried again but baked it in the marinade to try to bring the flavour through more, but unfortunately there wasn't much of a change. There are better salmon recipes out there, so I won't be trying this one again.

This was a very tasty recipe! I made it last minute so I only marinaded for 15-20 minutes but it was no problem. I didn't have lemon pepper so I added some lemon juice and ground pepper and I followed another suggestion to bake at 400 for about 20 minutes. The salmon was cooked perfectly and I will make this again without hesitation!

Made this for dinner tonight! Very yummy, my boyfriend who isn't a big salmon fan ate every bite! I added a sprinkle of chili powder and slight pinch of cayenne just to cut the sweet down a bit. Highly recommend, it was the perfect quick dinner served with rice and an arugula salad.

I did a 24hr marinade on my salmon. Also, baked it on 400 for 8 min, checked it. Then went for another 6min. It turned out perfectly flaky, and juicy!! I'll be making this again!!

Delicious! Only suggestion,  Bake first and then broil last few minutes or the top gets too burnt but the inside is not done. I paired with Minnesota  Wild Rice, the pairing gave it a 5 star rating.  Very complementary.  Will make again!  Husband loved too and he is fairly discriminating about food.  Thanks!

This has become my go to salmon recipe.  I've varied it a little depending on the ingredients I have but every time it has turned out perfect and my family loves it.  I serve it with brown rice & sweetened pumpkin seeds.

This was a great recipe! We don't care for lemon pepper, so I used orange juice and orange zest instead. I put it under the broiler for about 12 minutes but the excess marinade burned and made a lot of smoke. Next time I will bake it first and then finish it under the broiler. The leftovers were amazing! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Excellent! I was only able to marinate the salmon for a few hours.  I followed the instructions, but I did take the salmon out after 5 minutes and brush more marinade on top before finishing broiling. I served the salmon atop a bed of salad -- greens, tomatoes, peppers, fresh corn shaved off the cob, carrot slices, snow pea pods, craisins, sliced roasted almonds. It was so, so good. Three of us ate, and no one used any salad dressing. The salmon was so flavorful!!!  I will definitely be making this again soon!

AWESOME!!  Hubby brought home some freshly caught king salmon, so I thought this was worth a try to grill since it was too hot to cook inside.  I used reduced sodium soy sauce.  I put the salmon in a fish basket(or you could wrap in foil) and grilled over medium-low 5-8 min. per side or till fish flakes in thickest part.  YUM!

DELISH!  I added about 2 teaspoons of fresh ginger, and halved the brown sugar and with equal amounts of honey, it was so good.  The ginger added an oriental flair that I just love.

The whole family agreed this was definitely a redo. Very tasty. Didn't have time to marinade it but that might have helped the slight dryness.

This is a very nice and quick marinade. I did make a few modifications to fit our tastes. I added 1/2 sesame oil and 1/2 olive oil as I like the flavor of sesame a bit better. I only had a chance to let it sit for 1 hour but the flavor was great. I sautéed in a pan rather than broiling. I may try some fresh grated ginger in the marinade next time as well. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

Only had time to marinate for about 2 hours and the salmon still came out very flavorful! I added about a half tablespoon of Dijon mustard and some garlic powder to the marinade before adding the salmon.

Delicious is right!  The only alteration I made was to put some pats of butter onto the salmon before cooking in the broiler.  I'm not usually a huge salmon fan, but my wife picked up some while it was on sale and we decided to try this recipe, and it is without a doubt the best way I've ever had it!  Great recipe!

These were okay, nothing amazing but I eat a lot of seafood and salmon. Very simple recipe, I let maranade overnight. Followed recipe exactly except doubled the batch. It was nice for something different to try

I worried that the fish would not be cooked inside thoroughly but it was.  Broiling is definitely the way to go to get fish crispy on top and just right on the inside - moist - not overcooked/hard.  The only drawback was that I was left with a burnt pan afterwards - and I don't like using aluminum foil - soaking my pan right after I plated my fish helped.

This was pretty good.  I agree with the person who made the comment that it was a to salty. I would adjust the soy next time. Would work well on pretty much any fish.

I have never really liked salmon, although my husband and son do.  So I will occasionally cook it. I was looking for a different way to cook it when I found this recipe.  It is crazy good. I now have salmon once a week and it's one of my favorite meals.  thank you for sharing this recipe

I thought it was way too sweet. The brown sugar just overwhelmed the salmon and everything else. Not sure if I'll make this again but if I do I will definitely be cutting way back on the sugar.

This recipe was so easy.  I am NOT a Salmon lover but it is one of my husbands favorites.  I took a bite and it was absolutely fabulous.  I had broiler on high and my filet was not real thick so I went 7 min.  Have already emailed this to several friends.  Enjoy, this one is a WINNER!!

Maybe it was my fault, but I had issues with this recipe. It made my house so smoky I thought the fire alarm was going to go off! I used fillets with the skin on. I marinated them skin up and wasn't sure if I should cook them skin up too, so I did. Maybe that was the problem? It actually tasted pretty good though. Didn't blow my mind, but definitely not horrible.

We're always looking for new ways to cook salmon, and this is a great one to add to our rotation!  The sweetness of the brown sugar and saltiness of the soy sauce (we used low sodium) complements each other perfectly!  Very excited about this recipe.

Did not enjoy this at all. Luckily, the marinade didn't penatrate the salmon completely, so I just avoided the outer areas while eating it. Perhaps it was our soy sauce, but the marinade made this too salty, slightly bitter even, like a bad teriyaki.

This was the best salmon recipe I have every made.  I let it marinate for about 5 hours.  I did decide to bake at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes instead of broil.  I have heard broiling may dry out the fish more.  However, because this was marinating in olive oil for many hours it came out so moist, I couln't believe it.  My husband also agrees it was the best salmon he has every had.  It almost had the texture of Sea Bass!  It's a must try!

A simple, delicious departure from our usual lemon-pepper, quick fix salmon recipe.  A 15 minute meal (minus marinading time) with steamed baby broccoli. We are hooked on this!

OMG! This is so good. I usually am not a fan of any type of sweet glaze, but my daughter wanted "honey glazed" salmon on Christmas day and I found this. I should have doubled the recipe! It was gone in like five minutes!!!

I took a chance based on the high reviews and made this for company on Christmas day. It was amazing! I don't cook salmon often and am a bit scared of it, but this was pretty much the best salmon ever. I used low salt soy sauce but otherwise followed the recipe. I put it on a cookie sheet with wax paper into a 375 oven after I took out a roast, and it was perfect in about 15 minutes (it was on the thin side). I will definitely make this again.

I never cooked salmon and i was looking for a eady and delicious recipe....and they picked they right name. This was delicious and easy to make. I did add more brown sugar in case the soy sauce was over powering. Really delicious and easy recipe.

It was delicious, I would suggest to add less olive oil and add a tad bit more sugar.  To make it healthier, I substituted soy sauce for braggs liquid aminos, I also added the juice of one line and cooked to 145 degrees internal temp.  It was a hit!!

I had to tweak a few things because of time-crunch, and it still turned out fabulous! I had most of the ingredients, except for lemon pepper, in my kitchen. Substituted with 2 tsps lemon juice and 1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper. This was a last minute decision for dinner, so I didn't have time for 4 hr marinade. I let it marinade for about 20 minutes and baked it in a glass pan with the marinade at 450 for about 15 mins. My family (including teenagers and a picky 4 yr old) raved about this dish! They loved it so much that the kids didn't even complain about the spring mix and quinoa I served as sides, both of which are not popular with them. Easy and delicious...will definitely save this recipe!

I've made a lot of salmon in my day, but I think this is the new winner! No need to marinade.  Just mix ingredients, line a baking dish with foil. Broil 10 minutes, perfect!

Num num. Absolutely wonderful! This is the only way I can eat my salmon now! Though sometimes rather than just letting it marinade for the recommended four hours, I just broil the salmon in the marinade for just a little while longer and it turns out just as delicious.

This was my first time making salmon, and it turned out wonderful. I followed the recipe, except for letting the fish marinade. I didn't have more than an hour, but it was still wonderful.

This was great & easy to cook! I cooked it in a hurry & only marinated it for 2 hours. I can only imagine how good it tastes marinating over night.

This is the easiest & best salmon recipe ever! Everyone raves about it. We cook in packets on the grill and open the up at the end to let the edges get crusty. So, so good..

I didn't have lemon pepper for the marinade so I used fresh ground pepper instead, it was seriously the best salmon I've ever had. Such a fantastic recipe!

Absolutely love this recipe.  And I'm not a big salmon fan but made it for my boyfriend and we both loved it.  I only made 2 fillets and mixed up the marinade in a ziplock bag.  This made it much easier to marinate - just flip the bag from time to time.  I followed the recipe and didn't change any ingredients and it's fantastic as is!

This was wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly except scaled down and it was perfect.  I usually use the Baked Dijon Salmon recipe from this site but since I paid $20 for small piece of salmon I wanted to really taste the salmon. This marinade really let the flavor of the wild salmon shine. Now my only problem is choosing which recipe to use and being able to afford the salmon.

I have made quite a few salmon recipes and I just didn't love this one. Salmon is quite expensive, right now, so a recipe has to be just right. I marinated the salmon over-night. The directions did not say what temp. hi or low to turn the broiler. I chose high and after 3 minutes had to turn it to low to finish it the rest of the minutes. I accidentally bought skin on salmon, so I chose this recipe. I hate wasting money on a part of a fish I am not going to eat. To my surprise the skin created a lot of excess oil and splatter in the broiler I am not accustomed to with salmon. Even with such a short cook time the salmon ended up dry and way too flakey. It would be great to use in a recipe in a manner like tuna. The end note was too much of soy sauce or salt also. Not terrible, but just not a repeat method to broil salmon for me.

Excellent! Definitely do this all day or overnight and don't change a thing. Line the tray with foil.. The sugars make the sauce boil. I broiled mine about 8 inches away for 15 minutes. Perfectly cooked.

Use 1/2 cup lite soy sauce instead of 1/3 cup regular soy sauce. Use 1 tsp of lemon juice instead of lemon pepper. Reduce oil to 1/8 cup or 2 tbsp. bake with marinade in the dish

Just made this recipie and I must say it was wonderful. Only thing I toasted sesame seeds and placed them on top  and the combo of the soy sauce and brown sugar wonderfully paired. Even my son thats a picky eater ate it and asked for seconds deff would make this  over and over again.

I try to make good salmon all the time & it's just horrible, barely edible. Tried many recipes. This recipe was so easy & everybody asked for more. Only marinated for maybe an hour & a half. Next time I'll do it overnite. Everybody can't wait.

Love this! I make it at least once a week. I use about a tsp of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp black pepper, rub the filets with garlic powder, and 1/3 cup each sugar, oil, and soy sauce. Can't wait to try it on the grill this summer. Even my two year old loves it! Great recipe!

I really love salmon but I thought this recipe was rather salty and covered the natural taste of the salmon instead of complimenting it.  It wasn't my favorite but it really wasn't bad either. Overall I would say just OK.  I only marinaded the salmon filets for 45 minutes but it was plenty of time for the marinade to permeate completely through the filets. Next time I might try just brushing the salmon with the marinade instead of soaking them.

I did not marinade for the time. I only had an hour, but it turned out amazing! The only thing I would like to add is do not use soy sauce with sodium. It made it a bit salty. Otherwise, a great recipe.

Absolutely delicious, I'd suggest a traditional brand of soy sauce rather than a generic brand to keep it from being "too salty".

Absolutely delicious. Had less than an hour to marinate but the fish was very flavorful and moist. Paired with baked sweet potatoes and asparagus. Hubs loved it. He's already requested again. Thanks!!

My family loves to eat salmon, but tonight I was looking for a new recipe just to shake things up.  I didn't have any dill on hand, which rules out a lot of the other salmon recipes.  We tried this one and loved it.  Even my 5-year-old picky eater liked it (didn't whine after he tasted it).  The only change was we had a large, thick salmon fillet which took closer to 20 minutes to cook through.

Loved it! Would definitely make again! I didn't have fresh garlic so I used garlic powder... And it was still fantastic.. Also didn't have time to marinate four hours... did about an hour and a half.

Im new to cooking so was looking for a relatively easy but delicious!)recipe to cook Salmon, and this was it!The fish was filled with flavour. I didnt have the time to leave the marinade on for more than 4 hours, but it was still yummers! The only thing I did that the recipe didnt mention was to make a sauce out of the left over marinade. I poured the contents into a pan and cooked it till it was of medium consistency. Poured it over the salmon and voila!

Great recipe - tender and flavorful salmon.  My only change was to bake the salmon at 425 F for about 12 minutes instead of broiling.  I was worried I would burn it.  Next time I will boil and reduce the leftover marinade and baste the salmon with it while baking.  Thanks!

like others said, this a keeper! I did not have lemon pepper, so substituted 1 1/2 tsp fresh lemon juice and 1/2 tsp. pepper.  marinated for 1 1/2 hours.  cooked as directed.  loved the caramelized edges of the salmon.  will definitely make this again.

This was great and boyfriend approved! We both really loved it. I'm not a big fan of salmon, but now I am!  I followed the recipe as is but made another batch of marinade for some asparagus and onions.  I laid the asparagus and onions beside the salmon and everything cooked together.  After marinating for only 5 hours, I baked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes then broiled for 3 minutes. Served everything over the rice cooked in chicken broth. Perfect! Delicious! We ate it all!

So easy!!!  I didn't have time to marinate and it was still so good.  I am not a fan of garlic so I skipped the garlic cloves and just sprinkled in a touch of garlic powder.  Didn't have lemon pepper so I used black pepper and a dash of lemon juice.

Delicious, boyfriend loved it. 

I made some small changes to it the 2nd time: added a bit more sugar, diluted the soy sauce a bit, used 1.5tsp lemon juice + 1tsp pepper instead of lemon pepper, halved the oil. 

baked at 370F for about 15min then left it in for about 10-15min.

I've made this recipe so many times because I love it so much! I've shared it with all my family and friends. Simple salmon recipe, very flavorful. My husband loved it! I would recommend marinating overnight if you have time. I've served it on top of a salad and with brown rice and green beans. Each time its been great. Putting it in the broiler gives it a nice flaky texture.

Incredible! My grill was on the fritz when I went to make this so I wrapped it in foil and put in the oven, 350 degrees for about 30 minutes because I had 2 lbs (doubled the recipe).  Super moist, fabulous flavor and the love of my life said he could have it every night for dinner - kids, too!  Big hit and a must try, as is!

Hard to find something everyone in the family will love.  All 4 of my kids loved this Salmon, even "the fish hater"  I should of made 2 lbs because everyone wanted more.  Wonderful flavor!!   I did have to cook it longer then 10 min because the middle wasn't getting done, would advise useing foil around the thiner ends of the fish to avoid over done.

It was also my first time making salmon(Atlantic). I couldn't believe it! Everyone loved it. My husband said it's a ten. I followed the recipe marinating for 4 hours.Thanks!

This truly was a delicious salmon recipe. I'm sure it was mentioned before, but this marinade is awesome when used on chicken as well.  This came in especially handy because my wife hates fish.  I ended up eating as much chicken as she did.  I did add some ginger to the marinade, but I'm sure it would've been great without it.

This is a great marinade for salmon (used a skin on filet)...it has lots of flavor.  I did not have the lemon pepper so I used the juice of 1 fresh lemon and fresh ground pepper.  I did not add any salt because I felt with the soy sauce that was plenty!  After reading the other reviews I decided against leaving the extra sauce on the fish while cooking and instead put it in a skillet and reduced it down.  The brown sugar in the sauce will thicken it..... there is no need to add anything additional...just put it on a low simmer in a sauce pan, stir often and be patient... I brushed the fish with the reduced sauce before serving.  I made sauteed Zuchinni and Yellow squash with fresh garlic and a little S&P, and Coleslaw with a Rice Vinger dressing...It all went very well together and tasted fresh and healthy.

Replace brown sugar with honey and it's perfect! I was worried about the amount of lemon pepper, it seemed like a lot but went for it anyway.  It was great. I also did not marinade, only poured it over immediately before barbequing it and it was super good.

I love this recipe.  It is simple and quick to make.  You don't even need to marinate over night just a couple of hours. I even cooked it in a skillet and it was great.

My husband absolutely loves this! It's now in the regular dinner rotation. I did make a couple of changes though. I halved the brown sugar and used lemon juice and ground pepper instead of lemon pepper. This recipe also works well if the salmon is cooked with the marinade in foil packets over a grill. We serve with brown rice and green beans. Super easy and delicious!

Great recipe...easy to make. My first time making salmon and it was perfect...the marinade turns on the sweet side so next time I will reduce the sugar but otherwise it is awesome...

I've used this recipe many times. This salmon really is delicious. Incredibly easy to prepare and with ingredients I already have in the pantry.  Guests who don't even care for fish end up liking this.  I love recipes like this that end up perfect every time. One of my all-time favorites. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have lemon pepper, so I added fresh lemon juice, and black pepper. This was truly delicious, thus surprising everyone, myself included (I'm not the best chef). Thank you for this awesome recipe!

This recipe was delicious and so easy to make. I did it with salmon the first time, and then with trout the last time,  and both were so good. For people who don't really like to put too much effort into cooking, this is a recipe that you can pull off with such ease, and impress the ones you are cooking for. I served it with garlic dill roasted potatoes and a bunch of different veggies.

This recipe has my kids eating fish and they have never really been a fan of seafood! Works well on filets but not as much  the steaks unless you marinate  longer, they are too thick to soak up the marinade as quickly. We definitely prefer the filets. Definitely a super easy and quick meal for a busy family.

I tried it and loved it! However I didn't marinate it quite as long as it called for and I poured the remaining marinade over the salmon before broiling.

Excellent marinade, the brown sugar and soy sauce make a great blend.  I served fried rice restaurant style and steamed veggies with the salmon, a very low cal, healthy and delicous combo.

YUM!! Perfectly prepared salmon and super easy. I decided to bake it for approx 15 min. as per other reviewers suggestions; broiling a thick fish like salmon makes me a little nervous, even though I'm sure it's fine. We will definitely be enjoying this recipe again and again :) thanks for sharing!

I used a lower salt soy sauce and I didn't have any lemon pepper so I just used fresh lemon and fresh ground pepper.

I only marinated the salmon for an hour and it was still super tasty.   But next time will defiantly marinated it at least overnight for more flavor.

 This was easy and wonderful.   This goes straight in to my favorites box!
