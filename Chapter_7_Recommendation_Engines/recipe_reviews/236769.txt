Hard to rate this exact recipe, as I didn't use the main ingredient: Teriyaki sauce starter. However, it was tasty the way we had it. I made a sauce of half a stick of butter, teriyaki sauce, some sesame oil, shredded ginger, and a little minced garlic. I used a tad too much teriyaki sauce and got a slightly too salty result, but overall it was really good. Besides the sauce, I followed the recipe. My husband really liked it.

So quick, easy, and tasty! I substituted dry coleslaw mix (Marketside) in place of the cabbage and carrots and yellow onion instead of green ones. I added an extra splash of Teriyaki sauce to keep it juicy while cooking. Basically threw in what I had to make it work and it still came out great.

went together very well. Watching the video before hand sure helped though. The second time around was better for me achieving the wrap. Good stuff and easy.

I substituted Great Value teriyaki sauce and added some garlic powder and let the chicken marinate like 15 minutes while I made white rice. I used lettuce from a bag of salad I had on hand. I also put some white rice in the tortillas to make it more filling for my teenagers. They loved it! Super easy and quick!!

Excellent as written, and also a great way to use leftover chicken!  I don't think the packets are made anymore (at least, not available in my area), but teriyaki sauce will do the trick!

Easy and yummy.  The only change I made was using a whole grain sandwich wrap.   Will definitely make again.
