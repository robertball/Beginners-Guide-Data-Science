I made several variations of this recipe and they all went over really well at work. It's super simple and quick to throw together. I had a hard time getting them to cook in the middle, but I am a disaster in the kitchen, so I blame myself not the recipe. In the end I just left them in longer and ended up cutting off the overcooked outer edges. The original recipe makes a VERY sweet bar. 

Most popular variation I made was: substitute chocolate cake mix, peanut butter chips, and salted peanuts.

I also made a carrot cake version with white chocolate chips and chopped walnuts.

I added mini chocolate chips as I didn't have the right amount of butterscotch chips. It turned out delicious. My kids loved it too. I drizzled smuckers caramel sauce on top.

I made these as directed only used half butterscotch and half chocolate chips.  Also added minced pecans.  Baked for 20 minutes only.  Outstanding!

The only changes I made were to add French Vanilla Pudding Mix with roughly 1/4 c. of sour cream, as well as adding 1/3 dark chocolate chips and 2/3 butterscotch chips. My cake mix was a plain white one, which is why I added the pudding mix and sour cream; was way too thick without that. 

Browned up beautifully! I do not have a jelly roll pan, but I used a large cake pan and had to cook it longer, therefore. Easy peasy! 

I will make these again and again, so thank you so much for sharing this!

I will probably make these again.  I did make a few changes. I used a Pamela's Gluten free vanilla cake mix.  I used 1/2 cup pecans, 1/2 cup chocolate chips, 1/2  cup butterscotch chips and 1/2 cup heath chips.  It is super buttery and like others it did not set in the middle. I took it out of the oven and chopped off the edges and put it back in for 15 min.  It is really sweet, but my husband loves sweets and it was a winner with him. It was super easy and quick.

Definitely will make again. Super simple.  Might add coconut next time.   But this is for a family get together and several donâ€™t eat coconut.  So left it out.

I made these for a charity bake sale and they all bought in a short time.  People came back and bought seconds.
