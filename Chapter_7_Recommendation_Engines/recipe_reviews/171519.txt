I give this five stars for the taste; However I did make several adjustments due to the directions being misleading and difficult to understand. 1)Never choose any old wine for fondue.  A drier wine, which has a higher acidic content, is what you need.  NEVER use Chardonay, always use something similiar to a Sauvignon Blanc. 2)When you "warm" the wine DO NOT boil it. Keep it on a low-medium temperature. 3) Always, always, always shred your cheese AND allow it to sit at room temperature.  The finer shredded the cheese is, the easier it will melt. Also, add about a tablespoon of unbleached all-purpose flour to the cheese, and toss it to coat.  This helps the cheese to not "clump' when melting. 4)Cornstarch, or a cornstarch "mixture", should be added BEFORE the cheese.  Add the cornstarch, and stir for several minutes giving it time to break down, and thicken.  Cheese should always be the LAST thing added to fondue. 5)Add the cheese in small handfulls, stir constantly and make sure all cheese is melted and smooth before adding your next handfull.  Otherwise, they will begin to clump together. 6)Cheese should always be cooked on low temperatures. 7)Drops of lemon juice can also be added to help break cheese down.  It also adds a nice flavor 8)Non-stick electric fondue pots are AWESOME for cheese.  Though expensive, they make cheese fondue and chocolate fondue easy because you can control your heat better. 9)Invest in the higher quality cheese, it helps

wonderful! I love cheese, and when I first tried swiss fondue I found a new (expensive) favorite. I'm pretty simple when it comes to the fondue: Use a medium size pot, start to heat it up on medium. rub garlic around the inside of the pot. pour in a thin layer of cooking wine. when you see the tiny "carbonation" bubbles forming around the edges, slowly sprinkle in 1/2 lb shredded Gruyere cheese and 1/2 lb shredded swiss, mixing as you go so it melts evenly and smoothly. I add just a small pinch of cornstarch to thicken it, but not much. After the cheese is completely melted and slightly bubbling, I add cracked pepper and paprika for bite. Stir it up and pour it into the fondue pot that is already heated up (low setting). Yum yum! too bad around here 1/2 lb of Greyer is 8 bucks!

I can't say this is "THE BEST" only because I have yet to compare it against others, but I made this the other night for my husband and some friends and we all really liked it!  We served it with German bier sausage, light rye, sour dough and granny smith apples.  It was a hit and SO yummy!  We had a bit of trouble getting the gouda to melt completely, but it still tasted wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!!

The taste was pretty good. The cheese combo is good.  But the looks with the basalmic left something to be desired.  I used too much corn starch as it thickened up way too much.  Not the recipes fault.  Gotta watch that!  I think it might have been excellent without any cornstarch.  And while the basalmic added flavor...it just didn't look right.  Can't find white basalmic.  Of course, making fondue once a year makes it hit or miss...miss this year...will keep this - interesting flavor, but will look for others.  Cathy

This is a good base recipe but it needs more. I halved the recipe, used a good white wine and really followed a mixture of the process followed below and my own process.  I halve the garlic, rubbed the exposed pieces on the inside of the pot, and then pressed the remaining garlic pulp and left to the side.  I grated all of the cheese and tossed with cornstarch and put off to the side to come up to room temperature.  Once the cheese was room temp I poured in a Savignon Blanc and heated on very low flame till bubbles just started to appear on the bottom and sides of the pot, stirring the entire time.  I added the garlic, balsamic vinegar, nutmeg, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a bit of pepper. I let the everything come up to temperature then slowly added the cheese by the handful, melting after each addition until all the cheese was melted and incorporated.  For dipping we used a good crusty bread, dried sausage, pepperoni, green apple and prosciutto.   In the future I would probably add a jigger of good Kirsch to give it a little kick. I might also consider adding a bit of salt and increase the amount of balsamic as even with just the bread the flavor of the fondue was a bit muted.  Good overall just needs a bit of tweaking.

Absolutely delicious. I modified it, using only Gruyere and Gouda (1/2 lb. ea.), and it was divine. Would like to try it next time w/all 4 cheeses. The balsamic adds a wonderful, slight tang, which I really enjoyed -- as did my picky chef husband!

Delicious and easy!  I have made it twice now and only made one change the second time which was to add the cornstarch and spices before the cheese - the cheese went in last.    This definitely made it less clumpy.

YUM!  Cheesy, tangy, tasty!  The odd color could be off putting but the flavor wins over color.  I followed the recipe to the letter and thought it was spectacular!

Trying to make mine now. Clumpy gritty and gross! Been stirring on low for and hour. Taste is wonderful. Adding drops of Lemmon juice as one review stated may break it up. Not working so far. So bummed!

This is okay.  I wish I would have read Britt's  comments before I made this. Until I figure out what is missing from this recipe, I probably won't  make it again.

This was great! Would have taken a picture but before I knew it my family had begun to eat it. I didn't change anything, except what we used to eat with the fondue. Added spicy kelbasa and chicken sausage with lots of veggies and apples. I think i will have to make a double batch next time.

Loved it! Great flavor! Used the driest Reisling as my wine of choice. I saved the leftovers and have sliced the cheese for grilled cheese and it was amazing!
