I love coffee and chocolate, so this was a winner.  You can use a 12-oz bag or semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the chocolate bars, and it works wonderfully!

I read the reviews and used 1/4 cup coffee granules in with the flour as suggested, instead of the grounds on top. I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. And oh my, these are to die for! I won't be making them too often as my husband and I would be in danger of getting enormously fat!

Wow!  I changed a few things: 3/4 cup butter, 2 tsps vanilla and 1/4 cup strong espresso to the cookie mix, no coffee grounds on top!  We ate them hot out of the oven and they were delicious!

Absolutely delicious and easy to make. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips as I had no candy bars. The idea of sprinkling actual ground coffee seemed strange, but the taste is bewitching. 

Only problem is that the top is dusty and the walnuts don't stick even though I pressed them in. Maybe it would work better to pre-melt the chocolate and mix the coffee in with the melted chocolate, then spread it over the cookie base and sprinkle on the walnuts.

These are delicious and easy to make.  They are definately only for the coffee lover.  I melted the chocolate in the microwave and stirred the ground coffee in with the chocolate.

Good!!!! I decided to put the ground coffee into the actual batter which worked out really really well!!! But... i think next time i will either use instant coffee so that the coffee will deissolve or espresso powder!!!! I definitely recommend this for coffee lovers!!!!

Flavor was good....but texture was terrible.  I'll try this again, but I'll make very strong coffee instead of using coffee grounds.

FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT,.. I used about 1 tbsp. Bailey's Irish cream instead of vanilla. Also I tossed the chocolate chips with a bit of bailey's and the coffee (I used less than was recommended) before spreading on the crust. I will definetly make these again but I'll use chocolate bars instead of chips because they did not melt very well and made the topping kind of lumpy. These squares mail beautifully!

I gave these as a gift in a coffee gift basket and my bro-in-law loved them. Let the bars cool completely before cutting. I had problems with the chocolate seperating. I think I was in too much of a hurry.  Definitely stir in the coffee with the flour. And make sure it is really finely ground.

I tweeked this recipie quite a bit.  I added egg beaters equal to two eggs, and added 1/4 cup of instant coffee to the dough instead of adding coffee grounds to the top of it.  I've had recipes with coffee grounds and I don't care for them.  The bars tasted good, but next time I will use regular chocolate frosting instead of the chocolate chips.  My family loved them.

If you love mocha or coffee you're going to love these cookie bars, if you're not a coffee lover then you probably shouldn't make these because the coffee flavor is very strong. This is definitely not a treat that I'm going to make all the time, but they were very tasty. I ate two of them and actually felt a little buzzed from the caffeine in them, and I drink coffee every day. Maybe make these with decaf so you don't over do it!
I'm giving these cookies 3 stars for the directions but 4 stars for the results. Here are the changes I made: I used INSTANT coffee instead of grounds and I put it right into the batter so it would dissolve and not be gritty. I also replaced a 1/4 cup of the flour called for in the batter with 1/4 cup of 100% cacao powder. This gave me a really delicious chocolate flavor to the cookie. Lastly, I didn't have any chocolate bars on hand so I used a 12 oz bag of chocolate chips for the topping and worked fine. I was iffy about the addition of the walnuts so I only topped a few with them. In my opinion the nuts don't jive well with the rest of the flavors and I didn't like them. I suggest you skip the walnuts all together.

First off - AWESOME taste!! Made this recipe last night after trying another coffee bar recipe on this site that I didn't care for. This recipe was by far way, way better.  Because I am making these for a public function I followed other reviewers suggestions and: added 1/8 c. instant coffee granules to the flour mixture, cut down the butter and sugar to 3/4 c., upped the vanilla to 2 t. and omitted the nuts.  I know, I know, that's not the true recipe then...however, whether you do that or not may not really change the recipe taste that much so take that for what it's worth.  
Anyway...I used the chocolate chips on the top and the only problem I had was after it cooled overnight and I went to cut these, the chocolate delaminated from the cookie base :( Not sure why but I am going to try this recipe again and melt the choc chips in a separate container first and add a teaspoon of corn syrup and then spread it.  Maybe that will help this problem.  I also like to add a bit of butterscotch chips to this kind of topping since it gives it a whole new flavor if you want to change it up a bit :) The batter is not exactly cookie dough consistency since it is sticky but it does work. Oh, and I used a glass dish. When I make it again I will use foil to  line the pan so I can lift it out of the pan and then I can cut it easier. Stay tuned...

Wow, did this turn out greasy. Just out of morbid curiosity, I tested the base with my cake tester and it came out clean even before it was baked. The flavor was wonderful with 1/3c instant coffee mixed in the the flour and the chocolate chips melted over the top, but I couldn't get over that greasiness. Next time I'll use a regular chocolate chip pan cookie base with the added coffee and save the chocolate chips for the top.

The coffee grounds (how you're suppost to add them) gives it the wrong texture, the cookie base collaspes and because of that when spreading the chocolate, it tears the unstable cookie base.

This was quick and easy but the coffee flavor was too strong when I used 1/3 cup ground Dunkin Donuts French Vanilla.  I would recommend more chocolate and less ground coffee.  People at work loved it anyway!

Wow!  I absolutely love this recipe.  I have made it many times since I found it and it has been a hit in multi age groups.  My daughters love them as does my husband.  I find it is great as a take along for carry- ins and snacks since they travel well.  I use a nice flavored ground coffee that I get from the grocery (I use less than the recipe calls for) and grind it fresh and also use chocolate chips instead of the bars.  They melt quickly and spread nicely.  I wonder if these freeze well?

I've made this recipe several times now...and everyone loves it!  I have adapted it just a bit, though.  I found when putting the coffee in with the chocolate, it gave the chocolate a texture that made it seem crystalized.  For coffee lovers, it wasn't a huge deal, but the next time I put the coffee in the cookie batter instead...and it came out perfect!  Also, as several other people mentioned previously, I used chocolate chips instead of candy bars and put it back in the oven until the chocolate was spreadable.

Chocolate didn't firm up sitting on counter before cutting, so I put it in the fridge for about 1/2hr. Worked great.

The first time I tried this recipe the crust was very greasy.    The second time I tried it the crust was a little better, but not much.   Then after the cookie cooled and I cut into them the chocolate did not stay on the cookie crust.  I would never make these again.

This was my first cookie bar i made and it was very easy. Im not a big fan of coffee so i just sprinkled a litle on 1/2 of the dish. I also used a package of chocolate chips instead of the candy bars. The chocolate didn't melt after i took the cookies out of the oven so after the chocolate was completly cooled i put it in the oven so it would melt more and it workd fine.  WILL make AgAiN!!!
