I'd say this recipe makes a good standard-tasting large batch of crepes. The batter is not too thin or too thick and the flavor is easily  tweakable (Ok, customizable).

Pretty good crepes. I like mine to taste more like vanilla so I'd add more next time. Unfortunately I made mine a little to thick in the pan. But they were good overall. Yum!

This is a very good recipe but I found them a bit too thick. I added more milk and eliminated the sugar. When living in London, I learned how to make the traditional English breakfast pancakes made on "Shrove Tuesday" before lent. They were similar but a bit thinner and did not have sugar added. They were buttered with fresh lemon and powdered sugar. Delicious!

When I was a young boy, my mother told me to abide by one rule and one rule only, sanity is in the stem of the brocoli. My mother is crazy; regardless, I now realize what she was saying all those years ago as she chanted "coo wacha la kema" at a dried leaf. When you come to a crossroads in your life, take action. For me, that was whether pursue my dream of mimicing rocks or write a review for these disgusting pancakes. To this day I think back to hours ago when I made that influencial decision and think, i did it mom, I made it. When I went into the journey of making these pancakes, or at least that's what I thought they were, I thought it was the journey that really matters, no the destination. I was wrong. I began questioning this recipe when I almost drowned in the thin mixture. Luckly I had my floaties on and I survived to write this critical review. Only realizing when I began cooking,  this recipe shows no yeild, I made too much for my little pet spider bill.  These crepes tastes almost like omletes, no the sweet pancakes I was hoping they'd be. I might just be a bigoted fool for not know what a crepe was but regardless, it was a gelatinous disgusting mess. Anyone looking to make this recipe, just remember, sanity is the stem brocoli.

Turned out delicious, no changes made to recipe. Served with Nutella spread on their snide, rolled up and sprinkled with a smidge of icing sugar. Divine!

My 16 year old son and his friend made these for breakfast at the beach.  Fool proof recipe!  They were delish.

the crapes are good. But the recipe is missing part of the instructions which is how many crapes does the batter make,how many crapes are in a serving? and how much batter to pour into the pan (such as use a 1/8 or 1/4 cup per crape and size of the pan. I made 1/2 a batch and did 2 crapes, (about 1/4c. batter) in a small cast iron pan and have a lot of batter left no idea how many it actually makes and what is considered a serving size (ie 1,2 etc.)per servings. please correct the recipe to reflect how many it makes and how many in a serving size.

First time making crepes, turned out fabulous, by the 4th or 5th crepe had figured out when each side would be done and they tasted just like my mother's did way back when.

This was an easy recipe, but I had to double the milk to get the batter thin enough to work with.
