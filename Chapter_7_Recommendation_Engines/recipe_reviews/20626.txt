This makes two peachy drinks I've had tonight. I like this much better than the first. The gin and the triple sec offsets the sweetness of the schnapps and soda and all the ingredients come together nicely. I really can't tell there's any alcohol in this at all, which is dangerous!

wow!  I love this!  Had to make a few changes--don't have gin, so I used vodka.  And we have Fresca, which I have no idea if tat is lemon lime or not!  But very yuhmmy and fruity.  Thanks for sharing!

This is heavenly, and you can't even taste the alcohol in it. I used fresh squeezed OJ, and I used juice from a maraschino cherry jar instead of buying grenadine. It's amaaaazing!
