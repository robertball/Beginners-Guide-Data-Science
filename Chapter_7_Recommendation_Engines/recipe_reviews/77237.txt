This was really good!  I've made several of the overnight breakfast casseroles that have bread in them, but it seems like they are either too dry or too soggy.  I'm going to throw those recipes out and replace them with this one.  The only change I made was that I used green onions and I sauteed them with fresh mushrooms ahead of time.  Otherwise, I made it as written and it turned out perfect.  (I love the cheese on the bottom.)  For a timesaver, you can layer all of the ingredients in the pan the night before, so that the only step you have to do in the morning is to pour the eggs over and bake.

Easy and delicious...who could ask for more! One recommendation that I have is to save some of the cheese and other toppings (or add extra) for the top. Once the egg is poured on, sprinkle on a little more cheese, mushrooms and tomato just to give it a prettier finish. Fab recipe. Thanks

WOW! If you are wondering if this is rubbery.. do I have a story for you! My boyfriend came home from work 9 hours after I made this and put it in the microwave.. same great taste not a bit rubbery! I was in SHOCK! I even warned him not to do it. But boys will be boys.. and I am so glad because now I know.. and now you know too =] I mixed a few of the reviews together and added.. saut√©ed green onion with the regular onion and green peppers (put on bottom).. then on the top I added more cheese and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies (extra hot).. I also cut the recipe in half and was shocked at how thick it turned out! Thanks! We loved this =]

This was delicious. Everyone enjoyed it. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the great recipe. At to the reviewer who gave the recipe 1 star because the submitter used the word scrambled instead of whisked ... really? Please use the ranking system correctly or it helps no one. Giving a low score because you didnt read the directions properly is crazy. Everyone else seemed to understand what scrambling eggs in a bowl with milk meant.

I made a lot of changes, but this one is great!  I changed the cheese from sharp cheddar to a mix of sharp cheddar and low skim mozzarella.  Instead of eggs, I used Southwestern style egg beaters (2 cartons), I used browned turkey bacon  browned and cut into pieces and sauteed onions, pepper, and tomatoes together for the veggies.  My company RAVED over this and I never told them that any of it was low fat or egg beaters.  It was great!  Try it!

Amazing recipe.  So versatile, easy and delicious.  I've made it twice so far. Once for a cookie exchange party and again  for a Mother's Day brunch.  Everyone LOVED it.  I love that you can add or subtract ingredients to what suits you.  I made one with mushroom and spinach and another ham and cheese.  This recipe has now been passed on from family to friends.  A true winner.  Also a great dinner idea.

Made this up for my family this morning. I reduced eggs to 8 and upped milk to 1 cup and placed in 8x8 pan. I added diced tomatoes, italian cheese and omitted the olives and mushrooms. This is yummy and easy for you to add and take away your own foods. I love the fact that it doesn't have bread in it. I used cooking spray instead of butter. Thank you!

My husband really loves this dish! I made mine with cheese, ground hot sausage, mushrooms, egg mixture, and some pepperjack cheese squares on top.  He divides them into equal portions and eats them for snack at all times of the day!! Great for low carb diets!!

This was yummy. I almost left out the jalapenos, but opted to put them in half the pan, and glad I did bc it gave a great flavor. Used everything suggested. This was tasty, easy, and quick! I would season it up a bit next time and use fresh mushrooms in place of canned, but an overall great recipe!

I made this for the first time today and we all loved it!!  I used fresh mushrooms and sauted green peppers with the onion and added browned crumbled sausage.  This will be a staple for our weekend breakfast!  This would be fun to experiment more with!  Thank you for sharing :)

This is so good and very easy to make. I like to make breakfast suppers occasionally, and this recipe worked perfectly for that. We had leftover honey-baked ham from New Year's and it tasted great in this recipe. I left out the jalopenos because we didn't have any... next time I'd probably include them. I did add a couple of healthy dashes of tabasco to the eggs to give them some zip. Thanks for submitting this!

This is a wonderful recipe for a couple of reasons. 1st.  It is super simple. And 2ND. It is very versatile. I made it fairly close to the recipe. It usually drives me "CRAZY" when people alter a recipe so much that it is no where near the original recipe and then they give it a very low rating. But I did not have any Olives (black or green) so I left them out. Also I am allergic to hot peppers of all kinds. So of course I left them out as well. But in place of the Jalapeno Peppers I used Green Peppers. Also I do not like canned Mushrooms, so in place of I just replaced them fresh Mushrooms. I did take a couple of the other reviews into account by saving 1/2 of cup of the Cheddar Cheese, and I did use Sharp Cheddar to give it that extra yummy flavour. Although I did make a couple of minor changes, this was still 5 stars. And if I could give it more, I would. Like I did say, because it is a Omelet, it is versatile, to what you like in your Omelet. I am having a brunch this coming weekend, & I have decided that instead of making the usual Scrambled Eggs, I will be making this!!!!!!!

A nice, ‚Äúunfancy‚Äù baked omelet that cuts and serves nicely and leaves lots of room for tinkering with different ingredients.   I used fresh mushrooms and added some chopped fresh broccoli.  I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with the high baking temperature and, while I‚Äôm sure it would have worked out fine, I nevertheless reduced the temperature to 350 degrees and baked it until set and a little golden, about 40 minutes.

YUM! I did add some fresh garlic and chopped red pepper and I sauteed them with the onion and fresh mushrooms (instead of canned). I wanted a creamier egg filling, so I used fat free evaporated milk. No jalapeno peppers so I used one 4 oz. can of diced mild green chilies. I added just a touch of dijon mustard and a little Frank's Hot Sauce, as I add that to most of my egg dishes. My family LOVED this. What the boys and I didn't eat, my husband did and my littlest had seconds. Very simple--it literally was ready to go in less than 15 minutes. What's great about it is it's totally bendable to use what you have on hand and make it personal to your favorite omelette fillings. Next time, I'm going to try this with homemade turkey breakfast "sausage".

I have been making almost the exact same recipe for years, minus the ham.  You can mix everything together the night before, and leave in the pan in the fridge overnight, and bake it in the morning. You can also add herbs to the mixture.

Very easy and enjoyable. I used a 12" skillet and it created a wonderful crispy crust of cheese. Obviously you can use any veggies or meat you enjoy in your omelets. I would sautee any meats or seafood before placing them into the mix to cook. Veggies are your preference to cook or leave raw.  Understand any ingredients placed into the mix will cook very little when baking.   
Thanks for the post

This is a great recipe and very forgiving on ingredients.  In my attempt to make this lower fat, I used just about 2T butter to saute the onions, used Canadian bacon instead of ham, instead of the jalapenos I used bought fresh salsa (left over from company a couple nights before), used 4 real eggs and 8 egss equivalent (2 cups) of egg substitute, skim milk, and reduced fat Swiss cheese instead of the cheddar.  It was fabulous and no one knew I had made it low fat!

Really great recipe, I only made one change.   I used 8 eggs and upped the milk to a full cup.  It came out light and fluffy.  I did use sauteed fresh mushrooms (don't like canned).  The only thing that really didn't work was the black olives.  This surprised me because we are an olive loving family, but they just were too overpowering.  I think I will leave out the olives and throw a can of chopped green chilis in instead next time.

This was great!  The second time I made it I put tater tots in the bottom of the pan with spray Pam and baked them first while I was chopping all the veggies and getting everything ready.  Then tossed all the veggies in and topped with the eggs and a generous sprinkle of jalapeno jack cheese.  Great with a fruit salad for dinner....leftovers are yummy, if there is any left.

So easy, so yummy!  To cut back on a few calories, I substituted Southwestern Egg Beaters for half the eggs.  Since we use 2% milk, I used that.  I used Oscar Meyer precooked bacon that I crisped up in the microwave for 1 minute instead of ham.  Since I made it a day ahead, I cooked it at 350 for 30 minutes, then reheated at 350 for 15 minutes.  I took it to a friend's house for breakfast, and it was a hit!  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

No olives but spinach is good.  More mustard needed.  Nukes great if there are leftovers.  I've made it with chopped ham, sausage, pepperoni or no meat.  Keeper!

Great recipe and easy to tinker with! Since I was only cooking this for my husband and I, I used a 9x9 pan.  I put cheddar cheese on the bottom, then drained canned asparagus and leftover honey-baked ham cut into bite sized pieces.  I whisked 1 3/4 cups egg beaters (~8 eggs) with 1/3 cup milk and salt, pepper and a little onion powder to pour over the top.  I shredded a little extra cheese on top and baked in my toaster oven uncovered at 400 for 30 minutes.  It was perfectly baked and delicious!

We like having breakfast for dinner sometimes and this is a good recipe for that. Did cut recipe in half--cooking for 2. Always have eggs, cheeses, canned mushrooms and black olives in house this is a good recipe to throw together for unexpected company.

I've been making this recipe for years and everyone who has eaten has loved it. I also do a variation using pepperoni instead of the ham, add some Italian seasonings and serve it for dinner...it's wonderful and tastes almost like pizza!
  You can also make it lower fat by cutting down the butter and substituting half the eggs with egg whites. It's still yummy too!

Excellent egg bake.  Make sure to not overcook it or it gets a little rubbery.

This was the best Saturday breakfast dish! Like other reviewers, I kept the basic ingredients and methodology but changed up the ingredients a bit. I sauteed the onion with fresh mushrooms (I hate canned mushrooms) and added some grape tomatoes toward the end of the sauteeing until they split. As the recipe dictated, I put the cheese on the bottom, then layered the veggies on top, chopped deli sliced ham on top of the veggies, then eggs poured over all. I whisked the eggs with milk, a little sour cream and some garden fresh salsa (to overcome the lack of seasoning that some reviewers commented on). Over the eggs I just sprinkled some cheese and studded with fresh mushroom slices and halved grape tomatoes for presentation. Really it was incredible, my boyfriend raved! Thanks for such a great idea!

I loved this recipe! I did not use mushrooms and used bacon instead of ham. Other than those changes I followed the recipe to a T. Thanks!

"Egg-cellent" basic recipe. (Sorry, I couldn't resist :) I used mushrooms, red & green peppers, bacon, and a mexican cheese blend. The only reason I am giving it 4* instead of 5*, is because we felt the original recipe needed more meat and more cheese than was called for. Served with Trader Joe's roasted breakfast potatoes and a fruit salad, this was a very satisfying breakfast-for-dinner meal. Thank you! I can't wait to experiment with more ingredients in this dish!

Delicious!  But you should change your direction from SCRAMBLED to beaten.  To most folks, scrambled means COOKED.  I miss the nutritional guide (calories) that used to be posted with each recipe.                :-(

I tried this for the first time and the family love it!  Although I did add cooked hash browns as my first layer--Omelets need hash browns  It turned out great!  I did use sauages since I didn't have ham, but this is an omelet.

This was great!  I used sausage, red peppers and onions as that is what I had on hand.  I also cut it to 8 eggs and did it in an 8x8 dish.  But the recipe idea was just what I was looking for!  This is a great base recipe in which you could put your favorite omelet ingredients.

This was a great casserole! I left out the ham, but that didn't take away from the deliciousness of this dish. It reheated well in the microwave. I'll be making this recipe again and again.

Very nice recipe.  Is good enough to serve guests and quick to make.  Able to use what you have on hand and have some give to the recipe.  I didn't use jalapenos and maybe I should have, mine seemed a little bland.  Just brought spices and hot sauce to table and was fine.

This dish was a big hit at my family's weekly Knit Night!  It was easy to prepare and turned out perfectly.  I topped the casserole with some additional shredded cheese and a drained can of diced tomatoes with green chilis as another reviewer suggested.  The colors were really pretty with the black olives, the onions, and the diced tomato topping.  I used a bigger casserole dish, so I increased all the incredients by about 1/3.  We will make this a mainstay for family meal choices.  It is also low carb, which is a bonus in our family.  It is quite easy to cut the leftovers into serving size pieces and store in the refrigerator.  They are easy to reheat in the microwave.  It was nice to find an egg casserole that did not include potatoes or bread.

This was very good and easy to personalize to your family's tastes. This was a simple dinner meal when we were running low on groceries and needed to use up our holiday ham.

Delicious and low cal! I used two cartons of Southwest Egg Beaters, sauteed mushrooms, onion, green onion, jalapenos, green pepper, garlic, ham and sliced tomatoes. Topped with cheddar and put back in oven for a few minutes. Served with sour cream and hot sauce. The only issue I had was that it was a bit watery from the veggies even tough I had sauteed them first.

I am not a fan of bread in my egg dish, so this has been a nice substitute. It is great recipe for large groups and if you would like to prepare items in advance.  I served this at several gatherings, modifying it per tastes of the group.  I've made with eggs and low-cholesterol egg substitute.  Flavor varieties included Swiss cheese/artichoke/spinach (used frozen spinach; thaw and squeeze out moisture;may need extra salt); ham/sharp  Cheddar with or without diced red and green peppers; and with the ingredients described on the original recipe.  For one group, I baked it the day before serving, quickly chilled it, and then reheated it in the oven the following day.  All have turned out great.

I love the versatility of this recipe - you can throw in whatever you have on hand. However, after 10 mins in the oven @ 400f, I saw that the top had burnt spots. I reduced the heat, and cooked it for about another 25 mins. Husband really enjoyed it and I thought it was ok.

I suppose I shouldn't rate this as written because I didn't use the OLIVES, HAM or JALEPENOS.  But, this was so wonderful as a baked cheese omelet that I had to give it a perfect rating. It puffed up beautifully and was not dry.  I added extra onions and used fresh mushrooms, both of which I saut√©ed prior to making the omelet.  I will definitely make this again.  Such an easy way to make an omelet for overnight guests.  Next time, maybe I'll add cooked bacon or sausage.  I'd love to add some chopped bell pepper, for a western omelet, but sadly my husband doesn't like peppers.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Great recipe but I found that I had to add a couple more eggs & a tad more milk to the egg mixture to fill up the dish. I added mini sweet peppers and fresh spinach. Instead of sauteing the onion in the beginning I just through all of the veggies in the pan, covered with egg mixture then topped with black olives and mushrooms. I didn't add cheese since I would rather use it as a light garnish in the end. It did lack some flavor since the only seasoning is salt & pepper but nothing a little Tabasco sauce couldn't fix! Overall, I just love the flexibility of this dish and now I don't have to make eggs every single morning!

This was so good and so easy!  I figured we could tailor this to our personal omelet tastes and it seemed to work great.  Instead of ham I used 16 oz. bulk pork sausage.  While I was browning it, I added the onion plus chopped green peppers and fresh mushrooms (since that's what we had in the fridge) - didn't need the butter, just used the fat released from the sausage.  I left out the jalapeno but added the remaining 1/2 cup of cheese left in the bag to the top of the casserole.  The cheese on the bottom becomes a delightfully chewy crust.  Served with lots of ketchup to rave reviews.  Thanks!

I kind of made this recipe my own in the sense that I used egg beaters in place of eggs and left out a few things we didn't like. But over all this was a great way to make omelets for those busy mornings. Thanks so much for sharing!

I modified the ingredients and it was fantastic! Used the cheddar cheese, hot italian sausage, a can of diced tomatoes, and added some italian seasonings. Decreased to 8 eggs in an 8x8 dish and cooked for 35 min. Great!

Made this recipe for breakfast today.  I only changed a few things: I used fresh mushrooms and sauteed them with the onions, and I put a little shredded cheese on top.  I also had some cooked sausage leftover from homemade pizza so I added that with the ham layer.  This recipe is very good!!!!  We loved it and I will definitely make it again.  I did have to bake it about 10 min longer than the recipe called for.

This amazing omelet casserole is now our new favorite comfort food!  I did modify the recipe a bit and am quite tickled with the way it turned out!  First of all I lined the greased casserole pan with crescent roll dough and prebaked that crust til lightly browned.  I used a dozen eggs, substituted whipping cream for the milk (just because I had it on hand), added fresh spinach, chopped red, yellow and orange bell peppers, leftover diced/smoked ham, fresh scallions,garlic and spices to taste, split grape tomatoes and added 1 can of southwest style corn that I had leftover from a previous dinner.  I layered the grated white/yellow cheddar mix cheese first, then the pepper/onion/corn mixture next, and poured the egg/spinach/tomatoe mixture over the top. I baked this for 30 minutes, turned off the oven and sprinkled more cheese on the top and let that melt in the still warm oven.  Wahlah!  My husband is on his 2nd helping, and although I made enough to send it to work with him for breakfast throughout the week, I doubt it will make it that far!  This is DEFINITELY a keeper, and SO easy!  There are SO MANY different ingredients you can substitute and I am sure it will be spendid each way!  Thank you thank you thank you for a wonderful comfort/breakfast meal! :)

Just made this for the first time for Christmas breakfast, the whole family enjoyed it! I made substitutions to suit our tastes...I omitted the jalapenos, olives, and used fresh mushrooms as well as some green and red peppers (for a Christmassy look :) ). I also added a can of diced tomatoes, drained, and some cooked and crumbled turkey sausage and bacon. I used a little olive oil to saute the veggies instead of the butter. I also used reduced fat cheese. It was very yummy and easy to make, but next time I will add more cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

really a fabulous and simple idea! I have customized and "healthified" my own slightly. I make it with egg whites, lean ground turkey, plenty of veggies (no need for the butter if you use a nonstick skillet) and fat free sharp cheddar. Even if that's not your cup of tea, this is a great dish for brunch. I make it all the time (even on Christmas as the author suggests). I highly recommend it

Love this! Decided to swap the olives for some green peppers. Layered the ingredients instead as well. Cheese and veggies on the bottom, poured half the eggs over that, added some more cheese and the rest of the oppings and poured the rest of the egg. After cooking, added some extra cheese on top and popped it under the broiler for a minute. Turned out fantastic! Definitely a new favorite. And so easy!!

Not doughy or egg-y like many of the egg bakes I have tried.  I also like that you don't have to mix it up the night before.  This is really 4 servings, not 8 though.

This recipe was easy and good.  I used cooked sausage instead of ham and I added shredded potatoes into the 9x13 first.

I really liked this recipe, but changed it a bit to suit my tastes. I added cooked fresh mushrooms. It is suitable for storing in the fridge and reheating too. Makes for a great second meal too. Thank you!

I made this with ham, cheese and mushrooms (extra pepper and a couple dashes of Tabasco) it turned out PERFECT!  I had the leftovers the next day and they were just as good.  Make sure you layer your toppings on the bottom of the pan and dont stir it after you put your eggs on.

I made a versoin of this last week with breakfast sausage, spinach, mushrooms and onions. (That's what I had in my fridge.) I think you could use any ingredients you like. Such an easy, fun casserole. I am making one tomorrow with the listed ingredients but using andouille sausage instead of ham. Thanks for the great recipe !!

Inspired by this recipe but needing to adjust for a low sodium diet, I used groundbeef for ham, cooked in no-salt mexican seasoning, subbed stoplight peppers for olives and followed cooking instuctions to a tee. It was great!!! Can't wait to try when it's cold out! Thank you for the great place to start from!

WOW!!  This is really great!  I made this for my Mom & myself, and the only changes I made were omission of the mushrooms, and since we like our food on the "spicy" end, I added a generous splash of TABASCO sauce, and I added some cheese on top!  So DELICIOUS!!

I love making this, but always put the shredded cheese on top - the bottom works better.  I also added some tarragon and a little Mrs. Dash in the egg mixture.

This is pretty good, and relatively easy.  I didn't have shredded cheese so I just used sliced cheese and it worked just as well.  Eliminated 2 ingredients:  onions (we don't like them) and olives (don't have at the moment).  I halved this recipe and it's resulted in three servings each.  Bc bf is the one who likes mushrooms, I put mushrooms on half the omelet and am giving him those sections.  My omelet needed an extra 15 mins in the oven to set.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was staying at my cousin's house and her sister (my other cousin) called to say that her family was stopping by for brunch the following day. We had very little in the fridge, so I plugged in the ingredients we did have in and this was one of the options. What an awesome stroke of luck! It was a huge hit and it has now become a family staple for brunches because it is so versatile. Thank you Bonnie for sharing!

These were just okay. The family didn't care for the overwhelming flavor of black olives and even though I added cheese to the top as well, it was very blah. I smothered mine with salsa and thought it was fine but I have been asked to never make this again!! Sorry....

This was awesome. I used fresh mushroom slices as well as a little bit of sauteed bell peppers to the mix. I used all the other ingredients as well (I only had 10 eggs though so I added a little bit more milk, it was good!)

To make this even easier, you can prepare it the night before and pop it in the oven in the morning.  Very versatile - I like to sneak in more veggies.

This is a pretty good simple recipe (thank God), but don't use red onion!  I did and, although tasty, the onions for whatever reason turned green.  yikes! :O)  I topped this with more cheese (you can never have too much!), and it turned out great-

Amazing. I used sausage and spinach in place of the ham and added 10 oz can Rotel drained diced tomatoes with green chiles and pepper jack cheese to the top. It was a huge hit. I had a lot of ingredients so I added 3 extra eggs and baked in a large casserole dish Perfect for  New Years Brunch.  Make sure you drain the spinach and tomatoes well. Thank you this is a keeper. Everyone wanted the recipe

Super easy and delicious.  Added the ham but left out the jalepenos. Didn't have any olives on hand so didn't include those. The dish was delicious and the hubby said I could make any time.  Can see this becoming a favority for Sunday mornings and for holidays like Easter and Christmas.

Made this for my family today and used leftovers from the week to help clean out my fridge.  I added boiled potatoes (cubed), mashed potatoes, and ham in layers on top of the Tex-Mex cheese bottom.  I also added a layer of chunky salsa for a little zip.  To my egg mixture, I added salt & pepper as well as some dill.  I baked it for 20 minutes at 350 added more cheese to the top and continued baking for an additional 15-20 minutes.  We all loved it and it is definitely a recipe that I will make often - easy peasy to make and a great way to use up leftovers at the end of the week.  Thanks for sharing - definitely two thumbs up from our house!!!

Absolutely delicious. I made it for a church breakfast and everybody wanted the recipe.  A lady just called to ask if this can be made the night before and kept in the refrigerator so she can pop it into the oven first thing the next morning.  How about it?

When making this recipe, I thought to myself that I wanted a flaky crust for it!  so I got a crescent sheet and baked it first in the bottom of the baking dish ... I then topped the baked crust with the meat and veggies and cheese, and poured the egg on top.  Well, my crust then floated.  I figured oh well, I'm gonna bake it anyways and see how it turns out.  Fantastic!  It looked a little odd at first, and I had to poke it because it looked like I was baking a giant ham!! LoL!  Well, the egg kind of cooked into the crescent, and it turned out great!  I will definitely be making this over and over! :)

Loved it and it was so easy to make. I used breakfast turkey sausage and smoked cheddar cheese since that's what I had. I halved the recipe since I was just feeding 3 and there were no leftovers. My picky husband asked me to make to tomorrow's breakfast as well.

Great! Made this for dinner.  My son wanted scrambled eggs and then I saw this so made it. I used green peppers instead of the jalapeno peppers and some chopped honey ham I had in the freezer; I sauteed both of these with the onions. Then I followed the recipe until the eggs were added.  Once they were in the dish, I gently sprinkled about 1/4 grated Colby Jack cheese & some chopped Roma tomatoes on top. He loved it! Thanks so much for posting the recipe. (Oh! I halved the recipe as it was only two of us, for the whole thing, use 1/2 cup cheese on top.)

I have certain food allergies so i altered the recipe a bit.  Instead of butter i used olive oil and in place of the cheddar cheese i used rice cheese that was cheddar flavored.  It taste fantastic.  I absolutely love how fluffy it comes out and the edges are nice and crispy.  The bottom layer of cheese was fantastic.  My one recommendation would be use use Silk Soy Vanilla flavored milk instead of regular milk.  It adds a little more flavor to it.  Just a little pintch.  All and all its a great dish.

I served this Christmas morning and it was a real hit! I made it earlier so I could just pop it in the oven. I did use real mushrooms though and sauted them with the onions. That was the only change!

Ours didn't come out great, but I gave it 4 stars because it's such a great basic recipe that's easy to modify to suit your tastes. Ours wasn't great because the combo of regular ham, olives, cheese and jalepeno slices made it over-the-top salty. Almost too salty to enjoy. We'll definitely make it again, but with fresh peppers and a lower-sodium ham. thanks!

This is a great versatile recipe. I used ham, turkey, olives, mushrooms, jalepenos, salt n pepper, garlic powder, milk, eggs.  It turned out soooo yummy and it was even great leftover, which was a shocker because eggs are never good as leftovers.  Thanks!!! Mine did take 40 minutes to cook....maybe i had too much stuff in there, not sure. I also tried this with left over seasoned hamburger. Yum!

I just made this and it was so tasty. I did as another reviewer suggested and added a layer of shredded cheese on top and it browned beautifully.  Fresh diced tomatoes will go on top of it next time! Thanks

Delicious!  A basic recipe that you can change everytime you make it.  See what's in the fridge that day and use it.  When pouring eggs in dish, pour them over the back of a large spoon and you won't get that big splash.

These are GREAT!!! They are so easy and VERY tasty. You can make part of it the night ahead and get up in the morning and mix up your eggs and bake it. It is also really good left over the next morning - if there is any left over!!

I used this recipe as guide cutting it back to 6 eggs and made a bacon/cheese omelet quiche thing since I left out the veggies. I just mixed all the ingredients in a large bowl and dumped it into the prepared casserole dish and topped with a liitle extra shredded cheese and baked. I used onion powder instead of real onion. My teen didn't like it but I thought it was okay. I'd rather have scrambled egg with cheese isntead though.

I think this is a great recipe. I did make it without the olives though, the first time, because I did not have any. As it is written, I found it a little salty. I make this about once a week and always get rave reviews. It is good with jalpenos or green chilis, with or without mushrooms, and with sausage instead of ham. A great technique as well as a recipe. Thank you original poster.

This was great! My only changes were I used cooking spray in lieu of the butter and used only 10 eggs (egg substitues to reduce the cholesterol). I forgot to season the eggs, so i just sprinkled pepper on top. I figured the cheese and ham would compensate for the salt. The taste and presentation were great. I will definately make this again trying different veggie combinations.

This recipe is great, I usually dont try new recipes for company, but my family WOLFED DOWN the whole pan in one sitting. My toddler loved it too. Its a great recipe for when you have kids, just make it once and warm it up the next morning! We love it!

I don't know what I expected but this was AMAZING and I will make it over and over again.  SO EASY. I used another reviews amounts for 8 eggs and 1 cp milk in an 8x8 pan as that size was appropriate for a family of 2.  I chopped fresh broccoli and a small amount of onion in a food processor and topped with fresh tomato slices from my garden but FORGOT to saut√©e the onions and brocolli .  ??. I was sure it would be a disaster and the veggies uncooked. BUT IT WAS FABULOUS!!  I cooked it for 40 minutes at 350 degrees and topped with a little more cheese.  THANK YOU for this great recipe !!!!!

Baked Omelet Squares Haiku: "Somewhat flavorless. Really needs some spicing up. (I didn't change much." Halved the recipe for a 8X8 pan, and added the optional ham and jalapenos, but kept the rest the same. I liked the cheese on the bottom and that the "guts" were layered, rather than stirred into the whisked eggs, but found that I needed alot more salt and hot sauce when I served it to give it more oomph. The texture was great, and the leftovers were also good b/t English muffins for breakfast the next few days.

I cut the recipe in half for just my husband and myself.  That lasted us 2 days.  I added some things suggested by other reviewers and it came out fantastic.  I sauteed about 4-5 fresh garlic cloves, 1 red pepper, 1/2 red onion, 1/2 can of no salt added mushrooms, 1 4oz can of mild diced chilis & ground pork sausage in the butter.  I then followed the rest of the recipe.  I will definitely be making this again.  UPDATE:  I have made this recipe multiple times.  The last time I made it, I used egg whites to reduce the cholesterol.  It tasted just as good as the regular eggs.  I'll be using egg whites from now on.

I had limited resources without a trip to the store this morning. I contemplated using the Black Forest Ham we have for sandwiches, but went with diced crisp bacon. I had green onions, diced pickled jalapeno and Tillamook medium cheddar, a teaspoon or so of minced garlic and a little salt & pepper. It came out beautiful & tasted great. Next time I will add some chopped kale or try it as written. Thanks for the inspiration! I forget eggs can be baked, and not just on the stove top :o)

yes made it pretty much the same added fresh mushrooms, and a little hot sauce, other than this, I kept to the recipe, the one who used egg beaters and a bunch of this and that, she said nobody knew the difference, wow! I would know in one second, the color is off, and the people who ate this, are not cooks, but I want to say hooray for you, my family would know the tasteless difference, not in a bad a way, they would just know, they raise their chickens for their eggs, they are fed of course chicken scratch, but they love apples, mangos vegies, all kinds of things, and between the chickens eggs and egg beaters, they would def. know the difference, wish I had your friends!

I love this recipe! You can add just about anything. Today I added spinach, feta, saut√©ed onions, peppers and mushrooms. So yummy! I recommend using butter flavored Crisco to grease the pan.

Loved being able to serve guests something "omelet-oriented" without either making them ahead or juggling several pans at once so we could eat simultaneously.  This is great for those watching carbs - no soggy/bready fillers! To make this vegetarian & lower fat, I used PAM & sauted onions, mushrooms, spinach, then added sundried tomatoes, which looked lovely for the holiday season.  Sprinkled a small amount of feta cheese on the bottom, added veggies, then eggs mixed with lots of herbs (didnt add the milk).  I topped with a tiny amount of low-fat mozzarella & a dash of parmesan for an extra flavor boost.  Used 375 for convection bake.  Served with fresh fruit & a non-fat Greek yogurt topping....a great "base recipe" when making brunch for a crowd!

Great recipe!  I made a huge batch (12 dozen eggs altogether) for a weekend music camp--campers ranged in age from 6 to 18.  I made 2 "industrial size" meat lovers batches layered with cheese, hash browns, grilled onions, cubed ham, bacon bits, and browned sausage.  I also made a veggie-lovers batch layered with cheese, grilled onion, grilled peppers, mushrooms, and black olives.  Everyone loved them!  The only mis-calculation was the amount of time it would take for the huge batches to bake--as it turned out about 2 hours instead of the 90 minutes I had allowed.  Will definitely make this for my family--in a much smaller batch!  BTW, I prepped all the filling ingredients the night before, so that all I had to do in the morning was heat the oven, layer the ingredients, and whip up the eggs.  YUM!! Kid and grown-up approved!

This was SOOO yummy!  I made lots of leftovers so have for the week.  My variation was that I browned the ham, removed from pan, then browned bell pepper and onion, added tiny cubes of zucchini.  Put that and the olives in the bottom of a Pam sprayed 9X13 pan.  Added the cheese then slowly the egg mixture as directed.  Topped with crumbled bacon.  The leftovers were even great cold for a quick breakfast or snack. Oh, and I cooked it a little less than called for.  I LIKE it a little wet.

This is the best egg dish I've ever tasted. The only thing I changed was I used half egg beaters and half eggs. I also added red and green peppers . I also sprinkled some of the cheese on top. Loved it!

Delicious! I followed the recipe, except for the olives, and it turned out great. I have been making something like this for years, only we call then Fritatas. These is a great recipies to "clean out the fridge"with. I will sometime use bits of leftover meats and vegetables, or the classic in my house is zuchini, tomatos, mushrooms,onions, peppers, and different cheses. Serve it with a homemade enchilada sauce and top with sour cream, salsa , and more cheese. Maybe you could put some sliced olives on top of that?

What an absolute yummy and super easy dish to make!  You can mix and add so many different ingredients.  I've made the recipe as is (super good) and last night I made it with just ham, cheddar cheese and mild green chilies.  It was delish!  The only thing I ever do is scale it down because there are only two of us.  Pair this with Sage sausage or bacon and some fruit and I get compliments all day (or night) long!  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful!  To accomodate my family's taste I substituted in some green/red pepper and some diced honey ham.  It was easy, filling, and very well received by 4 year olds. Thanks very much for the recipe!

I changed the recipe so much, I'm not sure if it's fair enough to rate this one.  I added a lot of other ingredients (lots of veggies, cheese, bacon, hot sauce etc.), and it turned out pretty well.  I don't think I would have enjoyed it as well with the original ingredients, but really, you can make an omelet however you'd like.  In either recipe, the end result is very rich, and will fill you up for the next several hours, so I'd make this for a lot of people, not just a few.

Loved it!  I put them in muffin tins for a girls' tea party.  But I think I needed to lube the muffin tins a lot better because they did stick to the pan.  But it was really simple and really delicious!  Thank you for the recipe!

Very good. I didn't have a can of mushrooms so I used green pepper. I only used 10 eggs with diced ham and onion, green pepper and serrano peppers. Turned out great. Next time I might put the cheese on top. Thanks for the great breakfast recipe!

This is very good and very easy to make!  I left out the jalapeno peppers and mushrooms because I didn't have either, but it was still really good.  Everyone had seconds and kept saying how much they liked it.

This is the best omelet recipe I have right now. With a family of 6, cooking individual omelets takes forever. This is easy and we can add whatever ingredients we want. A lot of the time we leave out onions because of the little kids. Tonight we made it for dinner and I used crumbled bacon, spinach, extra cheese, and tomatoes. Everyone loved it!

Finally, a breakfast casserole without bread!  I've been looking for you!  I was a smidgeon worried the lack of bread would take away from the meal, but it absolutely does not.  And it is great to switch up with all different kinds of insides...I leave out the olives, just because I don't like them...my favorite is sausage instead of ham, then adding chopped green peppers and 3/4 a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with chilies on top. Yummy!

We really liked this! Great for use of leftover onions, green pepper, olives, etc. Will make again.

This was really good, but I made several changes.  Instead of Jalapeno peppers, I used a can of diced green chilies.  I didnt have any diced ham, so I cooked a package of bacon and used crumbled bacon instead.  And instead of cooking the onion in butter, I added the diced onion and the mushrooms to half of the bacon grease and sauteed them, then drained them before adding to the baking dish. I melted a little extra cheese to the top of the eggs 5 minutes before it was finished baking. It turned out really good.

I've made this a couple of times now.  Great way to use left over meat.  We've done ham, sausage, roast beef, bacon...all great.  I use whatever veggies and cheese go with whichever meat I'm using.  It's fabulous and a dinner staple in our house.  Thanks for sharing :))

Very good & easy for just about any time. Used crumbled bacon instead of the ham & left out the olives, also added a splash of hot sauce, no jalapeno peppers on hand.

Great recipe! I had plenty of leftover egg whites from making eggnog and so I used 16 egg whites and 4 whole eggs to make this.  It made more than what the recipe called for, but it was also lighter.  I used ham, red peppers, and sliced tomato on top and poured salsa on before baking.  My husband and son loved it and they both had seconds.  BTW, I forgot to grease the pan and only realized it after I had put the cheese, onions, black olives, ham, and peppers in the pan.  So I simply sprayed the pan with all the items in it and it worked -- nothing stuck to the pan.  Simple and delicious!

Awesome! My husband is never home in the mornings for breakfast so we are having it for dinner!

I reserved a half cup of cheese for the top, and fried sausage, the fresh mushroom and onions before combining. Also put in the black olives and two fresh diced tomatoes. 

Cooking time was perfect. Great great!

Wonderful meal!

Wonderful, just like other reviewers have said.  I had a few variations based on what ingredients I had on hand, such as substituting green olives for black, skipping ham and jalapenos because we didn't have any, and using fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I also used raw onions instead of sauteeing them since we were in a hurry.  It was great!  Would love to try with breakfast sausage in the future.  Maybe with tomato slices on top as another reviewer recommended.  Would have made it exactly as the recipe called for if I had the correct ingredients, but it was still great!

This made a nice, light meal when served it with toast. I sauteed the mushrooms along with the onions, used green olives instead of black, and reserved some of the cheese and sprinkled it on top after removing the omelet squares from the oven. A tasty change from regular omelets.

Good recipe. It's an easy version of a quiche, and the kids didn't shy away to badly! It was nice that I could put the mushrooms on only half of the caserole. Nice easy recipe for leftover ham.

This was great! My boyfriend and I eat eggs every weekend and needed a change, and this was perfect. We added crumbeled spicy sausage, fresh jalapeno, and drained Ro-Tel(tomatoes and chilies, hot) and some more shredded cheese on top after it was done baking (no need to put in back in the oven if you put the cheese on as soon as it comes out of the oven) Served with avacodo slices and totillas. Thanks a bunch for the recipe!

Very nice recipe for brunch. Left out the jalapeno. Used fresh sliced mushrooms that had been sauteed with the frozen diced onions. I put everything in a bowl, mixed it up and then into the pan.

I've been making this as a frittata for years, but with the following changes: no olives, no butter (I use either olive or avocado oil), add orange bell pepper, tomatoes, and spinach. And of course, I saute fresh mushrooms, garlic, and onions first. Oh, and we prefer bacon to ham.

Very good. For 4 adults, used my 9x12 cake pan. 15 eggs, added saut√©ed mushrooms and onions.  Spices.  Baked at 375 for 30 minutes.  Served ham on the side.  Pancakes for the kids.  Was a bit leftover but only a few pieces.  Needed the 15 eggs to fill the pan.  Use a foil pan or parchment paper on bottom and sides.  Sprayed pan but really hard to clean.

This was delicious! I was looking for a way to use up a lot of eggs (my chickens are laying like mad!) and I'm glad I chose this recipe! I used fresh mushrooms, added bell peppers, and Ayrshire bacon in place of ham. I also left out the butter completely, and used only about 1/3 cup of cheese. Topped with a little green onions and it was perfection! It re-heats really well too! Thanks so much for the recipe!

I substituted cooked breakfast sausage for the ham and loved this recipe.  I cut it into squares and froze them.  I can pop a few out to thaw over  night and heat in the microwave for breakfast.  Really good, and low carb!  Think I'll add spinach next time so it will almost be a crustless quicke.

So easy! Everyone loved it.  I'll definitely be making this again and will keep the basic recipe but experiment with different variations like adding peppers or zucchini or switching the ham with Italian sausage.  I baked it a tad longer, 40 minutes instead of 30 and it was perfect.

I followed the technique of putting this together, but used leftover cheese potatoes as a layer and some leftover ham.  Chopped onion and a little red peppers and black olives.   Put the cheese on bottom and used 8 large eggs and 1/2 cup milk.  Put in  a 9x9 pan. Very good!

We thoroughly enjoyed this. I used Olive Oil instead of butter and there was no liquid whatsoever once it had cooked. I didn't use Olives or Jalapenos this time as I wanted to try it as a pure breakfast meal. I will add that it is very filling, so basically halve the ingredients if there is only two of you (unless you save the rest for leftovers of course). I might try bacon instead of ham next time and will definitely try the jalapenos as Mexican is my favourite food. Overall though yummy!

I used this as a technique recipe since the ingredients listed did not thrill me at all.  I made 2 for a big crowd and they were excellent.  You absolutely have to pre-cook anything going into them.  There is just not enough time in the oven.  I added 1 tbs of flour to the eggs to give it just a little stick togetherness.  Next time I'm not going to and see if they come out more fluffy.  I will absolutely use this technique again, just not the ingredients in the recipe.

This checked all the boxes for me. Easy, filling, delicious, low carb...check, check,check, check! Made this exactly as written, except put a little more cheese on top, and had to bake for 45 minutes in order for the center to set. Served with a dollup of sour cream on top, and sliced tomato and avocado on the side. YUM!!!!

A tasty & easy recipe!  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe (exactly).  I then made it again for my family, on our Tuesday evening 'Breakfast for Dinner'.  The only olives  I had on hand were green olives stuffed w/pimentos, so I sliced them in half & used them.  Instead of using regular milk, I used (light) Evaporated Milk.... since it makes for a much more 'creamier' dish.  I sprinkled the dish with some whole wheat Panko breadcrumbs, mixed w/some Parmesan cheese (from the green jar) which I lightly seasoned w/garlic powder, dried parsley,  and a sprinkle of Italian Seasoning.  I sprayed the top of the seasoned breadcrumbs w/ "I can't Believe It's Not Butter" spray, before I put the dish into the oven.  Our baked omelet was incredible!  I served it w/ ("Jenni-O") Turkey Italian Sausages, and Hash Browns.  This is definitely a recipe which is worth saving.

I made minor changes. I omitted the olives, used fresh mushrooms (cooked with the onions) and added already cooked asparagus cut into 1" pieces. I love the texture and the crispiness of the edges. I wish every piece had an edge. LOL  Thanks for sharing!

Really good and simple to make. What I didn't add for various reasons was onions, black olives, jalopenos, and butter. What I did add, mostly because it's what I had in the fridge, was fresh mushrooms and spinach. Oh, and I threw in a dash of thyme just because. I'm already thinking about the different veggies and meats I can add next time I make it.

Pretty solid recipe. We used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. It was a little watery, and maybe thats why.

I tried it with bacon instead of ham and cooked the onions in the bacon grease. It was great. This is a wonderful low carbohydrate breakfast that can be made ahead of time. Thank you for the idea!

I made a couple of changes to suit our family. No ham, no hot peppers,  sweet peppers to almost half of it do to a picky eater. Then it was perfect. I also added a little mild chunky salsa and just a little sour cream to my individual serving. I will be making this again.

Very very good recipe! Made this on a Sunday morning for the heck of it, but this would be a wonderful holiday morning recipe. The only changes I made were: skipped the mushrooms; added diced green pepper saut√©ed with the onion; added a layer of cheese to the top. I included the diced ham which made it a hearty breakfast. It also makes a beautiful presentation, too. After trying this, I will add the mushrooms next time, as I can only imagine it will be better!

This sounds very much like something I created on the fly, 10 years ago, for a potluck breakfast only I didn't use butter, jalapeno peppers, or ham.  I used a 10-count pkg. of Swift's Brown & Serve sausages and cut them into very thin "pennies".   I also didn't use salt and pepper - the combined flavors of the egg, sausages, onion, mushrooms, black olives (a full size can and chopped up the olives) and shredded SHARP cheddar cheese were all that was needed.  The casserole went over so well that I wasn't allowed to return to the monthly breakfasts unless I brought it - and they ANNOUNCED, in advance, that I'd be bringing it!  LOL

Yummy! Xmas morning brunch.  We used turkey bacon for the sausage. I threw fresh mushrooms in with the onions and then threw the olives and some spinach and chopped bacon in at the end. Spread into the pan and layered the cheese and eggs on top and baked. Used unsweetened coconut milk for cows milk. 
 Especially enjoyed the olives in it. Excellent as left overs. Even good cold!

WOW!  This is really good!  

I halved the recipe (because I didn't want to use 12 eggs) and used the opportunity to substitute items that were lingering in the fridge - leftover steak, Kalamata olives, roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, and mushrooms.  I also used a shallot instead of an onion and canned green chili instead of jalapenos.  I honestly forgot the salt and pepper, but it is very flavorful without seasoning.  

This is a dish that we will enjoy often.

This recipe sounded so good when I read it that I made it right then and there.  We loved it.  It is nice to find a recipe with all the ingredients on hand. I did saut√© fresh mushrooms along with onion, red and green peppers.   We like things a bit spicey., so of course added the olives and jalape√±os and served it with an optional salsa topping.  I will be making this again and again.

this recipe was a winner in my book.  I made it for Mother's day Brunch.  I did not have ham so I used Italian style chicken sausage.  It saut√©ed some red pepper with the onion.  otherwise followed the complete recipe.  I will definitely make this again because it is versatile.

Fantastic recipe!  I made this for my Sunday school class yesterday.  So, I cut it in smaller pieces to ensure there was plenty to go around.  I came home with 5 pieces.  I did not put the black olives in it and I used fresh mushrooms.  I also put fresh spinach in it and added a little extra cheese to the top.  It is easy peasy and can always be made ahead of time.

I have made this for several years and it is always a request when I am one of the hostesses for our golf club.    You can tweek it with other ingredients and it is still the best.   You can't go wrong with this one for sure.

This is a great recipe for either breakfast, brunch, or as a lunch entree with salad. I have made this many times and just vary the ingredients to make it slightly different each time. My favourite is to use just 1 tbsp of butter to saut√© onion and diced zucchini, then layer on the cheddar cheese base, pour the egg mixture over the top, then add fresh sliced cherry tomatoes to the top before baking. Some of the tomatoes fall to the bottom but once it's cooked they end up on the top and add some nice colour to the dish. I have also made these in muffin cups for brunches and they are a huge hit as a finger food. They take about 20 minutes in the muffin cups. Make sure they are well greased or use parchment paper muffin cup liners. Enjoy!

we really liked this!  I love olives but, thought they might be a little odd in an omelet but, they were great!  Did not add extra salt because of them.  Followed the recipe (adding thick sliced deli ham)with the exception of the jalapeno as the DH won't even go near them in the grocery store.  :)  Will make again for sure maybe trying it with sausage or bacon.

Our church had a Mother's Day Brunch today. Two of us cooked different variations of this, 2 each. I did alter things a bit, and the cooking time was greatly exceeded.

Since was making a double recipe I used a yellow & red onion, and sprinkled in thyme to bring about a heavenly aroma. Also added some black pepper, not much.
In the layers had added cooked white rice. One pan had 14 oz can of spinach, the other asparagus. Both had a mixture of shredded cheddar & mozzarella cheese.
Also used Kosher salt over regular salt, and normal black pepper. Also used diced tomatoes to the layers, which resulted in having to add an additional 6 eggs + 1/4 cup of milk per pan.

Spinach version took about 1.5 hours to cook, probably due to the moisture. Asparagus cooked for an hour before it set up.

As for the critics, they all enjoyed this recipe. Was a great hit even though was an hour late to the brunch. Still, I came home with minimal left-overs. Thanks for a wonderful recipe to work from!

This was great.  I was able to customize portions of the pan so that those who didn't want certain extras (like Mushrooms that I added for me) could have their omelet as usual.  Another hit, and especially for those post holiday breakfasts when there are still family members in the house.

I did not make any of the suggested changes and that was a mistake.  Mine was a little dry and tasteless. If there is a next time I will review suggestions more carefully.

Made this today and did like it. I really like that it is made without bread or potatoes. Since it is just hubby and me, I halved the recipe.  Used the optional ham.  Used a mix of sharp and mild cheddar.  We just felt it was missing something. Next time I will add a small can of chopped green chilis to see if that does the trick.  I will also get a picture posted as soon as I can.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

These Baked Omelet Squares were wonderful! I added olives, and also put in chopped and sauteed ham, onion, and green bell pepper.  I warmed up the remainder a couple of days later and it was even better! I highly recommed this recipe!

I served this dish on Christmas morning. Measuring the ingredients ahead of time made this a really quick dish. I didn't have the olives or jalapeno peppers but used more black forest ham. I also used crimini mushrooms which really gave it a nice flavor. I just wished I had of made 2 pans because everybody wanted to have more. Thanks for the recipe. A sure hit!

This turned out very good, and was super versatile. I browned up 1 lb pork sausage with  1/2 small onion, a few mushrooms, and chopped jalapenos. Added sage and red pepper flakes (omitted the butter). Sprinkled 3/4 cup cheese on bottom of greased 7x11 inch pan. Covered with meat mixture. Then poured 8 eggs whisked with 1/3 cup milk, salt and pepper over that. I then sprinkled with another 1/4 cup shredded cheese and baked at 400 for abour 25 minutes. So many different ways you could make this recipe. Loved it!

Delicious, thanks! I omitted the olives, ham, and jalapenos, and scaled the recipe down to 8 eggs. Sauteed green onions and fresh mushrooms with the onion ahead of time. Had to use Mexican cheese blend since I didn't have Cheddar. It was a huge hit with my family - I'll be making the full recipe size next time! Will also add in diced tomatoes, which I think would be a great addition.

This was a hit in our family.  It was easy to make and easy to modify depending on what I had available.  Didn't have ham, black olives, or jalapenos, and my kids aren't fans of onions so I made mine with green olives, mushrooms, and Oscar Mayer bacon bits (red package).  I also used 2 full cups of cheese since that was what I had in the pkg. and we do love our cheese here in MN!!  My husband really liked it and I will be making this again and again!  Thanks!

Just OK; the eggs were a little rubbery. I used sauteed peppers, onions, mushrooms. Added the olives and ham. The cheese melts well on the bottom. Won't make again, though.

This is really great!  We were looking for a new breakfast idea, and this fit the bill.  Love the cheese layer at the bottom. I sauteed one onion, one green bell pepper, 1/2 red bell pepper, and fresh mushrooms for the veggies.  No black olives or jalapenos--just didn't think we would like it in the morning, but I'm sure it would be good.

I made this for myself for lunch using leftover ham.  It was really good!  I liked the texture, the flavor and it was really easy to put together.  I didn't use mushrooms because I don't like them and I only had green olives.  Otherwise I made it as called for.  I let the onions get nice and caramelized and the flavor was perfect. I will make this over and over and can't wait for my husband to try it!

This is so easy and soooo good. My kids loved it. Easy to adapt to what you like. I layered the cheese in the pan then some turkey sausage links that I had chopped and cooked in a skillet. On one half of the pan I layered cooked onion and mushrooms for my husband and I and left the other half veggie free for my picky kids. It cooked up perfectly golden brown and the cheese bubbled up through the egg. My husband has never really cared for hashbrown- or bread-based egg bakes so this was perfect!! Thanks!

This is one of the best breakfast bakes I have ever tried. You can change up the ingredients the way you like. I add sausage and bacon. This has become our Christmas morning tradition as well.

Super easy and flexible. I made half with cheese, bacon, ham and onion; the other half with cheese, mushroom and onion.  The leftovers were just as great the next day. This is a keeper.

this was a hit at Easter.  Used green onions instead of regular and added more cheese to top as suggested.

I make something similar, using what I have on hand all the time to bring to work! Everyone loves it. So simple! It is great with spinach and edamame.

This was pretty good, but it was a tad rubbery. Maybe I cooked it too long? I didn't have any ham, so I used Real Bacon Bits and cooked turkey sausages and chopped them up. I added a can of chopped green chilis and some crushed red pepper to one side, to accomodate my boyfriend's extreme love of spicy food. Thanks!

This is the best breakfast casserole I have ever made! I used tomatoes, mushrooms, and ham and it was wonderful. It was also easy to adapt for individual tastes. My sister, who was going to be eating it, doesn't like mushrooms so I just left mushrooms out of one corner of the casserole. It worked perfectly.

I tried this recipe to use up some leftover ham for our Christmas morning breakfast last year.  Well, I'll be making it again this year and the next year, and the next!  My family LOVED this recipe- with quality ham it is amazing.  I made without ham and it was still good, but the ham really adds a lot of flavor.  Enjoy!

This went over well with the boys and the adults!  This is such an easy mix n'match meal.  You can use whatever you have in the pantry & fridge! Thank you for such a wonderful recipe idea.

This recipe was a hit at the health center where I am working for the summer before going back to college.  It was easy!  I made one with jalapenos and one without.  Both were quickly devoured.  There were a lot of requests for the recipe.

This was good.  Not the greatest breakfast I have ever made, but I did not have all of the ingredients.
