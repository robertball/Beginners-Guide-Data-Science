This rating is from my husband, I don't drink alcohol, so I made this for him, A WELCOME HOME DRINK on a night he came home from Temporary duty assignment and had been gone 3 months. He bought Spiced Rum and couldn't find Cherry vanilla cola, so he brought home just Cherry cola and I added vanilla to his drink....he really liked it. And I doubled the batch....and he polished off with a blech......so if that tells ya something--he liked it. No clue what jigger rum is, but he said it was really good. Thanks!

I didn't have cherry vanilla coke, so I just added added a tbsp. of vanilla syrup to my cherry coke. This was a little sweet, but still tasty. I used Captain's Tattoo rum for this drink.

For all interested they had to change names because of brands, I always used Bacardi 151 (hence the name Last Call) in this and Cherry Vanilla Dr Pepper

To the person who didn't know what "jigger rum" is, it isn't rum, a jigger is a measurement. On a shaker bottle, it's the small cap that comes off the pour spout, and doubles as a measurement for about one shot. Anyway, pretty darn good

I didn't have any Maraschino cherries, so I used some of the chokecherry syrup that I had in my fridge from the batch I made last week. Delicious!!

I made this drink and I loved it! Omit the sugar otherwise it will be too sweet. I used Cherry Dr. Pepper for this drink and I will definitely make it again
