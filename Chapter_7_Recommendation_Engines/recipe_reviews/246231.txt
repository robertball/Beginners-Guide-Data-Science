Decided to make because I had all the ingredients and I'm glad.  It's so easy and quick to make.  Really tasty!  They cool off fast so eat quickly.

I didn't have bread crumbs so I put some wheat Chex in a baggie and crushed them to substitute. I used 3 tablespoons of coconut and omitted the sugar since my coconut was sweetened. Turned out yummy!

very easy and delicious. Everyone loved it. Made with crushed up chex, coconut, no sugar, more sugar.  Would put in processor next time so is more fine so would stick better.

Delicious and healthy dessert/snack option! I used panko breadcrumbs, and I think that was a great addition. I will def be making these again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
