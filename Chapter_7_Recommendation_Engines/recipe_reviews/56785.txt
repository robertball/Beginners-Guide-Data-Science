I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I couldn't find low-sodium oyster sauce.  I wish had been able to - it was on the salty side.  Having said that, the steaks were still delicious, and my whole family wants me to make this again.

This was soooooo good! I was a little leary of the amount of oyster sauce, but it really works well! I didn't let my steaks marinade long enough, but they still had an excellent taste. I'd definetely make this one again!

My husband and I grilled steaks using this recipe for valentine's day.  He was a little concerned about the oyster sauce but it was totally worth it and very yummy.  We will surely do this recipe again and again.

remember if you leave the meat marinating too long in citrus juice it will cook the meat. I tried this recipe with a combination of juices orange, lime and lemon...

This smelled good, but made the meat taste like teriyaki beef jerky. It would be a good marinade for that, but not for steak.

Excellent flavor but my husband wanted more of it. We only marinated for two hours but next time I will do overnight or at least six hours. Used the recipe as it was written and it was great. Didn't think it was acidic in the least bit. Liked this very much and can't wait to make this easy recipe once again.

Easy recipe, but very bland. I could not find the oyster sauce and didn't know what steak seasoning meant.  I will definitely try again and look for these ingredients.  I am sure it will make a difference.

this is a great recipe, even for those of us that are challenged at cooking.  I marinated the steaks overnight and cooked them on a grill. They were tender and very tasty.

The flavour really went through the steak well however I found the bitterness of the beer & lemon combined with the salty oyster sauce overpowering. I think it needs some brown sugar to balance out the flavour. The meat was very tender however if you BBQ it (like I did) watch for the flames due to the alcohol!

Very Good!  5 Stars!  The steaks that we used weren't entirely tender, yet this marinade made them so juicy and tasty that it didn't matter at all.  Love it!

An okay recipe, but not the best way to cook or marinate a stake.  Came out kind of bland.

I have been using this marinade for about two years now.  We really love it.  I finally remembered to come in to review it as I have steaks marinating in it right now.  I make the marinade just as the recipe says, we love the taste of the oyster sauce.

Used expensive cut rib steaks (got on sale!)- only marinated for 3 hours - turned out perfectly.  The taste lingers in my  thoughts!!!!  Putting this recipe in my super favorite box!  Thanks submitter.

This was great!  I used rib eye steaks, and marinated for most of the day.  The flavors just exploded in my mouth.  One of the best steak recipes I have ever done, and I've done a lot.  One word of advice.  Be sure to buy true oyster sauce is you can, not oyster flavor, which is mostly sugar.
Also, I grilled the steaks to med-rare/medium, and they were very tender as well as tastie.  A keeper for sure.

Yuk!  Way too salty and tangy. I couldn't eat my steak and my husband ate his reluctantly. If you are going to try this don't use a good quality cut as you may be disappointed.

I used filet mignon and they came out flavorful even when I accidentally left them on the grill too long.  Will definitely make again.

This was a very good recipe. My husband loved it and said it was the best steak I've ever made. I didn't have oyster sauce, so I omitted that. I didn't have steak seasoning, so I mixed Kosher salt, black pepper and garlic powder and rubbed the mixture into the meat before placing in the marinade. I marinated for about 2 hours, but next time will try longer. I also cooked the steaks in the broiler as opposed to the grill, due to the fact that it is the middle of winter and my grill is covered in snow! Reading the other reviews, I'm glad I omitted the oyster sauce as some felt it was too salty. Very yummy!

After all the rave reviews, I was disappointed in the end result of this recipe.  I let it marinate in the fridge about 8 hours and the steaks were definitely lacking in something.

I'm neutral about this recipe.  I was intrigued about the garlic and oyster sauce combination but I think the beer taste was too strong for me.  I marinated my steak overnight and it was fairly tender (I used oyster steak which isn't the best cut) but I don't think I'll be making this again.

Easy, flavorful, though the oyster sauce is a little expensive.  We marinated the steaks overnight and they were tender and delicious.  We will definitely make again.  Even our 1-year-old wolfed down a ton of steak- his first meat!

Great marinade, always use a good dark beer when making this recipe. I always use Rogue and my steaks come out great.

eh. Nothing really special. Maybe b/c I omitted the oyster sauce (i didn't have any on hand). Added 2 extra cloves of garlic & onion powder. Will try again w/ a more flavorful beer than Bud Light.

Good marinade--nice flavor.  Didn't use any additional steak sauce for flavoring.  What's the point of that?
