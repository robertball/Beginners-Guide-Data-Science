Made this in the crock pot and it turned out wonderful and thick. Used fresh (instead of frozen) collard greens that I needed to use up. Kept everything pretty much the same as called for and it was wonderful. Don't really need too much salt or pepper. The main ingredients provide enough natural seasoning and taste.

Great recipe!  Everyone in the family loved it.  Makes a big pot of thick, hearty soup/stew.  If too thick for your liking add an extra cup of water.  Not much tweaking needed...only added an extra clove of garlic.  Bacon was too soft, so next time I'll cook the bacon until crisp, remove from pan and then saute the onion, green pepper and garlic. Don't dice the potatoes too small or they'll break apart when cooked.  Would also be good with black-eyed peas.  Definitely a great tasting soup!

This definitely is a hearty soup. A great way to use collard greens. It was a bit on the thick side, an extra cup of water with 1 tsp. of beef granules made it perfect, or I should say to our liking. We shall make this dish again during the winter months. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious soup and a great way to use collard greens! Came out great in the crockpot! Fried 4 slices of bacon, onion and garlic, drained and put in bottom of crockpot.  In same pan (minus the bacon fat!) i sliced up one pound of lite kielbasa, put cut and washed collard greens on top and let it cook down a few minutes.  Added that to crockpot.  To the crockpot I added 2 cut up potatoes, poured 1 container chicken broth over all of it, and cooked on low for 6 hours.  Unbelievably delicious and even better the next day. Next time I would cut potatoes a little smaller, and maybe add carrots.  You don't need any salt if you make it in the crockpot, the kielbasa and bacon are salty enough.

Loved the heartiness of this.  Made a pot of it to take into work for a pot luck and it went quick, no leftovers to take home.  I like my food a little on the spicy side so I added about 1/4 - 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes and cumin while saut√©ing the onion and bell pepper and also added some beef granules to another batch for added flavor. This recipe is great and easy to make and adjust to your taste buds and is also a winner for the crock pot.

This was very good! Instead of water, I used reduced-sodium/fat free chicken broth, and instead of regular smoked sausage, I used turkey smoked sausage.  I didn't have any bacon, so I left that out.  Instead of frozen collard greens, I used about 12-13 oz of fresh chopped collards.  I put it in the crockpot on high for 2 1/2 hours but that wasn't long enough, so I put it on the stove for another 30 minutes and it was perfect.

The total cooking turns the potatoes to mush; great if you want them to act as a thickener.  I planned ahead, cut them in good sized pieces and added them during the last 15 minutes.  This is really a stick-to-your-ribs meal.

I made this almost exactly as written, leaving out only the bacon (but I did use bacon fat to cook the onions, etc.).  This soup was really delicious but it cooked FAR too long and the potatoes and beans were mushy.  I will make this again cooking it probably half the time.  Other than that, this was yummy!

I was looking for a way to use up fresh collard greens and didn't have very high expectations.  But this was a big hit at my house.  I used dried beans so I added them with the kolbassi.  I had canned diced potatoes so used them instead of fresh.  Like other reviewers, this got really thick especially the second day for leftovers, so have a can of chicken broth on hand to thin it down.  That worked great for us.  As with most soups, this was even better the second day.  There was plenty for two dinners.

This was the best soup! When I saw it I was a little un-sure cause it's doesn't look highly appealing. But the taste made up for that! I changed it up a little by adding like the other lady said (water) and some hot sauce... Give it a little personality of your own. But all the around it was great!

I've made this recipe a couple of times and that was the first time I've ever eaten collard greens and I thought it was great.  My teenage kids even liked it.  I've used turkey bacon and kielbasa, and I couldn't find frozen collard greens so I used fresh bagged ones.

Made the crockpot version and loved it.  Extremely tasty when following the recipe exactly.  It's a little greasy because of the sausage, but the taste is worth the splurge.

I made this sans meat with some mushroom stock. Very hearty and very good. Added some red pepper flakes and it was good to go!

Amazing - totally different way to enjoy Collards!  Only change I made was the using chicken broth for water (and more of it) and the meat - since we had leftover ham along with a few potatoes I needed to use and a bunch of fresh greens. (oops - my greens were fresh too)  I made it all together in a pot on the stove, then put the whole thing in the crockpot on low for a great "eat as you pass by" pre-Christmas-shopping meal."  
One last thing - DON'T forget the green pepper portion of the dish - I almost did, it was the only thing I had to out for on the list, but it is essential to the total taste of the soup.  Again - just amazing - and so nice to have a second way to serve greens that totally switches them up!

The proportions of kielbasa are too high and out "12" servings was enough for 4, but w/a ton of extra meat. I'd half the meat suggestions next time. Also, I combined the ingredients more quickly than they said to save time and it was still a wonderful, yummy soup - and I'm glad I didn't waste the extra 45 mins. cooking it.

Just want to add that you don't need a lot of salt as the Kielbasa and Bacon add enough. I added some before tasting, and it didn't need the extra salt.   Also, I only used one can of beans, and fresh collards..it came out delicious! The green peppers ads a nice flavor too!

Seriously, this recipe is a "must-try"!  I made this exactly as written with collard greens from our weekly CSA box, and my husband and I both enjoyed this very much.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

Having grown up in Indiana, collards weren't familiar to me till recently. We recently grew collards in our Florida garden and weren't happy with the traditional recipes we tried; too greasy and salty for our tastes. But this is fabulous. I used low-sodium chicken base to make the broth; no extra salt necessary. Great way to take advantage of this nutritious veggie in a one-pot dish! I served with jalapeno/cheese corn muffins. All five of us + friends loved it!

Delicious soup!  I only used 1 pkg of turkey kielbasa. Also, I needed to use up a 10-oz. bag of fresh spinach, so I used that instead of collard greens. Perfect! There was plenty for hubby and I to have seconds and enough leftover for another meal. YUM!

I'm eating a bowl right now. Yummy! I used home made chicken broth instead of the water, and hot (spicy) smoked sausage. I used fresh collards, removing the stems first, and added the collards 15 minutes before adding the potatoes, then cooked another 20-25 minutes before adding the remaining ingredients. I also used 4 cloves of garlic, because this really does make a big pot of stew, and the garlic won't be overpowering. I'll be freezing individual bowls of this, and I look forward to having more another day when I'm too busy to cook.

I am trying to figure out how the heck anyone made this soup with only 1 quart of water! I ended up using about 5 times that- even after the collards cooked down the soup resembeled just a big pot of moist veggies. I ended up having to transfer the whole thing to a much larger pot just to accomodate the extra water I had to add just to make this look like soup. Since the water diluted all the flavor from the kielbasa ( I also had cut that down to one package like a previous review recommended),I had to throw in a bunch of beef bouillon cubes to give the broth more flavor. Also, I would recommend just cooking the bacon separately, removing the bacon from the pan then sauteeing the onion, garlic and green pepper in the bacon grease. I wasn't able to get the bacon crisp cooking it with the onion and pepper, which added a lot of extra moisture. All in all I like the ingredients and concept, but the recipe definately needs tweeking to get a decent bowl of soup.

This soup was excellent!  I didn't have any collard greens, so I used spinach instead.  Did not add bacon, tasted great without it. Added one more clove of garlic, some red pepper flakes and a little beef bouillon to give the both more flavor.  Will make again!
