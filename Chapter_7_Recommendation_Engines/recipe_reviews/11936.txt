My family LOVES this macaroni salad and they are hard to please.  I use mayonnaise instead of salad dressing and omit the tomatoes.

This recipe was great.  This could be a low fat dish.  Just substitute low fat mayo and low fat milk and you have a wonderful dish.  It sure makes alot so do not double recipe.  Next time I think I will use one cup of marconi instead of 2.

This is a keeper!

This was great......I made it for dinner last night, and my husband loved it. The only thing I did different was put some hidden valley ranch dressing into the miricle whip mixture and it was great. I also used grape tomatoes as another reviewer suggested. Was really good. will make again.

Very tasty and easy to make.  Added one HB egg, used about 1/2 the dressing and added some seasoned salt - perfect.

I think this your basic marcaroni salad (minus the tomatoes). I had to leave them out anyway cause the kids don't like them. I added yellow mustard in place of mustard powder.  Added paprika and 1 tbls. sweet pickle relish. Although it may sound odd, my mom always added her "secret" ingredient--"cubed ham" cause that way the only was us kids would eat it.  I found out as an adult it was ham but "spam"!  I told my kids the same thing growing up.  Of course, they love it!

I really debated about whether to give this recipe a 4 or 5.  I was glad that I followed my instincts and used about a third less dressing, but it was still too much for my taste.  However, it is really a good salad, and I will make it again with half the salad dressing.

I made this for our Mothers Day gathering. Everyone enjoyed it. The only thing I will do differently is to add red onion or a sweet onion and perhaps some ranch dressing. My husband wanted me to add come cheese next time. It was a very good recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I used half gold tomatoes since my neighbor has a whole mess of them, and it added another color. This was OK but I'm mostly in agreement with those saying it lacks some flavor as is.  Miracle Whip has a bit of a tang, but this did not come off in the salad.  It took me a bit to figure out that I *think* it might be the milk just killing that natural tang and making it a bit of a dead mayo thing.  It seems several are now adding ranch dressing mix to it, which would kick it up a bit, but that's not this recipe.  I didn't think of that and had a hard time sprucing it up.  As one person said, though, it is a good way to use up cucumbers and I didn't think it was too many but mine were smallish.

This is a good BASE for a macaroni salad but the recipe as-is is lacking flavor. I cut out the tomatoes and used 2 celery stalks, a red pepper and 1/2 of a green pepper. I used about a tablespoon of ranch dessing mix and a little yellow mustard to taste, added some black pepper, dried parsley, and white wine vinegar. This needs to sit an hour or 2 before serving to let the flavors develop. if you use the ranch mix I think you can leave out the onion.

Very good! I altered the recipe slightly... I used 1/2 red pepper instead of green, added some green onion and paprika.  Used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup ranch dressing.  Will make again!

If you like the taste of Mayo then you'll love this recipe b/c that's all it tasted like... I added about 2 tbs of season salt and even more than the 2 cups of macaroni but it was still pure mayo, then my friend added some Mrs Dash to give it some more taste before we actually ate it but that only slightly added flavor to it. I did not care for this recipe at all but a few people did so like I said if you like the taste of mayo this is the recipe for you.

I make this salad all the time, however, I use like 4 cups of shell macaroni, 2 cups grape tomatoes cut in half and top it with homemade ranch dressing.  Very tasty.

I enjoyed this recipe... great for taking to work for lunch or w/BBQ - picnic... I've made this several times and enjoyed it... I would do the veggies to taste...2 cucumbers was a lot! and I added diced tomatoes - best after refrigeration.

This pasta salad was pretty good, but a little bland.  I found that adding parsely and some real bacon bits added a lot of flavor.

This is a great macaroni salad, I was looking for a recipe that did not call for celery, because I did not have any on hand and did not want to make a trip to the grocery store just for celery. I did make some alterations, because I personally do not like salad dressing ( miracle whip, or others of the same ) so I used real mayonnaise with olive oil. When making the dressing for for the salad I taste tested as I knew it may be on the bland side ( using mayo instead ) so I added one package of .08 oz dry Italian dressing flavoring packet ( Nature Valley ) and one tablespoon of distilled white vinager. When making the vege mix I only had Roma ( plum ) tomatoes on hand and the recipe did not specify the tomato type so I used 3 large Roma tomatoes. I also added about one cup of matchstick carrots. The end result was fantastic. This is now the only Mac salad I will make. Love It. Thanks so much for sharing.

This is a delicious light and fresh salad.   It was easy to make and I really enjoy how the flavors enhance each other, this tastes best after a few hours in the fridge.  The only thing I changed was I used hot sauce instead of pepper.

Pretty good but the dressing tasted like pure mayonaise. I added onion power and parsley flakes to lessen the mayo taste and it was good.

This is a good salad-however, I would recommend adding a little more mayo, as this was a bit dry if made the night before.

Good recipe to use up all those cucumbers.  I will add a little more pasta next time as my husband thought it was a little too "vegeatable" to be called a pasta salad.

I HAVE LIKED THIS RECIPE FOR MACARONI SALAD SINCE I WAS ABOUT 15 YEARS OLD AND HAD SOME  AT A BIGGG CHURCH 
 DINNER.. I GOT THE RECIPE .THAT WAS ABOUT 1953... THAT LADY  FRIEND WAS KILLED IN A HORRIBLE CAR CRASH ONLY A FEW  YEARS LATER... I WILL NOT CHANGE MY INGREDIENTS.. I STILL LOVE IT.. I TAKE BIGGG BOWLS OF IT TO CHURCH  AND OTHER DINNERS OFTEN...I DO PUT RED AND YELLOW TOMATOES IN IT IF I HAVE THEM... I ALSO USE SWEET ONIONS NOW BECAUSE  MOST ONIONS HURT ME...I ALSO USE MAYONNAISE NOT SALAD DRESSING... I WILL NEVER  CHANGE GENERAL INGREDIENTS...CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE COULD EAT THIS AND NOT LIKE IT.  MANY OF MY FAMILY  LOVE IT ALSO... AZALEA WORRELL FARISS

Instead of milk I used sour cream. Added prepared mustard, sugar and vinegar.

This recipe was easy to make and ready in less then one half hour, cooling time not included to let the flavors come together. Did not change a thing, use the Miracle Whip which is sweeter then mayo.  a veggie delight

The recipe was fine the way it is but the first time I made it I added the Pampered Chef Dill Mix.  It was kind of runny from the milk so the 2nd time I made it, I used 8 oz. of sour cream instead and that was the ticket. Wonderful!

This was bland.  I'm going to have to figure out what to add to make it taste.

Quick and easy macaroni salad.  As others have mentioned, I omitted the tomatoes and used 1/2 mayonnaise and 1/2 ranch dressing.  I also used 1 heaping teaspoon of pickle relish and 4 hard boiled eggs, chopped, and even one of our picky kids ate it up!
