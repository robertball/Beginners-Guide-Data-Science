I skipped the extra layer of bread in the middle only because I'm low on bread until grocery day. I just layered the meat and cheese like I would any other sandwich. I added a little Frank's Hot Sauce to the egg wash and fried these in a little butter in the cast iron skillet. Frying them in the cast iron skillet gave it a wonderful crust.  To say that my family liked these would be an understatement. My littlest can't stop talking about it.

I leave the crust on the bread.  Also, I only use turkey if I happen to have it.  I also put just a little bit of dijon mustard on the bread.  These turn out really good and very crunchy!

I did not care for this recipe. Way too heavy on the bread and breading.  I think I'll stick with the original, thanks!

These were tasty but very greasy. I only made 1 layer of sandwich & cut into 4ths, they were very filling & we could only eat 2-3 squares each(although we did have green beans & grapes on the side to make it a little healthier :D)  I loved the crunch but even though I drained them on paper towels we all kind felt nauseated after eating them-probably because we aren't used to eating so much grease. But give this recipe a try if you like deep fried.  If I made these again I would try just pan frying them lightly instead of frying in grease.

Yes! I have been looking for a Monte Cristo sandwich recipe ever since I had this sandwich at Disneyland. Though this one is a different take on the traditional Monte Cristo, the panko bread crumbs really added a nice crunch. We dipped ours in raspberry preserves heated in a pan to make a sauce. Going on our favorites list!
