Honest - this is the real thing.  The secret is the Dashi granules.  I'm a teacher and had a Japanese student bring me the box his mom used to make their miso soup.  Had to go to a Japanese market to get it - but it was worth it.  They do sell miso with dashi flavoring - which I used.  I used soft tofu, and added some sliced ginger while heating the soup.  It was just like my local restaurant - and I'm so glad I can make it cheaper than the $1.50 they charge for a small bowl.  Will fix it often!  Miso is supposed to be very healthy.  High sodium, though.  The market sold low-sodium miso - may try that when I'm out of the current one.

Really great miso soup! We had enjoyed a delicious miso soup at a Sushi restaurant in Cleveland,OH and I was trying to come close to that. We actually thought this one was better. I used a red miso paste, firm tofu, green onions, and 4 thinly sliced Shitake mushrooms. Will be making this often... Oh, I bought the miso paste and dashi from Asiangrocer.com since our small town grocery stores don't carry these items.

I suggest using firm tofu (it is easier to handle) and letting it drain first.  Cut it in half and let it sit on some paper towels for a bit before you use it.  This allows the tofu to better absorb the flavor of the broth.

This recipe can be easily adapted to whatever's in season, or in the fridge.  If you're a potato lover, a simple but very comforting potato version  - in the quantity of dashi given here simmer thinly sliced wedges of potato (approximatly 2 medium potatoes, sliced 3 mm thick or so) and sliced onion (one small onion, cut in half vertically, and then into thin slices, again vertically).  Simmer until tender, and then add miso just before turning off heat.  Carrot, daikon, long onion (negi), spinach (add a minute or so before adding the miso) are other winter possiblities - add in any combination you prefer.  I often add thinly sliced deep-fried tofu (abura-age in Japanese) to my winter miso soup - a common staple here in Japan, but perhaps not so readily available elsewhere.

This was a big hit!  I could not find dashi anywhere, so substituted fish bouillon.  I added fresh spinach and prawns before the tofu to make it a meal.

I have a Japanese neighbor and she stated that you cannot just wisk in the miso, you need to put the miso in a very fine strainer, put the strainer half way in the water and press miso thru with a spoon. Miso has some left over bits and pieces that for some reason does not ever melt. This is supposed to be disposed of. The second time I did as my neighbor stated and it turned out better. She also gave me some bamboo roots to put in it. I also added tofu.

I grew up eating miso soup made various ways. This is a good basic miso soup. I always use Shiro Miso, which is a white miso (less salty) than the Aka Miso, red miso paste. Some people also like to mix both for more bolder flavor. To whisk in the miso paste, I normally hold two spoons, with the miso paste in the first spoon and using the other spoon to mash the paste into the water. The dashi I use has no MSG and since I was only serving two people I scaled this amonunt down quite a bit. I don't use silken tofu but medium firm which is a personal choice. I garnished the soup with thinly minced green onions (see my picture). Miso soup doesn't take me too long to make. There are so many vegetables you can add in miso soup such as shiitake mushroom, daikon, other mushrooms, leafy greens, etc. This was a warm and satisfying soup that paired perfectly with, "Japanese Deep Fried Shrimp," "Japanese Shrimp Sauce I," "Japanese-Style Sesame Green Beans,"and "Cucumber Sunomono," all from this website. I drank every last drop of miso soup!

This had a nice taste but the silken tofu I used was too soft. I suggest a firm tofu. I also used a dashi that was MSG free. I think that is why it needed some salt for me. A really easy and quick recipe.

Easy recipe. Broth was excellent. I'd use firm tofu next time, as that's what I've always had at the restaurants and the silken's texture made me cringe.

I studied in Japan as a college student, and this is pretty much how I learned to make miso soup from friends in Japan. Just a few notes:
Miso: I was taught to mix the miso in a small bowl with a bit of the broth to dissolve it before adding it to the pot. Otherwise it's harder to incorporate it into the soup. If your miso has chunks that won't dissolve, you can put this small bowlful through a sieve before adding to the pot. 
Tofu: Generally, softer tofu is used for soups and hard tofu is for dishes like stir fry where it will be stirred or moved around a lot. That's why the recipe calls for what it does. But get what you like.
Seaweed: While you're at the Asian grocery store picking up your miso and dashi, grab some wakame seaweed. You just have to reconstitute it by putting a small amount in a bowl of water while you're making the rest of the soup. When the soup is ready, the wakame should be, too. Chop into 2-3" pieces if desired - some bits of wakame may be quite large. Put it into the soup and serve.

Tastes identical to miso soup you would buy at a restaurant.  The measurements are just right!  

We love miso soup, but I have had a hard time getting the ingredients until now!

This is a go-to miso soup recipe  Dashi granules make such a difference, it's worth ordering online from Amazon or somewhere if they're not found locally.  Also, use unpasteurized miso paste (it's found in the refrigerated section) -- not that stuff called miso in the asian aisle next to the soy sauces!  Not many stores carry it; Whole Foods does if you're lucky enough to have one close by.  Again, this is so worth ordering online if you can't get it locally - superior taste plus health benefits!  Miso Master and South River Miso are my top picks, and I like yellow or white the best, because they're less salty.

Great recipe!  I make this soup all the time.  My only addition to it would be one sheet of nori (dried seaweed) cut into pieces gives it a great flavor.  You also can add one beaten raw egg to make it an egg drop soup!

I would have given this more stars if it had seaweed in the recipe, and if it had more miso. We added the amount listed but it was bland. Next time we will put in more miso and it should be fine. We did add seaweed- just be sure you soak dried seaweed in water before you add it, or it will suck up all the water from your soup. Thank you for the recipe though, we will try it again.

I just made this and it is not only super easy to make but super yummy.  The only thing was I couldn't find dashi but I did find bonita and I combined it with kombu and I thought it was just as good.  I can't wait to make it again and add other vegetables to it.

Such a flavorful soup!  I use wakame (dried sea grass) for added texture, flavor and color -- but be careful! It adds a bit of saltiness.  You do not want to overboil your miso for risk of losing its flavor, but you want your wakemake to be softened in very hot broth.

The recipe is wrong - no way does it take 20 minutes.  It was much faster.  Tasted much better than restaurents - mine wasn't watered down.  Great recipe and I can see added more things like shrimp, ginger etc. Thanks for the recipe

This tasted EXACTLY like our favorite Sushi restaurant's.  I went to an Asian market and the manager told me to boil the dashi and water then reduce to barely simmering and add the miso then serve.  She said to never boil the miso.  She also said it’s OK to freeze the miso.  It comes in a huge container.  Very inexpensive and yummy soup!

The only change I would make to this would be to make more broth (double to 8 cups) and reduce the tofu (we used 4 oz and it was still a lot for the 4 cups of broth). 

However, the taste was great & it was simple to make. We used a white miso paste for a mild taste. We also added carrot strips also when we added the green onion, and have had this with mushrooms in it as well.

Great recipe for a 1st timer. I found it easier to place the miso paste into a separate cup and place a half a cup of the hot dashi broth into the cup, mush and disolve the paste in the cup, and then pour that into the soup.  Less paste chunks to find that way  :)

This is terrific. Just like in a Japanese restaurant. The only thing I did differently was to make the dashi broth from scratch using a recipe I found on-line. Here it is for those of you who want it: 
1 piece kelp (konbu or kombu), approximately 5 square inches (12  
  centimeters) or 10-12 grams, 
1 cup bonito (katsuobushi) flakes, 
5 cups cold water

Wipe konbu with a damp cloth to clean.
In a stock pot, place konbu and cold water over medium heat. Just before the water begins to boil (do not boil) pull off heat and let stand for 5 minutes. 
Remove konbu, and bring back to heat. Again, right before stock begins to boil, remove from heat and add the bonito flakes.
When flakes sink to the bottom, strain through fine mesh strainer. It can hold in the refrigerator for 2 weeks. 

Thanks for the recipe!

So delicious and easy! The first time I made this, I couldn't find dashi anywhere so I subbed in chicken stock. The soup came out good, but I was finally able to find dashi granules at the Asian market, and it made ALL the difference.

Easy, healthy, delicious and affordable.  Even my 2 year old loves it. What more could I ask for? The store brand dashi granules I buy from the local Japanese market are premeasured in 2 tsp packets and the tofu brand I use, Mori-nu, doesn't need to be refrigerated before opening so I can buy and store it ahead of time- making it even more simple. The perfect soup for a cold day!

Divine. Simple, tasty, so very easy. We found everything we needed at the local Japanese grocery store (but any ethic grocer would have it). As written, it's perfect, so try it first using this recipe to a T. Then, with that base, you can add seaweed, fresh minced ginger, etc.

For both taste and easy preparation, this gets 5 stars!    I like my broth a little stronger, so I added a couple of extra tablespoons of the yellow miso in mine.   Delicious!

I made this with kelp, which when cooked a bit becomes soft, I also added a tbsp each of fresh ginger and garlic, which I minced. Altogether it makes a very nutritious (and hopefully cold fighting) soup.

This was so close to what I wanted it to be! I made a few small changes, and next time I will make a few more. The changes: rather than using granules, I made dashi from scratch using the Konbu Dashi recipe from this site. Next time, I will use firm tofu. That's what I usually buy and I find the silken to have an unpleasant texture. To sum up, use broth from scratch and firm tofu and you will be amazed at how easy and delicious this was. I used white miso.

for variety we also will add spinach right before serving.  or boil kale in the miso b4 adding the tofu.

Great base - I didn't have dashi so I used vegetable bouillon and the ratios were great.

Great miso soup recipe.  My wife loves miso soup and prefers this recipe to most we find at restaurants.  I follow the recipe but I also add some wakame sea vegetable we bought from Amazon.

Really good and authentic tasting!  I used red miso paste for a strong, but salty flavor.  I still prefer the restaurant soup, but maybe I prefer the white or yellow paste?  Still delicious!

We just got back form a vacation in Tokyo and have been craving real Miso Soup. This was the perfect recipe- eay and tasted just like what we got in Japan! I did use firm tofu and added a few strips of seaweed. The dashi is what makes this a traditional soup and can be found in any Japanese market in most big cities.

Great base recipe but you need to find the right ingredients. I ended up getting the dashi on-line thru Amazon (Ajinomoto brand hondashi soup granules). The box will probably last me 3 years! Found white miso in the refrigerated section of Whole Foods. Once you've got those two things, it is so flexible, you can go in many directions with add-ins. One of my favorite things to add is an ounce or so of Japanese soba noodles & let them cook in the simmering miso broth. Like some others have said, the soup is good with a side of sunomono (cucumber salad).

Wow. This miso soup was perfect. Tasted exactly right. I also added some sliced mushrooms. Only thing I will do differently next time is get a slightly harder tofu. This soft tofu was a little too soft. Other than that, it was delicious!

I used white miso. Also added a generous amount of sliced mushrooms and doubled the green onions. I used firm tofu and prefer it diced very small to avoid a 'texture issue' for my husband. Great recipe!

I'm eating it right now . . . YUM!  Tastes just like what I eat in sushi restaurants and from start to finish it was about 5 minutes!!  I used shiro paste (cuz that's what I had on hand) and no tofu (I didn't have any).  I used a tablespoon of the dashi seasoning, which gave it a very strong flavour (which I love, but may sketch others out . . . ).  We added cilantro (because I feel it goes great in everything :P).  SO going to make this again - thanks for a great and very easy recipe!

Look no further! This is the delicious miso soup you get at Japanese restaurants :) If not better! Unfortunately for me I didn't have any green onions on hand (that weren't rotting anyway...) but it was still super delicious. It's all in the broth. Mmmm

WOW!!!  I followed other suggestions and added a bunch of kale and mushrooms by sauteeing with olive oil and garlic first then adding the water and the dashi granules.   This was so filling and delicious.  During my quest to get the ingredients I almost bailed and just got instant Miso while at the Asian Market.  I'm sooo glad I went homemade.  It's a huge difference between instant and homemade.  Yum..Yum..Yum.

I wasn't able to find dashi at any of my local grocery stores so I substituted chicken broth; I used a white miso and I also added thin rice noodles, shrimp, mushrooms, tofu sqares, and green onion. I really enjoyed the lightness of the soup and that it was also filling as a meal. I will make again. I only gave this 4 stars because I feel like the soup base was missing something and I'm pretty sure it was the dashi- so I'll be in search of it online to try again.

This was so good, tastes like the Japanese restaurants to me (with more tofu, but at 99cents a package tofu is good).  I found miso paste at the oriental market and the dashi at Ralphs, though it was labeled as hon dashi.

Perfect!  Just like the miso soup you get at Japanese restaurants - even my picky husband liked it.  I don't know about the dashi granules, but I had bonito broth granules, which I used instead.  I used white miso paste.  This is a keeper!

Perfect!!  It tastes just like it does in the restaurant.  I used silken tofu as recommended by another user.  I also added sea weed since it is always in the restaurant versions here in the NYC area.  I also added shrimp to up the protein and poured it over pho noodles to make it more filling and served it as a main dish.  My miso loving kids ate it all up and asked me to make it again and again.

This is a great recipe.  My mother's miso soup is not this good (don't tell her I said that!) and she has a complicated recipe using bonito to make dashi broth, etc.  This was so easy, and tastes like miso soup from a Japanese restaurant.  The fish stock granules can be found in most Asian markets, sometimes it is referred to as 'Hon Dashi'.

I frequently make Miso soup and found this to be the perfect amount of miso and dashi.  I did add two nori seaweed sheets torn into squares.  Great additions would also be sweet potatoes or straw mushrooms.

This tasted exactly like the miso soups I have eaten in restaurants and it was very simple to prepare.  I will make this again if I can ever get back to the market where I found yellow miso paste and dashi granules.

Loved this soup.  The only thing I did differant was that I made my own dashi base from scratch instead of using the granules.

Great as always! I didn't have dashi and my miso soup paste was a little on the spicy side due to what I picked up at the 99 Ranch market.  I used a tiny bit of honey (we don't have sugar or oyster sauce currently) and soysauce in the process to substitute for a missing sweet and salty taste.

I loved it, but my fiance said it had too much salt (miso paste). I usually have to eat more salt than most people because I have low blood pressure so I trust that it would have been too salty for most. Other than that it had a great flavor.

This was awesome.  So easy and delicious.  I made it exactly the way the recipe called for.  I think it's a great midday snack when you are trying to eat healthy, but with the addition of tofu it is very filling.

A great base recipe, the dashi really helps the flavor. They have vegetarian versions of dashi too! I loaded the soup with fresh mushrooms and a little broccoli too to make it a main dish.

My family loves miso soup.  We're lucky enough to have a great Asian grocery very nearby, so I buy red miso paste - dashi type, to combine the dashi stock and miso in one step.  Also, for us, miso soup isn't complete with seaweed.  Look for dried wakame and add only a pinch or two.

I love miso soup but always wished that they gave larger size tofu pieces in the miso soups I've purchased in restaurants/stores.  Now I can control the size of tofu I like in my miso soup, yay!  Btw, I used firm tofu.  I added spinach to my soup and it was yummy.  Tasted just like the miso soup you get at restaurants.  This really is a versatile recipe and I plan on trying different ingredients next time.  My 3 yr old gobbled this up and left me with just a small bowl to bring to work the next day for lunch, lol!  I will be doubling this recipe in the future!  Thanks for the great recipe :)

This is WONDERFUL!!! If you are having trouble finding miso soup try a heath/natural food store.  That is where I buy mine.

Wow, this taste just like at the restaurant! I've tried to make miso soup without dashi before but I was always disappointed. Now that I found dashi granules in china town, I'm really excited! It's so easy and fast to do the recipe! I can't wait to try different ingredients in it! I did strain the miso in a strainer has suggested by others and the broth is clearer.  I added thinly shredded carrots and use tofu noodles and it was fantastic. Can't wait to try with straw mushrooms! Delicious! My husband who usually does not like miso soup liked it a lot!

I give it three because you really need to make your own dashi. The granules are loaded with MSG. As we all know fresh is better!

Excellent!  Super easy to make.  I used a mellow white miso, soft tofu instead of silken, and added shitake mushrooms.  It doesn't look very exciting in print but has awesome flavor and is better than any miso soup I've had in a restaurant.

This is delicious!  My husband's mother is Japanese and I am always trying to cook him traditional Japanese food.  I actually added cooked somen noodles to this soup like they do at a local Hawaiian restaurant we like to eat at.  Yum yum!

Awesome basic recipe!  My favourite thing to add to this is enoki mushrooms.  Fresh are better, but harder to find so canned works as well.

I have to say 1st hand---I had never eated tofu before this recipe. I was soo worried about eating it, I cubed it into totally small dime size pieces. And it really wasn't bad at all. I also never used dashi granules or miso paste either. This was relatively easy and simple. The flavor was mild and nothing I've ever eaten before. I was very nervous about the miso paste as well because there was a couple of different types with HEAT. So I got the mildest I think the store sold. I'm totally impressed with this and I will make enough for my kids to try as well.I did put some dried kelp in this but it sank to the bottom of the dish and I couldn't get a clear photo of it. I loved kelp and I only put in a few pieces. I think it added to the flavor a little bit. But I'm so going to make this again and try tofu in other ways. Thanks.

Great recipe. Use firm tofu it is easier to cut and will not fall apart as easily in the soup.  I also added kelp which is typically found in other miso recipes.

I prefer using the dried wakame seaweed in mine and some scallions.  You can find the seaweed in an asian supermarket, a normal sized bag lasts a long time, since it's dried and it expands.  (be careful not to use too much)

The soup turned out very tasty, much better than restaurant style. I went to Asian market and one of the employees helped me find all ingredients I needed. I did add little bit of spinach at the end. I will definetly make it again. I will try adding one egg next time for a variety.

Followed the recipe to a T. Real easy to make. However my husband thought it was "too rich" and "fishy".  I have to agree with him. Maybe too much dashi. Plus our house smelled like dashi broth for a while. Miso soup in our favorite sushi restaurant is so light and delicious. I think we'll stick to that. Some things are meant to be eaten outside of your home...

Tasted really good, but for those who are in college and don't have a kitchen, don't try using a griddle. Makes boiling water nearly impossible. I ended up using firm tofu instead of the silken because it was what was available and added a tad bit more miso but it tasted good.

It tastes like the real thing. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because dashi granules, while convenient, are laden with salt.

Very good taste, just like a sushi bar. Tad to much tofu, but that's just a personal preference. The dashi/miso paste combo is just right.

Super simple, fast, and delicious. I've made this many times now, and it never failed. I've made it as described and I've also tried it with baby bok choy and shiitake mushrooms to rave reviews either way. The only thing I do change though, is using extra firm tofu instead of silken tofu (the texture is just too mushy for my taste).

Delicious miso soup recipe. I added some enoki mushrooms in mine and it was yummy. Instead of silken tofu, I used the extra firm kind and it turned out fine. You can also probably add other veggies and ingredients to make this an entree, eg. Japanese ramen and seaweed. This recipe is perfect for detoxing in the New Year and a cold wintry evening!

Just like you'd get in a Japanese restaurant!  I had to go to the Asian market to get the dashi granules (important, don't omit!) and miso paste.  I used Marikome brand All Natural Miso. This miso is known as Awase which is between a white and a red paste on the miso scale.  The only change I made was to use a firm tofu, as recommended by other reviewers. I think using firm is necessary. I thinly slice a sheet of seaweed and added that into the pot just before serving. I also added a couple thinly sliced mushrooms as a garnish. Thanks for the great recipe! So simple! Who knew!?

Okay, as is, the recipe is fine and tasted just like the soup served in our favorite Japanese restaurants. However, I'm really disappointed, because the first two ingredients in Hondashi granules are salt and MSG! I hate to think I've been eating MSG every time I have miso soup at my favorite restaurant, but it would appear that is the case. I didn't see any other brand at my local Lion market, so what else could they be using? Hopefully it's Bonito dried fish flakes to make their own. We tried that the first time and used tons of flakes, and it turned out to be way too fishy. I am definitely making this soup again, but without the Hondashi granules. I will cut back on the dried fish flakes to make my dashi and see if that makes the soup less fishy. Otherwise, I won't be eating it anymore at all, at home or at the restaurants.

Also I agree with the reviewer who said their silken tofu was too soft. Use a fairly firm tofu.

I make Miso soup regularly and this recipe is just fine ... but only 4* as ...  never cook the soup once you've added the miso paste.  You should let the soup cool a bit and then add it to retain the health benefits and flavor.

I really liked this, but I couldn't find the granules anywhere, so I had to do without. So, my soup was very basic and a bit blank (my fault). I will try this again, and see if I can find those granules.

Perfect combination of ingredients! This created the best miso soup we've ever had, anywhere! We used one sheet of sushi nori seaweed rather than the green onions, but look forward to trying the green onions next time. Yum!!

This tastes just like the miso soup you would get at your local sushi place. It's so easy yet so flavorful. By the way I think dashi is actually the brand name similar to HonDashi not the actual ingredient because I went to a chinese/Japanese supermarket and the worker did not know what I was talking about I told him it was a fish stock which can be a water base like or sold as dried granules and he really couldn't help, but after looking in the spice aisle I found HonDashi which is (dashi) according to the recipe and a package just like Hondashi but a different name brand also the same thing. I used the yellow miso paste and it came out just like I wanted, restaurant quality.

Delicious! I couldn't find dashi granules but the miso paste I bought (right next to the tofu) had dashi stock in it.  So I just boiled the water, added the 3T of miso paste and went from there.  It's simple but fabulous!  Thanks.

Absolutely delicious. I made it almost exactly from the recipe, but I doubled the quantity and added shitake mushrooms. We couldn't get enough of it. I made some onigiri to eat with it, to add a little bulk, and had a nice, light-but-satisfying meal. I will be making this alot (especially considering that the only package of dashi I could find was HUGE) Thank you so much for sharing the recipe.

My young daughter LOVES miso soup, but it looked mysterious and hard to make. I am so happy I found this recipe - it was easy to make and just as delicious as at the restaurant. We both give it a big THUMBS UP for a warm winter meal. Bonus that its super easy and quick.

Simple recipe, not for everyone's taste.  We call it the "stinky soup", but the flavor is not stinky at all! I add dried shiitake mushrooms, and fried tofu that has been marinated in tamari sauce.

Great recipe!  Miso paste can be found at Whole Foods, but the dashi was difficut for me to come by.  I ended up ordering some off of the internet. I also used firm tofu because I read in other comments that it was recommended.  I don't think a whole package was needed, it seemed like too much tofu.  I added bok choy and sliced mushrooms. Yum!

While the ingredients were a little difficult to find, this miso soup recipe was absolutely delicious! As though I had bought it in a store ready made. It was wonderful!

I love miso soup!  I didn't have any dashi so added more miso paste instead...still turned out tasty.  I also added noodles to be filling.

This is as close to restaurant quality as it gets, I added 1/2 cup of chopped spinach and it tasted wonderful!! The miso paste was hard to find until I found in it the refrigerated section of the asian grocery. silly me.

Okay, I couldn't find the dashi, or the miso paste at my local grocery store, but I did find a miso soup sauce. So I followed the directions on the bottle for the water to sauce ratio, and then your directions for the amount of green onions and tofu. 

It was absolutely wonderful, and I finally had something I could serve to two of my friends that are vegan.

Amazing! Just as good as the best miso soup I've had at restaurants. I had some kale on hand, so I chopped it real fine and tossed it in the soup. It was delicious and my 3 and 5-year olds couldn't stop eating it.

After hearing that this was salty I decreased the dashi to 1 1/2 t. It was still really salty from the miso paste, which I'll decrease next time and keep the dashi the same, so I added about 1 c more water. It made a light tasty broth, however, and I'm sure I'll make this again.

Fantastic!  Took a while to get the miso paste - had to go to an Asian market and get help from a worker (the miso bag was all in Japanese which is why I had trouble finding it!).  Added a couple sheets of dried seaweed in short strips to make it resemble the soup I had in restaurantss.  I also used firm tofu rather than silky.  Really good!

After making miso "just-add-water" packs over the years, I now know that there is a better (& just as easy way) to make miso.

I found dashi granules at a local upscale grocery store and substituted the miso paste for soy bean paste.

Delicious!

I bought a small container of miso paste with dashi already in it. Very convenient and delicious. You can make it a meal by adding soba noodles and other veggies, like shiitake, Napa cabbage, carrot, nori, red bell pepper, and an egg. It's great to have around now to make when we order sushi. Takes only moments to make, easy and affordable.

All the tips for firm tofu were good advice.

Great base. Simple soup and this gives you the portions to tweak to your particular taste. Try boiling dried sardines to make your broth, or adding mushrooms and dried seaweed. I add the miso paste at the end--apparently you destroy some of the "healthy" components of the miso paste if you cook it.

This is an excellent recipe. When made exactly as written (using the mild yellow or white miso paste), it tastes just like the miso soup you get in Japanese restaurants. I consider this to be a base recipe. You can make it more interesting by putting other things in it. In mine, I put seaweed (not nori, but the chopped, shriveled up kind that expands to small, thin, square pieces in the soup -- I can't give you the exact name because the entire package is in Japanese) and udon noodles. In addition to tasking great, it is also very quick and easy to prepare.

This is the perfect basic recipe. As others have mentioned, adding spinach and mushrooms adds a delicious touch.

Oddly, I could not find dashi granules at my local asian market, but the very nice clerk gave me the ingredients (which they had) and very easy instructions to make my own stock which is much lower in sodium and additives: Dried kombu (kelp) and bonito flakes.

Soak +/- 1/2 cup of dried kombu in 4 cups cold water for 20 minutes. Bring to a boil, add +/- 1/2 cup of the dried bonito flakes. Simmer 5 minutes. Strain the broth.  Voilà!

Very authentic recipe, easy, quick and delicious!  Every other Miso soup recipe calls for a tablespoon of wakame, which is dried seaweed.  I bought a bag of it dehydrated and soaked a tbsp of it in warm water for a few minutes before adding it into the dashi.

It was hard to find Dashi, but worth it.  I doubled the amount of Miso and reduced the tofu to 6 oz.  We just like it stronger.  Next time, I'll try adding seaweed also.  Thanks for the recipe!

The first time I made this recipe with white miso from the asian market, I couldn't make it edible. However, I really wanted to like this, so I tried again with organic brown rice miso that I found at Hy-Vee. It came out wonderful!! I will be making this over and over again. I drained the tofu slices on paper towels (between two cookie sheets with weight on top) before dicing them, and added 1 tsp lite soy sauce to the soup. I cut the recipe to two servings and it was a perfect little snack for my husband and I. Thank you for the delicious recipe!

This was very good and so easy. I couldn't find dashi, so I used 1 tsp kelp granules and 1 tsp fish sauce. I also added wakame (a leafy seaweed), and after tasting it, I added a half-tablespoon more miso.

This soup is just like what you get in the restaurant!  Next time, I'll add some seaweed and a little less tofu.  This a cinch to make.  I can also credit the writer of this recipe with being the reason I shop in the Asian food market - it's a gold mine!  The produce is amazing and the prices are great!  This recipe changed my life!  Thank you!

This was great. I went to a asian food store and got my miso with dashi granules already added. Tossed in some ginger, beaten egg. It was great. Thanks. It went perfect with dinner.

Wonderful recipe! I made this for a Japanese themed dinner and everyone loved it. The only thing I can think of to change is the amount of tofu. I doubled the batch and found that it was a bit more than I expected. Thanks so much for sharing, I've wanted to learn how to make this for a long while!

Wow-This was an exact match to Miso Soup served in the restaurants around town. Don't change a thing because this is absolutely perfect and so simple & inexpensive to make. A winner all around.

Yum! My husband and I first had miso soup a few weeks ago at a new Japanese restaurant, and we decided to see about making some. This was very easy, although the ingredients took a little bit of work to find (and miso is expensive!) My husband loved this soup - he called it chicken noodle soup for grown-ups. Excellent stuff!

This soup was pretty good. Not like restaurant miso soup, though. Next time I won't use so much dashi & see how that turns out. I'll add sliced mushrooms to it too.

Just like in the restaurant.  I used 1 tsp of the dashi granules to cut back on the saltiness when I first made it and it was just right.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

Fantastic!  I served this for a dinner party and was told it was the best Miso that my friends have had.  I doubled the recipe but used 12 oz. of tofu and that was perfect.  I also added some turn spinach leaves and loved the effect.  I liked it so much, I may make it again tonight!  Thanks!

This is great and really does taste like the miso in Japanese restaurants.  The only thing I would do differently is to put in less tofu--there is far too much for my taste.

Very, very good recipe. So simple to make, you'll find yourself making this often---once you find all the ingredients. I went to an Asian supermarket and had a hard time finding the dashi; be sure to ask for help. I like to add Japanese somen noodles so it is more of a hearty meal. I eat this for breakfast and lunch several times a week. If you are a follower of the Okinawan Diet, this recipe is for you!

I did not make this soup but being from Hawaii, Miso was a staple in our house.  My mom made us soup when we were sick!  Tofu should go in after the soup is made, right before you serve it.  Fresher tasting, tofu has a tendency to harden when it is cooked!

I would give this more stars if possible. I have tried many Miso recipes over the last fifty years. This is by far the best I've ever made, and the only one I've made more than once. The ratio of Miso, fashion and water is perfect. The taste is awesome!

So I found myself in the local grocery store looking for ingredients (though I knew better). But after going to my local international mart, I was right on track.  By the time I added the red miso,  I didn't even want it to simmer or cool.  The flavors were outstanding.  I even packed some up to a friend who specializes in Japanese cooking and she was amazed that I pulled off something similar to her grandmother's recipe so closely. One big note is that I used a mini strainer to work out the miso.  Found one with notches on the side when I went to the international market.

This recipe was great, tasted just like the miso soup you get in any good Japanese restaurant. I couldn't find dashi at my Asian grocer so I substituted a cube of fish stock and a sheet out dried seaweed used to make sushi rolls broken into smaller pieces.

The only miso soup I've ever had is the instant kind that you just add water to.  I stopped buying it when I read the ingredients more carefully because I'm a vegetarian and found that there's bonito in it.  I craved miso soup suddenly today, so found this recipe and tweaked it to make it vegetarian.  Instead of dashi, I put a little vegetarian shitake mushroom oyster-flavor sauce and kelp granules. And I added shitake mushrooms (the dehydrated ones that are soaked in water first).  I happened to have leftover fried tofu, so I cut them into cubes to put in this broth.  I'm very pleased with how it came out and will be making it again.  Not only is it vegetarian, but way better-tasting then the instant miso I accidentally ate.
***New Note*** I got another idea today as I got a sore throat and made this soup (might be coming down with a flu).  I added a scoop of Vitamin C powder in the end (with 1/2 this recipe).  I feel way better now. I'm sure I feel better because of the soup itself, and not the Vitamin C, but that will make it even more healthy, give it a little zesty flavor, and help fight off a cold you might have (the powder is more potent in Vitamin C then lemons).

Common way of making Miso using granules. A couple of notes from my own experience...I use 1T miso for every cup of dashi (i.e. the broth). This makes it easier for me to remember the ratio. When using silken tofu, look for the Extra Firm Silken Tofu. You want that restaurant quality creamy tofu experience but you also want the block to hold up. Extra Firm Silken does this. Finally, I add a bit of rehydrated wakame (seaweed) as well. A little wakame goes a long way as it expands greatly. Rehydrate with boiling water in a separate vessel, drain, and add to the end soup.

After adding the Dashi, I tasted the Miso paste before adding. It was low sodium, but still a bit salty. I only used 2 Tbs. Miso and it was enough. I added about a 1/2 cup of tofu and a 1/2 cup seaweed cut in about 1/2 in pieces along with the onion. This was delicious and light. Make sure you soak and rinse the seaweed if you use it. Made it again with thinly sliced celery and bamboo shoots, in addition to the green onion. I cut all of my ingredients thinly to keep the soup light and brothy. So simple, but made me look like I might actually know what I'm doing! lol  Thanks Michelle Chen.

Delicious and so easy to make.  I took some tips from others and added shiitake mushrooms and spinach.  Better than any I have had in restaurants.

We thought it was wonderful.  My son said it is just like the restaurant, but you get more tofu.  Very nice.

This was great!  We added 2 tsp. of dried wakame (because I like it in miso soup).  I might halve the tofu next time, but it got really great compliments from our guests as it was, so maybe I'll leave it the same.

I loved this soup! For all those that are worried about salt and msg in your hondashi and miso paste - there are low sodium miso paste available through Amazon. I use a brand called Honzukuri that is pretty good. As for the Hondashi, I go to a sight called Redi-base and order a jar of their seafood stock. It still has a salt but no MSG and is a good substitute.

I think when I added the Miso Paste I added too much because my husband said it turned out really strong, so I ended up adding a fifth cup of water to it and he absolutely loved this recipe. He's been deployed to Korea and says it's just like from there. We only used Firm Tofu (Silken) and green onions. The dashi took me a while to find at my local Asian Market because it was called Hondashi (Bonito Soup Stock). Just in case anyone else runs across the same problem. :)

I followed the recipe exactly and loved how it turned out! One small tip - make sure you don't boil the miso, as it will kill the aroma.

I was basically taught this same recipe by my Japanese roommate about 20 years ago but another thing she added was a beated egg. Beat an egg and then pour it in boiling soup gradually while stirring soup with a fork. That is what makes the soup in the restaurants look cloudy white when stirred.

Pretty close! For an added dash of authentic Japanese restaurant flavor, add a pinch of wakame (sea vegetable) to the initial boiling of the broth. It will take just a few minutes to re-hydrate. A Japanese grandmother taught me never to boil miso, as it destroys the beneficial enzymes. Temper the miso in a cup with a little broth before adding it to the hot soup.

I am a soup lover, and this is the BEST miso soup I have ever tasted outside Japan.

Authentic taste and consistancy.

I followed the recipe exactly, but added some seaweed for a little extra taste.

FANTASTIC!!!

I'm trying to work tofu in my diet. I pulled up this recipe and made a couple of modifications, like I used store bought fried tofu and cut it into 1/4' cubes.  Since my tastebuds are still getting used to the texture of tofu  I decreased the portion to 6 ounces.  I also sliced up 1/2 cup of oyster mushrooms, 1/2 cup asian sweet peas, and 1 cup of baby bok choy.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I just need to cut back on the Daishi due to the salt content and find the right kind without MSG..But this recipe is a 5+++

This recipe is really easy and simple to make. I added some fresh seaweed and Boc Choy and of course the green onion. It was hard to find the Dashi and the miso paste but after a few visits to some orenital grocery stores I found some!! 
My father is ill, and loves this soup and it's extreamly healing it's the Japanize version of Chicken soup...LOL!!!

This was wonderful.  Even my husband loves it, and he always turns up his nose when I mention tofu.  I chop up green onions, 
quick freeze them and store in freezer, so I just used about 1/2 cup of these in the soup.  Very savory and comforting.

This is the best miso soup I've had in a long time.  The best part is, it's easy to make.  I couldn't find dashi granuales, so I used miso paste with dashi mixed in with it.  Wonderful recipe.

This was identical to what we get at japanese restaurants. We added seaweed, which is the green you normally find in the soup. You can get dried seaweed at asian grocery stores and just tear it up and drop it in.

This is a great recipe. It finally gave me the courage to try miso soup at home. Its too easy, I'm kicking myself for not trying this earlier and this is now a keeper! I used yellow miso paste, fried bean curd pieces cut in half and added some spring onions (not sure if these are the same as green onions - probably).

Super easy, and very good. I did not have dashi, so I used a little veggie broth. The flavor was much milder than restaurant miso soup. I personally liked it better.

I added another spoon of Dashi, another 2 cups of water, a tablespoon of Sriracha, and a teaspoon of white pepper. This gave it a nice soft kick that wasn't too overpowering and not too hot on the tongue. Just the right amount of heat. 
We also added ramen noodles which made it the perfect amount of yummy and filling for us.

I will definitely make this again.  My 2 year old loved it!
I doubled using 32oz vegetable broth and 32 oz water, white miso 8 Tbs, almost 1/2 c seaweed that was already cut and dried into small pieces (found at the grocery store in a bag), 1 large mushroom, 1 block of firm tofu, and only 2 Tbsp Dashi (bc I was scared it's would be strong and it was perfect).
I think it tasted as good as the restaurantmiso soup, but a million times hardier.  I started an allrecipes account, just so I wouldn't lose this recipe. :)

Needs 6 tbsp of miso paste and 3 tsp of dashi. If you're adding seaweed add it in at the last minute or so so it doesnt get mushy. You add about 3 tbsp of warm water to the miso paste before hand and whisk it up before putting it into the pot. It'll mix in the pot a lot easier.

We had just made a batch of light chicken broth and used two cups of broth and two cups of water instead of four cups of water. We used red miso paste and added some dry seaweed. The depth of flavor was phenomenal! We will definitely be making it again!

Tastes just like the soup you would eat at a Japanese restaurant! I had problems finding dashi granules at my local super market, but ended up finding them on amazon and they worked perfectly.

Based on ingredients on hand and others' reviews, I used 3.5 T white miso paste, fish (salmon) stock in place of water, 1.5 carrots (shredded), firm tofu, and added chopped mustard greens before serving.  My husband loved it and children ate it without complaint.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great tasting soup and very easy to make. one problem I had with it was that it separated and I had to mix it in my bowl. I made it few times and it did it every time. I also added seaweed and it was just delicious.

Went to the Asian market and asked what to get for this recipe. It turned out just like a restaurant. I used shiro miso and hondashi bonito granules I don’t know if that is a brand or a flavor, all the packaging is not in English. The kids went for it and all had multiple bowls. It seemed like too much tofu to me and I’ll use half the amount next time.

Heard people on NPR talking about Miso soup. Decided to make it. I’ve never tasted Miso soup at a restaurant to compare mine with theirs but I liked it and will make again. It was a great lunch paired with a salad. The challenge was finding what I needed in the Asian market without help or suggestions. I used firm tofu, Kabuto AKA red Miso and HonDashi granules.
Update- I made it again with low sodium chicken broth and love it more!

I have made this often.  Use MSG free dashi if you want but I like the traditional.  I use regular tofu and some veg.  Bonito flakes are delicious.  It is so easy to toss in some kombu (kelp).  Just cut it or break it up into bite sizes. Nori is seaweed typically used in sushi and sashimi or crushed and sprinkled into soup.  BTW, common niboshi dashi is a fish (sardines) stock that contains kombu.  There is also shiitaki and simple kombu dashi.
Then there is instant dashi, also delicious.

This soup is great and so easy to make.  My only disappointment is that the dashi I found at the Asian grocery store lists msg in the ingredients.  I wonder if all dashi contains msg.

Amazing. Added probably around 5-7 tbsp yellow miso paste and needed quite a bit of salt to taste. Added ground pepper. Will probably make again :)

Yummy.  Although mine tasted kind of smokey.  I’m not familiar with these ingredients so I? don’t know if it was the miso or the dashi, but it was good.  It was easy to make.  I? added shrimp and noodles.  Yum.

Used “better than  chicken” paste for the broth., doubled the green onions, , used firm tofu and added a can of drained mushrooms.  Got the miso paste and dashi crystals from Walmart.  Great  and easy soup.

Easy and so so comforting! The hardest part for me was finding the fashion granules - not at Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods (although WF has the stuff you can make your own with). I ended up finding this at an Asian market (which is probably where I should have started!) after that, easy peasy!

Very good. I added 1 tsp grated ginger and 1 grated carrot, but otherwise followed recipe. Thanks to Amazon for the dashi granules and miso paste - nowhere to be found in a small town.

It was great! I would go for a very firm tofu next time because I wanted more texture from the tofu. The hot soup made it soften and sometimes I would slurp it down without even knowing it. Also, the dashi was a nice touch.

Came out great. I doubled the water and miso paste as the tofu and seaweed was so much. It ended up perfect soup to tofu ratio once I doubled water. I would maybe add an extra scoop of miso paste next time though.

Wonderful recipe that I've been looking for! I ordered my Dashi (Hon Dashi) and Miso paste (organic white) on Amazon in Prime pantry, it came in quick and I made the BEST miso even I've ever had.

Perfect!! It's simple to make, full of flavor, and just like our favorite sushi restaurants serve. I ordered the dashi granuals online and used organic red miso paste, being careful not to boil it. I'd like to add seaweed in the future but I'll keep this recipe forever! Thanks for sharing it.

Turned out just right!  I made it in the microwave, though.  I made a half recipe.  Put the water and the dashi in a bowl. Microwave on high for 2 min.  Add miso; microwave on 50% for 2 min.  Add tofu and onion and microwave for 2 more min.

I made a few alterations and additions, but my husband loves it! I took the advice of another reviewer and added 1 extra tablespoon of miso . I also added diced shallots, mushrooms and added seaweed because what is miso soup without seaweed?! If you want it to taste a little less fishy I suggest adding only 1 teaspoon of the dashi. Great recipe tho!

Since I live by myself, sometimes I don't like to cook the portion sizes in a regular recipe because it's too much. However, with miso soup, (and I have made pho as well this way) I make them larger portions and freeze it when I can. I love noodles in My Soup so I did put some rice noodles in this... Quick and easy. The only other thing I added was large slices of ginger because I love the flavor of it, but I fished it out of the broth before I eat it... I want to just a hint of the ginger flavor. I also used the firmer tofu from reading the reviews here. I have only made it the one time, but absolutely love it and definitely will make it again and possibly tweak it in some other way. At any rate, you will hear about it in these reviews. LOL. Enjoy!

My daughter and I love Japanese food.  Trying to avoid eating out all of the time, I am trying to cook more at home.  I decided to try this recipe, and it turned out great!  My daughter said it tastes just like the Miso soup from her favorite restaurant.  I used white miso and added some nori.  I will definitely be making it again.

I ended up forgoing the dashi, because I wasn't able to find it at a local supermarket. I also substituted the lemon juice with rice vinegar. 

Otherwise, the recipe was fine. The green onions cute in diagonals added a special touch to the soup.

I also served a bowl of miso soup with no green onions. That was fine as well.

Very easy. I doubled the recipe's water and tofu but only used 4 tbsp of miso and that was plenty for me. I was stupefied by the different kinds of miso and settled on an organic aka miso and it has great flavour.  My kids love this soup and now I have enough to pack for their lunch tomorrow! And also added some roasted seaweed we had lying around.

This was an excellent and easy recipe for a novice miso soup maker.  I tweaked it right out of the chute, because I had been scoping similar recipes.  I put a little more miso in it (used white) and added a shredded carrot and some diced mushrooms.  It is EXCELLENT.  "Expert" Japanese chef suggested removing the soup from the heat before adding the miso.  It's supposed to maintain the flavor better and keep it from separating.  All I know is that I made a little batch of heaven today!

Like other reviews have stated, I prefer a firm tofu in mine. I like to add a few slices of dried shitake to mine as well and have it for breakfast with some steamed rice that has an over easy egg mixed into it.

Delicious! I made my first attempt exactly as written and it turned out even better than at my local restaurant. For Americans without an Asian market near by. My local Wegmans had everything I needed for about 6-7 bucks. and I'll be able to make a TON more with what I bought. Future versions I'll probably use a hair more miso paste because I like it salty.

My son and daughter were so excited that I could make restaurant style miso soup for them.  We added fresh mushrooms to go with the tofu and green onions. So glad to add this to our family recipe book.

Made the recipe as is using the red miso paste and the silken tofu. Perfect base, tastes exactly like the restaurants. The silken tofu had a slimy texture, next time I'll do firm. Don't skip the green onion, delish :)

Made it according to recipe.  Tasted great!  However, next time I'll try firm tofu.  The silk tofu broke up into a million pieces while I was trying to drain it.  So I ended up with too much tofu and it was not diced up properly but more mushed.

I used a readymade Miso soup packet to make it, to save time cooking. The soup was  good, but next time if I use a readymade Miso soup packet I will add more tofu with the green onions.   To make the soup better the next time.

This was really good but I did make some changes.  Before adding extra firm tofu, I sauteed it in some sesame oil until light golden.  Also added seaweed.  came out so delicious-just like a restaurants.  I would def. make this again.

Loved it! Couldn't find the silk tofu at the Asian market so I just bought medium tofu and it worked fine. Next time I'm looking for natural dashi and not the msg stuff. This was excellent and tasted like the soup you would get at a high dollar sushi restraunt

Very delicious soup. Me and my friends love it so much! One of my friends went as far as to buy an air freshener for his car that smells like miso soup:)

I love this soup. It's simple and quick to make. I added enoki mushrooms to the soup, just because I love enoki.  This soup tastes delicious, and it's a good recipe for beginner cooks (like me).

This is my first try at Miso soup.  I changed the tofu to firm as many reviewers suggested, and otherwise followed the recipe perfectly.  I used organic low sodium miso paste.  People were saying it was too bland or needed more miso but that was not what I found.  To me, it was actually a tad bit too much miso and will add less or more water next time.  (Also, I got a multi-cooker for xmas this year so I made it in there which made it even faster and easier!  Thanks!

Update - Sorry.  I had never used dashi and miso before and had the flavors mixed up.  It was too much dashi and not enough miso.  I made it a second time using 1 heaping teaspoon of dashi granules and an extra heaping tablespoon of miso.  That was pretty darn close and  delicious.  :)

Simply great soup! Just like the stuff you find at your favorite sushi restaurants. I ordered organic white miso and MSG-free dashi granules from Amazon. I opted for organic firm tofu as that holds up better. For the much needed salt, I added soy sauce to my bowl.

Its very good.  I made one change & that was to stir in the miso last, then removed from heat. The Japanese do not boil or simmer the miso.

Absolutely delicious.  I added dried seaweed instead of scallions and used firm tofu and it was just like what I'd expect from a Japanese restaurant.

I really liked this recipe.  It gave the basics and I just needed to tweek it a bit.  I wanted more soup so I made 5 C of water, 3 teas. dash, and 4 tbsp of miso.  I also added dried kelp which added more flavor and a healthy ingredient.

Just made this today for lunch, very good.  Added some thin sliced shiitake mushrooms (they were dried, just simmered them up a bit on the stove with just enough water to cover them).  Also added some seasoned dried seaweed, ripped into 2" pieces. Didn't have any dashi, so I added some Katsuo Fumi Furikake (rice seasoning) to the mix, as it has shaved bonito in it.  That last ingredient made it perfect!  Very yummy, this will eaten at least once a week in an effort to eat a little better in 2014.  Yeah, I know about the salt.  ;)

Nothing not to love about this recipe - the proportions are great and it's basic, so you can expand it in whatever way you wish.  Add some protein in the form of chicken or shrimp, add more veggies, etc.  Like more miso?  Start with the prescribed amount here and go up if you like.  A great starting point for anything miso.

This soup is available at a few different restaurants in our area but only one makes it really well and it is rather expensive. This recipe is amazing!!!! I now make it myself all the time. As with other comments below I also used FIRM tofu to avoid it feeling mushy. 
Thank you for submitting!!

Made it for my husband when he's sick due to food poisoning.  I added Udon noodle into it to make it a meal instead of just a light soup.  It's great & easy.

This is an amazing recipe! Tastes better than all of the local Asian restaurants, in my opinion.  I doubled the recipe and added extra firm Tofu, sliced Portabella Mushrooms, Roasted Seaweed, and Green Onions (added in that exact order with aprox 5 minutes between each addition)... I also added a little extra miso paste (white) for extra flavor.  I was very pleased, as was my significant other...  Very delicious, I highly recommend you give this a shot if you like Miso Soup!

I made this soup for myself and it was delicious! Just as good if not better than any miso soup you can get at a restaurant. I added cut up portobello mushrooms for a little more to chew on, and it was good that way too.

i boiled dried seaweed (for wrapping sushi rolls) and dried shredded squid (in lieu of the bonito) instead of using dashi granules, which i equated in my mind to powder bouillon which is pure salt and artificial ingredients. i also took the cue from other reviewers that recommended firm tofu instead of silken. this soup was great! just like the sushi restaurants here in okinawa :)

You can use yellow, white, or red miso paste for the soup, depending on your preference. You will also need dashi, which is made of dried kelp

The recipe is fairly basic, however, the amount of tofu called for is too much. I've had to double the recipe to make the amount less overwhelming. As well, I'd recommend more green onion, and the addition of seaweed! That's what really makes miso soup!

I just made this for the first time. I followed everything except I added one dried shiitake mushroom to the broth for extra colour. It didn't smell very good to me, nor did it smell authentic (although I don't stick my nose in the pot at my fav sushi restaurant). It smelled very fishy, I guess because I used tuna dashi.  I tasted it reluctantly, but I was pleasantly surprised. It tasted very good and very authentic. I found it slightly saltier then when I get it in a restaurant; next time ill reduce the miso by 1/2 tbsp.  I like it with extra green onion, and I think I'll add some cooked soba noodles for my kids.

Great recipe! I had to substitute the Dashi with two cubes of chicken bouillon. The family loved it! Next time, I will try it with the Dashi.

This recipe is divine.  My family loves miso soup and this recipe tastes identical to the one our local japanese restaurant serves.  The only modification I made was i used only half the tofu and instead of green onions i added some nori.  Delicious!! Highly recommend this recipe!

This was fantastic.  I followed the recipe to T and my husband kept saying how it was exactly like we get in the restaurants.  Next time I'll try making Smoked Salmon Sushi Rolls with this.

I couldn't find dashi granuals so I bought a liquid soup base.  For the soup, I added a bit of chicken soup base also.  Very good.

This recipe is great!  I added seaweed for an authentic miso soup.
