I cooked the onions in the bacon grease and patted them dry. Seems like a crime to waste good pig.

My husband and I both liked this salad but felt it needed something - maybe dried cranberries or candied walnuts?

Update: added 1 cup candied walnuts (Ellie Krieger's easy Maple Glazed Walnuts from Food Network site) and it was so good!!!

I made this but there were a few changes. I didn't have bacon and I used broccoli slaw I had. I also added walnuts when I was ready to eat it and this is a keeper. I can see being able to add what I want to it, making it different.

I used some grated beet for the red color when I discovered that I didn't have any red onion.  Several pecans subbed for bacon because of being a vegetarian.  This is more like a tossed  salad than a slaw, which I think of as a cabbage salad with mayonnaise.  By any name, this is a tasty salad!

My family all enjoyed this which is a big win. I love the fact that it uses in-season ingredients and basic kitchen staples.It was easy to prepare....what else do you need?

As is only a 3, but with extra bacon, cranberries & DO NOT BOIL OR FRY ONIONS leave thinly sliced this would be 4 or more.  I could not believe anyone would ever boil onions that go in a cold salad. Will be making again with 4 or more slices of bacon.

I loosely followed this recipe using most of the same ingredients and it came out very good! I will definitely make it again because it's a good way to add more kale to my diet.

I used chopped kale mixed with shredded cabbage and carrots. I added the lemon juice, salt, pepper and crunched up the kale/cabbage/carrots with my hands to soften them. I also added about 1/4 of a raw red onion thinly sliced.

I mixed the mayo with 1 pack of Truvia for a bit of sweetness and 2 tbsp red wine vinegar and mixed it all together with a splash of olive oil. Yum! It's so tangy and crunchy and good.

This is the first time I've used raw kale in a dish and I loved it!  Used three slices of bacon, threw in some sliced almonds and a little swiss cheese.  Otherwise, followed as written.  I did sprinkle a few croutons on top of hubby's salad.  He loved it too!  Sooo good!  Thank you, meggerz802!  Oh, I also cheated and threw my sliced red onion in a bowl with a small amount of water and microwaved it for a minute and the drained.  So much easier than boiling!

This was delicious! Even my kids liked it. They thought it was a bit heavy on the onion, so next time I will go easier on that ingredient. But in general, we enjoyed it and it's a good way to get everyone in my family to eat kale. I added some diced honey roasted almonds to give it a bit more crunch.

I bought Kale for my morning smoothie since its said to be good fore you.  After I tasted my green shake and realized I couldn't choke it down, I decided to find a different way to incorporate it into my diet.  I'm glad I found this site, it was very good!  I like my slaw more .. sloppy, so I doubled the juices and mayo.  It was a great way to eat Kale and I'll actually buy it again one day!

Very tasty! I used bacon crumbles and added a bit more mayo. Will definitely make this salad again.

I would make this salad again but would not use this dressing. I will use my regular homemade coleslaw dressing and I did add dried cranberries and pecans.

I grated in some beet that I had on hand and added sliced almonds and dried cranberries.  I also used a little onion powder in place of the onions.  I will definitely be making this again.

I am a vegetarian, so I substituted toasted slivered almonds for bacon. Otherwise, I made it exactly as written, and it was very good.

This was a terrific salad. I left out the bacon substituted white onion for red. I would definitely cook the onion as suggested. I added dried cranberries & almond slices. I will definitely make it again.

This was an interesting dish - I had mixed reviews from the family.  I guess I would not make again.

Excellent and healthy! I did not precook the red onion as I love raw red onion and I used 2 pieces of bacon. Kneading the kale as Meggerz suggests is a great tip - softens the kale so that it doesn't taste so raw and stiff. Thanks Meggerz.
