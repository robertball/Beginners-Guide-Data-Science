Made as directed with minor alterations....used roasted Hatch green chile I had in my freezer from  the season this year,frozen corn and homemade chicken broth. I also used the optional seeded jalapeno and this was spicy! After initial tasting I went back and added 8oz of cream cheese to attempt to cool things down a bit and give the chili the creamy factor I was looking for. It helped some and this will be something I make again.

Made this yesterday and it came out amazing! Only thing I did different was add a little white vinegar for taste. Thanks for the recipe definitely will be making this again :)

I'll be making this again but I did modify a little bit. I used a combo of breast and boneless skinless thighs, boiled them in the chicken stock with a few garlic cloves, sazon seasoning, adobo, chili powder and a little salt.  I boiled it so I could shred the chicken. Pulled the chicken out, strained the broth then followed the rest of the recipe. It was A+. Made cheddar jalapeño cornbread to go with it. Boom.

This was an awesome twist !!! I however used navy beans (using what I had on hand).   I simmered the beans in a crockpot till ready and added the rest, I also used fresh green chili peppers not only for a fresher taste but added color of a darker green rather than can, it was amazing,  I made this dish for a family gathering and received great compliments.   Another hit with hubby!!  
I also served this with mini corn muffins I made.

Excellent mixture of spices which gives it a unique flavor.  The best Chicken chili recipe I have found!  I'm allergic to red meat and eat a lot of chicken, so trust me... this is the best!

This was the first time I made White Chili and it was AWESOME!! I recommened using more Great Northern Beans and maybe small pieces of chicken.  I used (4) large chicken breasts and it was a little too much chicken for me.  I also omitted the corn.  It was great!!  The cumin adds that special flavor.  My husband said it was awesome. He went back for seconds!!!

I was in the grocery store on my phone looking for a chicken chili recipe and this one caught my eye. Simple enough to make quickly tonight and enough left over to serve to a group of friends coming over again tomorrow. I tripled the recipe I think.  Added a bunch of chopped rainbow chard  that needed to be used, and omited the jalepeno. A large can of roasted green chilis was enough flavor for my family. Thank you for a great guideline to follow! Delicious recipe!!

I followed the instructions exactly, but it tasted kind of bland and wasn't very spicy. Some people may enjoy, but it isn't for me.

This is the best chicken chili recipe I've ever used!  I did make a number of alterations though.  First, I boiled 2 chicken breasts & then removed the meat & cut it up into pieces.  (This is what I do when making chicken soup or chicken pot pie, as the chicken just seems to be more tender).  Then, I used the broth from the chicken to add to the chili along w/2 boullion cubes for additional flavor.  Also, added a teaspoon of ancho chili powder as well as 1 teaspoon of salt.  Added 2 jalapeño peppers & 3 cans of Great Northern Beans, since I didn't have any garbanzo beans. Increased canned chilis to 2 cans,  & added 1/2 block of Philly light cheese to the chili toward the end of cooking for creaminess & flavor.  Omitted the cornstarch & water altogether.  Will definitely make this again, as other recipes I've tried in the past were too bland.

I made this recipe, deviating somewhat.  I used two small jalapenos, 3 1/2 cups of chicken broth, three cans of Great Northern beans and I skipped the garbanzo beans.  I used a full can of corn, drained, and two 4 oz. cans of green chiles.  I cut the cumin back to 1 1/2 t. and thought that was plenty.  My chili was thick enough, so I didn’t need to use the cornstarch and water.  This was good, but not great.  I thought it was lacking some pizzazz.  My version yielded 9 cups and I served it with some shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream and some crushed tortilla chips.

We loved this chili!! I used 2 jalapeños and added cayenne after I let it simmer for a couple of hours. The flavor was great and the cayenne gave it that extra kick we love in this household. Thank you for sharing!

This is a great recipe. I made some alterations and it turned out amazing. It is VERY important, in my opinion, to add 8 oz. of cream cheese and an entire pint of heavy whipping cream at the very end, before you boil it for 5 minutes. Just do it! It gives it an incredible creamy body. I also added mushrooms, used a can of creamed corn instead of a cup of kernels, and added chili powder, paprika, cayenne, and ground white pepper.

Amazing recipe the whole family enjoyed.  I used the ingredients exactly as listed but made it in a slow cooker.  I grilled and shredded the chicken breasts first, then put all ingredients in a slow cooker on low for 8 hours.  The consistency didn't need the final cornstarch step.  Served with a dollop of sour cream and a sprig of cilantro.

Came out great!!  This was simple and delicious.  I added a few more jalepeños but otherwise left the recipe as is.  I might recommend to people not from the Southwest to don't forget to garnish generously with additional chopped cilantro just before serving.

I used a few cans of diced tomatoes w green chillies instead of just chillies. Also added a can of black beans.  This gave it more color.

This was incredibly delicious! I used 3 small thai chilies I had instead of the jalapeño and added some chili powder. I cooked it all in the slow cooker for 12 hours on low. Perfect!

I followed a few of the suggestions that other commenters made regarding some additions, and as I are this chili, I could not stop saying how good it was!!! My 7 and 4 year old are it and I'm seriously looking forward to eating some tomorrow for lunch :-)

OMG!!!  I love all the flavors in this recipe especially the lime.  I cut the recipe in half just to make sure that I would like it and I also added a little ground turkey.  I can't wait to make it for my daughters..

I omitted the jalapeño and cut down the cumin just a little for my family sake but this was a hit! Served with hint of lime tortilla chips and a little sprinkled cheese, yum!

I thought the recipe was easy to make.  I modified the recipe by using sautéed firm tofu instead of chicken and subbed with vegetable broth.  When I make the recipe again, I believe I will try soy curls, Better Than Bouillon No Chicken Base for making the broth, and use a 3rd can of white beans instead of chickpeas.   I thought the flavor was very good.

I added more cumin and a little cayenne pepper. Also used rotisserie chicken,  which added a nice flavor!

Definitely make this again!  We added 2 cans of diced jalepenos as well as a few dashes of crushed red to spice it up a bit more. This makes our “favorites” list.

Excellent rainy night meal.
I did not have corn, so I added polenta which worked out fine.
I also did not have cilantro or fresh jalapenos which is too bad.

I tried to make up for the lost flavor by adding a whiff of chipotle powder, a pinch of cinnamon, a pinch of ground cloves which turned out fine.

I served it on a bed of brown rice with fresh avocado slices on the side. Squeezed fresh lime on to just before serving.
Despite all the ingredients I did not have, it turned out nicely.

I have tried other white chili recipes and they are too bland (only one onion, one clove of garlic) and lacking in a nice subtle undertone and texture.

I enjoyed this, I didn't use as much jalapeno as stated, I didn't want it too spicy. I did mash up about 1/2 cup of beans to thicken it up.  Very easy to make.

This was great! Made a few changes: 1) halved the recipe 2) cooked the chicken, onion, garlic together 3) added some ancho Chile powder 4) skipped the corn starch and didn’t drain the beans. The lime and cilantro are key! After reading other reviews, I decided to use plain Greek yogurt to cool and thicken the chili. It was perfect! And super healthy!

I made this and thought it turned out a bit bland and watery. I added some tortilla chips and sour cream and it was better as a chicken tortilla soup.

4.5 stars.  I made it a bit spicier than written, also added cumin and more beans.  The next time I will add more cilantro. I had to add salt too because I used dried beans and cooked them on the stove top first before adding them to the chili. It is more economical and I can control the sodium that way...I think it tasted better too.  Topped the chili with jalapeno cheese, sour cream, onions and crushed tortilla chips.  Gets better each day.

Love this recipe.  I've been looking for a good white chicken chili recipe for a long time.  I have made this twice now, and it has been delicious both times.  I made it according to the recipe, except I substituted one cup white wine for one cup of chicken broth, and I added a little cayenne pepper and adobo seasoning.  I love the depth of flavor.  My husband gives it two thumbs up, too.

We substituted celery for the onion and left out the garlic (allium allergy).   Otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely and it's great!  Our family will really enjoy this perfect dish on a snowy night. Thanks so much for sharing!

This was delicious except for WOW that jalapeno gets hotter and hotter as it cooks. I made it in the crockpot and just putting in one jalapeno made it too hot for most of us. I would not put it in at all next time. I did cook the chicken first and then added everything to the crockpot. It really was delicious. I bought cilantro and then forgot to put it in but it was still very tasty. Just make sure you like really spicy before adding the jalapeno.

Excellent and easy. I've made this twice following the recipe without changes. Have since used chili powder instead of black pepper and today added diced tomatoes because I had them. We don't find this too spicy and I like the after heat of what I assume to be the cumin. This is a favorite.

I made this and it was delicious! Everyone loved it including my husband who doesn't really like chicken. I wouldn't say it was particularly spicy, so maybe add more jalapeno if you want to kick up the heat.

Only changes I made were to use the broth and meat from 4 boneless chicken thighs I'd cooked in the crockpot earlier, and a serrano pepper instead of a jalepeno. Oh, and i snuck in 1T molasses to help the corn give the whole shebang an earthy sweetness. 

This is just the recipe I was looking for! Thanks!

This has great overall flavor. I prefer a little more spice and am adjusting for this.  When I have perfected that, I will advise for future use.

Fantastic just as posted. I’ve since found that adding more corn and beans doesn’t change the already good flavor but gives us a heartiness we like. The line is what sets the recipe apart and I would drive back to the store just to not leave it out. Adjust the jalapeño by your heat preference and the size of pepper available.

Yumm.  I used Hungarian Peppers instead of the green chilies and jalapeno.  I have ground Cayenne Red Pepper available for heating up if desired.  Served with shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  Excellent.

This was a delicious variation to good old Chili. I cut the recipe in half as it was only for my husband and I. I used the Northern Beans but not Garbanzo as I didn't have them so I replaced them with Canellini. I did not need to use the corn starch as I took the cover off at the end to let it thicken naturally and I used a half cup extra beans to help. I also added a taspoon of salt as it was a little on the bland side and cut back on the hots. I like it to be spicy but not killer. I also cooked it longer than the 45 minutes recommended.

I'm one of those people who never has ALL the right ingredients...So, I improvise. I had no chilies so I used leftover picante sauce. Idk what kind of beans those are but I used navy beans. I didn't have lime juice so iI used lemon and to match the way it was already tasted with these ingredients, I took a risk and used curry instead of cumin, parsley instead of cilantro...lots of pepper, I also added red pepper flakes and a pinch of Cheyenne pepper and chili pepper. Turned out amazing!

Delicious! I roughly followed the recipe. I used 2 different kinds of hot peppers plus a small can of green chills. I used Goya small white beans instead of the great Northern too. I had frozen corn cut fresh off the cob. My chili was a little thin. Probably could have doubled up the cornstarch & water. I added a splash of white wine & a few dashes green Tabasco. Yum!! Will absolutely make again.

Update: have made this several times now and used what was on hand each time, once with ground turkey and cannalini( SP?) beans each time it was great, forgiving and flavorful. I think the secret is the proportions- try it you'll like it!.....The 1st time I had to make a fair amount of adjustments to suit what I had so bear with me. I used home cooked dried garbanzos and a can of pinto beans. Dried Onion and garlic (I was at the cabin)s&p, lime juice from a plastic lime :), a can of corn, a can of chopped green chili's- 2 chicken breasts and chicken broth (canned) and 1 1/2 c of home canned crushed tomatoes from last year. Cumin and  a Mexican season-all called salada complete. Cooked overnight in the crock pot...serving with cornbread from a box...Thanks for the inspiration!

It's great but had to add hot sauce. It wasn't spicy at all. Maybe it's because I used all fresh peppers.

This was excellent!  I made just a couple of changes:  I used rotisserie chicken instead of chicken breasts, I used one can of white beans instead of two and I chopped up some nacho jalapeño peppers out of the bottle because I didn't have the fresh peppers.  I used slightly less chicken broth, about 3.5 cups.  Finally, I topped the chili with sour cream (once served) and had chips and salsa on the side.  Frankly, salsa IN the chili is delicious!  A definite hit at our house!

It was a hit on New Year's Day with collard greens and black eyed peas for our southern tradition bringing prosperity and health! I added a little lemon grass also, yum!
