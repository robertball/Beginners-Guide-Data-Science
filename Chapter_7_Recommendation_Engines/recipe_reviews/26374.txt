Absolutely wonderful recipe! I did change a couple of things and it made it a lot easier. First, I used a large can of chicken broth (48 oz)and then added water to make the 6 cups of liquid. The chicken broth gave it a lovely flavor. Also, I added carrots and celery with the chicken and    just simmered all of it for appox. 30 minutes. (instead of taking the chicken out, cutting it up and putting it back in to cook more). Lastly, I used 1/4 cup cornstarch mixed with a little water to thicken the broth, instead of the flour. It blends in so much easier! This recipe is so good and easy, I will be making it many times this winter. My husband and sons LOVED it. Thank you!

This was great!  I have been looking for a recipe like my mom's southern chicken and dumplings, and this is it!  I used 3 chicken breasts with ribs instead of breasts, and boiled them with an onion wedge, rib of celery, 2 cups chopped carrots, and 1 tsp. salt for 30 minutes, then removed the onion and celery.  Because the chicken is already cooked, I skipped step 2.  I next added 4 more cups water (and another tsp. salt) because it seemed like too much chicken for the amount of broth (would do that again!).  For the thickening, I used 1/3 cup flour and 1/2 cup milk (milk instead of water - makes it more creamy).  I also added 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning, and 1/4 tsp. pepper, as others suggested.  I cooked the dumplings for 25 minutes total (lid off, so that it thickened); otherwise, they weren't done enough.  I also threw in a cup of frozen peas, about 5 minutes before serving.  Nice addition of color (and veggies).  Great comfort food!  Thanks for the recipe!

OH MY YUMMIES!!! First of all, I live in Texas and as I am writing this it is 100 degrees. However, we wanted some comfort food so I made this recipe! HOLY GOSH was it TERRIFIC!! As others, I did make some substitution: instead of water, I used 1 box of low sodium Chicken Broth, and half a box of chicken stock. I added to the broth 1 clove of chopped garlic, some celery, carrots, and a bit of onion powder (didn't have an onion) in addition to the salt and pepper. Then I added one can of the healthy cream of chicken soup before kicking it up to a boil to add the dumplings. After the dumplings were in, I mixed about 1 Tbsp. of cornstarch with some broth and added it to thicken. 
So wonderful and I highly recommend (even in the heat of the summer! just turn up your A/C and enjoy!)

I used this recipe and my family loved it. Upon expermenting, I used pancake mix for all-purpose mix.  It was obviously a little sweeter, but had more taste than just the flour.  My family loves the pancake mix version better.

Boneless skinless breasts are quick and convenient, but they make a pretty bad broth by themselves. I used canned chicken broth instead of water to help that issue. A few carrots and celery don't hurt either. This is a good base recipe but needs adjusted to add flavor.

I boiled a whole chicken so I'd have more stock to cook in.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing. I used LOTS of salt and pepper and I didn't think it was bland at all.  This is the first time I've ever made chicken n' dumplings and they turned out great.  I did add the "dumplings" very slowly so I wouldn't end up with a big, gooey glob.  Thanks!

Thanks for this recipe!!!  I made it a few steps faster using 2 large cans of canned chicken breast meat and 2 cans of chicken broth (then added water to make 6 cups).  I was in a time bind for getting dinner ready!  I've never made chicken and dumplings before, your recipe is terrific!  Thanks again!

My husband loved this which is a huge plus since I love dumplings.  I did add carrots and celery, 6 bouillon cubes and some garlic powder to the dumplings.  It turned out beautifully.  Thank you!!

LOVE this recipe! It is sooo easy. I happened to have made (from allrecipes.com) 'beer butt chicken' the night before so I had the remaining chicken carcase. I boiled the chicken for about 30 minutes and removed all the remaining meat from the bones. I seasoned with seasoned pepper, minced onion (because it was easier), parsley, dash of garlic and kosher salt. I also used WONDRA for thickening. VOILA! I had home-made chicken and dumplings... tasted just like what mom would make. Next time, I'll be sure to add the celery and carrots. This was great... thanks for sharing!

This was excellent.  I only had 2 bone in split breasts, but it still had plenty of meat.  I used 4 cups low sodium chicken broth and 2 cups water.I added a little chicken base and some poultry seasoning.  GREAT!! My husband loved it too.  Definately a keeper.

All the recipes are excellent, but instead of all the fuss with biscuits for dumplings I cut up flour tortillas and drop in the soup.It really tastes like a dumpling, and so much easier.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I did make it more like my mom does by boiling a whole chicken. I used 1 box of chicken broth then covered the chicken with water and added some boullion to give the broth extra flavor. I used 2 whole carrots, 2 stalks of celery, 2 bay leaves, and added some garlic salt. I simmered the chicken for about an hour till it was ready to fall off the bone. I removed it from the broth to cook before tearing into bit size peices, I used cornstarch to thicken the broth and threw the chicken back in. I used Bisquick for the dumplings and followed the directions on this recipe. I served with canned cranberry sauce and fresh green beans. Everyone went back for seconds. YUM!

This was a smash! When making the dumplings be sure to cover and leave it alone for about 10 mins so your dumplings come out perfect!

This recipe is wonderful.  I thought it was easy and delicious!  Instead of water I used chicken broth and I think next time I will use an extra 2 cups or so because I didn't think it had enough liquid.  I also added carrots and celery.  It was a huge hit and I can't wait to make it again!

I made this last week for the first time and my family of eight licked their bowls clean.  It is difficult to find meals that everyone likes, but this passed the test for them all.  After getting requests,I made this again last night and the response was the same.  I followed some advice from previous reviews and added celery, carrots, garlic, onion and peas (at the request of my husband). I also thickened with corn starch and milk and added poultry seasoning and thyme.

This is a great base recipe! I added a can of cream of chicken and about 2 cups of chicken broth because I used 2 cans of biscuits along with BISQUICK -- The entire family likes more dumplings than a standard recipe calls for! I will also say that butter-tasting biscuits really makes the juice TASTY! (And yes, fattening) :-) Thanks!

Great easy recipe. I added 2 cubes of chix boullion and a bay leaf to the cooking water. I didn't need all the flour/water slurry called for to thicken this and only used a couple of T. I added a good pinch of poultry seasoning to the bisquick as I made dumplings. A little white pepper and no additional salt and this turned out fabulous. I'll make this again and again. Thanks!!! It's a winner.

This recipe was a great place to start.  I made a lot of changes, and it turned out awesome!  I cooked the chicken in 5 cups organic low sodium chicken broth and 1 cup vegetable broth, chopped carrots and celery, 1 chopped garlic clove, tarragon, thyme, sage, parsley, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  I shredded the chicken, returned it to the pot, thickened the soup with 1/2 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1/3 can of cream of chicken soup.  I continued to add the 7 spices listed above until I got the taste I wanted.  While that was coming to a boil, I mixed some Heart Smart Bisquick with milk to make the dumplings, added them in, and simmered everything for the remaining 20 minutes.  I made double the dumplings called for because that's my favorite part.  The end result was a rich, flavorful, creamy stew.  It was my boyfriend's first time having chicken and dumplings, and he loved it!  We both had double helpings last night and will finish it off for lunch today!

I made this recipe Saturday. Everyone loved it, including me, and I am not a dumpling fan! I added about 2 teaspoons of garlic granules and 2 tablespoons of chopped cilantro. I will definitely make it again soon! I also made the "baking mix" instead of using a prepared mix.

I have never attempted chicken and dumplings before...this recipe was SO easy for a beginner and it was delicious.   My husband raved about it.  I boiled my chicken breast in half water/half chicken stock and added some poultry seasoning.

I just made this last night and it was a really good starting point. I added chicken bullion and whole baby carrots,chopped onion.celery and fresh minced garlic as well as a couple of bay leaves to the chicken and water. I also used bone in chicken thighs since we like the dark meat better. it has more fat and is more flavorful than breast. The dumplings came out perfect and the whole dish was just amazing. When I found this recipie I noted that with the ingrediants listed it would be pretty bland if I stuck to the exact recipie as it was. I reccomend "tweaking" this recipie and using it as a starting point and guide. It was very simple to make and my Husband and kids were going back for seconds and thirds!

I have been making chicken and dumplings for years, and until my husband ate mine he swore he hated chicken and dumplings, but now loves them. Today I decided I wanted to try it someone elses way. While I think they are great, I know my hubby will not eat them. The dumplings are way too doughy. I always make a regular biscuit dough, roll out pretty thin (maybe 1/4 inch thick), and cut my dumplings into squares. That way does not leave you with a raw dough taste. Also I use canned broth with poultry seasoning, white pepper, and onion powder. I always cook my chicken, then take it out, do the dumplings THEN add the chicken back to the pot. While I think this is a good recipe, I don't like the baking mix part of it.

Very good recipe for the dumplings. I always boil a whole chicken and use the broth. I also add a chicken cube for more flavor!

Pretty good dumplings.  I made my own biscuit mix from a recipe on the internet (flour, baking powder, cream of tarter, shortening, salt) and added frozen carrots.  I also used a chicken carcass that bf had picked relatively clean, so I cooked that for several hours to get the meat off the bones, then removed the bones and proceeded with the recipe.  I added carrots and canned chicken to make it more chicken-y since the carcass didn't have a ton.  I also made this in the crockpot--the dumplings took about 1/2 hour/45 minutes in the crockpot.  This is very filling--I'm stuffed!  And bf seemed to enjoy it since he had two bowlfuls as well as the rest of mine.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awful. No flavor. Dumplings tasted like mush. This recipe is not good. (Made as written)

This seemed a bit "bland".  There wasn't much to it.  Next time, I'll use a little less chicken, double the dumplings, use 1/2 water, 1/2 chicken broth, and 2 or so chicken boullion cubes. Possibly add some carrots & celery too.

This is a great starter recipe! I added a stick of butter, used swanson chicken broth along with the broth from the chicken (but I strained it after cooking in a separate pot because I HATE scummy dumplings,) and I used cans of biscuits to make the dumplings. It was awesome, just like my mom always makes it! I couldn't believe how easy it was considering this was my first time making my favorite dish, had I known then I would've made it long ago! My son and husband both had three bowls each!

It weas really good, but I was afraid it'd be too bland so I did add a couple things, but it was still a good guide for getting me to the end result which was a really good dinner that everyone enjoyed.  I cooked the chick in 1 can broth and water for the rest of the liquid.  I added a can of condensed low fat cream of chicken soup and a tablespoon of flour to thicken the liquid.  I also added 1 onion and about 2 cups of frozen mixed vegetables to boil in the broth after the chick was mostly cooked.  To season, I added pepper, poultry seasoning and another all-purpose seasoning sold by a local restaurant.  I was really happy with how this turned out and using the baking mix was really easy and tasty.

Living here in TN I can tell you I have had some amazing chicken and dumplings. I wasn't sure about the ease of this recipe but let me assure you it was simple, fast and yummy! The only change I did was to add more water to the chicken mix prior to adding the dumplings and I added chicken flavoring to the water as well.
Other than that, perfect recipe! Thanks!

I was always scared to try to make chicken and dumplings but this recipe made it so simple!  I followed the recipe with just a few changes.  I Use Chicken breasts with rib meat, add 3 chicken bouillon cubes some poultry seasoning, garlic powder, celery, and carrots to the water.  I removed the chicken let it cool than put it back in the pot and add the butter and 1 can of cream of chicken soup, bring it to a boil add some frozen peas than thicken it with the flour and water mixture.  I use Jiffy baking mix for the dumplings and my fiance and 2 year old love this recipe.  I have it cooking (for the fourth time since I found this recipe) as I write this review.  This time It was requested that I make extra so my fiance can take some to his coworker tonight!  Thank you for the great recipe!

Wow! I am not a good cook, but .... This fecipe turned out fabulous. I did 4 cups chicken broth and 3 cups water with 1 chicken oxo cube. I added celery and shredded carrots like other reviews suggested. I wanted to add the can of cream of chicken soup but accidentally opened a can of coconut thai soup .... What a pleasant error. So scrumptious. Thanks

Oh holy delicious!!!!! This is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It was exactly what I was looking for! I had to increase the water a big to cover my chicken and I did add seasonings (garlic, garlic salt, pepper, herb-ox, minced onions) to taste and carrots for my family, but other then that I made no changes. This was a huge hit and I know I will be making it time and time again!  Thank you so much for sharing!  This hit the spot on a cold winter's night :)

My family loves this recipe. It is so easy and very yummy! The only thing I do different is use canned chicken broth instead of water to give it more flavor since the boneless skinless chicken breast does not provide a hearty tasting broth!

I have tried many chicken and dumpling recipes that have all turned out to taste horrible but this one was out of this world! I followed the recipe expcept I used Chicken broth instead of water! Well done!

WOW!!!!! 5 stars!!!! Carri, this is wonderful! I have not even finished simmering the dumplings yet and my mouth is salivating.... I followed the instructions left by all the other helpful raters- Broth instead of water, added 2 chx. bullion cubes, added carrots, celery, onion and garlic! This is my first time making chicken and dumplings, and I was about to follow the recipe Paula Deen has on her website( I am a southern woman, after all), but after reading terrible reviews, searched allrecipes and found this! Yum! Thanks in advance for the wonderful praise I am going to get from my hunky hubby for this delicious meal!

This is a great base recipe that can easily be adapted to your liking. Like others, I used chicken broth instead of water. I added fresh thyme to my broth and used corn starch and water as a thickener (1/2 the amount of corn starch instead of the flour called for and a little water). You can't beat this quick meal on a cool dreary day. Everyone in my picky family loves this recipe!

No water for me on this recipe!  Guess I really changed this up a lot.  I used 1 1/2  (14 1/2 oz) cans of chicken broth.   No butter and no flour and water.  Used  left over turkey to replace the chicken and since I was cooking for 2, cut the baking mix to 1 cup with 1/3 cup milk.  The dumplings were light and fluffy just the way I we like them.  The broth not being thicken, allowed the dumplings to obsorb some of the flavor of the broth.  So good done this way.  If you don't get light and fluffy dumplings with this recipe the baking mix may be old.

After making this I just did not 'get' all the rave reviews.  I read many of the reviews again and realized most ratings were based on additions the reviewer made---this was so bland as written and with all the additions I ended up with it became a totally different recipe.  In short, added chicken bouillon, poultry seasoning, minced garlic, Cavender's Greek seasoning, 2 cans of Cream of chicken soup and with these additions it saved my meal.  I thought I would save time with this dumpling recipe but will stick with my rolled dumplings; the difference in taste and texture of the rolled dumplings is just so worth the extra time.

Husband LOVED it! I used 2 cans of chicken w/ juice as well as a can of chicken broth. I added water for the rest of the liquid. I also added some peas, carrots, & seasonings as other comments indicated. I also followed the suggestion about rolling the dough out then adding it (plus my husband indicated he liked the square dumplings). The dough was really sticky, so I used extra baking mix to coat it while I rolled it. This was very easy & didn't take very long. I'll definitely make this again!

Holy !  Not only was this SUPER tasty, but it was the closest to my grandmother's than I've ever found! Had to add more water to cover the chicken, so I added one chicken boullion cube to make up the difference.  Also did a half water half milk mix with the flour to thicken.  FANTASTIC!  I wish I could pick 6 stars.

Tasted good as is, but the second time I made it I used 4 cups chicken broth, 2 cups water, that gave it alot more flavor.

This was so good!  Using other reviewers' advice, this is what I did:  boiled three chicken breasts until cooked through.  Removed from water and shredded.  While doing this, I simmered 1/3 cup finely chopped onion, 1 cup sliced baby carrots, 1 stalk celery, sliced.  Then I added the chicken back in while the veggies were simmering and added 4 boullion cubes.  After simmering for about 30 min. I added about 1/4 cup of corn starch that I disolved in a little cold water.  I seasoned the broth with some pepper and poultry seasoning.  I didn't use the butter, but maybe I'll try it next time.  Finally, I added the dumplings and cooked as directed.  This turned out so good!  The boullion cubes and poultry seasoning added so much flavor and the chicken came out so tender.  Next time I think I'll try adding a little garlic, too.  Thanks for a great recipe for chicken and dumplings.  I highly recommend it!

I gave this 4 stars because it takes longer to make than I care to spend in the kitchen, and because the dumplings taste MUCH better when I add thyme and a little salt.  I will make this again on a weekend.

This was an absolutely wonderful dish!  I often wish I could recreate some of the home cooked meals my mom made and chicken and dumplings were one of those favorites.  Found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I am so glad I did.  Wow!!!  What an awesome recipe.  I went through most of the reviews and mixed a few of the suggestions in with this recipe (added cut carrots and some whole baby carrots.  added some heavy cream, 2 cups of chicken broth with 4 cups of water.  boiled 4 chicken breasts with no bones.  Added diced celery.  Used bisquick for my dumplings and added a little of the poultry seasoning....also used the Paula Deen measurement of butter).  Also threw in about 1/2 cup of extra wide egg noodles).  This was such a creamy wonderful meal.  Made a side dish of rice to go with it.  Took me right back to the days when my mom made this dish.  You can bet I will be making this again!

Thanks so much for this recipe!  I am dairy-allergic, egg-allergic, so I used "Silk" soy-milk instead.  This is the first dumplings recipe I've found that didn't have "cream of" soup or eggs in it. Next time I will try thigh meat for a little different taste.  This is the first time I've eaten dumplings in over 15 years!!!!! Thanks again

About as good as Chicken and Dumplings is going to get. I used boneless thighs and dissolved chicken bouillon in the water (instead of using broth as some users have recommended).

Loved it! I made a few changes out of fear...I'm not very creative when i cook so I play it safe.  I wanted a stronger chicken flavor, I didn't have any broth or stock so I threw in 4 chicken buillon cubes when simmering the chicken. This eliminated the need for any additional salt.  I love onion so I added a little onion salt and a little celery seed. I agree with the author it needs a little more water, maybe a cup more only to make more of it!!! Will make it a regular during the cold months!

I grew up with this recipe and was looking for something to refresh my memory.  It's mostly how I remember it except it was WAY too salty!  Other than not adding any salt and wanting to add carrots and celery, this is the right idea.  It's simple and quick and a perfect comfort meal on a cold winter night...

I used chicken broth instead of water, and added some thyme, rosemary, and carrots (we're not big celery fans). I also added some rosemary to the dumplings to give them a little extra flavor, and I didn't bother to remove and shred the chicken -- I just cut it into small pieces before putting it into the pot.  I've tried this twice: once with flour and once with cornstarch. Something about the texture wasn't quite right either time, so I doubt I'll make this one again.

FANTASTIC!!! I've made this several times all to raving reviews from my family!  To spice it up, I add in a finely diced sweet onion and any veggies that I have on hand (frozen or fresh) - it's a great way of getting the children to eat their veggies! For the dumplings, I just use Pillsbury Bisquits' and tear into small pieces and throw on top for the last 30 minutes of cooking time - delicious! :0)  Makes me want to make some right now! :0)

I changed the recipe up a bit, but it turned out excellent!  I used chicken broth to boil the chicken, instead of water, and I added a few cloves of garlic with the chicken.  I also added a few other random seasonings that I had in the cupboard.  The last thing I changed was that I didn't add the flour and water to thicken the soup, because the dumplings thickened it plenty.  I had been looking for an easy chicken and dumpling recipe, and this was it!

Great recipe and easily adaptable to personal taste. I used seasoned chicken broth to replace water,then added leftover rotisserie chicken, carrots, peas, mushrooms and onion. I thickened the mixture with skim milk and flour instead of water. Love the dumplings!

Very tasty, but I made a few adjustments, reason for 4 stars.  I cooked the chicken in chicken broth.  I didn't add flour and water to the soup because the dumplings thicken it anyway.  Also, I mixed chicken stock instead of milk to the baking mix so the dumplings would have a chicken flavor. My family enjoyed it.

Absolutely wonderful recipe!  The only changes I made were: I boiled a whole chicken (covered completely in water in a stock pot) with carrots and a 1/2 white onion-wedged (I did not have celery or else I would have used this as well), seasoned liberally with Salt, Pepper Garlic Powder and Poultry seasoning. Boiled for about an hour, then followed recipe completely except I had to double the rue in order to get the soup to have a thicker consistency. It still wasn't as thick as I would have liked, but it was WONDERFUL!! Next time, I am probably going to double the dumplings, though. They were so good and reminded me of my mom's cooking while growing up in Texas! Thank you for posting this recipe!

As everyone else mentioned - I used broth instead of water.  Much better flavor.

I added in some cut onion, celery, peas and carrots.  

Great easy recipe.

I browned the chicken (after I seasoned it with salt, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder) and then added it to 6 cups chicken broth (did not use any water). I also sauteed a small onion and put that in (along with a can of cream of chicken soup) when I added the chicken back. It took a LOT longer than the recipe says for the dumplings to cook all the way through and I had to watch it and stir often because the chicken started to stick once I added the dumplings. Overall, very good. My husband is not a fan of boiled chicken dishes, but he loved this. Will definitely make again.

Pretty good, this is probably my fault, but the chicken got a bit to crispy on the bottom of the pan.

I made some shortcuts and it turned out delicious anyway.  Sauteed onions and celery in butter then I added a Rotisserie chicken from the grocery store, shredded.   Chicken stock from the carton and handfuls of frozen veggie mix.  I used the cornstarch instead of the flour mixture and it thickened nicely.  I did add milk to make it "creamy".  The kids enjoyed helping w/ the dumplings and dropping them in the pot.  Will keep in my recipe box.

This is honestly the best Chicken and Dumplings I've ever made.  I cooked the chicken in chicken broth with diced onion, garlic power, salt and pepper.  I doubled the liquid and added 2 tbsp. butter.  I added some frozen vegetables an hour before we ate.  I thickened the mixture with Wondra and milk for a nice creamy gravy.  My husband absolutely loved this recipe.  Thanks so much.  Its a definite keeper!

This was ok, not great.  Had to keep adding salt and pepper to give it some flavor.  I should of used the chicken broth like others suggested.  I will keep looking.

Other reviewers used chicken broth instead of the water, so I did, too-works great. I use 2 BOXES of chicken broth and also double the flour and water mix.  My big family loves this recipe. Gotta try it-you will LOVE IT!

This turned out awesome. I used chicken broth instead of water. I also added 2 stalks of celery chopped and 2 carrots chopped. I made a little more dumplings cause thats my favorite part.  They were delicious, light and fluffy....like grandma's.  :) Thanks!

I boiled frozen chicken breasts with carrots, celery, onion and garlic.  Other than that I didn't change a think.  My four year old who won't eat a thing cleaned his plate without a fuss.

I used this recipe as my base but also added vegetable stock, low sodium chicken broth, minced garlic & onion and garlic & onion powder along with a pinch of Italian seasonings.  I also did as another reviewer suggested and used cornstarch instead of flour. This was a tad spicy but delicious! My husband and I both had 2nd helpings!

I've tried many dumpling recipes and haven't been happy with any of them as they all seem to come out so heavy. I must agree with you Carri that baking mix makes an excellent dumpling that's light and fluffy. My kids plus my daughters' very picky boyfriend devoured them! In this recipe I used chicken breasts with the bone and browned well in a pan. I then deglazed the pan with chicken broth from the can and placed all the broth into a soup pot with the chicken plus carrots, celery, onion and seasonings for flavor. Once the chicken was simmered thru, I strained and proceeded to thicken the gravy. This comforting dish was loved by the whole family!

Excellent and delicious! I made this for 3 people instead of 6. I used 4 cups of chicken brother, two chicken breasts and 2 cups of Bisquick. Next time I'll use 1.5 cups of Bisquick. I also used corn starch instead of flour. I'll be making this regularly as the temperatures cool down outside.

I added heavy cream to the soup instead of milk and flour. I also used heavy cream instead of milk with the baking mix to make drop dumplings. This gave the soup a creamy taste and look and the dumplings were fluffy.

Great recipe. Made it for the first time using this recipe and using chicken broth instead of water. Fabulous!

I made this for dinner and not was it delicious! I did however make this slightly different than what the recipe calls. I used 4 cups of chicken brother & 2 cups of water.I used a large stockpot, and after adding my shredded chicken back in, I noticed I didn't have much water. I also added an additional 4 cups of chicken brother and two cups of water to bring it high enough for the dough to form into dumplings. I then doubled the flour mixture. It came out perfect! I will without a doubt be making this again!

I used thighs with skin on instead of skinless, boneless breasts to add flavor to my stock. I then removed and discarded the skin when I pulled the meat off the bone. For flavor I then chopped a large onion and 3 cloves of garlic and then sliced 3 carrots for color, all of which I added to the stock before I began adding dumplings. The dumplings were some of the best I have ever made and overall this recipe, with my changes, was the best chicken and dumplings I've ever made.

Great recipe.  Simple concise instructions.  I added some of my favorite herbs and spices that my family knows and loves,  but other than that I followed the instructions as given and it was a HIT!   My husband had three servings!  This one's a simple winner and will definitely be made again!

This was very good! I used chicken broth instead of water and did put in some rice at the end.  Will use this recipe every time I made chicken and dumplings.

This recipe is very simple and I am sure it was okay as written. Knowing that you get more flavor from chicken on the bone, I used breasts and thighs with the bones, along with boxed stock and I added celery, onions and carrots to the stock.  The dumplings are soft and they also used to thicken the broth. Very tasty and I will make this again. Par boil your chicken, throw out the water and add the stock.

This is so simple and so good!! All the other recipes I looked at were way too complex for my 5 kids and I. We just simply do not have the time or patience for anything but simple. This was so good. The whole family loved it, and trust me they all never agree on much.

Absolutely delicious!  I love that there was no canned soup. All I did differently was to use 3 chicken breast halves, cooked them in 6 cups liquid (2/3 of which was chicken broth) with chopped carrots, celery and onions. I simmered it all for 30 min then removed chicken and shredded it. I used cornstarch with milk as the thickener. Got rave reviews, and it has got to be healthier than a canned version. Used low sodium broth so I was able to control that better. Will make again and again. So easy and delicious.

I had a request for Chicken and Dumplings, so I tried this recipe. Like many people, I made some changes to suit our tastes. I used half of the water recommended and the other half was chicken broth. Then I added 1 tsp. poultry seasoning, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and one chicken bouillon cube. It was a hit!

Loved it. 10/10 I did change it a little. Bought a chicken from the local grocery that was cooked on a spit. Removed the two breasts. Everything else went into a dutch oven 2 qts  water with half of an onion quartered, 2 ribs celery cut in 2" pieces and 2 carrots cut the same. Rolling boil for 2hr covered. Strain bones, keep veggies for soup, spoon some fat off and there is your stock. S&P to taste.

So good on a cold, rainy night!  I made the following changes:  Used all boneless skinless breasts because that's what I had on hand.  I used chicken soup base, some thyme, a bay leaf and onion in the broth.  I used milk and flour to thicken instead of water.  I'll be putting this into my rotation for sure!

My family loves this recipe and it is easy to make after working all day! I add some poultry seasoning and use 1/2 chicken broth. Cornstarch will thicken and is easier to blend then flour.

Delicious, however I modified it a bit.
Within those 6 cups of water, I added to chicken bouillon cubes, and a packet of chicken flavor booster by Swanson. I also used cornstarch instead of flour. My Husband and 2 small kids really enjoyed it!

I thought the flour mixture made it too thick and gave it a weird flavor. Will try again but with 1/2 the recommended flour. Dumplings weren't bad but some of them were gooey, or too dense. Thank you for the spatula trick because my chicken was definitely sticking to the bottom of the pot.

I cut this recipe in 1/2 so that it would feed 3 instead of 6.  I pretty much followed this recipe exactly as written with the exception of using 2 large bone-in chicken breasts and adding extra water to cover the chicken.  While cooking the chicken breasts, I seasoned them with poultry seasoning, salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder.  I really loved this recipe and next time the only change I will make is to add a bit more extra water and to make my dumplings a bit smaller before dropping them in as I didn't realize that they would grow so much while cooking.  :)  Overall this is a very good and easy to make recipe.  I have never made chicken and dumplings before and was pleased with the results.  Unfortunately my 12  year old daughter didn't care for it that much so I probably won't be making it often.

mMmm..talk about comfort food. this surely hit the spot for me. i added chopped carrots, celery and potatoes in with the chicken. i didn't use the baking mix method for the dumplings because i didn't have any so i used a dumpling recipe i found on AR and it came out good.

This recipe was pretty good! My family liked it. Instead of water I added 3 teaspoons of chicken base the Amish Kitchen kind, to the 6 cups water and I think it gave it a great flavor. I also used 1/4 cup of cornstarch instead of 1/2 cup of flour, the consistency was great.

This was great and easy to "throw" together, however, I read some reviews and also added things. I used 4 cups chicken broth and 2 cups water. I added chopped onion, celery and carrots to the broth along with 3 boneless chicken breasts. I thickened it and then added the shredded chicken, then the dumplings, I thought it had great flavor and my husband liked it too. Will definetly make it again!

Oh my word!  Great base for a recipe, did a few adjustments according to my taste.  I used chicken broth, rather than water.  Also, did add chopped celery & carrots, and a savory blend of herbs.  Rather than make my biscuit mix, I purchased Pillsbury Grand buttermilk biscuits, split in half.  It came out wonderfully tasty.

Comfort food at its best!  I grew up on this stuff and although my grandmother made her dumplings from scratch, these taste very good.  I love the ease of using Bisquick for these dumplings.  I added celery, carrots,and garlic as well as a can of cream of chicken soup.  That gave it some really good flavor.  I only had 4 chicken thighs thawed out, but it was plenty of chicken.  I also used some leftover chicken stock instead of just all water for more flavor and thickened it with whole wheat flour.  Thanks for the recipe!

I changed a few things but overall, this is easy, quick, and tasty.  I used cornstarch and water as my thickener.  Instead of water, I used Penzey's soup base.  I added carrots, onion, and celery for flavor.  Bisquick  for the dumplings.  This was a yummy weekday meal!

Nice and easy receipe.  Hall all of the ingredients on hand.  I boiled breasts in chicken broth and added a can od cream of mushroom soup.  After shredding the chicken I omitted the butter but added italian seasonings, garlic, and celery seed to the soup.  My guys loved it!

This was a HUGE hit with my family!! I made quite a few changes to the recipe, to fit the ingredients that I had on hand. I used two boneless/skinless chicken breasts. I boiled them in chicken broth, with an additional 2 cups of water/chicken bouillon. To the broth, I added some garlic salt, chopped onion, a dash of italian seasoning, and parsley. I let this boil for an hour, and then shredded the chicken. I added the butter, and also a can of peas, and a can of carrots and let return to a boil. I let boil for an additional hour, before adding 1/2 cup cornstarch mixed in 1 cup water, and returned to a boil. I made the dumplings and dropped them in to cover the top of my mixture. I let this cook, uncovered for 25 minutes. I let the whole thing sit 15 minutes before serving. This made enough to serve 4 grown adults, and my toddler, with some leftovers!! I will definately be making this again! I only rated it a 4 because of all my changes!

Uber yummy! This was the first time I have ever tried making this. I brought it to a potluck and it was gone in no time at all. I received many compliments, as well. Just plain good food. Thanks for sharing this one!

Good base recipe. I used chicken tenderloins instead of chicken breasts and also used chicken broth instead of water. I added half a can of cream of chicken and half a can of cream of celery. Also, I seasoned the biscuit mixture lightly with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. One more addition: I added frozen mixed vegetables. After those adustments, I think it was perfect. Great meal to make it through cold winters!

Delicious!  Definitely one of my fave recipes! Instead of using 6 cups water, I did 3 cups of chicken broth and then 3 cups of water.  Gives it a little more flavor. I also used cornstarch instead of flour. And using the baking mix cuts back on time and tastes great.

So good! Like most of the reviews, I too jazzed this recipe up a little bit.  I didn't use as much chicken as it called for and didn't have chicken broth on hand so i tossed in a few chicken bouilon cubes. I added just a touch more butter and onions. I also think the corn starch and water mixture is smoother so i substituted that.  I didn't add veggies this time, but next time i will for sure! My very picky 9 yr old step son complimented me and asked when we could have this again! That in itself is HUGE!!! This is a new family favorite for sure! Thanks!

With a few modifications, this tasted just like my mom's recipe! I boiled the chicken in 4 cups of chicken broth, 2 cups of cream of celery soup and 1 cup of water. I also added carrots, half a tsp of ground cumin and half a tsp of garlic powder. This will definitely be added to my winter comfort food rotation!

Dumplings were gummy lumps and had no taste. I tried adding 1/2 tsp salt and 1 1/2 tsp baking powder to flour mixture but did not help.  Perhaps I like my dumplings different from the other raters. My husband disliked it also.

Excellent recipe.  Did use chicken stock and some chopped onion, carrot, and celery.  First time making chicken and dumplings and it came out just wonderful.  There were no leftovers and can't wait to make it again!  Thank you for posting.

This is a wonderful recipe.  The only thing I did different instead of water I used chicken broth.  This was the best chicken and dumplings I have ever had.  My daughter loved it and she is a very picky eater.  Thanks for sharing!

Definetly use broth instead of water and bullion. I used dark meat (personal preference). With the broth 5 stars, without only 4 stars.

Great recipe for quick Chicken and Dumplings, only thing is the dumplings would've been better rolled out and cut into squares instead of clumps. Other than that we loved it!

This was really good, and my family loved it.  I've tried to make dumplings before, but they've never turned out.  This time, perfection!  Like many others here, I also used chicken broth instead of water.  I added frozen mixed vegetables and simmered them for a couple of minuteds, added cut-up leftover roasted chicken, sage and marjoram, but otherwise follwed the directions here for the thickening and the dumplings.  There was plenty left over so we had it again the next night and it was still delicious!  Thanks!

I was sick last month and all I wanted was my mother's chicken and dumplings, but didn't have the recipe. My husband found this one and it was even easy enough for him to make. We also used broth instead of water, we also used milk instead with the thickening. We added celery for a little more flair too. But the dumplings them selves are great, you must try it.

My husband LOVED this recipe. I can't wait to have it again. I made a few adjustments to the recipe. I added carrots that I cut up in my chopper. My husband will not eat vegetables and this was an easy way to add them without changing the consitancy of the recipe. Also I feel that the recipe needs more water. When I was eating this I felt that it was a little too dry but nothing that could not be fixed. I also used water but added chicken boilon cubes for some extra flavoring.

This is a good and easy recipe.  I add one can cream of chicken soup with the flour and water (before adding dumplings). Season generously.  It is better the next day.

Love this with easy changes. I substitute leftover chicken or a rotisserie chicken from the store and cook the dumpling in chicken broth, canned works great. Add a bag of frozen peas and carrrots for color. My teens beg for it at least once a month.

This recipe is awesome.  I made it in a slow cooker.  Super easy.  Either use broth or throw in 6 bullion cubes.  I also added some finely chopped onions and celery (a few tablespoons of each) and about 6 carrots.  I also added 1 can of cream of chicken soup and didn't need the flour mixture at all.  Cook for about 6 hours, shred the chicken w/ 2 forks right in the cooker and do the dumplings 1/2 hour before you're ready to eat.

This was really good. I added herbes de provence and used some boxed chicken broth in place of part of the water. It all turned out excellent, great leftovers for lunch too! Baking mix dumplings were perfectly flavored.

Great recipe and very easy!  Varied it a bit after reading the other reviews (ie: used some chicken broth, added carrots and onions and used cornstarch with water to thicken.)  A perfect cold weather meal, will make again in the near future.

This recipe tasted very good! I added onion, carrots, and celery also. Using milk instead of the 1/2 cup of cold water does work much better...thanks. Also I let the chicken and veggies simmer for about an hour until the chicken fell apart easily. When time to make the dumplings I removed the chicken and veggies to make room for them! This dish turned out great!

My kids raved about this recipe, and cleaned their plates! Then asked for seconds. It is rare occurence in my houshold. I did add chicken soup base to the water, along with a finely chopped onion and 2 minced garlic cloves. And I used cornstarch to thicken it up. Thanks for the great recipe.

This came out really good and DH and kids loved it.  I used left over chicken from grilling for the meat.  I made it into a broth and then peeled the meat off.  I substituted the water for the chicken broth I had made.  I also used one can of Cream of Chicken soup to give it more flavor and I made biscuits with Bisquick.  It all was terribly good and we'll eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

This was delicious! I changed a lot though. First I cut the chicken breasts into small pieces and completely cooked it with onions, carrots, a little oil, butter and small amount of water to keep it from scorching. I flavored it with onion and garlic powder, parsley, salt, pepper, and red pepper. I then added chicken broth and a can of cream of chicken, and I still did the water and flour mixture. This made it really thick and creamy. I also added hominy. For the dumpling part I used the "Fluffy Biscuit" recipe on this site. They were so good. These were delicious and would be even better during the fall and winter.

This was excellent.  The only thing I changed was that I added a boullion for each cup of water and then seasoned with rosemary, garlic, and poultry seasoning.  Thank you for sharing!

Though I love chicken and dumplings, my family is not as keen on this dish.  But, I made it the other night and the whole thing was gone.  I actually used a roasted chicken from the grocery store I had bought the day before.  I shredded the chicken which was easier than making new.  I also used the 6 cups of water with chicken boullion to make a broth for the already cooked chiken.  It was so simple and delicious!

This is almost the same way I cook my chicken and dumplings but instead of adding flour and water like I use to a friend of mine told me to use cream of chicken soup and it gives it more flavor. I think it tastes better but both ways are great.

Yes, very easy and delicious.  I used two large cartons of chicken broth (one low sodium) and added carrots and celery.  I also only used 3 chicken breasts and it was plenty of meat.  My husband was so excited!

This is a good basic chicken and dumpling recipe. I added chicken broth instead of water, and I added my favorite seasonings to my bisquick mix. Only add enough milk to pull everything together. I know I added enough when after i'm done mixing, all the dough forms a very stiff ball. Be very carefull not to put to many dumplings in your pot or they will never turn out. Its really no biggie to have to make more or to add more later if you need to. I also thickened it up a bit with a little heavy cream. Very good. Will definatly make again.

this was an excellent recipe! i used short thighs w/ the skin and it came out fabulous. i simmered them and  then cut it off the bone. i had also sauted a couple cloves of garlic and 1/8 c onion in butter  and added it to the broth and let it cook more along with the chicken and it was very flavorful. this one is definitely a keeper. thanks :D

This recipe reminded me of my Mom's Chicken and Dumplings when I was being raised.  My Mom was a down home cook from Cincinnati.  I can think of no better compliment then to say that it reminded me of my Mom's home made recipe.  Thank you!

I have to feed a very large family of 20 every sunday. Every single week i hear from each of them,"when are you making those chicken and dumplings again??" It's a huge crowd pleaser and SO simple to make.Of course i had to quadruple the recipe,but no matter how much or how little of it i make,it ALWAYS comes out perfect! Thanks so much for this recipe.

I changed some things (used 2 cans of canned chicken, 2 cans chicken broth ans added a little more of the flour mixture for thickening) I also rolled the dough out instead of dropping by tablespoons. But I have to say that this was my very 1st time making chicken  dumplings and they were very easy and yum, yum, yummy, They reminded me a lot of my grandma's (which were made from scratch) Thanks for the recipe!!!!
