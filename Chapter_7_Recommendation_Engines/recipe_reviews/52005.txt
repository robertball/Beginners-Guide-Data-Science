So yummy!  There wasn't even a crumb left over.  I would have given this 5 stars but I added additional spices to the mayo mixtures....thyme, rosemary, oregano, and dried parsley for color.  It was so moist, so tender, and so fast!  I made mine on top of a wire rack on a cookie sheet, and then flipped them for the last 5 minutes so that it would be crispy all the way around.  Delicious!  I can't wait to try it with Kraft Dijonaise instead of mayo for a little less fat and more flavor.
*edit*
I think it's a MUST to cook this on a wire rack and flip at the end....we didn't do this the second time I made it and it was a soggy mess on the bottom.

WOOT WOOT ! lol.  I did make some minor changes that i think helped make this dish 5 stars. Try using crushed croutons instead of the Italian bread crumbs. It made it that much more crunchier! Use chicken tenderloins, that way the chicken crunches up better. I also cooked it on a pampered chef stone! YUMM, I loved this and will make it several times a month.

This is such a great recipe!  My Mom used to make this all the time when I was a kid.  I usually go an egg wash, but I thought I'd give the mayo a try just for old times sake and to see what my husband thought.  I added more seasoning to my bread crumbs (parsley, oregano, basil, rosemary) and used Hellman's light mayo and light Parmesan cheese.  I sprayed the bottom of the baking dish with Pam so nothing would stick and these came out moist and delicious - perfect with a side of twice baked potates and a salad.

it's a good recipe but i don't think mayo is the best ingredient to dip the chicken in. Mayonnaise as u know is an emulsion of mustard, oil and egg yolk; so when it is heated it seperates and the oil oozes away making the bread crumbs moist and non crispy. try replacing the mayo with just eggs or egg-mustard dip.

I followed the recipe exactly and this came out really, REALLY good! I almost didn't try this b/c I hate the taste of mayo and parm cheese but since others said you couldn't taste them I decided to give it a try. They were right... I didn't taste either one of them at all! I used this to make chicken parmesam (sp?) and my husband LOVED this! My only suggestion is if you have really thick breasts to either cut them in half or pound them down. I think this would of been even better/crisper if the chicken was thinner. My breasts must of been on Steriods b/c they were HUGE! LOL  I did use the suggestion to cook it on a cookie rack (on a covered cookie sheet)and I turned each breast 5 mins before they were done to crisp the bottem as well and that worked good... I'll probably do that every time now. And now I'll probably try the other suggestions for adding different spices and maybe using real garlic since I always have fresh garlic on hand. Thanks for the recipe.. This was so much better than using store bought breaded chicken patties!

This recipe was so darn easy to make, and the chicken was so moist and tender, and delicious - my family love it, and since it's easy to make this recipe is a keeper. 

I was concerned that using mayo would make this a greasy dinner, but no way, it was not. I just wiggled the chicken, both sides, in the mayo mixture, then into the bread crumbs. I covered mine in a 9x13 glass baking dish for the first 15 minutes of cook time, then I cooked another 10 minutes uncovered, then I actually turned on the broiler for five last minutes.

Excellent.  I can't help but think that making my own fresh bread crumbs and seasoning them with my favorite Tuscan seasoning blend helped.  So did using freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and seasoning the chicken well with salt and freshly ground pepper.  The seasoning I used has a fair amount of "green stuff" in it, otherwise I would have added fresh chopped parsley to the mix.  The chicken looked a little dry going in, so I spritzed it with olive oil and I think that made a huge difference in getting the coating crispy and golden.  This turned out tender, juicy and with the crisp coating I had hoped for.  Just delicious. Another of those "big pay-off for little effort" type of recipes.

So good! Five stars with added spices. Made half mayo/cheese mixture which was enough for 3 breasts. Added onion powder, kosher salt and pepper. Everything else exactly as listed. My daughter declared it her "favorite chicken!" Thanks for sharing!!

Quicker way without measuring: lay chicken on pan lined with foil/sprayed with pam.  Spread thin layer of mayo to just cover the chicken. Sprinkle with a little garlic powder, then a thin layer of parm cheese and finally a layer of italian style breadcrumbs (I didn't measure, but did not use anywhere near as much as indicated in the recipe-just nice thin layers).  It comes out fantastic and is sooo simple to put together.

SOOOO good! I've got a non-chicken eater girlfriend who asks for more of these tenders. Thats how good they are. I use light mayo so I can eat them too! It satisfies my craving for fried-tasting chicken without all the fat and calories.

I have for years been making this recipe but this recipe is also very good with pork chops.  Keeps them from drying out.  Tip: before baking spray the chicken or pork chop with cooking spray so that the coating browns up like shown in photo otherwise it will not brown well and the bread crumbs dryout.

This was excellent and so easy.  Didn't need any dipping sauce or anything and the chicken came out so tender and flavorful.  The only thing I would do next time is reduce the amount of mayo, parm and garlic powder as there was just too much of it. 
Thanks for the great recipe

Incredible recipe.  Took the advice of a prior reviewer and used croutons, what a great idea.  So much more flavor and crunch.  Now, if you really want incredibly moist and tender chicken, nothing does it better than this.  Brine it.  1/4 cup of salt per gallon of water and just leave it in a pot or plastic bag in your fridge for at least 6 hours but I've been known to do it for as long as overnight.  You can overcook the chicken and it will still be moist with this.  Can and herbs, spices to your taste to infuse the flavor into the chicken.   I just defrosted some chicken breasts today and was going to make chicken enchiladas but I can't get the taste of this out of my mind and how much easier this is so I'll be making this again tonight.  It's already in the brine.

I gave it 5 stars, because it's so delicious and easy!  Yes, I do tweak it to save calories.  I brush on dijon mustard, add some fresh cracked pepper (don't need extra salt), then dip in seasoned panko crumbs and bake as directed.  Just as delicious, but not fattening!

I've been doing something similar for years. Mix 1 part seasoned bread crumbs and 1 part grated parmesan. This can be stored indefinitely in an airtight container in the fridge. When you're ready, dip the chicken in melted butter, coat it with bread crumbs and bake as suggested in this recipe.

Just remember to never dip your raw chicken into your stash of bread crumbs -- always transfer a small portion to a plate, use that to coat the chicken and discard what you don't use.

For a twist, pulse herb seasoned stuffing mix in a food processor and use that in place of the bread crumbs.

This recipe was so easy and so tasty! The only thing I did differently was use panko crumbs instead of breadcrumbs, only because I like the extra crunch panko crumbs provide. 
This recipe is a keeper!

This is a good chicken recipe.  It turned out moist and a little crunchy on the outside.  I knew I wouldn't have a lot of time to make them, so I just threw the chicken into ziplock bags with the mayo, massaged the bag so that they were covered, and let them sit like that in my fridge overnight.  The next day, I just took them out, dipped in a mixture of the bread crumbs and parm cheese, placed on a foil-wrapped sheet, and sprinkled with the garlic powder.  I served it with Skillet Green Beans from this site.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for with so little time to cook tonight.  It was very mosit and tasty.  I used Panko Japanese Style Bread Crumbs, cut the mayo a bit, and grated fresh parmesan cheese.  As with another reviewer I put it under the broiler the last 5 minutes to crisp and brown the crust a little more.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will definately make it again.

This is a very similar recipe that Hellmans offers.  You mix the cheese and mayo and spread it on the chicken, then you sprinkle the bread crumbs on top.  The bottomw ould not get soggy this way.  Fool Proof everytime!

For sure follow the advice of other reviewers and place over a wire rack on top of a cookie sheet (with edges so the greese doesn't spill into your oven (a jelly roll pan works well) and line that with foil and spray some cooking spray on the wire rack for easier clean up - even a broiler pan works.) otherwise you will have a soggy mess on the bottom. I did think it need some salt and pepper but I like things a little on the salty side. Easy recipe to play with the ingredients although I didn't change a thing. I bet the tangy zip of miracle whip instead of mayo would be good to try.

Holy cow- this was GOOD!  I have made a lot of chicken recipes from this site, and I do believe this one is my favorite.  We used lite mayo and Panko Italian breadcrumbs.  We also placed the chicken on a wire cooling rack on top of the baking sheet to help maintain crispiness on the bottom of the chicken.  We cooked it at 400 degrees for 35 minutes, but our chicken breasts were HUGE!  We had to use probably about double the stated breadcrumb amount in order to cover the chicken.  Not a big deal though.  Absolutely fabulous, and a real kid pleasing recipe.

I do this all the time to my chicken .... its an awesome recipe ... I do not use the mayonnnaise though ... seasoning possibilities are endless! I sometimes stuff mine with ham and swiss and make my own cordon bleu!

Since I live alone, I chose not to "dip" the chicken pieces. I rinsed and dried pieces with a paper towel (necessary for mayonnaise to adhere to raw chicken), spread the mayonnaise on with a knife, and sprinkled the remaining ingredients. I lined the baking pan with foil. The thing I liked about the recipe is that I could easily make adjustment for one serving. I think it may be better with a other seasonings, however, I probably won't be making it again.

Out standing!  I have cooked it acouple of time, but instead of the seasoned bread crumbs I use either saltines or ritz crackes hand crushed. Almost forgot, I put a little finely ground black pepper in the crumbs, but only to taste.

This recipe was perfect for a mid-week dinner for two, plus lunch for the next day. Adding additional herbs and spices to my liking, and this dish was PREFECT!! One thing that I think is a MUST in making that dish is to pound out the meat. Gives it that Olive Garden look and cooks evenly! This recipe will remain in rotation for a quick, yummy meal. :)

I must say, this is a great recipe!Just now finished eating it! Nothing like what I thought it would be like!  The crumbs fell off the top when I tried turning it over.  It wasn't as crispy as I had expected it to be.  However, I am NOT blaming anyone except for myself on that being that I definately AM NOT a cook! I just like to try out some easy, tasty, recipes!  Thx so much!  I WILL be trying this again!  5 stars!

This was amazing! I used tenders and added the seasonings to the mayo so they would stay on the meat. Used plain bread crumbs from bread I messed up and ground up instead.  I love this recipe!!!

I've made this recipe for many year.  I find that brushing the chicken instead of dipping it into the mayo mixture works better for my family.  Sometimes the mayo overpowers the other ingredients.  This is one of my standby recipes.  It never fails.

I made this a little differently than instructed.  I used a cast iron skillet, coated with non-stick cooking spray.  I spread only one side of the chicken with the mayo mixture and then coated it with panko bread crumbs that I had seasoned with a nice Tuscan  seasoning.  I placed them in the skillet panko side up and baked as directed.   This way there was no soggy bottom to worry about.  This was good and super easy.  It would also be excellent as parmesan chicken, adding mozzarella and your favorite pasta sauce.

Good basic recipe for a different twist on baked chicken. I have found an egg wash to work better than the mayo (have tried the dish both ways.) The family and I really enjoyed it, just felt it was lacking flavor (added some salt, pepper and ranch seasoning when we used the egg wash and that definitely improved it for us.)

I made a mistake of mixing all ingredients including bread crumbs. doh! So I spread the mixture using butter knife on chicken breast, both sides. I think its important to use non-stick baking paper to brown both sides easily and easier to turn using large spatula, this way all crumbs stay put on chicken. I used medium thickness of chicken breast (if your chicken breast is thick, slice it in 3). The mixture covered 5 pieces. I baked it at 345 F.(fan-forced oven) keeping an eye on it because this coating tends to burn easily. I have a picture of how mine turned out. It was very tender at the same time the topping is crispy and delicious. Will keep making this.

Made exactly as written and loved it! To improve it I will bake on wire rack on top of cookie sheet next time (recommended by another review to make crispy all around) and will try greek yogurt/mustard mixture instead of mayo just to save calories.

This is very easy to make and tasty! I've tired this with cheddar/mozza. and it too was pleasing. This could also be pan fried and rolled into other types of crumbs such as Ritz.

This is such a nice dish.  Instead of using mayo, I dipped the chicken in buttermilk and then coated it with the mixture of italian bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.  I served it with spaghetti or marinara sauce with cheese on top.  It was wonderful!

Made this for my very discerning book club meeting last night - what a hit!  Have already emailed everyone this recipe.  Made according to recipe but followed a lot of the advise of the previous reviewers.  I used fresh mayo, chunk of fresh parmesan that I grated, used a mixture of breadcrumbs and crushed croutons and mixed in some oregano/parley/basil/rosemary herbs chopped finely from our garden.  Served with green garden salad and fresh potatoe balls.  Stunning!

Very simple and very good!  I was hesitant to use mayo, but it turned out perfectly, not greasy at all.  I didn't use as much mayo as the recipe called for though, just enough to lightly coat the chicken.  I used 9 chicken tenders instead of breasts and added lots of spices to the breadcrumbs to add more flavor.  I had to cook it 10 min. longer (30 total) for the chicken to be cooked all the way through.  Cooking on a wire rack over a cookie sheet helps a lot too - makes it much more crunchy!  Even my 2 year old ate it!  Yum!

I was wondering if the final product would live up to the recipe's juicy title and it exceeded my expectations! Very helpful reviews. I made this according to the original recipe, plus a couple pinches of my favorite herbs and spices; I would also use less mayo & cheese, 1/2 cup of each should suffice because I threw away almost a 1/4 cup of each! Also, I tried one chicken breast in italian dressing- more flavor but I'd rather marinate it first; the mayo chicken was more tender.

Made for the 1st time tonight - only giving 4 stars because it was a little dry. I followed another review that suggested baking on rack instead of the sheet - the bottom of the chicken stuck to the rack.  Next time will bake on my stone pan - will follow up with another review.  The flavor is very good & will make again. Thanks!

This was a very moist and flavorful recipe.  I made a little spaghetti with red sauce on the side.  Bread and a side salad.  The whole family loved it.  Also baked it on the Pampered Chef stone.

This is SO Good. It's practically fail safe. My dad makes his chicken this way most of the time. Although if he is out of parmesan cheese, he will use Italian dressing in its place, and it works just as well, tastes just as good. Also if the pieces of chicken are huge, you may just want to pan fry enough to sear it first, and then pop it in the oven.

I added the parmesan cheese to some Italian dressing and dipped the chicken breasts.  Then layed them in some crushed seasoned breadcrumbs until coated.  Baked them for 25-30 mins. at 425 on a metal cooling rack over a pizza pan.  Easy and yummy!

Much easier to mix the Parmesan with the bread crumbs ( for extra crunch,use half panko crumbs and half seasoned Italian crumbs) Then dip the chicken in Italian dressing.  Finally mix equal parts of mayo and sour cream and roll the chicken in it. Do all of this early in the day and refrigerate the chicken until you are ready to bake it. The crumbs will stay on better, and the salad dressing adds extra flavor.

Wonderful the 1st time. No, OUTSTANDING! However, i'm getting ready to make this again, but will be adding rosemary, thyme, & oregano. I'll also mix 2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard in with the mayo. I'll also be placing the chicken on a wire rack over a foil-lined baking sheet. Serving with Rosemary/Asiago Cheese Bread, and Grandma's Green Bean Casserole from this site (replacing the cheddar cheese with provolone slices).

Excellent recipe. My only change was to take boneless chicken breasts and slice them in half, then dredge them in the coating.  Everything else is perfect!  A very good meal with many possibilities for side dishes.  Easy and even the kids inhaled it ALL! Seriously...they ate every last bit and they are p-i-c-k-y.......
Served with saute'd asparagus and a salad,scalloped potatoes,corn, whatever... very nice.  

Keep in mind the coating is thick; Don't let that frustrate you.  Smear it all over then shake it in the breadcrumbs. Also, depending on how thick the chicken breasts are, the cooking time may go up to 35-40 minutes but it's worth it. 5 Stars absolutely.

This was not terrible, nor was it delicious.  I found that I prefer the recipe from this site that is basically the same, but uses butter instead of mayo.  Easier to dip & coat the chicken, better flavor, and better crisping.  Since this recipe has so many outstanding reviews, I have to believe this one is just a matter of personal taste.  Thank you!

I brushed the chicken with olive oil instead of mayo. Then i spiced with garlic powder and rolled in flakes of instant mashed potato. A little drizzle of honey added a nice browning when it was near done. The chicken was absolutely delicious.

This chicken is incredible. I had to sub some ingredients; I had no bread crumbs so I used crushed potato chips and mixed in Italian seasoning.  I also was out of mayo, so instead I used french dressing.  It was so moist and delicious. I will be making this again.

This was an excellent baked chicken recipe!  Even my two year old son ate it all.  There were a few things that I did, that made a difference I believe... The chicken breasts that I had were very thick, so I split them in half and pounded them down a bit.  It seemed while eating the thinner parts were the best!  I also baked them on a cookie sheet for 15 minutes, then flipped them and baked for another 5.  They were crispy and delicious!  Definitely going to be made often in our house!

Delicious Recipe!  I added a few things - onion powder, some fresh grated gruyere cheese... you could really add whatever you want to this!    I did not halve my chicken breasts, so I cooked 2 whole chicken breasts at 425 for 30 minutes. Probably could have done 27 mins?  It was still really moist, but could have been more so.  Everyone's oven is different so just check it around then!    Great recipe, super quick and easy, absolutely worth it!!!

I just eyeballed the ingredients for the coating.  I also added some oregano and paprika.  Chicken was very juicy.  I sliced up the leftovers and served in tortillas with some mayo mixed up like the coating and bacon and cheese.  We will have this again!

Great recipe that is easy to make.  I substituted the mayo for light Miracle Whip, which made it a little zingier.  I have also tried it with Carb Selections Ranch Dressing.  Either way, moist, tender and tastes great!

Quick and easy to make! Good flavour even with minimal ingredients. I substituted Italian dressing for the mayo, as I find mayo to be too rich sometimes.

Best baked chicken recipe I've come across. I'm known to serve dry over baked chicken at dinner and I have yet to ruin this! Lol I made accordingly to recipe but I now use Greek yogurt in place of mayo. You can't tell the difference in the end!!

This chicken recipe was good but quite bland.  Our family feels it needs more flavor so I will play with the spices next time.  Overall it was good and very moist.  Neither the mayonnaise nor the parmesan where detectable, so if you have people who don't like mayo as we do, it shouldn't be a problem.  After reading reviews, I made two changes to the recipe based on recommendations. I used a wire rack on a baking sheet and also used crushed croutons instead of bread crumbs.  Both of those were great suggestions.  Even with the croutons the flavor was still just okay.  If you like basic chicken, this is a good recipe.  However, if you like something with a lot of flavor, I would suggest adding your favorite spices.

This was really good.  I used lowfat mayo and only two chicken breasts and pounded them flat (maybe I pounded them too much because they were falling apart a little as I put them in the mayo/cheese mixture).  I had just barely enough of the mayo/cheese mixture.  I also found it somewhat difficult to get the mayo/cheese to stick to the chicken.  It really wants to stick to your hands!  Next time, I will mix the cheese and the garlic powder and then mix in the mayo.  Otherwise, I think it's hard to tell if the garlic powder is mixed in well.  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and put the chicken on a rack when baking and turned them over at the last 5 minutes.  I also put some foil in the pain -- which I would say is a necessity to avoid lots of scrubbing when cleaning up.

This recipe is fabulous as is.  I always try recipes on this site as they are listed first and then make modifications later.  I haven't had to change this one.  My family loves it and I have a family of picky eaters.  The mayo is a nice addition too because it makes the breading crispy.

I'm making this again tonight at the request of my wife.  We've made this many times already and its fantastic!  We usually cut up the chicken into small pieces for a wrap with lettuce, tomato, feta cheese, and some creamy greek dressing.  It really is great, thank you for the recipe!

Loved it delicious and moist and I also cooked it on a wire rack so I could keep turning it and keeping it crunchy ....  I adapted it with 75ml Mayonnaise and 15ml Dijon Mustard with sprinkling of dried chilli peppers and wow ........

My family of three children, ages 11, 13 & 17 and darling husband, are all very picky eaters.  I have to share that I knew my family would not like this recipe using Mayo (they eat no condiments of any kind).  So I substituted the Mayo with sour cream as another reviewer suggested.  All three of my kids gave this chicken a 5 star!! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I marinated in ranch dressing instead of using mayo, as others suggested. I also added a sprinkle of salt and pepper to the crumb mixture. Delicious! I only wish I would have made more!

I rated 4 stars because I added a little garlic powder and crushed parsley to the mayo and cheese mix. I cooked in a glass baking dish.  Next time I will take the advice and cook on a rack over a cookie sheet.  It was really good and my hubby liked it too.  He says it's a keeper!!!

I have not made this recipe yet but I think that using Renee's Caeser Dressing instead of mayo would be more advantageous. It would be like the GarPar wings coating that is very popular. Will make tonite and update!

Very easy and moist chicken. My halved chicken breasts only needed about 18 minutes in the oven. Great with pasta and sauce!

Simple and so very tasty.  Yes I did add some seasoning.  I used a knife to spread the mayo mixture on the chicken, put in the bread crumbs and spread the other side with mayo, turned over in the bread crumbs.  Put on a rack above the baking sheet.  was wonderful!  Kids had seconds!

Didn't have Mayo, used Miracle Whip instead. Also used white bread crumbs and added my own seasonings. Cut the chicken up into "fingers". Everyone including young grandkids liked it.

Super yummy and easy! I used Miracle Whip, it was all I had, and cut the amount down to about 1/3 cup instead of the suggested 3/4. The Miracle Whip gave the chicken a sweeter flavor that even my toddler loved.

My husband said this was the best meal I ever made him.   I don't know if I should be pleased or insulted I've been cooking for him for over 10 years.    The kids 7 and twin 3 year old loved it too.  It was sooo moist for baked chicken.  This is definitely on the meal rotation and will recommend to anyone.  Super easy and delicious

Super easy to prepare with hardly any effort necessary. It came out even better than we had hoped. The chicken comes out very moist and tender. This has become a favorite. We didn't substitute or change anything, just followed the easy instructions.

Moist and flavorful although I could have gotten away with less mayonnaise, 1/2 cup would have been plenty but keep other measurements the same. I did use panko breadcrumbs just to try something different. I did some as chicken strips and they were very tasty and cooked in the amount of time called for but the rest of the chicken I kept as the breast didn't cook in the same amount of time.

Delicious and tender! Instead of using actual italian breadcrumbs, I made my own reduced sodium alternative with plain breadcrumbs mixed with some Italian seasoning. I also used a little extra parmesan. Came out crispy, tender, and packed with flavour. Served with Basmati rice and grilled asparagus. One of my new favourite meals!

Delicious! I couldn't believe all the flavor and it was so juicy. I tried it with Dijonaise instead of mayo as one reviewer suggested and it was wonderful. I cooked mine a little longer than the recommended 20 minutes. I'm sure the chicken was fully cooked but I wanted the coating to get a little crispier. We will be making this many more times - so quick and easy!

Very good, I put the mayo, seasonings, cheese and panko only on the top, baked, finished off under the broiler and it prevented my usual problem of the breading falling off.  Thanks for this one, very versatile for future use!

I made this last night and it went awry, Mine got all stuck to the foil, which I had sprayed with PAM. My kids didn't like it and it took MUCH longer than 20 minutes for the bread crumbs to brown up. I think we're done with this one.

This is a pretty standard recipe and I've seen it many times. It does make for moist chicken, but high in fat content due to the mayo. You can sustitute many other things in it's place and even change up the choice of meats. I prefer mine extra crispy so I would tend to use panko here instead of breadcrumbs.

My bread crumbs did not "solidify" in the 20 min baking time.  I was afraid to over-bake because I hate tough chicken.  The flavor was delicious though!  Might try a different bread coating next time, like the croutons someone else suggested.

Now have to make this recipe because everyone in my family loves it. Very good, tender chicken. I use panko crumbs instead of Italian crumbs for a different, crunchy texture. Delicious!

i followed the directions, and it came out pretty soggy and gooey on one side of the chicken. This might be better fried instead of baked!

I found a recipe similar to this about 20 years ago and wanted to try this one. I had to add more mayonnaise and a little milk to thin out the mixture because of the amount of Parmesan cheese, (next time I will use 1/4 cup) it was a good recipe. I use chicken tenders or cut up breasts into bite size pieces for my kids.  If you are in a hurry and don't mind the fat, I have even fried these in olive or canola oil for my kids. They love them both ways.

The only things I added were italian seasoning and a dash of salt and pepper and this was SOOO good!!  My husband and I seriously couldn't stop eating it lol.  Very moist.  I did use "thinly sliced" chicken breasts which worked very well for this I thought.  Also put it on a rack on a cookie sheet like others suggested and that worked well, also.  Easy and yummy, no brainer.  Definitely making this in the future.

Loved it.  I did use Johnny's Garlic Spread powder and I used more than in the recipe, but I love garlic.  I also used more Parmesan cheese.  Even leftovers the next day were delicious.

Quick and Easy but a bit on the plain side.  This chicken could use a sauce to liven it up a bit.

Was simple and tasty! Like a few others noted I also added some extra spices that I just like with chicken but that should be a given whenever you make a chicken coating dish. Great base for sure, loved it!

This was great! I followed the recipe exactly (using homemade bread for bread crumbs and seasoning with Italian seasoning). It didn't taste like mayonnaise at all, but was very good. You've got to make it on a wire rack, though. Otherwise it's soggy. On the rack it was actually crispy, and I have never been able to get chicken crispy without broiling before! It had decent flavor, but could have used a little more. I might make a dipping sauce for it next time. Still a great, easy meal :) And my super picky children who currently aren't even eating regular chicken nuggets loved this!

This was my best baked chicken ever.  I did change a few things. I added bay seasoning to the chicken. I didn't have any mayo so I used EVOO instead.  Used Romano cheese bc that's all I had. Mixed panko crumbs with seasoned bread crumbs. It was a hit!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Was in a hurry and mixed cheese with bread crumbs but was very good anyway. Don't think it mattered since everyone agreed it was a keeper.

Super easy and really tasty.  It's plenty good just as written.  I like to add just a smidge of olive oil, lemon juice, and Italian seasoning to the mayo mix.  I baked it on a wire rack and mine needed an extra five minutes for doneness.   Thanks for sharing, it's a keeper.

This tasted really good, but I really wish I'd read the reviews warning me to bake this on a rack. It came out lovely and crispy on top, icky and soggy on the bottom. Instead of serving them in this less-than-aesthetically-pleasing state, I put them in a casserole with some of my Italian mother-in-law's fabulous homemade pasta sauce and some shredded cheese and made chicken parmesan.

Oh, my goodness, this was sooo yummy!! I admit I was skeptical about the mixture of ingredients but I went and did it anyway because A- I like trying new things, and B- I REALLY need to go grocery shopping but I still had all the ingredients on hand! It came out so good, moist and delicious! I added a bit of red pepper flakes to mine for a little kick but it would've been just fine without it, possibly even better! I also used drumsticks instead- Tasty!

I am re-writing my review of this chicken.  Before, I said that it is now my familie's favorite chicken recipe.  But, now if I don't make it for a few weeks, my family craves it and say's when are we having Italian chicken again?  THANK YOU!!

This was very easy.  This recipe uses ingredients I always seem to have on hand which was great.  My kids liked it a lot.  I would definitely make this again.  It's a nice change from the same old chicken cutlets.  Thank you for sharing.

This is the best recipe I've found for Baked Chicken, hands down.  I made some changes to make it this good:  Crushed croutons vs. bread crumbs, added Italian Seasoning to Mayo/Parm mix, and baked on a wire rack.   I promise you will love this!

This was really easy and the chicken turned out very very moist.  This is a five star recipe for me with this change. Reduced the parmesan cheese to 1/4 cup and that was just right for my taste.  As suggested by a reviewer, I baked the chicken on a rack so it wasn't soggy on the bottom.  Turned chicken over after 10 minutes.  Also, prepped the chicken by pounding and making it an even thickness.  Thanks for this one.  It's a keeper.

Sooo good! Some of the other reviewers didn't give it a five because of spices, and I think thats just silly. Everyone has there own spice preferences. I did add extra spice, but I bet it still would have been wonderful if I hadn't. I used tenderloins because thats what I had on hand. They were great, my only regret is that I didn't make more! Great recipe!

This is really good. Dipping the chicken into the mayo/parm. cheese mixture didn't work for me,(it didn't stick) so I just spread it on with a knife. Very tender and moist. THX

This is the second time I made this recipe.  The first time I made it as exactly as the recipe said.  It definatly needed at bit of spice so tonight when I made them again I added garlic powder, basil, onion powder, paprika and pepper to the bread crumbs and that made the five stars in our house.  Everyone came back for seconds.

This has to be my most favorite chicken recipe. I don't measure the ingredients--just mix together some mayo, parmesean cheese, garlic, pepper, and maybe some Cavender's Greek seasoning. Coat the chicken, dip in cracker crumbs, and bake. WOW! I'd give it 10 stars if I could!

This chicken was so good and tender. The flavor is awesome! The only change I made was to add some additional garlic, salt and pepper to the italian bread crumbs.

Very tasty recipe! I flipped the chicken over a little more than half way through and a lot of the breading cane off of the bottom side. After the chicken cooked through, I put it under the broiler a few mins each side to crisp up the breading, and that did exactly what I needed!

I made this tonight for dinner. I did follow the recipe for the most part, but did a couple things differently, at least they weren't mentioned in the recipe. I pounded the chicken breasts to about 3/4" thickness between two pieces of plastic wrap so they would cook evenly. Instead of adding individual Italian seasonings, I just add an Italian seasoning that had all the spices to both the bread crumbs and the mayonnaise mix. I also added parsley to the bread crumbs for color. I mixed 50/50 of the Italian seasoned bread crumbs and Panko  bread crumbs, but it would also have been good with just the Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Although I did bake the chicken on a wire rack and turned them the last 10 minutes, they were still not crispy. The chicken was moist and tender, but not at all crispy. I believe the reason for this is that dipping the breasts in the mayonnaise mixture can put a layer of the mixture that is too thick and prevents the bread crumbs from getting crispy. Next time, I will try spreading a thin layer of the mayo mix on the chicken.  Although the breading wasn't crispy, the dish was very good. This chicken recipe would be excellent for making chicken Parmesan.  Just add hot pasta sauce and mozzarella cheese after baking the chicken and leave in the oven until the cheese melts.

These taste like the cutlets Nonna used to make!  I pounded chicken breasts to be more like cutlets.
I followed this recipe and took some advice from other reviewers.  I added some Italian herbs, and I baked the chicken on a rack over a sheet pan.   Absolutely delicious, and will become a staple when in the mood for cutlets.

Family of four loved these e-z to make chicken tenders!  They are fresh, crunchy, flavorful, moist, and baked.  We were out of bread crumbs so I substituted whole wheat crushed crackers - all of us wanted seconds.  My 12-year old begged me to keep this recipe!

Delicious! I will be making this again. I did use a frying rack for that all over crispness. I used olive oil infused mayo, and if you use the proper Italian bread crumbs, you do not need extra spices unless you prefer to add some heat (peppers)

We thought the chicken was very dry. Probably my fault. I pounded the chicken to a quarter inch thickness. Maybe if I had kept them whole they wouldn't have gotten so dry

It was good, but not great. Chicken came out tender and perfect, and the coating/crust was good, but overall the chicken itself needed more flavor. I might try this with smaller tenders next time instead of large breasts, and see if they are more flavorful (being thinner).

Thought the flavor of this chicken was very good.  I made my own seasoned coating, using Panko bread crumbs and Italian seasonings.  Next time if not using chicken tenders, I'll tenderize the breasts, especially if they happen to be larger than average size.  Will also follow Katherine Parton's recommendation to cook the chicken on a wire rack and flip it for the final five minutes of cook time.

I actually cut up one of the breasts so they were chicken fingers. it went over huge for my 7, 5 and 3 year old. The kids loved them and my husband did as well. it was so quick.

The chicken did not come out crispy. It was mushy on the bottom of the chicken. I used a rack like the video suggested. I will not be making this again.

Delicious!!!!  Mayo cheese sauce was perfect.  I used Italian seasoned panco and it was soooo good!  Lots of compliments from friends and family.  I did take the suggestion of spraying the chicken with an olive oil spray to give it that golden color.  This is a new favorite for our family.

This is now my go-to chicken recipe.  It is a snap to make, and is by far the most tender, most juicy chicken I've ever eaten.  My family loves it.  But better yet, my daycare kiddos love it, and they are unbelievably picky.  Five stars for me!  That said, if you are looking for a heavily seasoned flavor, you will want to add seasonings.  I personally don't find that necessary.  Yum! Smells so good while cooking!

This chicken was delicious. My only issue was that the flavor was a bit mild. The next time I make it, I will add more spice like salt, pepper, oregano and maybe even parsley. The texture of this chicken comes out so soft and yummy though. I will make it this way again.

I make this recipe time and time again and never fails.  I like to used seasoned panko crumbs for extra crunch and maybe a touch more parm than called for but it's a great dinner. Mayo and parm and seasonings great spread on halved potatoes and baked in the oven with your chicken!

Tender Italian Baked Chicken Haiku: "Soggy and tasteless. But I didn't read reviews, that added so much." I made the recipe just as it's written, and the end result was moist, but moist verging on goopy. The "breading" slippery-slid right off, and I was left w/ tasteless blobs and tasteless chicken. Sorry for the negative rating but having scanned back thru other reviews, I see lots of tweaks that folks did.

I've been cooking chicken with your recipe for at least a year. It's perfect everytime. My family prefers the thinner chicken as if it's been pounded. I prefer pounded, but pounding is loud and messy. Instead, I use a super sharp long meat knife. I turn the breast so that the "pretty" side is up. I begin my slice through the meat on the thick side, holding the meat down on the cutting board an precisely slicing through the meat following my hand's pressure. I've never been cut. As long as you have a very sharp knife there would be no reason for the knife to accidentally come through the top and slice your hand, unless of course, you're not watching. I usually slice an average chicken breast into 3 long cutlets. Because they're thinner, you can add less of the "crust". I bake at 425 as directed, for 17-20 minutes depending on if I'm cooking for tonight's meal or to be warmed in the toaster oven on another day. If I'm baking them for another day, I be sure to completely cool the crispy chicken on a cooling rack and then since I don't have a cooling rack small enough for a covered dish, I just put a paper towel down, setting the chicken on it. It's a little gummy on the bottom when you take it out, but it will crisp up nicely if you're careful not to scrape off the crust when removing it from the paper towel. Thanks for the great recipe. My family & I enjoy it. I like it particularly for the fact I can make a family size chicken breast package and use extra chicken for leftovers

Loved It! I substituted the mayo for egg and added some thoroughly crushed cornflakes to the breadcrumbs like my grandma used to! Had a few huge breast lol (No Pun Intended) so more like 30mins-45 in the oven.. Great Recipe to use for Chicken Parm

Just tried this, was looking for an alternative to frying chicken cutlets. 
Turned out GREAT! enough leftovers for a sandwich the day after. My kids were allover it (Finger licking good daddy!). Instead of grated parmiggiano, I used my dad's home grown/made grated romano cheese, and I added Italian seasoning to the mayo mix. 
I gave the suggestion to mom for my dad's diet (beats frying!).

Quick, easy, and delicious. I used Italian seasoned panko instead of breadcrumbs, but I'm sure it didn't change the outcome. Chicken was moist and full of flavor. It's a keeper. Thank you for this amazing recipe!

This is a keeper!  Even my pickiest eaters loved it. I didn't have Italian bread crumbs, so I just added Italian seasonings to plain bread crumbs. I used chicken strips instead of breasts with the same delicious results. Next time I plan on placing the chicken on a cookie cooking rack on the backing sheet so both sides of the chicken come out golden brown and chicken doesn't pool in its juices.

i made it just as it's called for, but with chicken tenders. i also changed the cooking time and heat. i put it in the over for 30mins on 350° in a deep baking dish covered with foil. then after i peeled the foil off and let it go for another 10mins. it turned out excellent. not a scrap left in the house. put it with garlic and oil vermicelli and green beans. so yummy. i will be making this again.

such a great recipe...i loved it! and i followed the other reviews where you're suppose to flip the chicken for 5 minutes.

definitely coat the cookie sheet with cooking spray though! or aluminum foil the cookie sheet. i ruined my pan trying to get the bread crumbs off...:(

Loved this as a base recipe. I'm guilty of tweaking a few things, such as using chicken tenders instead of breasts. I also added some fresh basil, garlic salt, and fresh pepper to my mayo mix. I cooked some angel hair pasta and mixed that with pesto dressing then cut the chicken up on top. My husband loved this so much he ate every chicken tender but the one I had managed to get on my plate. I also loved how juicy the mayo made the chicken, very innovative.

I just made this tonight, my son went back for seconds, and he's a very picky eater! Instead of using mayo I used sun-dried tomato dressing. I did cook it for longer, but I've had salmonella before and I can be a little obsessive with making sure the chicken is thoroughly cooked. We all loved it!

4 stars for easy prep and chicken was moist. Didn't have a wire rack, so just put the mayo, cheese, bread crumbs on top of the breasts. They browned up nicely, but the topping was so dry. I may try this again, mixing the mayo, cheese, bread crumbs together.

I have made this recipe many times for my family and found it works very well with light mayonnaise and is awful with real mayonnaise.  This is because real mayo separates and the dish gets very greasy while light mayo holds up and is delicious.  Thus 3 stars.

This was a waste. I don't understand the point in using mayo. It made the breadcrumbs soggy. After 20 minutes, there was no browning but the meat was cooked through. Had to put it under the broiler to get the bread crispy. So the top had some crunch but the bottom was just a sloppy mess of sogginess. Flavor-wise, it was nothing special. There are much better recipes out there that are also more healthy.

I found no problem in using mayo as the base for this as one of the reviewers cautioned against. In fact, Hellman's has their own recipe much like this one. I found it came out nice and juicy, with just the right amount of crisp.

I followed the advice of others--cooked chicken on a rack and flipped it when it had about 5 mins left. Other than that, didn't change a thing. Very good!

Very good.  I added two minced cloves of garlic to the mayo mixture, but felt it still could have used more flavor.  Maybe some oregano next time?  It was very moist, and the proportions worked for 6 breast halves.  I will definitely try 
again.

This mixture for the coating? It's AMAZING.

Now I ran out of mayo when I made it, so I ended up thinning it with milk and using it more like a traditional egg-wash. But it still tasted incredible! I also had enormous, bone-in chicken breasts; just adjust your time to get the meat cooked through. The breading gets nice and crispy and golden brown.

Another review mentioned that the mayo would get all runny - I didn't find that to be the case, in fact the pan was much less greasy than I expected. The meat was tender and juicy and the crust was just enough crunchy!

I have made this recipe many times and we LOVE it!  The only difference is that I don't 'coat' the chicken with the mayonnaise mixture, but simply spoon some in top of the chicken, making sure to cover all.  We find that coating the backside too, is just too much.
EXCELLENT quick and tasty meal - thank you!

This is a staple in our house, as even my chicken-hating son loves it. A rare meal that all 5 of us like. I use the flash-frozen chicken tenderloins that I defrost... usually 8 of them. I tend to not use quite as much mayo, as I always have some left and hate throwing it out (as it is contaminated by the raw chicken). Also, I don't end up using that much bread crumbs either - I usually start with some at the bottom of a shallow bowl and then add if needed.

I made this with chicken fingers instead and had it with spagetti and homemade spagetti sauce. My husband loved it. Of course I had to change the cooking time a bit. I took the chicken out with 5 minutes left and put mozzarella cheese on top then put it back in the oven for its last 5 minutes.

This is a good recipe, and the chicken was quite moist.  But I didn't like that the bottom of the chicken was soggy.  Next time I will cook the chicken on a wire rack and flip it half way or so.

quick, easy and yummy.  What more could a mom ask??  ;)  I didn't have Italian seasoned bread crumbs, so I just added Italian seasoning to plain bread crumbs.  Easy peasy.

My husband loved it and I liked it alright. It was too salty for some reason in my opinion, maybe it was the type of garlic powder I used (lowerys). I'm not sure. I used the italian seasoned progresso panko crumbs too.  It was nice and tender though. I will try it again only I will use less garlic powder and a different kind. Nice and easy and I like that a lot!

I save my 4 and 5 stars for completely awesome dishes.  This dish was tasty, quick and easy to prepare and kid approved.  I was actually hoping that the kids wouldn't eat theirs so we could have leftovers ;-)

Pretty good....I think I over cooked it  a bit so it was a little dry. I used low fat mayo, pecorino romano cheese, and whole wheat seasoned crumbs. Will try again. Thanks for an easy and tasty dinner.

I made this using Miracle Whip, my hubby's favorite and italian panko bread crumbs.  Turned out crunchy on the outside and moist chicken inside. 19 year old son asked for it again this week and said "it's a keeper Mom". Easy,but tasty and moist chicken dish!

Tried this tonight. Smelled so good in the oven, and tasted wonderful. Will definitely be making this again. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because the bottom was a little soggy. But that's it...very good recipe!

I can honestly say this recipe is a huge success.  My husband is very old fashioned and does not like to try anything different enjoyed it. I used stove top stuffing mix and it was so good.  Thank you for the recipe. I rate it top stars or more.

this recipe was just ok, I accidentally coated with too much mayo so some did not come out that crispy.  I was still tasty but not exactly what I expected.

I would have given this 5 stars but the bottom of the chicken does turn up soggy like some of the other reviewers have said. I even flipped them after 15 minutes. To save on calories, we used light mayo.

The flavor of this dish is great, but just a quick warning about applying mayo. I spread the breast fillets with light, olive oil mayo mixed with tangy mustard. I did not dip them to save fat and calories. I used panko crumbs as suggested by other reviewers. I baked on a rack. The chicken did not brown either on the top or the bottom, and stuck terribly to the rack. This recipe must require lots of full fat mayo in order to crisp up as I can't think of any other reason that it didn't turn out. I won't make it as suggested in the recipe as it is way too high in calories and fat for my husband and me. That doesn't make it a bad recipe by any means, just not good for our diets.

Easy and tasty.  I added some Italian seasoning to the mayo mixture (and some extra garlic because we like it).  I also cut the breasts into strips.  I was afraid my son wouldn't like it due to the mayo, but he enjoyed them.

Okay. The mayo mixture didn't stick to the chicken very good and I had to scoop it with my hands and place on top of chicken then sprinkle bread crumbs on the top. And the chicken wasn't very moist either.

I'm always looking for new chicken recipe's because my husband is a "where's the beef" guy.  Read reviews and tried it last night.  It was delicious.  I used mayonnaise, but thinned it a little with fat free yogurt that I use for a quiche recipe.  I had onion/garlic croutons so I crunched those into crumbs and added some Italian seasoning, dried parsley and garlic pepper.  Only had 2 chicken breast halves so I cut the wet ingredients by more than half and it was plenty, just using a brush to coat.  I baked it a little longer, but at 375 and turned it when I thought it was half done.  Very juicy and tasty.  Had been using French's Fried Onions crushed for coating, but this was even better.  It's a keeper!

Very tasty! Definitely add spices to the breadcrumbs or it will be bland.. I really like the idea of dredging chicken in the mayo/parm cheese mixture before coating with breadcrumb mixture... it adds to the flavor. I used the Olive Oil Mayo.  It's really messy though.. so be prepared to get your hands coated in the mayo!!

Simple and easy to make from things you probably already have on hand. Also fills the Shake and Bake craving perfectly, just not special enough for entertaining or worth talking about over the watercooler.

Very moist & tender & easy to make! Will be saving this to make in the future. We love garlic so added slightly more than the amount listed. I also used regular skinless, boneless chicken breasts rather than chicken breast halves. Next time the only thing I will add is pepper to "season" things up a bit more.

The chicken was very moist and delicious, but it took longer than 10 min. prep time...  otherwise, no other problem with the recipe.

Gonna be honest here.  If you don't have Shake n Bake go for it.  Otherwise I like Shake n Bake best for oven chicken.

I was making dinner for the family which can be hard because everyone has completely different tastes.  I'm vegetarian but the rest of my family isn't.  So I trusted the reviews and went with it!  I also used sour cream instead of mayo because that's what I had in the fridge!  Everyone really loved it which is hard to do! I will definitely use this one again!

Thank you for this easy and WONDERFUL recipe!
I added some sun-dried tomato & basil seasoning to the mayo and also cracked some Italian seasonings into the breadcrumb mixture. Quick and yummy.
*Note: if you want your chicken crispy, be sure to turn on the broiler for the last few minutes.

this was excellent, i made some changes to cut down on fat.  i added fat free milk to the mayonnaise to thin it out and make it easier to coat and i use 1/4 cups of romano cheese.  it was so good i made it twice in the same week!

This was a big hit with my husband and 4yo son.  Made as written except added milk to mayo mixture to make it easier to dip.  I used about 1 1/2 lbs chix tenders instead of breasts and there was more than enough sauce to coat.  Next time will reduce by half but keep the bread crumbs the same.

Oh this is such a yummy way to prepare chicken.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect, crispy on the outside and very tender inside.  For this recipe I cut my chicken breast halves into 2 or 3 smaller lenghwise sections and it turned out great!  Thanks, I will absolutely make this again!

I loved this recipe! I signed up just to rate it. The chicken came out moist and flavorful. The crust was crispy and delicious. I will be making this again. I used chicken breast tenderloins instead of breasts. It turned out amazing!

My first review.  It was easy to make.  To me it tasted a little salty and I don't know it just had kinda an aftertaste to it.  My kids did not like it. It was very tender and not real crusty. I did cook it on a rack over a cookie sheet like others recommended.  I will not be making it again, mainly cause my kids did not like it and that is who I'm cooking for. They prefer a more plain battered chicken strip with more of a crust.

Absolutely awesome!  It appeases chicken lovers and those who may not really care for chicken.  It tastes just as good, if not better than fried chicken!  I also tried this recipe with a non-breaded vegetarian fake chicken patty and it worked out very well!  The only change i make to the recipe was to use Italian style Panko bread crumbs, instead of regular bread crumbs.  Makes it extra crispy!  Also, I added a tablespoon of dijon mustard to the mayonnaise to add a little more flavor.  This one is definitely a keeper!

This was awesome!  The thing out of our mouths was OH MY GOD!  we definitely will be making this again.  its so simple, and like another reviewer, i desparately need to grocery shop and i had all the ingredients on hand.  I added a little bit of oregano and italian seasoning to the mix.  instead of breadcrumbs, we crumbled up cesar croutons (bc we didnt have the bread crumbs) and it is just superb!

My husband hates mayonnaise so I didn't tell him the ingredients until after he ate it. He loved it, as did the rest of my family...even my picky kids. I followed the recipe exactly except I baked it on a rack. I will definitely make this recipe again.

It was a little hard to coat the chicken but I managed, and I thought the mayo would be kinda gross, but it actually turned out pretty amazing.  I am definately making it again. :)

My husband and I enjoyed this delicious dish tonight with a Greek salad, homemade potato salad and hot, crusty mini Italian loaves.  Our chicken breasts were large.  They had to be baked for 40 minutes.  They turned out moist.  I used Hellman's Olive Oil mayonaise; half the calories.

Very good taste. I added additional spices to the mayo mix and also to the bread crumbs. Used basil, thyme, and paprika in the mayo, with some garlic, oregano, and more basil, thyme, and paprika in the crumbs. The only reason I gave this four stars is because it was a soggy mess on the bottom. I even flipped the pieces over halfway through cooking time. Next time I will take the advice of another reviewer and bake on a metal rack.

Such a good and easy recipe!  I needed something for dinner without going to the store and found this!  It was very good.  I did add some more spices as others suggested: parsley, thyme, and orageno.  I also flipped the breasts at the end so the other side could crisp as well!

Excellent! I flipped mine over half way through cooking so they were nicely browned on both sides. Also helps to pound the breast out, especially if they're large so they cook more evenly and are tender. I also sprinkled the breasts with a seasoning blend before breading. This ones a keeper!

Chicken turned out both moist and tender.  I thought the mayo left a distinct taste  -  have prepared a very similar recipe using butter in place of the mayo and a bit of lemon juice which I liked much better.

This is our go-to chicken recipe.  I don't dip the chicken, I just spread the mayo mixo on top and sprinkle with the bread crumbs.  So juicy and delicious!

My husband and son-in-law thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  My husband said it tasted like fried chicken, but only better.  Will definitely put this recipe with my keepers!

This is a GREAT recipe! I have made this dish twice and both times it was awesome. I followed the recipe to the letter. (not that hard considering the amount of ingredients) Wonderful and quick.

The taste was great, and the chicken did turn out moist.  It was somewhat messy to prepare, however. I really had to dunk the pieces into the mayo/cheese mixture to get it adequately coated, and it took a bit of doing to get the crumbs to stick evenly.  I sprayed the pan with non-stick cooking spray to ensure the chicken could be removed easily without losing the coating, and I baked it for 20 minutes on the first side, then 25 minutes on the second side, to get the coating crispy.

Great recipe that turns out moist chicken. I made one substitution: Miracle Whip for Mayo and it was AWESOME! Per one other suggestion, I broiled for a few minutes at the end and cooked the chicken for 30 minutes. I think thin breasts (cutlets?) would MAKE this recipe, so I'll do that next time.

Seriously good and simple - I cut mine into tenders, used fat-free mayo, and made some with using plain breadcrumbs and taco seasoning for wraps & salad the next day - yum! I used a wire rack as suggested in other reviews, they turned out moist and crispy.

Didn't change a thing. Loved it! This was so easy to make and goes with just about anything. I was skeptical about the mayo at first, b/c I don't like the taste, but you really can't tell once it's been cooked. So don't be scared off by that. :)

Awesome recipe. How can you go wrong with bread crumbs and mayo! I too added additional spices to the mayo/cheese mixture and cooked the chicken on a rack! I plan to make this recipe for years to come! YUM!

Loved this tender, moist baked chicken.  I did make a couple of changes, but did not stray from the recipe too much-plain panko breadcrumbs, and because I used plain breadcrumbs, I seasoned the mayonnaise with some Italian seasoning.  The chicken took several more minutes to cook than the recipe stated, but it was really good.

I just made this and it was delicious!! I just eye balled the measurements, I didnt want to dirty more things then necessary. I did use italian season in the mayo mixture as well as italian bread crumbs. I baked on a rack, 15 min on one side, then flipped it over, cooked another 5 minutes, then broiled on hi for about 3-4  minutes to get the coating a little crispy. There were no left-overs. Will definetly be making this more often. I served it with garlic bread. Yummy combo!

This was only fair. The Parmesan cheese made the coating salty, but not very flavorful. As others noted, this needs some additional seasoning.

I was skeptical of this recipe thinking I would be tasting mayo which I don't particularly care for but I was wrong. This chicken is tasty and moist and so easy to prepare! A little messy but breading things usually are that way. Loved it and thank you!

Well after reading all the ratings, I made this my own way.  I marinated chicken breasts in italian dressing for 1 hours, then I coated them with bread crumbs (half italian crumbs and half panko).  Then I drizzled italian dressing and butter and baked.  It was awesome, loved it! I will definitely make again and again.

Best chicken dish ever.  I did find that using thin cuts of chicken or chicken strips kept the chicken moist.  Thick breasts seemed to dry out on me.  My family loves it and it's definitely something I've cooked over and over again.  Highly recommend!

The flavor of this chicken was good. I, however, had a hard time getting the mayonnaise mixture to stick to the chicken. It was quite messy, but I will probably make this again sometime.

This was great, even my boyfriend's picky two year old loved them.  

I did make a couple of minor changes, I eyeballed the mayo, parm & garlic amounts as well as added an equal amount of onion powder and a few dashes of salt & pepper.  Plus I added a touch more Italian Seasoning to the Italian Breadcrumbs I had at home.  Baked for 15 minutes, turned and baked under the broiler for another 5.  Turned out crispy and great.  The trick to making these crispy I think is turning them at least once.

This recipe was great... I used what I had in the kitchen: instead of grated Parmesan I used 1 pk of Italian dressing mix... added crushed black pepper to the bread crumbs (per some reviews)...and I doubled the recipe, using half skinless boneless/half bone-in with skin and it still turned out delicious...I did bake it for a tad longer (30 min) and sprayed cooking spray on foil for easy clean up... I will make this again for sure!

Enjoyed this recipe, maybe even 4 1/2 stars worth.  Instead of the bread-crumbs, I gave some left-over croutons a quick "whir" in the food-processor.  Rest I followed to the letter.  My husband, who generally prefers dark meat to white, said it was good and juicy.  Next time I might play around with this -- good starter for chicken parm. or perhaps some salsa and shredded 'jack added during the last few minutes of bake-time.... yum!  In any case, thanks for a good recipe!

Sorry, I know I'm in the minority here, but I didn't like this at all. I followed the recipe, except used Miracle Whip instead of mayo. I thought it lacked flavor and overall just tasted kind of icky. It would be good as a base for chick parm, but I'd never make it again this way.

If you are looking for a relatively easy, satisfying chicken dinner, then look no further. Not necessarily the healthiest but I plan on trying it with fat-free mayonnaise in the future. Family loved it. Will definitely make again!

Excellent recipe!  I sometimes have trouble getting my kids to eat anything other than chicken patties or chicken nuggets and they ask for seconds with this one.  I took advice of another and broiled for 5 minutes at the end and instead of using 3/4 cup bread crumbs I used 1/2 c bread crumbs and 1/4 c panko crumbs.  I put a little extra garlic in with the mixture too and also added in some dried oregano and basil

We have made this recipe at least a dozen times in the past few months!  The only change we make is to use Light Miracle Whip in place of the mayonnaise, due to personal preference, and it always turns out fork tender, moist, and delicious with whatever chicken we decide to use(breasts, thighs, bone-in, etc.)!  It is an extremely quick and easy recipe to prepare, which makes it a plus for us.  All three of our picky eaters get excited when they know we're having this for dinner, and there are NEVER any leftovers!  Can't give it much more praise than that!  Thanks so much for a terrific recipe!

Quick and easy, very moist. My 2 year old loved it too. I used chicken breast tenders and I admit I didn't measure anything, but it turned out great! I served them with mashed potatoes and gravy and cooked veggies. I will make these again. Thanks.

LOVED this recipe. Made it with chicken breast tenders instead of the breast halves and it was absolutely delicious. Usually when I make chicken it tends to turn out dry, but this was so tender and juicy and flavorful. Amazing recipe!

Quick, easy and so delicious. I used Chicken Tenders. Used broiler for the last 5 minutes of baking. Served it with Stove Top Stuffing, a European grean bean salad, sliced tomatoes. We definitely will have this dish again.  Thanks Barb.

The chicken was so tender and this recipe was so fast and easy.  I would add some more spices next time.  I thought it needed just a little more flavor.

I love this chicken; so easy and tasty.  I can also tell you that it's just as moist, though perhaps not as tasty, without the parmesan: when I was making this tonight, I *forgot* to put it in!  LOL

I tried this recipe last night. It was really easy to make. I applied the mayo with my hands and rolled the chicken in the crumbs. The chicken came out really moist. I felt it did need a bit more spices so next time I am going to add garlic and onion powder.

This was great!   I took Cook's liberties and added a generous amount of seasonings,cheese, and minced garlic to the mayo before coating the chicken in it.  I used some cracked wheat party bread chips and blended them to make bread crumbs.   The bread crumbs stuck wonderfully,  as long as I didn't turn the chicken while it was cooking.  It turned out moist and delicious,  and I served it with tortilini in a white sauce.

The "dip into mayo mixture" threw me off.  I couldn't understand how "dipping" was possible.  After becoming annoyed I decided to spread a THIN layer of the mixture onto each breast and go from there.  The end result was okay but I probably won't make again.

I thought this was really good and moist. I marinated the chicken in italian salad dressing for several hours and made to recipe. The chicken was tender and flavorful, breading was crispy.

So moist & tender!  I used about 1/4 cup of the grated cheese, which was enough for us.  I butterflied each chicken breast and set my oven for 400 degrees on the convection bake setting.  It was done perfectly in 20 minutes.  Quick, easy & very tasty!

This is so good! Baked 10 minutes or so longer and took the suggestions to put on a rack and flip 5 minutes before finishing. Parchment paper under the rack helps with cleanup. Yum!

I made this for my daughter’s family and they loved it. They commented on how moist the chicken was. I followed the recipe exactly as written except that I did spray the pan and the chicken itself with PAM cooking spray.  It came out crispy on the outside and tender inside. Quick and easy recipe I will make for my husband myself.

It was good, not great.  I followed the recipe and it took WAY longer to cook at 425 than the 20 minutes listed. The breading was good but it didn't stay attached to the chicken.

The boyfriend and I really liked this recipe. I left him in charge of baking it while I went to the gym, and he ended up cooking it for another 10 mins. or so to let it get a little crispier. The chicken still came out very moist. We used an assortment of sauces to eat the chicken with. I used blue cheese; he used BBQ and ranch. I would make this again, but will double or triple the recipe next time, as we barely had any leftovers!

We love this recipe! I make it often. The only change I made is I put salt, pepper and onion powder on the chicken before I dip it in the mayo.

I marinaded the chicken in Italian dressing in the refrigerator for 4 hours first. I really liked the flavor of the coating but it was not as crunchy as I would have liked. Next time I will use Panco bread crumbs instead of the Italian bread crumbs. The chicken was very tender.

It was tasty however the coating didn't stick very well. When I flipped the chicken breast over half way through to get both sides baked it ended up sticking on the aluminum foil even though I sprayed the foil very well before putting it on there. Unfortunately most of the coating just fell off which wasted my hard work.

Absolutely delicious! It was a quick to fix dinner and very tender. I didn’t have any chicken breasts on hand so I used chicken tenders and cut the time down by a few minutes. The family said to definitely fix this again!

I made it just as written, except I used Miracle Whip because I had no mayo.  I figured it would be fine, since I sometimes put it on chicken to keep it tender when I grill it.  I was wrong, I could totally taste it so much that it overpowered the Italian seasonings.  I think I'll try it using Italian Dressing  and then re-rate the recipe.  My family did like it, I just didn't like that miracle whip--maybe mayo works just fine but I'm not going to try it.

This was great, I always have a problem getting the Italian seasoning to coat well, this recipe solves that with a great coating that adhere's well to the bread crumbs.  Also cooking fast at high heat gives the chicken a nice golden brown, cooked thru while still juicy.  Excellent recipe.

I decided I wanted to try something with bread crumbs, so I stumbled upon this. I added a few more ingredients (lemon/lime juice, olive oil, some basil), and it turned out to be the most amazing chicken I've ever eaten. I'm definitely going to make it again!

This was an excellent dish. Even better was how fast it was ready with only 20 minutes in the oven and only a few ingredients. Tasted like I spent a lot of time on it but I didn't. Absolutely fabulous. Thank you for sharing.

Meh, was okay... Nothing special.  Using breadcrumbs should make it more crispy, but as someone else mentioned mayo wasn't a good idea for dipping the chicken in.  Left the it soggy.  I'd say an egg wash w/ buttermilk would be way better.  And lightly salt w/ kosher salt when done.

The mayonaise and parmesan was hard to dip the chicken into.
The flour did not want to stay on it.   So it didn't turn out crispy and brown like the picture.   I must have done something wrong.    It was okay but I probably needed to add something else to it.

These turned out great! I didn't have enough regular bread crumbs so I ended up adding panko bread crumbs to the mix. I also used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts, which turned out wonderfully. My two year old (whom I had never had much luck getting to eat chicken before) ate 2 1/2 tenderloins the first night and again the next night with the leftovers! Mom win! Even my picky husband who won't eat leftovers ate them again.

This chicken was delicious . I don’t like mayo but I wanted to try this recipe anyways because I saw a review saying you couldn’t even taste it. Which is true. The chicken  comes out very moist but also comes with a crunchy outer coating. Very yummy . Very simple to make as well! This is definitely a saved recipe for me.

I was skeptical that all I would taste is mayonnaise but I didn't taste it at all, chicken turned out nice and juicy and had a ton of flavor.  My picky 3 year old son even gobbled it up, will definitely make this again!

I made this tonight for my family. I subbed the Mayo for Italian dressing like another review said. I marinated the chicken in the dressing first, then followed the recipe. The chicken was very mouse with lots of flavor! All thumbs up from my crew! Definitely will make this again!!

Easy to prepare. I used chicken tenders and the cooking time was the same.  Very flavorful and crispy with Panko bread crumbs.  It would be good to have a "special sauce" for it.

I had chicken tenders on hand, so I used those.  After tasting the sauce, which was delicious on its own, I also added a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and some Dijon mustard just because we like those flavors.  I used Panko instead of regular bread crumbs for added crunch.  Because I had tenders, I reduced heat to 400 degrees and baked for 20 minutes on cookie sheet.  No wire rack. They turned out crunchy and delicious.  This is a tasty, fast recipe for weeknight dinner; it's a keeper!

Delicious recipe.  Thank you.  Check temperature of the meat after 18 minutes, especially if you have pounded the chicken.  It cooked in about 19 minutes.  Very light, tender and moist chicken.

I have made this several times and love it. But I don't bother to mix everything together, I just coat the top of the chicken with the mayo and then sprinkle the others on top. Much easier. I also use this same recipe with salmon fillets. Talk about moist and flavourful!

Everyone now refers to this as "amazing chicken".  I use a mixture of sharp cheddar and five cheese Italian blend instead of parmesan.  I also use a splash of half and half in the cheese and mayonnaise mixture to make it more spreadable.  I also use a mixture of panko bread crumbs and Italian bread crumbs with some garlic salt sprinkled in to give it lots of crunch and flavor.  Two suggestions: (1) wear disposable gloves to spread the cheese mix and breadcrumbs onto the chicken - easiest way; and (2) line your baking pan with foil to save on clean up.  I love this because I can make a little or a lot.  Pair with a simple pasta dish for an AMAZING meal!  Delicious!

It was just okay. Also there is simply no way you get to 165° Internal temp cooking this chicken for 20 minutes. You need to bake for at least 30 if not a bit longer.

I've made chicken like this before but used much less mayo.  It does add moisture to the chicken but also a very distinctive flavor.  I've started using either light or heavy cream mixed with Parmesan cheese before dipping into a mixture of corn flake crumbs and panko crumbs.  This really boosts the crunch.

I did like others suggested. I added parsley, oregano, and thyme to the mayo mixture. I also flipped it for the final 5 minutes. Very good though, served with mashed potatoes.

This popped into my inbox today, so I made it to try something easy and new. If you are in a chicken rut and short on time, this is perfect! The whole family enjoyed it! As others recommended, I added a little oregano, thyme, and rosemary (just sprinkled it on top after breading). Very easy and tasted great. Ours turned out fairly crispy after baking on a rack and flipping twice. Will go in the weeknight rotation!

This is a great way to coat chicken.  But, I fried  the breasts in a mixture of butter and canola instead of baking.

The chicken was moist but it didn't seem to have a lot of flavor.  It took 30 minutes to cook all the way through.

It’s great recipe. I would not have mayonnaise as dipping. I would rather make my own chutney for dipping which I’m always doing for all dishes like this.  For example for this one I would make yogurt with mint and fresh coriander and add some spices to it according to my taste.

Ive never used mayo as a way to keep coating on chicken before especially mixed with the parmesan cheese.  I really liked it a lot.  It was very quick and easy to make.  I cook for one so it was easy to par down the recipe.  I did add some shredded monserella cheese.  Great way to make chicken!

The amount of mayo was definitely TOO much so I ended up throwing out half. I added some finely shredded mozzarella cheese to the mix with the Parmesan and tastes fantastic! Used a wire rack as another reviewer suggested but when I flipped the chicken, half of the breadcrumbs stayed on the rack. Ending up adding mozzarella on top of those empty spots and tasted great!

I've tried this twice so far and both times it tasted great! This was some of the juiciest, most tender chicken I've ever had.  The mayo really helps to keep it moist. I made a couple changes though. I grated my own Parmesan instead of using the powdered stuff and I cooked it for 25 minutes instead of 20. This is one of my new favorites!

I made it without cheese and used almond flour but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and my kids loved it. It’s going in regular rotation. Thanks

I made it according to recipe except I added some wasabi mayo to the regular mayo.  It did not brown.  I had to turn the broiler on.  Even then did not really brown.  The chicken tasted good and was very moist.

I made this chicken and  used 1/2 cup of mayonnaise and a 1/4 cup of chardonnay mustard  instead of 3/4  cup of mayonnaise .    I also thin sliced cutlets instead of breasts.  I enjoyed this dish a lot and so did my family.

The chicken was very moist.   Had to cook it for 25 minutes to get the pink out of the meat, but worth the wait.   Lots of flavour.   Will definitely do it again.

This was so good! I thought I had bread crumbs before I started, but I didn't so I used plain Panko crumbs and added Italian seasoning and a little salt to those. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, and flipped the chicken halfway through.  I did cook them on a wire rack in a pan lined with aluminum foil. The Panko crumbs came out perfectly crispy...I think I would use these over the breadcrumbs when I make again.  My 16 yr. old son said he LOVED this chicken!  I served with artichokes and mixed fresh fruit.

Tasty! I halved recipe as it’s just my husband and I for dinner. Added some garlic powder to bread crumbs too. Chicken was very moist and had great flavor. I had issues with breadcrumbs staying on chicken when I flipped it. Lost a lot of coating. I also baked on wire rack like others suggested. Will probably make again.

Fabulous.  I didn't have a ton of time so I used thin cut skinless chicken breast  and cooked them for 20 min at 350 on a wire rack in a foil lined pan.  I turned them over after 10 min so they'd be crisp on both sides. They were awesome. I used italian blend croutons that I crushed in a blender instead of bread crumbs and I added different spices to the mayo mix.  Incredibly quick, easy and delicious!

Great recipe! It was so easy and the chicken turned out delicious!  I only added 1/2 tsp dried parsley and 1/2 tsp dried oregano to give it a little more taste.  I also used 1 clove of garlic since I did not have garlic powder.  I made a big mistake and combined salty crackers previously crumbed (instead of bread crumbs) with the mayo and spices, and since I did not want to waste that, I just went ahead and rubbed it all on the skinless boneless chicken thighs that I was going to use.  Baked them on a cookie rack over my pan for 15 minutes on one side and then flipped them over and baked the next 5 minutes.  I then turned off the oven and served them 45 minutes later.  My family loved it, thanks!

Everyone loved it. So moist and tender. Used plain bread crumbs and added a couple of my own spices since I can't do oregano. Couple dashes of ground red pepper gave it a nice little kick.

Instead of using the chicken breast halves, I just used tenders and it still came out perfectly!!! I also added some lemon. My family loved it.

This was a fast and easy recipe, the breasts I had were thick and cooked perfectly at this temperature and time. The flavor is good, but needs a little more kick...so I just seasoned the breasts with salt, pepper & Italian Seasoning before dredging.

I used tenderloins instead of chicken breasts and panko bread crumbs w/ oregano instead of Italian bread crumbs. I needed to use more than the called for amounts of cheese, bread crumbs and garlic powder. Delicious!

The breading did not stick to the chicken and just fell off when cooking. I followed it closely. I will not make again.

This was very easy to prepare. I did have to cook it for about 30-35 minutes. I do not think I will make this again as all of the seasoning slid off the chicken when I transferred it to a plate. I think this was due to the mayonnaise. I am a vegetarian and made this for the rest of my family so I cannot comment on the taste as I did not eat it.

I needed to use what I had on hand, so I substituted shredded (instead of grated) Parmesan and crushed potato chips instead of the bread crumbs. If I had Italian seasoning, I would’ve added that, but I was committed to not going to the store. I also used chicken tenderloins and baked according to the directions. Moist and tasty.

The only thing I would change is to add a flour coat. The breading was crisp and chicken was don e but as I  picked them up some of the coating came off. I flipped it around though and threw the  drippings and parts of the coating that fell off into the mashed potatoes I made and there were 0 leftovers.

I made this & it was so good...I did add some oregano, red pepper flakes, black pepper & basil to both mixtures...Also added Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs... Served It With fettuccine Alfredo but to tell you the truth it would be good all by itself... Will be making it again...

What a great recipe. It's Thanksgiving week so cooking meals falls by the wayside. This was easy, used things I had on hand, and so good my husband has asked  me to make it again soon. Made as written except decided to use croutons as suggested by another reviewer. I added some cayenne to Hub's as he likes spicy but kept the rest "normal". So good. Thanks Barb Eisel for a great meal .

Hands down, the most requested dinner by my husband, and even my personal favorite, too! Absolutely divine! Ive made it almost a dozen times now, and one evening inevitably came when I only had chicken thighs on hand, not boneless breasts or tenders; but the substitute was just as delicious when cooked at 425 degrees until the internal temp reached 185 (approximately 30 minutes).

Very good and will definitely make again. Remember to pound the chicken breast so it’s an even thickness. I used Panko bread crumbs with Italian seasoning added, because I prefer panko. I made again cut chicken into strips, cooked 15 min, then broiled on both sides. Very good

Will totally make this again.  My 11 year old LOVED it!   

Few changes I made
-Used chicken tenders instead of breasts 
- For breadcrumb mixture I used half italian bread crumbs anf half panko bread crumbs and added a pinch of salt. 
- For mayo mixture I used half Veganiase and half greek yogurt, I may try all greek yogurt next time  
- made a quick dijon and honey sauce for dipping.

This was really good, I didn't measure out my spices and added the spices to the bread crumbs instead. Ill try the other way next time. This is good to dip in ranch dressing yum.

This didn't work out for me, which made me sad because it was so fast and simple to put together.  Mine came out weirdly tough and chewy, I couldn't eat it. I think that baking it at such a high temperature was at issue. I understand you would need it for browning, but that's a nope from me.

I made this and my kids and husband loved it.  I tried baking it on a rack as suggested but the chicken was not cooked.  I placed it on a  cookie sheet and baked it as written.  Then, I broiled it for a few minutes till it turned brown.

I didn’t have parmesan cheese on hand so I left it out and I used 8 chicken thighs instead of breasts. It took 35 minutes at 425 degrees to cook. WOW so moist and delicious! I’ll be making this again.

This is good but seems similar to what's on the side of my bread crumb container.  So I don't think it's anything special that I need to refer to again. It does help to flip the chicken before the baking is done so that both sides get crunchy.

I make this often.  I use Panako crumbs and also 1/2t of smoked paprika.  Sometimes  making  cutlets into fingers and roast potato wedges  along with the chicken.   Delicious and easy...coleslaw as a side.

Outstanding recipe!!!  I like to use chicken thighs or breasts.  Mix Hellmann's mayonnaise, freshly grated Parmesan cheese, and 1 Tbsp. chopped garlic.  In a bowl, mix that all up with the chicken parts.  Put foil in bottom of baking sheet.   In a single layer, put slathered chicken on top foil, scraping any extra sauce over chicken parts.  Sprinkle liberally with Italian bread crumbs, and bake as directed in 425* oven.   This is much easier than rolling the chicken parts in the bread crumbs and tastes just as delicious.

Super delish!!  I pounded out the chicken breasts to cook more even (they were super thick),  I also cut them length-wise to be more like tenders.  I did add some lemon juice to the mayo along with the parm cheese and garlic.  I also added some parm cheese, garlic, and sriracha pepper to the breadcrumbs.  Also had to flip them halfway.  Will definitely make them again!!!  Thanks!!

I made this tonight for my hubby and myself and as always with chicken breasts I take a mallet and even out the breasts thickness. I did add a bit of black pepper and seasoning salt and we really loved this. So quick and easy. Thanks Barb

Made it following the recipe. Baked it on a rack as others suggested. It was crispy on both sides and had a good taste. Hubby liked it and I’ll make it again.

I only gave it three stars because I followed the directions exactly and ended up with soggy bottom chicken. Definitely going to try an egg wash or Italian dressing instead of mayo next time. Very interested in seeing what the croutons would add to the taste. I sprinkled additional shredded Parmesan on top and paired it with Mediterranean veggies. Delicious!

I make this all the time with chicken thighs because they are cheaper and I bake them for 50 min at 400 or until juices run clear. Delicious and quick.

Good, but a bit sweet-tasting. The mayonnaise was incredibly hard to dip the chicken in, and I noticed that the pieces that had uneven mayo spots turned out a bit soggy. I also baked 5-min longer than recommended to try and make these a bit crisper. Kiddos and husband both enjoyed them.

The mayo and cheese mixture makes it hard for the cheese to stick on the chicken so I added the cheese after.  But turned out very well!

I used Panko whole wheat bread crumbs and added salt, parsley, pepper, garlic & onion powders, oregano and basil to make the Italian seasoned bread crumbs for this recipe. The chicken was savory, moist with a crunchy crust and we enjoyed every bite!

Awesome! Would have been five stars but it wasn't as crispy as I would like and I did have to add some more spices. But the hub said it had a nice flavor and it was quick (albeit messy) and easy.

I cooked it on a wire rack as other commenters suggested. I also added oregano, thyme, and parsley to the mayo mixture. I’ll probably try light mayo next time.

DEE-LIC-OUS! I used a bit less mayo and mixed with a splash of half and half and an egg so the wash was not so thick, it turned out great. I will definitely be making this again soon.

My family said they were good enough to make again !!

It was a big hit. I used wire racks as suggested by another member...worked great. I used the mayo sparingly too.  I had some croutons from Olive Garden that had a lot of flavor to them. A quick pounding and they became some excellent bread crumbs.

This was good!  I followed a few other reviewers advice and added additional spice and also cooked mine on a rack on the cookie sheet so there was no need to turn them and they were nicely cooked on both sides - no sticking either!  I would make this again but it was a little bland so I would definitely add some more spice.

Super easy recipe and it was delicious. Not the greatest chicken I’ve ever had but perfect for a quick weeknight meal. Only thing I did different was marinate chicken tenders in Italian dressing for about an hour before dipping in mayo and breadcrumbs, just to add a little extra flavor, but it probably would’ve been fine without that extra step.

This recipe does make for juicy chicken.  I found the mayonaise to be a little thick for my taste.  The second time I made this I substituted the mayonaise with a light Hidden Valley ranch dressing.  I liked it a lot more.

Very good! The mayo/cheese mixture keeps the chicken moist and gave it great flavor. I had to bake it for 30 minutes before the chicken was done though.

We enjoyed this chicken recipe! I didn't add cheese, but did include more spices: basil, oregano, Italian and Greek spices.  Also, adding rosemary was a very good addition.  I cooked it on a broiler pan. Although I pounded the 3 breasts thinner, it still took 20 minutes each side. This recipe is very flexible: crackers can replace bread crumbs, and can add dijon mustard with the mayo.  I no longer measure ingredients, just add your favorite spices.

This was really good. I took some creative license and added herbs and goddess dressing to the mayo, but it would have been good without any doctoring. Great jumping off point, thanks for a great recipe.

This was very yummy.  It took something that could have been boring - baked chicken - and turned it into a flavorful feast.  My husband and I both enjoyed this very much.  We will definitely make it again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Tasty.  Be sure to use a wire rack.  I did not add garlic and it was still great.  I added about 1 T dijon mustard to the mayo mixture, and sprinkled some additional oregano and basil into the bread crumbs.

Made this tonight exactly like recipe using Duke's mayonnaise. If you have not tried this wonderful Southern mayo, you've got to try it. We can get it here in CO at Walmart so try your local store. I added some Italian seasonings to the bread crumbs and after placing the chickens in the pan to bake, I added some of the left over mayo mixture on top of each chicken breast. I did bake the chicken an additional 10 minutes due to our altitude and the results were awesome. Served it with Sautéed Patty Pan Squash on this website and fresh  sliced tomatoes sprinkled with basil. Yummy dinner! Thanks Barb!                     CO Karen

This was easy & delicious! I didn’t have Italian seasoned bread crumbs, so I just used plain bread crumbs & added about 2  TBS of Italian seasoning plus a dash of oregano & basil each. The chicken was pounded first & the result was very tender chicken & crispy on the outside. YUMMY!

As my husband said after the first bite "This is a redo" (meaning, please make it again).  I cut my chicken breasts length-wise, or else they would still be cooking.  I also used ranch dressing instead of mayo since I am not a big fan of the latter.  I put them on a cooking rack over a cookie sheet and flipped after 10 minutes.  They were very good.  I also minced a garlic clove instead of using garlic powder.  Well definitely make in the future.  Thank you for sharing.

I’ve made this recipe a few times now, exactly how it says.  No tweaks on my part or else it wouldn’t be this recipe!  So delicious, my family devoured it and there were no leftovers!

I used drumsticks instead of breasts  and it made the chicken so much more moist and tasty.

This is one of our favorite chicken dishes.  I make it just as the recipe calls for and it never fails to come out moist and incredibly tasty.  I have experimented with the recipe (added French fried onions, different herbs, etc) but always come back to the basic one.

The wash is altogether too thick, I wound up adding probably a half cup of milk to make it viable.  And I think it would be better to use Greek Yogurt instead of Mayonaisse, it would be less fattening and slightly more authentic (in fact you could then go "full on" Greek by using Feta instead of Parmesan, and plain bread crumbs but with some traditional Greek herbs)

I should have watched the video before attempting.  I followed recipe and attempted to "dredge" the chicken through the Mayo mixture, which was a big mess.  It didn't "dredge" very well.  Next time I will brush onto the pieces and add the wire rack with cookie sheet baking method (the bottom of my pieces stuck to my baking sheet so it had coating left on the top only).  I didn't add additional herbs, but made note to do that next time for a little added flavor.    Incorporating into our family meal calendar.  It's a keeper

I made it exactly as written and loved it. I also made it, warmed up marinara sauce, poured it over the chicken and put 2 cups of mozzarella cheese over it and broiled it for 3 minutes. My family loved it that way as well.

This recipe is very good, though I found it a bit strange that you mixed the garlic powder and the parmesan cheese into the mayo.  Instead I mixed the garlic powder and cheese into the breadcrumbs.  I also cut the chicken into tenders instead of  just halves.  Continued with the recipe as normal.  Will definetely make again.

Family all agreed.. this is a definite repeat.. used panko instead of bread crumbs and cooked on a cookie rack over a pan as suggested by so many...I upped the seasoning..to our taste...try it, it's a great week night quick meal..I used breast meat, but pounded them out first...so worth the extra step.

Many years ago my mom gave me this recipe, but called it chicken dip.  After making and enjoying this for a long time, I agree 1/2 mayo is really enough.  Since the "chicken dip" was easy to learn by heart after making it so often, I now feel free to change up the dip.  I've used have mayo and half sour cream with a dash of Worchester sauce along with the seasonings.  Don't be afraid to experiment with flavors you enjoy.

This was absolutely delicious.  I used to make my breaded chicken with dreaged flour, egg, and bread crumbs and fry in olive oil.  THIS is far superior, easier, and cleaner to make.  My family loved it, including my picky teen.  The key is to pound the chicken first.  I had no wire baking rack and it still turned out well. I will make this again and again.

Easy to make, very tasty.   Very tender.  I did give the chicken a bit of a pounding first.   I followed the recipe exactly.   With some crispy noodles and a salad, we were both very full.  Now in the "rotation"!

My husband said this was the best baked chicken I have ever made, so its a keeper! Save yourself the time and mess pounding out the chicken breasts and buy thin sliced chicken breasts.  The only other change I made was to add some minced garlic in addition to the garlic powder. Delicious!

I used the ingredients called for but added some half and half to think out the mayo a bit, then some italian seasonings.  This went together easily.  I baked the chicken pieces on a rack over a sheet pan.  The top of the chicken started drying out and burning  too soon.  I turned down the over to 375 and cooked longer...total time 45 minutes.  Chicken was moist and flavorful.  Coating was overdone.  Chicken flavor made up for that.  I will make again, keeping temp lower and cook longer.

I made  this and my son loved it. He is such a picky eater so this recipe was right up his street. Instead of mayonnaise, I used a mix of two brands of salad dressing...a regular ranch dressing and a parmesan ranch dressing. Just perfect for him...very moist.

So tasty for such minimal effort. I forgot the green onions but it tasted great. Like other reviewers, my cook time was about ten minutes longer then the recipe called for even though I was using small chicken breasts.

My husband and I really liked this and will definitely make again.  I didn't change much, but did make Doyle the gravy and was glad I did.  Also added fresh garlic cloves to the meat.  I didn't have cooking sherry but added white wine instead and that worked just fine.
Thanks for a great recipe!

This was extremely simple to make and the chicken turned out very good and fork tender! I used boneless chicken thighs and added onion powder, salt and pepper to the mayo mix. I took the advice of another reviewer and put the chicken on a rack on a baking sheet and it was perfect! The

Easy to make your own with added cheese, alfredo, maybe a bit of pando with the Italian crumbs for crunch. Excellent flavor wonderful leftovers if you're lucky to have any left for next day.

The only change I made was I used Ranch instead of Mayo and seasoned to taste with garlic. Everyone loved how moist it turned out. I should have listened to others as my chicken  breast were too thick so had to bake longer, next time I will cut them.

Yum! But I made it even easier..... Instead of rolling chicken mayo mixture ,then breadcrumbs, i put chicken breasts on a baking pan lined with foil, sprayed with an oil spray. I topped and spread mayo mixture on breasts, then sprinkled with Italian breadcrumbs. In the oven they went, and yum.

This. Was. Killer. Followed directions to a T, and it turned out so moist and delightful. Might try adding in some other flavors in the future, but great recipe as is. Hubby was “Mmmm, mmming”while eating which is a great sign! Thanks for sharing!

Turned out very good.. only thing because my chicken was frozen/defrosted and not "completely" defrosted... I had to cook 40 minutes...  but very tasty - will make it again...  Also I used 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs and that worked out perfectly...

My companion  who is not too fond of chicken, really liked it.  Putting it on a rack on the baking sheet  made all of it stay together and browned the underside.  I used seasoned Panko bread crumbs.

This is a great Basic recipe. I added to the mayo bowl
onion powder, garlic, and McCormick Montreal Chicken seasoning and of course the cheese. I used Progresso Itailan seasoned bread crumbs. I cooked mine for 30 to 35 minutes and that was perfect.

Delicious! The chicken was very tender and moist. I did, however, overbake it, but will not do so again! Next time I think I will go with 50/50 bread crumbs and panko and add some Italian seasoning.

Instead of plain bread crumbs  , I  blended some flavoured croutons that i had on hand.  The chicken breasts are very moist with this recipe and all enjoyed

I combined this crust with the Chicken Cordon Bleu recipe I found here.  My husband could not say enough how much he liked it.  The mayo sauce you make to dip can be used for all sorts of other things.  Just ask my husband.  We loved it and will make it a part of our regular  meal plans.

This dish was terrible.  I made it exactly as written, even watched the video.  The breading fell off and I will never make this again.  I have another chicken strip  recipe that I have made and it is really good, just wanted to try something different.  Sorry I did.

This is very tasty and is "almost" the same I use except I dip the chicken in egg and buttermilk. The italian bread crumbs make it really flavorful.

My mother taught me how to make this dish when I was about 12 years old because it was so easy and with such good results, it served as  encouragement to continue to learn new dishes.  I do hope "Barb" is not claiming this as a new find recipe because at 76 years old I am many, many years away from that time. :-)

Juicy..Tender..Awesomeness!! I tried mine with boneless skinless chicken thighs and it's really good. It reminds of an old recipe I hadn't made in years...Minus the bread crumbs and throw it on the grill. Thank you!!  This is a winner!!

Made it once as written- loved it.  Used a wire rack to keep both sides crispy and did not need to turn. Second time, made it by using buttermilk instead of mayonnaise. It was just as good!

This was VERY GOOD tho I didn't use the Mayo. I sliced the chicken into strips dipped them in butter then in the 'bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, pepper, powdered onion and garlic and garlic salt' then baked at 425 for 35min flipping after 15 min.

followed the recipe exactly, it was easy to make, but turned out ok.  Nothing bad, just not spectacular enough to make again. I think mayo was the issue, it made the breadcrumbs soggy. But I appreciate the recipe!

OH MY GOODNESS. Coming from a mayonnaise hater, I was very skeptical. Even as I was  making it and smelling the mayonnaise - my hopes went down. I was SO pleasantly surprised! This was delicious! I followed the recipe with the exception of adding a teensy bit more garlic (I love it) and using crushed croutons. I also used the 1 cup of cheese in the coating and then used the other cup that came in the bag to spread over the chicken in the baking pan. It melted deliciously. I LOVED IT! This will definitely be something I make again.

It really didn't taste very mayonnais-y to me!

06.28.17 ~ I have been on a roll lately with using some great recipes.  This one continues with that winning streak.  I had a package with six chicken tenders, so that is what I used.  I made up as listed and added a cooling rack to the top of my baking sheet so that the crust wouldn't get soggy.  I sprayed the rack with cooking spray so that the chicken wouldn't stick and flipped the chicken half way through baking.  The results were outstanding with great flavor.  Served this up with homemade applesauce and some leftover pasta and dinner was wonderful.  Thanks Barb Eisel, for sharing your recipe.  It is a keeper.

This was easy and delicious!  I made a couple of modifications.  Instead of mayonnaise, I beat two eggs in a bowl and added some ranch dressing to it.  Then I added more herbs to the bread crumbs and parmesan (basil, oregano, thyme, cracked black pepper, whatever you like).  I then used one boneless breast and four boneless thighs, dipped them in the liquid mixture and then coated them, and baked as instructed.  My fiance loved these!!  I'll definitely add it to our regular menu!

Just as a previous reviewer, I followed the recipe exactly and just added a couple more spices (oregano, parsley and basil). I also followed their example of baking on a wire rack on a cookie sheet for 20 minutes and flipping the chicken over for the last 5 minutes, and my family couldn't stop eating it. I loved it too! Turned out perfectly yummy, was very juicy and had just the right amount of crispness. PERFECT easy, fast, great dinner.

I make this recipe probably twice a month and have made it for countless guest dinners. Definitely amazingly moist and tasty. I add a little crushed red pepper to the mayo mixture for some heat and cut the breasts in half to save on cook time. A must try!

The recipe as it is is pretty bland. Really needs salt, pepper and a good mix of Italian spices.

I used salad croutons that I ground up in my food processor fir the bread crumbs since I love their flavor.  This worked perfectly.  I followed the rest as in the directions.  My husband and son loved it!  Very moist and flavorful.

I just use egg instead of mayonnaise (3 large eggs are about 3/4 of a cup) and I use panko bread crumbs mixed with a little Italian seasoning. They turn out deliciously moist and tender. They also reheat well! I've made this with thighs as well as breasts, and both are great!

So delicious! I dipped it in egg, and crushed up cheese garlic croutons and shredded cheddar cheese. Baked at 400 for 30 min. That's it, moist and tender and gone in a flash!

Flavor was great...this was a wonderful recipe that we will eat again! I also flipped the chicken 5-minutes prior to them being done for extra crispiness. It was perfect.

Very delicious but I subbed Greek yogurt for mayo for a lower fat and calorie option and mixed some Panko bread crumbs in with the regular bread crumbs to add some extra crunch. I make this at least 2x a month!

I added onion powder, dried red chili flakes and a little black pepper  to the mayonnaise and parmesan mixture. I used Best Foods Real Mayonnaise and the coating stayed on the chicken breasts and browned crisp. 

I used Progresso Garlic and Herb Seasoned Bread Crumbs and added a little Italian seasoning. 

The boneless chicken breasts I used were pretty thick. I cut each breast down the middle to make each piece thinner. 

The chicken was moist and delicious while the coating was crisped to a perfect crunch.

I followed the original recipe exactly.  It tasted pretty good and the chicken was very moist, but I think with some tweaks, it could taste better. Next time, I'm going to use creamy italian dressing instead of mayo, for a start.  I think it could also use some italian spices,  and parsley added to the italian bread crumbs to make it a bit more flavorful.

Very good, thanks! I cooked it on a rack in a roaster pan and turned it to crisp the other side for 8 extra minutes. As I was putting away the leftovers, I noticed nearly the exact recipe on the mayo jar! I never would've looked at the back of a mayo jar for a chicken recipe haha.

Turned out amazing! I did change one thing. I didn't feel like using bread crumbs so substituted it for Ritz crackers. Coated the chicken very nicely and was very crispy. =)

Very good.  I'm just starting to learn to cook and was able to follow the recipe and even substituted chicken thighs instead of breasts.  They had to cook longer but it really turned out great.

This is the recipe on the side of the Helmans mayo jar, the only difference is the addition of garlic powder.

I also put in some Italian seasoning, but kept everything else the same.  Yes, the topping was soggy on the bottom, but I'd rather that than have to clean a cookie rack. Lazy, but my choice.

I will do what someone else suggested and crushed Italian croutons to make it more crunchy next time, as there will be a next time!

This chicken turned out perfectly, and it's delicious!  I made it with chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts, but the results were fantastic.  It was very easy to make, and didn't take long at all from start to finish.  I will definitely be making this chicken again...maybe adding a bit of spice to it next time!

I didn't have any bread crumbs on hand the first time I used the recipe, so I crushed up ritz crackers and used them instead.  My entire family LOVED this dish.  I did try it with the bread crumbs the next time, but we actually prefer the butter crackers on it.  Other than that modification, this recipe is now a staple at our house.

Taste great and was very easy to prep and bake. I actually cut chicken into cubes instead and sprinkled the bread crumbs over the chicken and cooked at 350 for 40 min. Next time I'll cook at higher heat for less time.

We call this Parmesan Chicken in my house :). No need for mayo - I simply dip the chicken in a little melted butter instead.   Great, easy recipe!

I loved this recipe. I did change a few things, like adding more garlic powder ( just a few shakes from the container) and not as much mayo. I wiggled the chicken in the mayo and coated with breadcrumbs completely. Also I recommend using chicken breast tenderloins instead and flipping them halfway through cooking time.

Such a simple recipe for such a delicious food. I was looking for a simple breaded chicken recipe that uses Italian seasoned bread crumbs and this one fit the bill. We actually didn't add the cheese, but it was still soooo good. I also found the crumbs were nice and crispy.

While this tasted good and everything, to smother a piece of chicken (or anything) with mayonnaise is unhealthy.

Came out a little soggy, would suggest cooking on a grill pan in the oven, and then turning midway through the process. But other than that, delicious!

Delicious! Made with smaller chicken bscb cuts I had on hand and used Panko that I added Italian seasonings to. Otherwise followed the recipe as written. Coating was nice and crispy and the chicken was juicy. Baked in the oven on a grill pan with ridges, cooked very evenly without needing to flip.

Easy and delicious. Used cheddar only because I was out of Parmesan and still came out great.

Mine came out a little different. I didn't have Parmesan cheese. I used something similar. But it was very tasty.

I followed the recipe pretty closely but substituted gluten free bread crumbs in and sprinkled Italian seasoning on them instead and it was absolutely delicious!  I would definitely make this again!

Fabulous Recipe. So easy and tasty. The Chicken was moist and had a nice flavor. I did season the chicken with seasoned salt and pepper before coating in mayo and bread crumbs. It is definitely going to be in the dinner rotation.

Really good moist chicken. My husband who hates mayo and nearly refused to eat this when he discovered it had it it could not stop raving about them once he tried them! Huge hit!

I made a few slight changes (I generally don't review when I do this, but can't resist!)  Based on the advice of others, I added some spices (oregano, rosemary, parsley and thyme).  I used the italian breadcrumbs, but added some crushed up croutons which added a nice crunch to the chicken (1/4 cup croutons, 1/2 cup breadcrumbs was the ratio).  I also used chicken tenders instead of breasts (8 of them, so about a pound), and cooked 15 minutes on a wire rack on top of a cookie sheet.  These were fabulous.  I used the leftovers to make a salad and also chopped some up to make sandwiches too...even the leftovers were fabulous.

Great basic breaded chicken recipe! I added some more spices & cut my thicker chicken breasts into halves so that they would be thinner and cook crispier - like some reviewers suggested. Easy to execute, and quite tasty! Chicken was so moist when it was done, and fiancee enjoyed his meal very much. Served with green beans and mac & cheese!

Awesome!  My only changes: didn't have Italian bread crumbs, just plain, so I mixed a dry packet of good seasons Italians dressing in with the bread crumbs.  Also, it's easier to mix all of the dry ingredients together, and just coated the chicken with plain mayo before coating with the dry ingredients, and used grated fresh Parmesan.

I make this all the time!!!!  (We call it Mayonnaise Chicken!)... I love it even more in the summer when I can add fresh herbs... don't be bashful! I'm particularly fond of basil, parsley and/or rosemary.... so tender you can cut it with your fork.  I'd give it TWENTY stars if I could!!!!

My wife like it better than I did, we had very thick breast so we cooked it a little longer, about 30 minutes. Chicken was very tender and moist. I was hoping for a little more flavor. Very easy to make. We might try it again and make a few changes to "brighten" up the flavor.

If I could, I'd give this 10 Stars! Great recipe! I followed it exactly as it is. As a single guy - this was so easy to make, with very little cleanup, and I already had all the ingredients in my kitchen.  Give it a go!

This was a huge hit with my family. I altered it some by keeping the dry ingredients together.  I coated chicken with lite mayo then rolled it in whole wheat panko, 1T of Italian seasoning and parm cheese. I also used vegetarian parm cheese (less fat & calories)

It's difficult not to award this 5 stars. It's incredibly simply and absolutely delicious. Look no further if you are looking for something quick and tasty.

Fabulous - followed recipe except for not having enough bread crumbs I crushed garlic and herb croutons and mixed with breadcrumbs.  Will definitely make again.  Husband not a big fan of chicken but said you can make this again!

VERY happy with this recipe.  The chicken came out just right and the coating wasn't thick or heavy, but still flavorful.  Highly recommended.

I LOVED this recipe!!!!! As a beginning cook and picky eater, I was a bit skeptical because of the ingredients (all the mayo and parm) but you can't even taste it. The taste was absolutely great! Next time I will probably use half of the mayo/parm mix because I ended up wiping some of it off the chicken before adding the breadcrumbs. A+ recipe!

Easy and tasty.  Chicken came out tender from mayo layer but crispy on outside.  I cooked the chicken on a backing rack as suggested, and since I used a convection oven I didn't even need to flip it to crisp up the bottom.  I did add 1tsp Italian seasoning to the mayo mixture, and also some more parm cheese to the bread crumbs, since I love parm.  Good stuff.

I would definitely make this again. I used boned Chicken Thigh which worked well. I used Panko crumbs mixed with quite a lot of Italian dried herbs.  Kept to the recipe with the Mayo bit.  Very easy.  I baked on a raised cake tray and turned 5 minutes from the end.  Yummy.

This works and is delicious. Our new standard baked chicken breasts. Is hard to get breading thick enough so use super fine grated parmesan not shredded! Delicious and simple.

We loved this! I used crushed Italian style croutons for the bread crumbs... everything else was the same. I used the small tenderloins and baked at 425 for 13 minutes.  YUM!! Crunchy and flavorful. We used homemade honey mustard to dip them in.

Super fast and tasty with added seasoning!  Here in Texas, we like things extra seasoned, so Tony Chachere is a staple.  Added it to the mayo mix and bread crumbs.  Only had plain bread crumbs - worked just fine.  Used my Pampered Chef stone - I think it helped from the bottom being soggy.  Big hit with my boys that usually don't finish anything!

Made as directed, except added 1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning. Had trouble getting the mayo mixture to stay on chicken tenders. Over-all, moist, but we didn't like the final finish. Tried to crisp them up by baking them on a cookie cooling rack, and adding 5 minutes. Too mushy for us. Won't make again.

I put the chicken on a wire rack in a cookie sheet as another reviewer suggested, but the coating was still mushy. Maybe because I really put the mayo mixture on thick? It was still excellent! I'll be making this again! I lined the cookie sheet with tin foil so I didn't need to wash that. The wire rack was non stick so that cleaned up easy as well.

I made this as directed and I couldn't believe how moist it was. I would follow other reviews and turn the chicken over for 5 minutes so that the bottom can get crispy too. Mine turned out soggy. But very tasty!  Thanks!

This was fantastic! I ended up cooking it a little longer than the recommended time. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the calorie count, but then again the mayo is what makes it. Delish!

So easy and delicious.  Made with panko instead of bread crumbs and Light Miracle whip instead of mayo, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Flipped over halfway through like some of the reviews had suggested.  Mine took a little bit longer..25-30 minutes.  Next time will dry the Dijonnaise like some reviews suggest!

This was so good! I was out of breadcrumbs so I used oatmeal and a bunch of seasonings I had on hand. (I also used Creamy Italian Dressing instead of mayo like another reviewer.) 
My housemate who hates anything "breaded" even thought it was delicious. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you!!

This is sooo good! I did add some Paprika, garlic powder, onion powder and a tbsp of Dijon mustard to the mayonnaise mixture. I served the chicken with Penne pasta tossed in Alfredo sauce, seasoned broccoli,and a garlic bread recipe from this site. Oh! Add a little French salad dressing to the chicken right before you dive in! It's sounds crazy but it is DELICIOUS!! Don't knock it till you try it! :)

I made this a few weeks ago and my family absolutely loved it!  I added some leftover spaghetti sauce once it was done and served over whole-wheat spaghetti noodles with a tossed salad on the side. The chicken was so moist and tender. 
My husband requested this again for tonight's dinner.  Time to go do the prep work so everything will be perfect once again.  :D

Tip:  Use ranch dressing to thin out the mayonnaise mixture as needed.  Also, add Italian breadcrumbs to a large bag.  Add a few pieces at a time and shake for a more even coating.

I made this tonight as I needed a quick recipe because I was short on time.  My husband loved it!  I paired it with au gratin potatoes and corn.  It would also be great with pasta and a fresh salad.

I think the people who said it was soggy, or bland and dind't cook it enough must have used chicken breast that was too thick.  I used very thin chicken breasts and followed the recipe.  I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder, and Italian bread crumbs.  It was cripsy, moist and delicious.  I will probably try with mustard or italian dressing next time to save on the calories.  It is delicious, but you should always taste the bread crumb mixture before you dip and cook the chicken... if it's bland then, guess what - it'll be bland cooked!!

Made this last night and got rave reviews from everyone in the family.  I only added 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese and it seemed to be enough for me.  I also added some black pepper to the mayo mixture.  This recipe is fast to put together and goes from oven to table in 25 minutes.  A definite repeat!  Thanks for posting.

Just made this. I'm not much into Mayo so I used Italian dressing instead as another person that reviewed this recipe. The chicken was very moist and the parmesan cheese gave it a nice touch.  The wife loved it as did I.  Very easy and not a lot of prep time.

I made it according to the recipe and my husband said that he'd like to have it again!  I used chicken breast tenderloins from Costco, but if I were using chicken breast halves, I would cut them into 2 or 3 strips to allow more surface of the flavorful crunchy coating.  This recipe was quick, easy and delicious!

mmhh yum! Thanks for the idea!! I hate dipping in egg, so messy! I made nuggets for the kids, they loved it too, ate them without asking for ketchup!!   I made it with leftovers of whole grain bread, added some unsweetened breakfast grains, crushed it finely added lots of garlic, paprika, dried herbs, some pepper; grated parmesan cheese I keep on stock in freezer. they came out wonderfully crispy, exactly after those 20min.  Next time I'll try yoghurt and maybe some honey to add stickiness instead of Thomy mayo, to make it totally natural!

The chicken was moist and tasty, but I just didn't care for the prep. I had a messy time getting the mayo/parm mixture on the breasts. I don't mind your typical egg/milk dips, but the mayo mix was too thick to easily coat the chicken before putting in the bread crumbs.

Very tasty. I sliced the chicken open and added a slice of Monterey  Jack which melted and just ran out... I'll add the cheese at the end of cooking next time, or cut a pocket with a small opening.

Loved it! Kids and husband included. So easy. I followed the recipe exactly (I usually never do). I used seasoned Panko and low fat mayo. Very juicy. I baked them on a wire rack so the chicken crust remained crispy.

Delicious!  I used 1/2 c. mayo and pounded the breasts beforehand.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the fat content.

Quick and easy...moist and delicious.  Had a lot of mayo mixture and breadcrumbs left over so may use less next time.

The chicken was tasty and tender (I used strips instead of whole breasts), but using a wire rack instead of flat on the pan is important.  I servd with cheesy mixed veggies anthe cheese sauce was delicious on the chicken too!

Yum!   Hubby and I both loved this.   I used light mayo as that is what I had on hand.  I also cooked on a wire cooler on top of baking pan as suggested by other reviewers and added 2 tsp Italian seasoning to mayo mixture since I had herbed stuffing mix rather than Italian bread crumbs.  Came out perfectly crunchy...used fingers to coat chicken with mayo mixture to ensure parm stuck to chicken.  Not at all greasy...husband said, "Keep this recipe!"

Delicious.  I was also concerned about the mayonaise making it greasy, but it didn't. It just made it more tender. I paired it with "Garlic Mashed Potatoes Secret Recipe" from this site. DIVINE!! Before I had time to say "dinner's ready", my kids had finished it all off.  Will definitely be making it again.  Thankyou Barb

This is ABSOLUTELY delicious!!!! The only change I made was just a little salt and pepper in the mayonnaise mix. My boyfriend who does not usually care for a lot of chicken LOVED and wanted more of it and my daughter and I typically split one piece ate almost all of mine so I only got a couple bites but I will definitely be making this again and again!

This was very good!! Made Chicken parm with it. I made a few changes as other reviewers did, by adding some more spices to the mayo mixture. Also, baked it on a rack inside a cookie sheet. YUM!

This was an excellent recipe!  I made these tonight and took 3 chicken breasts and split them into 3 strips each. I threw in some extra seasoning into the mayo/parmesan cheese mixture and used crushed croutons mixed with bread crumbs. So good!  I did cook these on a wire cookie rack on top of a baking sheet with foil underneath (caught all the crumbs) and cooked them for 20 minutes on one side, flipped them, and cooked another 20 minutes on the other side. Next time I will use cooking spray, so they don't stick at all. The crunchy coating was outstanding! I never would have guessed using mayonnaise, but it turned out perfect! Thanks so much for sharing!

This was a good quick recipe. I used chicken tenderloins perfect size. My bread crumbs on the chicken were soggy eventhough I turned them. Maybe I will try to broil it just a bit to make it crunchy. But good otherwise.

Definitely worth a try! It's very simple to make and it's very moist and delicious.  I would give the recipe itself four stars but my Mom --who might I add dislikes chicken-- found room in her stomach for two whole pieces. I am confident that with a little spice customization, this recipe can easily hit five (or even six!) stars.

Finally made these! I cut my chicken into strips and used crushed corn flakes in place of the bread crumbs. The mayo gives it a little sweetness. I thought they were good, the kids wouldn't eat them. The corn flakes stayed on nicely while baking though...

This was great. I used chicken legs instead of breasts (because that's what i had thawed out) but i plan to make it again with breasts. My family LOVED them. This recipe will be a week night regular from now on!

Loved it! I added thyme, rosemary, parsley, and oregano to the mayo mix. I also did what others said and for the last 5 min broiled the chicken. Very tasty, my husband thought it was great too.

I have made this recipe at least 6 times in the last few months.  Family LOVES it!  Never leftovers.  I use ranch dressing instead of mayo, but follow recipe exactly and it's delicous.  Thanks Barb!

Not one of my favorite chicken recipes. It was a little soggy for my liking. May be better using Panko bread crumbs though with Italian seasoning added to it.

This chicken was very moist and definitely tender.  However, it tasted bland.  Maybe next time I'll use different bread crumbs to give it more flavor.  It was a quick and easy recipe that I'll use again with some tweaking.

I really enjoyed this.  Very moist and flavorful.  It is also great as a breading for fish,  When I did the fish though, I used an egg to coat instead of mayo.  Still fabulous.

Wow! I really think the secret is the mayo. Moist is the keyword (and no brining)! I also used the cookie rack.  Any flavors can be added to the crumbs, but the timing and temp were perfect.  Thank you for the only way I'll bake breasts from now on.

GREAT breading!  Definitely use tenderloin cuts, though, or pound with a meat mallet.  It's been with thin cuts of chicken.

I have made this recipe several times now, and each time it turned out great!  The only change I made was to add some Italian seasoning to the mayo/cheese mixture.  Every one in my family loves this, including my very picky 12 year old!  This is now in my recipe box listed as a favourite!

Good flavor and moist.  I misread the directions and mixed the coating into the mayo.  It was kind of a paste on the outside of the chicken.  It was very good despite my mistake.  It is hard to screw this up.  Very simple and easy.

I wish I would have found this recipe sooner.  Great flavor, quick and easy to make.  I did follow another's advice and I seasoned the mayo mix with some basil, oregano, and thyme, I know my wife likes food to be flavorful so I had to add these ingredients.  Chicken comes out tender and delicious.

Easy and actually stayed quite moist for baked chicken.  I was skeptical about the mayo, but like others said, I couldn't taste it.  I used lite mayo and added thyme, oregano, and Italian seasoning.  I didn't have Italian bread crumbs, so I used garlic and herb.  One problem I had was the crust sticking to the pan. Other than that, it was great, and my husband enjoyed it very much. Thanks for the recipe! I'm sure I'll make it again.

This was great. I was serving this with a spanish romesco sauce so I left out the italina seasoning and added in spanish paparika. I also used fat free mayo and it tasted great. Nice and moist

This was great!  I was a little worried about the mayo b/c we don't eat mayo, but we couldn't taste it.  I'll definitely make this again and it will become our new staple for making italian breaded chicken.  I did cook on a wire rack as suggested and turned over 5 minutes before the end, which made it crisp.

I didn't have chicken breasts, so I used chicken tenderloins.  I didn't have enough mayo, so I added ricotta cheese.  Also, I didn't have bread crumbs, so I used finely crushed up Cheerios!  *lol*  This was soooooo moist and delicious!!!  I didn't have garlic (haven't gone grocery shopping in a few weeks, obviously!*lol) so I added other spices... Oregano, basil, paprika (just a dash), and black pepper.  Seriously yummy!  This is my new base recipe for baked chicken.  :)

This chicken is delicious!!!  My family raved about it!  I did take the suggestion of a few others and used Seasoned Croutons instead of bread crumbs, and it was soooo crunchy good.  I also badked mine on a rack on the cookie sheet and turned it over half way thru!  It was very brown and crunchy!!! Thank you for the great recipe!

This chicken was very good and easy enough that my husband could make it. :) The crust actally stayed fairly intact while cooking and I was surprised that the mayo didn't reduce to a puddle of oil in the bottom of the pan. The chicken was very tender. DH made the recipe as is, and it was very good that way. I served it with salad, pasta and marinara sauce but I have to remember that I don't really like red sauces all that much at all so next time it will be some other type of sauce. ^-^  Thank you very much for sharing the recipe!

Very good and the chicken was very moist. I didn't find that the bottom got mushy like other reviewers. Will make a gaine. even my 2 and 4 year old cleaned their plate.

Delicious!  I cooked it with the Green Bean and Mushroom Medley and the Easy Scalloped Potatoes.  Use some ranch dressing for dipping the chicken.  Definitely a regular on our dinner schedule.

I could not get the mayonnaise mixture to stick to the chicken.  There must be a fix for this.  Being a new cook, unless it's stated in the recipe, I don't do it.  It was very good however.

I gave this a 5 even though I modified it a little.  Pretty much the same as everyone else did.  I added some basil, parsley, salt, pepper and onion powder to the mayo.  Didn't have any parm so I omitted it (that's why I used the salt).  I would have put it on a rack to cook but I don't have one so it went on a cookie sheet.  The bottom breading wasn't crisp, but it wasn't awful either.  My chicken breasts were pretty thick so I cooked it for 30min and it was perfect. This is an awesome starter recipe and there are so many things you could do with it..hence the 5 stars. Served it with pasta and alfredo.  My son loved it as I'm sure my husband will too..oh yeah and it was VERY moist!

I did not care much for this. First, the quantities are too high (especially the bread crumbs and parm, you will throw out a LOT of it) and the cooking time too low. Chicken does NOT bake in 20 min, at least not well done... Other than that it was just ok, bland and not very tender.

These work well when using Panko breadcrumbs, and baked on a cookie cooling rack (placed on a baking sheet). They stay nice and crispy. I used a bit of dijon mustard in with my mayo mixture and it gave it a nice flavor. Baking time should be increased to 35 minutes for larger and thicker breasts.

The taste of this recipe is wonderful, but I only give it 4 stars because even with flipping the chicken midway through the cooking process, it still didn't get as crispy as I would like. Some parts were a bit soggy and I could have cooked it longer, but then I was afraid the chicken would get tough. Overall the taste was excellent and my kids loved it!

This was very moist and juicy chicken, but I would agree that it needs a few more spices and definetly should be baked on a rack over a baking sheet so that both sides of the chicken come out crispy. The kids absolutely loved it!

This was a great recipe. I was a little worried because I didn't have any sauce to serve it with, but it came out of the oven and didn't even need any because it was so moist and flavorful. I included in the mayonnaise mixture some seasoning salts that I got from a local steakhouse - I think it really helped the flavor. Very good chicken dish - I'll definitely keep this in mind to make again.

I don't know what all the fuss is about. I made this recipe to the letter and it came out not crispy at all, except around the edges. It was also bland. The first thing my boyfriend did after he bit into it was grab the BBQ sauce out of the fridge. Also, it took closer to about 35-40 minutes to bake. This would probably be good with all the different changes the other reviewers made, but as is, I was not impressed.

Super easy and tasted good.  I baked it on a cookie rack over a cookie sheet as suggested by another reviewer and I wish I'd have thought to spray the sheet with Pam or line it with foil - clean up would've been a lot easier.  I didn't have italian bread crumbs so I just used regular with about a tablespoon of italian seasoning mixed in.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Very tasty!  I made this to go on some focaccia bread I made for chicken sandwiches.  I spread the bread with some pesto, topped it with some fresh spinach, roasted red peppers, and mozzarella (the only kind of cheese I had on hand, and put it in the broiler for a few minutes.  We put the chicken on the bread right from the oven and this made for one GOOD n' toasty chicken sandwich!  I will definitely return to this chicken recipe again and again for lots of different meals!

I made this with dark meat.  I seasoned the mayonnaise with italian seasoning and a pinch of salt and pepper.  I used seasoned bread crumbs (all I had) and only about half of the mayonnaise mixture.  (I was worried about the fat content and don't care for mayonnaise)  Cooked it on a rack turning halfway through, then broiled for the last 2 minutes.  Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  I couldn't taste the mayo at all.  The family loved it!

This was an excellent excellent starting point for a recipe.  I did make some changes, which is the only reason I didn't give it five stars.

I added italian seasoning and kosher salt and used italian style panko bread crumbs (Italian-Japanese fusion anyone?) and then put it on a rack over a pan, and sprayed it with olive oil spray.  I was going to broil it for a minute or two like another reviewer suggested, but forgot.  It was great without crisping up the breading, but I'll try it that way next time anyway.

My family DID NOT like this.  They were trying to be nice...but eventually they put their unfinished pieces back and ate the sides I made instead.  I did everything accordingly, and it was just ot our cup of tea.  I must have been the mayonaise...I don't think it and chicken belong together.

yummmmmy!  I do change up the cheeses now and again-if its shredded its ok i just use less than a 1/4 cup, more like half that but mostly its my method thats slightly different, I use a basting/pastry brush to "paint" the chicken with the mayo, just seems easier for me to do one side, put into breadcrumb mix painted side down, then paint the other side, flip, coat and then bake, no wasted mayo  and it's the best oven fried chicken ever! --  :) A Great recipe!

I'm sorry that I couldn't rate this a 5. The chicken was not crispy & I didn't enjoy the flavor. I had to actually put them under the broiler to crispy them up. More was thrown away than eaten. I'm sorry I didn't like it, but I was hopeful. Dawn

These turned out really great..I followed the advice of another reviewer and turned them the last 5 minutes and they were crispy and golden brown all around! I did use light mayo to cut down on the fat and they were delicious.

The chicken was very moist and tender.  We did however find, that it was a bit bland. It requires crushed garlic and not powder and perhaps a bit of basil and onion flavor.  It is a great starter recipe and I will use the base coating again as it is this coating that makes the chicken moist and tender. Thank you for sharing

Good but no different in taste then an easy chicken parmesan.  Could not really dip the chicken in the mayo so I spread a thin layer on each piece of chicken.  We thought the chicken was a little dry which was suprising since the mayo should have made it more moist or so I would have thought.  Doubt I would try again.

Great recipe! I just wanted to share that I made this recipe exactly as written the day before a party. After baking and letting them cool, I placed them in overlapping rows in an aluminum pan and refrigerated overnight.  The day of the party I used a 300 degree oven to warm them gently and they were still fabulous!

LOVE IT!!!  It's my new favorite chicken recipe.  I don't make a lot of chicken because I often find chicken dishes to be slightly bland... but this ones great.  Moist and tender and full of flavor.  It's also REALLY EASY!  Love it!

This was a delicious chicken recipe! The mayo mixture helps to keep the chicken moist during the cooking process. I make this for my family quite often, and they always love it! I reccomend this chicken to anyone, plus it's very quick and easy to make!

my husband really liked this recipe, i thought it was good but not as good as i had hoped. i did substitute most things though: miracle whip for mayo (personal preference), shredded cheese instead of grated (none on hand), crushed croûtons  instead of bread crumbs (none on hand). overall it was pretty moist and tender, and the crouton breading came out just as good as breadcrumbs.  next time i'll try italian dressing as a marinade for more of a kick.

Really great! Fast and easy too!! Chicken is SOOOO moist and crispy on the outside. I used Italian style breadcrumbs and all the seasonings listed and it was perfect. Great with potatoes! Will be making again!

Used cornbread stuffing instead and half sour cream / half mayo instead simply because I didn't have the ingredients, and it turned out delicious!

I thought this was great. The chicken came out soooooooo soft. I added a little bit of herbs de provence and a bit of sea salt and I served it on a pasta with marinara. My wife and I both loved it.

I made this chicken last night, on a whim, and it was delish! I made chicken thighs and had slather the mayo on with a spoon! It was a tad messy, and i had to lower the temp a cook a biT longer, to keep the outside from burning,  but well worth it. It wasn't really greasy and it was sooooo tender and juicy!

Very, very good and so simple. I used it as a side dish with lasagne over the holidays. Also had a Mandarin orange and avacado green salad. My out of town relatives raved about the dinner especially the chicken. Will make again often.

This is a great quick and easy recipe that your family will love.
I used 1/2 cup of light mayo, a full tsp of garlic powder and a generous 1/2 cup of parm cheese. I pounded the chicken breasts so they were not too thick and rolled the chicken in 3/4 of caesar style croutons that I crushed.
My family loved this tender, flavorful chicken and I will make it again.

This recipe is simple and very good.  I usually pan fry my cutlets in olive oil because my family prefers the fried taste.  I hate frying and always feel guilty about all the added fat.  These were just as good as the fried plus much less mess.  I flipped 1/2 way through baking to crisp both sides evenly.  I made these for company and every piece was eaten. A definate keeper.

Very easy to pull together with ingredients already on hand. It is exactly what you would expect a 30 minute chicken recipe to result in. I broiled for the last 5 mins as well. Great for our 2 and 3 year olds!

This made some very tender and tasty ckn tenders. I didn't measure anything but everything came out soo good. I used zesty bread crumbs for some spice and added some italian seasoning...very yummy and kid friendly, which is a great bonus!

I really enjoyed this receipe, it was a great hit with my family.  For bread crumbs I used garlic crutons and smashed it to make the breading.  While preparing the crust, I also added Italian seasoning.

THIS WAS REALLY QUICK TO COOK WHICH IS A PLUS. I DIDN'T HAVE ANY BREAD CRUMBS so i used a pack of ritz crackers with italian seasonings or any dried herbs i had on hand. did quit well. i think i may have added too much mayo on each slice because it was kinda sticky. not sure until i try it with the bread crumbs. overall these were pretty good.

This was good. The chicken does turn out juicy. We liked a thinner coat of the mayo mixture, rather than a thick coat. I'll probably make it again, it was so quick!

Moist, tender, tasty, and very easy, what more could you ask for! My guy is not a chicken eater but will occasionally eat a boneless, skinless chicken breast and he really liked this so I am happy. I could also see me smothering this in a marinara sauce and serving with a pasta of some sort. Thank you for sharing the recipe Barb.

This is an easy, delicious recipe. My family said that it was the best chicken dish I have made. I did end up adding 3/4 teas. onion powder as well as the garlic. Husband suggested that I only add 1/2 cup mayo and then 1/4 cup dijon mustard. Who knows- I'll give it a try.

The moistist chicken I have ever had. I would leave out the italian spices next time..and use plain bread crums. I cooked 8 chicken legs. I cooked them for 30 minutes. And covered them with foil and cooked them for 4 more minutes.I used my dands to apply the mayo. mix with real parmesan cheese..not the grated kind.
