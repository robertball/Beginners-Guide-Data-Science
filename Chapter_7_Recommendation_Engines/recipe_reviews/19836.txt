This has been a hit everytime I make it.  My family loves it. One mistake I made ended up being a great change to the recipe.  I accidentally bought lemon pudding mix instead of vanilla and it added that extra tartness that everyone said was missing. I also made the icing while the cake was baking and put it in the fridge to firm up until the cake was cool enough to be iced. I find it is not as unstable.  I also cut the water to the gelatin to 1 cup which also made a difference.  This has been a big winner at summer family cookouts.  I am from Houston TX and I don't think you could experience a hotter more humid summer. That being said, I make sure that I take extra care when I plan on taking it to any function in the summer months.  This cake is better if made the night before and refrigerated until the next day, as it gives it time to set and firm up.  If I am transporting it I use an insulated carrier (fits a 9x13 pan) I also understand they make one for layer cakes or I make sure it stays in the ice chest until ready to serve. I also improvised before by putting it in a box and wrapping it in two huge bath towels with zip lock bags of ice packed around it.  This cake is definitely meant to be set out when you are ready to serve it. Some might find this as being too much effort, but I love the recipe and I don't mind taking the time.

I made this cake for Memorial Day Weekend for our family.  It was great, and everyone loved it!  Perfect for summer--light and refreshing.  My sister-in-law requested the recipe.  I used a straw to poke holes in the cake, and only used 1 cup hot water with the lemon jello to pour over the cake.  Everything else I kept the same, and it turned out great!

I made this twice and got rave reviews both times. Next time however, I might try adding real lemon juice or extract instead of the gelatin to the topping. It tasted a little too artificial this last time.

Amazingly delicious!  I don't know what that reviewer was talking about! How would you even make the topping WITHOUT the PUDDING? Are they insane?? Perfect, don't change a thing!! I will make this cake again and again and maybe even again after that!

My brother loves anything orange, so I decided to make this recipe for our family July 4th cookout, with a couple of modifications. I used orange gelatin and only 1 cup of hot water for the cake, and lemon pudding and orange gelatin for the topping. I decorated it with canned mandarin oranges. It was very moist and would have been soggy
with any more water in it. It was very attractive with the orange icing and tasted refreshing, my family liked it.

This was great!  Cool, lemony, a snap to make.  And, the best part, no expensive, exotic ingredients!  This is a big hit at our house, both for family and company.

I've been using this recipe for years!  I love it!  Another tip:  I have made this recipe using yellow or white cake and orange jell-o, strawberry jell-o or raspberry jell-o.  Garnishing (Depending on the jell-o flavor) with either mandarin oranges or strawberry slices, or rapberries - it is an excellent touch.  I've NEVER had left overs!

My husband really liked this cake but I was expecting it to be a little more tangy.  I may play with the ingredients a bit. Maybe leave the pudding mix out of the topping.

If you love lemon this cake is for you. I made it for the first time for my co-workers today and it was a big hit. I used 1/2 cup hot water and 1/2 cup cold water. I also used a straw to poke holes in the cake. I mixed the milk, lemon gelatin and lemon pudding in a bowl and refrigerated until i was ready to serve at work, then I folded in the whipped topping and spread it over the cake. So light and refreshing.

I was thrilled with this cake, as was everyone @ work. I used all Lemon: cake,pudding,Jello-O. Cut the water for gelatin to 1 cup.  Let topping set in refrig while cake/gelatin chilled. covered with topping,chilled overnight. I can't wait to try this in all the flavors that others mentioned. It was easy to make, tasted great! Not too sweet. I will make this many times. Thanks for sharing.

This is almost a very good recipe.  I reserved enough cake batter to make an 8" round cake in addition to the 9x13.  I do this habitually because my plastic lid will touch the frosting otherwise.  The little thin 8" round cake was better than the deeper 9x13. We would like this cake better made in layers than as a sheet cake.  I took it to a potluck and it looked so plain that people thought it was just a yellow cake with some coolwhip on top.  The frosting could use extra lemon flavor, so I would add extra lemon gelatin or lemon zest.  It could use some color or garnish.  I cut the leftover cake (hardly anyone tried it) into squares.  I cut the cake squares into two layers, spread orange curd in between the layers and it was wonderful then. I will make this recipe again as a layer cake,using double the amount of (enhanced) frosting or using lemon pie filling in between the layers, since I likely will not find such a bargain on orange curd again.

I liked this cake a lot and all the people who I served it to also liked it- BUT- I do agree with a previous reviewer who said that it had a bit of an artificial taste. In order to get rid of that, I think that I would add A LOT of fresh lemon juice and zest to the batter and the frosting. Other than that, the cake was very moist and tasty.

Wisely checked reviews and modified slightly; less water in gelatin and used lemon instant pudding instead. Delicious frosting!

Easy and refreshing, but I agree with previous cook who stated that topping tasted artificial.  Next time I am going to omit lemon gelatin and add lemon zest to vanilla pudding & whipped topping mixture.

I have made this cake twice, for my husband and also for co-workers.  I was asked by a couple of people for the recipe and was told by a couple of people it was the best cake they've ever tasted.  I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe. It is now one of my favorite cakes.  Plus, it's so easy to make.

This was my second time making this cake. I reduced the amount of water to one cup (1/2 boiling & 1/2 cold), to mix with first jello box. Much better amount this time-no soggy cake. Took about two hours to fully set up & be ready for the topping. As for the topping; I only had lime jello left and vanilla pudding—WOW!!! That was an AMAZING change! Thanks to everyone sharing their tips!!

VERY lemony. Almost too lemony for me. It still turned out OK though, and it's a nice treat in the 100+ degree weather we had. Sprinkled some sweetened coconut flakes on top which added a nice touch. If I were to make it again, I'd use plain white cake.

Made this for Easter.  To add a little spring.  I made it bunt cake style.   Used strawberry jello and sliced strawberries around the top.  Also sliced the cake and put a layer of the frosting in the middle.  It was a big hit.  I have made several jello cakes but only cool whip for topping.  This was very good.

I made this up tonight and really wanted to like this cake. I think it came out just fine, but I think the problem is that I am just not a fan of poke cakes. Maybe if I had just used one cup of water I would have liked it a bit better. Perhaps this will be better tomorrow?

Excellent recipe, very easy to make.  I did note that when using Duncan Hines cake mix, the cake towards the middle was a little too moist.  Next time I will use a different kind of cake make or use less of the gelatin.  Also for a different twist, I used pineapple jello and added lemon juice to the frosting-wonderful recipe!

We loved this cake.  The topping was the best...I used lite whipped cream, sugar free jello mix, and sugar free pudding mix.  I didn't think it tasted artificial in the least.  Next time for the cake I will use a brand name, not the generic, because it isn't as moist as Duncan Hines or Pilsbury.

This was wonderful.  My husband and I loved it, especially.  It's almost addictive!  After it was gone, we kept opening the fridge hoping it was still there..lol.   Just great served cold; very refreshing, although I do agree with the poster below who noted that the results might be better using and extract (and grated lemon peel?hmm..) instead of the gelatin mix in the frosting.  I would recommend trying it as written first.  It's really delicious, easy and inexpensive.  Thank you, Caroline..this is a keeper!

This recipe turned out great. After baking the cake, I made holes in it with a straw as was suggested. Instead of using 1 c. of hot/cold water with the gelatin, I only added 1/2 c. each. I used a mini funnel and poured small amounts of the gelatin mixture into all the holes of the cake. Since some mentioned the cake being soggy, I didn't add all of the liquid, but at least 3/4.
For the frosting, I didn't add any gelatin because of the metallic taste others had noticed, but I did put in the juice of one large lemon. Perfect. 
I'm going to make this again for a potluck in May when we'll need something light and cool.

This cake is very lemony & moist, which is great!  However, it does taste artificial and has a metallic aftertaste, which is why I wouldn't make it again.

When you pour the water/gelatin mixture over the cake, it makes the cake soggy. Even when you chill it for a while, the texture is not spongy enough. The taste is good, but the texture is strange and not good in my book.

Very good.  I added some lemon extract to both the cake and icing.  Please do NOT reduce the jello for the cake.  Keep it at 2 cups.  I reduced and had regret it.

Ok, I haven't made this though I'm sure its good, but when I look for a lemon cake recipe (or any "cake recipe") I want a real recipe not something that calls for a boxed cake. There are good recipes like this but if thats what I want I will search for one specifically. 

I sorry, it may seem petty, but I just keep coming up with recipes that call for a cake mix. If I had a box cake I would make it and not look for recipes :(

This is a blast from my past.  My mom always made this at Easter.  I made it using lime jello and didn't add jello to the topping just because my mom made it that way.  Sugar free jello/pudding tasted great.  Couldn't tell the difference.

I added Lemon Instant pudding rather than the vanilla pudding in the recipe.   It was fabulous!!!   I'm glad I ate the first piece because it was gone before I could get a second!  The cake was moist without being heavy or doughy,  The lemon flavor was perfect,  not to strong or over-powering which I had been afraid it might be, seeing how many lemony ingredients went into it.  It was simple and fast to assemble.  This is a keeper!

Wow!  I was trying to find a recipe for a dessert that did not include chocolate (I gave up chocolate for Lent this year - SCARY!)  This recipe was perfect, way more delicious than expected.  Melts in your mouth and disappears fast!  Make sure you allow time for it to cool in the refrigerator...  the longer it chills, the better the texture.

I'm a huge fan of the Jello poke cakes anyway because I love refrigerator cakes. This one is especially good.  I did only use 1/2 cup cold water for the Jello mixture, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly using the Jello brand sugar free products and lite whipped topping.  Tastes great!

I've been making this cake for over 30 years. The recipe was in a Jell-O recipe book. You can also make it with lime Jell-O or strawberry cake mix with strawberry Jell-O. You can use your imagination and combine any flavors you like. The cake is so moist and my family loves it. According to one reviewer, the cake is soggy from pouring the gelatin over it. Well, the trick is to inject the gelatin into the cake. I used to use a very pointy eyedropper but today I use a a meat injector. Takes a little longer but it works great.

i used lemon pudding instead of vanilla because i read the instructions wrong but it worked out great. i forgot to add the 2nd gelatin to the frosting and it was great. i will definitly make this again the same way i did this time. i almost ate the whole cake myself! o yeah i used french vanilla cool whip topping instead of the original it gives it a deeper flavor!

This is my son-in-law's favorite cake, so I made it for his birthday this weekend.   If you're in a hurry, Cool Whip will suffice for the icing.

This was a pretty good cake ... adding the extra ingredients helps take away that 'boxed cake' flavor. It's light and refreshing and would be good for a dessert at a bbq for a dessert that doesn't take much time or effort. I would make it again but next time try it with the lime jello.

Made this recipe with strawberry jello, and it came out great.  I did take the advise of other reviewers and only used one cup of water with the jello.  The cake was awesome and the kids, and the hubby really enjoyed it.  Will try this recipe again using other jello flavors!

Quick, easy and DELICIOUS!

Like another reviewer, I used yellow cake and strawberry jello instead. The cake turned out perfectly - Moist, light and not too sweet or rich!

To save even more time next time, I'll try using strawberry flavored Cool Whip for the topping.

i made a strawberry version with yellow cake, strawberry jello, and vanilla pudding. everyone loved it. i brought it to a birthday party and a family dinner. it makes a really good summer cake. the only negative is that the jello mix makes the whipped topping kind of harden.

Tasted good, simple and easy. There was WAY too much icing (I didn't even end up using it all on the cake).  I will probably make this again, but not for a while... very rich.

OUTSTANDING!  I made this for my father in law who has a heart condition -- I used sugar free jello, fat free pudding, fat free cool whip, and made the cake with applesauce instead of oil.  Needless to say, he alone at 3 pieces after a huge dinner, and the rest of us had 2 each!  A GREAT receipe, easy and perfect for the summer.  This was one of the best recipes I've found!  Am already planning to make it again, and again, and again, and again..................

This was super moist if not almost soggy. The lemon flavor was almost too much for this cake. I agree with another posted who recommended using a different flavor cake mix and/or jello. I most likely will not make again.

This was okay.  I guess I'm not a big fan of poke cakes.  I think they are more wet and soggy than what I would call moist.  But this was a refreshing taste.

This was so good. Brought it to a friend's dinner. We started of with a piece each, all six of us went back for second helpings, then ended up finishing it off by eating it right out of the pan with forks!!

The cake part of this recipe was really good, but I did not care for the icing. The pudding mix did not go well here. I think it would have been a whole lot better to just omit the pudding mix. I give the icing two thumbs down.

This was a fantastic recipe and the cake turned out awesome!  The only change I made was using lemon flavored pudding in the topping instead of vanilla, to enhance the lemon flavor!  It was a huge hit with my family and I will definitely be making this again and again!!!

We loved it! 
Instead of Cool Whip (or the like) I used real whipping cream, and omitted the milk. I whipped the cream first, then added the pudding and jello. 
For esthetics, I grated lemon rind on top. 
Yum!

This cake was so easy and delicious! Based on other reviews (plus my lack of fully reading the ingredients list :-) ), I only used 1 box of gelatin to pour on the cake and didn’t put the other box in the icing as the directions call for. For the icing, I used a box of lemon pudding with the milk and cool whip and it was perfect!

This one is another keeper!  Moist and very flavourful.  Delicious!
I used the suggestion of someone that used the lemon-flavoured pudding rather than the vanilla pudding.  GREAT suggestion!

Also, I added two egg yolks for extra "like homemade than a box cake mix" texture.  

Instead of Cool Whip, I used whipped cream to make the icing/topping. It may be a few more calories, but we don't have dessert often.
  The family enjoyed this ending to a fine dinner.

I had my neighbors over for dinner and served this cake for dessert.  I made the changes that HILLY29 did: lemon instant pudding instead of vanilla, one cup of water instead of two.  My guests LOVED the cake and all asked for the recipe.  One even said that this cake is now her new "birthday cake"--the cake that she will request for her birthday.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the directions exactly and although it was lemony and moist, most of my family said it was too "wet".  I could try making it again using less water, but I'd prefer to make something else.

I just made this yesterday for a family members birthday as her favourite flavour is lemon! It turned out really well and everyone enjoyed it. I used lemon pudding instead of vanilla which turned out well. Next time I probably won't put the jello into the whipped topping, it leaves a bit of an after taste. Overall this was a good dessert and very easy to make!

This was my first cake. I made this cake, and I LOVED it. The frosting's a bit sweet... but still it was good. 
I really like the jello inside the holes in the top. :)

This was good - simple and refreshing.  I added one cup of boiling water to both boxes of lemon Jello and poured that over the cake.  For the frosting, I used milk, Cool Whip, instant vanilla pudding and the juice and zest of 2 lemons.  Yum!

I'm a lemon lover / citrus lover, and I absolutely want to try this.

But how to make lemon gelatin mix, if there is not lemon flavoured? Also any substitute for vanilla pudding mix? Thise items are pretty hard to find here in my country :)

This is delicious!  I'm not much of a baker at all but this came out perfectly for me. It's very moist and the cream topping is wonderful!  It's light and refreshing and perfect for a summer dessert. I will definitely make this again. It would be fun to change up the flavors as well. Next time I'm thinking strawberry :)

I made this cake and took it to work to celebrate a co-worker's birthday. Our office is pretty small, but by the end of the day the cake was gone! :D It was light tasting, refreshing, and very flavorful. The cake's pretty foolproof and easy to make too. Everyone wanted the recipe! For a box cake, I don't think it gets any better than this. Yummy! :)

Simple to make and great for a springtime dessert.  It was moist and had great flavor.  I love lemons and added lemon zest to the cake batter.  I also used lemon pudding in the frosting instead of the vanilla as many suggested. Will, for sure, make this again.

I was a bit disappointed with this cake.  I'd enjoyed this cake years ago when a friend prepared it using raspberry jello and a Cool Whip topping.  This was good but seemed to lack flavor for me.

My mom has been making this for as long as I can remember. However, we never made it with lemon jell-o... reds or greens were our favorites. Also, leaving the gelatin out of the frosting makes for a creamy complement to any other flavor of gelatin you might use in the cake. My husband doesn't like cake, but he eats the heck out of this. :)

While I have to admit being partial to anything "lemony," this recipe is absolutely to die for!!!! Not only was it fast and easy to make, it was very light and refreshing as well...perfect dessert after a big meal or picnic! Can't remember when I've had so many compliments on a dessert! I would highly recommend this!!!!

I made this last night and it was pretty good. I think it would be BEST on a really hot summer's day.  The reason I gave it a 4-star it's because it was not as 'rich' tasting as I imagined, maybe next time I will add a bit of sugar to it, I did add about 1 teaspoon of vanilla, thought it gave it a bit of a zing! I also used EXTRA creamy whipped topping. Over all, it was good for the family plus real easy to make. PS, if you're pressed for time and want to eat dessert before it's too late, put it in the freezer for about 15-20 minutes. :-)

I love this cake. I made it for a Pot Luck at work and everybody loved it. The pudding makes it super moist. I did used 1/2 hot water and 1/2 cold water, like somebody here suggested and it intensified the lemon flavor, which it was great. The second time I made it I used only half of the lemon gelatin box and it made the topping taste less sweet which it complemented very well the moist cake...very Summery! Thanks for this great recipe. ;)

OoooooYuuuuum. Here's the changes I made and will make in the future. Used lemon pudding mix instead of vanilla and cut the water to 1 cup. Best if it sits over night.

My grandmother used to make a version of this recipe.  But she would use lime jello with the lemon cake, and instead of a vanilla icing she would use lemon pudding, which killed some of the strong lemon flavor and along with the lime the lemon flavor is not as strong as some have complained about.

I have made this cake a couple of times. The first time was exactly as written, and I found it to be just "okay." The flavor was kind of strong, and we didn't really care for the frosting. The second time, I used a vanilla cake mix, and 2 boxes of raspberry Jell-O with 1.5 cups of hot water (cooled). For the frosting, I used raspberry Jell-O mixed with 1 cup of milk (until dissolved), blended that with 8 oz of cream cheese (until smooth) and then folded in the Cool Whip....topped with ½'ed fresh raspberries. That one was better, but still not great. I'll keep searching for the perfect frosting for this cake.

This Cake good.  However I like it better if you use a white cake mix, and use strawberry or raspberry  jello.  I omitted the pudding completely.  And used real whipping cream, so much better.  The lemon was to strong.

I have been making a version of a jello cake for years, but this recipe is the BEST of all jello cakes. I made this for my husband's birthday and everyone absolutely loved it! It was so easy and so YUMMY! Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this cake, following some of the suggestions and it turned out great.  I used sugar free jello and sugar free lemon pudding for a little less guilty treat.  The whole family raved over it.  This is a definite repeater.

This recipe seems wrong for the  ref lemon cream cake  ,where does it say to hold back  some jello powder to mix with the pudding for the topping? And won't the cake get soggy with so much jello being poured over it ? 2 cups of gelatin is lots ..

This was a big hit at a group gathering as well as the left overs at book study the next day. Everyone wanted the recipe.
Only change is I used my fresh squeezed Meyer lemon juice instead of all water. Panicked afterwards that it would be too lemony...but it wasn’t.  Did forget the lemon zest on top...next time I’ll remember!

For the Hollidays, i added Orange Jello to the cake, and added a 1/4 tsp of lemon extract.  and for the top i did as directed to do, but added some orange extract to the lemon jello, pudding, and Cool Whip.

But i made it on many occasions, and everyone wants the recipe!!!!

So it is you and your staff, that i have made my own cookbook, just from your recipes!  oh course you get the credit.

I will not make this again.  It was a moist cake but the lemon jello and vanilla pudding mixes added in the recipe make it all overly sweet and give it a fake lemon taste.  I was disappointed.

This was absolutely wonderful!!! I was concerned at first because I’ve never used Jell-O with a cake and I don’t really care for lemon but this was certainly an exception. We all love it!!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I’ll definitely be making it again and again.

I made this as directed with 1 exception. I used 1 cup hot water to mix jello. 
I let it sit in fridge over night, made the frosting and poured  over the top. Back in the fridge for the entire day. Made some blueberry sauce to serve with it. Took to work that night and it was gone in about 30 minutes.

My favorite easy cake.
I have made about 10 times. I keep adding lemon. 
Is awesome as is but I reduced water to one cup also with jello. Was afraid after reading reviews to add 2 cups on the cake.
I add more sugar free lemon jello,  lemon zest and lemon extract to the cake and the topping. 
Thanks for this. Recipe.
Just tried everything in orange. Is great too. The lemon is lighter and the orange taste a bit like an orange creamsicle. 

Excellent recipe!

I added fresh squeezed lemon juice for half of all the water. Next time, even though more involved, I'd like to make  the pudding from scratch.  Also, in the future, I will be sure to pour the (instant) pudding on more quickly, before it starts setting up. 
This dessert was a hit with everyone, including my husband and my family that came for Easter dinner. I made two  8x8 pans instead of  one 13x9  and took the 2nd pan to a sew day with friends. Luscious lemony flavor without being overly tart. It was extra delicious chilled from the refrigerator. Will make it again!

I followed the instructions exactly and it turned out very well. 
I did use sugar free Jell-O and sugar free pudding, but you can't tell.
Tasted the pudding mix before I added the CoolWhip, and I may use that between layers when I make it again.

This is a very tasty combination of economical ingredients you can store in the pantry and freezer. I actually liked it better 3 days after I baked it, as the topping firmed up and the cake was more moist. (Like other reviewers, I used 1 cup of water instead of 2). A keeper!

This was very popular at Easter!
I took other folks’ advice and made the jello with 1/2 cup each hot and cold water and I used lemon jello instead of vanilla.  Was delicious!  I will be making it again :-)

Absolutely yummy. Used lemon pudding. Cut down water a bit adding in the juice from 1 lemon with it. I served it at Easter the day after it was made. Ate every bit and still tasty day 3.

Excellent! I didn't add the jello to the pudding/cool whip topping only because I only had one box which I used to pot over the cake.

Should have read the reviews. Cake was too soggy and wouldn't cut in pieces like regular cake. Also took 2 days for icing to stiffen up. Probably will not make it again,  Very disappointed.

This cake was absolutely delicious.  I used lemon pudding instead of vanilla and it did give it a little more tang!  Husband and guests loved it.  Would definitely make this one again.

Used 1 c hot water in gelatin, and lemon instead of vanilla pudding.  Garnished with fresh raspberries and served to 15 ladies.  Nice, but nothing to rave about.

I loved the idea of Lemon Cake.  So I was excited.  I found a recipe on here to make a cake from scratch and that was great.
I loved how this frosting sounded but mine did not turn out :(
I did not want to use cool whip, so I made my own from heavy cream, and after that it was down hill lol  it turned into liquid after I added the pudding mix and milk.  where you suppose to make the pudding or just use the powder of the pudding mix?

I didn’t make any changes, but next time I think I’ll try lemon pudding instead of the vanilla for an even more lemony taste. 
I was also thinking you could use a white cake mix and strawberry jello will make a delicious dessert.

This was so easy to make and turned out delicious!  I used homemade whipped cream which always tastes better than anything from the store!  Because this cake is refrigerated, it has a cool, summery taste - but it would be wonderful any time of year!

Overall the cake and topping were delicious!  The cake did seem a little bit too moist, so when I make it again I will use only 1 cup total instead of 2 cups with the gelatin on the cake.  I didn’t have instant vanilla pudding on hand for the topping, so I used instant lemon instead and it was VERY good!  My family loved this cake!

Very good and light dessert.  Needs a little bit of tart in the frosting.

Before making I read several reviews both pro and con. I bought all the ingredients but did not use them all. Recipe calls for two packages of lemon jello but I only used the one to poor over the cake and I only used about 34 of it. I was worried all of it would make the cake too soggy. When I made the frosting with the CoolWhip combined with vanilla pudding I omitted the second package of lemon jello. I did refrigerate for two hours before serving. It came out wonderful. Not too sweet not too lemony and perfectly moist. It was served after a heavy brunch meal of quiche, crab cakes, fried chicken, shrimp salad, etc. Everyone remarked how refreshing it tasted after a heavy meal. Glad I made the few small changes.

It was delicious but I wouldn't pour the jello in the cake after it was baked.  It made it a little too gooey.  Otherwise, it was fantastic!

I thought this cake was fantastic ! I followed the directions mostly, but I added lemon zest to the topping.  This is sure to be summer favorite from now on.

I made this cake for a family member last week. Everyone loved it! This cake is light in taste and texture. So delicious. I am making it again next week for celebration. I'm thinking of trying it with strawberry.

Good recipe.  Pretty moist.   The cake mix wasn’t as lemony as I would have liked but the jello helped a lot.   Will use lemon extract in the cake mix next time.  The rest was tasty and lemony

Wow!  This is a keeper.  Reminds me of Key Lime Pie in flavor.  The only change I made was one cup of hot water only to the jello for pouring over the cake.  The frosting was perfect.  Will be making this often.  Thank You for the recipe

I make this all the time but I use lime jello in the cake. I also use lemon pudding with a package of dream whip following the directions on box for frosting. So it is really a lemon lime jello cake family members can't get enough of it.

I have made this exact cake over and over for everything from birthdays to summer parties, and showers. Everyone goes crazy over it....especially men!  They ask me to give the recipe to their wives.  I tell them I'll give YOU the recipe and YOU make it for your wife....it's that easy!  I have done it with strawberry cake, & Jello with French vanilla pudding. Or even pineapple cake &Jello and vanilla pudding.  So many options!

We made this with lime jello for St. Patrick's Day. The recipe is very difficult to decipher and the list of ingredients is confusing. Be sure to read it out loud repeatedly to get it right.

I've made this twice now for our weekly Saturday dinners at our Moose Lodge. I like to cook, but I don't like to bake, but this is so easy. I've  gotten rave reviews both times that I made it.

This was a very moist, light cake.  It did not quite have the lemon flavor I was looking for, but it was very easy to make and was well received by the family.   Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Lover this!  Made a few changes not on my own.  Sent my son to the store for  lemon jello and he got pudding instead.  So I went with it.  Lemon cake mix.  Lemon pudding for poke part.  Dream whip and vanilla pudding with lemon juice and zest.  Was fantastic!

I just made this cake for a birthday at my husbands office. It was met with rave reviews from everyone and the piece I just ate as beyond delicious. Light, moist, clean, it's a perfect dessert for lemon lovers! The only suggestion I did follow was to use lemon pudding in place of lemon jello in the frosting. I wasn't super confident the jello would dissolve in the cold milk. I can tell you it's an excellent substitution for a really easy, inexpensive, delicious cake!! Enjoy!!

This is delicious.  I wasn't sure what pudding flavor to get, so I stuck with vanilla.  I'm curious how lemon pudding would add to it though.  I'll try that next time.

I'm not a fan of whipped topping, so I used 1 1/2 cups of whipped heavy cream. The cake was great! Just lightly lemony, and very refreshing.

Great recipe!  Light and creamy, perfect for a summer dessert.  I used sugar free jello and pudding mix, and as others suggested, 1 cup of water.  I used an electric mixer to beat together the milk, jello and pudding mix until it thickened before folding in the Cool Whip, which made the frosting smooth and creamy.  I was never a fan of poke cakes, but this one is a keeper!

Made this for my boyfriend's birthiday a couple of years ago and we loved it! He has requested it again this year so of course I will make it. It smells heavenly in the oven while baking and the whipped cream frosting is divine.

Very good. Moist. Used less water as some suggested and also used lemon pudding instead and some lemon zest in frosting to bring a freshness to it. :)

I've made this cake twice now for different barbecues we've been invited to, and it has been a hit both times.  My family loves the wonderful lemon flavor without being too sweet - I did use sugar free jello, pudding mix and cool whip.

I made this for my mother's birthday, and my family loved it.  I used lemon pudding instead of vanilla to add that extra lemon flavor to the topping.  Also, I used 1/2 cup hot water and 1/2 cup cold water for gelatin mix.  I also made it for my co-workers and they absolutely loved it!!!!!

I make this often. Like just last Sunday for dessert. It is one of my grandaughters favorites. However it is a jello recipe-(you can go to the site to get the original recipe with options)  I use a white cake and use Lemon instant pudding for the topping with the coolwhip. However I used real whip cream last week. It is really good. Its heavy moist and delicious.

The cake itself was good except the frosting  The texture was stiff and hard to work with.  I'm glad I didnt make it for guests, as I would have been embarrased. I would only attempt making this again with a different frosting.

I made this cake exactly according to the recipe listed and everyone in my family (even my husband who doesn't really like lemon) raved about it. I will certainly make this again...especially in the hot summer months. YUM!

Delicious! I use sugar-free and fat-free jello and pudding as well as light Cool Whip to keep the fat and calorie count down. Very yummy and you'll never miss it!

Made this for a co-worker's birthday and there wasn't enough to go around!  If you're pressed for time, make the cake one day ahead of time, refrigerate, then make the frosting the day of serving.

This is a great recipe, very similar to my mother-in-law's recipe for lemon lime sheet cake. The lemon lime version is as follows: 

Used Lime jello instead of lemon to pour over the cake (also use less water: 3/4C hot and 1/2C cold). Make sure jello mix is room temp before pouring over cake. For the topping blend with hand mixer in glass bowl: 

1 1/2 C cold milk 
1 envelope dry whip topping mix (Dream Whip)
1 pkg lemon jello 

Blend 3-8 min until stiff peaks form. Frost cake and refridgerate. TO DIE FOR. My husband requests this cake often. Just make sure your beaters and mixing bowl are cold.

Incredibly moist and delicious cake! Hubby absolutely loved it!

I made the following modifications: used a white cake mix since I couldn't find lemon; sugar-free, fat-free white chocolate pudding mix; sugar-free Cool Whip. I also would prefer to have found sugar-free Lemon jello, but couldn't.

After reading other reviews, I cut the water down to 1-1/2 cups total.

Delicious!

This cake is tasty; it is light and refreshing. However, I can't get over the feeling that it is missing something. The cake itself has great flavor. It is the topping that could use a boost. Maybe next time I will try adding lemon juice.
