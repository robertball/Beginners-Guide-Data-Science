This recipe was a great hit in my family. Everyone including my 14 month old grandson, 7 year old granddaughter loved this dish. I did cook this in the oven in double wrapped foil. Also, I used parchment paper to line the baking tray for easy cleanup. I am glad I did because one of the packets leaked. The chicken was tender and moist.  My family likes extra sauce so we had small bowls of bbq sauce for dipping.  I used cherry tomatoes which did make the sauce watery. I will make this again and will not use the tomatoes. You will have to watch that the chicken doesn't overcook. I checked the chicken with a meat thermometer after twenty minutes and two of the chicken breasts were ready to eat. Also, I wasn't sure how much corn to put in each packet since I had a large bag of corn. I think next time, I will use a cup of corn for each foil packet. Thanks, Angie for sharing your wonderful recipe!

Needed to cook for an hour instead of 30 minutes and added a little extra BBQ sauce. Also used mixed veggies instead of just corn. Other than that, it was great!

Very tasty!  I omitted the corn since we were having corn on the cob with it.  Cooked in 25 minutes and chicken breasts were very juicy.
