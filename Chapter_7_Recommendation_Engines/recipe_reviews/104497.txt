An unusual recipe, but as a reference point, it is unsuitable for Passover as it contains flour and corn (unless you're Sephardi).  Any mixture of grain (specifically the 5 grains barley, rye, wheat, spelt, and oats and also corn, rice and beans if you're Ashkenazi) and liquid is considered "chometz" or leavening for the holiday.  Ironically, Baking powder can be kosher for Passover.

6-21-11 I love you, Amy. You will be missed. You were one of my dearest, oldest friends. You were so sweet and thought of others first and then yourself. Please be at peace.

(((((This is a great cornbread recipe when you find yourself out of baking powder! I have made this several times, and we really like this recipe! Thanks Amy and Katie for posting! ~~~Dana~~~(;))))))

I was a little dubious about trying this recipe and thought the mixture was too runny to work properly...

But after it was cooked, it was PERFECT! This is my new personal cornbread recipe.

Thanks!

My church does not allow baking powder or other leavening agents  during passover so this recipe is great for us! I added a tablespoon of sour cream and a teaspoon of vanilla for extra flavor, and it turned out really delicious and moist. I baked it on a greased loaf pan and cut it into pieces it right after I took it off the oven. It took exactly 20 minutes to bake. I will keep this in my recipe book for years to come! Thank you!

Sweet Amy, you will missed by all.  I'm so glad I had the opportunity to know you on The Quality Cook forum.  This recipe has such a special meaning, not just because it's tasty, but also because it was yours.  Thank you, our friend.

This will be a great addition next year! My church personally does not allow baking powder since it is a leaven and we don't ban mixtures of grains since they are not leavening agents lol.. So this is perfect for me!

I substituted melted butter for the shortening.  They were good but dense and a little dry.  EDIT:  They became hard and even more dry the next day...won't make these again.

It was alright for not being "fluffy" - good for when you don't have alot in the house.  probably btter with a soup that you could dip it in.

Made it at least 10 Times. I leave the sugar out. Sometimes use buttermilk instead. I make corn sticks and this recipe is more than Suitable!

Fabulous! I made full-sized muffins instead, and the recipe made 12. Great flavor and texture.  I will definitely repeat!

It was good for Passover week , but not the same as traditional cornbread . I used margerine , instead of shortning . You could use just corn and no flour , if you are worried about tradition . ( mixed grains ) I personally believe it meets scriptural requirements .

I have been looking for a johnny cake recipe that I used to have, that came out more like cake... I found and prepared this recipe as it seamed to have same amount of ingredients that I used before.  I was very dissapointed...  it came out dense and hard, and I even added a second egg to help fluff it up more.
