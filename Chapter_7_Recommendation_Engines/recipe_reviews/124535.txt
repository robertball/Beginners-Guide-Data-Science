I tried this for the first time and served it to friends for a Christmas brunch. It was a huge hit! I made a few changes -- different cheeses, and a little less than called for; no mushrooms, additional peppers and green onions -- and prepared it the night before so it was ready to bake in the morning. Everyone loved it, and I will definitely try it again. Next time, I'd like to add a layer of spinach. This recipe is super versatile, and lends itself to simple changes to suit personal tastes, or available ingredients.

This recipe was a good one.  I did cut the cheese by two cups (one casserole certainly doesn't need 6 cups and neither do my hips!) and cut the parsley to 1.5 T and it was still plenty.  Very pretty presentation of you cut in rows and then on the diagonal and stack at an ange on the plate.  Thanks for sharing!

I took a chance on making this because it has no reviews yet, and I like to choose my recipes by the ratings sometimes.  It turned out wonderful!  

I always like to stick to the recipe, but I'm not a big fan of ham, so I used linguica, which gave it so much flavor.  It was really excellent!  I did follow the recipe exactly besides the ham, and this was so good!  I had 7 guests over for brunch and they all loved it!! 
Thanks so much for the recipe!  I will make this again for sure!

This past football season, we did a lot of Brunches / Breakfasts, and this was the one item that kept repeating itself.  The best part about this recipe, is it's versatility.  I played with this each time I made it.  Switching up meat, adding this veggie, tossing in that spice.  Then, I started making "Crusts" (so far, the most well received was the bag o' shredded hash browns and butter, baked prior to adding the egg mixture).  Try this one! Run with it. Make it your own!

I've been making this breakfast casserole for years.  It is one of my most requested recipes.   I normally assemble the casserole the night before keeping the egg mixture separate.  In the morning I give the egg mixture a good beating and then pour over casserole before baking.

I made this for a brunch I had the other day and it was tasty.  I dont eat ham so I omitted it and added extra red peppers, which made me a little worried that it would change the consistency, but it didnt.  I would defintely make it again.

It was excellent.  Made for company and my mother told me to "save this one".  So this means excellent in my opinion! Replaced actual onions with onion flakes and used fresh mushrooms instead.  I would used a smaller baking pan rather than the 13" x 9" as it made recipe look flat and not too appealing until you bit into it.  To fatten it up, I'd use the next smallest baking dish.

Awesome! I made minor alterations. Used diced turkey sausage instead of ham. Omitted the mushrooms. Sauteed the onions and peppers with the sausage. Added as second layer over cheese. Added garlic powder to the egg/milk mix. Delicious!

I gotta say that I was pretty impressed. I halved the recipe and wish I wouldn't have! Even my toddler enjoyed it! I omitted the mushrooms, used pepper jack and sharp cheddar cheese and enjoyed this quiche-like dish without the crust!

This was so colorful and is such a great base for an egg bake.  I used a little less cheese, bacon, peppers (green and red), onions (yellow and green), and mushrooms.  It was delicious and gone in seconds. 

When I made it a second time I used chorizo, some jalenpenos, jack cheese, onions, tomatoes, and potatoes with salsa on the side and it made an awesome TexMex egg bake. 

There are so many options!

Great recipe.  It has endless possibilities.  I did increase the eggs to 12 based on other reviews.  I added a cup of crumbled bacon to the ham and used fresh mushrooms.  I used equal amounts of cheddar, pepper jack and swiss cheese to equal the six cups.  I used heavy cream instead of milk. I added 1/4 C of sun dried tomatoes.  It disappeared rapidly from the pan and not everyone got some. My husband said I could make this for breakfast or supper whenever I want.  I can't wait to make it again with other ingredients.

This was very good. I left out the ham because I was bringing this to a large group with dietary restrictions. To compensate, I doubled the mushrooms and added a green pepper. It got rave reviews. I did have to bake this much longer than as directed, but that could have been my fault because I covered the dish during baking. In the future I will try it uncovered and hopefully that will cut back on the cooking time. Thanks!

This was a great recipe to use.  You could do your own variations using your choice of veggies that you like.  I took the advice of previous reviews and reduced the cheeses to 2 cups of each kind.  I made it for easter brunch, and made an extra tray to keep. Sliced it in squares, and we'll be able to throw the squares in the toaster oven for an easy-to-go breakfast for the next couple of days.  Neighbors loved it! I'll definintly use it again and again.

This was one of the rare recipes that I made for me, the veggie-fanatic, as opposed to for my husband, the carnivore, and what was truly incredible was that we BOTH loved it!  My husband actually declared this one of his new favorite rabbit-food recipes, which is saying a lot!  I made a few substitutions to suit dietary needs (hemp milk and almond cheeses in place of cow-dairy, for example), but other than adding a few extra egg whites and cutting the cheese in half (per other reviewers), and adding a tbs. of minced garlic and 1/4 tsp. of dried oregano, I kept the ingredients and proportions the same as those in the recipe.  Truly, this was a wonderful surprise and will have a permanent spot on our weekly breakfast rotation!

I made this for Christmas day and again for Mother's Day...  It turned out great both times!  I used bacon instead of ham and added potatoes to the bottom.  I didn't want to use quite so much cheese so I used about half.  It froze and reheated really well too!

Incredibly yummy!  I added sausage slices and used cream instead of milk and fresh basil and parsley and it was amazingly delicious.

Simple and turned out exactly as expected.  I left out the canned mushrooms and added about 1/2 c. fresh small sliced mushrooms because everything else is fresh...why give it a canned flavor?

Delicious! I made it the night before. I put a mixture of cheddar/mozarella  and some swiss cheese. I used a combination of fresh and dried (reconstituted) mushrooms, sauteed with the onions, garlic, red pepper. I topped it with diced green onions and chopped fresh parsley before placing in the oven. It was still a bit moist in the middle at 40 min, so left it in for approx 5 more min. DELICIOUS! You could definitely add some heat (chopped jalapeno) if you like. Definitely will make for large gatherings.

This is supreme- even reheated two days later :) This is like a light and fluffy crustless quiche.  I halved the recipe for me and my man, and made the following changes though this recipes would be great as written for sure:  Greased an 8x8 casserole dish with butter.  I used a combination of feta, italian, and cheddar cheese- wow!  I nixed the mushrooms bc I think they are nasty, and upped the peppers, of which I used a a tric-color variety.  I added three minced cloves of garlic and used yellow onion in the sautedd veggies.  Used 5 eggs (remember I haved the recipe though) and dried parsley.  I thought this would be bland, but it was great.  I really think sauteeing the veggies brings the great flavor to the dish and the inclusion of feta upped the ante.  It took about 40 min to cook and was perfectly browned.  I would definitely use this dish for company.  Yum.

Made just as written and was great Christmas morning!  No fuss was baking while presents were opening and something nice and hot to eat after! My husbands suggestion is to put some chunky salsa on top for some extra zing!  Thanks for posting Gloria, a new holiday staple for us now.

I made this last night for supper.  Yum-Yum both my husband and I LOVED it.  I only made a few changes.  I used 2 cups of both the cheddar and mozzerella and then 2 cups of colby/monteray jack.  I omitted the red pepper (didn't have any) and parsley.  I added Mrs Dash Garlic and Herb also.  Can't wait to make this again!

Really good dish, I've made it a few times already.  I only used 3 cups cheese total and substituted turkey ham to lighten it up.

I've made this three times now and every time it turns out great.  I use 1/2 the amount of cheese.  It is a perfect breakfast to make ahead and have on hand for the kids to have a quick, filling meal before they head off to school.  It even makes a great breakfast burrito with no more cheese added.

Very good recipe!  I would definitely substitute the ham with sausage next time though!  I actually made the entire dish and put it in the frig overnight!  It baked up great!

Thanks to all the reviews I read before I made this , I was able to make some changes to this recipe and it was the best egg bake I have ever made!  If you like a thicker, fluffier egg bake, instead of a denser one, try this!  The trick is to double the eggs!  I used 16 eggs instead of 8, 2 cups of milk, omitted the flour to make it gluten free, (didn't have parsley on hand but did include the dried basil which added a nice taste) I used less cheese on the bottom and sprinkled some cheddar/mozzarella/and feta cheese to the top of the egg bake the last 10 minutes of baking.  Wow, the feta added a great flavor! I also sauteed green pepper along with the red (for a Christmas look) and used more white onions along with some green onions to equal a little more than 1/3 cup.  Baked at 350 for 45 minutes or so, (check to not overbake as all ovens vary) and let it cool slightly and then it was enjoyed by all!

I made this morning for a church function and everyone who ate it asked me for the recipe. It was very easy to follow and I made as is minus the ham.

I wasn't sure about this because it seemed too simple, but it got great reviews so I made it for a Fathers' Day brunch. Wow. Everyone (even my very picky mother) loved it and asked for the recipe. Good job!

Very easy to make, tasty and versatile.  Made for brunch and had plenty left-over for breakfast the next day.  Great way to make use of random refrigerator ingredients (ie, sausage, bacon, ham, onions, etc.).

I made this for a women's group-MOPS, and it was a hit. I had others ask for the recipe. Lots of flavor w/ the veggies and herbs. I will definately make this for any other Brunch/Breakfast I have to entertain for.

Delicious....I substituted gluten free flour due to Celiac's in our family, and it was still delicious!  My gluten eating-friends couldn't tell the difference and it turned out exactly like the recipe! Made it a second time two weeks later...still loved it!

I doubled the recipe but omitted the flour. I'm not really sure why you need it but it came out beautifully. Used frozen bell pper/onion mix and added frozen spinach until cooked and cooled. Just mixed it with eggs and milk and cheese and it was fabulous!!

This was really a great recipes. It turned out great despite the fact that I made it a day and a half ahead and just kept it in the fridge until cooking it for Christmas Brunch. The only real variation I made was that I used almond milk; and I cooked a small portion separately without cheese for a family member that cannot have milk. It did take longer to cook, probably 50 minutes
I will definitely use it again!

I needed a last minute recipe for a last minute Christmas Eve Brunch and this worked great. I used what I had on hand. canned mushrooms, roasted red peppers in bottle, spinach, scalllions, onions, and pepperonni bits. I used 6 eggs and 1/2 the cheese. I needed to bake it for around 10-15 minutes longer than suggested. It turned out great, my guests loved it and I loved how easy and versatile it was. I will definitely use this recipe again!

Excellent dish.  8 serving variations: Layer1 - 5 oz sliced sauteed mushrooms, onions, ground hot sausage; Layer2 - green onions & parsley & cheese.  Slowly poured in 1/3-1/2 of batter. Layer 3: cubed sandwich ham and fresh blanched spinach (water squeezed out) and more green onions and cover with cheese. Slowly poured in rest of batter.  (Exposed green onions may brown a little.) Baked for 50-55 minutes (35 was still too liquidy) and used a 10.5"x7.5"x2.75" pan for 8 servings.  Nicely browned top.  Delcious and will definitely make again. Thanks, Gloria.

I made this for a brunch party last weekend and it was a huge hit - every last bit was eaten.  Very easy!  I reduced the amount of cheese to a little less than 2 cups of each kind, used Morningstar Farms veggie sausage instead of the ham (cooked it in the microwave before adding it to the dish to bake), and added some orange pepper in addition to the red.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

This is an excellent recipe. I have been preparing it for Christmas morning for several years. My family looks forward to it every year. No greasy sausage or bacon just lean ham. Try it you will love it. I omit the mushrooms and spices and increase the eggs to 12.

Love this recipe.  It is easy and very tasty.  I have used both ham and sausage separately and could easily use both together.  The multiple cheeses and spices set this one apart from the other cookie cutter recipes.

Guests raved about this dish!  It was really good.  Easy to throw together and heats up well later if you end up having any leftovers.  Can change up the ham for bacon or sausage, the flavors meld well together.  Nice recipe, many asked for it.  Thanks!

I changed a few things based on preference - used chopped turkey sausage instead of ham, fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and spinach instead of green onions. Made this for Sunday brunch and it was a hit! Plus, it is so incredibly easy. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for fun this morning. I substituted the ham for sausage and made half of what the recipe called for. Such an easy recipe which was great because I'm still learning how to cool lol. Very yummy... will make again for my family.

I modified this so much, it almost became it's own recipe.  However, since this was the original inspiration, I will attach the comments here:

I am a cook of convenience, meaning I rarely plan ahead.  I use whatever I have on hand, and I live on a small island, so often run out of fresh items.  I wanted a quick recipe for a lazy Sunday brunch at home, and was out of fresh milk and veggies.

I used a block of cheddar cheese (approx 1 lb) and a large can of diced chilis (7oz) and about a cup of real bacon crumbles.  For the egg mixture, I used 10 eggs and 1 can (12 oz) of evaporated milk with the 1/2 c flour.  I basically just seasoned with salt and pepper.

It came out amazing with a chilli relleno flair.  I garnished with salsa and sour cream, and my teens are still raving. :)

I made this for Mother's Day brunch for 16 people. I subsituted liquid egg whites for the eggs, but kept everything else the same. It was A-MAZING. Everyone came for seconds AND my mother asked ME for the recipe. Enough said :)

Excellent!  I didn't have sweet red pepper, or green onions, so I used a few sprinkles of crushed red pepper flakes, and minced dried onion and it was fabulous!! I've been allergic to eggs all of my life, and have finally overcome that allergy.  So, learning how to cook eggs has been a little challanging.  Finding this recipe to bake them has made me look like a pro!!

Fantastic recipe.  I made a couple of changes  - used half the cheese, and placed one cheese layer on the bottom, and one on the very top.  I left out the mushrooms and instead of ham, used spicy veg chorizo, which crumbled like gound turkey. Oh, and left out the basil and parsley and instead used only oregano.   Received rave reviews!

Very good!  I used a large can of straw mushrooms and 16 oz. ground turkey breakfast sausage.  This was a hit for our brunch with friends.

Like some other reviewers, I also cut the amount of cheese in half. I omitted onions and ham because I wanted something basic for Easter brunch since I was cooking a ham on its own. I placed the casserole in an egg shape dish and it was just wonderfull different and wonderfully tasty! Thanks so much! This bake is soooo fast and convenient.

This will be our new family tradition! Egg Bake for Christmas Eve when we get home from mass and open presents.  Served with fresh pineapple and a warm whole wheat roll.  We added mild cooked sausage instead of ham. Yum. It also tastes great warmed up.     So many of our friends are serving this for brunch get-togethers in the coming days.  Thank you!

I made this for Christmas morning and once since (breakfast for supper!).  It was very pretty - red and green.  My daughter doesn't care for peppers, so the second time I made it I used chopped leek inplace of the onions and peppers.  I also reduced the cheese to 4 cups.  Very Yummy!!!

I've made this many times and it's always a huge hit. I leave out the ham and peppers (personal preference) and use 4 cups of cheese instead of 6. But the most important change I made is using fresh mushrooms. Makes a huge difference in my opinion. Awesome recipe, perfect for brunch.

This was a leap of faith for me, as I made it for the first time for company, though it was quite delicious! Contrary to the directions (which I overlooked)I ended up greasing my baking dish and I'm not sure it was a bad thing. I also didn't have milk so ended up using reconstituted powdered milk. I had a 1/2 lb. of sliced mushrooms that needed to be used so I sautéed and added them, as well. Except for the egg mixture,I added all ingredients to the dish the night before. I mixed up the egg mixture and put in a quart-sized mason jar. In the morning I just preheated the oven, shook up the eggs until I could see the flour was not settled to the bottom any longer, and poured them over the ingredients in the pan. Baked as directed. Simply delicious and my overnight guests loved it!

I felt this dish lacked flavor overall.  I made it exactly as directed without altering anything except the flour.  I had to use gluten free flour instead.  Will definitely kick up the flavor next time.

This is a great recipe.  I made a few changes the third time I used it.  I used less cheese- about half the recommended amount.  I also added two more eggs and a little extra milk.  I also skipped the flour and found the eggs to be flavorful and not dry.

Didn't stay together too well, the cheese on the bottom of the dish wasn't sturdy enough or something.  Tasted good, but didn't look that good since it fell apart.
