I used a homemade no-sugar granola in this recipe. Absolutely delicious. One of the best smoothies I have had in a LONG time.

Wow, what a filling smoothie this is!  I made the full recipe and it made 2 nice size glasses for our breakfast.  I liked the nutty taste in this from the almonds and the granola.  I used vanilla Greek yogurt as that is what was on hand.  Because the Greek yogurt is a little thicker, I added one more ounce of orange juice.

Instead of buying flavoured, sweetened vanilla yogurt, I made this with plain yogurt and added some ground vanilla and a touch of honey.  I omitted the granola and I added a dash of cayenne pepper to give it a kick.  It was DELICIOUS.  Honestly, it tasted like I was drinking a creamsicle popsicle.   I can't wait to make this recipe again!

Wow, this is a filling smoothie between all of the almonds, granola, and yogurt. I made a few changes based on what I had in the house and to make the smoothie more cold. I made 1/2 recipe. I found that 1 orange had 2 oz, of juice, so I just added 3/4 of a peeled orange. My blender can liquify the fiber. I had no orange juice. I had non-fat greek yogurt, so to make it more vanilla I added a splash of vanilla extract and agave syrup. I think, the sweeter Yoplait would have been a better choice though. I thought, it tasted too room temperature so I added 4 ice cubes which helped some. I thought this tasted kind of like a smoothie version of peaches and cream oatmeal. I felt like it needed something else, but I wasn't sure, maybe cinnamon? I am glad it was more like a meal smoothie, though, because 1/2 the recipe came out to be 325 calories when I calculated it. Not a repeat smoothie, but worked fine this morning.
