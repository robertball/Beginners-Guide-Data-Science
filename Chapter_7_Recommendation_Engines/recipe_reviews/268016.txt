These are delicious. I used homemade Chicken Sriracha meatballs that I froze the night before. I also used homemade bbq sauce. The method worked perfectly. These went beautifully with steamed rice.

These were really good, easy to make, and went over well.  I have made them twice.   The only variation in recipe I made was not to use the pepper flakes.  I felt my sauce was spicy enough. 

The first time I made these, I otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I found there was a little too much sauce for 24 oz. of meatballs, so I upped it to a 32-oz. package and that seemed just right.  Also, the first time I made them, some of the balls got burned on the bottom, so the second time I didn't use the saute step. I just mixed up the sauce ingredients, tossed in the meatballs, and set the pot on high pressure for 5 minutes as called for.  A couple of the meatballs still were a bit browned on the bottom, but not nearly as badly, and my pot didn't give me a "burn" warning.

I saw that someone tried using orange marmalade, and that sounds good, so  I might try that next time.
