Oooh.  This was fantastic.  It's great to have for breakfast with coffee or tea and is quite filling. Doesn't need frosting or anything of the sort but this isn't a sweet birthday cake! 
I was a bit nervous that it'd be too sweet when I measured out the sugar but once the batter was ready and it already smelled heavenly I knew this would be good.  I used Ghirardelli's cocoa powder and plain old black tea.  Didn't have that much hazelnuts at home so I used half walnuts half hazelnuts.  The results were a delicious and moist coffee cake. I'll have to learn this recipe by heart.

I'm not an experienced baker, but this cake was fairly easy and fast to make. I baked it for an aunt's birthday and she isn't a big fan of dense cakes but I loved its rich chocolate flavor. I'll be skipping the nuts next time though. For the icing, I used plain and simple chocolate glaze and it tasted fab!

This cake was fantastic!!! I used a black chai tea to enhance the flavors & put some mixed fruit on top. Made it for an award ceremony; It was gone in the blink of an eye!!!! Everybody loved it & i thought it was very easy to make. My friends even asked me to make some more for them! Definitely doing it again :D

I CANNOT bake at all but I've just successfully made this cake. I'm so proud of myself. I tried using Earl Grey Tea like one reviewer suggested and it gave the cake such a lovely, subtle taste. 5 stars for how easy it is to make and 5 stars for taste *edit* This cake still tastes great ad doesn't dry out even after 4 days!

Only one word I can say "Fabulous". This recipe was very easy to make for inexperienced cook like me. But the taste was just perfect. I did several changes due to what I had in my kitchen such as self-rising flour, sweetened cocoa powder, and my favorite strong tea. I skipped the hazelnuts and put a bit less sugar. Also, I sprigkeled it with cocoa powder instead of confectioner's sugar cause I didn't have it -__-. Many thanks for the real good and simple cake recipe. I'll make it again and again.

This was great. I didn't have hazelnuts, or I think it would have been even better. I used a 10cup williams-sonoma sunflower bundt pan and it almost overflowed. I think a 9 cup pan (as the recipe calls for) would not be enough.   First time I baked with tea, got rave reviews from the neighbors.

a wonderful chocolate cake, not too dence. I used "eral gray" brand tea which added special aroma. A heavy frosting will spoil the delicate flavor of the cake.

A way to cut back on oil or butter could be to add applesauce to the mix. I've done that a lot with boxed cake mixes...you could probably even cut back on the sugar if you use the applesauce, but that doesn't seem to be much of an issue per the other reviews. (Applesauce will also help keep this cake nice an moist.)  I think any nuts would work with this recipe, be they almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, etc. (Love, love, love chocolate + nuts!!)

Not the best and would not make again. It was very dry, and as I read before, tasted a lot like flour. I think if I made it again I could make it taste better but it would need too many modifications - I would probably sub the tea for the same amount of buttermilk which would give it a nice flavor and much needed moisture, for a better chocolate flavor I would add melted chocolate or as someone else did, chocolate chips. It didn't need near the amount of baking time it called for. I baked it for 50min and it could have even gone less. So in the long run with the amount of changes it would be an entirely different recipe.

I am a pretty good baker, was intrigued by this recipe and the good reviews.  And-----there is always the possibility that I messed up--!!  I was careful to take it out on time, mine was not dry, just dull.  It was fun, though, making something unusual always is.

Sounds delicious but very high in fat. So I'll rate this 3 stars.
I try to use healthy substitutions for butter and eggs, but not always successfully. I wish this website would do this for us (who wants to waste all these good ingredients on a failure?). But I can't understand why a cake that has a full cup of butter would be dry. Would using oil for some of the butter help?
I'm reluctant to try it. Any advice or suggestions?

A "must-have" for every chocolate fan out there. This is a great cake. I really liked that it wasn't that sweet at all. It's not like a brownie that contains tons of sugar. This cake is just right!!!!

Would not add any frosting. This cake is perfect the way it is. I love it because it is dense and moist inside and it is not too sweet.

This cake was okay.  Came out a bit dry.  I followed the directions exactly and my oven does have a 360 degree setting.  Didn't know whether to frost it or not.  Definitely needs icing.  I rate on whether there are any leftovers -- I still have half a cake left and I served it yesterday.

A little dry, but the flavor was so perfect for when you want something sweet, but not too sweet (like at tea or breakfast). So delicious, and I will certainly make it again.

Sorry, I didn't like this cake at all.  I baked it at 360 for 55 minutes, and it was dry, dry.  Hazelnuts aren't cheap either.  :(

This cake was quite good.  I dusted the top with powdered sugar and that seemed to be all the topping it needed.  I don't know about letting it sit for a day--it was wonderfully moist the day I made it, but by the next day it had dried out and was much less appealing.  It looks very dark and rich---decadent.

This cake was good... although it came out a little dry.  My children did not like the nuts, either.  It was a bit like a brownie cake.  I will make again, without nuts and with frosting.
