I added fresh thyme and substituted cilantro instead of parsley. It was absolutely delightful and is now one of my favorite dishes.

Excellent recipe and easy to prepare.  I used sea salt, Cajun spice, and black pepper to season the meat for a bit of spice.  Also added two tsps garlic and bell pepper to vegetables and extra chopped tomatoes to rotel.  Delicious!
