This was very easy, fast and delicious!  I sauted some garlic and olive oil and added some salsa to the sauce for more flavor.  My family loved it!

I really wish I'd read the reviews (all of them) before I made these. It seems that a lot of people who rated this a four or five altered the recipe and added flavor. I found that this lacked flavor. I followed the recipe exactly as far as ingredients were concerned. I did use some of the cheese and chilies in the filling, but still found that these were incredibly bland and somewhat dry. The toppings are what made them taste good. I topped mine with sour cream and guacamole and added more of each as I ate my serving. My husband, on the other hand, doesn't care for guacamole and passed on the sour cream. He didn't finish his portion. It does make a beautiful presentation, but I probably won't make this one again.

WOW! This was delicious! I made it exactly as stated only I used reduced fat sour cream and 2% monterey jack cheese to cut calories a little.  My daughter who is super picky about her food raved about it!  I made the whole tray and there was none left! Awesome!

This was a lot better than I expected!  I used up the last of our thanksgiving turkey on it and added a little chili powder and cumin to it to wake it up a bit.  I didn't have the chili peppers so I used sauteed green peppers instead and used flour tortillas since that's what I had on hand.  Definately fry the tortillas in the oil like the recipe states, I was a little hesitant about that -calorically speaking- but I think that was a HUGE part in getting the correct flavor/texture.  A great and easy way to use up my leftovers!  Thank you!

Wow... this is great!  My family loved this.  I definitely added more seasoning to the chicken-sour cream mixture.  I diced one small onion and two small Roma tomatoes and mixed it into the chicken mixture. Also, I added about 1/2 teaspoon more of salt, and I added about 1/2 teaspoon of Badia complete seasoning.  Yummy....

Good stuff! I recommend using 3/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 - 1/2 cup salsa.

I am disappointed this wasn't better (sorry). It's very dry & I added extra sour cream & chilies. Needs more liquid - perhaps salsa or a cream-based soup. If you like spice you will need to add more spices than listed.

The recipe itself is obviously BLAND, but thankfully I read other reviews and knew enough about seasoning to modify for more flavor.  I added the following the filling; chopped tomatoes for color and liquid, half an onion, 1 clove of chopped garlic, 1/2 of the can of diced green chilies, 1/2 cup cheese, more salt, cumin, paprika.  On top I added salsa, the other 1/2 can of green chilies and the cheese.  It was delicious!!   I think you need the tomatoes for the filling and the salsa on top or it would have been dry.

I thought these were pretty good!  They're not going to be creamy, "saturated" enchiladas (like my husband likes, so he wasn't a huge fan), but I thought it had a good taste to it.  If you want to add some sauce to it, you can add cream of chicken soup or even half and half and let it bake in that.  But they're good the way they are.

This was easy to make, but lacked in flavor. Great base recipe that needs spiced up for me. Next time I will add cumin to the sour cream.

This recipe is great.Added a 10 oz can of rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles (1/2 in chicken mix and 1/2 on top)and part of a store bought roasted chicken.I have no left overs ;)
Made these again today. I didn't have left over rotisserie chicken so I roasted skinless, boneless thighs, seasoned with paprika, garlic and cumin powders and salt.

This came out great.  I did make minor edits.  Added a little taco seasoning, and 2tbsps green chili enchilada sauce to the chicken, and reduced the sour cream to 3/4 cup.  I used flour tortillas and used a drizzle of green chili enchilada sauce on the tortillas before the cheese.  I broiled them for a couple minutes at the end of baking time to brown it a bit more.

If you want to spice it up a little bit, add about 1 tbsp hot sauce to the sour cream mixture, and some red pepper powder to taste (I used a good 2 tsp).

great base recipe.  I used half a can of Rotel (for the diced green chilis.)  Next time, I would definitely add the whole can.  Overall, super yummy and very easy to do!

i was skeptical, but this actually was really good.  i left the chilies off of a few for the kids, and it actually changed the taste quite a bit, so the chilies are a must.  soo easy i couldn't believe it was good too.

Great basic recipe, but I added the green peppers to the filling instead of on top and I also added taco seasoning to the mix.  It was wonderful!

Very good but a bit time consuming if you need to saute the chicken for this recipe.  Definitly quicker if you have leftover or a store baked rotissiere on hand.  I opted to add 1/2 cup of salsa to the chicken and sour cream mix to moisten per others suggestions.  This recipe is not overly wet, but could be remedied with enchilada sauce on top if you prefer a 'wetter' enchilada.

I really wanted this to be as good as everyone rated it, but it was not. The enchiladas were very dry. It definitely needed more cream, maybe cream of chicken soup with cream cheese and salsa. I will definitely tweak the recipe and try again! Sorry Kate!

This was so easy and so yummy! I do wish there was another way to do the corn tortillas without dipping in oil but it was great anyways. Next time I will add another can of the chilies (mild) because those really added to the flavor.

It's is a good meal, perhaps served with rice and beans. I mix half the green chilies in with the sour cream mix, sprinkle the rest on top of the cheese. 

Freshly ground black pepper on top before baking, definitely.

Sauteed onions, and a dash of cumin would really give this a kick. 

Rotisserie chicken makes life easier, and adds additional flavor. 

Use the entire 10 ounce can of sauce, which will allow for extra sauce in the casserole dish to add to the top of the individual servings. 

Oh, forgot to mention, have plenty of paper towels on hand for dabbing the tortillas. 

Will make again, with suggested changes.

Great recipe! I added some spices (cumin, garlic, onion, cayenne pepper) to it and substituted green chili sauce for the actual chopped chilis. Turned out great. My three year old wanted seconds and my five year old (who doesn't like anything) said he loved it! :)

So when i read this recpie i thought it sounded good but that it might be a little bland. I read reviews, and it seems that others agreed that it was a little bland and tasteless. So i fallowed the reviews of others and added garlic and onion powder, I also added a small can of olives. yet it was still tasteless and bland. The only thing that saved this meal was that we were having a salad with litehouse blue cheese dressing, my husband and i smothered the enchalada in the blue cheese dressing. If i make these again i may just put some dressing in the sour cream mixture. 
My hubbie and i did agree that the corn tortillas were supper yummie cooked in the oven with out the enchalada sauce to drown it. I will deffinatly use this mothod of cooking, however i will fill it with something with a little more flavor.

It was pretty good but it had it's blah moments. I think more salt and garlic would have really helped this dish.

Absolutely loved it! I make a couple of tweeks:  pan-fried some chicken with garlic, then added mushrooms and onions when almost done - enough to soften up.  And I substituted green chilis with a can of tomatoes with chilis in it.  Extra flavors!  Just two of us ate half the 13x9 dish! And this is very simple to do!

Excellent, quick, easy and very tasty. Followed the recipe, but used shredded left-over rotisserie chicken. Next time my wife wants me to add a little hot spice in it. Some folks may want to add the hot stuff at their plate to suit.  To sum it up, just plain yummie especially with the salted chips I made with some extra tortillas. Thanks, Tomnan in Phoenix.

oh guys, so good!!! I made the recipe exactly as said but added chopped tomatoes and onions to the sour cream mix. THEN, I added cream of chicken and cream of onion on the bottom of the sprayed pan. Extra creaminess never hurt no one! ;) So delish!

Followed directions, added mushrooms and used a Pueblo green chile on top for some spice. So good that the wife took left overs to lunch that night and she hates leftovers, homerun.

I read reviews prior to making this, so I knew that I wanted to season the chicken mixture.  I added cumin, onion powder, chipotle powder, and garlic powder.  I didn't have chilies so I chopped up some jalapeno pepper slices.  This turned out beautifully, and tasted delicious.  Very easy to make and I will definitely make it again.  I didn't give it five stars because I did alter the recipe to give it more flavor.

Tasty, but I added green onions and a small can of diced tomatoes with green chilies.  I found I needed to shred the chicken into smaller pieces too.  It was a little dry.

Turned out beautiful. Baked chicken with 4 tbs of taco seasoning rubbed in. Shredded chicken with kitchen aid, added sour cream and more tacos seasoning to taste. Added green onions for garnish.

Was worried original recipe might be a little bland, added sautéed onions, bell peppers, garlic, 3/4 cup Monterey Jacky, & Cajun Seasoning to the chicken mixture. Also pan seared the chicken & seasoned it with salt/pepper, Cajun seasoning, and 1tbs lemon juice. I doubled the amount put green chilled

This was fast and easy with just a couple of modifications. I shredded a store bought rotisserie chicken to save me some cooking time and then mixed in a package of taco seasoning and topped it off with a can of green enchilada sauce! DELICIOUS!

I read all the reviews and added half a can Rotel, a tablespoon of taco seasoning,a tablespoon of cayenne pepper and one can of cream of chicken soup.  It was yummy !  I did use the rotisserie chicken.  The recipe was easy and my family really enjoyed it.  Adding the additional ingredient did add about four more shells.  Enough for easily six people.  Will make this again.

I loved this recipe but I added cream of chicken to the green chilies and cheese.  It was DELICIOUS!  Frying the corn tortillas gave it a nice texture.  I used avocado oil instead of vegetable oil to fry it.  Definitely adding to my recipe box.

We really liked these and they were very simple to prepare.  I did add a few more chilies but other than that followed the recipe as posted.  I served with the Avocado Salad on this site.  Outstanding combo.

They were good.  I split the can of green chilis, half in sour cream mix and half as directed.  Added a handful of jack cheese to sour cream along with some finely chopped onion, chili powder and cumin.  Served with rice and black beans.  In the past I have microwaved corn tortillas to soften.  Will try that next time with this recipe to see if there is a significant difference.

I put the green chilies  inside the mix. Used a can of enchilada sauce spooning a couple tablespoons of sauce on a plate, lay (warmed in microwave) flour tortilla on the plate. spoon chicken mix on tortilla roll up and place seam side down. repeat. any leftover sauce  I spoon over top. I also add green onion and black olives sometimes. I think spinach would be a great addition too.

It's a great starter recipe, but I think there needs to be more in it to make it taste delicious. Maybe next time I will add refried beans spread on the bottom of the pan, and maybe adobo and chili powder to the chicken mixture.

I buy the Enchilada sauce and mix it with seedless roasted green chili,  salt to taste add garlicc. Then I warm it up in a skillet and put the corn tortillas, one at a time.. to loosen them up. But I layer it like a casserole. chicken Onion mix  then cheese, then sauce, next layer.

There is nothing enchanted about this recipe.  Boring & lack flavor as written.  I add cheese, chilis & salsa verde into the chicken mixture.  I also top with more salsa verde & cheese after enchiladas are rolled & placed in dish.  Then bake.  Gives it a lot more flavor.

I added onions and olives. Also, added the sour cream to green enchilada sauce instead of chicken mixture.

If you make this by the recipe it would be the most bland dish on earth... that being said if you cook the chicken grilled or on a flat-top with ample seasonings it'll turn out great but if you're going by the actual recipe plan on a very disappointing experience.

I would say this recipe is a good starting point. Even with things I added Original Rotel, garlic and some taco seasoning to the filling. I feel like I should have added more flavor.  I will probably make this again in the future.

We found them to be tasteless. We are not spice lovers. In fact salt is all we use. Well salt did not help this dish.

Meh.  This recipe was quick and easy but lacked the flavor that I look for in Mexican-inspired dishes.  Maybe will h some modifications - adding spices - it would fit the bill.

Normally I don't try and tweak a recipe on the first try, but I added some Salsa to the top as well (from the International aisle, not the chip Aisle) and used a Mexican blend cheese instead of straight monterey.  
I over cooked some (I'm new to convection ovens) and cubed the chicken a lil too big.  Lessons learned.  next time I'll have more sour cream so that I can make enough to fill the pan.

It needs a sauce. The chicken is bland, the tortillas are bland, the sour cream has little in the way of flavor. Need to add some flavor  somewhere.

I gave this recipe a five because I use it as a foundation with many different additions, many different times.  It has never failed for a fast, economical and sure to please dinner.   Add to it  a salad of greens, or an easy tomato, radish, cucumber, green onion chopped salad with a splash of vinegar & oil.

It was a smash!  However, I did modify it.  For filling, I used 2- 
 1/2 lbs chopped cooked chicken thighs, sour cream,  one can green chilies,  one chopped yellow onion, and 2/3 can red enchilada sauce.   Then, before putting in oven, I pour  remaining enchilada sauce, plus, partial 2nd can of enchilada sauce;  another can of green chilies,  and extra shredded cheese.   Get creative!

I’ve made my chicken enchiladas like this for years with the exception of, after I filled, rolled and placed enchiladas in casserole dish, I poured enchilada sauce over them and top with shredded cheese then baked. My family’s and friends all time favorite!

We loved this! I like things easy. I cut up the 12 corn tortillas in small pieces, used green salsa instead of chilies and mixed all the ingredients together, topped with the cheese and baked as directed.  It was delicious! Will make again.

It was very fast to make. Now take note it’s very bland if you don’t add a few things of your own. I cooked the chicken in taco seasoning, I also added green onion and cilantro for taste. Add a bit more salt then the recipe calls for. Instead of cooking the corn tortillas in regular oil cook it in olive oil.

Fantastic! I did make some changes, but this is a great starter recipe! I added one can cream of chicken soup, one packet of taco seasoning, 2 chopped fresh jalapeños (cooked with chicken), and salsa verde over all before topping with mozzarella cheese. Cooked til hot and bubbly! Super flavorful! Hubby and I loved it this way!

I thought these were so simple and delishous! I love spicy, husband prefers bland. I put the green chilies over half and just a few on the other half. Satisfied us both.  Locally they only sell corn tortillas in 100 packs, so I used taco shell flats by Ortega instead. Worked great and plenty left over for an easy lunch. Reheated beautifuly in the microwave. Forgot to take a picture. Next time, there will be a next time!

I boiled the chicken with taco seasoning and salt/pepper to give it an added boost, as my family does not care for the breast meat.  Thinking of using dark meat next time.

I put taco seasoning in the chicken mix with the salt and pepper and then drizzled taco sauce on top of the wraps before layering with cheese. These are amazing served alongside guacamole and refried beans!  ?? Would have put the beans inside, but my husband won’t eat them.

I have made this a few times, and it is my husband’s favorite. I make him corn tortilla enchiladas and a separate batch using flour tortillas. I prefer the softer texture. I also add enchilada seasoning to the chicken after it is cooked through. That adds so much more flavor.

I will be making this dish again as it was very simple. Although, I did make some a little adjustments. I added onions, salsa, and cilantro to the chicken. Very delicious!

I read several reviews prior to making this dish, and used several of the suggestions.  1. I added Mexican spices, sauteed green onions and garlic to the filling for extra flavor. 
2. I mixed 1/2 can of cream chicken soup with 1/2cup sour cream and more spices to line the bottom of the baking dish.  
3. at the end of the baking time I broiled it for 5 minutes to get crispy edges.  
4. my husband and I really liked it.  it had good flavor.  We served it with chopped bell peppers, salsa and guacamole.  With the soup/sour cream mixture at the bottom of the pan, the enchiladas did have the saucy feel to them. Next I will try them with out it.

I would try adding half  of the green Chiles and cheese to sour cream mixture and put inside tortillas. I also like my chicken shredded vs cubed inside enchiladas. You could use hot green Chiles instead of mild if you wanted a spicy version too. Mine turned out more dry and bland than I expected.

A bit on the bland side.  Perked it up with some salsa.  Next time I'll add some red pepper or other spices while cooking the chicken.

We had this for dinner tonight, my husband loved it!  I read reviews before I made it and decided to add taco seasoning, diced green chillies, tomatos, sauteed onions and cheese to the chicken/sour cream.  I also added diced tomato on top.  It was amazing!  it went great with my mother-in-law's Mexican cornbread.

This is pretty darn good if you're like me and all you have in your kitchen are the ingredients to this recipe!  I didn't have any chillies, which made me afraid it would be too bland, so I cooked the chicken with some diced onion and it came out pretty well. If you're looking for something really flavorful, this isn't for you, but it's nice if you just want to whip something up.

This lost my vote with the Monterrey Jack cheese.  I made this recipe, used it, and it was awful. Not inedible which earned it 2 points but not good either. My family took a few bites and left the rest. I made them again last night but used the proper cheese, queso fresco, added to the inside of the enchilada plus to the top. I also sauteed my (fresh hatch but you can use canned) green chilies with a can of tomatillos, onion, garlic, a little cumin at the end, oregano, white pepper, salt to make a fast easy enchilada sauce which I added to the chicken and poured over the enchiladas. A little sour cream was added to each enchilada before rolling up. Just a little! Then more added in dollops when serving.

I knew this recipe was going to be a little bland, but I also knew it would make a good base for all kinds of toppings...diced avocado, diced tomato, salsa, pickled hot peppers, diced onions, etc.  
To my filling I added some Mexican oregano, garlic powder, and onion powder.  To the topping I added some sliced black olives and I made a mix of cheeses (habanero jack, shredded Mexican blend, and a little crumbled queso fresco).
I'm thinking if I want extra zip next time I'll probably either use Mrs. Dash Extra Spicy or chipotle powder in the filling.  Plus, to make them saucier, I might spread some sour cream on top of the tortillas before I add the veggies and cheese.
Really, the possibilities are endless with this good basic recipe!

My husband and I like these, but I used flour tortillas and did not fry them to save on fat and calories.  I prefer to use fixed tomatoes with green chilis instead (Rotel), both mixed in the studying and in the sauce.  Could use some spices to add more flavor, but otherwise tasty.

Too much sour cream and I only used 3/4 of a cup. I love sour cream. I added salsa to mix which helped. I only had gluten free tortillas, not a good option to soft and gooey. Otherwise, very good.

Love chicken enchiladas and love this recipe! I followed recipe exactly and added the Roma tomatoes and onion, as suggested. The enchiladas were not bland or dry. Easy to make, they turned out very good and delicious. I will do this again.

I made this with a few changes, used flour tortillas instead, added salsa the the filling, cooked chicken with chicken taco seasoning. It was ok, but I was somewhat disappointed. May try this again and follow recipe exactly.

Very good base recipe.  I did add taco seasoning to the chicken, along with onion and half of the green chilies. I didn't dip the corn tortillas in oil before stuffing them to save on calories.  Family enjoyed it and will make it again with the tweaks.

These are the best!  I used flour tortillas instead of corn.  I added 2 oz of diced green chiles to the chicken and sour cream and skipped the jalapenos and cilantro and topped them with 8 oz  of salsa verde and Monterey Jack cheese.  Will definitely make this again!

I made this today just as written.  As I am not an experienced cook of Mexican food I was puzzled about the instruction to dip the tortillas in the hot oil.  I did as instructed and thought they were too oily.  I then read many of the previous reviews and liked "Kitchen Queen's" idea of dipping the tortillas in a sauce.  Next time I will add some of the green chiles to the  chicken mixture. I do not like my food too spicy so this was a good experience for me.  I would make this again.  Maybe with some "tweeks".  Thanks Kate

Instead of 1 can of green chilies, grab 2.  I added one full can to the chicken mixture because I was worried there'd be no flavor.  I added about a heaping cup of shredded Mexican cheese to the chicken mixture as well.   I also grabbed a rotisserie chicken from the super market earlier in the day, knowing I was going to try this, and shredded the whole thing for the mix.  Then at least 2 heaping cups of shredded cheese over the top.  Overall, it gets 4 stars for ease of preparation.  3 stars for flavor.  If I make again, I'll put some salsa in the mix as well.

We liked this concept and it made for nice leftovers...but I did make a couple of changes...I used half of the cheese and half of the green chiles inside the enchiladas and then used the rest for topping.  I also chopped up a tomato and used that to top it as well.  Served with chips and salsa and a small side salad and it made for a yummy meal.

Based on other reviews (thanks guys), I made a few changes and they were a big hit at the family Christmas party. I tripled the recipe. Sauteed onion, mushrooms, and garlic in olive oil, added fresh spinach until wilted. Added tsp. cumin, a little chili powder, and cayenne, Added 1 can of Rotel, undrained, but this was for a tripled recipe. Used a little more sour cream than the recipe stated. Drizzled green enchilada sauce on before adding cheese and baking, covered with foil. Took foil off for the last 3 minutes. With these changes, it was awesome. Thanks to other reviewers for their suggestions. This was my first time to make enchiladas.

Husband and I tried this recipe last night and it was a big hit. I did make one addition and used a can of green enchilada sauce. I warmed the sauce on the stove and then dipped the tortillas in the sauce instead of using oil. Also, I put half the cheese in the chicken mixture before rolling the tortillas.

I made a couple of small adjustments for more taste. When I cooked the chicken, for the last couple of minutes in skillet I added home-made taco seasoning (found on this site) . I had no chili's so I scattered red onion on the top of the enchiladas then the cheese.
Served with salsa and more sour cream - YUMMMM

Traditionally this type of enchilada is not very spicy so if you are looking for heat you will have to add some.  I thought they tasted great but mine were a little dry even after adding  cut up plum tomatoes and onions to the chicken mixture. I also added a sweet/hot pepper that I grew in my garden for some extra flavor too.   I did cook mine about 20 minutes because I wanted them to be a little brown on the edges.  They were pretty easy as well.

This was very good and easy to make. Next time I'll add some sautéed onion and garlic to the filling for a little more flavor.

This recipe was a little bland even though im not into spicy foods for health reasons it still lacked. As with any recipe i adapt them just a little but i added garlic and onions to this and used flour tortillas & Old el Paso Monterey cheese dip instead then sprinkled onions, peppers & Penzys Paprika on top for added taste. My additions made it pretty good, enuff to attempt again.

This was a hit at Christmas Eve dinner! Following others comments, I added Ro-tel tomatoes to the chicken, added some garlic and cumin seasoning.  I also mixed a can of cream of chicken soup, more sour cream and milk to the cheese for the topping.  We have a local seasoning called Raven that I sprinkled on top.  They were creamy, delicious and gone!

Easy and quick but glad I had tasted mix before completed dish - bland for my taste.  I added some sauteed onions and peppers, then some cumin to flavor mix. Put 1/2 cup salsa in pan before adding enchiladas and more on top and extra cheese. Next time will add even more spice as my family likes it.

Good basic recipe. Make it better by mixing a cup of green enchilada sauce to the chicken mixture. Use the rest of sauce to drizzle over top before baking. Don't sprinkle cheese over top until baked, add when taking from oven then let sit to melt. Yummy!

These are great - I use rotisserie chicken and more green chilies (frozen Bueno) and I don't need that much oil for frying - I just dipped the tortilla in the oil quickly - I put the oil in a small 8" fry pan.
