I thought this recipe was delicious. I did have problems with the coating as well. For the second batch I baked them half way then fried them but used a spatula to scoop them out instead of tongs. That seemed to work for me and it was fantastic with some hot sauce!

These were gorgeous and really tasty! I had the same problem as other reviewers that the coating wants to slide right off. I even dusted them in flour before the egg mixture hoping that would help. Just had to be real careful turning them and picking them up to eat. Nice and crunchy and flavorful!

the pretzel coating doesn't stick well to the cooked chicken. I did blend up the pretzel pieces in the blender as opposed to using a rolling pin, that worked well. The tenders were okay, not sure if I'd make them again. I really liked the blue cheese dipping sauce!

I liked the flavor of this chicken and also it was very tender. For some reason though, I had trouble getting the pretzel coating to really stick. I found that when I added a bit less oil to the pan and mixed some finely ground plain bread crumbs with the pretzels that helped some. I would definitely grind the pretzels well. I would even suggested a food processor or blender. The large pieces do not adhere as well as the ground pretzel after cooking. It was very quick to make for a fast meal. I preferred them without a dipping sauce but served some yogurt ranch with them. We are just not a fan of blue cheese dressing despite it being traditional and I did not want it going to waste. This would be a good recipe for a quick weekend meal. ty
