7.10.17  Cinnamon and cardamon are two of my favorite spices, and they’re a good partner to coffee.  Followed the recipe to the letter, even pouring in the condensed milk mixture over the back of a spoon.  The milk portion sunk to the bottom of the mug, and that’s OK.  The one thing that I didn’t care for was how the spices puddled around the top of the mug, and I'm not sure why that happened.  The recipe doesn’t say to stir together, but I have to wonder if this may have helped a bit.  And that’s not  to say that I didn’t like this because the flavor is very good, and it certainly was refreshing.This reviewer is an Allrecipes Allstar.
