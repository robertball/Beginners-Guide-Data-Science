Came out very salty, added regular mayo but still too salty.
It may be the fault of the brand of salt I am using. Can’t get Diamond brand I’ve used for 60 yrs so using store brand. I used to find Morton brand too salty also. Disappointed because mixture cam together so beautifully with my immersion blender. I will try again sometime after I buy different brand of salt
