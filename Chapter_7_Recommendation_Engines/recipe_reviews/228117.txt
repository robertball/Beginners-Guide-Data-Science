This is a delicious salad but for a more healthy take, cut out the butter and frying altogether.  You don't need to toast the ramen noodles (I use Ichiban) because they are already crunchy.  To get the nutty flavour from the walnuts, I simply chop then place in the oven at 200 degrees for about five minutes or until toasted (keep an eye on them).

I make this salad once a week, and it's a hit with all my guests! I substitute balsamic vinegar for the red wine vinegar, and have found that 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, and 2 tsp soy sauce is enough for this 8-serving salad. Any more and the lettuce would be dripping! The dressing IS important for softening up the broccoli, however, so I let it sit for 15-20 minutes before serving. Toss the crunchy noodles and walnuts in right before serving so the noodles don't get too soggy. Like other reviewers, I had no problem cutting the butter down to 1-2 tbsp when frying the noodles (which should DEFINITELY be broken into tiny crumbles), and toasting the walnuts in the oven. I've also thrown the walnuts in raw and I've never had a complaint.

DELICIOUS! I halved the recipe, but when I went to make the ramen/nut topping, I accidentally forgot to 1/2 that, lol, so I just used the whole thing in there (it was sooo good that I didn't want to waste it!). Oh, and I never buy unsalted butter, so I used regular salted butter. I made the dressing earlier in the day in a jar and just shook it randomly to make sure the sugar was dissolved, which worked out well and allowed the flavors to blend. Seriously, I could've drank the dressing, that's how good it was! This salad was just all around good...like you couldn't stop eating it good. I will def be making this one a lot~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Make sure you break the ramen up really small or its hard to eat. The dressing is delicious, but makes a ton. I tossed the salad in 1/3 of the amount I made and put the rest on the side and no one used the extra.

Always a crowd pleaser! Be sure not to cook the nut/ramen noodle mixture too long or it will burn.

This is a fabulous salad.  Try adding dried cranberries, or mandarin oranges and some left over chicken.  I make the dressing with splenda so I can control the sugar.  I have also replaced the ramen noodles with slivered toasted almonds instead of the walnuts to keep the crunch without the added butter.  I also have added other greens like baby spinach, or a handful of broccoli slaw.  This salad is so versital.  Fabulous as written but don't be afraid to mix it up and make it your own

I really liked this salad.  I think it's a great recipe.  I'm not sure why, but only 1/2 of it got eaten at the work potluck.  It didn't go over nearly as well as the usual cabbage/ramen noodle salad.  Maybe I'll try it with my family some day as I did like it.

Pecans work just as well in this recipe. Some even prefer the milder pecan over the walnuts.

Great way to have crunch and your veggies! Only change I made was toasting the nuts and ramen in the oven.
