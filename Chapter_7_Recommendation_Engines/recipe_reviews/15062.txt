I've made this about 8 times now... I've done different flavors and had great success. Used brown sugar instead of white for a butterscotchy flavor, added lemon extract and zest for lemon pudding, and added chocolate chips for choccy pudding. Tonight I made choccy and put it in a baked pie crust and topped with whipped cream... 3 adults and 2 kids finished it off in 1 sitting.

This was delicious!  I doubled the recipe and substituted double flour for the cornstarch.

This is a great recipe to add just about anything to.  My family loves it for banana pudding, and butterscotch pudding.

I ran out of eggs because I just made a quiche but I still wanted pudding so I gave this recipe a try. While it did thicken up nicely, I think the texture was kind of funny. It was almost gummy. While it was warm it was good, but once it chilled I didn't like it as much. I subbed maple extract for the vanilla and got a maple pudding from this recipe. I think I'll try to stick with the egg type puddings, but thanks anyway.

Thanks for this recipe.  I will never buy a package of pudding again.  It is very easy, and oh, so yummy.  I added a pinch of cinnamon as well.

Fabulously easy recipe!  I substituted the sugar with evaporated cane juice crystals (a more unprocessed sugar), cut down the vanilla to 1/4 tsp, and added 1 T of unsweetened cocoa powder to make chocolate pudding.  It set up perfectly!  This one will be a staple in my cookbook.

My kids didn't like it too much, I guess they are used to instant pudding and pudding cups.  I liked it as did my hubby.  I didn't like how water settled on top though, it thinned it out.

For a basic pudding recipe, it cooked up well, and had a good flavor.  I would make it again, and maybe add other flavors, cookie pieces, candy chips, etc.

I will be looking for a better pudding recipe.  It was thin and needs more corn starch, and is a little bland.  It could be doctored up...

I used this recipe to make a banana pudding for my husband's birthday. It was much easier to make than I thought it would be, although more labor intensive than what I'm used to :) But it was a big hit with the family, even my ultra-picky, name-brand loyal, husband.

I didn't make any changes to the ingred. but I did cook the pudding in the microwave!  I put all ingred. in a very large bowl, whisked it, then set the timer for 2 minutes.  I stirred every minute after, until the pudding was thick.  I was more than happy with my creamy, easy, homemade pudding!
YUM, now that's comfort food!

I've been searching for a way to make a coconut cream pie filling without all the egg,as I have egg allergies, and this was wonderful. It made the perfect creamy filling. I did make modifications. I used coconut palm sugar instead of regular sugar. I used 1 cup of coconut cream and 1.5 cups of whole milk to = the 2.5 cups of milk it called for. I ended up leaving out the vanilla and adding natural coconut extract. It turned out nice a creamy and the perfect consistency.Thanks!I'll be trying this recipe with different flavorings.

I added a tablespoon of cocoa powder, a teaspoon of instant coffee, and 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon, and it was delicious. It's a great recipe even without my editions.
Thank you.

This is exactly what i was looking for, a vanilla pudding recipe without eggs, and it came out perfect!  you do have to cook it for a very long time, but its worth it not to have any preservatives in it like the store bought kind.  Thank you!

I love the pudding, as does the rest of my family. I make it as is or add chocolate chips to it. Just make SURE you stir the mixture constantly, otherwise the bottom of your pot can get scorched!

Very good. Lots of stirring. Didn’t need to buy anything special - common ingredients you likely have around. Fresh homemade pudding, no chemicals or artificial ingredients. Tastes fresh and yummy.

It was great! I used vanilla soy milk instead of dairy milk and used no vanilla. I also added bananas and added chocolate chips to half.

Very good! I make it with soy milk. I sometimes add 3 TBSP. cocoa powder and cut the vanilla to 1 tsp. to make chocolate pudding. I like that too.

Using a whisk to mix it well keeps it from being lumpy.  You have to cook it until it's thickening.  This is a good example of how pudding used to taste before so many instant puddings were available.  I have also used this as a cream pie filling.  If you add some miniature marshmallows and a quick stir while it's hot it makes an interesting surprise for kids.

This is an excellent pudding.  It's way better than any packaged mix, most of which will start to separate after a day or two. This (at least what was left) was still in fine shape three days later.  I made this for dirt pudding for our senior center lunch on Wednesday - yeah with the gummy worms and flowers "growing" out of the "dirt". Great consistency - an excellent pudding to which you can add fruit or eat by itself.  I made it with 2% milk and was generous with the vanilla extract.  I also replaced 2/3 of the sugar requirement with store brand of Splenda to accommodate the diabetics. Everyone enjoyed the custard.  Oh, I also took the suggestion of one of the other reviewers to add a bit of food coloring - great idea - white custard just doesn't have the same appeal as one with a bit of color.  Thanks to the recipe poster - this is a winner!

This was easier that I thought it would be and it turned out great.  I used half whole milk and half fat free milk and it still thickened up perfectly.

I'm currently living in a small city in China and don't have access to box pudding (or easy/cheap access to butter), and I wanted to make dirt pudding (with Oreo crumbles and gummy worms) to celebrate Halloween, so I tried this recipe. 

I added a few tablespoons of cocoa powder to give it a chocolatey flavor. Other people used chocolate chips; I think that's probably better, as the cocoa powder clumped and refused to completely mix in, even after several minutes of stirring. (But it tasted fine, and for dirt pudding, having clumps of cocoa powder was perfect!) Everyone liked it, and the texture was perfectly pudding-y. 
 I followed the directions and it came out exactly the way it was supposed to. I also wasn't very exact with my measurements, not having American measuring cups, but it still came out just fine.

In my opinion this recipe is better than the box vanilla jello instant pudding. I used raw sugar(used a food processor to make the raw sugar finer) instead of the white sugar.

i have tried this one and the chocolate pudding from scratch and they are both good, use your judgement on the vanilla extract, some people like it more vanillaouy..? but not to sweet, and goes great with whip topping or canned or fresh fruit.  They produce six half cup servings, very satisfying.

My husband recently had 2 teeth pulled so I made this for him. I added 1 1/2 cup nestle chocolate chips right before I took it off the heat. It was really good and he devoured it fast. Will need to triple the recipe next time.

The texture was nice & the flavor was decent. I would definitely recommend sticking to the recipe, no flour or Brown sugar, having tried several variations on those for substitution. For what the recipe describes itself as, it is quite satisfactory.
