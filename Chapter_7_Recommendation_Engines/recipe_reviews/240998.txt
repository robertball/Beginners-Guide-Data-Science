First of all I cut the recipe down to 1/4 of the ingredients.  I had a touch of salmon left over from last night's dinner and wanted to use that up, but it wasn't enough so I also had a 7-oz can of tuna that I used, too.  Also I opted for the submitter's suggestion of using grapes.  I portioned out all the ingredients from the mayo down and added some to the salmon and the rest to the tuna for our lunch today.  Both were good, though my husband preferred the mix with the tuna.  This is a nice take of the protein salad mixes that are out there.  I would make this again!  Thanks for our lunch, CARLISFAMILY!

I just made this. I gave it a 3 star because of how much mayo is called for! 1/2 cup is to much seems to take away from the salmon flavor. Other than that itâ€™s good

Awesome!  I hate salmon but made this for my boyfriend for lunch and he made me try it because it was so good!  I followed the recipe exactly only using a yellow onion because I didn't have a red one. I will definitely be making this again!

Made this recipe with light miracle whip instead of mayo. Delicious!
