I followed this recipe to the T and I have of the mixture melted to the botoom of my oven - it bubbled and over flowed out of the crust - what a disaster!

Use a deep dish pie pan/crust as instructed and you'll be fine with the overflow issue.

It's an ABSOLUTE! must that you use a baking sheet under this pie. Unless you like to clean ovens. Other than that the pie is wonderful.

I have made this recipe several times and followed it to the T!  I get requests to make this often!  It's very rich so small pieces work just fine!  Wonderful when served slightly warm with vanilla ice cream!

This was ok but not the wow that I read in the reviews. Next time I will melt my choco chips and incorporate them into my syrup mixture. Since I was left with whole chips. I was embarrassed when it came time to serve this one. My guy's ate it but it didn't fly off their plates.

I made this for Easter dinner this year. My family loved. It has just a hint of German Chocolate and the chocolate chips make it wonderful!!!

This recipe was easy and came out wonderfully, everyone loved it. I added a small bit of a German Chocolate bar into the melted butter because I wasn't sure how chocolately the choc. chips alone would make it. It just happened to be the right amount. The pie is very rich, so if you have a termperamental stomach, don't eat a big piece of it at a time.

Easy and delicious. It does bubble over so definitely put a cookie sheet lined with foil beneath for easy clean up.

I made this for Thanksgiving, it will become a holiday favorite, it is terrific! Cook it on a cookie sheet, it overflows the pie crust a little.

I’m looking forward to serving this pie tomorrow for Thanksgiving dinner. I’m also wondering if anyone will care if I go ahead and get a slice now.

Came out looking and smelling perfect. My word of advice use a deep dish pie shell.
