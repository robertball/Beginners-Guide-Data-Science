These muffins are INCREDIBLE! I didn't have any nuts and I used dried cranberries. I also added one and a half tsp. of apple pie spice. one tsp. would have done the job. these muffins are very moist which almost puts them on the rich scale. YUM, oh and the streusel topping? THE BOMB! thanks so much shorecook for sharing your wonderful recipe :)

We loved them but i did change a few things to make them a bit healthier.  Instead of 1 1/2 cups of flour I used 1 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of oats. I only used 3/4 cup of sugar and for the 1/2 cup of butter is used 3 tablespoons of butter and 4 tablespoons of vanilla yogurt. I sprinkled the top of the unbaked muffins with a little brown sugar and oats.  I did not add nuts just because by girls don't care for them.  With my changes the muffins were around 150 calories per muffin.

These turned out wonderfully. I used butter instead of margarine and pecans instead of walnuts. My husband, who says he doesn't especially like muffins, loved these and so did all the guys at his work. I was going to add apple pie spice as suggested by someone, but I forgot. I will make these again and will probably add the spice and throw in some more cranberries--I loved the tart flavor they added. The topping made too much for me for the 12 muffins, so I froze the rest to use later. The only issue I had was that the batter was super thick, almost like cookie dough. I couldn't "fold" the zucchini mixture into it. I was glad I hadn't pressed any of the water out of my zucchini. I had to use the hand mixer to incorporate it all in the batter. I was a little concerned with how thick the batter still was, but they turned out beautiful, moist and delicious! *Update- these froze very well!

Loved them! I just added some nutmeg and cinnamon but they were wonderful. Gave one to my daughters 10 year old friend and she loved them and had no clue they had veggies in them :) Thank you so much

I made the recipe exactly as listed.  They were moist and flavorful.  Anytime SHORECOOK creates a recipe it is sure to be good.  I used frozen cranberries.

Wow, what a great flavor.  I was a little concerned that the fresh berries would be too tart, but not a chance.  Love the flavor.  I will definitely be making the again soon.

Very tasty! I especially like the tanginess the cranberries add to the recipe. I replaced the margarine with 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce, and also cut the sugar a little. I only made half of the topping, and that was enough. Thanks for the recipe!

Seriously - unexpectedly great muffins!
I did not do the top crumble - I was short on butter - and they really are delicious without a topping.
Very moist , great  flavor - and I used Ocean Spray craisins instead of fresh cranberries.
Just an FYI to those that have never cooked with zucchini - i was worried before I added the grated zucchini that the mixture was very dry. 
But clearly the zucchini adds a lot of moisture because the muffins are VERY moist.
Absolutely will make again!

Tried this last night to attempt to use up some of the zucchini from the garden. I loved it! I took some tips from others and used less sugar and added some cinnamon. I also made them in mini muffin tins so they would be a little more kids friendly. I used dried cranberrys and they turned out wonderfully! Moist and delicious! Everyone including my husband who is super picky gobbled them up. I made a double batch today to take some to work with me and for the kids to snack on while at grandmas. Will for sure make again

I made this recipe exactly as posted and think it is a bit too sweet.  There is another zucchini bread recipe on this site, that is named either Mom's Zucchini Bread or Grandma bread, that I will add fresh cranberries to.

Great recipe!  Delicious muffins with a wonderful balance of flavors!  I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, used butter instead of margarine, and I think I will add a few more cranberries next time (which will probably be later today!).  I recommend using fresh cranberries--they help make the muffins extra special.   Definitely try this recipe, you won't be disappointed!

Absolutely delicious. This has been the first zucchini muffins I have made. It is incredible. I made it with my 4 and 2 1/2 year olds, who eagerly gobbled it up (before which my 4 yr old said "yuk" to zucchini) but no "yuk" to these muffins.

It came out great and very tasty. I was worried because the "batter" was abnormally dry, however, the muffins came out delicious. I thought it was odd that there was no liquid in the recipe, but went ahead with it anyway. I made it with 50% whole wheat flour, maybe that is why it was so dry? I also added some orange zest! I will certainly make these again.

Loved this recipe!  I made these muffins for my birthday treat to take to school.  I made as written, only using mini muffin pans, yielding 36 minis and one small loaf of bread instead of 12 muffins.  They were a HUGE hit with everyone who tried them.  I printed the recipe for one co-worker and she made them last night.  Because I was making mini muffins, I chose to shred the cranberries in the mini chopper.  I did so from the frozen state and baked while the cranberries were still frozen.  SHORECOOK, a wonderful recipe that will be used again.  Thank you!

These were delicious.  I made as written, with two small changes due to what I had available: I used butter in place of margarine and I realized too late that I was out of vanilla extract and only had 1/2 tsp left.  I made up the reminder called for by scraping the insides of a vanilla bean into the bowl.  My batter was very thick and I was concerned about how the final product would turn out, but to my happiness, these muffins were moist and tasty.  We thought the flavor was similar to a cookie.  Surprisingly, these were even better the second day because the fresh cranberries softened up overnight.

These are so delicious! Didn't change recipe at all, except used butter instead of margarine. Mine came out light and airy! Batter is thick, but don't worry they come out perfect. Used frozen cranberries. Nice combo of tartness and sweet. OMG, a keeper for sure! Thank you shorecook! UPDATE 8/17/14- Made a version of these with frozen raspberries, and they were spectacular!  I think I may even like them better with the raspberries.

Great recipe!  Thanks for developing it!  My 2 year old helped with the topping and he calls the muffins, "too good!"  I doubled the recipe, and had enough batter for 24 muffins and a small loaf.

So yummy!  The only changes I made was to exchange pecans for walnuts, and I sprinkled them with cinnamon/sugar instead of making the crumb topping. I also used dried craisins instead of fresh cranberries.   A great way to use up zucchini!  The cranberries add a nice zing! Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

Yum! These are the best muffins I have ever made. My son and husband enjoyed them so much. I made a few minor changes like using real butter, leaving off the streusel topping (it's not needed, but I'm sure it's delicious). I used white whole wheat flour and frozen cranberries, also I added pumpkin pie spice because it makes everything better. These are good enough for Christmas morning! If I make them again I might try using less sugar for health reasons, not because they were too sweet.

Great recipe! I used butter instead of margarine and cut sugar (used 3/4 cup). Instead of 1 cup cranberries I used 1/2 cup of cranberries and 1/2 cup of golden raisins. Amazing!

I've been making these for years and love this recipe!  I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and use butter instead of margarine.  One of my go to's.  My son calls these "Christmas muffins" because of the green and red going into the batter.

Excellent! I made one substitution because I misread the recipe and I bought craisins instead of fresh cranberries. They were delicious. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Lots of streusel topping - just the way I like it.  The only complaint I have about these is that the tops aren't nice and rounded.  My google research suggests either turning the oven to 400 or squeezing some of the liquid out of the zucchini.  These are tasty enough to make again, trying those things.

Turning the oven to 400 and subbing 1/2 c oatmeal for 1/2 c of flour gave these nice rounded tops.

Very good, I adjusted recipe to the amount of Zucchini I had on hand  about 25% Next time I might use a little less sugar and brown sugar.

Started making this but got confused. Author never says if step 2 or 3 is the topping. In step 3 she says to beat the egg and vanilla Interlibrary the "butter" mixture (is that the one with butter from step 2 or the margarine mixture in step 3. Again In step 4 the flour mixture is supposed to go in the "butter mixture" bowl, which is the bowl in step 2, but I would think that is the crumble for on top. The bowl in step 3 has margarine, but I think that is for the muffins. So, I didn't make these and will try again if this is ever made clear.

I made a triple batch of these for a bake sale at church.  Every one of them sold!  I did add some cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter for a little spice but other than that, I made this recipe as is.  The muffins where wonderful, even my 9 year old son who hates anything with nuts, green stuff or cranberries ate one and liked it :)  That's really miraculous.  This recipe will be added to my collection.  It also makes a great breakfast muffin.

Farm Fresh Zucchini Cranberry Muffins Haiku: "Nice, tasty muffin. I skipped on the sweet topping, & I'm glad I did." These were very sweet muffins so I'm glad that I opted to pass on the streussel topping (I was also serving these to a pre-school playgroup and didn't want to gamble on the nuts.) Grated zucchini adds such lovely moisture to muffins, and the flecks of green coupled with the red cranberry made for a nice prelude to the holiday season.

I did not make any changes. They were fairly simple to make and I received lots of complements. Even my boss who didn't want to try them because she didn't like zucchini. She tried them and said wow, I am impressed they're really good!!!

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it turned out very well. I made a second recipe using blueberries and that also baked up well. I used less topping on the second batch of muffins because of the sweetness of the blueberries.

I used dried cranberries that I partially rehydrated (that's all I had) and doubled the walnuts for an extra protien punch. I also didn't add the streusel topping because I forgot! These are my new favorite muffins by far!!

Yum!!!  So easy and so delicious!  I used dried cranberries because that's what I had and they were the bomb!  I'll definitely be making these many many more times.  Thanks!

Wonderful muffins! I made them as stated,  except the first time all I had were dried cranberries. I soaked them in boiling water for a bit before I added them. Worked great!

Not what I was expecting at all. If your looking for something sweet, these are the ticket. I'll find a different recipe for zucchini muffins.

I will probably not make this recipe again. It was dry. I didn't think 1 cup of zucchini was enough or perhaps it needed cooking oil. Maybe it was because i used a cup of dried cranberries.

These are yummy! I made a double quantity and made 12 muffins and a loaf. I only made a single quantity of the topping and even this was too much. I freezed the rest which I think is enough for 2 dozen muffins still! I used butter instead of marg, plus brown sugar in the recipe, and pecans instead of walnuts. I also used less sugar, but think that next time, I will halve the sugar quantity. I used frozen cranberries that were so tart that we have not been able to eat them, and I thought if I used too little sugar, the tartness would take over. But it didn't. The batter was very thick but the muffins and loaf came out really moist and delicious. I will definitely make these again!
