To date only nine people have reviewed this recipe over the course of 5-1/2 years and it's such a shame as this is one, awesome cake in so many ways! I hope this review (and my posted pics) will change that! It's very moist, with a large, fluffy, but light and tender crumb. It definitely is fun and pretty, and you can clearly taste the distinct flavor of each of the lime, lemon and orange layers, each as delicious as the next. Given the mixed reviews for the filling and frosting, however, I did not use those particular recipes though I did prepare it with a lemon filling and an orange buttercream - specifically, "Lemon Cream," and "Golden Orange Frosting" - both great recipes as well and both complemented the cake nicely. This is much more labor intensive and time consuming than your average layer cake, but so worth the effort! This was a home run, not just for hubs and I, but with his staff as well. This cake will do any baker proud!

Since posting this recipe, many months ago, I have an addendum: if you'd like the layers to taste even more citrus-y, add lemon oil, lime oil, and orange oil to each respective layer. It makes the flavor stand out a lot more!!

This cake is FANTASTIC!!  Here in Louisiana, it is sometimes hard to find recipes that are light enough to serve in the summer yet still presentable enough for any important occasion...  I baked this one for my mom-in-law's retirement party, and there wasn't a scrap left!  I'm here printing it again a year later to bake it for a baby shower I'm hosting...  

Here's something I did to decorate the cake:  I stuck with the original recipe, because I like the delicate flavoring of the citrus fruits (I'm sure the oils makes it wonderful, but I like the light flavor!) and I candied orange, lemon and lime peels and used them to decorate the sides of the cake!  It's a really easy way to add to the cake without overwhelming it!   (Brandi, Baton Rouge, LA)

This cake is awesome. A bit of work but well worth it.  The 1st time I made it, it did take a a lot of time.  After then I organized my work to help the process flow smoothly.  Preheat oven,  preparing the pans and set aside 3 bowls for each layer (preferably the same size).  Next grate the fruit,set aside.  Then shift dry ingredients and set aside.  Now start the actual creaming and mixing.  

After the cake goes into the oven, start the filling.  While the filling is cooling start the frosting.

The amount of shortening frightened me and I wanted to cut down on prep time, so I made an adaptation of this recipe using a white cake mix.  I used zests as directed but added a tablespoon of lime juice, orange essence, and lemon extract for an extra punch of flavor.  The lime layer turned out to be the most mild in flavor and the orange came out tasting quite artificial.  I used jarred lemon curd between the layers and then frosted with Cool Whip; so lots of changes, but much quicker and a little lighter in fat and calories.

Everyone loved this cake when I baked for a birthday party this past weekend.  Based on the reviews, I did use a different lemon curd recipe than the one linked to here.  But I prepared the cake more or less exactly as called for in the recipe, minus the food coloring and possibly a little extra zest.  I didn't find the cake especially complicated to prepare, and though it was kind of time consuming, that was only because I only had one cake round and had to bake off each layer one at a time.  Thanks!

Excellent cake, tasty, tall, and very showy when cut and the rainbow layers are exposed.  I will try and sharpen the lime, lemon and orange flavors next time by adding a little lime, lemon and orange oil to each corresponding cake layer.  However, the cake was fantastic when the recipe was followed to the T.

Not bad but not the best cake I've had.  I love citrus so this recipe intrigued me.  Cake was dry and frosting a little too sweet for my tastes.  Leftover cake went uneaten.

i didn't think the zest was quite enough flavour, you could barely taste it.  so i added some juice to each layer, and that really helped.  i put a little less lemon juice in the filling b/c i thought it was too strong.  but after those minor adjustments i thought the cake was very good.

This cake is awesome.  It makes a very pretty cake and a converstation starter.  It requires a bit of work but the end results are well worth the labor.

Fabulous!!!!! Brought this to a cookout and everyone loved it. The cake was so fragrant and light. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of doubling the frosting, I really love frosting. :)

The cake itself was delicious!  But... making it was a nightmare!  It took me four hours just to make this one cake! 
Each indivisual cake took forever and the filling, frosting and assembly took a while too.  Everything about the taste of the cake was delicious, but the prep took forever.

Excellent recipe! I just love the presentation and flavor of this cake. So pretty! I made the cake itself as written and loved the subtle but still tasty citrus flavors. The texture was firm yet moist (those who found it dry almost definitely over-baked it. This is the number one reason for dry cakes). I used a jar of Dickenson's lemon curd and my own recipe for buttercream frosting that I flavored orange. But honestly, I am totally baffled by the reviewers who think this is an overly-time consuming cake. I can only assume that they are comparing this to making a box cake, and even then, this is takes only slightly more time to prepare. I had the cake prepared, in their pans and in the oven in less than 20 minutes. Delicious and truly easy to make.

This cake was really fun to make and was a hit with both kids and adults at my friend's 4th of July cookout.

I added lemon extract, orange extract, and lime juice to make the layers really flavorful. I also made a basic buttercream frosting with just a bit of the orange extract. I didn't want to over-power the flavors in the cake. On the whole though, it's a great recipe!

Holy smokes! This is an incredible recipe. I've had my eye on it for *years*, but there are a lot of cake recipes in the world. I'd been waiting for a worthy occasion, because it's a ton of work. Today we said farewell to a beloved coworker who's moving on to a new company; since she loves citrus as much as I do, this was the recipe I chose. I followed naples34102's suggestion and made my own lemon curd and an orange Italian meringue buttercream, as well as a limoncello simple syrup. (naples34102 also set the bar pretty high with her beautiful cake assembly/décor). Instead of citrus zests, I used 1/4 teaspoon each of Boyajian's orange, lime, and lemon oils in the respective layers. I baked the layers ahead of time, let them cool, and wrapped them in plastic on cardboard cake circles. Yesterday I made the simple syrup, lemon curd, and buttercream, and assembled the cake. This is perfect for a tea party, Mother's Day, Easter…it's very spring- and summer-like with its sherbet colors. Worth the work!

FUN.  Yes, the cake is a lot of work, but it's so special.  I've never seen anything like this anywhere else... neither as the eater or the chef.  And what a fascinating combination of flavors and colors. // I was, honestly, grossed out by using shortening, but the end product is tasty.  And by the time you're eating it, you've already forgotten what went into it. // I separated the layers with store-bought lemon curd (get the runnier kind, versus the thick gel), and then made the "Golden Orange Frosting" from this site.  I love them both with this cake. // This was my first time making the cake, and from preheating to the last washed dish, this took me 3 hours on the dot. // I would absolutely make this again.

I think of this cake as a "happy" cake!   It made me smile when I saw the picture and that prompted me to make it.  I made the cake  according to the recipe.  It was a huge hit.  So pretty and tasty.  The texture is denser than a mix but we really liked it.

I did not use  the accompanying lemon filling  or icing recipes.  Instead, I used the  Golden Orange Frosting suggested by another reviewer.  To replace the raw egg (because of potential health concerns), I substituted an 8-ounce  package of cream cheese and adjusted the icing sugar accordingly.  Lots of frosting.  Fantastic flavour.

Loved the end result and so did my family.

Great cake, made it for Easter took the advise of using the golden orange frosting and lemon cream filling. My grandkids loved this cake. I did use Swans Down cake flour instead of all purpose.  Will definitely make this again!!!

I've made this cake several times, and it's always a big hit.  I don't understand all the problems some of you had, this is a pretty simple cake. I'm 74 years old, and when I was a kid my mother used to bake this for the family, in a coal or wood fired cook stove.  I'm still using the same pan's she used.  She always used lemon curd for the filling, and I'm still using the same recipe.  She made the frosting with whipped cream held up with powdered sugar.  Never had to worry about left over cake either.  I still don't.  The whipped cream/cream cheese frosting is a little different when I make it, I use powdered sugar, and more of it, the frosting stands up better this way.

This is a very delicious cake and I get many requests for it.  I add 1 tbsp lemon oil, lime oil,  and orange oil to the respective later; otherwise, the flavor is too subtle and not worth all the work. I haven't tried the orange icing.  I just use the lemon curd to cut back on the sweetness

Cake is much easier to put together than it sounds. Cake bakes up beautifully and is very sturdy but is dry. Perhaps I baked a little too long or there is too much baking powder which contributed to the dryness. Great eye candy when sliced!

Made it for Easter with great success ! I followed the original recipe as written but tried to make it lighter by skipping the creamcheese cream, replaced with quitten jam.
Also I changed the "all citrus" flavor for a "each colour a flavor" as followed :  a few drops of lemon flavor in the orange dough, a few drops of vanilla flavor in the yellow dough and a few drops of bitter almond flavor in the green dough.  That makes the cake really interesting and everybody likes it.
For more "Spring effect" I served it with the green colour on top and decorated with bunny gums candies :-)

This was a very tasty cake for a citrus lover's birthday. I wish I had been a little more careful when putting the cakes together. I didn't think about the colors, but it definitely looked better in the original poster's photo with green on the bottom, then yellow, then orange. Overall it still provides an interesting look. Fun to do something different.

This was an overall amazing cake!! With the changes that I made, I would say it's a 4 1/2 star cake. The zest was definitely not enough, and I found that even with the zest and a lot of lime juice, lemon juice and orange oil, it was not very much like that flavor. But, it definitely did not taste like plain vanilla! I suggest putting in about 4 tablespoons of zest, and then 3 or 4 tablespoons of the juice or oil.  The custard was my favorite part of the cake. Anyway, I really loved this cake!!

I had a special  double cake tin to make a giant cup cake  Cake, In looking for an interesting cake to make in it for a friend's  birthday I found this recipe. Unfortunately the cake tin only allowed for a double layer, but as I loved the citrus in this cake I  decided to make an orange and lemon layer with  a lime curd filling and orange frosting. I followed the recipe given apart from the Lime layer. I used the curd filling recipe  substituting the lemon with Lime.      The cake was lovely and moist and the tartness of the curd filling offset the  sweetness of the orange frosting.
Everyone loved the cake and  I was so pleased with it I intend to make  again, this time as a 3 layer cake.

Not bad. Needs a little tweaking.  I'm going to try it again with perhaps a bit more flavoring. I'm definitely not giving up yet. Also my coloring wasn't as distinct as the photo. I might need to bump that up also.

I made this for Easter since my husband is a big citrus fan.  I used three 8-inch pans (deep Wilton pans) so it made a very tall cake.  Also, I did not fill it with lemon curd, but instead made 3 flavors of citrus icing by combining two cups of powdered sugar, 5 T. softened butter, 1/2 t. zest (or more to taste) and enough juice to make a spreadable icing.  I then frosted each layer with its accompanying flavor of frosting.  It probably would have been just as good if I had made just one flavor of icing (take your pick!) and frosted all the layers with the same icing.  The cake crumb is delicate, but a little on the dry side (as most scratch cakes are).  Husband loved it.  I might make it again for a special occasion; otherwise it is too much cake for us.

This is a beautiful and delicious cake and I have made this cake repeatedly over many years. It is definitely my favorite and my family loves it. I like the idea of adding cream cheese to the frosting as it improves it. I also use the lime, orange and lemon oils to give it extra citrus flavor. I strongly encourage others to try it!

I made it for an 'all womens' party and everyone loved the cake.   
Some asked if they could take extras home to their husbands.  I did add juices into the cake mixes along with the zest to give it extra flavor and moisture and it worked out nice.  The frosting and the lemon filling topped them off well.

I loved this cake. It was fun to make and I’ll follow the directions better next time because I thought, Oh, how are you going to taste that lime...etc so I added extra zest and even a drop of essential lemon oil! That was just a bit strong, but...it still tasted amazing with vanilla ice cream! And when you slice the cake there is where the gorgeous pastel colors pop!!

I used butter instead of shortening and buttermilk instead of milk. That may be why the layers were a little fragile. But the taste was amazing, and we'll worth the effort in terms of the look!

I always end up adding more fruit zest to the recipe. And the lemon curd with the orange juice frosting is too sweet for me so I use cream cheese frosting and no curd.

Great recipe, even if you only use one flavour, which is what I usually do. My only remark is that I need to lower your oven temperature and longer baking to get a nice dense cake. Otherwise, prefect!

This cake tastes delicious!!  The only disappointment was that it didn't turn out coloured!  I followed the directions for zest and food colouring, but it's almost completely white.  Taste is unaffected, but the colourful rainbow effect wasn't there.  I used Clubhouse food colouring, so maybe the person who made the recipe used stronger colouring dye than that.  I'd add at least 10 -12 drops next time.  And yes, there WILL be a next time.  I also used lemon icing instead of orange cream icing.  Just personal preference for taste.

i made this cake,  i chose not to use  food coloring because of the dye. i made natural food coloring with spinach, carrots and mangoes, lime juice and zest, and lemon juice and zest. the natural color was challenging so the process took me six and a half hours. the colors are pretty but there isn't any citrus taste it's a nice yellow cake with butter cream frosting. it makes a nice presentation.

I had high hopes for this cake after reading all the glowing reviews but I was very disappointed.  This cake is very time consuming with making the 3 different cake layers and two different frosting and fillings.  The flavors did not seem to taste well together, especially the lime flavored layer.  My family did not care for it and I ended up trashing most of it.  Very disappointed that I had spent so much time on it but on a positive note it was a pretty cake.

Although my guests liked this cake, I think I'd like to add more flavour so I'm going to need to add more zest or more juice concentrate (vs. just straight juice).  Also, since the flavour of the cake is light, I found that the frosting was too heavy for the cake so I'm going to try a stabilized whipped cream frosting with zest.  Thanks for this wonderful idea though!  I will definitely make it again. :-)

It was fun to make but came out very dry even though I baked it for less time than it called for and I used cake flour so there was less gluten. My family didn't care for it.

I did not care for this recipe. The cake was very dry, even with the lemon curd. I had some colored candy dragees in pastel shades so the presentation was great! The buttercream was ok. I had to add more milk because it was too tight to spread but that was ok.

I did not care for this recipe. My cake layers were way too thin and too moist - very hard to work with. My lemon custard wouldn't set up, and my icing was way to thick to spread.

This is my favorite cake of all time.  I got it from Family Circle magazine, and I made it for my 21st birthday the year it came out.....and many times in between.   I wouldn't change a thing!
