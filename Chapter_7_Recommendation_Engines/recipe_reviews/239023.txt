I just made this and it's really nice! Nutty flavour. At first I thought it just looked like a pancake but it has a "breadier" texture. Today I am having it with home made guacamole on top...tomorrow perhaps AB&J ?

I really like this bread. I cut the recipe in half but still got 6 pieces of bread. The first 3 I added onion powder and garlic powder into the batter; then I added Italian seasoning into the last part of the batter. The spices really complement the bread.  It's similar to fried cornbread but not as gritty. Perfect for a handheld sandwich.

I made this as written tonight for my husband and myself, because we are eating low carb.  It was absolutely delicious.  It reminded me of a hoecake somewhat.  The batter was very thick, and I found it easier to put some in the pan and then let it fry for a minute before flipping it and flattening it with the a spatula to spread it. I may try thinning it with some water next time to see if I can make it a little easier to spread.  

I can't wait to try it as a sandwich bun tomorrow!

I love this recipe, it's very good, not eggy. Has a nutty flavor. I also made it with half coconut flour and half almond flour and the coconut flour gives it a bit of sweet and is a perfect combo with the nutty flavor of the almond flour. This is my go to Keto bread. It's so easy, so yummy!

I started making this bread a month ago. I bake the mix in my large muffin top pan which allows me to make them perfectly round and control the thickness, it also makes them the perfect size to put in the toaster. In some I add garlic powder, black pepper and sesame seeds, others I just add the sesame seeds. It tastes WONDERFUL, is super easy to make, holds together perfectly and (I am a diabetic) has drastically dropped my blood sugar since I have replaced any bread that I use to eat with this bread. VERY HAPPY!

I made it as is and it turned out great! I made it again today and powdered the almond flour and added an extra tablespoon of Greek yogurt, also added some spice. That thinned it out and made it better for a sandwich!

This bread is very good. I didn't bother with the mixer just used a whisk and it came together fine. Looking forward to experimenting with different herbs, spices, and cheeses. A winner for sure.

I wasn’t looking to make changes...used what I had at home and it still worked wonderfully. I had macadamia oil from a trip abroad, strawberry, banana yogurt, baking  powder not soda. So what I’m trying to say is works even if you need to change some things to use what you got!

Makes rather dandy pancakes, which can definitely be used like they are in the picture.

This is my go to sandwich bread.  I make a stack every weekend.  It tastes great and is easy to make.

This is really more like a bland pancake. I think it would hold up better than some of the other gluten-free breads I've tried, though and it's quite fast to whip up.

This recipe was good.  I only made a half batch to try it out and got four rounds, although if I had made them smaller (hamburger patty size) I probably could have gotten 5.
