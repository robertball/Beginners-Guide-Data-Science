This was divine!  My boyfriend and I made this for dinner this week and loved it.  Per the advice of other reviewers, we added cilantro and avocado to the mango salsa.  As we didn't want to fire up the grill, we pan fried the fish in butter after marinating.  We will definitely make this again!

Very good recipe, subtle, fresh, I will definitely make this dish again.  I pan fried the fish in butter because I like a little crispiness...  thank you!

HOLY MAJOLEY!!!! This was one of the best meals my husband and I have made!! We took the advice of the other reviews and added diced avodaco and cilantro, and used the George Forman grill (we dont have a BBQ) and it was Ah-MAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

The sweetness of the mango mixed with the spicy jalepeno is like a party in my mouth. We're making it again tomorrow. mmmmm!!

I was a bit worried that it would be too spicy - but we served this with rice (white & wild) and everyone LOVED it! - Even the kids!! My husband said it was the best fish he had had in a long time.

This was a great recipe. Something different and colorful. I'm not a big fan of fish but my family likes it. I was really impressed by this. I marinated the fish for a couple of hours. My local store did not have fresh jalapeno so I used pickled jalapeno slices...way too hot and I even put in less than the amount suggested. I will cut back even more next time or make it with fresh jalapeno. The leftover salsa was great to eat with tortilla chips the next day. I did add cilantro as other reviewers suggested because it is also my husbands favorite spice. Will make again.

Delish!!!  The recipe calls for Tilapia but I had Snapper so that is what I used and grilled on my indoor grill... I also, used cilantro instead of parsley in the salsa but other than that, I followed the directions... Yum Yum Yum!

This was good but not great, at least cooked in a pan (cause it's too cold out to grill). Very citrus-y. I didn't add avocado like others have suggested, though.

I live in Texas, my local HEB grocery store sells a mango salsa which is excellent. It also contains tomato and cilantro.  So much easier than making it yourself.  I seldom rate any recipe 5 stars, but this one was very good.  I baked the tilapia after marinating it.

I was looking for something different to do with fish.  Great recipe!  The jalapeno adds just the right amount of heat..not too much.  Very tasty!

DeLiCiOuS!!! The fish came out perfectly cooked and seasoned.  I live in the city without a yard or porch, so I can't have a grill. Instead I wrapped each fillet in aluminum foil and then baked them at 425 for 10 or 12 minutes on a cookie sheet.  I blended the salsa in a food processor and wasn't crazy about it, the fish was actually better without it.  I also doubled or tripled the amount of garlic.

Also, if you want to make delicious white rice (asian jasmine is my favorite) add these ingredients to the heating water (ingredients are per cup of rice);

add 1/3 a stick of butter,
1 bay leaf,
2 cloves of garlic (smashed),
cook with part chicken stock or add bullion or both to taste.

Fantastic! The Salsa is wonderful, I did use cilantro in lieu of parsley since I no longer have any parsley growing in the garden. I also added in one avocado as other reviewers suggested. I couldn't grill the tilapia due to heavy rain, so pan fried it instead in the same oil marinade. I served over a bed of white rice. By the way I used the whole, peppers, mango and avocado and made lots of salsa, what are you going to do with the rest anyway? Any leftover salsa would be good with chips. However we didn't' have any leftover.

This is a wonderful recipe but I would caution everyone to use cod, tuna, whitefish, trout, halibut, salmon - any fish but tilapia. The way tilapia is raised and processed is very bad for human consumption.

I skipped the basil in the marinade and used cilantro instead--didn't want too many competing flavors. The cilantro added to the salsa's flavors nicely. The mango salsa totally ROCKED this dish. I also used haddock getting the same stupendous results. If you want more crunch to the salsa add diced cucumber or even diced jicama--GO BOLD!

I loved this recipe!!  The fish turned out perfectly and the combination of the sweet mango, slight kick of the jalepeno with the crunch of the peppers and onion was delish!

Superb dish. After reading some other reviews and trying the recipe as is, I'm excited to try it again with the addition of avacado.

I would have to say this is one of the better meals i have made. It was a snowy day when this recipe caught my eye so I had to change just a few ingredients. For those of you who cook hispanic foods often you will know what im talking about when I say " I had to add cilantro and avacado to the mango topping, most of the time if it has lime, I will have to put at least cilantro and most of the time avacado as well" My family is partial to that so of course we thought it was great. I recommend this recipe for others who like talapia. Thanks for sharing!

Recipe is tasty. I made it then found out that tilapia is fake fish. No one ever goes fishing for tilapia. It's farmed in industry farming outfits. I'll make this again but use another white fish, like halibut, which would be every bit as good, but also real.

I prepared it following the recipe with one exception.  I grilled the talapia on foil but did not wrap in in foil.  Great flavor and an easy meal.

I used haddock and baked in the oven as it was raining out. My parents as well as my husband all LOVED it. The mango salsa was delicious with the fish! I served it with a lime and cilantro quinoa. Will definitely be making this again a few times this summer!

This was super easy and fun to cook. Grilled tilapia as instructed with exception of a lower temp. After 8 minutes, 4 on each side, turned grill off and left fish in grill for about 10 minutes on top burners to keep it warm. Flavor delicious with salsa and rice.

I  will leave out the onion next time, per hubby's request.  I used one each red, yellow, and orange mini peppers and cooked the fish on the stovetop instead of the grill.  Good stuff!

total yumm!!
We did not flip the tilapia but left it on a couple minutes longer - which would typically have overcooked the fish.  But with it sealed in foil it stayed juicy and delicate.  Also I marinated the fish for 3 hours - not necessary but I had other things to prepare.  The salsa was great.  I didn't used the juices...

This was a light and refreshing dinner. We grilled the fish as the recipe suggested and it was perfect. I added some peaches to the salsa but that was the only change I made. My husband said he could eat this almost every week. I would seriously recommend trying this recipe but grill the fish. We used a gas grill on medium high.

This was delicious. Next time, I’ll make a bigger batch of the salsa. I used half the pepper in the marinade and thought it was fine. Next time I won’t add any salt. Thought it was a bit salty.

I loved this recipe. It was raining so I broiled the fish on low for about 5 min. On each side. In the salsa I added avocado. I will cut the mango up a littler smaller next time, and there will be a next time.

I made this last night and my wife and I both loved it. I have to admit, I made a few changes but the overall result was excellent. We are putting this on our "make often" list.

The changes I made are: 1. cooked the fish under the broiler since it is raining here; 2. replaced Tilapia with Mahi Mahi (what we had on hand); 3. because Mahi is thicker than Tilapia I adjusted the cooking time. Everything else remained the same, all the ingredients, the salsa, marinating time, etc.

Both the fish and the salsa were wonderful. I was tempted to add some red pepper flakes to the salsa and may do so the next time since we like our food with a little kick.

We also made the suggested basmati rice with lemon and ginger. It was quite flavorful and paired well with the fish and we will include it when we make it the next time.

Two caveats: First, there are a lot of ingredients to this dish and I dirtied a lot of little bowls chopping two teaspoons of this and four teaspoons of that. Thank goodness for dishwashers; and Second - USE GLOVES to handle the mango and don't touch your face. Mango skin contains urushiol - the same oil found in poison ivy and oak. It caused my wife to have "mango mouth" (see here https://www.verywellhealth.com/mango-allergy-82833) - a severe swelling of the lips plus a red itchy rash.

Be careful in your preparation and you will enjoy this dish immensely.

And thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Great recipe.  Love the mango salsa.  A first for us. However do believe we would have liked the Crisp on the Talipia  if it had been grilled on the silicone grill  sheet.  Wonderful.  Will definitely try it again.  Most likely next week.    We love fish!!!!

I can not tell you how many pork butts I've smoked over the years but I will anyway...lots.  All smokers register temps differently and here is a good overall tip. Usually temp gauges are near the top of the smoker where it's hottest while the temp where the meat is will ALWAYS be lower. Check your smoker by putting a thermometer at meat level and set the smoker to that temp, not the hotter temp at the top of the smoker. On mine there is a 20-25 degree difference between the two.  Like others, yellow mustard is good to coat the roast with before you put the rub on and it helps adhere the rub to the roast.  Never do half in the oven then half in the smoker. Ok to do the flip of that but if you go oven first you won't get as much smoke Flavor. True pulled pork sandwiches are served with Cole slaw, not on the side Yankees but between the pork and bun. There are a thousand different rubs and the one here is a great place to start but experiment til you find one that really hits your mark. It is not rocket science but it does take time and patience and after both you will be justly rewarded. If not having leftovers is an issue, smoke butts  because the meat freezes well. Enjoy the joy of smoking and enjoy this recipe.

I was looking for a yummy, healthy dinner and this was perfect! My local store didn't have fresh tilapia so I used rockfish instead. Added cilantro and pineapple to the salsa and cut back on the orange juice. For the fish I put the fillets in foil packets and cooked them  on the grill with indirect heat (400 degrees) for 13 minutes. Perfect! Served this with brown rice tossed with line juice and cilantro along with sliced cucumbers on the side. Lovely summer meal!

I did not make any changes and loved the salsa. I saute the talapia with Old Bay seasoning.  I used this salsa on Mahi as well. There is another similar recipe on this site but I like this one so much I didn't see the point in trying the other!

Served this tonight along with Lemon Basmatic Rice also on the AR site and we enjoyed a really really nice light dinner. I was a bit skeptical about the filets in the foil packets but it worked out perfectly with no mess or fuss.  I too added the avocado because I had one on hand that needed to be used up and the cilantro because mango and cilantro are meant to go together. I will be doing these again often. I highly doubt this dish has 29.7 grams a fat as listed. Something must be wrong with the calculations.

This was very good and very simple.  I didn't have the jalapeno or the red onion and it was still awesome!  I also baked instead of grilling because I ran out of propane.  Delish!

It was ok, but the maranade for the tilapia tasted like something I would put on chicken, so it through me off. The rest of my family loved it.

I used canned mango instead of fresh and it turned out great.  I loved the mango salsa.  The salsa went perfectly with the tilapia and also I used cilantro instead of parsley in the salsa.  I will be making the salsa again

PERFECT!   Even the kids who don't care for fish loved it!
