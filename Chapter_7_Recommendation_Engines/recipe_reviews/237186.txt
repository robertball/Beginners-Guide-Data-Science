This was a very tasty panini!  Next time I  may add a bit more tomato sauce as I enjoyed dipping it on the side.  I  do not have a panini maker so I  used a griddle and smashed it down with a cast iron skillet.  It worked perfectly. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I made it without olives and it was excellent. I can imagine olive will only improve the flavor.
I liked the crunch of the crust better than many pizza crust.
