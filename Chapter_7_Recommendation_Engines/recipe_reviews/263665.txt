I love this! I used about 3/4 cup extra bread, and only 1/2 cup of raisins (no almonds). I reduced the vanilla to 1 tsp, and baked for about an hour instead of just 30 minutes. Next time, I think I'll use a little less soymilk, because it's a bit wetter than the bread puddings I've had before, but I would consider what I ended up with to be a big success. Thanks!

I did not add the raisins or the almond to mine because we just do not like either in our bread pudding. However, I do not think that would have changed my rating if I had. The amount of liquid left after the suggested time period made it more of a soup than a pudding. This is not how I think of bread pudding. 

To make it 5-stars, I actually did the following: No raisins or almonds. I cooked it until the liquid was almost gone which was at least an hour. This made it quite scrumptious! It also was Whole Food Plant Based compliant this way (or the original way). We may try it with apple or peach slices/pieces in it next time because it made such a great base. It was great on its own though. We will definitely cook it again with the changes I did!
