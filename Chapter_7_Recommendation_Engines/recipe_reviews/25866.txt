O.K. I changed it a little bit: I stirred together about 2 Tbsp dijon mustard, 2 Tbsp brown sugar, 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 1 Tbsp lemon juice, and a pinch of onion powder. I used this sauce to spoon over the salmon rather than just the plain dijon mustard.   I also used non-fat butter spray rather than butter.  It came out fabulous!  The tender salmon and flaky phyllo dough made for a delectable dish.  Yummm!

A wonderful dinner party main dish that is simple to prepare.  The result is quite elegant and delicious. Have the phyllo dough thawed but still cold and keep it moist with a paper towel while you are preparing each roll.  Great with roasted asparagus and a salad of field greens.

This is by FAR the best salmon I've ever eaten! (better than grilled, in my humble opinion) The fish is actually steamed inside the phyllo.  It comes out flaky and moist, done to perfection.  The compliment of the crispy, crunchy phyllo is a delight!  I went a bit light on the mustard, and found it to be a wonderful compliment, but not overpowering.  I also used fresh ground pepper, it is a MUCH better alternative to the already ground you buy at the store.

The preparation was easy (and I had never used phyllo) and every bite was gone by end of the meal.  raves from everyone!!  Hope you will try it.

I started making the recipe salmon in puff pastry, and then realized I got phyllo dough by mistake. I searched and found this recipe, and combined the two! I put a layer of spinach longways across the middle of a stack of 8 or so sheets, then laid a whole salmon filet on top of it. I sprinkled the salmon with garlic powder and dill, then topped it with some dijon mustard mixed with a little sour cream. I closed the dough over the salmon, and brushed the top with butter. I then cooked it as directed. It was amazing!

My version has 3 layers inside the wrap. First a layer of cooked minute rice, then a layer of cooked well drained spinach and finally the salmon. Adds texture, color and taste.

Excellent!  I'm not a huge fan of dijon, but it tastes great like this!  So easy, too!  You can make them ahead of time, freeze them, and just pop them in the oven.  It was a huge hit with my husband, who is a seafood lover.

This recipe is a great idea, but a lot of work. Salmon and phyllo is a great combination. I did make some changes, without which I don't think we would have enjoyed it as much. To the dijon mustard, I added 1 Tbsp. melted butter and 2 Tbsp. honey. The sweeter sauce went so well with the phyllo AND the salmon. I highly recommend trying this variation. Also, be sure to use a rimmed cookie sheet, because the dijon sauce leaked out of some of the wraps and dripped in my oven!

I added soy sauce and fresh lemon to the mustard for each salmon steak.  My family loved this including 2 toddlers.

I'm sorry I have never given a review this low....but it was awful.  The salmon with the phyllo was not good.  The dijon was too overpowering and the phyllo just didn't fit with the other ingredients with this.  I was very disappointed that I spent my money and wasted some very good ingredients.  Sorry that it didn't suit us, but thanks for the post anyway.

The flavor of this recipe was wonderful, a refreshing change from the same old salmon recipe.  A word of caution though when working with phyllo dough, be very patient.  In the end it is all worth while, the flavor is not to be beat.

This was a nice recipe.Simple and pretty easy(if you're used to working with filo).My kids even liked it.Next time I will experiment with adding some herbs between the filo layers and maybe a more exciting sauce for a change.It was good as is though.

I've made this recipe before in appetizer size (using roughly a 1.5" sq piece of salmon in each mini croquette). Same instructions, just bake for a shorter period of time. They make awesome little bite-sized snacks, and disappear very quickly at parties!

This was very good.  I thought I had filo dough in the freezer, but it turned out I had puff pastry sheets.  I went ahead and used them, but I think the filo dough would make it even better.

Could I give it more stars? The salmon in phyllo is absolutely divine and was super easy to make. I was looking for a way to use up left over phyllo and came upon this recipe, now I'll be buying phyllo just so I can make this. Just perfect! Thanks Heidi.

This recipe was pretty good, but I can't say that I'll be making it again. PROS: I tried SPIDEYGIRL's sauce, and the salmon defintely did not taste "fishy" at all. Also, as others have said, the crunchy phyllo is a nice compliment to the flaky salmon. CONS: I've worked with phyllo several times before, but this recipe felt too time consuming in relation to the end product, which was good, but not really great enough to make again. My biggest complaint is that even though the salmon didn't taste fishy, it didn't really have a lot of flavor at all. It was like the marinade absorbed all the fishy flavor but didn't really add anything else. I think that I will stick to my old favorite recipes for salmon, but this one was fine to try for a little change from the norm.

We love this one.  However, I use more like 4 sheets of phyllo for one salmon filet (we like the crunch) and honey mustard instead of the dijon.

I fully anticipated this recipe to be excellent, in part due to previous reviews and secondly because I love salmon - but I was very disappointed. It was definitely nothing special in taste and I had even added a bit of dill in each wrapper. I find salmon on the grill far superior to this and much easier!

I almost gave up on this recipe before tasting it because working with phyllo dough is frustrating!  Just one bite changed my mind completely.  Took advice from others and mixed mustard (1/2 brown, 1/2 yellow) with a little soy sauce, dried dill, and a splash of white wine.  Would definitely recommend preparing this dish ahead of time (to minimize phyllo-frustration) and serve it for a dinner party!  BTW, if the phyllo sheet breaks  just paste sheets together with butter.  Worked perfectly for me!

This recipe was incredibly easy to make and the salmon was quite possibly the best I have ever had! I am not the world's biggest fan of salmon but this made it taste wonderful, and not fishy at all.

Easier to make than it sounds at first. A unique twist on fish that is great for dinner or serving friends. You can use less melted butter than it calls for.

I made this recipe with some alterations. I took 8ozs of frozen sweet peas, 1/2 of an onion cut into cubed-size pieces, 1 tablespoon of garlic powder, 1/4 block of low fat cream cheese, some worchestire sauce, 1/2 tea spoon sea salt, 2 big tablespoons of jalapeno peppers from the jar. I cut the jalapeno peppers it in small pieces and I let all the ingredients that I mentioned simmer for 15 mins., until the peas became tender. I then added 2 cans of canned salmon, and 2 big cans of mushrooms. I drained the mushrooms and I got all the excess water out of them, then I cut the mushrooms into tiny pieces and I mixed everything together in a big bowl.  I also used olive oil instead of the melted butter. I tried using the melted butter, but for some reason it did not work for me, from the very start, so I switched. and the olive oil give it a nice taste.  I baked the wraps at 350 degrees instead of 375 degrees, for 30 mins.  This is an awesome recipe. Thank you very much Heidi.

This did not work out for me.The phyllo dough was super soggy on the bottom.  And be careful not to add too much dijon, as it was over powering.  I might try to make this again, I have not worked much with Phyllo dough, it is very time consuming.

Excellent recipe! I would definatly disagree that the recipe is missing something in the flavoring. 
Variations: I used Plochman's Premium Mustard (Natural Stone Ground), and marinated the fish in worcestershire sauce before hand.  I also served it with Dijon Mashed Potatoes recipe by AnastasiaBMom using the same mustard.

I had experienced something like this at a dinner party some time ago.  That was excellent.  However, I was slightly disappointed by the lack of flavor with this recipe.  Next time I make it, I will adjust ingredients...add some fresh herbs, maybe even a mix a little cream with the mustard.  It was just missing something.  Definately worth working with, though.  The recipe has possiblities.

This went over very well! I used both salmon and tuna steak. I marinated the fish for several hours in soy, lime juice, garlic, worcestershire and rice vinegar. I cut the fish in strips about an inch or more thick.  I put a strip of honey mustard on the fish (I thought it could use more but my guests thought it was perfect). I didn't find the phyllo dough as challenging as I thought it would be but.  I cut the sheets in about a 5"x5" square so the fish was wrapped multiple times.  For the tuna, I would recommend cooking at 400 - it was a little dry so cooking a little faster may have helped.

Almost every review, good or bad, focuses on the phyllo.  Instead of using store-bought phyllo, try making a puff pastry, like the simple, straight-forward recipe submitted by "your mom."  Most store-bought phyllo and puff pastry are made with cheap fats like palm oil or margarine, instead of butter.  Butter makes all the difference in the world for taste and texture, and those elements are what this salmon recipe's wrap is all about...

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  It was easy, and it has phyllo dough!  Very continental.  I reduced the amount of mustard as my husband felt it was overwhelming (had to agree) and we've also used tuna or swordfish since he's not a big salmon fan.  Wanted to add that it works beautifully with similar portions of chicken.  My father-in-law is not a fish-eater, so when I make this now, I do half with chicken and half with salmon, and cook them all together.  A keeper!

Very tasty! Instead of straight dijon, i used honey dijon with dill and lemon juice (as recommended by some), and it was amazing. Definitely will be making this again.

I figured this was worth a try with all the positive reviews.  For me it was disappointing.  While the presentation was nice it lacked flavour.  The recipe could probably be tinkered with and be okay but not for this cook.  It was not a good use of my salmon.

I make this quite often. It's especially good for a "company" dinner. I have made it in bite-sized portions for a cocktail party. It was a real hit!

I really liked this recipe and made it exactly as stated the first time.  The second time, I used puff pastry dough and it came out great - without having to mess with phyllo dough (which I hate).  I combined this recipe with the Goat Cheese Recipe from the site, stuffed the fillets with garlic and herb feta cheese before wrapping them.  Wonderful recipe, and fun to experiment with using different seasonings and spices.  Thanks!

This was excellent. I followed the suggestion of making the sauce out of 2 Tbsp dijon mustard, 2 Tbsp brown sugar, 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 1 Tbsp lemon juice, and a pinch of onion powder, which was far better than plain dijon would have been. Otherwise, it was delicious and will make again and again.

This recipe came out delish and was real easy! I did some w/ the spicy mustard and some w/ pesto and I actually liked the spicy mustard ones best. I just knew the pesto would be better, they were both very good! My 4-year old loved it too!

This is DELICIOUS!  Even my husband, who is not a big fish fan, loved it.  I made it just as written.  I did leave mustard out of two of the packets, but only because I was focusing so much on working with the phyllo dough that I forgot it. :)  I will definitely be making these again!

This was very good and easy to prepare.  It does take some prep time, and it helps to have the skin removed from the salmon and cut to shape before melting the butter.  I'll make it again and may try the version with the rice and spinach that was provided by another reviewer.

I love this and have made it twice now already trying various fillings and seasonings inside the phyllo.   You can really experiment and have fun with it.   My only caution is that you should only make what you're going to eat that meal.   It does NOT reheat well the next day.  The phyllo is a soggy messy after an overnight in the fridge.  My other side note is that 1 sheet of phyllo is not nearly enough.   I used 4 sheets per fillet and it had more of a crispy skin around the fish.

I'd never used phyllo dough before, didn't realize I'd have to wait for it to defrost before I could make this lovely dish. And it's very fragile to work with! But when you get the hang of it, it's worth it. I've been raving to everyone about this dish and can't wait to share it. It's very quick, I can make it off the top of my head after the first time. I season my fish with pepper and garlic salt.

These are great! I made a few just as the recipe said, then I sprinkled a little dill on others.  Both were fantastic but the dill ones were even better.

I made this last night.  It was my first time ever making fresh salmon (my husband and son did a charter fishing trip and this is what they caught).  The only change I made was using honey mustard (personal preference) and I sprinkled it with dill before wrapping.  It was amazing!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Great idea, I used butter flavor cooking spray to coat the phyllo instead.   Really liked how the salmon came out.

This is my favorite recipe for salmon. The only variation I've sometimes use is to add cooked/sauteed mushrooms on top of the salmon and then cook. It's also delicious!

This was one of the best recipes on the site.  After a little practice working with the phyllo dough is not difficult.  The salmon comes out poached and moist.  My husband who does not like salmon loved this recipe as well as our picky friend.

Very easy recipe to prepare...however, it is defintely missing something...needs more flavor. Next time will try adding some honey to the mustard as another person suggested.

This is super easy to make.  You can use your favorite type/style mustard.  Half cup butter though is WAY too much!  I can't imagine what you do with all that!  I used 3 tablespoons and had some left over.  To be fair, I used 4--4oz filets, whole, so maybe that's part of it.  Worked great.

So good. I have made this on multiple occasions. Thinking of adding asparagus or spinach to the wrap before cooking for something different.

I loved this recipe!!!  I added garlic to the bold & spicy mustard, (we're all about tons of flavour in our home!) & green onion on top of the salmon before wrapping.  The flavour was fantastic & it was quite filling.  We had it with a salad & were quite satisfied!  I will definitely be making this time & time again!!!

This was really good and quick to make - I added some chopped spinach on top of each piece of salmon to give it some color.  Hubby and my daughter enjoyed it.  Beautiful presentation, too!  The leftovers are also good but lack the crunch of the initial bake.

I've been making this almost every week for myself.  I go to the Farmers Market every Saturday and get my salmon and make at least 3 of them for the week.  I never used Phyllo dough before and it was so simple even the first time, I just can't get over it.  THANK YOU HEIDI S.!!!  :-)

i can't imagine how this would have tasted if i had not followed advice to kick up the dijon. even then, i didn't care for this at all. the fish was dry and the dough still gooey. the flavors just didn't go well together at all -- and i really love salmon and cook with it often. i threw most of it away. sorry, i really wanted to like this.

Good base recipie. Instead of plain dijon mustard I used a mustard dill sauce from a cookbook of ours. You could change it around with any sauce that compliments fish. It was a great way to use up the extra phyllo dough I had in my freezer.

Very yummy and very easy, if you aren't worried about getting the phyllo dough perfect.  Husband kept saying, Wow!, and I'm impressed!   As another reviewer suggested, I added soy sauce, lemon juice and some brown sugar for the sauce.  Baked for 25 minutes instead of 20 in order to get the gold color I wanted on the phyllo, but my oven may be a little off.  First time I've used phyllo dough!

Let me make something perfectly clear. I HATE FISH. This salmon, however, was absolutely lovely, and I will be making it again. Thank you for coming up with a recipe I can enjoy with my husband, who loves fish.

This was easy and fantastic. Finding the phyllo was a challenging experience since this was my first time cooking with it, but that was the hardest part. Will definitely do this again!

I liked it...I kind of over cooked the phyllo (reading other reviews, trying to make sure the salmon was done) but will try this again.  I cooked it a little longer than what was listed on the recipe but the salmon was very flavorful and good. First time I've ever cooked fish so I was clueless when purchasing it.  It was kind of challenging to remove the skin from the salmon.  Instead of using butter, I just sprayed everything down with butter cooking spray. Don't really like mustard so just used salt and pepper and I like the flavor.

I made this for company last night.  It was my first time working with phyllo dough and it was much easier than I had anticipated.  I used a "sweet mango" mustard in place of the Dijon.  It was out of this world!

What did I do wrong? I followed the directions to the T and these things took WAYYYYY longer to cook than 20 minutes, meaning they pretty much never cooked all the way through. It seemed like a LOT of dough I used two sheets for each piece of salmon but maybe the sheets were thicker than others? Sheesh I don't know this was frustrating.

Okay, this was just splendid. After I got the hang of wrapping the salmon with phyllo it was easy and turned out just wonderful.  This is a very nice recipe that can be prepared ahead of time and popped in the oven when guests arrive.  Thanks!

I took the advice of someone else and used 4 sheets on each salmon instead of 2. It made working with the dough MUCH easier! I personally didn't care for the recipe, i didn't like the two textures together, and the phyllo dough doesn't really have a flavor, but it did use it up out of my freezer.

We have salmon at our house about 2 to 3 times a week.  This recipe was very highly rates, and I thought it would be a good one to try.  Alas, it was very disappointing.  The taste for us was nothing particularly special, compared to pan frying salmon using our own various seasonings/marinatings.  I'm giving it 3 stars because it was easy to make and it did turn out ok.  But just not to our satisfaction.  Sorry.

This was a big hit and a nice alternative to the "fish" dinner, and we do eat a lot of fish. I used 3 layers of dough moistened with melted butter and put a basil pesto on the salmon bc I forgot to buy the Dijon. I can imagine any favorite topping on salmon would do well here. Thank you for the inspiration!

Defintely a keeper! I don't why people think phyllo is difficult to work with. I love working with it. The secret: use plenty of melted butter! In this recipe, use skinless fillets, if you don't like Dijon, use a different mustard! I like Dijon and that is what I used. Butter each sheet of phyllo after it is laid down with a brush. Then lay down the next sheet. Put the salmon on it at an end, salt and pepper to taste: I like cracked pepper. Then rolled the phyllo with the salmon over. brush butter on the ends, and fold over the salmon. Brush butter on the remaining phyllo and roll the salmon to the end! Place in oven. How much easier does it get than that? The outcome is fantastic! My wife think a sauce could go with it, perhaps a herbed cream sauce or maybe butter with browned almons.

I must say I didn't follow directions..I marinated 1 piece of salmon in lemon pepper marinade for about 1 hour.. Steamed  broccoli (salted), made mash potatoes & set both aside..I melted tsp unsalted butter mixed in tsp extra virgin olive oil.. I mixed in tsp basil, tbsp fresh parm cheese, tsp minced garlic, tsp lemon pepper season & tbsp fresh lemon juice.. Took 3-4 sheets of dough &  place salmon on 1 side..Layered salmon with butter mixture, broccoli & mash then followed with steps 4 & 5... Will make again ;-}

I think Dijon can be a bit strong, so I just put enough on to thinly cover the salmon before wrapping it. We loved it! And...the leftovers heated up well too.

Simple, easy and fast.  Delicious, tucked some fresh asparagus tips in with the fish, they were al dente when finished. Squished fresh lemon over when done. Served with some brown rice and steamed sugar snap peas.  Instead of butter, I used spray coconut oil, healthier option as am fighting high cholesterol...delicious! You could easily serve this to guests and they'd be super impressed!

After reading other reviews, I added thawed chopped spinach under a salmon filet and mixed honey dijon with mayo, lemon juice and some dill (I never measure so I can't tell you how much).  I also used four sheets of phyllo.  I only had to bake the salmon for about 18 minutes otherwise the salmon gets overdone.  Will keep this recipe and definitely use again.

Quite delicious and easy. This provides an alternative twist to the simple, standard baked/broiled salmon seasoned with only salt and pepper. The only tricky part is keeping the phyllo from drying.

Actually, I used SPIDEYGIRL's mix and marinated the fish in it for about 20 mins.  Turned out yummy that even my 1-yr-old and picky 3-yr-old gobbled it up.

This was tasty, although I have had better salmon recipes from this site. I added a bit of honey to the mustard to give a little sweet flavor.
