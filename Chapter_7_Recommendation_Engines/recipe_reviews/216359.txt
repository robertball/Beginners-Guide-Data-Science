These were so easy and are really good. Don't let sit on the cookie sheet too long as the bottoms will get dark. Tried with milky way candies as well for those allergic to nuts.

I thought these cookies were quite easy and fun!  They were very tasty and I did let them just start to get a hint browned on the top.  This was a quick recipe to make.

i though this recipe was OK. I would suggest using any kind of candy bar but the Snickers made it better.   also for the whole cookie i would say have 2:3 of the cookie be of candy.  if not it just is'nt as good and the ends get thrown out.

We halved the recipe then made as directed.  These were a lot of work but tasted great.

These were a huge hit in the office, and so easy to make!  They will definitely be on the cookie rotation next year as well.

I wasn't overly impressed with these cookies.  I think the cake mix flavor was too much for me.

Very sweet and a really good cookie. I made just one box, because I was intimidated about the cookie melting all over the place, but it didn't. When it cooled a little the cookie cracked and caramel oozed out, but that made it look scrumptious!

I made these using left over Halloween candy ! They came out great . first of all I used devils food cake mix Because that’s what I had on hand and  I did cut up the snickers and used fun size packs of m&m’s too. I mixed them right into the batter and then rolled my 1 inch balls and lightly rolled them in flour before baking to absorb up anything super gooey so it wouldn’t leak  and would hopefully crust up the edge . They did come out amazing. Definitely a keeper .

This worked out great as a simple way to turn extra Halloween candy into Christmas cookies.  We tried both vanilla and chocolate cake mix.  I actually preferred the chocolate or mixing the two together.

I was skeptical about the cake mix, but they turned out great.  I cut the candy bars in half, which made a more typical cookie size, but then ran out of dough. I discovered too late that I didn't have parchment paper (or wax paper), but if you spray the cookie sheets with non-stick cooking spray, they won't stick.  Save some money; parchment paper is expensive! Also, don't worry too much about the chocolate leaking; it still tastes good.

I had fun sized Mint Milky Ways (devil's food cake mix) and Snickers (yellow cake mix) so I cut them in half to make them mini sized.  I only got 20 cookies per batch but they turned out great....and the Halloween candy is all gone:)  So glad I didn't get Twizzlers!

Brilliant!  Just what I was looking for to get rid of the candy without having to throw it away!
