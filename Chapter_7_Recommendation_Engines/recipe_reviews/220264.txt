This was the AR Recipe Group Selection for the week of April 13, 2013.  I made my own homemade crust and used four individual Calphalon mini pizza pans. I used the ingredients listed but altered the directions somewhat.  I combined the steps of browning the mushrooms, garlic and asparagus for 8 minutes - removed from pan and set aside in a bowl and then fried the bacon in the same pan - why dirty another pan? All of the flavors blended well together and we especially enjoyed the appearance and crunchiness of the asparagus. This is a recipe in which the ingredients could be added or taken from to satisfy indiviudal taste. Thanks for sharing your recipe here on Allrecipes smerki!

Any pizza topping you like can be worked into this yummy flatbread recipe. I like this one because I bought the flatbread base from the store (rather than making it from scratch) and needed something to tell me how to prepare it.

Recipe Group Selection:  13, April 2013 ~ This is a winner!  The grocery only had a 2-pack of small flatbreads, so that is what I used.  I did change up the cooking method, somewhat.  I fried the bacon first and then removed most of the grease.  I removed the bacon, and then added onions and red bell pepper in place of the mushrooms (don’t care for them), garlic, s/p and the asparagus.  I just sautéed all of it until the asparagus was tender with brown spots.  I then assembled in the order listed, baked at 400° for 14 minutes.  The results were delicious and I think this would be a delicious recipe to try on the grill this summer.

Made for Recipe Group. I used a store bought tube of thin pizza crust. Unrolled, cut in 4 sections. Instant flatbread! Mushrooms only on half since I detest them. I just estimated how much I wanted to add for ingredients and probably used more than called for. Tasty and quick! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for the weekly recipe group selection. I just cooked the mushrooms and asparagus in the same pan. I also had a half sweet onion in the fridge so sliced it up and threw it in there also. I just crumbled two leftover breakfast bacon on the pizza, but really wasn't needed, the veggies were just fine. I used a store bought flat bread crust. Was a quick and easy weeknight meal, we enjoyed it.

Recipe Group week of April 13. The selection of cheese was wonderful. I changed the bacon to sweet italian sausage and I did use canned asparagus. No complaints and the garlic was yummy. Is this anything more special than any other pizza recipe-not really.

I followed the recipe and this flatbread pizza is delicious!!!  I think the asiago cheese gives it the outstanding flavor.  As good or better than a flatbread at a restaurant.  I made it again a day or two later and used broccoli and it was just as good.  Cooking the bacon as cut-up pieces made it more crisp than using long pieces and crumbling them.

This was a huge hit! I had a store-bought flatbread and needed a recipe on how to make it, and this worked great. The recipe for the toppings was (and can be) altered however you like; I used one green pepper, veggie ham, assorted mushrooms, shredded mozzarella cheese, and a homemade tomato sauce (tomato paste, basil, & salt). Baked for 11 minutes and it was perfect! Thanks!

Made this for recipe group last night and we enjoyed it. The bacon doesn't really do it for me but I enjoyed the asparagus (even though that was my original concern). We used the grill and also used it to bake the homemade flatbread. Due to the size, I had to use a combo of direct and indirect heat, turning it a few times. Worked well and we tried some other toppings on half of this. The asparagus and mushrooms went well with some sliced mini peppers (sauteed with the mushrooms) and sun dried tomatoes. Even with a salad to go with this we only got 4 dinner servings.
