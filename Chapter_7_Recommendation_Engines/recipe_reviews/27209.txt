I tweaked this recipe a bit:
I used two packages of cream cheese, a full 13 oz. jar of Nutella, no sugar, one egg, and a tsp. of vanilla. I also used a frozen pie crust (the kind you roll out yourself.) 
First I greased a pie pan with unsalted butter, then rolled the pie crust out over it, and used about 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts and 1/2 ghiradelli dark chocolate pieces to sprinkle a thin, single layer on the bottom of the crust. Then I baked at 350 for 7-8 mins. Then I mixed all the remaining ingredients and filled the pie pan + baked for an additional 30 mins. I chilled it overnight (about 8-9 hours) and the end result was absolutely divine. I am a cheesecake FANATIC, and in all honesty, this was the BEST cheesecake I've ever had. The Nutella taste was very evident, but the walnuts + hint of chocolate at the bottom added a turtle flavor to it. I opted for a regular pie crust instead so not to take away from the Nutella flavor. If you plan on making this, whichever way you choose, DO NOT USE SUGAR, and you MUST let it chill for at least 8 hours. It only gets better and better the longer it sits in the refrigerator. Nobody at my Christmas dinner table could keep their hands off of it.

I have to say I didnt make this as per recipe. I used 2 creamed cheese, 1 jar of nutella,1 tsp vanilla,and 1 egg. I put this in a pre made chocolate crust and baked it at 350 for 30 minutes. Put in fridge for 7 hours. Before serving I topped it off with whipped cream and chopped hazelnuts. It was supurb. My guests loved it.I will make it this way again.

I have made this recipe several times, using less sugar each time. I found that it is best with NO sugar, especially if you love Nutella, which I do.

Very yummy but very decadent!  I made a few alterations because I didn't like the idea of using a graham cracker crust so instead a friend suggested making a brownie crust which turned out to be a great idea.  

I make my brownies from scratch using the Deep Dish Brownies recipe on this site.  I cut the recipe by half and added about half a 7 oz jar of Nutella to the batter for taste.  Spread the brownie batter out in a pie pan and then baked the brownies for 7-10 minutes or until the sides were cooked.  Then I cut the recipe for the cheesecake a little by using only 10 oz of cream cheese (half reg/half light) and 1/2 cup of sugar and an egg.  Then I added the remaining Nutella into the mix, poured it unto the brownie crust and baked for 25 minutes.  I cooled it in the fridge for about 8 hours and the result was a dessert that was literally gone in 20 minutes!  It was a huge hit at the Christmas party I took it to and I had everyone asking for the recipe and blaming me for the Christmas weight they were going to put on!

A great suggestion for this recipe:  cut the amount of sugar in half, then mix all ingredients well.  At the end, fold in 1/2 - 3/4 container of whipped topping.  Set overnight.  The cake has a lighter density and makes the Nutella flavor stand out more.

This was very good.  I was in the mood for cheesecake, so I made this with 3 8oz blocks of cream cheese and then kept adding nutella to taste (I think I added about 13 oz).  I didn't add sugar, but I did add an egg. And I baked this for 30 minutes at 350, the baking definitely made the texture more cheesecake like. It tasted great!

This is definitely rich but DON'T let that put you off!! Everyone we served this to loved it. This cheesecake was so easy and fairly inexpensive. I make a lattice top with melted chocolate chips and a pastry bag to make it prettier and kept it in the freezer by my husband's request. He said he preferred it that way.

Once again, I am disappointed with a dessert from this site. This was a gooey mess. It tasted just like the recipe sounds. Nothing special. It may be ok for a spread on fruit or bread, but it was awful in a pie crust. It wouldn't cut and you had to end up spooning it out and forcing it off the spoon. I know desserts are supposed to be sweet and I love them, but this was REALLY sweet and I cut down on sugar. I will keep looking

I gave this recipe a 5 because it lead to me to a masterpiece!  Instead of using a graham cracker pie crust I made a Nilla Wafer pie crust (you can also buy the prepared ones from teh grocery store).  To make the pie crust just crush about 34 Nilla Wafers, add 1 tablespoon white sugar, and 1/2 stick unsalted butter and press into a 9 inch pie dish.  Set aside.  Then mix 2 packages softened cream cheese, 1 13 ounce jar nutella, 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract and one egg.  Don't really need sugar, it's pretty sweet.  Mix all those ingredients and spread over pie crust.  Bake at 350 for 30 minutes.  Let it cool for 10 minutes then put in the refrigerator for 7-8 hours, the longer the better.  Garnish right before serving with fresh bananas and strawberries, or toasted hazelnuts, or whipped cream.. or a  mixture of them all! :-)  This got rave reviews!  Thanks Laurabeatty for the wonderful idea.

I gave this 3 stars cause it was way too sweet.  All that sugar overpowers the cheese and nutella.  But I'll give this a 5 star the way I made it the second time.  I used 2 blocks of cream cheese, 2 eggs, 1 tsp of vanilla, and 1 jar of nutella.(dont not add extra sugar) I baked this at 350 for 30-45mins. in a 8 inch spring form pan. For the crust i used chocolate cookie crumbles(eyeballed it), 1 egg white, and 2 tablespoons butter and baked the crust at 350 for 8 mins. Let the cake chill for atleast a full day or more. The longer it sits the better it gets. This worked out very well and everyone loved it. I think it could used more hazelnut flavor. I'd suggest maybe adding chopped toasted hazelnuts. Anyways, if you want a real cheesecake then turn this into a baked cheese cake.

We loved this.  Our guests olove this.  I can't understand how some reviewers had trouble with it setting up unless they used SOUR cream instead of cream CHEESE?  Making  it again today - it's a great RV recipe as it requires no cooking or baking.  [I did use an Oreo crust in place of the graham cracker crust and I did reduce the sugar as others suggested.]

I have to say hands down...AWESOME! I had Neufchantel Cheese on hand and followed the recipes to a T. I didn't find it overly sweet as others did, just rich. The texture was smooth, thick & creamy, no problems pulling out of the pan like other pies I have done in the past. It totally held up very well. But as far as the pie goes. It's wonderful! And is going on my list of pies for Thanksgiving. My husband begged me to make sure I had it on the dessert table! ;-) TY Laura, this is devine!

We are fans of Nutella, and of both styles of cheesecake (baked & not). This was neither. I followed the recipe with the changes recommended - egg, baked, no sugar. The sweetness level was about right...but it was the only thing right about the dish.   The dessert itself was very smooth, dense & heavy reminiscent of the original cream cheese bar it came from. It did not taste anything like a cheesecake - either style.   The normally wonderful taste of Nutella was reduced to an ambiguous bleh.   I was looking for a recipe for a special baked dish to take to an upcoming event..this was not it.

This is great!I followed the recipe exactly the first time, & the next time I used reduced fat cream cheese. They tasted the same, but the one with reduced fat did not "set up" as well. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I had never tried Nutella but the little Italian girl on the food channel kept talking about how good it was so I bought some and found this recipe here.  I am a chocolate pie lover and THIS IS THE BEST.  I did cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup and it was plenty.  I also used a regular baked pie crust rather than graham cracker because that sounded too sweet.  I whipped it until it was as light as I thought I could get it in my big Kitchenaid mixer and it was perfect!  Like a need a great chocolate pie recipe (apply to hips!)

Absolutely Terrific!
I followed other people's suggestions and didn't add any sugar and it was just fine without it. 
I also made a crust out of crushed hazelnuts,4 tsp of butter, and two tbsp of brown sugar. Baked the crust by itself at 375 for 10 minutes. Then poured in the Nutella mixture, and baked it for another 30 at 375. Let it sit in the fridge overnight and topped it off with banana slices for breakfast the next day. UNBELIEVABLE! That night I had a group of friends over and everyone loved it! I am planning to make it for my mom when she comes to visit!

Although a lot of the other reviews have said that this was very rich, I followed the recipe exactly and could have liked a bit more Nutella flavor! I will try it again with more next time. And the name of cheesecake is rather misleading, this is more of a Nutella cream cheese pie than a cheesecake. But anything with Nutella and cream cheese has to be good, and this definitely was!

This recipe was just what I was looking for: a sugary, rich, creamy dessert for my chocolate-loving friend's birthday. I used half the sugar suggested and used icing sugar instead of white. I made the crust by crushing digestives and adding a tsp of Dutch cocoa and a tablespoon of melted butter, mixing it up and pressing it down in the baking pan, then putting it in the freezer for about 30 minutes. I then added the creamy filling in several layers which I separated with layers of chopped Ferrero Rocher candies. Topped the cake with toasted hazelnuts and three Ferrero Rochers and voilà! I didn't actually try the cake myself, because just thinking about those calories made me feel a bit weak ;) but the reviews I got were fabulous .

I made this mostly as directed--I left out the sugar completely--as well as with the reviewer's suggestions of adding an egg and baking.  I only made a small portion of the original recipe, putting the mixture in two mini graham cracker crust pans and then adding the egg in and making a full pie of the rest.  The recipe as directed IS more of a mousse--it still firms up after refrigeration, and is very rich, but by adding an egg and baking, you get a much more cheesecake like texture and a firmer, richer taste.  I'm glad I left out the sugar, and glad I tried it both ways.  Bf was more partial to the adjusted recipe, although he gobbled up the original as well.   Either way, I thought the graham cracker crust was a good call, and it definitely does not need extra sugar.  It's sweet enough as is.  It's a bit rich for me, but it has a nice, chocolately taste.  It doesn't really taste as much like a nutella cheesecake to me as a more chocolatey cheesecake.  Thanks for the recipe!

Follow suggestions in the reviews to omit sugar, add an egg, and bake 30 min.  I also added some Hazelnut Liqueur syrup which added some extra flavor without the excessive sweetness.

Deadly for us Nutella fans! I also omitted all the sugar. I opted for no-bake with 8 oz cream cheese and 8 oz of Cool Whip, and I went with the half recipe of deep dish brownies for the crust. Topped with toasted chopped hazelnuts and drizzled melted choc chips. MmmmMMMmmm.

Turned out great! I did as others said and added an egg and didn't add sugar. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes, then refrigerated overnight. Perfect texture and consistency - will probably make again!!

I made this for our christmas day dessert and have followed the recipe to the letter, but it did not get the full range of stars as we all (12 people) found the taste not great, neither the texture. Sorry, but will not make again!

I followed "insomniac chef" but tweeked it also. I used frozen pie crust, DID NOT grease the bottom, used 1 egg, 1 tsp of vanilla, 2 8oz packages of CC, and 2/3 cup of sugar and the recommended amount of Nutella. I did not used the chocolate in the bottom though, just the walnuts. This came out great! Not runny..you HAVE to bake it! Not baking it WILL make it runny. It's absolutely divine.

This was good, however, I added an egg and baked it as suggested by other reviewers.  Otherwise I think it would have been too runny.  I topped mine with Ferrero Rocher candies- very beautiful!  Everyone enjoyed this dessert.

Too sweet and rich.  I would add 1 cup of heavy cream to lessen the sweetness.  Still have to develop this recipe to make it perfect.

I love this recipe!!! It's super easy. I have done both the bake and no bake versions; and I have to say I prefer the bake version. I've made this about 6 times, cut down the sugar it's not necessary. Add an egg! Bake at 350 degrees for 30-45 until the center is not too jiggly anymore and viola! I also use a chocolate homemade wafer crust or if I'm lazy/tired I buy the Keebler Ready chocolate crust...yum. After baking let it cool down completely before placing in the fridge (preferably overnight) for at least 4-6 hours. Then enjoy!!!!

This was a great dessert!  If you follow the directions exactly, I would consider this more of a pie than a cheesecake.  A lot of others are adding an egg and baking to make it more like a cheesecake.  I was wanting more of a pie so I chose to make the recipe exactly as stated.  I do prefer my pies with a regular pie crust so thats the only thing I changed.  I did beat the filling well to add more air into it to help make it smooth and lighter.  It was delicious and nice and rich with the nutella!  It was perfect with a large dollop of whipped cream on top to help with how rich it is.  So good!  About two days later in the fridge it really gets even better!  Thanks for this great recipe!  I will for sure make again when Im wanting a nice rich chocolate-y pie other than the ordinary!

Added this to the Thanksgiving dessert mix to rave reviews.  I prefer a baked cheesecake so I followed the suggestions of other reviewers - adding a egg, reducing the sugar to 2 T, chocolate crust instead of a graham cracker crust,  and baking in a 350 oven.  Easy and well received!  I'll do this one again.

I have made this as written and by adding a container of frozen whipped topping and then poured into a brownie crust as suggested in the reviews - both versions are totally TO DIE FOR!  I, for one, believe there is never such a thing as too much Nutella in your life. :)

Sorry, it doesn't work. The cream cheese dilutes the Nutella so you can barely taste any chocolate flavor, let alone hazelnut.

This was ok...I think maybe a little less nutella or less sugar would have been more appropriate. It didn't necessarily taste like a cheesecake. The nutella was overwhelming and it was way too sweet for my taste. It's an awesome idea, and I will try this again with reduced sugar and less nutella.

This turned out a lot better than I expected.  With the lack of ingredients, it seemed too easy to be any good, but turned out yummy.  I'm not a Nutella fan, but since I had a whole jar lying around I thought I'd give it a try.  I followed the directions exactly.  It had a nice, firm consistency.  It is really rich and sweet!  I really don't know what the point of adding the extra sugar was, so if I make it again, I'll probably leave that part out.

Too rich and heavy for my taste. I love Nutella, but once mixed into this recipe the hazelnut flavor of the Nutella was lost. It tasted like a bad grocery store chocolate cheesecake pie. I'm thinking the Nutella might be better showcased if you melt a little and use it as a topping on a regular cheesecake.

This was yummy, but not the best. Very rich and could only be eaten in small slivers. If i make an apple pie or a different type of cheesecake, it is usually gone in the one night (big family). Whereas this one, lasted about 3 nights. The true test was that my brothers didnt go back and steal from the fridge! So when all said and done.. it was yummy, but not really something i would make again.

So simple to make and good - extremely rich.  As others have pointed out, although the recipe uses cream cheese, the title "cheesecake" is a bit misleading and this is really like a very thick, dense cream or pudding pie.  I cut back a little on the sugar and just a little on the Nutella and it was still really sweet, but addicting.  I think next time, I will take A.M.'s suggestion of cutting back a bit more on the Nutella and adding an egg.  Beat it for several mins. to get a lighter pie.  When I make French Silk pie, I beat each egg for about 5 mins., really adds to the lightness.

This was so good! For this recipe, I added an egg and no sugar. For the crust I crushed graham crackers in a food processor and mixed it with melted butter. Then baked the crust separately at 350° for 7 minutes before adding the cheescake mixture. I then also baked the cheesecake mixture and chilled it overnight. It was delicious!!

I've made this twice. It is very rich and a small piece goes a long way. It got rave reviews from my kids. I did not use the sugar since the Nutella is sweet enough without it.

I did it a bit differently and it turned out awesome.  I left out the sugar, instead of 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract I used a whole tablespoon, and I added a sploosh of irish cream.  Then I mixed it a bit, heated it for 2 minutes in the microwave (to mix it up better, and because my husband is put off by "uncooked food"), poured it in the shell, and... had some left over, so I added a bit more Nutella and cream cheese to the remainder, and splashed spiced rum in there and made a second pie.  They both taste like fancy chocolate truffles!

Yum! I used 20 ounces of Philidelphia cream cheese, kept everything else the same. Chilled for 6 hours prior to serving. It was delish! Very creamy but firm.

So good and so easy to make!  I used 1/4 sugar as suggested.  I just kept adding nutella until it tasted delicious.  I did not bake it.  It was delicious.   I put whipped cream for decoration like in the picture but I would suggest skipping that because the whipped cream got runny by the time people started eating it.  At first no one was breaking into it because of that but as soon as one person tried it and said how good it was, everyone started eating it and finished it off.

I love Nutella... I made in a chocolate cookie crust and cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and this was unbelievably decadent.  Got more than 8 servings because a little goes such a long way with this recipe.  Super!  thanks

I also didn't exactly follow the recipe. I added 1 egg and used less sugar. I also added 2 spoonfuls of peanut butter then baked it for 30 min at 350F. I took this into work and got rave reviews.

the cheesecake was very good and I made it in a jiff! only, I decided to bake first the crust (10 mins) and then the cake itself (10 minutes more). it got great reviews, and it's amazing, being so easy!

I liked this recipe . . . sort of.  I found the finished product to be too heavy.  I prefer a very light fluffy cheesecake and this was very dense.  It tasted great though and my guest loved it.  I used a chocolate crumb crust with mine instead of graham cracker.  I'd make this again but would need to lighten it up a bit.

I was a little skeptical because this was a no bake recipe but it came out really good!  I used a tofu imitation cream cheese spread b/c I am lactose intolerant and it came out almost like a pudding pie.  Everyone really liked it.

Excellent!  This did not last long in my household. I think next time I'll make it with a chocolate crust and possibly drizzle some raspberry preserves over the top.  So good!

I'm a college student and I can't believe how easy this was to make! I generally don't like Nutella so I needed to do something with the jar that I had and came across this. I took the suggestion of the other reviewers and added an egg and left out the sugar all together. I also used a "No Roll" crust recipe that I found on this site and baked it for 30 mins. WOW, it was delicious!

i made this in an 8" springform pan using a chocolate/graham cracker crust. it was wonderful, i took it to a party and when i went to get the 3 remaining pieces to take home, the host quickly came over, took the 3 pieces, cleaned the pan and handed me an empty pan back. now that is the sign of a great dessert.

This is everything the other reviewers promised: easy, quick, rich, quite good.
It was not really like a cheesecake to me either; needs a different name so it is not misleading. My children do not especially like cheesecake, so I told them it was a chocolate hazlenut pie---they loved it (go figure).

Very good, indeed, and oh so simple. Even though I'm European, I'm not that fond of nutella, but this pie tasted very good. The filling was quite hard to evenly pour in the pie shell, but I'm gonna try to mix it a little bit more next time... maybe incorporating more air in the mixture would help. Definitely rich.

I thought this was good.  Although, it didn't seem like a "cheesecake" to me-- more like a chocolate cream pie.  But, good nonetheless (especially if you like Nutella - yum!)

I omitted the sugar and did a homemade Oreo crust. We loved this. It's not very Nutella-y though, the hazelnut flavor is completely drowned by the cheesecake flavor. It's still great though. I made this with neufchatel and it held up quite firmly, don't know what the reviewer who referred to it as "gooey mess" did wrong. I even used the floppy kind of cream cheese and mine held up fine. Honestly, there's no reason for this to have only 4 stars. If it doesn't taste good to you, then you don't like the ingredients. It's simple and tasty, thank you.

Made this for church.  It was a big hit.  I took others advice and did not add sugar.  It was very sweet and didn't need it at all.  I used a chocolate graham cracker crust (I made it) and it worked very well.  Make sure your cream cheese is well softened.  Otherwise it's hard to get it really creamy.  Once I had all the ingredients together in the mixer I whipped it with the beater on a pretty fast setting to incorporate some air into it to make sure it was fluffy.  I would make it again sometime.

I recently tried Nutella for the first time and liked it so much looked for recipes with it. I like to try these recipes as close to original as I can the first time.  This recipe is easy, minimal dishes.  I only took out the sugar for health reasons.  It is good! I liked it, thank you for sharing.

The taste was ok. If I didn't make it, I wouldn't have known it was nutella. I followed the top review, and the texture was a bit off.

I have to say I have been making this recipe for a few years now.  I always get asked for the recipe.  I do follow it exactly...why mess with perfection??  Also I have seen a few people mention they add egg to the recipe? this pie is not cooked and serving raw egg to my family is not something I feel comfortable with.  Salmonella is no joke.

I'm a huge Nutella fan, so I made this for my family and it was a major hit!  My version is a bit different. I used two packages of 1/3 less fat cream cheese, 5tbsp jarred nutella + 5tbps home made nutella (all together 10tbsp approx. one jar), NO SUGAR, 1 egg, 1/4 tsp vanilla extract, and a regular pie crust.   After combining ingredients I poured them into the pie crust and baked it at 350 for 30 mins. While still hot I decorated the top with chocolate chips and raspberries. Then I chilled it overnight.   This makes for a less sweet indulgent treat.

I took the suggestions of some of the reviewers - add an egg, bake at 350 for 30 minutes, refrigerate overnight. It was good, but not great. I've had amazingly good, simple, and creative desserts with Nutella, but I can't say this was one of them.

Really enjoyed this recipe, it was easy and good.  Everyone liked it.  It is rich and I wouldn't make it frequently put probably again sometime.  Goes well with coffee.

I loved this! I followed the recipe. It probably chilled in the fridge for almost a full day before I tried any. Vey sweet and rich. I enjoyed it topped with whipped cream and a strawberry, with skim milk to drink. My husband wasn't too crazy about it - thought it was "too much" - but he doesn't particularly like Nutella or pie (he prefers cake & brownies). My 2 year old & 4 year old boys enjoyed it!

One slice of this pie makes up for half of the calories I eat in an entire day and as for fat content, I usually eat less than half of the fat grams in a day.

So obviously this pie is tastes good!

You have to try this dessert at least once.  I guarantee you will love it!  I like that it isn't too sweet and is very easy to make.  You can find Nutella in the peanut butter isle.  My daughter made this for her middle school geography class when she did a presentation on Italy.  She got yums from the students and a perfect grade from the teacher.

This is the best no bake cheesecake recipe I know!  Very rich, goes well with a big glass of milk or cup of coffee.  *Tip: The cream cheese really needs to be room temp to properly mix without any lumps.  I've tried mixing with not quite room temp cream cheese and it didn't work quite as well even with my Kitchenaid mixer!

My husband LOVED this! I bought an extra large pre-made graham cracker crust, and filled it as directed. I then whipped some cream and added just a touch of vanilla and sugar, and used this as a topping. The whipped cream topping cut the richness of the Nutella filling nicely. To finish, I drizzled some chocolate topping (I used the stuff from Tastefully Simple) in a lattice pattern on top. It looked and tasted great. We'll be making "Nutella Pie" again, that's for sure!

I have made this recipe over and over and over again. My friends can never seem to get enough, regardless of the richness :) I don’t add sugar, I add an egg and bake it for about 12 minutes or so. Refrigeration does indeed make it better. Love this recipe!

I had made a "fake" black bean nutella to try to get my picky kid with autism to eat it, but the nutella was just weird (pasty with a bean after-taste).  I didn't want to waste it, so I discovered this recipe.  SUCCESS!  My son LOVES this cheesecake made with "black bean nutella." I have made it twice in as many weeks.

I'll make it again, but not to take out to.  It should be served cold and not to set out at a church dinner (buffet) or the like.
It's pretty and easy and good.

I used a little less sugar than the recipe called for because nutella is so rich. It turned out pretty decent though didnt take long to set in the fridge and its nice and sturdy. I used hobnobs as the base instead of a pre made graham cracker crust and its delicious

Like insomniac chef, I did make a few changes, and kept the no bake aspect of the recipe. Everything still pretty much the same, but half the sugar, and roughly 3/4 of the nutella, because I want the nutella flavor and the color, but I found that  putting the whole amount overpowered the flavor of the cream cheese. I also added amount a package of unflavored gelatin that was dissolved in 1 cup of hot water in to the mixture to make sure that it doesn't get gooey and give it a guarantee that  you will always get a velvety texture.

I've made this cake with half the amount of sugar, with no sugar, and the amount of sugar as told by the recipe and it is still amazing. No sugar makes it richer but half the amount makes it perfect.

I did change this quite a bit because I made it like a baked cheesecake by beating in 3 eggs and baking it at 250 for about an hour in a spring-form pan.  I did put a graham crust in the bottom of the pan.  It was awesome.  Served it with berries and whipped cream.

I took others advise and omitted sugar and added one egg and baked at 350 for 30 minutes. Also instead of graham cracker crust (I don't like) I used 1 1/4 cups crushed pretzel, 1/4 cup diced almonds and 4 tablespoons melted butter for crust. I made individual cheesecakes with cupcake liners and muffin tins. This recipe is so rich so I liked the smaller serving.  They were the hit of the holiday party... Yummy!

Made the MASSIVE mistake of trying this with reduced fat cream cheese. Thought it would solve the "too sweet" problem other people had and cut the fat a bit. It was so bitter I tried adding additional sugar. Unfortunately the sugar wouldn't dissolve.

Around my house Nutella is an endangered species along with bananas and fresh fruit. When I saw this I knew I would have to try it out on the kids. I followed the other reviewers advice halving the amount of sugar I called for. The sugar in my opinion isn't necessary. The cheesecake is very rich and decadent. The best part of this recipe is the ease with which it can be made. If I can Nutella in the house this will be made again.

Made this for a co-worker's birthday who LOVES Nutella - it turned out great!  Was a bit nervous about not adding sugar, but I'm glad I didn't...used a homemade graham crust and sprinkled choc chips before the filling....would definitely make this again if Nutella goes on sale :)

My son (16) said this was the best food he had eaten, ever in his life.  Great dessert for days when you don't want to heat the house with the oven.  I left out the sugar and topped it with chopped hazelnuts.  Use real cream cheese (the kind in the box).  Those who complained that it doesn't set up probably used cream cheese spread or soft cream cheese from a tub.

Ok, I made this (without the sugar) with a regular pie crust and wasnt too impressed. Decided to change it up a bit the second time. 
-took pre-made refrigerated pie crust and separated into 4 mini "pies", and placed in large muffin sized pan. 
-sprinkled crushed hazelnuts and milk chocolate chips in the bottom of each cup
-made the cream cheese/nutella mixture as called for with about 1/3 of sugar listed
-added 1/2 bag of milk chocolate chips and more hazelnuts to the mixture
-added an egg
-baked muffin tin first in oven for about 8 min
-added filling, baked for additional 30 min
-after these cooled and set, removed from muffin tin and had the cutest little mini cheesecakes!
-topped with vanilla frosting and sprinkled with a few leftover chocolate chips
-guests LOVED them. :)

I have made this recipe many times and everytime people seem to adore it. Remember this is a SUPER sweet and rich cake, so if you want something light choose another one. This was also soo easy to make!!

It may not be your typical cheesecake, but it is FANTASTIC!  The only problem is that I hardly got to eat any - my husband ate the whole thing practically by himself!
