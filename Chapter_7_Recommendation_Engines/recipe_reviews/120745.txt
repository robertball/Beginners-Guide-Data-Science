I have been trying a new whole wheat recipe bread every day this week.  The differences between each recipe are slight, but it looks like our family votes this recipe as the best one from the site.  It wasn't too dense, nor did it have the bitter flavor some whole wheat bread has (I used 100% whole wheat, no bread flour).  It tastes just like something from the bakery, even if you don't take the time to make it by hand.

This bread is awesome. I used 1 3/4 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup of white flour and baked it in the oven instead of my breadmachine. Very fluffy bread, great texture. Next time I am going to try this recipe with all whole wheat flour. UPDATE: I tried all whole wheat flour and it is awesome!

I did not have dry milk powder so I subbed non fat milk for the water - kept all other ingredients the same.  I only used the dough setting - did not bake the loaf in the bread machine.  My son was here and had a sandwich made with the bread and he could not stop commenting on how good it was!

This bread turned out great for me!  I didn't have the nonfat dry milk, so I substituted buttermilk for 3/4 c. of the water.  Also, I reversed the measurements of the bread flour (I used Gold Medal Better for Bread) and whole wheat, so it only had 1 c. of the white flour.  I used the whole wheat setting, and light crust, and it was perfect! The texture was moist and elastic, just the way I like my bread.  I will be making this again!

Great hearty texture. Not too fluffy but not too heavy. This was exactly what I was looking for. We had this with a vegetarian Italian Peasant soup and it didn't fall apart when dipped into the broth. I didn't have powdered milk so I just used regular milk in the same measurement. Set the breadmaker for whole wheat, 2lbs and medium crust. Perfect, perfect, perfect!! Thanks!

Over-rose and fell. Too much yeast. Possibly the author used salted butter and counted on the salt in most quick cook oatmeals to control the rise. I didn't have those sodium sources and my bread didn't work well. Good crust, nice flavor, but the measurements need tweaking.

I use my bread machine "dough" cycle to proof this recipe with a few small changes.  I use 100% whole wheat, whole grain oats and 3 TBL vital wheat gluten.  Bake at 375 for 25 minutes.  This is my family's favorite bread!

Great bread.  My kids ate half the loaf when it came out of the bread machine!  This is now a favorite!  Makes great grilled cheese sandwiches.  Thanks :)

The only change I made is to double the honey.  It is the first homemade bread that my husband really liked! (He was too used to "air bread."  That's what I call store bought loaf bread.) Thanks for the recipe! Yummy!

Really good wheat bread.  The best recipe I've run across so far.  The oatmeal keeps it nice and moist.

This bread has fantastic flavor and texture.  Since I didn't have dry milk powder I substituted regular milk for the water in this recipe.  I made no other changes though.  The bread turned out great and I will be making this one often.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent recipe -- made exactly as listed, with medium loaf size on my bread machine. Light and fluffy and the oatmeal just sort of melted into the bread. So yummy!

This is one of the best breads I've ever had. It rose perfectly. The texture is soft and chewy, not too airy, yet not too dense. We love it. I didn't have milk powder so I replaced 1/2 of the water with milk.

Very good. It came out perfect. Made the dough in the bread machine and let it proof in the oven and baked it at 350. Even the finicky boyfriend loves it!

this was very good and a must remake - 
i used 1 teaspoon salt, 2-3/4 cups unbleached all purpose white flour, 1 cup w.wheat flour, 1-1/4 cups 2% milk instead of the water and milk powder -
i used the dough method on the machine and baked it in the oven. It turned out so well.

Easy and yummy. I switched the whole wheat and white flour amounts and subbed brown sugar for honey (not a honey fan). The the last time I made it I used applesauce instead of butter - turned out great!

I've made this twice now. Fantastic recipe! I think this will become one of my favourites, as we use it for sandwich bread. The only thing I changed was the amount of salt (decreased by 1/4 tsp) as mentioned in some of the other comments.

This is the best bread recipe I ever tried, and I've tried many over the years. I use a bread machine. I followed the recipe exactly, no changes. So far I've made this bread four times and every time it's been wonderful. It's chewy and light. Great for sandwiches, toast and for meals. I'm actually making another one right now. This time I added a tablespoon of orange peel granules. Looking forward to seeing the result. Thank you!

I use this bread in our bread machine.  It is almost a no fail bread.  We love the texture and flavor.  It could stand up to sandwiches better, but we usually are using it fresh from the bread machine.  If it has time to cool, it is a great consistency for sandwiches.  It also reheats well the next day.  We use brown sugar instead of honey in it.  To make up for the loss of liquid, I use 1 1/3 cups of water instead of 1 1/4.  I have used both butter and olive oil in it with no noticeable difference.  We also use oat flour instead of quick oats.

Pretty good recipe, great taste, nice and light and easy to make!  

I ended up reducing the yeast to 1 tsp to keep the loaf from over-rising.

I've made this recipe a few times now, and I will be making it again and again. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe. The second time I made it, I substituted applesauce for the butter and I tossed in some very ripe bananas that I had. I also just used the machine to knead the dough. I divided the dough in half, placed in greased loaf pans, let them double, and baked at 375°F for about 40 minutes. This is such a good recipe. Definitely a good staple bread. Thank you :)

I just took this perfect loaf out of the oven and had to taste it immediately.  It is fabulous.  It has a nice soft texture and is very tender and absolutely perfect.  The changes I made were minimal.  I substituted canola oil for the butter, 1 3/4 tsps of yeast rather than 1 1/4. and I added 1 TBSP of flax seed for more texture.  I used the dough cycle on the  bread machine then punched it down, formed a loaf  and put it in a loaf pan. I let it rise till double and baked for 28 min in a 350 oven.  Hats off to Wendy Masters!!  I would give this more stars if I could.

My Mom and I absolutely loved this bread.  I followed the recipe, using the whole wheat rapid rise setting on my bread machine.  It was perfect, and I'm about to make another loaf.

Excellent bread!  I made by hand rather than with a bread machine.  27 minutes at 375 F and it came out perfect.  It was so delicious hot out of the oven that I couldn't resist eating a quarter of the loaf immediately.  Good thing it is a fairly healthy recipe.

Great bread, well balanced. Soft on the inside and hearty. I left out the milk and didn't miss it.

Great bread!  I didn't have any milk powder, so skipped that.  I used all whole wheat flour and molasses instead of honey - nice dark color and taste!

Veeery tasty bread. I will bake it again but BE CAREFUL WITH THE INGREDIENT AMOUNTS when converting from US to Metric: I used the US measuring system for some ingredients and the Metric for other, without changing the servings yield, and the amounts where totally off! Too much water for little flour (I calculated afterward to fix it because it looked like pancake batter)

I'd been looking for a recipe for whole wheat bread and so far, I love this one!  I substituted the dry milk for 1% milk and added 1/3 cup of crushed pecans!!  Baked it in the quick, whole-wheat setting of my bread machine (3.30hrs) and it turned out great!  Fluffy, flavourful... the only thing I will do next time is reduce the salt, it was a bit too salty for me.

I made a crock pot stew for dinner and went looking for an oatmeal bread to serve with it. This was a good choice - I followed the recipe as indicated, with the exception of adding 2 tsp yeast (I have found this to be the ticket with other recipes and this one was no different). This recipe had a great flavour and a fine texture for a whole grain bread. Thanks for sharing Wendy.

This was lovely, tasty bread! No breadmaker, mixed in my Kitchenaid with the dough hook. I used agave instead of honey since it's what I had on hand, and added 1/2 tsp brown sugar to help the yeast bloom since I wasn't sure if the agave would work well. Let rise twice. Cooked about 40 minutes at 325, with a bowl of water in the oven to keep it moist. Thanks for a lovely recipe, my son and I both loved it!

Love this bread. Have made it several times.  I make the dough in the bread machine and bake it in the oven.  (I don't like the way any bread looks when baked in the bread machine.)  Wonderful flavor!

Very good recipe. I didn't use a bread machine, though.I made it with my stand mixer and baked it in the oven at 375 for 25 minutes. My family loved it. I will definitely be making it again.

Great bread.  Needed to use a total of 3 cups flour and next time will use 2 teaspoons yeast to get a better rise.  Baked in oven at 375 for 30 minutes. Delicious right out of the oven, it got eaten in a 1/2 hour!

This bread is great! I didn't have milk powder so I used 1 cup water and 1/4 cup milk. I also tried King Arthur unbleached white whole wheat flour instead of regular whole wheat. Turned out great, fantastic recipe!

I added 3/4 of a cup of Whole Wheat flour to any batch I made as I found the dough too wet. For your info 24 serving calculation = 2 loaves, 36 = 3 loaves and 48 = 3 loaves   1 1/2 pound loaves. I cooked the bread for 33 minutes as I live at an altitude of 1500 feet. Use the bake setting on your oven and not the convection setting. Place pans in the middle of the oven.

Great loaf, made second time today. I followed instructions, it made a nice loaf.  Next time though I think I will just use the dough cycle and bake in oven for a regular shaped loaf.

Completely underwhelmed by this bread.  I followed the suggestions of others and increased the yeast to 2 tsp, and switched the ww flour & white flour quantities.  My setting on my bread machine was for whole wheat bread, light crust.  I got a dry bread that was lacking in flavor.  I would not recommend this recipe.

Like the previous reviewer, I used all whole wheat and whole grain oats.  I also didn't have enough butter, so I substituted 1 Tbs olive oil for the last Tbs butter.  And for further health benefits, I added in about 2 Tbs ground flax seeds.  I baked it in the oven (375 for 25 min, like the previous reviewer) and it turned out very good.  Too dense, I would say, but still very tasty.
