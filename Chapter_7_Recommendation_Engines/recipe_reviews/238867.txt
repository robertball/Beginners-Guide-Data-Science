I think that the pectin should cook with the berries instead of the sugar. Add the sugar after boiling and bring back to a hard boil for one minute. I like that it is a little runny. Great in plain yogurt. Adds a beautiful color when swirled in.

Well I don't know where I went wrong but mine turned out more like syrup for ice cream or pancakes. I think there is either not enough cooking time after the pectin is added or too much sugar. This is the first time I made huckleberry jam.

I wish I had done more research before using this recipe. I made two batches both turned out terrible. They are more tacky and candy like than jammy. Sugar crystals are beginning to form in the jars. I ve since done more research. Most other recipes recommend equal parts sugar and huckleberries. This recipe asks for too much sugar which explains why mine is tacky and forming crystals. Huckleberries are expensive and hard to come by. So I m a bit heart broken.
