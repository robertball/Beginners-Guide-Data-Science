I have been making these cookies for a number of years and have tried many variations. One of my favourites is to add a little lemon juice (instead of vanilla) and some grated lemon rind. The combination of lemon/poppy seed with just a dollop of cherry preserves is very tasty! I also chill the dough to make it easier to work and I have learned the hard way to make a deep thumb print. These are very addictive and never last very long!

Variation: Make walnut size balls, flatten them under a drinking glass.
Bake until light golden. When cold glue two bisquites together with 
lemon curd or raspberry jam. 
Dust with confektionerÂ´s sugar.
Keep in a airtight tin. Will be slightly soft in the middle after some hours. 
Good to have in the freezer.

These are different, but good.  My best advice is do not overfill with jam and do not overcook.  I took them out when they were barely done and they stayed soft and not too crumbly.  Dipping my finger (index) in water and making the indentions was the easiest way for me.  I used raspberry seedless jam.  The poppy seeds add dimension.  I would make these again for a party, because they do look nice and taste decent too.

Very tasty and fun to make.  Made exactly as directed except for jam flavour.  The poppyseeds add good texture, especially when nuts are not an option (allergies).  Will make again.

Nice tasty cookie.  Next time I will make them a bit smaller, I was surprized to see how big they got, but Yum!  I will be making another batch tomorrow. I love the poppy seeds and they look very nice along side the other Christmas cookies on a tray.
Thanks for sharing Nancy.

This was such a good, quick and easy, and tasty recipe to prepare.  I used just raspberry jam in them, but they are by far the best thumbprint cookies I have ever had!

My son has a peanut allergy, so these are a terrific thumbprint recipe with no nuts.  So delicious, the poppyseeds add a wonderful crunch.  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect, only wish I made a double batch!

Delicious:  light and buttery.  Cherry preserves add a nice sour filling.  I found that making the "thumbprint"  wide and deep provided the best results.  I also baked them at 325 because they weren't getting done at 300.  I baked until slightly brown on the edges.  I made some with cherry preserves and some with blueberry.  Both very good.  Next time, I'm going to try some with lemon curd.

These cookies were good--melted in your mouth.  They could be made with any kind of fruit preserve.  I ran out of cherry so used blackberry.  The flavor of the cookie base was a little mild--I think using almond extract instead of vanilla would give the flavor a little boost.

I made these for the 1st time last Christmas. I've made many different varieties of cookies over the years, but these are the only cookies that my daughter (22 yrs) found memorable enough to ask for again this Christmas. She and everyone else very much enjoyed so making again this year!

Very Good! Made for a cookie exchange & everyone loved them, especially since there were no nuts. Very easy, spread more than I thought they would, but that did not affect the taste. Delicious!

I have made this recipe recently and they are absolutely fabulous. You don't have to stick with just cherry jelly/jam however. You can also try different fruits like strawberry. I used strawberry and apricot and everyone thought they were fantastic. very flaky and light cookies that seem to melt away in your mouth.

These cookies would be great with any kind of preserves, I think.  I used kumquat in half and strawberry in the other half.  Both were delicious.  I would recommend chilling the dough before scooping it, though, so the cookies don't spread out too much.

the photos were so bad of this lovely cookie, i felt i had to make them and take a picture just to save their reputation.

followed original poster's recipe with 2 changes:
- 1/2 poppyseeds to 1 tbsp instead of 2
- lowered cooking time to 17 minutes to accommodate convection oven

we love these ~ our 3 year old twins... notsomuch

I have nanking cherry trees in my yard, which I make cherry jelly with every summer, and I stumbled across this recipe when I was looking for something to do with the jelly.  The cookies are very tasty and I make them every Christmas with my seasonal baking!

These are good.  I rolled them in little balls before make the indentation & they look more proessionally made.  I also dusted them with powdered sugar.  I may make them with lemon curd instead of jelly next time.

5-20-10 - tried them with lemon curd, but like the jelly better.

I had jam from my Christmas package and needed to bring something to a family dinner. The idea of thumbprint cookies came to me. Unforunately I couldn't find any poppy seeds at such notice but I just did without. 

The cookies are very light and have a subtle taste. Very nice!

Tip: don't make the cookies very big (about the size of a quarter) and make sure the thumbprint is nice and deep, otherwise when the cookies melt in the oven, the jam will go everywhere. Also don't make the thumbprint too deep - enough cookie must stay under the jam, otherwise you get a gooey mess when you pick the cookie up.

Next time with poppy seeds, though!

I've made these cookies every year for Christmas since I discovered them (can't remember how long, but at least 4 years now).  They are my absolute favorite!  Delicate, not too sweet, and a little tart from the cherry preserves.  They don't last long at my house!

I was very disappointed by these cookies as I found the the dough very bland. I like the idea of using cherry preserves as a cookie filling, but the flavor of the actual cookie was just too dull. I won't make these again.

These are pretty little cookies. And yummy too. They have a delicate flavor, almost like soft shortbread. I used marashino cherry halves rather than preserves or jam. Yummy!

these were good,but not exceptional. As others have stated a little bland, maybe the almond flavour would shine thru??
I also love poppy seeds so i double those. didn't have cherry preserves so i used apricot for half and wildberry for other half. I would make again....

These tasted better when they came right out of the oven, but I would not recommend freezing.  They defrost kind of soggy.  Not many of them came out too pretty.  I think if you would refrigerate the dough for a little bit, it may allow it to be more workable.  It is a very sticky dough.  I probably wouldn't make again.  Sorry.

I have been making these cookies at "cookie day" with my friends and sisters for a several years and they are wonderful!  Very easy and always a hit. 

One year someone new to our group made them too big and they were on the ugly side.  To save them I made a glaze of powdered sugar, milk and a touch of almond extract to drizzle over the cookies.  They looked fantastic and the almond was great with the cherry!  We now use the glaze every year.

I love these cookies. I made them last year for our annual Christmas cookie baking day and they were a hit. Cookie day is tomorrow and I am looking forward to these cookies.

*Update-I have been making these every year since 2004 (I think) for my annual cookie day with my friends because I love them and because they are always requested. I have used all different flavors of jam over the years and they are good no matter what.

These were rather unimpressive, in my book- a dissapointment since I had such high hopes. I used both apricot and cherry preserves (seperately! Not together!). I do like the simplicity of baking the cookies with the filling already done, however, the cookies themselves are a little too dry and non-flavorful. An ideal base cookie for this should have a subtle, rich flavor- and this one doesn't. My dog loves them, though- which is nice since there isn't anything bad for him in them! Perhaps a better chef than I will have better luck...

Very good cookie.  The only thing I did different was drizzle powdered sugar and milk glaze over the top to make them look cuter for the cookie tray.  They are really good.  I love the cherry preserves.  I hadn't tried cherry preserves before and they work perfect.

Just made these yesterday...the texture is really nice, and I really like the poppyseeds too. I used redcurrant preserve, as that was what I had on hand. This was my first go at a thumbprintcookie, so I had a bit of trouble with indent/jam ratio. Some cookies had jam overload, and it sort of bubbled down one side. No problem, really, as I was decorating some other cookies with white chocolate glaze. Took out the whisk, and drizzled, criss-cross, over the top of the whole batch. Hid the flaws, and it looked great.Will definetley make these again!

I loved these cookies!  So simple and delicious.  I did drop the vanilla to 1/4 t and added 1/4 t almond extract.  The kids and hubby likes these too, and they went very fast.

These cookies are WONDERFUL.  I made them for the first time at Christmas, and have made them many times since then.  They ARE almost addictive!  I make them rather large, and make the thumbprints deep to hold lots of jam.  (I've used strawberry and raspberry too.)  They spread out while baking, and I like the jam to cover most of the cookie.  Delicious!

Easy recipe to make!  I made a gluten free version with 1 cup of Bob's Red Mill All purpose flour and 1 cup of coconut flour.  added and extra egg white and Xanthum gum (1/2tsp).
I also used maraschino cherries instead of the preserves and it was a fun pop to bite into the cherry.  Turned out a little dry.  I might use almond flour next time instead of all purpose gluten free flour along with a whole egg or butter, or might cook for less time.  
I do think adding lemon would make it taste even better as other reviewers have done.

Although they tasted fine, I must have done something wrong. The cookies seemed to be almost frying on the cookie sheet.There seemed to be too much fat, so for the next load I added more flour, and they baked fine this time, although they seemed a bit ... dense.I did use margarine instead of butter (we have a milk allergy in the family).   It might be the margarine, but I have never had problems with recipes requiring butter so... don't know what the problem was.

I made these with raspberry preserves rather than cherry (just my preference), and they are wonderful....crumbly without being dry, buttery, and the poppy seeds give a lovely subtle flavor and beautiful appearance.  Great with coffee.  Would be a wonderful cookie for tea, a shower, or Christmas.
