I make these a couple times a week bc my husband is from Venezuela. These are a staple in Venezuela and can be stuffed with anything from ham and cheese to steak.  They are also good stuffed with chicken salad. It took me a a few tries to get them perfect but they are worth it. Very good.

I'm not Venezuelan, I live in Guadalajara, Jalisco. We are so used to making these, we make quesadillas, and we deep-fry them, slice 'em open and stuff with cubed bistec and very spicy tomato sauce. They can also be made with Maseca. Same consistency. If you live in Mexico, P.A.N. can be found in any Superama, Walmart doesn't have it. Thanks for posting, I love your recipes!!!

This is pretty much the recipe from the cornmeal product container.  Having said that...  you can't really beat it.  Sometimes, if only seving as a vessel for salsa, I 'll add some seasoning to the batter, but it is totally not necessary.  Easy, fast and delish.

I just had to post how you actually make the Arepas before frying. You grab a handful of dough and roll it around in your hand until it is a smooth ball (the heat of the hands helps to get rid of rough edges). Then you slowly pat the ball  until it is evenly flat, not too thick or thin. Adding Parmesan cheese to the dough adds a nice touch, but I find simple is better. You can also make thick oven Arepas by heating  the Arepas in a pan lightly greased until it has a bit of a shell, then pop in oven until it  is cooked through and looks a little flaky, cooking time varies depending on size and how long they were in the pan, you can also skip the pan step. =)

Maybe I did something wrong, but I thought these were extremely bland, plus they were kind of sticky in the middle, almost like they weren't cooked enough, but hard on the outside, like they were overcooked.  I made them twice with the same results, I tried cooking them faster the first time and then slowly on lower heat the second time.  The texture is just terrible and I don't know how to fix that.  It's a shame, because my daughter is celiac and I'm always trying to find her a quick sandwich option that's not terrible.  I'll keep trying until I use up the PAN, which I had to order on-line, but I don't think I'll buy any more.

Made these exactly as described, using coconut oil, and they came out perfect.  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  Filled some with chorizo, sliced chayotes, and grated cheddar, others with Italian sausage, peppers, onions and cheddar, after sauteing the chorizo, chayotes, italian sausage, peppers, and onions in separate piles in a large skillet.  They were delicious, and perfect for me because they are gluten-free!

The brand name Harina P.A.N. was proposed by Empresas Polar's then President and Chairman of the Board Carlos Eduardo Stolk. He selected the acronym "P.A.N.," in Spanish "Producto Alimenticio Nacional," or in English, "National Food Product," to represent a food product for mass consumption for all Venezuelans."

I love these so much I bought an arepa maker as a Christmas present to myself! In my family there are so many dietary preferences. Vegan, vegetarian, meat eaters. I make these for Christmas and everyone brings a different filling. I have filled them with the chicken tinga recipe from this site, I have also filled them with carne asada.  Black beans and sliced avocados are good. Cream cheese and jam is very good. Even scrambled eggs and bacon. There is a filling for everyone! Unfortunately after one or two you are stuffed! One thing I wanted to add, make these as you need them, they are no good reheated! If I have any left over dough it will keep wrapped tightly in plastic for a few days.

These are awesome. It pretty much follows the recipe on the bag of masaarepa. They took a little longer to cook... probably 10 minutes per side. We stuffed it with cheese, black beans, and shredded chicken.

It literally didnâ€™t work. The corn flour just sat at the bottom o the water so I kept having to add corn flour. Then when I went to cook them they crumbled and fell apart. The flavor also was way way under salted. I had to throw them away.

Fantastic basic Arepas recipe! The water/cornmeal proportions needed to be adjusted slightly to find the exact consistency I was looking for,  but they turned out great.

These are quite good. It's important to keep an eye on the temperature because these need to be cooked thoroughly, therefore you have to make sure they don't burn on the outside.

Ridiculously simple, very tasty. I played it up a bit and stuffed mine with shredded cheese (combo mild cheddar and Jack).

I made these as written, only difference was I made them thinner and did not split them, came out with 14. They were delicious  also hit them with some fresh cracked pink salt as soon as they came out of the pan.  They were so good!

I made this recipe today, and my only addition was to oil my hands to better hands the dough, which was a bit too wet and kept sticking to my hands and not forming the patties. Regardless, they came out pretty great!

So easy and they turned out  perfectly the first time! I made them as a trial run before  my son and daughter in law came into town. They were so good we ate the leftovers for breakfast when they arrived. They were a hit . We plan to make them tomorrow. What a treat, especially for those of us who are gluten intolerant.

Not sure if the mesa I used was right or not. They still want down a treat. I can see how it could be very versatile to make a array of dishes or quick and easies.
