I've made this recipe twice and both times the applesauce was great!  However, i found that when i used fresh apples picked from our tree, it didn't need any sugar.  The second time, i used apples that i had frozen and needed the sugar, but used half of what was recommended. It's an easy recipe and i love it!

I don't like cloves and debated using them.  I did and OH MY WORD was this awesome!!  I used the food processor for 3/4 of this then used a fork just to break up the remaining apples so there would still be large chunks.  We had it while it was still warm and oh my word!!  Never again will I buy applesauce when I can easily make it.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!!

**EDIT:   I've made this numerous times now and it's great warm but even better the next day!

It is imporant to rememeber that apples come in various forms. Some are sweet, others tart. Some have firm flesh and others soft.  Therefore, there is no exact recipe for anything involving apples.  With that said, this is a great basis to work from.  I used Cortland apples, which had a sweet taste and firm texture.  I tasted the apple mixture right before I was supposed to add sugar, and it was sweet enough so I left it out.  Then when it was finished cooking, I smooshed its with the back of the spoon to make it smoother, but still chunky.  A number of people commented it on not getting it smooth enough. Some advice: use softer fleshed apples, add more water and cook for longer, or use a blender, as previosuly stated. Over all this was a great way to make applesauce!

This recipe was really easy, although I needed to use less water (about 1/2 a cup only) because I soaked the apples in water with a little lemon juice to prevent browning, although in retrospect I guess it doesn't matter since the cinnamon and cloves are brown :).  This recipe tastes exactly like Mott's cinnamon applesauce which I LOVE, but I can pronounce all the ingredients that went into it.  I used 6 Fuji apples (I tried this with golden delicious and did not like it - I'm going back to Fuji or Cortland next time - the Fuji won't need any sugar) and 1/8 c sugar, and probably could have gone without, completely.  I used 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon cause I love cinnamon, and will leave out the cloves next time.  I also might try throwing in some strawberries or other berry.  I did need to cook it 5 minutes longer.

Delicious flavor. I did blend mine in the food processor and I found that it cooked better when I covered the pot with a lid. Overall great recipe and exactly what I was looking for!

Yum, this was really good.  I only added 2 tablespoons of sugar, left out the cloves, added a cinnamon stick, and used a potato masher to reach the consistency I was looking for.  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh man, SOOO good!  We are moving in a week and so I've been looking for recipes to use up all the food we have.  I've have about 5 apples sitting in the fridge for a few months and I thought this looked easy enough.  Totally worth it!  So easy!  I didn't have any cloves, so I just used 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, that tastes great.  And I think next time I'd half the sugar, but I'm one of those types to not like my food sweet.  I think it's great as is though!!!  Good recipe!

I used brown sugar instead of white.  My tip is to begin by cooking just the apples and a small amount of the water.  You can then add water as needed as the apples begin to break down--you will then have the perfect consistency.  Once the apples have cooked down taste them to determine the correct amount of sugar and spice needed because all apples have a different level of sweetness.  I also used my immersion blender because we prefer a smooth sauce.  My kids and husband proclaim that this is the best apple sauce they have ever tasted!

This should be a 10.  It is so simple and so natural.  I ate it hot and I loved it.  Only thing I did different was a squeeze of lemon juice, a pinch of salt and cooked it in the crockpot for 4hours on high.  This recipe will be one of my classics.

Wonderful taste, easy recipe to follow.  My contribution is to put everything in the slow cooker  and cook it on low for 6 hours.  Smells great when you come home.

This is almost identical to the recipe I use for applesauce...I use apple cider instead of water, adding just enough so the apples don't burn or stick.  Also, taste the applesauce before adding the sugar as some apples are sweeter than others.  I cook slowly over low-med. heat, I find it gives a more intense apple flavor the longer it cooks.  When done I mash with a potato masher to the consistency I want.  Hope you find these tips helpful.

This is an great tasting easy applesauce recipe! I used fresh golden delicious apples from the orchard, halved the amount of sugar and used a little less water than what was called for and it turned out perfect. Cooked it for 3-4 hours in the crockpot on high heat and mashed most of it with a potato masher which left some chunks in it. Delicious!

Yes, this was very easy. I used a teaspoon of homemade apple pie spice instead of the individual spices asked for in this recipe. I also used organic apples. After the apples simmered, I used my potato masher to do a quick mash on the apples, leaving some chunks for a more textured applesauce. This was a lifesaver for someone who cooks quite a bit with applesauce and found herself out of applesauce and low on time.

Very good. I never bother peeling apples when making applesauce! Added only ½ cup water and simmered covered very low heat for 1 hour 15 minutes. The kitchen smells so good! Added ¼ cup sugar and 2 tablespoons honey the last 15 minutes of cooking time.

Excellent and easy recipe. I used Empire apples, about 8 cups, 1 cup of apple cider, 4 cinnamon sticks and 1/4 tsp ground clove. No sugar was needed, but I like it a little tart. I would use turbinado or light raw sugar if it needed sweetening. It adds more flavor than white sugar. It made 2 pints, after some judicious sampling, one to freeze, and one for the fridge. I look forward to playing around with different apple varieties and maybe some ginger next time.

Super simeple and easy recipe.  Loved the simple ingredients of this recipe which I had on hand.  I put this through a food mill and the texture was great.  It had a little more juice leftover after cooking but I gradually added it back in after the sauce was cooked.  Would definitely recommend this applesauce recipe.

My 4 year old and I made a 1/2 batch of this and served it hot in coffee cups with a dollop of cool whip! Yummy! I intended to use apple pie spice instead of cloves....but was out so I made it with only cinnamon and it was great.

Very good but came out a little too sweet. Next time I will reduce the sugar. I used some leftover Granny Smith and Red Delicious apples we had and they were great!

Excellent basic recipe I did modify a bit. Used allspice instead and also my apples were plenty sweet enough and the sugar was completely unnecessary I would definitely taste them before you add the sugar!

I wasn't too pleased with this recipe...  although it made the whole kitchen smell lovely while it was cooking!  My husband likes his applesauce less chunky, so I made sure to chop/food process the apples very small.  It would be good fresh and warm, but didn't seem that appetizing when cold or as leftovers.

For my medium sized ~3" Dia Cameo apples this recipe took 4 apples. and I used crushed clove heads so the clove taste immediately after cooking was irregularily distributed. I'm looking forward to tasting it after freezing. Really yummy comfort food. Might make a great base for a chutney or fruit soup.

I LOVE this recipe!!  I adjust serving size to 18 servings which makes 9 pints that I can.  I scale back sugar depending on sweetness of apples.  I also LOVE the way my house smells as I'm making it.  The best part - my entire family can't get enough.  Thanks for sharing this!! To make a large batch, it's best to add 1/2 the apples to the pot and mix with 1/2 of the other ingredients.  I mix the other 1/2 together in a large mixing bowl.   Then I add that to the pot and mix well.  This just helps distribute the spices more evenly.

I am usually not the type to rate something, but I thought this recipe was fantastic.  Who knew you could make such a treat in 20 minutes.  I reduced the amount  of sugar drastically because it just did not need it.  My question to my husband was "why can't you buy chunky style applesauce"?  I loved the chunks of apple.  I won't be buying applesauce any longer, this is too easy!  Thanks for the recipe.

This is soooo good! I double the cinnamon and don't add any sugar. My 9 month old gobbles it up! I also canned it. Hot applesauce, hot canning jar, filled up, twisted lid on, flipped upside down till cool. Super easy! This is my go to applesauce recipe. Thank you!!

My family loved this applesauce, it was gone in less than 20 minutes and they were begging for more. It could be partly due to the fact that I halved the recipe (oops! won't do that again!).   I only used 1 1/2 tsp sugar because I knew the apples would be sweet enough on their own, and boy am I glad I didn't use any more! I figure it can always be added if it's not sweet enough. This will be our main applesauce recipe!!!

I follow this basic recipe except I add a little bit of ginger and some pumpkin pie spice instead of the clove. I also use brown sugar instead of white as I prefer the deeper caramel flavor that goes so well with apples.

So very good.  I made this today to go with a ham dinner.  Felt like it could have used a little more water and I actually ended up putting it in the crock pot and cooking longer.  By the evening, it was perfect.  I think next time I'll just start in the crock pot.  Husband loved it; said it tasted like the inside of an apple pie.  I only added a teaspoon of sugar to get the water to be more like syrup (it ended up getting all absorbed) because I used fuji apples.  I'll make it again most definitely just for the yum factor and ease of it.

Really like this as a starting point.  I added a shot or so of brandy with a little less water.  I added a little more cinnamon because we LOVE cinnamon and then I reduced the sugar by about half because I was using a fairly sweet apple.  I'd suggest adding half of the sugar and taste and then add more until you're happy.

great, easy recipe! I also found that my applesauce was already sweet-but they were slightly tart, so I added just 2 tbsp of sugar. delicious while warm, kind of weird sour taste the 2nd day, but that went away and it has lasted well in the fridge :) I hope I never have to buy jarred applesauce again.

I'm not a big fan of applesauce, but this is perfect. The only change made was to puree the apples, thats more a matter of personal taste than anything else.

Great recipe.    Instead of ground cloves I used 1/4 tsp of ginger and 1/4 tsp of allspice, I also used a potatoe masher.

Very easy, simple recipe that tastes great! My first time making applesauce and it was a success. It's a very nice side dish for pork. I only used about half the sugar called for in the recipe because I felt that it was sweet enough. As long as you add small increments of sugar until it's sweet enough for you, it should work out just fine.

Been making applesauce this way for years. Never have bought applesauce. I like the addition of nutmeg also. I make it both  with the addition of some sugar and with no sugar. Like it both ways! Most of the time I double or triple the recipe as I freeze alot of applesauce but it can also be canned.

I used only about 1/3 c water, and mashed with a potato masher when cooked, for a chunky texture which we pefer.  I've always used Splenda, and added a little nutmeg, as well.

This is a great base recipe to work off of. I doubled the cinnamon and added a dash of nutmeg. I used a mix of 4 different apples (can't remember what kind but 2 were red varieties & 2 were green varieties) and took the advice of waiting until the end of simmering to add the sugar. I wound up using a little LESS than 1/8 cup, significantly reducing the sugar! I found it sweet enough. 

I've made this twice. The first time I left it as is and enjoyed it's glorious chunkiness. The second time I was canning and planning  to give it away to people who didn't care for chunky applesauce. At the end of the simmer I dumped 2/3 of it into a blender and blended until smooth. Then I added the remaining 1/3 so there was just a slight chunk reminding folks that what they were eating was handmade ;-)

Best applesauce I have ever had. Made exactly as recipe says. Not a fan of cloves, but I am so glad I added it anyways. Delicious. This is my third year now canning this recipe for use the rest of the year. I will never buy store bought applesauce again.

My dad is the applesauce maker in our family, and his recipe is much the same.  The differences:  less sugar (depending on the apple), no cloves, and he leaves the skin on (it strains out in the final steps and gives the applesauce a pretty pink colour!)  Great, easy recipe!

I got an applesauce recipe off of here last year, but it was missing something. It did not taste like what my grandmother used to make.   It was the cloves! I made it and it brought back so many memories. So glad I found the "missing" ingredient.

Great applesauce recipe! I like my chunky applesauce to be less runny, so next time i will only use half the amount of water. I also halved the white sugar and used dark brown sugar for the other half. I added a little more cinnamon, 2 tsp lemon juice, and 1 tsp vanilla. Im sure next time it will be even better!!

This was very good.  I did blend in the blender for a smooth consistency.  Also, I added sugar to taste which probably only amount to 1/4 cup or less. I omitted the cloves as I didn't have any on hand.  I eyeballed the cinnamon and added a bit more after blending.  Overall, very good!

This was yummy...reminded me of the applesauce my grandma used to make for us, but too sweet for our taste. Best when served warm, and I made it again halving the sugar and adding in some fresh peaches I needed to use up (same amount of peaches as apples). It was delicious!

Good recipe!  It tastes great without adding any sugar and just a little bit more water.  (A dash of nutmeg is great too.)  A healthy treat!

The only thing I added to this recipe was about 1/8 tsp. nutmeg.  I used a potato masher to eliminate the big chunks.  We ate it warm and thought it was delicious.  My 4-year-old daughter even ate a second helping!

I LOVE this recipe.  I'm not a chunky applesauce person though, so I will run my chopped apples through the food processor after cooking (and cooling!) to make a smoother applesauce.

Not really like applesauce at all.  I used a masher to try to get the apples to resemble applesauce more.  Thought my toddler daughters would LOVE it but they wanted nothing to do with it.  Also, I believe less sugar could be used - maybe half of what this suggests.

I doubled the amount of cinnamon, and cut the sugar in half because of the natural sweetness of the apples. I also doubled the recipe to can extras! Yum!

I just made this a little while ago, and it is definitely a keeper!  My husband and I both tried it, and it was all we could do to wait until it cooled down.  This is so easy to prepare, and also so adaptable to any change one might want to make.  We will be using this one again and again.  I'll bet it would work just great with pears.  Also you could use a little brown sugar instead of white, or mix the two, as well as experimenting with other spices.  Anyway, thank you Jackswife for this wonderful and simple recipe.  I cannot believe I reached the ripe old age of 67 and never tried to make homemade applesauce!!!

Original recipe called for too much water, in my opinion. I like my applesauce chunkier, not soupier. Added more cinnamon, used nutmeg (didn't have cloves), a pinch of kosher salt and brown sugar/white sugar mix. This was my first adventure in making my own applesauce and I was greatly rewarded! Thanks for posting it and thanks to those who shared their revisions.

This recipe was excellent and so very yummy!  I used 6 fuji apples, 1/8 teaspoon each of cinnamon and cloves, 3/4 cup water. I let that that simmer for about 15 minutes before putting just 2 spoonfuls of sugar in and let it simmer for 10 more minutes.  Then I transferred it to my food processer and pulsed it a dozen times or so.  It was fantastic warm. I will try it tomorrow cold. I can't wait!  Thank you for the excellent recipe. I will never buy applesauce again!

This was a great applesauce recipe. I love chunky applesauce, and this one fit the bill.  I used the recipe to just eat by itself and to mix with a cake.  When you use it to mix with the cake you need to add some moisture since it is a chunky recipe.  The spicing in it is wonderful.

Good recipe. Here's a way to make it even easier. Don't bother peeling or coring apples. Just cut them into quarters or eights. After the apples finish cooking, put them through a food mill. It will separate out the peels and seeds. Plus, it leaves the applesauce with a pretty pink tone.

This is a perfect applesauce!  I made it in the crockpot and it could not have been easier.  My apples were pretty sweet so I halved the sugar and it was just right.  Thanks Jackswife!

INCREDIBLE!  I put the ingredients into the crockpot as I left for work and it smelled like fall when I walked in!  I used 1/2 the sugar, as I knew my apples were already sweet enough.  Great flavor!

Once you try this recipe you will never buy jarred applesauce again!  I've been making it for years (without sugar).  You can make it even easier by not peeling the apples and just throwing the whole mess into a food mill.  This will give it a nice, smooth texture and remove the skin.  If you have leftovers it freezes well.

Oh Wow!  This was my first time making applesauce.  It was really easy and so delicious.  I made it exactly as the recipe says to.  If it matters, I used empire apples.  I think I found my new dish to take to family gatherings. :)

Fantastic!  Super easy to make.  I love that it doesn't have high fructose corn syrup like the jarred stuff.  My family will be eating this from now on.  Using the bruised apples in the discount section of the supermarket, a triple recipe cost me about $2.

This was phenomenal!  It tastes just like the chunky spiced applesauce I used to buy at Trader Joes in the US! They don't sell good applesauce here in Sweden.  We left out the sugar because we used golden delicious apples which are pretty sweet and the apple sauce was perfect without it!  Thanks, couldn't be easier either!

Excellent recipe. It is the first time I have made applesauce and I am very impressed. The texture is great and the flavor is wonderful. I wasn't sure about the cloves so only used a bit, but after it was simmering for a while found I could add the full amount of cloves and it was very tasty.  I have printed it off and it will be my one to use every year. Thank you

Very good applesauce.  I went ahead and pureed mine because I was looking for a smooth consistency. I also followed other reviewers advice and cut the sugar a lot.  The simplicity of this recipe makes the results very gratifying.

I used pink lady apples, leaving the peels on, because I like the difference in texture. Gave some still warm and freshly made to my husband. The verdict? "Yum! and I don't even like applesauce." I am serving it tomight with potato pancakes ans sliced leftover pork roast. I will always make homemade applesauce from now on. Mmmmmmmmm.

I am not sure if it would be better the next day there was none left to save. I did like leaving the peel on the apple. It gave it a better slightly better colour and taste.

When I made this recipe I used 3 different types of apples, and left out the cloves. It was very good, except I found that even after adding only half the sugar it was almost too sweet. I also pureed it in the blender after it had cooled to give it the consistancy I wanted.

My kitchen smells heavenly!  Boyfriend came in from working outside and after one whiff, he couldn't wait to sample this.  We both agree, this is a winner!  I, too, was a little hesitant about adding the pinch of cloves, but it's the absolute right thing to do.  As another reviewer suggested, sample the apples before adding the sugar to determine how much you want to add.  Great way to use apples that are no longer crisp for out-of-hand eating.  I cannot believe how easy and rewarding this is.  Thanks for this submission!

I didn't know homemade applesauce was this easy...and so good too! I added a little nutmeg as well and blended it like others suggested (but I think I'll try it with some apple chunks next time). Didn't end up using as much sugar as suggested.

I served this w/ 'Minnesota Pork Chops'. I blended all the apples. It was really good - so good, I think people thought it was jarred! Next time, I'll leave some of the apples whole (as suggested).

Very simple and very good.  I used extremely tart apples, and 1/2 cup sugar was just about right (would probably have used less for "regular" apples).  I liked the chunky texture!  My husband thinks it would be delicious warm over vanilla ice cream.

Smells lovely while cooking and tastes amazing!  A great way to use up bruised or mushy apples.  This recipe made my "throw away" apples into "wow!"

One of the best batches of applesause I have made. I also cut the sugar using 1/4C and it was still a bit too sweet but delicious anyway.

I made this with a half-dozen Macintosh apples, added a tsp of lemon juice to the water as I was chopping the apples up to prevent browning, & only used 1.5 tbsp of brown sugar.  The apples came apart as I cooked them & only needed to mash them with my rubber spatula to make them nice and lumpy.  They were so good my 9-month-old actually ate them instead of flinging them around the kitchen. :)

Made this in the microwave. Used 7 C. sliced apples which I dipped in a Fruit Fresh solution and quickly drained, this means I skipped the added water also. Left out the spice, we sprinkle that in when we serve it. 7 C. apples produced a scant 2 1/2 C. sauce. Used an old fashioned potato smasher and left it lumpy. Hubby says it's better than store bought!

So easy and delicious.  I used my blender to process it for just a few pulses.  I only used 1/4 cup of sugar, because we don't like our applesauce too sweet.

I think the amounts are a little off. Needs a little less sugar.  Also it needs to cook longer. I kept having to add more water to get the right consistence without burning it.. I think it's a fine base recipe but it really depends on what type of apples you use and their size etc. personally I like to do applesauce in the crockpot ... It ends out coming out so much smoother. When I cook it in the crockpot I use 5-6 lbs apples (or about 12 cups chopped), 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 cup water, 1 tbsp lemon juice. I cook it on high for three hours then I mash it with a potato masher. It comes out yummy and smooth.

I rated this recipe a 3 as is, because I think it's too sweet.  Applesauce doesn't need sugar because apples are already sweet.  So I made it with no sugar, and used nutmeg instead of cloves.  We all loved it with those changes.

This was a nice and easy recipe. I used 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon instead of the 1/8 tsp. as suggested, because my son is a big fan of cinnamon. My mom is a tough critic and she really  enjoyed the applesauce, too.

When I make big batches to can, I mash the apples with a potato masher.  When I open a jar for a meal and I want it smoother, I use a stick blender.  Does the trick!

Rarely I say this, perfect! Easy to read and follow recipe. I added a pinch of allspice as well. My only note: if you can crush your own clove/allspice. The ground ones loose the rich oils released when you crush them!

Makes a very nice applesauce.....used up a lot of apples that my kids picked at the orchard this weekend......time consuming to peel and make - if I didn't have extra apples about to go bad, I would totally just buy Motts!!

This recipe filled our house with the scent of fall - apples and spice. I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and it was perfect. Simply delicious and impossible to mess up - my kind of recipe! Thanks for sharing it.

This applesauce was wonderful.  I added some nutmeg and some powdered vanilla to it to jazz it up a little more.  I also didn't love the chunky consistency so I threw mine in the blender and pulsed it a few times.  I will for sure make this recipe again.

This recipe is so easy and very good. I did make a few changes by cutting down on the sugar and added vanilla.  I didn't have any cloves, but will use it next time.  I put it in my crock pot for 4 hours on high.  Thank You for sharing all the reviews and for the recipes.

Excellent. I used tart apples so the amount of sugar was just right. I like mine blended so I used a food processor to break it down a bit more, but it's nice that this gives you the option. Delicious!

this was amazing! I also cut the sugar in half and using pulse on my blender still left me with some chunks of apple...which was great! My 2 year old loves it for snacks and even dessert :)

We just went apple picking and used all of the apples for this recipe (about 30 apples).  We may not have any for lunches this week.  My kids and my husband won't stop eating from the pot.  I did omit the white sugar because we didn't need it - and substituted 2 tablespoons of dark brown sugar. I also used a hand blender at the end because my youngest is just a baby.  We are going back for more apples next weekend!

I'll never buy applesauce from a store again.  This is delicious, and very easy to make!  I ended up cooking it awhile longer, as I made a larger batch.  The cloves add a special touch to the flavor.  Hubby says it tastes like apple pie.  :)  Thanks for sharing!

WOW!! This is the best applesauce I have ever tasted. I've never been too fond of store bought applesauces. They're either too cinnamon-y or too bland or too "something". Now that I have a newborn, I thought maybe I'll make it from scratch for him. I vow never to purchase applesauce again!! It's so simple and delicious and you can make it as chunky as you want. Fabulous recipe. THANK YOU!!!

Delicious!  I ended up w a combination of chunky & smashed--just right.  Next time I will add a few cinnamon candies before I add the sugar.  Marshmallows are also great in applesauce.  Used to do these two things back when I used to can and be a stay at home mom.

I had no idea making applesauce could be this simple! I do plan to leave out the sugar next time - of course it depends on what kind of apple you use, but I found it every so slightly too sweet.

Yummy~ I had to get rid of a bunch of apples, so decided to make applesauce for my daughters lunches rather than buy the packaged stuff.  I didn't realize I had no cinnamon, so substituted Pumpkin Pie spice. I doubled the recipe. Also I added 1 cup of frozen blueberries after it had simmered for awhile.  Delicious!!

Thought the recipe was excellent--I cut back the sugar to 1/4 cup because the apples I used were sweet enough.  I put the applesauce in a processer just to chop it up a bit more---was like having apple pie without the crust.  My DH said he would prefer to have this than store bought applesauce.  A nice healthy treat on a cool fall night....thanks

This was very tasty. Even my husband who generally prefers bought applesauce said it was not bad (high praise!!). I did however put it in the food processor after cooking to get a smoother consistency. It was a good and yummy way to use up excess apples I had in the house.

Great recipe! Was fantastic both hot & cold. Only changes: added an extra apple, a wee bit less spices, and a sprinkle of powdered vitamin C (to help prevent browning). I put it into the food processor since my kids like their applesauce smooth. I'm hoping to make more tomorrow! yum!

The only thing I would do differently is chop the apples into small little pieces, then cook, then I mashed the pieces up to make it more like sauce. Before mashing, I drained a little liquid first. Then after mashing, you are able to put on stuff. Other than that, it tastes great.

I made this as a project with my 3 and 4 year old. It turned out great, though my daughters say they are not found of the cloves. I used a food processor for a smoother consistency that we like.

Great recipe! I used 3 Jonagold and 3 Macintosh apples. Didn't put all the sugar since it was already pretty sweet just from the apples. The ground cloves are a great addition. If you have an immersion  blender, it works great to get it as chunky or smooth as you want. This went great with the grilled pork chops we had!

Absolutely the best applesauce.  I too was concerned about a clove taste, but it does add just that right touch.  I used my boat motor (imersion blender) right in the pot to get the chunks out.  I've made this twice now and as others have said, the apple size,type and sweet/tartness can make a difference . . . but this is a receipe that is very adjustable.

Wow". Just made this and absolutely love it!  Fast and easy!  I did add more cinnamon since I like it. About 1teaspoon.  I forgot to turn it down to simmer once it started boiling and kept it on medium. Done quickly but not overlooked.. Be sure to thinly slice the apples so they will cook quickly. Can't wait to share with my family today when they come over!

This applesauce is the best I've ever eaten.  No more store-bought applesauce for my family.  I like that I can choose my own organic apples and the other organic ingredients.  It could definitely be slightly less sweet.  Next time, I will put less sugar in the sauce.  Also, because my family balked at the idea of chunky sauce, I put the sauce in a food processor to get the typical creamy consistency that they are used to.

This was WONDERFUL!  I was surprised on how easy and quickly this was to prepare.  I used granny smith apples and a bit more cinnamon and served it with ginger bread.  Will make again and again and again - Thanks for sharing.

I love cinnamon so I added a lot extra (1 tsp.) I only used 1/8 cup sugar since I tasted it and it didn't need anymore. I like my applesauce chunky so I thought this recipe is great. I will make again and again.

I think I needed to cook these longer than suggested. Mine came out more like just chunks as you can see in the pic I submited. I tried to mash them down a litle, but had no luck. I will also use only half of the cloves next time I make this.

I have actually made this applesauce several times and it has always been a hit with the gang.  This has to be one of the easiest recipes to make on this entire web site.  The hardest part was peeling and sectioning all the apples.  

There are only five ingredients in the recipe and I eliminated one of them - the cloves.  I don't love cloves except in a baked ham but I do love the cinnamon flavor in this applesauce.  I didn't use as much sugar as is called for but if people want it sweeter then more sugar can be added afterward.  Enjoy!

I had some gala apples I needed to use up. I remembered I had recently purchased a Pampered Chef apple peeler, corer, slicer that I haven’t used. I found this recipe and decided it would be a nice, healthy snack. Smells great while cooking and I added 3 large Granny Smith apples with the 8 or so small galas. I never add sugar when I make applesauce. Very easy and tasty. I will make again. I used to can applesauce but never added the cinnamon until I served it. I never used cloves but it is perfect. This is a keeper.

I have made this three times now and each time used different apples. None of them needed sugar. I also don’t peel the apples because I like my fiber. But I do use a handheld blender to pulverize the skins after it is done cooking. It gives more color to the applesauce too. This recipe is so easy. I always have cinnamon and ground cloves on hand so all I need is the apples. Great recipe!

Super simple and tasty!  I had NEVER made applesauce before and had some apples I needed to get rid of.  I cooked as directed and then just mashed the apples up with a potato masher.  It still had some chunks, but it was thick with a really good flavor.

Easy, fast and great-tasting. I scaled the recipe back to use only 2 apples, and it made 12 oz. of sauce.

Applesauce is amazingly simple and quick to make.  This recipe is a pretty standard method.  The only thing is be aware of what type of apple you are using and what consistency sauce you prefer.  A crisp apple will require a bit more water a sweet apple, less.  If you boil the apples and feel there is too much liquid, pour some out in and keep in reserve.  After you mash if you need to thin it out just add more a tbsp at a time. Same with sugar.  You can always start with less and add more later.

I halved the recipe because I did not have enough apples (I used small organic red delicious apples). The only thing I did differently was reduce the sugar to 2 teaspoons for the half recipe. It probably didn't even need the sugar. Easy and delish! Will definitely make this again.

I will not make this again.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I very finely chopped my apples in a food processor so I wouldn't have to put them in a blender and then I cooked them for over an hour and it still was very lumpy.  It tastes EXACTLY like apple pie filling.  My family doesn't care for it and I put hours into it.  I thought this would be a good way to use up the hundreds of apples we got from our tree, but no.  It was a waste of my time and effort.

I used Fuji apples straight from the orchard (peeled, cored, chopped.) In addition to the cinnamon and cloves, I added 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg and drizzled apples (prior to boiling) with 1 generous Tbs. of honey. I swapped brown sugar for the white and cooked for 10 additional minutes to get a smooth consistency without using a food processor. The end result tasted like an apple pie, without the crust. Perfect!

I doubled the recipe and then just stirred the apples once they were done.  We prefer spicy, tart applesauce so I omitted the sugar.  Wow - delicious!  I think I'll try it as an ice cream topping.  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!

Great recipe and thanks for sharing. I modified by doubling batch. Once apples boiled, I drained them and mixed in food processor with a little water. Also, substituted honey instead of sugar.

so, i had a bag of apples in the pantry that i needed to use up, so i decided to give this a try.  i accidentally put nutmeg in because i wasnt paying attention, but it was a nice addition with the cloves and cinnamon.  i cooked it much longer than the 10 minutes it called for because the apples were not soft yet.  it is preeeeety sweet, so i am thinking next time i could get away with 1/2 the sugar, if not less.  i put it in the blender and made it smooth because when it was done it was more like cooked apples than applesauce.  still pretty tasty though!

Simple to make. I did not use any sugar. The combination of Braeburn apples and Honey Crisp apples were more than sweet enough. Also, I did not have any cloves on hand but it still turned out great.

Wonderfully yummy & easy!  The only things I changed were;  halved the sugar(didn't miss it),and blended it in a mini food processor to make it smoothe.  PERFECT!!  A definite KEEPER.

Yum, yum, yum (but I made changes).  I used a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon and just a pinch of cloves.  I also let the apples simmer for 25 minutes after they boiled and then used a potato masher to get them smooshier.  I only added about a tablespoon of stevia for sweetener.

Made this a few weeks ago, and am presently making more.  My 13-yr-old, who is liking her cooking more than mine, was quite impressed that I made this yummy apple sauce and, just yesterday, requested me to make some more.  My graduating high school daughter, 17, went to an apple orchard on a field trip yesterday and brought 5 pounds of apples home with her - I used those, oopsies!  Hopefully she approves...

I made this tonight with some changes and it was wonderful. I had to cook it a lot longer (and I do mean a lot), but I am high altitude. I read the other reviews and left out the sugar, it did not need it! After filling my home with the smell of apples, cinnamon and cloves. I am eating warm and tasty applesauce as I type!

I substituted the water for white wine, or Guava Nectar(available at the Dollar store) Great flavor!

My family loves this version. Sometimes I don't peel the apples if I am short on time and it's still delicious!
