This was my first time cooking with salsa verde and it was quite nice!  Instead of potatoes, I used chili beans - - we're trying to be more healthy.  I mixed the chicken, salsa verde, chili beans, onion, sour cream and a splash of Tabasco together.  Crush some tortilla chips and lay 1/2 down in the bottom of a 9X13 pan, topping with chicken mixture and then a handful of Mexican cheese, layering until you finish with the crushed tortillas.  Quite filling and a mild salsa taste. This recipe is very versatile - - you can change to suit your personal tastes quite easily.

Yum! Who knew...Salsa and chicken could be soo darn good together. I used boneless skinless chicken and I cut it up into small chunks. That is the only thing I did different. I will make this again. Thanks!!
