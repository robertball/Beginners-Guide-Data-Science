Made these last night and they were delicious. Instead of pork I used ground chicken and slightly browned it in a skillet first, instead of adding it raw. And I didn't have any sherry, so substituted a dry red wine. I served these along with a vegetable stir-fry on top of Udon noodle pasta. Took me longer than an hour, but well worth the time.

Very good!  Much easier to fold wontons than I expected, found a video on YouTube to see how.  Followed the recipe pretty closely. Fried some, and boiled some, liked them both ways.  Will definitely make this again!  Was not that taken with the recommended dipping sauce, tried a variety of sauces, hoisin sauce or plum sauce was excellent with these.

The only thing I added was 1 Tsp of sesame oil to the filling. Only thing I didn't like was the texture...was a little mushy.

These are fantastic!  I used regular cabbage because I had some to use up, but I definitely know napa would do the job better, since it's a softer texture.  Didn't make the sauce part because I was using them in wonton soup.  Very good!!

Delicious. I heated them in hot water for a few minutes then put in a bowl and covered with beef broth and scallions. My daughter must have eaten 20 of them and kept asking for more.

Top notch! I did change ingredients the first time- bad idea. I was out of stuff. So I suggest this- you MUST use the egg white wash to hole them together. And don't over cook. I forgot mine. Next time around, followed recipe and it is outstanding.
