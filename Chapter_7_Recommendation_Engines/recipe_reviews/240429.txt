Didn't care for these at all. The cookies flattened out paper thin in the oven with lumps where the cranberries and chips were. I think the suggestion of adding oatmeal instead of coconut might have helped this situation. The dough definitely needs more body, and as for the taste, they are way too sweet for us.

Sorry-I have to agree with other reviewers. These just lacked the flavor I was hoping for. I’m sure they needed more sugar. And just a note-it is the same recipe from both the Craisins package and Quaker Oats. I so wanted these to be perfect and they just weren’t

This recipe should have baking soda and NOT baking powder. Also, if you omit the coconut then you will definitely need to add some more flour. I suspect even with the coconut this recipe needs more flour because it is way too wet and sticky for cookie dough. They taste good, (I did not use coconut) but the ingredients are off

Followed the recipe almost to the letter, but the batter was too gooey (to my not-that-much-experienced eye) so ended up adding almost a whole cup of flour more. Turned out okay,  but a little dry.

We liked these.  I omitted the coconut but added some chopped Macadamia Nuts.  Do not over bake these.  They are a flatter cookie but very tender with crispy edges.
