Very easy recipe and fresh! I would make a few changes when I made this recipe again. I would cut back on the seafood seasoning as I found it too salty for me. I did have to add a few more crackers which was fine. The sauce has a nice kick!

I made these with 1/2 C plain soft bread crumbs instead of crackers. When I pulled them out of the oven, a ton of grease was on the baking sheet. But the cakes themselves weren't greasy, had an excellent texture, held together well, and were delicious. The sauce is also delicious, though I reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp cuz I can't handle too hot.
