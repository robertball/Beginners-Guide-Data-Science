These cookies were delicious, but they didn't taste exactly like sugar cookies because of the almond extract.  I think vanilla would work much better.

I substituted 4 cups of the white flour for whole wheat flour, they puffed up nice and thick like little cookie biscuits.  Wonderful!  My family raved about them.  My mom took them to work and all her co-workers loved them.

I thought that this recipe was pretty tasty. I might consider substituting clear vanilla for the almond as I discovered that some people have an aversion to almond. Who knew? The dough is easy to work with -- made beautiful cookies and came out looking lovely.

My new favorite! These were very tender and lightly sweetened. I used butter flavored shortening and vanilla (instead of almond). Yummy!

Not sure what was different for me but these were terrible.  I thought the ingredients were unusual but followed others advice substituting Vanilla for Almond and rolling a bit thinner.  They taste like cardboard.  If you only are looking for appearance then these are great, just don't eat them.

I halved this recipe, but found that I needed to add a lot more milk to it. I also found that the cookies puffed up a bit more than I thought; I would recomend rolling the dough quite thin.

I reallly don't want to hurt anyones feelings... but my whole family disliked these.. a lot. it tastes like a lump of flour.  after making them and tasting, it actually put me in a bad mood.. I just wasted 7 cups of flour, and shortening which is NOT cheap. !  if you are going to make this type.. roll them way thinner.. put some butter in there.. and add another cup of sugar.. hopefully it will save them... I make tons of cookies from scratch and these were awful. :(

These came out perfect.  They were a breeze to make and delicious too.  I used vanilla instead of almond and butter instead of shortening.  Because a lot of people remarked on them not being sweet enough, I added an extra half cup of sugar as well.

I would call this recipe OK... we put vanilla extract in instead of almond and used butter flavored shortening. but the cookie just tasted BLA and a little to dry... although the dough was very easy to work with and they looked beautiful even made a horse shaped one for my daughter... they just didn't have much flavor... WOULD NOT MAKE THEM AGAIN

Use vanilla extract!!! The almond extract probably changed the taste of the cookie. It didn't taste quite like the sugar cookies I had in mind. But they came out and tasted fairly good.

Here's an idea...instead of substituting the vanilla for almond, or the almond for vanilla, use BOTH almond AND vanilla!  It is an absolutely wonderful flavor combination.  Just try it in ANY cut-out or butter cookie recipe.  YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!

I thought these were delicious! I made these with my preschool age daughters and didn't expect to like them, thought it would just be a fun project. I was very pleasantly surprised though! I iced them with royal icing. Couldn't stop eating them!

I subsituted the almond for vanilla, but they don't taste like anything. They are easy to roll out , and you don't need to refridgerate the dough, but they have no taste. I had to put icing on them, just to get my kids to eat them. Maybe I did something wrong.

The doughwas wonderful, but sticky had to add alot of flour to be able to roll out. they cooked up nice BUT, they tasted dry and had a distinct flour taste. Im wondering if alot of icing would mask this but will try others. Looking for a thick prfessional looking cookie to paint for valentines day. Was very disappointed. I think its the shortening, maybe more sugar???

I had to keep these cookies in the oven for an additional eight minutes--I have no idea what I did wrong, but even after they started to turn golden around the edges, the insides just did not TASTE cooked. I think it might have something to do with the fact that I hand-mixed the batter. I will have to try this one again.

I'm giving it only 4 stars because yes, as per other reviews, it does taste sorta flour-y but it didn't bother me or anyone else. It may not be as sweet as other sugar cookies but when used with sugar cookie glaze, it suffices instead of making it too much sweeter. I thought it was great.

I wouldn't make these again. They had no flavor. Maybe it was because I used vanilla flavoring instead of vanilla extract?  The look nice though!

I halved this recipie and at first I thought the dough had a funny texture, but they were VERY easy to roll out.  They do turn out to be a little bit more like a shortbread cookie, as they are not as sweet as most sugar cookies.  I rolled mine out very thick and made them into "popcicle cookies" as a bridal shower gift...turned out fantastic.

Halved the recipe and used rum instead of extract (didn't have any). Also used two eggs in the halved version. Iced with a pink colored frosting of powdered sugar and milk. Big hit!

The Dough turned out like Pizza dough or something. Followed all directions. Haven't coked them yet; hopefully the will turn out ok, but the right now, the texture is not right at all and they taste bad!!!!!!!!!!!! Maybe they turn out with the full recipe but take my advice and DO NOT HALF THEM.

These were far from the best cookies I've ever made.  While they were easy to roll out, they had too much of a "flour" taste. Maybe icing would have helped, but I never got that far.

I was quite disappointed by how these cookies turned out. I followed what other reviews said by substituting vanilla for the almond extract and by rolling out a bit thinner. They lack the sweetness that sugar cookies usually have and seemed a bit "heavy" to me almost more like a shortbread cookie than a sugar cookie.

I agree, these cookies taste like cardboard.  On the upside they are easy to roll out and cut (my two year old helped me).  However, the taste leaves much to be desired, I prefer store bought cookies to these.  My cookies ended up with a slightly grainy texture, I am not sure why.

Great recipe. The dough was very easy to work with. Though I did sub the almond for vanilla.

They tasted more like Corn bread only in cookie form. I didn't like them too much so i will not be making them again.

I made this with 2/3 vanilla, 1/3 almond, butter flavored shortening and SOY milk. Taste great, hold their shape, and PERFECT for my son who's allergic to dairy! Thank you! Topped with royal icing--delicious.
