This salad was so delicious!  I did add one can of black beans to it and the pimento gave it a little extra something. Everyone that was over asked for the recipe, and all the kids that were there gobbled it up. This will become a regular for me, and is a fantastic addition to any meal.

This stuff is great.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly. The second time,(and every time after!) I have used olive oil rather than veg oil; and apple cider vinegar instead of white... (and a full tablespoon of black pepper to contend with the sweetness.)  Yummy!

The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar-I used 1/4 cup and it was great.  If you take it anywhere, be prepared with copies of the recipe!

This has been a popular recipe in our family for several decades.  The only change I would strongly recommend is to cut the sugar in half- 1/2 cup (or less).  I add green pepper and 1/4 t celery seed.  My kids even ate it when they were little.

I made this earlier today and it is "marinating" as we speak. I too used evoo and red wine vinegar and only used 2 tbsp of sugar (and it's still sweet). One cup would make my teeth fall out. Added the black beans and I am also going to add some fresh basil to it tonight just before I serve it. Yum - thanks for the recipe.

This is an old family favorite of ours.  It's colorful, tangy and clean tasting, and it's always a favorite at potlucks.  We even make it at Thanksgiving and Christmas, and our friends always ask for care packages.

I thought this was going to be really weird but I tried it and it was delicious.  Brought it to a potluck and it was devoured.

Delicious-made only some minor changes. Substituted asparagus for the green beans, added black beans, and omitted celery-YUMMY! Everyone enjoyed it-even my husband who is not a fan of "marinated salads."

What a neat recipe!  I halved the recipe as I was cooking for only two.  I used small (8 oz.) cans of the veggies, and that worked just fine.  I think I might try the other reviewer's suggestion of adding black beans, but otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!

This was easy to make and my husband loved it.  It was a bit too sweet for me.  Next time I'm going to cut down on the sugar and see if I like it better.

The recipe is great as is!  But it is amendable as needed depending on the fresh vegetables you have on hand or in season.  I add purple onion for color, but soak them in a bit of vinegar and water on their own and add them at the last minute so their dye doesn't recolor the lighter colored veggies!  Soggier fresh veggies may be added about 30 minutes before serving...like zucchini or yellow squash... just be sure to chop them cold from the fridge so they won't warm up the salad.  I've added water chestnuts for crunch...green chilies for heat...different kinds of beans for color. There isn't much from you garden that will not go with this salad and it's dressing.  You can even add shredded cabbage and turn it into a vegetable slaw.  And yes! The vinegar syrup may be used to can and pickle just about everything,  too!

This was really not great. I cut the sugar to 3/8 of  a cup since 1c seemed like a LOT of sugar, and I still thought it was too sweet.  I did only refrigerate for 5 hours before I ate it, so maybe the flavors will set better in the morning.

This is a great cool summer salad.  It also keeps well for repeated serving.

After draining all of the excess "sauce" the salad was a lot more crisp and fresh tasting than I had anticipated with using so much canned goods.  A sweet pickling salad that is a good side for most any occasion.

This was a nice easy vegetable side dish.  I chose to use frozen steamable veggies (par-steamed) instead of canned per personal preference, and subbed asparagus for green beans.  This wasn't Mr. LTH's favorite side, but I enjoyed it.
