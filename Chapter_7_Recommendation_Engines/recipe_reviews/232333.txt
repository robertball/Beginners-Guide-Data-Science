Plugged in "salmon" and "rosemary" and this recipe came up. It was very good. Instead of mayo I used Greek Yogurt and I blended the rosemary hazelnut salt & pepper all at once and just loaded it on top of the yogurt. Healthier so easy and delish!!!

I tried this recipe tonight but with only 2 pieces of salmon. The mayo and lemon juice makes it very tasty. I didn't have the Rosemary or hazelnute but it was great even without them. I will use this recipe again very soon

My family really like this recipe! I didn't have any hazelnuts so I submitted chopped pecans. Delicious. Also I left it in the oven longer about 25 minutes because we like our baked fish a little crispier. This is a keeper.:)
