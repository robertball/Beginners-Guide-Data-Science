This is the perfect glaze for the irish flag cookies. Don't expect a typical "frosting". Because the vanilla makes it cream colored I made an additional 1/2 batch w/o vanilla for a middle white stripe. I liked that it hardens fairly quickly...if you apply one color stripe to all the cookies by the time you move on to the next color-the first has dried. Just stir in a drop or two of water to your bowl if needed. I like the glaze on the thinner side-very smooth and pretty on the cookies.

It did get hard quick but it worked perfectly for frosting the cookies. It's more like a glaze than frosting but it worked great for the cookies.

This recipe should be changed to "ICING" instead of frosting. This recipe is PERFECT for this type of cookie - it spreads easily then evens itself out to a nice smooth finish. BUT - it does not really taste good alone. It definitely needs to be on a butter cookie!

Frosting (really it's a glaze as everyone has mentioned) is super sweet. You can add water to thin it down or you can add confectioner's sugar to thicken it. I found that using a butter knife worked ok to spread it - I just had to be really careful about not blending the lines of colors on the flags. I got better spreading the frosting as I continued. If you have the frosting a little more watery it helps to blend and become more smooth looking.

We thought this frosting was AWSOME! It was a perfect finish to the Irish Flag cookies. Though we had to triple the amount of ingredients because we made too many cookies it tasted fabulous! Hope this review helped! - Emma & Sierra

I thought it was gret. You must not not not use generic powered sugar. You have to spring for the pure sugar cane as it doesn't contain corn starch or something. It really makes a difference.
