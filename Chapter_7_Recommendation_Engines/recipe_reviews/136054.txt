I made this for my daughter's 11th birthday.  Though we only had a few guests, not even a crumb of this was left at the end.  I worried about the texture of the marshmallows after being refrigerated, but the ones inside the filling were wonderfully creamy, and the toasted ones on top were equally good.  
Thanks for a great recipe.

I love this recipe, I did make one change however. I am a vegetarian, so I just didn't add the marshmallows. It is very delicious.

This cheesecake is the best. I made it for a party at work last Friday and as soon as it hit the table it was gone in less then 7 minutes. I had people saying "if I buy the stuff would you make it for me". I even had a woman offer to pay me for the recipe! They couldn't believe that I made it from scratch.
