The flavor of this sauce is very nice.  I don't have a blender (!) so I chopped the jalapeno as fine as possible.  Can't wait to make it blended!  I served it with baked chicken tenders and roasted red new potatoes.

This has to be one of the best dipping sauces I have ever tasted!  I have now used this with the chims, potato skins, and served this to put on tacos.  We love it!  Sometimes I use ranch dressing in place of the sour cream.
