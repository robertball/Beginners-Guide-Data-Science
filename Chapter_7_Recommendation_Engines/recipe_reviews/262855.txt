This turned out really tasty. I added a bit of garlic powder, and used jalapenos instead of pimentos (because we like everything spicy).  The combination of spices gave it a more intense flavor than store-bought pimento cheese, which I personally loved. I also used Miracle Whip instead of mayo for a bit more tartness. Great recipe!

I don't really love the taste of cream cheese, so finding a recipe where there wasn't any was key. I did up the amount of cheese from 2 cups to 2 and a half cups (because I really wanted cheesy flavor) and I added celery seeds. This recipe was really flavorful and spicy and rivaled the pimento cheese I've had in restaurants.
