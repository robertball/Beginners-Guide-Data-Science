My family is filled with reluctant carrot eaters. This is pretty good, however, I think the content of eggs is awfully high. I used one for half of this recipe, and there were parts that had the consistency of an omelet. I would say you can probably get away with one egg for the entire recipe. I didn't have vanilla (apparently I have been baking up a storm), but this dish was good without it.

I liked this so much. A great way to use a whole bag of carrots. It tasted like dessert. I took the other reviewer's advice and only used 1 egg and that worked out really well (thanks). I also used coconut oil and 1/2 butter, and a little less sugar. I'd say 1/4 cup would work just fine. I didn't have vanilla either, but it still tasted great. I'll definitely make this again soon.

I wouldn't make these again, super sweet and did not let the carrots great flavor through at all. My family wouldn't touch it. I was sorry to have wasted my good organic carrots, so I made it into muffins.
