This is very tasty especially for one of the lower-calorie options for cobbler, but the topping part was softer and less crispy than I'd like. A common pitfall I come across in cobblers, I suspect it has to do with having less butter than some recipes. Still definitely worth every calorie. Thanks for sharing!

I will definitely make it again. The fresh orange juice truly made it! Yummy!
