This is absolutely delicious but be warned, it tastes like a real dark chocolate and hazelnut spread, not a commercial nutella taste. I followed the recipe for the exception of using avocado oil instead of canola oil as I don't buy canola oil. For chocolate I used 70% Lindt. At first I was disappointed as mine stayed very liquid, after about 24 hour it settled and is a perfect spread!

Fantastic and healthier than the leading brand. I, too, added a little extra oil.

My family are Nutella lovers, and they loved this.  I had to add double the oil required, and that still wasn't enough to smooths the texture in the finished product (I guess that's why Nutella uses Palm oil??), which dries out as it cools.  But I know my family wouldn't mind if I just made this all the time instead of buying Nutella.  But the taste surpasses the original.

The hardest part of this was peeiling the skin off the hazelnuts.  Next time, I will buy them hulled (finally found them at Sprouts).

I used swerve confectioners and Hersheyâ€™s sugar free chocolate chips and it turned out great!

My sons love Nutella, but I don'y buy it often because of the sugar content and palm oil. I was excited to try this recipe! I made 1/4 of the recipe to see if we liked it, the taste was better than store bought, my son said it tasted like Ferrero Rocher chocolates, yummy! I used vanilla extract powder for the liquid extract and no had no issue with it being too thick, chocolate seizes when liquid is added and I think this is what is happening. I used canola oil for my oil. Lindt dark for the chocolate chips. I used this to fill 12 chocolatines. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've made this several times. Sometimes I've used coconut oil (the unflavored kind) instead of canola; it produces a firmer product, but softens easily in microwave.
I love this spread on Trader Joe's "Everything Crackers"!
Watch the hazelnuts in the oven, they scorch easily.
The whole batch fits nicely into 2 half-pint jelly jars.

I followed the recipe and it was very tasty, but a bit more liquid than I expected. Next time I'll reduce the oil.
