I mixed the matcha into Triple Zero Vanilla Yogurt and used it as an apple dip. Good for breakfast or afternoon snack.

It is good using vanilla yogurt, but I personally like it better with plain yogurt. I like the tangy taste it adds. It is also good mixed in various fruit yogurts. I especially like it in peach, strawberry, and raspberry yogurt.

Simple and easy to make. Didn't sift the matcha and it blended in perfectly. Used 0% fat Greek yogurt. Powerful matcha flavor! Beautiful green look.
