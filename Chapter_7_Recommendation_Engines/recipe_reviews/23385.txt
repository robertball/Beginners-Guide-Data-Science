Very good. I used only 1/2 cup of sugar, and reduced the cloves to 1/4 tsp and the ginger to 1/2 tsp. They were plenty sweet and browned well with the reduced sugar. Next time I may reduce the ginger a little more.

These are incredible! I used melted butter or oil instead of solid butter... otherwise I found the batter wasn't moist enough to mix. These smell wonderful in the oven and taste just as good.

Wonderful!  Healthy, too.  Used 1/4 cup dates (blenderized) as I wanted some raisins (1/4 cup, whole, tossed with the flour).  Used 1/4 tsp salt, oil instead of butter, and 1/2 tsp each of the spices (just right - don't like too spicy).  Done at 15 mins, but prefer the 20 mins as they were more chewy and great muffin crust.  Also, used a vegetable peeler to get off the orange part of the rind and threw away the bitter pith (the skins were too thick, I guess).  The blender worked well in chopping up big pieces of rind.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe - it will be one of my favorites.

I used between 1/4 cup and 1/2 cup of sugar and cut the ginger and cloves down to 1/2 tsp but wow, these were awesome!

Good "helping" recipe for my 2.5 year old too, he loved chucking all the things in the blender. He gave them 2 thumbs up after trying one as well.

I'm not a huge date fan so I wasn't sure if I'd like them but the dates get ground up so small that you barely even notice them - delicious!

Will definately make again.

These were great.  I used only 1/2 cup of the sugar as I prefer my muffins not to taste like cup cakes.

Very tasty!  Next time I will decrease the ginger and cloves as one baker recommended.  Otherwise, my only comment is that the dough was very thick compared to other muffin recipes, but in the end, they turned out great - even separating from the paper muffin cups once cooled.  Also, I replaced the egg with a 'flaxseed egg' (two parts warm water, one part ground flax seeds, blended with the rest of the blended items).  Delicious!!

Really yummy! I added a cup of fresh cranberries and they turned out amazing! The second time I made them I added a tbsp of pumpkin puree along with the cranberries and again they tasted great (although the pumpkin & the orange turned them slightly green!) A really great recipe that I'll be making again!

I loved this recipe!  I'm always on the lookout for healthy, fresh muffin recipes and I was really pleased to find this one with a whole pureed orange in it.  I altered the recipe a little to cut down on fat (I doubled the recipe, but used the same amount of butter and added some applesauce to keep it from drying out).  I'm sure the original would have been just as scrumptious, but here's what I did for a double recipe:
2 oranges
2 eggs
1/2 cup margarine
1 cup 2% milk
1 cup raisins
3 1/2 cup flour
1 cup sugar
2 tsp baking powder
2 tsp baking soda
1 tsp ginger
1 tsp cloves
3/4 cup applesauce

I used sour milk instead of butter milk.  The cloves were overpowering in this breakfast muffin, and nobody really liked them EXCEPT for my son, who normally hates breakfast muffins, which is why it got a higher rating than what the adults thought.  So apparently, picky children love this muffin.  Will make again for my son.

These were great! I'm going to wait to see how they are tomorrow, but right out of the oven the ginger and cloves were just a tiny bit too much (and I love cloves...).  Only changes were to replace 3/4 cup of the flour with whole wheat, and I forgot to blend in the butter so I melted it and whisked it in before adding the dry ingredients.  Love the orange and date combination!

I made these muffins in kid-size mini muffin tins for my picky son who doesn't like anything and he devoured 3 or 4 of them!  I made some adult size ones too and me and my husband were impressed also.  I have made these about 5 or 6 times now.  They are a family favourite.  I usually make them with 1 cup of white flour and 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour to make them healthier.

Love the combination of orange and dates.  A bit too sweet for us but it is easy to cut back on sugar for individual tastes.   Do suggest that butter is used (and at room temperature) because that is where you get the wonderful flavor.    Also find that 1 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. of baking soda works well.   Sometimes you can taste baking soda and it takes away from the flavor.

My family gobbled these up. Much easier to blend the whole orange instead of grating the peel and then juicing it. I suggest blending the oranges first so that they get really small and then adding the other ingredients. I used half the flour and the rest oatmeal, and they turned out a little crumbly. But I love oatmeal in muffins, so I didn't mind. I also used less sugar and it was plenty sweet. I would have liked bigger date chunks, so next time I'll put them in with the flour and not in the blender. Oh, and I used half the amount of cloves, since I don't like cloves and added some cinnamon and nutmeg because I love that combination of spices.

I adapted this recipe by adding more dates (dates are very sweet naturally), less sugar (1/4 cup) and by replacing the butter with a banana! Much healthier but still very sweet and tasty! Loved it! I would definitly make that recipe again.

My boys and their friends gobbled these down. This recipe is a keeper. I made 2 substitutions-almond milk for the buttermilk and cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. Perfect.

Great muffins! I left out the dates and made mini muffins. I had to reduce the cook time to about 11-13 minutes and it was moist.

These were very good, and they smell wonderful while they are baking. I followed some of the other reviewers advice, and halved the cloves, and ginger. I think I will use the full amount next time though.

These were so good! There was "something" that made you want to keep eating them.  I reduced the cloves and ginger to 1/2 teaspoon, due to personal preference.  I liked the result and will do that next time as well.  I also added some chopped walnuts. I didn't really taste the orange, but the texture was very good and the dates were delicious.

So GOOD!!!! This was such a surprise. I loved the technique of putting the wet ingredients into the blender. It made for a quick and easy breakfast/snack. You can barely taste the dates which is great if you have any date haters. Absolutely wonderful recipe to play around with too. Cinnamon can easily be used instead of cloves, and the sugar can quite easily be reduced without losing any flavour. Thanks to the submitter. The amount of ginger powder is perfect.

These are really, really good! I cut the cloves and ginger down to 1/2 tsp each, other than that I followed the recipe. I love the orange taste, and that they are not overly sweet. The house smells wonderful while these are baking too! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

What a fun twist!  I loved blending up the wet ingredients with my immersion blender. I followed this recipe closely, only replacing a small portion of the flour with whole wheat.  Still, I had to decrease the temp to 375F half way through and still had some blackened bottoms. The spices were fine.

Great recipe. I modified it slightly by using 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of white, used 1 cup of white flour and 3/4 cup of whole wheat stone-ground flour instead of just white flour. Also, I did not have dates so I used figs instead and it worked wonderfully. Thank you for the recipe, this one is definitely a keeper!
