Made muffins that turned out moist and added more spice as suggested. Baked for approximately 15 mins. Used pecans and FODMAP approved chocolate chips for added flavor. I do not care for the flavor of the flour, taste like uncooked powdery flour, so I'm going to experiment with other flours that don't taste powdery to me, like coconut and almond flour. If you like the all purpose gluten-free flour, then give this a try!

Nice, simple gluten free pumpkin bread. I did reduce the xanthan gum to 1 tsp. My family enjoyed it but I would prefer more spices for myself.

I was worried that the bread would be too dry because of the lack of butter but it was excellent. I used part White Rice Flour and about 1/2cup Potato Starch. I also added a little icing on top for decoration.

I will definitely make this again, probably within the next few days because we loved it! However, check if it's done at least at 45 minutes.  I checked it with a toothpick at 50 minutes and it was done.  Had I kept it in the oven the full hour it would've been dried out and overdone.  Because of other reviewers comments about needing more spice, I added 3 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and also added about a 1/4 cup of mini chocolate chips and substituted pecans for the walnuts. It rose just fine and was moist and delicious.

First time making and eating pumpkin bread and really enjoyed this. It is moist and has a good mild pumpkin flavor.  The recipe did not say the size of the can of pumpkin so I used a 15 oz can. I also used half the amount of cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice.  I served it with honey butter. This is going in the keeper file since I could not believe it was GF.

Love it! I actually put a good chunk of the walnuts on top before baking and it added a little crunch to the crust

Mine turned out sort of flat and dense. The instructions say it should resemble a batter, but mine was more of a thick dough ball. I followed the recipe ingredients exactly. I'd try increasing the moisture and maybe a bit more leavener. The taste was good, not too sweet but not savory.
