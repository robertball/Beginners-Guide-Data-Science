I was intrigued by all the positive feedback on this recipe. It WAS excellent. I took in some of the suggestions: I cut the salt to 1 tsp, I let the bread rise on my parchment covered stoneware sheet, I did brush the top with the egg wash and I did cut the bread lengthwise. I didn't have any cornmeal so I skipped that. The parchment prevented any sticking. I also put the pan of ice cubes in the bottom while baking. I used all bread flour and it was fine. I may try it in a loaf (in a loaf pan) and use the half bread flour/half AP flour option and see how that turns out. Has anyone ever tried this in a loaf pan?

The crust is superb; nice and chewy and the middle was nice and soft. I did let the bread rise about ten minutes longer than the recipe called for, as it looked a bit on the skinny side at 40 minutes. 

I am a microbiologist by trade. Yeasts are living organisms. They respond to moisture and, more importantly, temperature. If it's cold, your yeast just isn't going to rise as fast as you'd like. There is an optimum temperature for all microorganisms. Since we work with human pathogens, and not commercial food organisms, I don't know the exact range that this would be. I do know that the extra ten minutes made all the difference in the rising for this bread.

I got bigger loaves by letting the dough rise on the actual baking sheet. Moving the dough after rising caused it to fall and resulted in small loaves.

Can I give this six stars? What a great recipe-easy and yummy. I let the loaves rise on a pan with the cornmeal and then baked it without having to move it. There is a local Italian restaurant we go to for the bread. This was better than that. I used 2 cups bread flour and 2 cups all purpose flour.

For those of you that use a jar of yeast instead of small packages.  1 package is equivalent to 2 and 1/4 tsps of yeast.  

Anyways great bread!

My family and I loved this bread, my husband is Italian and he loves bread. We go to a little local Italian shop where they make fresh bread and it is amazing, this recipe came very close to it. I have been on a bread making kick for the past 2 years and have all kinds of bread making books one even from Le Cordon Bleu and this recipe ranks right up there. The crust was chewy and golden, this bread is little dense but delicious, a perfect bread in my humble opinion. The only alteration I made was to only add 1tsp of salt. I would not make the whole recipe in the bread machine because it is a bit of a dense bread and it will turn out too heavy. This recipe is now one of favorites, thanks for sharing Destiny!  a little tip how do you know when the bread has risen enough? The dough will double in size. It will be soft and look a bit airy. When you touch it with your finger, it will feel soft and an indention in the dough will remain. If it feels a bit springy and the dough bounces back from the indentation, it hasn’t risen enough.

I wasn't expecting so much from such a simple, easy recipe and boy was i delighted!  It had just the right amount of sweet/crunch to it and what a pretty loaf it makes!  i used bread flour instead of the all-purpose so shaping it was a breeze. i added some sesame seeds too.  i also used parchment paper for baking to prevent sticking.

I just LOVE this bread!
The egg brushed on it right before baking makes it shiny and beautiful.  When cutting the top of it b4 baking, I tend to cut diagonally both ways rather than one cut down the middle; impressive look.  1 t. gluten/cup flour makes it even softer.  My family and friends love this too!!

OMG! This bread is sooo good it disappeared right off the table in no time. I tweaked it a bit after reading some reviews. I used my bread machine to make the dough and my oven to bake it. First, I put in warm water and yeast and let it stand for 10 min. This activates the yeast. Then I added all the ingrediants, making sure to add the salt last (on top). I used half All-Purpose flour and half Bread flour. I also reduced the salt to a rounded tsp. I set my bread machine for the rapid french coarse. This worked better than the dough setting which only allows one rise. I set a timer to remind me to take it out before the machine started baking. This gave the dough more needing and rising cycles. As many have suggested, I divided and shaped the dough and let it rise on the baking stone or pan (because transfering your dough can possibly make it flatten) which I covered with parchment paper and a sprinkling of cornmeal. You know the dough is ready to bake when it is soft and leaves an indentation when gently poked. If the indentation fills back in let it rise some more. Rise range 40-60min. I applied the egg solution using a paper towel softly brushing the dough. I think this is better than using a stiff brush because the dough can easily flatten. I pre-heated my oven to 400 and when I was ready to put in the bread I turned it down to 375. I didn't use the water or ice cube at the bottom of the oven as some have suggested (I forgot). But my crust came out crispy, flaky, perfect!

This is nice bread. I will cut back to 1 teaspoon of salt next time. It was a bit too salty.

This bread is so easy to make, and even the kids love it.  Also makes great garlic bread after slicing.  The loaves look like they came from an Italian bakery!

*************** Just AWESOME!  Made as directed with NO CHANGES.  I made these into sandwich roll sizes and need to work on my rollong tech more.  I tried using the knife to split but one collapsed on me.  Another fell while brushing with egg mixture.  I opted to leave that go and sprayed with olive oil instead and gave a quick sprinkle of cornmeal.  They were so delicious!  I made them with chickem cutlets, broccoli rabe, long hots and good provolone cheese.  Simply great!  Family liked them so much they planned out a few more meals they want just so they can have the rolls again!!!  Thanks for sharing!  -/-/-/-/- Just an additional note - hubs said to me the next day:  "I never noticed how store bought rolls taste so floury and doughy until you made these. Yours were so much better!"  I am going to try and make a batch to see how they freeze and if it works then BYE -BYE store brand!/-/-/-/Ok another addition - made lunch for my brother with the leftovers - COULD NOT believe I made them!  Still crispy outside and a soft chewey inside ---can you tell I love theis recipe?  I have enough left over to make garlic bread for dinner too.  Cant wait to have one!
*** made the leftover rolls as garlic bread - they were fantastic!**** My daughter watched me make 1 roll tonight (this is like the 4th time we hae made these now) and she rolled up the rest.  She is 9 and has claimed this as her job from now on.  Ino longer buy rolls - I have this recipe and Becky to make them for us!

Terrific recipe - but I don't own a bread machine!

This is what I did: 

I used rapid rise yeast - so non-machine makers adjust times accordingly for regular yeast!

I used all ingredients as stated.  I proofed the yeast with the water/brown sugar first, then added to the remaining ingredients in my stand mixer's bowl.  Using the dough hook I mixed/kneaded the dough approximately 5 minutes on low speed.  There was no need for additional flours - it was perfect.  

I turned the mixer off, removed the hook and put a towel over the bowl, letting it rise for about 30 minutes.  Then, I removed the dough and punched it down, made it into two loaves and placed them directly on my large pizza stone covered in cornmeal, covered them with the damp towel and put them into a slightly warmed oven to rise for about 35 minutes.

At this point, I followed it up just as the recipe stated with the egg wash and slicing the top (I did short diagonals instead of down the middle - but it really makes no difference that I can see) and baked them for 35 minutes on the nose.

Great recipe, awesome tasting bread, and so very easy to make.   My daughter and I had the first loaf gone before it cooled - sliced it and smeared it with the "Garlic Butter" recipe from this site.  I had to make two more batches that night just so we had some left over!

Outstanding ~ Perfect Everytime!!  I have been trying to master baking bread either by hand or with the bread machine for my whole married life (22 Yrs).  Here is the recipe I have been looking for.  Comes out perfect every time.  Have shared recipe with others and they say the same!  I start off the ingredients in the bread machine, put it on "dough" cycle and it does all the work.  I rise the dough on the cookie sheet sprinkled with (I use semolina flour) and put it in a warm oven, spritz with water occassionally.  When I bake it I spritz with water every minute or 2 for the first 5-10 min. (from bread making class for artisan bread) Excellent!

Loved it!  I'm a fairly experienced baker and found this to be an awesome dough to work with.  I used a tad more water - it's very dry here with the heat on.  Use the full amount of salt - I reduced it per other reviewers suggestion and wished I hadn't.  No need to go to the store when perfectly awesome bread can be made at home!

Good recipe. It makes two mini loafs. Tastes just like the Italian bread you get with take out. The steps for the machine are

1. Place ingredients in bread machine and start it.
2. Machine will knead the bread and then go on to rise the bread
3. After the rise the bread machine will beat the dough down.
4. After it's done beating the dough down that is when you want to take it out.
5. Cut in two, put on parchment paper for 40 minutes cover in plastic wrap with a towel on it.
6. Bake 35 minutes.

The bread tasted fine. I was a little confused as to how long to keep the dough in the bread machine. The dough cycle 'punches down' the dough before the final raising time. This is when I took the dough out to form into loaves. Worked okay and looked pretty with the egg mixture.

Did you ever make something and, when it's done baking/cooking you think, "Wow, I can't believe I actually made that!!" That is exactly how I felt about this bread. I followed the recipe and directions to a "T" with one exception. I followed reviewers' advice and placed my loaves on a parchment-lined baking sheet to rise. That way I didn't have to move them after they did their last rise. I have had unsuccessful attempts with bread baking in the past but this could not have been easier. The house smelled heavenly while the bread was baking. My little boys could not wait to sink their teeth into a slice. When my husband came home from work,he saw the loaves on the table and asked, "Where did you buy those? Looks good! I highly recommend this recipe. I will make this many, many more times, for sure!

This Italian bread was delicious!  I made this for my family and they couldn't believe I made this from scratch!  I do not have a bread machine, so this is what I did.  
1. Proof the yeast with 1/2 c. water, 1 tbsp brown sugar.
2. I mixed 2 c. bread flour and 2 c. all-purpose flour with 2 tsp of vital wheat gluten.
3. Added the remaining water to the yeast mixture and slowly added the flour until a dough formed.
4. I kneaded the dough until it was elastic and smooth and let it rise in a greased bowl.
5. I followed the rest of the directions in the recipe

I hope you all enjoy, it's a delicious recipe!

This is a terrific recipe. I made two beautiful, delicious loaves. I put a pan of hot water in the bottom of my oven during the cooking time. If you're not sure they're cooked through, use your digital thermometer - it will read 200 degrees when they are ready to remove from the oven.

Am I the only person who had to add more water and olive oil to my recipe? I went exactly by the recipe, but my dough was way too crumbly. I had to add 1/3 cup more water and 3 tsp more olive oil. Other than that tweaking, it turned out really well and tasted great. The crust was definitely perfect. I had been wanting to find a crusty bread that tastes like what we can get at our local Italian bakery and this comes very close!

This recipe is fool proof indeed! I took other reviewers' advice and baked it on the same pan it rose on. I let it rise about 45 minutes and turned my back for a second, only to have my cat step on the risen forms covered with a clean tea towel (I'm sure it looked like a comfy warm pillow to her). One of the loaves was squished in 2 places. I let it rise another ten minutes and baked them both off. The 'paw prints' baked right out. This was the most delicious bread I've ever baked-and I've baked many! A second attempt is in the bread machine at this moment. This time, I'm keeping my eye on the cat.

Wow, this is fantastic exactly as written, I have made it twice in the past 3 days.  The second time I made it I beat the egg with the 1 T of water and saved just enough of the mixture to brush over the top of the bread before baking and through the rest of the egg mixture into the bread maker before I started it up and I think it made the bread a little bit more tender.  
The first time I followed the recipe I noticed that a lot of the egg mixture went to waste because you only need a very small amount to brush over the tops before baking and figured it couldn't hurt to throw the egg into the dough rather than let it go to waste.
Also don't forget roll the loaves in the cornmeal before placing in the pan and then sprinkle the cornmeal again on top after the egg wash.  The cornmeal gives the bread a really nice texture on the crust

Very good bread, chewy & more dense than I expected.  Not sure if I am the only person that had to add more warm water & olive oil?  Will make again & try bread flour.  Salt amount was just right.

Wow, this is super-easy, and pretty good! I used 3 c unbleached AP and 1 cup bread flour, reduced the salt slightly (but since I use kosher salt, it's as if I reduced it even more) and after the egg wash, I used my microplane to do a super-fine grating of romano across the top. It turned out really well - the egg wash did a great job of creating that crusty, shiny outer layer (make sure you get it all the way around, or you'll have soft crust where you miss). Be sure to cut fairly deeply; mine only opened a bit with a cut about 1" deep. I took the advice of a few reviewers and let the loaves rise right on the stoneware on which I baked, which was good thinking since moving always deflates the loaves a bit. Even so, I wish the loaves had been just a touch higher, so I plan to let it rise a bit more next time. Thanks for the recipe, it's a great starting point, and a darn tasty way to get your daily allowance of vitamin carb. :D

Very tasty, although my loaves don't look like the picture.  I should have cut deeper like other reviewers mentioned.  For my family, the salt was just right.  I threw a handful of ice cubes in the oven after about 15 minutes of baking - the crust is light and chewy.

I have made a lot of breads.  This one is one of the best ever.  I have been giving it to all my friends.  Some people say it was heavy and they didn't let it rise enough. I think so, because I have made this about 6 times now and had nothing but perfect bread in every way.  I would not change a thing.  We love it! thanks alot... for one of the very best bread receipes on here...

Baked it right in the bread machine- SO good.  I kept all the ingredients as is except I cut back on the flour to 3 cups (that is the max capacity for my machine).  I was really worried that less flour would screw up the finished product- I set my machine to bake while I was out of the house- so there was no room for tweaking as the bread was being made.  But guess what? We had a gorgeous loaf of bread.  VERY good.

I used this to make muffalettas for a party, and people raved about it!  The bread was perfect for the sandwiches, soft enough to bite into easily but firm enough to bear the meats, cheeses and olive spread  without falling apart.  And with the help of the bread machine, it's super easy.

This bread was excellent! I followed the instructions exactly, including leaving all of the salt in it. I find things that are skimped on salt are skimped on flavor. Just my opinion. Anyway I let the loaves rise on the baking stone I baked them on. Perfect beautiful loaves with incredible flavor and texture. Definately a keeper!

This is SUPER yummy bread. I especially like the texture from the cornmeal bottom. But the instructions are kind of off. You can just shape the loaves and let them rise directly on the baking sheet. If you try to move them once they've risen you may end up deflating them. Also, I'd recomend slashing them before the final rise after you've shaped the loaves.

I like this bread, it did come out a little dense but all the better for an olive oil and vinegar dip. The crust was perfect, the bread itself had an excellent soft and chewy texture. It wasn't too flavorful but wasn't by any means bad. I will definitly be making this again, perfect accompaniment to any italian dish, esp if dipping the bread in oils! Update: Allow the bread to rise in oven with a pan of hot water resting on lower rack.

The bread tasted good but moving it to the baking sheet causes it to fall flat.  Against my better judgement I followed those instructions and it was flat.  I'll make this again and let it rise on the baking sheet.

This was excellent! I let it rise on the baking sheet so it wasn't moved, and did not add any egg or anything on it. I slashed the top and it helped it rise more. After I cooked it mostly, I let it cool a bit and then cut it halfway through into almost slices, spread garlic butter in it, wrapped it in tin foil and baked it for another 10 min. Ahhhmazing!

I had a lot of fun making this recipe. I added garlic powder, italian seasoning and parsley. I cut it in four pieces and twirled 2 together, making 2 lovely loaves.  The first was devoured in less than 10 minutes, and I had to hide the second one to save for dinner! Thank you!

Several people have complained that this bread was not high enough; I would point out that Italian bread, as we saw during our years in Rome, is NOT very high.  I remember thinking it looke like 'bakery flops' til I got used to it!  This bread is still going strong in my house after years!  Tonight I am taking 6 (SIX) loaves to a family party!  That says it well.

Best bread i've ever made.  Such a simple recipe with fantastic results.  i've had my bread maker for years and used it rarely.  Now i'm making one loaf after another.  i'm having a little trouble keeping the bread from not flatting out while rising.  It's still great though.

Very easy to follow recipe.  Made this to go with some home made ham and potato soup for dinner.  I read some of the other reviews advice about cutting the dough deep, although I think I cut mine loaves too deep!  Never mind, sure they taste the same.  Only thing I did different was to add a cup of water to the bottom of the oven to crisp up the crust.

Skip the egg wash and put an iron skillet filled with hot stones on the lower shelf in the oven. Ten minutes before finish, squirt water on the stones for a better crust...

This was delicious.  Following other reviewers suggestions, I used half all-purpose flour (bleached) and half bread machine flour.  The first time I  decreased the salt to 1 tsp, but I also made it with the 1&1/2 tsp the recipe called for and it wasn't salty at all.  My only caution is read up on how to "shape loaves" if you've never made bread without the bread machine before.  My first attempts were kind of ugly- but still delicious- because I didn't know a thing about that step.  I'll use this recipe again and again, thanks!

Wow!  I can'believe I actually made French Bread!  This recipe was so easy!  I'll admit confusion over the diretion to 'place seam side down'.  Yes, I'm that much of a bread novice!  I know now that to form the loaf you fold the ends up and the sides up to meet down the middle.  These 'seams' are placed down.  These loaves were beautiful and delicious.  Highly recommended.

My husband says it's as good as the bread from the best Italian bakery in our hometown!  To avoid making the bread dense, I used 1/2 all-purpose and 1/2 bread flour.  While the bread was being kneaded by the machine, I added 1 tsp at a time of warm milk.  Total came to 1/4 C, but I live in a dry climate.  The dough came out light and had a beautiful elasticity.  The finished product is heaven!

This bread is fantastic!  The flavor and texture is the same as the local Italian bread bakery.  I shaped the loaves and put them on my baking sheet with parchment paper eliminating the need for the cornmeal.  I also found that by making the slice down the length before rising seemed to work better than right before baking the loaves.  Since I keep my house cooler, I let them rise about 1 1/2 hours giving me larger less dense loaves of bread.  My entire family loved this bread and I will be making it often.

LOVE!!! This is the ONLY recipe I use for Italian bread. After trying a few other ones nothing compares to this one. I make it plain, or throw in some garlic powder, parsley and oregano. I like to use it for grilled cheese samis but have to bake 2 because the 1st loaf gets devoured by my family topped with butter and honey. Must try!!!

Very good bread.  Easy to do.  I only needed 3 2/3 cup of flour.  The inside texture of this bread is incredibly soft.  The crust is nice as well.  Thanks for posting it.

This turned out great! I used my breadmachine, following the directions listed with one exception. I used bread flour rather than all purpose flour. I made a mistake when measuring out my yeast too (pregnancy brain) but it still turned out great! 

I have a second batch in the breadmaker now with all purpose flour, the right amount of yeast and I threw in 2tsp of vital wheat gluten in.  I'm sure this batch will turn out great as well! 

The crust is a nice brown after using the egg wash as stated and the taste was great! These loaves will be coming with us to my Mothers house tonight for Christmas Eve's feast of the 7 fishes. I'm sure it will be a hit!

Made this to go with chicken parm, pasta and salad and it delicious and so easy!!  I put mine in two loaf pans and let them rise for the 40 minutes and then just brushed olive oil on top and baked them.  I can't say enough about this bread and how good it is!  It's great toasted as well for breakfast!

I am rating this in two phases, for ease, I rate it a five. I did have to add more water since the dough was quite crumbly. Also I used honey instead of brown sugar since I didn't have any. I used two bread  pans instead of free form loaf. Instead of using a damp cloth, I used two plastic grocery bags to cover the dough, the bags fit perfect and does not touch the dough. I will come back and tell you how the loaves turned out.

I am new at cooking, but followed recipe and it turned out wonderful. I did use bread pans. AS suggested, I used 1 teaspoon of salt, 7 ice cubes in a pan below bread pans.

Very nice flavor.  I dont have alot of bread baking experience and this was easy enough.  I followed the recipe, and I resisted the urge to add Italian Seasoning as I was going to serve it with Pasta e Fagioli a la Chez Ivano from this site, and I knew that was going to be full of the seasonings so I didnt want to over do it.  On techinque however, I did make a change.  I let the bread rise on the stone that I baked them on.  So glad I did.  I dont know how in the world I would have transferred it.  I was trying to work fast with the egg wash and it was starting to spread out, so I can't imagine what would have happened if I moved it.  I meant to add a pan of ice to the oven but forgot.  Great recipe, even for a beginner.  Thanks for sharing!

fantastic bread! This is the first time bread actually worked out for me. I never like the way my bread machine cooked the bread into a cube shaped loaf. It just isnt the same as baked in the oven. I let my bread rise on the pan that i cooked it on so i did not have to move it. Made a batch today and will make another tomorrow. Delicious.

I used the basic parts of this recipe to make an italian bread dough in the machine (then hand shaped, placed in a peforated bread pan, and baked in the oven). The changes: I used about 3 cups of European flour and 1 cup of Ancient Grains flour from King Arthur Flour. I added vital wheat gluten. I increased the water to about 1 1/2 cups (due to the flour I was using) and I also added 1/3 cup grated parmesan romano cheese. I didn't use cornmeal as I didn't have to "slide" the bread dough onto anything as I did the second rise directly in the perforated french loaf pan. I did use the egg and water wash. I baked until the loaves were golden brown and 190 degrees farenheit. I actually had a soft crust (which was fabulous). I've been making a lot of crusty artisan bread and my husband wanted a soft crust bread. The kids loved it too, so much they actually ate the left over bread the next day !!! I imagine this loaf would have intended to be "crusty" because it is an italian bread, but my family just raved how wonderful it was. With the differences in flour, extra water, entire egg wash (not egg white only), and the fact that I covered the bread with a piece of aluminum foil before it became "too brown;" were probable contributors to my soft crust. However, I was not disappointed in the least and will definately make this bread again !!! Thanks for the posting.

I thought it would be perfect given the reviews, but it was very very bland.  My husband said it tasted like pizza dough.  If you do attempt and realize the same thing, I made some garlic rosemary oil to dip it in which gave it a little flavor.  Way too bland and dense.  Will NOT try again.  I didnt transfer to the baking sheet-- I let it rise on the stone.

Oh my gosh! So good! I am so happy with this... 'cept it's not gonna be so good for my figure to eat the incredible amount of it that I want to! I had no cornmeal so let it rise on the greased cookie sheet. Next time I'm trying the pan of ice cubes thing and see what it does though this was incredible!

Italian bread does not, I repeat, does not get any better than this. Don't have a bread machine, so I put all the ingredients in a bowl, mixed it by hand, and ended up with the best rolls. Shaped into 4 rolls. You gotta try this :)

I wish there were more than 5 stars!  I don't have a bread machine, so I combined the warm water, brown sugar and yeast and let it get foamy (about 10 min) then added the oil, flour and salt.  I kneaded it in my Kitchen Aid for about 5 min and let it rise about an hour.  It made a really nice, soft dough - great to work with!  VERY good!

Excellent recipe.  I actually made 5 small round loaves of bread and then hollowed each one out when they were cooked.  Brushed inside of bread with olive oil and garlic mixture and cooked for another 15 minutes.  I then used them as bread bowls for Potato Soup.  Really easy recipe and everyone LOVED the bread bowls!

I made this tonight.  It looks positively perfect.  It was simple, did it in the breadmaker, took it out and moulded it into a loaf, sprinkled a  parchment papered cookie sheet with corn meal, and placed the dough on top.  It rose for about 1-1/2 hrs., I basted it with the eggwash, after I sliced it down the center, and I only made one large loaf.  I did cook it for 35 mins., it was hollow sounding, just like the recipe said.  I have eaten a slice (couldn't help myself), it is denser than an Italian loaf, but delicious nonetheless.  It does soften up when it cools, doesn't stay rock hard on the outside like bakery bought loafs, but all in all, a wonderful replacement for store bought bread, you know how much fat is in it, and really what you are eating.  I have had that breadmaker in my basement for a couple of years now, and while wandering through this website today I decided I had time (how easy is this), and so I made it.  Just the two of us now, we eat less bread, because I'm not out shopping daily for groceries, so I must try other recipes, preferably ones with grains in them.  Just wondering if there is a way to make this recipe into rolls.  I may try.

This recipe is great!  Seeing that I'm cooking for 2, I cut the dough into thirds.  After shaping into loaves, I wrapped two in plastic wrap and frooze them and cooked one for dinner to have with the meatballs I cooked earlier.  Enjoy!

This came out better than any Italian bread I've made, bread machine or hand-kneaded.  It still wasn't what I was wanting.  The inside was soft and fluffy but too much like Wonder Bread.  The crust was nice and crunchy but I was expecting crisp and flaky since I put the tray of ice cubes in the oven.   I'm terrible at making bread so I still gave this 4 stars.   The one that comes out the best is one I found on a blog about frugality, it is not kneaded at all but left overnight, then cooked in a pre-heated cast-iron pot with a lid.  It's FANTASTIC and comes out perfect every time.   I am going to try this one again, though and see if I can get it to come out how I want it since it was SO close and good! Thanks for the recipe!

Was running low on olive oil and brown sugar so I replaced with walnut oil and molasses - still worked perfectly!  The true test of a recipe - when you can substitute ingredients and still get a great product.  I read one comment about it not rising - I'm betting you wound up buying old yeast.  You have to check the exp date on those packets before buying them.  I've had my fair share of dissappointment from using old yeast.  :-)

Worse bread I ever made, probably something I did. But followed the recipe exactly.  Bread came out heavy, to flat, and the inside was a gray color, very dense.  Of well back to the italian bakery.

This is an incredible recipe. I have made it twice now with perfect results both times. I rolled it out into an oval on the floured counter-top and then rolled it up into one long oval loaf and the result is a fantastic, light airy bread with just the right amount of saltiness. I did, however, skip the eggwash part and instead rubbed the top down with a cold stick of butter immediately after taking it out of the oven. The whole family gobbles it right up. Love it!
edit: I should add that I let it proof directly on a greased baking sheet so I wouldn't have to move it.

I am so impressed w/ this recipe.  What a great tasting, dense bread.  I reduced salt to 1 tsp b/c my bread doesn't rise very well if I put anymore than that in.  I increased the olive oil to 1 Tbsp.  I wasn't sure if 1 1/2 tsp was going to be enough, since all bread recipes I've come across have asked for 1-2 Tbsp oil.  I also had to add 1 Tbsp of water as the machine was mixing b/c there was a bit of flour at the bottom that just wasn't mixing in to the dough.  The recipe made 2 wonderful loaves.  I forgot to put the egg wash on, but it still turned out great.  I cut one open and used it for garlic bread (made garlic butter spread).  It was terrific w/ my spaghetti and meatballs.  I found a new garlic bread!  Thanks for the amazing recipe!  PLEASE TRY THIS RECIPE...it really is terrific.

This bread was perfect!!  I made one large loaf instead of two smaller ones, and sprinkled on a few sesame seeds before baking.  My 6-year old gave it "25 stars!!"

OK, I LOVED this recipe, and have made this several times. Turned out perfect every time! However, for some weird reason the recipe has been changed to say it only calls for 1 tablespoon water to the entire 4 cups of flour. I'm soooooo sad that I don't remember how much water it is supposed to call for... I'm hoping it will get corrected so we can all enjoy this fabulous recipe again!

I have been using this recipe for a couple of years.  My family loves it!  My husband is of Italian decent and we can never find true Italian bread hard on the outside yet soft inside this simple recipe does that, so happy baking.

We love this bread!  I've been trying to make an Italian bread similar to the loaves we remember from an Italian bakery in Portland, Maine, where my Italian grandparents lived.  This recipe is pretty much spot on.  Great chewy crust and an inside with great flavor and texture.  I bought a bread lame and am trying to get the scoring down right.  Will definitely make this again and again, thank you!

I am just learning to make bread and always use the machine and then into the oven. The bread was nice and fluffy inside with a heavy crust outside. Perfect for making a large sub and cutting it up to share. once out of the machine, I formed it into 2 long loaves then covered in egg and cornstarch. Buy putting it on the parchment paper and sheet, I didnt have to move it again once it had risen. 
I would like to see some suggestions on how to store it right out of the oven. I left mine out on the counter overnight and it was just as good.

This is best bread I have ever made.  Loved it.  This totally changes everything.  I was intrigued by all the positive feedback on this recipe. It WAS excellent. I took in some of the suggestions: I cut the salt to 1 tsp, I let the bread rise on my parchment covered stoneware sheet, I did brush the top with the egg wash and I did cut the bread lengthwise, I did not cook in bread machine I made two loafs and cooked in over cam out so so good.

I have tried this recipe several times and I always liked the flavor, but something wasn't right. The last time I used 2 and 1/2 teaspoons of yeast instead of the 2 and 1/4 teaspoons and I separated the dough equally and shaped them into loaves. I placed them into two greased loaf pans and let them rise for ONE AND A HALF HOURS instead of 40 min. This made all the difference! It was so much lighter and fluffier. The bread before was so dense. It is saltier than some other breads but I liked it that way, but if you don't like salty, I would suggest cutting it down to 1 teaspoon like  others have suggested. I think if you are just going to make a loaf without a pan you should make it one large loaf instead of 2 smaller ones and adjust cooking time because when you make 2 loaves they are very small, even in a loaf pan it barely rises past the top. I also stopped cutting the top, I don't think it has much effect on the bread and mine never looked good ;) As for the egg wash, I kept it because I feel it makes the top much crustier  I did find more success with a deeper brown/more attractive crust with an egg yolk wash instead of a whole egg wash. If you hate to waste, just make yourself some scrambled egg white to put on a sandwich with your yummy homemade bread!

I made it exactly as the recipe calls for and it turned out delicious! Next time I'd like to make one large loaf though, instead of two small loaves.

Amazing! I will never buy store bought italian bread again! This was soo good. The whole family loved it. Even my 2 year old who is a hit or miss even when I have to bribe with ice cream half the time to eat his supper, he ate his Vegetable Barley Soup just so he could get some more bread! We tried the Beaker's Vegetable Barley Soup on this site with this bread.

Amazing bread! I decided to make this because someone had posted in the 'buzz' that hers turned out dense and seeked for help. After reading a few reviews, I used half bread flour half all-purpose flour and cut the salt down to 1 teaspoon.   I had used the bread machine for the kneading part only (20min) and rised the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, covered with a damp towel  inside the oven with lights on. Since the house was cold, I turned on the warm setting (boost the heat) until it starts to warm up but not too warm. Then turned it off. It doubled in 30 minutes. Thought that was awesome because
normally I let dough rise way longer than that. After shaping it, I placed in a baking pan which I smeared with teensy bit of oil, dusted cornmeal, and covered with a damp towel then placed it in the oven.  The bread was soo soft with slightly chewy crust just like the convenient store.

This is THE BEST Italian bread recipe I have ever tried, and I have tried many!   I bake many different types of breads and have been experimenting with different recipes to try to get that crispy crust like the bread from the bakery, without success.  This recipe accomplishes that!  Wonderful crust and dense chewy inside, just like the Italian Bakery!   I added sesame seeds on top and scored the top mmmmmmmm good! Thank-you for ending my search, LOL.

This was really good and so easy it was kind of silly. I will be making this again. I put the cornmeal directly on a cookie sheet and let them rise there and then popped it into the oven. Loaves came off no problem. Thank you so much.

Jeez, friggin' Louise, this is GOOD.  Made exactly as written, just cooked on parchment paper with corn flour sprinkled, so I didn't have to transfer risen loaves.  I took this out of the oven, having already sampled a bit... put some butter on it, brought it into my husband who was shoving an entire piece in his mouth already.  This is tasty.  Easy as pie, using the bread machine to do all the hard work for me.  I wouldn't change a thing.  One loaf is already gone, and dinner isn't even done cooking.  Will be making again, maybe tomorrow.  YUMMY!!!

This was a great recipe. Tasted just like bakery bought italian bread. The only problem I had was that the bread didn't rise as much as i would have liked. However,  this may have been my fault because I think i made the loaves to long. Next time I will make them shorter this way they have more height.

356 reviews and only 4.5 stars?  Who ever didn't rate this 5 stars did something wrong.  This is an excellent recipe and I've made it several times.  Every time was simply and the bread turned out perfect.  I'm cooking it for a pasta dinner I have planned for my mother in law tomorrow.  Now THAT must say alot!  If you're looking for a good italian bread this one is it.

I have made this twice and it is excellent.  I also let the dough rise on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Makes a beautiful loaf with little effort.  Bread also stays fresh longer than most homemade loaves.

I did NOT use a bread machine.  I used my Kitchen Aid stand mixer with dough hook.  Also, after the first rising, I just formed the loafs and placed them on a corn meal covered cookie sheet.  Bread turned out WONDERFULLY!  I will make again in the future!

The bread is good.  Many people are complaining that it is not what you find in a bakery, well you are not baking in a bakery you are in your kitchen using a bread maker.  I put a pan of boiling water on the bottom rack and baked each loaf separate ( I don't know if that made any difference in the crust ) & the crust came out very nice.  So for a quick recipe for sandwich bread (which is what I used it for) it is fine.  One loaf I dusted with rosemary and garlic it was good.  I will make again when I need a quick loaf for a stew or garlic bread or sandwiches etc.

Amazing recipe! The only change I made was to let my bread rise on my baking pan.  I made it the first time yesterday, and again today by request.  I really appreciate the ingredients were standards that most kitchen already have.  I love how professional and artistic the loaf can look with every little effort.

Exceptionally good recipe. Making again today and added some diced garlic, dried basil and grated parmesan cheese to the bread maker. Looking forward to more great homemade bread.

There's something missing with this recipe.  When you cover with a damp cloth, the cloth WILL stick.  When you carefully try to remove the cloth, the bread WILL deflate.  I had to re-knead, re-rise and then bake.  Came out kinda flat.  That would be okay, but the taste just wasn't all that good.  Maybe needs more yeast or something?  I don't know.  Probably won't make again.

I reduce the salt to 1teaspoon. I also added some chopped or crushed rosemary  to the mix. It adds such a great flavor. Just a dash, it can be over powering. Be careful.

The flavor wasn't bad, but the bread came out very, very heavy and dense. Also, moving the bread from a cutting board to a baking sheet caused a little deflation. I find this to be an unnecessary step. It should simply rise on the baking sheet.

Used two cups whole wheat flour and two cups unbleached all purpose. Other than that I followed recipe. These were really good dense loaves, I just wish I would have let them rise on the pan I baked them on. My loaves fell during transfer. I baked these on a stone and threw two cups of water on the bottom on my electric oven to make the crust chewy. The flavor and texture were great.  I used one loaf to make garlic bread and french toast for the other. This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent recipe!  I'm reviewing after the second time in a week that I've used this recipe.  I have followed the recommendations by others and only used 1tsp of salt.  I use unbleached all purpose flour as well.  This recipe is forgiving as well, and you can allow for 1 or two rise sets depending on your time constraints.  A perfect starter recipe for someone who's never used a bread machine before!  All in all a fantastic recipe, and I'm wondering if I'll ever buy vienna or italian bread again!

Awesome bread!  This recipe cannot be improved.  Like other reviewers, I used 1 tsp of salt and put the loaves on parchment paper on top of my baking stone.  I wish I could give this more than 5 stars.

After shaping, I let my loaves rest on an oiled baking sheet. I slitted the top before I let them rest. I covered them, and then left the house for a couple of hours. When I came back my loves were HUGE! I baked them and they came out perfect!! They look better than the ready made loaves from Publix..lol. Yippee! 5 stars!

Followed the instructions.  Bread stuck to bottom of the baking sheet.  Will grease it and use cornmeal just in case next time.  Was not as wonderful as other reviewers raved about.  It was missing something that the store bought bread has. **Note cut deeply.  My bread rose in the oven and the slit closed on itself.  If you think you cut too deep you might still not have cut deep enough.

Used all bread flour.  The dough was an excellent texture and very easy to shape into loaves.  After the bread was shaped, put it directly on sheet pan.  Not coordinated enough to slide onto a pan after rising.

The best Italian bread I have ever made.  Definitely add sesame seeds for added taste, but do not alter the original recipe at all.  Perfectly dense, slightly sweet, moist on the inside and crusty on the outside.  The only alteration I made was to bake at 400 for the first ten minutes with steam and then reduce temp to 375 and remove the steam to finish.  Perfect warm or cold.  I love this bread!

My bread machine makes 1 pound loaves, so I cut the recipe in half for all ingredients, except I used 1 Tbsp. olive oil.  I skipped the cornmeal and egg coating entirely and just cooked it in the bread machine.  I cooked it on the regular/soft crust cycle - it comes out perfect!  This bread is great for grilled cheese sandwiches.

Super Easy and relatively quick.  I can't believe how nice this turned out for my first try at baking bread!  I use my bread machine for making cinnamon roll dough and pizza dough, but this was my first try with actual bread  Next time I may try to make one large sized loaf like they do in the stores, but it was super easy and wonderful fresh out of the oven.    I put the dough on parchment paper with the cornmeal and then right in the oven...baked wonderfully!

Crusty and delicious.  Very easy to make in the Bread Machine.  I think I'll be increasing the salt just a tad next time though.

I make homemade bread alot and this is one of the best tasting, easiest breads I 've ever made. My kids devour it.  Tip, since I start it in the bread machine, I give it an extra rise before baking to intensify the flavor.

This is awesome bread.  I made it exactly as directed and about four times so far.  Each time it's come out flawless.  A few times I added sea salt to the top of the loaves to give it a little kick.

I've done so much with these bread: plain with spaghetti dinner, fresh garlic bread, eggplant parm sandwiches and Italian bread pizza. Yum!  This recipe is now a standard in my home.

Since getting this recipes a few weeks ago, I have made this bread 5 times. It is delicious! Very easy, and absolutely wonderful wit soups, for sandwiches, and just alone. Each time I've made this I've let the bread rise on my pizza stone in a warm oven...it seems to rise quicker that way. I then brushed it with the egg/water and baked it - still on the pizza stone.  Perfect!

THIS RECIPIE IS VERY DELICIOUS.  WHEN I MAKE THIS I USE HALF FOR 1 LOAF AND THE OTHER I MAKE A GARLIC BUTTER PULL APART RING.  ONE THING I FOUND USEFUL WAS TO LET THEM RISE ON THE PAN I BAKE ON AND GIVE THEM A FEW SLITS IN THE TOP BEFOR THEY RISE AND PERFCT I DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THEM STICKIG OR SINKING AT ALL.

I was put in charge of bringing bread to a dinner party and i thought it would be a treat to bring homemade.  I had a box mix on hand thinking I wouldn't have good luck with this.  They were incredible and both loaves barely made it around the table.  Perfect crust and light and airy on the inside.   Can't wait to make it again!

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for...Italian bread like you can buy from the bakery at a grocery store.  It came out really well the first time I made it!  I took another reviewer's suggestion and let the bread rise on my pizza stone and let it bake on that in the oven so I didn't have to try to move the bread onto the pan after it had risen.

This is a great recipe. My son and husband loved it. In fact, my son had it toasted this morning for breakfast and it is just as good today as it was yesterday. The only thing I did different was instead of making two loaves, I just made it into one big loaf. I had to bake it alittle longer because I like my bread browner that what the recipes called for.This is a keeper!!!!!!!

Great bread! I also made the dough with my stand mixer and dough hook attachment and let the dough rise for about an hour near my oven.

This bread is much better than the Italian bread I've bought in the stores! Its texture is perfect--soft with a chewy crust. I'll definitely make this one again.

Oh my gosh!  This is the BEST Italian bread I have ever tasted! My first try didn't rise very well.  The loaves were tasty, but small.  On the second try I added the salt with the liquids instead of with the dry ingredients because I have heard that salt can kill the yeast.  I also added 2 Tbs. water and 1 Tbs. gluten, and shaped the dough into one large loaf instead of two smaller ones and sprinkled sesame seeds on top.  This was just incredibly good! I will be making this bread every week, and will probably make extras to give to the neighbors.

My machine gets a lot of use but I never used it to make the dough and then bake in the oven.  My bread baking is limited to the machine only.  This was fabulous.  I'm Italian/American and grew up eating italian bread while many were eating Wonder.  This is a keeper.

Great bread and easy to do.  Instead of regular olive oil, I used a roasted garlic infused olive oil.  Really a great taste.

Excellent! I tried one of the other suggestions using wheat gluten. I don't have a bread machine, did it with mixer. Turned out beautifully. My husband has banished me from the bakery!

I've made this a few times before and it has turned out wonderful, but each time I had accidentally added the egg into the dough ingredients. This time, I remembered to leave it out because it's only for the egg wash. The dough turned out super tough and unworkable. I rolled it out (with much difficulty) into a single, vaguely rectangular shape and rolled it into a loaf-like structure, but next time I will (intentionally) include the egg into the dough and maybe just save a little of the white for the egg wash. Had to give it one star because as written, it is terrible.

This recipie worked great i think bread flour is a must have, all purpose just doesn't do the same. It turned out perfect. Dont get the water too hot, it kills the yeast. Use cold to luke warm , and let the bread machine do the work. Then rise loaves in a warm place thats not too hot as well. 80 to 90 degrees.

Delicious! I will absolutely make again! I did make a few suggested changes from other reviewers -- I did half bread flour and half all-purpose flour, and I put the corn meal directly on the baking pan and let the loaves rise there. I don't think it is too salty at all. We ate one loaf plain and made garlic bread with the other. I'm a newbie bread maker and this was super easy!

Instead of making 2 loaves, we ended up making 9 Italian rolls so we could do Meatball Parm's last night. The bread came out great by just following the recipe.

I feel a little badly rating this bread at only four stars. I used bread flour, as suggested by other reviewers, and my bread turned out craggy and a little dry. The taste was good and the crumb was decent, but I will have to try this recipe again with AP flour to see if that changes the problems I had. I made no other alterations other than the flour.

I've made this recipe several times and have made the following minor changes. I used 3 cups of AP flour and 1 cup of bread flour. Also added a tablespoon of vital wheat gluten. I made one large loaf instead of splitting into two and cut it crossways for more crunch. Finally, after brushing with the egg mixture, I sprinkled sesame seeds, a pinch of kosher salt, and a mix of garlic powder and Italian herbs on top. I won't change another thing. It's perfect.

This was wonderful!  (I used half bread flour and half all-purpose.)  The texture was nice and soft inside, slightly crisper, chewier crust.  My son said this was his favorite, of all the breads I've ever made!

Just made this most excellent French bread.  Did everything according to the recipe, only I did not raise dough on separate cutting board, I raised on the baking sheet.  This is the best recipe, I can't wait to try it with some Italian spices, that some have suggested.  The crust is so nice and crunchy, my husband loved this...thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

i really liked this bread - I, like other reviewers, used half AP and half bread flour.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to do the slice/cut before the final rise.  After my bread had risen (and it was beautiful) I did the cut and lost all my beautiful rise.  Oh and there was no reason to rise it on a cutting board and then move it to a baking sheet.  Just rise it on the baking sheet.  I also read a tip recently to use semolina flour vs. corn meal so you don't have the uncooked cornmeal on the bottom of the bread.  (I haven't done this because I don't keep semolina flour in my cupboard!!)

This recipe is perfect (but I used bread flour).  I waited until the last 15 minutes and added shredded asiago cheese to one of the loaves (see my photo). Also, I always pre-heat my oven to 150 degrees for 10 minutes and the let the bread rise in an oven with the door cracked and let it raise for at least 50 minutes. I also use a sil-pat style mat rather than cornmeal or a baking stone. I think the bread is more consistent this way.

This simple recipe worked fantastically for me.  Per the recipe I used only AP flour, would probably do 50/50 AP and bread next time, but really not an issue.  The egg wash gives it a fantastic shiny crust, with the cut allowing a nice amount of rise as it cooks.  I actually formed a single 12" long loaf out of it for garlic/sandwich bread and also doubled the olive oil to 1 T. for a bit more flavor.  Also just let it rise right on the baking sheet so no moving.  The cut did deflate it a bit, but no worries, right back up in the oven.

Wow. I make this all the time now.  It is completely delicious and makes the house smell fantastic.  I cut the salt.  I have used all-purpose flower and bread flower and a mix.  Great all the time.  Give it a try!  Thank you for the recipe.

Great bread!   I used bread flour, and baked in my long perforated italian bread pans....looked and tasted like they came from the bakery!   Also, I misted the loaves and the oven 3 times at the beginning of the bake (mist all over, close the door, wait a minute, repeat) to get the steamed crust effect.   35 minutes was perfect.

I love tis recipe!  I kept thinking they left out some steps it was sooo  easy.  I did proof the yeast and added the other ingredients except flour and salt.  I put the liduid in the bottom of the bowl and then dry on top.  Worked like a dream.  I recommend this to everyone.

I just made this. It is DELICIOUS!!! Perfect Italian bread! I also added sesame seeds. Mmm  hot out of the oven with fresh butter. Just right! Thank you! I will make this again. And I did make it in my bread machine putting the ingredients in order of my instruction book! I will use this to make French Toast tomorrow for breakfast.

Great recipe.  The only changed I made was I used Bread Flour instread of regular and it worked like a charm.  I also kept the bread in the machine for the full dough cycle but had to lift the lid as the rose to the top.   Only problem I had was that when I lift the damp tea towel one of the loafs had stuck to it.  Next time will not use the towel.

I loved this bread, I had to use 2 cups of water because I mixed it in my kitchen aid, and 1 and 1/3 wasn't enough.
Great taste, great crust, moist inside too.
Easy to make for such a great result. Thanks for sharing.

So delicious and so easy! My family gobbles this up! I sometimes make a meal out of it by putting cheese and pepperoni or ham slices on top of it and then rolling it up and baking the bread, then slicing into spirals.

This is a great recipe! I have a One Loaf Bread Machine.  I had to play w/the recipe in order to get it just right.  I set my bread machine on the Dough cycle (1 hr. & 45 mins.) I don't use the egg.  I don't cut the top w/a razor.  I let my bread rise on the cookie sheet on cornmeal for 1 hr.  I preheat my oven for at least 15 mins., then I bake the loaf in the oven for 30 mins.  Best bread recipe for a bread machine. I laud and applaud the creator of this recipe.

This turned out very well. I wish I had read some of the comments before trying it and let it rise on the baking sheet instead of the cutting board; one of the loaves deflatted somewhat when I moved them to the sheet. But otherwise it turned out very tasty!

This recipe is perfect, no changes needed.  Look no further!  I made without a bread machine.  I mixed the yeast and brown sugar, then added the warm water.  Put 2 cups flour in bowl, add yeast mixture, stir well with spoon.  Then add 2 more cups flour, and fold in with your hands.  Let rest til double in size, then shape into loaves.  The egg/water mixture makes the perfect topping, and if you want to season with oregano and parm cheese, it sticks on great!  I did that and made subs with it.  So good!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very good bread.  It's a lot easier to eliminate the cutting board and form the loaves on the baking sheet, sprinkled with cornmeal.  No transfer necessary after rising, and the risen loaves don't get shaken down trying to transfer them from the board to the baking sheet.

I halved the recipe and made one loaf. I was very happy with how the bread turned out. As others mentioned, it is a dense bread, but still yummy. The small amount left over did not keep well though. It was quite hard the following morning even though I had wrapped it up overnight. Would make good french toast though.

I used 3 cups of bread flour.  I did NOT cut back on salt, I did reduce by half the brown sugar.  The bread came out perfect. nice crust nice chewy dough.  I made 1 loaf and cooked it 40 min. I sprayed my bread twice with water.

I have used this recipe many times now and it is the best Italian bread using a bread machine that I have found. Depending on the flour you use the water does need minor adjustments. Takes a few tries to get it right. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very easy and yummy! 
Instead of separating into two loaves I made one big one and cooked it for an extra 5 mins. Also just before I took it out of the oven I brushed some olive oil on the open part of the top (the part that I scored after brushing on the egg) and sprinkled it with rock salt. Yum!

Absolutely has to be the easiest, best recipe for Italian bread. I have been trying to make a decent bread for years, usually failing miserably. I had resigned myself to the idea that I just am not a bread baker, but decided to give this a try to go with a batch of crock-pot chili. My oh MY! This was soooo easy and turned out wonderfully, nice and soft inside with a superb crust. The only thing I did different than the recipe was proofing the yeast first, letting the dough rise on my pizza stone instead of having to deal with a transfer, and skipped the egg wash (I was afraid of collapsing the rise, as is usually my problem). It baked 35 min on the dot, perfect loaves! Next time, I'll just keep it as one loaf instead of cutting into 2, as both loaves were gone by the end of dinner. I will never buy Italian bread again! Thanks Destiny!

For such a simple recipe, this bread is outstanding. I follow the recipe exactly, but shape the loaves and proof/bake them in a baguette baking pan with twin loaves. WOW! The bottoms of the loaves are dimpled, so the bread looks like it came from a professional bakery. First time I made these, I had a cold, and couldn't really taste the bread. I told my 13-year-old, and he said, "You don't know what you're missing." He was right!

Awesome tasting!  I added a tsp of Italian seasoning to the dough.  I proofed the yeist for 10 mins in the water & sugar.  I then added the rest of the ingredients.  I mixed by hand & let it rise for an hour.  Then I turned out the dough and let it rise in a greased bread pan.  I cooked with a tray of water in the oven for 30 mins.  It was done to perfection.

Wonderful bread. This recipe was exactly what I wanted. Something that used the machine for the dough, but the oven for cooking.

I did use the 1 tsp of salt and I did let it rise on the bread pans I had.

I used bread flour and it was lighter then I was expecting. Will use 50/50 bread/apf next time.

Also this dough is going to be perfect for a bread roll I make with meat and cheese inside.

Excellent recipe. I did make one change in the ingredients, I used honey instead of the brown sugar. I made one large loaf and shared with my neighbor. Easy to make and it raised perfectly. Thanks for sharing.

My bread didn't rise very much but the taste was good. I will retry with a little more yeast to see if that helps. If second bread raises better I will rerate again.

This is a fantastic bread recipe. So easy to make in the bread maker and then in the oven. I will make this recipe again and again. Next time I will make little round loaves and serve soup in a bread bowl! Fail~proof.

I used this bread to make pizza bread.  Pat 1/2 of dough into 9x15" rectangle, spread with italian tomato paste sm can leaving 1/2" border around for sealing. Sprinkle generous not too much of pizza toppings (pepperoni, or sausage, cheese, cooked veggies) wet the border with water, then with the short side facing you fold like a letter...1/3 into the center, then stretch the remaining 1/3 to cover that, pinch to seal the ends and side.  Brush with melted butter and bake at 350 untill golden about 30 minutes.  We love this and it's great for lunch or slice thin for snacks.

I use my bread machine very regularly, especially in the winter, so I have accumulated many recipes; this  one is excellent. I have other recipes using the bread machine from beginning to end, but this one is so easy and the results are so perfect, it's worth the extra minutes to complete by hand since the machine does all the hard work. The soft density of this bread with its shiny, slightly crisp crust is better than store bought. I am making it again today since everyone ate it all on Saturday with their lasagna. I did use bread flour, out of habit I guess, but it's good to know all-purpose can also be used. Thanks for this recipe!

This bread is really good. I did make a few changes, however; I added Italian seasoning along with a little garlic and onion powder. I also omitted the egg wash. Will definitely make this again.

Ok, I know I don't need to review this, since it's gotten so many great reviews, but I had to add my 2 cents. This was outstanding!! I added some sesame seeds on top after brushing on the egg wash, and it knocked my socks off. Was waiting for hubby to get home, but had to try it as soon as it came out of the oven.   Thank you so much for the fantastic recipe. I haven't had anything this authentically Italian since visiting family in Italy. xoxo

This is by far the best bread machine bread ever!  I ran out of white flour, so I used wheat and it turned out awesome!  I also put cheddar cheese and garlic on top.  I let it rise on the dryer that was going and it rose in 20 minutes!  I made it with the baked potato soup in this forum!  THANK YOU

Excellent!  I made this as directed, except that I just dusted the baking sheet with cornmeal and let the bread rise on that, then baked.  I formed the dough into six smaller hoagie/sub rolls.  Thanks for sharing!

I used 1 cup of wheat flour to get it in the recipe and should not have done this. I ended up with a denser, flatter, bread.

I wasn't happy with this recipe at all, not what i would call an Italian bread.. Also oiled cling wrap need to go over the dough rather than just a damp cloth as the dough sticks to the cloth

WOW! If I could give this more than 5 stars I would! I never imagined that I could make such a delicious loaf of italian bread...this is better then my favorite italian bread from the local bakery! I made this exactly as written and would not change a thing. I shaped one loaf regular and braided the second loaf. This is my new go-to bread recipe! Thanks for sharing. :)

Absolutely the best bread I have ever made, I took the advice of others and let the dough rise on the baking pan, I first lined the pan with parchment paper. My loaves were finished in about 20-22 minutes. This bread beats any store bought or bakery bread.

Wow!  Baked this to finish right on time with my Pasta.  It was fabulous!  I did 2C of each Bread Flour and AP.  I also did what some reviewers said and just used a "rounded" tsp of salt.  Dough Cycle on my bread machine, then split and formed onto parchment paper (no corn meal).  It's the next day now, and the bread has firmed up just the slightest amount, making it great for a sandwich and dipping in some olive oil.  Thanks!

I was happily stunned at how great this bread came out.  It was just like bread from the best local NY bakery.  A tip:  I baked mine on a pizza stone in the oven and I think that it made a huge difference.  Wonderful recipe.......

This was really good.  I used 2 cups bread flour and 2 cups all purpose flour.  I skipped the cornmeal.  I made rolls and froze half before the second rise.  These are great!  Also good if you sprinkle some garlic powder on them before baking.

Wonderful! Hubby raved about the flavor... a true italian bread, nice and dense not too fluffy.  I would recommend as others have suggested to make one loaf rather than two. They did not rise enough to make two significant loaves, and I think would be better as one... will try that next time!

This recipe was so ridiculously easy and the bread is excellent.  We just came back from Italy and this is a very good rendition of some of the breads we tasted there, particularly in the northern regions.

Outstanding! I've made 4 loaves in less than 24 hours. Perfect every time and the family raves about it! Camping this weekend and insisted my lasagna not be without this homemade bread!

This is a good recipe, but it seems flawed in a way. Moving the loaves from a cutting board to the baking sheet seems like an extra step and causes the bread to fall a bit. My bread turned out a little on the dense side. Next time I will let it rise on the baking sheets.

The best bread-machine Italian bread ever! I make 3 loaves instead of 2 for nice smaller size servings to go with the main course.

This is just an awesome recipe - and will be added to my very best favourites. I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could. I made it as directed, and it was just as good (if not better) than bakery bread.

This is the BEST bread machine recipe!  Once the dough is ready, I turned onto a floured surface, deflated the dough and formed into 2 loaves.  I placed the loaves onto a baking sheet lined with parchment that I had sprinkled with cornmeal.  I covered with damp towel and let rise 40 mins.  Meanwhile I preheated the oven with a baking stone.  Once the bread had risen, I slid the loaves (with parchment paper) onto the baking stone.  While baking, I misted the loaves with water a couple times early on as this helps to make them crustier.  I also added sesame seeds to 1 after I brushed with egg wash.  Sounds like a lot of work, but really simple and it's definitely worth it!

This recipe is wonderful. The first time I did it, I let it rise too long, and it deflated a bit, so it ended up being dense with a great crumb.   Tonight I made it, and it turned out wonderful. I top mine with coarse sea salt and parmesean cheese.

This was really good and incredibly easy...  the perfect combo in my book!  A lot of the long loaf recipes collapse outward rather than rise up when you get them on the cookie sheet, but these were tall and gorgeous!  I did cheat as others and just let the loaves rise on the cookie sheet covered with a silpat rather than move them.  I was also out of egg for the wash so just used milk and sprinkled with a pinch of salt and some granulated garlic for crunch.  Used a loaf with the herb spread for garlic bread off this site.  Wonderful with chicken cacciatore!  Thanks for the recipe!

This has to be the best Italian bread recipe I have ever tried. Has a nice outer crust and a soft, dense, moist inside. It's so good we use it for making sandwiches.

Love this recipe!  Couldn't be simpler.  Very rarely have leftovers when I serve this.  Haven't bought Italian bread for months.  I always make a recipe as printed first, then sometimes use the various suggestions, just can't mess up this recipe-definitely a keeper-THANKS!!

this breadis wonderful. I did not have bread flour so I used all purpose, added 2 tablespoons of flax seeds to the flour to boost the fibre, and 1 tablespoon of water to the dough in the ABM as it was not mixing together well - a bit dry. but it came out so well, and baked to perfection. I like the suggestion of parchment for the dough to rise on. It is wonderful with just butter, makes great toast and sandwiches...what more can I say, we loves it and will certainly make it again. Oh, making 2 loaves is a great time saver, I froze one for later use. Perfect!!

I made this recipe twice yesterday and neither one turned out as I had hoped. The first time was my fault. Ingredients should always be listed in the order used and most bread machines call for liquids to be added first. I forgot this and ended up putting the water on top. That doesn't work, but it was my fault for forgetting. The second time, the dough seemed OK and rose in the bread machine, but was entirely too sticky to handle when removed and it didn't rise properly the second time. The crust was what I had hoped for and the taste was OK, but the loaves weren't very big.

What can I say? Simply A great recipe. This bread came out tasting wonderful and it was really dense. Not like the bread you buy from the store wich is full of air. Two or three pieces and you almost full. I'll be making more this weekend! Thanks for sharing a real keeper of a recipe.

I made this bread and everyone loved it! I didn't plan on making bread that night and was out of bread flour, but I did have a/p flour--so I thought I would try it anyway.  It was soft on the inside, crusty on the out and very, very tasty just like it should be! I did use 1 tsp salt like some others did. Great recipe!

Wow! You search is over! Definitely the best italian bread recipe I have found! Nice crust and perfectly fluffy inside...I am glad the recipe made 2 because the first one never made it to the table! I did let them rise on the baking sheet so I didn't have to move them...That worked perfectly for me. I will never buy italian bread again! (and my house smells like a bakery!)

I have to say that this is one of the best recipes for Italian bread using a bread machine that I have found.  It is tasty and the crust has just a slight crunch - it is perfect!  It is a staple at our house for dinner.

This bread came out fabulous!!  I followed the recipe, but decreased the salt.  While baking the loaves, I put a cup of ice water in a little dish below the pan, rather than spritzing the loaves with water.   The bread came out with a nice thick and crunchy crust, while the middle was still light and fluffy.

The bread came out looking perfect, and the crust was nice, but the interior was nothing special.  I would make it again b/c it's so easy and looks good, but I will keep looking for a better loaf.

I've done many loaves in the machine, and this is the BEST!  I, too, used all bread flour, I added 1 heaping teaspoon vital wheat gluten, and let it rise on a parchment covered baking sheet, which I oiled the baking sheet and then dusted with cornmeal.  I will say that be careful to cover each loaf with a medium dusting of flour before you cover with a damp cloth, as the cloth stuck right to the loaf!  No big deal, just used a knife to seperate it and then did the egg wash and baked.  BEAUTIFUL!

I have made this recipe twice, both times for family parties. Everyone loved it. The bread machine does a great job mixing the dough. Cooking it in the oven is quick and smells heavenly.

This is a very tasty loaf. Like some of the others, I thought it was a little dense. Will try adding the gluten, extra rise time (50 min.), the half reg. flour and half bread flour,the pan of water under the bread pan in oven and making one large loaf. I'm making spaghetti for Christmas Eve, this will be the bread bread for that meal.

This bread exceeded my expectations. It came out chewy on the outside, soft on the inside, with great flavor. Just like those artisan breads you'd pay $4 a loaf for at the bakery. I also placed a bowl of ice in the bottom of the oven while baking. 30 minutes was perfection. Thanks for the wonderful recipe, this is our new "spaghetti night" bread!!!

I'm one of those cooks that can cook almost anything with good results, but somehow making any type of dough continually challenges me.  This recipe turned out fantastic, as is.  I had no problems with the consistency of the dough--it was perfect when the dough cycle on my bread machine was finished. I used it to make stromboli, with excellent results.  Will use this recipe again and again!

This was just OK in my book.  It lacked flavor.  Maybe needs more salt and brown sugar.  The loaf did bake up nice and had a good texture.  Since I used it for garlic bread it was fine but I wouldn't serve it at the table with just butter, it's just too flavorless.  I would make again b/c cause it was so easy but just for garlic bread.

This recipe has consistently worked well for me. I use it all the time. It's soft and tastes great. Just a note if you're feeling creative, don't try putting too many sesame seeds on it like you see in Italian bakeries. They really overpowered everything. I have to think back to my childhood and remember if that was a heartier bread.

Great recipe that works for even an amateur baker. I don't have a bread machine but the dough is definetely kneadable. I have repeatedly tried making bread before, not from any particular recipe (due to my distrust of recipes--bad brownie experiences), and failed irrevantly. Everytime I baked a bread, I would have to find a way to get rid of my final product (usually by feeding the geese in the park...at times, they rejected my bread). Then I resorted to adding sugar and folding in layers of sweet red bean sauce and such but that was not enough to cover up the taste. Anyways, this italian bread recipe turned out wonderful. I only let the bread rise once in the oven before baking it, which is incorrect. The bread turned out delicious nonetheless. It actually tasted nice, slightly salty and did not need additonal spices to cover up the yeast taste. Great recipe!

My roommates and I love this bread. After baking I slice the bread, spread a melted butter and garlic mixture onto each piece and then wrap the bread in aluminum wrap and put it in the oven at 200 to keep it warm until dinner is served.

Wonderful bread!  I've made this recipe a few times and each time the bread disappears way too fast.  My son can eat an entire loaf in one sitting!

I had great success with this recipe.  As many of the other reviewers mentioned, I also placed the formed loaves onto a cornmeal-covered pizza stone before they rose.  This way the loaves don't "deflate" by moving them onto a separate baking sheet.  Now that we've added this recipe to our family cookbook, we will never need to buy Italian bread again!

This was very flavorful bread with a great crust.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and put the dough on the stone that I was baking it on to begin with so that the transfer would not deflate the bread.  The problem was, when I made the cut, the dough deflated then anyway.  I wonder if I could make the cut before the last 40 minute rising.  Either way, the bread was very flavorful, nice and crusty outside and soft in the middle.  I used a rosemary infused olive oil, fresh cracked pepper and grated parm cheese for a dipping oil, and it was just superb.  Thanks Destiny!

Awesome bread.  Don't write reviews often, but had to, this was so good.  Very easy and everyone loved it.  Substituted one cup of whole wheat flour for one of regular cause I ran out.  Even better!

This bread was easy to make and disappeared quickly.  I wanted to use my new stand mixer to knead it, but it's a little too cold here now, so I used the bread machine for the first rising since it's temperature controlled and kept it in a barely warmed oven for the second rising until it was ready to bake.  (Make sure you take the loaf out to preheat the oven before baking if you do this.)
I made one loaf plain, and the second, I rolled pepperoni and cheese into the dough (cinnamon roll fashion) after taking it out of the machine.  Easy and delicious, I'll be using this recipe again.

I've made this recipe 4 times on both dry and humid days. It tastes great, but always comes out a little too dense. Even small breadsticks come out dense. I really like the taste though, so I'll try to tweak the recipe to get a lighter dough.

Favolosamente splendido!  Fabulously wonderful!  Made two batches one in stand mixer,  just let it rise in bowl with plastic wrap, then continued on.  Set it near my stove to rise while I made home made pasta sauce.  Worked out awesome.  Rolled and shaped it into loaves.  But I placed it straight on the cookie sheet, covered with non-stick foil.  It rose then baked.  Was definatly a delight.  Will add probably an extra 1/2-1 tsp Salt next time.  But definatly worth the effort to make.  Next time I will make just one large two pound loaf for a large dinner though.  I let it rise for a bit longer than the 40 minutes.  Very nice, have been searching for a straight forward excellent Italian bread recipe for a while.  I think I have found it.  Thank you..so much for this.

No more store-bought Italian bread for me!! This was so easy to make and delicious! I never have olive oil, so I use canola oil with no problem. I let the dough rise right on my cornmeal dusted pizza stone. I usually freeze the baked 2nd loaf...and, it keeps its texture and flavor. I wrap the frozen loaf in foil and unthaw in a warm oven...tastes just like freshly baked! Great, easy recipe!!

I made this even though I was concerned it wouldn't have enough flavor.  I was a bit disappointed in the dough, it was very fragile.  When I went to move the loaves from the cutting board to the baking sheet, the loaves fell.  They never rose again.  Next time I make this I'll just let the loaves rest right on the baking sheet.  I'm giving this a 4 star because of the presentation being disappointing.  But the flavor was wonderful, despite it's looks.  Everyone loved it, even my husband who typically could live without the bread.  I'm so pleased with the flavor, this will be a staple in our house on spaghetti nights.  :)

I took the advice of others and kept seperated- the sugar and yeast with the water, and mixed the salt with the flour.  If you don't use salt your bread will taste very bland. I had to add a little more water than the recipe called for also.  It turned out GREAT.
Also a fun thing to do for partys is make two long skinny loaves and cut them in small slices perfect for bite sized dipping in olive oil.

I tried this recipe but I didn’t have any all-purpose flour on hand so I used bread flour, it worked well! Great texture, and great crust. My son as his girl friend gobbled it down. I baked it on a pizza stone and put a pan of water in the bottom of the oven (this is great for Italian bread!) Fact is it came out so good they wanted me to make more. So, thinking I was very smart, I decided to double the recipe and bake four loves at a time. What a disaster! It filled my bread machine up and wouldn’t mix (I thought I broke my machine!) So I dumped it all out into a large bowl and mixed it with my hands, and put it out on a board and kneaded it a few times then let it rise. I warned my kids not to expect too much because I felt like I had reined it. But guess what -- IT TURNED OUT GREAT!

Just had this with our dinner tonight.  Very easy to make.  I forllowed the recipe except I added garlic powder and Italian seasoning and followed the suggestions of others to decrease the amount of salt.  I divided the batch and made 1 large loaf and 5 mini loaves.  They turned out beautiful. I did notice that if you cover the loaves immediately while they are cooling the crust stays soft and chewy.  However, next time I will leave the recommended amount of salt and try it with other add-ins.  We still enjoyed it though.

Destiny, I had great success using this recipe for the first time. I rolled the dough into 20 rolls instead of two loaves, added some italian spices for assist in flavor and I was really pleased. I'll try adding some glutten next time for rolls that are a bit softer. Delicious with our thanksgiving meal. Guests all liked them. Will definitely make again. Chewy and tasty and great with Light Butter, too.

Wonderful recipe. I was looking for a scalia bread recipe and this is the closest I have found.
UPDATE 10/08/06:
At the kneading stage add 1 Tbsp. dried rosemary for great oil dipping bread with an Italian dinner. Awesome!

I just made this bread for the first time. The instructions are simple to follow, and the bread turned out delicious! For a personal touch, I sprinkled on a little thime before putting it into the oven (for appearance). Thanks for the recipe!

I made this bread to go with an Italian sausage and pasta dish; what a great recipe!  I followed the advice of JFresno and deflated the dough right on a baking sheet that was liberally sprinkled with cornmeal, split the dough in half, and then just let the two rounds rise for about 50 minutes. I did use the egg wash, but without the yolk (one egg white and 1 T. water), and sprinkled the rounds with sesame seeds.  They came out of the oven looking like they came home from the bakery.  For left-overs tonight I cut the bread into small but chunky slices, buttered and sprinkled them with garlic salt, and baked for about 15 minutes at 425...crunchy and delicious.  I can't wait to use this bread with bruschetta come summer when fresh tomatoes are available again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This bread is wonderful. I didn't have cornmeal so just used flour on my work surface. I also skipped the topping as I like my bread crusty. Also,I used all bread flour. I also formed the two loaves on a cookie sheet. Didn't bother covering with a towel. This recipe is a winner. No mess at all useing the bread machine.

A little more dense than I had hoped, but still fairly good bread.  The crust had a great texture, and the appearance was satisfactory.

I made this recipe for the first time today (08/29/04).  I would give it 5 stars for easy to make, 5 stars for crunchy crust, 5 stars for texture but only 3 stars for taste.  Too bland.  Although I must mention that my husband and I finished nearly a whole loaf to come to this, too bland, decision.  I am looking forward to modifying by adding some herbs and spices next time.

This bread fell slightly when I was brushing with the egg. This made it slightly heavy, but still okay. IF I make this recipe again, I will give it a longer second rising and omit the egg wash.

This was good but a little heavy.  Maybe I didn't let it rise enough the second time although I did wait the specified amount of time.  I used it for a roasted vegetable sandwich and it was tasty.

Followed the recipe with great results!  Love the bread!  Next time I substituted honey for the brown sugar since that's what I use for our "everyday" bread with great results.  Thank you for the recipe!!

The taste was ok but I think my issue had to do with not noticing that the 'bread machine recipe' called for AP flour and rapid rise yeast and I'm not sure if I should have considered measuring differently when using the bread machine yeast I used versus the RR yeast called for in the recipe. Ultimately, I was one of the bakers whose bread came out super dense and lacked rise. The texture was more like a heavy white loaf than any Italian loaf, even considering the egg wash on the exterior failed to add the crust texture of a good Italian loaf. Not sure if others with the same inferior result made the same mistakes I made with AP flour and yeast.

I've made this several times. I usually split the dough in half to make two loaves. The crust is lightly crispy, the inside is light and heavenly. Excellent toasted. Makes great french toast, grilled cheese croutons. This is a staple, for sure.

Wow this bread is fantastic! Used 1 heaping teaspoon of salt and I didn’t need the entire 4 cups of flour called for.  I don’t own a bread machine but I know how to make bread lol, so don’t let that stop you! This recipe is totally worth it!!!!! Thank you sooooo very much for a new weekly loaf rotation!!!!

I started by making this per the recipe and loved it.

I have switched to just flouring the bottom of the loaves really well before baking, as we didn't love the cornmeal texture. This has worked really well for me.

I also tried skipping the egg wash and regret it! The crust doesn't turn out as golden, flaky, and smooth.

Will make this again! Used the dough cycle on my machine, then shaped and proofed in a warm oven with the door ajar.  Put in a pie plate full of ice cubes into the hot oven and the crust came out wonderfully. 

This recipe made, for me, two small loaves. For sandwich rolls, I will divide the dough into 6. This would make EXCELLENT bread bowls.

Exceptional! Haven't bought store bread for over a year. Used 2c bread/2c white and also 2c white/1c bread/1c whole wheat w/1T vital wheat gluten (upped water by 1T). Both versions great. After final rise in BM, rolled into 2 loaves, put them on parchment lined baguette pans, sprayed with Pam, covered with plastic wrap and let them rise in my oven on bread proof setting for 30 mins. Slashed, basted w/egg and 1T water mix and baked at 375 for 35 mins. Perfection!

I made this recipe twice e so far. The first time I made it into 2 loaves. The second time one. I love this bread...soft, yummy inside and a wonderful chewy Italian crust!
Highly recommend!
Rev: 2nd time I made this was before my am coffee. I realized too late I had put in 1 Tablespoon of oil I stead of the 1 1/2 teaspoons and I had added the egg and into the liquid. It is intended as an egg wash in the original recipe. I still did the egg wash prior to baking. It came out wonderful! I will make the same changes next time I make it. Love this bread!

This makes a really good, heavy bread.  i did find that 1 1/3 C water was not enough.  The dough was so dry it was crumbly.  After several tries, I found the perfect amount is 1 1/2 C.  I cook it on a "pizza stone", which I think makes it more true to the original style of Italian bread.

Great flavor, but dough was too dry. Followed recipe to a tee. I formed the loaves as best as possible, but they were definitely ugly. LOL Next time, I'll decrease the flour to 3 1/2 cups to see if that helps.

This was my first time using my bread machine to make only dough. When the dough was rising, I forgot about it so it sat out about an hour before getting into the oven. It turned out fantastic. I'm happy it was a forgiving recipe. Husband and kids all loved it. This will definitely be made again in my house!

I accidentally did 1 1/2 table spoons of olive oil and it worked out really well actually. My family loves it, we split the dough up for sandwich rolls or just dinner rolls.

The bread turned out wonderful,  however I made some changes, one actually by mistake. First, I added an egg by mistake.  Just saw it in the list of ingredients and since my other favorite bread recipe has an egg added it without paying attention.  The other things I did differently were . . . I always let my bread rise in a warm oven, so I let these loaves rise on the cookie sheet in the oven.  Took out the risen loaves to brush with egg/water mixture, then preheated the oven.  Was afraid to do the cut, so I didn't do that part.  Also, took them out of the oven at 25 minutes.   Delicious bread!!  I will cook it the same way next time.  :)

This bread seems heavy even if I use bread flour instead of all purpose flour. I have tried to use more yeast, more salt, less salt, different flour, white sugar instead of brown, and I just can't get it to work great. If I use a knife to slice a fast slit in the center, the loaf falls. I have used egg wash, baked sesame  seeds on it, and at the end of baking it used an Italian seasoning with garlic and parmesan on the bread to improve the taste. I have made this bread 4 times now and it is time for me to give up and find a new recipe.

I have made this bread several times, and it is absolutely fantastic.  I get rave reviews from my friends, and a co-worker said that he would marry me just for my bread. 

It is so good, and I mainly use it for a breakfast sandwich made with eggs and turkey bacon, and homemade garlic bread. 

The only change I made to this bread was using bread flour instead of the unbleached flour.

This bread is absolutely delicious!  There is no need to ever buy Italian bread again when you have such an easy and fantastic recipe like this one.  I made it twice - the first time I reduced the salt to 1 tsp. as recommended in some reviews and the second time as written in the recipe.  I will stick with the full amount as that’s what my family and I thought tasted the best.  I cooked it for 45 minutes as we like it on the extra crispy side.  So perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious Italian bread! I used the bread machine to knead the dough and for the first rise, then divided into 2 loaves and placed on parchment with cornmeal for the  final rise. I've had bread fall after rising in the past, so the reviewers who suggested this are giving great advice.

After baking I placed the loaves to cool on a wire rack and brushed one with garlic butter. The one that was untouched had a nice crispy crust and the one brushed with garlic butter had a nice chewy crust. Both were good.

I will definitely make this one again. Simple recipe, good flavour.

*note* A package of yeast is equal to 2 1/4 tsp.

*edit* I tried putting the bread dough in 2 greased glass bread pans for the final rise and to bake, baking as instructed. Just as good, and even better if you want to make sandwiches with it!

I was skeptical of this recipe but decided to try it. I can say this is one of the best Italian breads I've had. I did take the advice and did a double rise, once on a board and another on the baking pan, 40 mins a piece. I used a convection oven at 375 and it came out perfect

Great Italian bread recipe! I always follow directions as written when I first try a recipe and this bread didn't disappoint. The crust was perfect and the inside was delicious. I am intrigued by some of the suggestions in the reviews and I think the next time I make it I'll try baking it on a pizza stone but the ingredients and baking time worked very well for me.

Definitely let the loaves rise in loaf pans. I read some of the other reviews and used 1 tsp salt. Having only one egg, I used egg substitute in the bread and I used the egg for the egg wash. The bread turned out good, except it went kinda flat.
I would make again using loaf pans.

Yes, truly amazing!
The only real pagnotta is the one made with the biga (starter): but I very rarely have biga ready in my fridge or freezer, so I went in search of a pagnotta recipe for the sudden whim. THIS IS IT! Wonderful.
There is practically no work involved with this bread. Once out of the bread machine, I placed the pagnotte on a sheet of parchment paper and covered them with a damp kitchen towel to rest (as per recipe instructions). After 40 minutes, I transferred them on the parchment paper itself into the oven. I permanently leave a pizza stone in the oven: when  I was ready to bake, I put the pagnotte on a parchment paper upon the pizza stone, and once they hardened enough, I slipped them off the paper directly on the stone. No big deal (and no cornmeal). 
Only change: more olive oil than suggested by the directions (I always use a good amount for my bread and pizza doughs).
I didn’t brush them with eggs because I finally came to the realization that I don’t like egg-brushed bread crusts—including my Shabbat challot (challahs). Also, as an Italian, I can guarantee you that pagnotta does not have egg brushed on top, ever. I am attaching some pictures here. Thank you & Brava, Destiny!

By far the best bread machine dough!  I shaped it into 4 mini loaves and let it rise on parchment covered cookie sheet.  Will definitely make again, maybe shape it into 6 rolls instead of 4. Dough was easy to work with and the finished bread was artisan bakery quality.

Only change was to use 3 1/2 cups of all purpose flour and 1/2 cup of KA's olive artisan bread flavor. Had to add an additional 1/8 cup of water to get good consistency. I let the loaves rise on a pizza stone so I did't have to move them.  Great recipe.

I used my bread machine and I did knead the dough once more before shaping to rise again. The second time I made it, my grand daughters, 8 and 9 each got half the dough to learn how to knead and we shaped the dough into 9 balls (for rolls). We placed them right on the baking pan on top of the cornmeal to rise again, then egg washed the tops and took scissors to make a criss cross cut in each. They were pretty and delicious! We used them for dinner and the remainders for breakfast. I have a batch all done now for a dinner party this evening, so I'm off to start kneading ( not required in the directions) but I like them to feel soft as a baby's bottom. Happy Baking folks! P.S. this is in my baking book for my grandchildren.

I love this recipe, I add the egg in and don't use the cornmeal.  It' a favorite!

I've made this six times in the past week and a half.  The family loves it!  Twice I made garlic bread with it and then four loaves of sandwich bread in a Pullman pan.  The only thing I changed was I added 4 teaspoons of vital wheat gluten.  I also used Semolina on my pans instead of corn meal.  I let my dough rise in the oven and I baked it with a small dish of water beneath it.  Perfect every time!

I am a always a day late and a dollar short. Donlt know if you  have any updated reviews or not, but I have died and gone to heaven. This bread is fabulous. Mine  did flatten a little in  the transfer but next time I'll use parchment paper. Thank you!

Made it for company.  Did all ingredients as per recipe except cut salt to 1 tsp.  I made it in bread machine w/dough menu.  After taking it out of bread machine I formed it into 2 loaves on pan that was greased and had cornmeal on it.   Next time put each bread on it's own pan.  They get too big and merge together.  Try forming them into longer loaves like italian bread.  I tried to split w/a knife before baking but it didn't work too good but try again.  I covered w/a damp towel for 2nd rising like suggested, but towel stuck to bread.  Maybe cover w/greased handiwrap next time.  The original ones came out a little flat, but were still very good, everyone liked them.

Excellent as buns.  
Only used 1 tsp salt.  Added to bread maker in this order:  water, oil, sugar, flour, salt and yeast.  Kneaded into bun shapes then placed on sheets with parchment, sprayed with warm water then placed in warm oven to rise along with a pie plate filled with some water at the bottom of the oven.  Baked only 20-25 min's.  Made 15 small, round buns.

The only thing I did different, only because I had to was the sugar. I did not have light brown sugar, only dark brown. So I did 1/2 tablespoon of dark brown and 1/2 tablespoon of white sugar. Came out delicious! I think next time I won't split the dough in half and I will make one larger loaf like the sizes commonly found in the grocery store. None the less, this recipe is a keeper.

Tasted good but a little flatter than I would like....a little too small for sandwiches.  May try shaping into a boule next time and perhaps try baking artisan-style in a hot dutch oven.

No changes except for the length of time. My oven cooks fast so instead of 32 min. 28 min.  Couldn't wait to cool down, the inside beautiful  and taste yummy. Thanks for the recipe.

I have been making this about once a week since I found the recipe. The first time I put the egg that is call for in the dough mix by mistake. However I found that this actually makes it better. Easy recipe and it makes 2 loaves which is great

Great bread. Crusty outside and soft inside. I followed suggestions and used 2 cups all purpose flour and 2 cups bread flour. I lined the baking sheet with parchment paper and used the cornmeal it worked perfectly . Will definently make again .

I did make this however I did exclude the cornmeal from the recipe and added 1 egg to the bread maker with the other ingredients. 
Outside had a nice crunch and inside was very soft, great with a soup.

This was my second time making this bread. It's wonderful, crispy on the outside and light and tender on the inside. I followed this recipe as written and I have zero complaints. Hubs and son both enjoyed it too, this will be my "go to" for homemade Italian bread. Delizioso!

I was impressed by how crusty and tender this bread was. The family loved it. Made it as a Fathers' Day treat for the hubby, along with Shrimp Scampi Bake from this site over fettuccine, and some roasted broccoli. I think this loaf might have been the star of the meal. It was sooo easy! I only strayed from the recipe by subbing two cups bread flour for all AP flour. Followed the advice of other commenters and rose the loaves on the parchment-lined baking sheet, rather than the board. Will definitely make again and again.

This bread was delicious! I ate three pieces soon after it came out of the oven! We have lots of trouble finding Italian bread in the stores where we live. If you don't get there early enough, they're sold out, so I usually have to settle for French bread or another type of bread. Now I can make my own! I made the recipe as written, but did need to add a little more water as the dough was a little dry. I baked the loaves in my new Italian bread pan, and I also put a pan of water in the bottom of the oven to help make the crust nice and crisp. I put the dough in the bread pan for the final rise as I was afraid it would fall if I moved it. I'm not sure why the recipe says to do that, but it's a risk I didn't want to take. I will be making this bread on a regular basis. Yum!

This tastes just like the panini's that are sold at the Italian Shop. I no longer have a bread maker so I used my KA with the hook to whip this up. I used half bread flour and half unbleached, only because I needed to use it up.  I proofed the yeast and proceeded from there. When the dough was ready I wiped the bowl clean and added a little olive oil, returned the dough to the bowl and turned to coat. I let it rise for 40 minutes, divided  and formed two loafs and placed them directly on a parchment lined cookie tray.  I like to spritz the oven with water when I put the bread in and again in three minutes. Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

This was a snap.  Just follow the directions if you have sticking problems.  The crust on this bread is exactly what I was looking for.  Nice variation in the voids in the cooked bread.  Delicious.

I followed the advice given regarding using only 1tsp salt and not transferring bread. I used 2 baking pans 16 X 4.5 X  3.5 inches instead of cookie sheet! We loved the bread and will use this recipe again!

It turned out wonderful. Everyone loved it. Soft, with some crunch on the crust. I will absolutely make again...and again.  This is a wonderful and easy recipe.

I've made it twice and it turned out a lot better than I expected it to. I've added herbs and used 1/2 regular flour and 1/2 bread flour. I'm going to use full bread flour next time. In all, it saves time and pleases the crowd with Italian dishes. Not to mention is a lot cheaper than buying at the store. I have a family of 8 and makes the world of difference. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was great tasting bread. I was a bit concerned about the brown sugar but, it turned out light and chewy inside with a great crunchy crust. I used a nonstick perforated French bread pan and threw in a few handfuls of water (3 or 4 times) while cooking. After 30 minutes the crust was golden brown and crisp; the inside was hollow. I shaped the dough into a rectangle and rolled the top and bottom in towards the center. I flipped the whole thing over and shaped it on the bread pan. I let it rise for 40 minutes and then coated it with the egg mixture. One more note: my bread machine instructions said to put in COLD water (i.e., refrigerated).

I don't have a bread machine, but I made this in my Kitchenmaid mixer.  After mixing the ingredients, I kneaded the dough on medium speed for about 5 minutes, removed the dough from the bowl, oiled the bowl, returned the dough and allowed to rise for about an hour.  Then followed  the rest of the instructions as written.  I was very good - nice and chewy.

This was delicious.  I was going to lower the salt, but forgot and added the full 1.5 teaspoons...and it was just fine.   I did use bread flour as that is what I had.  YUM!!! I have an "Italian Loaf Pan" from KA and put the loaves on there for the 2nd rise and then just popped that in the oven (after glazing with egg mixture), threw a few ice cubes in to get some steam and 30 minutes later the loaves were beautifully browned and perfectly baked.  My boyfriend and I couldn't stop eating it!!!

I've made this countless times now and it always turns out really well. I've also passed along loaves of this bread to family and have gotten rave reviews. 35 minutes is the perfect baking time for me, rotating each baking sheet halfway through. Also, parchment paper works to replace the cornmeal and saves on clean up. I also let the dough rise directly on the baking sheets for the 2nd rise and find this to be the easiest way to go. I sometimes have to let the dough rise longer (up to an hour at times) so I use the tip someone else mentioned by poking the dough and if the indentation remains, it's ready for baking. I use all the salt listed in the recipe and it's perfect. Thank you so much for posting this easy, delicious and impressive recipe!

I have made this recipe a couple of times and have run into the same problem each time. Namely,  it is beautiful right up to the moment I brush on the egg and then the loaf deflates,  never to rise again,  or just a little. No matter how carefully and lightly I apply the egg wash, the bread comes out like a ciabatta. The only change I made is to decrease the salt to one teaspoon, as I have to watch my sodium intake.  Any suggestions to solve this issue?

I just couldn't get this bread right. The first time I tried to make it, it didn't really form a dough. So, I scratched it and we tried again. This time, I followed a reviewers instructions of letting the yeast and water sit together for 10 minutes. Still, it didn't seem like there was enough liquid in order to make a dough. So I added more liquid until it formed a dough. It looked really nice in the oven, but when we tasted it, it was too dense.

I use this recipe often and we love it.  It is really easy too.  I also make an herbed olive oil dip to go along with the bread to either dip the bread into or spoon over the sliced pieces.  Yummy.

I love this recipe! Especially the part where you bake it in the oven instead of the bread machine so that I don't get that hole in the bottom of the loaf.

After reading reviews, I followed some recommendations. I used only a tsp of salt.  I don't have a bread machine, so used my stand mixer with a dough hook, covered the dough and let rise 30 min. I punched it down and shaped the loaves on baking sheet with parchment and let raise for 30 minutes. Didn't use cornmeal, made diagonal cuts and brushed it with the egg mixture. What a wonderful crust and flavor. My husband and I had to have a couple of slices right from the oven! It is going to go great with the homemade wedding soup later!

First rise was good. 2nd rise and the loaves fell flat moving them onto the pizza stone. Did not rise after after baking. Will not do this again.

Great recipe. I switched out 1 1/2 cups of bread flour with white whole wheat bread flour and added 1 tbs Italian Spices and 2 tsp garlic powder. Made it more of a country loaf, very tasty, and boy did it smell great cooking!. Family loved it! I also let the bread rise on my bread pan. The second time I mace it I froze one loaf before rising for the future.

This is delicious.  It is great with soups.  I did also use half bread flour and half regular.  And when it was in the machine, I found myself having to pour in quite a bit of extra water.  Also, it needed an hour rising, and it helped to have it rise on a warm oven.  Definitely a keeper.

This is wonderful, easy and delicious!  Due to the number of recipes I was juggling at once and the coolness in my kitchen this time of year, I did the 40-minute warming in my oven's warming drawer which was set to medium.  (The oven itself was also on.)  Because I was using my warming drawer, I allowed the loaves to rise directly on the baking sheet which had the cornmeal on it.  This worked great and I was VERY pleased with the results!  Thanks!!

Definitely a very good recipe. I followed the directions exactly except moving the loaves. They rose on the baking sheet, I just didn't see the point in moving them.

The one issue I had probably has more to do with my bread machine than with the recipe. I bought it at a garage sale, no manual. It's an old, 12 cup capacity Mr Coffee Breadmaker. I'm pretty sure that the dough cycle includes a second rising. Since I followed the recipe directions, I allowed the cycle to finish, meaning that the bread was "punched down" twice. 

Bottom line is that my loaves turned out a bit more dense than what I would consider "perfect", but they are pretty darn close. This recipe will definitely be my go-to. It's simple enough and inexpensive enough (how nice to come across a recipe for which I have every ingredient on hand) that I can afford the time and money to "tweak" until I get the perfect loaf of my dreams. I'll update with success and failures, especially for owners of the Mr Coffee Breadmaker.

My bread turned out rather dense and flatter than anticipated. I used half bread flour and half all-purpose, and otherwise stuck to the recipe as written. The only exception I made was to allow it to rise an additional 15 minutes (gave it a full hour). The dough looked perfect once put onto the cornmeal-dusted pan for that final rise. It rose, but I'm thinking that the dampened dishcloth was maybe too heavy, and perhaps I should have used a piece of greased plastic wrap or parchment/wax paper instead. Or maybe brushing on the eggwash was the issue. If I make it again, I'll try using something lighter than the damp dishcloth and will maybe look for an alternative to the eggwash. :/

Perfect! Bread turned out beautiful, crusty on the outside and great on the inside. Only thing I did different was to use better for bread flour instead of A/P.

So incredibly easy.  I'm disappointed in myself for buying crappy store-made bread for so long.  I did screw up though and left the dough seam side up, so it tore and looked odd.  I believe this also caused it to loose it's fluffiness the next day, but it still tasted good.  I may experiment with mixing in a little whole wheat flour next time to make it healthier.

Just made this bread for the first time and it turned out perfectly! I used 2 cups bread flour and 2 cups regular flour and reduced the salt to 1 tsp. The loaves didn't rise much in 40 minutes so I ended up heating the towels in the micro for 25 seconds and letting the loaves rise another 15 minutes - this helped quite a bit. My oven runs hot so I only baked them for 25 minutes.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

I bake a similar recipe -use honey instead of sugar and bread flour. After shaping the loaf (any way you like) I place it on non-stick foil on a cookie sheet- and when ready for baking, I slide the foil and dough onto a stone (not the cookie sheet).  You can leave it with the foil under it and it will bake just fine - I usually simply slide the foil out from under the loaf after about 10-15 minutes so the dough actually touches the stone. (The foil can be used again since it is clean! - your choice). I have also baked my breads for about 45-50 min.  Always turn out with crispy crust and soft inside.

Made this bread today with beef stew. I did add 1/2 t extra yeast and I also used bread flour. The texture was great and easy to handle once it came out of the bread machine. I did make one big loaf. rolled it out into a rectangle then brushed the dough with melted butter and fresh garlic and rolled it up like a cinnamon roll. placed seam side down and baked at 375 for 25 minutes on a pizza stone. make sure you put a bowl of water in the oven. I did not use the egg wash,I used a milk wash instead. the crust came out great.

Simply the best bread recipe I've used yet! Put a small pan of water in the bottom of the oven per other reviewers suggestions. Great idea!Added Italian herbs to the top of the bread before final rise. Also added sauteed crushed garlic and butter to the top in the last 15 minutes of bake time.Definitely my go to recipe for Italian bread now!Thanks for sharing =)

This was simply GREAT! I live in Australia and the flour is different than my home America and I have alot of problems with things like biscuits and cookies and cakes, so I was expecting something a little less than good, but it was just like bakery bread, maybe even better. Thank you. KC

This was my first time making a french bread. It was so incredibly easy and it was DELICIOUS!! I didn't want two loaves so I halved it and only made one loaf. It turned out great (I was afraid halving it wouldn't turn out right). It was great and I got LOTS of great compliments on it. My husbands first words were, "Did you buy this???"

All in with the stars Destiny.  Great stuff, simple yet delicious.  I "built" the loaves on a pizza peel (it was handy and I thought it appropriate) and then slid them off onto the pizza stone in the oven. (only after covering the tops with my home-made Everything bagel mix....  Nice!
Plus, it puts my bread machine to work !

I loved this recipe!! SO EASY. I don't know if my knife wasn't sharp enough but my slit in the bread didn't do anything besides make my loaf less pretty. Also, I baked mine for 10 minutes less than it called for because it was getting golden by the 20 minute mark.

My family LOVES this bread. I follow recipe exactly but use a kitchenaid mixer, not a bread machine. I have also tried this recipe using half whole wheat flour and my family loves it even MORE that way.

This bread is so simple and tastes amazing! Thank you for my new go-to bread recipe...no more picking a loaf up for dinner at the store!

I do this in my kitchen aid mixer with the dough hook and it's so simple!

I just made this recipe today and I absolutely love it! I actually accidentally read the recipe wrong and put an egg in with my bread dough mixture, but after reading some of the reviews about the dough being too crumbly and somewhat dense I wasn't quite as worried about the way the bread might turn out.  The result: the bread was the perfect texture inside and out.  The recipe tastes exactly like the local bakery bread that I used to buy, which was exactly what I was looking for.  This bread is perfectly moist, with a perfect crust and is absolutely delicious!  The cornmeal and egg wash at the end give it the extra push to send it right over the top.  Definitely a keeper!

Tastes just like bread from an Italian bakery I used to go to when I was a kid.  I used bread flour instead of AP flour and brushed the top with olive oil instead of egg wash.  It turned out two GREAT loaves of bread!  This is a keeper!

This bread is ridiculously easy to make, and so delicious it's probably illegal in some states. At first I wasn't quite on board, since I was looking for a straight up bread machine loaf recipe, but I am thrilled that I went through with the piddling step of taking the dough out of the machine, brushing it with an egg wash and cooking it for a half hour. 
Honestly, when it came out of the oven I had just eaten a large dinner and couldn't resist taking a little nubbin off the end. Outrageous. I'm going to make a garlic bread with one loaf, and maybe use the other for sandwiches. I'm not worried, this bread will be eaten up in no time for sure. I had cornmeal on hand and I really like the touch that adds to the bottom of the loaf.

This turned out quite well and the flavor of the bread was fantastic.  My loaf turned out to be a little dense and gummy, but I think that's more my user error than an issue with the recipe; I may have over-shaped the dough, or let it rise too long.  I would make this again, perhaps as rolls!

I have made this with regular all-purpose flour and with a mixture of 100% whole wheat and regular. It tastes fine either way. Made with the mixture the loaves are smaller and more dense.

I've been baking bread for years, but somehow haven't been able to get an Italian loaf that made me happy. This bread makes me happy!
The crumb was awesome. Not that big fluffy stuff from the grocers. But the crust was where it really excelled. Perfect.Thank you so much for sharing.

I've made a lot of bread in my machine, including breads using the machine for dough only and this is easily one of the best recipes. The texture is perfect for Italian Bread and the taste is also great. I cut down to 1 tsp salt and had to add a little flour during the kneading, but that's not unusual. It did make a sticky dough and next time I might cut back on the water a bit, adding more a little at a time as needed  as it tended to stick to my peel even with lots of corn meal laid down on the peel ahead of time. Also, I cooked it on a stone rather than a baking sheet. Teriffic!

This is the easiest yeast bread I've ever made.  I usually add a heaping tablespoon of flaxseed or rye flour for health and texture and let it rise 50 minutes instead of 40. Everyone loves my "artisan bread".  They don't need to know how easy it is!

This was the best bread machine recipe I have ever made.  The texture was perfect.  I added a little extra salt because I like my bread a little more salty and I still could not taste the salt.  So I think the amount of salt in the recipe is not anything to shy away from.  Also I think next time I may make one large loaf as opposed to two smaller ones.  I will definitly make this again.

I added about a tsp of onion powder, garlic powder, rosemary, and basil to the recipe. I skipped the egg water and cornmeal step and just brushed the pan and tops of the loaves with olive oil. I also baked in the oven with a tray of ice cubes under them. These made great loaves for sandwiches and was cheaper than Subway!

I did half bread flour and a little extra water (due to altitude here in Denver), but otherwise followed the recipe. Outstanding bread! Ate way to much! So good, can't wait to eat some more tomorrow!

We tried this bread over the Christmas holiday. My family and I were making eggplant parm for dinner and I've always wanted to make fresh bread and never did. I've had a bread machine for 6 years now and only used once before, the first time I tried it the bread didn't come out the greatest. This recipe was sooo easy and the bread was soo delicious, I think we made 6 loaves that day. My friend accidentally chose the wrong cycle and the machine ended making the bread inside the machine, even that bread was soo yummy. I did try the less salt and it was perfect. Thank you Destiny for sharing this great recipe!  :)

My bread machine wasn't working and I really wanted Italian bread! So, I took 1/3 of the warm water and dissolved the sugar and yeast in it for about 10 minutes till it was creamy. When I turned it out onto a floured surface to knead it it was very dry so I added 1 Tablespoon of milk.  I kneaded it for about 10 minutes and let it rise for about 3 hours.  Then I followed the rest of the directions. Great flavor, pretty bread and not a very diffficult recipe to follow!

I've made several different things in my bread machine since I bought it, and DH says this bread is by far the best.  It tastes like bread served at our favorite Italian restaurant.  I made it exactly as written except I sprinkled sesame seeds on top after the egg wash.  I think I'll be making this bread regularly.

Perfect!  I usually make a recipe the first time according to the instructions and then have to amend it because we live at 5200' altitude.  However, this turned our exceptionally well on the first go.  The texture is amazing and the taste is quite yummy.  The only trouble I had was trying to figure out how I was going to thump a hot loaf of bread on its bottom to see if it sounded hollow and thus done.  Instead, I checked it at 30 minutes and the color was a beautiful, rich, golden brown.  Thanks for this great recipe.

Add another cup of flour!! But other than that- This bread was great, I had to mass produce bread for a church potluck and it was just what i needed! I had a lot of compliments. I baked it as is and it didn't rise as high, so I added another cup of flour, and also skipped the rise in the bread machine and formed it on the pan with the cornmeal, it worked much better and cut my time down by an hour! Delicious bread!

It took me two tries to get it right. My first loaves took forever to rise (I think there was a problem with the yeast). I tried again just to make sure. The bread was good but not great. I probably won't make this again.

Excellent! Instead of the egg wash, I just sprayed it with a little Crisco oil. Oh, and I did one huge loaf instead of two smaller ones, and it was wonderful for garlic bread. Thanks for sharing! :)

THIS WAS EASY AND IT LOOKED IMPRESSIVE. BUT I MADE IT TWICE, AND EACH TIME IT WAS REALLY BLAND. NO TASTE.  I'M GOING TO TRY AGAIN AND ADD A FEW HERBS, MORE SALT LIKE SOME SUGGESTED. ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS?

This was easy using the bread machine. I found the bread a bit on the dry side. Otherwise, it had good flavor. Will make again, but would want to halve the recipe -- two loaves at once was a lot.

This is the easiest and most forgiving bread and most of all it is absolutely delicious.  I left it in the bread machine for an extra four hours and it still made beautiful bread.  I usually top it with sesame seeds, poppy seeds, chopped onion and garlic.  This is definitely better than store bought bread.  Thanks Destiny for this perfect bread!

Totally great bread recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly - except as another reviewer, half bread flour and half regular.  The bread is better than any store bought -dense and wonderful texture. I will try using half bread flour and half whole wheat next time.Thanks for the recipe.  Highly recommend it.

This was good, but it was really not what I was looking for. This for me was too dense and heavy.  I think I should have kneaded it again to incorporate more air and make it a little lighter after I took it out of the bread machine.  I used half bread flour and half all purpose.  I will make this again, but I may take this out of my bread machine before the 2nd rise.  It was pretty dry when it came out and will definitely knead this by hand and then do the 2nd rise, before shaping into rolls.  They were very hard to shape correctly, may use all bread flour, but I will definitely try to make these again.

I liked this bread but I have to try it again because I messed up and I think it would be better the next time. First of all I wanted to cut the recipe in half as it is only hubby and I and even with freezing, two loaves is too much. So I carefully measured all my dry ingredients and put them aside, I then measured the liquids into the machine, add my dries and pressed dough. Thankfully I looked at it a few minutes later and realized that OOOPs...I used the full amount of liquids. OK, just add another half of all the dries, turn back on, problem solved (I think). It seemed to recover well and made a decent dough. I formed my loaves and they rose well but either washing or splitting them cause them to fall. We did like the taste and all and think it would be slightly better if they had stayed risen so I will try again.

This was an excellent recipe.  We are at 5k feet so we needed to add about a TBSP of extra water, but the rest of the measurements were perfect.  We made garlic bread with this for dinner, then sliced the 2nd loaf for a french dip the next day.  It was still moist and yummy.  Def going into the rotation.

My bread did not rise the second time.  I believe that I did everything correctly.  The bread turned out very dry and dense, with an unpleasant texture.  Luckily my husband was willing to eat it anyway.

This bread tasted eally good but the texture was a little more dense than I was looking for.  My husband liked it a lot.  I wanted to try to amke rolls out of it but I don't think this is the right recipe because of the slightly heavy texture.  **I just made this again today and still had no luck.  Everything rose as it was supposed to but I just didn't like it.  I will keep searching for an authentic italian bread.

AMAZING...is all I have to say. This was extremely easy to make and just being able to slice fresh out of the oven bread and spread butter on it was well worth the effort. Store bought bread just doesn't compare. I really liked the two smaller loafs as compared to one large from the store--helped with portion control. I can see making this 3-4 times a month for my family. I followed the recipe to a T and it came out great. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe Destiny!

Great bread! First time I've made Italian bread and it was simple and delicious! Followed recipe as is. Only tip I used from another reviewer was to throw a handful of ice cubes in the bottom of the oven after 15 minutes of baking. The crust was crunchy when it first came out and would have remained so had we eaten it right away. However, I was bringing it to a dinner and wrapped hot bread loaves in towels in a basket. The bread was slightly warm when we ate it and the crust had softened some. But it still was just the right chewiness. The bread has great flavor! I may try mixing in additional flavors (asiago cheese, roasted garlic) for fun!

Wow, my new oven is super hot.  I baked at 350 for 29 minutes and took them out not a moment too soon.  The bread is delicious, crunchy and chewy.  Next time I will make my loaves longer and bake even less.  I will roll out the dough to about eight inches by fourteen, roll up long way and bake for about 25 minutes.  The recipe is great, but I did have to add more water.  The taste and texture was great, but I didn't like the appearance of the loaves.  That was my fault.  Thanks for this recipe.

This is the best bread I have ever made with my bread maker doing all the work.  I simply split the dough in half and roll it out into 2 loaves, flour my glass pan and let it rise in the pan.  Perfect when done and makes wonderful garlic bread or subs!

This is our favorite bread recipe! I was out of olive oil so I used walnut oil. It still turned out fabulous! Can't wait to try these as rolls for the holidays! Crunchy crust and soft inside. Used left over to make french bread pizzas.

I have used this recipe over and over again it is just amazing every time. The first time I made this I was just bored and i love to bake and my two teenagers love to eat and have tons of friends that love to eat so I made this and they all loved it. But to my surprise my I ended up making 8 loaves and every single crumb was devoured in one day! Thank you for this recipe.

Wonderful bread! One reviewer mentioned bread not 'browning'. If using a really good quality olive oil, your bread will be closer to tan -- not a dark brown. Changing the flour will change the texture, but won't be that noticeable.

This was really, really good! I followed the recipe exactly and I don't see why people are suggesting that you use less salt, I thought it was perfect! And for some reason mine just wasn't browing, it cooked for closer to 50 mins so my crust came out really hard but it tasted great... everyone still ate every bit of it, even the crunchy crust. Next time I will try using half bread flour and half all purpose flour to see if there is a difference... and like others I made my cut on the top of the bread before baking but I guess it wasn't big enough and it closed back on itself... cut deep! I also let it rise the second time on my baking sheet lined w/ my Silpat, doing it on the cutting board is a wasted step. And even though I didn't need the cornmeal since nothing sticks to the Silpat I still used it and I'm glad I did... I LOVED the cornmeal on the bottem! I'll definatly be making this on a weekly basis! In fact I'm making this again tomorrow and making garlic bread out of it to go along w/ my meatballs and sauce. THANKS!!!

Mine looked nothing like the pic, the bread hardly rose, baked on a pizza stone. The split also caved in on my loaves... the taste was good, but not what I expected.

Very tasty.  The crust was just the right amount of chewy.  Mine sure don't look like Nandabear's picture but they had a great taste.  I had to add a bit more water than called for so I wonder if that's why mine didn't raise like Nandas.  Oh well.. I loved it still and will keep this in the bread rotation.

This was good and worked even when I did NOT follow directions...somehow I had it in mind that I was supposed to knead the dough again once I punched it down and prior to shaping it into loaves. Next time (and see...I do hope to go there again) I will try to do it right. Still, though, yum AND gorgeous!

Absolutely delicious! I made this for the first time last night and it was gone shortly after. I have another loaf in the oven now. I actually make 1 large loaf and after brushing egg on the top, I coat with sesame seeds. Tastes just like the bread from the North End.

Unbelievable! And so easy! I didn't have an egg, so I baked it without it.  Also, I baked it for just 25 minutes.  The crust is absolutely perfect.

I halved this recipe which was my own fault. I didn't really get a good rise or a great looking loaf. I made it into garlic bread. Next time I'll do a full recipe. It was good though although it had a pretty dense texture.

I was also impressed by the multitude of praise for this bread.  I'm about to make it for the 10th time in 2 weeks.  I've added cheese to it and garlic.  It's an easy 5 stars.

Next time I will skip the part of putting it on the cutting board..no reason why it can't just rise on the pan:) Thank you for theis recipe and thank you smitty for suggesting it:)

This was great. Husband loved it... and it even met my high standards. Turned into some of the best garlic bread I've ever made. Put it on parchment to rise and baked it on same parchment. Used two over racks and swapped places about 10 minutes before the bread was done. I'm going to try cooking both loaves on the same large baking sheet next time.

This turned out great!  I followed the recipe to the T once, and the second time I divided the salt in half.  I don't think it makes much of a difference.  The only thing I found is that it doesn't have to bake as long, less 5 minutes or so.

Not the best, too dense. I don't rule out Baker's error though as I may have done something wrong. I will be making this again to see if it was me and if it comes out great, I'll be back to tell you all about it!

I've made this three times and it still is just too heavy and dense for my liking.

I make this almost every week now - so easy and simple. You get alot of bread for such little ingredients.

To give it a different taste add a good tablespoon of a mixture of Italian herbs with dried garlic thrown in (I like to use the Pesto mix from Tastefully Simple). It gives it a different taste and makes everyone wonder what is in it.

This was really, really good!  It was beautiful coming out of the oven as well! I used half AP and half bread flour. My hubby and I both thought it needed a little something extra...more sugar perhaps?  Some honey butter for dipping would probably do the trick. It just lacked a little sweetness that we missed.  Otherwise, easy and delicious!  I will make again!

I'll admit that I'm the worst bread maker ever, but this bread recipe came out absolutely perfect!!!!! I had two beautiful and tasty loaves. I created an olive oil dip with lots of italian herbs like Carrabbas and dunked this chewy crusted bread over and over!

This was good.  I think I need to add more salt.  It was a bit more dense than I like, but overall I am happy to be making my own bread and my husband loves the fact that I am using the bread machine that I just "had to have"!  I will have to work on perfecting my technique!

Excellent bread with a soft flavorful middle and tasty crust. The only problem I had with it was moving it from the cutting board to the baking sheet-but that was because of my own clumsiness. Also, the two loaves are relatively small. For a large meal with several people, I'd probably scale it 50% bigger.

I have  made this recipe so many times that I have it memorized.  I made it and gave it as a Christmas gift (as part of a basket of course) and I was told by my father that it was the best Italian bread he had ever had.  I agree!!!!!!!

I use bread flour and occasionally add rosemary and  black pepper to the dough and then a a little bit of kosher salt sprinkled on the egg wash before baking.

I don't have a bread machine so I made this in my KitchenAid mixer with the dough hook and let it rise for about an hour in a warm oven.  I then followed the directions on the recipe.  I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it.  I thought it was good but was hoping for something just a little less dense. I want to try it again with brand new yeast as mine was about 3 months old.  Good flavor, easy to prepare. Will try again.

Delicious bread!  Better than the recipe I usually use.  I liked the fact that it made 2 loaves.  I froze the dough for the second one so we'll have it for another time.  Nice rise and the texture was perfect.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong here but this was just average bread. The flavor wasn't that great and it didn't rise very well. Too dense. It definitely looked nice and smelled great while baking but was a bit of a let down. Thanks anyway.

Excellent recipe, very similar to our local Italian bakery's Calabrese bread.  They make it (and I like it) with a chewy crust, so I didn't brush the top with anything and it turned out just the way I hoped it would.  I'll be making this often.

Good stuff and altho I don't own a bread machine, this worked out beautifully. I used honey in lieu of the sugar and added my usual garlic and onion powders for a little extra flavor. I also sprinkled the top of the loaf with sesame seeds. This went so nicely with our chicken parm and baked ziti dinner that Our Table Talk.com friend and I made together. Destiny, the boys went wild over this the entire loaf is gone! Thanks a bunch!

This is one of the best recipes I've tried. Im so excited with my breadmachine, i've tried tons. I like to make mini loaves (we're only 4 people) and freeze them with my garlic & cheese. When i need them, just pop 'em in the oven! Thanks

Quite good! I added slightly less yeast than called for, and when I made it without the machine (ie, kneaded it by hand), I needed a bit of extra flour (perhaps 1/2 to 3/4 cup). 

My only complaint (and it's not even a complaint) is that I need to figure out how to shape it better. My loaves more closely resemble focaccia than French bread by the time they're done baking. However, my husband and I both loved it, with dinner and with jam in the morning.

This will definitely be my go to recipe for bread from now on!

Excellent, easy recipe.  I agree with other users that moving the bread to the baking sheet after rising causes them to deflate a bit and would recommend having them rise on the baking sheet directly.  I like the idea of minced garlic and will try that next time!

I made this recipe in the breadmachine as directed and toyed with actually allowing it to bake there, but decided against it.  I let the dough rise and bake in the traditional manner.

This is SUPER bread.  The flavor is delicious (with butter or garlic dipping oil) and my family enjoyed it and ate both loaves at dinner.  

Easy and EXCELLENT

This bread has a wonderful flavor.  I, too let the bread rise on the baking sheet.  Either parchment paper or cornmeal works.  If you want your bread a little softer, add some gluten per instructions on the box.  It is good either way. This does make a dense bread - all the better to dunk!

This bread was a hit for my family Christmas meal!  We served it with olive oil and fresh herbs for dipping and it was wonderful.  I will definitely make it again and again!

This recipe was excellent.  I added some italian seasoning to the bread and tasted perfect.  The instructions were accurate and easy to follow.  The bread did not last long in my house!

I used Sugar Twin for the sugar.  This recipe is so tasty and delicious with any meal.  It is also great when toasted in the toaster with butter and or cinnamon.

I made this exactly as described except I sprinked it with sesame seeds.  My loaves came out kind of flat.  I didn't read through the recipe before I printed it...I was bummed that I had to let it rise outside the machine and before I baked it.  Decent bread, might try again.

ETA:  I made this a second and third time and it was perfect.  Fourth time was a flop.  I think both of the bad ones were poorly activated yeast.  This is a great recipe when it turns out right!

I took the bread out of the oven about 10 minutes before the recipe suggested (after the whole house smelled like bread), and it was perfect!  My husband and I ate the first loaf plain and turned the other loaf into some of the best cheese-bread we've ever had. :)

This recipe made two of the most gorgeous loaves of bread I've ever made! I didn't do the egg wash or sesame seeds but it was wonderful. I'll definitely use this recipe again. Thanks for sharing it.

This was a hit for Mother's Day. This was the first bread I actually used the oven for the baking. I liked the idea of using the bread machine to make the dough. Turned out just fine, there were no leftovers.

Very good bread. This is my first attempt at making the dough in the machine, then baking in the oven. Easy recipe to follow, I would have liked it a little more airey, but that was likely my error, not the recipe. Nice flavor and great chewy crust.

This was good - but average.  I am Italian, and I was expecting a bit more, due to the rave reviews.  I enjoyed it, but I have had much better.  Thanks anyway...

Marvelous.  Fantastic.  Excellent.  This is some good bread.  It was simple to prepare and with a busy household, it is nice to have the dough take care of itself.   It  had a light texture while maintaining a desirable density.  I sprayed a little water in the oven before putting in the bread to help form a nice crust.  This is great as bruschetta and also as toasted garlic bread (from this site).  It's also going to make some yummy bread crumbs!    My husband saw these and he said "Wow, that is pretty bread!"  I also sprinkled some sesame seeds on before baking.

This bread turned out wonderfully for me.  I halved the recipe to make only one loaf.  The only problem I had was that I had to add more liquid during the kneading process.  I used Egg Beaters for the wash and added a little bit of italian seasoning.

My husband and I thought this was good, but felt it needs a little more brown sugar and salt. We also felt the dough may need to rise a little bit longer. We are definetely going to try making this again soon!

This was very easy and had a great texture.  I used this dough recipe as the starting point for making pepperoni bread - and it was fantastic!  Hubby and younger son raved about it.  A real keeper!
