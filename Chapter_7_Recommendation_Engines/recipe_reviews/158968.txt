WOW.  My husband asked for seconds!  I used fresh spinach and cooked it in the oven because it wasn't grill weather.  Turned out great!

Man cringed when I said I was making turkey-feta burgers... added some paprika, lemon juice, used egg whites, basil and additional garlic...absolutely FANTASTIC!  My husband seriously couldn't stop eating or talking about how good they were!  Thanks for the recipe -- will make this again and again!

So easy - just 5 ingredients - both my 6 & 9 year old sons love this - i added extra garlic - patties do not shrink so be careful with thickness - we have started adding chopped sun dried tomatoes -makes a very good burger even better - definitely better with good quality ground turkey breast - would give 6 stars if I could!

This was an awesome recipe.  I tweaked it a little per the suggestion of other reviewers, and sauteed the garlic with some onion and added fresh spinach to that mixture (didn't even drain this before adding to the meat), and I probably used a little more feta than the recipe specified.  Next time, I would chop the spinach mixture before adding to the meat and I would add salt to the meat.  I cooked mine on the stovetop and didn't really have any issues with them being jiggly.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Hi all...this is my recipe. I didn't even think about it when I wrote the recipe, but i usually do make the burgers ahead of time and chill for at least an hour....hope that helps!

This was yummy! I added worcestershire and lemon juice as another reviewer suggested but I think I would leave out the lemon next time as it didn't seem to add anything to the taste. I would definitely recommend refrigerating the patties for at least an hour after forming to help them stick together. My husband had a heck of a time grilling them, but he said it was worth the trouble! We ate them on buns with mayo, tomato and lettuce for dinner and then again for lunch, Yum! :o)

These were really good.  I added 2 cloves of garlic as was suggested, for a total of 4 cloves, and I used almost all of a 16 oz bag of spinich.  I also put two splashes of worchestershire as per another reviewers suggestion (but didn't taste it) and added salt and pepper.  The taste of these were really good, however they were a bit dry.  I am definitely going to make them again, with an aim toward them being not so dry. Lastly, I served with buns and ketchup and onions like a burger ... the first one I ate I ate on the bun, and then I ate a second bunless... bunless is DEFINITELY the way to go... the subtle tastes of the spinich and feta were lost amidst the ketchup/bun/onions, therefore, the next time I will try with tzatziki sauce as recommended.  I think the labeling of these as "burgers" does them injustice!  I gave 4 stars, hopefully next time I'll be able to edit and give 5!
EDIT:  Made again, making 4 large patties which were brushed with olive oil and put in the oven at 350 for appx 35 minutes.  Served with tzatziki sauce and rice ... boy, what a yummy and gourmet tasting meal!  Upping my review to 5 stars... this was definitely the way to eat these!

They are sort of weird and jiggly and cannot be made into a traditional "burger" patty.  I suggest forming them as you are putting them on the grill.  As soon as they have cooked a bit, they cease to be jiggly.  These are the most excellent burgers I have ever eaten.

These burgers are great for being Turkey. My son is the pickiest eater and her really liked these we did not tell him they had spinach in them. We did serve them with  Tzatziki Sauce II which was to die for. They had great flavor and being 300 calories or less you can't go wrong.

Made these at an Easter Cookout with the family and everyone loved them! I added mushrooms and accidentally forgot the feta cheese, but they were a big hit anyway. Also, I didn't make the tzatziki sauce due to a time crunch. Instead i used swiss cheese on onion buns and used light mayonnaise.

Only problem is that they're really soggy. I had a few fall through the grill. Tried putting them in a freezer for a while and it really helped.

This would be a great recipe to make and freeze and throw them on the george grill for a quick healthy meal!

Simply wonderful.  I used a bag of fresh chopped spinach.  The flavors combine together and none of them overpower the other.  I will make again!

Absolutely delicious. RAVE review from my guests, including the men. Per other's suggestions: I sauted the garlic and onion and then added the squeezed out, chopped spinach to the onions and garlic before incorporating all the veggies into the cold eggs and turkey. I added a squeeze of lemon, a tsp. or so of salt and a couple dashes of pepper as well as a tiny bit of worchestershire sauce. Probably added 2 or 3 oz more of feta than the recipe called for. I also refrigerated the patties before grilling on a charcoal grill.  I suggest serving these on onion sandwich buns with lettuce, tomato, & mayo. My guests were all so excited when I suggested serving them on the onion buns...and seemed to think they "made" these burgers.

My kids really liked this I added sauteed vidalia and garlic, reduced fat feta and I threw in leftover spinach. I also added a little oregano. The kids ate these and hubby and I ate the Mushroom Blue Cheese Turkey Burgers on this site. I scaled the recipes down and made 2 of each kind using one pack of extra lean ground turkey. This is also a winner for us! My kids enjoyed this burger. Thanks!

I followed the recommendation of another review to add some worcestershire sauce. The finished burgers were a big hit and I will definitely be making them again soon!

These turkey burgers turned out a lot better than I expected. It was a nice departure from the plain ole' turkey burgers I normally make. I sauteed a bag of organic baby spinach and garlic in a Tablespoon of olive oil. I cooled it down and set it aside. I used one pound of foster farms turkey burger, 1 egg, beaten, 2 cloves of garlic, minced,freshly ground black pepper, and I added the cooled sauteed spinach mixture to the turkey meat. I mixed it well in a bowl and I let it sit in the refrigerator for for a while before grilling. I made about 5 turkey burgers which was good enough for three people tonight. I thought the feta cheese would be overpowering but it wasn't. The feta and spinach complemented each other well adding a nice balance of flavors. Turkey burgers were juicy and had the right amount of seasoning. I served this on some hamburger buns along with a little organic baby spinach I reserved. To complete the meal I made, "Baked Sweet Potato Sticks," also from this website.

I have cooked this twice. Once using tradintonal beef and once using turkey. The turkey burgers were ok, but when using regular beef they were fantastic!

I'm trying to incorporate less red beef into my husband's diet and this turkey burger has been a big hit!   I make exactly as the recipe states and serve on pita bread with sprouts, tomatoes, and Tzatziki Sauce I from this site.  You get a nice crust on the outside of the burger, but, it stays juicy and moist on the inside.

Mmmm....Delicious!! I started making them and halfway through I discovered that I didn't have any cheese. Even without the cheese they were great!! I used fresh spinach, doubled the garlic, and added some chicago steak seasoning. Next time I will be sure I have some feta cheese!! I am sure they would taste even better. Thanks for sharing:)
P.S.( Would be a five-star, but I wanted to wait and try it with the feta added.)

We love this recipe!  We love it as burgers but tonight I fried garlic, chopped onions, chopped mushrooms, and fresh spinach then mixed it with turkey, Worcestershire sauce, feta, and bread crumbs and baked as a meatloaf. My husband loved it, said I could make it every week!  Thanks!

These burgers were superb! I added some sun-dried tomatoes to the meat along with a pinch of salt, some black pepper, a little more fresh garlic & a little garlic powder. Everyone loved them. Served them on wheat buns with mayo, lettuce and red onion.   I'm sure they would be just as good baked.

Awesome!!!   I used 1 and 1/4 lb ground turkey ( becuase that is the size my store had), 1 egg and added  1-2 tsp oregano, all the rest kept to the recipe.  I did take advice and put them in the freezer 1 hour before grilling, the grilled fine, it made 4 large delicious burgers!!

Excellent for young toddlers!  I just made these for my 16-month old twins and they asked for more.  The only change I made was to eliminate the garlic (unless it's roasted, garlic is too strong for my little ones).  Thank you, thank you for sharing this extremely delicious and versatile recipe.

great burgers.  we added the worstershire as recommended in other reviews.  and i also added about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs.  they are kind of sticky compared to beef burgers so the bread crumbs helped a bit.  don't place on direct heat on grill or they will stick.  one of ours tore up pretty good.  kind of place them around the middle of the heat at least until they get partially cooked.

These were fantastic!  I followed the advice of other reviews and put them in the freezer for about half an hour before cooking them, and they turned out delicious.  One thing, though, is that they ended up HUGE.  I halved the recipe--made four patties--and ended up breaking them all up into halves or thirds while I was cooking them (in a pan, not on a grill).  I can't even imagine what an absurdly large amount of leftover burgers I would've ended up with if I'd done the original 8-serving recipe.  It's good for leftovers (and these will DEFINITELY get eaten!), but I wasn't expecting these to make so much.

I love this recipe! I usually just cook for myself, but I made a full recipe of these, made individual patties, and froze them so I can eat these whenever I want! (They freeze really well.) I like to eat these on toasted buns with sauteed red onions and roasted red peppers on top. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was a winner!  I  added extra feta cheese to the meat mixture which just gave it extra deliciousness :) -- I just used the entire 6 oz container vs. just 4 oz.  Can never have enough feta, really, right?   I used the box of the frozen chopped spinach but felt it could use a bit more so also chopped two-three large handfuls of fresh baby spinach into the mixture as well.  I then added a little Worchester and Dijon mustard (two heaping tea spoons)  to the meat mixture as well.   I made a homemade Tzsatziki sauce and the burgers on a bed of baby spinach tossed in olive oil and fresh squeezed lemon, along with a side of fresh heirloom tomatoes chopped with red onion also lightly tossed in olive oil, salt, pepper and fresh squeezed lemon.  Served with warm pita's cut into quarters.  Healthy and delicious.  A great summer meal!!!

These were excellent! I made a half a recipe, realizing I only had 1 lb of ground turkey. I used 90% lean blend. The burgers had such a meaty flavor. I liked the lack of bread crumbs. I defrosted the spinach in the fridge. Realizing some was still frozen. I just cooked it, as is, 5 minutes in the microwave, rinsed, and squeezed dry. Only thing I added was a pinch of black pepper and 2 pinches of garlic salt. I also used 2 garlic cloves being as they were small. I did grill them as suggested, but used an additional grill component normally used for small vegetables, as these were a little soft raw. I also used the garnishes depicted, lettuce, tomato, and red onion. I got 7 burgers with half the recipe. ty Note: Made today again, but I broiled them. Lined a sheet pan with foil, sprayed it with PAM, and the burger with olive oil. Started broiler on high and finished off at low temp. They were still very good and juicy. Instead of a bun this time, I served on top of a salad with romaine lettuce, shredded carrots, 1/4 cubed avocado, and 1 Tblsp. of Bolt house farms yogurt ranch. Salad = 107 calories, burger = 131 calories each as made above. This recipe is a keeper!

This makes a regular appearance at dinner now. My boyfriend was very skeptical at first because they looked too "healthy". However, he quickly changed his mind and went for seconds. I did make it with fresh spinach because that's what I had on hand and I've only made it like that. I also did add a little Kung Pao sauce to each patty before taking it out of the pan. It gave it a nice zing. Amazing recipe with or without the Kung Pao sauce!

Yummy! I loved these burgers. I cooked some onion and fresh spinach before adding it to the turkey. I also used ground turkey breast which is more lean and so they really stuck to the grill grates. I had made a double batch, so while the first set of burgers were cooking I added a little olive oil to the remaining mix, put it in the freezer so they were easier to handle and that worked much better! Also, I used tomato and basil feta, which added another layer of taste. I will definately keep this around for my summertime fare. Thanks!

Delicious! These had wonderful flavor and texture. I prepared the burgers, then let them sit for about half an hour. They held together very nicely. Served in pita bread with lettuce, tomato, and 'Tzatziki Sauce' from this site. Thanks for the recipe! :)

I've made these with sundried tomatoes and they gave it a good burst of flavor. I've also made them w/out sd tomatoes and it's great either way. My children like these with flat buns and the black bean salad.  This is a great family friendly dish. Thank you for posting it.

Kids loved these. Husband thought that they were just ok.  Still think that "Actually Delicious Turkey Burgers" are better but this was a nice change and I liked the healthy addition of spinach.
** Made these again for guests, they were a huge hit. I added sauteed red onions, used fresh spinach which I also sauteed and they wer great.  Everyone loved!! (including my husband.)

Just made these for dinner. They were great. Fiance loved them and is so looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow! They could have used a bit more seasoning. I sauteed fresh spinach with 3 garlic gloves first, then mixed it in with all of the other ingredients. Added a tiny bit of salt and pepper while they were cooking too. I tried to use my foreman grill but they weren't grilling as nicely as they were in the saute pan....so I finished cooking all of them in the pan.

Tried this last night for dinner.  As I'm watching calories, and don't have a grill, I cooked the burgers on my stove, used cooking spray and used egg-beaters instead. Added some onion flakes and a pinch of salt and pepper. Put the burger atop a salad and was very satisfied!  Thanks for the recipe!

I make turkey burgers often, using a few recipes from this site. I thought I would look for a new one, and found this recipe. Wow!! So good!! I make it as the recipe states, only sauteing fresh spinach  instead of using frozen. I have actually made this 2-3 times already. The first time, I made Tzatziki sauce to go with them as other reviews mentioned, which added a whole new dimension to the burgers. P.S. Just baked them in a 350 degree oven for 30 mins. or so.

I made a pound of ground turkey and was able to make six patties.  The spinach and feta adds more volume to the mixture so I was able to make more than just four patties.  Also, I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the mixture before I put it in the fridge for an hour.  I cooked them on the stovetop, five minutes each side, and they turned out great!!!

These are yummy! I halved the recipe and it made 4 good sized burgers. I added some lemon juice and worcestershire sauce as some suggested. I also added 1/4 cup of plain bread crumbs to combat the  jiggly issues others mentioned. They were firm and held together well, yet juicy and tender. I served them in pita bread with Tzatziki sauce. Excellent! I will make these often.

Very good... nice and moist! Although, even though I added worchester sauce, italian seasonings, chopped onion and pepper, I thought it could use a little more flavor. In addition to the seasonings, I used 5 oz of fresh spinich, I only used one egg and about 2 tablespoons of Italian breadcrumbs. I served these on onion rolls with lettuce, tomato, mayo and mustard (you'd think it wasn't lacking flavor!) Also, someone gave great advice about how to grill these burgers! Place a patty on the grill and leave it undisturbed for 10 minutes before flipping it. Cook an additional 10 minutes on the other side. Also, we used Pam on the grates. 

We have 6 left over so they're in the freezer for next time!

Delicious.  We used 1 lb turkey, 2 eggs, garlic, 4 oz feta, fresh spinach and a little worcestershire sauce.  Then we let it sit about 30 min, and then cooked on the stove.  Thanks for the recipe.  We tried turkey burgers before and they were too dry.  These were very moist.

WOW!    I have never left a review yet but this recipe deserves one.  I couldnt believe how good these were. My husband who is a pretty picky eater loved them.  He couldn't believe he was eating healthy and it was delicious.  The only change I made was replacing eggs with 1/2 cup egg beaters.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Delicious! I didn't have spinach, but I did add caramelized onions and garlic. I fried these in a pan and the parts where the feta browned on the pan were extra yummy. All of my kids ate these! Thanks for a great recipe. I'll definitely make these again.

I want to start off saying that I will be making this again my boyfriend and I loved it!!! I did add more feta cheese and more spinach, I also added onion minced. I sauted half of the mixture of onion and garlic after it was minced and sauted half to a fourth of the spinach. I added different seasoning and i got lucky of not putting too much. I only made 4 servings and I used olive oil in my frying pan. I dont really know how to cook on the grill well so i stayed away from that. But it turned out very well and I will make it again but add my own little twist.

These were delicious. The first time I made them they tasted kind of dry so I omitted the spinach the next time I made them. Definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

Exceptional good, I use fresh spinach usually, pepper, some Italian seasoning and worstershire sauce!  I have made it following the recipe as written and it is very good just like that, but we like a little extra flavor.  Thank you for the recipe!

These were easy to make and my family really liked them. Served with tzatziki on top, lettuce and tomato, with sides of sweet potato fries and corn. Thanks for the recipe!

Not that this needs more reviews, but this was a hit tonight with my family! Used fresh spinach, chopped (it's what I had in the house!) and added a little lemon juice, and 2-3 tbsp plain breadcrumbs (it was a little too wet...) Topped them with a little fresh tomato, red onion, and a garlic-dill mayo. Will definitely try with a tzatziki (sp?) next time. I think it would make them even better!

Very good - and healthy! I threw in a few shakes of italian bread crumbs to thicken/dry up the raw meat since it seemed a little loose to form into patties. Next time I think I will add a little more italian seasoning and maybe sun dried tomatoes. A keeper for sure.

This is a great idea but the recipe needs a little more.  I add a little pepper along with a generous amount of ranch dressing mix (the powder).  My husband, who refuses to eat spinach, loves these burgers!  Good stuff :)

Very good - I added some onion powder, and about 1.5 tbsp of bread crumbs.  Mine did stick, even though I grilled them on Pam'ed tin foil sheets, but they are still very tasty.  I think they could use more than 2 gloves of garlic....maybe even some parm cheese?   I foresee jalapeno peppers mixed in the next batch!

I used only one pound of ground turkey breast and ended up with 5 patties.  Instead of frozen spinach I sauteed a bag of fresh spinach with onion and garlc powder.  I also chose to throw that in the food processor with a handful of fresh parsley so it would blend well with the meat.  I only added S&P and a bit of onion salt to the mixture.  I pan fried these for about 6 min per side and they came out beautifully..  Thanks SO much for the great recipe.

These burgers are really tasty.  My family raved about them.  I had read the reviews and added  bread crumbs and s&p only to have the burgers be a little too dry and salty for me. Next time I will follow the recipe as written and see how that goes. I also want to try them with Tzatziki sauce and see if that adds a bit of zing as well. Overall a great recipe--5 stars for this family!

I was surprised by how bland these were.  I love spinach and feta, but somehow they just disappear in this recipe.  I even added onion, some Worchestershire sauce, paprika, and lemon and still no flavor!  I thought with the feta, they wouldn't need salt, but they definitely do.  Good thing I made some tzatziki and had them on homemade pita bread or I wouldn't have eaten them at all.

Very good!  Hubby wasn't impressed when I told him what was for dinner, but he was smiling when he tasted this burger and went back for seconds. Served with Tzatziki sauce and Greek Tomatoes on the side.  Grill is on the fritz, so baked them in the oven.  Delicious!!!

These. things. are. BOMB! Even feta hating boyfriend loved them*. 4 stars because I changed just a tad - chopped basil and jalepeno in food processor and mixed in with the rest. Added a little worcestershire sauce. Also found them to be a little wet - so I added bread crumbs. Letting them sit in the fridge for a few hours def. helped.  These will be a summer time staple! (*I lied about the feta - what he doesn't know won't kill him!)

Used 12 oz  bag of spin, 1 lb turkey, 4 cl  pressed garlic, one egg, and added 1T W sauce.  Guessing the eggs are to bind.  I considered using no egg but used one to distributed the garlic.  When making any turkey burger try this.. Use a sheet of heavy duty foil and cover your grill grate.  Then use a pencil to poke holes at uniform intervals.  Remove foil ,or if using a smaller charcoal grate bring the whole thing back inside,  then place raw turkey patties directly on the foil or foil covered grate.  Once the first side firms up they are easy to flip and no chance of your burgers falling thru onto the fire/coals.

Very tasty - a nice, different approach to burgers.  I would eat this on a leafy green salad with balsamic dressing.  Great, light meal.

I have never had a turkey burger before but I am trying to eat better so I thought I would give these a shot.  WOW!! I am so glad I did. DELICIOUS!  I used fresh Spinach and sautéed it with a minced clove of garlic and 1/2 of a medium onion diced.  I also added 1/2 cups bread crumbs.  The mixture was still hard to make into patties so I put the mixture in the refrigerator for 1 hour.  It was much easier to form into patties.  I then placed the patties in-between parchment paper and into a freezer bag.  I froze them over night for our picnic the next day. We grilled them and put a little bit of mayo with lettuce, tomato, onion and avocado on them.  VERY GOOD!

these were a huge hit...definitely didn't need a bun or condiments! i had some fresh spinach so i cooked that instead of using the frozen kind and i added some onions for a little extra flavor. the burgers were a "drippy" so a baked them in the oven first for about 10 minutes on 400 to keep them from falling apart on the grill. i will definitely make these again!

These are great when made as the recipe states and are a good base to play around with different vegetables.  I have added kalamata olives, roasted red peppers and roasted asparagus (roasted and mixed with raw meat).  I also add 1-1/2 t salt and pepper to the mix and season one side w s&p when cooking. I found that the added veggies make the burger more fragile (and very big) so I use a fry pan spayed w EVOO, med high heat cover them 6 minutes per side, then cut them in half and fry the cut side another minute or 2. Seems the more bulky veggies added the longer the cook time.

This was sooooo great!  It was the first time my 3 year old had spinach.  And she didn't even know it.  She loved it.  My husband and I gobbled them up too.  A simple sauce that went great - plain yogurt, minced garlic, diced cucumber, little lime juice, salt, and pepper. Yummy!  
This recipe is so easy, I gave it to my friend over the phone, for her to make for a last minute guest.

the whole family loved this dish! easy and fast, It was even better the next day for lunch. I covered the pattys with plastic then rolled them pretty flat, a little trick i learned from Alton brown stuck them in the freezer for 20 min so they wouldnt fall apart, just great!

very very tasty and extremely easy to make. i added a bit of breadcrumbs to keep everything together, tossed them in the skillet to brown them a little bit, then baked them. it was grilling weather. all in all very tasty. 
also added a dash of onion powder and a dash or garlic powder.

I made this recently for dinner and it was a huge hit.  Definitely a keeper.  Instead of using the frozen spinach I sautéed fresh spinach in a skillet with olive oil, kosher salt, and fresh ground pepper.  I let it cool completely then chopped it up before adding it to the meat mixture.

I saw this recipe as a Facebook video and saved it. it was so good! I used canned spinach to get it out of my cabinet, so I'm sure the Frozen or fresh would be even better. I topped with tzaziki. boyfriend loved it too.

I used raw spinach vs. Frozen, it really locks in a good amount of moisture.

Big hit!!  My husband is not a fan of turkey burgers; however, he absolutely LOVED these.  I used a 6 ounce container of feta and it was not overpowering.  I did use fresh spinach as I did not have frozen.   Took one for lunch the next day and it reheated perfectly!  Will definitely be making these again.

Well almost.  I made it into a meatloaf.  I want to cut the bread.  I added green onions, and baked it in the oven for 1.5 hrs.  Delicious!

I used fresh chopped baby spinach instead of frozen and a splash of worcestershire.  I thought I would need to add bread crumbs but after chilling in refrigerator for an hour it was perfect. Topped with store bought tzatziki sauce, cucumbers, lettuce and tomatoes. Everyone including grandkids loved them. Our new favorite burger for sure.

Made for my sisters Memorial Day cookout and they were a hit. The only things I did different was added salt, pepper and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce for a more beef like taste.

Fabulous! Super flavorful and really easy to make but very wet. Ended up freezing them for an hour or they would have disintegrated on the grill. Served as suggested with tzatziki and tomato on a soft bun. Absolutely amazing. This recipe makes a lot of burgers, at least 8.

I already wrote a review on this particular food but I forgot to mention that for some reason every time I warm them back up in the microwave my house smells like marijuana no I don’t know if it’s the spinach that I’m using or it’s the combination Of ingredients but other than the smell of dope they’re really good and I would recommend making them to anybody

I made these with Ground Chicken Breast and they were delicious.  I found them to be "soupy" when I was making them so decided instead of grilling them on the grill i did them in my grill pan on the stove.  The actually cooked quite well.   I added a few drops of Westchester Sauce.  Served them on a pita with Tzatziki Sauce.  Will make them again.

You do have to include the fact that the spinach will effect the cooking time if you want a drier burger. I like these served on bed of mixed salad with tomatoes because they are very juicy unless I have some homemade brioche buns to serve them on.

Loved them. I've made them two times and I baked them in the oven ( I don't own  a grill). I also added worcestershire  sauce because I like the flavor it adds.They are delicious. Saving this recipe as my  "go to" recipe for turkey burgers.

I first made these as written, but felt it needed more "Greek" taste so I added fresh Greek Oregano and Rosemary.  That made them perfection.  My hubby is on a low carb diet, so I made his larger and served over a simple salad.  Next time I will try it with ground lamb.

I cooked this exactly as the recipe called for minus the garlic, this time. We were going out later so excluded it. Very good, froze the extras for another day.

I liked these as-is! I served with grilled red onion and homemade (thrown together) tzatziki sauce on a burger bun. Family didn't love it, but I did! Would be a little dry without some sauce with it.

Super tasty, would make again!  My only complaint is that I couldn't taste the feta- perhaps try adding that on the top of the burger when it's done instead.  Otherwise, great, easy to make recipe and still tastes great when the patties are stored in the freezer and thawed!

Used a bag of fresh spinach sauteed
Good on flatbread with tzatziki, onions, tomato
 Maybe use a grill pan or cook on stove- pretty sticky
add some worcestershire

These turkey burgers have become a favorite at our family BBQs.  I use fresh baby spinach (slightly more than 10oz) and I put in  8-10oz of feta cheese.

Loved this recipe! I've never made turkey burgers before and was a little worried they would be dry but the were the most moist burgers I've had and the meat was 97% lean! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of cutting it in half because I only had a pound of meat and used fresh spinach. Can't wait to share with friends!

The only change I made was to cook in a frying pan instead of on the grill.  These burgers were so easy to make and so delicious.  You have to try them.

I did half the recipe, and it turned out so good!! I also used fresh spinach and just chopped it up.
I also made an "easy Taztiki Sauce" which is also a recipe on this site (many to choose from) to put on it, with whole wheat buns, cucumbers,onions and tomatoes on it. It was super yummy and fresh tasting!

Made these for the 4th of july. Added more garlic and half a chopped onion.  The mixture was a little wet,  and i was worried about them falling apart so i baked them in the oven then browned them on the grill.

THESE WERE FANTASTIC. Usually I stay away from turkey burgers but these were wonderful!Normally turkey burgers can be dry but these were very juicy. The two changes I made were I used 6oz of feta instead of 4oz and I used fresh spinach and chopped it myself.

This burger came out phenomenally, even my three year old gobbled it up and wanted more! I added onion and garlic powder, pink salt, pepper, and parsley...we broiled half and pan friend half. The broiled ones came out better and more flavorful. This is so delish, I didn't even need any condiments, just the plain burger paired with a simple salad.

Excellent recipe,the flavors of each ingredient compliment each other very well. I added about 1/2 cup of itallian bread crumbs to stiffen the mixture, it did not change the flavor, and pattied up very well. I cooked them on the stove top with a little olive oil, and they were awesome. Can't wait to make them on the grill this summer!:-)

We don't like turkey burgers but we love these. My daughter said she preferred them over beef burgers. Now I want to try to make them into meatballs. Does anyone have any suggestions. Like maybe add breadcrumbs or panko?

Accidentally purchased blue cheese instead of feta...but it didn't matter, they were still amazing! I also didn't have any garlic cloves on hand so I used the refrigerated crushed garlic in the tube and added a little extra per suggestions of other reviewers. Loved these and will be making again and again!

I scaled this recipe down since I only needed 4 portions. I started by sauteing a couple of finely-chopped baby bella mushrooms, a thinly-sliced green onion, and about 1.5 tsp of minced garlic in a bit of olive oil, then I added 5 ounces of still-frozen chopped spinach & cooked until it was warm and wilted. I transferred it to a bowl and added 1 beaten egg, 1 lb of ground turkey, 2 oz of feta, and a large dash each of salt, pepper, paprika, and Italian seasoning, along with about a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce and a couple of teaspoons of olive oil. I formed 4 large, very soft and goopy patties and refrigerated for about 30 minutes. I cooked them on a panini press with griddle plates (sprayed w/Pam) over medium-high heat for about 12 minutes. I served them on whole-wheat burger buns with lettuce, tomato, and tzatziki sauce. The taste was nice but could have used even more seasoning. The texture was tender and juicy. The portions were huge - I think I could have made 5 or 6 burgers out of the meat mixture, since the patties did not shrink at all during cooking. Overall the meal was fairly quick & easy, and healthier than a traditional burger, but not terribly flavorful. If I make this again I will use more feta, garlic, and seasonings.

I love this recipe.  My husband wants me to make this every week.  I leave out the egg (did it by accident one time and didn't notice a difference, so I don't bother now) and use ~6 oz of tomato and basil feta.  I saute the minced garlic (upped to 4 cloves) and spinach a few minutes on the stove before adding to the rest of the mixture. Per other reviewer suggestions, I add worcestershire (few tablespoons maybe) and some basil and paprika (~1 tbsp each).  Plus some salt and pepper.  I form the patties then stick in the freezer for at least an hour. The batch makes enough for two meals for my family, and when I cook up the second half, I just cook them on the stove straight from the freezer.

I love this recipe! I also did what others did, sauteed the minced onion until a little brown, added the minced garlic and then added the spinach. Cooked until it was wilted. (then cool, and add to bowl of turkey and the rest of the ingredients). I also tried this with KALE, and I loved it too! I also added chili pepper flakes, thyme, and a dash of cumin. Also, I added a little Turmeric for color. And the number ONE ingredient to add is a little smokey flavoring, like mesquite steak seasoning or something similar.  Another thing is I pan fried the patties (after being in the fridge for an hour), on medium high, and got a really good dark brown coat before turning over. Dark brown "fond" on each side, makes them really good!!  (I chopped up the spinach/kale before cooking). I also added 1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs.

These were very good but it seemed like there was a spice or two missing. Followed the recipe exactly but did not eat it with the Tzatziki sauce. Cooked on the grill. I did refrigerate the meat prior to cooking since they are a little soft.

I just made this recipe for dinner and it was a huge hit. I added 1 tsp dried basil and 1 tbs of Worcestershire sauce to the mix. I also baled the patties in a 400 degree oven for 30 minutes, as it is too cold to use the grill.  They came out perfectly. This will be added to our menu.

These were very moist and tasty. I followed recipe exactly, except I added a little bit of Worcestershire sauce and some fresh lemon juice (could't taste the lemon), plus salt, pepper, and paprika. I also used fresh spinach (about 5 oz) sauteed with a bit of oil and the garlic. I allowed mixture to sit in fridge for a few hours before forming into patties, and then again for an hour or so after I shaped into patties; this firmed them up. We served on whole wheat buns with tomato and grilled onion. Very good and a nice change from beef; they filled you up but didn't make you feel heavy. Would make again.

This tasted really good, but were so difficult to grill, we ended up finishing them in the oven.  I even put the burgers in the freezer for nearly an hour before grilling based on other reviews.  I think they may need another binder other than just the eggs.  Maybe bread crumbs or flax seed?  I sautéed fresh spinach, onion and garlic and let it cool before adding it to the turkey.

VERY, VERY, VERY bland, even with the addition of basil, oregano and lemon.  Needs something to add a "kick"(maybe serve with a balsamic dressing or add balsamic vinegar to the mix with italian bread crumbs???).   For flavor I would give it one star, but giving the recipe two stars overall because the burgers are visually appealing (nice way to sneak spinach into the family diet). If you are looking for a turkey burger recipe that will make beef lovers feel good about converting, this is NOT it (recommend the Chipotle Burger recipe from this site).

These were pretty good! Before putting the patties on the BBQ I was sure they would fall apart, but they held their shape really well. The taste was good. I would add more garlic next time and perhaps some other spices, but otherwise pretty tasty. I served them on toasted whole wheat buns with tzatziki, a tomato and some extra feta. Definitely a healthier alternative to your traditional beef burger.

This was great. I didn't put all of the spinach in because I heard they fall apart easily with all the water... I baked them and they did not fall apart. I would put more spinach in next time. I could taste the feta, but not the spinach. My boyfriend could taste the spinach, but not the feta. It was my first time doing something different to the meat part of the burger, and it was refreshing.

5 out of 5.

Excellent addition to my annual "Burgerfest".

I used fresh spinach from the garden, which I chopped up into smaller pieces, and tried not to add any stems, leaves only.

The feta I added was cut into smaller chunks and not crumbled.  This made nice little feta cheese pockets in the burgers.

I built these at around 10 a.m. and grilled at 3:30, they were refrigerated during that time, and were a little soft for grilling, but grilled up just fine.

Sprinkled a little Greek seasoning on them while grilling and served with Tzatziki sauce.

These were a huge hit, thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic recipe as is! Work great in the oven if you don't have time for the grill.  My husband, toddler and mother all really enjoyed them.

When I feed these burgers to my family who hate spinach they loved them.  I never thought they would try them much less request them at least every two weeks I make them.  This has become their favorite burger.  I do cook them in the oven and they turn out great we are going to try the grill over the summer.

These were really flavorful. I would give it five stars for flavor, but only four for the recipe as written because I had to modify it. I halved the recipe and used 1.25 pounds of ground turkey. With one egg the mixture was really loose. I had to add in some bread crumbs to absorb the excess moisture. As a result, I suggest that if people are making the recipe with two pounds of turkey, then they should start with one egg and only add the second one if needed. 

I broiled these instead of grilling them and they finished in 10 minutes.

Literally the best burger I've ever put in my mouth.  Seriously, it's that good.  And quite simple to make, also!  This one's definitely going to be a regular favorite of mine.   I did use fresh spinach, which I'm sure added to it.

I LOOOOOOVE this.  I make it all the time, and I often don't even serve it on a bun, but just serve the patties with ketchup for dipping on the side.  Great flavor and I love knowing I'm serving something healthy.

I made these into sliders instead of full sized burgers, and added onion and mushrooms that I had sauteed in butter and put in the food processor since I only had 1 Lb of turkey. A splash of wortershire, and minus the eggs. These were a total hit with my kids and my husband. Score!

Totally delicious and even the hubby liked it.  He's very difficult to please.  I added 1 tablespoon of onion, and a half teaspoon of basil, salt, pepper and lemon as others have suggested.

Never was a real big fan of turkey burgers, but still like them enough to try this recipe. Very nice! I threw in some sun dried tomatoes and sauteed some onions. Also threw the formed patties in the fridge for an hr or so. No propane in the grill, so I stove top cooked them in the frying pan. It turned out delicious, and will definitely keep it in my recipe book. Thanks!

I added a little Worcheshire (sp?) sauce and Spike seasoning.  Otherwise I stuck with the recipe. Since it's not grilling season, I cooked mine in the oven.  It turned out great. I enjoyed it with the Tzatziki Sauce I and lettuce, while my children put lettuce, onions and other traditional condiments on theirs.  Another hit at our house. Can't wait to try them on the grill.

Very good. I put it on a sandwich thin with lettuce and tomato as suggested. it is really good.
Definitely a keeper. If you are a weight watchers member this is 7 points without the bread.

Awesome burger.  Used indoor grill and they didn't stick nor fall apart.  Sauteed onions and garlic in olive oil and then added chopped fresh spinach.  I also used 3 lbs of ground turkey as the mixture seemed very mushy.

I am so disappointed! I thought these flavors would be fantastic, but I was not happy with the way it turned out.  I followed the recipe to a T and made sure to get every last drop of extra moisture out of the spinach so they wouldn't be slimy...they were just too bland.

Excellent!!  I would've rated it 5 stars if the turkey meat were more firm.  I had to line the grill with aluminum foil just to cook properly.  But that was expected with turkey meat!

I thought this was great!  I love classic beef burgers, so I am always skeptical of a turkey burger, but this was delicious and quite healthy.  As others suggested, I also added a dash of Worcestershire sauce, and used tzaziki sauce as the condiment.  The mix was rather mushy as others noted.  I didn't want to wait for them to chill and firm up, so I just tossed in a good dose of wheat germ to make them stick together better.  (I halved the recipe and needed about 4 tbs of wheat germ.)  I will definitely make this again :)

I'm not a burger person, but I do love feta. I only used half the amount of spinach. 10 oz. seemed liked too much. I added some oregano, onion flakes and basil. I really liked this but the rest of the family who are beef burger eaters didn't think so much of it. The feta comes through very mild. I definitely recommend adding some greek spices. Kale works as a substitute but fat free feta is tasteless.

This is my first time reviewing a recipe  It was incredible!  Did make a few changes for my family's taste... used light feta cheese, 1/2 cup onion, fresh chopped spinach, 2 tablespoons of bread crumbs and a variety of spices.  It was amazing!  Will definitely become a repeat meal in our house.

The first time I made these, I followed the recipe exactly and they were falling apart and very bland.  I made them again, using just the egg whites of the 2 eggs, adding some bread crumbs and seasoned salt.  I also used fresh spinach instead of the frozen.  They were much better after adding some seasonings!

Several folks who have eaten these have declared they are the best burgers they've ever had. They often are eaten cold for breakfast the next day. They have tons of flavor so condiments are not neccessary.

So, SO good!  Followed a few other reviewer by adding 1/4 cup of dry bread crumbs, oregano and of course, more garlic!  The other advice I took was to make the patties and freeze them.  I put waxed paper between the patties.  They cooked up beautifully!   The burgers are delicious and so tasty!  I will be making these again and again!

D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S So easy to make as well! I added some Mediterranean seasoning and served with tzatziki (Greek cucumber yogurt sauce) and on wheat Medit. style flat bread.  Big hit, can't thank you enough! Plus, even though I halved the recipe, it still made a lot.

I've taken these to a couple of barbecues this summer and they've been a real crowd pleaser.  Even got rave reviews from my sister, who isn't into trying new dishes. I throw in a little minced onion and some Mrs. Dash and serve on a whole weat bun.  Good stuff!

The only thing that I did different was that I added some black pepper to the mix. They turned out very well. My wife, who is not a fan of turkey burgers, had seconds!

These were absoultely juicy and delicious!  I made a few changes...I added some fresh chopped basil and oregeno, as well as some finely chopped vidalia onions to the mix.  I threw in a few pinches of greek seasoning (Cavenders) and an extra clove of garlic.  The patties seemed loose when I formed them, so I took a hint from Food Network and wrapped the patties individually in foil and placed them in the freezer for about 45 minutes so they would firm up before placing them on the grill.  Worked like a charm!  I topped them with Tzatziki sauce (from this website) and it was possibly the BEST thing I've ever cooked on my grill!  Definitely a crowd pleaser and I will be making them often!!!  Yummy!

I had high hopes for these burgers.  We love feta cheese and spinach.  I followed the original recipe and found that the burger had next to no flavor.  The texture of the burger was fine.  I don't think I will make these again.

Yum, yum, yum!!!  Can I rate these burgers with six stars?!? I followed this recipe to a "T" and loved them.  Buuuuuut......I think next time I will add some Crystal hot sauce.  Not because they needed it but because I LIKE it!!!  The options with these burgers are endless...jalapenos, diced green onions, chili pepper...endless options!!!  Thank you so much for a wonderful and healthy burger!  I figured each burger only had half an ounce of feta cheese which is nothing calorie wise!!!  Try them, change the cheese or the spinach, but try them!!!  I used ground turkey, not turkey breast, I think that helped them stay moist on the grill!!!  These will now be part of our menu rotation!!!

these are amazing! I added worchestire sauce and doubled the garlic. When they are hot the feta just melts in your mouth. I'll be making these all summer. Was thinking it would be delicious with an olive and tomato greek salad on the side.

These were delicious! I used basil instead of spinach, added some finely chopped white onion into the patties and topped them with melted swiss cheese, avocado and all the usual toppings. Also, I don't have a grill so I cooked them in a pan which worked just fine! They were exceptionally juicy and none of my friends even spoke while eating them. Awesome! They are quite squishy as all the other reviews said, but do not fear because once you get them in the pan they cook just fine, and I think that makes them extra juicy.

These could have been a bit more flavorful - I found a similar recipe that is to die for:  use only 1 1/3 lbs meat, add 1 tsp. dried oregano and 1 Tbl. grill seasoning to the meat mixture.  Note that you don't have to use eggs (I didn't, to cut down on the fat & cholesterol), and they still bind well.  I also use a topping made of 2 roasted red bell peppers, 1/4 cup fresh parsley, and 1/4 cup pitted kalamata olives (process all  in a food processor, then add salt & pepper to taste).  Thanks for the recipe!

Definitely a keeper. My 7 year old grandson loved them and ask me to make them again. I followed the recipe exactly as printed and had no problems. Makes sure you squeese the spinach dry and chop it more. I also refrigerated the burgers for 1 hour before putting on the grill. I brushed both sides with oil before grilling to prevent them from sticking..

These turned out wonderful.  I was worried about them falling apart on the grill, because the consistency seemed a little off but they held together.  Will make again!

Above was my original review.  I have changed my rating because we make these all the time.  There are only two of us so I freeze them individually (wrap in foil and place in ziplocs) and pop them on the grill when I need a quick entree.  Always good and healthy!!

Excellent and delicious.  Followed recipe as it called for.  Only change that I might make is add a little S&P to the mixture.  This one is for keeps.  Is excellent with or without Tzatziki sauce

Excellent!  A really nice change from a regular burger and very easy.  However, I do think the recipe needs to be tweaked a bit.  Next time I make this I will NOT use egg.  It was extremely moist made per the directions.  I added a significant amount of bread crumbs and refrigerated overnight to try and fix it, but the burgers were still a bit too moist for me.  They never quite got a firm burger consistency after cooking.  The only changes I made:  I cooked these in a pan over med-high heat instead of on the grill.  And I used fresh spinach that I wilted down in a pan with maybe 1/2 tbsp. of EVOO and sauteed in a bit of onion (and the garlic) when the spinach wilted down.  I don't think this contributed to the excess moisture in the burger, there was no more liquid than would have remained from squeezing thawed spinach from a box.  Can't wait to try again!

I followed the recipe exactly and the meat came out really sticky. It was hard to form into balls and grill without the meat falling through. Next time, I will try frying them in a pan to avoid the mess. But they tasted amazing! We used wheat buns, mayo and balsamic dressing as dipping sauce. Would definitely make again.

Maybe my expectations were too high, given the previous reviews, but these weren't as outstanding as I expected.  I found them to be pretty dry and a little tasteless, but the kids really loved them.  Made as directed, except added chopped kalamata olives, and broiled rather than grilling (which could be why they were dry).  Based on the rave reviews from the kids, and the ease of preparation, I will likely keep making these.  Thanks VbCook!

Everyone LOVES these burgers! I used fresh spinach, added the Worcestershire sauce that others recommended to spice up the flavor a bit and I cook them on the stove rather than the grill.  I know that my grandson can smell them from his house because he never misses out! He even takes home the leftovers for his lunchbox.

I didn't follow the recipe, but used it as a springboard for inspiration.  It was lunchtime, I had about two hours before class and still had homework to do before I got there.  I had ground turkey thawed and after a quick search, I found this recipe.  I threw together 1 lb ground turkey, spinach and feta (which I had leftover from other dishes). Then I added sprinkle kosher salt, blk pepper, garlic powder and mixed well.  Formed the mixture into patties and cooked over a stovetop grill, low and slow.  Here's my twist:  I sliced green apple very thinly and layered on bottom bun before placing burger on top of the apple.  A smear of mayo on the top bun finished the burger.   How'd it turn out you ask?  The apple added a little sweetness and some crunch that was otherwise missing (I forgot to pick up lettuce at the grocery).  They were the most delicious burgers I've ever eaten, and dear son asked for a second one!  Thanks so much for inspiring me and making by day a little easier!

Turned out beautifully! I followed another reviewer's example and added lemon juice (just a small amount, since this mixture tends to remain pretty soft and hard to keep held together once in patty form), a healthy amount of paprika, extra garlic, and basil.  I made them a couple of hours ahead of when I meant to cook them, so I put them on parchment paper and stuck them in the freezer until cooking time. It helped them firm up and be more easily handled.  Don't have a working grill presently, so I just cooked these on a griddle with a bit of olive oil.  They only took about 4 minutes to cook on each side.  My sweetie loved them when he came home from work and noted that the mixture of flavors was perfect and they were moist and tender.  Served with a mix of cucumbers, onions, and red bell peppers with light balsamic dressing on the side.

I didn't have any spinach so I did this with just feta and a few dashes of worcestershire and they were AWESOME!  Served up on toasted buns with lettuce, tomato and condiments!  Great!

It sounds like a great recipie but I was very dissapointed.  I didnt have the frozen chopped spinach so I hand chopped a whole 10 oz bag of spinach.  Too much work for such a poor recipie.

These were awesome!  I mixed up the meat mixture and let it sit in the fridge for a couple hours before making patties to let the flavors meld.  Nice!

i liked these just fine.  they are a nice change from the heavy burger.  it feels lighter, healthier, but still you feel full cuz it's still meat.   i paired it with the greek tortellini salad recipe from here (one of my favorites!) & you have a winner!

These are quick and delicious.  The salty Feta and the earthy spinach just seem to belong in ground turkey.  I added some salt, pepper, extra garlic and a pinch of oregano.  Yum-a-do.

This was an outstanding burger, the flavors all melded together PERFECTLY...even my kids loved it  ( 2, 4, and 7 all cleaned their plates!  An excellent way to sneak in spinach! ;)  The ONLY thing I did differently was add about 1/2 panko bread crumbs because it was too moist! Otherwise it was a good change for beef hamburger!

This one's a keeper!  I used some fresh baby spinach, just barely wilted, squeezed as dry as possible, then chopped.  Thought it had better flavor than frozen spinach, which always seems too stringy to me.  I used feta cheese with sundried tomato and basil, and added a bit of chopped red onion because I had some leftover from another recipe.  I almost added breadcrumbs - the turkey mixture was very mushy and moist - but glad I did not.  Held up well on the grill.  Burgers were very flavorful and moist - ate mine without any condiments on a whole wheat bun and it was delicious!

These were a little dry, but I think that may be because we used reduced-fat feta. We didn't use the recommended sauce and they were a bit bland. Perhaps carmelized onions would be a nice topping.

Made these into meatballs, which I cooked in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes but they  should get broiled at the end for a darker coating. Reminder that I need full 2 lbs of turkey to feed our family of 4.

Delicious!  I had fresh spinach so I used that sautéed with the garlic.  I also chopped up some mini bell peppers and added to the sauté, then after cooled added to the other ingredients.  I just pan fried them and they were delicious.  Love these!!

Added worcestshire sauce, paprika and chopped sundried tomatoes. I refrigerated them for an hour as some suggested but they were still very hard to handle. Next time I will try freezing them half way. Served with tzatziki sauce from this site. My husband and I loved them!

I made this recipe as directed, but cut it in half.  The feta cheese totally overwhelmed the taste. Perhaps another cheese would be a better choice.  I love feta, but not in this recipe.

I used half the amount of the ingredients, and was able to make 8 good sized patties.  Ate the patties with a salad (of chopped up red onion, tomato, cucumber, and jalapeno), kalamata olives,  hummus, and whole wheat naan.  It was delicious.

These are delicious! I skipped making tzatziki sauce but used a good dollop of greek yogurt on top. I'm always a little heavy on the garlic. These had great flavor without being over powering. I cooked them inside on my stovetop instead of grilling. I will definitely try these again!

Wonderful! For more detailed grilling instructions: freeze for 20 minutes first. Grill at 450 9 minutes on the first side, then flip and grill for another 6. Carefully spray the grate with cooking spray before putting on.

These tasted very good but, despite refrigerating the turkey mix for about 2 hours first, I had such as hard time shaping these into patties.  The mix was just too mushy. I used an organic ground turkey from Costco and it was a soft ground turkey to begin with so that may have been my problem. There was no way these would have survived the grill so I made them on a non-stick pan on the stove.  They firmed up fine once cooked but I literally had to gab a handful of the meat mixture and plop it on the pan then try to flatten it while on the pan. It was so sticky that it stuck to my hands too which made flattening it difficult.  Served it on tortillas with tzatziki sauce, sliced cucumbers and spinach leaves. I told my husband and two sons that I would not make this again and they all groaned and asked me please to make it again.  I couldn't believe it.  They loved it therefore I will try again and use a different turkey meat.  Maybe that was my problem.  BTW I did saute the garlic ( I don't like raw garlic) with a little onion and I used chopped baby spinach instead of frozen which I sauteed just a few seconds.

6/2019 - Very good, easy to pull together and cook up on the stove.  Great flavor, tasted healthy, everyone liked it.  I prefer the greek turkey burgers recipe on here over this one, tho.

I had bought some turkey burger, as I was in the habit of cooking up turkey chili, but the chili weather is gone now, and it's summer time, so I was trying to find a recipe that would spark up the turkey, and I chose this one. I wan't expecting much, as making a tasty turkey burger requires a lot. Well, I was pleasantly surprised, and the flavor of this burger was so good! I used canned spinach because I didn't have frozen, and I halved the recipe because I had just a pound of turkey. It had to be the combination of the spinach, the feta cheese and garlic that gave it such a delicious flavor. I didn't have the ingredients for the topping, so I just used a buttermilk dressing.  I froze the rest, but saved another for tomorrow! Soooo good!!

I don't have an outdoor grill, so I cooked the patties on a George Foreman grill instead; most of them fell apart on me. I would recommend anyone who lacks an outdoor grill to use a cast iron skillet as a substitute. Fry the patties in olive oil when using this equipment.

My kids liked this burger, so that's good; it will go into the rotation, but I thought it was a bit bland as written for my taste. I will add smoked paprika and more garlic next time. I served them on whole-wheat pitas with home made tzatziki.

I made this recipe and it came out so tasty. I added chopped onions, green and red peppers, and cooked mushrooms.  My dressing of choice was honey mustard and a little bit of mayo.  For bread, I used Naan bread nicely toasted.  It was so delicious that we are eating the same thing tomorrow since I had enough meet leftover.

Excellent burgers! I followed the recipe with the exception of using fresh spinach (about 8 oz's) and (6 oz's) of crumbled feta cheese.   
My husband normally does not like turkey burgers but loved these. They were moist and flavorful without the need to add salt. I will be making them again soon.

These were very flavorful and tender.  Turkey can be dry but the cheese sort of melted and countered the dryness.  I usually don't like feta cheese, but in the turkey burgers it added flavor and a cream texture.  No need to add salt, feta is salty enough.

Baked at 400° for 30 minutes on parchment paper and added red pepper flakes. Kronos pita bread bun replacement.  Definitely one I'd make again.

These were so good! I misread the recipe and added 4 eggs. I thought I was doubling it,  but it already called for two pounds of Turkey so I added about 1/2 cup of panko to dry it up a bit. I also had fresh spinach on hand and used that.  My husband loved them also.

Made as written and was very pleased with the burgers.  Not dry and very tasty.  I rolled them in bread crumbs before frying them on the stove.

Followed recipe exactly but baked at 350° F for 30 minutes instead of hrilling. I served these on warm pitas with tzatziki sauce. It was delicious!

Delicious and so easy! I think the feta helps keep them moist ! Cooked in a cast iron pan instead of the stove - added a little salt & pepper.

Made as directed, it was tasty but too dense to my liking. Next time I cooked, I just beat egg whites till their foam held its shape and folded into meat, which greatly improved texture for me. Cooked with thermometer till ready.  Adding feta to a burger was a brilliant idea that I have adapted for a meatloaf and sausage variations of this recipe. Having cooked this several times, I sometimes add a tsp of lime or lemon juice to brighten it up. Thank you for the idea.

My boys loved this burger.  They are learning to food prep and these have so few ingredients.  Bought the sauce and sliced cucumbers for the week.  Ate them for lunch every day. :)

Followed recipe exactly first time making these, they were good but needed a little something. Second time making I followed others reviewers suggestions and added extra garlic, chopped onion and worstershire sauce, as well as a bit of salt & pepper. Served on naan bread with Tzatziki sauce. This has become a favorite at our house!

I like the recipe with additional seasoning.
It is good but bland, you need to add any seasoning, heat you desire that will give the burgers a nice pop.
I cooked a couple of burgers for tasting and added seasoning to the remaining uncooked mixture.

Excellent. Nice change from the usual burger. I followed recipe exactly. It made 8 burgers and I froze 4. The frozen ones cooked great a couple of weeks later. The meat mix is mushy but firms up well when cooked. I used a grill mat because I wasn’t sure how well they would turn. They turned fine but I will continue to use the mat to avoid flare ups as they do drip a bit. They cook towards the lower time, I would say 7 minutes on each side. Served in a pocket with tzaziki and lettuce. Yum!

Not a lot of flavor. Had to add salt, pepper, more garlic. I also had to add a cup of bread crumbs to keep the meat from falling apart.

These turkey burgers turned out great. I was a little apprehensive about them holding together as the mix was quite mushy. Cooked up beautifully. I did cook them in oven due to thunder storm . Made according to recipe. Eight good sized burgers. I did not need eight but made extra to put in freezer. Easy to put together. Definitely a keeper.

We thought these burgers were absolutely delicious!  Like others, I sautéed the spinach with a small amount of diced onion and the garlic before adding to the meat mixture.  I served them in pita bread, with tzatziki sauce, lettuce, and tomato.  We will definitely make them again!

I’ve made these a few times and we’ve loved them! I used ground turkey that had been frozen and was a little more miost than I preferred when I mixed it with everything else so I needed to use a small amount of bread crumbs to hold the patties nicely together. We always go by less though so I didn’t feel guilty. Topped with some homemade guac and they’re so so good!!

Interesting recipe, and not bad. I added some paprika, lemon juice, basil, and Worcestershire sauce and served it with tomatoes, grilled onions, and honey mustard on a butter toasted bun. It was jiggly and crumbly to cook in the beginning, but it firmed up quite nicely. Somewhat bland tho.

Took suggestion of Nic from 2008 and added lemon juice, dried basil and more garlic. I made them into larger patties and only got 7 burgers instead of 8. The burgers were really tasty.

I made this with fresh spinach, added sweet onion - sautéed the onion and garlic, added the spinach until wilted.  Also put in a touch of lemon juice and a couple of shots of worcestershire sauce.  Served it in a nan with alfalfa sprouts, chopped fresh tomatoes and of course, Taziki sauce.  I did put them in freezer for about 30-40 mins before cooking on the grill.  That helped a little but you definitely need to oil the grill before cooking.  They were very tasty.

I'm on a very low carb (not keto) diet so I did not have this with any kind of bread.  I simply put my burger on a bed of raw spinach and added some tomato.  I used the sauce as kind of a "dressing".  FABULOUS!

I was running late and didn't make the sauce mentioned.  I found a cucumber dill dip mix on sale (where you only add sour cream) and opted for that instead just due to time.  

These will definitely be made in our house again!  (I made sure I got the leftovers for work today... they're MINE! lol)

These were really good! I hate when people review a recipe but have completely changed it, so I followed the recipe with one exception, instead of frozen spinach I used fresh. And I felt like the patties were a bit “mushy” so I added a little bit of panko bread crumbs. We live in an apartment so I cooked them under the broiler but they will be great this summer on the grill!

Love these easy to make burgers!  Great change of flavor from beef burgers.  I  love the ease of making new adjustments to the original recipe; Naan bread, lettuce or Brussel sprouts, flavored Feta cheese, cherry tomatoes and of course Tzatziki and sliced cucumbers! If in a hurry, just toss the meat and spices in  a skillet - great filler.

This was delicious! I added some chopped onion, some chopped kalamatas, and some EVOO. Added more EVOO to each side of the burgers when flipping on the grill. Topped with blue cheese, avocado slices. Heaven!

I used ground pork, fresh spinach (cooked) and sweet heat feta for the first batch. Served tzatziki sauce over the patties sans bun with a fresh salad - oooooohhhhhhhh these are good!

Too spicy for the kids though, so second batch was regular feta. Good, but not AS good. Perhaps a flavored feta (without the spice) will perfect batch number three.

The nutritional info surprised me,  since you're using ground turkey.   It does however, sound tasty.   I have not yet made this, so my rating  is not a fair one.... but I had to rate it in order to comment.

These burgers were so easy and a nice change. Pretty much made it as recipe states, added a few more spices and Worcestershire sauce. My husband enjoyed them too!!  Topped them with lettuce, tomato, red onions and sliced cucumbers.

These burgers are incredible! Sooo much flavor!  Since we really like garlic I threw in an extra clove. I tossed in about 1/4 cup plain dry breadcrumbs to help form the patties, and I chilled them in the fridge about 40 minutes after forming.  I used small naan loaves as the bun and shaped oblong patties, folding the naan over like a taco shell. I served with tzatziki  sauce and chopped tomatoes. Thanks for a great recipe!

My wife hates all of my ground turkey recipes because of “blah” flavors,  completely my fault. She was skeptical when I mentioned that I would be trying a different ground turkey dish but was she wrong! We absolutely love this recipe and will definitely be making this again!

Really liked this. I didn't read comments about cooling time. I baked them in the oven. Worked well. I plan to buy those grill sheets and try to do them on the grill.  We ate them between 2 mini Naan rounds. Mmmmm. Update: I bought to grill sheets and what a good way to do these!  Highly recommend.

Yummy! Used half an onion, chopped and sautéed that with the garlic and fresh spinach for a few minutes. I also added salt, pepper and Worchester Sauce to the meet. Formed 8 - 10 patties, brushed them with olive oil and baked them at 350F for 35 minutes.

Very dry, took advice of previous people who prepared this dish.  Added lemon juice, sun dried tomatoes.  Very dry taste like dry turkey burger.  I felt it was a very healthy food to eat though but for taste only 2 stars for me.

This was dinner tonight and man was it delicious! I used fresh spinach that I sautéed with the garlic and olive oil. It’s winter in New England so I used an indoor grill which didn’t seem to make a difference. Served in pita bread with Tzatziki sauce, extra feta and fresh spinach.. and YUM!!

I added cracked red pepper , salt and black paper to the mix.  The mix is definitely sticky and difficult to form patties. I wet the palms of my hands with water and it helped.  Next time I will use evvo on my hands.  I' sure it will only add to the deliciousness!  I also let the patties sit in the frig for about 30 minutes to help firm up as other posters suggested.  I used my George Foreman grill 'cause it's below 30 here! I served with romaine lettuce, tomatoes and red onions.  Didn't have time to make the tzatziki sauce.  Next time for sure.  Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful recipe! Followed instructions with NO changes. Served with a Greek Salad with additional feta cheese, olives, etc.. No problem with the. consistency as one cook posted. I  chilled my burger mixture, for several hours before forming.

Fantastic and easier when baked in the oven since they are flimsier and softer than a beef burger. I’ve done them on the grill as well but prefer oven baked since they hold together better. Very tasty and so easy!!

I followed the recipe exactly and my mixture was a sloppy mess that fell through the grill grates. I tried to salvage the rest by putting what was left of the patties in the oven. Let's just say this was not a success. Not sure what I did wrong. The bits that did cook tasted great, so I know it has great potential!

Very easy and good recipe.  I usually make up a batch, separate into individual patties and then freeze.  So I can grab one and cook as needed.

These were GREAT!  I blended the meat a day ahead of time (with fresh spinach and a little bit of panko crumbs for binding, added some Worcestershire sauce too) and refrigerated in a sealed bowl overnight, making the patties just before I grilled them.  Delicious!  I served them on soft buns with Yia Yia's Tzatziki Sauce from this site, tomatoes, and chopped sweet onion.

These are fantastic. I use fresh spinach chopped in the blender. Only addition after the first time was salt. They were really bland without it. I have made these several times, I don't own a grill and usually cook them in a sauté skillet. It also helps to mash them down as they shrink quite a bit if left to cook alone. These are great with pita breads and tzatziki sauce.

We did like it for a change with the tzatziki sauce but they were pretty bland on their own.  I made with fresh spinach.

We made them exactly as written and they were delicious!  My husband raved about them, said they were his favorite meal during our staycation week, and we had gone out to dinner five or six times that week.  Our kids are grown and gone so we had leftovers that we froze, and they freeze very well too!  Thanks for the terrific recipe!

Wow!  These live up to the reviews!!  So simple ingredients and the taste is fabulous!  Only change 
I made is that I sprinkled some garlic powder to the mix and instead of grilling I fried them in just a tad of butter!  Most definitely a keeper!!

Loved this recipe have made it twice this week. I used chopped fresh spinach and added a tbs of cumin.
 I would chill in the freezer for 1/ hour, they are quite soft.

These burgers were moist and delicious when I made the recipe as directed (I did add some Worchestershire sauce as some recommended).  Even my beef and potatoes brother-in-law raved about them!  They will be a regular in our house for sure!

I followed the recipe closely, but used fresh chopped spinach and herbs.  Very moist.  The burgers are very soft and will stick to the grill, so be sure to oil the grill grates prior to cooking.  Loved the flavor and would definitely make again.

You should definitely make turkey burgers with spinach and feta. This recipe is missing your personality tho. I used fresh baby spinach and added cilantro, sriacha and salt. Dip your hands in water to make patties because the mixture is sticky!  Freezing for an hour helps handling. I needed 4 minutes per side at med high. Oil the grill first. I also sautéed some onion in evoo and butter as a topper.  And made tzaziki. Deeeeelish.

Lots of flavor!  I used pita bread and that was a little to "bready" for a bun.  In the future, is probably serve them with spinach, tomato, red onion and tetzekki sauce and no bun.  They were really good!

So happened I had chopped chicken. Worked fine.  I had fresh spinach so I sautéed it first with garlic.  Added salt and pepper.   Just used mayo and lettuce on homemade all wheat bread .  They were delicious.  I bet a yogurt w dill and cucumbers would also be good.

This was really good and fairly easy to make! I did add some panko breadcrumbs and some other spices to perk it up. I think next time, instead of Tzatziki, I'll use an olive relish to really punch up the flavor, but overall this was a really great recipe!

Flavorwise, these were very good!  My problem was, even though I greased the grill, the burgers stuck to it and made a big mess.   I was able to salvage enough to make four delicious gyros!  
Next time, I'll fry them in my cast iron frying pan.

These are the best burgers!!  I recommend changing the boxed spinach to fresh spinach and just wilt it and chop it up before adding it to the turkey mixture.  It really adds a fresh great flavor.  I served mine on a pita with tzatziki sauce, thinly sliced sweet onion and tomato and it was a big hit!!  This recipe is fantastic thanks for sharing!

My family and I really enjoyed these, though we had a bit of trouble with them. The lack of a binder besides eggs caused the burgers to fall apart and slip through the grates on our outdoor grill, resulting in us having to pan fry them instead. Would recommend adding at least 1/4 cup of flour to the turkey mixture along with some salt and pepper, as they lacked some seasoning when they were done. Still turned out very good and we will make them again with some adjustments.

We opt for rough-chopped fresh spinach. Served with tzatziki on wheat buns and honey roasted carrots on the side! Yum!

Good. Not great. I'd make again but the feta would go on after. Grills away and adds nothing it seems to the flavor when mixed.  Adding alfapha sprouts as a topping boosted flavor.

SO good! But I added worcestershire sauce, bread crumbs and some spices. But they were so moist and so tasty. For me, because I made them a little on the small side, there were about ten burgers. Food for the week!

This solved my two biggest problems with turkey burgers; they're usually too dry and they have no flavor. These turkey burgers were de-freaking-licious. Super moist, tons of flavor, the only thing I would change is to add some s&p. Served mine with tzatziki, lettuce, tomatoes, and red onion, on warm whole wheat pitas. Yum!!

You can substitute frozen spinach for fresh, steamed spinach. The recipe can be halved, too.

Used slightly less turkey as I got 1.30lbs at the Farmer's Market...Made 4 large burgers instead of 8.  We each ate one for dinner and other 2 we reheated at the office for lunch!  AMAZING!

These were really good. I did use fresh spinach that I had on hand. Sautéed it with onion and garlic. I didn't have the right amt of feta left but was still good. I'd probably even amp up the feta next time. With 2 lbs turkey I easily made 10 burgers. My patties were really mushy dispite keeping as much moisture out as I could. But once cooked they held together very well. The hubby liked them and he is NOT a fan of turkey.

I really liked this recipe.  I added Worcestershire sauce and a little liquid smoke as I cooked them indoors on my stove in my iron skillet.  I cut them in half and ate them in a corn tortilla that I had cooked in a tiny bit of coconut oil...with pickles and cheese and mayo.  I will also try eating a half one like a taco in a leaf of lettuce.

These were very tasty with or without a bun.   When I was forming the turkey mixture, it seemed very wet and I wondered if they were ruined with too much egg.  I very carefully placed the chilled patties on a hot grill and they firmed up nicely.   I think next time I will add extra feta.

I love Greek food so I was excited to make these. I substituted beef for turkey but was very disappointed with the resulting flavor. It ended up tasting like a Hamburger Helper without the noodles. If I tried this again, I'd probably not mix the feta and spinach into the ground meat and instead just top the patty with them.

I've been making a version of this for several years and just had them this past week and we were reminded of how good they are.  The recipe I have used (given to me by a good friend) includes adding minced mushrooms - preferably shitaki - and onions that you saute before adding into the burger mix.  This keeps them moist and yummy.

Easy to make, but the flavor wasn't great. I believe the recipe called for a bit too much spinach. The meat could have also used some seasoning and extra feta.

Have been making these burgers for quite some time now. Absolutely love them!! I use frozen bagged  spinach and defrost slightly from that state before mixing with ingredients then chill  30-60 minutes.  Easy to form &  find the outcome to be nothing but moist. Excellent!

I followed the recipe exactly except also added salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder. I served it on a potato hamburger bun with thinly sliced cucumber, pepperoncini peppers, sliced onion and cilantro with a dollop of tzatziki. Was absolutely amazing!! Better then a beef burger!

First, I'm a beef guy. This turned out awesome. I cut the recipe in half due to serving size. Loved how the exposed spinach became crispy. BTW I cook the burgers on the stove. All time new favorite (so far)

I used fresh spinach, a little extra minced garlic, sautéed onions and mushrooms and Worcestershire sauce based on previous reviews. My husband liked these and had seconds, but it was a little bland for me, better supplemented with hot sauce. I will make again, but with more spice.

These are quite good for the very few ingredients in the mix.   I was suspect that they would be bland, but I think the feta fills in where I would normally salt or season with something else.   I also added a little more garlic because that's never a mistake for me!    My only tip would be to not make these too pudgy.   It was hard to get the center of my burger cooked through without overcooking the outside edges, so flatten them down.   It's not like beef  where you might welcome a nice pink center!

I made this tonight for dinner. Used the George Foreman grill because we were having issues with outside grill. Only thing I did different was add some red onion and chopped mushrooms. I put them on pita flatbreads and it was absolutely delicious. The burgers were moist even though I used 93% turkey. My boys even liked it. Nice alternative to chicken. For those doing WW, it's a lot for a low amount of points.

My husband absolutely loved these.  I'm not a huge fan of cooked spinach, but they were pretty good despite.  I made a few alterations; reduced the amount of spinach and replaced it with diced red pepper.  I added a bit of oregano and because I was worried about how they'd stay together, I threw in about a tbsp. of bread crumbs.  I'd definitely make this recipe again, but think I'd sub the spinach for a vegetable that I have a preference for.

I had to add to the long list of accolades for this recipe because we all enjoyed these burgers so much! My only deviations were egg whites instead of whole eggs, garlic powder instead of minced garlic, and using indoor grill. My 14YO who hates eating anything green didn't mind the chopped spinach in the burger!

I'm indifferent about it. It was certainly worth trying. My take on this is - if you're looking to add something to your idea list of "what else can I do with ground beef", then this is good. I'm adding this to my ground beef catalog and will happily throw it in every here and there to mix things up. Was anyone crazy about it? No. Was it an easy weeknight meal that was healthy and tasty? Yes ... and that's the winner statement for me.

I served these bad boys up "Gyros style" on some flat bread with a dallop of tzatziki sauce and some chopped red onion, tomato and cucumber.   I added 1/4 tsp. fenugreek, 1/4 tsp. cumin, sea salt , fresh ground pepper and substituted fresh, organic spinach to the meat mixture.  My husband loved it! I will be making this again as a healthy alternative to traditional Greek Gyros. Thank you!

On frequent rotation! I bake mini meatloaves in muffin pans; 375' for about 20 min.
1 lb Turkey + 1 lb Venison Sausage = Amazing!  Ups the fat little bit but still very healthy. Used lots fresh spinach chopped, added Montreal Seasoning, and even pieces of mozzarella cheese too. Yum. No Tzatziki sauce or bun needed with the sausage making it so flavorful.
 Forms about 11-12 patties. 
1 patty = 158 calories, 6.5g fat, 23g protein.

The flavors were good, but the burgers were pretty dry.  We paired it with tzatziki so  it worked out.  Nice healthy option for ground turkey!

I added just a little garlic and a little mozzarella blend white cheese and used blue cheese crumbles instead of feta, I was out of feta.  The best thing I did was combined all the ingredients and  scrambled it and cooked it on the stove top.  It turned out delicious and took less time to cook.  I stuffed the pita with the scramble and topped it with light ranch dressing, and a little more shredded white cheese  You can add tomato or any other toppings you like.

Very good taste.  I cooked the burgers on a cast iron grill heated on an induction counter top unit.  Grill marks were made on the burgers during cooking.  One variation is to add fresh dill to the mix.  Handling the uncooked burger mix takes some getting used to and is messy.  The turkey burgers did not shrink at all and there was very little grease produced during cooking.

Very delicious, especially the sauce. No salt is needed in the patties. However, I might like more feta in burger and in the sauce. When I ran out of spinach, I used chopped (and cooked) kale from my garden. It's same deliciousness.

Made exactly according to recipe and it was absolutely delicious! I'm going to make lots to just have in the freezer as a go-to meal. We had with Cobb's breads gourmet hamburger buns, tsatziki, red onion, tomato and lettuce.

Overall the ease of preparation and the texture of the cooked paddy made this an enjoyable and easy to cook recipe. But for us the spinach overpower the other flavors. 
If you Popeye, it is a 5!!!

Halfed the recipe,  used fresh spinach and cooked in a skillet.  Husband took one bite and said it had good flavor. Daughter ate the whole burger. Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe using the changes indicated in the Allrecipes magazine.  They turned out really well, but next time, at hubby's request, I'm going to try it with beef and a milder cheese.  The Feta seemed to really overpower the taste using 2 tablespoons inside each patty.  Loved it with the cucumbers, onions and mayo, though.  A definite try again.

Made this yesterday, with the following small additions. we added 6 oz. (instead of 4) pre-seasoned Mediterranean feta to the pattie mixture, added some Greek Seasoning mix to the burgers, and made a traditional  tzatziki with the addition of fresh chopped dill. These were some of the best burgers we've ever made. Watch the temps on the parties as they cook, AND DON'T FUSS WITH THEM - one flip, and no poking. lol. The cook times were a little less than mentioned in the recipie. Take them off the grill when they hit 175°, and let them sit for a couple minutes to finish cooking. Perfectly juicy!

As written, not much flavor. I fried up mini tasting patties as I went along. I made the recipe as is and once I cooked a mini party, no taste and dry. So I added 1/4 cup olive oil, more garlic fresh and powdered, 1.5 teas dried oregano. Again flavor needed a punch so I added 2 chopped shallots and salt and pepper. I left in fridge for an hour then formed into thin flat long patties and fried in a bit of olive oil. Very good after all the changes.

Great recipe just need to try options that keep the burgers together better.  Couple fell apart but I rate it a solid 4 stars.

Gret recipe as is.... It was delicious AND easy...just as described. I can see where it would also be fun to add different ingredients depending on the mood of the day! ( i.e.  Lemon juice or Worcestershire sauce)...But it truly is yummy just as is too.

Started a diet recently and decided to try this recipe.  Hubby would normally look at a recipe like this and say "bleh" but he really liked it!  Made the following additions: 1) more garlic and a bit more feta  2) splash of worcestershire  3) salt and pepper 4) basil (I didn't have fresh so used dry).  Served it with Greek tzatziki which was a fantastic addition!

Baked it in aluminum foil in the oven for 30 min. at 350.  Moist and delicious!  Will definitely make again.  Topped it with honey mustard yogurt salad dressing from Wegman's.  Very tasty!

These are fast and need no additional seasoning. Delicious! My son's favorite. I use fresh spinach cut up instead of frozen.

These were so good! The only changes I made:  used fresh spinach and added onion. I cooked the spinach, onion and garlic in a little olive oil before adding to the mix. Cooked my burgers for 4 min on my George Foreman. Thanks for a great recipe! Great without a bun....

I would definitely make these burgers again, because they are soooo easy and delicious!  The feta I used had small pieces of cranberry.  Also, I added a bit of panko bread crumbs, since they are pretty wet.  I lightly fried them in coconut oil.  Added a side of asparagus and a chop salad.  Ate with a little tziziki sauce, but you can use just about anything you like.

Great recipe with excellent flavor.  I used fresh spinach and cooked the burgers on the George Forman.  Made the Tzatziki Sauce as recommended (but added finely chopped cucumbers).  Will definitely make this recipe again and again.

Absolutely delicious! I halved the recipe as I just had 1lb turkey but did not make any other changes. My husband loved it and told me to make sure I kept the recipe. Will definitely be making these again.

I have to say, this is the best turkey burger I have tasted to date??! Super simple ingredients, all I added was a little more crushed garlic than recipe asked for, and a few dashes of garlic salt! The family ate it all up! Even shared recipe with friends! Kids are easily and happily pleased!

This is a very easy and healthy recipe. It was very flavorful for it being a turkey burger. I did a trial run with one patty on an outdoor grill and did have issues with the patties being too wet for the grill. So I opted to fry it in a pan until the sides were golden brown, and put it on a pan and put it back on the grill to smoke and cook completely. I like the smokey flavor, but it's not necessary to cook on an outdoor grill. Pan frying the patties did the job just as well. I did make a garlic aoili sauce to go with it. My family loved it!

I made this last night on the grill.  It wasn't a bad burger but didn't have any pizzazz.  No real strong flavor to it.  I recommend seasoning the meat prior to grilling.  I will say I used fresh spinach instead of frozen but that could only make it better in my opinion.

Really impressed with this recipe. I did add roasted red pepper to the patty mix. I also used seasoning salt on both sides. Pre-making the patties and putting them in fridge didn't really firm them up. But I planned to cooked them under the broiler anyway 16 min (turned half way). They may had fallen apart on the grill. Finally, I put them in a pita pocket with light mayo, spinach, and tomato. Great variation from the mundane turkey burger.

I loved this recipe. If you like things on the hotter side, I would suggest adding hot sauce in the patties. Gives it a little kick that compliments the spinach well.

I add sautéed garlic & onions in them and I've never added eggs. I decided to try this and add eggs....yuck! It made them soooo wet and almost gummy. The meat was oozing through the grill slats. I actually had more than 2 pounds of turkey that I used and I used one egg and one egg white. I'll make this again, but I'll never add the egg again

I tweaked this recipe with a little fresh chopped mint, grilled for total of 15 minutes and served with a simple green salad (lemon and Olive oil) - the perfect alternative to a beefburger for an A+ blood type diet! I will definitely make again

Made these for our Memorial Day cookout as per recipe instructions, but sautéed minced onion with the garlic and then added the spinach to incorporate, along with salt, pepper, lemon juice, and worcestershire as other reviewers have suggested. Made 8 burgers out of the 2# of ground turkey and was perfect size, served with tzatziki on brioche buns. Everyone including myself ate two of them and we are not seconds kind of people - they are just THAT good!! This is a company wow keeper recipe - we will be making these all summer!

I have already rated this recipe 5 stars but after reading some of the poor reviews, I felt compelled to add some suggestions. 1. Do not use the extra lean turkey. The small amount of fat helps to distribute the flavor. 2. Use the frozen spinach and squeeze the excess water out. It does not have to be totally dry. 3. Use bread soaked in milk instead of eggs. 4. Add the zest of a small lemon. It brightens up the flavors. 5. If you want to add a little salt add it after cooking because the feta is salty on its own.

One of my most successful recipes EVER!  Don't think of them as hamburgers, or as a lame imitation hamburger.  These have a voice of their own and it speaks DELICIOUS!  Both teens gave two thumbs up.  PS, I fried them in a pan.  I made 3 burgers and made the rest into meatballs for lunches.

I just made these for dinner. The kids had sandwiches, hubby and I just ate them on a plate with tzatziki and chopped tomatoes. The only thing I added was a pinch of salt and lemon pepper, Oh and I cooked a 9 oz bag of fresh spinach and chopped it (instead of using frozen). They're SO GOOD.  My son printed it out and added it to my "Good Recipes" book immediately! (That's an honor around here.)

Delicious way to add a little extra to your turkey burgers!  The only change that I made was to cook them on my Foreman grill instead of a regular grill, because I've found that turkey burgers don't hold together quite as well, and I was worried about them falling through the grates on my grill.  Definitely will add to the recipe box!

I made as the recipe states, but added some Greek seasoning, and pepper.  So good, unfortunately the fussy 11 year old couldn't get past the fact there was spinach in them so he passed.  But hubby and 15 year old daughter loved them.

Made it for my girlfriend and her roommate they loved it, added little extra garlic, and 2 oz extra feta cheese, and fresh spinach, let sit in fridge for 20 mins before cooking on George Forman grill (winter in Michigan) used tzatziki II sauce on top with fresh parsley instead of mint amazing! Went well with petite sirah wine for the girls and a bock beer for me.

I couldn't make the burgers because the mix was way too soggy so I put it in a meat loaf dish. Does't taste turkey, doesn't taste spinach doest taste feta cheese. All you can taste is SALT!! SOOOOO SALTY!!!
And I follow the recipe step by step and, of course, I did NO use salt. 
Will never so it again.

The keys to this recipe are using a good feta cheese and making sure your spinach is as dry as possible (just like when making spinach dip).  We used a garlic and herb feta and did not put any minced garlic into the meat mixture. I also used egg beaters instead of eggs and let the patties firm up in the refrigerator for a couple of hours before cooking.  We will definitely have again and change the flavors of the feta cheese as mood strikes.  Would also make a great meatball for in a spicy tomato sauce.

Just made this for dinner tonight. It was really good but I think I will add Worcestershire and extra garlic, as suggested in one of the other reviews. Overall a great recipe!

absolutely amazing! turkey can be quite dry but i didnt find it dry at all, it was very juicy and delicious.  i like to put them in the freezer overnight then cook them the next day, helps keep their form better, they also taste better the day after in my opinion.  thanks for posting such a great recipe!

They were delicious!  I made sliders, which made a lot so I froze the rest of the patties.  I cooked them on my kitchen grill and served on hawaiian rolls with cucumber sauce.  No need for other condiments. My husband is trying to cut back on bread so he ate the patties with just the cucumber sauce and said they were delicious.

I followed the recipe...and gross. My husband and I choked them down. I think it's because we used extra lean turkey maybe? I bet they are awesome with beef but not sure I'd get my husband to try them again ;)

We loved these!  I did make a few changes because my children won't eat feta cheese.  I used shredded montery jack & cheddar cheese and fresh spinich.  I put the spinich and the eggs in the food processor and added them to the ground turkey.  VERY VERY yummy!!!!!!!

These were fantastic!  I used fresh spinach and a little more Feta than the recipe called for. Because of dietary restrictions I cannot have beef right now and have been craving a good burger, and that is what I had with this.
When I reviewed this, I should have added that I refrigerate the mixture for probably 1/2 hour to 45 minutes. The mixture holds together better.

This recipe is a a favorite in our home! Very healthy and very satisfying! There pair nicely with the Arnold Sandwich Thins, whole grain. They seem to grill better if you freeze them for a couple hours first.

Made them as sliders. I wanted to grill them but ended up baking them in the oven on my cast iron grill pan so I could still have the grill lines and any liquids would  drain  properly.  They were great with tzatziki sauce from Costco.

Easy and delicious!  Since it's cooler weather now I cooked them inside in a skillet and they turned out great.  My husband who was skeptical when he heard what they were ended up loving them!  I will definitely be making these again and again.

We loved it perfect summer dish.  Hubby became allergic to beef so this dressed up turkey burger is fantastic.  We made in bulk and froze them so they were ready for weeknight feasts. Wrapped them in wax paper and freezer zip lock bag.

Didn't add spinach, but added gr.onions. Totally wet and wouldn't stay together. Added bread crumbs, used all that I had, so used parmesan cheese. Couldn't flip over on the grill, they burned and fell apart. Finished cooking in oven. Didn't look great, but tasted great broken up and served on Ritz crackers. Sean didn't use a bun, just ate them on crackers.

This burger is a regular in this house, I make it 2-3 times a month on our indoor grill. It is so delicious! The only thing we add is a dash or two of seasoning salt and it really gives it a great flavor!

Made these for 2 picky eaters this 4th of July and got rave reviews. Picky eater #1 liked them because they weren't dry, and  picky eater #2 ate 2. Both said they'd like to have them again.  Consistency is a bit liquidy, so be prepared.  I used fresh instead of frozen spinach, and felt that 9 oz of fresh spinach was too much, will probably put in less fresh spinach next time.

Really easy and very good. I formed them and then left them in the fridge for a few hours and had no problems with them being loose or falling apart. I also did half of the burgers with fresh mozzarella and that worked really well too!

Delicious freshly made and cooked; as a leftover, not so much. In my version, I used a 1.25 pound of turkey, so used only one egg, and a little less garlic. Added a couple TBs breadcrumbs, milk, EVOO and a pinch of oregano, s/p. Drizzled a little more EVOO before baking at 400 for 20-25 minutes. Served in pita pockets with chopped tomato, lettuce, and onion and tzatziki sauce (The popular recipe here is OK but not great).

Loved these, made them exactly as written but halved the recipe.  I didn't have any problems at all with them falling apart.  I did mix the burgers up an hour or so in advance, formed them into patties and let them sit in the fridge until we were ready to cook; they were wet, but I put them on the grill v-e-r-y c-a-r-e-f-u-l-l-y and let them cook undisturbed for 10 minutes.  They flipped easily and after another 10 minutes they were done, moist and with beautiful perfect grill marks.  Wish I'd remembered the tzatziki, that would have been fabulous, but they were great with the usual burger fixings.

This was one of the first reciepts I tried and did a fantastic job following these directions.  Im happy that it had the conversion chart cuz I was only making 4 burgers & it tweaked it to the right amount of ingrediants for me instead of me guessing!  They were a hit!

These were good, but nothing spectacular.  But my family has never been big on ground turkey, though.  Might try again with ground beef.

These were Delicious. I made these last night for my family and my Husband said these were the best he had ever had. I made mine with beef hamburger since my Husband prefers it.  We Love Feta and used a Tomato and Basil feta in them. This will definitely stay in our recipe file  Thank You

Great burger, added a bit more feta.  Refrigerate patties for a couple of hours before grilling to help them hold together.

Wow, I wasn't expecting these to be as good as they were!!! But these were amazing! Simple, healthy, tasty! All perfect requirements!  I did take some of the suggestions and froze them for a few hours before putting them on the barbeque.

These burgers were excellent, although I think I used a little too much garlic.   I used one egg and a little Italian flavored bread crumbs for one package of ground turkey and put them on the George Forman grill.  Served them with grilled rolls and lettuce and tomato with a smear of mayo and they were great.  Very light but at the same time extremely satisfying.  Will be making these again and again.

My family ate these burgers up!  They were great tasting and nutritious to boot.  Fried up in frying pan since it is not grilling season. Served like hamburgers on bun with lettuce and tomato.

Delicious! The burgers were so moist and juicy, I added a little yellow peppers and onions to the mixture because I had it in the fridge. I also added a few bread crumbs for better binding purposes. Great stuff, I will make this one again. Thank you for sharing!

Love these burgers! I try to stay in the food pyramid so I made patties at 4oz raw (12 servings.) I grilled them on my foreman griller and garnished with picante sauce. I had a large salad and grapes for dessert. Fabulous recipe. Easy and tasty!

MMMM! when i first saw this recipe i just knew I had to try it! we had all the ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly, except i wish i had salt, peppered, and garlic powdered the meat, cheese, and spinach mixture before forming them into patties. I'm definitely a spice girl and I heavily spiced the outside of the burgers continually while cooking. I did refrigerate the patties for about an hour before putting them on the grill. when on the grill i cooked them on a low heat setting to avoid them turning black like a lot of the pictures and only flipped them once to create some yummy looking grill lines. I used whole wheat buns which i buttered and placed directly on the grill to toast. I didn't have a problem with them being dry at ALL, in fact mine were practically dripping with juices! So delicious even my picky 3 year old niece ate an entire half of one. (we told her they were krabby patties) so all in all- smelled good, tasted great, looked even better, just salt and pepper and garlic powder the meat before forming into patties otherwise they will be rather bland.  EDIT- also use fresh spinach just chop it up and put however much you want in!

EDIT: I just made these on the stove with a skillet with just a tad bit of butter in the pan. It was DELICIOUS and cooked up really fast. I think this recipe is going to become a constant last minute meal. it's so easy!

Made these but did half the recipe. They were really great. We ate them hot off the grill with tomato slices on the new sandwich thin buns, my boyfriend went crazy. He is not even that big of a fan of feta. I made no changes and it was wonderful!

These were eaten so fast that I didn't have time to get a picture! I call that a hit! Don't think I'll ever go back to plain old beef burgers! (I did add lemon juice and paprika as someone suggested and I let the patties chill for a bit in the frig before putting them on the BBQ, helps them stay together better. Next time I'm going to add diced onion too.) Thank you VbCook!

Love, love, love! I used fresh spinach and added diced Kalamata Olives and a bit of the olive juice. Live in a high-rise, so I chose to broil...flipping once. Used pita bread with sliced tomato, finished with a dallop of Tzadziki. Will make again and again!

I loved, loved these burgers. Next time though I would use some more condiments and veggies to top with. A few of my friends had this with brown mustard but I am not a fan so I had mine with a little mayo and it was still GREAT!!!!

Like the idea of the spinach and feta in the burger but it lacked flavor and thats after i seasoned with garlic salt. I used 98% fat free extra lean turkey so they were a bit on the dry side. I think adding minced onion and celery would have helped with that. It was pretty good being that it was a healthy burger.

I am not a big turkey meat cook, but I did not care for this! I was so disappointed. I hope to find another recipe for turkey burgers that are edible soon!

YUM!  These burgers are so good and don't do that lead-belly thing that most Turkey Burgers give you.  I added more garlic and the second time I made it, I added chopped black olive.  YUM!!!!

This recipe is awesome!  I used fresh spinach lightly sauteed.  We have tried with and without a hamburger bun and find it's much tastier without bread.

This recipe is delicious!! The only changes I made were to add salt, pepper & oregano. I served them on a bun with tzatziki sauce. Awesome! Even the male meat-eaters in my family loved it. This is definitely going to be a regular at our house. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This burger came out wonderful. The only thing I added was a handful of breadcrumbs to help it come together. Served them up on Pita bread with Tzatziki Sauce and arugula and felt like a gourmet chef. Family loved it with roasted vegigie pasta salad. I am making again tonight!

These were good, and I would make them again with some changes.  They needed something else... mostly salt and pepper, the idea about the worchestire sauce sounds good.  They were edible with lots of ketchup.

Wow--just made these and they were really great. Make sure you get as much moisture out of the spinach, or the burgers tend to fall apart.  Or, use fresh spinach.

Delicious! I used fresh spinach, added some chopped onion and greek seasoning and pepper. Also works well to make ahead and freeze. Probably easier to grill from frozen. Served on a bun with tzatziki sauce. A great alternative to regular beef burgers.

I give the recipe as is a 4 but with modifications, a 5! To have enough meat to make this recipe and the Tex-Mex burgers on this site, I quartered this recipe. 8 oz non-frozen ground turkey, used no eggs, some extra feta, added extra garlic, a few dashes of cayenne, about 1 tsp each of pepper and Kosher salt (or 1/2 tsp regular salt), and some healthy dashes of paprika. I eyeballed the spinach. I wilted down 1/3 of a regular size bag and finely chopped it. Also, I added 1/2 cup diced onion and 2.5 large mushrooms, finely diced and let the whole mix set for 1 hour in the fridge. Diced onions and mushrooms in turkey burgers make them so juicy! This is an instant regular in our house. I will definitely be making it again. We served these with mayo, lettuce and tomato on wheat hamburger buns. These seasonings can easily be adjusted to use with 1 or 2 lbs of meat. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I wasn't too thrilled with this recipe. I thought it would have tasted a little better. It was very difficult to shape the burger, a very messy chore!I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and garlic powder instead bc i ran out of garlic.

My husband loved this.  I prefer a little more spice, but the recipe is good just the way it is too.

ETA: I added some adobo,  badia's all seasoning & 1/4 cup of bread crumbs to hold it together and WOW.  These are SO good.  Also, ised fat free feta and didn't miss the at at all!!

My wife and I both enjoyed these quite a bit.  As an avid carnivore, I was impressed with the consistency and flavor.  Don't be put off by the spinach, it all blends together nicely to make an excellent burger.

Excellent and easy!
Since I'm only cooking for two, we froze the leftovers which came in handy for a quick lunch.

Since I've made this several times now (boyfriend really likes 'em), I wanted to mix it up a bit and try something a bit different.  For one batch I added caramelized onions, chopped, peeled apples and feta (no spinach). They didn't stick together quite as well, but were just as tasty as the original!

Was definitely the most moist turkey burger I've ever made-- I was scared when it involved spinach- but they were good- definitely needs a condiment- but great even without a bun.

We loved these!!  I did add a tad more spinach and feta along with a splash of lemon juice and red pepper since we like things a little spicy.  My turkey meat was a little icy so I didn't have a problem with it being jiggly.  Great recipe!!

They are a little jiggly as pointed out. I started them on a piece of tinfoil to get them going then slid them off onto the grill when they started to firm up.

I liked these and thought the recipe was inventive yet simple and easy. I didn't have any problems with the patties not sticking like some people, but I'd thoughted out my meat and it was still a little icy (maybe helped). This was the first time I ever had ground turkey, towards the end I was wanting more of it but in the beginning it was bland. I do think tzatziki would have helped it, and I think it might be nice to put some sort of sauce (soy, or something slightly sweet?) in with the meat to flavor the whole thing.
But I liked it :) Thanks.

We loved these.  The flavor was so good and not garlicky at all. I didn't change a thing and served it on whole wheat buns with tomato and tzatziki sauce.  It was delicious.

DH was sweet enough to make this while I was on my way home from work, and I was pleasantly surprised with the results when I arrived home!  He made 2 small changes: egg beaters replaced the egg, and he accidentally put in 2x as much spinach as the recipe called for.  Even with the extra spinach, the burgers tasted really great!  I'm thinking about turning the leftover meat mixture into meatballs for tomorrow night - yum :)

Yummy!  I am not one to eat cooked greens, but these are very good.  I love how simple the ingredients are and that I can mix up a batch and freeze.  I have made these twice already!

Super Yummy!  They're garlicky and cheesey and really good as leftovers!  Thanks for a great recipe.  My kids liked them without the spinach but I liked them with.

This was a hit with the whole family! The flavors were great, and the burgers were kept nice and moist from the spinach- a nice change from how turkey sometimes turns out.

Delicious, delicious, delicious!  Especially with spinach fresh from the garden.  Used a feta blend cheese. They do take a little bit of delicate handling on the grill, but so good and so worth it.  (psst-use the tzatziki sauce, it rocks!!)

These are really good. Topped with Tzatziki sauce on whole wheat buns, they are delicious. Serve with a nice Greek salad and you have a tasty, healthy meal.

These are good.  Got the approval from the bf, so they get 5 stars (he's not a huge fan of turkey burgers).  I planned on chilling them but was too hungry, so I added bread crumbs to help it along.  Very good, thanks.  Take direction from the recipe and oil your grate.  I forgot and oh, did they stick!  Since thats my fault, I'm not dinging the recipe itself.  thanks for sharing!

UPDATE: Made again with real eggs and they were still yummy. 5/9/2008 I made these for my boyfriend last night, they were AWESOME. Used eggbeaters instead of eggs, YUM!

This is really great, I added ground caraway seeds and it added wonderful flavor.  I didn't grill it--still a bit early for me, but it came out kind of dry.  Do you think I should have not cooked it in the pan for as long (15 minutes)?

These were great.  It's a nice change from regular hamburgers, and a lot more healthy.
