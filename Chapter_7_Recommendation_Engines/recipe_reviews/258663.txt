Baked 350 for 25 min since it is 0 degrees outside! Looked great and baked well but not a new favorite. Too "wet" for us and combining garlic and Bleu cheese was a very strong flavor. Tweaking ingredients or grilling may provide better results. Worth trying to see if others in the group enjoy.

It was a bit "watery" and the 2nd time I made it I reduced the butter. Also made it with crumbled feta giving  it milder flavor and more acceptable to some palates

Made for friends that aren’t big mushroom fans, but they ate them all.
It’s an easy recipe to make

I don't eat blue cheese but made these for my husband. He gave them a thumbs up and 5 stars.
