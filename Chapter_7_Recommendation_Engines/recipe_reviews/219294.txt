This is great and hearty. Instead of putting the ready made dough in muffin tins. I stretched each by hand making a circle, spooned a little of the meat mixture and then folded the dough over making it a little hot pocket. (Don't forget to cut slits for venting.) It was even good the next day.

The meat mixture is a good served over pasta or rice too. Really easy and fast!

This was a cute idea for Halloween. I used homemade biscuits and put them in ramekins because it was a better size for us. I altered the filling to accommodate what I had on hand and left the whole thing in the ramekin to serve rather than removing the biscuit cups.

My picky teenager goggled these up.  I used cheddar cheese instead of American and I didn't have canned biscuit dough so I made them from scratch.  It was hard to see the pumpkin face, because the cheese melted so much.  Next time I'll just pop them in the oven for a minute.  We'll be making these all year long.  Will try other cheeses for variety.

We really enjoyed making this recipe!  So much easier and cleaner than carving pumpkins.  Only, I used 1 pound of ground beef instead of 1.5 and it was still too much meat for the biscuit "cups."  I kinda piled it on top. It sounds like the ramekin idea might be best.  The cups were very hearty!  I was surprised at how full I was.

This was easy and fun! I made changes to my taste and I took another reviewers advice and made a hot pocket type of pie.

These were easy to make. The kids liked them because they look cool. Not as much meat fit in each one as I would have liked.

These are so yummy and easy to make! But they're a bit tedious and make quite a lot of mixture. I had at least 2 cups left over. Maybe use it for spaghetti another day, or the next time I make this, I'll use some sort of beans to weigh down the biscuit dough while they're baking/puffing up.

This was a fun way to make a dinner even a picky child will want to eat!  I followed it exactly as written with the exception of leaving out the olives (personal taste).  The filling was very tasty and would be easy to experiment with to fine-tune everything to your taste.  The biscuit dough has a few issues: if you roll it thinly, it fits nicely in the cup and allows more filling, plus a shorter crust prep time, but the filling will leak through the bottom after a few minutes, destroying it.  If you make it with the thicker biscuit dough, you get an attractive cup that might hold less filling but is pretty indestructible.  You will want to watch because your edges might start to burn before the center of the biscuit cooks through, so drop the temp or make a cover with some foil if this happens.  The cheese also has a tendency to burn at the oven temp given.  Since the filling and crusts are already done and hot, I'm not sure if using a lower temp for an extra minute would be better than the high one for less time.  These are all little things, but this is overall a good recipe!

It was tasty - even the grandparents enjoyed them Halloween night.  But I only used 1 lb beef (and swapped out the carrots and olives for butternut squash & zucchini) and I still had enough of the meat mix to make up another batch of pies. Would make again but the recipe needs some changes to come together properly.

I don't think that I rolled out the dough thin enough. I had to squash down the cups to get any filling in them. Very tasty though.
