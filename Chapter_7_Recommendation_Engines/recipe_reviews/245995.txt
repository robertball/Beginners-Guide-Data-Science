I made this to serve with corned beef on St. Patrick's Day.  The flavor was very good.  Next time I think I would cut the cabbage smaller so that it cooks faster.

Definitely would make again! I don't like cooked cabbage. The smell of boiled cabbage makes me cringe. None of that here. Delicious, not as 'soggy' as boiled. Very tasty. Made with stone ground mustard because that's all I could find. Could pump up the spices even more if you'd like. Not too overwhelming. Used fresh thyme too.

This turned out good but needed a little more mustard in my opinion. This would be great with corned beef as well as pork!
