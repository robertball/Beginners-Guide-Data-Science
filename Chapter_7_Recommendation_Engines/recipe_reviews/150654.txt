the ingredients are great and acurate but as a lebanese i would suggest blending the garlic with the salt first and then slowly adding the oil and the lemon in alternation as you blend. go slow and even though it's a little more complicated, if you do it right you'll end up with a really thick mixture almost like a sour cream dip! the process is a little tricky so even if it doesn't work the first time try again and make sure to keep an eye on the mixture as you blend so it wont fall appart. oh, and you might not need to use all of the oil and lemon, as soon as the mixture turns into a fluffy white substance and you think you have enought, taste it and if satisfied with the balance of flavors, you're done!  :D

I have been making Lebanese Garlic Sauce for a few years, and this is the best recipe I have found.  It tastes just like the sauce at our favorite Middle Eastern restaurant.  I did make a few changes.  Here is the recipe with my alterations:

    * 1 head garlic
    * 1/2 tablespoon sea salt (make sure it is course-ground or this will still be too much salt)
    * 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
    * 1/2 cup vegetable oil
    * 3/4 cup olive oil (not extra virgin - mild-tasting, preferably cold-pressed)

So, less salt and less oil.  Also, I believe the immersion blender is key here to emulsify the oil to the proper consistency.  Loved it! Thank you for the recipe!

Awesome recipe don't change a thing. You MUST use an immersion blender otherwise it will separate. Food processors and blenders don't work.  I purchased a bamix just for this recipe.   Thank you!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!  The immersion blending and the egg white are truly the key.  If you're used to a thick style sauce like they serve in the Detroit area then throw in the egg white.  I followed the recipe as written at first and it was very thin, so I added the egg white as suggested in other reviews and it thickened to a mayo consistency.

This was excellent!  I did make a few minor changes based on some previous reviews - I only used about half the olive oil, and I doubled the garlic as we were looking for something really high-powered!  Thank you to the reviewer who suggested the addition of an egg white to thicken it if you're looking for something similar to what you find in the Detroit area.  I'm a Detroit-area native living out of state, and my husband and I have been trying to duplicate LaShish's garlic sauce for years!  This comes very close.

It also goes VERY WELL with Shish Tawook!

MMmm!! I love this stuff. I usually add a tablespoon of Mayonnaise that's the way I learned. For the reviewer that complained, -make sure your olive oil is a good quality, more $$ - and not stale- or else the taste will not be pleasant. Keep your oil in the coolest place, not a warm one. 
This is really yummy with roasted chicken- dip the pieces in and enjoy. Be careful or you will over-eat!  Oh, and make sure the person who will be enjoying your close company later has had a good helping of it as well- or you will repel them. And stay home for a while.

I'm not sure how to rate this. I love garlic sauce and I only used the given ingredients but my amounts were completely different. I used twice as much garlic and only olive oil to make the consistency similar to what I grew up with. I loved what I made but it wasn't the recipe here.

I will make a slight amendment that will make this sauce a bit thick:
1 head garlic, minced
1/2 a lemon juice (not 1/2 cup)
1 cup of oil (I use vegetable not olive)
1 teaspoon white vinegar
1 teaspoon mustard
1 egg white

Procedure: (you can use a regular blender or immersion blender, I prefer the immersion blender)

mince the garlic and place in the mixer bowl along with all ingredients except the oil
mix the above for 20 to 30 seconds
here is the trick:
start by adding the oil very very very slowly while continuing to mix, the oil should be added in a very thin line (not the whole amount) 
continue mixing and adding oil VERY slowly until the sauce becomes thick. usually it takes few minutes.

This is the best garlic sauce, and its used in restaurants.

I thought this was very good, however I did have some trouble getting it to thicken and added a bit of plain yogurt. (I went to the store earlier to get an immersion blender - it was even on sale!- and it got left behind with my shampoo!) I ate at a Greek restaurant that served this and was looking for a good recipe, that was when I stumbled across allrecipes.com and am now addicted! I served this with Shish Tawook,squash patties and skillet bread (didn't have time to make pitas). Will make this again having the blender to start with. Never heard of the egg white...hmmmm...

I'm not sure exactly how to review this. I used slightly less salt than called for, the juice of two lemons (slightly less than 1/2 a cup), and like another reviewer, I also added about a tablespoon of mayo. Most importantly, I halved the oil called for, using only 1/2 a cup of each. I blended for a total time of 5-10 minutes and, even with half the oil, this never got anywhere near the consistency of mayonnaise, which is what I am used to. The flavor is good, but I have no idea how to get the thicker consistency promised and desired, even with adding extra garlic.

This worked well, except I used 2 cups canola oil instead of the other oils.  I think that helped with the consistency.

I too ended up with a bowl of liquid. I tried egg whites, mayo...helped a little. The key to sauce being thick and creamy are two things (MUST USE) 1) IMMERSION BLENDER 2) "QUART SIZED JAR OR CUP". A bowl won't work!...at least for me it didn't. When I used the immersion blender WITH a quart sized cup, it came out perfect. Be sure to put the blender on the bottom of the cup or jar and let the suction work.

Way too salty and lemony and too much of an olive oil taste.  Followed the directions exactly except that I used lemon juice from a bottle.

I'd say that this is about as good as any restaurant garlic sauce. As a matter of fact, I've just recently started making my own again after our local favorite restaurant closed down (they made the best garlic sauce and bread!) I like that I can control the ingredients: so I used mostly olive oil and then added canola oil-probably 1/2 cup. I used the immersion blender to chop the garlic and then added the rest of the ingredients. I like the idea of using pasteurized egg whites to thicken, if necessary-but I didn't need to. You just need to add enough oil and add it slowly. I wonder if lighlty roasting the garlic first would get rid of that strong garlic "bite"? Then, I think my kids would love it even more.

The flavor was fine, but I could not get it anywhere close to the consistency of mayo. I even added some starch. I served this at a party with an Italian appetizer but had to tell people to stir the sauce before dipping because it was so separated.

Excellent, love this sauce. It didn't thicken as I added all the ingredients slowly and alternating but I had added a little oil and lemon juice first to be able to blend the garlic and salt. Next time I will try to puree the garlic with the salt and THEN start adding the liquids alternating. I used a little egg white and it did thicken. Also my mistake was making it in a wider bowl as opposed to a tall thin jar. I should have read all the reviews first before making it. However after adding the egg white and transferring to a tall jar it blended and thickened wonderfully. The taste is 5 star, the recipe is 4 since you have to read the reviews to get the recipe to thicken right.

FINALLY! A recipe for "garlic sauce" or "toum" that actually worked for me!

I used only canola oil (no olive oil), kosher salt, 8 cloves minced garlic, and the juice of one lemon.

I started by blending (with my immersion blender) the garlic, kosher salt and about 1/4 cup of the oil, just so I knew all the 'chucks' were broken up. After that I added the lemon juice and the rest of the olive oil. I blended with my immersion blender for almost 5 minutes and it was still soupy so I started experimenting. I added one egg white (helped a little) then I added 1T of ice water.. (HELPED A A LOT) the change was almost instantly thick white 'mayo'.

Taste was very good. But I had trouble. 

First time: followed ingredient proportions except only used 4 cloves of garlic. I blended for almost 20 minutes but sauce didn't thicken. I added an egg white and it became very thick instantaneously. 

Second time: exactly as first time but added 1/4C olive oil & 1/4C veg oil. Did not thicken. Added another egg white. Did not thicken. Added a third egg white. Still didn't thicken. It's sitting in the fridge right now. 

Not enough garlic? Suggestions??

This sauce is missing one VERY IMPORTANT ingredient to make it into the perfect textured garlic sauce...a raw egg white.  I know it may sound a little crazy but you will forget all about that little detail once you are eating it.  Other than that,  good recipe,  thanks alot.

This is a simple and tasty recipe. The quality of the olive oil can really make a difference - buy the slightly more expensive bottle.

Okay, so I was excited for this "fool proof" recipe but then initially had trouble with getting it to thicken up.  I think the secret is the temperature, not the egg white addition. I was blending it with my immersion blender and noticed that the liquid and my blender was getting warm/hot.  I blended it for quite some time and it was still liquid.  So I stopped, let it rest, read some reviews about letting it blend for longer, went back to it, and put my cooled-down immersion blender in and: voila! It was INSTANTLY thick. I read someone else talk about adding 1T of ice water which made it instantly thick. The flavor is AWESOME! I added less salt based on the reviews but everything else I followed to the T.

This was good and pretty close to what I've had in Lebanese restaurants (where it's called "Garlic Whip").  Once you put your immersion blender in it's kind of fascinating to watch it come together into a sauce.  I found using a whole head of garlic made it a little overwhelmingly garlicky the day I made it but oddly, when I had leftovers the next day the garlic taste had pretty much dissipated, so don't count on it lasting overnight.

I used a heaping teaspoon instead of a tablespoon, and it still came out really salty! I also just threw everything (garlic not even minced) in my immersion blender cup and went to town. I set my blender to 5 (out of 10) and the longer I blended, the thicker it got. It was totally thick enough for me, and I'm used to the stuff from Dearborn/Detroit.

Very good.  I made a smaller batch and I guess I used a little too much lemon juice, but otherwise it was terrific.  I can't wait to try again!

I use both kinds of oil but more olive than canola.  However, to make it really thick it needs to have less oil than called for.

Perfect and well written. I halved the sauce because I needed it for a salad dressing serving 6.

Love garlic sauce from my favorite Lebanese joint.  Didn't know I could make it!  It's about 90% like what I get in the restaurant.   I don't have a immersion blender, but, I have a magic blullet---so I slowly added the oils and it did thicken somewhat but, not enough--so I added one egg white (as suggested) and that did the trick.  A nice and thick sauce!

Peeling and pressing all that garlic is a bit tedious but it IS the star ingredient after all. I found it way too salty so next time it'll be less salt and less oil for me. I marinated lamb chops in this all day long and then I baked them slowly for an hour, drained off the juices then baked them a further 15 mins on high and they were truly awesome. My husband ate a heck of a lot of lamb that night!

Have made several times since recently discovering this recipe. Delicious. I'm finding lots of ways to use (like brush on veggies, or bread before grilling).  The first time I made it I peeled whole head of garlic, then decided to only use 1/2-2/3 as much oil as the recipe recommends, and adjusted the salt accordingly. My whole family loved it, so that's also what I've continued to do. The procedure recommended by Cremefraiche seems crucial.  I throw all the garlic cloves in (whole, not minced) with the coarse salt and use my immersion blender to get that fairly 'paste-y' before even starting to add oil. Then alternate oil/lemon juice. I didn't follow the procedure once and could NOT get it to thicken no matter what I did. I also believe those who say the vessel size is crucial, it must be a narrow vessel.

My boyfriend and I got hooked on the garlic sauce at a Lebanese restaurant but didn't always feel like driving the 35 minutes to get some when we had the craving. I tried this recipe and while mine isn't quite as thick as what we get at the restaurant, it tastes amazing. I usually make half what this one does but use the full bulb of garlic. As others have said, the immersion blender is key...this recipe does NOT work well in a food processor or regular blender.

I love this recipe.  I used canola oil, and it whipped up thick and white within seconds.  The immersion blender is key.  Fresh squeezed lemon juice- nice tang!

Perfect recipe!  I took the suggestions of other reviewers, and added the lemon and oil alternatively, a bit at a time.  This way I was able to get it exactly the way i like it.  i think in the end I used less olive oil, and a tiny bit less vegetable oil than the recipe called for, but I think this is based on personal preference.  Perfect recipe, this is exactly what I was looking for. 
Note: I also used about half the salt (I had to use plain table salt because it's all I had on hand).

I had some Lebanese pita bread, which I really like. I found this recipe remembering I had eaten it once with roast chicken, potatoes, salad, and pita bread from a restaurant. I did about 1/4 of the recipe and used only olive oil. This recipe is very close to the garlic dip I remember with that meal. Although, I couldn't quite get mine as thick as I remembered.

Thanks for the ingredient measurements.  I make this often but have always just "winged it" with the amounts. Have not had a problem with it thickening since I switched from a regular blender to the immersion type, but before I did ,I found a VERY small amount of powdered egg white (its pasturized for anyone concerned) thickened it in an instant.  Addicting!!

This is a great recipe. My local Lebanese restaurant hiked the price of their sauce by 100%, so I looked for a good recipe to make it myself. I followed the recipe exactly the first time and it came out rather powerful and salty. The consistency was nice and creamy, but the next day is started back separating. The seconde time I made it I put half the amount of salt and a drop of egg white and that made it super thick like mayo. PLEASE USE A HAND BLENDER IF YOU WANT IT TO EMULSIFY CORRECTLY.

TL;DR: USE FRESH, HIGH QUALITY INGREDIENTS IN A NARROW CONTAINER AND ADD OIL IN A SLOW DRIZZLE  WHILE BLENDER IS RUNNING FOR BEST RESULTS; WHEN DRIZZLED, YOU CAN USE YOUR COUNTERTOP BLENDER/FOOD PROCESSOR. EGG WHITE MAY HELP WITH GETTING RIGHT CONSISTENCY.  I used this recipe as a springboard to make a garlic sauce to my liking. The result was very good, but I do feel it necessary to point out the following for those newer to cooking and/or making this for the first time: 

1. Garlic sauce is basically an emulsion of oil and lemon juice with garlic and salt in the mix. Because of this, I would suggest combining everything EXCEPT THE OIL in your mixing container, and then start mixing that with your blender. Then add the oil in a slow, constant drizzle while the blender is running so that you can optimize the emulsion; just dumping it all at once is not a good emulsion technique and may not get you the desired consistency. 

2. Quite a few reviewers suggested adding egg white, which makes sense considering mayonnaise (a condiment with similar texture and also an emulsion) uses eggs as part of the emulsion process. I added one egg white to my garlic sauce which may be the reason why I used much less oil than the recipe called for (about 2-3 fluid ounces). I should also note that I used the juice of one lemon which yielded about 1/4 cup of juice, and about 8-10 garlic cloves.

3.   Another reviewer made the comment of using a tall, narrow container to emulsify the sauce with an

Made this twice, once runny the second time runny and slightly split. The correct way to add oil to the lemon juice would be to add it slowly not all at once.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would! I don't know why people are saying theirs was like soup, or didn't thicken up; also nothing needs to be added to this. I followed the ingredients list, but I only used one cup of canola oil. I used my immersion blender by first blending the garlic, salt and lemon juice. I slowly added my one cup of oil, and let me tell you, my sauce has the consistency of thick mayonnaise. There is no need to add an egg white, or cold water, or any thing else suggested by some reviewers. I couldn't stop eating it! This just goes to show why I follow a recipe then see for myself if there is a problem BEFORE I rate it. Very delicious!

I've been making this sauce many different ways.  This is the best.  Plus when you finish its already in the jar.   Genius.  Next time I'll reduce the salt.   Mine was very thick without egg.. I alternated but I got more heavy handed than you need to with a food processor/emulsion method because the immersion blender takes the liquid a bit at a time anyway.  Thank you!    Also, if you spread this sauce on tilapia or any thin filet of fish then sprinkle Parmesan and broil on parchment 4 minutes, flip and resauce, 4 minutes more its an amazing meal kids love.

Great recipe. So easy, I can't understand why some have had difficulty. I used a tall jar, immersion blender, and all the ingredients as stated. I blended the garlic and salt first, then added the oil and lemon juice. I got a great texture within moments. You have to use really fresh garlic. if the garlic has green sprouts in the cloves, the garlic taste will be unpleasantly strong(bitter). Makes a lot of sauce, but at least my family will not be complaining that we don't have enough!

Did it the first time with ingredients mentioned and it was a soup even when adding ice water and egg white.  red all reviews and tried again. Nabil got it right and it came out perfect. Here's what I did:
In a tall jar with a hand blender mix the following ingredients: 1 head of garlic, 1/2 tbsp corse sea salt, 1tsp white vinegar, 1 egg white and juice of 1/2 lemon (not half cup). 
Once mixed, about 30sec, very very very slowly add 1 cup of veg oil (not olive). It should take you 2-3 min to add the oil as you're doing it slowly and the result will be a very thick and fluffy garlic sauce. Yes it's potent but what do you expect. Enjoy folks!

My only complaint is that there was too much lemon. The consistency was just like I find in a Flint Michigan area restaurant, similar to mayonnaise, and I think with much less lemon, the flavor would match, as well. Thank you SO much!!!!

I didn’t have normal olive oil so I used 1.5cups canola oil + 0.5 EVOO. Still turned out great! I also added an extra head of garlic cos I like it spicy. Thank you for the emersion blender trick - this is the first time I’ve been successful (tried to use a food processor previously).

This garlic sauce is amazing -- so flavorful and rich, but yet extremely easy to make.  It rivals the garlic sauce of some of the popular Lebanese restaurants to which I've been.  It has a nice tangy flavor from the fresh lemons but if you don't like things too sour, cut back on the lemon juice a bit.  I think I will reduce the salt just a tad next time I make it just out of personal preference.   Overall, this sauce is fabulous.  You won't regret making it.

I rated this recipe a 5 star...tastes just like our best Lebonese restaurant here...I had a good recipe, but this one is the easiest and most authentic by far...the original recipe is good, but I used Loolamay14's alterations and also added 1 egg white which made it nice and thick and delicious..thanks so much for sharing this recipe :-)

This was just okay for us. There seemed to be a little too much lemon flavor; I was expecting it to be more subtle and complimentary to the garlic. Thanks for sharing! :)

This recipe is a winner. Over the years I have tried to make this with different implements, without success. Using the hand blender is ingenious. The consistency is perfect. Thank you so much!!! No more boring bbq's.

Made this this morning,way too watery, not thick at all.  The taste is great but way to thin for a thick sauce. Hopefully I can find a garlic sauce that is thick and creamy.

Flawless recipe.  Tastes *exactly* like the toum I get in my favorite restaurant (7 hour drive away, different country, only get there once every few years!!)

If you're keto, this is a GENIUS way to get extra fat in your diet.  I slather it on EVERYTHING. Throw a head of red cabbage in the food processor, combine a batch of this toum with it, and you have coleslaw for the entire week (its incredible). 

Be warned, you will smell of garlic, despite brushing your teeth and using listerine!  I recommend having your friends/companions eat some too so they don't notice it :)

Everything. I make a 1/4 recipe since no one else in my family likes garlic sauce. I just use 1/4 cups of oils and maybe 1/8 to 1/4 cup lemon juice and maybe 6 or 8 cloves of garlic.  I find it better than sauce from our favorite restaurants.  I don't have the super strong garlic breath after like I do after the restaurant versions.

When the directions call for a 1 qt jar and immersion blender., that's what you use. I have failed this recipe by trying to do it in my food processor...no dice. Exact same ingredients but followed the instructions, it's so thick I can't believe it.

Super good! I also added the egg white for the thicker texture and it worked great. Also let the sauce cool in the fridge for a few minutes before eating. I had a taste after I blended it and it tasted off, but after chilling the correct flavor came through. I also might cut down a bit on the lemon. It was a tad tart for my liking.

If you love Bucharest style sauce from  Detroit, this is about as close as you can get.

I made this following Najib's variation, but I modified it slightly.  I substituted 5 tbsp lemon juice in place if half lemon and 5 tsp garlic for a head of garlic and reduced salt from a TBSP to 1/2 TBSP.  I also don't currently own an immersion blender, so I used a regular stand up type.  You use what you have, right? I'm making shish tawook tonight and wanted to try this as recommended by other cooks.  It turned out fantastic! Thick and garlicky.  Delicious.

Excellent recipe - I followed the directions exactly, although I did use  less oil, as another reviewer suggested.  I used 1 1/4 cups of canola-olive blend. I imagine using 2 cups of oil produces a sauce more like mayonnaise in consistency. We prefer the thicker type. I also reduced the amount of lemon juice and salt, but that was just for personal preference. 

You MUST use an immersion blender (hand blender / stick blender) and a narrow container (just wide enough for the blender blade), and place the blender blade at the bottom of the container at first. The action of the blade draws down and circulates the oil-garlic mixture. As the sauce thickens you can slowly raise the blender. The mixing container that came with the immersion blender was just the right size and shape, and I was amazed that the sauce started to thicken within seconds. And the final product - superb! The sauce held its form perfectly (did not separate)  for the three days before it was all gone.

It worked perfectly fine with my food processor.  I realized last minute I was out of lemons so I substituted with diluted white vinegar and it worked fine. A little fluffier than what I am used to but great tasting.

We followed the direction with the exception of using a fresh lemon. Now we are making a second batch with much less salt, we also did not use all the oil, we just added it slowly and quit when it looked great.

Have never actually written a review but here it goes.
Trying to cut down on oil, I followed 
 LOOLIMYA14's recipe.
Got too impatient waiting for it to thicken. So I added some roasted Cashews (rinsed salt).
It was GREAT!
Then I got the smart idea to put in NutriBullet.. Don't ask why 
My wand blended was going a good job nuts and all.
Of course the sauce separated. 
But it STILL taste a yummy.
Put some on my lunch veggies.
Oh YES!!
Thanks for a keeper!!

Great idea but it doesn't work.  I think the old blender or food processor method is better - this is just an oily, garlicky mess.  I really hoped it would work because it would be so much easier and quicker but, alas, it never got thick at all or creamy ... and I let the immersion blender work on it for about 10 minutes. .  I hate to throw it out so I'll use the garlicky oil for sauteing veggies.

My first attempt at making mayonnaise and it turned out pretty good.  A bit too salty and waaay to lemony for mine and my families liking though - I ended up adding a bit of store-bought Mayo to the final product just to dilute the taste down a bit.

Great recipe! I didn't have vegetable oil on hand so I only used olive oil (and doubled it). I also used a mix of lemon and lime juice. My sauce came out a little bit sour so I added a bit of sugar. Lastly, my sauce was a little runny so I added some mayonnaise as another reviewer suggested to thicken it up. Definitely will use this recipe again. 10/10!

Not only is this so tasty, but it was fun to make!  We do not like mayo and this is a wonderful substitute since it has a similar consistancy yet NO EGGS.    Absolutely yummy!

Followed the changes suggested by Loolamay14,  and found it still a little too salty/lemony .  I added an extra half head of garlic, but it was still was a bit much.  Glad I didn't add ALL the salt the recipe called for!  Will adjust for next time. Thanks!

This reminds me of the garlic sauce from Dearborn. It is strong and rich, I did make it using 2 whole heads of garlic but I wouldn't change it.

WOW! This was SO good! I made this with my own hummus recipe and the Syrian Bread recipe on this site. Everything tasted just like a Middle-Eastern restaurant. The garlic sauce did turn out just a little too liquidy, but I think I added too much olive oil. (I will start with less next time and gradually add more.) Mine was still delicious, though! I will make this again!

I love this stuff! I halved the oil and added about 1/2 cup drained canned chickpeas. Immersion blender is definitely the only way to go - unsuccessfully tried the food processor and regular blender first.

Just finished making this to have with dinner tonight, and am hoping the garlic flavor mellows out a bit as it chills, it's got a pretty strong bite to it. I slowly added the oils and lemon juice, alternating them, and used an immersion blender. It was fairly thick, but not quite the mayo texture I'm used to, so instead of egg white I added about a teaspoon of merengue powder and it thickened up beautifully. Might try this in the food processor next time, my immersion blender was heating up!

Love the flavor but the amount of oil in this is a heart attack waiting to happen.  Do use less olive oil and more vegetable oil since the olive oil flavor can overwhelm the sauce.  I added 1 egg but even with this, did not get the mayonnaise consistency I was looking for.  This makes a ton.  I wanted to make less but you have to keep adding oil to get it thicker so in the end, you will get a lot of sauce.
