Wow!  I made this exactly as the recipe is written, except that I divided it in half because I have a small quart-size ice cream maker.  I toasted the coconut along with the pecans; 350 degrees for about 10 minutes - watch them closely and stir them often.  I used the cookie pieces style of pecans because I like how small they are.  I did a 24 hour chill in the fridge, mixed it up one night, made it the next night and this made it REALLY smooth and creamy.  I'm sure if you mixed it up in the morning and made it that night it would be fine, but it does need to cool down quite a bit to keep the ice crystals from forming and also to help it get really frozen.  I guess you could consider that a drawback since you can't decide to make this and have ice cream 40 minutes later, like you could with no cook recipes.  But, trust me, it is WELL WORTH the wait.  My husband said it's the best ice cream he's ever had and then ate enough to prove it.  I've already hidden a small bowl of it behind the frozen peas in the freezer to make sure I get more than one bowl!  Every ice cream maker is different, of course, but it came out of mine like a real thick soft serve style and after being in the freezer over night, it's hardened up nicely, but still scoopable.  Definitely a keeper!  I didn't have any caramel sauce, but I think this would put it over the top.  I'll be trying that next time.

Just to comment on the person who said the ice cream was grainy. Although I have not had this problem with this ice cream recipe, i did have it happen with another custard based recipe.  I let the warm mixture cook too long. It had started to boil around the edges of the pan. It turned out grainy.  Per "The Perfect Scoop" by David Lebovitz, when cooking the custard for a custard-based ice cream, it is done when it just begins to steam. Test it by running your finger down a spatula or wooden spoon that is coated with the mixture. It is done when your finger leaves a definite trail that doesn't flow back together.  He also suggests immediately removing the mixture to a separate bowl and sitting this bowl in an ice bath in a larger bowl, and stir frequently until the mixture cools. I always do this now with custard based recipes.  It also helps shorten the cooling time.  I can make the custard in the morning and have the ice cream ready that evening.

This frozen custard turned out great with a very smooth and creamy texture. I only had 2 ounces of german chocolate, so I added some dark cocoa powder to the mixture. I used my Kitchen Aid Ice Cream Attachment and for your information this recipe will fill the canister to full capacity. I had a little bit of ice cream coming out of the top as it was churning. I will absolutely be making this recipe again!

I agree with other reviews, this is the best! The only change I would make is cut back on the sugar a little next time. I layered it in a Tupperware with a drizzle of caramel sauce in between.  Divine! (Needed to halve the recipe for my Cuisinart ice cream maker)

This is a fantastic recipe. I used full fat half & half instead of whip or heavy cream and I didn't have 6 ounces of german chocolate so I used 3 1/2 ounces of milk chocolate bar and 2 1/2 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate squares. There are little chocolate specks in my ice cream but its still phenomenal! I also toasted my coconut and pecans together as other viewers did. This chocolate ice cream recipe is definitely a new base for me.

This is a great recipe! Loved the suggestion to toast both coconut and pecans together. I substituted coconut extract for the vanilla, added some caramel sundae syrup and about 1 Tbsp Godiva liqueur (keeps it from becoming a brick when frozen) toward the end of freezing. Excellent! I tried making it with low fat half and half and 1% milk - good, but much less creamy. Will definitely make this again. Thanks!

I don't really like chocolate ice cream but couldn't pass this up when I saw the title.  I made it exactly as written but halved everything.  It was incredible.  I may add more pecans next time since they're my favorite.

This was grainy and way too sweet.  And that was without adding the coconut.

This has got to be the best home made ice cream I have ever eaten.  It has a rich, thick texture (not thin like most home made ice creams) and absolutely delicious! The preparation is well worth the wait.

Loved this! Never made a base before for ice cream but it is well worth it. Truly the best ice cream I have ever had and worth the hassle. Burnt the coconut and pecans but they were still good.

This is the BEST Ice Cream I have ever eaten!  Served it to my Bunko Group last night (with homemade German Chocolate Cake) and everyone wanted to lick their plate it was so good.   I read the reviews and all seem to agree with me except one .....clearly that person did something wrong - so if you love fabulous ice cream,  this is amazing!

It is better than haagen-dazs!!! So goood! I make ice-cream for my kids time to time, but this was the first time with custard base. It came up wonderfully. I cooked, then cooled in a cold water (kids couldn't wait overnight), put in a freezer for about an hour, wipped heavy cream (from raw milk), added to cooled custard and combined using a mixer. Put half in an ice-cream maker and viola! it is wonderfull even soft.Oh, and I didn't have nuts or coconut, and had only one cup of brown sugar. Still came up creamy, sweet and REAL!:-)

We loved it!  I ran out of time, though, and didn't get the coconut and pecans added to it.  Oldest child pronounced it the best homemade ice cream she'd ever eaten.

I made it with 4 oz semi sweet chocolate and 2 oz of bittersweet chocolate because that is what I had on hand.  I was looking for a plain chocolate recipe, so I omitted the coconut and nuts.  I also used about 1 cup of half and half instead of all heavy cream.  It was amazing and I will make again.

This was very good.  I used half and half, used half the sugar, and added swirls of caramel since german chocolate cake would have it and that is what I wanted this to taste like.
