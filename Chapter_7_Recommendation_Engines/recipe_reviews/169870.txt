I am indonesian, and this dish tastes really good and just like the original indonesian fried noodles. I left out salt since the sauce added the saltiness to the dish. I also reduced the amount of soy , oyster and Indonesian sweet soy sauce ( a little bit less than 1/4 cup each ).  I will definitely put this on my regular menu list.

Fantastic! I also used garlic powder in place of the garlic salt. Also doubled the cabbage & used a bag of stir-fry veggies. We all loved it!

This is an easy, yummy recipe. I didn't have shallots, broccoli, or mushrooms, so I used extra carrots and cabbage and added a bag of frozen stir-vegetables. I also left out the oyster sauce. I would definitely say that this recipe doesn't need any added salt, though. The soy sauce makes it plenty salty. This recipe is really easy and tastes great!

Awesome recipe!  Thank you for posting it.  I am a little sqeemish when it comes to fish sauces or oyster sauce, so as an FYI for anyone wondering what they could substitute the oyster sauce with:

1) Look for a vegetarian "oyster" sauce - not a single oyster in it, but still mocks the flavor of it

2) Do a mixture of one part hoisin, two parts teriyaki and 2-3 dashes of worchestire.  Some garlic and onion wouldn't hurt either if you wish

For this recipe the ratio for 1/4C (4 TBSP) would be:
3 TBSP Teriyaki, 1 TBSP Hoisin and 2-3 dashes of worchestire

I have subbed both versions in this recipe with excellent results!

I would say 2 pkgs of noodles is plenty. Undercook them at first because you will be simmering them in the pan at the end. It was pretty good the first time around but I would definitely double the vegetables and make sure to cut the broccoli into smaller size florets so they're done at the same time as the rest of the vegetables.

Followed the recipe except I used a two lb bag of fresh noodles from the Chinese grocery instead of 9 oz of ramen.  The amount of soy saucy-ness was still a lot for a homestyle dish! It was about what you would expect in a restaurant. I also cooked the meat and the veggies separately so I could control how done everything got. Good dish, very easy to make especially with a food processor doing the chopping and shredding. Just cut back on the sauce or up the noodles. Would be fine with other meats or tofu instead of chicken.

This was good.  I used lo mein noodles instead of Ramen because Ramen are fried.  Otherwise followed recipe. We really enjoyed this. Thanks for the recipe

I was in Bali for 6 weeks on a surf trip. Ate this every morning for breakfast. I have tried this a few times but never came out like I wanted. This recipe is the closest I have found. It's really good. I think I over cooked the noodles a little. I used spinach instead of cabbage.

My family couldn't stop raving about this meal. My husband asked for a glass of wine to refresh his palate after every delicious bite. I scaled the recipe to serve 3, but used 2 packages of noodles. I made my own Indonesian sweet soy sauce using 2 TBS soy to 3 TBS brown sugar, boiling  it to a smooth syrup, then adding the oyster & soy sauce. I will have to make it again...and again! PS: a small 8oz of chicken breast is all that's needed to serve 3 people - sliced very thin, of course. With all the other vegetables & noodles, it was enough. This recipe is a winning budget recipe.

Big hit with family!  Did not use the Indonesian soy sauce due to my budget.  Still had great flavor.  Next time will cook the veggies just a tad longer.  I bought a bag of coleslaw mix to get cabbage and carrots.  The shred was a little small, but worked well enough without having to buy a whole cabbage.

This was wonderful!!  If I could rate it more than 5 stars, I would.  I boiled chicken on the bone and then shredded it off.  I did not use shallots, mushrooms, or sweet soy sauce (used regular) because I did not have these items.  My 2 1/2 year old daughter kept on saying mmmm while eating this.   This dish if the best!!  Thanks so much for sharing!!

My family loved these noodles.  I used leftover chicken, and fresh zucchini, mushrooms, cabbage and grated carrots.  I used fresh ramen noodles bought at a restaraunt.  It took 15 minutes to make and it was gone in one day!  Will definately make again.

I don't know if it is authentic or not, but it tasted great.  Excellent for a quick evening meal and the leftovers were good too.  My step dad grew up in Indonesia and I know he would have approved (although he would have put in heaps of chilli).

Very good, and quite easy!  I used tofu instead of chicken and didn't add any additional salt.  I'm tempted to switch the ramen noodles for a different variety next time; ramen noodles are good, but the sauce is so rich that I feel like it might stand up well to a thicker noodle.

This was a very good base. I used brown rice noodles instead of ramen, and hoisin instead of oyster sauce. I could not find sweet soy sauce anywhere, so I just heated a bit of brown sugar with the soy sauce. We enjoyed this. I might consider omitting the cabbage next time, but that's just personal preference. Thanks for sharing!

Had all the ingredients since I usually make fried rice a lot.  Was even more inspired to make this since I had leftover chicken and pre-cut fresh veggies from the green grocers and that would save me time.  The whole thing took 10 minutes to prepare and cook.  Turned out great and my son asked for seconds.  Will definitely be part of my instant-dinner recipes.

This was absolutely delicious.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and it really was plenty for 3 servings.  I added quite a bit more cole slaw mix (cabbage) but otherwise followed the recipe to a tea, using only 1/2 tablespoon of oil for the whole meal.   I didn't have sweet soy sauce so I used citrus infused soy sauce and it made it really good.  I will definitely be making this again when I get a "hankerin'" for chinese food.  Thank you Felicia for a wonderful recipe.

Way too salty!  It's a good start, but I think the soy sauce could be eliminated entirely.  

I timed the noodles exactly, and they came out too soggy, so I think the cooking time for those could be reduced significantly.

We used shrimp instead of chicken (adding at the end because they cook quickly).  Also, I did sub garlic powder for garlic salt...still too much salt.

I am Indonesian born and I made this recipe because I miss mie goreng. I was a little disappointed at how incredibly sweet this recipe turned out. I had to add one more package of ramen to diffuse the sweetness. Even then, it was still too sweet. If I make it again, I would cut the sugar and sweet soy sauce by half and I would omit the oyster sauce because it is not something a traditional Indonesian recipe uses.

This was fantastic!  I substituted beef for chicken.  Because stewing beef was all I had on hand, I cooked it in the pressure cooker (about 10 minutes, then let sit until pressure released) with a bit of water, a teaspoon of vinegar (to soften) a few teaspoons of soya sauce, lots of black pepper, and a whole head of crushed garlic.  Then, did the remaining recipe as listed, just substituting broad rice noodles for the ramen due to allergies (and cooking the noodles in the remaining "beef water").  Even my picky kids, after commenting that it was colourful (a bad thing, in their eyes) due to the broccoli, carrots, and purple cabbage (what I had on hand!), both had second servings.

Great easy recipe! I used fresh chow mein egg noodles instead of ramen noodles and it tasted pretty darn close to the mee goreng instant noodle packages, but better and without the extra sodium. Will make again!

I thought this was really good.   I will definitely  Make this again.    I did not use oyster sauce as I don't like the taste.   I did not find the sweet soy sauce.   After reading some reviews and reading that it was to salty I went with lite soy sauce and only used 1/3 a cup of it.

This was quick and tasty. I served it over spaghetti since I didn't have ramen noodles. My husband found it a bit dry (I cut down on the soy sauce since it would have been way too salty), and I would have liked some additional spices, but it's overall a healthy, delicious supper.

This is a quick, plentiful meal. I used 10 oz Chinese thin egg noodles and slightly more vegetables. The chicken was slightly bland, next time I might try marinating it in some of the soy/oyster/kecap manis before cooking.

I followed the recipe exactly except I added some extra veggies and I didn't have any sweet soy sauce so I just added some brown sugar to the sauce.  This was really delicious and fast...and it used up a bunch of veggies that needed to be eaten!  YUM!  Thanks!

Keeper! After tasting this, my daughter requested that I make this for her bday lol which is in 4.5 months. Little minor changes such as boiling the noodles for a minute or until it starts to seperate, used garlic powder (did not have garlic salt), and added salt to taste only. Although, the sauce tasted amazing, I think I will cut it down, just enough to coat everything. Thank you!

We loved this...  Used thin spaghetti noodles and omitted the sweet soy sauce (couldn't find it), otherwise followed closely.  Quick easy and delish!  I'll make again with recommend noodles, if I remember to pick them up from the store ;)  Thanks for sharing!!

Excellent recipe.  I used a 10 oz pkg of chinese noodles instead of the ramen noodles.  I also used reduced-sodium soy sauce.

I'm new to cooking and the recipe was straightforward.  I would definitely make again. Only bad thing is that the dish came out much too salty (likely the amount of soy sauce/oyster sauce). Next time I will add in the sauces slowly and taste as I go.

Lovely recipe.  I love Indonesian Ketchap.  I use it in a ground beef mixed with loads of bean sprouts and served over rice.  A recipe from my Indonesian friend Okie.

I made it nearly as written with exception of adding any salt (garlic salt or regular salt).  I did make the mistake of adding salt to the water for making the noodles.   We liked this overall but would use low sodium soya sauce in future as we found it salty.  I made my own ketjap-manis.

Great  recipe but needs tweaking. I lived in Bali for 3 months and loved this dish. I was really craving it lately and tried out this recipe based on ratings.  It came out OK. The problem was it was way too sweet. Next time I’ll use a tablespoon of kecap and oyster sauce. Also I added a fried egg on top like they serve in Bali.

This was really good.  Takes a lot of prep with cutting all the veggies.  Next time I'll use much less soy sauce.

Just came back from Bali and decided to take this to a friend's party.   I used half the Oyster sauce (I don't like too much fishy) and added Hoisin sauce and some hot sauce to kick it up.  Everyone loved it and three people asked for the recipe.

very nice.  I added some ginger to make it taste more like the one we use to eat in The Netherlands.
