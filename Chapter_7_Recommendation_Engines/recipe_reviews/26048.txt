The taste is wonderful.  I did use canned pineapple and it turned out well.  I put it between a recipe on this site - Rave Review Coconut Cake - and it looks fantastic. I will use this on a lot of cakes that I bake that requires a filling.

Delicious.  It reminds me of a custard.  I also subsituted strawberries for the pinapple and it turned out great as well.  I'm sure you can use just about any fruit, very versitile. Thanks!

I used this filling for my pineapple filled pineapple buttercream cupcakes.  Delish!!  I changed the amount of butter to 2 Tablespoons.  Also, I used 1 1/2 cups of pineapple and pineapple juice.  Be sure to beat the egg & pineapple juice  before adding the pineapple pieces.  Then add the whole thing to pot.  Stir frequently or you'll get strings of egg.

To me, this was a good starting point. The texture is really nice. But the recipe as written is all sweet and not enough tart... really cloying and not a very bright flavor. If I didn't know it was a pineapple filling, I'd have to take a second to figure out the flavor; I imagine that when I use it to fill my cake, the flavor will get kind of "lost" because it's so dull. I added 1 tbsp. lemon juice to the filling, which helped a little. I usually make a pineapple filling with nearly-pureed pineapple, and I think the next time I make this, I'll treat the pineapple this way instead of just chopping it. I'll also cut the sugar in half. And definitely use lemon juice, maybe as much as 2 tbsp.

Excellent!  I made this the night before, and the next day I mixed it with about 1/2 C fresh whipped cream.  I used it for the filling in a Pineapple Chiffon cake.  This could be varied with just about any kind of fruit.  What a great recipe!

I doubled this last night and when it was done, I put in in a buttered glass dish and made it into a crisp (using the topping from Apple Crisp II). The only change I made was adding only half the amount of juice, because that was all I had. It was really yummy, just a bit too sweet. I will probably add only 1/2 the amount of sugar next time. Great recipe!

This filling came out very good. A bit on the sweet side though. I used canned pineapple and found it worked out fine.

The recipe was very easy and didn't require a lot of kitchen know how.  It was also very tasty and my child's teachers and staff at the school loved the cake that I put the filling between.

My hubby and toddler loved this filling inside of a plain yellow cake.  It was easy to make, and I substituted fresh pineapple and juice for 1 canned crushed pineapple.

i cut up a whole pineapple and i'm the only one in my family who will eat pineapple - and we live in hawaii...go figure!  yes! it's very custard-like and sooo delicious!  super simple to make.  i beat the egg before adding but basically dumped everything in pot and stirred often.  i increased the butter to 2T and didn't have quite enough liquid so i added more pineapple.  i also added a teaspoon of vanilla at the end w/the butter.  i followed 17sugars advice of making a crisp out of it and have half a batch baking right now in the oven.  mmmmm...smells delish!  next, am going to use other reviewers idea to make pineapple creamy centers in cupcakes!
addition:  ok - pineapple crisp came out - excellent!  sprayed a disposable pan and made half a recipe w/oatmeal, flour, brown sugar, melted butter, salt and a dash of cinnamon.  wanted to post a picture but can't find connector cord to computer :(

Excellent filling! Thanks to the reviews that I read which helped me greatly because I only had canned crushed pineapple and saw one reviewer who used it successfully.  Also followed another review who did it right on direct heat in a saucepan.  Both variations worked and the filling turned out terrific which I used to fill a jelly roll  and topped with coconut....delicious!

Excellant! Big hit with all my friends and the ladies at the church bake sales. They can't wait for my cakes with this filling as they can sell them whole.
I don't use a double boiler, I just stay with it and stir..

Did not use double boiler. Just pot over med low heat. Whisked egg and juice then added pineapple. Stirred that into dry ingredients in pot. Stirred constantly until thick (@15 minutes). Didn't taste right in pot- but used it to fill 2 layer yellow cake. Once frosted and refridgerated- the cake was a hit and the filling was AWESOME!!! So if you don't think it tastes right when you take it off the stove- don't worry! It will be fabulous!! This would be good filling a cake, filling a biscuit or filling a spoon. Might have to make this cake again REAL SOON!!

Very yummy and easy too.  I used canned crushed pineapple in pineapple juice rather than fresh pineapple and the results were delicious, a perfect thickness for filling!

Really good recipe. But I had to make it twice to get it right. I don't have a double boiler, so I put a smaller pot in a larger pot. The first time, it never got thick enough. Frustrated, I put the mix in the fridge and thought I could just use it as a topping for ice cream. The next day, I tried it again. This time it took FOREVER, but it eventually thickened up. I realized that the first batch never thickened up because the pot never got hot enough. So, I grabbed the previous batch from the fridge and put it in a pot directly on the burner on low. And it actually thickened up quickly! The end result is a wonderful filling. Thanks again for the recipe.

I loved it!  So easy and tasted so good!  (I couldn't stop eating it right out of the bowl!)  In a pinch I used a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple (unsweetened) in place of the fresh pineapple and juice.  Everything else I kept the same and it turned out perfectly! I'm definitely adding this one to my list!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!!

Absolutely delicious!  I used canned pineapple instead of fresh.  Therefore, I only had 1/4 cup of juice.  I added 1/2 cup of mango juice to the pineapple juice and...awesome results!  I also added another tablespoon of butter, just because...  This filling really dressed up a boxed, butter recipe cake mix that I made as a simple week night dessert.  Quick, easy, and tasty!  My kind of recipe!

This filling was perfect for using in between cake layers! The consistency was great, and the texture was smooth while still imparting that tangy pineapple flavor. Delicious!

This is so delicious on top of a cake made with coconut and rum.  It sets up like a little bit loose pudding so the perfect topping for a cake or a filling.  Thank you so much Traci for posting this easy, delicious recipe.  Oops, I, too, used canned pineapple and was short about 2 T of the juice so just added some water.

My 9 year old made this for a cake filling.  We do not have a double boiler and he just cooked it in a sauce pan.  It turned out perfectly and totally delicious!  I will be using this recipe often!

great recipe. very easy to make.  used this with a pineapple mandarin orange cake and it was wonderful with a cream cheese frosting.  I also tried it another time and substituted the pineapple for fresh raspberries and used it as a filling for vanilla cupcakes.

I use canned crushed pineapple, and this recipe produces a custard-y filling so creamy and fruity, it could be dessert by itself!  I use it as a filling in coconut cake.

Traci...this is amazing - thank you so much for submitting this! I was looking for a filling for a multi-layer carrot cake (not from this site). My husband loved it, and ate a good majority of it straight from the bowl. So tasty. Will use this again. Thank you!

Too much flour--it had paste like texture and flour taste.  I had to doctor it up to cut the paste by adding lemon juice, apricot brandy, vanilla and pineapple preserve--so much better!  Next time...oops, there won't be a next time.

This recipe was very good! I also added about 1/2 brick of cream cheese and thought that it gave it an even better flavor.

Delicious!  Very, very easy to make in the microwave.  I used a 20-oz. can of crushed pineapple in place of the fresh pineapple and juice.  I stirred together the sugar, flour and salt, then added the can of pineapple w/juice and the egg and mixed it well.  I put it in my microwave and cooked at 1-minute intervals, stirring well between each interval.  At about 3 minutes, it started to thicken.  Around 4 minutes, it was ready to go.  I pulled it out and added the butter.  I have a high-powered microwave, so different microwave ovens might take longer.  Much easier then messing with a double-boiler and stirring.

Tried this with canned and then fresh pineapple. Even when I added pineapple extract, it didn't taste so good.

Delicious, I just made this and it tastes divine. For those who had issues with it thickening, patience is the key! Just keep whisking until it gets to the proper consistency. I will definitely take a picture after I assemble my cake. Using a vanilla bean cake,using the filling and topping with a coco lopez buttercream. can't wait to try it.

i made this filling to go in a yellow buttermilk cake with cream cheese frosting. it turned out very good together. the tandy buttermilk flavor worked with this sweet filling. it did take a little bit longer to thicken than i expected but i am very impatient sometimes lol. i just wasn't sure what to expect so it seemed like forever.(no i am not 5 yrs old lol) i also used canned pinapple.

I haven't made this but I want to try it! I have a question though.  I am planning to make my sisters wedding cake and am looking for the perfect filling.  The problem is, the cake will be covered with fondant, and therefore won't be refrigerated.  I am wondering if this filling will spoil.

Oh my goodness. This is so good! I did cut the sugar as others suggested (1/3c) and I used  orange juice in place of the pineapple juice. I served it warm over some flour tortilla nachos made with cinnamon & sugar. Yummy!!

Nice pineapple curd recipe. I used fresh golden pineapple, 2 egg yolks instead of one whole egg, increased butter to 2 tablespoons and a dash of lemon juice (as suggested by another reviewer). I was too lazy to use a double boiler and just stirred constantly. Nice, thick, rich. Chop up the pineapple into small pieces so it cooks well.

This turned out quite well cooking over a diffuser, which is how I cook most foods that suggest a double boiler.
I made this as directed once, with fresh pineapple and the recipe was very good, not to sweet.  I made it a second time with canned pineapple and reduced the sugar by more than half, and it was just as good.  I haven't read all the reviews so don't know if anyone mentioned fresh pineapple is not nearly as sweet as canned, so make the adjustment.  Most people is US will probably use canned, those of us in tropical climates where pineapples are almost free, will use fresh:).
I only gave this 4 stars because it has a slight floury taste, after cooking way long enough to cook it, and it needs a little something for oomph.  I'm not sure what, but I'll figure it out the next time I make it.  Today was an emergency so no time to play.   Thank you for a very simple recipe, quick to make, and versatile on top of it.

As another reviewer suggested, I just used a pot over med/low heat rather than a double boiler and it turned out great. Be sure to stir continuously though. It thickened up in less than 10 min. this way. I did reduce the sugar as well, but that is just my preference in most recipes. Made a great filling for a layered carrot cake, adding the sweetness carrot cake lacks.

This is a fantastic recipe. You HAVE to use the fresh pineapple! It gives such great flavor.  For those of you who used canned pineapple that is probably what made it "too" sweet.  I made this today and it turned out great! I am serving it in small dishes with meringue on top for dessert tonight!

i used this filling in a gluten free carrot cake with cream cheese frosting. i used gluten free all-purpose flour and substituted mango/peach/orange juice for the pineapple juice because that's all i had. when it thickened, i added lemon juice to taste. after reading the other reviews, i thought that the lemon juice would counter-act any excessive sweetness. i found these substitutions to work very well. no one knew the difference! this is a great base recipe and i will use the other suggestions in the future (i.e. apples, strawberries, etc.). thanks!!!

I used this recipe to fill Tassie cups I made and did not have enough pecan filling. I used unsweeten pipeapple in the can crushed already, the big can. It was wonderful and worked well. Next time I make it I will try it with Splendra to help cut calories.

very yummy! I used this recipe to fill some turnovers and they were soooo good too. I didnt have a double broiler (one of those things I say I'm always goona buy...) anyway, I put it all in a small pot on low heat and it cooked fine for me. I hadnt enough pineapple juice, so I added a little lemon juice which was nice. And for the finale on blunders...I filled my turnovers, and went to get an egg to brush the tops of them and remembered that this recipe called for 1 egg. I was through with myself, but I said nothing and no one complained that something was missing and the taste was really great. Will use this again, next time with the egg included.

I used this as a filling for a layered cake and thought it was pretty good but I would have liked it to be a little sweeter.  However, my main problem with this was that I couldn't get it to thicken at all so I had to add cornstarch to get it the right consistency.

Wonderful flavor and very easy to make.  I used it as filling in a pound cake shaped like a pineapple for my daughters birthday and received great reviews from everyone.
