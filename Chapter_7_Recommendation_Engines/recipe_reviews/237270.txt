I prepared this exactly as written. I agree with other reviews that cilantro would be a great addition. What I really didn't like was the dressing. This would be much better with cilantro vinaigrette or even ranch.

I made this before reading any of the reviews and added cilantro because I had it on hand. It's a delicious addition. I actually liked the dressing because it's a little different - I made it with a mixture of lemon and lime juices. I will definitely be making it again.

This was very good! I made it the other day for my boyfriend and I for lunch. This is a very hardy salad. We didn't have feta so we used pepper jack. Very good. I definitely recommend!

It was pretty good. My husband doesn’t like dressing, or avocado, or fun... haha... I am up for anything, he’s a more critical eater. Kids liked it enough to not argue about eating it, they didn’t LOVE it, but liked it enough with taco seasoned chicken and some ranch dressing or sour cream on the side. I liked it with sour cream and the dressing it calls for.

This is phenomenal! I've made this for several people who have raved about it. Even my husband, who never eats salad and is a meat-and-potatoes-guy loves this and requests it often!

Delicious & healthy combo. I omitted the tortilla chips & added some sliced chicken sausage for extra protein. I also used diced garden zucchini instead of cucumber.

OMG this was the best!  However I made it for my family as a dinner and added chicken breast to it but when I cooked the chicken breast I cooked on stove with olive oil and added taco seasoning to the chicken breast simmered for a bit; then served with ranch salad dressing for my kids.  And it was a huge hit then want it at least once a week!

I like to serve salad in a salad bar setting with an assortment of dressing.  Works out perfect for our diverse family.  Personally, I didn't like this dressing.

Delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, with one exception.  I doubled the dressing.  Everyone loved it, and the very small amount of leftovers were even good the next day.

Used mixed greens rather than lettuce. It was very good! Especially the dressing. (I did use cumin.) Served with blue tortilla chips.

Basic salad is really good but left off the pickled cucumbers & used Mexican cheese instead. Topped with the Creamy Cilantro Lime Dressing and it was the best! Many compliments as I took this to a New Years Party to share. Went great with all the other Mexican dishes and we'll continue to make this again and again. thank you!

This has delicious potential. Just needs a little more or a little different dressing. Just needs a little more flavor.

I topped the salad with grilled chicken breast and tossed it with Cilantro-Lime vinaigrette that includes fresh jalapeño. It made a huge hit for dinner!

I would make this again. I used twice as much real lemonade in place of the lemon juice called for in the dressing, because that is what we had on hand.

Had all the ingredients that I love, but the dressing was too sour for us. I would have preferred cheddar or pepperjack cheese and maybe some cilantro.

I found this a little bland. Maybe more dressing, or zestier dressing, or some salsa on top would have helped.

This was just OK, but I have a feeling that it could be great with a few minor changes. In my opinion, the feta cheese made it too salty. The next time I make it,  I will use medium Cheddar or old Cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese.  I will also try lime juice instead of the lemon juice and serve sour cream and salsa on the side. With these changes, I think it will be a hit !

This is a fabulous, fresh-flavored salad. Use fresh-squeezed lemon juice for the dressing and throw in about 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro for a truly amazing crowd-pleaser! I used 3 heads Romaine , chopped, since I prefer to chop my own rather than buy pre-cut. Doubled the dressing but kept everything else the same. It was gone in a flash! Great recipe!

My whole family likes this salad. It makes a nice side dish to empanadas or quesidillas. 
To us, no way we would have this salad without the dressing. The only change I  make is using the whole can of beans. Once the can is opened,  might as well use it all up and at the same time  pump up the protein and fiber value of the salad. Also,when available, I crumble some Queso Fresco on top.

I love this salad!  Love isn't even quite the word.  Obsessed is more like it!  Just the way it's written is perfect.  I've made it for the third time in a month today.  I added some crispy chicken.  SO GOOD.

I made this salad for a potluck church dinner and it was a hit. When dinner was over I didn't have any leftovers. It was delicious. I didn't have any cucumbers so I substituted it for zucchini, and I added cilantro.

I made this salad for dinner last night and it was scrumptious!  I forgot about the crushed tortilla chips, but not a big deal.  It tastes fresh and the hint of cumin makes me happy.  I like the idea of adding cilantro that I've seen in the comments, so I'll have to try that next time.  This recipe is a real keeper!

Excellent!  I took this to a dinner party and it was a hit.  I followed the recipe with the addition of cilantro.  It took a little longer to prepare then I expected due to vegetable chopping, but it was worth it.

Only left out cucumbers but added some diced red bell pepper...otherwise followed recipe. It was a big hit! The lemon tang in the dressing was wonderful! Will be making this very often and also using the dressing on other salads!!

The dressing and feta cheese makes this a remarkable dish along with the fresh taste of the cucumbers. I didn't have lettuce so I just mixed all the veggies together and added some other favorites. I also added chicken (my favorite recipe for chicken on this site is Shredded Chicken Tacos by Goya - I use it for my soups and other dishes).  Even without the lettuce this was fabulous. Not sure if I'll ever add lettuce. :)

Wow!! So Good!!! We all loved this.  The dressing ingredients say optional, but in my opinion they are a MUST.  It really brought everything together, loved the tang of the lemon on the salad.  YUM!!

Made this for myself and vegetarian friend and we both loved it. You can also just fix an ear of corn and slice the kernels off with a knife.
