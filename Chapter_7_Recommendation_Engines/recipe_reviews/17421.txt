Nice flavor. We served with rice. I didn't use butter just the grease remaining in the pan from the sausage (even after draining the sausage and placing it aside). I made my own S&S sauce using a recipe online. It was amazing! My husband loved it and told me never to buy from the store again. The recipe is so easy - Combine 1/3 c. rice vinegar, 4 Tbsp brown sugar, 1 Tbsp ketchup, and 1 tsp soy sauce in small saucepan and bring to boil. Mix 2 tsp cornstarch with 4 teaspoons water and stir into boiling sauce mixture to thicken. Makes 1/2 cup sauce and was enough to coat the veggies and sausage. Delish!

This was quite easy and pretty good for a quick change to smoked sausage. I tripled the sauce and hot pepper. I also added a green pepper and another vidalia onion. I added 1 large can of drained pineapple chunks in juice- the kids fought over those. next time I may toss in a few maraschino cherries and see what the kids do. Last week we had a potluck at work. I kept it warm in a crock pot and served rice on the side - it was gone before anything else on the table. Again the pineapple were a hot commodity.

I made this tonight & it turned out really well. What an easy recipe. I did add extra sweet/sour sauce like the other reviewers recommended which was great because I served it over white rice. Next time I'll get a better (more authentic) s&s sauce. But the peppers/onions in the sauce with the sausage was really really good. My husband is already looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Thanks for a great recipe!

I don't think I would have even tasted 2 Tablespoons of sweet and sour sauce; I added the entire 10oz jar and it came out perfect for me. I didn't add any hot spice because I used a cajun-spiced smoked sausage. Really easy to make. Just my style of cooking. I disagree with this fat content rating. Is it the sweet and sour? Other similar recipes here using smoked sausage have less than half the fat of this. As an aside I took a taste of this before adding the s&s - delicious on it's own!

This recipe is delicious. You HAVE to use a whole bottle of Sweet and SOur- and serve over rice. I added some crushed red peppers, and 2 cloves of minced garlic. PERFECT blend! Kids, husband, and myself loved, loved, loved it!

This really is a great dish that's easy and fast. I followed the recipe as written but added more of the sweet and sour sauce so I would have extra juice for the rice added a can of drained sliced carrots and a half can of drained pineapple chunks. The flavors really blend well together. Everyone needs to try this dish you'll be hooked when you do!!

Great Recipe! Thanks! I did add extra sauce per the other reviews and instead of cutting peppers and onions I picked up a bag of pepper stirfry. It worked perfectly and no fussing with cutting:) This will be a new staple at my house!

This was very good. I used turkey smoked sausage and extra sweet and sour sauce. When I finished cooking it I thought it looked kind of bland but I was pleasantly surprised when I tasted it!

My husband and company loved this. I did make some changes. I doubled the sweet & sour and cayenne pepper & hot sauce. We put over rice; next time will use more peppers and onions. Nice change from the usual smoke sauage. Thank you will make again.

My kids loved this and for that it gets 5 stars! I made everything is separate pots and pans so people could take what they like. I am vegetarian so I made a veggie sausage for myself. I also added little mini corns for the kids because they love them and think they are fun. My husband added the cayenne pepper and chili sauce.. easy and delish.. will def make again!

This turned out really yummy! I did do a few things different though. 1. I left out the butter. 2. I added more sweet and sour sauce then the recipe called for. I used a 10 oz jar of La Choy. 3. I added a can of drained pineapple. 4. I put it all in the crock pot on low for 8 hours. The sauce was a bit on the thin side so I ladled some of it into a measuring cup and then whisked in 5 tablespoons of flour. I then added the thickened sauce back to the crock pot. I served this with instant brown rice and it was a huge hit!

We make a version of this recipe at home but instead of sauteing it in a skillet we wrap all of the ingredients in aluminum foil and make a secure pouch then grill the pouch on the grill until done. This adds a delicious smoky grilled flavor to the sausage and peppers plus the juices from the sausage sweet and sour sauce spices and veggies makes a delicious sauce and the sausage and veggies are so tender and moist. It's delicious!! We also use an entire jar of La Choy sweet and sour sauce...to us this makes a BIG difference in the flavor. We also add 1 sliced fresh jalapeno pepper but beware this makes it very very spicy!!! Not for those with young children but if you like it super hot it is wonderful! One of our favorites! I gave this 4 stars only because we like the grilled version better and it needs more sweet and sour sauce. Great recipe!

This was very very good. I used the "Servings" feature to scale it down to 3 servings (I already had a 14 oz. smoked sausage that I didn't know what to do with long story...) and it worked like a charm. I did use a bit more sweet and sour sauce than it called for (maybe 25% more not much) and it was very good. I only put a bit of pepper and hot sauce then let people add hot sauce to suit their own tastes on the plate. It was great. A keeper recipe for sure.:-)

The wife and I agreeded it was a great switch from always grilling smoked sausage. I added the pineapples as several have. I also used the S&S sauce found online. made enough for recipe and beats buying more sauces just to store extra in fridge. Served it over rice.

Did what another suggested for homemade sweet and sour sauce: Combine 1/3 c. rice vinegar 4 Tbsp brown sugar 1 Tbsp ketchup and 1 tsp soy sauce in small saucepan and bring to boil. Mix 2 tsp cornstarch with 4 teaspoons water and stir into boiling sauce mixture to thicken. Makes 1/2 cup sauce we added pinapple chunks twards the end of the veggies simmering alone. Its so good and i like the smoky flavor the sausage gives it. served it on a bed of steamed rice

My husband (who at first screwd up his face when I said what I was making) immediatly said 5 stars and to keep all these ingredients in the house so it can be made as a regular meal (which make 3 regualrs on my list so that says something). I omitted the cayenne pepper and hot sauce since I have 3 tiny mouths at home. I didnt want to buy sweet and sour sauce when I knew I could make it so I used sweet and sour sauce I off of this site and it was PERFECT with this. I did add more than 2 tbs to the dish probably around a 1/4 cup maybe more and served the rest on the side as we ate this over rice so it did need even more sauce than what I had added.

Really enjoyed this and My Husband loved it. I did double the sweet and sour sauce. The whole key as others had suggested is adding a can of diced pineapples with the juice. It adds a little bit of extra sweetness and provides more liquid for serving over rice. Quick Easy and Tasty. Thank You for Sharing

Everyone liked this would probably make again. It was an easy weeknight meal. I used a dash or 2 of cajun seasoning instead of cayenne and hot sauce. Also had a few raw shrimp I cooked in pan with sauce after removing sausage/veg. No need for salt in this dish.

Gotta love a recipe that is quick and easy yet everyone cleans their plates! I know the recipe states this takes 50 min. to make but I know it did not take me that long. I sauteed the onions and peppers first then added the sliced sausage without cooking it separately first. That seems unnecessary to me. I added a little more sweet & sour to have a sauce for rice. I did add pineapple at the end but I liked it better without like the original recipe. The kids loved the sweet pineapple though! Great recipe.

I have made this several times. Sometimes I serve it over white or brown rice. Sometimes we have it in hogie buns. My 6-yr-old loves the sausage. I do increase the sweet and sour sauce because I want a sauce not just a coating. But it is easy and good.

I have made this a couple of times! My whole family loves it! I don't add the pepper because I have kids that don't do spice! I do add about 8oz of sweet and sour sauce but I also add extra sausage I don't like green bell pepper so I use red orange and yellow! I've even used the left over on sandwiches for my husband the next day! (French rolls)

Very good and easy to prepare. My husband really enjoyed it and would like to have it again. Like many others I added pineapple and a bottle of sweet and sour sauce with a little of the pineapple juice. I served it with jasmine rice. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good! I followed the recipe exactly except for leaving out the hot sauce at the end. I served it over a bed of brown rice & quinoa mix. Next time I might be a little more generous with the sweet & sour sauce but I will definitely make it again.

Hate to have the descending opinion here but this was just an okay recipe. Followed recipe exactly except used more sauce so I could serve over white rice. It was okay but not something I'd fix often.

I enjoyed the combination of flavors. I made my own Sweet & Sour sauce and used probably about 8 ounces so that there would be plenty of sauce to serve over rice. And I added more peppers & onions than the original recipe called for.

My family loved this! Instead of purchased sweet and sour sauce I cooked my own using a recipe from this website. I added additional bell pepper and onion and it still wasn't enough. In addition I added a large can of pineapple tidbits. Served it over rice...delicious! (Don't be afraid to add other veggies-I wished I had had carrots.)

I've tried the recipe twice already - once straight "from the stabble yard cat" and another with a twist. They both came out alright although I must say that I prefer it the original fashion; the problem being those who've tasted them both and voted for my version -go figure! Anyway pretty good all in all. As for the twist I added crumbles of "alheira" - a Portuguese smoked sausage - in the end and used my own home made Chinese plump sauce.

I used more than the amount of sweet sour sauce listed at least double. This was good and easy and I'll probably make it again. I do prefer a slightly similar recipe I learned from the Portuguese American community when I lived near New Bedford MA: chourico sausage onion peppers and tomato sauce. This is usually served on rolls.

I used chicken instead of sausage and added some chunks of fresh pineapple and fresh tomato along with the other fresh ingrediants. I used about a half of the bottle of sauce to just coat the veg and meat without it being too over powering and it was perfect.

I made this the other day and it was really good. I added a can of water chestnuts and used Sriracha garlic sauce with the sweet and sour sauce. It's so easy and definitely a keeper in this house. I don't care for things with too much sauce but I'm glad I followed the advice of others and tripled the s/s sauce measurement--it was the perfect amount for me. Thanks to whoever submitted this recipe.

I was looking for something different to do with smoked sausage and found this- delicious. I added more sauce and served over rice as others suggested. My husband- who usually hates peppers and onions asked for seconds! That means it is a keeper for us.

We have a full kitchen at work and twice a week I make something in the crock pot. I double this recipe and use the full recipe for Wow sweet and sour sauce with the addition of a tbs of Thai sweet chili sauce and a can of pineapple chunks. I brown the sausage chop the vegetables and toss it in a 6 at crock on low for 4 hrs and serve wit a side of pasta and rice so people can have their choice. It gets destroyed every time I make it.
