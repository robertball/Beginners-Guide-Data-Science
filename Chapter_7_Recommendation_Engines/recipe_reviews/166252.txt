This would be a four-star rating if it weren't for the garlic in the recipe.  The flavor of the garlic masked the basic ham flavor, as well as the wonderful mango chutney and Dijon.  It's too overpowering and should either be reduced to ONE clove, or eliminated entirely.

I was looking for a glaze for a ham and when I found this one, I remembered about the partial jar of mango chutney I had in the frig that I needed to use up.  I'm so glad I did.  This glaze is absolutely delicious; just the right amount of citrus and sweet.  This is the only glaze I'll use from now on.  Thanks Christina.

VERY good Christina! One of the big clubs has spiral ham on sale so I snatched it up. I didn't want to use the packet of glaze it came with so this was the perfect alternative. YUM! Thank you!!

Made it exactly according to the recipe and it was great!  I do NOT understand how people can rate a recipe that they have changed, especially when it's the main ingredient that they change.  If you did NOT use Mango Chutney, then you did NOT make THIS recipe people.  After I made it per the recipe I did make a change or two, such as substituting POG for OJ because it's what I had, and I added maraschino cherries because of a special request, and it came out great.  But my rating is for the recipe as written.

Delicious! The only thing I changed was I used apricot preserves because I couldn't find mango chutney.

This recipe is a "keeper".. I used  Sugar free peach preserves,instead of Chutney.  I also use this sauce as a "dipping" sauce for just baked pretzels also. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I am not much for ham and pineapple so I was looking for a glaze that was a little less sweet and came across this recipe. The glaze smelled delicious when I was mixing it and was even better on the ham. This is definitely a keeper.

A delicious glaze that I've made twice.  The first time I used orange marmalade in place of the mango chutney, the second time I used apricot jam as that is what I had on hand.  The mixture of the brown sugar, orange juice, mustard, garlic and marmalade/jam was equally delicious. I have another ham in the freezer and I look forward to making this recipe again.  Served the ham with 'Mom's Scalloped Potatoes' from AR.

I followed recipe exactly. Just not my flavors for ham. I didnâ€™t like the orange flavor on the meat.
