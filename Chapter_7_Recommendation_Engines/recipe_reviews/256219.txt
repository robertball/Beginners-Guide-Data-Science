Ok let me be that guy and say I modified this hard. First I used half a head of Cauliflower and made my own "rice" using a food processor. Second i used less tomato sauce and did 8 oz of sauce w 1 tomato diced. Cooked ground meat drained did "rice" solo using EVOO and some of the remaining meat fat. Maybe 5 minutes sauteed total. Added back the meat and all the other ingredients for maybe an extra 2 min. I did stick w their seasoning recommendations and felt it was under seasoned. Also i regret not using more tomato sauce. Good! Would make again and dont regret not using their frozen stuff but thats why I didnt give it a full 5 stars (because i didnt follow the reciepe that closely!) But figured maybe this could help others

This was delicious!! I do know that ground turkey doesn't have a lot of flavor so I added more seasoning than they suggested. I added the Italian Seasoning to the turkey while I was cooking it. I also added half of a Texas Longhorn pepper. They didn't have the Green Giant mix in my grocery store so I used some Riced Cauliflower from the refrigerated section and softened a sweet potato in the microwave then diced it up and added it. Will definitely be making this again!

Added quite a bit more Italian seasoning and used marinara sauce instead of tomato.

I couldn't find the riced cauliflower and sweet potato so used my own diced sweet potato. The leftovers are perfect lunches at work.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I did make one alteration. I made mine with 1lb ground turkey and 1/2 lb. sausage. I have also cut the peppers into pieces put them in a baking dish and made more of a casserole out of it. My daughter likes it better that way.

Will make again!! Looked at 5 different grocery stores for the riced vegetables got frustrated and used wild rice. This was so good!! I will add more seasoning next time though. This would also be good using squash instead of green peppers.
