I added 3 sliced carrots and 3 stalks of celery and sautéed with the leeks. I used 2% milk instead of fat free half and half. It’s delicious! Hubby approved too. I’ll definitely make this recipe again!

Yum! I stirred in 1/2 lb shredded Monterey Jack/ Colby into the mix after finishing the recipe. I like a little sauerkraut and Dark Rye bread on the side.

Great recipe. Wonderful suggestion about cooking extra (uncreamed)potatoes in strainer. Family loved it.
