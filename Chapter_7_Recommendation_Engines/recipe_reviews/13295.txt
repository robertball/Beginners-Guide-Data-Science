Now that my kids are off to college and it's just hubby & me, we usually have leftovers when I cook.  I've started freezing the leftover vegies in a 2-cup container just to use in this recipe!  (When it's full, it's time to make this soup!)  I've made this with lots of different ingredients (including leftover chicken, rice, pasta, etc.) and spices (i.e. - substitute Southwestern seasoning or Oregano & Basil) and it's always GREAT.  We get at least two meals for two from this, plus several lunches.  Also, the soup itself can be frozen!

I found the recipe to be good and easy to make and it was enjoyed by all. Though it made a lot more than four servings more like 12.

This surprized me--this was pretty good! I made a small change and cooked my bacon after I browned my meat, saved a little of the bacon grease and sauteed my celery, onion and a mess of minced garlic in the bacon grease before adding in the rest of the soup ingredients. I had no leftover vegetables on hand but I did have some cauliflower and broccoli that I needed to use so I added that to the soup. I also added a can of organic corn that I drained and rinsed and added to the soup, too. After tasting it, I threw in some more spice, only because I felt like it needed a little more. Very cheap to make and really super filling! Don't let the name fool you. NOTE: For those who like a heartier soup and don't like to waste leftovers from the rest of the week, save your leftover veggies in a ziplock bag in the freezer and just throw them in this soup. This also works with a cup or so of leftover mashed potatoes, too, which acts as a natural thickener.

Very easy to throw together.  I used the recipe as an outline and just threw a can of diced tomatoes, a lb of meat, some corn, red beans, carrots, and green beans, as well as onion, celery and green pepper into the pot, covered with water, and simmered for over 1hr.  Turned out very good.  Don't need the broth if you don't have it.

This is an excellent base for a recipe. I added cabbage, 1 can of black beans and 3 cups of V8 juice. I cooked it in the crock pot for 8 hours. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a wonderful and simple recipe.  I changed mine up thou....i added a can of tomato juice and some extra spices because i felt it didn't have enough taste or zing.  The Family loved it and rated it as a "repeatable" recipe....

Browned beef with garlic and onion.  Added 3 diced potatoes (6 was too much), can rotel tomatoes with green chilies, celery, broth, vegetables, rosemary, thyme, basil, bacon and water.  Added more broth, some oregano and extra pepper.  Tomorrow, the bacon will be soggy.  Next time, I'll leave it out.  We will keep our leftover veggies in the freezer for this recipe.

Made this as a comfort food for my ailing grandfather.  Wouldn't you know, he perked right up :) I left out the bacon (just personal choice) and added some dry mustard.  This is an old family recipe as well, but I haven't made it in soooo long.  It was nice to make again :)  Thanks for sharing it on here!  It helped me out for sure  xoxoxoxo

My husband is not a big soup person but I have made this soup twice in the past month and he loves it.  I used to make beef stew in the crockpot but this is so much better, quicker and easier.  This is our new family favorite.

Quick, easy and very very adaptable. Love it! I too browned the beef with the onion and then tossed everything else in the crockpot on high for 4 hours. I used a couple tablespoons of tomato paste instead of diced tomato because I don't like them. Left out the potato and kinda doubled up on everything else but the ground beef. Also didn't use the bacon. I use "Better than Boullion" instead of salt to increase flavor while adding sodium (I use no sodium beef broth because I would rather add my own). I just kept adding veggies ... what ever I had (carrots, corn, lima beans, peas, cabbage, cauliflower) till it looked good. Made a nice beef vegetable soup that I plan on serving over some leftover rice and portioning the leftovers for work lunches. Thx WHTETAIL, I'll make this again.

Okay. I feel like it’s kind of bland but I will add some spices for extra flavor.

I have made this twice: once as written and once cooking the beef first. The difference in taste was minimal but without cooking the meat first, the texture of the beef was a bit soggy. The second time I sautéed beef, onions, celery, and carrot first then dumped the rest in the pot. The beef had a firmer texture, which we preferred. Regardless, it never needed an hour. I cooked it for 20 minutes both times. The recipe really is versatile because you add whatever vegetables you have hanging around. Thank you for sharing it.

Used frozen left over, uncooked mixed veg, will use fresh next time as I think this may have detracted from the taste.

This is a great, versatile and filling soup.  I like the combination of spices and added a little extra of each.  Just make sure to taste it to ensure that you add enough salt.  Great easy recipe, thanks!
