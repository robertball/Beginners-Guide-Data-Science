I used regular breadcrumbs instead of the cornflakes but made no other changes to the recipe.  I added the seasonings called for to the breadcrumbs.  They were a hit with my whole family.  Flavorful, tasty and very easy.  Will definitely make again.

this came out great except we modified the recipe, just used the italian seasoned bread crumbs, instead of cornflakes added parmesean cheese..and used regular hidden valley ranch..they came out moist and yummy..the picky eaters in our family loved them!

Very bland.  I mixed up some honey/mustard sauce to dip them in to give them some more flavor.  I had to substitute gluten free breading for the cornflakes, so that could explain the "blah" flavor.

These were actually pretty good. The actual chicken was a little bland, but the ranch taste was delicious.

These were awesome. The only thing I changed was to add Parmesian cheese to my topping, and I would also suggest doubling the topping before you start. I ran out of crumbs way before I ran out of chicken.

This recipe has potential, for sure. I ran out of the ranch mixture and coating before I finished all the chicken. This wound up being a good thing because...my kids HATED these (they're not normally picky). I thought they tasted much too "seasoned" and I agree with the other reviews that the coating falls off very easily.  All this aside, the chicken was very moist, the cornflake coating is awesome (if you've never tried the cornflake thing...do it!) and they cooked beautifully exactly per instructions. They all got eaten :-)  I might try it again with a buttermilk coating in lieu of the ranch.

These were VERY good!  They were moist and tender, and just the right amount of crunch on the outside!  I'll be making these again!

These chicken strips were great. My two teens ate them all up. The only change I made was to use italian seasoned panko crumbs instead of the corn flakes. other wise it was great. I used a sweet and sour sauce for dipping.

Not bad.  I used Italian bread crumbs instead since I didn't have any cornflakes, but they tasted good.  I will make these again.

Delicious! I didn't have ranch, so I used parmesan peppercorn and it was outstanding. Dipped in a little more of the dressing or some sweet chili sauce and you've got a meal that everyone will love.

I like chicken breaded in corn flakes, this is only the second time I have made it. I picked this recipe to try the corn flake breading again and because it was dipped in ranch first. My kids liked this but when I was cutting them up the corn flakes crumbled off. Still tasty and juicy and tender. I used chicken tenderloins!!

Ok I fixed this dish and used Italian Bread crumbs instead of corn flakes and added some greek seasoning.  Wow my very choosy kids loved it and in fact went back for seconds. Very good.

These were a huge hit in my home with my 9 and 2 year old girls who are picky eaters! They cleared their plates before i noticed! The only reason that i didn't give the extra star is because the breading flaked off very easily and had to be scooped up with a fork. Followed recipe except used regular ranch and added a bit of salt and pepper to the mix.  Tasted great! Myself and husband loved em' too! Will definitely make again. Never used corn flake crumbs before but have heard of it, daughter cringed before tasting, but was happily shocked at the taste. Thanks for the great easy recipe!

Loved these, I am thinking that next time I will use creamy Italian though just to enforce the italian taste.
