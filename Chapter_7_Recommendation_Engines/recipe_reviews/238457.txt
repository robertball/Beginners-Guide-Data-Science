Yum!  Made these for breakfast today and I used lactose free whole milk.  I also added in some diced tomatoes, peppers, onion, parsley and a little cheddar cheese, then rolled it all up in a whole grain tortilla.  Delicious!

Easy, tasty breakfast. I'm not sure if the butter amount is a typo but I only needed about a teaspoon. I also used 1/2 t of sriracha. Added some garlic powder and garlic chives. Next time I think I'll add some spinach at the end.

Made this for my little guy for breakfast this morning (he LOVES all things spicy), and he LOVED them! We didn't measure the sriracha, I just let him squirt some in (it was maybe 1-2 tsps.). He said these tasted really good and were just a bit spicy. He also said that he would like to have these for breakfast again and it was 5 stars from him, lol. Thanks for sharing. :)

Just the right amount of heat! Great in a breakfast sandwich. I skipped on the half and half altogether too, so this is a good one for a lactose - free dish/side.

Its taken me twenty years, but I've finally found the secret to perfect scrambled eggs! I do three eggs to about 1/2 tbsp or more of sriracha. I usually only use milk, but have used evaporated milk with good results. After I pour the eggs into the pan I sprinkle seasoned salt over (which I think is the second quintessential ingredient) and a bit of cheese. This is now the only way I will eat scrambled eggs! Thanks LaShondaRN!

i liked it but my husband and kids wouldn't eat it. For myself, if i make this again i would add double the hot sauce and half the cream and butter. i liked it but it was just overly buttery and no spiciness to it.

I love it being a hot sauce nut. The change I made is I didn't have half & half so I used Greek yogurt and it turned out great. I also had with it a spicy  chicken sausage roll. I will be making his often
Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious. Cooking the Sriracha with the eggs gives them a smoky, smooth flavor unachievable by simply topping it with sauce afterwards. I can't believe I didn't think of this before. Thank you for the recipe.

Just the right amount of heat.  First time I made it was for 8.  The recipe called for two sticks of butter!  These things we're swimming in butter and everyone LOVED them.  I now cut the butter by 75% and they are still great.

Used Greek yogurt instead of half and half because thatâ€™s what I had. It was very good! Spongy but good!

It was good although I'd add a bit more sriracha next time.

Just an ever so slight sriracha taste. If you like more spice, add more sriracha either in the eggs or on top. I thought the amount of butter was overkill for me, so I just added according to my liking.

Really good!   Added some cooked onion and garlic.  Threw some fresh herbs in at the end.   I love spice so I doubled the sriracha.
