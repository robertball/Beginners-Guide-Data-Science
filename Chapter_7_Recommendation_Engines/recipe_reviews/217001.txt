This is a good base for a quinoa salad. The flavors of the dressing are nice. Great with added veggies like tomato, cucumber, grated carrot. I just used a can of chickpeas since I didn't have time to cook them and this whipped up in just 15 minutes (prepared everything else while cooking the quinoa and ate it warm).

I loved this salad!  Added some chopped red pepper for colour.  Also used a 19 oz can of chickpeas instead of going to the trouble of cooking dried chickpeas.

This is very good but you have to like Tahini to enjoy this as it is a major part of the dressing. The fresh lemon really brightens this. I used a minced red onion in lieu of the shallot as I didn't have one. I would probably add some celery, carrots and cherry tomatoes to this next time foer a bit more crunch and color. Thanks, Cara!

This is a rich, filling, and very easy dish. I added mint because it goes well with these flavors and I had some I needed to use up. The only change I'd make in the future is to use more quinoa, because it was a bit bean-heavy for my taste.

Excellent!!  I LOVE lemon, tahini, quinoa, parsley and chickpeas, so this was fantastic to me!  My husband and I both really enjoyed this, though I did add a bit of water to the dressing to thin it out a bit more.  I also used canned chickpeas as I had them open already, maybe about a cup's worth!  Yummy :)

By coincidence I ended up making this recipe last night, as I trying to figure out what to do with some leftover quinoa and what I had around the house.  I also ended up using canned chickpeas (ready to go!) and added some halved cherry tomatoes, some flax seeds and some grilled chicken for extra protein.  A definite keeper! :-)

This tastes amazing! So much flavor! I added a little extra garlic for extra kick and some cucumber. SO GOOD! Also, I used canned garbanzo beans (the entire can and a whole cup of quinoa (didn't soak it either). The next day it was a little dry so I served it over sliced avocado and added a splash of seasoned rice vinegar. Still super tasty!

Delicious! But I also altered a few things. Way too lazy to soak beans overnight, I just used canned. And I mixed in some roasted vegetables (i had broccoli, carrots and red peppers on hand). I didn't have a shallot, so I just chopped up a green onion and added it in. I didn't have any of these, but I also think that a few sundried tomatoes (the packed-in-oil kind) would be terrific in this. I pronounce this recipe as "Nummy-num-nums".

We made the recipe as-is, and it was very good. The flavor is tangy, and I think that eating too much at once would be overwhelming. But as a small side, this is a good choice.

I liked this very much, and salads are not my thing! I ate it with some toasted french bread, which was a nice addition. I did add a little grated carrot and tomato, as one person suggested.

Delicious! I used a little less than 1/4 cup of lemon and it was still very lemony. Great side dish!

The basic concept is good, but the recipe as written is not my fave. I really enjoy mixing garbanzo and quinoa, but I'll usually add fresh veggies such as beets, carrots, or green beans. Also I prepare the dressing with tahini, sesame oil, olive oil, soy sauce, garlic, and sometimes curry spices (because I like that sort of thing). I then add avocado on top. So basically nothing like this recipe, but it catalyzed my ideas for other recipes.

Loved the salad. I did add cucumbers, red peppers & celery and did not add as much lemon juice as the recipe called for. Also did not have shallots on hand so just used part of a regular yellow onion. The dressing is so tasty! Will definately be making this again!

I found this recipe to be a good base, then I changed things up a bit .  For the dressing I  used 1 TBS avocado oil plus 1TBS cocunut oil, apple cider vinegar, a slight pinch of salt and 1/4 tsp sugar and the shallot and garlic 1 TBS of sesame tahini.

I poured the dressing over the following ingredients: 1 avocado cubed, 1 cup cooked quinoa, 1 cup (instead of 1/2) chickpeas, 2-3 TBS roasted pumpkin seeds, 2TBS dried cranberries. 

Next time I will add 2 sliced radishes for color. I think apple or celery would be good in this recipe too.

Looking to boost my protein intake at lunch.  This looks good for that.  I get all this stuff regularly the only thing I didn't have was parsley which I got across the street at whole foods.  I soaked the beans as I always do.  It's good but I had a pb&j as well.

My local deli makes this and it is amazing. Tried this recipe and it was right on par! I substitute fresh garbanzo for canned and shallot for onion. Still tastes the same, those ingredients just seem more readily available. So yummy. I make a big batch and eat it for lunch for a few days! Very filling.

I used canned beans and just cooked the quinoa. By doing this, it is really quick to fix. It's best after sitting and absorbing the flavors for a couple of days. I make it on the weekend and take it to work as lunch. It keeps me full until I head home.

Though all the ingredients are delicious on their own....the final result was disappointing.  Not a lot of great flavours come through.  Even the tahini seems underwhelming.  Not a repeat for us.

Tasty and filling; perfect for a healthy lunch. I would cut back on the tahini just a touch (I love the stuff but I felt the flavor was too prominent and I would like some more lemon to come through next time) and I will add some tomatoes and cucumber from my garden for a burst of color. Definitely will make again, thanks for sharing!

Very good!  I love tahini/lemon flavor.  I did cook the quinoa in chicken stock, which added some sodium and meant no need to add salt. Orginally made it just for my wife and I, but the two kiddos loved it as well.  I thought I was going to have leftovers, but while"doing the dishes" I cleaned out the pot pretty well.

I love all the ingredients in this, so tried making it.  I used canned garbonzo beans.  I soaked the quinoa overnight, and was confused by the direction to "cook it in its own water" because there was none.  So, I added water and cooked it, which I think was a mistake, as it came out mushy, like starchy rice.  I feel like I should have either used it after the soaking, or skipped the soaking and gone right to the cooking.  I'll definitely try it again, because it still tastes good, but with modification in method.
