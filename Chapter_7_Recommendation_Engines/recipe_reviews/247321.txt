I had fun making these, and they tasted great too. I sprinkled with salt on top just before baking.

These were surprisingly awesome. The only thing I changed was I used gluten free all purpose flower. I rolled them out a little too thick, but definitely will make again! this recipe makes A LOT too. I would sprinkle a little salt on them before baking and I think you got yourself a real goldfish cracker!

Thank you for this recipe. I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour. I only had white cheddar so I added a sprinkle of turmeric to give a yellow colour. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of onion powder. These turned out crispy and delicious with a lots of cheese flavour. I made them with my four year old and she loved using the cookie cutter to cut them out. Our whole family loves the result, I predict that we will be making these regularly.

I made them as a healthier alternative to goldfish crackers from the supermarket.  They were easy to make and had a nice cheesy taste.  The dough was a bit on the dry side, so I added another tablespoon of water. Cut into dinosaur shapes, my grandson loved them.  I will make them again.  Not just for the grandkids, but for adults adding a bit of cayenne pepper and a bit of spice to jazz them up.

Nice, home made cheez-its. I added a tablespoon of fresh chopped rosemary. The house smells great. A bit on the oily side.

I love this recipe! I had to add an extra tablespoon and a half of water, but that has more to do with the air than the recipe. 

I used a pizza cutter to make square goldfish. It saves a lot of time and they are a great size for my toddler!
