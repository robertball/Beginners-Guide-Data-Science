This is an excellent recipe! I used it on pork, turkey,chicken and it was great! My wife did not like the tang so I made a batch and left out the pepper. Tastes better than any jar bbq sauce I have purchased. I enter bbq contests and this will definately be the sauce I use!

This is definitely the best Allrecipes BBQ sauce I've tried - and there are some excellent ones on this site!  As a previous reviewer suggested, I double the apple juice and omit the water.  I also use fresh garlic.  Pour this  sauce over chicken legs and cook on "low" in the slow cooker for 8 hours for the best BBQ chicken ever!

Used this in place of bottled sauce in Freak'n Good Ribs.  Everyone just devoured them.  Not too hot, not too sweet.

I don't know about this one. Tried it, followed the directions exactly as they are. I found the taste odd and the sauce was very acidic. When I first read the recipe, I was wondering about the acidity level when you see things like 2 cups of ketchup (which has a lot of vinegar in it), 1/2 cup vinegar, and then 1/4 cup apple juice - all these are acidic! Might be better if the ketchup was changed for tomato paste and crushed tomatoes.

We recently celebrated our 24th wedding anniversary with a BBQ dinner and this is the sauce we used for our pork ribs. It was delicious!!!..We like spice so it was just right, though my husband wanted more spice to it. I dont think I will buy bottled sauce ever again this was too easy. Tip: Sauce is better the 2nd day.

Very good sauce.  I didn't have cayenne on hand because my family doesn't care for very spicy things, but it tasted just fine without it.

Delicious! Just a few substitutions:  fruit punch for the apple cider, 1 cup of creamy tomato soup for 1 cup of the ketchup, and soy sauce for worcestshire. I also added just a few drops of liquid smoke. Perfection!

Great to keep in the fridge for summer grilling.  This is especially good on ribs that are wrapped in foil and baked slowly with chili pepper(2-2 1/2 hrs at 300).

REALLY GOOD SAUCE!   I did use cider instead of juice because it's all I had!I didn't change anything else and this sauce was great, everyone wanted the "secret" recipe sauce.

I've never had much luck with BBQ sauce, and I've tried maybe 20 different recipes.  This was easy to make and the flavor and consistency was excellent.  I added some hot sauce to it.  That was my only modification.

Wow!  This BBQ sauce is fantastic!  I have only used it on chicken so far.  I had some leftover, so I stored it in a jar in the fridge until my next BBQ need.  We think it tasted even better the second time around.  I will definitely make this again and again; I may never buy from the store again!

I needed a quick BBQ sauce (out of ingredients to make my normal) and found this. I only had one problem. I halved the recipe from its original 24 to 12, and added ketchup and seasonings accordingly but goofed and left my liquid amounts as the original stated!  No matter, still came out great. I was also out of a few things and had to sub onion powder for the onion, left out the butter naturally, and used about 1/8 a cup of steak sauce in place of the Worcestershire sauce. Excellent stuff and I can't wait to try it as written. The only thing I might add next time is a bit of liquid smoke.

I mixed the ingredients together mostly according to the recipe. I didn't have a small onion so I used a teaspoon of onion powder. I didn't have dry mustard either so I used a squirt of regular mustard. And i used white vinegar instead of cider vinegar. After adding the cayenne pepper, it was REALLY spicy so (at the request of my 7 year old) I added some more honey and threw in a couple of tablespoons of teriakyi sauce. 
I put it all in my crockpot and cooked it for a few hours with some low-end pork chops. They were so tender and tasted AMAZING! the whole family was thrilled. Then I left the rest of the porkchops in the crock pot over night on low heat and by this morning we had a fantastic tasting VERY SPICY brisket!! DELICIOUS!! I will definitely use this recipe again and again! I'm so glad I dared to use an online recipe for BBQ sauce. This is better than store bought and right up there with restaurants like Smokey bones.  AMAZING!

Excellent, tasty and thick. It was the perfect amount to fill 1 large mason jar so I went ahead and canned it. I used it to mop on baby back ribs that I had also used CCRyder's dry rub found on this website.

This is an awesome BBQ sauce.  Instead of 2 cups of ketchup, I used 1 cup ketchup and 1 cup of homemade chili sauce.  I had no apple juice so substituted orange juice in it's place.  After it was finished I used the immersion blender to get it all smooth and it was a great hit at our chicken barbeque.

I only gave this four stars because it is the first BBQ sauce I made.  I can't say it's "the best" without a basis for comparison.  However, I really, really liked it and will be making it again!

I made this recipe today, but I did modify it just a tad. It was very good, but it tasted more like Sloppy Joe sauce than BBQ. Hubby and I still loved it on shredded chicken breasts, though. I'll make it again when I'm in the mood for Sloppy Joes.

Used this as my "bottled suace" for "Grant's midnight grill sauce".  Didn't add sugars...  Saute'd onion in canola spray, rather than butter...  
Amazing.  Thanks!

A nice recipe that stuck to the meat nicely. Had enough to mix with pulled pork too from this one recipe. Good go to recipe. Why buy? I used homemade ketchup. So had a nice fresh distinct flavor.

I followed this recipe exactly and found it to be too acidic.  Way too much vinegar.  If I ever make it again, I would cut the vinegar in half.  Maybe with less vinegar and a longer simmer time, it would be better.

I made this recipe for my wings on Super Bowl Sunday.  I doubled the recipe, added less pepper in the second batch to "calm" it down a bit, but yet still left it with some kick.  I left it sit in the fridge overnight to really absorb all the seasonings and put it over wings in the crock pot the next day.  They came out perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was excellent.  I used it on boneless/skinless chicken breasts and cooked on the grill.  I had to make some adjustments to the recipe because I did not have some of the ingredients.  I doubled the apple juice because I did not have cider vinegar and I doubled the honey because I did not have molasses.  I also did not have chili powder so I added a couple dashes of hot sauce.  The sauce is definitely sweet, but has a nice spicy kick to it!  Excellent.

Made it for some meatballs exactly to recipe. The zing was a little overpowering, would suggest replacing 1/2 the ketchup with tomato sauce, or getting rid of vinegar in favor of more juice.
This sauce would be an amazing glaze on chicken or ribs, or a dab on a burger like a condiment. Definitely more of a BBQ sauce to complement a food, not as a primary ingredient, too overpowering.

I made this to go with Chef John's pulled pork and it was a hit!  I changed the water to apple juice, as others suggested.  I did add another T of brown sugar, because we like it a bit on the sweet side.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for posting. Update 4/20/17 I don't add any of the cayenne pepper because its way too hot for my little one.  Really don't miss it because of the chili powder.

This is our new barbeque sauce.  I've been trying to find the perfect bbq sauce for over a year, and this is it.  I made a couple of small changes, added an extra 2 T of Worchestshire sauce, added 1 tsp of liquid smoke flavoring, and increased cayenne powder to 1 1/4 tsp.  Also added three minced garlic cloves to the onions at the beginning, in addition to using the garlic powder.  This was sweet, tangy, spicy, complex.  I'm getting ready to make a big batch and freeze it to have on hand.  Thank you for this recipe.  We'll enjoy it for years to cme.

Definitely the best BBQ sauce I have ever made. I didn't change a thing, but I omitted the cayenne pepper. I will make this again soon.
Awsome with ribs and chicken.

Very easy and quick to make. Only adjustments I made were the omission of the cayenne pepper and the addition of more brown sugar (a LOT more as my family likes things sweet). Everyone loved it!

This is the only BBQ sauce we use now. I don't change a thing in the recipe. I make it in triple batches and we use it on everything that requires BBQ sauce.

This is an excellent recipe to modify to suit your own personal tastes.  The biggest change I do is I boil the onion in red wine and puree the onions.  I also add much more sweet (mostly molasses) to it and a few drops of liquid smoke.

I followed the recipe but decided it was too sweet. I added more fresh garlic, steak seasoning, and half of a beer!  I also omitted the water and just used apple cider vinegar. Also added a little seasoned salt. It was fabulous!!  I put in the crock pot along with a pork shoulder to make BBQ pulled pork sandwiches and it made enough for 6 people to eat and some leftovers!  Definitely will make this one again!!

I love anything vinegar based and thought this recipe sounded good. 

I used a cup of ketchup and a can of diced tomatoes and pretty much followed the rest of the recipe. After simmering down i tasted it and all I tasted was ketchup. 

3.5 pints of ketchup.  Definitely not the BBQ sauce I was trying for.

I love, love, love this recipe!  I have stopped buying barbecue sauce and make this exclusively.  The only change I made was to replace the molasses with agave and I halved the cayenne.  My family loves to use this as a dip for potato chips, as well as anything else they can put it on.

This was very good. My husband said it was the best barbecue sauce he has tasted - just enough tang, just enough sweetness. The only changes I made were apple cider instead of apple juice and just added 1 tsp. of onion powder instead of sauteing the onions in butter. This made it easier, and I didn't want onion lumps in the sauce. This is now my go-to barbecue sauce.

This is my husband's new favorite barbeque sauce!  We make 1 1/2 to double batches and seal it up in canning jars so we always have it on hand.  GREAT over shredded beef for sandwiches.

If you are looking for a vinegar sauce this might work for you. Reminds me of sloppy Joe sauce. Too acidity for us, I added additional sugar to balance out. I wanted to try something different, may make again.

We will have this sauce with our christmas roast tomorrow on x-mas eve. I prepared the sauce today and used 4 garlic gloves instead of the garlic powder. We all had a spoonful - just to make sure it is good and we won't be disappointed tomorrow night -, but it the sauce is really great, absolutely deliciious and on its'way to become a family favorite!

This recipe is very good, but with BBQ sauce there is always room for improvement.
