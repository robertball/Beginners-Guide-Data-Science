Very weak and un-chocolate-y, even after adding more cocoa, then more Splenda and creamer.  Didn't want to throw out whole batch, so ended up stirring a good-sized splash of Torani s/f chocolate coffee syrup into each cup to make it drinkable.  Save yourself some time, effort, and money--purchase instant s/f cocoa packets at the store instead.

I thought this was very good.  My coffee cups are a bit larger and hold more than a cup of liquid, so I put in 1/3 cup of the cocoa mix instead of the 1/4 cup in the recipe.  I plan on putting this in jars and giving them as an extra gift at Christmas for my friends that are trying to cut back on sugar.
