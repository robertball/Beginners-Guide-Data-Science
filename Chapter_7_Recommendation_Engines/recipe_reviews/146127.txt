If you have fresh fruit at home, this is a great way to use it up.  I bet it would work with things like peaches, oranges, or even mangoes- maybe all three together.  One thing though- it does not cook all the way through in the middle given the heat level and the bake time- I would suggest putting it in at 300-325 degrees for 50 or 55 minutes.  This would give the whole pan a chance to heat up evenly.

I was disappointed in this recipe. It didn't cook in the middle although the sides were done. I did finish cooking it in the microwave and it was fine after that. I like it best heated with ice cream.

This was more like cornbread with a soggy bottom.  The middle took FOREVER to cook, the edges were way overdone, almost burned, before the middle was cooked.  There wasn't enough sugar in the berries, and there was way too much cornbread.  Instead of a cakey topping, like normal cobbler, it was a loaf of cornbread with soggy strawberries on the bottom.

This was okay, not great. It did remind me of cornbread and it took much longer to bake than indicated. The resulting cake was somewhat bland, despite the fruit. It needed a shot of whipped cream or ice cream. I had several desserts baked at once and this one did not get eaten. I probably won't make this again - sorry.

I really enjoyed this recipe. The taste and texture were both delicious. I used a cup of each fresh strawberries and frozen (defrosted) blackberries. I do not have an 8x8 pan, so I separated my cakes into 2 9" pie pans and after 45 minutes, they were cooked perfectly. I served it with homemade strawberry frozen yogurt. I'd make it again.
