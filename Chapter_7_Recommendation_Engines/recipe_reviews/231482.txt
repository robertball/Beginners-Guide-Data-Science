Great tasting salad!  Instead of serving on bread, I served this on a green pepper.

I made this dish for a party of 30 so I doubled the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. It was fresh, beautiful color, make sure to add crunchy kind of apples for the texture. The leftovers were even better the next day, so I would chose this salad next time I have a party and make it a day ahead. Great recipe! Thank you for sharing!

Made it for lunch and it was delicious. I did not change anything to it.

I didn't use the walnuts, and I used twice as many beets because we had a lot of them! Came out really good, great for an appetizer just served the way it is!
