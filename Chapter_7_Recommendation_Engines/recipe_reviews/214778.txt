Tzatziki=Love; Cumin=Love; Tzatziki+Cumin=Not So Much.  I was pre-composing a review as I prepared this dish about how wonderful it is to discover a unique combination of ingredients that would never have occurred to you, but somehow work well together.  I won't get to use that review here.  I'll try the tzatziki as a marinade again, because that seems a solid recommendation that I'd never tried, but perhaps with different ancillary spices as a tablespoon of cumin seemed to overwhelm the more delicate flavors of the tzatziki.  It wasn't bad, by any means, it just didn't meet my hopeful expectations.

When baked, the tzatziki no longer tastes like tzatziki. It was OK - very moist, but we won't make this again.

I loved this.. had it cold with some homemade pita. I didn't measure the cumin.. just sprinkled it til it looked right. Used a tzatziki sauce recipe from here as well

The Tzatziki sauce did not taste like Tzatziki when cooked and was overpowering the flavor of the chicken a little too much. Probably not going to make it again.
