I made this for a cookie exchange party, and they were GREAT!  Very easy to make, and turn out not only yummy, but attractive looking as well.  My Husband LOVED them.  I found that doubling the recipe, and making the balls 1 inch around yielded much more than the recipe said, I got nine dozen out of it!  So I had enough for my exchange, and then some!

This recipe is wonderful as a peanut blossom substitute. Our daughter is severly allergic to peanuts. Now she can have her kiss cookies. Nice and soft cookie. I don't roll mine in nuts and they are still delicious.

These cookies are delicious.  BEWARE though this recipe does not make 5 dozen.  I made these for a cookie swap and only ended up with 3 dozen (I may have made the cookies too big).  Also, making the cookies into balls is not easy because the dough is soooo sticky.  Wet your fingers before rolling - this will prevent the dough from sticking to you.  All in all though - this recipe is worth making.

These cookies were really delicious. The only thing was that my dough was too thin and sticky for me to roll into balls, so we sprinkled the nuts on top. I think that I over-beat the ingredients. Next time I will not use a mixer, but will mix everything by hand and hopefully the dough will be thicker. Bye the way, we used the kisses with nuts inside. The cookie tasted so good, not too sweet, just right.

Awesome! I have had the peanut butter style ones in the past and these are way tastier! Everyone who had the  cookie raved about it! Fun to make too. If doubling the recipe, buy two bags of kisses!

Love this recipe! Nothing to change, rolling these cookies in the crushed nuts makes them look real nice on the trays I hand out to 15 people during the holidays. Thank YOU!

I added red and green decorations to the nuts and topped them with a Hershey Hug.  They were very festive and everyone loved the taste.

These are wonderful.  I fixed them for a "cookie exchange party", and they were a hit.  My whole family helped "roll" them.  My 5 year old had a little trouble, but the 10 year old thought it was a blast.  These reminded me of a danish wedding cookie with a little extra surprise.

I love this cookie. It's got a light vanilla flavor and the walnuts are perfect with it. I used stars instead of kisses since I don't care for giant chocolate on my cookies. I used a #40 scoop to measure the dough, which made perfect sized balls. But I ran out of walnuts halfway through the rolling. I substituted sugar for the coating. This made the cookies spread a bit more and made them too sweet, so I wouldn't recommend. The recipe is great as is, otherwise.

Very good!  I added 1 cup of milk chocolate mini's to the dough.  It is important to keep your balls at 1 inch, too much dough around the kiss makes a dry, bland cookie.

These were yummy!  I don't care for nuts, so instead I rolled the cookies in some granulated sugar before baking and they turned out great!

My husband and I thought these cookies were just OK. Tasted like a sugar cookie with chocolate in the middle.

This was one of my favorite recipes that my mom made while I was growing up. They are best after they have been out of the oven for a while. They are the best because she is my mom and Christmas wouldn't be the same if she did not make all of her wonderful cookies every year.
