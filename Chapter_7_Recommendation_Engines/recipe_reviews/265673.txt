These are really tasty and a nice options for those fancy meat & cheese trays for keto and low-carbers.  They are a little tedious for the amount you get, so I highly suggest you double or triple the recipe.  I left mine in a few minutes extra, removing those that were nicely browned until they were all evenly cooked.  I found the few extra minutes were necessary to make them crispy. Very versatile recipe with lots of herb and spice options.

Unfortunately I felt that the result was a little cardboardy. If I try this again I might add something more to flavour them. Maybe some rosemary. But overall I thought for the amount of effort they weren't really worth it.

These crackers were a Super Bowl hit with my gluten-free, dairy-free, and low-fodmap friends with a few changes.  I used Daiya dairy-free mozzarella shreds and eliminated the garlic powder.  Seriously being inhaled by normal diet friends, we with special restrictions, were rolling our eyes at them.  Couldn't they eat the chili with cheddar cheese and sour cream?  These tasty crackers are quick, easy and fun to make; grand kids would love helping out too.

Love these crackers! Like what everyone else says, I doubled the measurements of the ingredients to get more. Other than that, it came out pretty good. They're really tasty.

Unfortunately, 425 was too hot, My crackers burnt within 5 minutes.  On the second batch I then lowered the temperature to 415 but while they didn't burn immediately, and after I turned them over putting them back in for 2 minutes, they were no crispy. Not cracker like at all.

You will need a rolling pin to get the dough thin enough.  I will defiantly make again.

I thought these were delicious!  I got a fair amount of them making them approx 1/16" thick. I think u should check them at 1:30min as will need more or less 2min depending on thickness.  also don't grease the pan.  I can see using different spices to change it up. I'll be doubling or tripling when I make in future.   tastes a lot like cheese bits crackers.

I overcooked some that I made as thin as possible as u can see in pic. 

  anyone know if these can be kept in airtight container in cabinet or do they need to be refrigerated?

Made crackers but obviously didn't oil pan enough because they stuck & broke apart while being scraped off. The flavor was very plain.  I made them a second time adding Italian seasoning & flax seed.  In my 400 degree oven they were ready in 5 mins.  I'll keep looking.

So easy! Nonchanges, but I did it in my convection air fryer and it was  4 min no flipping. Thank you so great!
