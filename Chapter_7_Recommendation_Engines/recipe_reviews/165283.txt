It was ok.  I think it would be better if it was made in the crockpot and it should be served over broad noodles.

Very good. Very easy. I dredged the steak strips in a simple flour/salt/pepper mix before adding to the pot and I didn't have any milk so I used half a soup can of water instead to give it the same consistency.

Really good and easy to prepare.  I followed the receipe almost exactly but I just can't make something like this without adding some garlic flavor.  Next time, which will be soon, I'll use the entire onion.  I will also probably increase the receipe because the leftovers are so useful for an almost instant dinner that sticks to the ribs and is delicious.

Great! I had only one steak leftover but a family of 4 to feed, and I needed some filler. This did the trick! It was so easy to make, and very tasty. I did everything as written, only I added some minced garlic with the onions. YUM!

I'm sure this is a great recipe but it doesn't state the size of the onion needed.  I think this might be a key ingredient to the flavor and should state the size of the onion.
