This almost like my own recipe. I use sugar only in the topping. To cut down on the gamey taste(which I like BTW) make a double batch with one lb hamburger.

I added about 1/4 cup of ground pork, 1/4 cup of chili sauce, and increased some of the spices.  Also, I rolled it flat, sprinkled broccoli and layered ham and swiss cheese and rolled it up like a jelly roll.  It was absolutely delicious.

Good starting point.  I ended up cutting down on the sugar and using fresh onion and garlic.

This was great!!  I was a little concerned making meatloaf with venison... I thought it might not be moist enough.  But it was! Also, I was missing the thyme, so I just made it without, and it was still wonderful.

This is the FIRST meatloaf that turned out perfect for me.  I went by the recipe except for a few spices that I was out of.  I doubled as we packaged our deer in 2 pounds.  I love deer meat and I don't try to hide it's flavor.  This is the best meat loaf (no matter what meat) I have ever had.  I have never liked meatloaf until this recipe.

Ok for ground venison, but I think it could be used in another recipe and taste much better.

Very easy to make, with common household ingredients.  It was a little on the sweet side, but I am very pleased with my first meatloaf project

We didn't care for this.  The brown sugar makes it too sweet.  And, for the kids to say it was 'too sweet' and 'we wouldn't want this again' says it all.

Very good.  I didn't have dried cilantro, but since it's in parsley family, I decided it would be ok to substitute it with dried parsley.  It took closer to an hour for mine to be completely cooked.  I do like how the meatloaf tastes...for venison, you wouldn't really KNOW it was venison.

This is possibly one of the best tasting meatloaf ever! It's a little chewy but delicious! I left out the cinnamon and half the sugar. I added salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, horseradish, extra minced onion, and extra mustard. Delicious!

This was very good.  I hate to change a recipe and then review, but my only major change was I needed 2 pounds of meat, so I used 1 pound of ground pork with 1 pound of venison.  Then I doubled everything else, except the brown sugar and cinnamon.  Oh...didn't have cilantro, but I don't care for that anyway, I used parsley.  I could still taste the cinnamon rather strongly, but that might be because pork is more mildly flavored.  All in all, as I fixed it, a solid 4.  I suppose it could be a 5 without my changes, but I think the cinnamon and brown sugar would be very strong with just one pound of meat.

This was amazing. Not the prettiest dish, but the flavor was worth it. A great way to use venison for people who aren't nromally fans of venison!

I made this with my dad who loves hunting. I actually don't like the gamey taste of deer, but I wanted to cook something for my brother, dad and I to enjoy. this was a great recipe and it didn't taste too gamey at all. I added a little more brown sugar and it was a hit! thanks!

I didn't have spicy brown mustard, so I used Dijon, so maybe it's not fair to give a lower rating, but we found this pretty bland.

My husband said it was the best ever and I agree 100%!So easy, only substitution I made was grating an onion since I never use onion flakes.

I liked it, needs more meat though.  Added 1 lb of ground pork, used Panko bread crumbs and used fine cut onion and garlic. Used nutmeg (I was out of cinnamon) and just used a local bbq sauce to top while it cooked.  Venison is very lean so I used the pork to add some fat and moisture.  Great guide you provided!

I was pleased with how it turned out, although I think it could’ve been even better with more spices. Next time I have something to go off of though.

A good basic recipe for venison meatloaf.  I made it per the recipe, the only issue was it to sweet for my liking.  I'll make it again but tweak it some for my taste buds.

I put diced Tomatoes in it  and fresh slices of tomato  on top.  I also mixed tomato paste and chili pepper paste together with a dash of ketchup for the topping. I also did not have any crackers. So i Crumbled up some Bagel crisps instead. Worked out great!

OK, I didn't follow the recipe very closely, but that's the way I cook. Home baked bread, cubed, instead of crackers, fresh garlic instead of flakes, and a gourmet bbq sauce mixed in instead of the other spices and ketchup.  Turned out excellent as I'm sure it would have if I followed the directions as written. Thanks for the inspiration.

had some venison hindquarter that I ran through my grinder a couple times to make the ground venison.  Because I had some leftover uncooked bacon (four thick slices) I added it for grins.  Otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.  Turned out great.  Will definitely make it again and will keep adding the bacon.

I don't think this recipe is to sweet! I think the cinnamon is giving a meat that's already inclined towards sweet a flavor a lot aren't used to in a savory dish.
My modifications: 
Two one pound 1/2 venison 1/2 grass fed 85/15 ground beef
I did not double the sugar (I did double the rest)
Used a microplane to add 1/4 of a fresh yellow onion (i think I'll use more next time)
Used a garlic crusher to add two hefty fresh garlic cloves 
I didn't have cilantro I used dried parsley
And the topping was more of a bbq sauce with garlic, onion, liquid aminos (not coconut aminos!), Worcestershire, Dijon, and a touch of balsamic in addition to sugar and ketchup. 

The dish was really good! The cinnamon flavor reminded me of an Indian inspired recipe and I think it went really well with the venison. I added beef to not overwhelm picky toddler palates but next time I think I'll make it full venison for the hubby and I!

This was a hit. I doubled the recipe and that filled up a normal loaf pan. I cooked it for about an hour. I skipped the ketchup and brown sugar on top and just served it with ketchup at the end. The brown sugar was not too sweet but I think the topping would have been. Overall, good recipe!

It turned out great. I used 1/2 lb venison sausage and 1/2 lb venison burger. I would definitely make this again however I only used half the brown sugar in the meat and none in the topping, added 1 seeded Anaheim pepper for a little more flavor and next time I would forgo using the cinnamon.

I didn't make any changes.  We enjoyed it.  The brown sugar in the sauce did make it a little sweet.  I would cut back on the amount of brown sugar, but other than that it was very good.

It was a pretty straightforward recipe.  Didn't have cilantro so I substituted parsley.  I didn't have ground thyme  so I used dried rhyme instead. Tasted wonderful and was nice and moist!  I will definitely make this again!

I followed this exactly except I couldn't find the paprika. Came out great without it. I'll make it again. Soon. With paprika.
