What a fantastic bisque. I scaled it to 8 servings and it made more like 12. A couple of things that would make this soup a little faster to prepare..... Tie the parsely, bay leaf, peppercorns and lobster shells into cheesecloth and drop into soup when called for. Then you can just remove later. Secondly, you can use a submersion blender to puree the soup before adding the sherry and cream. This will give it a more traditional bisque look also. Great Soup!

I may be the odd ball here, but this was not very good at all. Seems like it had too much tomato in it. The tomato way overpowered everthing else. It was just tomato soup with other stuff in it. My husband will eat almost anything. He didn't eat this.

I used diced canned tomatoes and pureed them, added it to the soup and tasted it, it was wonderful.  I didn't have enough tomatoes to measure what the recipe called for so I said the heck with it, I'll add some tomato sauce.  I learned a lesson.  DON'T ADD TOMATO SAUCE!  It makes it taste like tomato soup.  But it was excellent with just the pureed diced tomatoes.

This was delicious! I used wild slipper Lobster meat with no shell and instead of fish stock I used "Better than Boullion" Lobster base that I found at my local fish market.  There is no fussing with the shells and the lobster was quite a bit less expensive too! Bon apetite.  This makes closer to 6 servings.

There is a lovely little restaraunt in Austin that makes a similar bisque.  After tasting their bisque, I went on a quest to find the recipe.  Well, the quest has ended.  This is a top rated bisque.

Delectable, is what I would call this smooth and tasty recipe.  I'm a good cook and I've never had the chance to make such a delicous lobster bisque such as this.  My husband enjoyed it so much that he couldn't stop raving about it. Although, it takes a while to make but it's worth the wait.

Brava!!!!
I had to tweek a bit due to what I had on hand but this ended up first rate.  I  used Better than Boullion Lobster Base, check Whole Foods, Central Market, or the like.  (Don't even think about using the recipe on the jar) Use glass jar tomatoes or fresh to avoid the  horrible "tin" taste, the skin and seeds strain out with everything else. I ended up with a bit more sherry and used half and half instead of heavy cream and fresh grated nutmeg then added a wee dash of cayenne, easy does it, the hot did intensify but added so much to the end result.  I forgot to buy fresh tarragon so I added a pinch of dried every so often  during the cooking process  not wanting to over do it.I cannot wait to make this again.

This recipe was easy and delicious, although I don't think it was thick enough.  I left out the green onions and used a bit more lobster.  Also, I added some chicken stock for flavor.  Next time I will reduce the stock longer (I let it go for 1h15m and it still was a bit to thin).

It is a wonderful Bisque that tastes great.  The preparation is lengthy and the cooking time is likewise.  The final product is wonderful, provided you have the time to prepare it.

This is sensational. My husband had seconds and licked the bowl. The only thing I did different was I added 3 tbsp of tomato paste instead of the tomato puree, this helped to thicken it, and 1 more tbsp of sherry and a little more cream. I put bigger lobster pieces in it, too.

I don't know if I didn't blend it long enough or what, but it was like grits almost. I'm sure it was because of the flour mixture. the test was good but the consistency was off. Any suggestions on how to correct this are welcome.

I was very intimidated by this recipe, so much so that I almost didn't make it. I'm SO glad I did! It was delicious. I couldn't find fish stock at my market so I went to an Asain market and found fish boullion instead. I only strained the stock once with a spaghetti strainer, and not for a second time with muslin. I used one cup of tomato puree because the biggest complaint in the reviews was a strong tomato flavor. I also reserved about 4 ounces of the lobster meat and cut it into chunks. I stirred it in at the very end. This was my first time using fresh tarragon... don't even think of trying this soup with out it! It adds a great licorice flavor. This was decadent and delicious.

I made this following the recipe to the letter. Biggest mistake was using fish stock. The bisque had great texture and I am sure if I had used chicken stock or just water instead it would have been great. It was so fishy we could not eat it. I love fish and seafood, but this was just too much. Just a shame to, but I know of no way to save it. Ray

Average at best and IMO not woth the effort.  Not even close to a top notch Bisque.    As the recipie reads - I should have been blown away - it was really lacking something - and still cant figure out what it was.    Wont make again.

Very good!  I substituted crab for lobster, added about 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper, omitted the sherry, and substituted heavy cream for whole milk to reduce the fat content a little.

YUM! This bisque was phenomenal. The flavor was rich with a sweet, almost buttery aftertaste. My only complaint is that I couldn't get the lobster meat as "smooth" in the blender as the recipe calls for, but other than that it was perfect!

This is a pretty good starting recipe, but as with all recipes I made substantial changes to it. I was able to find a lobster boullion sauce that I substituted for the broth it called for, which gave the bisque a rich flavor. Also, I didn't strain the soup base but rather, pureed it in batches after cooking the veggies. I doubled the amount of butter to make the flour paste, and I used a can of diced tomatoes and 3 tbs of tomato paste instead of the tomato puree. I only added about 1/2ts of tarragon because of how strong the flavor of this herb is. I followed other posters' suggestions and set 1/2 of the lobster aside and chunked it into the soup after pureeing. I'm going to buy another lobster and cut up the meat and add it to the leftovers because it still wasn't quite chunky enough for my taste. All in all though this is a very good recipe!

This was my first attempt at lobster bisque.  This was pretty easy to follow.  I could not find fish stock in our store so I substituted chick broth.  Also, I chose to use uncooked prepackaged meat.  It was nice time saver not having to strain for the shells. Added worcheser sauce and red pepper Overall this was a great experience.

I am making lobster bisque for Valentines dinner this year and found my notes from previously making this particular recipe. In general I found the outcome to have too much of a tomato taste and the bisque too thin. Notes include: Use much less tomato puree or totally replace the puree with a bit of tomato paste, replace sherry with cognac, use double the amount of heavy cream, increase amount of lobster.

Wonderful!! Like most users, I took some advice of others and tweaked with my additions to make it chunkier:
1) used chicken stock instead of fish stock;
2) used cheesecloth (or a flour sack dish towel from WalMart) to wrap lobster shells in and soak in broth so straining not necessary;
3) added 1/4 cup of minced celery to the onion and carrot;
4) also added 12 oz. package of frozen Bernard's peeled and cleaned crawfish tails (thawed, drained and rinsed) in addition to the two lobster tails;
5) added extra 2 Tbs corn starch dissolved in 1/3 C heavy cream and added to broth to make thicker.
Whole family loved it! Served with Red Lobster mix cheddar bisquits. Plenty for 6 adults.
