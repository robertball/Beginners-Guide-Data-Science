I have been making this for a few years now and it is always a hit! Do add more brown sugar. When I want something a little different I mix in a can of crushed pineapple with the cherry pie filling. It is delicious!

This is the best cherry pie I've tasted.  The only problem I had with the recipe is that when I baked the empty pie shell for 10 minutes, it came out shriveled and burned.  Thank goodness they came two to a pack, and the pie baked up well without pre-baking the shell.

This recipe is extremely easy to make, and my guests loved it!! Between four of us, we finished the whole thing!  I did take the advice and doubled the brown sugar and added 1/2 tablespoon of almond extract to the cherry filling.  Served with homemade whipped cream and it was perfect!

This is the best cherry pie I've ever made! I wanted to make a recipe with cherries canned in juice, but couldn't find any at the local grocery store. In my hunt for a recipe using pie filling, this is the one that looked best. I'm sure it is! The only thing I changed was adding 1/2 t. of almond extract to the cherries. Wonderful!

I make this for every holiday by request.  I've never strayed from the recipe, however looking at previous comments I may increase the brown sugar in the crust for thanksgiving this year. This pie is good in all seasons and is a hit with everyone!

I loved this pie and will be making it again. I found it easier to make with the crumb topping as compared to a more traditional topping.

I thought the crumb topping could have been sweeter-it tasted like flour.  I'd put more brown sugar in next time and/or reduce the flour.

No changes were made with this recipe  and we loved it. Easy recipe to make with good results. Made twice now and liked it better when baked a little longer.

It was delish! Because I couldn't find my pie pan (we just moved) but I could find my mini-pans  - I made six individual sized pies. Obviously that required cutting down the cook time but otherwise, it worked great.

Not bad, but I wasn’t crazy about the cinnamon part, next time I will make it with out cinnamon. My shell was a little deep so I could have used a little more filling. That was on me not the recipe. otherwise it wasn’t too bad. It was slightly tart which what I expected.

This pie is now my son's favorite pie for me to make him every Thanksgiving.  And, the best part - I absolutely loved it too.  Easy to make,  but tastes like it took hours to make.

This is a really good cherry pie!  I didn't have sliced almonds handy, so I substitute slivered ones and we all loved it.  It made the topping nice and crunchy.  I never made a cherry pie with cinnamon mixed in with the filling, and I would do that again in a heartbeat.  It cut the sweetness down a little and gave it an earthy sort of taste.

We love this. I use "best ever crust ever" from this site (with half butter/half shortening). For the filling... I use 2 cans of cherry pie filling - my pie pan is 9.5' pyrex (I don't think its deep dish?). I double the cinnamon and add 1/2 t almond extract. For the topping... I double the brown sugar and add 1/4 t cinnamon, too. Great pie!

Yummy pie! I added some vanilla and a little almond extract with the cinnamon to the cherry pie filling. My family loved it and I'm taking a second pie to a potluck, it's sure to be a hit!

my husband thought this was the best cherry pie ever. I am not a big cherry pie fan and took a sliver and went back for the rest...,its that good. I followed the other comments and went with more brown sugar. I also used chopped pecans for the almonds (I am a pecan fan). I also used pie filling with the most cherries in it, not a time to by the cheep stuff. I will no longer make my own filling again. thank you for this recipe.

Used your topping plus flax seed, wheat germ and oats, with frozen tart and sweet cherries filling from another recipe. Loved the combo. Thanks for a great recipe.
