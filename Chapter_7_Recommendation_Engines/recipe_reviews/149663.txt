I LOVED this!  It tastes just like a rose smells.  However, it is more like an ice milk since its made w/o eggs and not cooked.  I may try to go the cooked route next time to get a more creamy consistency.

If you are using rose water rather than extract, you may need to add several tablespoons. I just kept adding, a half tablespoon at a time until it tasted like I wanted.

In the ingredients list it says "rose extract" but in the directions it reads "rose water."  I haven't made this yet, but will try rose water first since it is not as concentrated.  Will let you know how it turns out!  Thanks for this awesome, vintage recipe.  So cool!
