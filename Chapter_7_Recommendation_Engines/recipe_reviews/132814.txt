My husband is STILL raving about this recipe weeks later.  So simple yet flavorful, and the filets were a perfect medium.  I have attempted to cook filet several times before but never was it this good.  This recipe yielded restaurant quality results. Thank you so much for sharing.  And if at 14 you are already this good I cant wait until you have honed your skills.  You may be the next Bobby Flay :)

We made these filets for dinner today and fixed Garlic Baked Potatoes as a side (also found on allrecipes.com).  We grilled them instead of broiling them and they turned out great.  One thing we didn’t like was the shallots.  We thought they were a bit too strong and overpowering.  Next time I will just sauté mushrooms and onions to serve with the filets.  My husband also thought using butter instead of olive oil would be very good.   Thanks for a great recipe.

This turned out exceptional on the first attempt!  Make sure that you get yourself the top quality cut of meat.  

I served this for my fiance on Valentine's Day along with grilled shrimp and sauteed asparagus.  

Those recipes can be found here on allrecipes.com--

Pan-Fried Asparagus

Wonderful filet recipe!  Thanks!!!

It's a very simple and easy recipe. Whoever rated this as a 1 star cannot follow simple instructions. My steak came out the way my husband & I wanted it to be.

So, so simple and even my picky eater loved it! 
And for anyone else trying this recipe... I didn't use filet mignon, but a similar cut of meat and was out of onion powder and used garlic powder (my family likes garlic better anyway). My local grocery store didn't have shallots. I used green onions. Sprinkled some of the onions on the meat, sauteed the rest of the stalks with mushrooms and added on top after taking out of the oven. 

This was so easy to do. Meat was tender, flavorful. I'll use this recipe again!

Very "easy" and I guess you could say there's nothing more "romantic" than a nice filet mignon when it comes to a cozy dinner for two.  I did however do these a bit differently - I rubbed these with a bit of olive oil but left off the onion powder and chose to use a little minced garlic and kosher salt.  I let these come to room temperature and grilled them. It doesn't get any easier or any better than this!

I made these from a tenderloin that I had cut up. Other than omitting the shallots, I didn't change anything else. This recipe works really well with a good smoked bacon (applewood is my fav). Good job on this recipe!

Way to go "Chef in the making".  I think it is wonderful that you are learning to cook.  Very good flavor! Pairs nicely with carmelized onion mashed potatoes.

It's a great recipie!!  The steaks came out tender and very flavorful.  Thank you!  I didn't use the onion powder because I didn't have it, but it was so good!  As for the reviewers who think they might use butter for this?  The reason you shouldn't is that oil has a much higher resistence to burning in high heat (close to the broiler) than olive oil does.  If you really want butter on your meat then melt some after and pour it on.  If you cook with it, the meat will tend to burn on the outside.

Easy, quick, basic and delicious. I made it for my boyfriend who really likes simple type cooking and he loved this. So did I. I might try it with melted butter instead of olive oil next time. Thank you!

This recipe is not only EASY but DELICIOUS! It's funny because I try different recipes all the time and last time we made filets my husband and I were SEARCHING allrecipes.com for the "14 year olds recipe" lol It's THAT GOOD! You WON'T be disappointed. I do everything just as the recipe says EXCEPT we like it RARE so we only cook it  2-3 min. on each side and we don't use shallots, don't think I have ever had shallots- to be honest, I don't even know what a shallot is! haha The only thing I ask is to ADD MORE RECIPES KID! haha You are AMAZING. I hope my son can cook like you when he is 14!

Please be careful with this method.  My oven caught fire this evening.  I didn't think I used too much olive oil.  I think my highest rack placement may be too close to the heating elements.  I'm not sure.  It only took five minutes for it to catch fire.  You've been warned.

Great way to cook steaks when the grill is under snow!  Our steaks were very, very thick, so  they needed about 8 minutes per side (for medium rare).  Bacon even got a little crispy.  Thanks.

This was wonderful! I omitted the shallots since I didn't have any and I used maple bacon from Costco and it gave the steaks the best flavor!  I also saw in another recipe browning the steaks with a little bit of butter before broiling them.  I did this and the steaks browned very nicely.  My guest were all very happy and I received lots of compliments.  Awesome recipe!!!  I will be making this again!

AMAZING AND SO EASY! This came out great! I just made it for dinner tonight and it was the first time I have ever made filet mignon. The only thing I did different was minus the shallot and when it was finished I seared both sides of it on the stove. Just to give it a little color. It came out really great!

It was great...I did change it a bit....I let the steaks sit in red wine vinegar, on a plate. Then added the olive oil, onion powder, I added garlic powder, and Club House Montreal steak spice, and salt and pepper...i didn't have Shallots, so I sautade onions and mushrooms...I also pre-cooked the bacon for 3 min on either side....I also made a Garlic Butter for a melt on top once the steak was finished...2 cloves of garlic and 2 teaspoons of soften butter, rolled it into a roll in saran wrap. the cut pieces off about 1/2 inch thick, and let melt over the steak....I also let the steak tent for 10 minutes before serving (tin foil over a plate)...I would defiantly  make it again

I have used this recipe but in a modified version. Instead of broiling it I pan fried it in a hot cast iron skillet. I also made a wine sauce as a dipping sauce or pour it over the filets.  Sauce 1 cup of Burgandy Wine (use a good quality wine) cook it down to a 1/4 cup turn off burner and whisk in 2 TBS of ice cold butter. Add a pinch of sea salt and serve with Filet.

This was pretty good. I did not have toothpicks so the bacon came off. Once the bacon is done, the steak is done. DO NOT over cook filet mignon.

first off,,,,,, 5 to 7 minutes to each side in a 500* broiler is way too long....
Rare to Med rare,  4 min per side max, if they are a good 1 1/4 to 1 1/2" thick.
Never ever more than 8 min total even on hot grill........
If a bbq grill is not available...then broiler will suffice, but please, an expensive cut of meat should never ever be cooked/broiled/bbq'd more than enough time to be RARE to Med Rare.....anything more than that, you may as well have roast beef..........needs garlic.......and i prefer granulated to powder...does not clump up.  with a little whatsisheresauce added to olive oil pressed into slimly sliced or tenderizer pointed machine...........  otherwise,,,very good.......

Unbelievably good! Used garlic-infused grape seed oil, sea salt, pepper, garlic powder, then wrapped with bacon. We may see this young man on FN.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars! I used top sirloin steaks because it's what we had, but it still was the best steak I've ever made!  I also used garlic powder instead of onion.  I have a digital meat thermometer and cooked it until it was 145 degrees in the center for medium rare (our favorite).  This is a great way to tell if the meat's done without cutting into it.   Even my picky 3 year old kept saying, "Thank you for making this!"

I tried this recipe tonight, Filet Mignon was on sale, so I couldn't pass up the deal - have never made it though!  I followed the recipe with the exception of the shallots (kids and hubby not big fans) - came out perfect! My hubby and kids (7,6 and 2 years old) loved it!  They said that mommy cooks better than any restaurant!! Very easy and quick.  Only thing is that it is a bit messy in the oven, the meat and bacon popped grease everywhere.  Thank goodness for self-cleaning ovens!!

This came out great! Like another reviewer, I think next time I'm going to lower the rack, cause the bacon was turning a lil too brown! Other than that, it came out very juicy and just enough pink!!! thanks=)

Great recipe! I tweaked a little by adding some garlic powder to the steak and I used minced onion instead of minced shallot(because I didn't have it on hand). Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely make it again!

I was really happy with this!  Definitely let it rest for 1 hr prior to cooking.  So easy!  I did a separate mushroom shallot sauce w/ white wine instead of putting the shallots on top.  One note:  5 mins on each side is quite rare, make sure to do more than 5 mins if you like yours better done!

I bought filet mignon that was $27.99 a lb for Christmas dinner.  We only have an indoor electric grill.  I wasn't impressed and maybe it was because of the grill. I couldn't taste any of the spices I put on the meat.  May try again but not with such expensive meat!

YUM-O!!! Absolutely delicious and so very easy!!! This recipe is definitely a keeper. I used Durkee Grill Creations steak seasoning after coating filets in olive oil. Wrapped bacon around meat, secured with kabob stick and broiled on Low. So tasty. Husband LOVED it. Will be making again and again!

This recipe turned out fantastic and was so easy to make.  I made it for my husband and teenage daughter and they both loved it.  I put a little bit of minced garlic with it (1/8th tsp) and used sea salt from a grinder.  The meat comes out a perfect medium at 6 minutes per side.  I took a tablespoon of blue cheese per steak and put it on top to melt for the last 1 1/2 minutes.  I will definitely be making this again!

It's hard for me to rate, since I don't eat steak, but, made it for my 'steak loving' husband. I was worried about it being under the broiler too long, but he thought it was very tasty!  So, EASY!!  Will be making again when he wants a steak and no one else does.

I will never make this again.  If I want to taste bacon I'll fry bacon. No way do I want a great piece of meat that is expensive to taste like bacon. If I could rate zero I would.

Followed as written, with one minor change. Used a cast iron skillet instead of a broiler pan. Heated the pan first to full temp. Turned out perfect.  I'd suggest 5 minutes per side, as a starting point.

looking good so far but caution....using the top rack in oven on broiler might start a grease fire as the steaks start to splatter...had to lower temp and rack...pretty new rangeless GE model stove/oven so quite sure its not the oven but rather the heat level and the grease. I've just tasted it and  WOW! so tender and flavorful!

Perfect! Followed exactly and cooked to 130 using thermometer. Took out and let sit on counter while making a quick mixed lettuce salad with balsamic vinaigrette. Only difference was I used garlic powder instead of onion.

Excellent recipe, followed to a T.  However, if you are someone who likes onions then definitely double the amount of onions used.  It is great!!

This was delicious. I followed the recipe to a T except that the supermaket was fresh out of shallots so I used green onion and it was fabulous. It didnt look as wonderful as it could of ONLY because I didnt have toothpicks to secure the bacon but I made the most of it by garnishing it with fresh parsley to give it color and served with a side of garlic baked asparagus on a bed of rice pilaf and it looked perfect "Like a restaurant" is what my husband said :)

This turned out good - not a 5 star, but we liked it.  The bacon and topping of shallots added a lot of flavor to it.  I broiled it on a lower rack to make sure I did not set my apartment on fire or smoke us out, and that worked very well.

This was tasty - the bacon helps to keep moist a cut of meat that is prone to drying out.  I buy t-bone steaks and separate the strip and the filets from the bone, then cook them separately as they have very different cooking needs.  I'd make this again.

Perfect Christmas dinner for the three of us. Didn't use bacon since I don't like it.  Otherwise, followed recipe closely.  Five minutes each side, filets were cooked medium/ medium well (no blood).  Very easy and delicious!

Great!  I thought the scallions went great with it.  The bacon did make a smoky mess however.

This recipe was very simple and I loved it! So did my sweetie! I added a few more spices than this called for, though. Some garlic powder and steak seasoning...VIOLA! A simple, quick, romantic dinner was served! The bacon really enhanced the steak! Thanks All recipes for all the great tips and ideas! I  am going for the caramelized onions and mushrooms over the top of this tonight! We will see how it turns out!

I turned my back for a minute or two to prepare the rest of dinner on the stovetop, smelled something funny and when I turned around, there was a fire in my oven!  There were huge flames leaping up from the broiling pan!  Thankfully I got the pan out and into the sink without being burned, but the house was completely filled with smoke, set off all the smoke alarms and only improved hours later.  Maybe put a warning on the recipe that you need to keep a close eye on them just in case.  Not exactly the romantic meal I was hoping for!

So delicious! This has become our wedding anniversary dinner for the past 4 years. We're not into red meat very much but this is just too good! I've followed the recipe minus the shallots. I usually serve with green beans and wild rice.

Super easy and delicious.  Used onion instead of shallot based on some reviews.  Did not need any sauce, was very flavorful on it's own.  I did add a bit of garlic salt too.

Incredibly easy for a new cook! I tried for the first time ever cooking this and It turned out wonder! I couldn't believe how quickly it was done! I will say that I like mine well done so I needed to leave mine in longer but it's all in how you like your meat cooked! Perfect for medium well people like my husband.

I made these for Valentines dinner.  I have tried cooking filets before and had bad luck.  Who knew it was this easy. Followed recipe exactly except for shallots, and they were amazing!  If after 14 min. cooking time, they don't appear done, take them out!  They are perfect!  I did let them rest before we ate them.  Great job little cook!

This was simply delicious! However I wish I had timing for medium-well, as that's how my wife prefers it. All the same, it turned out medium-rare and succulent. I substituted the onion powder with finely crushed garlic, and the shallots with onion slices and a knob of butter. The natural flavor of the filet mignon is subtly complemented by the other flavors. It's simply delicious. Well done!

This was very good my husband said he would like me to make this often. And my 3yr old son cleared his plate. The key to this recipe is cooking time. So your steak gets  to your desired temperature (rare, medium or well).

These were moist and delicious. My smoke alarm went off though! Next time I will lower the rack. Thanks for the recipe and keep up the good work!

Best filet I've ever made.  I usually murder them!  I had the rack on the top rung and the smoke alarm went.   Lowered it and they turned out great.   Thanks so much for the recipe.  I can finally have someone over for a really nice dinner.

I just want to salute this young man for his expertise at such a tender age. You will have your own restaurant or cooking show some day, my friend. The steaks were marvelous. Don't just do this as a hobby. Make it your life's passion, as you seem to enjoy it so much. Remember this......make a living doing something you would do for nothing, and you will always be happy.

I made this recipe for the second time and it was better this time... New tip = make sure you take your filet's temperature to make sure it's cooked to your liking  .....
I cooked this for my boyfriend to celebrate yet another year together. Watch how long you cook this, otherwise 2 thumbs up!

If I could give this recipe more stars I would.  This was the best steak ever.  I made this for my husband and 3 kids and ended only getting 1 bite of my steak bc the kids were fighting for more.  On top of that my husband ate 3 by himself.  So, needless to say next time I will have to make about 10 for a family of 5 rather than 7.  I did add some red pepper to my husbands and he said that the heat was perfect and to all the steaks I added garlic powder.  I did crush a couple of garlic cloves and infused it over low heat to the evoo so it would have an extra layer of flavor.  I will def make again.

This was so very simple and the flavor was very good.  Our filets were thick, so I cooked them 8 minutes per side for medium rare.

I thought this recipe was great!  I made these for my mom & husband last night & we all loved it.  I did skip the shallots because my husband hates onions of any kind (although I can sneak onion powder by him).  I would make these again!

I didn't have shallots so I just bacon wrapped the steaks and sauteed onions and mushrooms in a frying pan.  I would never have thought to put olive oil on the steaks so thanks for the tip and the recipe.  Delicious.

Thank you so much! My family loved this recipe! The steaks were so tender and juicy. Even our two-year old gobbled it up! I've already got more tenderloins in the fridge to make it again.

I made this for a dinner party last night.  I was trying to decide between two recipes and decided to combine them.  I seared the beef on both sides in a little oil first.  Then followed the recipe by cooking with the broiler.  While that was cooking, I put 1/2C of reduced balsamic vinegar and 1/2C red wine.  This cooked with the beef drippings and reduced to half and got quite thick.  Once the beef was done, I drizzled the sauce over the top and served it up.  Best os two good recipes.  Delish!

This was so amazing and delicious. We definitely didn’t think of broiling it . We even added some scallops as a side dish . You’d pay money for a meal like that but was so easy to do at home !

So EASY! 6 minutes per side gave us a warm pink center in the steak.  I used onions to top them for the second side....wish I had used more.  That charcoal flavor on the onion complemented the steak/bacon so well.  Thanks, Chef In The Making :)

I made this exactly as written. No changes. It is delicious! I searched for a recipe because i bought some bacon-wrapped filets and wasn’t sure how to cook them so that the bacon was done, but the meat not over done. This recipe is spot-on for me. Well done to the chef who was 14 at the time of the original submission. I will remember this one.

Made this for V Day's special dinner.  As it was too cold to barbecue outside and was looking for something to make inside & this recipe fit the bill.  It came out fantastic.  Followed the recipe except setting the oven rack 2nd down from broiler element, as didn't want to mess up the element.  So added 7 more minutes of broiling to each side.  This is  a keeper in my recipe file.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us all.

My husband loved it, but he said you have to like the taste of meat, which he does. There was very little flavor for me, it was very tender and juicy but I like to taste all thelse ingredients.  Before someone says I didn't follow the instructions, I assure you I did to the letter, I bought two filets fresh from the butcher, bacon fresh as well. It was cooked perfectly and he enjoyed it very much. I will try again but will add more seasoning as it was quick and exceptionally tender. I will suggest a bit more instruction on boil, every oven has different broil options. For instance the oven I am using has low and high broil whereas my range I am waiting to have installed has specific broil Temps so knowing exactly what temp or broil setting would be helpful for someone who has never cooked filet before. Mine was done perfectly as indicated so I know I used the proper setting.

We loved it couldn't find the onion powder so I used garlic powder and also wrapped the fillets in Applewood smoked turkey bacon so we can eat a little healthier.  We like our steak  rare so we just put it in the broiler for about 3 to 4 minutes each side.  We would definitely make it again :-)

I have made this recipe 5 times now, cant get enough of it, this last time I didnt have any oil or onion, but it was still great, for the oil I used saved bacon grease so I tried that and it was super, I am scared to try it under the boiler so I put it in a hot fry pan and roll around on the sides to crisp up the bacon then cook the steak, also I cant afford the real stuff so I buy the cheap 2 pack that is already wrapped in bacon for 6 dollars at wally world and even with the cheapies they are great, I really wonder what I am missing with the real steaks, one day I will splurge and try them.

This recipe is amazing!!!  Made it for the pickiest person in the world and she keeps asking for me to make it again.  As is the custom there were a few tweaks.  Not having shallots I used garlic powder instead.  The filets came out delicious.  Steak is my bailiwick and this recipe has saved me.  Chef in the Making - you are on your way.
Oh - I did serve it with baked potatoes and pan-fried asparagus (recipe on site) instead of your recommendations - hope you don't mind.  Thanks for sharing!!!

It was a great meal for a Valentine Supper, great flavor and went very well with lobster tails, baked potato and fresh roasted asparagus. My wife was impressed. Now I have to figure a way to get her back in the kitchen.

I loved this! Kudos to any 14 y/o who came up with this. Outstanding.

To make it a little fancier than the potatoes and veggie our budding Wolfgang suggsted, how about baby carrots steamed just long enough to make them tender, mix a tbl or two of butter and the same of orange marmalade. Mix those up, heat and pour a thin stream over carrots. Pair this up with garlic bread and a Caesar's salad and oh boy, ring a ding ding!

Way to go 14-year-old -- I taught my kids to cook early also, and it was one of the best things I did.  Sounds easy and terrific!  PS to Swedish Chef - This will be "well" trust me!

This recipe was fenominal!  I didn't use the shallots but instead did mushrooms and onions.  It turned out even better than I had hoped!

I was wary about rubbing the steaks down in oil - and rightly so - the olive oil burnt up in the broiler and smoked up my entire apartment.  And while my apartment now smells like steak when I walk in - it wasn't worth having to throw open all my doors and windows for.  Otherwise bacon and shallots were a good addition. Thankfully the oil didn't burn the steaks and wreck the meal.

Fabulous recipe! I used green onions instead of scallots. I've made 3 times with filet and new york. Hubby loves this one!

This was a real easy and tasty recipe.  I only wished mine cane out more tender.

Not impressed.  Will not waste a Filet Mignon on this again.  Did not tatse bad, but I expect a much better taste that melts in my mouth when I cook Filet Mignon.  Very bland.

Wow!  We've ruined steaks the last 3 times we cooked them, until this recipe came along.  Yum!

I changed it up a bit, but the steaks turned out so flavorful! Onion powder is such a good idea. I grilled them and didn't use shallots.
