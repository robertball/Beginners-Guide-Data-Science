I made these last night for my boyfriend, 3 year old daughter, and I.  I used the garlic cream cheese filling.  I did not have garlic and herb, just plain garlic, so I used some Herbes de Provence to season the chicken, and lowered the minced garlic to 1 clove, as my child might have turned her nose up at too much garlic.  These crepes were creamy and smooth, very tasty.  I may try adding some precooked spinach to the filling to make it more interesting but, as they are, these were delicious.  Oh, I did not sprinkle the parsley, I just saw that :) I served them with a Mediterranean salad (lettuce, tomato, a little red pepper, and cucumber) and a balsamic vinaigrette.  Good combination.

Despite the crepes being time consuming, this recipe was really simple and delicious. I made it for our annual Christmas Eve Brunch and these were a HUGE hit. I did not use rotisserie chicken, but boiled and shredded some chicken tenderloins I had in the freezer. My cream cheese was a different flavor from what the recipe calls for (still an herb blend) and I didn't have fresh parsley but the thyme had great flavor. I popped one batch in the refrigerator to bake later (approximately 20+ minutes to heat through). Excellent recipe that I will definitely make again.

I can't vouch for the crepes, I used a different recipe for those, but the filling is absolutely amazing. Feeding three picky girls while still trying to make the Manhub feel like a king is tough. This one had everyone raving. I added a little extra cream cheese than the recipe called for, but other than that, no changes! This gets ten stars from the Summerhill family!!

Great crepe recipe.  The crepes were quick to make and very thin and light.  I adjusted the recipe for 5 servings (1 egg) and had a perfect amount of batter for 4 crepes, which is what I wanted.  Each crepe took about 3 TBS. of batter in my crepe pan.  Once the pan was hot each one cooked in less than 2 minutes.

Chose savory chicken filling today.  Will make these crepes again and again.  Thanks for the recipe.  Probably do them again tonight to fill with the rest of my strawberries and whipped cream.

I made these for Motherâ€™s Day and they were a big hit. I used almond flour, almond milk and almond milk  cream cheese to keep with our Paleo diet. No one could tell the difference and everyone loved them. They were good leftover the next day too. These were super easy to make so I will definitely make them again.

This had a great taste, but it was very, very dry.  Came out like a crepe burrito.  I made a basic chicken gravy with garlic and thyme and served it on top.  Then, it was given a thumbs up!

Delicious, I think I won't add the extra butter at the end next time....I think it would be just as good without. My daughter is a picky eater and she loved these!

This recipe is very tasty, I loved it! I didn't have the thyme so I added a bit of shallot with my garlic and it turned out great.  Also I used herb cream cheese.
