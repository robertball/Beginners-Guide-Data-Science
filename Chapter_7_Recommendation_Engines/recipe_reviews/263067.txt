This panino is delicious. Harissa is my new favorite condiment. Serve it on the side to dip your sandwich in. You’ll definitely want more than the 2 tbsp listed. I can’t figure out the need to dirty two skillets. I cooked everything in one large skillet, adding the pepper and onion mixture to a bowl and used a panini press (eliminating the need for the butter).
