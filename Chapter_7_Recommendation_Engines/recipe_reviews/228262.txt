Nice, simple, delicious potato recipe.  Who doesn't love potatoes and butter?  I halved the recipe, but added extra onions and baked in the toaster oven.  My potato-loving husband thought these were great.  They were very good and a nice compliment to 'Grilled Brown Sugar Pork Chips', another AR recipe.  Thanks Suzanne for sharing your recipe, it is a keeper.

It's really tasty!  I used 4 potatoes, 1/2 c. of olive oil, 1/2 c. grated parmesan (based on a reviewers comments), 1 t. of dried parsley (didn't have fresh), 1/2 t. of garlic powder (same reviewers comments). Mixed the dried seasonings together, lightly mixed with potatoes in a bowl, poured oil over, covered to shake/toss.  Baked at 350 for 40 minutes.  I should've seasoned it with some salt.

This is adequate but not very good.  There are a few ways to make oven potatoes crisp and delicious, unfortunately this recipe doesn't touch on any of them.

Soak the potatoes in cold water after they are cut or parboil (bring to a boil then continue to cook on medium heat, more than a simmer but below a roiling boil) for five minutes)  then drain.  Shake the potatoes in the pot to break or frill the edges, then coat with butter or olive oil - duck fat is great here too.

Cook in a very hot oven (425-450) for about 20 minutes, turn and continue continue cooking until desired doneness.

You can skip the frilling, but the blunted edges give the potatoes more crispiness and it's easy to coat them in the same pot.  You can also sprinkle a teaspoon or two of flour on the frilled potatoes before adding the fat,  this creates more browning and crispiness.

There are endless variations in seasoning, use whatever you like or go simple with salt and ground pepper. 

The extra step of soaking or parboiling results in genuinely crisp on the outside, creamy smooth on the inside delicious potatoes that will be in great demand.

I use russet potatoes as suggested by Serious Eats.

Good, basic recipe for roasted potatoes that supports, rather than competes with, a more boldly flavored meat dish.  Easy enough to vary with seasonings or herbs if desired.  I prepared this in cast iron cocottes for added crispiness.

I added garlic powder.  I also added grated Parmesan cheese to the last 5 mins of cooking at the same time that I added my dried parsley.  I loved the potatoes.  They had great texture and flavor.

Awesome awesome and so easy! Don't forget to add the fresh parsley because that just tops it off so nicely! I did add minced fresh garlic and extra butter, but otherwise the recipe was exceptional! Would be great grilled too! Great recipe!

I made this along with a chicken Marsala recipe i found here. This recipe couldn't have been easier and it was so delicious! I might add a bit of garlic powder next time, but that's only because i love garlic.

I followed this almost to the letter. The only thing I did differently was use garlic instead of onion and that was only because when I went to make the dish I realized I was out. I was a little worried about the baking time but they came out golden brown and cooked to perfection. I'll definitely make this again.

If you like your potatoes browned, you may need to extend the baking time or crank up the oven temperature which is what I did at the end, but they are delicious.

I had to bake for 60 minutes, but I think that was an oven issue. Very good potatoes!

I didn't have all the ingredients on hand for this particular recipe,  so I improvised by looking at another and used what I had on hand.  It still turned out very good and I was pleased with myself.  I plan on going to store next time I make these so I can try the recipe as written.

My family begs me to make this every time we have a big dinner together! I do double all the ingredients except of course the potatoes. If you want to make more potatoes then adjust the ingrediants as well. I double the rest of the ingrediants because it gives the potatoes just the right flavoring!

Simple, healthy, and delicious.  I made them while my roast was in the slow cooker.  The meal is now a family favorite!

Pretty good but unfortunately I had to rush mine to serve so they weren't quite as crispy as they could have been to make them worth 5 stars. They were done well enough and tasty enough, but they would have been way better if they were crispier.  Next time I will allow more time in the oven.

I cut the recipe back by half otherwise I made as written. They were good but I thought that they could used additional seasoning. Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe... very delicious!!! I used 6 red potatoes (I'm guessing that's about 2lbs) and substituted garlic butter for the regular.  I tossed the potatoes in the garlic butter with extra onions and season with a pinch of onion salt before baking.  My family loved it! I'm going to have to make a second batch and add some hickory smoked Beef Bacon to it.

My husband really didn't care for the flavor; it was a little bland even though I salted it well.

I made as written but omitted the onions and used olive oil,(2 Tablespoons to be exact!) My husband loved them,I thought they were okay. This rating is based on his,not mine.

These were good. They were a bit greasy, next time I would use less butter. I had to increase cooking time by about 5 minutes is all, I also added fresh chives from my garden at the end with the parsley.

I had red potatoes and wanted to make something besides potato salad. I was so happy to find this recipe. I also used 4 T. butter and a 1/4 cup of olive oil, per someone else's review. A little healthier dish with all the same great flavor. I baked it at 350 and left for church, for an hour. They were perfect when I got home. Just had to make steak and a tomato salad with onions, peppers and fresh basil. I will definitely make these again. Loved them.
