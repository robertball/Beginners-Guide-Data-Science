I wasn't sure how this was any different than washing the vegetables in water. Does vinegar kill potential bacteria? Either way, I was recommended it to get the wax off of some apples for a recipe. It didn't quite get the waxy shine off of the apples, but I guess it cleaned them better. I ended up rewashing them in super hot water to remove that. Plus, I was afraid of a vinegar after taste on the apples. If it kills something possibly deadly, and that is the intent, than great stuff.

I use a slightly different ratio of one cup vinegar to three cups water. I put soft skinned items in a bowl and soak them for about two minutes, longer for bumpy stuff like cauliflower and broccoli. If you soak strawberries too long, you'll start to get a vinegar taste even after you rinse them off.

Super easy!  Cost efficient!  Makes cleaning my fruits and veggies so much easier, especially when paired with the veggie scrubbing gloves, I eat more fruits/veggies now because it's so easy!

Just be sure to tell people there are differences in distilled white vinegar. Many are made with petroleum, which I don't want my food soaking in. Check the brands label to see if it gives what it's made from. If corn or grain, good....if nothing listed, you may want to skip or contact company. Also be aware that some of the companies that use corn are using GMO corn.

I have been using this idea for a while.  So much cheaper than fit.  I am still using the same fit bottle.  My proportions are 3 parts water to 1 part vinegar which is what I read in a magazine.  I especially use it for things I will eat raw.

This also works great for cleaning marble counter tops without damaging the stone!
