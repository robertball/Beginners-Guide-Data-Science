I adjusted the recipe to 6 servings, used evaporated milk and frozen fajita peppers and onions. Also substituted packaged salmon (5 oz,) for fillet. I used only shredded Asiago/Parmesan mixture, no cheddar.  I use what I have on hand. Turned out really good. That's my pic at top!

I used fresh asparagus instead of canned and steamed it before adding to salmon.  I used 5 eggs instead of 4 just because I had 5 on hand.  Also didn't have a 10" pie dish so I made this in an 8" X 8" 2 quart pyrex dish and it turned out fine.

I did tweak my version of the recipe and make in my pressure cooker. took way shorter time to cook and turned out amazing! so much that am making it again this week too. I did use both cheeses, evaporated milk instead, added onion and fresh asparagus first to cooker to start it with garlic then added rest for 20minutes to cook fully in pressure cooker.

This was great. I used real cream and fresh asparagus which I steamed lightly. I left out the cheeses.
