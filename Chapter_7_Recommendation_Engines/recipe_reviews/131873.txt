On the fussy side.  These came out surprisingly crunchy (a plus), but killer sweet (a minus).  Additionally, the honey sauce made for an awfully thick, sticky, dental filling-removing glaze once baked.  I *might* try these again with significant changes: use drumsticks for a better meat-to-glaze ratio, don't bother double-dredging in cornstarch (one coat will likely do), halve the honey to make a less sweet, less sticky glaze.  I was hoping to have a change-up from the hot wings my husband likes, and we both really enjoyed how crunchy these came out, but it was a little sweet for us.

These were really yummy, but kinda messy. The sauce is really sweet and gooey! I skipped the green onions. Also used flour when I ran out of cornstarch, and it was fine. Made these as part of our "fun and tasty finger foods" that we have every year while decorating our Christmas tree. Thanks for sharing, I'm going to make these for my next get-together.

This was a hit, followed the recipe, served with brown rice (which is yummy with the sauce poured on top) and pineapple and steamed broccoli and carrots. Forgot to add that we didn't fry just made the sauce as recipe indicates and baked.  Very good

these really turned out good they taste like the Hawaiian wings you get from wing stop, they take an effort to make but they are worth it

I'm giving this a 4 because of the difficulty with preparation and my opinion of taste.  I thought they were okay in taste but everyone else at the party thought they were fantastic.  One person took them home to her son who said "I want to shake the hand of the person who made these."  Won't make again for myself but will recommend to others.  Made receipe exactly as directed except I had to double the corn starch and eggs.

Ditch the wings part of the recipe, and just go for the sauce! Popped pre-cooked popcorn chicken into a gallon-size baggie with the sauce, shook really well, and served with sesame shaken on top. Everyone loved it.

These took a lot of time to prepare, and I thought at first it wasn't going to taste very good. But in the end they turned out very yummie. I used reg. sized legs and wings and added a diced jalapenos to the sauce for some kick!

Taste of the sauce was great, would have been 4 stars if I didn't cut down the cook time. If you follow the cook time exactly wings would be burnt in oven.
other than that will make again, very tasty

This was good, but not great. The wings smelled delicious, but not too much of the flavor of the sauce came through on the finished wings.

Very good!  Awesome flavor!  Not for the crock pot, though.  I tried using mine for a family reunion, and I don't reccommend it.

I used to live in Hawaii and though I miss the weather,  I miss the food even more! For a few new friends, we made this, yakisoba, pineapple banana cake, fresh pineapple slices and Hawaiian mac salad - it was all amazing, but the BEST was this chicken! Raved about by all, will make again asap- I made it as directed with a few tiny changes, doubled all sauce ingredients, EXCEPT honey (I used only 3/4 cup for the double sauce recipe which made it less sweet and less sticky), I also omitted the 2nd round (eggs, cornstarch, rd 2) of coating and did 2.5 lbs drumsticks and 2.5 lbs wings for a group of 7 people.  I fried drumsticks first and started baking them while completing the wings - perfecto! I basted more than 2 x (greedy me) and skipped the sesame seeds (didn't have) AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.
