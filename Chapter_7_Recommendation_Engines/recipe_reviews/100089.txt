What a treat! We have tried several variations. Our Favorite is black seedless grapes with raspberry Jello. A quick trick is to pour the Jello right onto the grapes in the collander after washing them. Toss them with a spoon before pouring into serving dish. Your hands stay clean and there is no extra Jello in the bottom of your bowl!

Great recipe: simple to make, tasty, attractive, and allows for flavor and color variations! I used strawberry and cherry gelatin mixes, and took them to a party. Good thing I tasted a few when we made them, because at the party, they went so fast, I didn't get any! 
For cleanup ease, we made these in a plastic ziplock baggie instead of on a plate--just be sure to let the grapes sit and dry a bit after being rinsed, or the gelatin mix will get clumpy and won't stick very well to the grapes.

My husband and 3 year old are literally fighting over who gets more of these, lol.  So easy to make too - just rinse grapes, put in a plastic ziploc bag, pour in the jello, and shake.  pour into a colander to remove excess jello and  you're done.

THESE ARE GREAT!  Adults and children both enjoyed these!  I made these for a graduation reception and used the colors of jello that matched the school colors.  It worked great!  They are best after they have had a chance to chill.   We have tried pretty much all of the jello flavors with this recipe. We love grape, cherry and orange.  I am going to make these for our July 4th party and use cherry, berry blue and grape jello.  The grape jello appears white on the grapes...so I wlll have something red, white and blue!  The kids can do this all by themselves too...from start to finish!  YUMMY...and healthy snack!

Holy  these rock! Made these for thanksgiving; my bf's sister couldnt stop eating them! Rinse them in a big colander and hit it in the sink a few times to drain. Then put 1/4 of the jello on the grapes and toss in colander until jello is wet. Repeat with the rest of jello. Put them in a bowl in the fridge overnight. This way they arent grainy and theres no mess. Awesome! Thanks for the recipe!

well I've found my newest 'quick fix' for a snack!  These are absolutely amazing.  Who knew something this simple could be so good, not to mention fat free! I used black cherry sugar free gelatin and did a combo of fresh seasonal cherries and red grapes.  Not only is the flavor amazingly good, but the variations are endless and would be a great way to get the kids to eat their fruit!  These are so pretty that they actually would make a beautiful platter with many variations of fruit/jello for a shower or reception.  Thanks for something so simple and quick!

I took this one step further and froze these after I rolled them in Jello--AMAZING. And I'll tell you, I've got the worst sore throat and these felt so good going down. We loved these!

Hi.  My name is Jamie and I am addicted to these grapes.  

They are so refreshing and tangy for summer.  Unfortunately my hands turn red every time I make them, but it's well worth the cosmetic inconvenience.  There was a contest at the library recently to depict a book in food form and I made these for the Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck.  They were the glittering upper class and I had raisins below for the underprivileged :)  Thanks so much!

This was awful.  Because there was no water, the gelatin was super concentrated.  The look was utterly unappealing.  I found myself wondering why I thought perfectly delicious grapes needed something sweet on them.  Here's my advice: take your favorite grapes, freeze them in a single layer on a cookie sheet or something like that, then eat.  No cherry-ish flavored powdered sugar required.

Made these for dessert for the grand's lunch...we loved them!!! I even cut some in half for my baby grand-daughter. She kept laughing & nodding her head so I guess she loved them too. LOL I used watermelon flavor but I can't wait to try others. Be warned, these are addicting so next time I will copy Tunisianswife & use sugar-free jello.

I thought these grapes were super. Used Sugar Free Black Cherry Jello and added 2 Tbs of white granulated sugar to it. Put the jello mix and the sugar in a gallon zip bag, added the grapes and tossed to coat. Really easy.

My initial thought about covering fresh grapes with a sugary gelatin mix was that it seemed tacky, but the raving reviews made me curious. I made mine with sugar-free cherry flavored gelatin. It is good if you are dieting and need a quick, super sweet fix. Other than that, I really don't see myself making it too often.

Yummy! I took the advise of others and put some of the jello in a zip lock bag, dumped into a colander and repeated. I replaced the bag at least once to keep the grapes looking "frosted" and not mini jello clumps sticking to them when the bag got too wet. I put them on a cookie sheet and refrigerated to set before going into a glass serving bowl. Oh, and I used a 6 oz. box of jello due to starting with a clean bag and wanting smooth flowing jello to shake onto the grapes.

I am really sorry, but no one really liked these at all. Maybe the flavor of the Jell-o had something to do with this. I used cherry flavor. They had a very sandy texture too, which nobody was a fan of. I did not want to waste anything, so I then added water to the mix and turned them into 'grapes in 
jell-o!' that was the only way my kids ate them. Sorry :S

The taste of jello was interesting at first, but after 3 or 4 it became cloyingly sweet.  Not to mention (ye gods) the MESS!  Fingers stained bright red from the jello.  Sorry, but we had to hose them off.

I made these to go along with the frosted cranberries I decorated my Christmas dinner table with. I used green grapes and lime jello powder, with a thought to use red and green Christmassy colours. These were really well liked and my guests nibbled on them throughout the meal. I think if I can find nice round shaped grapes they would look a little nicer. Mine were kind of oblong. I will do these and the frosted cranberries for many Christmas dinners to come. Thanks for a very unique idea.

WOW these are AMAZING!  I used strawberry jello.  I didn't have any problems with the jello clumping together on the grapes.  I washed the grapes and let them drain for about 5 min before pouring everything in a zip-lock bag and shaking it all together.  The grapes were all evenly coated with yummy strawberry sugar crystals.  It never really turned into jello on the outside so that may be from not enough water on them.  I dont care because they were awesome the way they were!  Next time I will coat them immediately after washing to see if I can get the jello texture coating on them to see how they taste that way.  These are sooo addicting!

I had to give this 5 stars for two reasons:   1) Ease of preparation   2) So delightful with very little effort   Other reviews warned of the addiction yet I felt very unprepared.  These were sooooo good! I was not satisfied until the bowl was empty.  After rinsing and while still in the colander, I sprinkled Black Cherry gelatin directly over the grapes (just as others suggested).  I'm thinking next time - after coating with gelatin - I will spread out on a baking sheet and refridgerate for several hours and then put into a decorative bowl.  This way they should all have the same texture when I go to serve.

A friend suggested making these for New Years Eve and I was appalled that someone would take a nutritious grape and add sugar to them. Plus it sounded unappetizing.  I was wrong.  We used sugar-free off brand jello and it was still amazing.  I have made these 3 times since then and even the picky eaters and fruit haters loved it.  I have made them both frozen and refrigerated (I prefer refrigerated, but might try them frozen again this summer).  WARNING:  These are highly addictive.

I have to admit I thought this sounded a little strange BUT I also have to admit it was a BIG success and not one grape was left over on New year's! Thank you very much for sharing. I will continue to use this recipe for years to come.

Wow!!!  When I first read this simple simple simple recipe, I wasn't sure.  Because I needed to bring something for a potluck and didn't have a lot of time, I figured I'd give it a try especially since others had raved about them.  After the potluck as many co-workers were raving about the grapes, one comment stood out, and I quote: "I can't stop eating these  grapes.  And I don't even like fruit."  I used the Black Cherry Jello on Seedless Red Grapes with colander technique.  Honestly the worst part was making sure I got all the stems off the grapes. I will certainly be using this at future events.  Thanks to all the previous comments.

These are so good!  I bought some green grapes and the skins were a bit more bitter than normal.  So I rinsed and allowed to drain in a collander for a bit, then mixed them in a bowl with a packet of cherry jello.  Instant difference.  They're like...candy!  Thanks for a really good idea!  :-)

Suprisingly good.  Easy enough to make.  I probably wouldn't serve these at a baby shower or anything just because they were kind of messy and did not look as pretty as I thought they would.  The taste was good though!

We made 2 versions.  first one as the recipe says and the second using green grapes and lime SF jello.  Kids ate a few, weren't crazy about the strong jello flavor and really disliked the stained fingers.  We tried toothpicks but couldn't get past the heavy jello taste.  I froze some and they liked that even more.  Still prefer plain ole frozen grapes au naturale...

I have been wanting to try this recipe. I finally was able to.  We had some huge green grapes that weere not very sweet, but I rememered this recipe! I used a sugar free watermelon gelatin on the green grapes and they are so yummy! It is like eating candy! My 2 year old loves them also!  It was nice to try something different with grapes.  Oh, after I drained the grapes, I placed in a bowl and sprinkled the gelatin over and put lid on, then shook them around.

Everytime I make these people go nuts over them. I found a raspberry/blackberry fusion jell-o that is to die-for on them. The secret is to not have them to wet or to dry. I rinse in a colander and shake off a little. Then use a large zip-lock bag. Add some dry jell-o, then a hand full of grapes, more jell-o, lightly shake, then continue in small batches until all the grapes are coated. Then dump into a bowl in put un fridge until serving.

These frosted grapes are awesome!  A less messy way to make these is to pour the jello powder in a ziplock bag, and then put the water rinsed grapes in with it and just zip up the bag, tumble it a few times and lay the bag flat in the freezer.

You must try these. I absolutely love this recipe. They are additive, just like everyone else has said. I have'nt even had the chance to share them with my kids yet but I know they will love them too. Thanks for a fast, easy and tasty way to serve grape. They will certainly be with me at the next potluck.

I think I may have added to much of the getlatin mix to some of the grapes. I wonder if it would coat more evenly if put in a baggy and gently shook? The flavor is interesting, I could get used to it! :)

Made these for New Years Eve. I didn't read the recipe right, and FROZE (Frosted) the grapes. First time I had frozen grapes, and they were great!  Can't wait for summer! Guests, including little kids loved them...I thought they were a little too yucky sweet!

This is a really fun idea, and the kids loved it.  I do feel a bit guilty adding so much sugar to a healthy food that the kids love already anyway, but it's fun for an occassional treat.

Someone recommended this recipe on the buzz except it was from another website, it was called Glitter Grapes, and it used only 1 pound of grapes. I used red grapes and sugar free raspberry Jello. So easy to do that my grandboys did it all. The boys, 3 and 7, loved making and eating them! I think they would make a great dessert!

Very Tasty!!  This is a sweet treat that is good for special occasions but it makes a lot at one time.  We used red grapes with raspberry jello and it was yummy!  Everyone loved it.  We made it in the afternoon and ate it after dinner.  The next day they weren't as good.

These were very good! I used green grapes as that's what I had on hand, and I kind of liked the color scheme--very Christmas-y. I think next time I'll try them with orange..or black cherry...or lime....!

These were a great idea and a fancy way to serve plain grapes. They are a little messy to eat though. My teen ate one and did not like them. I liked them freshly made, but did not like the flavor the next day. Cute idea, but not for everyday dining, these are better left for holidays and special occasions. Thanks for the recipe.

These were fun and easy to make.  A huge hit with the family and friends.  One suggestion, don't use off brand jello, because I did once when making these and the gelatin didn't set up as it should have and was still gooey on the grapes.

These taste good, but I had a hard time getting mine to set and look pretty.  I used black cherry Jello.  These are really good, but so are *regular* grapes, so I'm not really sure when I'd make/serve these again (made them this time because they intrigued me!).  I followed the tips of many reviewers and stirred in the Jello powder while the grapes were still in the strainer.

Fun idea but a little too sweet for my tastes. Also, it was hard to tell how wet or dry the grapes should be; too wet and the jello clumped up, too dry and the jello didn't seem to stick at all. Worth a try, anyways.

I tried this using green grapes and grape Jello - and then went on anothers suggestion to just toss 'em in a bag together.  I ended up with a ton of the mix sitting on the bottom of my bowl, so I personally, wouldn't recommend that.  I also thought they tasted a lot better - and not so sickeningly sweet after letting them sit in the fridge for a day.  Very good (and maybe think about eating them with a fork - unless you like your fingers turning colors!!).

Made these for my son's birthday party.  Way too sweet for my taste, but the kids loved them.  They are good as long as they are frozen, but once the jello starts to melt it becomes a big sticky mess.  Make sure there aren't unsupervised kids around this dish!

Very good.  I vary what flavor of jello I use when I make them.

I made these with sugar-free jello (following the suggestion of another review)and the concentration of artificial sweetener came out tasting very chemical-ly. After a night in the fridge, I rinsed the jello off the grapes and with only a hint of the jello flavor they tasted ok.  Might try again , but grapes are pretty perfect as is so why bother?

Red grapes are pretty good plain but I really liked these for a snack on a hot summer day!  It does make you feel like you are eating cherries though.  Wonder if grape jello would work too??  Or any flavor for that matter.  I will be trying other flavors.

I used white grapes and they looked like wierd olives, but tasted good.  I will make again though, using red grapes.  My family found them strangely addictive and ate the whole bowl!

They were okay. Kinda sweet. Hard to judge on how wet or dry grapes should be. Overall, this recipe was different. Nobody really raved about them. Most didn't care for the "sandy" texture. Might try again using cantelope or honeydew due to the wetness of fruit. Thanks for a fun try on something different.

I've made these many times and find that if you put the rinsed and drained grapes a handful at a time in a gallon storage bag and gently shake in the jello, they turn out evenly coated.  Also, I put them in a single layer on a cookie sheet in the refrigerator until they set and shake them occasionally.  After about 24 hours, they are better!

I used sugar free cherry jello and added TrueLime crystallized lime for a cherry limeade flavor.  My husband who doesn't really like grapes couldn't stop eating them. Thanks for a great recipe!

8.16.16   Here’s a tip to avoid having red fingertips from rolling the grapes around.  I just placed the grapes into a pie pan filled with the box of Jell-O®, shook the dish until all grapes were coated, and then removed them to a plate with a slotted spoon.  This really is a fun treat, and it just doesn’t get much easier than this.  A tasty pop of sweetness!

I made these grapes for church book club and everyone LOVED them. As suggested in the reviews, I mixed the jello mix through the grapes while they were still in the colander. This worked really well and made for a very neat looking presentation. I suggested that my friends use a fork or spoon to eat them because I was concerned that the strawberry jello would get all over their fingers. However, the jello powder "sets" and does not come off on your fingers. Highly recommend!

These grapes were very yummy!  We used black cherry jello for half of the red grapes and peach jello for the other half of the red grapes.  I loved both.  My husband and friend decided they liked the black cherry jello with the red grapes best.  We'll be trying other flavors of jello too.  Thanks for the recipe!!
