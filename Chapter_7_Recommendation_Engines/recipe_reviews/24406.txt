This was a good start, but when I made it to the recipe the first time, I had to throw it out -- it was a greasy watery soup of unseasoned meat and beans.

The second time, I sweated the onions (in a tiny bit of olive oil) separately from the beef.  When the beef was browned, I drained the grease and patted it dry.  Then I added the spice package (plus a lot of extra chili powder, paprika and garlic powder, plus some Worcestershire sauce), and gradually added water as the spices and meat cooked together.  Most of the water cooked off, and then the onions were added.

From that point, I followed the recipe, with the addition of some srichacha (asian pepper paste) right at the end -- added a lovely kick.

With those changes, the recipe is a definite keeper for us.  :)

This chili was SO GOOD!  I've made it two times now and the first time I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added a teaspoon of cumin.  It was delicious.  My only complaint was that it was a little soupy and would have been too runny for chilidogs.  So the second time I used a half cup water instead of two and it was just the right dog consistency.

Not bad, I love using the crock pot. I thought it was a bit sweet and may try leaving out the tomato paste next time. It makes a lot and I've had leftovers for lunch many times. Don't forget to serve some good bread with it!

My family enjoyed this chili.  I used two cans of baked beans (that's what I had and my daughters like a sweeter chili), then added a chopped green pepper, a teaspoon of garlic powder and a teaspoon of chili powder.

Average. The canned tomato soup was overpowering. My family kept asking what *is* that taste. I used 1 1/2 cups of water and 1 tsp. of cumin. I did not have 2 lbs of ground beef,  so I used 1 lb. ground beef, 1/2 lb ground turkey and 1/2 lb. ground sausage. Make sure you *drain* the ground beef (I always do) *before* adding seasoning mix and putting in the crockpot or it will be runny and greasy. My family ate this but ask me to go back to making chili with *beer instead of tomato soup!*

I had high hopes for this recipe but it just wasn't happening. Chili should have a nice bright taste. I think the baked beans made for an odd filmy texture and taste that didn't belong. I have used tomato soup in another recipe - Hoosier Daddy Chili -from this site and it blended in well so I don't think the failed taste had anything to do with that. Too bad really, as it was easy to prepare. Thanks anyway.

I've had this recipe in my recipe box for almost two years but kept passing it by.  What a mistake!  It's really good chili.  I changed it a bit.  I only made half the recipe by using half the beef and onion, one can of baked beans, a rounded tablespoon of tomato paste, half the seasoning packet, some green pepper and minced garlic and one can of the soup and then the tomatoes.  I didn't add any water, and it was the perfect thickness.  It seemed a bit hot for my little guy's taste so I added a handful of brown sugar.  I served it over pasta with cheese and onions on top.  This will now be my standard chili recipe.  Thanks.

A waste of 2 lbs of ground beef.  It tasted like something out of a can.  I thought the baked beans would bring an unusual twist to this recipe but they were a big mushy disappointment and have no place in a chili.  The tomato taste was way over powering and you could taste the soup.  This is something I can guarantee I will not make again.

I made this for  dinner last night and I have to agree.... this is awesome!  It wasn't to spicy, but could easily be made spicier if thats what you like.  I didn't change anything and I loved it!  I will forever use this recipe.  No more canned chili for me!

Made for a tastey and easy chili.  I chose not to add any water because I prefer a thick chili.  The relatives and neighbors had positive comments.

This was a fabulous recipe.  I had never made chili before and my family loved it.  I started with 1/2 cup of water and then added more as it cooked to keep it to the consistency we wanted.  I also added a can of Mexicorn as suggested by another review.  This was a wonderful recipe and we are all looking forward to leftovers tonight!

Over the years, many bowls of chili have passed over these lips, but none with such a unique flavor. I will continue to enjoy this recipe. However, add some cumin for a bold flavor.

My family loved this chili...the only things that I changed were that I added some salt (to taste), and I added about half the water. It was perfectly beany, meaty, thick, and rich. It DEFINITELY tastes even better the next day. I will definitely be making this again, although I will add some green bell peppers next time. Thank you!

This is an excellent recipe.  I have made it twice.  The first time I fixed the recipe, I left it as is.  It was wonderful.  The second time I used the recipe, I tweaked it a bit.  Instead of using the onion, I used a sweet red & green pepper.  Instead of using the diced tomatoes and chiles, I used diced tomatoe and sweet onion.  I eliminated the baked beans and used pinto beans.  My brothers loved it.

I deleted the water and the consistency was nice and thick- like chili you eat in a bowl rather than as a topping.  I also added a chopped green pepper for some color and texture.  The only problem I ran into is that it was a bit mushy after 2 hrs- I sampled it at about 1.5 hours and it was delicious, but then I left the rest for the remaining half hour, and the beans were mushier than I would have liked.  I'd sample it after an hour and fifteen minutes or so, and if you like the consistency then, just take it out.  Next time that's what I'll do.

I thought this recipe was awesome! I never made chili before and was very nervous about it because my husband loves chili...but he loved it! I was very happy on how easy it was to make! The only thing I did different was put only 1/2 cup of water.  It was perfect!I will definately make this recipe again!

I liked this recipe except there was too much tomato sauce taste. It needed more flavor. I don't know exactly how I would change it but it was almost like spaghetti sauce with chili beans in it.

This chili was wonderful and so easy to make! And just like another reviewer, I thought it tasted just like the chili at Wendy's.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for and was very pleased with the results!

This is the best chili I have ever made.  It tastes just like the chili that you get at Wendy's.  I like my chili sweet, so I added a tablespoon of brown sugar.  Otherwise, it's PERFECT!!!

Love this recipe, I’ve probably made it 30 times since I originally found it. You can add various chili’s or tomatoes to spice it up but the original recipe is solid. One thing we typically do is do one pound of ground beef and one pound of spicy hot Italian sausage. Definitely adds some kick and flavor!!

I love this chili. I make and serve it a lot. Try it. It's simple and very tasty.

The ingredients for this recipe were so easy to just throw in the crockpot, which I liked. Since it was my first time making this, I made the recipe exactly as is except for some chili powder in addition to the chili seasoning. I wouldn't call it "chili". To me, it was more of a soupy bean casserole & too on the sweet side because of the baked beans. Overall, not impressed & this one is not a "keeper" for me.
