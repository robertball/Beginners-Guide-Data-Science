Perfect. Other than adding some fresh, minced garlic to the marinade, I made this exactly as written. Beautiful, delicious, and oozing with simple, fresh, Mexican flavors.  Some reviewers thought this was tasteless--not for us and what I chose to serve this with--Mexican Rice III and Best Black Beans, the combination of which made for a meal I'd be proud to serve to anyone!

Ridiculously good. I marinated the meat overnight,and included maybe 1/2 teaspoon of diced garlic in the marinade. I threw the zucchini and peppers in the marinade for the last hour, and then took them out and hit all the veggies with some olive oil, salt, pepper and cumin. Skewer everything and then drizzle any remaining marinade over the kabobs.

Made this dish twice and thought I'd better get my review in!  Wonderful! Husband and young sons loved it. Served over a bed of chicken rice, salad and warmed potato rolls on the side.  Looking forward to making for my sisters and their families when they come for a visit. All can be prepared in advance. Give me time to chat with my sisters while the guys do the grilling!

AWESOME! Hubby and 4 small children loved it! I added minced garlic as well to the marinade. Am making it again tonight as the family is requesting it. I'm constantly amazed at the reviews on here that say something like "the cumin was too strong, won't remake"....uh? decrease the cumin....recipes are made to increase/decrease spices according to your taste....anyway! Don't miss out on an awesome recipe....you won't regret making it!!

My BF loves (LOVES) cilantro ... he calls it the "secret ingredient" for anything.  So I HAD to make this and it didn't dissapoint.  He asked "how'd you get the cilantro flavor into the chicken?" ... compliment!  Instead of using skewers, I had an epiphany that has forever changed the way I will grill:  I used CleanBBQ aluminum disposable grill liners - they're bendable, so I layed everything out on them, folded them over and crimped the sides so I could flip them easily and the food still had real grill lines.  I used separate ones for meat, zucchini and tomatoes.  Seriously, try this!

WOW!  This was sooo good!  I served this for dinner to friends and we all agreed this was great.  I only marinated the meat for an hour and it was soo full of flavor, I was shocked.  I drizzled the remaining sauce over the kabobs just before grilling and everything was so flavorful and a great combination of vegetables.  I will definetly make again!

I scanned allrecipes.com for recipes for a 50th birthday fiesta for my husband. Came across this kabob recipe & made to serve 4 to see if they would be a good item to serve at the party.  I let marinate for a few hours and they were good, so I gave them a whirl for the party but since I was making so many (for 30 people) I prepared the chicken the day before so the chicken marinated for 24 hours and also added about a  tablespoon of minced garlic and that was the key to them being great! Everyone raved about them! Served with lime cilantro rice and four fruit salad from this site and also from this site served Kris's Amazing Shredded Mexican Beef with tortillas and condiments  - - - All great items to serve for a fiesta . . . even got a couple of requests for me to cater graduation parties! These recipes are awesome!

The cumin taste was very strong and overpowered the chicken (and this is coming from someone that likes cumin).  The chicken was tender, but any chicken that is marinated and grilled in this fashion would be.  Won't remake.

These definitely should be marinated overnight. The flavor was great. I even basted them while grilling with a little EVOO mixed with lime juice and chili powder. Gave it great color and flavor.

Tasty dish! I doubled the marinade and split it into two, using one half for the vegetables, the other for the cubed chicken meat. I added some chopped garlic to the marinade. I marinated everything for a couple of hours. Grilling time was approximate. The aroma smelled wonderful while the chicken cooked on the grill. The chicken was tender, juicy and fresh tasting. The vegetables were lightly seasoned with the marinade. The colors of the zucchini and cherry tomatoes were vibrant and made for a pretty dish. There was just enough ground cumin in the marinade, not overpowering at all, mixed well with the lime juice and olive oil. I loved the simple fresh blend of flavors. I served this with, "Mexican Rice III," and "Best Black Beans," also from this website.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This recipe was a little bland.  Here are some suggestions for improvement:  Marinate overnight, add 1 tbl spn chopped fresh garlic, increase cumin to 3 tsps, add 1 tsp of chili powder, add 1 tsp of oregano, or mexican oregano, if you like spicy add some paprika and crushed red pepper to the marinade, include a jalapeno on the skewer (halved and seeded).  With these changes, I think this recipe becomes 5 stars.

What a great grilling recipe.  These were tender, flavorful, and delicious.  I doubled the marinade and added finely chopped onion instead of the powder and a little orange juice to add some more moisture.  My hubby grilled them to perfection.  A great summer entertaining recipe!  Served with Orange Cilantro Rice, a perfect combination.  Thanks for sharing, CJ!

Not as tasty as I had hoped.  I marinated these for quite some time.  The cilantro taste really didn't come through.  It tasted like plain chicken, peppers, etc. instead of any type of marinade.

Loved these!!  I served these alongside Quinoa and Black Beans and it was a fantastic meal!  I marinated my chicken for about 16 hours and I swapped the cilantro for parsley as we are not fans!  I did add a few cloves of minced garlic to the marinade and about 1/2 tsp of chipotle chili powder too.  Used both orange and yellow bell peppers for colour...so good, a great fresh summer meal!

Very flavorful and colorful. My family enjoyed it very much.  I did marinate the chicken for 24 hours as others suggested; we could taste the delicious flavors all the way through.  A great make-ahead meal!

Excellent recipe. The chicken was very tender. I made this recipe with the Mexican Rice III and the Best Black Beans recipe (both on this site) as suggested by another reviewer. What an easy way to feed a group of people. It was a hti.

This was amazing! My husband said the kabobs were "restaurant quality." I marinated the chicken and veggies for about 5 hours, then skewered and grilled.  While grilling, I squeezed fresh lime on them...they turned out so tender and moist! Will definately make again.

Five stars all the way from this house! Even my son who "hates everything" said this recipe was "awesome"!!

The only things I changed was I added some garlic powder to the marinade as previously suggested and I not only marinated and grilled chicken breast cubes but beef cubes as well. It was wonderful!! I served with mexican rice hot tortillas and salsa on the side. I cannot rave about this recipe enough and you can be assured it will be a part of my summer bbq recipe collection! Thank you

Great recipe for the grill. I added a little cayenne pepper for some heat, omitted the cherry tomatoes (because I don't like them) and added mushrooms. The meat stayed juicy, and everything had a great flavor. I will definitely make this again.

For us, there was nothing Mexican about this dish unless you count the cilantro so I don't know why it's so-named.  Cilantro is just as popular in Thai cuisine, but oh well.  I made this as written, but followed others' suggestion and marinated the chicken chunks for 24 hours.  We liked the flavors, but again, this IS NOT Mexican so if that's what you're looking for, keep looking.  I'll probably make this again, but then again, maybe not.  Thanks for the submission anyway!

The lime flavor was a little strong but I really liked this dish. We eat so much chicken we should have feathers, and this was a great alternative to the same-old same-old. We will make this again.

Made it for a party everyone liked it. Soaked the chicken overnight and then soaked the veggies for a couple of hours. Add mushrooms too. Make sure you soak the skewers too

Not bad.  The chicken was a little bland.  Won't be a regular in our house.

I used ready made chicken breast kebabs and marinated them as is (didn't use the veggies).  Lovely subtle flavour and the lime juice made them wonderfully tender and moist.  Thanks CJ

Really great!  I marinated the chicken pieces all day and I also added fresh chopped garlic to the marinade.  I assembled the kabobs in the evening, and grilled them the next afternoon - everybody raved about how deliciosu they were.  HINT:  Grill them on low heat turning often so they do not char too much...will make again!!!

Excellent marinade! Since it isn't grilling weather around here, I marinated chicken tenders overnight and then baked them for 45 minutes. After cooking, I topped the chicken with fresh salsa and everyone loved it!

Very, Very good! Even forgot the tomatoes.. still great! No need to marinate the chicken more than an hour. At one hour the acid in the lime juice had started to cook the chicken (can you say ceviche?.. can I spell it?).  Resist the temptation to add garlic. I think it would detract from the clean flavors. The cumin, cilantro, lime juice combo is great. Brush your skewers with a little more olive oil and sprinkle a little more salt and pepper on the veggies before grilling. Serving on a bed of white rice rocks it!

These are good, and very good in a warmed tortillas with some salsa. They were a bit mild for my taste, so next time I will add some chili powder, garlic and maybe some cumin.

These were good. I marinated the chicken for 6 hours and was hoping it would have had more flavor. I made exactly as written. I will make these again but maybe next time I will add extra spices.

These were really tasty.  I had to put ours under the broiler, as it started pouring outside just as I was about to fire up the grill.  We did not do the tortillas, but instead served them over Mexican Rice III.  Will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe

Very good but would have liked to taste the lime more. Might be better if the lime is squeezed on last, just before serving. I served this with rice, chips and salsa. Also I added jalepenos to the skewers for an optional kick.

The chicken was AMAZING. Juicy, tasty, zesty. Loved it, loved it. I replaced the zucchini w/yellow peppers though, just a personal preferance and the kabobs looked brighter. These were a hit on the grill for Memorial Day.

I did not put the ingredients on a stick because I didn't feel like it but I put it together in a pot and served over spanish rice and it was very good. I wouldn't put the tomatos in it next time though, they got a little too soft even though I put then in to heat them up before serving. I will defiinately make this again.

Very good. I am not much of a griller so I used the broiler on the oven. Perfecto. I took a suggestion from another reviewer and served this with soft tortillas, Best Black Beans and Mexican Rice III. Everyone was more than satisfied with taste and portions.   The Chicken was tender and very flavorful, I marinated it for @ 3 hours. It was perfect, even the baby loved it!

We made this for the 4th of July this year.  We increased the recipe by adding one extra chicken breast, doubling the marinade and increasing the veggies accordingly.  We loved the marinade, it was great.  The onions carmelized nicely and the veggies were good.  The only negative I thought was that the tomatoes kind of split and peeled and didn't taste that great (and were much hotter than everything else - be careful!), but maybe we had the heat wrong for them.  I would substitute a different veggie for them next time or maybe stick fresh ones on the skewers at the end of cooking.

This recipe was the best marinade for chicken and veggies kabob me and my family have ever had.  I tripled the recipe and I separated the chicken and the veggies in it's own marinade so that they could cook at their own time, I wanted to have some leftovers but, we liked it so much that no-one could stop eating it.  I make a somewhat similar marinade but I liked this one much,much better. My kids have even swore to hate zuchini but, not anymore!....It is a definite keeper!!! * Yumm Yumm *  Thanks for the recipe

4.5 stars.  The chicken was superb!  Perfectly flavored and juicy!  For our tastes, the veggies (particularly the zucchini) did not get soft enough by the time the chicken was done, even though we used high heat.  Next time I will either grill my veggies on a separate skewer or eliminate the zucchini.  I will also use this marinade solely for cooking the chicken, as well.  I served this with Cilantro Lime Rice and Easy Corn Salsa, both from this site.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe, CJ!

They looked beautiful and tasted great except that the chicken was a little dry and I grilled on med-high for around 10 min.  Black beans on the side went great.  It is more a recipe for 2 than 4.

We substituted beef for chicken, and I should have marinated it overnight instead of only half a day. (The meat was a little tough). Also, we used bell pepper, zucchini, and mushrooms for the veggies.

This was my first stab (pun intended) at kabobs, and it wasn't too bad. My husband liked it much better than I did; I found it slightly bland. I'll probably try this again, because it's so healthy. I just need to find the right side dish (we tried the salsa and warm tortillas; I didn't like it at all). I'll cut the zucchini thinner and make the chicken cubes smaller as well.

WOW! Awesome recipe! I added a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic to my marinade and used the juice of 3 (small) limes because I doubled the recipe.  I let the chicken marinate for 3 hours.  They were gone in a jiffy!

These really didn't have a lot of flavor and I'm not seeing that in any other review.  I'll make these again however next time I'm going to do what one review said...baste with EVOO, lime juice and chili powder while cooking.

Really good. The marinade was simple and easy to do. I enjoyed the zucchini with the chicken. I left off the tomato because I didn't have the grape tomatoes and was too lazy to cut tomato wedges. I used red onion and red peppers. Very pretty colors and very YUMMY!

This was delicious. My 2 year old and 11 year old loved it, my husband loved it, and my mother in law loved it! What more can you ask for? Best meat on a stick ever!

Very good marinade. Chicken turned out very moist, with just the right spices. We had this over Memorial Day and right now it is marinating in the fridge for tonight.

Loved this chicken.  So easy and yummy.  I added a little cayenne or red pepper flakes and a crushed clove of garlic to the marinade.  I also have substituted about a teaspoon of dried oregano when I didn't have any cilantro and liked it just as well if not better.  My family loves it.

So good! I didn't have any tomatoes, but they were so yummy even without them. We added a little bit of extra cilantro and used a sweet white onion. I'll definitely be making this many times- fast, easy, healthy and delicious!

I marinated for two hours and got a nice chicken kabob.  Too much longer and you'd risk getting a lime kabob.  As is I got a good, fresh, clean flavor. Mexicana may be a misleading name.

I was very dissapointed with this recipe.
The lime overpowered everything else. There were no other flavors to this, just LIME.  I marinaded the veggies like some others had suggested...bad bad idea.  Lime veggies are not good either.
I wouldnt make this again. :-(

This marinade has a great taste to it. As a personal preference I double amounts and let the chicken marinate overnight. I love Cilantro so used quite a bit of extra fresh cilantro on the whole thing. I think I will try this marinade on different meats as well - will let you know how it works!

Not much flavor.  I even let the chicken marinate overnight.  My husband ate after the rest of the family so I cooked his separately and put olive oil/salt/pepper on his veggies before cooking the kabobs and that helped.

Made these for a crowd and they were a huge hit. Marinated the chicken all day, should have taken others' advice and marinated the veggies as well. Added mushrooms to the veggies, because my husband loves them, but otherwise followed the recipe. I'll definitely make these again.

The lime and cilantro are excellent summer flavors. I marinated the chicken all day and added the vegetables to the marinade for the last hour. I served these to guests and the reviews were wonderful.  We'll definitely make this again.

This was really good! The chicken was delicious and the only thing keeping it from five stars is that I think the veggies needed some kind of marinade or seasoning, too. Very good and I will make again!

This is a wonderful and very tasty recipe.  The combination of lime, cumin and cilantro is so tasty.  I like to serve this alongside grilled corn on the cob brushed lightly with a bit of the lime mixture.  It's just so delicious that way!  This recipe is a keeper that my family and I enjoy at least once a month.  Thanks CJ!

Absolutely loved this.  It is nice to get a different flavor for chicken on the grill.  So many marinades end up being the same old thing.  This definately gave the chicken a nice bit of oomph! that is sometimes missing.

I added a little bit of Corona to the marinade, since I had it out already ;-).  I was also using key limes, so used juice from one and a half limes.  Instead of cooking these as kabobs, I just put the chicken in a grilling basket and flipped it over halfway through.  Either I got lucky with an excellent piece of chicken, or this marinade did an incredible job of keeping everything nice and moist.  My husband and I both kept commenting through the entire meal how good the chicken was.

I served this with grill asparagus (olive oil, pepper, and garlic salt).  A big hit.  I will be making this next time we have guests over for a cook out.

So good and so easy! I added whole mushrooms to the veggies and marinated everything (not just the chicken).  After three hours of marinating, I "skewered" the kabobs and brushed them with more of the marinade before putting on the grill.  My children and their friends LOVED this recipe.  I made extra thinking I would have for lunch the following day..... WRONG!  Will definately make again very soon.  Kabobs, served with spanish rice and warm tortillas will make a wonderful "deck dinner" with friends.  Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty. Due to a last-minute change in weather, I cooked these in the oven rather than on the grill (18 minutes at 450); also I included a few slivers of leftover summer squash and used dried cilantro instead of fresh. The flavor was excellent and the marinade kept the chicken juicy. When I next make this I'll set aside some marinade to brush over all the veggies and ensure they're as flavorful as the meat.

I added minced garlic to the marinade, used 1/2 tsp. of cumin instead of 1tsp., and used dried cilantro, since that was all I had on hand. Also, I brushed the skewered vegetables with olive oil and seasoned them with a bit of sea salt, garlic powder, and fresh ground pepper. This was a really delicious and easy meal. The chicken was excellent, moist, and tender. Veggies were delicious. I did skewer each food separately, e.g.,, red pepper on one skewer, chicken on another skewer, to allow for variability in grilling times for each.

I didn't find this overly flavorful when I made it. Added minced garlic to the marinade and let it marinade for 4 hours. If I do it again I'll try doubling the spices and marinating overnight to see if that improves the flavor.

These were very good. I made them to go with the Quinoa with Chickpeas and Tomatoes also from this site b/c they had the same flavors. My husband loved it. I added some cayenne pepper and fresh minced garlic as I think some reviewers recommended and I also marinated the veggies with another batch of the marinade. The zucchini was delicious!!! We will be making this again, thanks CJ!

This was perfect! The marinade was amazing...I took advice from other reviews and added 2 minced cloves of garlic to the marinade. I also made twice as much and marinated the veggies and chicken separately for at least an hour then grilled. Perfect and light. I made black bean and corn quinoa to go along with and it made the perfect southwestern dish.

The only thing I did differently was add some chopped garlic to the marinade but that's it! I marinated for about 3 hours. Thanks for posting. I will definitely make this again. My family scarfed it down!:)

My husband made this for dinner tonight and we LOVED it! Subbed green peppers for the zucchini because we didn't have any and added some potatoes to the skewers on a whim. Made with Rice a Roni Spanish rice. Definitely will be adding this to our recipe collection!

Love the fresh cilantro in this.....I marinated my chicken chunks for about 4 hours....I also added 1 tsp. of chili powder to the marinade....I will actually marinate for 24 hours next time for more intense flavor....all in all....super yummy. Thanks!

Excellent. I've made this a few times now, never marinating for more than an hour or so. The flavor is always sublime. I can see how some people might find the cumin overpowering, but we really love cumin so it's fine for us. I add garlic to the marinade and mushrooms to hte kabobs. Thanks :)

Fantastic recipe.  Followed it exactly and it was great.  We served it with tortillas, homemade jalapeno hummus and saffron rice.  Wrap it all up in a tortilla and YUMM

I love this recipe!  My only complaint is that I should've doubled the recipe!  My family loved it so much and wished there was more!  It was not enough for 3 adults and 1 kid.  The chicken came out very tender.  I also served it with the mango, avocado (and papaya) salsa also from this site which complemented the kabobs very nicely.

Good taste, but the marinade didn't blow us away.  For all the big flavors - cumin, lime juice, cilantro - the dish was surprisingly bland.

Quite tasty.  I added more garlic and more lime to the marinade.  As the dish would be a bit plain on its own, I stuffed the grilled meat and veggies into taco shells and covered them with salsa and sour cream.  If you don't want to do this, it might be a good idea to baste the skewers with a sauce for more flavor (though I am not sure what would work well).  Any suggestions?

This was very good, but adding fresh garlic made it even better. I also used it on skinless chicken legs and let it marinade for a couple hours. The whole family likes this one. Thanks for sharing.

Doubled the marinade, skewered the chicken and onions separate from the other veggies (and seasoned veggies with different marinade), basted chicken with butter/olive oil mix while grilling.

This is so delicious. A very good diabetic meal. I used the ingredients the recipe called for but I added a few more seasonings for a little kick. I added for seasonings chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder and Cheyenne pepper to the marinade and a little more olive oil. Served with a soft flour tortilla and picante sauce and a little Spanish rice.

5 stars. Very nice recipe. I made a few minor changes to suit my taste. I doubled all the marinade ingredients and added a large minced garlic clove and I marinated both the chicken and the zucchini together for about 5 to 6 hours. Served with rice that I doctored up with chopped green bell peppers, onions , garlic and canned tomatoes. Looked great and tasted even better. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was very good. I added minced fresh garlic (as suggested by some other reviewers), Tex Mex seasoning and Tajin to the marinade ingredients. This made the chicken very flavourful and tender. We really enjoyed the zucchini which I had never used before on kabobs. I make a lot of different types of kabobs and will start using zucchini more often. I served this with Tex Mex roasted potatoes, which is my own recipe and they went really well together.

Insanely good and fast summertime dinner. I marinated my chicken for probably 5 hours, and it was so moist and flavorful. We both inhaled these.

This didn't cut it.  The cumin, cilantro and lime didn't blend.  There are better Mexican grilled chicken recipes out there.  One more comment - who adds "salt and pepper to taste' to a marinade?  Specific measurements are better, as it's difficult to judge what the impact will be on the meat.

Very easy to make and had a great TexMex flavor while adding the great grill flavor. I used zucchini and squash, but would add some mushrooms next time.

It was OK.  Not very tasty. Kind of bland.

We have made this twice. It's our new go-to BBQ meal for the summer. So tangy and delicious . Quick and easy to make. I substituted with bottled lime juice and it turned out ok, but it was better with real lime juice!

WOW, great recipe. I did add minced garlic to the marinade because everything is better with garlic, otherwise exact. I also did chicken and beef- both were great. Skewered the addition of jalapeno chunks and a few garlic cloves- this would be hard to beat! Definitely a keeper, thanks CJ.

Easy and quick meal. I didn't have zucchini so I used different colored peppers and red onion. Delicious!

** EDIT ** I made this again over the weekend but didn't have time to marinate it more than 30 minutes and wow, a big difference.  This needs to be marinated.  This time the chicken cooked faster than most of the veggies so next time I'll cut the chicken chunks a little larger.  We still loved it!  **EDIT**      We really enjoyed this.  The taste of the lime was light and refreshing (I marinated it for about 6 hours.)  Toward the end of cooking, I wished I had more of the marinade for a sauce so I simply drizzled a small amount of olive oil and fresh lime on the kabobs once they were done (need to try adding some chilli powder as well)....scrumptuous!  I didn't think the cumin was overpowering; used 2 tsp of cilantro in place of the fresh; added mined garlic to the marinade as most suggested.  These were gone in no time!  Thanks for the post!

This recipe is delicious!  I followed the suggestion of previous reviewers and added fresh, minced garlic and marinated overnight.  Works great as a stir-fry, too.

Wonderful, fresh, and light flavoring. I made this exactly as written with the exception of using yellow summer squash (preference) and adding S&P and garlic powder to season the chicken pieces directly rather than the marinade. We had a simple salad to go with. Husband loved it, too.

These were okay, the marinade was too acidic for me. I added some Worcestershire sauce which mellowed it some. Next time I will reserve some marinade to brush on the veggies while cooking.

This was excellent - I only did have to marinate the chicken for an hour and it had excellent flavour.  I skipped the cherry tomatoes because I didn't have any.  We cooked minute rice to go with it, and layered the rice, salsa and the veggies and meat from the skewers into wraps like the suggestion.  Yum!!  This will be added to my faves/ regulars.

Really nice flavor and light for a summer meal.  I even ended up letting my veggies and chicken marinate for 48 hours and the lime flavor wasn't too strong. Will definately make this again.

Delicious. Next time I will add some minced garlic to the marinade for a bit more zing. This was a hit with the whole family.
