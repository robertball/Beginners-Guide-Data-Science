You would never know this was a light recipe, it was so good and very filling. It made a perfect St. Patrick's Day meal for the entire family. If anything, I would reduce the Thousand Island a bit. I could see how it could be overpowering. Instead of having to buy to separate loaves of bread I also used a dark/light rye swirl loaf. Delicious!
