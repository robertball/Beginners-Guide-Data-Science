I LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED it.  This is the kind of food that makes me really happy... it is thick, flavorful, a little spicy, and so easy to make.  I baked the tortillas just because I didn't have the patience to fry them in oil, and I served it heaped on a plate with a slice of cheddar cheese and an over-easy egg on top of the whole lot.  My hubby gave it 4.5 stars, taking half a star away just because he wanted more spice... considering he hates corn tortillas like he hates the flu, the meal must be pretty good.  For a morning or evening meant to be spent in sweats in front of the t.v, I couldn't ask for a better meal.  Hint: shredding rotisserie chicken is probably the way to go... it is always moist and yummy :-)

This recipes was great! The only substitution I made was with a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of the tomato sauce and it was delicious!

Great recipe for leftover baked chicken.  Instead of using the blender i just dumped everything in one pot, added fresh cilantro, black olives and a can of rotel lime/cilantro tomatoes. chips and mexican blend cheese on top. the gang loved it.

I did not like the flavor of this meal.  I'm not a huge fan of tomato sauce with chicken.  It also did not make very much - this was one serving each, for myself and 2 elementary aged kids.

I think it would've tasted much better with more mexican flavors in it...taco seasoning on the chicken and salsa instead of tomato sauce.

Really good! I used 1 cup regular tomato sauce and 1 cup of Mexican hot tomato sauce, which added a healthy dose of spice and flavor. Totally forgot to add the bouillon cube, but didn't miss it. Topped with a dollop of plain yogurt and lots of fresh cilantro. Very tasty, thank you! :)

When most people think of Chilaquiles, this isn't generally what comes to mind. Being accepting of the fact that it is different then what you may think Chilaquiles are supposed to be, you should be very happy with this recipe. I enjoyed it and I will make it again.

This was great! Followed the exact recipe (toasted the tortillas in the oven). By the way, some commenters are saying you "only" need 1 can of sauce. That's true...because 1 "normal size" can of tomato sauce IS the 2 cups called for!

This is how my sister-in-law from Mexico taught me except we use dried chile ancho and chile guajillo powder along with the chile serrano, and they make the sauce a lovely dark color.

This was a great recipe. I did tweek it being that my garden is overflowing with tomatoes. I cooked the onion, fresh tomatoes, and three jalapenos together until tender. Then added to the blender as suggested. I added a small can of tomato sauce, salt, pepper, and cumin. Blended until smooth. I also used left over chicken and pork fajita meat that I had. tossed it all in then pan and then added a small crushed up bag of store bought tortilla chips since I didn't have the corn. It turned out nice but husband said it needed more heat!
