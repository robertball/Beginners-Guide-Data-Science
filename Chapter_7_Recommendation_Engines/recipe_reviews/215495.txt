I changed the recipe to use up some Light egg nog that I had.  I heated the persimmon puree and then added the egg nog. I left out the honey. Very Good!

This recipe is better if you omit the honey and add the juice of one fresh lime.  I used a Tahitian lime from our garden, but lemon might work too if you don't have lime. Everyone loved it and said it  was amazing, including my daughter who does not like persimmon.
