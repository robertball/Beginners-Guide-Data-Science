This is a decadent cake! I did add about 3 times as many macadamia nuts as the recipe states and please don't serve it right away, it needs to sit for at least 2 days (covered) to absorb the wonderful rum, it is just like a fruitcake that needs time to age. I served it for Christmas desert and everybody raved over it.

This cake was a very big hit for Thanksgiving this year. However, I could not tollerate the rum... I thought it over powered the other ingredients. i think the cake would be wonderful without the rum! It doesnt need it at all.

This is a very good recipe. The cake is moist and delicious. Next time, I will add another 1/2 cup of macadamias for sure. I was pretty generous with the pineapple - I added a little more than 8 ounces. I baked this cake in a nonstick bundt pan. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

I made this for my parents who will be going to Hawaii soon.  It was really good and everyone enjoyed it.  I did not use rum.  While stirring the batter I was reminded of the smell of dump cake http://cake.allrecipes.com/az/DumpCake.asp   YUM!

Moist & delicious.  When I started I didn't realize my pudding pkg was only half the amount needed but it didn't seem to matter.  I cut back on the glaze because I was worried it would be to "rummy" for me & also wanted to reduce calories.  Changed butter for shortening.  Next time I would add more pineapple.

I made a few changes but this recipe was GREAT!...I recommend more pineapples...less rum. I added a cream cheese frosting with extra macadamia nuts on top.

Way too sweet! And this is coming from someone who loves sweet flavors. I added a bit less sugar than the recipe calls for and I still found it almost unbearably sweet. I'd suggest using maybe between 50-60% of the sugar listed in the recipe, both for enhanced flavor and a bit fewer calories. Other than that, the cake was nice and moist, but the macadamia and pineapple flavors did seem overpowered by the mighty sugar.

This cake is a winner! I made it for the weekend and now it's a family favorite I only had walnuts so I thought I would use maple syrup in my glaze and it blended nice with the rum glaze.

It was very easy and delicious. I doubled the recipe to fit into a 9x13 cake pan with carry lid to take to a dinner. I cut back a little on the sugar because I thought it would be too sweet, but next time I'll add the full amount. VERY moist!

This cake was really wonderful!! I only had pineapple run on hand. It turned out great! I agree that the cake needs to sit and mellow for a couple of days. It becomes more flavorful and even more moist. Thank you for a simple and great recipe.
