This recipe is outstanding! I have been making this for a couple of years now and always receive compliments from family and friends. Very simple recipe to follow and the results are "restaurant quality". This recipe blows away the local "Award-Winning Shrimp Bisque". I use the crawfish tail meat that you can get in the frozen seafood section at Walmart.

This is an excellent chowder.  Due to the exorbitant price of crawfish, I used two pounds of shrimp and to lighten up a little, we used the fat free half and half.  It took overnight in the frig for the flavors to completely meld.  This is definitely a keeper.

I doubled the cream cheese and corn, as a previous reviewer mentioned and used Old Bay Seasoning instead of cayenne. 

Also, I used one medium yellow onion, 5 small red potatoes (diced), fresh mushrooms, and 1 lb ground italian  sausage all fried separately in a pan (w/ butter if needed) and Old Bay Seasoning and added to the soup. Instead of using 2 lbs of crawfish, i used 1 lb. If using sausage, 1 lb is plenty! 

My husband said it was the best chowder he has ever had.  I agree!

I discovered this recipe on your web-site about 3 years ago.  I have made this dozens of times.  This is the most requested recipe I have ever had.  When asked what I should bring, this is the dish of choice.  The only thing I do differently, is that I double the amount of cream cheese and the corn.  I have made it exactly as the recipe shows and it's still REALLY GOOD.  Being from Louisiana, crawfish may be more attainble for me.  I have also made this dish with shrimp and crabmeat and it is still DELICIOUS.

I've made this twice now.  Both times this chowder received raves from my family and my friends.  I haven't changed the recipe a bit - I just doubled it because everyone goes back for seconds (and thirds).I'm from Louisiana so I am particular about my crawfish - this passed all my tests for a delicious use of Louisiana crawfish!  Thanks Tina!

I was very pleased with this recipe; however, I made a few substitutions  (Smart Balance for the butter, 98% fat free cream of mushroom, fat free cream cheese, fat free half & half), omissions (green onions), and additions (imitation crab meat, broccoli, and garlic powder).  I would definitely make this again, except I would add more half & half to increase creaminess.

This is absolutely the best crawfish chowder ever!  Everytime I make it I get rave reviews and everyone wants the recipe. I also add about 2 large red potatoes, parboiled and cut in small pieces + about 1/2 cup dry sherry at the end!  If you have a super Walmart nearby, you can get the crawfish meat, cleaned and packaged in 12oz packets.

With the exception of crawfish for crab, this is the exact same recipe for a crab corn chowder I got from a friend.  Spice it up with cayenne or Tabasco sauce.  It needs a kick to take it over the top!

Made this tonight, exactly as recipes is written. Everyone loved it. Even my 3 year old son. It is very rich, so I will try to make it again with lighter ingredients. Great recipe!!!!

This is incredibly delicious.  Everyone who has tried it has loved it.  It is so easy that I have already made it three times!  I've used creole seasoning rather than the cayenne the last two times, but either way it is terrific.

this a great!!  i'm not one to strictly follow a recipe (i mean really, no two women put on make up the same) BUT i followed this one pretty closely.  if you object to changes or or calorie conscious, read the next review.  for the rest of us cajuns, here's a simple tip:  sautee 1/2 a yellow onion and diced mushrooms along with the green onions.  add about 4 slices of finely chopped bacon to the soup mix, along with some crab meat and a generous helping of tony's (NOT OLD BAY).  so good...it'll make you wanna slap your mama!

My ex-boyfriend had been making this for me for a long time and it was one of the few things I was going to miss about him...until I made it myself for the first time! So easy and delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe says except I substituted Old Bay for the cayenne. I made it for my whole family the day after Thanksgiving and they loved it! Creamy and rich and very filling. Who needs the "ex"? Not me!
**EDIT: ** - I wrote my original review in 2010. It's now 2018 and I get so many requests to make this chowder - friends and family alike. It's very rich so I try to limit it to the holidays, but I end up making it on demand at least three times a year, in addition to the holidays. I now have the recipe memorized!

Good recipe, but almost too rich.  I added in about 1/3 cup of regular milk so it wouldn't be so thick.

Absolutely delicious soup and very easy to make.  Added extra corn and langostinos.  The langostinos made it so sweet and added an extra texture. There is one problem with this recipe, there are never any leftovers because it is so good!

This was so easy and delicious. I made several changes due to the ingredients I had on hand. I only used one lb of crawfish because they are so expensive around here and only used one stick of butter total and leeks instead of green onions. I added some Old Bay, garlic powder and white pepper and threw in some frozen hashbrowns to make up for the missing crawfish. This was excellent and I will most definitely be making this again! Thank you for sharing!

Delicious, quick, and rich! Excellent as is. We've also made it by substituting clams for the crawfish, adding one small regular onion and about a tablespoon of minced garlic sauteed in with the green onions plus about 4 oz. of smoked salmon. Yum!

I was given a rave review from a close friend when I made this for her.  I took the advise of other reviews and added doubled the cream cheese and corn, and added skinless smoked sausage.  I had frozen tail meat and used that. Wonderful stuff.

Yummy. I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it to the last drop. I simmered 1 pkg of frozen crawfish, 1 pkg imitation crab meat, 1/2 lb of Shrimp, and 1 pkg smoked sausage in butter and crab boil. I used Tony's for seasoning and doubled the corn and cream cheese as suggested by others. Very Good recipe!

This is a great base recipe, but when I made it exactly as written, it was way too thick and bland and didn't impart enough seafood flavor.  I'm not a fan of canned soup, but was surprised that it didn't taste too bad.  I've made this with both crawfish ands shrimp and both taste great. When I use shrimp, I use about 2.5 lbs. I remove about 1/3 of the cooked shrimp (chop them if they're big) and use a hand blender to slighty puree the chowder, leaving small chunks. I then add the reserved shrimp back to the soup. This makes a nice shrimp bisque. I also eliminate the cream of mushroom (since I think it has a artificial taste) and use all potato soup, 1 bottle of clam nectar, minced garlic, old-bay seasoning, 8 oz. of cream cheese and chives to garnish.  With your own additions and changes, this makes a restaurant worthy chowder.

This was a BIG hit. I would give this six stars if I could. I doubled the cream cheese like suggested by other members, and used cream of potato dry mix instead of the canned soups. I also added smoked sausage, and added bay seasoning along with the cayenne. I will definitely will be making this again. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!!

I don't have much to say about this soup that the other people haven't said.  It is amazing!!!  I could eat this soup every day of my life.  RUN RUN RUN to the grocery store, buy the ingredients, and make this.  You will not regret it.  Fab!!!  A couple of notes.. I did cut about half a stick of butter by sauteeing both together.  I just started with a little butter and continued to add as needed.  Keep the half and half.  I mean, if you are looking for a diet soup, this ain't it.  Embrace the calories and enjoy!

Wow.  This soup is SO easy and SO good.  Made two changes, I used crab meat and cream of celery for personal preference.  Try it tonight, can't wait for lunch leftovers!!!!

I am the worst cook ever.  I made this and it was so delicious!  I could not believe that it was made from canned soup.  I made it on Tuesday and am making it again on Thursday.  My daughter and 1 (she is 3) ate it all and now I am making some to keep in the fridge and so I can take it to my mom! The only thing I changed the second time was I added an extra can of corn, and an extra half cup of half and half, and extra onions.  I used crawfish and the crawfish tasted kinda fishy but on the next day it tasted less fishy and the next day when we finished it, it didn't taste fishy at all. HIGHLY RECCOMEND!

I had been getting rave reviews using another chowder recipe from this site, but this is my new favorite recipe.  It uses half the cream cheese and tastes even better!  LOVE IT!!!

This recipes is to die for, we have a local store that sells pre cooked cajun crawfish so I used them.  I just added them to the onions with the extra butter after the onions cooked and let them soak up some butter for a few mins while I got the rest of the recipe together.  Turned out great, going to try with clams next time... you must try this recipe...

This was pretty good.  It was a little bland though.  had to doctor it up with salt and pepper and garlic and Old Bay Seasoning.  probably would have been better the next day..

I found this recipe a few years ago and have been in love ever since. I live in the South, so we've only eaten fried or boiled crawfish. This is a great, hearty change of pace. Would love to try the other persons review and add some sausage and potatos. Thanks!!

Used shrimp instead of crawfish, didn't have cream of mushroom so I substituted with cream of celery, doubled the corn and cream cheese, added 2 cans of diced tomatoes, garlic powder, and slap ya mamma seasoning. It's so good you really could slap "ya Mamma"!

This is the best "any kind of seafood" chowder I have ever eaten, even in restaurants.  And all the simple ingredients make it even better. All I did was add extra seasoning & a dab of lemon juice.  Can't beat this for a large dinner party!

Having just returned from a trip to New Orleans,I have my reservations about a recipe where most of the ingredients we pre-prepared and/or canned. My wife and I were wonderfully surprised! Quick, easy and pretty close to authentic. This is a permanent do-over.

I used shrimp in place of crawfish, added 8 ounces sliced baby bella mushrooms and 5 large red potatoes diced and par-boiled, doubled the cream cheese (used low-fat), and only used 1/4 cup of butter (for green onions and mushrooms).  Sauteed shrimp in olive oil and white wine.  Was amazing!  Tasted even better the next day.  Great recipe to use for making weekday lunches in advance.

I must admit I really did not think this would taste to good, but WOW! This was amazing! Perfect amount of spices and taste. The only change I made was to add a tsp of minced garlic and Old Bay seasoning when cooking the crawfish. But my family are huge garlic lovers. This recipe is a definately a keeper!!!

This was phenomenal!  I made it with double cream cheese and reduced the amount of green onions a bit.  I could not have improved on it in any way!  Served with hot asiago cheese bread, this dish was total perfection.

Great-Great-Great!  Made this once and have already had 3 requests for the recipe and am making it again by request for son-in-law.  I was leary about a recipe that uses soup, but this is fantastic!  Tastes like the chowders we had at seafood restaurants in Florida.  Made the recipe as is, but did use double cream cheese and some reduced Sherry.  You cannot go wrong with this recipe - a real keeper!

Not only is this a great tasting chowder, it is super easy.  I made this yesterday and served it at dinner last night and it was a huge hit.  This will definitely go into my favorites and I will make it again and again.  Being from Louisiana, we have access to crawfish pretty much all year round.  Thanks for this recipe STKA

Very good! I used to get this at a creole cafe, and it went out of business... I freaked out and looked on here how to make it. This is just as good, but I add a couple of red potatoes, bacon, and about 3 times as much cayenne pepper. Oh and about 10 shakes of hot sauce.

I've made this a couple of times now, and have decided that my favorite version includes the following: (I generally make half the amount of the original recipe-- it still makes a large pot of rich and hearty soup!) saute a diced onion along with the green onions,  1 lb frozen langostino tails instead of crawfish, 1 can potato soup, 1 box of the condensed portabello mushroom soup from Trader Joes (a must!!), no corn, double the rec amt of cream cheese (full 4oz when making half the original recipe), a bit of Tony Chacheres Creole seasoning, pepper and a few small red potatoes.  I cut back the butter from the beginning and just use what's needed to saute the onions and langostinos, not a full 3/4 cup.  This isn't a light soup, but sometimes it hits the spot! I think it's better if it simmers longer than the recipes calls for, or even when warmed back up the next day.  Serve with fresh baked peasant style bread-- delicious!!

One of my faves.  I made some changes: Instead of canned soup I boil potatoes down until very mushy, add lots of Old Bay and I use shrimp and kielbasa.

Read reviews and thinned it with 1/3 more cream than caled for--swapped half the crawfish for shrimp and scallops.  Will serve in bread bowls next time.  Great meal!! Easy as heck to make.

This was so good. I doubled the corn and cream cheese, and ended up using old bay and cajun seasoning (next time I'll just use the cayenne). Very easy and absolutely delicious. I'll be making this again and again.

Incredibly tasty for such a simple dish. I did half Old Bay, half cayenne and it was just spicy enough.

Heavy and what can be fishy tasting anything usually scares me.  However, this was FANTASTIC.  It is a keeper.  The substitutions made were:  Added some Simply Potatoes-diced to onion; used both Old Bay and cayenne w/a dash of red pepper sauce. Us Texans like it hot! I also used the frozen crawfish tales (2 bags). I will make this again and again and again.  Thanks for the easy, YUMMY recipe.

My family and I loved it but with some minor changes.  I used lite cream cheese and fat free half and half because I don't really like things that are too rich.  I also used light butter.  I used Old Bay instead of cayenne and I doubled the amount of crawfish I used because I love crawfish.  It turned out really well!!!  I can't wait to make it again!

Rich, tasty, and delicious!  NOT a "light supper" soup. Holds up to a crusty piece of french bread!  Full belly and tons of leftovers!

Someone said to drain the crawfish--  I would NOT.  The liquid that comes with the frozen crawfish from Walmart adds IMMENSELY to the flavor and gives a delicate pink color. In terms of thickness, the last time I made this I actually used heavy cream (bad girl) instead of the half and half.  I mean, it's not diet food and it's a treat, so why not go all the way?  This chowder is probably the BEST thing I have ever eaten.  Truly!  I use the frozen crawfish tail meat from Walmart.  I use cream of shrimp soup instead of cream of mushroom, use a small Vidalia onion instead of the green onions, double the cream cheese, and leave out the corn.  Just minor personal preferences but whether you make this recipe as printed or tweak it to personal taste, it is simply unbelievably good.  If this were on a restaurant menu, I would be coming back regularly and probably never getting enough.  Being able to save money by making something so incredibly satisfying at home is absolutely thrilling.

I was surprised at how little prep there was involved in this recipe. I did not expect it to turn out as fabulous as it did but it was a huge hit in my family! We used prawns and basa fish and I'm sure any seafood would work in this chowder. We were impressed with the taste, ease and simplicity of this recipe... also used low fat everything that we could and it was plenty rich and thick. A keeper!

If I could give it 6 stars I would. This is such an easy and delicious chowder. Crawfish isn't in season right now so I used shrimp and threw in some hot sauce. I served it with the cheddar bay biscuits also on this site. They were a perfect compliment to the meal. My husband raved about this dish and even dicated the recipe to his siter in South Carolina so she could try it too. I can't wait for crawfish season now!!!

Excellent, excellent, excellent! I'm from New Orleans and luckily there is plenty of crawfish around all the time! This was a great, simple recipe which allows for easy modification if needed. You can't possibly mess this one up, I couldn't believe how easy it was : ) The husband loved it!

Better than you would think with the condensed soup base.  I usually try not to go that route but this is a good quickie comfort food that is great to serve on a cold day.

My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this chowder. I was unable to find crawfish in my neighborhood stores so I substituted crab meat. Other than that I didn't change a thing. Next time I make it, I will serve it in bread bowls. My boyfriend says it was better than anything he has had on the piers of San Francisco! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This was very good.  I used shrimp rather than crawfish and only used the recommended amount of cream cheese.  Some other reviewers mentioned they doubled it but I found the soup to be very thick and would have been even more so with the extra cream cheese.

Delicious! Tastes just like the chowder I used to order at the local cajun restaurant. I'm not the most experienced cook and this was pretty much fool-proof for a beginner like myself. When I make this again, I might try to add some more half and half, not because it was too thick but because the broth tasted so good I really found myself wanting more of it. It was a hit at my house and tasted even better the next day. Thanks!

I liked this, but it was a bit fishy for me, next time I will cut the crawfish in half and add a bit more corn and 3 or 4 diced and cooked potatoes.  On the other hand, my brother and my dad loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe. This is a fool proof recipe I have made it over a dozen times and it is always a big hit with everyone. I like to add a can od diced new potatoes, and serve with both shredded cheese and french bread. Also, you can substitute yellow onions for the green ones and I have also sub half and half for milk but my husband always notices and complains.

I thought this sounded like a terrific "welcome to autumn" meal and it did not dissapoint. I was unable to find crawfish, so I used lump crab meat and shrimp. While sauteing the green onions I also added come chopped carrots (for flavor and color). The chowder turned out fantastic and tasted great heated up the next day too! Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this chowder for a soupfest at my church.  I have been asked for the recipe from everyone who tasted it and others who just heard about it.  Everyone said it was the best chowder they had ever tasted.  I used imitation lobster and Old Bay seasoning in place of the cayenne.  I also doubled the recipe.  It was SO easy to make, as well.  Can't wait to experiment with other seafood in the recipe.

I used this years ago when I had a few pounds of leftover crawfish after a big boil.  I followed the recipe to the T and it was amazing.  Next time I saved some corn and potatoes from the boil and it was even better.  Because of the spices in the boil it really heated up the chowder.  Now I do crawfish boils just so I can have leftovers for the chowder.

We loved this recipe! I couldn't find crawfish so I used 2 lbs of shrimp. And I used 1 can of each: cream of potato, cream of mushroom and cream of shrimp. I love corn escpecially roasted. So I bought fresh frozen and pan roasted it in some olive oil until the corn has a nice browning color. So I probably added more corn than the recipe states. Lastly added 8 ounces of cream cheese since it comes 8 ounces to a package. I figured it wouldn't hurt with all that extra corn. Really fantastic recipe! Thank you

Made this in one pot and it was the best chowder my family has ever eaten. I had to use imitation crab due to not being able to find crawfish. It always make me laugh when people say even their picky kids eat and love things. In this case it was true!!!!

AMAZING. So good, and so easy. Recipe makes a large batch, too. I made a few changes--used shrimp instead of crawfish (only because of the expense. I would prefer crawfish but the shrimp was awesome too). Used only one can of potato soup, and two cans cream of mushroom. No cayenne pepper, and a few tablespoons Landry's garlic salt (really good brand of garlic salt, btw). Also, added about half a cup chopped red onion to the green onion sautee. EXCELLENT.

I suspect it would freeze well, but haven't tried it.

**Note: if you use frozen shrimp/crawfish like I did, either thaw it out thoroughly and pat dry or sautee it on low heat for 10 minutes and then drain it before you add it to the soup mixture. Otherwise you add too much water to your soup.

Very good.  I also used the frozen crawfish tails from Walmart.  I did find I needed to add some Old Bay and garlic powder.  Also added bit of salt.  I didn't have cream of mushroom so I subbed with cream of celery.  Used only 1/2 cup butter, but doubled the cream cheese.  Can't wait to try it tomorrow after it "melds" in the fridge overnight!

Tried this recipe and followed it by the book, was a lil bland and had a funny taste to me, at the same time I kept wanting to eat it lol! The next time around I did it my way and called it white gumbo. I used 8 oz. of cream cheese, 2 and a half cups of cream, 3 cloves of garlic, a few shakes of basil, thyme, & parsley , and 2 cans of corn along with the potato and mushroom soups. I also added sliced mushrooms, red potatoes, shrimp, and andouille sausage. I used tony's instead of cayenne pepper, and a shot of tobasco. I simmered it a lot longer than 25 minutes too. Came out better than ever!

A few small changes made this chowder a *HUGE* hit at my labor day party. I chopped up 5 whole potatoes, used 2 lbs of shrimp instead of crawfish, doubled the amount of cream cheese, and use 2 cans of cream of mushroom, 1 can of cream of celery, and 1 can of cream of asparagus. Great stuff!

We loved this! It was very easy to make with delicious results. I made a couple of changes - I used fat free Half&Half and was very pleased (1st time I ever used it), reduced the butter by half (3/4 c. seemed like far more butter than needed), and used reduced fat cream cheese.  Even with these healthy changes it was delicious!  I let it simmer for an hour, which I think made a huge difference in melding flavors. I also added a chopped, roasted poblano chile only because I had one. Very, very good!

Was very good and easy to make, but thicker than I would like.  I think I will try using equal parts milk and half/half next time.

My supermarket didn't have crawfish, so I substituted crab and shrimp instead. The beauty of this recipe is that you can pretty much throw in kind of seafood that you want. Definitely a favorite!

This was just delicious.  Very easy to make and easy to vary.  I used precooked shrimp and increased the cream cheese to 8 ounces (only did that because I didn't want to deal with leftover cream cheese in the fridge.)  Thank you for this fabulous recipe!

This is a great recipe!!! Who would believe canned soup could create such a delicious recipe. Our frozen crawfish comes precooked, so we skipped that step. A little extra cayenne and we were good to go. Thanks.

Loved this recipe.  It was so easy to make and absolutely delicious.  A real crowd pleaser.  I am actually considering the idea of making it as a topping for fresh broiled fish.  It's rich in taste, and I think will serve well as a broiled fish topping...possibly adding conch and/or scallops and shrimp.  I live in Florida and fresh fish is a necessity here.  Serving this recipe as such a topping could be a very impressive addition.  I highly recommend this one to anyone who is looking for an impressive chowder recipe to serve.  YUM!

i love this recipe! i fixed it for my husband & mother, and they both loved it.  it is easy and quick to fix, a plus for me in trying new dishes! i recommend it for anyone who likes chowder.  i have even thought about putting a different meat in it instead of crawfish to change it up and have it more often.  thanks for providing a great recipe!!

I had my Louisiana family in town and made this and everyone LOVED it, including my 1 and 2 year olds.  I did half cream and half milk, but other than that I did exactly the same.  What a yummy new way to use crawfish, coming from a Louisiana Girl....that is a HUGE compliment!  Thanks

I had never had crawfish before but this recipe sounded really interesting so I decided to give it a try. All I can saw is WOW. This recipe is so delicious, simple to make and my wife can never make enough of it. I am kinda wondering if imitation crab meat might be substitued for the crawfish.

My husband wasn't thrilled when he found out I was making this for dinner and told me he has never liked any chowder he's tried. He loved this so I give it 5 stars.  :)  I only used half the crawfish (frozen from Super Walmart - thanks to others who suggested looking there!) and it was plenty; enough to have some in every bite.  Two pounds would have been WAY too expensive.  Otherwise followed the recipe as-is.  I only wish it wasn't so high in fat or calories.

One word says it all...AWESOME. We could not find mud bugs so we substituted shrimp. We took others advice and doubled the cream cheese and corn. It was a little thick for us so we added additional half and half.

OMG THIS IS AMAZING!!! I have been looking for a restaurant quality recipe and had almost given up. This truly is what i was looking for! I went exactly by the recipe and the only thing i will change next time is a little less cayenne. It was pretty spicy, but i loved it. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Delicious! I doubled the cream cheese and did about 1 3/4 cups of half and half. My husband isn't a fan of crawfish so I used shrimp, clam meat, and baby scallops. I also had a shallot on hand so I chopped that and added it in with the green onions.

I wanted to do something with some of the fresh ingredients that I had access to and this was perfect. I substituted a pound of shrimp(since they were so large, I had to cut them so that they would cook through at the same rate as the crawfish) for the other pound of crawfish and used fresh crab meat. Here in Savannah, the cost of the fresh stuff is often less than that of the canned. My dad is a huge chowder fan and wasn't too keen on this when he saw the prep, but upon tasting it decided that the pot and it's contents belonged to him. It was a hit! I was worried about how it would reheat, but he'd said that the flavors were even better by day two. I'm allergic to mushrooms and sampled some beforehand. I'd like to try subbing the cream of mushroom with a cream of celery soup next time, though I don't know if it will lose that richness that mushrooms add. Any suggestions would be welcome.

This was so good, restaurant quality really. I did use Crab and Clams instead, because I didn't have crawfish. This was so good, people wouldn't wait until the soup was done to taste it. Thank you!

This was very good, however, at the time I originally made this, I couldn't find frozen crawfish tails so I resorted to shrimp and scallops. We both loved the recipe, regardless, and I plan to make it again (this time with crawfish)

I had doubts about putting cream cheese in a chowder, but it makes the best chowder.  I live on the east coast where prawns are hard to come by, so I added scallops, cod and shrimp to the chowder.  DELICIOUS!

I've never made chowder, but this one is unbelievable. It was only 8:30 am but I just had to have a bowl. Not for anyone watching their fat intake, though. I would definitely use low-fat versions of the cream cheese, half and half and soups (but never fake butter!)

This was fantastic! I followed the recipe excatly and made the following changes. I used 1/2 imitation crab (chopped) and 1/2 shrimp instead of crawfish. I added 3 oz sherry at the end of the recipe which I reduced in seperate pan before adding to the chowder. I've had several requests for this recipe. It was a hit at a potluck during Lent.

We substitute crawfish with haddock, scallops, and shrimp. We also only use 1/4c butter for the whole recipe and use milk for one cup of the half and half to cut some of the fat containt.  Family favorite for sure.

I followed the recipe exactly except for swapping out the crawfish for shrimp and it was excellent!  Not too overpowering, which I like in a chowder.

On the one hand, I'm not sure I'm qualified to rate this recipe but on the other hand, I can rate it based on it's ability to allow for substitutions.  Based on what I had on hand, I subbed shrimp and scallops for the crawfish.  I used Cream of Celery in place of the Cream of Potato and added 2 diced potatoes and Old Bay.  It was really good!!  I love a good recipe.  I REALLY LOVE a recipe that is still good even when you make due with ingredients on hand.  Yummy and perfect for the first snowy night all year (finally!).

This is a very good recipe. Instead of crawfish, as they can be hard to find sometimes, I used a mixture of shrimp and crab meat. It makes a very creamy, tasty chowder.

This is a great start to an awesome chowder but here is what I did different; first I don't use crawfish, I use crabmeat (sometimes imitation), and cooked shrimp. I also add tilapia or some other white fish that has been grilled or broiled.  I add all the seafood at the end and let "meld" together for about 5 minutes.  I also use cream of crab or cream of lobster instead of the cream of mushroom.  I use 8 oz. of cream cheese instead of 4.  This is awesome!  Everyone asks me for the recipe.

The best part of the recipe... it comes together in an instant!!!  Truly a wonderful, wonderful method.  I turned this recipe into a seafood chowder by adding shrimp, tilapia and crawfish.  Didn't want to use so much half and half, so I only used 0.5 cup.  The remaining 2.5 C... I just used rice milk.  Added paprika, b/c it seemed like it needed it, and red and green onions for some add'l depth of flavor. To save on a few cals I used Neufchatel cheese rather than regular cream cheese, cut the butter to 3 T.

UNBELIEVEABLE!!  I was leary of all the cream soups in it-BUT A+++++!!! Thanks so much!! Edit**I have made this countless times since I first reviewed it & have made it better & better each time! I only use 1/4 cup of butter for the whole recipe-when I saute the green onions I add mince red pepper & chopped fresh mushrooms & also garlic powder, fresh parsley, Old Bay, & cayenne.  I prepare the "soup" base as directed, but double the cream cheese, use 1 pint of half & half & about 2-3 cups of skim milk. I have used a variety of seafood in it & we have found that we like a lb of shrimp & 2 lbs of snow crab meat the best.  This recipe is soooooo good!!  I really cant thank you enough for posting it!!

Loved this recipe. I used 1 pound spicy sausage and 1 pound of shrimp, old bay seasoning, and some spicy cajun seasoning. Also cooked the crumbled sausage with the chopped green onions and two cloves of garlic, then added the shrimp and seasoning. Boiled the other ingredients and tossed everything in the skillet into the pot, stirred, seasoned and served. Slap yo mama!

Very yummy. I used the entire block of cream cheese and 2 cans of Shoepeg corn and 2 packs of the frozen crawfish tails. Added a lot of Tony's Chacheries (sp) for kick. Will add chopped potatoes next time.

Great base recipe that you can really change up! I made this healthier, using 98% fat-free mushroom soup, white chicken breast meat instead of seafood, skipped the cream cheese and just used milk. I added 1 Tablespoon of flour to thicken and it was WONDERFUL!

I've made this a million times. Recipe is great as is. I now wing it. Base is same but I add another 8 oz cream cheese. Did that on accident once and we loved the added creaminess. I cut the butter way down and use far more scallion and cayenne as we like heat. I also use fat free cream cheeses and half and half.

This is excellent! I was looking for a recipe that would come close to a crawfish bisque served in a popular Cajun restaurant and this is IT. Warmly received by everyone I've made it for and that's been a lot of folks! Easy to sub crab or shrimp or combo of the two...

This was quite nice.  I live in the UK and couldn't find plain potato soup so I used potato and leek soup.  Also, you can find crawfish here fairly easy as well, which is nice.

This was amazing.  My boyfriend who is somewhat of a chowder connoisseur absolutely loved this.  We live on the Oregon coast so he’s tried many different kinds of chowder at all of the finest restaurants but he says hands down this was the best he has ever had!  Our market didn’t have crawfish so I had to use scallops which meant I didn’t try it, but it smelt wonderful.  I will defiantly make this again, and again, and again.

This was wonderful!  I made during Christmas for my family and they devoured it.  The only additions that I made was to add shrimp, lump crab meat and a little garlic powder.  It was the talk of the dinner table!

AWESOME!  My finance doesn't usually eat anything that contains crawfish, but he ended up finishing off the chowder!  The only thing I did a little different was use 2 cans of corn, and I add a little garlic powder to the crawfish before I sauted them!

This is great, family and friends all love it.  We use only 1 pound of crawfish and it's plenty. Add a little milk if it gets too thick.

This is so GOOD! I only changed a few things, added 6 medium- semi cooked potatos, Old Bay seasoning. And our local store has packaged "Seafood Medley" (mussels, shrimp, scallops, squid, fish) That I used in place of crawfish. The Chowder was amazing.  Make this, you will not be disappointed.  Just had this 3 days ago, and  Darling Hubby is requesting it again.

Obviously amazing as that's what everyone has said and its oh so true! I added potatoes and three links mild Italian sausage. I really forgot to add any seasoning at all and it was still unbelievable.

My cooking skills are EXTREMELY limited. I had leftovers from a crawfish boil I went to and used them to make this chowder and it was amazing. Everybody who tasted it told me how impressed they were. I didn't change anything except I added more cayenne

I made this as written except I doubled the cream cheese per the advice of other reviewers. It was AWESOME! The only thing I would suggest is maybe reducing the half and half because it was a tiny bit watery in my opinion, but I still rate it 5 stars. I brought it to a party and everyone wanted the recipe. I am not a great cook but this was easy and even I didn't mess it up! I will be making it again and again.

It is a snowy night in Brooklyn and I was in the mood to make a chowder, for the first time.  This recipe was great but I made a couple of modifications:  first, instead of crawfish I used about 2lbs of shrimp, I added them in at the end during the low boil.  I omitted the extra 1/2 pound of butter and used a frozen 16oz package of corn instead of the can of corn that the recipe called for.  Finally, I seasonsed the chowder with freshly ground black pepper and Old Bay seafood seasoning.  Would make this chowder again!

I give it a 4 only because I added turkey sausage as suggested, but I didn't like it. I also didn't have 2 cans of cream of potato, so I increased the half and half by one cup and added more cream cheese. I took the sausage out of it, and after letting it sit in the fridge over night, it was pretty tasty! I added Old Bay as well, thought it was a nice touch--I think it was a little too fishy for my hubby, he didn't really like it at all.

Seriously! Wow!! Very few changes. Added some fresh potatoe (1 baker pealed, chopped, cooked) Used the frozen Walmart Crawfish. Cut back on the butter. Used FF half & half, added extra cream cheese. This was so yummy! Even my 2 yo was dipping bread in it. Is a keeper!

This came out sssoooo good!! I doubled the 1/2 and 1/2 and doubled the cream cheese just to make it a little thinner and creamy. I also added louisiana hot sauce and tony's to the crawfish while cookin them. I also added mushrooms with the green onions when I cooked them. Served it with cornbread and everyone devoured it!!

I made this with chopped shrimp instead of crawfish, since I had the shrimp already. Comes out wonderfully rich and creamy. Only downside- not exactly healthy, but worth the indulgence every once in a while!

This recipe was very good.  The only thing I changed about it was I added a bit of garlic powder and seasoned it with Paul Prudhomme's Seafood Seasoning and also added shrimp.  The whole family loved it... even my two year old!!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated.  This was very good.  Will probably make again.  I ate with French bread. Easy to prepare.

I absolutely love this recipe. 

I give it a Southern twist by adding:
1/2 cap of  liquid seafood boil
1 t Tony's seasoning
1 t Onion Powder
1 pkg frozen 60/80 shrimp
AND
1 pkg frozen crawfish tails

You can taste the love in every bite.
Thanks to the original poster of this recipe for the inspiration!

This recipe, in my humble opinion, is more of a starting off point.  I read a lot of reviews and added some things mentioned.  Fried some bacon and crumbled into it, sautéed shallots and mushroom along with the green onions, boiled some baby Yukon gold potatoes, half shrimp with the crawfish, I’m in Louisiana and crawfish is very expensive right now.  I also seasoned a lot more, us Louisiana people like a lot of seasoning. So I added minced garlic, bay leaf, parsley, paprika, thyme when I added the cayenne.  Fried some pistolettes for the bread.  It was phenomenal. My family tore it up, so definitely going into the recipe box!

I have lived in Louisiana all my life and in the Lafayette, La. area for over 30 years and never saw a crawfish chowder.  If you live in an area where crawfish, crabs, oysters and catfish are favorite foods, you have to be open to new dishes.  Bring it on!

This was amazing and SO easy to make! We had it for an appetizer at Christmas dinner last night and every single person LOVED it! We could not find crawfish anywhere around here, so we bought a few lobster tails and sautéed the lobster meat instead. 
Thank you for the recipe...will be my new go to homemade chowder!

I use everything in the recipe. I only added Cajun seasoning. After making this recipe umpteen times I've discovered that just sautéing the crawfish first then adding in all other ingredients, except green onions, is the way to go. It pretty much just goes in the pot all at the same time, except the crawfish.  Very easy AND tasty recipe. Add the green onions at serving time.

This recipe is a winner with our family. I don’t like a lot of potato pieces in a chowder and this one uses cream of potato soup. Khorr makes a dehydrated one that worked perfectly. I used two per cent milk and the result was still smooth and rich. I also used PEI mussels instead of crawfish and I have been asked to make it again for Christmas Eve.

I did make changes simply because  I used what was on hand. I had shrimp and they worked fine. My wife does not like mushroom soup so I used a can of cream corn. I have made this 4 times and plan to make Sunday (by request). I think this would be great as given and my changes did not mess it up, it is still very good. Thanks for posting.

A very simple and delicious recipe that we make regularly. However, I substituted 2% milk for half and half because half and half makes it too rich. Also, we used shrimp. Thank you for the recipe.

I just made this chowder.  It was truly amazing.  This time I didn't make any changes, but in the ingredients, it mentioned 2 pounds of frozen crawfish cleaned. Did you mean whole crawfish or just the tails? I used 3- 12 Oz packages of the frozen tails.

The next time I make this, I am going to increase the green onions to the whole bunch and add a rib of celery sliced thin.

Thanks for the great recipe.

I substituted cajun spice for the cayenne.  I added 1/2 c. water and used milk and 1/2 &1/2.  I substituted reg. onion for green onion. I subbed shrimp for crawfish and sauteed hot Italian sausage on the side for those who want to add it in.

I don't use crawfish.  I change it up each time.  Sometimes clams, sometimes shrimp.  Sometimes just ham and potato.  But it's delicious each time.  Everyone I have made it for loves it.  It's a wonderful base recipe and add whatever protein you wish to.

The best chowder ever! I have not tasted anything this good in restaurants. To be able to make this at home is amazing. This can be made with other seafoods; half crawfish, half scallops or shrimp. I always make a double batch.

I made this last night and it turned out awesome! my husband knows good Cajun food being from Louisiana and he is picky about seasoning so he assisted in the preparation. After I sautéed the green onions I cooked 2 pkg of 12 Oz tails in butter then added to green onions in a bowl. we then dashed old bay seasoning in the onions and tails and coated it  while the soups and corn simmered. I doubled the soup and corn to this recipe just so we could have extra. I added 8 Oz of cream cheese to the soup mix along with the seasoned onions/crawfish and let it all mix together. I realized I never added the half and half but it was very thick without it and the cream cheese I think gives it the "chowder" consistency anyway. I turned out perfect and had just the amount of "kick" without it being too hot. I think the key to it is mix in the amount of seasoning you desire to the onions and crawfish BEFORE you add it in the soup mix. I will definitely be making this again!

Glorious recipe.  Best with leftover crawfish from a boil, but if you have to use frozen, try sprinkling a little crawfish boil seasoning on them and simmer a bit longer. Takes away that frozen crawfish taste. :)

I made this recipe for dinner tonight with the leftover crawfish tails that we had from a boil over the weekend. This recipe is delicious.  I will most likely use it every time we have leftover crawfish.  I read the other reviews and decided to do as suggested and double the corn and the cream cheese.  I followed the recipe exactly in everything else.

I added the golden trio: chopped onion, bell pepper, and celery. Cooked that down before I put the soups in the pot. Added more to the flavor!! Great recipe and perfect for a cold day.

Very good recipe, I gave 4/5 stars because it was just too rich and unhealthy for my taste but the texture and flavor was great. I used spicy chicken sausage instead of the crawfish and added roasted  jalapeños. Next time I will substitute low fat cream cheese/sour cream for the cheese and use milk instead of half and half

Wonderful!!!!  This recipe was easy to follow and has an absolutely wonderful flavor!  My neighbor made this and shared with our family Christmas Eve.  My children, ages 10, 15, & 17 (who can be quite picky) ALL enjoyed the chowder! I made it for New Years and will be making it again and again for sure!  I bought my crawfish at Kroger in the frozen meat dept. since they are out of season right now.  I also didn't have Cayenne Pepper so I just used some season all and black pepper and it was great!

very good recipe, i used 2 bags of frozen crawfish tails from walmart, and doubled up cream cheese and corn and added 10 slices of bacon in the end. cooked all of this in slow cooker, but prepped the same way

The basic idea of the recipe is great.  It is so much better though to make the creamy base with a roux and cream/Half & Half as opposed to canned soup (aarrrrrgh!).  I also found that adding some fresh (your choice of type) mushrooms gives it a great little subtle twist.

Thought this was amazing. Unfortunately I wasn't able to use crawfish because they're too expensive here, but shrimp was an excellent replacement. It comes out even better if you can use potato and mushroom soup made from scratch.

Using this recipe with left over seafood boil makes it some much better.  As is, the result is great too!

Gotta say, this one is a winner! So easy!! I had 10lbs of Cajun seasoned crawfish leftover. After the ridiculously long job of getting the tail meat out, I chopped them a bit and added it to the green onions  plus 2 diced potatoes and 2 cans of corn. I also accidentally used 8oz of cream cheese so I added some of Franks Hot Sauce and a jar of diced green chilis in with the soups. It was a bit thick so in went about 1/2 cup of stock. Salt, pepper and some Essence gave it the final punch. Yummy! I have decided though that I'm not big fan of crawfish, so I'll try this again with shrimp.

This was a great base recipe, I did change it up and added some other ingredients. I excluded the green onions, used fresh crawfish (just because they're easily accessible in my area), added cooked shrimp and sausage, used the whole brick of cream cheese plus the half and half for extra creaminess. And I used a little more cayenne, but that was just because of taste. Everything else was the same as the recipe! Thanks for a great idea!

I used leftover shrimp and lobster meat instead of crawfish, and the soup was a big hit.  Thanks for the easy recipe.

Made this for company recently as we did a seafood smorgasborg.(walley/perch/grilled salmon/etc...)Everyone enjoyed this chowder tremendously.We also added small shrimp to go with the crayfish.Only altered the recipe by adding Old Bay instead of cayenne pepper.THANKS!
