This simple and delicious  marinade is great! I used a little extra garlic and pepper to taste and added 1tsp sesame seeds too. I combined my spices with the oil to  marinade instead of applying separately. It was a hit at Easter dinner and the recipe was asked for;)

This turned out really good. I thought the lime seemed a little odd but it worked perfectly. This had the perfect amount of heat and salt. I did add some dill because I typically always do with salmon. It definitely bumped the flavor up some but I don't think it was completely necessary either. This is one I will definitely make again.
