Crowd pleaser! I took a whole pan to a cookout and brought it home empty:) I loved it because it was so easy, they loved it because it was equally delicious. I took the suggestion of topping it with crushed butterfingers instead of pecans....mmmmmm!

It went fast at the cookout I brought it to! The hot fudge sauce doesn't pour very easily, and so the final layer didn't spread very well.  I covered it with foil and the entire top layer stuck to the foil!  *Fortunately*  I had decided to put the top layer of whipped topping on right before serving.  So I scraped all the fudge and caramel off the foil, spread it in an unattractive layer on top,  then covered it all with whipped cream, and then red-white-and-blue sprinkles for Memorial Day!  Huge hit.

Kids love this! It's less sinful with Skinny Cow ice cream bars, fat free cool whip, and low fat chocolate fudge sauce. Butterfinger or whatever decadent bar on top, of course!

Fantastic dessert! Found this and needed a dessert (hostessing a family reunion followed by  Bunco at my house on consecutive weeks). For the reunion, used a whole jar of the hot fudge sauce on each layer after reading other comments and it worked well. Also took the idea of nuking the sauce for 30 seconds to make the spreading easier. Layered ice cream sandwiches, fudge sauce, Cool Whip and repeated the layers.

For Bunco, a layer of ice cream sandwiches, caramel topping, Heath Bar bits, Cool Whip, ice cream sandwiches, fudge topping, Cool Whip. A hit, again.

The best part was that Friendly ice cream novelties were on sale at a local store-buy 2, get 3 free. The following week, Smucker's toppings were a sale item-buy 2, get 1 free. Talk about a delicious, cost effective dessert-I scored!

This dessert was so simple and so yummy! Instead of the whipped topping in between, I used a Mocha Almond Fudge ice cream :D Next time I'm going to try a Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream. The possibilities are endless with this :)

It can't be a sin because I got the recipe from watching the Dugger girls do it!!  If "cake" has been in freezer overnight, take it out about 20 minutes prior to serving so it isn't rock hard.  We love dry roasted peanuts as a garnish but nuts are a "self-serve".  Haven't served it to anyone that didn't at least think about having seconds!!  Excellent dessert for any occasion.

Great and easy recipe! I modified it just a little. Instead of all vanilla ice cream sandwiches, I used mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwiches. And on the top, I added mini York peppermint patties. It was fabulous! I will be using this one again.

Super easy to make. I did make a few adjustments. I added chocolate pudding mix to cool whip and did one layer of sandwiches next chocolate pudding cool whip then fudge and caramel. I did plain cool whip for the top and crushed Oreo on top because no one will eat nuts.

Klondike bars instead of ice cream sandwiches takes this over the top. Cookies and cream was ridiculous but pick your favorite. Make sure there is something salty and crunchy in between the layers and it will be requested constantly.

O!M!G!  Made this for a pot luck at work in January.  People went crazy for it.  We had another pot luck last week and I was going to make something different, but was told I HAVE TO make this again.  I have to make 2 so everyone can have some.

This was great!  I read the other reviews and made the following changes:  I started with a layer of ice cream sandwiches, smoothed over a layer of whip cream, then added a layer of homemade caramel ice cream topping.  Next put another layer of ice cream sandwiches, & another layer of whip cream.  I then froze it for about 6 hours.  I didn't cover it, as another person suggested, so the whip cream didn't stick to anything.  Meanwhile, I made a recipe of homemade hot fudge ice cream topping & set aside.   For serving, I took the ice cream sandwich cake out of the freezer about 15 minutes before cutting into it.  I placed individual servings on plates & poured on the warmed homemade fudge topping over each serving.   I let everyone dress their own serving with whatever toppings they wanted: Skor bar crumbles (smashed chocolate bars), Reese's peanut butter bar (also smashed into crumbles), honey roasted peanuts & pecan pieces.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

I made this for a group of 8 adults and 4 children ( ages 6-10 ).  I had so hoped it would be enjoyed by all, but 3 of the children politely declined dessert.  My son-in-law, who is normally not a dessert person, loved it!  The other adults ate it, but left portions on their plates.  I personally found it to be too rich and sweet.

I made this for my mom for mothers day, she loved it. I halved the recipe and fit it in an 8x8 baking dish. I did not top with nuts or any other candy, just the toppings were perfect for us. I'd love to try it with peanuts in the future and try and rip off a DQ Peanut Buster Parfait though :) Thanks so much for sharing.

I made it using 1 container of Magic Shell fudge topping instead of hot fudge -- much easier and the shell works as a "glue" to hold everything together.  It tastes great and was definitely a crowd pleaser.  So easy that my 8 year old can make it without assistance!

This was a huge hit for my 9 year olds birthday. My husband said it was the best cake he has ever had! my sister said she wants this for her bday but with Reese's peanut butter cups- made this one with crushed butterfingers on top.  I have to say this is one of the easiest desserts I have ever made!

You can't mess this up. Crushed Oreo cookies and/or crushed pretzels, Heath bar pieces, peanut brittle...etc.

I make this in disposable loaf pans. This recipe makes two. Save a couple in my freezer to bring to new neighbors or ailing friends.  No need to be in a hurry to eat it!

July 28, 2015 - This was a hit!!! I made this over the week-end & took it to a neighbors cook-out.  I changed it up a bit.  I started w/the Ice cream sandwiches & once I thawed out the COOL WHIP, I added a package of Instant vanilla pudding(powder)to the COOL WHIP. Which I layered on top of the Sandwiches. Next I poured on the choc sauce (need to MW for about 45-60 SEC)then I crushed NUTTER BUTTER cookies & sprinkled them on-top of the choc sauce, then repeated w/the sandwiches, choc sauce, etc.  As previous reviews indicated, I put this in the freezer before adding the last layer of COOL WHIP.  Froze over night & added the last of the COOL WHIP & drizzled caramel sauce on-top of that.  This recipe makes a 9" x 13" pan & will serve approx 20 ~ 24 ppl.  This was actually too much, as we were only 4 ppl.  I left some w/neighbor & still had half of the pan for next weeks family dinner. Will make again & switch out the NUTTER BUTTERS for Oreos or other cookies/candies. 5 Stars

Easiest recipes ever and absolutely fantastic. This is a huge hit with people of all ages! Since I love to serve this where there are kids, I don't add pecans or nuts.

I took this to a summer picnic and it was a big hit!  I did not add the nuts as a topping, just in case someone might have a sensitivity to them.  Next time I will add colored sprinkles to make it look even more festive.

Made a half recipe in an 8x8.  Mix whip topping with one package pudding mix (vanilla or chocolate), saving some plain whip topping to frost top after freezing (also fudge sauce to drizzle when serving).   Will try with a layer of melted peanut butter and also with magic shell and oreos.  Yum!  Use parchment to line the pan, and either don't cover it in the freezer or use toothpicks to keep the foil off the top so it doesn't stick.  Set up a topping bar with hot fudge, peanuts, pecans, crushed oreos or nutter butters, ...

This is the easiest and fastest dessert I've ever made.  Guests seemed to love it.  I'm not a fan of cool whip and wonder if someone could recommend a viable alternative.  Perhaps real whipped cream stabilized with gelatin...? I'd hate to waste the $15 or so on ingredients and have it not work. Thanks!

This was great and so easy! I added peanut butter (partially melted) to the middle layer as well and then chopped Reese peanut butter cups on top instead of nuts. Will make again for other occasions!

One of my lifelong favorites, but with these changes: Use only 12 oz. of whipped topping. Use more pecans, 1 1/2 c., TOASTED, for great flavor. Hint: Don't layer the hot fudge; save it to heat later (microwave in jar) & drizzle over servings.

This was fantastic, I made it for a birthday and everyone raved . about it.  You can customize it and use any filling you want - hot fudge, caramel, candies, butterscotch, nuts or fruit.  Absolutely easy and yummy!

Wow!  Easy and tasty as written I'm sure.
My changes:  only 16 ice cream sandwiches;  only 1 container of cool whip mixed with one small pkg of chocolate instant pudding and 1 cup of milk.  I "iced" the sides of the cake as well.  Excellent!  As noted by previous reviewer, take out of freezer about 20 minutes before serving.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit. The first time I made it exactly as the recipe reads. After, I realized it was easy to change it up by using hot fudge versus chocolate, caramel versus butterscotch, syrup vs hard shell, etc. Use your favorites and it seems to always turn out wonderfully!

This comes up as a request now all the time. So simple, so delicious. I have made this exactly as prescribed, which is perfect. If you would like to amp it up like I do, make your own whipped cream with heavy cream,  powdered sugar and a little kahlua. Really takes it to the next level.

Halved the recipe and made it twice.  All I can say is my son's first words were "OH MY GOSH - THIS IS SO GOOD"!!!  Easy to make - will definitely do it again.  Tip - - if frozen longer than an hour, it's easier to serve - I made it the day before.  UPDATE:  I've now made this multiple times when taking dinner to friends for  various reasons - they can't get enough of it and now one family asks for it as their birthday cake(s)!

I made this when my kids and grandkids came over.  The older kids loved it just as much as the grandkids! My 13 year old grandson has requested I make this for his birthday party. Sometimes I only do one layer vs the two. Either way it is always a hit.

Everyone loves this! and they always are amazed that its so simple to make. I find it easier to spread the chocolate fudge directly on the ice cream sandwiches followed by caramel then the whip topping. If you have tried making this then you know its impossible to spread anything on top of whipped topping. Also you don't really want to be heating up the fudge because it melts the ice cream fast. So many variations for this recipe but awesome as is

This was amazing!  Instead of pecans, I toasted about 1/2 cup of slivered almonds (put in the toaster oven on the broil setting   about 3 minutes) and sprinkled the almonds between both layers.  I made it the day of our party, placed it in the freezer without the foil on top, then 3 hours later took it out and sliced it with a knife into large squares.  It was fabulous and got rave reviews from my guests.

Made for church luncheon. Folks LOVED it. I used instant chocolate pudding in the cool whip for the middle layer and regular ice-cream sandwiches for the first and third layer. Regular cool whip for the final topping along with the drizzled caramel, hot fudge sauce and peanuts. Once sliced, the layers looked fantastic with the chocolate cool whip layer in the middle. Also, I froze it without covering it, to avoid all the toppings from sticking. When I served it, I filled a large pan with ice and placed the dessert pan on top. It kept really well on the serving table.

I use real whipped cream, blueberries and walnuts on top.  My favorite ice cream is dark cherry vanilla.  You can fit anyone's favorite ingredients in the versatile and delicious recipe.  I first heard it two years ago on public radio.

I used Klondike Ice Cream Sandwiches, they are a little bigger and fatter so you don't need as many ( you can cut in halves to fill the gaps).... I used Smucker's Salted Caramel.. Was yummy... I bought two Heath Bars and put in ziplock bag and broke into little pieces for the top...easy recipe and delicious!!!

This was AMAZING! I made it for my hubby's birthday because he requested an ice cream cake. It was so easy to put together. I used chopped up peanut butter cups in place of the pecans because that's his favorite candy. I would have preferred the pecans, but it wasn't MY birthday! hehe :)

Absolutely FANTASTIC recipe for a birthday cake.  I substituted  two - six packs of the smaller (almost) bite size Butterfingers candy bars (six to a pack) and froze them before smashing them in the wrappers inside the six-pack wrapping frozen to mash them up for the recipe.  I REALLY recommend this for any kind of celebration in addition to a birthday.  It is excellent!!!

Huge hit at bbq. So easy to make. I put hot fudge & caramel sauce on the ice cream sandwhiches then put the cool whip on.

For me, since I usually make everything from scratch, this was an expensive dessert to make considering the purchase of the ice cream bars, the cream, the peanuts, the hot fudge and caramel sauces.  And after all that, it wasn't that good.   And it really needs to be frozen overnight--30 minutes is ridiculous.  I would much rather have an ice cream sundae, hands down.  I
will not make this again.

It was an easy to make dessert for the summer. I didn’t want to turn on the oven. I didn’t use the full amount of the hot fudge or the caramel, and I used dry roasted peanuts on top. I used the extra creamy cool whip, which I think is better than regular cool whip. Got compliments on the dessert. Would make again.

I’m not much of a baker and prefer to just  assemble desserts so this was a perfect recipe for me - and it didn’t disappoint! In fact, it was shockingly delicious. I used a combination of traditional vanilla and caramel ice cream sandwiches, less whipped topping than called for, replaced the hot fudge with a drizzle of  plain chocolate syrup and caramel sauce, and topped with chopped honey roasted peanuts instead of pecans -  it was delicious.  The most time consuming part was unwrapping the ice cream sandwiches. So good!!

So easy, a total crowd pleaser! Did one layer of sandwiches, followed by a layer of almond mocha ice cream, topped with cool whip and a crispy crunch bar. Will be my ‘go to’ for all pot lucks !

This recipe was very easy to make and looked delicious after the final product! Took it to a dinner party and everybody thoroughly enjoyed it! I left out the peanuts and used crushed butterfingers.  I will definitely be making this again!

My folks loved this!! I liked that it only took a few ingredients and just a few minutes to assemble?? you definitely want to have a fairly deep dish and also it sure helps to soften the hot fudge sauce in the microwave before applying.

Dessert doesn't get much easier than this!  Get creative with toppings - don't worry about following the recipe exactly.  Make sure to warm up the hot fudge and caramel so they drizzle on the whipped cream nicely.  I thought a full bottle of two toppings were a bit much - just add to taste.  Enjoy!

Although, it looked great, I just wasn't crazy about this. I used store brand ice-cream sandwiches. Perhaps if I had used a more premium ice-cream brand, it would have tasted better. I may try again with a premium ice-cream.

While this is a tasty dessert, it is pricey to make even when items are on sale.  I chose walnuts simply because I already had and was not going to spend more money.

I actually made this for my "Grands" to enjoy but the grownups ended up eating just as much as the kids.  I left out the pecans and use toffee bits.   Really rich......delicious.....for a quick dessert.

We made this for our church kids camp family night and OH my, my!!! It was a hit to say the least. The only thing we did different was left off the nuts (due to a child with allergies). Definitely a dessert that I will make again!!

Oh my gosh, to die for and ridiculously easy!  I almost felt guilty making such a simple dessert but glad I did!  I didn't think it would actually fit in a 9x13 but it did--barely.  Don't pass this one up, and don't think about the calories.  I used peanuts and swore it tasted like frozen snickers bars.  yummmm

YUM!  Will definitely make it again!   I omitted pecans but added chopped salted peanuts and chopped Mr. Big chocolate bar to the middle layer and on top.  I also added a box of chocolate pudding mix to the middle cool whip layer (as per another review) which added a different layer visually when the cake was cut.  It was a huge hit for my son's 9th birthday.  I took it out 20+ minutes before serving which made it manageable to slice.

It was a very, very hot saturday afternoon. We needed a coooool desert. It was easy to make and was a big hit. The best comment was.... you got G. To eat dessert. That is amaising. We all can hardly wait to make it again!

I've made this several times.  It's easy and quick and good!  (I only make 1 layer, though).  Great for summer when it's too hot to cook!

This is a super easy and much loved summertime dessert in our family.  Quality of ingredients does make a difference.  Love that it can easily be modified to please your group such as omitting nuts, adding or omitting suace(s).

Used banana split ice cream sandwiches (WalMart brand) instead of regular ones for more flavor with my friend and her nieces and we all loved it. Gets a bit messy, especially with taking off the wrappers of melting ice cream sandwiches but it's certainly a pleaser for all ages!

Great dessert that tastes like you worked all day on it! Although, I did make a few changes. I added Magic Shell, (which hardens when you put it on something cold) and I put it on the cool whip when making the layers. It gave a nice little crunch to the dessert. I also used dark chocolate syrup and caramel syrup, so it was a little runny, but I just poured whatever ran out, on top when dishing. Delicious dish and will make it again!

I made this for July 4th. It was a huge hit!! Everyone wants the recipe!! It was easy to make and the guests couldn't figure out what the ingredients were. They were puzzled by it and loved it! It was easy to cut and made a good amount for a large gathering. Definitely five stars!! This recipe is a keeper!! As recommended by others, I crushed Butterfingers and it was a nice touch! Yum! Perfect summer dessert!!

I've heard this dessert is very good. I'm glad to see some variations instead of nuts since I can't eat them. My plans are to make it next weekend.
