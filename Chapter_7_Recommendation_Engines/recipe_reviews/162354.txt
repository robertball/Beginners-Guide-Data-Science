Many coleslaw recipes have either a mayo based dressing or a vinegar based dressing. The use of both in this recipe is outstanding. However, as much as I love bacon and hard boiled eggs, I found that they were out of place in coleslaw. Also you MUST use celery seed in any slaw. Just my personal take, but this was a great place to start..

Far beyond the scope of grocery store coleslaw.  I wanted this to go with a pork BBQ, and it fits the bill perfectly with my favorite barbeque sauce.  Definitely different, though I agree with the review that tells to add celery seed.  I added carrots and a little minced red onion to the mix as well.

I omitted the eggs as I didn't like the idea of them with the other ingredients. Glad I did - this is some really really good slaw. Definitely refrigerate and leave for a few hours before you eat it - it's not nearly as good straight out of the mixing bowl. Thanks!

The dressing on this slaw is wonderful.  We liked the slaw, but found the hard boiled egg a little different.  Not bad - just something we're not used to in coleslaw.  The bacon was a great addition.  Yes, I will be making this one again.  Thanks Angiee for sharing the recipe.

i wish i could give 3 and a half stars for this. the best way to describe it was.. pretty and interesting tasting. i made enough for 20 servings and there wasnt much left but i did see a table next to us who had a serving of it barely touched. 4 at our table had it and all said they prefer a regular coleslaw with a mayo/vinegar/sugar dressing. the egg was kind of strange but the bacon is ok i used dijon mustard because i didnt have grainy but i dont think it changed the result that much. thanks but it was just ok

This recipe is quite good. I, too, omitted the eggs and bacon and added the celery seeds. I also added about 1/2 cup of finely chopped onions and 2 teaspoons of smoked paprika.

I will make it again.  I used coleslaw mix.  Didn't use bacon (lazy).  Added some celery flakes,  dried red onions,  and chives.
Very tasty and probably will be more so tomorrow.

I made the several times and each time it gets better and better. My whole family love it, even my granddaughters. Thank you for the side dish that some times become the main dish. Really in enjoyed this one.
