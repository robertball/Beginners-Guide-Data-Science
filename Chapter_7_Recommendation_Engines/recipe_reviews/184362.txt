These are wonderful.  Use a candy thermometer if you have one and cook until 235 -takes the guesswork out.  I added peppermint oil and omitted the vanilla.  We crushed candy canes and some leftover peppermint meringues to dust on top.  These are HUGE-filled a 11x7 pan.   After they are cut, I shook them in a big platic bag filled with the cornstarch/sugar/crushed candy canes.  I'll be making another batch for Christmas Eve cocoa as I don't expect these to last long!

I only made these with vanilla (so no peppermint, at least not yet) and it's SOOOOO easy.  When it says to have a hard boil make sure that the entire surface of the liquid is bubbling like crazy.  I was a little apprehensive about pouring the whole hot mixture over the gelatin at once (I've only seen "stream in the syrup a little at a time..."), but it worked.  Set your timer for 6 minutes and check the marshmallows in the mixture then, my marshmallows were done in 8 minutes.  Let it set before you try it, otherwise it tastes like too much gelatin - trust me.  Great recipe, especially since one of my boys have an egg allergy. Thanks for the great recipe.

The formula for this is great, BUT I am rating it low because there is waaay to much peppermint extract in this. I knew it when I was making it, and only added 1 tsp, but it was still way to strong. I highly suggest only using 1/4-1/2 tsp peppermint extract if you want marshmallows for people who don't need a stuffy nose cleared up, and don't need a breathmint. Other than that, the basic formula, and directions were great, thanks :)

Really good recipe! If you want to try something different instead of pepermint extract use coconut extract, and top it with coconut toasted before it sets. It turns really really good.

I never knew making my own marshmallows could be so easy! I made a big batch of these to pair with jarred hot cocoa for christmas presents- a big hit with family and friends! Next time I will half the peppermint, as it was  bit too much but otherwise very tasty. A little goes a long way! Thanks for sharing :)

These are amazing!! I've never made marshmallows before, and these came out great. Like others mentioned, I only used 1tsp. of peppermint extract and they taste wonderful. Also some helpful information, "beating the mixture to fluffy and stiff peaks" it never happened...I have a kitchen Aid mixer and set the timer for 12min. all I got out of the deal was marshmallow cream, so I kept on mixing, and mixing. I never got stiff peaks, however when I decided to move forward anyway and followed the directions to the "T" they came out beautiful!! So easy to make, but don't stress out if you don't get stiff peaks. You can flavor these with any flavor you want, so easy and perfect texture. Thank you for the great recipe!!

This was an easy recipe and method to follow, and the results are tasty.  I messed up and thought I had enough corn syrup, only to discover I didn't.  I used about 1/3 cup of pancake syrup (and then omitted the peppermint flavor).  So I guess I made butter pecan marshmallows!  I can't wait to try these again with the peppermint next!

These were wonderful! I should have used a 9x9 pan. I used a cookie sheet but the little marshmellows are awesome too!

These were very easy to make.  I do agree with another reviewer that for MY taste there is a little too much peppermint extract in it.  I think I would scale it back to 1-1 1/2t.  Other than that, perfect!  I used an 8x8 pan and cut it into 36 large chunks, but you can always make them smaller.

Oh wow was this recipe easy.  The only problem I ran into was I didn't have the gelatin completely dissolved so when I added the hot sugar syrup mixture, there were some clumps of gelatin mixed in.  Some of the clumps were still there in the finished product.  Ooops.  That was my fault.  Otherwise YUM.  I didnt add peppermint either.  I just wanted plain ones.  Thank you so much!  I can't wait to try these with smores!!!!

I'm giving this 4 stars because of the overall product but just for information sake there was ENTIRELY too much peppermint flavoring in there.  It left a bad taste in my mouth, almost like medicine. Gonna make again with 1/2 tsp. of each  or maybe 1 tsp. of vanilla.

This recipe turned out perfect.  I personally don't think it takes 12 min. to whip the mixture.  I took them to work and everyone thought they were amazing.  They go great with Swiss Miss Dark Chocolate Sensation.  My hot chocolate taste like a liquid peppermint patty (Yummy).

Very easy to make.  I agree with the other reviewers that the peppermint can be a bit overwhelming.  My husband and I found it a perfect amount as written if we added the marshmallow to hot chocolate or it was good when I covered the marshmallows in chocolate.  However, just straight I would either cut the peppermint in half or maybe even quarter it.  The only thing I would add is when starting to mix start low and go higher just because hot candy flying everywhere is dangerous.  I know it may be stating the obvious, but it's good to say anyway.  Great recipe!

Very easy, and much tastier than store-bought marshmallows. We made them with vanilla flavoring only, since the hubs doesn't care for peppermint. Packaged them up with hot cocoa mix for gifts. Fun !

Love them! My first attempt at making marshmallows and it was a success! I didn't have any peppermint extract though so i used peppermint oil. And i only used 1/2 teaspoon of oil. Next time i might go for 1/4 tsp. though, they are a little strong for my taste. Love the recipe, will make again!

Easier and faster than I expected! 12 minutes may have been a little too long to beat the mix with my stand mixer's whisk - by the time I scooped it out it was pretty much too stiff to spread. Or, I might have let the sugar boil a little too long. Still delicious and I was able to smoosh it down into the pan. Just watch your times and use your judgement! I'd like to know when to mix in the cocoa powder for chocolate as pictured.

There was way too much peppermint extract in these. If I make them again, I will reduce the extract down to a 1/2 teaspoon.  They did set up well and had a nice texture.

I agree with a couple other posters, there is WAY too much peppermint. I added anotehr tsp of vanilla to try to cut the mint a little but next time I'll use probably 1/2 tsp of mint. I let it set up and then I melted a little on to some warm brownies, just enough marshmallow to cover the top and let it cool and set up again for about 2 hrs. It made really good mint chocolate brownies.

This was my first time making marshmallows and this was a great first recipe! I only used 1 t. peppermint and it's still a little strong for our tastes so I am dusting them in cocoa powder to help add a different dimension. It was also nice that the mess was minimized with these directions. I'm looking forward to experimenting with other flavors.

A few observations.. I made these, have to agree with the other reviews that it's VERY strong on peppermint, the other thing is the timing for how long to boil the sugar on the stove is really inaccurate (if you don't get the sugar temperature hot enough, when you add it to the gelatin you end up with a limp taffy instead of marshmallows). Also, depending on how long it takes for your sugar to boil (on my stove it took a long time), your gelatin can get pretty solid and you end up with gelatin chunks in the marshmallows (gross).

My suggestions: heat the sugar/corn syrup mix to 240* (ignore the time written in the recipe, it it takes longer to get to 240* that's fine), halve or quarter the amount of peppermint in the recipe, wait until your sugar is close to 240* before putting the gelatin in the water in the mixer, and run the mixer on low while you add the hot sugar. Also, use a whisk, not a beater.

best marshmallows EVER!! I pray you have fun with this recipe! I've swapped the flavors and rolled it in candy.. and dipped it in chocolate.. sometimes all three! :) You can put peanut flavor in the mallows and dip them in chocolate then dip them in crushed peanuts.. IT's AMAZING!! A great gift for friends! I've tried other recipes.. they never seem to turn out right.. these are easier and firm up great!

These were really lovely!  I have never made candy before, don't own a candy thermometer or a standing mixer, so I was a littler nervous about making these marshmallows.  The directions were so straight forward and easy to follow, and it really was foolproof for me.  I got perfect stiff white peaks after about 8 minutes of mixing with my ancient hand mixer, but it was enough time to get a great gloss and good consistency on the final marshmallow.  I did overdo the peppermint even though I only used about a teaspoon to about two teaspoons of vanilla extract.  Not to the point of them being unpleasant, just a little stronger than I would have liked.  But I suspect they'd be awesome that way in hot cocoa, but the marshmallows were devoured out of the pan.  Thank you for such a non-scary introduction in candy

Fun recipe to do with kids. I made these a year ago and the peppermint was too strong.  This year I halved the peppermint amount and it was still a little too strong for just eating but were great in our hot cocoa.  We tried to dress them up by sprinkling crushed candy canes on top. Overnight the candy kind of liquefied and oozed.  Still tasted great but didn't look great so I don't recommend the crushed candy.

These are so EASY to make!!!  I used Wiltons edible spray paint stuff to make them all sorts of colors.  They were so much fun!  Thank you!

Yummy! I've made these twice but minus the peppermint... I don't think my daughter would eat the minty ones. I used my candy thermometer as another reviewer suggested. Will definitely make again!

This is guimauve! Change out the syrup for honey, use rose or coco powder instead of peppermint.  Really any flavor can be added.  Thanks for this!

Great recipe!  Definitely use a candy thermometer, if you have one, and cook until 235, as recommended by other reviewers.  I've used this basic recipe for peppermint, root beer, caramel, cherry, lime and banana marshmallows and they have all come out  great!

I substituted the peppermint with homemade Blackberry Liqueur and they're delicious!  Obviously a little messy to make.  Can't wait to try in hot chocolate!

these were surprisingly easy and fun to make. my whole family loves them and I made this recipie about 4 times last christmas.  I use a pizza cutter coated in non stick spray to cut them. so much easier than scissorsor knives.

Update: they are done! We dredged them as directed and dipped about 10 in dark chocolate..... How delicious can marshmallows get, seriously. We had fun and have a great treat to show for it. Awesome recipe! I wish there were a second set of stars because it's easy and PERFECT!! Thanks again

Very tasty! I don't agree at all about too much peppermint, although maybe the peppermint flavoring you get in Ireland is weaker. Also, I used golden syrup instead of corn syrup, because the internet told me it would work and it did :) Very happy with them! Excellent recipe.

They peppermint seemed far too strong at first but I found that, after they sat and firmed up, the mint flavor seemed to mellow a bit. I dipped half of the marshmallows in some melted semisweet chocolate and they were super tasty. 

If you attempt these with a hand mixer, you'd better have a good one and proceed with caution (my seven speed Kitchen Aid did the trick). About six to seven minutes into beating the sugar/gelatin mixture it will start to get difficult to work with; the mixture may begin to defy gravity and travel up the beater.

Yum!  These are easy to make and so good!  My daughter loved them also!  I left out the peppermint extract (which was difficult, because I love peppermint) because my daughter doesn't care for peppermint.  Next time, I'm adding it for ME!

Wonderful. I used golden syrup instead of corn syrup, added a little pink food coloring, and topped the panful with crushed peppermint candy. To cut, I used a greased pizza wheel and greased scissors (and transferred them to a cutting board after struggling to get good straight slices in the pan). Delicious in hot cocoa! Oh, and next time I'll cut back on the peppermint extract --no more than 1 teaspoon.

These turned out WONDERFUL! I used 3-4 drops of pure peppermint oil instead of extract and they where yummy! Thank you for sharing this. I will be making these a lot with the holidays coming up.

I made this for a math school project and they turned out great! Although if I were to do it again I would use about 1 teaspoon of peppermint extract unless you’re making this for hot chocolate. I also added 5 drops of red food colouring.

These are so good!We love peppermint - so that was not too much for us - and these make fantastic cocoa marshmallows! I have a large Professional 5 Kitchenaid mixer - so I thought I would double the recipe this time - BAD IDEA! The mix hung so close to the top, I thought it was going over - but it stayed just within the bowl - until I added the extracts!!! It reminded me of a bad school volcano experiment! White fluff everywhere!!!! When I was done laughing - my husband helped clean it up (by eating the delicious goo). Thankfully it cleaned up really easily with hot water. Next time I will stick with single batches :)

Easy and basic marshmallow recipe.  It got 4 stars because with the 2 tsp of peppermint it was so strong the flavor at the end of bite almost tasted like medicine.  I'll try the 1 tsp or just try it with a different extract another time, maybe raspberry.

I just made these last night. My first attempt at homemade marshmallows. If the recipe is followed to a T this will turn out great.  Instead of adding 2 tsp of mint extract I added 2 capfuls of the extract and it seemed to be the perfect amount. After the marshmallows where set I did the sugar/cornstarch dredge and put them in a softer to get the rest of the dry off of them, leaving a very light layer of dryness. Then I used melting chocolate and did a light drizzle with a fork. Not only are they pretty and festive but they taste great. I even tried a couple in my hot cocoa (made for adults) and they melted just like store marshmallows. They were fabulous. The ONLY thing I can’t stress enough is to make sure you oil down the plastic wrap/foil and the knife when you cut them. VERY IMPORTANT!  I used a non stick spray, perfect. Enjoy

This was a fantastic flop for me... I'm not sure how to trouble shoot it... I followed directions pretty much to the t, but mine turned out more like fluff.  The taste was yummy but didn't solidify like I'd hoped. More gelatin maybe? I have no idea... I'm super bummed, as my new, expensive kitchen aid mixer's soul purpose was to make homemade marshmallows... darn!

Made these for Christmas.   They were a big hit.  One thing is that they do not form stiff peaks like egg whites.   They are peaks that are firm and soft because of the gelatin.   Go with it.  I greased a pizza cutter to cut them.   They come out great and I don't even like marshmallows.   Friends and family enjoyed them.  Great recipe for being creative.

This is five stars IF you reduce the peppermint to 1/2 tsp or less.  It really was overwhelming as written.  I've made this several times.  On one occasion I cut it into squares, then drizzled melted chocolate over it and served for an after dinner mint treat.  My favorite way to enjoy is to add a square to hot chocolate.  You can't beat homemade marshmallow.  It is way better than store bought.

I followed the others' advice and used 1 tsp. Of the mint extract. I added mini chocolate chips when I was incorporating the extracts and green food coloring which caused them to melt. Not what I wanted but was a good mistake since there was a swirl of chocolate through them all. I also used a 9x13 pan. The recommended size would have been too small. Sprinkled some mini chips on top while it set. Yummo!

Made a half batch in 8x8 pan with 1/4 tsp peppermint extract, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and a couple drops red food coloring.  I think the 1/4 tsp was good for the half batch, so that'd be 1/2 tsp for the full recipe.

These turned out just as I had hoped! I did as a reviewer has suggested and used candy thermometer and so it actually boiled for 2 minutes. Only had to beat for about 5 minutes then. The rest I did just as in recipe except I was out of peppermint so I just used vanilla. Will definitely use this recipe again! Fast and easy!

These were so easy to make! I omitted the peppermint because I wanted just vanilla flavored marshmallows, and they were delicious! I don't have a candy thermometer, so I followed another reviewer's advice and let the mixture come to a hard boil before starting the timer.  The motor of my poor mixer started to overheat about 6 minutes into the beating process, so I shut it off and crossed my fingers that the marshmallows would set--they did! I can't wait to make another batch!

These were fantastic! I used them for Homemade S'mores for a party, and I had a bunch left over! I replaced the peppermint extract with a little bit more vanilla, and they came out great.

This recipe worked out great for me! I thought they had a lovely but not overpowering peppermint taste and were very easy to make. Definitely going to play around with this recipe to create new flavors.

TWO drops of peppermint extract would probably be correct.

These came out great!  I followed the recipe closely, the only exception using only 1tsp peppermint flavoring as others have suggested.  They set up beautifully and looked (and tasted) like Williams Sonoma's gourmet marshmallows! They were consumed in a flash.  My teens felt they could have been a little more minty - not for eating but for cocoa dunking.  Maybe I will make a 'minty extreme' version for them.  It does help to have the tools like a stand mixer and silicone spatula.

I used the Martha Stewart recipe (which is essentially exactly the same just larger proportion sizes to fit 9X13 pan). I only used a teaspoon peppermint extract in the larger recipe...if you used 2 full tsp in this I'd think it would be overwhelmingly pepperminty and I really like peppermint. A couple of tips: cook the syrup to 238, which takes about 9 minutes after it comes to a boil, and use a VERY large pan for this because it will boil over. I used a much too small pan and had to switch it over. Also, although I'm certain it hit 238 during boil, and mixed it with my mixer on high for over 12 minutes and it got very fluffy, it never got to what I would consider "stiff" peaks, like what you'd consider for a meringue. I was worried it wouldn't work. But I put it in my 9X13 (silpat on the bottom helps immensely by the way) and left it overnight. The marshmallows were soft and perfect the next morning. I put crushed up candy canes (before I let them set) on top and kind of pressed them in, and they turned out very cute.

Great and fun recipe. I reduce the peppermint to 1/2 teaspoon, that really is quite enough.  I add a few drops of red food coloring and swirl it in by hand to make a pretty pink ribbon of color throughout before pouring the fluffy marshmallow batter into the prepared pan. Very nice result! I also increase the powdered sugar and cornstarch to 1/2 cup each and mix it up in a gallon freezer bag. Add 1 small jar of pink luster dust and one of white luster dust, and mix that in the bag as well. Place 10 cut marshmallows in the bag, seal and  shake it around to coat. The luster dust is very pretty and mixing in the bag is less messy than doing the powdered sugar "step" in a bowl. Really enjoy this recipe!

Very easy to follow this was my first time making marshmallows.  After reading the previous reviews, I agree to maybe use a candy thermometer or at least to boil till it gets thick.  I added essential oil to mine and it was too much peppermint.  I will definitely make again and cannot wait to try in my cocoa tonight.

these were awesome...everyone loved them...what I did use was leftover peppermint candy canes from Christmas and pulverized them in the blender then made them into a syrup on the stove.  the flavor was perfect.  everything else was the same.

So tasty! Better than store bought! A bit messy but what can you expect from almost 3 cups of sticky whipped sugar?! I didnt have peppermint so I used Cinnaman oil insted (3 drops) and it was just a nice hint of flavor. Would be excellent to bake some into some brownies (which Im planning!) Yum!
