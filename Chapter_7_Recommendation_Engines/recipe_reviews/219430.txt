Made as written and this was good but I have a couple of suggestions that I think would improve the recipe. As written there is too much liquid and you get a mushy dressing. I suggest leaving out the water completely and using the liquid from the oysters if you need more liquid. On that note, whole canned oysters do not have much eye appeal. That and biting into a whole one was a bit off putting. I think it would be better if you chopped them up small and that way they are incorporated throughout the entire dish instead of just hunks here and there. If done that way I'm thinking you could also get away with only using 1 can of oysters instead of 2 which would save money. This was super simple and tasty and one I will make again with my minor tweaks.

The first time I made exactly as directed and it was delicious.  For Thanksgiving I used herb and spiced bread cubes instead of the cornbread but it was delicious also. I would not change it for the fist making but with the second making the sliced bread cubes contained the spices and I cooked it uncovered in the oven to make it crispy on top.
