This recipe wasn't over the top at all, but it was easy, so that's always a benefit.  I have a vegetarian in the house and decided to eliminate the turkey.  Instead, I drained an extra can of beans and added it into the mix.  I take the whole family's opinion into consideration when reviewing, and when the kids will eat it, it's a winner.

This chili was insanely hot. I am rating it a 3 and that is only because I do have a pepper lover in the house. Personally, I could not eat it. I realized I just do not care for the chipotle chilis in a can. They have a very dominant taste in food they are added to and I am not sure if some in a can are hotter than others, but I apparently bought the hottest kind sold. In the end I added a can of diced petite tomatoes for color and to cut through some of the heat. Lastly, I just ended up adding cheese and an avocado directly to the chili to see if that would also help with the heat. It helped some and mellowed out the chipotle flavor a little too. We topped it with lime flavored tortilla chips. I couldn't finish mine, even with 2 large iced drinks, but it will get eaten in another person's packed lunches.

Looking for something quick to use some leftover turkey. Used shredded turkey breast instead of ground and substituted a can of black beans for some of the red. (The shredded turkey really makes it.)

Throw the peppers, onion, garlic and a handful of cilantro in the Ninja to chop it up. Also added a tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of smoked paprika; couple of dashes of cayenne for the spicy lovers in the house.

This has become one of our go-to dishes. EASY and awesome!

My family agrees…this Quick and Healthy Turkey Chili recipe was delicious!!!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, my only changes were, I added in a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, and added a 1 ½ tsp of GOYA Adobo seasoning (per our taste)…I will most certainly make this again!!!

Love this stuff! I have made this three times already and we dig in before I get to take a picture! I made it once in the slow cooker and it is just as yummy.

This was very good!  Quick, easy, and delicious!  I have no idea what GOYA is, I assume it's a brand name, but I just used regular old brands that I'm used to.  I also skipped the chipotle chiles, actually I just forgot them...And it was still really good!  I also added a teeny bit of cayenne pepper, which makes everything a little more delicious, and after serving, we realized it wasn't quite spicy enough for us, so we added a little Tapatio hot sauce.  I'll definitely make this again!

Very flavorful but used one can of chili beans and one can of black beans instead of two cans of kidney beans.   Turned out great and was easy!

This is really delicious and I plan to make it again soon. It is very flavorful and tasty for a healthy chili. I had a hard time finding the Goya Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce and they are expensive online. I was thankful that I stopped in a Walmart and found them along with most of the other Goya products. I would recommend this again and again.

I love this recipe every time. I add veggies that are close to expiration and substitute Goya seasoning with Italian seasoning. I also add diced tomatoes and eat it with cheddar cheese and Tostitos which is better than frito pie!

This is my go-to chili recipe of all time! The only difference I do is less Chipotle peppers so that it's not too hot. The avocado and cilantro give it the ultimate twist. The best!

Made with the intention of using as a freezer meal, but I couldn't resist eating a bowl for lunch!  Used only 1 can of kidney beans and it was enough.

This recipe has a distinct tomato taste and a mild "zing" of heat from the chipotle chile.  I was expecting more heat, so I was pleased that DH could eat it, now that he is experiencing a few stomach issues.  It would be very easy to add more chipotle, if you want more heat.  Both DS and DH liked it, it was very easy to prepare, and it made 4 generous servings.  I would incorporate this into a nice "taco" salad for summer.

My whole family enjoyed this recipe. I made it as per instructions. The only thing I would change is to use shredded turkey or chicken in place of ground. Or perhaps just add more.

this was great, we made with with half the portion of chipotle pepper because we were worried it would be too spicy, but it was the perfect amount! we split it with two pots for a meaty turkey dish and a vegetarian one. will be definitely making it again, with variations! :)

I have made this a few times now and my family loves it! I skip the chipotle chili's altogether because my kids don't do spicy. I have used el pato brand jalapeño tomatoe sauce instead of plain tomatoe sauce and it does add a kick to the chili. I usually double the recipe and use it for meal prepping for the week. freezes well too!

I did not use the hot elements, added some chili powder and it came out great!  At first, the husband wrinkled his nose, but he enjoyed it.  I added mushrooms and roasted chick peas that I had on hand as well.

We enjoyed this! I substituted ground chicken because it is what I had on hand. Filling meal.
