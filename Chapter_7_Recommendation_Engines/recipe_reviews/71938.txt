Just made this - AWESOME! But I made the following changes: 1 - Used regular all purpose flour, 3 cups. 2 - Omitted the Allspice - But used the rest of fragrant spices. 3 - On the bread wash, all you need is 1 T. of water and 1 T. of maple syrup, and the oats. More than that is wasteful. 4 - I elongated the loaf slightly, baked on a dark round pan, so drop the temp to 350 degrees for that.  Using allspice with the other spices will make the loaf too pungent. The other spices, on their own, are fantastic!  Hubby loved this!  And, of course, the use of genuine maple syrup instead of sugar makes this so much healthier - of course, using spelt flour and oat flour would have too, but I didn't have any  :)  Great recipe!!!

The dough didn't rise as much as I thought it should have, and the recipe called for too much allspice and ginger; it had bite to it, but it was good overall, and I'd make it again.

YUMMMMMM :) I only put in 1/4 tsp ginger after reading the other review, which seemed to work well. Also, that was a lot o liquid to brush on top - I used maybe half that.

I also felt that the dough didn't rise as much, but the bread is delicious. Hearty, crusty outside and moist inside. The spices make make people ask for the recipe, although I have not used allspice and nutmeg. Next time I will make it divided into dinner rolls with almonds and cranberries.

Nice spicy taste.  Would be awesome with raisins.
