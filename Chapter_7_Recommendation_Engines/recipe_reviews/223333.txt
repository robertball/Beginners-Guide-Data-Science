This is my favorite hummus.  So much better than the one in the supermarket.  I omitted the basil and next time will reduce the lemon juice but it is a definite keeper.

I made this as written and it tastes great.  It's a good no-tahini hummus.

Loved this recipe!  Last time used artichoke hearts instead of olives and a little oil from the jar, basil and extra garlic.  Yum!!

This is delicious!  I just made it and can't wait to have some tonight.  I let all the flavors sit for an hour before tasting.  My 4 yr old twins gave it a thumbs up too!

Excellent as is.  Good when first made, best when let set a day or so.  Only change I made was to crush the garlic rather than mince it.

People love this.  I hate to give out the recipe because then THEY bring it to the potluck.  It's an easy winner.

LOVE this recipe and it was super easy! I however, did not add basil or parsley. I love green olives and this is my new FAV hummus!

A bit of a strong lemon taste, I think i'll decrease the amount next time I make it.
