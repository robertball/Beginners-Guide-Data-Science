This recipe is great. For additional flavor I added finely chopped celery and bell pepper.

This is good just like it's listed, with a little cayenne pepper. I certainly can't imagine adding chili powder to dressing. I added a little bit of poultry seasoning to mine and and it was great.

Added celery, used chili powder instead of cheyenne, a little poultry seasoning, turn out good, kids & husband liked it.  A little sweet for me but still really good, next time use cheyenne and not chili poweder.  Maybe white pepper, instead of black pepper.

This recipe was great. I did not need 15 servings so i made this based on 5 servings. I did modify it a bit by adding 1 granny smith apple chopped and 1/2 cup of dried cranberries. Also I only had chicken stock so i used that instead of broth. I used the mixture to stuff a chicken. Well it came out phenomenal! Kid, hubby, and some friends absolutely loved the stuffing. The apples n cranberries gave it a nice kick. Will do again.
