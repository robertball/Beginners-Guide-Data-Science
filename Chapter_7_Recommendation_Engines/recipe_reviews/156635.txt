These cookies were super easy to make with a short list of ingredients. A couple of things: made a lot more cookies than 24 (I used a 2t scoop and ended up with around 60) I baked them for the full 11 minutes and they were perfectly light and just a little chewy Used parchment paper instead of ungreased sheet Let them cool on the sheet before transferring to a wire rack since they were soft while they were still warm My husband said they taste like chewy gingersnaps I think they taste like cinnamon cake. Great recipe and a definate keeper!!

As an inexperienced cook I found this recipe pretty easy to make. Two things though and I'm not sure if this is common knowledge or not but I made half the cookies on flat 'air flow' baking sheets with no sides/edges and half of the batch with a regular baking sheet. The cookies seemed to really flatten out like pancakes on the air flow sheet but on the other baking sheet they were fine. As well I added a bit more cinnamon because I love the stuff but it really ended up being overpowering once they were done. Hope that helps any baking newbies out there!

These flatten out A LOT so spread them far apart on the cookie sheet and 350 is a littlee to hot because the middle doesn't cook as fast as the outside. On the otherhand they taste VERY good!!

These were great warm right out of the oven and still great the next day crumbled over vanilla ice cream. All 5 of us loved them and we will be making this a regular addition to our dessert favorites. Can't wait to try it again with butterscotch chips. Thanks!

These are some of the best cookies I've made. Few ingredients and an easy recipe. They are right up there with oatmeal and toll house cookies!

This is a soft cookie which I knew it would be because of the higher ratio of brown sugar (which lends softness) to white sugar (which lends crispiness). While I knew this would not appeal to me as I like my cookies crunchy I knew Hubs would like them - and he did. Neither of us could taste graham cracker flavor I of course knew it was in there but Hubs did not. In addition I found them a tad on the greasy side. A bag of cinnamon chips (roughly 2 cups) boosted the cinnamon flavor. As I do with all my cookie dough that begins with butter I gave it a stint in the fridge for an hour or so until it was semi-firm. So between the softness the somewhat greasiness and the fact the graham cracker flavor was barely apparent these were not my favorite cookie. Hubs on the other hand loved them so I ll use his rating of four stars.

Easy to make. Very subtle cookie... not rich or overly sweet. I think I was hoping for gooey cookies with a very "cinnamony" taste. I agree they taste like a cinnamon cake.

Very easy recipe. I used a cookie scoop and got almost 4 dozen. They do spread so be careful how many you bake at a time. But they were delicious and the house smells great when you're baking them. Added them to my Christmas cookie collection.

It's just me to change a recipe using my experience & other's reviews soooo here's what I did differently: More cinnamon - half teaspoon more; subbed half cup whole wheat flour for white; 3/4c white sugar & 1/2c brown. With the sugar in the crumbs nearly 1/4c in 2c crumbs I couldn't add all the sugar. They were plenty sweet. 'Could probably reduce it even more. I chilled the dough then shaped it into a log on wax paper rolled it froze & sliced. Mine took longer to bake as expected with refrigeration & they were still chewy even with browned edges. 'Not the prettiest cookies & they do spread (less with wheat flour) but they did the trick for using up graham cracker crumbs.

These are wonderful!! I made a simple no-bake strawberry cheesecake filling to put between two cookies and put them in the freezer. You have to try that!! These are great by themselves too. They taste very close to my favorite graham cracker crust from this site that has cinnamon in it too. That's what I was going for. Just great!

I made these today with no problem. The consistentcy was just right. I could actually roll these into balls with my hands. I melted the butter over the stove and then whisked the sugars to combine as I do not have a mixer. Did everything else as stated in the recipe. I'd say it's a keeper.

Just finished baking one batch of these cookies and I have another batch baking in the oven. I'm making these cookies while my family is sleeping. I've already eaten two cookies. I hope I don't eat them all before my family wakes up. They're very good. I'm going to top a few more of these cookies with the Roady Road ice cream I have in the fridge:)

Tasty chewy cookie. I didn't make any changes to the recipe. The cookies were indeed flat (using AirBake insulated cookie sheets); allow sufficient space between the balls of dough.

These are super yummy and very simple to make. Great beginner recipe for kids.  They did not turn out fluffy like the ones in the pic, they turned out flat and big but still yummy and chewy.

I have excited to try these cookies for awhile and finally did so today. They are not what I expected. There is not a lot of cinnamon flavor more of just a graham flavor. I think they might be good used like some reviewers have said to make ice cream sandwiches. But just as a cookie we did not really like them.
