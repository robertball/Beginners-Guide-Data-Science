I was limited on time so I modified this recipe a bit.  I rubbed the pork chops in the dry ingredients, and placed them on a flat griddle.  I mixed the mustard and real syrup and poured spoonfuls over the top.

I turned the pork chops after about 8 minutes and poured more of the glaze on.

I did reduce the pepper to a single teaspoon but I think next time I'll only use a 1/4 of a teaspoon.  And maybe get a spicer brown mustard.  

Overall great flavors, easy dinner.

Very Good! I made many changes because of lack of time and ingredients. I used onion soup mix because I had no onion powder. I reduced the amount of salt because of the salt already in the soup mix. I used dijon mustard. I used pancake syrup insead of maple syrup. I mixed all of the ingredients together (I didn't have time to marinate). Put some olive oil in a frying pan (med-high heat). I seared the chops on both sides and then added the mixture to the pan, covered it and simmered the sauce and chops about 15 min. It was great!!!!!! My husband loved it. Will definitely make this again....probably the same way because I didn't have to plan ahead.

This was quite simple and very tasty. I did use fresh chopped green onion instead of onion powder and I added fresh minced garlic. We all liked this and it was very simple for me to make on a very chaotic day. I think marinating the pork in the sauce all day is what made it so good. I served this with Company Couscous and Sour Cream Cucumbers.

This is the best pork chop recipe I have tried in a long time!  But....I didn't find it until 30 minutes before cooking dinner, so I made a small change.  Since I didn't have time to marinate, I rubbed the pork chops with olive oil, then applied the rub.  Put in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.  Then, instead of broiling, I placed them on the grill and grilled them.  I grilled them at 375 degrees, 5 minutes on each side, then 1 minute with the glaze, turned them over, and 1 more minute with the glaze.  They were awesome and my husband said he could eat them every night!!!!

Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was the weekly dish on the quality cook dot com last week.  My family really enjoyed it.  I added a little mustard powder to the rub.  I let them sit all day in the fridge.  But the best part of it was the glaze.  My hubby wants to try it on all kinds of things!  Thanks for the great recipe Shannon :)

These were good. Maybe next time I'll read the directions correctly. I mixed all the spices, maple syrup and mustard togethered, and slathered the pork steaks [that's what I used] in the sauce. Let them marinate for about an hour. Then I reread the directions, woops. I wasn't going to waste them, so I broiled them the same amount of time as suggested. They turned out good. Thanks!

These were way too sweet for me!  But, I would like to try the glaze again with another cut of meat, which would most likely end up being ham.  Ended up marinating my chops in the rub for longer than suggested, but they were really flavorful as a result...and I did use some hot sauce to cut the sweetness of the glaze a bit.  Thanks Shannon, for the recipe...if nothing else, these pork chops were nice and juicy!

Amazed with how delicious it was. We ate it with pierogies and broccoli, both of which soaked up the juice from the bottom of the plate incredibly. It was so easy and fast to make, we recommend leaving it just a couple extra minutes to get the crunch on the outside.

I think this may be the best pork recipe I've tried to date - and so easy too! I'm going to try the glaze on chicken next.

These were pretty good. I would give them 3 1/2 stars if I could. My boyfriend thought they were just OK, but don't listen to him, he's not a big fan of mustard. 
I didn't broil these, because I didn't have a broiling pan. I just pan fried them instead. And since I pan fried them I didn't make a glaze. I doubled the ingredients for the glaze, added a little brown sugar and simmered into a sauce I served on top. Was yummy! The rub was fairly basic, but not bad.

Made as described (left in fridge all day in plastic bag with rub), except omitted second-side glaze (ran out of time and was setting off the smoke alarm!).  Very tasty, although *almost* too spicy.  Second glazing might have helped, as the sweetness did (I think) cut the spiciness a bit.  Had been afraid they might be too sweet...but they weren't.  Thanks!

These were pretty tasty! I used thin cut pork chops, but I think in the future I would use thicker ones, as the glaze overpowered the "pork" flavor. Other than that the glaze was great! A little sweet when combined with the brown sugar that they marinated it, but a nice change. And for the low calories, you can't beat it.

Wasn't paying close attention and mixed all ingredients including syrup together at once and marinated 30 minutes before I realized it. Broiled about 4 min per side then put chops and sauce in baking dish covered in foil and baked 350 for 30 minutes. It was excellent! I also used smoked paprika for a little heat. Spicy and sweet is my favorite and I will up this sauce for many other things.

I tried this once as written and like it quite a bit.  It was very sweet but I served it with brown rice and peas on the side. I made this a second time with a Chinese twist... using Chinese 5-spice in the rub and a tablespoon of soy sauce in the glaze.  Then I served it with Edamame and brown rice on the side. Even better!

I was given some maple syrup that had a smoky wood fire taste, so I was looking for a meat recipe to use it in and found this.  My husband didn't think he would like it, but he did!  I did cut the sugar and added cayenne pepper.  I also increased the spicy mustard in the glaze.  We enjoyed this recipe and would like to  try it again on ham.

I was looking for a quick recipe for pork chops about 1 hour before dinner...so no time to let it marinade.  I followed the recipe completely (except for the letting it marinade for 6 hours part) and it turned our great!  Loved the glaze, it ended up being not too sweet, even my savory loving husband said it's a keeper.

My family really liked this.  I used part maple syrup and part table syrup, and less pepper.  I didn't have time to marinate long, only had it sit for about 30 minutes.  I pan fried the chops and they were awesome.  I am going to try adding some cayenne next time to give it a little more spice to counteract the sweet.  Will definitely make this again!

I've prepared this twice in the last 2 weeks and it will be in regular rotation for me, ongoing.  I used boneless pork chops the first time and a 1lb pork tenderloin the second time, both successfully.  I did modify the recipe a bit, and used steak & chop grill seasoning I got from Aldi instead of the salt, pepper, onion powder and paprika.  So, I combined the 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a tablespoon of the grill seasoning for the dry rub.  I only marinated the meat for a couple hours each time and then followed the rest of the recipe.  Super delicious!

I found this delicious.  I had a maple syrup sample in the cupboard.  I cannot get that sort of thing here in France.  When I make it again, I will have to use golden syrup or honey.  I do my marinating in a large glass jar.  More convenient.  A shake here and a shake there.

This was a great recipe. I didn't use all of the glaze because I didn't want it too sweet. They were juicy and perfect. Thanks for the recipe, Shannon

Wow, these are REALLY good.  I used thin cut pork chops, marinated them overnight and then just cooked them on the stove top since I hate broiling.  They turned out so good! They are a tad sweet though so I might cut back on the brown sugar a bit next time.

Made this for Mom for Mother's Day. She loved it as did my granddaughter (she wanted more!). I reduced brown sugar to 3 tbs and that was the only change. The chops were delicious, moist and tender.

Great, something I would make for guests.  I used more mustard in the glaze and half sugar-free maple syrup and half of the real deal.  I will follow the suggestion of another reviewer and use some dried mustard in the rub to cut down on the overall sweetness, but it is still an excellent recipe. The chops carmelized under the broiler because of the brown sugar in the rub.

My husband said this was the best pork dish I've ever made.  I had to disagree, so I'm giving it a 4!  I actually had the chops sitting in the fridge with the spice mixture for about 36 hours because I didn't make this the night I thought I would!  So that may have contributed to the odd spicy/sweet taste that I didn't care for.  As I said though, my husband LOVED the combination of flavors so I'll probably make it again and only let the spices sit for 6-8 hours.  Maybe that will make it better for me.

Used lite pancake syrup (no pure syrup) and used onion salt instead of onion powder (did not have either).  Chops came out very tasty that everyone loved.

Yum!  I added some cayenne pepper to the rub to balance the sweetness and only had stone ground mustard for the glaze.  I thought the dish turned out great!  Thanks for the post!  Oh, and the cooking time was perfect - not dry at all!!

This wasn't bad but it needs some work next time. It is way too sweet for us. Addition of some ground red pepper helped take away some of the sicking sweetness. I would suggest a lot less sugar and syrup.

I made this recipe as is, with the exception of using smaller pork chops than required because it was all I had. I cooked my thinner chops a little less (3 minutes per side) but left them under the broiler the final time 1-2 minutes extra. The final result was tasty, but not crisp and would have been perfectly cooked if not for that extra minute or so. This is a good recipe, neither too spicy nor too sweet as written. Would recommend!

Fantastic, simple glaze.

The rub is also great, it comes out quite peppery (yet still very edible if you like pepper) and next time I'll probably do only half the pepper called for.

I have made this recipe several times.  My whole family loves it.  The sweet maple mustard glaze compliments the spicy pepper  seasoned pork chops great.  I usually cook these on the grill but broiling them is almost as good.  Marinating them overnight gives the best flavor.  Sometimes I make extra glaze and serve it
with the chops.

My husband decided to make this recipe for supper. Thank goodness he cut the black pepper in half!! Who in their right mind would ever use a full tablespoon of black pepper? Even with doing that, it was still a touch too hot for me. I didn't really like the flavour and we won't be using this recipe again.

Best pork rub/glaze I've had. I would reduce the black pepper a bit as I found it a bit strong but that might be because I was only able to let it marinate for 2 hours. Overall this was delicious.

I will definitely make this again! The picture is exactly how I served it-absolutely delicious. I sautéed some fresh spinach in olive oil and kosher salt and added a little of the mustard-maple glaze. Put the spinach on the bottom, mash potatoes on top of the spinach, and the pork chop on top. Love the savory-sweetness of it all! The only mistake I made was using pure ground pepper instead of freshly ground (Way too much pepper because I used the full Tablespoon of finely ground pure pepper!)  Thanks for sharing!

I was a little iffy on the sweetness factor in this recipe - I prefer my meat savory. So I added in some extra mustard to the glaze. I probably shouldn't have worried, though - I used the full amount of black pepper and that made the entire chop taste tangy and faintly spicy rather than overly sweet!
I didn't have a broiling pan, but used a cooling rack over a cookie sheet and that seemed to work just fine.
New favorite pork chop recipe right here!

These chops had the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  I prepared them exactly as the recipe stated, but I did broil them for a shorter time.  Only 3 minutes per side before basting with the sauce.  I served the extra sauce on the side for dipping, a big hit with my husband!  I'll make this again and again.  I also served baked delicata squash and green beans almondine.  Great mix of sweet and savory.

I don't know why this caught my eye but I made it this evening and it was very tasty. I'm not sure what I did wrong but the glaze was more like sauce - incredibly tasty sauce but not glaze. Also five minutes a side was way too long but I was watching the broiler closely so no fiery or crunchy disasters. It was very easy and went really well with mashed sweet potatoes and grilled asparagus. Definitely goes in my "saved" file and other than figuring out what I screwed up with the glaze I wouldn't change a thing.

Our new favorite way to do pork chops. I got pretty nervous when the chops looked burned coming out of the broiler, but that's just the sugar. I stuck with it, followed the cooking times and they came out so delicious; perfect.

This was great! Only thing I did was add a little chili powder to the rub because other reviews said it needed a little cayenne or something. It's hot here right now so I didn't want to turn on the broiler. I pan seared the pork and added the sauce, turned it to low for five minutes. My husband has said three different times how good it was even though he doesn't really like sweet sauces. This was a hit with the whole family and I'll definitely make it again!

This came out perfectly! I took 1 min off the cooking time and the chops were moist and very flavorful. Thanks for this recipe -- we'll be eating this often!

I can't breath, Holy Cow is this great!!  I think I just made the best meal of my life, and I've been cooking for a very long time!  Thank you oh so much for posting this!  I used about 1 inch thick pork loin slices, I could only marinade it for an hour, totally enough. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly!  I served it with cubed fried potatoes seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper... and sweet corn for our veggie..... BEST MEAL EVER!!!

I was in a time crunch so I didn't marinate it long. I paired it with a spicy blank bean with white rice which was a great combo! Amazing sauce! Hubby liked it a lot!

This was a hit! My husband raved about it and the kids ate it all up! I didn't have spicy brown mustard, so I used regular mustard with a little horseradish to add that zip. If you plan on making this, my only suggestion is to use Medium or Dark Maple Syrup. It has a natural smoky taste that goes great with the pork! I think this will become a regular meal for us, thanks!!

My husband loved this recipe.  I left out the  maple syrup.  I know it seems weird, but I worried it would be too sweet.  I added a dash of cayenne pepper, too.  My husband said it was tangy and sweet, definitely not one note.

4.5 Stars:  I let this marinate overnight and the black pepper was quite strong, but we loved it.  It reminded me of peppered jerky.  The sauce was good and overall a really good dish.

This turned out really well for me! I felt like that tablespoon of pepper sounded like an awful lot, so I reduced it to a half tablespoon, and added a half teaspoon of crushed red pepper. I also reduced the brown sugar to heaping 1/8 cup, and that worked well for my household. I marinated for about 7 hours. Following another reviewer, I also seared my two very thick pork steaks over medium high heat (in my cast iron skillet), poured the glaze over, and then simmered until done. It took longer this way, but I kept an eye on it and it didn't over cook, turning out tender and juicy. I reduced the glaze in the skillet while the steaks rested, and that glaze really made the dish perfect, with that spicy sweet flavor. Yum! Only four stars because I did make changes, but when I make this again, I'll cook in the same fashion. Thanks for the recipe!

They came out wonderful! The only thing I would change is I would bake the porkchops instead of broiling them.  But a very good recipe and the family loved it and voted it as a repeat dish.

I only give it two stars because I used store bought syrup instead of pure maple syrup, so the taste could have been my fault. It had a weird smell and taste to it. I didn't like it at all. Sorry.

Excellent recipe!  Juicy, juicy, juicy!  My family rated this 5 stars and requested it be the only pork recipe in my recipe file!  I made it as directed with the exception of the pure maple syrup, which I didn't have on hand.  In it's place I used regular pancake syrup and it turned out great!  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

This was quite good. I used only about 1/4 tsp pepper as per other reviewer's suggestions. It got a little dry, but I was messing with my broiler setting and think I just left it in a little too long. Will try again.

A recipe which will definitely go to my favourites, The rub is easy to prepare, and yields a great taste. I used Djjon for the spicy brown mustard - it's all I had - and it gave a delicious flavour. This time I did use the broiler (and it worked out fine), next time I'll cook the pork on the barbeque. Great recipe Shannon.

We really liked this, especially my husband. It's an easy recipe, ingredients are common, and fast to cook. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and cut down the sugar/syrup amount by a tablespoon or too. All turned out well. With leftovers, I used the pork for souvlaki (pita stuffed with meat, feta, and tziki sauce) and it turned out well, also.

Way to sweet for me. I would not fix this again. Maybe if you served side dishes that could balance some of the sweetness.

This recipe was a big hit for dinner. The kids all loved it. I didn't put it in the fridge overnight but coated the pork chops well and placed them in a deep fry pan and browned them and simmered on low until done. Definitely a recipe for the future. Thank you for sharing.

I liked these but found them a little to sweet for us, so I would either cut back on the brown sugar or syrup.  I think the sauce would be good on pork loin with some of the sweetness gone.  Thanks for the post.
