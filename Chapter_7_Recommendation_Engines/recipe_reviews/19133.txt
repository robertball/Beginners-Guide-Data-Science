I really like this just as written. I also have played around with it using boneless breast strips adding diced celery (because I add celery to everything) bell pepper and jalapenos. Cilantro also makes a nice addition. I also serve over rice sometimes. Very simple quick and satisfies my tomato sauce addiction.

This was really good and after simmering it didn't need to be thickened. I served it over rice and it was great that way.

This recipe was a wonderful surprise! I used boneless/skinless chicken breast and it was full of flavor and melts in your mouth. I only had one can of corn and one can of tomato sauce so I used that and a can of stewed Italian tomatoes. With mashed potatoes this was a big hit. Thank you so much!

This recipie was a great hit with my family. The kids loved this chicken. They said it tasted like a chicken enchilada. This recipie will make a great contribution to my recipie box to add a spice of flavor to the ordinary piece of chicken.

This was a wonderful and simple recipe. I was making it for only one person so I followed the 2-serving recipe (I have enough left over for another meal). I added a bit more corn and I also added sliced carrot - it added a nice texture and added some body. I also used a boneless chicken breast (as many other people here seem to have done) and the flavor penetrated the chicken wonderfully. I found with the tomato sauce there was enough salt so I didn't add any salt. Also since the chicken was boneless I only let it simmmer for about half an hour instead of a full hour. All in all this recipe was a great simple solution to a fairly empty pantry and resulted in a delicious meal!

Excellent! A super recipe I modified it a little with 1/2 cup of heavy cream half way through simmering and I used more crushed red pepper flakes I like the heat.

This recipe was good but I think it needs something "more." My husband thought it was great but to me it was a little bland and I even added some poultry seasoning to the flour. I ended up adding some of the leftover flour to the tomato sauce as I felt it was still too thin after the cooking time. With some tweaking I might like this dish better. Maybe some cayenne? It was good with mashed potatos as suggested.

EUREKA! I've FOUND the "something missing" that lots of reviewers mentioned! LIME AVOCADO GRATED CHEESE & CHIVES! With the addition of these this recipe was fabulous- and was really more like a thick chicken tortilla soup (w/out the tortillas- but those would have been good too). I also added a few other things: mushrooms celery some sliced carrots- and a little bit of Shiraz wine I needed to get rid of. I think the Shiraz added a nice touch- the veggies were good too but I think they could be left out. The really essential additions in my opinion were the LIME AVOCADO & CHEESE. I may have changed this into a whole new recipe but the basis was excellent- so I'm giving it a "5". This was yummy & quite filling all by itself. Next time I'd serve with warm corn tortillas and a salad. Thanks for the great recipe!:)

I liked this recipe. The chicken came out very tender but it just seemed like it needed something else maybe it needs to be served with tortillas or something or add pasta?

This was pretty good I was surprised. The garlic and spices really help out a plain can of tomato sauce. I used boneless skinless breasts and cream of chicken soup for personal preferences. Not gourmet but different simple and yummy over rice.

This recipe;e was really good and simple. I loved it because I didn't have to go out of the house to get any of the ingredients. I also served it over rice and added Parmesan cheese on top which really added flavor. However it seems like it was missing something but I'm not sure what it was...going to read other reviews to she what people did differently.

The blended taste with a chicken that is so soft it falls off the bone. Great with a side of potato. I recommend to try and taste it for yourself.
