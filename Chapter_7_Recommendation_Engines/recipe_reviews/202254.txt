This recipe would get more than five stars in my book if I could give them. Amazing, tangy flavor. So much healthier and more exciting than a boxed granola. I changed a few minor things - ground flax for the seeds, coconut extract and coconut oil, as I love lime and coconut. This granola is a total treat with vanilla yogurt and fresh mango. It has summer written all over it. Thanks for the great recipe larkspur ~ keep them coming!

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except I threw in a few extra almonds (who wants to save 1/4 cup, right?) I used it to top yogurt. I threw on some fresh blueberries, too. This makes an awesome breakfast!

When I made this (absolutely delish) recipe, I followed the directions up until the baking process. I chose not to stir every 15 minutes, and just let it bake. After it had cooled thoroughly, I had a solid pan of granola that I simply broke into small pieces, as I prefer a chunky granola. But, also, I still end up with a small amount of fine granola, which I love to sprinkle on my yogurt. Doing it this way allows the best of both worlds.

Wonderful flavor with the lime.  Great with yoghurt, as a dessert topping, as well as the usual breakfast dish.  I used ground flax meal instead of flax seed.  Thanks for a tasty recipe.

I wanted to like this--a lot--but it just doesn't have any kind of wow factor. The lime is too subtle, which was surprising to me since there is so much flavor in the concentrate, juice, and zest. I may try again, but it will be awhile before I make it through this batch...

This is amazing.....I made a batch of this last night and of course had to try it. The flavors really are incredible together.....cant wait for my yogurt this morning with this in it! My only change was to use canola oil instead of veg oil and I also decreased to 2 tblspns. instead of 1/4c.  This just reminds me of summer! Great job Larspur....I love it and thanks!  :)

This is yum-yummy! I've made more granola recipes than I can count. I may be having a love affair with oats. :) This is one of the best. It's not my MAIN granola, because of the extra flavors. But, that's what makes this one so nice. Perfect balance of dry to wet ingredients. Perfect balance of lime/coconut/almond flavors against the oats. Just gotta say... very impressive recipe.

Good! My first attemped at making granola and we really liked it :). I used quick cooking oats  , ground flax seeds and sweetened coconut (that's what I had). Not too sweet just perfect. Thanks larkspur. Elvira Silva.
