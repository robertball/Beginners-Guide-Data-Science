Easy recipe, but I would suggest almond extract instead of (or in addition to) the vanilla.  I used both because in my mind coconut macaroons should taste almond-y.  Also, these were more like merangues with coconut in them.  For a chewier, more macaroon-like cookie, use more coconut!  With those changes, I'd rate these a 4-star cookie.

If served in France, you would be in the Bastille.  It doesn't even resemble a macaroon!
