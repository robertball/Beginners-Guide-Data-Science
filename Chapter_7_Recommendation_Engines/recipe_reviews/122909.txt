Decadent! I served this for a dinner party and everyone absolutely loved it. BUT a word or warning -- this is not an easy recipe. I would say it is at least an intermediate recipe. Some reviewers have reported consistency problems and there are many ways I can see that having happened, even following the instructions, because there are a few details the recipe leaves out. First: to properly whip heavy whipping cream, start with a chilled mixing bowl and whip it until it is a very fluffy, almost buttery consistency. Do not stop mixing too soon. We used a hand held electric mixer to do this. Second, the proper way to melt chocolate is *slowly*! If you don't have a double boiler, I recommend using a saucepan on the stove over low heat. This will take a while, but the microwave can actually be a harder way to melt chocolate because you have to be careful not to do it too quickly and you have to take it out many times to stir. I also want to emphasize the importance of getting the temperatures right...try to follow these to the letter. I highly recommend having a candy thermometer to get the eggs, sugar, and water to exactly 160 degrees. Finally, I just thought I'd mention that we added some chunks of high quality milk chocolate and a sprinkle of powdered sugar for a nice presentation and a good compliment to the dish.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I deviated slightly in three ways.  1)  While whipping the cream, I added a bit of unflavored gelatin.  This merely gives the whipping cream better consistency and permits the dessert longer refrigerator life.  When I write "bit," I mean perhaps half a little package.  I never know; I just add it. If you've ever been to Europe, especially Eastern Europe, the bakeries often use the gelatin in their creams.  2)  I added a "bit" of vanilla after combining the chocolate and egg mixtures.  3)  Rather than stirring over ice, I put the chocolate mixture in the freezer for five minutes, took it out, stirred, returned it to the freezer for another five minutes, took it out, and combined with the whipping cream.

I was looking through recipes for something healthy and nutritious but got a little distracted thinking of chocolate mousse and ended up here again. I noticed that EXACTLY 2 years ago I had reviewed this recipe when I made it for my boyfriend. That boyfriend, who is now my husband, has been asking me to make this chocolate mousse again. We are expecting our first child anyday now and as soon as baby is born, we will be having this mousse to celebrate (can't eat it now because of the partially cooked eggs!) This recipe is a keeper! And was very memorable for my husband :)

I LOVE THIS RECIPE. I used it to fill a chocolate cake. The only change I made was that I used 1/2 cup strong, cold coffee instead of water. It really amps up the chocolate flavor without adding a coffee taste.

I made this and froze it in Zip locks ahead of time for a wedding shower. It was amazing! I defrosted in the fridge and simple snipped the corner of the bag and squeezed into crepes and covered with fresh strawberries and whip cream!
What a hit!

Definitely a keeper. I made mine with strong coffee instead of water, and I added a tad of vanilla to the whipping cream as well. Top it off with homemade whipped cream and some raspberries, and you'll feel like you've died and gone to heaven.

A wonderful recipe! The measurements seem to use an odd amount of ingredients, so I modified the proportions. I used 1 bag of semisweet chocolate morsels, 3 T of butter, 4 T of sugar, 2/3 cups water, yolks from 5 medium eggs and 1 pint of whipping cream. Whatever chocolate you use comes out very strongly in the finished product, so a good quality chocolate is key. I am already fantasizing how next time I will try white chocolate, or perhaps milk chocolate. Thanks for a great fattening recipe!

I made this as a dessert to follow my 1 year anniversary dinner. It is amazing!  It is also very rich.  I've got a sweet tooth, so I didn't mind.  My husband, on the other hand isn't normally a dessert person.  He'd take a bite and say how rich and filling it was, but he never put his spoon down! He scraped the insides of the glass with it, in fact.  I take that as a compliment coming from him.  For someone else who asked, I did make it with milk chocolate. I used plain old Hershey's bars actually.  It turned out really good and you could really tell it was Hershey's.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I spooned it into martini glasses, piped whipped cream on top using the star tip, and I used a little more melted chocolate to make little xoxo's to stick down in the cream.  It was beautiful and elegant.

I made this mousse for my family and everyone loved it. It's relatively easy to make too! It's very rich, so it's a little hard to eat all of it at one time. The only change i made to this recipe was adding vanilla to the whipping cream before whipping it. In my opinion, it's best served by itself with a dollop of whipped cream on top.

I love this mousse! I've made it quite a few times already, but I just got around to reviewing it.  I keep the ingredients as is, everything is perfect as written. Here are a few tips I found out along the way though: When you put the egg yolks in the saucepan, you will want to watch it very carefully! They really only need a low heat and you are better off to whisk them continuously until they are a fluffy froth. If you don't watch it then they will turn into scrambled eggs rather quickly. I also bypass the whole saucepan and ice step by putting the saucepan in the freezer for 5 minutes, giving it a stir, another 5 minutes in the freezer, and one last stir. I use 2 small containers (yogurt cup sized) of heavy cream. I save 1/4 of the cream to layer it with the mousse. This tastes sensational! It looks beautiful and elegant in glasses with the layered look as well.  My husband and kids get all excited when they find out that we are having this for dessert! Of course the chef (me) gets the extra portion of mousse. :) Thanks so much for this recipe, it is one of my favorites! I highly recommend it as it is quick, easy, delicious, and fit for company!

this was delightful! I made this for our dessert when we had some company over for dinner... made that morning so it sat in the fridge all day.
I melted the chocolate slowly in a saucepan on the stove on very low heat, stirring constantly. I had my big mixing bowl chilled in the freezer, so I used that for when I whipped the whipping cream. I whipped it on the 'high' setting for at least 8-10 min, not stopping once. I then seperated the egg yolks, and whisked it in a bowl with the sugar and some cold coffee, and a 'dash' of vanilla like others suggested (omitted the water), before adding it to the pot so the yolks didn't turn scrambl-y on me. I whisked it on med-high continuously and it became a frothy mixture (smells goood! with the coffee and the sugar and vanilla). I then added the choc. to it, stirrred well, then put the saucepan in my fridge for 5 min., came back, whisked it some more.. put it back in .. put some laundry in the dryer, came back, whisked it again, then added it to the whipping cream bowl and used the beaters on high for another few minutes... flufffyyy! 
come dessert time I put the mousse into martini glasses, sprinkled some icing sugar lightly overtop, and put a few raspberries ontop of each glass with some chocolate mint leave things I had in the freezer. my company was super impressed with the mousse, and the presentation. and it was easy!!, just follow some key steps as others mentioned  :))))

If you're a chocolate lover, this recipe is for you!  However, I would offer a word of caution to not stray from the cooking instructions!  I've made this mousse twice, and the first attempt was a disaster.  I followed one reviewer's advice to cook the egg mixture slowly, but apparently I wasn't slow enough.  The heat was just slightly too high and it cooked too quickly, which led to little chunks of scrambled egg in the mousse.  Not only did it throw off the flavor, but it was detrimental to the texture.  I gave this recipe another try because it was so highly rated, and I made sure to use a candy thermometer and did my best to NOT go over 160 degrees when cooking the egg mixture.  Everything was excellent!  Great texture and taste!  I'm glad I gave it a second try!

This was a really great recipe!  I made this yesterday for my boyfriend who is preeeetty picky when it comes to sweets, and he really loved it! (As did I!) I did not measure the temp of the eggs while cooking them, I just wanted for them to thicken up. Once that happened, I knew I was golden!  Also, I used a make-shift double-boiler (a pan and a metal bowl) and the chocolate melted perfectly (I did NOT put in the 1/4 cup of water while melting the chocolate, just the butter)  Also, I used heavy cream instead of whipping cream as the store didn't have any, but I had no problems at all. (I did chill the beater, bowl, and the cream very well)  My boyfriend and I came to the conclusion last night that using all semi-sweet chocolate made it a little bit too bitter for us, so I re-made the whole thing today (I also doubled the recipe with no problems), but I used half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate, and from what I can see, it came out awesome!  I was going to give this a 4/5 stars, but I realized that it wasn't the recipe itself that took a star away, it was the way the instructions were written.  The recipe itself was awesome!  My tips:  -ONLY put water into the eggs, NOT the chocolate, as long as you are melting it on a double boiler -Chill the beater, bowl, and cream well -Stir the eggs constantly while cooking them (I used a rubber spatula so I could scrape along the bottom of the pan really good)

This is an amazing treat.  I followed some advice and whipped the cream in a chilled mixing bowl and couldn't believe the difference it made in the texture.  I also used a candy thermometer.  I will make this again and again.

I am twelve and i have cooked this recipe twice for my family. Everyone absalutly LOVED it!! Super duper good! I doubled the recipe and used the microwave to melt the chocolate and butter. Also, instead of putting the sausepan on ice and stirring it i put it in the freezer for 5 mins, stirred it, and put it back in the freezer for 5 mins. Was fantastic!!!

I just made this recipe tonight for a co-worker's birthday tomorrow.  I made a few modifications and thought it turned out rich and delicious.  First, I doubled the recipe to serve 12.  I used one 10 oz bag of Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate.  I did add 1/4 cup of water to the chips and eggs.  I used a glass bowl and set it over a pot of simmering water.  As stated by another reviewer, simmer the water on low and let the chocolate, butter and water melt SLOWLY.  Then set it aside.  As for the whipping cream, I used heavy cream.  I added about 1/4 cup or so of sugar into the cream and 2 tsp. vanilla.  Remember, I doubled this recipe.  In the saucepan with the egg yolks, I added the sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I did not add the full amount of water to the yolk mixture.  Probably 2 TBSP.  I whisked the egg yolk mixture and continued to whisk it over medium heat for 2 minutes.  This was the trickest part b/c I didn't have a candy thermometer.  When the eggs were done, I added it to the melted chocolate.  I used a larger bowl filled half way w/ice and water and placed the combined chocolate and yolk inside of it.  I then mixed it w/mixer until it cooled.  Folded in 3/4 of the 2 1/2 cups of whipped cream and reserved the rest for the top.  Hope this helped you all.  It takes a bit more time then expected.

Great texture.  Far too sweet.  I omitted a third of the sugar and will be reducing that again next time.  However, there will be a next time!!

Heavenly is right!  Very heavy chocolate flavor.  I did use coffee instead of the water when melting the chocolate and added a tsp vanilla and some unflavored gelatin to the whipped topping part, as suggested by others.  As if this wasn't decadent enough, I added in skor's pieces and then served this layered over kahlua soaked fudge brownies, topped with whipped cream and sprinkles of heath bits on top of it all. Added this mousse to my  personal death by chocolate collection!  Lukewarm bath water is about 105 deg.  160 deg (in my make do way) is when you skick your finger in it and you aren't burnt but you want to pull it out right away.  It worked out just fine and took about 5 or 7 minutes.

This is fabulous! Read Christine's review - the first one. It does take some work and more time than I thought to get the egg yolk mixture to 160°. I volunteer at a hospice as a cook and I made this and Cheese Souffles today (another AR recipe) and our residents really enjoyed both! This is rich and, indeed, heavenly! The egg yolk mixture gets very, very thick so those folks that commented that their mousse wasn't thick enough hadn't cooked the egg yolks enough. Keep the temperature low and keep stirring it (I used a whisk). I will make this again when I want to treat someone. It's definitely an indulgence!

My niece requested I make chocolate mousse for Christmas dessert and said she would be happy with the cool whip powder pudding mix recipe. I wasn't. I tried this one and was not disappointed. I did follower some advice from other viewers by chilling my metal mixing bowl & beaters and adding 1/2 of small pkg unflavored gelatin for the whipping cream. I also added vanilla to the chocolate mixture then cooled it in the freezer for 5 minutes, stirred it, freezer for 5 minutes, then stirred in whipped whipping cream. My niece said it was heavenly!!!! Thanks for sharing!

SOOOOO good!  Next time I'm going to use milk chocolate because the semi-sweet was slightly bitter to me.  I melted the chocolate mixture in the microwave while I whipped the cream.  I transferred the cream to the fridge and cooked the eggs while the chocolate cooled.  Make sure you wisk the egg mixture nonstop while heating it over VERY LOW heat.  As soon as it starts to smell like cooking eggs, it is done.  If you follow the directions, the consistency is perfect and the taste is amazing!!  Also, definitely let it set up overnight for best texture.

Sooo good! My problem with mousse is always that it's not perfectly smooth at the end. A couple suggestions in case you have the same issue...pour the egg mixture through a sieve before adding it to the chocolate. Also, while it's cooling in an ice bath, stir frequently so that the chocolate on the sides of the bowl don't harden. Great flavor! I use it as a filling in my cakes. Thanks for sharing!

Exactly what I wanted in a chocolate mousse. Nice rich chocolate flavor. Seems like it would be overkill to just eat it on its own which is why I made it for a chocolate cake but i guess if you're a chocoholic you would! FYI: when I first made this it seems super thin but after refrigeration it firmed up nicely (to those who are concerned with the consistency right after its made).

love this recipe...and one of the reviews said that it has partially cooked eggs...Actually as long as the eggs are cooked to exactly 160 degrees they are not undercooked at all, chicken including eggs needs to be at 160 degrees to be cooked just right.  so go ahead and indulge pregnant ladies! (I am a chef so I know temperatures!!!)

Quick and easy mousse.  Very tasty.    A bit rich (as if that's a downside with chocolate mousse), it's also slightly thicker than I was looking for.  Two suggestions I'd make:  1) Whip a little more cream than the suggested measure. 2) Save a little bit of crumbled chocolate.  Fold some into the mousse after the cream to provide a little texture, then sprinkle a little on whatever whipped cream you top it with for taste and presentation.

At first I wasn't sure it was all going to firm up, because before I put in the fridge, it looked like chocolate soup. But after 7 hours, it was very firm, but fluffy. Topped with additional whipped cream. And I used Ghiaredelli milk chocolate squares.

I've now made this several times and its AMAZING!!! A definite favorite for dinner parties or just a fancy dessert for me and my boyfriend.

Though, while whipping the cream it is best to do it in a chilled bowl. I let my bowl sit in the freezer for a while before whipping the cream, and just to make sure it stays cold I place that bowl into a bowl of ice. The cooler the better for the best texture.

OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!  So, so, awesome.  Please try this recipe you will not be sad at all, you will be jumping for joy.  I made these for a small Christmas Eve dinner, and everyone loved them.  Only thing use your own homemade whipped cream, also I had to stir my egg yolk mixture to get to around 160 degrees for about 5 minutes on low.

Absolutely loved this recipe! Wouldn't change a thing. The only thing I noticed is that the egg mixture took longer than 1-2 minutes to thicken to 160 degrees. Also, anyone who hasn't made mousse before, the temperature has to be near perfect. Any hotter than 160 and you risk curdling the eggs.

I usually don't have time to write reviews but I just had to for this.  I hesitated in making it because it sounded time consuming but it was actually very easy and so delicious.  It came out the perfect texture and flavor.  I had to use cool whip instead of the whipping cream because I decided to make it at the last minute but it worked great so if you are in a time pinch, that is a great time saving step.  Can't wait to try it with the real thing!

I don't know what I did wrong b/c mine was the consistancey of a melted milkshake.  My egg combo did get away from me as I had some tiny pieces of scramble eggs.  The flavor was good though.

Excellent!  You need to be sure to completely melt the chocolate (and I used bittersweet Ghiradelli, not semisweet).  Very rich, tasty desert.

This mousse turns out to be very rich. Its by far the best mousse I have ever had. Please do read other comments for other tips that are overseen in the recipe. The cream needs to be over whipped. Love this recipe, my boyfriend loved it.

Everyone at the table loved this.

I like that the recipe has you heat the yolks, some recipes I've used don't and I don't feel comfortable serving raw egg--especially to elderly relatives.

I used 8 oz of ghiradelli semisweet chocolate and found the mixture not quite sweet enough, so I upped the sugar to 3 tblsps. I also sub-ed 1/4 cup dark coffee for part of the water. And added 1/2 tsp vanilla for additional flavor.

Excellent mousse. Turned out great. I added 1 tblsp instant coffee grounds to water to give it a cappachino flavor. Putting metal bowl and beaters in freezer before using will give your whipping cream the right consistency. Big hit at my daughter's birthday party. We served over brownie and added a fresh raspberry to each serving.

Great recipe. I used a 8 oz. of whipping cream as it comes in either a 1/2 pint (8 oz.) or 1 pint (16 oz.) and I did not want all the waste.  It worked great - was a stronger chocolate flavor than if using the 1 1/4 cup of whipping cream.

I used Ghirardeli semi-sweet chocolate chips (instead of chopped bars) and I would agree with the reviewer who said the quality of the chocolate is key. Use something that is worth tasting. I also used a little unflavored gelatin in my whipped cream and it gave it a nice smooth consistency. I don't own a candy thermometer so I somewhat guessed on the temperature of the egg yolks--when it starts to feel a little hot on your finger, it's time to remove it from the heat. Make sure you don't remove it too soon though. 
I plan to top it with fresh sliced strawberries and serve it alongside homemade vanilla ice cream. This recipe is decadent and FANTASTIC--totally worth the extra calories.

I am 7 months pregnant and I was craving mousse. This was an amazing recipe. I made it exactly as it was written. I was worried about the chocolate seizing up because of the water; but it had no trouble. Also I read some reviews that said the texture is off, I think this could be due to not whipping the cream long enough. Mine came out amazingly fluffy. When my husband gets home (military) I will be making this for us. Thank you again :)

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out 
perfect. Was very simple to make :) Little bit of fresh whip cream and a strawberry were the perfect match for appeal to both the eye and the taste buds :) I think next time I will try it with Raspberry Puree. One thing is for certain, there will be a next time.

This is the easiest mousse I've ever made. Smooth, creamy and chocolatey.  I did goof and add all the water in with the chocolate, so I just put a teensy bit in with the eggs. Easy, and forgiving!
*Update* I have made this numerous times, and once did get the dreaded "cooked egg bits", but have had great success otherwise, using different types of chocolate and combinations of chocolate: milk, bittersweet, semi-sweet, and the huge package of double chocolate Ghiardelli that Sam's Club sold last Christmas. My next attempt will be Ghiardelli white "chocolate".  I believe the candy thermometer is essential, but now as another reviewer suggested, I strain the chocolate mixture before folding in the whipped cream, just in case. Today, this will fill the center of my chocolate cake, baked with the Wilton heart Tasty-fill pan I just picked up on Valentine's Day clearance. I wanted to give it a try before I pull it out next Valentine's Day.

The first time I made this, it had some chunks of scrambled egg in it.  I overcooked the yolks.  The second time, I whisked the yolks, sugar, and water for 1 minute before putting it on the heat.  I continued to stir it until it reached 150 degrees.  Then I followed the directions from there.  It was a perfect filling for a chocolate chocolate chip cake!

This was decent but not heavenly. I would use milk chocolate next time, or a combination of that and bittersweet maybe. I didn't care for the semisweet taste. This had a nice consistency though. I used an instant-read digital thermometer to check the temperature of the egg mixture while cooking. I used a bowl of ice water with about two trays worth of cubes and set the pan in that. Within less than ten minutes the mixture was getting almost too thick -- so it sped up the time in a big way. This recipe will remain in my recipe box but I'll keep looking to get the quality of a mousse from a restaurant where I had "heavenly" chocolate mousse: Chez Francois.

It took me awhile to get the egg yolks to 160 degrees. When they did, they were cooked and curdled.

Absolutely delicious! I followed some of the high-rated recommendations and: -Used cold coffee instead of water -Used a candy thermometer to get exactly 160 F -Used a chilled dish for the whipped cream  Also, since I used very coarse-grained sugar (organic brown sugar), I added 1/8 tsp cream of tartar.

this chocolate mousse is soooo awesome!! however, you have be very careful with the eggyolk mixture, make sure you use a cooking termometer and be very careful with the heat. try to whipped your cream before you prepare the chocolate and egg mixture, it will be a lot easy to mix the lot together.  nevertheless.... this is a GREAT recipe! a must try...

This was a fantastic recipe!  I didn't follow the directions completely. I still had a log of Bernard Callebaut chocolate in the freezer and thought I'd use it for this recipe - I have no idea how much chocolate it was exactly. Oh my heavens, the end result was phenomenal.  Now that I'd spoiled myself I don't think I can go back to a cheap chocolate mousse.

Oh my GOODNESS this is to die for! This is not the knock off cool whip mixed with chocolate pudding mix that some places try to pawn off as chocolate mousse. Smooth, firm texture. A couple of tips: whip the cream in a frozen glass bowl, and use a candy thermometer to get your yolks to exactly 160, whisking often. Any higher than that and they will start to solidify and chunk up. I also mixed in crushed up heath bar bits. Next time I will try substituting coffee for the water as others have suggested.

I was looking for a low-sugar dessert to make for my father-in-law since he is borderline diabetic and can't have the sinful stuff I make for everyone else. I followed the recipe but substituted the sugar with Splenda and it turned out just as delicious! Also used Ghirardelli semisweet chocolate and microwaved on high for 1 minute (along with the water). It's now is favorite dessert! Thanks for the great recipe!

Bold, unapologetic, chocolaty decadence! This isn’t your mom’s weak, runny, diet, packaged mousse. This is real calories mixed with more calories and topped with just a few more calories, for good measure. Sweet, delicious calories… Mmm. I followed the recipe instructions exactly, and subbed semisweet for a 70% cocoa dark Belgium chocolate. I had a bit of an issue with cooking the egg yolks for 1-2 minutes. It took me more like 10 minutes, but I was doing it over a double boiler, so that is likely why! It’s sooooo rich, you’re going to want to layer it with something. Like whipped cream! Or brownies. Or, you know, more calories.

I thought the recipe was excellent and it was a huge hit at my dinner party. I did add vanilla into the whipped cream as the other reviewer suggested and I found it took me longer to get the yolk mixture to temperature, so leave yourself a bit more time when creating this dessert. In a stemmed glass topped with fresh whipped cream and a fanned strawberry it was very elegant and delicious.

This was not what i expected at all the flavor was ok but not at all what i was hoping for. I defiantly would add some vanilla in with the cream before you whip it, I think that was one thing that was really missing. I may try this again. ****Update*****So years later I came across this recipe again. Didn't realize that I had made it before when I planned it for dessert. Now it may have been my inexperience at this kind of thing the first time around, but tonight it was fantastic! I did add some vanilla to the whipping cream. Very rich dessert and so pretty served in wine glasses topped with whipped cream. Thanks!

AMAZING! This is the most decadant mousse ever! Definitly the best recipe! My husband requests this on a monthly basis. Make sure you follow the directions closely though. You must use a heat thermoter for the eggs to get it right. You can add a shot of espresso with the chocolate too and it's delicious. Use good chocolate it's the Key. I use Ghirardelli semi sweet.

This was a wonderful treat. Thanks to the reviewers before me on helpful tips to make this work out. I subsituted 1/2 semi-sweet chocolate w/ milk chocolate. Used coffee not water; and served w/ rasberies and a tiny bit of powdered sugar, although it certainly didn't need any extra sugar. My guests loved it.

This mousse was my first try at any mousse,I stuck exactly to the recipe provided apart from replacing the 1/2 cup of water with a 1/2 cup of expresso,the family loved it and I too as well,however the expresso taste was rather strong slighty over powering the chocolate so next time i will try something  different

Turned out really good, perfectly chocolatey. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because I ran into difficulty with the egg yolk step and ended up scrambling two batches before I got it right. I don't know how crucial the yolks are to the recipe, but I don't like the idea of having uncooked eggs in my mousse. I may try this again and leave them out.

OMG, I just made this for our thanksgiving feast today.  I was spooning it right out of the pan it was so delicious.  I used half dark and half milk chocolate.  I used a pan of boiling water on the stove with another smaller pan inside because I didn't have the right equipment.  I added a cap full of vanilla to the egg mixture. I added two tablespoons of powdered sugar and half teaspoon of cinnamon to the whipping cream as I was whipping (my favorite from another recipe).  I folded in slowly and put it all in graham cracker pie crust.  I think I should have probably added gellatin or reduced the cream but it seems to be setting quite well on it's own. It is absolutely delicous, I will be making this every year as a family favorite from now on.  Thanks for all the comments about watching the egg mixture, it was really helpful.

It was very good...next time I will try using a higher end chocolate and see if it makes it even better. Oh, and make a ton of extra whipped cream...it really made a difference (since it is such a rich dessert!)

Very rich, not sure if I did something wrong though because it came out a bit gritty...may just have been I used the wrong chocolate as I had to use morsels of semi-sweet.

It was the best chocolate dessert I have ever made. However there is liquid formed at the bottom, leaving no. Much solidified mousse to eat...  I hope I know what I am doing wrong....

This recipe was amazing! It was very rich, but thoroughly whipping the cream made it quite light and fluffy. My little sister sold dixie cups of the mousse topped with whipped cream and cookie crumbs at a lemonade sale and it was a big hit! I will definitely be making it again.

This recipe was delish!!! i had some whipped heavy cream already in my fridge and wanted to use it up and found this recipe.  I added about a tsp of vanilla and a little more sugar to the end product since I only had about 6 baking squares in my pantry and it needed to be sweeter, but those are the only modifications I made, i followed everything else to the T and it came out perfect!!!! will definitely make again and again! Thanks for the recipe :-)

I thought this was a great recipe!  I made it for my family and they loved it.  I crushed up oreos and put some of them in the bottom of the dessert bowl, then put in a scoop of the mousse, then sprinkled another layer of oreo, then a dollop of cool whip, and then sprinkled more oreo crumble on top.  It was delicious!

Delicious, but HEAVY. Could only eat a couple bites before putting down the spoon. Might use it to fill a cake, though. It's heavy enough to hold up under the weight.

As is, this dessert is good, but seems to lack something, I did double the ingredients, so maybe that played a part.    Though I know after folding in the whipped cream, I tried a taste from what was left and it was extremely bland and might be what contributed to it.    I added a table spoon of sugar and a cap full of vanilla to what remained of the whipped cream and used as a topping along with melting some of the extra chocolate to drizzle on top.  I highly recommend jazzing up the whipped cream while whipping.

Heavenly Chocolate Mousse is to die for.  Made the mousse then piped into some chocolate shot glass size cups - they were an absolute hit at our Women's Christmas Fellowship.   Followed recipe without any changes.

All I can say is WOW!!  I'm not a big fan of dessert but thought I'd give it a try. It was extremely rich and had an awesome texture. I am making it again tonight as a pie on a chocolate crust topped with Blue berries and Raspberries in a simple syrup and whipped cream.

This dessert is the perfect ending to a heavy meal (or any meal really)!!! I pipped the mousse into a margarita glass using a large star tip and it looked Amazing! I served with some raspberries coated in white sugar.

This is going to be incredible!  I made it with peppermint stick coffee (Cameron's - leftover from Christmas), and the taste is to die for.  But you won't want to.  I'm serving it tomorrow night after ribs, corn salad and potato salad.  It worked perfectly, and I was surprised at how the chocolate held together even when I added water to it.  The wonders of butter!

I thought this was wonderful, the first time I made it I didn't use a good quality of chocolate and it didn't melt well. But tried it again with good chocolate and it was great, only thing I changed is I added a bit more chocolate than it said, I used 3 ounces as I like things chocolatey. Will definetly make again, might try adding some liquer to the mousse.

holy moley...this is outstanding!! It is SO easy to make, it takes absolutely no talent...just the time and willingness to stand and stir. We do not like dark chocolate so I used 1 cup of Hershey's milk chocolate cips. Per other reviews, I also mixed some leftover coffee in with the water. It took about 10 minutes on my stove for the egg mixture to get around 160 degrees.  This is true chocolate mousse!!!!

Rich...but HEAVEN! I actually made some chocolate muffin cups (melted Hershey kisses and painted the insides of muffin liners, refrigerated, filled in sparse spots and put in fridge overnight then peeled off paper), filled them with piped in mousse and topped with sliced strawberries. Everyone LOVED it! Plus, you get to eat the chocolate cup after!

This recipe was great!  It takes quite a bit of work, but worth every bite!  I used giradelli chocolate chips and it was great.  Next time I will try milk chocolate as I am sure that will be great too.  I recommend the candy thermometer as others did.  I served this inside a small homemade waffle cup, with a sliced strawberry spear and a dollup of fresh whipped cream.  Beautiful and delicious!

This was an easy and PERFECT recipe. Follow the instructions exactly and you will be rewarded with a fluffy and fabulous chocolate mousse. I am making mousse martinis for a dessert bar for 75 so I made a trial run at preparing it in advance. I put the mousse in a ziplock bag before the refrigeration step. A few hours later, cut off the corner and swirled into martini glasses for dessert that night. My husband was more than willing to be a taste-tester. Left the remainder in the fridge for 3 days then served again and it held perfectly. No breakdown of the fluff or separation. Two-thumbs up!

I have a very watery chocolate mousse for my son's birthday tomorrow - I can't imagine that it will firm up in the refrigerator :(  I wish the direction were as thorough as the reviews, which mentioned about wisking the whipping cream, but I'm not sure it would have made a difference.  I could not fold the whipping cream into the chocolate mixture, it just took over the whole chocolate mixture.  Oh well.  I'll try something else tomorrow.

Made this for Valentine's Day ~  DELICIOUS!  My husband and I made dinner together as I was sick, and it was better than going out :)  We both L O V E mousse and have shied away from making it because of raw eggs/difficult recipes.  This is so incredibly rich and delicious - we followed recipe to a T and topped with whipped cream.  I think next time I would maybe try a different chocolate - maybe some milk AND semisweet, or as someone else mentioned, white chocolate.   This is a keeper!  Really worth trying for  a special treat.   Enjoy!

I had been making a different mousse recipe for a while and came across this one. Thought to try it out for a change. The yolks definitely give it more body - which was a nice surprise. I also didn't have a candy thermometer, and did like another poster - trying to eye when it got custardy, seemed to work, but I was really nervous that I'd mess it up. I also, put it in the freezer for 5 min, stirred, put it back for 5 min, and stirred again - that definitely made it simpler - especially in the wee hours of the morning.

Absolutely delicious. Definitely need to use the candy thermometer though or wait until the egg mixture is thickened; it took much longer than "1-2 minutes" for me.Whipping the cream in a chilled bowl is really important too and not necessarily something a beginner would know. Super recipe--thanks! Can't wait to serve this!

This was amazing. I made it exactly as written and it came out fluffy and rich. It tasted EXACTLY like a dessert called Bete Noire (Dark Beast) that I had as a child at a fancy French restaurant. Delicious! It sent me right back to my childhood. I'll absolutely make it again.

I bought a candy thermometer just for this per another reviews suggestion and very thankful i did.  It turned out PERFECT, and I'm a complete novice.  Take your time and do it right and this is an amazingly decadent dessert anyone would love.

OMG This is heaven on a spoon!  It is better the next day as others suggested - but who can wait that long?  I ate one the day they were made AND one the next day. . . I did over beat the whip cream but it didn't affect the flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

I have made this recipe a few times with good results. I wanted to increase the amount so I used a 12oz bag of semisweet chips, 3 Tbsp butter, 3/4 cup water, 3 Tbsp sugar and 3cups heavy cream. I added 1 tsp vanilla to the chocolate mixture. I also added 1-2 Tbsp sugar to the whipped cream, optional. It came out excellent and made at least 10 servings.

Made this for Valentine's Day.  I thought it was very easy to make and the results were wonderful.  The only change I made was to substitute a 1/4 cup of Amaretto instead of water in the egg yolk mixture.  Delicious!  I served in martini glasses with fresh whipped cream and fresh raspberries.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good. I used the chocolate I had on hand which was half bakers semisweet and half bakers german chocolate. This mousse was very good and very chocolatey. I layered with cool whip to tone it down a bit. Next time I will use all german chocolate so it won't be so strong. Also, crushed thin mints in the bottom of the serving dish is a nice addition.

The taste of this mousse was fabulous!  The texture, however, was not quite as creamy as I'd hoped.  Once it set in the fridge for over 4 hours, it became kind of spongy (airy).  This was remedied, however, by giving it a good stir. So the only change I would make next time is I would not serve into the individual dishes until I am about to serve to guests.  That way I can stir it all up to restore creaminess, then serve in individual dishes.

This mousse was easy and came out delicious, fluffy (key is to chill and fold). I would make this again for a dinner party or even a night in on the couch. Only 30 minutes to make.

This is delicious! I am taking it to christmas evce with the family we will see what they say. It is a little strong on the chocolate flavor I might try milk and semi chocolate next time. I had a big problem witht the eggs, must stir constantly on low-med low heat. DO NOT LOOK AWAY. I had to do the eggs 3x's to get it right. Taste great but small helping otherwise overpowering and I LOVE semisweet choc.

I needed a "not so sweet, heavy on the chocolate decadence" dessert to serve with a Port (wine).  THIS WAS IT!   I served it at a food and wine pairing class.  I "piped" on to white "won ton soup" spoons and topped them off with a raspberry.  The hit of the evening!  Not a drop left!

its brilliant!absolutely fantabulous...and the perfect filling for a dark chocolate cake!
infact i made an ice cream dessert by putting one layer of dark chocolate cake (broken into chunks),then a layer of chocolate mousse,again cake(repeat as many times as you wish) and finally, one really good and thick layer of vanilla ice cream!and finally i froze the entire dessert for atleast an hour before serving.
i got the most amazing reviews for this from my friends!
UPDATE : 26/12/2009 : the given measurements do not suffice for 6 servings so double the ingredients to serve for about 8 people. also, for the given chocolate measure, I used 8 small square of cooking chocolate but only 'coz I love my mousse deliciously chocolatey! And when folding in the whipped cream, do it very gently!

ABSOLUTELY DIVINE!!! I made this to fill a chocolate cake and it was beyond wonderful! I did use cold coffee in place of the water and it really brought out the flavor of the chocolate without having a coffee taste. I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!!! Thanks for sharing it!!!!!

All I can say is, WOW! Rich and creamy... delicious! The only thing I did differently was halving the recipe (I used 2 smallish egg yolks) and used half milk chocolate melts and half Lindt 70% cocoa chocolate. Very nice!! =D

I used coffee instead of water and added vanilla to the whipped cream. I made it in the morning, let it sit all day in the fridge and it was a 4* that night. The remaining one got eaten the next night and it was a 5*. So definately let sit until the next day!

Very light and delicious. First time I made them I didn't whip the cream enough so the mousse had too much liquid in it. It was still tasty though.  I made this again tonight and whipped the cream for a good 14 minutes.  This time it turned out perfect.  I'm serving this as a light dessert for a small gathering tomorrow evening.  I think it'll be good topped with cool whip.

I made this for my boyfriend, who is a total chocolate addict, and he loved it. In fact he ate one of the extra servings I had made for breakfast the morning after I served it. One tip, make sure to serve this in small portions, because if the portion is too big, the chocolate is a bit overwhelming.

I used this recipe to make chocolate mousse cups for my wedding reception. It was a remarkable success! Everyone enjoyed them so much, not only did I not get a cup, but the whole batch was gone that fed 300 people! This mousse is by far the best I have ever done! 5 Stars!!!

The flavor is amazing! Rich and keeps your mouth watering for more. 
One word of caution about heating the egg yolks. It's better to use a metal thermometer instead of a candy thermometer. The metal thermometer will measure the temperature more accurately. 
Also, keep stirring the egg mixture over heat otherwise the bottom layer may start cooking. When that happens, the bottom cooked egg layer will be at a different temperature than the uncooked top layer. Don't be fooled into thinking the temperature isn't hot enough!

Though I've ate mousse several times, this was my first attempt at making it myself.  I did as other reviewers suggested and substituted cold coffee for the water.  All-in-all, the recipe was as good as I had hoped it would be, and my guests all liked it!

A note on the egg mixture you have to cook on the stove - when it got up to 160 degrees, it turned from a runny liquid to a very frothy texture.  I'm guessing that's what you should look for if you don't have a thermometer.

This was my first time ever making my own whipped cream as well as chocolate mousse.  Complete success.  I followed the directions exactly and it came out wonderfully.  Next time I might add just a little vanilla extract and sugar to the whipping cream before whipping, just to sweeten it up a touch.  Made this for a dinner and a movie night with another couple and it was great.  I'm going to have to make it again soon.  Maybe with strawberry or raspberry syrup drizzled on top.  Thanks for an easy and great recipe.

Made this for work...It was dip day...I actually brought marshmallows, pretzels, and nilla wafers for people to dip with. It was a huge hit!  Tastes like chocolate ice cream!

I took this to my Aunty's and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved it, I ate about 15 scoops, it was that good!!! I didn't have ice at the time but I just used cold water and a freezer block in a bowl and it worked just as well.

Pretty good, I used this for a chocolate cake with home made whipped cream on top. Not sure the consistency came out right but none the less it tasted good.

I forgot this was on the stove and managed to cook the yolks and nearly burn the chocolate, and it was STILL delicious (after a bit of straining, of course--yuck cooked yolk bits!). I can't think of a more decadent dessert than this mousse topped with fresh whipped cream and some shaved chocolate.

I did not find it easy to make. After it set in the freezer it came out more gelato-y than mousse-like. Even after LOTS of whipping, there was nothing fluffy about it. But it could have been preparer error ...

This is an excellent recipe and was perfect for what I used it for (a filling for cream puffs).  Nice and light. If I were going to serve a mousse as a standalone dessert, I think I would look for another recipe that produced a more dense mousse.

I loved this recipe! Made it when family came over for dinner and even though we were stuffed from our main course, this dessert had a place in everyone's stomach! Next time I may use milk chocolate chips instead because semi-sweet sort of gives it a bitter taste. I also put in a Cadbury Flake dipped in half-way. This recipe is easy and a keeper!

This was a bit too much like a pudding and not like a mousse. Maybe the cream makes it too heavy, I will try it with less cream next time. The taste was great though.

This is a tricky recipe if cooking with out a thermometer to get the temp on the eggs, if you over heat the eggs you end up with cooked egg bits in your otherwise smooth mousse. After the second attempt I was able to make it perfect. It's really rich and worth the extra effort over the "quick and easy" alternative recipes that call for using pudding mix.

I made this recipe twice.  The first time, I accidentally overcooked the eggs so there were tiny chunks of egg in the final product, still tasted amazing!  second time i made this, I used half white chocolate chips and half dark chocolate chips, and like other reviews, added vanilla to the cream.  Also, I put the mousse into a graham cracker or vanilla wafer crust and then top it with whipped cream..... AWESOME!!! Go make this now!

Not sure of these instructions.  I keep reading that you can't add water to melting chocolate or it will seize, and this recipe calls for water & butter with the chocolate.  I tried it the way the recipe says, in the microwave, and ended up with a mess.  Still tried to use the chocolate, and at first ended up with a something similar to ice cream.  Managed to salvage it by reheating the mixture in a metal bowl on top of a vegetable steamer (I don't have a double boiler), which let the whoel mixture get creamy, then I chilled it, and made another 1/2 cp of whipped cream (added a teaspoon of vanilla to that).  I folded the new whipped cream into the chilled chocolate mousse mess, whipped it some more, then put it in the fridge to set.  It still is too dense, but of course the taste is fine.  Another concern - it says to put my still hot saucepan in ice - ummmm no!   I am not going to risk warping my brand new stainless saucepan.  I transferred the mixture to a metal bowl first and put THAT on ice.  And you really need to keep stirring frequently or the side get hard.

Delish! Very Easy to Make! I did however substitute brewed coffee for the water, semisweet chocolate chips for the squares and decreased the whipping cream to 1 cup (all I had..lol) and it came out FABULOUS!! :-)

These are great if you are short on time. We tried it after chilling about 30 minutes and they were pretty good but we had some the next day and they were much better. I reccomend chilling in fridge at least 2 hours if you can.

Really easy, really good.  I used one bag of semi sweet choc chips (12oz.) instead of 8oz. choc. and 4 yolks instead of 3.  Turned out perfectly!  5 star recipe - easy and tasty!

This mousse was really easy to make and delicious! The semi-sweet chocolate makes it a little bitter, so if you like sweeter chocolate, I would use milk chocolate. Just use the chocolate you like. I would definitely make it again!

Love love love this!!!  I had some leftover whipping cream and I didn't know what to do with it so I made this.  I did add a pinch of salt to the melted chocolate.  When I took it off the stove to cool, I stirred in 1 tsp of vanilla.  Also, I only used 1 cup of whipping cream because that was all I had left and it turned out great.  So yummy with berries but oh so fattening.

I think it tastes great!!!!   though, if you are making it in a hurry before a party, and you dont have time to freeze it, thats not good. I learned the hard way. Though, no matter what, it still tastes great!!!

a friend invited herself over for lunch so i needed something i could make in advance and not have to worry about it. i was skeptical about this recipe at first because of the water but went ahead with it because of it's great reviews. i substituted the 1/4 in the egg yolk/sugar mixture with milk for a creamier consistency and i used 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. wow! it's so good! next time i'll use all milk and a better chocolate!

Best mousse recipe I've found...made in a dorm room in 20 minutes and then put in the freezer for an hour and it had the normal mousse consistency with a great, rich flavor...used mix of dark chocolate and semi-sweet

This is my boyfriend's favorite dessert and this recipe came out soooo perfect!  Only thing I added was a tsp of vanilla to the melted chocolate before folding it into the whipping cream.  Once I poored into the dessert dishes, I sprinkled the top with small chocolate chip morsels. Delish!

I made this twice. The first time I had the heat too high on the egg mixture - although it got up to 160 degrees, I had already cooked the eggs and didn't realize that was what happened. It was gritty and I felt the recipe was probably not easy enough for me. UNTIL I found a good thermometer that clung to the pan from the beginning and allowed me to start at a lower temperature and watch the climb much more easily while I was stirring. I put the chocolate and egg mixture in the freezer and stirred a few times while I was whipping the cream. PERFECTION! I used milk chocolate chips because I don't like a real dark chocolate but next time I think I'll do half milk chocolate and half semi sweet to make just perfect for my chocolate tastes! This is a wonderful recipe! Thank you!

tried this for a dinner party tonight it was FANTASTIC everyone raved about it. The only negative is that it took longer than the 1-2 minutes for the sugar and egg mixture to reach the 160 temp other than that minor item have nothing bad to say.Amgoing to make this for my Super Ball party put the mousse in little premade fluted eatable cups.

I'm not sure if I liked this or not. I guess I was expecting more of a delicate flavor and not such a strong chocolate taste. Mine came out tasting exactly like the semisweet stuff I used which I don't really care for. As I said, I was hoping for something a bit more delicate. This would be good as a cake filler or just icing on a cake though.

This was a delicious dessert.  But, I think the success of this recipe lies with a candy thermometer.  I was careful to constantly whisk the egg yolks at a very low temperature and it took much much longer then 1 -2 minutes as stated in the recipe. Without the candy thermometer to tell me when it reached the correct temperature, I don't think it would have turned out.  Enjoyed by everyone - thankyou!

This (very large) recipe was INHALED by my kids at Thanksgiving.  Fairly easy, as far as mousses go, and absolutely delicious.  It's already been requested again for Christmas...may try adding a touch of mint for festive's sake w/ crushed candy cane garnish.

Delicious!  Be sure to use a thermometer to heat eggs to exactly 160 degrees.  Extremely rich; I'll try it with double the whipping cream next time.

Due to extenuating circumstances, my expectations for this were low - I only had 3 oz. of chocolate so I scaled it back to 2 servings (and it's hard to cook only one egg yolk without it overcooking!) and no mixer, so I whipped the cream by hand until my patience (and arm muscle) wore out - about 15 minutes - at which point it was sort of like a stiff soup.  I mixed it all up anyway, and it was AMAZING.  Despite all my efforts to ruin it the texture and flavor were perfect - exactly what I want (but never get) when I order mousse in a restaurant.  Stick to the proportions and instructions exactly - this will be great!

This is a great basic recipe, but I didn't think it was five stars.  I tried this with traditional baking chocolate found at the store, and I would definitely go for a gourmet (possibly milk) chocolate next time.  I think that with the right chocolate, this would be fantastic.

I made this mousse to fill chocolate shells I had made. Everyone loved the filling. The shell was too rich but the mousse, (according to many palates) was just the right amount of chocolate and creaminess.

Made it exactly as the recipe said and WOW!  Very rich and decadent.  Wasn't sure that I did the egg yolks right but in the end it was delicious.  Added a dollop of whip cream to tame the rich flavor but definitely serves more than 6 as it is so decadent.

This is one AMAZING dessert! I used two 4 oz Bakers German Chocolate bars and the result was an extremely rich chocolately mousse. I swear it tastes just like the chocolate mousse at Mortens Steakhouse. I did follow a few others' suggestions and added a teaspoon of vanilla to the whipped cream and chocolate mixture. I will definitely be making this again!

Oh my gosh, what a find here! I didn't change the recipe one bit, and it comes out wonderfully. Everyone raved about this one, and I'll definately make it again. For serving, either pipe it into tuiles, or I'm going to try forming the mousse into balls, freezing them, and then dipping them into chocolate. Thanks for the recipe!

This mousse was excellent.  Good consistency and not too sweet.  I don't recommend putting it in a ziplock and trying to squeeze it out to be all fancy.  Because it is thick it did not look appetizing squeezed out.  Had to try though, next time will just spoon into nice glasses.  Top with whipped cream and chocolate shavings, for sure.

all i can say is WOW.  I used half German and SemiSweet bars for the chocolate part.  Mic'd the choc for 15-20sec intervals, worked fine! Came out a little too strong? for me, so I added some confectioners sugar to the cream to brighten it up a bit.  Very rich, much better than the cheater way!! (coolwhip and choc pudding)

The mousse turned out perfectly, however I was a little dissappointed with the flavor. I will added a little extra sugar next time. Not quite enough sweetness for me.

Very easy, very light, very delicious!  Followed recipe exactly, except used semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I put in  individual wine glasses, garnished with whipped cream and a chocolate covered strawberry.  They were a huge family hit for Valentine's Day dessert!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Sets up nicely! I wanted it to be thick enough to pipe into chocolate dessert shells and it is great for that. Thanks to the tips I read, it turned out well exactly as written.

Delightful mousse!  Used a combination of bittersweet and midnight dark chocolate.  And used it to make a parfait with all of the extra whipped cream I made, which I topped with mini-bittersweet chocolate chips!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.  (And keep an eye on your thermometer when cooking the eggs!).

This was fairly easy to make and turned out very well. I had to strain the chocolate/custard mixture to eliminate some "scrambled egg" looking lumps, but it had no effect on the taste.

So rich!  I am a true chocoholic and this was almost too much for me!  I used the recipe to fill a 9" oreo piecrust.  I thought I might have to double it but it was just the right amount.  My in-laws don't like semi-sweet very much, so next time I'll try milk chocolate instead.

I also deviated from the recipe slightly by using Ghirardelli chocolate - I used 4oz. of 60% cacao and 4oz. of semi-sweet, and the chocolate taste was explosive. I think what type of chocolate you use really depends on your own personal preferences; if you like bitter chocolate, go for really dark chocolate, for example.
This mousse is amazing- it feels light and fluffy in your mouth but feels rich and decadent at the same time. This was my first time whipping cream from scratch, and as others have said, you just have to keep at it for literally 10-15 minutes with a hand mixer.

FABULOUS!!!!! I made this mousse as part of a filling for a cake. I did do some things a little different. When melting the chocolate instead of using all water I used 1/8 Kahlua and 1/8 water which I placed in a ceramic bowl with the butter.I put the bowl into the microwave for about 1.5-2 min. I then place the chocolate in the hot liquid mixture and let it sit for about 2 min. This made it easy to melt the chocolate with out placing it back into the microwave. I don't have a candy thermometer, so I whisk egg yolks, sugar and remaining water in the sauce pan and then placed it over a med-low heat whisking it continuously until I reached the uniform yellow consistency" like another reviewer had mentioned.  Good LUCK!!!!

This tasted more like whipped cream than chocolate mousse.  I think it needs to have whipped egg whites added to it and that would help with the texture a lot.

DEC A DENT. 
For all those of you who DON'T have a candy thermometer, cook the eggs until they a "uniform yellow consistency" like another reviewer said, but note that they will also be quite frothy from all the whisking. Other than that, I feel like it would be hard to go wrong with this recipe.

I've never made chocolate mousse before and am I ever glad I got this recipe!  Absolutely delish!  Like other reviewers, I substituted coffee for water.  Also, I miscalculated how much whipping cream I needed (not enough), so I actually winded up having only half of what I needed.  I winding up adding cool whip to make up for it...and it turned out great!  I topped off with whipped cream and fresh raspberries...guests raved!Will definitely make this again!!

This was creamy and rich, my family loved it. I needed to make it dairy free, so I used margarine and non-dairy whipping cream. I'm sure a dairy version would be even more delicious. I recommend using coffee in place of water and adding a teaspoon of vanilla.

Excellent - rich and decadent and extremely easy to make.  Best with coffee instead of simply water as it enhances the chocolate flavours.  Top it with fresh strawberries and your guests will think they've died and gone to heaven!

This was great! Just a warning, it is VERY rich. Luckily I love rich desserts and everyone else enjoyed it. I poured the mousse into martini glasses, covered it with a small layer of crushed Oreos, then topped it with whipped cream and red and green sprinkles for the holidays. They were so cute and delicious. Next time we'll use this recipe to fill those little chocolate shotglasses for New Years.

Wow that was great!  Also I really liked the way it was written (160 degrees F, about 1-2 minutes) Thanks for the break down. I have been trying to make chocolate mousse for 5 years. I never do it right it always taste fake. 
Thank you so much,
Lori

I have made this mousse frequently, sometimes exactly as written, and it is always a hit. I have taken to  replacing some of the water with liqueur  and if I want a really chocolaty taste will add some cocoa powder  to the chocolate mixture as it is melting. I have also added beaten egg white into the mousse  on occasion. This lightens it up, but it does add raw egg to the mousse.

I love this recipe! I've been making it for a few years now ever since I found it. I tried some suggestions that others left on here and found a few new ideas of my own. Instead of water, I use darigold refuel chocolate milk. There's lots of protein and no lactose. I also add 1 of those mini shot size bottles of amaretto di saronno. I pour most of it in with the melting chocolate and add the rest in to the whipped cream. Then I pour it all into an oreo pie crust - it really is heavenly! I adjust the recipe to 9 servings to equal a whole bag of chocolate chips and it makes more than will fit in a pie crust.

I've made this recipe many times, and each time it comes out beautifully. I do heat the egg mixture much slower than suggested, taking closer to 5-8 minutes to get up to 160° in order to not scramble the eggs and keep the smooth texture. The directions are very easy to follow and it really doesn't take a long time at all. The hardest part is waiting for it to chill before eating!

I had no trouble at all with this recipe. It was easy and quick to put together.  I was a bit short on the semi-sweet chocolate squares, so I used some semi-sweet chocolate chips to make up the difference, and they worked just fine. This mousse is definitely rich, almost like chocolate ice cream. My kids and I enjoyed it, but I think it was too  much for my husband(he doesn't really have a sweet tooth). I topped the mousse(in ramekins) each with more fresh whipped cream and a whole strawberry. Good recipe!

My sister is a mousse-a-holic, so for her birthday I thought I'd make her her favorite, chocolate mousse cake, and this recipe worked perfectly. You just take your favorite chocolate cake recipe (I used a betty crocker recipe), make 1/2 the recipe to fill a 9 inch round pan, and spread this over the top as if it were a thick icing. It's very rich, almost to the point of bitterness, so I added a layer of whipped cream over the mousse and dotted it with chocolate chips. For a chocoholic like my sister though, it worked perfectly :)

Definitely not a recipe for the novice.  I had difficulty with the egg yolks, and if you use a double boiler you won't have any trouble.  Over all - it's an amazing recipe and delicious.

I've made this dessert twice already and it has become my husband's favorite. A great addition to my culinary repertoire. The key is to use really great chocolate (I always go with dark). I topped the end result with powdered sugar, a little shaved chocolate, a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg. Light and fluffy!

Lovely!!
I used white chocolate and added a drop of vanilla flavour and a drop of lemon flavour. I also let everything come to a boil while stirring with a leaf of gelatin before pouring into the dessert glasses.

WOW!!! This recipe was AMAZING!!!! I followed the suggestions of checking temperature, and whipping the cream to an almost buttery consistency. and it turned out perfect!!
I made this for my Fiance's birthday dessert, I think it is one of his new favs. (he had thirds). 

Be careful though, it turns out very rich, I can't handle rich foods very well so be warned if you are like me a, this is an easy mousse to OD on.

This is a great recipe!  It was my first time making mousse, and I followed some of the other reviewers.  I substituted cold coffee for the water and also added vanilla flavoring into whipped topping that I served as a garnish.  I also doubled the recipe, and it still turned out great.

Heavenly is rightt!!!  This was delicious and much easier to make than I thought.  I prepared this for my family for their Valentine's Day treat.  It was so silky smooth and had just the right richness.  I prepared it again for my extended family substituting coffee for the water.  This definitely gave it more of a mocha type flavor.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it even those who don't drink coffee.  I will be making this over and over again.  Thanks for the posting!

heavenly is right!  loved this recipe.  very easy to make, too.  i used a candy thermometer with the egg mixture (160 degrees). i put the bowl in the freezer to chill it before whipping the cream.  the mousse does get firm when chilled in the fridge, but you can take it out beforehand and let it get to room temp then it will be more soft.  i never had it with whipped cream on top, but next time i will - would be perfect with it.  thanks for the recipe!

This was good but for some reason mines tasted like it had liquor in it. It was very good but you can't have to much of it or else its chocolate over kill. It was a little difficult to make as everything had to be done quick.

I was really nervous making this on account of another reviewer's statement that this isn't an easy recipe. I'm not great at anything but baking, and this is all stovetop. But I went ahead and tried it anyway. I am so glad I did! This mousse is amazing. I didn't change a thing and I can confidently say this is one of the best desserts I've eaten in a long time. I can't wait to try this out in a pie.

This is a good basic recipe, but the extra star comes from adding 2oz of Brandy. Stir it into the chocolate mixture after the "ice water" cooling step. The aroma and flavor is heavenly.  This is the grown up version :) As it still has the alcohol content.

this is a recipe i have made for years, with one addition.  i use two of the egg whites, whip them stiffly and fold them in to the custard mixture before adding the whipped cream.  the custard is warm enough to cook the egg whites, and i use our homegrown eggs so the chance of salmonella is not a worry, or you can drop the eggs into boiling water for a second before you separate yolks from whites.  it makes a less dense but just as rich mousse.  i always use coffee instead of water and i use either kalua, vanilla or mint in the whipped cream.

So easy and exactly like the title says... HEAVENLY!!! I think I over whipped the whip cream and it could use a bit more sugar but overall it was still amazing and I will definitely make it again!

If you are looking for the most flavorful, decadent, creamy mousse....then this is the mousse to make! After filling my pies I reverted to my younger years and licked the bowl clean! :)

I made this in a hurry to go with fresh strawberries and it was a complete success! I only chilled it for two hours and it was still amazing. My sister has made this before and it tasted the exact same as when she made hers word for word according to the recipe. I would suggest this to any chocolate lover out there. It is fluffy and delicious. A pretty heavy dessert, though.

Followed the recipe exactly and loved the results.  It was a little too rich for the hubby's taste but as a dark chocolate fan, I thought it was wonderful.    I served it in chocolate cups that I picked up from the grocery store.

This is a great recipe. To get the perfect consistency make sure the cream is whipped well. Also, it is best to transfer the melted chocolate to a medium/large bowl. If you mix in about 1/3 of the whipped cream it will lighten the chocolate and make it easier to fold the remainder in. Make sure you fold it in completely so you don't get any air bubbles if you are piping. I used a star tip 828 (about 3/4") and piped into dark chocolate dessert shells. Since it is for Christmas I topped with crushed candy cane and a mint leaf. I also added a bit of peppermint extract while whipping the cream. It gave it just the right amount of mint taste. Fabulous recipe, I will definitely make again!!!

WOW!!! This has to be the yummiest dessert I've ever served. It was the grand finale of a romantic dinner for two. I tweaked it a little. I just added finely chopped strawberries (1 strawberry per serving, I reduced the recipe to 4 servings) and a whole mini-bar bottle of Kahlua. It was even better than anything I've ever had in a restaurant. Excellent Recipe.

Great and simple recipe! I did as what directed. It was rather liquidish at first but after covered and chilled overnight, it turned out superbly fine! Finally, I could tell myself that it's not that hard to make mousse au chocolat. I did 5 attempts before this recipe and only one out of it turned out alright. Thank God this time it worked! :]

This is a fabulous chocolate mousse!!  Decadent and rich!  I served with homemade angel food cake and the amazing raspberry sauce from this site as well, and a dollop of whipped cream on top.  One thing not sure if I did wrong - but after refrigeration, the mousse was VERY thick......not sure if folding more whipped cream in or just letting it come to room temp is what should be done. Nonetheless, it was fabulous and I will definitely make it again!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe exactly as written (except I used milk chocolate) and it was divine!  It was very hard to judge the temperature of the egg mixture because there wasn't enough liquid to use my candy thermometer.  (Plus I live at high altitude so it's extra tricky.)  I let it go too long and the yolks started to "cook" on the edges of the pan, but the mousse still turned out great.  In fact, I wish I still had some left right now!

This was a perfect mousse recipe. However, I'm a believer that coffee belongs with chocolate in order to pronounce the chocolate flavor. Next time I will use some coffee in place of the water and see how the flavor comes out. But the texture of this recipe is superb. Exactly what a mousse should be.

Incredibly decadent. Be sure to a) cool completely before folding the cream in and b) be patient and wait the full 4 hours of chilling time!  This is so rich that you could serve in many tiny portions. I divided the recipe into 4 and it was far too much for everyone!

Awesome recipe, you do need some general knowledge about cooking this way...definitely double boiler, don't microwave...get the egg mixture to the correct temperature and consisency...other than that, very easy to make.  I also made it with nicer chocolate (Giardelli)  which I think makes a big difference.  I made a rasberry sauce (rasberry jelly heated on stove so it's more runny then add a small package of fresh rasberries and mash, very simple)  to drizzle over the top and topped that with a few rasberries..so good!

This is a good basic recipe--really watch your egg "custard" though. It might be my chocolate selection, but the last time I made it, it seemed to need something--vanilla, coffee, liquer?--not sure. So 4 stars.

I absolutely loved this recipe and so did my family.  I used it as a filling for a chocolate cake (Dark Chocolate Cake I … also from this site) and it was WONDERFUL.  Obviously there was some left over but I ate it all within a couple of days.  I followed the instructions from another reviewer (Reviewed on Sep. 20, 2008 by Christine) which was very helpful and I also added dark chocolate pieces to the mousse which was delicious.

Totally awesome! Not the easiest thing I ever made, timing will be better next time but SURE worth the effort.  I too used coffee in place of water, next time, since it is really, really rich, I'm going to add some strawberries or bannana's or some filler fruit in it, don't know how that will be but I'm defidently going to keep making this, loved it.

All I can say is WOW! I am not a fan of semi sweet so I used Lindts milk chocolate bar. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It did take me about 10-15 minutes for the mixture to reach 160.  Came out delicious. Served with sweetened whipped cream from this site.  And topped with a chocolate covered strawberry! It is so rich and delicious!

love this recipe, it's super easy and you don't need a candy thermometer, just keep an eye on the egg white and make sure it doesn't burn.  i like to put the mousse into individual graham cracker or chocolate crust tartlets

This was fabulous! Couldn't have been an easier recipe. I did use coffee instead of water and added a dash of vanilla before mixing. Wonderful! My first homemade mousse and it was a hit! Thanks!!

This is a great recipe.  I made it for Valentines and my Boyfriend, who hates things that are too sweet, absolutely loved it!!  I did use coffee instead of water and used Ghiradelli sweet ground chocolate and cocao instead of plain semi-sweet chocolate.  It was perfect.

Divine Mousse, but I wanted a REALLY rich thick dessert; this was quite light in texture.  Next time I'll only whip a scant cup of cream to fold in to intensify the chocolatey-ness. I made dark chocolate bowls to scoop this into, drizzled raspberry sauce around and in the bowl, and sprinkled fresh raspberries.  Beautiful, elegant, and decadent dessert.

Wonderful end to a great Valentine's Day dinner at home.  This is extremely rich, so you don't need a huge serving.  I don't have a candy thermometer, but watched very carefully while stirring the egg yolks so as not to have scrambled eggs.  Homemade whipped cream is an essential 'topper' as it really helped to cut down on the richness of the mousse.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

This was my first time making mousse and I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of this recipe. I did expect the chocolate mixture to fluff up on it's own but maybe it is not supposed to. Once you combine the whipped cream and chocolate mixtures, the flavor and consistency is really great. I did put the chocolate layer in the freezer for about five minutes, stirred and returned to the freezer for another five as suggested by another reviewer instead of putting it on ice. I also found that whipping the finished product with a hand mixer after chilling made it fluffier for serving. In fact, I used a hand mixer for the whole recipe rather than using a whisk. I topped this with sweetened homemade whipped cream before serving. Thanks for sharing!! I will be making this one again.

This was DELICIOUS!  I couldn't believe I made something that turned out so good!  Make sure you heat the egg mixture on LOW because you don't want to cook the egg and potentially have egg chunks.  Also, make sure you whip your cream until it's the consistency you want for your mousse.  I used it in between layers on a cake and hope it stays stiff and doesn't turn out soggy...will know tomorrow after the party!

Excellent recipe! It was very easy to make and tasted delicious! The only thing I did differently was to make extra whipped cream (with a few tablespoons of sugar) and make the mousse parfait style. This just helps cut down the richness of the mousse.

This recipe is for those who like dark chocolate!  It is not an overly sweet mousse.  I served this after our Christmas dinner.  I was surprised to see the men finished theirs before the women!  One of our guests was in the restaurant business and was impressed with the smoothness.  I served it with homemade, fresh whipped cream.  In fact, the guys asked for seconds.  This would be an impressive dessert for Valentines, an anniversary dinner, etc.

I have never made a chocolage mousse before and was a little nervous to try for Christmas Eve dinner, but it turned out even better than I imagined.  I had to double the receipe for 2 people and it was just the right amount.  Everyone raved out it and I will definitely make again.

My daughter loves chocolate mousse so this Thanksgiving I decided to serve somthing a little different for dessert along with the old standbys. We made this Thanksgiving morning and by lunch time it was fabulous. This is definitely a keeper, she has already asked to have this instead of cake for her birthday.

Very tasty, although not as successful as most of the things I make are. The taste was excellent, indeed, but it was too watery, and I followed the recipe exactly as said.

I guess I will just repeat it in a few months.

Anyways, a slight change I loved - I added a few mls of walnut liquor, and everyone loved it.

In any case - a great recipe. :)

DE-LICIOUS! Might use 1/2 the sugar next time but overall this recipe is superb and easy as pie! I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of baking squares.I also used the speed method for this recipe - stuck in freezer for 60 minutes, although the batch that stayed in the fridge overnight was slightly better.

Wow! Is this ever good! Per some other suggestions, I added a little vanilla to the chocolate mixture. Additionally, I only had one 8 ounce container of whipping cream and that was fine. It turned out fantastic! I will be making this often! What a decadent dessert! Thanks!

Unbelievably delicious.  Not too heavy or sweet.  I made this twice in one week.  One with coffee as substitute for water, the other just water.  Great either way.  I also added some chocolate shavings before chilling in ice and that added some interesting texture as well as flavor.  Love it!

Fabulous, but I will never make it again, unless its for a party or something...I ate it all by myself over the course of a week, nobody needs that much chocolate mousse.  Another reviewer was totally right about using really good chocoloate, its a must!

This was really good! I made this for my husband and he loved it! I did make some changes: I used dark chocolate,and coffee instead of water in the chocolate,and I put a little bit of vanilla in the whipped cream. I left it in the fridge for 8 hours and it came out perfect. I topped it with whipped cream and shaved dark chocolate! Perfect dessert!

i used lindor 65% cocoa bars, and the cocoa really shone through, despite all the richness of the cream.  the coulis is great, but it is just as good with whole raspberries and some whipped cream, which add moistness.  next time i am going to make a chocolate ganache, and coat it with it, to add that extra level of sophistication.

I did not care for this recipe. It said it served 6 when it really served 5. It looked like hot chocolate that was way to thick.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and it did not work. And it was a huge mess!  As a native French woman this is absolutely nothing like I was expecting.

Very good, but tasted like the wooden spoon I mixed the chocolate with. Huge hit with David&Kathryn. Made again Robyn and family without the wooden spoon this time.

Unbelievable!  I made this for dessert for my husband yesterday, Father's Day.  He said it was better than the chocolate mousse he had in a french restaurant in NYC.  It was easy peasy and really good after about 4 hours in fridge.

This recipe was awesome! I made this last week for a chocolate party with some friends and everybody loved it. All in all, it really wasn't that hard to make. Unfortunately, I kept cooking the egg before it ever got to 160 degrees. I didn't realize you have to stir the egg almost constantly. But, true to the saying, I got it right on the third try. Despite the mistakes I made, it still turned out really well, so thank you!

I don't think the leftovers will be a problem!

Today is my boyfriend's 26th birthday. I have had so much fun getting his cake together. I used two recipes Heavenly Chocolate Mousse, and Heavenly White Cake. He's mixed race and all his friends call him Panda bear. So, I made a black and white cake. I used the mousse as the filling. My only change was instead of water I used McDonalds hazelnut chilled coffee... and in the cake I used extra almond extract. I've never made a cake from stratch before, and I am so pleased. Also, yesterday as kind of a date I added food colouring to pieces of marzipan... and made little pandas. I told him whoever's were better in the end could go on his cake. It's beautiful thank you! I'm sure his friend's will love it!

This recipe is so simple yet so wonderful! I've used pure dark chocolate and it came out yummy (because we prefer our chocolate that bit bitter). But I have also made it with regular plain chocolate and it's delish aswell. I use ice cold water instead of ice to cool the egg yolk/chocolate mixture. I've made it with cream that I've bought already whipped and with cream that I've whipped myself and I must say it's better if you whip the cream yourself as the mousse takes a slightly more consistent texture. Oh, go easy on the sugar -I use a bit less than 25g and find that's enough. Enjoy!

This was great! I made it the night before and added 1/4 tsp vanilla to the melted chocolate. When I whipped the heavy cream I added Whip It stabilizer for whipped cream, (I got it at WholeFoods). My dinner party loved it!

Great recipe.
I use cofee instead of water and add a pinch of salt.
I pour hot cofee over chocolate and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds, no more.
Then I stir untill the chocolate is disolved. That way the temperature is just right.

This recipe was pretty good. My husband liked it. I used Nestle chocolate chips and  I don't think it turned out as lusciously chocolaty as I imagined it would. Next time I will buy a higher priced chocolate. Thanks!

Fantastic. I'm not a huge chocolate fan but everyone else in my family is and we all loved it. I added 1 t vanilla and 1/2t almond which added to the flavor. I'm sure it would be great with strawberries or some other kind of fruit as well. The texture is perfect...

I just made this to have with our Valentine's Day dinner, but I'm terribly afraid it won't last through the night! I probably have chocolate all over my face from licking every utensil. This dessert is incredible - I can't wait for my husband to try it! *Note to HaileyDaily: I know I can't be the only one to think this, but I just couldn't go without saying it. Please don't laugh at children for making "mistakes." There's no better way to discourage them from trying. Use this as an opportunity to learn with your daughter. Thanks, though, for allowing her to experiment. The world needs more foodies!

Forgive me, but my daughter thought she would try this recipe, and she wanted to do it alone, and i said fine since she is old enough. And turns out besides whipping cream she used WHIPPED cream. I LAUGHED AT HeR SO HEARD AND SAID it was so wrong. Anyway would whip cream work??

Very good although it does need cool whip or whipped cream on top because by itself it is a little bit too bitter.

Big hit at Christmas.  Made it with German chocolate, and made my own fresh raspberry sauce for the top.  The combination of the two was great.

I made the mousse and put it in a chocolate cookie pie crust and it was absolutely divine. The mousse was light and fluffy and very creamy and the pie crust added a delicious crunchiness. It firms up beautifully in the pie crust for a perfect pie. I highly recommend this recipe - it is one of the best I have yet to try! Five stars all the way!
