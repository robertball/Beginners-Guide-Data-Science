Great basic recipe! I did tweek it by adding garlic powder, oregano, and basil. I've never made lasagne without cooking the noodles first. I was worried that the noodles might be tough but they were perfect.

I am not a very good cook yet, and I have never made lasagne!  This was sooo easy!  It takes awhile to bake, but tasted so good :) and lots of leftovers since its just the two of us!  I didn't make any changes, except for my kitten licking the raw egg out of the bowl I beat it in (after adding the egg to the cheese mixture)!

This was great! Very simple to make, and tastes great! My kind of cooking! I did make a few changes, such as using dry parsley (and not as much); and pre-cooking the noodles (just a personal preference) so I cut the water to a little less than 1/2 cup; baked for about 40 minutes with the foil on, then took it off and then added the cheese on top, put back on until the cheese bubbled... and it was delicious! My fiance loved it too! Definitely a great starter recipe!

As with some of the other reviews I added some ingredients. I added a medium chopped onion and some diced white mushrooms to the ground beef as I browned it. I also added a 1-1/2tsp of minced garlic (the jarred kind that I always have on hand in the fridge), worcestershire sauce, and Italian seasoning to the meat mixture. This kicks up the flavor and is pretty much how I always do any kind of meat sauce. I was making an extra casserole for the neighbors so I kept it low on the salt but it still has a ton of flavor!

This recipe was easy but I'm not raving about the end results. It was a little bland. I would suggest adding some red pepper flakes or some other seasoning to give it a little more flavor.

I really enjoyed this recipe - it was super easy and quick.  A couple of changes I made, I don't eat red meat so I used a combination of ground pork and italian sausage meat.  I added an extra can of tomato sauce (380 ml) to the recipe and used oven ready lasagna noodles.  I think next time I make it I'll also add garlic to the cheese mixture and onions to the meat.

I made this recipe as directed, only subbing Italian sausage for the ground beef.  I cooked the meat beforehand & mixed it with the sauce, then stuck that in the fridge.  I pulled it out about 15 minutes before assembling the lasagna.  I'm guessing that because that mixture was slightly cold, it extended the baking time.  I baked it for an hour at 360ยบ, upping the temp by 10ยบ to hopefully make up for the cold sauce.  I took it out, cooled it, and my noodles are not cooked.  I am quite disappointed.  My family was supposed to be somewhere tonight, but now this dinner is making us late.  Cooked long enough, this recipe might work out well (the tastes are good)- but I don't know if I can trust uncooked noodles again.

This turned out well for me. I actually used this recipe to make cheese stuffed manicotti instead. It was supposed to be lasagne but when I went to my pantry what I thought was a package of lasagne noodles was manicotti so that is what I worked with. I simply stuffed the cheese filling into the uncooked pasta and then put them in the baking dish and dumped the sauce over it and topped with the rest of the shredded cheese. I followed the baking instructions and this actually turned out well. I was skeptical since the pasta was uncooked, but yes this works and it was a timesaver as well as easier to stuff the dry pasta. I used a can on Hunts spaghetti sauce and subbed small curd cottage cheese for the ricotta. I had to personalize it and added a pinch of basil and some oregano to the cheese mix and some garlic salt and freshly ground black pepper to the beef as it cooked for flavor. I cut this recipe in half and used 6 manicotti noodles. Easy peasy!

I made this recipe for the first time tonight. It was a very easy recipe to follow. Like some of the other reviewers wrote, this is a basic recipe. You can add your unique touches to this recipe. For instance, I like adding onions, bell pepper and mushrooms to my sauce,as well as basil and garlic. I was a little leary about using uncooked noodles but if you add the amount of water recommended to the sauce, it will turn out just fine. I think I would add italian sausage to the sauce for more flavor the next time I make it.

This was my first time ever attempting lasagne and it was very easy and tasted great. Except for the meat layer which wasn't thick enough at all. I followed the recipe exactly adding a chopped onion like other reviews suggested, but next time I'm going to add a can of chopped tomatoes and double the meat. Maybe I just like it more meaty but 1 cup of the meat sauce for a layer wasn't enough at all... it's more like you need 3 cups. A good recipe though and I'll definitely use it next time, making a few adjustments.

No complaints, easy dish to satisfy my boyfriend's love for lasagna. Only changes were I used tomato sauce in place of water and I used oven ready lasagna which did not require any additional liquid, cooked perfectly with recipe. Only thing is I felt like there wasn't quite enough for all the layers but maybe I need to pace myself better with the amounts

Great meaty lasagna! I love not having to cook my noodles beforehand, and the egg keeps the lasagna from being "soupy". Have been using this recipe for years.

Loved this recipe however did add garlic powder to the meat and used an extra spicy tomato sauce and used slices of mozz instead of shredding. My husband raved and gobbled it up. Loved that it was not sloppy and held together so well. A keeper!

Great basic recipe! I used brown rice lasagne noodles (gluten free) and also added spinach to the layers. I had to cook it longer than written (maybe 15-30 min) until noodles were soft and liquid was absorbed. I would also recommend adding dried or fresh basil, oregano and garlic to the cheese layer as it gave it some flavour.  I also find that using pizza mozzarella instead of regular gives it a more of a 'cheesy' texture that stretches when you cut it, like a cheese commercial :) We will be making this again soon!

We really loved this lasagna. I've tried making lasagna many times in the past and it just never turned out that well but it did with this recipe. So very easy and stayed together when you plate it...perfect! To make it a bit healthier I drain the meat in large sieve and rinse in very hot water and let drain well. This way it gets rid of all the grease from the meat so the meat sauce it not greasy at all.

This recipe did not work out well for me. It looked ugly after it was baked and it was rather dry. Could have used more flavor too. I would have given it a lower rating, but my family liked it. I won't be using this recipe again though.

I really liked this!  I have only liked my mom's lasagna up to this point, so I was pleasantly surprised to find that I like another one!
I halved the recipe so I think I must have lost out a bit on tomato sauce in my calculations because it was a little bit dry.
The noodles were perfectly cooked though and this was fairly easy to make.
Thanks for sharing this recipe!

So easy,m! I do a double batch and freeze one. Sometimes Iโll substitute cottage cheese for a healthier option.

Great and simple recipe. I used sage sausage and added some onion while cooking the sausage, along with some garlic powder and a little oregano. Used some homemade spaghetti sauce and it turned out perfect!

My go to lasagne recipe! Super easy and delicious! I add shredded carrots or peeled shredded zucchini to as a layer to the pasta sauce that way my kids get their vegetables too! Always a favorite in this family!

Great recipe. I use 1lb mild Italian sausage and 1lb ground beef. I also add about 1/2 lb tomato puree so I can make an additional smaller pan to put in freezer. If you want a bit more flavoring, season the ricotta and the meat. I use garlic, onion, thyme, oregano and basil for both. A good red wine added to the meat while cooking also allows the flavors to settle in well.

I season the meat to taste and adds more flavor to the Finished dish. Instead of Ricotta Cheese I used Cottage Cheese with 1/2 cup of Parmesan  and 1/2 cup of Mozzarella   Extra Parsley added to the Cottage Cheese, Again to add flavor.

This is my 2nd time making this recipe and I love it!! I do add turkey sausage, red pepper, garlic, and basil to mine during the browning of the meat. My only problem is I never seem to have enough sauce and cheese mixture to make three layers (2), maybe I'm using too much in my layers. Either way it turns out delicious, one of my boyfriends favorites!!

I seasoned the hamburger with the spices I normally would and used my favorite pasta sauce. It was the first time I used ricotta cheese and everyone liked it.
