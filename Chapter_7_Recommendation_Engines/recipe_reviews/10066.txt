Your recipe was so beautiful and so adictive! I made it crunchy and non sticky by not adding as much butter and adding some bran too!

Found these easy to make and really enjoyed the nutty taste and texture. I read how some of the reviewers found it too sticky so I let it boil a bit longer then suggested to make it harden more. It was a bit greasy when first out of the oven but when somewhat cooled cut them up and put in a container. The next day they were hard without being too hard. Perfect. Also used "Trail Mix" (mixture of nuts-eg. peanuts sunflower seeds pumpkin seeds almonds etc.) instead of hazelnuts and thought this worked really well. Will definitely make these again!!

Well they did turn out OK. I modified it a little. Used a commercially prepared muesli mix and added 1/2 cup of self-raising flour. Turned out OK. Reduced the amount of honey to 1 tbs. This in a way reduced the stickiness. Refrigeration is a must for this bars. In the humid tropical heat here they became very soft and attracted insects of every kind. First the ants came then the fruit flies then finally the spiders who came and ate up the earlier insects:) I used airtight bags to carry them around.

Wonderful and completely addictive. I followed the recipe exactly except I made them in an 8x8 pan. I didn't find them too sticky. They were easy to make fast relatively health and absolutely delicious.

Excellent recipe! I have to agree they are addictive! I added dried cranberries to the recipe which added some colour and great flavour. Other dried fruit would work well too. I would try to decrease the butter next time as I found them a bit greasy but not sticky. I would also experiment with maybe more nuts and coconut as opposed to the sesame to change the flavour up a bit. Thanks for this one!

I spread the misture out thinly onto a rectangle cookie sheet and they came out SO nicely. They were thin and crispy. Instead of the nuts and seeds we used a whole cup of coconut. My daughter 8 loved them so much that she hoarded half of the pan to her grandma's house.

Quite a nice tasting bar I did cut down on the sesame seeds as I am not a big fan. Added chopped dried mango dried plums and currents to give it a little bit more taste and texture. Wrapped them up in clear wrap for my husbands work colleagues. They were a little greasy like a few other cooks mentioned. I cooled in the fridge for 30 minutes before cutting then placed on a paper towel to absorb an extra grease. I cooked mine for the minimum amount of time and pulled them out at the right time any longer and they would have been burnt on the bottom.

My 10 year old son and I really enjoyed these but my other kids didn't... Used Smart Blend instead of butter and walnuts instead of hazelnuts.

I only used 3/4 of a stick of butter and I added more oats because I thought the mixture was a little buttery and greasy. I do like them and will try to find a way to modify the recipe to cut the butter factor down because it makes the bars greasy and more of a heavy treat. I did use cranberries and almond slivers instead of hazelnuts and that worked well! Also I put the tray right into the fridge and then cut them into bars.

These have a very good nutty flavor and just 1 is very filling. Instead of sesame seeds I used 1/4c. of poppy seeds. I used a standard cookie sheet and these came out perfect. I suggest letting them cool in the pan and in the fridge for about and hour before trying to cut. After being in the fridge they were easy to cut and popped right out of the pan.

Despite being so simple to make with common ingredients this may be the most loved recipe I've found on this site. The ENTIRE tray was devoured by two people in a day. I followed the recipe exactly aside from using an 11x8 pyrex dish rather than an 11x7 baking dish. They didn't stick at all weren't sticky to hold and cut very nicely. I need to make these every day!!

This was easy to make and my girls enjoyed helping me do it. I did reduce the butter after reading the reviews. I was out of nuts so added extra coconut and oats, and felt the nuts would have been a great addition. I will make these again, but when I have nuts in my pantry and also in a smaller dish so the bars are a bit thicker. The girls enjoyed sharing these with the family and there were no complaints on the flavour from any of us.
