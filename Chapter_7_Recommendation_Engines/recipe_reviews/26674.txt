This was a really fabulous recipe. I made a few changes... For one, I left the potatoes cubed, (it seemed too much like shephard's pie with them mashed), and only used four, substituting the other four with sweet potatoes. It sounds odd but it was a big hit considering my husband does not like casserol. I also used fresh vegetables instead of canned and added a little garlic and chili powder to give it a littel extra flavor. I stirred the cheddar cheese in with the mixture rather than having all the hard, burned cheese on top. Great recipe for experimenting. Thanks a lot!

This is quite good.  Some changes:  I did up the mashed potatoes as I normally would, with milk and butter, salt and pepper.  I beat them with my hand mixer before adding them on top of the meat/vegetable mixture.  I think next time I'm going to try adding some garlic powder to the meat mixture and the potatoes just to give it some extra flavour.  Also, next time I'm going to try just adding the cheddar cheese into the potatoes.  I didn't really enjoy having the hardened cheese on top.  Using canned veggies made this very quick and easy.  Oh yeah - I doubled the meat and was generous with the number of potatoes and then baked it in a small roast pan.  I would make this again.

Looking at the recipe, my husband didn't think he would like it, but it ended up being a hit in my family! The cheese, mushroom soup and tomato soup really set it off for a nice filling meal! No leftovers!

That my husband and daughter liked this and they hate casseroles makes it a winner!  I think it reminds them of the Hamburger Helper I won't buy anymore and they miss.   I only substituted cream of celery for the mushroom, and frozen green beans and corn.  This is a versatile dish that you can change up depending on what's in the cabinet and freezer.  I would also suggest using can gravy if you have no cream soups.  Less sodium.     Next time I'll try the boxed potatoes, but it was still a pretty quick and easy dish.  It helps that I always keep browned and drained ground beef in the freezer.

This was pretty good.  I only had 3 potatoes so that's all I used but it was still fine.  I mixed the cheese into the potatoes as others suggested and was glad I did.  Also added milk, butter, salt, and pepper to the mashed potatoes.  I used corn instead of carrots and added a generous amount of garlic powder to the hamburger.

While I thought this was really good, my family didn't like it, but they don't like casseroles. I substituted stew meat for the hamburger and it turned our great. Thanks for a great recipe that would be good for a potlcuk dinner.

I've had this a couple of ways.  Once with ground beef, onions, potatoes, carrots, tomato soup and cheddar cheese.  The second time with hot Italian ground turkey, parsnips, onions, carrots, potatoes, tomato soup and lots of cheddar cheese.  This is a great recipe to play with and it will be a staple from now on.  Next time I might not use any meat at all, just lots of root vegetables.

VERY good. I replaced the beef with ground turkey and the tomato soup with tomato paste. You can top this with instant potatoes in a pinch, but it's really best with homemade. We've had this at least a dozen times now. It's a favorite. OH, and we omit the cheese on top. Not needed in our opinion!

Surprisingly good... Although, I agree that it would be better if the cheese was mixed into the potatoes.

Very good! Even though I was unsure about the tomato soup and cream of mushroom, the dish came out great. I didnt have cheddar so I used the only cheese I had (white american slices)and it was very complimentary! Will make again

This was very good it sure is a nice change from Shepard's pie. I as others said mixed chili powder in with the soup mix then the meat,my husband said it gave it a nice flavor.I will be making this part of a regular recipe I use from now on.

I LOVED this recipe.  Mine was actually almost too flavorful because I dressed up the potatoes with garlic, margarine, and chives.  I'm looking forward to trying many different combinations of veggies and spices.

I didn't have tomato soup, so I substituted with tomato paste and water.  I don't know if it would have made a difference if I had used tomato soup, but I was not a fan of this dish.  I mixed extra cheese in my mashed potatoes, along with milk, butter, salt, pepper, and sour cream.  The whole dish was bland, even though I did add garlic powder.  My husband thought it was not bad, but my kids wouldn't eat it.  I even tried adding ketchup for them per a previous review.  The only one who ate it up was my 16 month old, but he eats just about anything.

This is actually QUITE good. It is VERY filling. It reheats well in a pan. I added garlic to the meat when browning.

This is a favorite of mine! I used garlic mashed potatoes. This dish is the perfect comfort food, and tastes good as leftovers. Thank you for sharing!

This is a fabulous, filling casserole. I added a can of corn and used instant mashed potatoes. Excellent recipe!

Delicious and different -in a good way!  I also made my own mashed potatoes using white and sweet potatoes that I make with milk, s&p, butter, and I also mixed in shredded cheddar cheese which came out so good, I'd make it alone as a side dish.  I would almost double the ground beef next time though, my husban and I agreed it could use more. The only other thing I changed was, I used garlic flavored cream of mushroom soup- I know! I didn't know they made it either! Definitely use a big casserole pan, this is a lot of food!

Good stick to your rib dinner....I changed it a tad by using half ground beef and half pork sausage and added garlic while browning. A wonderful potluck dish!

This turned out really good - family loved it.  I didn't have an onion, so I added dry onion soup mix to the two soups, I only had fresh carrots, so no beans, I sprinkled in a little chilli powder and celery salt.  I added cream cheese to the mashed potatoes.  And only did a very small sprinkling of shredded cheese on top for a pretty gold effect.

This was pretty basic and lacking in a strong flavor... until I discovered that eating it dipped in ketchup gave it exactly the flavor I was looking for.  I subbed the veggies for what I had and ended up needing more mashed potatoes and cheese in order to cover the top.  Thanks!

This recipe is excellent, I made this and my husband and I Loved it, the only things I changed were veggies I used peas & corn cuz that's what I had, I mixed the cheese in with the potatoes like others suggested and added a 3/4 of a can milk to the mixture to make the sauce a little creamier it has become a house hold favorite... I just Love the ajustability of it if you have or want to try something different!

This was great for a quick week night dinner! I used fresh carrots and mashed my potatoes with butter, milk, and some salt and pepper. The only thing I would do differently is add some seasoning to the ground beef next time as well (salt, pepper, and garlic powder). Otherwise this was really tasty and filling! We decided it was like Hamburger-Helper/Shepherd's Pie.

Not too bad at all, I substituted the carrots with greens beans and it was delicious. I also flavored the ground beef with minced garlic, salt, pepper etc. I added cooked mashed potatoes just like I always do as well, with salt/pepper, butter and milk. If I hadn't used any spices it may have turned out somewhat bland. Good recipe though!

I only made this with tomato soup, and did not add the carrots and green beans since I didn't have any on hand. I thought it turned out wonderful! A bit of garlic to the meat would be good too, I think I'll try the other reviewers suggestions sometime.

This turned out really good! I wasn’t sure about the tomato soup since I’m not crazy about tomato anything but it worked! I did mix the potatoes with milk, butter, salt, pepper. Cooked the ground meat and onions with olive oil, minced garlic, salt and pepper. Followed the recipe exact with everything else. I will be making this again! And a great leftover!! Thanks.

I’ve made this twice now. On my second attempt I made a few changes to suit my own taste.  I used 1 lb ground turkey, 1/2 lb ground sweet Italian sausage, added a can of corn and a can of peas, 2/3 of the potatoes recommended, and used cheddar jack and mozzarella.  Also I didn’t add the cheese until it had already cooked for 15 minutes and set it to broil for the last 5 minutes.

This was easy to make! I opted to use fresh carrots and frozen green beans that I partially precooked in the microwave. I also added fresh mushrooms and frozen peas. For a little more flavor I also added fresh parsley and dried ground savory. It turned out great! (My huband is eating his 2nd serving now!)

This recipe has been in my family for years. Derived from a Campbell's recipe. Pretty low maintenance to make even for me (little skill in kitchen).

I added Worchestershire sauce and minced garlic to the meat before browning, and switched out the tomato soup for diced tomatoes and green Chiles.  then I pushed the cheddar into the hot mashed potatoes with a fork.  Loved it.

I have been making this ever since I put it in my recipe box 13 years ago. Instead of adding onions, I add onion soup mix to the ground beef when browning it. I deglaze the pan with red wine and let it reduce before adding it to the mix. I use steamed frozen veggies (corn, carrots, and beans) and instant potatoes (sour cream and chives variety). Sometimes I mash up a can of diced potatoes to give the instant potatoes some texture. An easy and crowd-pleasing recipe!

My husband is not a picky eater but rarely does he go back for seconds.  He did with this one.  I used fresh beans and carrots that I par-cooked and added about half the cheese to the potatoes after mashing them. I will make this again.

Replace canned vegetables with frozen and fresh. I made this a couple of times with different vegetables and each time this turned out great. Add 1/2 t. each of salt,  pepper, garlic powder, and chili powder.

I made this last night & my family loved it.  I made 2 changes:  I used 2 lb. ground beef, and I used corn instead of carrots (kids aren't big carrot fans).  My husband, my son, and even my picky teen daughter liked it, and that's saying something! I also used instant mashed potatoes--butter & herb flavor.  Very good!

I did quite a bit of changes and added a few things. I added some garlic, cumin and coriander to the beef, changed the canned vegetables for fresh vegetables, added mushrooms, added a tbsp of herb and garlic cream cheese to the mashed potatoes and I omitted the cheese so that it doesn't have so many calories cause the cheese alone was 326 calories. It is very delicious.

It was literally just how I rated it, ok. Just not visually appealing for small family members, also I strongly, strongly recommend using either frozen or fresh veggies instead of the canned! Along with everyone else's advice to add garlic powder to the meat, it might be an ok dish.

I found this recipe to be lacking in flavor. I love shepherd's pie and thought this would be a good take on it but it was really rather bland. I'd make it again but try some different spices in it.
