This was a delicious dinner. I only had one zucchini so I added mushrooms as well, which added a nice and simple little variety of vegetables. Thanks for sharing :-)

Yum! I made the sauce exactly as written and topped with left over chicken from a previous meal. Served over fettuccine with a side salad. The kids loved it. thank you!

Great comfort food taste! Substituted broccoli for zucchini. To season the chicken I poured some olive oil on a dinner plate, mixed the kosher salt and some pepper into the oil, and coated the chicken this way. Next time (and there will be a next time!) Iâ€™ll cut the chicken into strips before cooking. Such a great flavor!

Really delicious just the way it is.  A little better for you than versions that use heavy cream or half and half.  For the pasta I used sweet potato gnocchi (store bought) and added them right to the sauce.  See pic.

The whole family loved this.  Very rich and creamy.  Better than Olive Garden was one comment.  Will definitely be a new favorite regular meal.

This was great! I admit I used bottled alfredo sauce.
I also added mushrooms and roasted grape tomatoes.
Delicious!

Made it Gluten Free by using Penna GF pasta.  I didn't have two small zucchini so I used a large one which ended up being 4 cups of  zucchini. It was yummy and I definitely will make it again.  I have a lot of zucchini.

I made this recipe much healthier and my husband and I loved  it!  I used sliced mushrooms and not zucchini. I used skim condensed milk and unsweetened almond milk . And instead of pasta I used spaghetti squash, which seems to add a sweet taste to this lovely dish.

This was a fantastic recipe!!  Everyone who tried it raved about it. I used my own Alfredo recipe instead though.

Made this gluten free with brown rice pasta spirals and potato starch in place of the flour. Turned out great! The whole family loved it, even the gluten-eating ones!

This was good. I had to use whole wheat penne pasta, as that's all I had, and it worked fine. The zucchini was a nice addition to chicken alfredo. I seasoned the chicken with some Italian seasoning, which I think helped with flavor. I didn't have fresh parsley so had to use dried. Overall nice meal, and I think it's going to make great leftovers.
