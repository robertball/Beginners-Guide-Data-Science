I love yeasted coffee cakes. I made this in late summer with fresh plums on top. This is a great recipe, but is not for the impatient baker or for the faint of heart: there are a lot of steps involved, including making the caramel. I made a wet caramel instead of dry, because I like controlling how dark it becomes--and I added a splash of Kirsch because I like liqueurs with fruit. I used butter for the shortening, and only used half the dough because I had a smaller springform pan I wanted to use. It was still too much dough for the pan--my fault--and I baked it on a baking sheet because I had a hunch the topping would bubble over, which it did. Lastly: I prepared the cake the night before and let it rest overnight in the fridge before taking it out and letting it rise a little before baking. Very impressive for brunch. I'm going to try it again with the rest of the dough using apples and a splash of Calvados in the caramel.

This is very similar to the Kuchen my grandmother made when I was a child and it's excellent. The only difference is that Grandma topped the Kuchen with fruit and then a cream custard rather than caramel. Thanks for bringing back the memory of Grandma.

Delicious!  I love the fact that this recipe makes two cakes.  That way my family can enjoy one and I can freeze the other for another time.  The only change I made was that I used cinnamon in the glaze instead of allspice just because I personally don't care very much for allspice.  This recipe is definately a keeper.

This recipe is just like my grandmother used to make except for the cinnamon. So glad I found this recipe, because I didn't have it.

If you omit the allspice, this is a very close approximation of a coffee cake (more Russian than German actually) that my grandmother used to make, and now I do.  We use a thickened sour cream layer and a butter-sugar-flour crumble on top rather than the cinnamon...YUM. I bake them in pie plates - they freeze well and are good to keep on hand for company.  Goes great with a strong coffee, Tasters Choice French Roast, for example.  Mmm, brings back memories!

Very good recipe and I'm glad I gave it a try.  Next time I make it I will put some kind of fruit on top of the caramel layer.  It makes a huge quantity.
