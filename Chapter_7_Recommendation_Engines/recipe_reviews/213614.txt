I love this soup.  The recipe is very robust, and can be changed to accommodate different ingredients.  I didn't have broccoli, so I added a tomato instead.  I also used fresh ginger, fresh thyme, and substituted the sage with fresh cilantro (I didn't have any sage).  I just added the thyme and cilantro after the cooking was finished, and before I began blending with my immersion blender.  The lentil soup went very well with some cooked brown rice (for a complete protein).  I couldn't get enough, and neither could my 2-year-old daughter.  Thanks, hot_curry!

WAY too peppery. The flavor would probably be excellent, otherwise.

Hot soup!  I cut back on the pepper flakes, ginger and black pepper to 2 tsp. each, and that was plenty hot enough for me!  I only had green peppers, and fried them with the other vegetables.  I used water instead of broth.  Good way to keep warm on a cold day!

Good soup with great potential.  Frist, too much black peper - would prob use 1-1/2 tsp.  I didn't have any broccli so didn't add that.  Despite the over powering pepper - it was a wonderful soup - a bunch of different flavors all mixing together.  My family even liked it.

This recipe is great because you can change so much to use what you have! I changed/added the vegetables I had and it was delicious. I will say this is VERY spicy! I could stand to cut down on the crushed red pepper. But will absolutely make again!

We add potatoes to ours which adds stock and gives it more body/flavor; we also add either ham, beef tips or weiners and that really helps to make it a full-body meal.
