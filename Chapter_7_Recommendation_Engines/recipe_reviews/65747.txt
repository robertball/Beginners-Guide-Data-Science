I omitted the olives and O.J.  Instead try some chestnuts, more walnuts, cranberries, or some chopped pear.  The pears, blue cheese, and walnuts are great together.  Stunning entree with a roasted pear on the side.

My mom and I had a fun dinner for just the two of us and I made this recipe. We both loved it. I don't make the Cornish hens as often as I make the rice stuffing. I love this stuffing as a side dish! Thanks for the recipe!

I was not crazy about this recipe.  I followed to the tee but there seemed to be somthing missing.  I will try it again because maybe it was something I did.  I have tried similar recipes and loved them.
