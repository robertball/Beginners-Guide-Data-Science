This was good, a different kind of flavor with chicken. It was a bit chunky, though, and I even added more broth than the recipe called for. Perhaps I'll try this again and modify a bit to fit a smaller amount of food for next time.

I just made this recipe and it is delicious! I also cooked in slow cooker, I didn't have any swiss, so I went with cheddar and it is amazing! Served on top of rice cooked in chicken broth. Yummy!

I was worried about this being really bland since there are so few ingredients, but I was in a hurry & forgot to add any other seasoning.  It wasn't!  EVERYONE in my family had seconds.  Even my picky daughter who usually just eats the rice or pasta!  I didn't use mushroom or broth, since I didn't have any.  (I used water instead.)  I also doubled the recipe & used provolone on one pan, because I didn't have enough Swiss.  Both were excellent.  I served it over brown rice with the fabulous sauce it made!  Next time, I probably will add some garlic & onion, just for personal preference.  I also made one other change:  I baked it at 400 for about 35 minutes, since I was short on time.  By far the easiest delicious chicken ever!!

I love this recipe.  I add lots more sliced mushrooms and more chicken broth so there is more "gravy" that I serve over noodles.

This was really a nice treat! It's a gourmet version of the comfy mushroom soup chicken dish.  I love the added flavors of the mushrooms and swiss cheese. Will definitely make again but will add some garlic to creat more depth of flavor.

Hubby loved this- I didn't have Swiss so I used Provolone, which began to get stringy as it cooled on the plate (almost done eating at that point though). Still tasted good. Next time I'll use Swiss. Also, used lower sodium soup and lite sour cream. Easy to fix, served with rice and vegetables. A crusty bread would have been good alongside.

First off the recipe was VERY easy to make. I got home from work, mixed the ingredients together poured it in the pan and stuck it in the oven and did a few things around the house until it was done.. I love those kind of recipes. The taste however was lacking for me. I didnt like the taste as much as I liked the fact that it took 5 minutes to prepare and the clean up was quick. Thanks for the recipe!

Quick prep time and unique but good flavor.  Will make again and maybe serve over brown rice or pasta since there is quite a bit of sauce.

This meal was good.  I felt like there was a little more sauce than necessary, but I did use less chicken breasts than called for.  My mom used to make a similar dish but was just cheese and mushrooms I believe...I would stick with that simpler taste myself.  But overall a good meal :)

This was very delicious. I added a few things though. First I put fresh spinach on the bottom of the pan and laid the chicken on it. I added the mushrooms and sprinkled swiss cheese and then added brocholi and coliflower and sprinkled more swiss cheese poured the soup mixture and baked and added the parmesan and baked 5 minutes longer. turned out pretty good:) my family loved it too'

The picture does not do the recipe justice -- the swiss and parmesan cheeses melt to give it a golden glow and the sauce is wonderful. It was a big improvement on my similar "world's easiest chicken" recipe and really delivered flavor. The only change I made was to substitute sherry for the chicken broth and I think that enhanced the flavor. A great easy company entree.

This is a really good recipe that's easy to assemble. Interchangable with ingredients too. I made it as written the first time. The second time I only had cream of chicken soup and cheddar jack cheese. I actually thought it had more flavor than the original version. Next time I will add wine instead of chicken broth for the acid i think the dish needs.

I've made this 2 times now, and my family loved it! My future hubby loves that it is cheesy and mushroom loaded. Instead of broth, I just use water. I have tried using fat free sour cream and the light variety, both taste the same. Next time I'm going to try using plain Greek yogurt. Add a little garlic, its great!

OMG...this recipe is soooooo delicious!!!  I followed exactly as written with the exception of adding a few broccoli florets which I'm not sure I would do next time, as it seemed to overpower the rest of the flavours.  But even so, we loved it and I will be making it one of my go-to recipes when I need a simple and fast supper.  I think this could even be served for special company with a salad or steamed broccoli on the side and a nice brown and wild rice mix, which is what I served it with last night.  MMMMMMMmmmmmm!!!  Give this one a try...you won't be sorry. :-)

This recipe was fantastic.  I followed directions as is, and it was very tasty and easy to make.  I used a more aged swiss to get more flavor, but I am sure it is just as tasty with a swiss that is not quite as strong.  There was enough sauce left over for my rolls and even some for mashed potatoes.  My fiancee' liked it so much he ate his and my leftovers the next day!  Will be making again real soon.

While my husband, who likes creamy dishes and doesn't tolerate spicy dishes well, liked it, I did not.  The only note that I can detect is the parmesan.  The taste is bland and the sauce is far too thick.

I made this for dinner tonight.  The only change I made was I seasoned the chicken with McCormick's Chicken Seasoning.  I also made this a full meal by cutting up potatoes, carrots, and an onion and putting them on the bottom of the pan (seasoned with McCormick's as well) then making the rest per the instructions and putting it all  on top of the vegetables.   I cooked it all in a roasting pan at 400 for an hour.  It turned out perfect!  And we had a nice gravy for the veggies.  I made this for my boyfriend, my brother and myself, and we all loved it (and those two guys are pretty picky!)  It was a quick, easy, cheap meal that tastes like it took so much more effort than it did!  My favorite kind of recipe!
