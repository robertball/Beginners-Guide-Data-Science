Fantastic Cake.  Followed the directions to the tee for the cake. Superb! Be very careful however on draining the strawberries for the frosting. I did not drain them enough and my frosting was a soupy liquid. To compensate for this I took a small portion of the soupy liquid and added a lot of powdered sugar. In the end it was all good and was a very great cake. A perfect compliment to summertime. Family liked it. Will definately use this recipe often just being careful on the frosting.

Wonderful!!! 
I will make this again and again and again, I made the cake to the T, however, I made my own version of the cream cheese frosting, I pureed the strawberries and put them in a coffee filter to help drain the liquid, then I used 2 8oz pkg of cream cheese, the strawberries, 1/2 tsp almond extract, 2 T. softened butter and 3 C. powdered sugar, wow, what a nice cake!!

Great cake!!! Brought it to work and it was a huge hit.  Only thing I would change is putting frosting in refrigerator to firm up before frosting layers of cake.  I found that the frosting was too "soupy". It just ran more than I wanted and layers slide. But I will make it again... it was wonderful

Absolutely awesome! I did use frozen strawberries and they made the frosting a little to runny. I'd make this again but use the fresh strawberries that the recipe calls for. Otherwise this cake was excellent. Also, it passes the freezer test.....it freezes well and tastes great when thawed.

I used 1/3 c strawberry yogurt instead of the oil and it was still super-moist. And much healthier. Very tasty and made an excellent layer cake with strawberry filling. I just used whipped cream for the frosting. The cake stands on its own.

This was yummy - very moist even after being refrigerated for a few days. I used the White Chocolate Frosting recipe from Strawberry Dream Cake I.

this cake is very very moist and the taste is delicious.  i will make this cake again and again.  as a matter of fact, i will make this cake for memorial day in about 2 weeks.  i think it is best if you frost one layer and let of cool off in the refrigator and do the other two the same way, that way your frosting will not run.  that was the only problem i had with the cake or maybe let your frosting chill in the fridge first.  the cake is the bomb and i wouldn't change a thing about it.  when the cake chilled, i was delighted because it was just what the other viewers said, don't change a thing about the cake.  pay attention and follow the directions and you can't go wrong. thanks a bunch!

I made this for Mother's Day and it was a big hit.  The only change I made was substituting 1-1/2 cups nonfat buttermilk in place of the oil and milk.  I made another one today with fresh peaches and peach jello instead of the strawberry.  It is just as good with peaches.  We're already fantasizing about versions with pineapple or mandarin oranges.  A truly yummy recipe!  Some of the reviewers had trouble with runny icing, but mine has turned out perfect both times.  I mashed up the fruit then put it in a strainer to drain while the cake was cooking and cooling.

This cake was awesome. I didn't have any strawberry jello at the time, so I used blueberry flavored jello and it still turned out so so good. It looked funny because of the blue jello, but it tasted absolutely delicious, and my entire family could harldy keep their hands off of it. Something I will definitely use again.

I loaned out my Cake Mix Doctor book to someone and needed the recipe for this cake. I am so glad someone posted it on here. The only thing, make sure you drain the strawberries well or your frosting will be kind of runny. I actually drained them on paper towels my second go round and the frosting came out perfect.

I rated a 4 because I based my recipe on this one. I do not use box mixed cake. Instead I used grandma's recipe and I used a little over a pint of strawberries, pureed and used that instead of the oil. Fantastic without the fat! My use more strawberies next time. I tried finding a recipe with out gelitin, first because I din't have it, and second, I thought was was the point of it. I even added some strawberries to the icing. I didn't have the pecans.

Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.

The cake was good and very strong tasting, very pink.  I might have done okay just icing it with vanilla frosting.  But the frosting listed was so packed with berries, nuts, and coconut it didn't seem to suit cake.  It yielded a lot and overpowered the cake.  I enjoy other icing combos with similar ingredients but this one didn't cut it. Maybe make the cream cheese frosting, ice the cake and then press the nuts coconut and strawberries on.

It's true! This strawberry cake is a dream come true! Flavorful, tender, dreamy, creamy - I could go on and on about how delectable this cake and the perfectly matched frosting is! I have always been impartial to strawberry cake but not anymore! I LOVE this cake and can't stop thinking about it! In fact, I plan to make it again very soon while strawberries are still in season. I swear I could eat the whole thing by myself if I didn't bother to stop myself - it's THAT good!!!

I made this into a raspberry dream cake.  The only problem I had was that the icing was runny, but I poured it over the cake and let it fall naturally over the sides.  I actually liked the way it looked in the end, but it didn't even matter because it tastes great (and that's the important part).

This is a fantastic cake... I did make a couple of modifications... I made it two layers and added a fresh strawberry feeling (about 2 cups cubed strawberries and 1/3 cup sugar mixed) and I also added pink dye to the icing because it was my daughters birthday cake... and decorated it with multi colored twizzlers!  GREAT GREAT CAKE!

Delicious cake; it got great reviews from everyone who's tried it.  I've made 2 so far and shared them.  It's gone within 24 hrs.  My icing turned out great, however I didn't mash the fresh strawberries.  I used a small hand chopper so there's not as much juice.

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would!  Have made this a couple of times and every time I've had someone beg me for the recipe...or request I make it the next time they've been invited over.  I've made the cake a day or two before and assembled day of and it was still moist and delicious.  The photo posted with the recipe is GORGEOUS by the way!

This was delicious and easy to make. I used sugar free jello and reduced fat cream cheese.  The taste was fine, but I think the lower fat cream cheese may have made the icing thin and runnier than it should have been.

This was my first Cake I ever made! I went by the recipe from start to finish it turned out famously! Instead of using the strawberry frosting I went with the chocolate cream cheese frosting.. However inside I used the strawberry.. We all loved it.. It was a great hit!

I made this for my friend's birthday party and we loved it! It came out so moist! I tried to mash the strawberries but that didn't work so well so I through them in my vita mix and they were slightly more pureed. This might have helped keep this cake moist for a week in the fridge! It was delicious! And more of a carrot cake texture to us with the pecans and coconut but in a strawberry cake form. Very yummy.

My husband said this was probably the best homemade cake he has ever had. It did taste wonderful!! However, the frosting was runny and oozed down the sides of the cake. I made the frosting the night before and refrigerated it overnight. Yes, I drained as much juice off the strawberries as I possibly could. Still runny. Thankfully this was only being served to my immediate family. If I were to serve this to guests, I would make the cake exactly as written but with a different frosting... maybe even top with strawberry flavored cool whip. The cake is so moist it really doesn't need a heavy frosting.

Family and friends love this cake. I have made this from another recipe site and it did not call for cream cheese in the frosting....made it again after I saw the difference in the frosing and I love the cream cheese in it. Very sweet and you must love strawberries.

I made this recipe over the summer and forgot to review it.  I made it for a church pot luck and it went over great!  Was completely gone at the end. It's a very refreshing cake. It's not my number 1 favorite, but I would definitely make again.  I had a little trouble with the icing turning out on te runny side, but I'm sure that was my fault for either using too many mashed strawberries or not letting it chill long enough.  Very yummy cake!

This recipe was very easy to make. I would cut the sugar to half or less unless you like really sweet frosting. It was over the top sweet for me but, it's a great cake. Especially if you like strawberries.

Cake was good but not great. To be fair, I did make some changes. I used coconut cake mix, substituted applesauce for 1/2 of the oil and omitted the nuts. The texture was great but I expected a fresher strawberry taste. I didn't have time to make the icing so that probably would have made a difference. Overall, pretty good.

This review is for the icing and not the cake. I had already had a strawberry cake recipe and I went with that one instead. And everyone that tried it was glad I decided not to put this icing on because it was not that great. Maybe I did something wrong eventhough I followed the recipe to the t. it just tasted like strawberry cream cheese.

I thought this cake was OK, but very sweet and tasted artificial.  I ususally don't bake with cake mixes, so that may be why I didn't care for it.  The frosting didn't spread well for me even though I tried to drain the strawberries thoroughly.  My kids, however, loved it.  They thought that a pink cake with pink frosting was the best.  Although the cake wasn't bad, I don't think I will make it again given all the other excellent ways to use strawberries in desserts.

Excellent cake!  For a great presentation, I melted semi sweet chocolate with a little shortening and drizzled it all over the top of the cake and then placed fresh whole strawberries on top.

Ignore the previous reviewer, sounds like a mean spirited indication of her own lack of culinary skills - this recipe is fantastic.  Perfect for the summer months when strawberries are ripe and sweet.  I made this for the weekly meeting of a group of college students I mentor.  They looked at it suspiciously when I served it but then fought over the leftovers when it was time to go.

This is an excellent recipe bursting with the aroma and flavor of strawberries. Chilled, it is a perfect dessert for spring or summer.

I loved the chewiness of the coconut flakes in the cake. I cut down the amount of sugar to 2 cups in the frosting. My husband who is not a cake-lover enjoyed it a lot and friends loved it too.

I followed the direction exactly.  It was perfect.  Don't forget to drain the strawberries for the icing. I put mine in a strainer and let it set  until the cakes cooled. I also put paper towels on top to absorb even more juice.

I made this for a birthday cake and omitted the nuts and coconut in both the cake and icing.  The first one was great.  The second one was tough and I decided that I had just bought another box of cake mix and the cake mix does not contain the same amount - it is about 2 ounces less.  I think there needs to be adjustment to accommodate the change but not sure what.  The icing was a little thin and since I wanted to use to decorate, I just added powdered sugar to get the consistency I needed to decorate.  Everyone loved it.

Super sweet, and super awesome. Anyone with a sweet tooth will be in heaven! The frosting does tend to get a little runny, so letting it sit a little while before adding to the cake helps. Be careful not to over mix the frosting.

Only change was to frosting, I only used 2 cups powdered sugar, which was plenty.  I did make in a Bundt pan instead. Only issue was it was too moist, imagine that.  I think maybe should add a little flour next time due to high altitude. Terrific tasting, just not pretty.

Absolutely amazing! Highly recommend rinsing and drying the mashed strawberries! You’ll have too much liquid in the cake and the frosting if you don’t remove the juice. Also, I just used 3/4 cup water in place of 1 cup milk in the cake itself. Last, bring the frosting to room temperature before frosting the cake!

I made this for a baby girl sprinkle and wanted a pink themed cake. Everyone raved on this cake and icing! Was very moist and very pretty on the table.

This cake tasted good, but it was flat and dense and oily.  I questioned the amount of oil and decided to follow the recipe.  I feel it has way too much and that caused the flat, oily, dense texture.  I will look for a different recipe with these ingredients.

Made as cupcakes and added strawberry slices for decor. Cake and icing tastes great! Icing a bit runny for cupcakes so chilled it before frosting.

I made this cake for my grandma's birthday and she loved it!!! It was really easy to make and the icing was INCREDIBLE!!! I ended up with a lot of  extra icing so don't be scared to put a lot of icing in between each layer. Definitely a recipe I'll make again!

Icing was delicious but extremely runny. I drained the strawberries and chilled it before putting it on the cake, but it was a runny mess.  Disappointing because it was so tasty.

My son just loves this cake. He's 12. Every time I make it he eats the entire cake by himself. I always add half and half instead of regular milk. In my opinion, it taste much better .For the frosting I try to cut down on the sugara bit. I actually made it for his classmates. They are begging for more still.

I only used half the jello amount (1.2oz) because i thought 2 boxes would make the cake waaay too sweet. For the frosting I only used half the coconut amount and omitted the pecans (since they are already in the cake).  The coconut I used was unsweetened (again to make the cake not so sweet.) It was a HUGE hit and everybody loved it!  I think I did good omitting those items.

My cake didn't rise at all. It smelled delicious but was way too dense.

Delicious!  Will definitely make again. My daughter brought all the ingredients to bake the night before our Easter dinner on Sunday. We decorated with chocolate marshmallow rabbits covering the sides of the cake. Looked festive and very yummy to taste. I was short one 9" round pan, two worked just great.

This is such a great cake, and so versatile!  You can switch it up and use raspberry fruit and jello, or orange or pineapple.  I have used each of these already and all are delicious!  I changed nothing except eliminating the pecans because my grandchildren don't care for them.  This is a no-fail winner!

This is a delicious cake! I had no trouble with the frosting, as I drained the strawberries really well. I used toasted almonds in place of the pecans. Everyone who tried this, agreed that it was to die for!
