The skin of the hazelnut is quite bitter. To remove it easily, in a large saucepan, bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Add 4 tablespoons of baking soda and 1 cup of hazelnuts and boil nuts for about 3 minutes. Test a nut under cool running water. If the skin doesn't slip off easily, boil nuts another minute or two. After peeling, nuts should be crisped and lightly browned in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes.

This is the BEST recipe.  Everyone I made this for has raved about it.  We dunk the pieces in hot cocoa.  They are better drizzled with WHITE chocolate (it complements the cinnamon), and I coarsley chop the hazelnuts before mixing them in.  Otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly.  I didn't have any trouble with the dough nor did it spread when baking.  It is important to cream the butter and sugar until the mixture is very fluffy.

I've tried many different biscotti recipes, but this one is my favorite. I like to experiment with different fillings.. once I added 3/4c chopped dried cranberries and 1/3c almonds and substituted vanilla extract for almond extract and drizzled with white chocolate cinnamon mix and it was DELICIOUS. Another favorite altercation is to add one chopped and frozen large candy bar (I use a local organic hazelnut milk chocolate bar... symphony bars work as well) and add crushed bits to mix before baking. They seem to melt instantly when dipped into hot coffee.
Another idea is 3/4c shredded coconut and 1/4c white chocolate bits. After they have cooled dip them into white chocolate and sprinkle with coconut ! Soooo very good and sooo easy to make.
My boyfriend hates crunchy biscotti, but absolutely loves this recipe.. And my mother loves hard crunchy biscotti and just raves about how good of a recipe this is. I brought a double batch of candy bar biscotti to work and they didn't even last 2 days before they were completely devoured by co-workers !!
For christmas, I am adding nutmeg, cinnamon, peppermint extract and crunched ghiradelli peppermint chocolates to the mix. Topping with white chocolate and peppermint sprinkles :)
This recipe is THE best and originality makes it even better !

LOVED-LOVED-LOVED'EM!!
I did the 1/2 cup butter - extra cinnamon - shared the vanilla with almond extract and used almonds.  I also baked them in my convection oven at 330 degrees for the same amount of time - took them out and cut them right away - not one broke - put them back in and baked them again for 10 mins. on each side - on the second side I shut the oven off after 10 minutes and just let them set there for about 15 or so minutes.  They were very crisp like biscotti should be - very easy to handle during the dough stage and the taste was devine!! Used dark and white chocolate on some  - and left some plain. First time I ever made biscotti - used to eat them frequently at a gourmet coffee/candy store that I managed ---these were better!! Thanks!! 11-5-14 Just finished making two batches of biscotti doing the usual almond with one batch while doing coconut/walnut with the other - I use coconut extract also. With white chocolate on top - their kinda hard to beat...unless your not a coconut fan.
   I have to admit - my husband and I like a biscotti at night for dessert - we may have it with a cup of chai or....nothing ;)

I love this recipe exactly as it appears here but I have to admit that I have used it as a base to make the biscotti into other flavors.  I add walnuts and either butterscotch bits or cinnamon bits and they get raves.  I've read where some have problems with the biscotti crumbling when they cut them and I'll tell you how I over come that.  I use a bench scrape to cut them when they are still hot,not a knife.  My scrape is teflon covered but I don't think that's why it works so well. Another hint is that I line the cookie sheet with the new foil that is non-stick.  Finally a product that does what it promises.  You can not go wrong with this recipie and I am greatful to have found it.  It has made me a baking hero and I thank you very much!

UPDATE: My giftee LOVED these!!! I can't BELIEVE how good these biscotti are!  I made a batch to give as a Christmas gift... and ate a few myself - lol.  I don't care for nuts at all (except almonds), so I added a little less than called for (1 c. seemed like too much so I used 3/4 c. instead) and that seemed to be the perfect amount (you could still taste the nuts, but they didn't overpower every bite).  I doubled the amount of cinnamon to 2 tsp. and subbed 1/2 tsp. of almond extract b/c I didn't have enough vanilla on hand (used all of the 1 tsp. that I had plus the almond extract), and the biscotti tasted just fine.  After the cookies cooled, I melted a dark chocolate Ghirardelli bar with a bit of shortening (over a double boiler) and dipped one side of the biscotti in the mixture and then refrigerated on a wax paper-lined cookie sheet to set.  I don't drink coffee, but I can imagine how wonderful these would taste with a cup of brew (one of my Christmas gifts was a bag of biscotti and a bag of Christmas blend coffee all tied up with a bow and a  cute Christmas plate).  I'll have to ask the giftee how it was :)  I'll definitely make these again next year... but for myself!

This is an excellent recipe!  My first try at biscotti and it came out very well.  I used many of the suggestions from other reviews:  toasted the nuts (used pecans) and chopped them finer, double cinnamon, and used almond extract for half of the vanilla.  Also recommend waiting until logs cool completely before slicing.  I also highly recommend using Pampered Chef stoneware if at all possible.  I won't bake without it!

I've made five of the biscotti recipes from this site and this is the best, especially when you spread dark chocolate on the bottoms.  I must admit, though, that I am a true fan of the combination of cinnamon, hazelnuts and chocolate.  They are so easy to make and go very fast in my home. Thanks for sharing your recipe Kris!

Excellent recipe!  Found that the cookies cut much better with a sharp butcher's knife.  The nuts kept sticking to my serated knives (and I tried several) which caused the cookie to break.  The sharp butcher's knife cut them easily and cleanly making a much nicer looking cookie.  Taste is great, Too!

Wonderful! I used toasted, chopped almonds and almond flavoring as my family isn't real keen on hazelnut. I did not have a problem with it crumbling or not drying. It wasn't quite dry at the end so I turned off the oven and cracked the oven door. In 10 minutes they were nicely dried. I drizzled white almond bark over them. Now they not only taste fabulous, they look great too. Very easy! I'm including these in my Christmas cookie trays this year! The only down side? It doesn't make enough!

I tried these in a biscotti pan and I tried them in a sheet pan like the recipe calls for.  Either way they were not very good.  Too crumbly, too sweet, too many hazelnuts.  Not really what you think of as a "biscotti"...more like dried cake.  Also, the dough flattened out way too much when baking.  I will not try this recipe again.  I found a nice pistachio/cranberry biscotti recipe from another site which I've already made several times.  I will stick with that recipe...they are delicious!!

I have baked several different Biscotti Recipes from Allrecipes.com.  THIS is the best I have made. A couple suggestions.  This dough is moister than some when baked. I did the first bake for 25 minutes, rested the loaf for 5 minutes and sliced. I like my biscotti crisp. On parchment paper, I put the slices in 250 degree oven for 20 minutes, lowered the oven to 200 degrees for 20 minutes and then 170 degrees for another 30 minutes; turned off oven and let the slices cool inside the oven. PERFECTLY crisp.  My variation on my picture is for Cinnamon BUTTERSCOTCH Biscotti, using this recipe, but replacing the hazelnuts with Butterscotch chips. ALSO, replaced 1/2 cup granulated sugar with brown sugar. YUM!!

These are delicious and somewhat different than the usual almond biscotti.  I did chop up the hazelnuts, but left the skins on.  I also sprinkled cinnamon/sugar over the logs before the firs t baking.  Be sure to let them cool about 15 minutes before slicing for the second baking, and turn them on their sides to bake.

I discovered a cool product at Trader Joe's--a grinder containing sugar,coffee, and chocolate! Next time, I will use that instead of the cinnamoin/sugar for a "Cappaccino Biscotti"!!

This was the first time I ever attempted biscotti, but they are so easy to make, and turn out perfect every time; I've made several batches in the past month!  I use 2 tsp of cinnamon, and use pecans instead of hazelnuts, and they are awesome.

This was my first attempt at making biscotti.  I have been looking at different things to put in the tins I give out at Christmas time.  I bought a bag of chopped filberts to use in this recipe.  At first the dough seemed really dry and crumbly, but it came together in the end.  I didn't have any cinnamon on hand so I substituted pumpkin pie spice instead.  My family loved them and I brought some in for coworkers to try this morning.  So far, nothing but rave reviews.  I think for the Christmas ones, I will drizzle them with chocolate or dip one end (1/2 cookie) in chocolate.

THESE ARE AWESOME!!! I made these last week for a baby shower and everyone RAVED about them.  They were easier than I had expected.  I substituted slivered almonds and rough diced them to make it easier to cut.  You HAVE to try these.  Next time I'm going to drizzle a bit of chocolate over them.

This recipe was fantastic. The bake time was correct, the estimate of cookies made was correct, and it made delicious biscotti that held together and were just slightly chewy. I used hazelnut pieces with the skin on, and the cookies did not taste bitter to me. I would definitely make this recipe again as is, or possibly drizzled with milk chocolate or white chocolate on top.

Delicious biscotti! It's very light and crispy, yet not rock hard like other biscotti. I omitted the hazelnuts, and drizzled vanilla glaze. So good!

LOVE this recipe as is, but I've also used this as a base recipe (without the hazelnuts) for assorted biscotti.  TIPS:  As another reviewer stated, definitely take plenty of time to thoroughly cream your sugar and softened butter.  Skimping on that step could give you a crumbly biscuit (not what you're going for here).  Also, use a good quality pure vanilla extract -- no cheap stuff.  Varieties to try:  Just the base recipe (no nuts); Craisins & Pistachios; chopped pecans, etc.  It's all good!

Is most excellent. I used a bit of extra butter, an oven older than me, and used cranberries instead of hazelnuts since thats what I had in the pantry. Overall, excellent. The suggestion of doubling the cinnamon and using Almond and Vanilla Extracts was perfect! I dipped some in white chocolate cine it seemed to match well. Perfect and easy! I would only complain about a bit of crumble when cutting them, but hey, it's biscotti! (And heck, I hated coffee schop bisctotti, this was excellent!)

I didn't have enough hazelnuts, so only used 1/2 cup, and I substituted apple sauce for half of the butter to make it more healthy, but they still turned out really good. But I think they'd definitely be better with more hazelnuts, so don't cut down on them! The nuts really give this a delicious flavor.

I made this recipe about 3 times and they spread out too much while baking.  I think next time I will only use 1/2 cup of butter or else add another 1/2 cup of flour...otherwise the smell and taste are good also used almonds instead of hazelnuts. I still make this recipe as everyone in the family likes it alot....I use walnuts or almonds chopped.   I use a little extra flour and make the biscottis wider than usual..I am saying i used 1 stick of butter only.....not the other 1/2 stick  with it.....

I just finished making these and they came out perfect.  They are crispy and not too crumbly. They taste great too.  I didn't use hazelnuts but used chopped pecans instead.  I'd love to macadamia ones next.

I have these in the oven right now for the second time this week.  They are that good!  I think the recipe is perfect as written, but I use macadamia nuts in place of hazelnuts and add white chocolate chips.  After the cookies are cut and cooled, I drizzle white chocolate over them.  This will be my standard recipe for biscotti from now on.

This is very good. I added 2 tsp of cinnamon, 2 tsp of vanilla, 1 cup of chocolate chips, walnuts instead of the hazelnuts and drizzled chocolate on top. It might have all been a little to much...the next time im not adding the chocolate chips or nuts....im just going for the cinnamon flavor.

Very, very good.  Tried using both hazelnuts and sliced almonds.  Both were delicious!  Also didn't hurt to double the cinnamon and to drizzle with chocolate afterwards!  Yummy!  Enjoy this fabulous recipe.

Very quick, easy and amazing!  I chopped the hazelnuts as other users did and left it in the oven after it was turned off. I melted choc chips in the microwave and dripped it over the top and it was really good. I've made it again with almonds and added almond extract instead of vanilla.

This recipe is terrific - I have made it several times, usually at Christmas, but sometimes at other times. Friends and family alike rave over it.
The only change I made was that I used toasted pecans instead of the hazelnuts - I found it easier to slice and the flavour with the cinnamon was amazing. I have used both white chocolate and milk chocolate to garnish, and find the milk chocolate easier to work with. I just spoon over the chocolate in drizzles; this makes it easier to decorate, rather than dipping each piece by hand.

After making the dough, I refrigerated it for 30 minutes - it made it easier to work with the dough.  I also doubled the cinnamon (2 tsp.) amount and baked it longer - made the 10 minute part about 15 minutes.  The inside seemed too soggy at 10 minutes.  I also dipped them in semi-sweet chocolate on one side.  If you can get hazelnuts, by all means it does have a better taste.  My friend came over for coffee this morning and raved about them.  Would definitely make them again.

I made these without the hazelnuts, and they *still* turned out great. I made them into "mini" biscotti by making four loaves instead of two and baking them for 5 fewer minutes on the first bake.

We have "Cookie Wednesday" in my office.  Each Wednesday, someone brings in cookies.  On my day, I usually try to bring in something not so ordinary.  You'll never see me carry in chocolate chip cookies, or anything store bought.  I made these a few weeks back and left the nuts out (due to allergies of co-workers) and now everyone wants me to bring them in EVERY time my wednesday rolls around.  Not one person didn't like them.  That's definitely worthy of 5-stars.

I had to leave a review on this delicious recipe! I followed the cookie part of it exactly, but I didn't have hazelnuts, and I made this as a present for my husband for Christmas; so I added chopped almonds and a big ol' handful of cranberries! I baked as instructed and this was/IS the most delicious biscotti I've EVER made! The cookie is perfect and I can tell it will hold whatever I choose to throw into it! Sooo much better than any I've bought! This is going to be a staple in my house since we are coffee drinkers! 
Thank you for this recipe, it's glorious!

This is fantastic!  I made the recipe as is, but I was out of hazelnuts so I substituted pecans and it's absolutely wonderful.  After I sliced the cookies and baked them the second time, I left them in the oven after I turned the oven off and by the time the oven cooled the cookies had that perfect crunchy/crispy texture.  I see lots of these in my future.

Really delicious! I doubled the cinnamon and sprinkled a bit of it on top of the cookie loaf before putting it in the oven. That made the cinnamon flavor really stand out. Add a drizzle of chocolate and these are divine!

Really good!  Needed a lot of bench flour since the dough was really mushy and sticky.  I always cut my biscotti hot to avoid breaking them.  These aren't very sweet which is fantastic in my book!

Once I found this recipe, I haven't even bothered looking for another biscotti recipe. It's the perfect base for any adaptations. I wrote about my adaptation on my blog: confessionsofabrighteyedbaker.com, but these are the basics: I use 2 tsp of almond extract rather than the vanilla extract and skip the cinnamon so as to concentrate on the almond flavor. I either use 1 cup of slivered almonds or leave out the nuts altogether. I also prefer crispier biscotti than the original recipe makes, so I recommend doing the second bake for 10 minutes on each side. Once the biscotti have cooled, I pour melted dark chocolate on top (about 1 cup), and sprinkle slivered almonds over the chocolate.

I was envious when I viewed everyone's Biscotti photos, but those were what convinced me that I too could make this if everyone else could. It is a great recipe. I made it exactly as directed with the exception of adding about 3/4 cup of craisins. I melted semi-sweet chocolate and iced my Biscottie. I also baked them for an additional 10 minutes after slicing and then I turned off the oven and left them in while the oven cooled. Otherwise I think they would have been too soft.

I followed this recipe exactly and had superior results. I tried three different biscotti recipes (Cranberry Almond and Chocolate Almond), but this one definitely was the best! I dipped some in melted bakers semi-sweet chocolate, drizzled some with melted white chocolate, and dusted some in a mixture of granulated sugar and cinnamon. They were so good!!

Absolutely delicious. I didn't have hazelnuts so I used 1/2 c. of leftover chocolate chips instead. I also rushed a little and baked at 375 for exactly 23 minutes, cut the loaf and put the slices in the oven and turned off the heat so they crisped up while I was out of the house. Incredibly good!!

I have to give these biscotti 5 stars, despite that I found them a bit too sweet, because they really were delicious! Next time I'll reduce the sugar by about 1/4 cup. Used roughly chopped almonds. Didn't last long at our house!

These turned out beautifully! The taste is fantastic and the presentation is great! I followed the directions of previous posters and only used 1/2 cup butter. I also added an extra 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. I used flaked filberts. I also took one of the recommendations of the previous posters and sprinkled some cinnamon-sugar on top during the first bake. The smell was absolutely amazing! I plan to dip the ends in milk chocolate and give them as a gift with the double chocolate biscotti (also from all recipes) that I made yesterday). Thanks for the great recipe!

This was the first time I made biscotti, and they turned out great.  I love hazelnuts, but in this recipe, 1 cup is a lot of nuts.  I thought they were a bit overwhelming.  Next time I will put in only 1/2 to 3/4 cup at the most.  The recipe didn't specify, so I chopped the hazelnuts.  I also added 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips.  For me, this made them perfect.

I recommend you make these a day in advace, they tasted better the next day. This biscotti recipe was was to crumbly, to sweet, and it called for way to many hazelnuts. It was very hard to work with. Tasted more like a blandish sugary butter cookie than a biscotti. I will not be making this recipe again.

This biscotti was fantastic!  The dough wasn't quite as sticky as some I've encountered, and that made it a little easier to work with.  I added three times the cinnamon that it called for and used almonds instead of hazelnuts and the end result was awesome!  I made them for a class of mine and every single one disappeared right away

These were great-- I love the hazelnut flavor. I made these and the Chocolate Cherry Biscotti from this site and gave as Christmas gifts. They were quite easy to make and I didn't have any problems with crumbling. I used the reynolds non-stick aluminum foil, which was useful for lifting the log to the cutting board. Next time I will substitute almond extract for 1/2 the vanilla because they were missing that almond flavor that, to me, makes biscotti biscotti. very good nonetheless!

I tried this recipe for the first time and the biscotti turned out fantastic! My husband thinks they are the best he'd ever tasted, even compared to store bought cookies. I didn't have hazelnuts on hand, but used almonds instead and it tasted great. My family & friends just can't get enough of them. This cookie recipe is a definite keeper!

This was an easy recipe.  My family LOVED the biscotti.  I didn't have the hazelnuts on hand so I divided the batter and mixed half with slivered almonds and the other half with chopped pecans.  Next time I will double the recipe, there just wasn't enough to go around.

Fantastic!  But you really need to toast the nuts first (20 minutes at 350 oven) and rub off their skins before adding them to the dough. My family agrees that these are the best biscotti we've ever had!  And company loves them!

We have made this recipe every year for the last 4 years.  We give it as gifts to family and friends that continue to request it every year.  We keep some for ourselves!  We pretty much follow the recipe as written.  Very good.

What a wonderful recipe! It was so user friendly and easy! This was my first time making biscotti and I was so nervous because I've heard it's difficult to do well. These turned out perfect though! The perfect recipe for someone who has never made biscotti before. I'll never try another.

Toasted the hazelnuts and then peeled the skins.  Baked for longer than recipe stated to get a crunchy cookie.  Next time would increase the amount of cinnamon for a bigger flavour profile.

I'm a doctor and am always looking for healthy dessert recipes. I love the flavor, which reminds me of the cinnamon rugelach that is a popular dessert in some Jewish communities, just definitely healthier. I made the standard substitutions, reductions and omissions I discuss on my biscotti blog (www.biscottiblog.com) to make the recipe healthier, and it didn't compromise the final product. I'll continue trying to decrease the canola oil. I'll keep you posted on my progress!

This was my first attempt at making biscotti…and I will look no further for an amazing recipe!  I love the hint of cinnamon and the powerful hazelnuts.  These are perfect for dipping into a cup of hot, steamy coffee or chai tea.  You will not regret investing your time and effort into these babies!

I don't do well with baking, so when I chose to make this recipe for a gift, I decided to do a practice run first. "They were fantastic!" "Looks like they came from a store!" are the comments I've been hearing all morning. I don't like biscotti, so I haven't tried them. But I trust their opinions, so I am confident they came out very nicely. 

I did make a few changes. And when I make it the next time, I will do a couple more adjustments. On the advice of other reviewers, I doubled the cinnamon. However, my taste testers say you can still BARELY taste it. So, I'll be using 2 teaspoons of it next time. I also used less hazelnuts than called for and I did half vanilla and half almond extract. As for working with the dough, it really is very easy to work with! If you are having THAT many problems with it, you must've really messed up somewhere, is all I can say. During the actual baking process, I baked it for 25 minutes. I tried the serrated knife, but it still crumbled a little (I am going to cream the sugar and butter VERY well next time), so I'll give a butcher's knife a try next. The second time I baked them, I left them on for an extra 5 minutes and then I just shut the oven off and left them in the oven for 15 more minutes. I was a little concerned about how crispy they'd get, but they really are CRISPY! I am thrilled with the results and am very excited to give them away!

This is a lovely biscotti! I followed other reviewers' advice and used 1/2 cup butter. The basic cookie is like an empty canvas. Use your imagination. After making the first batch according to Kris's recipe, which we all loved, I began to experiment. My favorite was using almond extract, candied ginger, and lemon zest. Dip the bottom edge of cooled cookie in white chocolate, and then almonds...delicious! Kris, thank you for taking the time to share!

I thought these were pretty bland.  I also like my biscotti a bit more cruchy before you dip it in coffee.  These were almost like cake even though I baked them longer than the recipe said.

Terrific recipe! 4 stars because it does need twice the cinnamon (2 tsp) and should definitely be dipped in chocolate as the chocolate counters the dryness of biscotti. I also added a tsp of almond extract which I think was a great addition. But overall  a great recipe - minimal ingredients and so easy. Dough consistency was perfect.

These are yummy!!!  I made 3 batches in 1 week!  I never dipped or drizzled them in chocolate or they probably would have gone faster!! I have a couple suggestions when baking though.  The batter is a the consistence of a thicker cake mix so just spoon it right onto the cookie sheets.  My sheets are old and not non-stick so I definetly recommend the parchment paper (you can get it on a roll in the grocery store near the aluminum foil and wax paper).  Cut them with a pizza cutter when they are right out of the oven, the longer they cool the crispier they get, then turn them on their side when they are cool enough to handle. These are so good!!! Coffee isn't the same without them!

I decreased the butter to 1/2 cup, doubled the cinnamon, and added an additional 1/2 cup of flour. These smelled awesome while baking and have a great cinnamon taste.

Skinning the hazelnuts was a huge chore, but worth the extra effort.  I blanched them in boiling water for about 3 minutes, drained, then dunked in cold water to loosen the skin.  After the skin was removed, I toasted them until crunchy.  The biscotti were a huge hit with my hubby and my coworkers.  I dipped one side in melted dark or white chocolate.  Then I immediately dipped the chocolate covered side into crushed hazelnuts.  Both versions were very tasty and pretty.

I toasted the hazelnuts and chopped them before adding them. I also added 1/4 cup chopped dried cranberries which I tossed in 1 tsp. flour before adding. They were delicious.

So wonderful that I want to go eat another one while I write this!

I didn't have vanilla extract or hazelnuts on hand, so this is what I did instead: I used 1 teaspoon of Almond extract (I added less just in case it would be too overwhelming to add a full 1 1/2 tsp.) and I used 1/2 tsp. Cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. Nutmeg (to make up for the lack of nuts). This came out so sweet, so tasty...once I figure out how to cut them so that they don't all fall to pieces on me, I could make them to give as gifts! YUM!!!

The first time I made this recipe it turned out really crumbly. I was planning on giving the biscotti as a present, but they looked awful after they crumbled and broke. However the second time I made it, I cookied it for  35 min at 325 deg, then I cut them and baked them for another 25 min, turning them once. After the adjustment to the recipe they turned out perfectly. I'll definately make them again with the changes!

This biscotti I made for Christmas really wonderful! I halved the sugar, replaced hazelnut with walnut (I roast them & coarsely chopped them before adding to dough) and shaped dough to 4 logs instead of 2; baked for 25 minutes, they were smaller but taste excellent. I coated one cut face with melted choc. Everyone loves them. I will double the cinnamon when making them again.

The dough tends to spread out a bit while baking so I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and chilled the batter for about an hour.  I also used pecans because I didn't have hazelnuts.  They came out great.  I had to hide them from my husband because I'm giving them as gifts.  Definitely a must try recipe.

These were great! I did toast the hazelnuts and finely chopped them in the food processor before adding to recipe. Also, I used homemade butter. I was unsure of the dimension to roll it out so I rolled it out 12" X 4 1/2". Next time I'll aim for 12" X 3" and hopefully it will bake to 13" X 3 1/2 - 4". Decorated with chocolate, white chocolate, and more coarsely chopped toasted hazelnuts. I tried some with and without the additional chocolate and nuts and it is super sweet either way. Maybe I'll use 3/4 cup sugar for plain biscotti, 1/2 cup for chocolate covered, and replace the sugar with my sugar/stevia blend.

I made these as part of my cookie trays (Dec '11).  I drizzled them with white and dark chocolate and they looked fantastic!  They did soften up quite a bit, so I might increase the second baking time next time.

I didn't find them too great--I thought they were kind of bland, but everyone else LOVED them.

These are wonderful...a real keeper.  I've tried lots of biscotti recipes and this is one of the best.  I made them exactly like the recipe said.  I used a pastry scraper to cut them when they came out of the oven.  Worked like a charm!  Thank you!

These were great! I had hazelnuts hanging out in my cabinet and I thought this would be a great way to use them. They were! But now I have to buy more hazelnuts to make them again! Softer and lighter  than a lot of biscotti but still nice and crisp, a perfect compliment to coffee.

Wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly, and got great results! I found that the thicker they are, the better they turned out for me. Three things to keep in mind: 1. Take the skins off the hazelnuts. 2. Dry them out really well for that real Italian biscotti 3. Turn them over! Thank you!! Def. a keeper :) I put chocolate on them and put them out by the coffeemaker for my coworkers. They were ALL gone!!

I really like the dough consistency in this recipe, and I will be using this as my base from now on.  With my old recipe, I frequently had trouble with the dough crumbling when I cut it.  I didn't have that problem at all with this recipe, and the dough didn't spread during baking.  Thanks!

The recipe was very good. Easy to mix and good flavor. However, being the first time I've made biscotti I thought the shaping directions were confusing and vague. I also don't think that biscotti is usually cut in 1/2 inch increments as called for in the recipe... more like 1 to 1.5 inches. Still, great for dipping in coffee!

I don't usually even like biscotti - but these are fabulous and SO easy! I added cinnamon chips and used slivered almonds rather than hazelnuts. If you really want to get fancy, you could push raw sugar into the top before baking the first time, but they don't need it. The recipe made at least 3 dozen (I made them on the smaller side) and they were gone in the matter of a couple of days.

This was my first time making biscotti and they came out great!!  I did follow other reviewers suggestions as follows:  2/3 cup butter, 2 t cinnamon, 3/4 cup toasted pecans, 1 t vanilla extract and 1/2 t almond extract.  The only thing I changed on the baking time was to turn the oven off at the end and leave the cookies in for about 5 minutes.  They came out with the perfect amount of crunch.  Also drizzling melted chocolate over cookies is a must.  I will definitely make these again!!

this is the best biscotti recipe i have used.It turns out perfectly texture and flavorwise every time I make them.I have doubled tripled and quadrupled with no bad effects, and have used the basic recipe for every variation i can come up with. They are always the first to go and everyone who eats them thinks they are fab.

These are excellent but would not classify them as a 'cinnamon' biscotti - there is really no cinnamon flavor with only 1 tsp. of cinnamon. If you double the cinnamon & drizzle with melted white chocolate, they are awesome!

WOW. This was my first biscotti attempt, and it turned out wonderfully. I had no troubles with the recipe, and I followed it exactly, other than using damselfish's idea for peeling the hazelnuts (thanks damselfish!) I chopped the nuts into small chunks and did not prebake them. This biscotti was easy, fun to make, and got rave reviews when I served them. They are also wonderful dipped in milk or coffee!

I chopped and toasted the hazelnuts, used 100% whole wheat flour, almond extract, and added a handful of chocolate chips.  Shaped and baked on parchment paper.  By far the easiest biscotti dough i've EVER worked with!  It was like clay, a dream!  Maybe the the whole wheat flour made the difference, but since no reviewers are complaining about "sticky dough" or any other of the usual biscotti issues, i'm guessing it's just a great recipe no matter how you change it.  Thank you for this recipe!!!

These were just fabulous!!  I covered them with foil during the last 10 minute of baking.  After they're done, turn off the oven and let them sit inside until almost cool (check them from time to time to make sure they're not too done).  They got nice and crunchy.

Fabulous!
I toasted the hazelnuts (10 minutes at 350 degrees) and then coarsely chopped them.  I substituted one cup of whole wheat flour and cut back a little on the sugar.  I also threw in some dark chocolate chunks... and they are wonderful!

I'll be doing a white and dark chocolate drizzle and boy, will the boyfriend be extremely happy!

This was the first time I tried to make biscotti and it turned out great!  I used almonds instead of hazelnuts (couldn't find them anywhere) and followed other's comments to double the cinnamon and dip in white chocolate.

Pretty good. I'm not sure I love the cinnamon, but it was OK. I also had to cook them much longer than it called for. I turned the heat down and just kept checking on them until they got hard.

The recipe sounded good, but came out terrible. It was way too crumbly and the flavor was not good. I think it was the hazelnuts. Even my husband who will pretty much eat anything, didnt care for it. Anyways, I will stick with the Spring Biscotti and Brownie Biscotti, that is on this site.

Great, easy to use recipe. I used pecans instead of hazlenut b/c I was short on time and didn't feel like shelling the nuts. This was my first time baking biscotti and it came out great!

Way too sweet and not the right consistency for biscotti.  The cinnamon also seemed out of place.  I won't be making these again.

This biscotti was excellent. My brother and I made a batch for a Mother's Day gift. We did have to add a little milk/water to the dough, as it was a little dry.

Wonderful. I haven't ever had biscotti, but my mums loves it so I decided to try this recipe out. Everything worked perfect! I didn't have to alter a thing. The most delicious cookie ever. I dipped them in melted dark chocolate and they were awesome. Good job.

This recipe yields a not too sweet, delicately cinnamon flavored biscotti with a lovely  texture. I used 2 tsp cinnamon and drizzled the biscotti with while chocolate. La dolce vita!

This is a great recipe, even for the first-time-biscotti-maker like me.  It is not hard at all.  I dipped one edge in chocolate (melted chocolate chips with a little shortening over a double boiler).  People at the potluck RAVED and were so impressed that they were homemade.

These were so good; I made them for the holidays and am still taking them out of the freezer occasionally to dip in coffee.  The hardest part was having to crack all of the hazelnuts; I couldn't find them anywhere that were out of the shell.  This will not stop me from making again, which will be very soon as my supply in the freezer is almost gone!

It's tough to rate this.  On taste, it gets 5 stars.  But on making it, and the ingredients, 3 stars.  I took other reviewer's suggestions and reduced the butter to 1/2 C. and doubled the cinnamon.  I hadn't ever worked with hazelnuts before (which, btw, are aka filberts).  My books said to roast them on a cookie sheet, and then rub the skin off using a dish towel. I roasted for 20 minutes and still didn't get any significant skin off.  So, I chopped them up in my vitamix.  They were fine.  Although, I don't know that they were necessarily better than using almonds or walnuts.

This was the second time I've made biscotti.  The first time was using a cooking light recipe which I like better with regard to the butter.  Obviously less of it, but I also don't remember that the cookies spread so much in the oven.  I think I'll use that basic recipe instead, and then just add the cinnamon and nuts next time.  But, they are very tasty and smell great as is.

Easy and excellent.  I reduce the amount of butter to 2/3 cup and added a dash each of nutmeg and ginger.  Next time I will chop the hazelnuts for better presentation and double the cinnamon.

Awesome!  As others suggested, I doubled amount of cinnamon, toasted hazelnuts for 15 minutes @ 375, and dipped some of them in chocolate, but it was not necessary.  A very good recipe!

This recipe was yummy! It was very easy to make and tasted wonderful. I brought it to a party and everyone ate it up! I even got asked to make it for another party coming soon! ***To make the biscotti even more appealing, dip half of the biscotti in melted chocolate...it tastes great and it looks good too! Thanks Kris!

This one is a keeper! I did coarsely chop the Hazelnuts as suggested by another review. It helps from the cookies breaking when you slice. Next time I may even add an extra dash of cinnamon. Thanks for sharing.

This was a great recipe.  This was my first time making biscotti..extremely easy.  I made these for gifts for my coffee-drinking friends.  I kept a couple for myself since they were so good.
I didn't have trouble with the crumbling either..actually I had no problems with the recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe, the biscotti turned out beautifully and tasted equally as great!! I took them to a morning coffee group and everyone wanted the recipe...a winner! One note...I roughly chopped the hazelnuts before mixing so the logs would be easier to slice.

If you don't love this recipe, you don' love biscotti.  I have been making it for years, many different recipes, and this takes the cake.  It is really simple and you can modify the extracts, and nuts and it is simply delicious.

I substitute the hazelnut with 1/2 cup sliced almonds and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. I also split the extract and do 3/4tsp vanilla extract and 3/4tsp almond extract.  Best biscotti recipe I've found so far.  Next try will be with dried cherries and white chocolate chips....sooooo many options. Thanks for this recipe!

This is a great recipe and special thanks to Sue who suggested cutting them while they are hot with a bench scraper--just chop and they come out great!  While great by themselves, I did add a layer of chocolate to the  bottom of each--easy enough to do, just microwave some semi sweet chocolate and let cool a bit then spread or dip and let cool and dry.  I think once you have the basic recipe down, you can substitute various nuts, fruits and candies as you desire.  Love them!

We have tried about 3 other Biscotti recipes and I will have to say this one was simple and the dough was fantastic to work with.  We doubled the cinnamon and went rogue by adding 1/2 tsp ground cloves, 4 Tbsp Ghiradelli bitter chocolate, 3/4 c chocolate chips, substituted 1 c chopped pecans instead of hazelnuts and dusted the loaves with the chocolate powder and cinnamon before baking. Neat texture when all sliced up.  Have decided to make this our 'base Biscotti' recipe for any other flavor combinations we decide.  

The house smells awesome as we get ready for the holiday spirit to take over,,,,thanks to whoever put this winner together!  Happy Holidays!

This is the favorite biscotti recipe of my daughter and I. The dough is not terribly sticky so it is fairly easy to work with. I add about 1/4tsp more of cinnamon than the recipe calls for because that is our personal taste.  We were making them for holiday baskets so we also melted some cinnamon chips and drizzled them over the top which gave them a beautiful look and kicked up the cinnamon quotient a notch and they were great!!

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I was not fond of the cinnamon component.  It wasn't that it was bad...I just like to dip mine in tea or coffee and I didn't feel that the cinnamon went with that.  I didn't have enough Hazelnuts, so I did half hazelnuts half almonds.  

I'm just making a second batch now, omitting the cinnamon, subbed 1/2 ts of vanilla for almond extract and added mocha gel flavoring and walnuts.  I think this is an awesome base recipe to play with and add whatever you like!

First Biscotti try in my life and it worked great. It takes sometime to have the biscottis get hard as cookies, but I just left them a little longer and they were perfect. I even added some burnt cajeta, honey and brown sugar :)

Fabulous biscotti recipe.  I didn't have hazelnuts on hand, so I used toasted walnuts instead.  I made these as a dipper for chocolate fondue, and they worked out perfectly.  I popped the rest in the freezer, and then I just ate plain or dunked in coffee.  This recipe has been added to my list of holiday cookies, which I give away to family, friends, and co-workers.

I make these a lot. I recently gave some to my brother-in-law whose family is from Italy. He shared them with his parents and they said these are the best biscotti they have ever had. I do use almonds instead of hazelnuts and I add 1/4 tsp of almond extract. They are perfect!

So delicious!  Not overly crunchy, but just right.  I've been looking for a good biscotti recipe for a long long time.  I'm so glad I tried this.  Definitely going to make these again.  They don't need to go in for 30 minutes.  I wasn't watching it and it was almost burnt.  I would say 15 to 20 minutes.  This is a great base for many other flavours.

Yum, yum, yum...these were superb.  They were excellent...not too soft nor too hard like most biscotti I have tasted.  I didn't have hazelnuts, so I added 1/2 cup of crasions and 1/2 cup of almonds.  Once they had cooled down I dipped one side in white chocolate.  Everyone enjoyed them with their tea and coffee.  I will definitely be making these again.  They will make a nice winter treat!

Great Biscotti.  I doubled the cinnamon, and used pecans instead of hazelnuts, otherwise followed the recipe.  My batch actually made 3 logs of 12" length x 3" wide - 36 cookies.  The dough was fairly soft and I needed a spatula to finish forming the logs.  Next time, I will form 4 logs 2" wide and get 48 slices.  Wonderful taste, beautifully crisp and crunchy.  I did bake them a little longer because I forgot about them but even still they taste wonderful.  I'll be making them again for sure, very soon. UPDATE: One thing I forgot to note - I finely grind the nuts so that the mixture holds together better and the pecan flavor disperses better.  Made these dozens of times - now I always double the recipe.

I've made this recipe twice, once for my family, and the other for a party. Everyone has loved it, even without anything to dip it in. I drizzle with white chocolate or leave plain. My second batch, I boiled, peeled, chopped, and then honey roasted my hazelnuts. Although time consuming, the result was spectacular.

This was a great recipe!  I made a few slight changes.  I rediced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I also added more cinnamon and a pinch or two of nutmeg.  Cut these a little thicker as I like a tiny bit of softness to my biscotti and baked them slightly linger (2-3 min).  I did not dip or drizzle with chocolate but will try that the next time!  These were extremely easy to make and are fantastic for days after.  Wonderful with coffee or tea...Thanks for a great recipe!

delicious! We all loved these and when asked for more I needed to improvise as I run out some of the ingredients. I used half chopped walnuts and half ground hazelnuts and all the rest the same and it was also fantastic!

Since I didn't have any hazelnuts I altered the recipe and used almonds and cranberries instead.  I didn't really care for the almonds but loved the cranberries. I'll need to try the original receipe sometime soon.  I took these to a party and everyone loved them... "much better than the store-bought version" was the compliment of the evening.

Great recipe! Came out perfect! I didnt have hazelnuts on hand, so I used pecans instead and they were a huge hit with the cookie baskets I made for christmas gifts. Thanks for this wonderful recipe! I will never eat store bought again!

This was my first time making biscotti. My grandma absolutely loves this stuff... I ended up using some almond extract in it as well and also used milk chocolate chips to coat the biscotti. I did have to back the 1/2in slices longer to get the correct hardness that I know my grandma likes. I tried these myself and love them and the chocolate makes them oh so much more better! I will be making thi recipe again!!!

after making this recipe, I was extremely disappointed because the hazelnuts all fell out of the baked cookie logs. They should've been chopped, and the recipe did not say that. The flavor of the bisotti itself is good, but i came out with a lot of waste due to the nuts falling out of the cookie.

Fabulous!  This was my first time ever making biscotti so I was a little nervous, but the recipe was extremely easy to follow and they turned out wonderfully!  My husband even thought I bought them at a coffee shop!  I'll definitely be making these again.

Very good recipe.  This is the first time I've ever made Biscotti and it turned out beautifully.  I left my biscotti in the oven after cooking time and it turned out nice and crunchy.  It is also important to use a serated bread knife and it will cut your biscotti without crumbling or putting pressure on the warm dough.

Update: I made these again and they were not good.  I finally figured out I used 3/4 stick of butter - not 3/4 Cup of butter. Big difference, learn from my  mistake. They weren't so bad we couldn't eat them, just extra dense and little too crumbly.  I wonder if that's what others did who have complained of them being too dense or crumbly. Original: Wow! So easy and so good! I must say that I had a hard time believing anyone could "shape doough into a log" and "place logs on baking sheet." My dough was more like a wet batter, but I managed.  I almost decided I must've forgotten a cup of flour and needed to put more in. Thankfully I didn't because the final product was out of this world. I didn't have hazelnuts on hand so subbed with 1/2 chopped pecans and 1/2 chocolate chips. Left them in the warm oven as others suggested.

This was really good and smelled terrific while it was baking!  The only problem was that the biscotti started to break when I tried to cut it, so I ended up with half a batch of smaller pieces.  Fortunately, it didn't affect the taste - fabulous!

I made my first batch of biscotti using this recipe. They're perfectly sweet and just great without nuts. I'll double the cinnamon the next time if I want them to be "cinnamony." Also, I tried sprinkling cinnamon sugar mixture on top of the cookies before the second round of baking, but it wasn't worth it. I rated this five stars because this can be a good basic biscotti recipe for some tweaks e.g. omitting cinnamon and subbing vanilla for coconut extract. Thanks for such a versatile recipe!

I loved this recipe! This was my first time making biscotti and they came out perfect. I drizzled them with white chocolate and gave them out as gifts this Christmas. Everyone loved them. To think what people spend on these at Star"bucks" when you can have these fresh at home in about an hour.

This was the first biscotti recipe I ever tried.  Awesome!  I omitted the nuts since my husband can't eat them, and doubled the cinnamon.  I had no trouble with crumbling and the taste was amazing.  This year, I will make them and drizzle a little chocolate over as other reviewers have suggested and give as gifts to my co-workers.

These biscotti were very tasty, but the butter-to-flour ratio is off, resulting in a very sticky dough and cookies that spread more than they were intended to. When I make these biscotti again, I will use 1/2 c. butter and start at 2 1/4 c. flour, adding more as needed.

I will also bake 10 minutes on each side once the cookies have been sliced - they were definitely not as hard as biscotti are supposed to be.

Fragrant and perfect texture. Simple recipe and toasting the hazelnuts goes a long way. The sugar is just right - not too sweet. Thank you for sharing!

Very easy to make considering it was my first time making biscotti. Very tasty! Threw in some craisins for a bit of colour. Would consider doubling the receipe next time as it make approx. 18 pieces.

These biscotti are so good!  I find them hard to stop eating.  The only change I made was to use only half a cup of the hazelnuts.  I liked that they were a tiny bit softer than the store bought biscotti I've had.

I gave this recipe three stars because I had such trouble with the biscotti being crumbly but not because of the taste.  They smelled and tasted wonderful.  I drizzled a little melted chocolate on them, and my husband loved them, but he also thought that they were too crumbly.  I wasn't able to use these biscotti for my cookie swap as I had planned because they were so crumbly and just didn't present very well.

This came out pretty good, although I think it will need to be baked a bit longer (on the first bake), as they came out a little soggy.  The second bake didn't help dry them out.  Wonderful flavor!

The hint of cinnamon was just perfect. Not overwhelming and not too subtle either. I used almonds instead of hazelnuts and it was great. These spread a lot on the pan (the first time they are in the oven) so make sure they are far enough apart. Also, after slicing them I had to bake them for an extra 10-15 minutes on top of what was required in the recipe.

A great recipe and great base as well.  I am going to try a batch of these with cranberries and orange zest as well.  Drizzled with hazlenut chocolate when cool.  Very easy and taste professional.  Dough was super-easy to handle as well.

Wow! I've never made biscotti before but I've had it at coffee shops and I never like it.  I love this!  I can't believe how good this is, even without dipping it.  It's not as hard as other biscotti.  I didn't have any trouble cutting it.  One thing I did change was only use 1/2 cup hazelnuts and like everyone said, I doubled the cinnamon.  I made this for a Christmas gift for my Mother-in-law and I'll definitely make it again!

These were wonderful.  I used pecans rather than hazelnuts and they turned out perfectly. 

Will make these again soon!

Delicious and very easy to make.  Used food processor for sugar/eggs/vanilla/eggs.  Doubled cinnamon.  I think I preferred the chocolate chip batch to the hazelnut batch.  Everyone at work loved them!

These were fantastic, I took them to an art show opening and they were devoured.  I would next time be interested in adding more spices.  Maybe cardamon or all spice?  Just a thought, but over all fantastic.

These are GOOD. Made them last year for Christmas and received tons of raves! They disappeared quickly, too. Just a really yummy, cinnamony, nutty biscotti. I will be making these again this year.

This is my first attempt at a biscotti cookie and it was a success. I did not have hazelnuts on hand so I used almonds. Next time I'll try almond extract. I also drizzled chocolate on some of them. My aunt loves biscotti's and she said that they were delish!

Following others recommendations, I cut the butter down to 1/2 c. then added 1/3 c. mini choc. chips and cut the hazelnuts down to 3/4 c. After they were all done I dipped the bottoms in melted choc. chips with a little crisco mixed in. These were wonderful! And YES! My house smelled good all day! So easy- my first try at making biscotti.

This is a great recipe!! I followed the recipe word for word, and the biscotti's turned out wonderfully! I like chocolate on my biscotti, so I did add a drizzle of it as a finishing touch, but they did not need the chocolate, i just enjoy it! I will defiantly make this recipe again! Thank you!

Incredible!  These were very very easy to make and everyone who tried them loved them!  Multiple people told me they were they best biscotti's they'd ever had.  I used almonds instead of hazelnuts and I added a little extra vanilla.  Also, try sprinkling with cinnamon and sugar before baking.  Yum!

Excellent.  I have made these for gifts and now think it was a mistake.  Everyone wants more!  The butter recipe beats out the oil recipe, by a long shot. However it is a bit more naughty on the heart healthy diet.

I'd never made, nor tasted biscotti before, but had hazelnuts on hand, which is rare for me.  These looked and tasted good with a chocolate drizzle on top and went over well with my Christmas guests.  I expected them to be very crisp like melba toast, but they were not, thankfully.  They didn't need to be dunked to be good.  We liked the texture and the taste.  The only improvement might be to use hazelnut extract to enhance the flavor of the nuts.  I'll definitely make these again.

These were great! I didn't have any hazelnuts on hand so I just omitted the them all together and added 1 teaspoon almond extract instead. I also decreased the amount of butter to 1/2 cup. They smelled heavenly while baking and I would definitely use this recipe again!

This recipe has potential.  I followed it to a "t" and the dough "logs" spread out all over my baking sheet in the oven, forming more like one large hazelnut cookie.  I should have read more of the reviews first and decreased the butter to a 1/2 cup and perhaps added a bit more flour to get the dough to hold its shape.  Even though it didn't work, I tasted it, and it does have an excellent taste.  Now if only it would hold up in the oven like a biscotti!  I am going to try again by decreasing the butter and increasing the flour, if need be.

I tasted this as I was making it because I wasn't sure if there was enough cinnamon.  It was very good but I decided to put an egg wash on top and sprinkle cinnamon sugar on it.  They came out great.  I will definately make them again and again.

Used a 1/4 c of amaretto (extra flour to compensate) and 1 1/4 c hazelnuts in hopes of intensifying the nut flavor, didn't work. Still this biscotti has an excellent  flavor. I did double the cinnamon as suggested. Next time I will grind extra hazelnuts to a paste and add it to my dough. I also think adding mini chocolate chips would enhance this already good recipe.

I'd never made biscotti before--I always thought it would be too hard or complicated, but I thought I'd give this a try for my Christas gift baskets (Fireside Delights with banana bread, chai tea and hot cocoa mixes, all from allrecipes, of course)and I was amazed at how easy these were to make!  Also, they make the house smell amazing and they are absolutely delicious.  I melted some dark chocolate with a bit of shortening and spread it on the back of these.  I hated to give these away--I can't wait to make another batch for myself!!

This recipe was great!  I made these  (as an anniversary gift, along with Starbucks coffee beans) for my brother and sister-in-law's anniversary.  Not only do they make the house smell delicious..they taste delicious!  After smelling what was baking, my husband begged me for a slice of the biscotti...He said it was better than what they sell in coffee houses and told me buy something else for my brother, cause he wanted to eat the entire batch! Will definitely make again for gifts -especially for the coffee drinkers in the family!

This is a good cookie, it has a nice delicate flavor, but I recommend toasting the nuts before using in the recipe they have a much more nutty taste. The next time I make this I will use mixed nuts and add nutmeg. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I love cinnamon and I like not too sweet desserts, so this definitely worked for me.  I've made it at Christmas for the past couple of years, but it'd be great anytime.  It keeps for a really long time, too, so that's nice.  Oh, almonds work just fine if that's what you have on hand.

THIS WAS EXCELLENT!! I HAD NEVER HAD BISCOTTI, BUT I LOVED THIS.  IT WAS HARD TO FIND HAZELNUTS, SO I SUBSTITUTED SLICED ALMONDS, AND THEY TASTED DELICIOUS.  EVERYONE GOBBLED THEM UP.

This recipe is definitely a keeper! Everyone at work asked for the recipe and in 2 hours, the 2 batches I made last night were gone! I did use walnuts instead of hazelnuts, and added 5 minutes to the suggested baking times. (I like my biscotti a little harder). As some people suggested, I also added 1 more teaspoon of cinnamon, which made all the difference. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I've used severeal biscotti recipes, but this one is my favorite.  I use almond and vanilla extract and extra cinnamon.  I also use sliced almonds since I never have hazelnuts.  I wet my hands when forming the dough and I have no problems. I cut the loaves while still warm with a serrated knife, then I bake them over 10 minutes on each side until they are slightly brown.  Mmmm, I can smell them already.

This was my first time making biscotti and it was really easy and they came out terrific.  I substituted the hazelnuts for sliced almonds and substituted some of the vanilla extract with almond extract.  I gave them as a christmas gift and everyone is still talking about them.

Delicious biscotti. Makes my house smell wonderful. I chose to use almonds instead of hazelnuts, because I like them better, then forgot to add them.  I threw a handful onto the ball of dough on the cookie sheet and worked them in. Still excellent!

We had fun making this biscotti to send to family and friends over the holidays.  It's a great complement to hot chocolate or coffee gifts.  We all enjoyed it, and at a church dessert pot luck it was a hit as well.

This is a very good recipe, however you may need to adjust your second baking time.Using a gas oven, I found that I had to bake the individual strips for about 8 minutes on each side.

I'm not much of a baker per se, and this was my first attempt at making biscotti.  It was super easy, although I flubbed up the recipe and made ONE loaf instead of two (no big deal, each piece just turned out longer).  These turned out great and my very picky husband loved them.  Made them two days ago and I think there are 2 left.  I'm thinking of making another batch and dipping half of each piece in chocolate.  Great idea for holiday treat gifts too.

This is a great recipe.  I plan to order Hazlenuts every year now that I have a great recipe to utilize them in.  These biscotti are somewhat crumbly but when I add three egg yolks to the recipe, it helps this some.  A great recipe either way.

I used chopped pecans instead of hazelnuts(which I didn't have).  I also dipped mine in melted white chocolate and sprinkled them with cinnamon/sugar mixture.  They taste great--my only complaint is that they are not really crispy.

I used the a little bit of the insides of a vanalla bean, rather than vanilla extract.  This made them smell even better.  These were amazing!  Not overpowered with cinnamon, which I prefer.  The texture reminded me of shortbread.  Everyone liked them!!!

Made this a zillion times. I just made a gingerbread biscotti and it only asked for 1/3 cup butter, so I did the same for this recipe. I wanted it more dry/crunchy. Also I use almonds instead cause they are cheaper

This recipe was nice and easy to make. I made a double batch but I don't recommend doing that. My KitchenAid artisan mixer could not handle that much dough at once. My mixing bowl detached from the base several times. But if you're just making one batch I'm sure my mixer would handle that easily. I measured out the amount of hazelnuts as instructed, then I chop them up into smaller pieces. I did not bother removing the scans from the hazelnuts. After it was done I didn't notice any bitterness from the peel. I accidentally missed adding the salt but other than that I followed the directions and ingredients exactly. Did the Scotty ended up being nice and crispy but not to dance with just enough flavour but I didn't regret not cutting it in chocolate. This is a great recipe and I will definitely make it again.

I roast and chop the hazelnuts first. Instead of baking for 30 minutes, followed by another 10 minutes at 350 degrees, I bake them for 20 minutes at 350 degrees, then turn the temp down to 325 degrees an bake another 10-15 minutes. The texture is perfect for dipping in hot coffee and doesn't fall apart as easily as store bought brands.

I always make biscotti for Christmas, and wanted to try a new recipe. I was quite happy with the way this turned out, and will keep the recipe to use again. The texture was perfect. The hazelnuts probably needed to be chopped a bit. The flavor is very subtle, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but could maybe use a boost with something like chocolate.

I made these but I didn`t have hazelnuts so i substituted almonds - they still tasted delicious, but looked very white.  If I made them again I would add some chocolate drizzle, or some kind of colour to them to make them look a bit more appetizing.  I also added additional cinnamon (1/2 tsp more), as I felt the recipe could use a bit more.  All in all, tasted great.

So, I'm a dough/batter girl.  If that tastes amazing, then chances are - the final product will be also. :)  This is a really very easy and  versatile base recipe for other flavors - I made mine with lightly roasted almonds and 1/2 cup cranberries (along with the cinnamon) and called it Cinnamon AlmondBerry Biscotti. Sounds unusual, but the flavors play off of each other so well together!  The first batch I made, I used the entire 3/4 cup of butter, I do think it was a little much, so I made a 2nd batch (same night!), using only 1/2 cup of butter and a tad bit less of the sugar. I think it was much better, but that's just my opinion!  :)

Doubled the recipe, but original amount of cinnamon. Half vanilla, half lemon extract. Lightly toasted pine nuts, slightly chopped. Will be using this recipe often!

I absolutely love this biscotti! I have made it for years now around the holidays and it has become a requested favorite from my family. With that said, here are some tips on how I perfected my recipe. :)

Usually, I substitute almonds since hazelnuts can be hard to come by and are expensive. Even with the almonds, they are delicious. They are not as hard as traditional biscotti which I don't mind. 

I know others have mentioned that the biscotti is delicate and crumbles easily. I found a fix that seems to help with this. When preparing the nuts I grind them in my Ninja blender until it is becomes more of a powder. This allows the nuts to mix into the dough while reducing the air pockets that result in the crumbling. 
After they are done baking, I let them cool (sometimes by putting them in the freezer for about 5-10minutes) then I melt semi-sweet chocolate in a double boiler and drizzle it over the top of the biscotti. Make sure the biscotti is chilled or at least room temp before you drizzle the chocolate otherwise it will get too runny and make a mess. Once I've drizzled the chocolate, I pop them back in the freezer for another 5-10 to let the chocolate set. This step is especially helpful if you plan to package the biscotti for gifts as it keeps the chocolate drizzle from getting messed up and looking like a blob. 

I hope this helps! Enjoy the biscotti!

Phenomenal. Oh my word. Delicious on their own, dunked in chai tea, coffee, etc. I coated the bottom side in semi-sweet chocolate, and my mother almost devoured the entire batch. As for the hazelnuts, I struggled. Apparently the trick is to boil 3 cups of water, add 3 tbs baking soda, and boil the nuts for 4 min, then run cold water over 'em, and the skins should slip off. Toast for 15 min @350, then chop. I want to make another batch, and my first isn't even gone yet!

One of my favorite biscotti recipes! The dough was very easy to work with, compared to others I've used. Easy recipe to use as a base and change up without worrying about it getting ruined! Delicious.

This is a great recipe, but a doesnt have too much flavor on its' own, i added a little ground cloves and extra cinnamon. Plus, it can be versatile, if you want to switch out the hazelnuts for something else, this is a fantastic basic biscotti recipe (i used shredded and strained zucchini with mini cinnamon chips once - awesome!)

I've always been scared to try making biscotti.  I decided I should use this recipe for my first try.  It was so simple and these turned out delicious!  You can really taste the cinnamon in this.  I'm giving it 4 stars because the recipe was easy to follow and make and the biscotti came out perfect.  The cinnamon hazelnut flavor was okay to me.  After making this, I realized I can use this as a base and change the flavors as I please.

A friend from work brought this biscotti in so I had to try my hand at it. Sooo dissappointed in first batch. Not anywhere in this recipe does it say to CHOP the hazelnuts. I've never baked with hazelnuts before. The whole nuts just fell out and did not add to the flazor. I'll try them again...just because I've tasted the final product from elsewhere.

This is my favorite biscotti recipe.  I have tried about 5 or 6 other recipes for biscotti and the texture of this one is the best, hands down.  I use this recipe as base for all other biscotti recipes by omitting the cinnamon and hazelnut and adding whatever else I want instead.  The recipe is best if you follow it to a T, but I have used margarine instead of butter and today I substituted chia seeds and water for the eggs because I had randomly come across a recipe for using chia seeds and water as an egg substitute and was curious how it would be.  Incidentally, it's ok but it's better to use eggs!  If anyone cares, the substitution is 1 TBS chia seeds + 3 TBS water, according to the internet.  :D

I crushed the hazelnuts in a processor.  Used parchment paper and put the sheet on the middle rack of the oven.  I also used more hazelnut extract instead of vanilla.  They're AWESOME! Seriously.  My parents are very picky and they had 3 each! I'll make this again for sure!

I melted canned vanilla frosting and drizzled over the biscotti.  I also used slivered almonds instead of hazelnuts.  My husband -- who normally doesn't care for biscotti -- thought this was delicious and tasted like cinnamon rolls.  Tasty and great with hot tea or coffee!

I was so surprised at how easy this was to make! As far as baking goes, this may actually be easier than homemade cookies! I made them for a bake sale at work, and they were a huge hit. In addition to the recipe, after the biscotti was complete, I used vanilla almond bark as a topping, and sprinkled more hazelnuts over them. Excellent recipe!

The house smells so good when you're baking these!

Don't cheat yourself by using shortening or margarine.  Use the best quality, unsalted butter.  I perfer using pecans to hazlenuts and putting a strusel topping on the logs.  These make really good gifts and they're nice to have on hand during the holidays when unexpected guests pop in for coffee.

These are awesome.  I've made them a few times and this last time I left out the hazelnuts and threw in some white chocolate chips to the dough instead.  Otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly.

A little soft for my taste but great flavor!  Adding chocolate to the top is MANDATORY, otherwise they are a little plain.  I also added the extra cinnamon that everyone recommends.  Great for gift giving this holiday season!

I originally tried this recipe just because of all the great reviews, but it was even better than I expected!  Used chopped almonds and doubled the cinnamon.

Made recipe exactly as stated and am so impressed with it.  I added walnuts and extra cinnamon and I can't wait to try it with other kinds of nuts.  Maybe dip it in chocolate?.....

Yummmm!  I made these for my daughter's Italian culture project.  I did as others did and changed the butter to 1/2 cup, doubled the cinnimon and used almonds for the nuts. I also dipped half of each cookie in dark chocolate.  So good....I think I will try this same recipe with pistachio, dried cranberry and white chocolate as well. They are delish!!!!

I doubled the cinnamon, vinalla, used 1/2 c. butter - also I measured the flour then sifted it. I toased walnuts in a skillet (Like stir-fry) then used a blender to make them pulverized.  A great recipe.  I melted white chocolate tidbits and some semi chocolate - melted in microwave 3 min at power 70%, put in a ziploc snack size bag-cut off a corner to squeeze the drizzle on.

YUM YUM!  I doubled the cinnamon and used chopped pecans (only because I had them in the house and did not want to go to the store), but other than that, I followed the receipe exactly.  It was my first time making biscotti and it came out FANTASTIC! The house smelled SOOO good too. My only complaint is that it does not make enough. I will be making more tomorrow.  Thanks for a great recipe. :)

Very good biscotti. Brought a plate to work and got rave reviews. Had to adjust cooking time to my oven, but no big deal.  Will use this recipe again and try with other flavorings and nuts. Thanks for submitting.

I would reccomend you use three eggs instead of two. The finished cookie is a bit dry and tends to crumble really easily.

I always though biscotti was a difficult thing to make.  This recipe is so simple and tastes great!  For an added touch, I drizzled white and dark chocolate on the top of the biscotti after it had been toasted and cooled.  This makes a perfect gift, especially wrapped up with a small package of coffee.

The good reviews that had been posted made me try cooking biscotti but,the picture made me try it right away.It was easier than I thought it would be for the first time making biscotti.They do taste wonderful coffe .I should have made it sooner and I would have gotten more good comments on my thanksgiving dinner.That would have been a great dessert but,hopefully christmas.

I doubled the amount of cinnamon but still couldn't quite taste its flavor.  The hazelnuts came out of the loaf while I was cutting it.  Definitely crush them if to make this again.

First time making biscotti and they came out smelling and tasting great. Dough is a bit difficult to work with as it spreads out too much maybe because of the butter. Next time I will use 1/2 cup. The chopped and toasted hazelnuts gave it an excellent flavour. But even after baking the second time they were a bit soggy so had to bake them for an additional 10 mts. Will definitely be making more of these.Thanku for a great recipe Kris !!

For taste, I give this 5 stars because it was really good - the cinnamon and hazelnuts combine nicely.  But for presentation, maybe I'd only give 3 stars - but I think it was mostly my own fault.  I don't think I let it cool completely before I cut the loaves, so a lot of them fell apart.  I'll be making this again, but I'll be sure to let them cool completely.

I think that they are missing something. They were very crumbly. I couldn't move them without one breaking after i cut them. And even after i toasted them it was the same disaster. They tasted good just bad texture.

Delicious recipe.  I made eight batches of this for gift baskets on Christmas.  Everyone said they were yummy...  I added 1/2 cup Hershey's cinnamon chips with the hazelnuts in the food processor.  They added a nice touch, but melt down enough so they're not like candy bits.  Very good!

Yummm! I wanted something new and different with my traditional Christmas cookies this year... stumbled across this one and gave it a shot. So far, three people from the office have asked for a recipe! The cinnamon flavor is just right. I stored them in the fridge with the rest of my cookies and they got a little softer, next batch I will leave at room temp and see if it helps them stay crisp.

This was very good and surprisingly easy. Although, I didn't like the Hazelnut flavor too much. Next time I make this (and there will be a next time) I will use almonds instead. Thank you for the great recipe!!!

These were great! I melted chocolate chips and zig-zaged them over the tops of some. Very fancy looking and totally easy! Next time I will make three loaves instead of two. Some of the middle cuts were just too big!

I always love the biscotti "cookies" but this is the frist time i made them, and with this recipe, is fun and easy. I made a little change to it because the hazalnuts are not my favorite nut, so instead of them I add macadamia nuts and come out wonderful!!! Thanks Kris, I will make it again. Love you!

I was not impressed with this recipe.  The texture of the biscotti is good, but they have too much sugar and aside from that are very bland.

Tasty but didn't turn out the way I thought...too dry and crumbly...maybe I didn't make them right, but I won't be trying this again.

These are the best biscotti we have tasted.  I have been making them on a weekly basis.  They are great to give as "coffee" gifts when visiting for a morning cup of coffee.

These were great.  All the ingredients I had in my pantry and that is a huge plus in my book!  I did substitute almonds for the hazelnut, but I do plan on trying the hazelnut with the next batch.

When these were baking the second time, I had to leave so I justed turned the oven off and propped the door open.  They were really good - not hard at all but very crunchy.  Good flavor!
