These are good, but the arugula has a rather peppery bite. I would suggest if greenery is desired to use spinach. I missed the part about toasting a bun and using it for breadcrumbs...oops... it worked anyways. I cooked the meatballs and sauce in my instant pot for 25 minutes on high pressure with a quick release. Tasty...good for a quick dinner or lunch.

These were very tasty moist meatballs.  Simple to make for a weekday dinner.  I left the arugula/spinach off since some of the family doesn't like greens.

I made this and my girlfriend loved it.  She insisted that i make it again soon, and i had no opportunity to eat any leftovers even though i was looking forward to some.  I did not use arugula as some others suggested, and added spinach to the subs in its place.  I was a little lenient on the amounts of cheese i used and was not exact.  Be careful simmering the sauce, i had to end up covering the pan because the sauce boils easily and splashes out of the pan.  Enjoy guys! I am making this recipe again tonight!!

7/30/19  I actually liked the arugula on this meatball sub, but I couldn’t see then adding chopped basil to the arugula.  I did mix in the red pepper flakes to the marinara, rather than garnishing with it at the end, and then warmed the meatballs in the sauce.  These buns hold together very, very well (no breaking apart as often can happen on a regular hot dog bun or even a hoagie roll).  However, they’re big and thick, and unless toasted pretty well, can be doughy.  Guess I made my meatballs a bit smaller because I ended up with three to a sub,. and that was plenty for me.  Enjoyed!

My family did not care for this at all. The meatballs were okay very mushy and falling apart. They probably could have been browned longer in the oven. I would suggest omitting the milk when making them and adding some of the fresh parsley or basil to the mixture. We did not care for the arugula on the sandwich at all and they ended up taking the arugula off after the first bite. The fresh basil and parsley was very good. Sorry but I will not be making this again. The brat buns were nice but they cannot compare to the old fashion sandwich roll.

I made these and they were delicious. My entire family enjoyed them. Utilizing a bun for bread crumbs was genius. I only made two changes, per other reviews. We left off the arugula and I mixed the red pepper flakes into the sauce so that the flavor would cook in (and my youngest wouldn't know.) It worked and everyone asked for it again!

I’m not gonna lie I was bit skeptical. The directions seemed a bit too simple for my taste. Boy oh boy was I wrong. With the first bite a sensational flavor hit my tongue. My teeth glided through the moist and tender meatball. I will forever be thankful for this recipe!
