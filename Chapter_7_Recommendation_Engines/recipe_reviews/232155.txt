These had the slightest zucchini bread taste. I served them with buttermilk syrup, but they would be great with maple as well. Next time I'll up the cinnamon for more of that zucchini bread flavor. I used whole wheat pastry flour for a more tender texture. This recipe makes 4 belgian waffles (4 cups batter).

I modified the recipe a little to make it appetizing for my kids because I wasn't sure how they would respond to the shredded zucchini. So  I put the liquid ingredients in the Vitamix until they we're well blended. Then poured the wet ingredients into the dry and hand stirred until well blended. I used 1/4 less flour and about a tablespoon more milk to make the mix less thick. The whole family loved it!

I don't have a waffle iron. Has anyone tried these as pancakes? Sounds really yummy and zucchini season is here.

Enjoyable enough.  Will keep these in mind for days when there is simply too much zucchini in the house.  /  Though we love banana & chocolate chip pancakes or waffles, this recipe seemed a bit heavy for our taste...., *****but then again****, we might need to give them a second chance, since my family made these up for me on my teaching night...., and they used baking soda instead of powder - and yes, we made them as pancakes since that was easier for them (yes, we could taste the baking soda a tad more than I'd like, but overall, the flavor was nice in spite of the error).  Will try to post a follow up if we try these again with baking powder.  I am definitely saving this recipe, even though I'm not sure it's a high priority to want to eat these again, but mostly because it's a nice alternative for using up zucchini.

I didn't have whole wheat flour so I used a combo of oats, rice and coconut flour.  1tsp Stevia instead of brown sugar.  Oh, and almond milk.  Which goes to show how versatile this recipe is!

I followed this recipe exactly, and it was great.  My family loved it.  My only  change would be a little more cinnamon.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Ok so I completely forgot to add the oats but these still turned out great. The kids loved them and both asked for seconds. Next time I’ll make with the oats. This is a great, filling, healthy breakfast for the kids without much of added sugar. I’ll make these again!

I used a tablespoon of cinnamon and a 1/4 teaspoon of cloves. I used half whole wheat flour and half bread flour. I also used half and half instead of milk bc I had it in the fridge and it needed to get used up soon. Also was out of brown sugar so used white sugar. Finally, rather than melted butter, used applesauce.
I updated this last time and it didn't save which is too bad bc I made notes about the wheat to white flour ratio that I cannot recall.

Great flavor, but they stuck like crazy to the waffle iron. Add more butter next time, and spray the iron.

We enjoyed them but only gave 4 stars because I had to add 4 teaspoons of cinnamon. I also added diced bananas and chopped nuts. Very good!

Made it exactly as is; other reviews are right, needs a lot more spice. Perfect for my toddler as is though. Will add more spice the next time around (kiddo can handle it). Not as much a fan of it between me and my husband. LOL tasted "good for us" ...more of a comment on us rather than the recipe though.

Disclaimer: I did not follow these to the T, made adjustments to try to lighten them up as I had seen comments about these being too heavy- however, my family loved them. Most importantly , I folded in egg whites that had been beaten to stiff peaks with some sugar.  The waffles still came out quite heavy  and not very crisp, so I went all out and added chocolate chips and cocoa powder to turn them into dessert.

I thought these were great!  I followed the recipe almost exactly (I only had old fashioned oats and I added a tablespoon of 10 grain hot cereal for extra whole grains) and I had no issues with the consistency of the batter.  I have a Mickey Mouse waffle iron and found that 1/2 cup of batter filled it perfectly and one waffle was very filling.  I can't remember how many the batch made.  8 maybe.  Made them the night before, popped them in the toaster the next morning, and threw the leftovers in the freezer for later on.  Delicious!  My husband liked them enough that he took a few with him for lunch.  Will definitely make again.  Maybe trying the applesauce instead of butter trick.

I made this a healthier vegan option, with flax eggs, rice milk, and applesauce instead of butter. I doubt that those small subs would change the consistency a lot, but this was a particularly dry thick batter. I had to add probably an extra cup of milk to the batter, and still they never cooked all the way through. Not sure if I will make again. They tasted great even if not fully cooked, but they seem to need something, probably another baking agent, like soda maybe? Might keep experimenting...

Delicious waffles! I took the advice of some of the past reviewers and pureed the zucchini for a smoother texture. I also used buttermilk instead of milk, and I found the batter to be just right in consistency. I'll definitely be making these again and again!

I used bananas instead of zucchini. And I left out the cinnamon too. So delicious. I warmed up some syrup and mixed in some peanut butter to make a peanut butter syrup. What a treat! I will try the recipe the way it is when I have zucchini to use up. Can't wait! What a great recipe.

Very good. Modified a bit by soaking old fashioned oats in wet ingredients first. Added about another half cup of milk to loosen up the batter. Also used summer squash and apple grated with zucchini for 1 cup of the mixture. Froze the rest in 1 cup bags to be able to quickly mix another batch. Very good and a great use of squash.

For me, I made waffles and they seemed a bit heavy and I would recommend doubling the cinnamon. Still, they were pretty good.

Really enjoyed these, knew they were more like zucchini bread than crispy waffles from the reviews.  I made 1/2 the recipe and it made 2 belgian waffles and one was quite filling.  I added about a Tablespoon each of wheat germ and 7 grain cereal, more cinnamon and used coconut oil instead of butter.  Love that these have oats and whole wheat and a veggie.  I love quick breads, so this is a good substitute in the hot summer and also good portion control.  Thanks for posting and for the comments.

If you like zucchini bread, you should like these waffles.  The batter is thick but that may be because I like to soak the oats in the milk to soften before adding the rest of the ingredients.  With the abundance of zucchini in the garden, this is a good option.

I searched this recipe to use up some garden zucchini and the whole family enjoyed them.  My six year old was less than enthusiastic to try but enjoyed them immensely, announcing that you couldn't even taste the zucchini, which I found to be true.  

They never crisped up very well like regular waffles, but maintained a more bread texture which was fine with us.  I also found the batter to be pretty thick for the waffle iron so after the first batch I ended up adding extra milk to the mixture.

I dumped a lot of cinnamon in as is my style but next time I'm going to take my love of spices to a new level and add cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger.  I do this to all my banana/zucchini/pumpkin breads and it has never failed me.  

We served them with maple syrup warmed with butter and a side of grilled peaches.  It was a delicious and filling breakfast.  

Oh yeah, I also used whole spelt as I try not to use wheat in my baking to avoid possible future food intolerances.

Substituted Applesauce for butter and 1/4 of eggs.  Next time - follow recipe a bit closer - would be nice to bring out zucchini flavor more.  But not sure how to do this.  I rate these highly because they have so many good healthy things - zucchini, oats and whole wheat flower.  I think next time I'll just substituted 1/2 the butter for a little more flavor.  I added twice the cinnamon as suggested, but I'm going to add 4x the cinnamon next time.
