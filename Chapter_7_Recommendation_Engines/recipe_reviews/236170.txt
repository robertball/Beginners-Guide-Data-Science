I love this soup!  Followed reviewers' suggestions and used 1 tsp of each spice and added some lemon (probably should have been lime) and fresh cilantro at the end.  Had a chile pepper I had to use up so added that too.  My substitutions:  Used lite coconut milk and 1 can of black beans and 1 can of white beans (all I had).  I found the flavor outstanding and the beautiful thing is that you just throw all the ingredients in the pot and more or less walk away until it's done.  So simple.  Will add this to my regular repertoire.  Thanks for sharing it.

I love all the individual ingredients in this recipe, but unfortunately, I just didn't care for the final product. I followed the recipe exactly, except for the amount of spices.  I was concerned with the large amount of ginger, cumin and turmeric in such a small batch of soup, so I erred on the side of caution and ended up using about 2tsp of each spice instead of 1 tbsp.  Even though I used less, the spices were very overpowering.  I couldn't taste the ginger, however the cumin dominated everything and the turmeric made the soup bitter.  I would highly recommend starting out with 1tsp of each spice and adding more later if necessary.  Someone else suggested adding lemon juice and I think that would be a great idea.  Thank you for sharing your recipe Becky. I think with a few spice tweaks, it would be quite tasty.

I followed the recipe, but I didn't have everything it called for. I had to boil 1 cup of dried black beans until soft. I didn't have any in a can.  I didn't have the tomatoes, so I added 14 ounces of salsa and 2 ounces of tomatillo sauce.  I diced up 2 medium size carrots, and I also added the juice from 1.5 limes and a sprinkle of dried red chili peppers and sprinkled some chili powder in it.  It turned out great.  This was such an easy soup to make and will be a regular in my kitchen.  If I could give it a higher rating, I would!!!

Goes together really, really quickly and tastes even better the next day. It would probably benefit from some fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lime juice to brighten up the flavors a bit, and some might want to spice it up a bit with whatever hot chiles/powders are on hand (I did not, but my tolerance for heat isn't the greatest). Adding it to my repertoire for sure.

This was a delicious, hearty soup with a surprisingly sweet taste. Replaced one can black beans with garbanzo beans and added a tiny bit of curry powder. Also replaced the turmeric with paprika because that is what I had in the cupboard. Delicious! Added peanuts, lime juice, and sriracha to garnish!!!

I reduced the amount of spice per other reviewers' suggestions and for us it was just the right amount.  The spice flavor was there but it wasn't too spicy.  It was a different soup from what we usually have and a nice change.  It's a bonus that it's very easy to make, too!

I changed two ingredients in the recipe - I used rotel tomatoes (very spicy) and used chicken stock.  The soup was good, but too spicy for me - my husband loved it.  I sauteed the onion, then "bloomed" the spices, then added the garlic before all the other ingredients.

This recipe is quick, healthy, and very easy, but it is a bit bland.  The other reviewer suggested cilantro, lemon and spices, so I think I'm going to make this again but with additional ingredients.

Very tasty and I will make it again with a dash of cayenne or some dried pepper flakesâ€”we like a little fire. The coconut milk really makes this soup,

Such a quick and easy fabulous soup recipe! I will make this again many times but the next time I will double the recipe and add shredded rotisserie chicken. Awesome on a chilly winter night! Spicy but not too hot!

Great recipe. All 3 kids and hubby loved it!  Made some revisions so it would work in a crockpot.  I soaked the black beans overnight.  Began by rinsing them and adding them to the crockpot with 3 cups water and Better than Bouillon and one can of coconut milk.  

While that was in the crockpot I sauteed chopped onions, carrots,  and garlic in a pan with olive oil over medium/ low heat. As cooking, I added 1/2 tsp turmeric and 1-2  tsp cumin, salt, and pepper.  But I was careful not too much salt as Better than Bouillon is salty. After the onions were transparent I added it to the crockpot and left the soup to continue to cook on 4 hours high. 

Served it with white rice. Garnish with sour cream and shredded cheese for my dairy eating children and hubby.  Very yummy and my children don't like to eat beans so a happy surprise they are won over :)

This was really good for a quick and easy soup to make. I followed others and used a bit less spice. My little ones (4 and 3) wouldn't try it, but everyone else enjoyed it. I will keep this one around for quick dinners in the winter.

Maybe it's the excessive amount of spices, maybe I just don't like turmeric. I don't know.
