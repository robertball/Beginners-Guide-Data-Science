The first time I tried this salad, I followed the recipe exactly and it was way too salty for us.  Made it again yesterday and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  MUCH BETTER!  This one's a keeper -- reminds us of the salad at that Italian restaurant.

At first this recipe has a strange feel in the mouth, because of the avocado melting into the oil, but the next day the salad tasted best and every one loved it and ate big servings

Neither my husband or I really liked this dressing too much.  Other than that, it is a pretty mainstream salad, so it just wasn't that great.

Not as good as I had hoped.  Next time I would add more tomatoes and cut back on the olives.

This is a wonderful salad and I've used just the dressing for other salad varieties as well.  I've passed on the recipe many times!

I thought the flavor of the dressing would be
better if the juice of 1/2 lemon and the parm. was
freash grated.

This was very good. I used fresh herbs (with a little extra basil), and the flavor was wonderful. Instead of garlic salt, I used a clove of garlic and 1/4 tsp sea salt, which was just the right mix. I didn't have Parmesan, but the salad didn't seem to be lacking without it. I'll definitely keep this one--it's great for when you want a simple green salad with a twist. UPDATE: This has become one of my favorite green salads. It's so easy to put together, and it complements almost any main course. I'm increasing my original rating from 4 to 5.

Although not a big fan of mixed greens, I still have to give this 5 stars.  Salad was very tasty and it would not have been the same with romaine.  I did take advice and used half garlic salt and half garlic powder.

This salad was just excellent. Didn't expect it to be so flavorful but just loved it without the avocado (dislike). And yes, substituted sliced pickles for pepporoncini as had none on hand. THanks for the recipe.

I made this salad for a dinner party and it was really tasty. I prepared the salad & dressing before hand & added in some red onions & croutons. In my rush to get everything on the table I forgot to cut & add in the avocado. The dressing was good but was basically just clumps of dried herbs and too salty with garlic salt. Fresh garlic or garlic powder with another quarter cup of olive oil & more vinegar would be recommended if making this again. Will definitely make again with the avocado. It reminded me of the salad at a Italian restaurant chain.

I followed the directions exactly and I didn't like this dish. It is eatable, but way too soggy. I think that I  added way too much vinegar because I wanted to up the flavor. In general I don't know why, but I have a hard time making good salads. I just can't get the proper dressing/salad balance.

Great spring recipe and very easy to prepare. Full of flavor and the avocado and parmesan add a refreshing touch.
