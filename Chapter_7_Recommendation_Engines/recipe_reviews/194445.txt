I don't know if I'd refer to this recipe as basic, because that somehow implies average and this recipe isn't average, bland or boring.  It's fabulous! This was everything guacamole should be: smooth and creamy with just the right amount of flavor.  Nothing overpowering, nothing artificial, no jarred salas or other oddities to make it some sort of "creation" - it was authentic Mexican guacamole that went great with warm tortilla chips.

This is thee exact same recipe I was taught to make, however never we never measured the ingredients.  Just to let u in on a little secret,   if u put the pit of the avacado back into the prepared dip & press plastic wrap softlyly to the top, the pits keep it green longer.

This is one of the best, basic, dependably good guacamole recipes I've seen. There is no right or wrong in how it's tweaked to its final outcome, but this is great on its own or a wonderful "canvas" to build upon to individual tastes or preferences.  I added less cilantro (we're coming around because until recently I always substituted Italian parsley!), a clove of minced garlic and a little better than a 1/4 tsp. cumin.  I did use lime juice, even though I generally use lemon only because that's what I always have on hand.  Maybe it's because we're just more used to it, but hubs and I both decided we actually prefer the lemon over the lime - again, just a matter of personal preference.  You can't go wrong with this classic, reliable version of guacamole!

Yup, the name says it all, this is a good basic recipe.  After trying it I decided to increase the onions and jalapenos and added some garlic. It is better after sitting for a while, but don't expect it to hold until the next day, it gets gross (same with all guacamole).

This guacamole was very taste. I like to cut the avocado first and mix with the lime very well(I used 1 whole lime juice), this way it avoids the avocado to turn dark so soon. I also added 4 Tbsp of onion and 1/2 bunch of fresh cilantro. Thanks for the recipe!

I like to make this with red onion rather than yellow, but aside from that, this is my standard guacamole recipe and I find it always works out really well.

This is a perfect base recipe for guacamole.  I added more onion and tomato to mine because that's how I like it.  I also leave out the spicy peppers as I am not a fan, and it still tastes great!  Definitely use coarse/kosher salt versus table salt.

This is good! I used the green part of a green onion because I don't care for raw yellow and doubled the recipe. Thanks!

I never knew I loved guacamole so much untill I made this recipe.  The simple ingredients is what makes this so delicious.  I think the coarse salt is a key ingredient as it adds great flavor.  I have made it with and without tomatoes.  Wonderful either way.  A friend of mine let me in on a little secret...put the avacado seed in the middle of the guac to keep it from turning brown.  It really does work.

Perfect guacamole recipe!  I didn't measure - I just added ingredients to taste.  I did add some cracked pepper and a bit of salt, but perfect as is.  Thanks!

I did not use cilantro (can't stand it).  Also doubled (or more) tomato and onion (used red onion).  Sometimes I add finely chopped regular peppers too.

About keeping quac for a couple of hours or even overnight....I poo-poo'd the idea of pressing saran wrap on top for years.  Tried it over the holidays and by pressing it down very snugly so that there is virtually no air touching any part of the surface of your quacamole; mine did keep very nicely overnight.

There is a product on the market made by Ball, named "Fruit-Fresh", produce protector.  You just stir in 2tsp to every cup of dip.  Works great!

I've been making this simple guacamole (minus the chilies although I do add 1 garlic clove or some garlic powder to taste) for over 10 years.  I get asked to make it all the time!  People who don't typically like guacamole even like it.  I don't mash the avacado though, makes for a different texture than you usually see.  I half the avacado, score it, then scoop it out.  As you stir the ingredients together it'll mash a little.  It's simple, fresh, and incredibly easy!

This is a great basic recipe to build from. I use all ingredients "to taste", but also add minced garlic, sweet banana pepper & a splash of balsamic vinegar. If I need more heat, then I will add some red pepper flakes. Voila!

Excellent.....not mostly sour cream like many guac recipies are. I tossed in extra lime  (squeezed half a lime into it which is probably closer to a TB of lime juice) and onion (more like 2TB) for my tastes.

Other than increasing the amount of tomato, onion, and jalapeno to approx. twice the amount listed, it's a great go-to recipe anytime  we're in the mood for guac, which is pretty often!

Tastes great - definitely is a basic guac recipe.  Apparently my avacado's weren't ripe enough because they didn't mash well.  :(  Still tastes good though!

Perfect recipe IF you modify ingredients just a little. I use extra tomato. Also I use both green chilies and jalapenos, and it was easy to overdue it with the jalapenos -from a jar- (used more than a couple teaspoons).

Quite good!  I did cut the amount of cilantro in half since I only wanted a whisper of this herb in the dish; too much and it's spoiled for my taste.

This is an excellent recipe. I only made one small addition-I add in a grated clove or two of garlic and it just gives it that something extra. I am now a bit of a guacamole snob-nothing compares to this recipe!

Great recipe! The fresh cilantro is key. I would also add a couple cloves of garlic, a splash of olive oil, and sometimes a half of a diced yellow bell pepper.

I have made this recipe several times and everyone loves it.  My teenage daughters and their friends devour it.  I do leave out the cilantro since none of my family cares for it.  I also have used white onions with no problems.

Simple and quick to make. I left out the chilies and put just a dash of black pepper. Any kind of firm tomatoes will work and if lime isn´t in the fridge, use lemon juice instead. I love flexible recipes.

Very good-only thing I added was a couple of cloves of minced garlic. Topped our beef strips soft tacos with it.
