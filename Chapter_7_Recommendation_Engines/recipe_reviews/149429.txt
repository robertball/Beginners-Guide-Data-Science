I was looking for a recipe for classic ganache to top a chocolate cheesecake with and came across this recipe. Since sweetened sour cream is a classic plain cheescake topping I gave this one a try for my chocolate cheesecake. It was the PERFECT compliment to the rich cheesecake. Dense but not too heavy and sweet but refreshing in compliment to the intense chocolate of the cheesecake. EXCELLENT - thanks for a great recipe!

Not at all what I had hoped for.  The sour cream totally overpowerd the chocolate to the point that you almost couldn't taste it.  I didn't even use this, I was so disappointed.

I turned to this recipe when I needed to make a ganache & didn't have any cream.  It does have a "sour cream", less sweet taste to it.  But it's actually pretty nice!  and if you pair it with a sweet chocolate cake, you're good to go!  This pipes well.  If you want it runny again, just chuck it into the microwave for about 20 seconds.  Thanks!!

I am so pleased with how this turned out!  I had an entire container of sour cream that was about to reach its expiration date and I decided this ganache would make a great topping for gingerbread.  I substituted white chocolate chips for the regular chocolate.  It tastes just like the topping found on carrot cake.  Delicious!

I agree with a previous reviewer that the sour cream is overwhelming. I added sugar to it and that improved it, but it was still too sour.

Awesome!!!!!! I had no issues whatsoever with the sour cream overpowering the chocolate. It must be a matter of personal taste. I found this ganache great tasting and super easy to make, with things you are more likely to have in your pantry/fridge. Thank you for posting such a great recipe!

I made this because I had made it before years ago to put on cheesecake. So lovely! It has a shine to it that is so pretty. I think you should add the sour cream in and taste as you go so that you do not get the sour taste you do not like. That is different for everyone so it is a good excuse to sample as you are adding. Yum! Anyway, I loved this on Black Magic Cake from this site. I also added some peppermint extract to make a mint chocolate cake. Super YUM! Here's to death by chocolate!

We really like the slightly sour flavor the sour cream gives.  I sometimes add a little Triple-Sec or other fruity liquoer.

Well, it doesnt taste like ganache.  The sour cream is quite potent.  But I think this tastes pretty good.  It seems to enhance the chocolate flavor.  This was not very sweet so I would recommend using milk chocolate if you like it sweet.   I think it might help with the sour cream flavor too. I also used fat free sour cream. It hardened up just fine.  Its a recipe in its own league but tastes good.

Texture was good, but the tanginess from the sour cream was too overwhelming.  A little disappointing, I was excited to see a recipe that had a alternative to heavy cream, which I never have on hand, to something that is part of my basic pantry list.

Jan. 2016 (Football party in Downs): halved recipe... mixed 1/2 c. Sour cream, 1/4 c. Heavy cream, 1 Tbs powedered sugar - heat in microwave til hot; add 1 c. Semi sweet chips and 1 tsp vanilla - stir til smooth, pour over cooled brownies.
Oct. 2016 (NASCAR party in Downs): I heated the sour cream in the microwave and then stirred the chips in until melted; then stirred in vanilla. Next time I'll add some sugar to sweeten or use half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate chips.

This is a great recipe when you have no heavy whipping cream on hand! I also used white chocolate chips and it tasted wonderful. I put it on top of a chocolate bunt cake.

5 stars as a chocolate cheesecake topping.  I agree that the sour cream could be tasted, but it was a great compliment to the cheesecake!  It was very easy to make in the microwave.  I just stirred every 10 seconds until it was perfectly smooth. So easy!

I made this but had to make some changes to the recipe because the flavor was odd. I followed the instructions exactly and was pleased with the texture, which was beautiful, but the flavor was sour and bitter with an aftertaste of chocolate. I added one more teaspoon of vanilla and about a tablespoon of honey which definitely helped. If I make it again I will experiment with reducing the sour cream or using milk instead of semi sweet chips.

Only made half the recipe and it easily covered 2 dozen cupcakes. I melted the chocolate in the microwave and used the full teaspoon of vanilla so it was easier to spread.

OH. MY. GOSH.  Tangy and chocolatey is a sensation!  And no butter. I didn't bother getting out the mixer or messing up a bowl.  Melt chocolate in a pot, add SC and vanilla and whisked.  The recipe makes A LOT. Actually, too much.  I halved the recipe and it was still too much for 1 bundt.  Next time, I'll try cutting down to 1/3.

I made this to add onto the top of my chocolate chip banana bread. It was amazing. I did add a little sweet cream butter to the chocolate chips while melting them. Then after I mixed in the sour cream I added a small pinch of powdered sugar and cocoa powder. Turned out SO delicious!

I thought this was very good! I used Nestle vanilla chips to go with a chocolate fudge cake mix and about 1- 1/2 Tblsp of Dekuyper buttershots liqueur while melting the chips. Could also just mix the liqueur with the sour cream before mixing all together. Could not taste the sour cream flavor at all. I cored out the middle of the cupcakes and poured the Ganache inside, then let them sit in the fridge overnight.  I will make these again!

I Have made this many times and always turns out great for me I like the less sweet flavor the sour cream gives this. I didn't change anything. I have used semi sweet and milk chocolate chips (not together two different batches) both come out great.

Love this ganache.   Have used it for years.   I hate buttercream frostings but love this ganache.  It is not a favorite of children or adults who like sweet icings/frostings.    As it sits, it darkens and gets shiny.   Simple ganache with ingredients easily found in your kitchen.

The recipe is soooooooo easy and you don't need anything out of the ordinary. The sour cream gives it a little tang~ I get compliments every time I make it!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out really well.  It is not as sweet as a normal ganache, but still really tasty.
