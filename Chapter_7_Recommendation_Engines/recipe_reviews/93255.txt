One word - AMAZING! I was a little hesitant to add all the tequila - but it turned out to be delicious. I added a little more peach than the recipe stated, 2 roma tomatoes, and cut the olive oil in half. Very spicy!

This is a good starting point for peach salsa.   First time I made it as written and it was ok.

Based on my personal preferences here are some changes I made for the second time I made it, which then came out perfect.  

I added tomatoes, red and green bell peppers and used peach schnapps instead of the tequila.  Also, I don't like "crunchy" fruits or veggies in my salsa so I sauteed my onions and peppers and left out the firm peach, just used canned peaches (I also use some of the syrup from the peaches to sweeten the salsa).  Good stuff! 

You can use any "leftover" salsa to cook up some chicken and rice with for a fabulous meal.

I made this for a guy who doesn't like peaches... so i left out the peaches and used tomatoes. Don't know how helpful this review will be without the key "twist" ingredient, but here goes: he loved it! I used quartered cherry tomatoes, which are naturally sweeter than others, and one medium-sized green tomato, which did help add a bit of crispness. The end result was fresh, delicious, and had a great kick. Oh, and I also used 1 habanero 1 jalapeno. Really excellent.

Very good! I doubled the peaches (used only canned) and reduced the tequila & habanero, but it was not too spicy. Could use full amounts next time.

Had 4 people try and it nobody liked it.  We make a lot of salsa's and found this one kind of bland. Tequila didn't help it at all and we love our tequila.
