I'm so happy to have come across this recipe.  My husband was always asking me to make Sukiyaki for him, but I had no idea how to make it.  This Sukiyaki recipe turned out to be a big hit with my husband and the kids.  The only change I made was substituting snow peas for celery.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I'd make this again but I thought the sugar was a bit much. I think next time I'd cut the sugar in half or not use any at all

If you don't have the means to make this in the traditional manner, this is good.  In Japan there is a pot of boiling broth in the center of the table.  Meat and veg are brought out on a huge platter.  Meat or veg is taken from the platter with hashi (chopsticks) piece by piece and cooked in the broth until done.  It is most always served with white rice.  Also, a bowl of beaten raw or coddled egg is served to dip the meat in as well as a kind of teryiyaki  broth.  I highly recommend the egg.  It is delicious this way.  You can buy these cookers online for use at your table since most of us don't have the built in kind.

We have a favorite restaurant that serves beef sukiyaki and this came pretty close!!  It was excellent, I would just make a couple of minor changes next time.  I thought it was very tofu heavy and light on meat so I would cut tofu in half and double up on the steak.  I also omitted the celery just because I don't love it cooked.  I cooked it in my pressure cooker and it turned out perfect! Great recipe!

I couldn't find the right noodles a the grocery store (need to go to an Asian market) and used udon instead.  Was very good, but I think the right noodles would make it better.

This recipe was amazing! I had to do a few substitutions with mirin and dashi stock with beef stock and pinot grigio.  It was a little tough to juggle the different tasks, but I am a beginning cook.

I loved this recipe and will definitely make this again.  I added more mushrooms and substituted lite tamari for the soy sauce.  The next time I make this I am going to try it with a little less sugar.

Amazing! We subbed out the dashi for vegetarian broth to make half of it vegetarian, and I just added in beef afterwards. After reading the reviews on the sugar we only put in half in and it tasted perfect (but I have a bit of a sweet-tooth and like sweet udon noodles, it might be worth putting in less if you feel otherwise as the mirin is quite sweet). We also doubled the noodles, and I think next time I might triple them as there was still plenty of broth to go around. We're also thinking about doubling the vegetarian broth in proportion to the other ingredients in the broth as it was quite strong (and mirin isn't always the cheapest!)

I think it's better without sugar. It reminds me of when my friend made it for me. I asked her advice, since she's Japanese and knows how to make it well. She was pleased with the pictures I sent.
