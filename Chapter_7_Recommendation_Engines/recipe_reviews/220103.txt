I had my doubts while assembling the cake (which I did the day before) but I shouldn't have worried, the cake was delicious.  I have already had requests for another one!  Didn't change anything.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I made a strawberry cake once before and it did not turn out. So when my youngest son asked for a strawberry cake I was a bit nervous. This recipe was great! Everyone loved it and told me to hold onto the recipe. Typically the first time I make a recipe I leave it exactly as is, however I did make a few adjustments to this one. I didn't use a mix, I just mixed up a yellow cake from scratch and I baked it in a 9x13 cake pan. I didn't want to buy a whole jar of strawberry jam since I had strawberries in the freezer I just blended them up and cooked them down a bit so they had a thicker consistency. Now I am really glad I did that because those strawberries only had a little sugar in them and I think strawberry preserves would have made this cake too sweet. Lastly since my son just turned three I thought he would like strawberry frosting more than cream cheese frosting. I still mixed it with the cool whip, which I think I will do for every frosting from now on. I know it sounds like a lot of changes, but most of them are pretty irrelavent, I just thought I would list them in case it changes something for someone else. Definitely a great recipe!

This was pretty good, though it is quite sweet. Reminds me of strawberry ice cream but in cake form. Not sure if it really needs the condensed milk over it, I think just the strawberries and frosting would be enough, and the removal of the condensed milk will help cut the sweetness. Overall, pretty tasty cake that we all enjoyed.
