Made just as the recipe stated. Also took the suggestion of another reveiwer and made a vanilla-flavored syrup and our lattes tasted just like the 'bucks version! So happy I know how to make these at home now. Oh, for anyone who doesn't know how to make the syrup, I just put some regular sugar in a bowl and fill it with enough water just to cover the sugar (about 4 tablespoons of sugar). Put it in the microwave for about a minute or until the sugar disolves, then add a little vanilla extract. Delicious!

I don't have an espresso machine. I used instant coffee, and I warmed the milk up on the stove. I made a simple syrup and added a bit of vanilla to it. I also added some white chocolate, and marshmallows. I let them dissolve into the coffee. It's yummy! I'll make it again on another cold, and rainy day.

Longing for a peppermint mocha latte with the closest Starbucks an hour away I found this recipe and customized it for my current craving.  I used very strong coffee since I don't have an espresso machine and added a drop of peppermint extract and three tsp of cocoa powder to my simple syrup.  Perfect!

Awesome recipe. I like to use Coffeemate Warm Cinnamon Sugar Cookie Creamer to replace 1/4 cup of the milk. It gives it a deliciously sweet taste and tastes like an expensive coffeehouse drink!

Great basic recipe. I made mine into a caramel macchiato with caramel coffee syrup, whipped cream, and caramel drizzled on across the top. I put a fresh raspberry on top and it dropped to the bottom of my cup and the flavors released into the drink so it was a creamy caramel raspberry flavor.

Love this recipe, but makes way too much for me.  I adjust everything down by 1/4 or so.  I've tried with both the homemade vanilla syrup and store-bought.  Both are just as good as expensive coffee houses.

I thought this was really good the way it is, but for mornings, I usually like a double shot ... I need it!

I used my Nespresso milk frother. I love it, it's just a bit expensive. I use it all of the time though. The steamed milk works well with any kind of coffee, brewed, instant, flavored, or espresso. I don't usually add flavoring. If I did though, there is no way I would add 2 Tblsp a cup. Although, that is close to what the coffee houses use. I typically do one small spoon, if I use any of it. Don't care for sweet coffees.

I used equal parts of strong coffee and milk since I don't have an espresso maker. I heated the milk and used a whisk to make it frothy (which I learned from this site). For the syrup, I used a homemade peppermint syrup from this site. Two tablespoons is a bit too sweet for me, but otherwise this was fine.

I used Torani Salted Chocolate Caramel Syrup which I placed at the bottom of my cup. I heated soy milk with a packet of Trivia and frothed it with an immersion blender. I then poured it over the syrup and placed the cup in my Ninja Coffee Bar, Cup size, Specialty brew and ended up with a beautifully layered latte. I loved it!

I frothed my warm milk, added a packet of Starbucks Via Italian Roast coffee, added Madagascar Vanilla, and frothed some more. Makes a beautiful foam on top. Then I topped it off with some cinnamon. Perfect home latte without the espresso machine.
