My one year old daughter and I really liked this recipe.  My husband however did not care for the taste of the balsamic vinegar.  I have made it twice now and will keep this super quick sauce recipe.  I did decrease the amount of basil called for using only about half of the 1/2 cup.  I also made the mistake of using crushed tomatoes the first time.  The pieces were too small.  The second time was much better with the whole tomatoes.

Used angel hair, fresh tomato, and a little less basil because that is what I had on hand.  Absolutely delicious.

Very nice italian flavored dinner.  I added some tomato paste because I had a little left over from another recipe.

I can't say enough about this recipe!  It sounded great and was quite excited to try it.  Then I made it and took a bite.

This was ok. We didn't have or use any marjoram and my fiance thinks that if we would of had that then it would have been better. It seemed a little bland to me. If we make it again, we'll experiment with other spices.

My family loved this recipe.  I used stewed tomatoes because it was what I had and added extra garlic.  Will make again.

This needed a little butter, or else a little more oil with the garlic; it was very dry. There are similar and better recipes to be found 'round here.

This was EASY and FAST!  I did modify the recipe slightly.  I did not have any marjoram and I thought the sauce was fine without it.  I did add oregano, canned mushrooms and some minced onions for a fast onion flavor.  I already had spaghetti noodles left over in the fridge.  For the water I heated 1/2 cup of tap water in the microwave and just threw in my leftover noodles to the sauce, which really speeded up the process.  My hubby did not want cheese on his so I simply used the Grated 100% Kraft Parmesan in the shaker container on my portion.  Thank you for a quick and simple recipe!

The amount of basil suggested is somewhat questionable.  Unless your a big basil fan I would knock off a couple tablespoons or three from this recilpe.  Other than that it is an enjoyable and easy recipe to prepare.

This is the best spaghetti I've eaten. Has a tangy flavor to it. You don't even notice there is no meat but you can add the frozen Italian meatballs and it's great and ground beef too! It's just great either way and has that homemade flavor!

It was very good. Used angel hair instead and added two cans of anchovies to the garlic while cooking it.

Looks like this was edited for content.  I did not like this recipe whatsoever.  I had to doctor the sauce up a bit to give it some flavor.

Thank goodness it didn't taste like it smelled.  It needed way more garlic and less vinegar.

it was easy enough and it was pretty quick... but the taste was awful.  i think it was the majoram but whatever it was i suppose that it is an acquired taste because i ended up throwing the majority of it away.

This recipe was fairly easy to make, but to be honest, it was pretty awful to taste.  I actually rinsed my spaghetti off to put it into another meal.  WAY too many dried herbs... perhaps it could be better when prepared with fresh!
