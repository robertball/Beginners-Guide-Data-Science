To begin, I read all of the reviews before making.  I doubled the recipe, and as with others, I used only 2 eggs instead of 3, (4 total for doubled) and I added a mashed banana, ( 2 for doubled recipe) and instead of 3 Tbsp. honey that the recipe called for, I added 2 Tbsp. honey and 2 Tbsp. Agave Nectar Light (doubled recipe).  I also added some extra blueberries.  This was the most interesting muffin I have ever made.  I do a lot of muffin experimenting.  This was a very light and moist muffin.  It was not too salty or eggy as some said.  Because I doubled the recipe, it still only made 12 muffins, and they weren't the normal big, puffy muffins that I normally make.  However, they were the most interesting and tasty muffins ever, and b/c it has coconut flour as a base, which is a protein, since it comes from the coconut meat, it was amazingly filling.  It is definitely worth trying...and it's healthy!!

I gave these muffins a 4 star only because I altered the recipe a little and it only yielded 6 full sized cupcakes. I used 2 eggs instead of 3 and I am not a fan of salt so I cut it down to 1/8 tsp. Himalayan salt. I was surprised how good they were. Other reviewers have stated that they didn't find these muffins sweet enough.I thought they were plenty sweet! Everyone's pallet is different, if you are not used to eating sweets on a regular basis, you will love these muffins.  I will definitely make these again. In fact, I am going to use this recipe as a base for all my gluten free muffins.

The #1 benefit of Allrecipes to read all of the reviews before baking.  After reading, I substituted:  a "flax egg" (1 TBL ground flax seed plus 3 TBL water) to avoid an eggy flavor;  unsalted ghee instead of butter to reduce salty flavor and be healthier; ran out of regular honey so used spreadable cinnamon honey and dropped the cinnamon spice; sprayed muffin pan with coconut oil cooking spay - let muffins cool for 30 min or so and they came out of pan in one piece.  Fresh blueberries used.  Super moist and delicious.

I HATE coconut, but made these to try. They turned out pretty well, and I couldn't taste he coconut! Though, they stick super bad to anything they are in, so make sure and use some kind of pan spray (even in the papers). I doubled the recipe, using only 4 eggs instead of 6, replaced butter with applesauce and used half almond flour, half coconut flour. I also used quite a bit more honey than what was listed because honey tends to lose sweetness once baked. They could be sweeter, but overall they are pretty tasty the way I made them.

Well I made quite a few adjustments.
Instead of honey I used a 1/4 cup stevia baking blend. Instead of butter for moisture I used a 1/4 cup of shredded zuchini. I did a 1/4 cup blueberries. And I did 4 egg whites instead of 3 full eggs. I don’t think I’m forgetting any of the adjustments I made but when i calculated it all out it came out to around 50 calories per muffin and when I made the batch it made 5 muffins. :) hope that helps. They were delicious, tasted just like cake

I did not care for this recipe, although the recipe was easy enough. It was a bit too eggy and salty for my taste.

Came out super eggy  unfortunately. Almost tasted like an omelette. I suppose more vanilla could be added to cancel out the egg flavour?

I thought for sure it was a typo, only a quarter of a cup of coconut flour?  And I thought it'd be weirdly eggy.  But I'm really impressed with how they turned out!

I made it based on review guidelines of adding a banana and cutting back the honey. My taste review of that recipe is that it was eggy like the other reviews said and not sweet or salty enough. The texture was good though so I would recommend leaving the honey as the recipe says or adding a little brown sugar, adding a bit more salt, and definitely 1.5-2x the blueberries. I think if I do those steps next time they could be quite good. As is, they were not bad with some butter and honey. ??

This recipe is horrendous. After reading the reviews, I doubled everything except for the eggs. There was only enough “batter” for eight muffins. It wasn’t really even batter - it resembled short bread dough. The muffins came out more like tiny scones. Would not make this again.

This is a very light, very tasty recipe. It is not your common muffin texture, but still very good. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and only added 4 eggs for a double recipe. It was just right. 2 more eggs would have altered the texture too much. Be sure to let the ingredients sit for a few minutes so the coconut flour soaks in the wet ingredients. 
What modifications would you make to use this recipe for pancakes?

Moist and yummy! Read through the other reviews. I went with 4 eggs too on a double batch and skipped the salt due to using salted butter. They tasted wonderful!

This is not the best blueberry muffin I have ever had, but it is ok. The blueberry flavor is coming through and not blotted out by the large amount of honey (which is a little bit surprising). However, the bake time could be extended a little bit, by maybe a few minutes.

I give it 4 stars because it's a really good place to start from (I had no idea what to do with all the coconut flour I had) but I made a lot of tweaks. Only added 2 eggs, included a mashed banana, split the honey between equal parts brown sugar, honey & maple syrup (possibly too sweet still, may cut down next time) and substituted dried dates for the blueberries! Pretty much a different recipe but it tasted awesome! Going to make it again for sure!

Tastes good!!! It was very moist and delicious! I put half the honey and was still sweet enough. Also the muffins were stuck to the pan so maybe next time I will put in the liners. I did put mashed bananas also and it came out good! Will make again!

I used frozen blueberries and think it ruined them. They did not rise properly, although they were tasty. Use fresh blueberries!!
