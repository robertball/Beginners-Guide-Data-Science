I used 5 strips of turkey bacon, extra garlic from a jar, 1/2 cup buckwheat and 1 1/2 cups very low sodium organic chicken broth. I left out the parsley and shallots, but added plenty of green onions. The cooking time was still perfect and my husband loved this! Thanks for the new buckwheat recipe (there are not too many off them around)!

I love buckwheat but I wasn't impressed with this recipe. I would recommend adding onion (separately cooked till golden) in the end, because otherwise it becomes mushy.

This recipe rocks!! We are new to the gluten-free thing and this dish was the perfect intro. I had to double the recipe to feed my two pre-teen boys

I accidentally used bulgur instead of buckwheat, but it still tasted delicious. This recipe doesn't make much -- I ate the whole thing for lunch (which is good for me because I'm the only one in the house who'll eat it). I didn't add salt because the bacon and chicken stock had plenty, and I used way more parsley for personal preference. Will definitely make again.

The bacon is so good!  Doesn't make a whole lot by our American standards, but this could be a main dish for 2 people.  Careful about wolfing this down too fast... the buckwheat is SOOOO filling, you could get a tummy ache!   Thanks for the great recipe!

I had this last night with dinner and loved it!  I think with a few more veggies this could be a main dish rather than a side, but would be more like 1 serving than 2.  I used 4 pieces of turkey bacon, and added about a cup of diced baby carrots to the onions while I caramelized them a bit.  I had to use onion rather than shallots, since that's what I had, then I totally forgot to add either parsley or pepper at the end and this was still delicious.  My husband doesn't like the earthy/strong flavor of buckwheat, but I thought it was great, and it didn't spike my blood sugar levels like a lot of "grainy" things can.  (Yes, I know this is a seed...)  I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

I doubled the bacon (four strips) but even then I was not at ALL convinced I would like this, however I decided to give it a try and man was it delicious! The hubby and I both really enjoyed it. It had a nutty, meaty, very savory flavor and a nice texture. This recipe didn't make much, we each had a very modest helping so next time I plan to double the recipe but it was totally delicious. Well done!

It's hard to find good recipes for buckwheat groats.  My husband loved it, but I thought it was just fine.  The bacon flavor was more subtle than I had expected.  I would double the recipe next time to have some for leftovers.  Really just serves two people, as noted.
