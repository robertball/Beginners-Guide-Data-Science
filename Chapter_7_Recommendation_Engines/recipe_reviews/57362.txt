These were great!  I did not use bacon either.  Yes if you don't like goat cheese, then don't make this recipe.  I have never had goat cheese before and it is very smooth and creamy. I also have never had dates.  I can't believe how good these were, everyone raved about them and asked for the recipe.  I will make these for a Christmas appetizer.Very easy! yumyumyum

These are delicious!  Super easy to assemble and great finger food for parties.  I used thick cut bacon so I cut the slices in thirds and it was perfect.  Definitely make as directed to get desired result. Don't skip balsamic reduction or bacon. These are both big elements of the recipe and these flavors blend in an amazing way. Leave one out and you'll get something completely different.  I recommend moving dates to a paper towel after cooking to blot briefly before plating and drizzling with balsamic.

Good. They were sweet. I'll have to get some saltier bacon. I didn't use the balsamic vinegar and sugar. I just couldn't imagine adding anymore sweetness to the mix. Would definitely make again! Thanks. Broiled 3 minutes each side.

I modified this recipe a bit -but it's become the appetizer I make when I want to "wow" people. I'm not a big fan of goat cheese, so I mix a good gorgonzola with cream cheese, and add chopped pecans to that mix. It makes assembly go a bit faster. I use toothpicks to hold each together and make serving easier. This is such a hit every time and I always have an empty dish. Do NOT skip the balsamic reduction.

These were wonderful!  I used cream cheese instead of goat cheese though and skipped the pecans.  Blue cheese would be a great mix as well. Enjoy!

These were delicious and pretty easy to make, however chances are you're making them for a party or a get together, which is generally time sensitive. The temperature & time for baking is so far off, it screwed up my plans. The first time I tried baking as instructed, and as someone previously reported it probably took 40 to 45 minutes for the bacon to get crispy. The second time I did them for about 20 minutes and then stuck them under the broiler on low and flip them so it was five minutes on each side on a low broiler. The next time I make these I am just going to do the low broil or from the start and keep an eye on them

Beware, these are addictive and I will definitely make them again. I followed the recipe as written, using small Deglet Noor dates and 1/3 slice of bacon for each wrap. I assembled triple the recipe 24-hours prior to serving and made the sauce as they baked. The simple sauce adds a sophisticated, gourmet touch.

Always a hit.  Have made with goat cheese, gorganzola or blue cheese - all are good.  Have made with and without the pecan.  Good both ways though I prefer with the nut.  It provides a bit of texture in an otherwise soft bite.  Mine take at least 40 minutes to crisp up the bacon thus the 4 stars.  I poke them with a toothpick after they come out of the oven but it isn't necessary, just neater for finger food.  Part of my go-to rotation.

I made these in the air fryer and they turned out even better than the oven!   So very easy and very sweet.

These were very good! The bacon didn't crisp up the way I would like even after keeping in the oven longer. I would try partially cooking the bacon in a frying pan, and when cool, then wrap around the date and just keep an eye on it in the oven. The goat cheese I used was the honey type. I also skipped the sauce.

I made this recipe mixing goat and cream cheese, adding Tapatio, chili powder, cayenne pepper, and black pepper. Requires about 10 minutes longer than recipe states and I turned them over midway through. They were an absolute hit at the Super Bowl party we attended. The balsamic glaze is a nice touch, though it wasn’t as thick as I expected, more on the runny side. It’s a great recipe and I liked the tweets I made.

I made these for my Bunco group and they loved them, I didn't have any left overs! I didn't use the pecan, but I'm sure that the recipe would be great with that addition. I lined my cookie sheet with parchment paper, that make clean up much easier. I will definitely be making these again.

These were AMAZING!  I used turkey bacon and skipping the balsamic glaze completely and they were a huge hit at my Oscar party.  They were best right out of the oven when the goat cheese was creamy.  My guests loved them and not one was left.  Will make this again FOR SURE!
