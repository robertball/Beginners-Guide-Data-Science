I have made this several times but never reviewed. This is SO good! The one and only thing that I change is that I add minced garlic to the beef when cooking it. I also omit the onions (picky kids) but add onion powder. As for the meat being tough, since I have cooked this many times, I have also ended up with tough meat. I found the answer. I saw on several cooking shows that if you cut against the grain of the meat (in the opposite direction)..it makes it almost fall apart. I let mine simmer for 30 mins.  This is one of our favorites and even my picky non vegetable eaters love this meal!!

I don't know if I should really be rating this as I made major changes, but I kept the same basic idea and it was delicious, so here goes...
  I thought this was really good.  The changes I made were to put the round steak (whole, not sliced) into the slowcooker along with the cream of broccoli soup, water, and soy sauce.  Cooked it on low for 10hrs and when I got home from work, added the chopped broccoli florets into the pot... let those cook for about 45 minutes, and voila!  Dinner was served (and it was yummy too!).  I would have followed the recipe, but I was just too lazy and afraid that the steak would take too long to get tender (DH and I are starving by the time I get home from work and an hour to an hour and a half is an eternity on an empty stomach!).  But anyway, thanks Linda for the inspiration for a new meal in our rotation!

Tried this the other night since I had all the ingredients on hand, and it was very tasty! Yes, I did modify just a touch, I added some minced garlic for kick, and only had 98% fat free cream of broccoli...also, I served it over brown rice, and it was really very good! I too sauted the onions w/garlic and added the beef and then other ingredients. It tasted even better the next day at lunch. A solid 5 star recipe I'm adding to my collection, thank you Linda!

Excellent! The best recipes are as easy to prepare as they are delicious. I did add garlic for flavor and julienned carrots for color. Will definitely become a staple in our home. Thank you!

This recipe took exactly 45 minutes from start to finish. It was fantastic! My husband and I loved it. I used Skirt steak cut into bite size pieces because that's what I had. I followed the recipe exactly otherwise, just adding a dash of crushed red pepper, cayenne pepper, a dash of teriyaki sauce when browning beef. Soooo good and easy-I serve it over beef Rice A Roni. Definitely a keeper!!

Good recipe, but it definately needs some crushed garlic...Mushrooms are a good addition if you like...Serve over fluffy rice with chopped scallions.

This is a simple, easy way to produce near-restaurant quality beef and broccoli. It is a little bland though--so be sure to add plenty of salt, pepper, and my personal favorite... garlic!!

I added Montreal Steak Seasoning & garlic salt to the steak as it was cooking. Substituted low fat cream soup. It was a great dinner for the family & perfect for my diet.

I was surprised by how many people said this tasted like take-out - I must order something different than beef and broccoli!  This dish wasn't our favorite... I had to make a lot of alterations to get it anywhere near good.  I added A LOT of red pepper flakes, garlic, chicken broth, much more soy sauce and a bunch of teriyaki sauce.  Before I made changes, it just tasted like broccoli soup.  :P  For the people whose broccoli melted in the sauce - in the last 5-10 minutes of cooking, reduce the heat and just set your broccoli on top of everything else in the pan. Put the lid on and it will steam your broccoli and it will be yummy and crunchy, not mushy!

The taste may be delicious, however, the sodium content is too high for me.

MMMM!  Just made this for dinner tonight & everyone loved it.  The beef was very tender (used round steak & sliced it myself).  I didn't add salt because I know that soy sauce is naturally salty.  Turns out that was the right move, it turned out perfectly seasoned.  On the downside, we didn't care for the smell of it but don't let that stop you from trying this dish, it is very tasty!  Will make often.

Pardon the shabby photo. I took it while I was sitting in front of my desk, ravenous. I'm surprised there isn't a shot of a fork going in for the kill. I was that hungry. Alright. So I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter - save a few things. Instead of using fresh veggies, I used frozen and pre-chopped. I need to get out of this habit since whole fresh veggies are (presumably) cheaper, but I'm lazy. Really, really lazy. (I'm pretty sure I'll never be able to chop bell pepper so pretty.) Anyway! The cut of beef I used was on sale, so I didn't really care if it was 'round' or not. I cut it into strips. I doubled the broccoli soup, threw in some onions with the peppers along with a can of water chestnuts. Oh, and garlic. Minced garlic, since my hubby pretty much demands garlic in everything. Aside from the soup, I didn't double anything (except that the cut of meat was just over a pound, but that's really here nor there.) I did serve this over rice-a-roni, but it really doesn't need anything to go 'with' it.  Definitely add some water chestnuts. It makes a 3.5 star dinner .... well, 4. It adds that UMPH! the recipe lacks.

This was fantastic! I used leftover ribeye steak as I had some leftover and reheated steak - even ribeye- is not good.  I'll try it next time with a less good cut of beef, but I image it will taste just as good.  My husband and I ate almost the entire pan. Will be making this more often.

Great dish.  This will surely go into regular rotation for main meals.  The only suggestion is to watch the salt usage.  It's a little too salty for my taste but I will just cut back next time.

More soup?  Don't add salt - enough in soup.  Meat not as tender as it could be.  Add mushrooms?

Very easy and delicious. I did add some garlic powder to the beef and added hot chili sauce at the end, which made the flavors really stand out. Will make again!

My son's favorite supper and he doesn't even like broccoli!! This recipe is easy and great! I use one can broccoli soup and one can cream of chicken and mushroom soup. I do use frozen broccoli florets instead of fresh and it comes out perfect. I serve this over Rice Select Sushi Rice (HEB) and my kids ask for seconds every time!

My advice is use fresh broccoli on this, frozen broccoli won't give you the same taste

I made this recipe twice, once with fresh broccoli once with frozen. Fresh worked 100% better. 

Great dish. Highly recommend.

This is a great recipe! The only thing I added was about 1 cup of sliced mushrooms and 5 cloves of garlic, chopped. Cook the beef on med-high and when it browns add the garlic and onion until it softens, then follow the rest. Served it over rice; I will definitely make this again!

Very good. I did add fresh garlic and ginger(without it, it would have been bland). I also used cream of mushroom soup cuz thats what i had on hand. My 4 star rating is based on the recipe without the extra seasoning. Overall I would make this again.

This is so very yummy!!  I've made this several times (in the crock pot, because it is easier, and the meat falls apart at the end of an 8 hour day!) and add some crushed red pepper flakes and minced garlic in addition to the other ingredients.  We love it!

Loved this recipe. Very easy and quick. The only complaint I had was it was a little salty to me so next time I'll try low sodium cream of broccoli!

Tasted good. Adjustments: Garlic salt in place of salt, added 3 cloves of minced garlic to cook with onion and beef, low sodium soy sauce (1 of the tbsps cooked with the beef), 4 broccoli crowns cut (steamed separately and then mixed in with the sauce).

This is a great way to use leftover beef. I didn't change a thing and it tasted great.

This recipe was ok.  It tasted bland to me and I much prefer a more Chinese taste.  Thanks for posting though!

This is a great simple recipe. To make it restaurant quality add 1 tbsp crushed garlic while frying the onions as well as 1/2 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp crshed red peppers. Less actually because i used a whole broccolli and 1 lb beef as well as 3/4 cup of water and thickener. But man was it tasty :D

This recipe is ok...the flavor was a bit bland so I added some soy sauce to my plate.  It seemed to get better the more I ate it.  Seems like you could add lots of other stuff to your taste to enhance the dish.  Perhaps it is a good starting point.  Would also suggest a different soup would likely work as well.

I made this recipe this week for my boyfriend and I - it was super easy to make and a huge hit. We both just loved the sauce. I served it with brown rice and I'll definitely be making this dish again and again through the years. Thanks for the recipe!

I have been making this recipe for years and always use skirt steak.  It is never tough.  My family loves it!  I also have to double it because there is never enough.

Simple, quick, and easy defintely making this again. Only change I was forced to made was using cream of mushroom soup instead of broccoli as I didn't have any at home. Also added mushrooms which was a great addition.

This was a really good recipe! I really loved the flavor, and served over steamed rice really put it over the top. My 6yr old and 3yr olds do not have their molars so it was tough for them to chew the meat. So, I omited the beef in their dinners and the loved the flavor of the the broccoli and sauce.

I've used this recipe with the tweaking from another review such as onion powder instead of onions. I also used seasoning salt instead of salt. Today, I used chicken instead of beef... I love this recipe!

This was really good.  I followed the recipe very closely.  Only things I did differently were to add garlic to the oil and meat, add portabella mushrooms, and an extra can of mushroom soup (didn't have broccoli) so there would be more sauce and it would be thicker.  The meat came out extremely tender and juicy because I only cooked it for about 10 minutes before adding the veggies.  I started in a deep frying pan on the stove, but when it came time to add the veggies there were too many, so I poured it all in to a wok.  We enjoyed it very much!

This was fantastic!  I had pre-cut beef for stew already on hand so I just used that.  I didn't have any cream of broccoli, but I did have cream of mushroom, and it worked great!  I do plan to go back and try the cream of broccoli because this was so yummy.  I have 4 kids ages: 14, 10, 3, 2 and all including my hungry husband loved this!  Thank you for sharing!!!

I made this exactly as written except that I used broccoli cheese soup instead of just plain broccoli soup because that's all I could find.  There was definitely too much soy sauce and there was not enough broccoli.  I will make this again, but with the above changes.

WINNER WINNER Beef and Broccoli Dinner!  Oh so simple and quick to make!  I did add garlic while browning the meat.  I also cut the meat on the bias (and still frozen to make it easier) and it was tender.  Can't wait to have for lunch tomorrow!  This will be a regular in our house!

I've made this several times and finally decided to write a review!  My family absolutely loves this recipe.  It is not your traditional beef and broccoli, but it is very very good.  It is easy to make, and we have it at least twice a month.  I did not change anything...perfect as is.

The is am awesome recipe, I have made it a few times now and its always a hit.  The only change I have made is one tiime I only had Cheddar broccoli instead of cream of broccoli soup and it was still delicious.  I have made it with both round steak and most recently with flap meat (as it stays more tender) but both are super good.  This is a standard every few weeks at our house.

It was okay. My kids wouldn't eat it beacuse the sauce turned out to be a pukey green color. I thought the broccoli soup was a little over powering. I won't make this again.

This wasn't quite what I was expecting, but we were still very pleased.  My picky husband loved it and so did our 7 and 8 year-olds.  I did add sliced mushrooms when I added the onion. I have made twice since finding this a couple weeks ago.

Very good dish.  I bought stir fry beef so it was ready to go.  I wanted the meat tender though and added Adolf's Seasoning to help.  Unfortunately, it made the whole dish too salty.  Shame on me for rushing the meat part.  Next time I'll simmer for a good hour without the tendorizer.

Very good recipe as it is.  It is missing something though, but I can't quite put my finger on it.  Would definately experiment with the ingredients and make again.

I followed it exactly, the round steak was a bit tough even with meat tenderizer granules, I think skirt steak may be better. It was quite saucy, but tasty, and super quick and easy!  Yay!

Will definitely make it again!  I had tenderloin trimmings left over from the holidays -- perfect use!  I had fat free cream of mushroom on-hand and it tasted great with this.  Added 2 cups of campanelle pasta (on-hand) to make it go further -- it was a nice addition, but would have been delicious without.  Next time, I'll make cauliflower rice for a real calorie conscious meal.

I made the recipe as directed only used cream of mushroom soup as that's what I had on hand.  I too sautéed the onions and minced garlic in a separate skillet before adding to the steak.  I too added crushed red peppers and a splash of sriracha hot sauce.  In the future, I may marinate the steak for a few hours to help tenderize.   Overall a great meal, hubby loved it too.

Very tasty!  I made it with the leftover beef from a sirloin tip roast.   As other reviewers suggested, I added garlic and some julienned carrots.  Served with wild rice for a quick and satisfying meal.

This turned out really good. It was a little salty, but still good. I just didn’t add salt to the rice, so it balanced out. I tried not to overseason the meat. I think it was the soy sauce, like another reviewer commented. Next time I may try to use low sodium soy sauce or just use less. Will definitely use this recipe again.

I combined soy sauce with teriyaki sauce and sesame oil and put that in. Gave it great flavor. Green onions on top and some Sriracha at dinner. This is the only broccoli beef recipe I need.

I used left over beef I had cooked the day before.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of broccoli and left out the soy sauce.  I did add some garlic powder and a few fresh mushrooms.  It was excellent.  I put it over mashed potatoes.  
I might make it again.  Hubby didn't like the mushrooms.  I should have left them out.  I will next time.

Made this last night. I read lots of the postings and followed the recipe  other than also adding garlic and shredded carrots. Everyone loved it though. I'll agree that the cream of broccoli threw me off a bit but I did it. Figured worst case we will eat out but it works. It TASTES REALLY GOOD.... I def will be making this again. We east a lot of chicken in our house and my daughter is getting tired of it. So looking a different options. This is def a option we will be doing again. Thanks.

I liked this recipe for it's simplicity. It has good flavor and I will definitely make it again. If you're looking for oriental style beef with broccoli, this isn't it but it's a nice easy, filling and healthy dinner.

I was very surprised at how easy and delicious this was! It's a really nice weeknight meal that can be made in a jiffy. I use half low-sodium and have regular soy sauce.

Not quite authentic but super comforting, homey and savory. Followed the recipe to the T. The only thing I wouldn't do next time is to salt the steak - there's plenty of sodium in the soup and soy sauce.

Loved it! Even my picky boyfriend really enjoyed this. I followed the suggestion of another user and added a little bit of minced garlic while the beef was cooking and I added my own twist with tablespoon of sesame oil with the onions. Tonight I'm adding some chopped mushrooms too! I'm a fresh-out-of-college tiny adult and I really enjoy making this one.

I made it as stated, next time I will use low sodium soup (or make my own) and low sodium soy sauce as I thought it was a tad salty.  I also plan on adding sliced water chestnuts and sliced mushrooms.

Very good. I used leftover roast beef so I sautéed the onions first and then added the beef and then everything else.  Great way to use up leftover beef

Turned out pretty good...I used cream of mushroom instead of broccoli, because i didn't want the broccoli flavor to be overwhelming. I also sauteed the onions before adding the meat and added garlic. And replaced the water with beef stock. 
Gave it a 4 star, since it's not exactly the broccoli beef you'd expect...but it's pretty good. Next time I might get a can of cream of "..." that's a little bigger, so that there's more gravy to it. Or I might just make a gravy from scratch. And I'd use better soy sauce, since I used some cheap stuff that I've been trying to get rid of...so that couldn't have helped matters lol ;)
Served it on rice...even the picky 2 year old ate it!

I make this quite often, but, I also add one chopped onion and one grated clove of garlic.    After the beef and veggies are stir fried I add the soup along with rice noodles which has been softened in boiled water.    Delicious!

Loved it! I made it for two very hungry and picky cowboys, and myself and we all loved it! I didn't have any cream of broccoli soup so I used cream of mushroom instead and we LOVE hatch green chilies so I added one of those. And I didn't have any fresh broccoli so I used frozen mixed veggies. Other than that I stuck to the recipe and we all loved it!

Tonight I tried this recipe. I did not like it at all. The meal was very bland, I followed the recipe and added broccolli exactly as what was called for  I overcooked the meat, which is my fault. Overall, I was very displeased with it and would not cook it again.

One of my absolute favorites! I use seasoned wok oil instead of olive oil, and tenderized flat iron steak. Add minced garlic or tastefully simple garlic garlic mix. Beef and broccoli is my all time favorite Chinese dish, so I make this all the time. Family loves it too!

This was very tasty.  As someone had mentioned, I cut the meat against the grain although it still wasn't as tender as I would have liked.  I also added garlic and a red pepper.  The end result was yummy!  I will make again.

Even though I added water chestnuts, freshly chopped ginger and garlic, it tasted like "Beef & Broccoli" in cream of broccoli soup.  Next time, I'll try a different recipe that will be more like the restaurant style.

Neighbor told me about this great recipe.  Only changes I made were to add 2 TBSP of minced garlic to the meat while it cooked and used 2 TBSP of soy sauce; letting folks add more at the table if needed.  My family loved it so will make this again. I served it on top of brown rice.  Next time I make it I'd like to add some thinly sliced red bell peppers and a dash of red pepper flakes and/or dried ginger.

I was skeptical that this would have an Asian taste, but was very pleased.  I didn't have cream of broccoli soup, so used cream of chicken. I also added carrots and fresh garlic.  The family loved it.  We will certainly repeat this recipe again!

Tasty but bland. I added garlic, but it was still missing something. I'll probably make it again, but only after reading through some good tweaks.

This is a quick yummy recipe. The canned soup makes the sauce more like a beef gravy instead of restaurant-style beef with broccoli. One day I'd like to find an authentic recipe too but I'll keep making this one, we really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing!

while it looked pretty good... the smell was terrible... It definitely didnt taste like beef brocolli you would get at a chinese restaurant...  I dont think the cream of brocolli soup was necissary at all.  so I took two bites and threw it away.  I gave it a 2 because my husband ate a bit of it more than me.

Super easy but had zero flavor. I was skeptical when looking at the ingredients, wish I had gone with my instints. We purchase premium beef from the butcher which usually makes even the simplest recipes delicious but not the case with this. This had almost zero flavor- we had to add Asian marinade from the fridge at the dinner table just to give it SOME kind of flavor. This is one of the only dishes I've ever made where my husband didn't take the leftovers to work.

This was very tasty. The first time I made it I used round steak and it was really tough. The second time I made it with flat iron steak, and it was much better and not too expensive. I followed others' suggestions to add cream of mushroom soup, garlic and worcheshire sauce. Plenty of sauce to go over the steamed white rice. Very good. And my kids loved it.

This recipe was awesome!!!  I tried it again the week after with chicken and it was even better.  I used chicken tenderloins and browned them in olive oil and salt and pepper and then followed the recipe.  I do use less onion than it calls for.  Honestly, it is so easy and delicious it will become one of your family's favorites!!!

This was good. I used leftover homemade cream of broccoli(the one from this website) I think it would be good with added ingredients as well, such as garlic and carrots slices. I tenderlized the meat via mallet first.  I served it over white rice.

This was a great simple recipe Everyone loved it.  I modified it a bit seasoned my meat with garlic, mustard, onions, green onions, kraft italian dressing, and mashed black pepper seeds in a table spoon of olive oil and rosemary and let it marinate for about 30mins

easy and delicious! I make this every week, my 18 month old loves this. To add a little heat I add about 1 teaspoon of crushed red peppers, but it is good as is.

My family loved this recipe! I made some rice cooked in beef broth and smothered the rice in the beef and broccoli and it was amazing. (and I usually dont like rice) Will definitely make again and my husband is sooooo looking forward to it when I do!

Excellent recipe! The only change I made was I served it over brown rice and I didn't have cream of broccoli soup on hand so I used cream of mushroom instead.  It tasted wonderful and my kids loved it!  I will make this again-but next time I will double it and I think I'll add the garlic like others have suggested-and maybe even more vegetables.

Since my husband doesn't like onions, I used onion powder - used garlic salt instead of salt - added lots of water chestnuts and added lots of cayenne and crushed red pepper (we love spicy). It was a great dish over some chow mein noodles and it was easy! Definitely making it again!

Very bland, even after adding garlic and pepper.  My family was not a fan (and they normally enjoy dishes like this).

This was GREAT!!  I did add some minced garlic to my meat while cooking and I used frozen baby broccoli and cooked in microwave and cooked before adding to the mix.  The only thing different I will do next time is us low sodium soy sauce, regular made it a bit salty.  I might even add some shrimp to the mix too.  Thanks!!

Our Asian guests loved this (with rice).  We did also.  Added mushrooms and extra soy sauce, otherwise followed recipe proportions.

This meal is easy to make, and easy on your budget. I wanted to cook the meat slow in a crock pot but was short on time, so I beat the meat to tenderize it, then cooked it and the onion in a skillet. I added a few cloves of minced garlic to the pan to give it more flavor. I added 3 Tbs of soy sauce as directed, and over rice it was not salty, but you could easily cut back to 2 Tbsp. I serve it over rice with egg rolls. I for sure would not add any additional salt, such as garlic salt.

I made this as directed with the addition of more spices.  I added garlic powder as some others suggested and lots of pepper.  I only added a tiny bit of salt (garlic salt) and I used low sodium soy sauce but it was still too salty for my boyfriend.  I ate mine over rice (he doesn't eat rice or pasta) and it didn't taste as salty.  We will certainly make this again.  When I first found the recipe I didn't have soy sauce and considered using worcestershire so I was thankful for the reviewer who said that was not a good substitute.

well, it is a good recipe idea if you tweek it a bit, but it is not an asian dish in the least. also, i used sliced rib eye, as it is a very tender cut of beef and is sure to be tender.

This is the easiest really good recipe! I have been making this for at least 3 yrs, since I joined allrecipes. Its quick, tasty and a staple in my home. I change it up all the time adding different veggies or brown sugar for more of a teriyaki flavor. The way to make a cheap cut of steak stay tender is to cut against the grain of the meat and let the whole dish simmer for about a half hour. Its a family fave with the pickiest eater asking for seconds.

This recipe is edible, but that's about it. The biggest downside is that it tastes like condensed cream of broccoli soup. There are lots of pre-packaged beef and broccoli sauces that taste better, are quicker and easier to use, and just as healthy.

I was iffy about this recipe because of other reviews that had changed so much. I added some garlic salt and a little less onion than called for and it turned out to be delicious! I would recommend making few changes to this recipe. Serve with rice and you won't be disappointed! It tasted better than the Chinese buffet stuff I love so much!

Excellent. Only thing I changed was adding a little more soy sauce as well as a few cloves of garlic. I may add even more garlic next time.

I made this beef and broccoli for dinner tonight and it was just ok.  It does get bonus points for being extremely quick and very easy to make using ingredients that we normally have on hand.  Unfortunately, the end result was a little blah (even though I added about 3 cloves of garlic in addition to the other ingredients).  I use salt in most of my cooking, but I found the 3 Tbsp of soya sauce called for in this recipe was just too much; the end result was very salty and pretty much the only flavour in the dish.

Great, simple recipe! I decided to try this recipe out for a simple Sunday supper. I read some of the reviews before I started making it to see what kind of things other ppl added. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and I cooked the beef seperate with about half of the soy sauce (maybe a little more) and seasoned it with salt and pepper. When the meat and veggies were ready I mixed them together and served it over rice.  We were truly impressed with how good it was! Perfect for a cold, winter night!

This was a very tasty dish but i think if I would have cut the broccoli bigger it would have been better. The broccoli melted in the broth and was too mushy.

so yummy, quick and easy to make! i would definitely reccommend serving over rice because there is a lot of sauce that needs to be soaked up.  also, the meat comes out kind of tough, so next time i will have to find a way to tenderize it a bit more.  overall an AWESOME meal that everyone is sure to love!

I really like this recipe.  It was easy and quick to make.  My kids loved it.  My wife did not care so much for the cream of Broccoli.  I think the next time I make this I will cut the cream of Broccoli in half.  I will be making this dish many time in the future.

I was concerned about some reviewers' comments about tough meat. I decided to start the onions first, followed by the meat. I cooked that just until it lost its red color, then added the other ingredients and cooked further. The meat was just fine. I added some garlic and had a small can of sliced mushrooms on hand so I added that.My husband loved it; I thought it was pretty good. I would make again.

This was good, but I would have preferred more of a kick to it.  It was a little bland, but definitely better than the other beef and broccoli recipes on this site.  The condensed soup really adds some flavor.  Next time I will try to get some sort of Chinese hot sauce to add to it.

Great recipe for people that don't have a lot of time to cook.  I bought pre cut round tip stir fry steak.  Just cook the meat and mix all the ingredients for a delicious meal.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This had very little taste, was tough, and seemed to be nothing like its Asian inspiration.

This was so quick and easy. But the meat was pretty tough. I liked usingthe soup for the "gravy", but I dont think Ill make this again.

Good Recipe- I substituted worchestere sauce for soy sauce and it wasn't too good a substitution. :(  I thought 3 tablespoons was way too much- I thought it would be creamy but turned into more of a gravy.  I'll try it again sometime and use soy sauce but I think I'll only use 1 tablespoon or so.

This was pretty good. Very easy to make. Even my picky eaters liked it. I served it with mashed potatoes but rice would go well with it also. Next time I may add some 'shrooms to it as well. I only put half the onion it called for. I chopped it all but started feeling like I was having a little meat with my onion! :) It was very good though. Thanks for the quick dinner!

Delicious and sooo easy! Since I was serving this to several kids, I wanted the meat to be nice and tender, so I simmered it in the soup mixture for a little over an hour, and added the broccoli in the last twenty minutes of cooking. Unfortunately, the broccoli still got pretty mushy, but it still very tasty. Served it over white rice. The sauce had reduced down pretty far during the long cooking time and didn't coat the rice like I would've liked, but I will correct for that next time, as I will be making it again! I'm going to try it with chicken, too.

My husband really enjoyed this, and it was very easy and quick.  I also pounded the meat before slicing.
