Ok, I was in need of something new so I tried this leary of the results. My pork chops were GONE. Even my 2 year old that won't eat meat devoured!!! Tonight I decided to use the sauce on chicken. Yet again DEVOURED!!! I am thouroughly IMPRESSED with this recipe! I did, however, cover my pork chops/chicken then last 5 minutes I uncovered and broiled per others advice and I could not have had a better recipe! THANKS Kim!

This was a huge success in our house this evening although I did make a few minor changes.  I added diced onion and then covered the baking dish with foil for the first half hour of cooking.  I then removed the foil, drained the liquid and poured the remainder of the sauce over the chops and cooked uncovered for another 20 minutes.  The result was succulent, tender and very tasty with all the family going back for seconds.  Will definitely keep this recipe handy.  Thank you to the original poster.

This is incredibly easy and delicious.  The chops were SO juicy.  I used boneless ones that were 1-1.5 inches thick and they cooked perfectly in 30 mins.  I also substituted teriyaki sauce for soy sauce because I didn't have any and it worked well.  Just a note: I prepared the full recipe for 2 chops and used every bit.  I would double or triple the recipe for 6.

I'm going to do what I don't like to see other people do and tell you all the changes I made while giving this recipe 4 stars!  I replaced the ketchup with chili garlic sauce, replaced the lemon juice with lime juice, and replaced all of the oil with just 1 Tbsp of sesame oil for a doubled sauce recipe.  I also added 2 Tbsp of rice wine vinegar, again for a doubled recipe.  I broiled the pork chops, six minutes per side and reduced the marinade to serve as a sauce.  Everyone, kids included, loved this.  The basic dish was a great jumping off place for us!

This was a very good recipe...easy to make and I already had all the ingredients in the house.  The only thing I would do differently next time is perhaps try to let it actualy marinade for the day so that the flavor actually get into the chop.  This time I increased the oven temp to 375 and decreased the cooking time to about 15 mins each side for a boneless chop (1 inch thick) and then let it sit under the broiler for about 3 mins just to get the sauce to "stick" this variation seemed to work out just great the sauce didn't slide off as other reviewers mentioned and the pork chop was tender and not at all dry.  I will definately try this again!

Don't know where the poster for this recipe buys their pork chops, but for six pork chops I ended up quadrupling the recipe and using Rice Wine Vinegar in place of more Oil, to have a proper marinade.

This recipe is also not used as a marinade, it's used as a baste more or less, there's zero time in the instructions outside of cooking where the meat is soaking in the mixture (which is what marinades are!).

4 tbsp. Soy Sauce
4 tbsp. Rice Wine Vinegar
4 tbsp. Lime Juice
4 tbsp. Worcestershire Sauce
6 tbsp. Extra Virgin Olive Oil
6 tbsp. Brown Sugar
6 tbsp. Ketchup
4 clvs. Garlic minced

Thoroughly mixed in tupperware container, added in pork chops, closed and shook thoroughly before going to work. Stopped home on lunch and gave it another thorough shaking. 

Cooked on a raised rack in roasting pan @ 350 for 30 min a side, reduced remainder of marinade in a saucepan and drizzled on pork chops before serving.

Really good sauce recipe!  The sauce was delicious.  However, I made the full amount of sauce for 3 pork chops and there still was not enough.  Next time I will double the amount of sauce.

I am not normally a pork eater--but these were great--very juicy!  I made a few changes though.  I marinated them all day in the full marinade recipe and added some minced garlic.  Then right before baking, I made a 1/2 recipe of the marinade and as they were cooking continued to brush it on both sides.  They were delicious!  I will add this one to the "honey make again" pile!

Really good chops.  Great flavor.  I tripled the sauce and marinated the chops for about an hour before baking.  I may leave the oil out of the sauce next time as the chops seemed a bit oily.  The sauce does not stay thick which was a bit disappointing.  I used thin chops but I think they would be much better with a thicker cut.  Great marinade for grilling, too.

I doubled the sauce recipe, but followed it exactly.  The only thing I did different was sprinkle some garlic salt on the chops before putting the sauce on.  They came out really good!  The only thing I would change next time is adding a little more brown sugar to make the sauce thicker.  This was a keeper!

I make these a lot, and always add garlic powder, paprika and vinegar. Turns out good every time.

I tried this recipe last night,  I have to admit, I didn't have high expectations, but I was amazingly surprized at how good it actually was.  This will be one I will try again and again.  Next time I will line the pan with foil, as the sauce burnt on the bottom of the pan and took a lot of elbow grease to remove!

My family really enjoyed these chops.  I used boneless pork and didn't trim so next time I will use less oil.  I had also added a pat of butter to the sauce just for extra flavor. I didn't have lemon juice so I used red wine vinegar instead.  When I pulled them from the oven, I kept 1/4 of sauce with the pork chops and made gravy form the 3/4 of the sauce.  It turned out great!  I used the gravy for the chops and rice and served brussel sprouts with the meal.  I almost had the leftovers for breakfast!  But I waited for lunch and it was just as good!

This marinade is delicious and sooo easy!!I tripled ingredients to make marinade for 6 1-inch boneless chops, subbing teriyaki sauce for soy. Mixed marinade in large ziploc, added chops, and threw in fridge about 4 hrs. I poured all into foil-lined baking dish with quartered onion and baked for 20 mins, covered. I then poured off excess liquid, and spooned double batch of sauce on flip side. Baked, uncovered, 15 mins more. I served them with garlic mashed potatoes and creamed peas! Hubby and kids say this one is "for sure a keeper"

After reading other reviews, I did made my sauce in the morning and marinaded pork chops all day.  Baked at 375 for 20 minutes on each side and finished off by broiling for a few minutes to get that crispy coating - very tasty!

Great recipe! I doubled the recipe to put over rice or mashed potatoes and everyone loved it. I've used this recipe quite a few times already and have used it with chicken as well. I tweaked the recipe just a bit by adding a tablespoon of minced garlic. One suggestion...add the oil after combining all other ingredients.

This was great, I did how ever double the sauce because my Pork Chops where real thick and I also cooked for less time because the first time I cooked them they were dry so I put half of sauce on the chops and then covered and cooked 20 min and then took cover off and turned them over and  put the rest of the sauce on them then cooked 20 more min and they were perfect!

I have a family of 7.  Five out of the 7 are children ages ranging from 18-5 yrs and they all love this.  However, I did make changes in the oils.  I used extra virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also doubled the recipe.  Cook for the specified time alloted however for the first 30 minutes I keep the chops covered.  The last thirty minutes I add the second batch of sauce (drizzle it on), leave the foil off, and kick the temp up to 425.  This allow things to caramelize.  Great combination on the ingredients.

Yeah!  On my third attempt I was finally able to get some really good results.  First attempt the sauce didn't stick at all, was basically pointless.  Second attempt they were way overcooked.  This time I doubled the recipe for only 4 chops, except for the vegetable oil, which I only increased by 50% after so many people saying they'd gotten good results leaving it out entirely.  I was using boneless chops, put half the sauce on top and cooked covered with foil for 15 minutes.  Took it out, spooned out most of the liquid, put the rest of the sauce on top and cooked uncovered for 10 minutes.  Then broiled for 5 minutes.  Next time I will probably either decrease the oil more or save some sauce to put on it right before the broil to keep more of it intact.  Finally, these were some of the best pork chops I'd eaten, required no added salt or ketchup, which I normally rely on since I don't love pork.

Excellent recipe.  Truly JUICY Pork chops in an hour.  Kids: 9yr and 2 yr all wanted MORE!  ONE TIP: Marinade for a few hours in fridge for a deeper taste. TWO TIP: Personally I make twice as much sauce as needed to keep the chops even juicier.  THREE TIP: Save on washing up; dump everything in a ziploc and shake, shake, shake.

I made this tonight with 3 pork chops (as opposed to 6 in the recipe).  I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil and tomato sauce for the ketchup.  I also omitted the Worcestershire sauce, because I didn't have any on hand.  In addition, I added a package of sliced fresh mushrooms and a large chopped sweet onion.  Plus overall, I made more marinade than in the recipe (about DOUBLE, in spite of the fact that I used fewer chops), figuring the onion and mushrooms would need marinade - which they did.  The result was delicious, and I enjoyed the added health benefit of the vegetables.  Will definitely make again!

These were great! 
I doubled the recipe for 6 chops and added a tablespoon more brown sugar to make the sauce a little thicker. Cover&cook for 30 minutes, strain pan, flip over chops, brush marinade all over them, cook uncovered for 25 min, and broil the last 5 minutes. PERFECT. 
I also make the marinade when I buy the chops, freeze it WITH the chops, in the same ziploc bag. Just put it in the fridge to defrost over night and bam, marinated pork chops.

This gets four stars for the following reasons: The pork should be covered while baking, and there needs to be a specification of what type of pork chops need to be used in order for you to have to bake them for an hour. I used boneless and they took 20 minutes.

I love this recipe!  I double the sauce,use boneless centre cut chops, keep covered with foil for entire cooking time...which I've changed to 2 hours. Chops are the most tender I've ever had. You can literally cut them with a fork. Even my picky husband who likes his chops dry loves them.

Absolutely delicious! I felt like a cavewoman chomping on the bone to get every last bit off! I took the advice of others and broiled the last 5 minutes and reduced the oil to about 1 tbsp. Other than that, didn't change a thing. This went right to my recipe box & I can't wait til next week when I can make again!

I am only a beginner cook, but you made me look like a rock star! even my picky 6 year old ate the pork chops - the entire family loved them. I took the advice of others and cooked at 350 covered for a while and then poured out the runny juices, then topped with remaining sauce and put under the broiler for 5 minutes...delicious! The only thing I added was fresh garlic to the sauce. Thank you for posting this recipe!

Very good recipe!  As others recommended, increased the marinade, added fresh chopped garlic and marinated in half the sauce prior to baking. Used Splenda brown sugar. Excellent results.  Will make again!

I've made this twice by mistake.  The pork chops are chewy, the sauce is like water and tasteless.  I am deleting it from my recipe box.

The flavor of these chops was good, but there was something a little bit lacking, which I think has more to do with the means of cooking, rather than the marinade itself. Ultimately, I think this marinade would make some fantastic grilled pork chops, but baking it is rather boring. Some other notes: I made the entire marinade recipe for two chops, and wouldn't have wanted any less. Also, actually leaving the chops to marinate for a couple hours(had I had the time) would have given more flavor. The only thing I added in cooking was chopping up 1/2 onion and throwing it on top of the chops after coating them with sauce; I think this was a good addition.

Update: this recipe does work much better as a grill marinade. Grilled, I give it 4 stars, baked, only 3.

I added garlic powder to this and followed the advice of other to cover the pork then broil uncovered for the last 5 minutes.  Husband loved this, and it is very easy to make!

Marinated Baked Pork Chops' Haiku: "There's not enough sauce. (And it 'slides' off the chops too.) Directions seem flawed." Surprised to see this called "marinated" when there's no indication of actually marinading the chops. I had 3 nice chops, and I used the entire recipe's amount of ingredients and did marinate them for 2 hrs. Checking on the chops at 30 min. and surprise! They were almost done =/ So I quickly stirred up a 1/2 amount of the recipe again, poured it over them (b/c at this point, the sauce had slipped away and was just pooled in the pan), finished the last of the baking, and took the suggestion of a review to kick it a broil to try to make the sauce stick. Can't say that we were too thrilled w/ the end result, and it's a shame, b/c the chops themselves were thick and beautiful. I'm always happy to try a new recipe out though, since we're usually pork-chop-purists w/ EVOO, S&P.

This was an excellent standard pork chop.  I used the full marinade for only 4 pork chops and substituted 1 TBSP of molasses for 1 TBSP of brown sugar (2 TBSP sounded way too sweet) and they were great.  Also, I baked them covered for the first 30 min and uncovered for the last 30.

Excellent! I scaled this to serve two and was very happy!! I also tripled the sauce and tried it on chicken drumsticks which was very good! The only thing I changed was the baking time, it only needed 10-15 minutes on each side as I was only cooking for two.

These were really good.  I marinated for several hours and used boneless chops.  I think next time I will try the center loin cut.  I doubled the sauce and used all of it from the start.  I covered the dish in foil and cooked them for about 45 minutes.  That was probably a little too long.  The flavor was really good except a little too heavy on the soy sauce flavor.  It was very obvious.  All the other flavors blended together to make a sauce I will use again and again.

Really the best recipe for pork chops I've made....the sauce is just so good--tangy and savory.  I love it on my mashed potatoes too!  Oh, and this sauce works just as well on chicken!  My pork chops were done in almost half the time.

Great recipe the pork chops were so tender and juicy. I add some ground ginger to the mixture, reduced the amount of brown sugar to two teaspoons, and added some dice onions. I covered the pork chops baked them for 30 minutes, removed the foil and baked them for another 30 minutes.

As it stands I can only rate this with 3 stars.   This is a tasty sauce, but I feel the recipe should state that boneless, 1 inch pork chops are the best becauise they do not dry out.  Also, about 15 mins. less cooking time.  Again, I love the sauce but for our tastes we only like pork when it is juicy. It does not have to be dried out.

Great, I mixed the ingredients in the morning before work the day I was going to make these pork chops.  Let them marinade in a big ziploc bag and put them in the fridge.  Dumped the whole thing in the 9x13 when I was ready to bake.  I'm telling you this was good, next time I would probably make up extra to add half way through cooking or just slightly cut down on the cooking time because they were a bit dry but I will definitely make these again, and they're even better the next day!!

Great!  I marinated the chops all day and threw them in the oven for dinner.  They only took 30 mins to be done perfectly.  Nice flavor.

Sauteed in iron skillet in oil first.  Sprinkled salt & pepper.  Poured the sauce (I tripled the soy sauce, worcestershire, lemon juice and ketchup - but not the brown sugar)  Did not put oil in sauce since I had already sauteed my boneless chops.  Then I put a little onion on top and baked right in the iron skillet.

These were so good. I was very skeptic of this recipe because of the ingredients, ketchup and pork chops didn't sound like a good mix to me, but I used 6 thin bone-in pork chops, and made double of the marinade. I marinated them for 1 hour, covered, and threw into the oven at 400 degrees for half and hour, then i flipped them and cooked for another 20 mins, and then turned the oven up to broil for 5 mins (so the marinade would stick) Fantastic!

This recipe is a family favorite. We make these chops almost monthly. I do prefer to use boneless chops. In the summer, I use the marinade and grill the chops. Yum!

This didn't work for me. Chops came out dry and tough, and the sauce didn't do much. I think Famous Pork Chops on this site is a better chop recipe.

Taste was good, but recipe didn't mention draining off juices..  sauce was diluted to broth.. too bad it would have been better a little thicker, and I didn't have time to put it in a pan and reduce it to a thicker consistency.  Also, cooking time is a little off.. I cooked for 30 min, then added remainder of sauce and cooked for only 15 more minutes.  My husband liked them, but I found the pork chops to be too dry..  Next time I will only cook for 30 minutes..

These are delicious! The other viewers are right about the recipe being only for 2 pork chops. And I think adding the last half of the sauce at the end was key... so it could settle on the meat. Definitely making again!

This recipe is wonderful! The only thing I will change the next time I make it is to reduce the cooking time. My pork chops dried out due to cooking too long, but the sauce was excellent and we will definitely make it again!

My husband and I enjoyed this easy weeknight meal.  I made it with boneless chops (so I decreased cooking time to 10 minutes on each side).  I also added an onion before baking.  Next time I would double the sauce for dipping.  Yummy!

I have to give this 5 stars. I made this a few times already and my family really enjoys this. I did my own little changes to this recipe though. I covered the dish w/ foil while baking to keep the moisture in and 5 minutes before I took the chops out of the oven I removed the foil and broiled them to thicken up the marinate and kind of candy coat the chops. I LOVE this recipe and so does my husband.

One of the nicest porkchop recipes I've seen. Only additions I made were a pinch of garlic powder and I added a peeled and quarted onion in among the chops and basted it with the sauce. Make extra sauce! About 3/4 of the way thru the cooking time, it looks to be swimming in sauce and whammo..it sort of absorbs it all, so check and make sure you have sauce! Yummy, yummy porkchops!

This was very good. Next time I will increase the amount of sauce, and marinate for a few hours before putting in the oven. Also, don't forget that depending on how thick your chops are, you may need to decrease the amount of baking time. Forgot to put that into consideration and my first attempt came out slightly dry.

Doubled the sauce as suggested by others.  Very good.  Sweet, but not overly so since sweet is good with pork.  Seasoned pork with salt/pepper and garlic powder, then seared in skillet before baking.  This gave the pork a nice crust.

This recipe was delicious - My husband and I really enjoyed it - He was ready to eat it again the following night! The pork chops were moist and juicy - will definitely make it again!

I LOVED this marinade...not too sweet, not too tart.  I scaled it down to 3 servings for my extra large single bone-in porkchop.  I cooked it for exactly one hour and it was moist enough to cut without a knife. Fantastic,

We did not like this very much.  Edible, but tasted like ketchup even though we followed it to the exact measurement (just tripled the recipe for our big family).  I would have rather just used some BBQ sauce.

After reading previous reviews, I made the following changes:  tripled the sauce except that I only used 2 TBSPs of oil, one of which was seseme oil.  I would only use one next time (seseme) b/c there was oil standing on sauce.  I did add about 3 TBSP of rice wine vinegar to make up for using less oil.  I also used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 chili sauce. 
I cooked 4 chops with half of the sauce for 30 min (covered) then flipped the chops and added the rest of the sauce, covered, and cooked for 20 min.  I then uncovered and put under the broiler for 3 min on each side.  Once it cooled a little the sauce thickened up a bit and it was really good.
I served it with Harvest Rice from this site and green beans.  Would definitely make again!

Blah.  Had to drain baking dish b/c my chops were basically boiling.  Not sure if this was supposed to be the "marinated" part of the dish.

Didn't like this recipe at all.  The marinade did not stick to the chops, and didn't make the chops tender at all.  Thumbs down for me!

I ended up with dry, overcooked meat.  I increased the marinade, used thick chops, but when I check the temp of the meat at 20 minutes,it was already at 158 degrees.

The cooking time on this recipe is about 45 minutes too long! The oven temp should be higher too. I would say 450. The sauce is strictly a marinade as stated in recipe. Arrowroot or cornstarch to thicken for sauce and heat, but it is lacking flavor depth. Do not overcook pork like your grandmother used to. It should be pink in the middle. Any further cooking will only toughen the meat unless it is stewed to a fall apart texture.

This was very yummy and smelled delicious while baking. Next time, I think I will let the chops sit in the marinade in the fridge for awhile longer and cut down on the cooking time. My chops came out a little dry. A thicker cut could have helped that. I will be making these again!

This was fine, but it didn't knock our socks off.  Probably won't make again.  It was easy, but I agree with other reviewers that there wasn't enough sauce, and I only had 4 chops.

Was good...everyone finished, even picky kids.  Next time I think I will literally marinate the pork chops in part of the sauce before hand, because the sauce had a tendency to turn watery during the cooking process and did not allow the flavor to REALLY come through in the meat.  Will be part of rotation though!  Thank you!

Delicious!  Made this with skinless/boneless chicken breasts.  I used 1 tsp of olive oil (instead of called for oil), added fresh minced garlic and 1 tsp of vinegar.  Baked at 400 covered with foil for first 25 mins, removed foil and broiled remaining 5.  Extremely tender and tasty.  I'm hooked.

I made this exactly as written with 5 assorted bone-in chops. It was absolutely perfect! I think using bone-in chops really adds to the flavor and tenderness of the chops. The only thing I like better than this version is grilling them. This is perfect for winter. Thanks for sharing! :)

I absolutely LOVED this recipe.  The sauce is what makes it fabulous.  The flavor is so savory and delicious.    I had four 1/2 inch thick pork chops and doubled the ingredients which worked out perfect.  I only cooked 20 mins on one side, 15 on the other and a 5 min broil.  The broil made a big difference.  It carmelized the sauce giving it a nice flavor.  I will definitely use this sauce on ribs, it is a perfect rib sauce recipe.  Also BBQ chicken as well.  Super easy and very tasty!  The flavor will keep you wanting more!

My picky 11 year old daughter said "Wow, Mom!"  This marinade is a keeper.  I did add a little minced onion and garlic salt to the pork chops.  I doubled the marinade and marinaded all day.  Cooked covered for 30 minutes and then topped with a second doubled batch of the marinade, cooked an additional 20 minutes, removed foil and broiled for 5 minutes.  DELICIOUS!

I was a little surprised that since the name of the recipe is Marinated Baked Pork Chops it didn't call for you to actually marinate them before cooking! But I followed other reviewers advice and marinated them for about 6 hours in a double bath of the sauce. I used about 1.5 inch thick chops and they were totally done (almost too done) within 20 minutes of cooking. Next time I will reduce the cooking time to 6-7 minutes each side. I made another batch of the sauce and basted them a few times while cooking. Even though they were a little more done than we prefer the flavor was very good. I served them with the Oven-Roasted Potatoes from this website and fresh green beans. Will definitely make again!

I marinated the pork chops for half a day and it didn't seem to matter.   I thought they turned out very dry and almost flavorless.

These chops were sooooo yummy!!! I did only one thing different, instead of lemon juice I used some pineapple juice. (I only did this because I didn't have lemon juice on hand, but I did have some fresh pineapple) Also, my chops were a thin cut. They turned out absolutely wonderful and my husband Loved them!!

I needed a quick recipe one night to jazz up some pork chops.  So I went online and found this recipe.  I had all of the ingredients in the house already which was a bonus!  I double the sauce per other reviews, and used 1/2 inch boneless chops.  After I cooked them for 15 minutes on each side, I was concerned that the sauce was not sticking.  So then I brushed more sauce on them and broiled them for 3 minutes on each side.  It ended up caramelizing the sauce, and they tasted wonderful!  Next time, I will extend the broiling time to 5 minutes on each side.  Thanks for the recipe!

We thought this was a great pork chop recipe.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I did make a few changes.  First, I seasoned the chops with salt and pepper and brown in a bit of oil.  Then I doubled the marinade and poured all of it over the porkchops, and then just flipped them after 30 minutes and cooked for the final 30.  Yummy!

This is a recipe the whole family will love. I'm not too fond of pork, but this recipe is delicious. Also, the marinade can be made ahead, refrigerated and used the next day.

I loved this sauce!  It would have been perfect if the cut of pork I used was better, but I'm definitely going to be making this again and trying it with chicken.  I made 4 times the amount of sauce called for (left out the oil, didn't need it) and also put sliced up onion on the bottom for the chops to sit on top of.  I also drained off the excess liquidy sauce before adding the last half.  The sauce was excellent over rice and even my picky "I don't like sweet or tangy sauces" husband said he definitely wants it again!

Great flavor in the sauce.  Doubled it for four boneless chops approx. 1/2 inch thick.  Cooked 30 mins. covered on one side and positioned on a bed of sliced onions, then 15 minutes on the other side, with a finish of 5 minutes under the broiler.  This was 50 mins. of cooking and too long.  Good, but dry.  I'll definitely make again, but will adjust the cooking time.  The onions were amazing with the soaked up sauce.  Great recipe!  Four stars due to instructions on marinade, cover/uncover, and cook time.

YUM YUM! I absolutely love this recipe.  I marinated the chops overnight. I doubled the sauce as others did.  I also used a broiler pan rather than the baking dish.  Before turning the chops, I drained excess fat and liquid, then turned and applied the remaining sauce.  Chops were so tender and definitely delicious.  This recipe is a keeper for sure.

The name is misleading on this one.A marinade needs to sit on the meat awhile prior to cooking to soak its flavor into meat,this is a basted or brushed on sauced pork chop recipe,not marinaded.However if done as a real marinade,allowing juice to sit on meat,make plenty more sauce,the recipe does not make enough sauce. The recipe has errors,but if tweaked some it has a great flavor. Make more sauce for sure,bake the meat shorter tome so it isn't dry,and actually marinade it correctly,let pork sit in juice for at least an hour,if not several hours,to a day.THEN it tastes wonderful,and juicy,and flavor penetrates the pork well.

Me and my family love this marinade! I used this recipe once before with regular pork chops but I doubled up on the sauce and added minced onion. I used the recipe this evening for a pork roast which I tripled the sauce to cover the large guy and placed it in my crock-pot for six hours (or 8hrs if done earlier in the morning ;)) and it came out even more scrumptious. I will be using this again.

I marinated it for about an hour. The pork chops were about 1-1.5 inches thick. I made 1.5x the sauce in the recipe for 4 chops. I covered the dish with foil and baked for 20 min, then uncovered, flipped the chops, spooned the remaining sauce on top, and baked for another ten minutes. The pork turned out very tender and the flavor permeated the entire pork chop so it wasn’t plain at all. Yum!

The flavor from the sauce on these Pork Chops made this an awesome dish.  I followed the directions to a "T" except I doubled the sauce.  My chops were rather thick so it took the whole hour to cook.  Will be making these again for sure.  I think the sauce could be used to marinate chicken or fish.

The sauce and marinade is fantastic and has an Asian flair. I quadrupled the recipe because I wanted plenty. I used 1/2 toasted sesame oil and substituted Heinz chili sauce for 3/4 of the ketchup. Also added 2T sweet Asian chili sauce. I seasoned the chops before marinating with seasoning salt and black pepper. I marinated them for an hour for an hour before cooking. I baked in a cast iron skillet covered with foil for the 1st half hour. I checked the internal temp of the chops and it was already at 195! I still baked for 1/2 hour more and they got more tender. My girlfriend raved. This recipe is a keeper!

Let me start by saying that my husband really doesn't like the way I make pork chops. After making this recipe, he said that they were the best pork chops I've made in 30 years! I had 4 boneless pork chops that I used for the recipe. I also doubled the sauce ingredients as suggested by others. I only cooked them for 45 minutes and then let them rest. They were cooked perfect. This recipe is a keeper.

I was totally disappointed. Only on my part tho. I can't figure out what i did wrong. I made this recipe to a T, but the sauce was to thin from the get go and never stuck to the chops. Flavor was good, but i still ended up with barbecue sauce being used to dip them in. Any suggestions??

usually not a fan of pork chops, but this was very tasty. i'd recommend baking uncovered so the sauce thickens up on the top and def broil for the last 5 mins.

This was awesome!! This was the first time I ever cooked in an oven..I'm strictly a grill guy.. But it's too cold in Michigan to grill right now.. It was easy and tasted wonderful.. I didn't have any worcestershire so I substituted with A1..

Good sauce. I would suggest making extra for dipping. I also marinated the meat for a couple hours in the sauce prior to cooking

This has become a staple in our home.  I love saucy foods, but my hubby doesn't so much.  I came across this and decided to see how he liked it.  I make an extra bit of the sauce to set aside for later, so I can have more if I want.  We both LOVED it!  and he happily agreed he could eat this often.

I made this marinade the first time for a large family meal. The flavor was fantastic, and I will definitely use is again. One batch wasn't enough, even after I recalculated the number of chops. Plan on possibly making a double if you want them saucy.

Did I make this right? I had to triple the sauce recipe and it still didn't have much flavor. I'm confused. Oh well.

These are by far the best pork chops that I have ever tasted. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I didn't use vegetable oil, I used olive oil since that was all I had on hand. I also doubled the recipe, next time I will triple it, it was so yummy. I (accidently) marinated it for 2 days! I put it in the fridge to let it sit in the juice for a couple hours, but we had other dinner plans so it got left in there for 2 days and it tasted delicious. I, like many other reviewers broiled the pork chops after cooking them and it was well worth the wait, so great. The whole family loved them, even the ones who don't usually like pork chops :) Thanks for sharing your great recipe.

I added this recipe to my regular line-up years ago and we had it again tonight. It's so easy to make and has a distinctive tangy-sweet flavor. The last couple of times I made it it did not turn out right--way too much liquid in the pan after cooking--but I realized it's probably because they add a 5-10% "solution" to the meat. So this time I just drained all the liquid before adding the remaining sauce and did not have any problem with the finished dish. Also, I cut the amount of oil in half. This is a classic dish you'll go back to again and again.

This has wonderful flavor and is super easy! My 4 yr old (picky eater) and hubby gobbled it down.  I do recommend covering it with aluminum foil for the first 30 minutes to keep moisture in.  I think next time I will make more marinade for dipping by just heating it up in the microwave or on the stove top.

Sorry, I really did not care for this one.  I doubled the recipe since I had four large pork chops to cover and most of the reviews mentioned the recipe should be doubled.  The ketchup flavor really overpowered the marinade, and ketchup is the last thing I want to put on my pork chops, perhaps it would have been better with a BBQ sauce?

These were good but I probably won't make them again.  The sauce is kind of like a barbecue but I wasn't crazy about it.  We did use boneless chops so they only took 20 minutes in the oven.  Thanks for the recipe.

As the others suggested, I tripled the sauce but I omitted the oil. Let the 3 boneless, thick pork chops marinated for 9 hours. Baked them at 350. After 30 mins., they weren't cooked. Up'd the temp to 425 and cooked them for another 15 mins., turning them over. Then broiled them for 5 mins. My family loved them. The sauce was sweet and poured it over rice. Almost tasted like a Hawaiian teriyaki sauce. Nice change of pace. Thanks.

Well this was a hit. I used boneless pork chops and it turned out delicious. I doubled the sauce and used every bit of it. The final product was pork chops with a nice layer of sauce, and there were no leftovers! Thanks for a wonderful recipe, I could eat this every day :)

This is very good.  It's similar to my normal 'go-to' pork chop recipe.  However that recipe calls for beer which I didn't have so I decided to try this.  The sauce is awesome and goes great over rice or mashed potatoes.  I used only 3 chops but still made the same amount of sauce and it was perfect.  However I only baked my chops for 30 minutes total.  They were bone-in and about 3/4 inch thick.  They weren't the most tender, but they weren't tough either.  I will definitely use this sauce recipe again but I will either do the chops in the slow cooker or sear them for a couple minutes on each side them simmer them on low in the sauce for about an hour or so.  This always produces very tender chops!

I seasoned the chops with salt, pepper & garlic before adding the sauce.  Didn't have any soy so just skipped it - added a tablespoon of sweet chili sauce for some sweetness.  This has a good flavor but there is way too much vegetable oil in it for my liking, I will cut that down next time and quadruple the sauce because I still could have used more. One hour was too long for the thinner cut boneless chops that I had but it still tasted good. Update 5/2/11 - Used this same arrangement on chicken breasts, letting them marinate for 2 days, it was excellent! I would advise pounding them down a little so the flavor can seep in better. We will use this again. Thank you!

Delicious! I didn't have worcester or teriyaki so had to make do with extra soy. Added honey too w/the brown sugar. I generally don't like ketchup in my sauces or dishes but this time it was delicious. I also made extra marinade and I cooked only 3 pork chops, not six.

I marinated 6 boneless 1" chops in triple the amount of marinate for 27 hours, much longer than intended! The chops were the best;  moist, tender and delicious! Seriously could be cut with a fork. Baked covered for 20 min, uncovered for 15- perfect! Double amount of sauce would've been plenty though, even for the rice I served with it.

I'm not sure what I could have done wrong, it was a simple recipe but it was awful! The pork was tough and chewy so not sure I want to try it again and ruin more pork chops. The majority of the reviews were so good that I gave it a try but ... yuk! What a disappointment.

Tasty flavours that compliment the pork, but overall a bit greasy. I will try again with leaner chops and uncover under broiler for last 5 minutes as suggested in other reviews.

The marinade was pretty good. The recipe didn't specify but, I would recommend using a thick  pork chop. Mine were thin. They were well done (and bone dry) after baking for 30 minutes.

Some of the best pork chops I've made.  I tripled the sauce (except the veg oil which I only upped to 3 Tbsp) and used about 1/2 of it to marinate them for about 8 hours.  I then baked the chops for 30 mins covered, dumped the juice/sauce, flipped the chops and brushed them with more sauce. I cooked for 20 more mins on the second side, then added more sauce and broiled for 2 mins.  Flipped again, added the last of the sauce and broiled for 2 mins on the other side.  They came out perfect- moist, flavorful and juicy.

I didn't quite like the sauce on this. I thought the ketchup and lemon over powered it. I'd use less of these if I were to make this again.

Well, this was just ok for my family.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I tripled the sauce and added onion pwd and S&P.  The sauce tasted like the ketchup mixture I put on top of my meatloaf (ketchup, b.sugar, worchestire...yep!) I had high hopes due to the high ratings and large # of reviews, but I won't make these again.

Tasty recipe, however 60 minutes at 350 produces shoe leather! 30 minutes, tops but sear them first in a hot pan briefly to seal the juices.

This was simple, but delicious. I added some minced garlic to the sauce and it turned out amazing. It was just the right blend of flavors.

Used 4 boneless pork chops, doubled the marinade.  Used all marinade at once (covered the chops).  Baked covered @ 350 for 25 mins, uncovered and broiled for the last 5.  They were great!

Very tasty!  Because it was the fall season, I added apple slices to the top and caramelized onions to the tops of the pork chops.  I followed the recipe as it is, and marinated the pork for about an hour.  What a super super super marinade.  Thank you for sharing!

very good I tripled the sauce and made with a side of white rice and broccoli. The next day I used the leftovers to make pork fried rice~so good. Just saute onions in a large skillet add frozen peas and carrots add cubed pork leftover rice and a few  dashes of soy sauce. Will definitely make again.

Yum Yum!! We have just finished eating this for dinner and it was delish. My 3 year old ate all of hers then tucked into mine!  The only change I made was to use sesame oil instead of the veggie oil.

Good and simple recipe.  Very easy too.  It made plenty of "juice" without doubling the recipe.  I used boneless chops- they don't need to cook as long.

I did not like baked pork chops until I tried this recipe. The chops were very moist and had so much flavor. I also added onions, oregano, paprika, garlic, and pepper. I will definitely recommend this recipe to others! My side dishes were black beans/rice & asparagus. A great meal.

I thought that the flavor was great. I would definitely recommend not using near as much oil as the recipe calls for. I used boneless pork chops, about 3/4 inch thick. They cooked perfectly in a half hour. I will make it again.

These pork chops were a fantastic deviation from the usual. Super super easy to do with a knock-out flavor. I did make some little variations - evoo instead of vegetable oil. That and make HUGE batches of the sauce. I use as recommended for 2 chops, and thats stretching it. The other thing I like to do is allow the chops to marinade. Preferably overnight, but at least a few hours...

Delicious!  Doubled the sauce for 4  one inch thick chops, but left the oil at 2T.  Covered it with foil for all but the last 20 minutes of cooking.  I really thought this was going to be too tangy, too salty, too thin or too sweet but it was a balanced savory-sweet flavor everyone loved.

VERY tasty sauce.  I am only giving it 4 stars because the recommended cooking times were way off for me... the chops came out really tough and dry.  Next time I will try cooking for half the recommended time, but adding a broil at the end in order to get the sauce nice and caramelized on top.

I would give this recipe 10 stars of I could!  It was sooo good!  I was so worried the pork chops would be dry but that wasn't the case at all - so juicy and tender.  I followed the recipe with no changes except that I doubled the sauce (used 4 boneless pork chops) and sprinkled them with garlic powder first.  I baked them for 20 min covered, flipped them and baked them for 20 more min uncovered.  I broiled them the last 4 or 5 min and they were perfect.  Whenever I make a new recipe, I ask my husband to rate it from 1-10.  He said these were most definitely a 10.  I can't wait to make them again!  Thanks for a great recipe :-)

We liked this recipe as written, then I made it again with a few changes.  My husband isn't fond of soy sauce, so I used an old trick - dilute the soy sauce with water 1:1.  You still get plenty of flavour but cut the salt.  I quadrupled the sauce (but kept the oil to 2 tbsp.), then added 1/2 tsp. oinion powder and 1/4 tsp. garlic powder.  When I asked my husband if he would eat this again, I got an umhm and a nod, but only because his mouth was full.  Thanks so much for the post.  I can hardly wait to try this with chicken, shrimp....

Maybe I'm not a huge fan of pork but I followed this recipe to the letter and I was not impressed and none of us cared for it.  It seems like all of the flavors went out of their way to highlight the porkyness of the porky taste.  If you are not a fan of the pork flavor this recipe is not for you.

These were amazing. I've never made pork chops before, but they came out great. I did add some paprika, diced onion, garlic, and vinegar to the mix, and marinated the pork chops for 4 hours before baking. The meat came out super tender and my husband said that it even made the fatty part edible. I would recommend lining the baking dish with some foil for easy cleanup, though.

I made these last night. The sauce is delicious! Before making them I read a few of the reviews and made a couple of the suggested modifications. I too tripled the sauce, sprinkled garlic salt on the pork before adding the sauce and also covered them with foil for the first 30 minutes. Pouring the extra sauce over brown rice was very tasty too! I will be making these again!

These were excellent!!!  We have 5 kids, so the chances of making something everyone loves is actually quite slim, but these chops had everyone begging for more!  
I followed the others' advice and marinated the chops right in the glass baking pan for 1.5 hrs in the fridge, then set the pan on the counter to warm up while preheating the oven. I just covered it, put the whole thing in the oven for an hour, flipping the chops mid way, and uncovering it for the last 10 mins. and they were soooo tender and flavorful!  I quadrupled the sauce mix and served it on the side and on top for the kiddos to dip in.  I would agree that if you want the sauce to be more like a glaze, a flash broil should do it nicely (if you add more brown sugar, tho, watch it in the oven as the sauce started to get crusty on the edges and would probably burn concidering how sugar behaves). Lastly, as I had no lemon juice or soy sauce on hand, I used a generous amount of lemon pepper seasoning and about a tsp of apple cider vinegar, and a little kikkoman marinade instead of soy.  Excellent dish and thank you!!!

It was okay.  My husband said it was really good.  I thought it was okay.  My 8-year old didn't really make much mention either way, but she did eat it.  As usual, my 5-year old took some prodding to eat.  
It was fast, easy, and I had all the ingredients on hand.  I wouldn't make again though unless I needed something for dinner and that's what I had on hand.

Very easy and very good. This was a great quick recipe for a weekday meal. My husband and toddler both loved it. These chops are also good cooked on the grill.

What a surprise.  I tried the sauce after I put the chops in the oven and wondered if we would eat them.  We love them.  Definitely will keep this recipe.

I made this dish today and it didn't turn out too well. I followed the recipe exactly and found the sauce was only enough for 4 chops. I baked the chops for 1 hour as directed by the recipe. My chops turned out to be overcooked and way too dry. I really like the flavor of the sauce, but also found that the flavor didn't really get into the chops. Next time I'll try to marinate the chops first and bake it for shorter time.

Excellent recipe!  My husband and two small boys LOVED this.  I made it exactly as directed, but baked at 375 for 15 mins on each side and finished off on broil(like someone else suggested).  Next time I make this I will marinate the chops in the sauce for a day to get the flavor inside.  Highly recommend this recipe to all.

I made this tonight and I followed the recipe exactly.  After I stuck it in the oven I really hoped that my husband would like the dish because it was sooo easy that I would like to make it again.

He loved it! And he thinks that this recipe should be renamed, Delicious Pork Chops. I love to find new easy recipes and this one is definately a keeper at our house.

I was very dissapointed with this. Especially with other reviewers high ratings. The flavor was not good. My husband thought they were okay which is why I am giving it three stars. I like all of those ingrediants, but not like this. Will not make this again.

Pretty good!  I added minced garlic, an onion, and a sliced red pepper.  I decresed the brown sugar a little and marinated overnight.  It was yummy, but next time I will make more sauce and decrease the cooking time to about 20 minutes on each side.

I was expecting better with all the rave reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly but the pork chops were very dry.  My family wasnt impressed.  I gave this 4 stars because the flavor was good, and I am giving the recipe the benefit of the doubt...  maybe I bought bad/tough cuts of pork??

This is one of my very favs.  I put this marinade on pork, chicken & beef, and it tastes awesome on all.  Watch it carefully on the grill though, the sugar in marinade tends to make meat burn very easily.  I tried putting meat and marinade in baking pan, and just putting the whole thing on the grill rack- this worked better, and didn't burn. Try chicken wing dings in this too! Cook wing dings in 13x9 on grill rack until sauce thickens, watch closely at this point, as sauce will go from thick and yummy to burnt and disgusting in minutes. You can't go wrong with this one.

The whole family enjoyed these (even the 6 yo, 4 yo and 2 yo!).  I used Splenda instead of the brown sugar.  Doubled the recipe and baked less than the stated time as I had very thin chops.  Going to try it on a pork roast tomorrow night.

Cut oil in half and added garlic like another person suggested.  Also tripled the recipe to allow for extra juice and served over brown rice.  Entire family loved it.

This was a very nice variation for pork chops.  I doubled the marinade and made 4 chops with it.  Like others, I drained the pan before adding the second batch of marinade to the pan.  Baked pork chops have a tendency to be dry, but these were tangy and very moist.  My kids loved them.

Was delicious, my whole family loved it. It was really easy to make, I actually made the sauce without measuring anything and then I threw the chops into the bowl with the sauce this morning in the refrigerator until I was ready to make dinner.  Sauce was perfect, meat was cooked all the way through and not too dry. I covered it with more foil for the first 30 minutes then removed it.

I love this easy recipe! It's the right amount of sweet and tangy.  It would be a great recipe to incorporate any kind of meat.  Next time, I'll add some flour to make the sauce a tad more thicker.  No substitutions necessary.  Simple ingredients make this dish one I'll repeat.

I'm 15, and I made this recipe for my family. It was easy, quick, and VERY enjoyable. Superb flavours. The only thing I changed was I added a diced onion and I added a bit more soya sauce as well as warchestershire. Fantastic, my mom was thoroughly impressed with it and me too!

Super delicious and easy! I followed the recommendations and doubled the recipe (or more accurately, used the full recipe for only 3 pork chops). I didn't trim the meat and I broiled the pork chops for the last 4 or so minutes and took them out about 5 minutes earlier. I found that timing to be perfect for the thickness of the chops I was working with, they came out very juicy. I made no other adjustments, but next time I will reduce the amount of oil and ketchup. Though the sauce is initially thick, it does thin out when baking. I poured out the extra liquid that had accumulated in the baking dish when I was flipping at the halfway point because I didn't want the meat to steam.

I made this using bone in pork chops, and used thermometer for temperature, it took 25 minutes covered with tinfoil, and five uncovered.  I doubled the ingredients and it was perfect for six bone in porkchops. I did not marinate, and they came out tender and flavorful/ the only change I made was adding chopped onion and garlic powder directly on the porkchops.  This was a hit with my husband and kids.

Very easy and tasty!  I did triple the sauce for 4 pork chops and added 2 tablespoons of minced garlic.  I did cover the pork chops for the first half of cooking the cooking time and then uncovered when I added the sauce for the second time.  Will be making again, ideal for a weeknight dinner and the flavor was great.

It was sooooo good. I added teryaki sauce to it. And i cooked it for about 20 minutes on one side flipped it over poured more sauce over and cooked for another 20. They were moist and delicious. It was not anywhere near enough sauce. U need way more of everything. Also i marinated this the night before. I baked five boneless chops thin cut. I made this with honey cornbread and broccoli. This was my first time making this i will definitely make again.

These pork chops are really good. I let the chops sit and marinate for a couple of hours before cooking them. Followed the recipe to a tee. When cooking them I only cooked them for 30-35 min covered at 350. One hour is tooooo much. I googled cooking time for pork chops most said 350 for 30-35 mins.___

As written I can only give this two stars. The sauce flavour was great, but 1hr is a bit long for most pork chops, at least the ones I've come across.The result was delicious pork chops that were dry and chewy from being overcooked. 

On the next try the cooking time will be greatly reduced. I'm sure with the tweaks it will be a star or two higher...

Today this was our first family meal in our new house. I was afraid how this recipe would turn out.. But, my kids and husband loved it. I even got asked by my 17 year old, did you save that recipe?! Oh so happy, thank you so much.

Excellent recipe! Our whole family really enjoyed these pork chops!
I needed to use the timed baking option on my stove because of our church schedule and it worked great! I did triple the recipe and it made for a very nice sauce on the rice. Well done! We will definitely use this recipe again!

The flavor of the sauce (which is not a marinade) is very good.  However, the recipe makes enough for two 1" chops, no more.  It would probably help to actually marinate them because my two chops were dry and not particularly tender.  I used bone-in chops because I prefer their flavor, but there is nothing extraordinary about these if the recipe is followed.  They will take some doctoring and perhaps covering for while in the oven to meet minimum expectations.

I'll double the sauce next time and cover it in the oven for half the time so the brown sugar doesn't burn, but other than that, superb. There were no leftovers.

Oh wow!!! We were iced in and I had everything cut up and ready to make pork chops with mushroom gravy (you know the one with cream of mushroom soup) and realized I didn't have any... so I tried this... my 3 year old who doesn't eat much at one time ate 2 and the ones I had were 1.5" thick! The ONLY thing I did different (and only because I already had it cut up) was add mushrooms, garlic and onions.I sauteed them with the second half of the marinade and put that on top for the last 20 minutes. I did dump out most of the stuff from the first half. Also, I strongly suggest at least doubling the recipe! I had 5 1.5" chops (thick but not bone in so kind of small) and I doubled it and had just enough to have some with on rice.

These pork chops were very good and surprisingly tender. Upon the advice of other reviewers, I doubled the quantity of sauce and reserved half of it for basting and for serving. I marinated the chops for 4 hours. It was baked for the first 30 minutes covered with foil. Then, uncovered for an additional 20 minutes, at which time I basted the chops the one time. It gave a beautiful caramelization to the meat. Everyone enjoyed it, even my really picky 7 year old. Thanks for a good recipe!

Made this last night.  After reading tons of reviews, I decided to omit the oil altogether.  I doubled the sauce, and used 3 large bone in chops for our family.  Marinated the chops with 1/2 the sauce for about 1.5 hrs.  Baked the chops in foil lined casserole dishes.  Clean up was a breeze!  Sauce thickened a bit in the oven.  Entire family devoured this! 

Keeper!  Will try on chicken next.

I thought that was really good. I made two batches of the sauce/marinade. one to marinate the pork chops in (maybe an hour?) and the other i used to baste while cooking. Really flavorful. My chops were about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick and cooked in about 30 minutes. My picky 11 yr old son who usually complains throughout dinner didn't say a word....well, i guess you can't talk when your mouth is stuffed.

This is absolutely delicious and has become a staple in our house. I triple the recipe(except for the vegetable oil) and that makes enough sauce to cover the pork and a little left over for those, like my husband, who like tons of sauce. I season my meat with garlic salt and black pepper, pour this sauce over the meat, throw in sliced onions and peeled garlic and it comes out perfect every time.

Was really really good. Next time I will marinate all day so that they will be more tender. It was a little dry for me cause I have to have very moist meat due to stomach removal. But...again.... Very good and will be making this again. Thanks

We all loved this except my 4 year old granddaughter who thought they were too spicy. The chops were super tender. I made a double batch of sauce and marinaded the chops overnight. I will also try this on chicken.

I used this recipe for two boneless chops. If you are making 6 chops you will need to at least triple the sauce amount in the recipe. Also, I added a teaspoon of liquid smoke and they came out wonderful! I will definitely make this again!

This is a 5 star IF you triple the sauce, add 2 cloves of minced garlic and a touch of ginger, marinate the chops in 1/2 the sauce for a couple of hours, and reduce the cooking time by almost 1/2. Also great for chicken (cook full amountof time).

Not bad for porkchops. I always find it hard to give pork chops flavor. The sauce needs to be a little thicker at the end to stay with the meat. I also added pineapple to the top of the pork while it was cooking for more flavor!

Just put these in the oven and they already smell delicious, the sauce alone smelled delicious. The only thing i did different was add some spices and crushed up garlic to the sauce. Also took the advice of adding onions to the pan and covering it with foil. Even though its not done yet i can already tell this is a recipe i will use again and again! Thanks!

My family loved this dish.  I doubled the sauce and served with rice.  My family wanted to eat the sauce out of the pan when all the pork chops were gone.  I think next time I will cook at 325 for 90 minutes to make them even more tender.  Overall a very yummy dish indeed!

These were very good.  The came out a little dry, so I will cut the cooking time down to 30 minutes total the next time I make them.

My husband and I both loved this recipe! I made it exactly as written and we both thought all the ingredients in the sauce really shined. Thank you Kim!  I'm putting this in my keeper file!

NOTHING like the recipe had me thinking it would be. To begin with, it was tough as leather. That could be bad cuts from the meat guy. I tenderized it with a meat pounder but no luck. Worse than that is how it had almost no flavor. My friend said it tastes like Spam. I almost agree. The first layer of marinade mix cooked off as soon as I flipped the meat to do the second side. I love pork chops! But I have to say these were the worst, most un-flavorful ones I've ever made and I've been making them 20+ years! Use this recipe at your own risk.

Doubled marinade for 4 chops but used only 1 Tbsp. oil, 1 tsp. cider vinegar in place of lemon juice and added 1 tsp stone ground mustard with horseradish.  Marinated a couple of hours. Drained and reserved juices (to serve over rice) at 30 minutes before coating with remaining sauce, cooked remaining time uncovered.  Very good.  Cook less time if chops are less than one 3/4-1 inch thick.

Yummy! Will definitely make again. Make sure to cook in glass pan so the juice stays "juicy". Also, coated heavily with salt and pepper and minced garlic before basting in marinade.

We love this recipe!  So easy and quick and no chopping involved--you just dump the ingredients.  The only thing we do differently is grill the pork chops instead of baking them.  In this case, I double (or even triple) the recipe and marinate them for a few hours before.

I loved thia recipe because it was simple, and took little time to prep and prepare. The added bonus was how tender and juicy the chops were. The sauce will become a staple for my chicken too!

Turned out great! I did let it brine in the sauce for a few hours before I baked it, which was wonderful! Also, the sauce is definitely not enough, it needs to be doubled.

These pork chops turned out tender and juicy.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  I prepared the marinade in a Ziploc bag and placed the pork chops in the bag, then let it sit for @ 2 hours.  I also cooked them at 425 for 30 minutes.

We were very disappointed in this dish.  I scaled it back for two portions -- other than that, I made it exactly as the recipe specified.  For one thing, there was very little sauce.  (If you plan to make this for two people, I'd make the amount of sauce shown here for six people.)  As a result, there wasn't much flavor.  The worst part, however, was how tough the chops were!  I always buy bone-in, THICK-cut pork chops and usually they are very tender and juicy.  These were juicy, but as tough as shoe leather!  I strongly suggest using some sort of meat tenderizer on these, if you plan to make them.  I, for one, will not be making this dish again.

Absolutely on POINT! I did them on the grill and they were to die for. Marinade for 24 hours in advance and use the remaining sauce to brush. I also Tripled the recipe for 8 chops and added 3 tbs of vinegar and a tablespoon of garlic powder.

Very tasty and very easy. I used boneless pork chops. It comes out as a bbq type sauce that I'm sure would taste great on chicken too. The only change I made was using canola oil insteal of veg. I also used a little less oil than asked for to make it a bit healthier.  I used a meat thermometer and it was ready in about 40 min rather than the 60min in the recipe. The recipe doesn't make that much sauce, so I recommend doubling it.

Made this last night with some salad and my wife and I both loved it! Pork chops were juicy and delicious. I couldn't wait for lunch leftovers today. I did add one half of a yellow onion (chopped) and a cup of beer but Kim's recipe is really what gives it those outstanding flavors. I will make this one again for sure.

Needed some more for flavor, and it should be suggested that the juice be drained.  Once I realized my mistakes and readjusted, it came out good.  I should have read the previous reviews and used some of tips.  I would try this again.

Great marinade but I made a few changes. I let the chops marinade for 10 hrs and then cooked at 375 for 45 min covered. Like others suggested, I broiled them for about 5 minutes at the end. I actually had 3 thick boneless chops so I made about triple the amount of sauce, but actually only tripled a few of the ingredients. I kept the ketchup at 2 tbsp, used 3 tbsp of Teriyaki, 1 tsp of oil, 6 tbsp of brown sugar, 2 tbsp of Worcestershire and 2 tbsp of lemon juice. YUMMM!

I loved the marinade! I added diced onion and garlic to it and didn't have lemon juice on hand so that was left out. When I make this again I'll be doubling the sauce because everyone wanted more of it.

It was also great with the bite size crispy potatoes I served with the chops.

The sauce is yummy but like others mentioned, double sauce and next time I'll eliminate or reduce the vegetable oil.  Broiling the last 5 minutes was an excellent tip.

I made these by mistake...and it was a big mistake!  Do yourself a favor and make Marinated Pork Chops submitted by Jean Neitzel, they are a million times better than these!  I don't know how this recipe has the rating it has, chops are edible, but by no means good.

I've made these twice now, and both times, they were a hit with the family.  I made a few changes last time that made the original recipe even better.  I reduced the oil by half and doubled the remaining marinade ingredients.  I marinated the chops for a few hours in half of the mixture, and basted them with the other half during baking.  At the end of the cooking time, I turned on the broiler to thicken the sauce.  (Otherwise, it will slide off the chops.)

Loved it! A definite repeat! But you need to probably triple the sauce for 6 chops. I only cooked 2 and had enough sauce for maybe one other one. Also, 1 hour is WAY to long. Next time I will check other web sites to see the recommended time for cooking chops.

I like these. I thought they were good in a pinch... not my favorite, but I would make them again. I did as others suggested and omitted the ketchup and used BBQ sauce, I chopped onions, sliced some garlic and sprinkled them on top of the chops. This is how I suggest making them.

These pork chops are soooo good!  Unfortunately, I have a tendency to dry meat out.  I like this recipe because it doesn't rely on adding canned soup for moist chops, as this usually adds unwanted calories and fat.  This is a great recipe that I will make over and over again!

I don't like pork chops, but these were delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except that I used 3 pork chops instead of 6 (There was a little extra sauce but that was just like an added bonus). We had these with rice pilaf and corn on the cob. Perfect summer dinner. Mmm.

Eh... it was just ok.  I was expecting more flavor.  I think had I tried broiling them at the end that would have helped.  Also, truly marinating would give more flavor.

Very good.  I added chopped onion to the sauce.  Also, the amounts called for in this recipe were just enough for 3 pork chops (although I could have used more).  If making 6 chops, I'd double (or triple!) the quantities.  
I followed others' suggestions and covered the dish with foil.

These were super easy and turned out very tasty.  I tripled the sauce, it did seem to me that it was too much oil, I will probably change that next time.

This was an XCELLENT recipe. i had all the ingredients on-hand.  What's even better was that my one son is is 20 years old and is very vwry picky. My other 22 yr old. just told me to throw seasoned salt on the boneless chops as he had done working in various restaurants and told him to give this recipe a chance. I. myself am not to eat meats due to surgery but these chops came out so TENDER & JUICY I had NO PROBLEM EATING THE CUT-UP pieces.  The recipe was also easy to memorize!  Our official meat marinade!

I don't know why this recipe got such good ratings, there is nothing special about it. I used loin chops and maybe they didn't have enough fat, but the sauce wasn't as good as bottled barbeque sauce. I won't bother saving this recipe!

I made this tonight for dinner, and it was SUPERB!  I didn’t change a thing, just added a little season salt and pepper to the pork chops, before pouring the sauce over them to bake.  I will be keeping this recipe to make this again, and again. Thanks!

Turned out great! I did not have worcestershire sauce, so I just added a bit more oil and a bit more soy. Was very delicious. Next time will have to pick up worcestershire to try it as it's meant to be :)

My four year old grandson, who is a picky eater extraordinaire, asked for seconds!

I did quadruple the sauce however, as my family loves their sauce!

My family really enjoyed sauce recipe, just be careful NOT to follow cooking directions.  Pork chops will be done closer to around 30 minutes.  Next time I would reduce oil.

This recipe was ok...It wasn't the best pork chop I've ever had, but it certainly wasn't the worst. I marinated the chops for about 5 hours and they were good...not great, but good. I don't have anything really negative to say about this recipe, but it was a simple recipe that used ingredients I already had on hand. And the pork chops turned out pretty tender and were pretty good. Thanks for the recipe!

Marinate was easy to prepare and delicious .. I left out the lemon juice only because I didn'thave any on hand but felt after tasting the sauce that there was no need for it. I had used a baking dish as suggested but it prevented the pork chops from browning and marinated to adhear to meat so half way throught the cooking process I replace the baking dish with a cookie sheet. I also turned up the heat of the oven  from 350 to 375 .. which helped in the browning process .. will make again but may go up  a few degrees more on the oven ..

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  The only changes/additions I made: added a bit of diced onion, used all the sauce on only two chops, and reduced the cooking temp to 325 for 40min (for two double cut boneless chops).  

Excellent recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This glaze is wonderful! Nice that everything is on hand and it makes the chops so tender, almost buttery.  I didn't change a thing & can't wait to try it on chicken.  This is definitely a 'keeper'!

It was okay. I did double the sauce and used sesame oil instead of veg oil. Next time I will only use 2 tbsp oil and double everything else EXCEPT the sugar... it was way too sweet. I added Cayanne and Red Pepper and more acid to balancethe sweetness and it helped but it was too much sugar. I also cooked it covered for 30 minutes then uncovered and broiled 3-4 minutes on each side. It adds a nice glaze and a good crisp to it. I will still add the extra spice next time. I served with rice and squash and it came out decent. I will try this again with the changes I mentioned. Worth trying!

Nice flavor! Easy recipe! Like the others, double the recipe. I added a couple cloves of garlic. Also, I marinated the chops in the refrigerator for several hours.

this was excellent,  I let it marinate a few hours before cooking  and I also cut cooking time to 15 min  then basted & flipped for another 15,  broiled last 3 min  or so just to make the sauce  al ittle thicker  Excellent  -  used left over sauce on a roast the next night - very good

Amazing flavor! A Tablespoon of Dijon took it over the top for me. Similar to a sauce I grew up with as a child - this blew it away. Easy, refrigerator door dinner. Enjoy.

My new favorite for Pork Chops.  I loved that they were so easy to prepare using ingredients that I always have on hand.  Tasted great, and my husband loved them too.  I doubled the sauce because it didnt' seem to make much as listed, and I added a clove of garlic, finely chopped to it. I tend to add garlic to most things...

We tried this recipe exactly as written, with exception of cooking time, and found it to be quite bland. I like the base flavors, but next time I will omit most of the oil (it's not needed and it mutes the other flavors), add mustard and some herbs, perhaps rosemary.  Cooking time, in my opinion, is too long for today's pork. I used 1" thick, bone-in chops, and cooked for 40 minutes and let stand for 5.

I marinated in the sauce for half the day and added minced garlic.  I covered in foil for the first 30 minuted and then poured out the liquid.  i made a double batch of the sauce with minced garlic and diced onions in it put on the chops.  I put back in for 15 minutes uncovered.  I then broiled them for another 5 minutes.  My kids who are picky eaters ate them up.  will be making them again

A quick, easy & yummy way to prepare pork chops.  Made the sauce exactly as written, but instead of turning the chops half way through cooking, I just douse them with all the sauce & cook for a straight hour.

This was SOOO good.  I took others advice and I added minced garlic and I tripled the recipe for the sauce. I cooked fo 30 minutes added the rest of sauce and then cooked for 20 min. It made quite a bit of sauce, but I think the extra sauce in the pan kept the chops moist!!  Delicious!

I wasn't sure how the ingredients were going to marry together but this was acutally quite good - it taste like a thinner, yummier version of BBQ shake and bake.  My modifications:  1.) definitely DOUBLE THE SAUCE.  2.)  I seasoned my chops with salt, pepper and garlic salt and then covered them in the marinade.  3.)  I only baked them for 35 minutes...any longer and they would have been dry and tough.    Definitely a keeper in our house!

This is by far my family's favorite marinade! Whenever we can't think of something to have for dinner, this is our go to recipe. I always double the marinade, so once the chops are cooked we have enough to pour over our egg noodles. Quick, easy, and amazing flavor!!

Delicious. Nicely sweet. I made only 3 pork chops but made the sauce as if for 6. I covered for the first 30 minutes. No other changes, and it is a keeper for my family.

was just ok.  I didn't have lemon so I used lime.  But other than that, I made it as it.    am sure it would be better with thin pork chops.  was nice and easy though..

Delicious! Really makes any type of pork chops juicy and flavourful. I've used the recipe on bone in and boneless chops! I also always make a bit of extra sauce so that we can dip the chops in it or drizzle some over the top.

My boyfriend loved this. I think I'll try marinating the meat overnight before when I try again. Previous suggestions that I took up were: Half the oil, teriyaki sauce instead of soy, and a sprinkle of garlic into the sauce.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe. I Have to triple the sauce for 4 pork chops, so make accordingly. I followed everything, but half was through I drained the liquid, flipped, rebated, and continued cooking. Once they were almost done I basted one last time and set to broil for a few minutes until they had a bubbly dark-from-the-liquid top.

These were indeed pretty good, the marinade was simple to prepare, i had all of the ingredients here..which is always a bonus. Last but not least the meat was moist.  I did only rate 3 stars because the marinade only added a little really- next time i would try marinading for the day or a couple hourse to see if the flavors go through the meat! thanks for sharing

The only reason this is a 4 star instead of 5 is because the cook time is excessive.  Based on other reviews, I doubled the sauce and reduced the cook time to 45 minutes.  The pork chops have great flavor (I love the marinade!), but are quite tough.  Next time, I'll cook them for 30 minutes, max.  There will definitely be a "next time", though!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

amazing flavor. everyone in the family loves them. I pour all the sauce over the chops before baking an don't flip them. This allows the sauce on the chops to thicken a little and not slide off when serving.

Very good!  I did make a couple of changes based on suggestions from the other reviewers --- added a touch of sesame oil and a dash of garlic salt.  The sauce was enough for 3 pork chops, but I do think that 6 would need to be doubled.  Was very tender and flavorful though --- and quick!!

Very delicious and very easy. I did make extra sauce as suggested and served over brown rice. I didn't have any brown sugar so I used honey. I also added some crushed red pepper sauce for heat and some garlic powder. Delicious! My husband and I both loved it and I will be making this again. Thank you for the recipe!

I followed the recipe for the sauce, temperature and time. I used four very thick boneless pork chops - probably 1-1/2 to 2 inches. After one hour, they were done just right. The flavor was good, but not overpowering. One hour was perfect for THICK chops. I think some of the reviewers that reported dry and overcooked were likely using a thinner chop that would cook faster. We did eat with a side of our favorite bbq. sauce to dip bites into. Oh yes, the chops were very moist. I'll be making again - Thanks!

This is really good.  But I did add my own personal touch.  I added another tablespoon of ketchup, and brown sugar.  Then I added a small jar of peach jam and an envelope of onion soup mix.  Mix it all together, pour on top of the chops or pork steaks.  Bake as suggested or till tender.  And you got some good eats.  I would say this is may be good with chicken too.  Thanks Kim for the submission.  I love this website.

We grill out almost every night during the summer and last night was no exception.  Although this recipe instructs you to bake the chops, I knew these could be successfully done on the grill.  The sauce was a snap to make, calling for ingredients most everyone would have on hand in their pantry.  I made the full amount of sauce for two huge bone-in chops.  I divided the marinade into three parts.  I marinated the chops in one part.  Hubs used another to baste on while grilling, and lastly, the third part was used to drizzle over the chops at the table.  These came off the grill looking BEAUTIFUL, in fact I would go as far as to say, grilling them enhanced their appearance and flavor, something you wouldn’t get if using the oven method.  These were very tasty and something that we’ll definitely be making again and I can see using this marinade/sauce on chicken as well.  Grill or oven, summer or winter, give these a try!!!  UPDATE 1/31/13:  I made these again, but because it’s too cold to grill I did them in the oven this time.  I think I prefer these grilled, but doing them in the oven works well too.  I put half the sauce on top of each chop, baked for 15 minutes.  Flipped over and put the other half of the sauce on and baked another 15 minutes.  I did pop them under the broiler for just a short time to caramelize the sauce on top.  Great recipe!

I added all the ingredients listed but added a little too much lemon juice by mistake but it was still tasty, just a little tangy. I marinaded as others suggested but only for 1 hour, didn't have more time.  After the first 30 mins of cooking my pan was full of juice which diluted the sauce.  What a waste!  The second 30 mins I cooked on a rack with the remaining sauce.  Should have cooked maybe only 15 mins more as the chops were a little dry.  My husband gave them 8 out of 10 so I gave them 4 stars, which is probably a very generous rating.  Will probably make again.

VERY GOOD!  I doubled the sauce and served rice with this dish.  Hubby and I both enjoyed the flavor.  I had mine on top of the rice and Hubby had his rice on the side.  I will be making this again.  Thank you Kim for sharing this VERY GOOD recipe!

Very Flavorful!!! I l let this marinate overnight and only used 2 pork chops for the full amount of sauce, so definitely double or triple it if you are using more than two! I baked in the oven for 15 minutes and then broiled the last 5 (my chops were very thin)! Will probably make again.

I enjoyed the sauce, but I think it would work best with a different cooking method such as grilling.  Baking the chops causes a lot of the sauce to drip off during cooking.

This recipe is fantastic.  I had to triple the sauce recipe for it, but still followed the recipe directions exactly.  These porkchops have an array of wonderful flavors in every bite.  First you have the tangyness from the ketchup.  Then the slightly sour taste from the lemon, the sweetness from the brownsugar, and with all of that together, it is delicious.  My fiance is a fried porkchop lover, but I have never seen him mmmm ohhhh and ahhh over porckchops as he did these.  Fantastic, 5 stars, will be making again

Fantastic recipe!!  The flavor of this (without actually marinating the chops) was excellent.  I also used it on chicken (doubling the batch both times for extra sauce) and marinated it for a day and a half and OMG it was so great.  I mixed cornstarch and water into the remaining sauce and boiled for a couple minutes and drizzled it over the top... yum!!  Thanks for sharing!

These were great. I used 3 pork chops about 1.5 inches thick and they cooked in about 30 mins.  I marinated them about 4 hours before cooking, and left out the brown sugar because i didnt have any. My husband and 6yr old thought they were good.  I didn't eat them, as i do not eat things that come from a pig.  Great recipe and will usemarinade again for grilling this summer. Thanks

My family really enjoyed these.  Used Hot Garlic Chili Sauce in place of the ketchup for added flavor and Rice Wine Vinegar instead of lemon juice because it seemed to make more sense, didn't add any oil as it seemed unnecessary.  We tripled the sauce for 6 chops, covered the pan and broiled at the last couple minutes as suggested. These were probably the most moist chops I have ever eaten.  Unbelievably good.

Very good but I also made a few changes the second time around.  I had to double the recipe for 4 pork chops.  I omitted the oil, added 2 tbsp of OJ in place of lemon juice (what I had on hand) doubled the ketchup(4 tbsp) and added appx 2 tbsp of bbq sauce as well.  I don't measure so these are just eyeballed.  Next time I might skip the brown sugar as well since the bbq and ketchup should add enough sweetness.

Please don't be fooled by the simplicity of the ingredients. This is impressive as is, I urge you to try it as written first. I needed quick meals to make for the elderly couple downstairs after the Mrs got out of the hospital.  I saw this and said "what could be simpler". I am truly not a huge pork fan. I used pork steaks. I trippled the sauce using proportion as stated. I did add 1T finely chopped onion and slivered sun dried tomato's, (the bagged kind, not oil packed) poured half into the glass dish and poured the other half over the tops and sides of the steaks. I put all in the fridge for a couple hours, to help the meat absorb more flavor. then put it in the oven. You could smell this all the way down the hall of my condo. Amazing! My steaks were about 3/4" thick and came out tender and perfect. The sauce is thinner but stirred and drizzled over garlic mashed potato's made it the perfect meal for a snowy 12 degree evening. I am making this again tomorrow for my daughter's family using boneless pork ribs! I cannot wait. I baked them at 375 for about 30 minutes..done to perfection. I am really looking forward to trying on chicken.
**UPDATE** When making this again, I used the Lea & Perrins "Thick Style" Worcestershire, it helped it to cling more to the meat and gave the sauce a bit more body.

Great marinade.  Followed recipe except use 1 tbls of sesame oil instead of 2 tbls of oil.  Let it marinate for an hour.  Used two 1.5" inch porkchops @ 375 degrees, 15 minutes per side, basting with 2nd half of marinade after turning.   Broiled for 5 minutes and let it rest for 10.  Hubbie and I liked it very much and plan to make it again.

Made as directed. They were good and I'll probably make them again.. or maybe marinate some chicken in the sauce and do kabobs.

This was quick and really easy to make.  My only complant is that if you cook it for the whole time stated in the recipe the porkchops will be dried out.  We had thick Butterfly porkchops and I feel that 40 mins would be plenty of time.

The marinade is delicious! The only thing I change is using pork blade steaks instead of pork chops, but that's just our meat preference.  The recipe amount is perfect for 2 pork steaks.  You'll want to double the sauce for sure if serving over rice! I let the pork steaks marinate w/ the sauce in the fridge for at least 3-4 hours before baking.  If I feel like it, I'll throw a clove or two of minced garlic in with the marinade.  I just baste with it's own cooking juices from the baking dish as there is always enough to do so. Cooking time for pork steaks is about 45 minutes at 375 degrees, turning once halfway through. They always come out a beautiful color and always very tender.  Leftovers are always even better the next day!  Thanks for this recipe!  :)

After reading several reviews I decided to take some suggestions. I made this using 4 bone in chops, so to make sure I had enough sauce to put on the rice I tripled the recipe with the following changes: 1) 2 tbs olive oil 2) 3 tsp white vinegar instead of lemon juice 3) 3 tbs orange juice (could have added 1/4 c) 4) 3 cloves garlic chopped (would add more next time, my family loves garlic) 5) 1-2 tsp red pepper flakes I mixed the ingredients in a corningware dish and let it marinate for a few hours then cooked it at 350 for 15 minutes (covered) then flipped chops and cooked for and additional 10 minutes uncovered. I then broiled for for 3-5 minutes for a little char flavor. There was plenty of sauce for the rice and I could have actually added two more chops and had enough sauce. This recipe was a great base to jazz up several different ways. Thanks for all the inspiration!

I thought it was a wonderful marinade.  It gave the pork a lot of flavor.  I put some onion and red bell pepper on top while I baked them and they were a wonderful compliment to the meat.  I will also have to try it with chicken.

I'm not one who measures when cooking (unless baking) but I mixed all ingredients called for into a slightly thick sauce. Season salted and peppered chops then covered with sauce. Baked 20 mins covered with foil, uncovered fliped chops and baked another 20 min. The chops I used were thin. They turned out wonderful! My kid sister is 6 and picky, she ate a whole pork chop! Every one around the table was mmmm-mmmming :)

This was a good recipe, the only downside was not having a thicker sauce. I cooked covered for 30, then 20 uncovered, and finished off with broiling for a very short time. Although I made 2 chops, I used the recipe for 6 chops to make the sauce. It turned out really tender and delicious. I will definitely make this again considering the ingredients are always readily available.

Tried this recipe before realising we didn't have any ketchup... used tomato salsa instead. Didn't smell great when cooking, but tasted really good. Cooked 4 pork chops in this sauce in the slow cooker for 3 hours. Was really pleased with the result.

These were good; I did broil them for 5 minutes each side at the end. Seemed a touch dry, but I do prefer juicy meat. Tripled the sauce, and marinated it in the same sauce for the day before making them.

WOW  This is one of the best sauces I've had in awhile.  Did as recommended and tripled the yield. Also added garlic to the chops before adding the sauce.  Also marinated them for a couple hours.  Will DEFINITELY use again.

I have never posted a review before, but this recipe was so incredible, I couldn't resist. I 100% recommend this recipe - it is DELICIOUS!!! So easy too.
I did take someone's advice and added some minced onion. The flavor was incredible. Can't wait to try it on chicken next!!

This is a GREAT marinate, my husband and kids and I love it.  I use it almost every time we make pork chops, it's a great alternative to grilling. Plus my husband loves using the sauce on mashed potatoes or rice.

I tried this last night and it came out really good.I normally just bread some chops and throw them in the oven.This was a nice change.The only change I made was to quadruple the recipe as I wanted to marinate them before baking.

delicious. I doubled the sauce though. It made it like a bbq sauce but not as spicy. The sauce is very sweet but in a good way. I wanted to lick the pan. My husband helped himself to 3rds. Even my 3 year old ate a whole pork chop.

wanted something different to go on pork chops. i tried this and everyone else loved it, but i just thought it was okay. i guess the best way to explain how i felt about it was that i forgot i had even made this until i saw the name of it in my recipe box. not highly memorable for me.

This was good but way to sweet for my liking!! next time i will definitely 1/2 the brown sugar. I only rated it a 3 because i also changed it up quite a bit with some spice. Added some minced garlic and onions, a bit of cajun hot sauce, hoisin sauce, and some ginger! and i am SOOO glad i did!!

This turned out really good (best BBQ sauce I have ever made) but I'm gonna ding it a couple of stars for a couple of reasons. I don't know why it's called Marinated Baked Pork Chops when according to the recipe, you don't marinate the pork. I did (for about 12 hours) and the meat turned out super flavorful. Also, 60 minutes bake time for pork chops? Really? I did mine for 40 minutes (they were average thickness), and that was ample. Like I  say, the flavor was superb, but it wasn't quite right with pork chops. Next time I'll slow cook some pork tenderloin with the sauce in my crockpot, and shred it - it'll be awesome in sandwiches. Would work great with brisket too, I'm sure!

This was a really good marinate for pork chops.  I didn't measure the ingredients but it turned out good.  I only marinated my chops (very thin boneless) for 1/2 hr. and they had a great taste.  Next time I will marinate them longer.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was more like a barbeque sauce to me. I didn't much care for it, but thats not saying that I may have done something wrong in making it. The sauce didn't really seap into the porkchops as I thought it would based on the picture. =0

This was so easy and delicious!
I made the marinade and brushed it on both sides of the pork chops(gave them a few quick pokes first) and let it marinate in the frig for an hour or so before baking.
I served them with teryaki noodles by Knorr/Lipton.Great flavors together.

WOW! Im sitting here at the computer devouring my pork chops!!! I don't usually leave a lot of feed back on this site.. but I had to for this recipe.  It is scrumptious!!!! The only thing added was a little bit of minced garlic... and left out the lime juice.  I cooked the first 30 minutes covered and last 20 not! So good! Thanks for posting!

Very good!  I doubled the sauce as suggested except for the brown sugar(used 1.5 times). Cooked them just as the recipe stated. Served over brown rice with turnip greens.  Also mixed up some hot sauce like PF Chang's using spicy mustard, shredded horseradish, soy sauce & chile paste.  This was really good on the rice with the pork.  Next time I will make broccoli & carrots instead of turnip greens.  Awesome!

Delicious, although we made the sauce for a serving size of 6 to have extra, and used it for just two of us. Next time I would make extra sauce and marinate the chops longer for more taste.

This recipe was soooooo good! I used one pork chop and one piece of beef steak, and they were equally as awesome. Only change I made was using kecap manis instead of soy sauce (all I had), which may have made it a tad sweeter than usual. I'll definitely be making this ALOT. Thank you!

This was delicious and so fast! I sprinkled garlic salt on the chops before putting the sauce on. I also doubled the sauce recipe for 4 small pork chops and it was the perfect amount! My boyfriend loved it and I am going to try it on chicken next time. Thanks for the great recipe!

We had mixed reviews in our house. I personally liked them and will keep the recipe on hand. I might play with the ratios next time. For example less Katchup and maybe add a bit of garlic.

This is terrific!  I used the original recipe's ingredients, but I baked it at 375 for 20 minutes per side (I was hungry!) and then broiled it for about 2 minutes on each side just the brown up the meat.  Thank you!

I followed the advice of several other reviewers, and altered the recipe in several ways.  First, I marinated the chops for several hours before putting them in the oven.  I also only used 2 chops, but the whole recipe of marinade.  Next, I added some diced onion, approx 1 sm onion, and covered the dish with aluminum foil. Then I baked it for 30 mins on 350.  Then I removed the foil and spooned the marinade over the chops.  I baked it around 10 more mins at 450.  I served it with rice, broccoli, and apple sauce.  It was a great meal!!

These were great!  I marinaded them for about 3-4 hours and I GRILLED them, using the sauce for basting.  They were superb grilled along with some pineapple slices.  I will make these again, probably for company because they are that easy and that good.

I am having a pre-thanksgiving dinner, so I decided to try this recipe first before I actually make it for 10 people.  My husband and I loved it.  I'm a beginner in the kitchen and this was super fast, delicious and easy to prepare.  I have to agree with the other reviews, definitely double up on the sauce, use Teriyaki sauce instead and add corn starch to thicken the sauce.  I used 1/4 teaspoon for every 1 teaspoon of sauce used.  I skipped the brown sugar since I used Teriyaki sauce.

We really liked this recipe. We followed the other comments by doubling the sauce, adding chopped onions and covering the dish with foil for the first 30 minutes. We didnt have any soy sauce so we used terriaki sauce with pinnaple juice which I highly reccomend. We didnt even have to marrinate it, just popped it in the oven and seved over rice! Next time we will try adding some pinnaple chunks.

The inexpensive pork chops I used were tender and moist. Next time I'll probably double the amount of sauce and marinate the meat overnight in half of it, saving the rest to actually bake the chops in and perhaps use cider vinegar instead of lemon juice to add a bit more tang to the sauce.  I did drain the chops halfway through the cooking as others did.  An update to my initial post:  The leftovers made excellent Pork Fried Rice.  I cut up the pork and added it (along with the leftover sauce) to white rice that had been briefly sauteed with green onions.  Then pushed everything to the side and scrambled an egg.  Mixed all back in together and enjoyed my lunch.

This was awesome!  Tangy, juicy -- perfect!  I doubled the sauce and had enough sauce left over to put on mashed potatoes.  The best part is - you usually have everything on hand and it is a snap to put together!  I did marinate for about 4 hrs prior to baking.

My fiance and I thought this was very tasty! I gave it 4 stars because the cooking time was way too long.  I had thinner pork chops so I reduced the cooking time to 16 minutes on each side.  They were overcooked! One thing that saved me is that I covered the chops with alumnium foil so they didnt taste too dried out.  Marinade is great! I will defiantly be making this again- just reducing the cooking time!

I made this for my husband who is crazy for pork chops.  He talked about how awesome this recipe was for two days. I did however add some onion and some crushed red peppers for a little spice. It is now a family favorite for us and our children. thanx

I give this one a " 5" because I loved the flavour of this marinate. I had to make some substitutions because I didn't have a couple of the ingredients on hand and I did not want to go to the store.  First of all I did not use any Worcestershire sauce because I have a dangerously allegeric reaction to that sauce.  So that was out for me. Then I didn't have any lemons, so I used  one teaspoon of apple cider vinegar and I swear this is a very delicious sauce.  Can't wait to try it again. DELISH !

This didn't turn out well for me at all.  I followed the recipe exactly except for cooking for only 45 minutes and they were still WAY overcooked.  To save the meal from being a complete disaster, I ended up dicing up the meat and adding store bought barbecue sauce to make sandwiches.

The best marinade ever!!!! Very similar to Filipino adobo sauce. I didn't have lemon so I used orange marmalde instead. You'll want to double the recipe. Perfect for grilled chicken too. This is now my "go-to" marinade!!!!

Not my favorite.  Cook time should be cut in half.  Mine were so over done after 50 minutes that they were like hockey pucks.  Very surprised it rated as high as it did.  Sauce was too watery and didn't adhere to the meet.  Wont cook it again.

Outstanding!  I did tweak it a bit. I followed the tips from others and tripled the recipe.  I only used 1 Tablespoon of vegetable oil and I substituted the brown sugar with Splenda Brown Sugar (You only use 1/2 as much).  My diabetic husband ate ALOT more than he should have, but with absolutely NO problems with his sugar levels!  I've used this twice, now.  Once on pork chops and the second time on boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  GREAT--either way!!! Thank you for sharing this.  Definitely a KEEPER!

The sauce was tasty, but 1 hour is way too long to bake.  The chopes turned out dry and rubbery.  I'll try this again at 15 minutes on each side.

The sauce on these was so good.  I would have liked to marinate it over night but didn't have the chance to do that.  I also drained the pan before adding the sauce the second time. I can't wait to try this on chicken and try it for grilling.  it was such a good combination.

We LOVED these pork chops! I doubled up the sauce & scaled the recipe to 4 chops. I also drained the liquid from the pan before turning the chops over which made a big difference so thanks for the tip! I also left out the veg oil. They were moist & delicious. Thanks so much!

These were really good. I cooked according to the recipe except I seasoned the chops & seared in bacon grease (had for green beans) for a few minutes along w/onion slices. Placed in the baking dish & topped w/the sauce.  They turned out very moist and tender AND lots of flavor!

AWESOME! My family loves these. I have used thinner pork steak, as my family likes them better & they are less expensive (definately drain before turning.) The first time I doubled the sauce after reading reviews. Now I triple the sauce (divide) and add the rest after draining & turning. This is requested all the time.  There are never any leftovers.  Thank you Kim!!

The one hour in the oven was a little long so mine came out a little on the dry side.  But the family loved it!  Can't wait to try it again.....but decrease the baking time.  I also didn't have any Worcestershire Sauce so I replaced it with Oyster Sauce.

Something else I did with the leftovers the next night:  marinated pork fried rice.  I just put the leftovers in the food processor with a litle soy sauce and shredded them.  Then I lightly fried it in a pan with some vegetable oil.  Added the cooked rice and a little more soy sauce until the rice was light brownish.  Mixed it all up and served it with broccoli.  Delicious!

I used thin-cut, boneless pork chops and only cooked them for 15 minutes on each side, and they came out tough. (I doubled the sauce, so the chops were almost completely covered.) If I make this again, I will try marinating the chops in the mixture for a couple of hours. Beware, when I opened the oven door after the second 15 minutes, the oil in the sauce was spattering everywhere -- even on my arms as I removed it from the oven. So I'll either skip or reduce the oil next time! I don't know how to describe the flavor, but it's not too sweet, not too ketchup-y -- somehow the ingredients all blend into a good flavor (despite an unusual aroma while baking). It's an easy weeknight dinner. Thank you, Kim!

Yummy! What a great recipe! Easy too! I followed the recipe perfectly (I did squirt lemon juice over the chops before adding the sauce just so they wouldn't dry out) and they came out super. The flavoring was very good and not a pork chop was leftover! I'll be making these again often! Thanks so much!

Can't get enough of these porkchops.  The sauce the marinate is wonderful.  I have been using the recipe for a while and am just now getting the chance to review it, so I can say that it's a keeper.  I do double the sauce when I make it b/c I love it so much.  Serve it with a nice herbed rice and look out!

Excellent.  Try it, you'll like it.  Just make extra marinade.  Will definately make again and again.  (Just writing this review is making me hungry for them!)

these were actually pretty good prob would have been better if i didn't over cook my chops but that was my fault cause i used loin but i only did it for 30 min 15 on both sides actually not even that more like 20 min to 25  but the recipie was good they had a good flavor.

These were good. They didn't "wow" my tastebuds but they did satisfy my stomach. I used thin chops so I didn't need to bake as long but there are other chop recipes I prefer over this. Mind you they're good...but we didn't find them to be spectacular.

These pork chops were tender and flavorful.  It is a quick and easy recipe that is made with ingredients I have on hand.  We really enjoyed them.

Excellent. I'm not usually a fan of barbecue sauce but my husband is and I needed a good recipe for pork chops. They came out juicy and very yummy. It's easy to make and I plan to make this regularly. Definitely a keeper!

This is very good!! My husband enjoyed it very much. I did change a few things-I used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and I cooked this on my Foreman grill instead of baking it. It turned out great!

Good, but not great. Nothing different or special in the flavor. Just sweet tasting pork chops. I can see where children would like these.

This was excellent. However, When I make it again, I would definitely cut back on the oil in the sauce. (I doubled the recipe). And drain the fat after the 1st 30 minutes. Excellent flavor but I didn’t drain the fat the first 30 minutes and it was runny.  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is very good as is I’m sure, but I didn’t follow the directions exactly. I often make this sauce when I make pork chops in the slow cooker and it’s so good. I always omit the brown sugar cuz ketchup is sweet enough. I’ve never added lemon juice, that was very good. I usually add some miso paste or ginger and garlic if I have it for a little more flavor. I baked one thinly sliced chopsticks 350 for 20min per side n it was great!

This is such an easy and delicious recipe. I pour out 90% of the liquid before putting on the second half of the sauce to give it a crispier outside.

Delicious, easy recipe that the whole family loved-kids included !   My only suggestion is to at least double the amount of marinade and cover the pork chops with foil when baking for about an hour.

Hubby Loved it. I am rating on the fact that he asked ate both chops that I made and asked  me to print it out and keep it in the rotation as well as the ease in making as I do not eat pork.  I followed others directions and tinted it with foil for 55 mins and broiled for the last 5.  I upped the sauce by a third and added to the bottom of the baking dish leaving the recommended amount to brush the chops before placing in the oven as well as after the 30 min flip

One hour at 350 was too long. When I checked it 45 min the internal temp was already at 170. However, it was still delicious just a little drier than it would have been if I'd caught it at around 145. Will definitely do it again with a little closer to watch on the timing.

I really liked the marinade with one change--I substituted bbq sauce for the ketchup because my hubby dislikes ketchup. I marinated the chops for a couple of hours, and then instead of baking them, I broiled them. They came out crispy and delicious. Hubby pronounced them a winner!

I followed this recipe as is no changes, but I only had two,  1 1/2 inch thick pork chops to use. This was just enough sauce, so as one poster pointed out - if you're looking for sauce, you might want to consider upping the sauce ingredients.
Ok, ok...  the only 'changes' were in the cooking time and way - I covered the casserole dish with foil for the first 30 minutes and cooked it slow on 310F (I rent and the oven is wonky, runs on the high-side)  The meat was so tender and juicy and the flavour was delicious!
The hubs gobbled it up and made a sad face when I told him there wasn't any for seconds.
We will make this again, and again, and again....
Thanks poster!!

I thought the marinade/sauce was great, but the cook time was WAY off! I even pulled it out 10 minutes earlier then the directions said. Thinking it should have been 20 minutes on one side, flip and then *maaaaybe* 15 minutes on the other. Or just a total of 30 minutes. With applesauce on the side my boys ate it all but it was definitely dry and tough. Will use the sauce again!

This was okay.  Next time I would definitely make some changes to the flavor profile and marinade the chops much longer.  I doubled the sauce and it still didn't go far enough.  We  are a sauce family so if you are too make Extra!

Absolutely perfect as is! EVERYONE remarked how succulent this sauce was! However, the current measurements are good for no more than 4 pork chops AT MOST, so judge accordingly :) Thanks for the recipe!!

I made the recipe as written but was only cooking 3 pork chops. I thought the amount of sauce was perfect for 3 chops. We all absolutely loved them! I also put baby new potatoes in the dish with them and they were awesome because they soaked up the juices and sauce. This will be a regular for me now! Yum!

I will definitely make this again.  The sauce is amazing, but I will double the sauce next  time because it wasn't enough for my taste (I like to have extra for the rice & meat dipping). I had a bit of xtra sauce in the pan, but there was a lot of grease in it. I am still a beginner cook (4 mo.),  but I have learned a lot on this site. So that said, I think Ill try these changes next time.  Sear the chops first to get out some of the grease before baking.  Perhaps this will also keep the chops juicier (please post if you know how to keep pork chops tender & juicy). Perhaps its the quality of the meat?  Anyway, I will also double the sauce recipe, put a smaller amount directly on the chops and heat the remaining sauce in a pot.  Definitely give this recipe a try. Four stars because of the changes I will make to match our liking, but very yummy!

This is one of our favorites; however, 1 hour is  too long.  I bake it  for about 22 minutes on the first side,  20 on the 2nd, otherwise  the chops are too dry.  I also cover it with foil until the last  4-5 minutes. AND I use 1 T oil instead of 2, and salt and pepper both sides before spreading the sauce on. Also, the sauce covers 2-3 chops, so you'd need to double it for 6. Very, very good!

I made this as directed without any changes or substitutions and it turned out yummy! I did double the sauce because I thought we'd want it to be a little more juicy but everything turned out great.

These were probably the best pork chops I've ever eaten. I followed the recipe exactly, but cooked in my slow cooker. The sauce was AMAZING and there were no leftovers. I will definitely be making these again and again. Also, I used the sauce on chicken and it was also delicious. Thanks for sharing!

I make this marinade with only three pork chops and marinate for a whole day, after puncturing chops with a fork. I also use extra lemon. But soooooo yummmy. Then when cooking I pour leftover marinade over chops to let it cook on and under chops.  I Usually marinate my meat for an entire day. I give this one an A+

Very tasty. I slightly modified like others. Added some minced garlic, put the chops on top of diced onions, covered with tinfoil then broiled last 5 mins. It's a repeat.

After reading the reviews,I doubled the sauce recipe and did not overcook the pork. The pork chops were tender but the sauce was bland.  I think the sauce might be a starter but definitely needs more spice to jazz it up a bit.  I will use the leftovers tonight by slicing the meat thin and using one of our favorite BBQ sauces, but I will not make this recipe again.

The flavor of the marinade was good however it wasn't what I was expecting. I'm not a fan of pork chops to begin with but my husband is and he said these were really good. To me they tasted like teriyaki pork chops pretty much. I think the marinade would be very good on chicken.

I thought this recipe was fantastic! I did alter a little after reading the comments. I doubled the marinade, but used a little less oil and a little more lemon juice. I will also need to cut the time, as my new convection oven over cooked it slightly. And I only cooked for 50 minutes! So, next time, I will cook 40 minutes total. But my family absolutely LOVED IT! Thanks!!!!

This was very good and simple. I tripled the amount, per other's sugestions, for enough sauce for rice. No other changes. Use low sodium soy sauce.

Made it a 2nd time and still excellent. I did use the low sodium soy sauce and that made it better. Still tripled the amount and was the perfect amount of sauce.

Wow, these are really good and so juicy!  The cooking time is way off, though, and the sauce is only enough for 2 pork chops (I only made 2, but kept the sauce ingredient amounts the same, so this wasn't an issue).  The first time I made these I followed the instructions, but only baked them for 30 min (15 min per side) - the flavor was good, but they were too dry and the sauce was oily.  The second time I made some changes: I reduced the oil to 1 TBSP, marinated the pork chops in the sauce for about an hour, and baked them covered for about 15 minutes per side.   I think this sauce would be good on chicken, too.

I am giving five stars because this was really a great recipe for a marinade. I changed one thing for the recipe and that was olive oil for veggie oil (and I added cayenne pepper for personal preference) and I altered the cooking method. The title of this recipe is "Marinated Baked Pork Chops" and the chops really need to be marinated with ingredients listed. The directions as written for pork chops and how to cook them are subjective and need to be adapted to your meat - six pork chops can mean anything. And the ingredients for this recipe really either need to be marinated or need to simmered for flavor (the flavor is spectacular BTW). I recommend marinating. I had two 2" pork chops and marinated them for 24 hours in a zip top bag. I baked them at 350*  covered for 35 minutes and then finished them on the grill for about 10 minutes. My hubby said they were the best chops he ever had. They were moist, tender, and very flavorful, again FIVE stars for the ingredients in the recipe. I highly recommend this, just adjust to your meat so they do come out dry.

Delicious, tender, and - best of all - easy to make.  I substituted pure apple juice for the lemon juice and it was FAB!  I cooked them in a Pyrex baking dish uncovered for the first 30 minutes, then covered for the final 30 minutes.  Pared with chopped spinach and honey potatoes, it was a fabulous dinner!  I can't wait to cook this again!

I didn't have pork, so I used this on chicken, and the only thing I did differently was to add 2 cloves of minced garlic to the sauce.  I did not use half the sauce, turn meat over, add the other half. I just poured it on, covered the dish, and placed in oven. I removed the lid for the last 20 mins or so.  Very tasty. I doubled the sauce so there was a good bit left, and I'm using that on small pork loin roast today. I'm sure it will be very tasty. This was good and will definitely make again. Might add a little mustard next time. Not quite 5-star worthy, but a good, solid recipe.

These are the juiciest pork chops I have ever had. I did them in a casserole dish on the grill. Indirect heat. It only took 40 minutes.
The flavor was great! No leftovers!

I added more Soy Sauce and used  olive oil and Sriracha as subs for stuff I didn't have. I also added A1 sauce. It turned out amazing. My Fiance didn't want to wait an hour so we  preheated oven to 450 degrees and cooked 16 mins each side and it came out perfect. It happened to be the first porkchop I have been able to eat since getting pregnant 5 months ago!

This was okay flavor wise, I used it in a pinch since I had all the ingredients on hand and didn't know what else to do with the chops.
I used the full amount of sauce for only three boneless pork chops. Mine were done cooking at 30 minutes... i covered the first 20, turned and basted again and then 10 more and they were good to go.

I used this on thick-cut boneless pork chops and it was delicious! At the end of baking, I broiled the meat for a few minutes to get a nice caramelized topping. Will for sure keep in my rotation!

Delicious! No revisions to the ingredients. Adjusted the recipe for 8 but only cooked 4 chops 3/4" thick covered for 30 minutes at 425, uncovered last 15 minutes and moved rack to the very top of oven. Just enough juice to serve over rice. A definite keeper.

I didn't change a thing. I did make a little bit extra sauce but not doubled and I'm glad I did. While baking the porkchops I also roasted potatoes, yams, and onions tossed in oil, salt, and pepper, in another casserole dish along side. I plan to make this for friends I'm expecting in a few weeks because it can be baking while I'm enjoying their company.

Less than 5 minute prep? What a great dish for those wanting to offer a delicious homemade dinner, especially on busy weekdays. I had all ingredients on hand and enough pork chops to either serve them as leftovers or brown bag them for lunch. I tripled the sauce and had only a wee bit extra.
(Better more than not enough)  Needless to say, at the end of the meal there weren't any left.
Thank you for sharing your recipe  Kim- This one's a gem!

3 stars on taste, but 4 stars for the minimal prep.  It would taste better if the chops marinated for a few hours and you pierce the pork with a fork to let the juices in.  Sauce was thinner and less flavorful than I had expected.  Needs less cooking time (by about 10-15 minutes).  Not as good as the Chinese Pork Chops recipe.

Made this tonight. I have a very fussy 9 year old who won't eat meat because it's "too dry," and I am proud to say she ate every bite of this and asked for more! I doubled the original sauce recipe and covered the pan in tin foil for the first 45 minutes of cooking, removing the foil for the last 15 minutes. There was still lots of sauce in the pan and the pork chops were delicious and moist. We will be making this again! :)

We have used this recipe MANY times because it is very simple and I typically have the ingredients already in the cupboards. I like to use it on other items like rice, chicken, and steak, and it always turns out delicious. Depending on my mood, I'll substitute teriyaki for soy sauce. I recommend doubling the recipe to use as a dip for the pork chops, and to freshen up the next day leftovers. Thanks for the great recipe! It has been (and I know will be) a family favorite for years. 5 stars.

good sauce.... i marinated thick bone-in chops..good grade of pork, and i thought they would be soo tender. WRONG!  tuff, over cooked.  i have a hard time w / pork.  an hour was way too long.  maybe 40 minutes tops. the sauce was tasty tho..may try again. and test after 30 minutes.

Ignore the misleading title - (no marinating involved) - and definitely add this dish to your family's dinner menu.  Have been making this recipe for 5+ years and it never fails.  Change up the "barbecue" sauce by adding some siracha sauce for heat or be creative by substituting lime juice for the lemon.  This is a simple preparation that roasts in the oven while you tackle chores or relax with friends.  Triple the sauce recipe.

This recipe always turns out awesome, and it's nice and simple.  I usually serve it with rice and either broccoli or green beans.  Most who eat it take second helpings.

I loved it! I've just been cooking for a few months and this will be my default pork chop recipes from now on. I just have to note though that although I used only 3 thin pork chops, I still followed the recipe which is meant for 6 pieces of pork chops- and honestly, I could have added more and I am sure it would still have turned out great.

I'm not a very good cook, and it seems like I can't cook pork very well. The meat was pretty tough, but I was still able to eat some, and my husband liked it. I think it was a good recipe, and would like to try it again when I learn to cook the meat properly.

This was an awesome quick recipe for delicious pork  chops any day of the week.  The family loved it and asked for  this dish to be made again. I found myself needing to make an additional 1/2 marinade to continue baking when it came time to flip the chops for the last 30 minutes. I agree with one of the previous comments also.  An additional 4-5 minutes under the broiler made this recipe perfect.  Bravo!

Simple, tasty, and can be made with stuff most people have around the house. I took the advice of others and doubled the recipe, and it still was just barely enough for a pound of pork chops. I also marinated the chops in the sauce for 3-4 hours before cooking. They came out tender and juicy. A real keeper!

This is my new pork chop marinate sauce. I loooooved it. I did make a few changes.  I didn't have lemon juice but I did have lime juice so I used it as a substitute.  I also used a splash of apple cider vinegar. I made this at my sister's house and my neice and nephew wanted seconds. This will be used as my go to recipe for years to come.  Thank you for sharing!!

I made this tonight and it came out great!  What I loved was I had all the ingredients on hand and it was so easy!  Very tasty!  I too made double the marinade as suggested by others, and I'm glad I did!  I also drizzled over my brown rice and the favor of both the pork chops and rice was "Fabulous".  I will definitely make this again!

It was a family hit and a nice twist to baked pork chops. I also made a few changes. Being that my family is sauce lovers, I did triple the ingredients for 6 bone in chops. I also added some teriyaki and steak chop marinade as well as apple cider vinegar for tenderness, served over white rice, came out absolutely superb!

Great & super easy recipe. I only gave 4 stars since my chops were dry. Next time I will reduce cooking time. The sauce is excellent. I did make a batch of sauce to marinade the chops in for a few hours, then 1/2 batch of sauce to baste and it was the right amount for 4 pork chops instead of 6. Hubby says these are the best chops I've ever made. Bravo! Keeper!

Easy, tasty recipe!  I wasn't blown away by the flavor, but it was good!  I omitted the worcestershire sauce (fish allergy), and doubled the sauce ingredients, and instead of doubling the oil used a "single" amt of oil and the same amount of rice vinegar.  I put half to 2/3 of the sauce on top of the chops in their baking dish, let sit in the fridge for a couple hours before cooking.  After cooking covered ~20 min, I scooped out the sauce/liquid in the pan and topped with the remaining sauce, and cooked uncovered another 10 min or so.  They were very good!  I think I will marinade in a bag next time though, to get the marinade all around the chops instead of just the top.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because it tastes really great on its own, but even better with a few small changes.  My changes:  I double the sauce, but use 3 T rice vinegar instead of 3 T of the veggie oil - makes it a marinade.  I let the pork chops (1" center cut boneless) marinate all day and then pour the chops and all the sauce into a 9x13 pan.  I cook them uncovered at 350 until my meat thermometer measures 145 degrees.  Some days, this takes 30 minutes, sometimes only 25.  I don't turn them at all, just let them cook.  I then serve the chops with some of the sauce liquid over top - super yummy.  The rice vinegar gives this a kick that my husband loves.  The sauce liquid is also really good as gravy for mashed potatoes or over rice.  I don't make any extra sauce other than the initial doubled marinade.

Wonderful!  I was looking for something different to flavor my pork chops with, and this really did the trick.  I'll be making this a lot more.  I think I'll even try it when I start grilling later this month.

Fantastic recipe, I added some red wine vinger to turn it into a marinade, left it in for 4 hours, and some lemon pepper to it, and fixed it up with mashed potatos, corn and peas

Sauce was really good, but chops were dry.  Kids had to break out the Ranch dressing for dipping.....this one I'm throwing back.

Very easy, and quite tasty!  I made the sauce (x3) and put it all in a baking dish in the fridge to marinate all day... afterwards realized I left out the oil (oops)... guess what?  Perfectly good without the oil!  Look at all the fat and calories I saved!

Not a fan of pork chops but loved this recipe, even my picky 8yr old loved it. Glad I tried something new. Make sure to double the recipe for a good coating of the delicious sauce! Whole family loved it. Thank you

Made these pork chops this week and they were great!  I doubled the recipe for 8 chops.  When I make them again, I will eliminate the oil & marinate the chops for at least 30 minutes for added flavor

Had 3 very large pork chops and doubled the recipe - marinated them instead of just brushing on before baking.  Baked in the sauce and then served leftover sauce over pork chops and my husband topped his rice with it as someone else suggested - it was good - not super sweet like so many barbque sauces - liked it well enough to add it to my real recipe box

I used this recipe for the first time about a month ago and I am making it tonight for the 4th time since. The sauce is pretty good, reminds me of regular Open Pit BBQ sauce. Bakes nicely too. Thanks! Try this sauce with chicken too!

We enjoyed the flavor of the pork chops, but I felt they cooked too long.  I would try cooking in a skillet next time and marinating for a few hours before that.

This one was just OK for us, I think due to the pork chops being too thin, it was really dry and I only baked them for 20 minutes.  The sauce was really good, I will try again with thicker pork chops,

I used 4 thick cut pork chops and made 4x the sauce (but not the oil).  I seasoned the chops with a bit of lemon pepper, made the sauce with an added small onion, finely chopped, put the chops in the pan with 1/2 the sauce over it.  Covered with foil, cooked 30 minutes, uncovered and then flipped the chops, added the other half of the sauce and cooked 30 minutes uncovered....yummm. Served over noodles. Hubby, who is not picky but doesn't give the "very good" comment much gave this a "very good".  The only change I may make would be to try a TBSP of corn starch in the sauce to thicken a bit so it will stick to the chops and noodles a bit more.  This was very easy and delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved the flavor, however, either my pork chops were too thin (boneless at about 1 inch thick) or the cooking time far too long (and I took them out after 30 minutes) they were VERY dry...I should have taken them out at 20, but I thought I would attempt to follow the recipe.As it was, I took them out only half way through what the recipe said.  The sauce was amazing, I think I will make that to put over rice and meat any old time. I gave this three stars because there was not enough information regarding the type of pork chops..maybe if I had the bone-in ones that would have been different. I doubled the sauce and I did not use it all, but I did not turn them over half way through either. But good flavor!

Baking these for one hour was WAY too long!  The chops were so well done, they were awful!  I can see the potential, though. The sauce was good.

This was fantastic! I doubled the sauce and used boneless chops, and they were mist and delicious. I also marinated them for about an hour before cooking, and cooked the first 20 minutes covered, then 20 more minutes uncovered.

The recipe was very tasty. I did as followed except i Seasoned the pork chops with garlic salt, onions, onion powder, garlic powder and pepper. I Dipped each chop in the sauce then let marinate for 2hours in fridge before cooking. I also covered with foil for the first half hour then poured rest of sauce over and cook for the rest of the time. My husband and I LOVED it

This was really good. I followed the recipe pretty closely, however this was the perfect amount of sauce for two pork chops...I would definitely triple if making the recommended six. Very tasty and I will be adding this to my rotation of easy weekday meals.

Wow this is a great recipe.. I doubled it and put my chops in a baking dish and covered them in the sauce, I put it in the fridge for a few hours then popped it in the oven. didn't bother turning it.. and WOW.. how easy, and my bf was asking for more before his plate was even clean!!!  :)  since I didnt turn it,  it didnt need to be broiled as I saw others saying they had done.  Will for sure be making this again and again!!

My family loves this recipe! It's also great with chicken. I like to double the sauce, add a sliced onion, and serve over mashed potatoes!

I have to say, I usually dislike pork chops, but this recipe turned out to be extremely delicious! The ingredients are all something I had on hand and it was very flavorful. I used thinner pork chops, so they only took about 40 mins to cook instead and came out tender and yummy! I definitely recommend this and will use this again for sure.

I cooked this for my buddy and I and we LOVED it!! The only thing I did different was added crushed red peppers. If you like a sweet/salty/spicy flavor then it's for you!!! :-)

I really liked this recipe. I doubled the sauce after reading other reviews, and it was perfect for 6 boneless chops in a 9x13 baking dish. I would definitely make it again, and maybe use tomato paste instead of ketchup, as I'm not too fond of the sugar in ketchup. Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of the best marinades. It is not only good for pork but chicken as well. I even made double the batch for a dipping sauce or for those who want their meat extra wet.

Well, Made this based on my sisters review (I trust everything she reviews) I doubled the sauce and marinated for about 2 hours. Dumped entire thing in pan and baked for 45 minutes, but will prolly do less next time. I found them to be very flavorful, but my daughter only ate half of hers. So I was sad because I thought i wouldnt be making them agin. Later that evening after my son came home late, he made a point to tell me that this was by far one of the most "amazing" dinners I had ever made. Hmmm looks like going to be one of those make when she not here dinners. yumm

Absolutely fantastic flavor and so easy to make!  Only 1 change:  since I don't do Worcestershire sauce, I added a few drops of hot sauce instead.  Served it with "Easy Spicy Roasted Potatoes" and green beans.  Nummy!!

I've used this recipe many, many times now, and the glaze is AWESOME.  I like to put mine on the George Foreman-esque griddle to caramelize the sugar a bit.  Everyone I've made them for has absolutely loved them.

I did make some changes.  Used Thai chili paste w/garlic in place of ketchup, peanut oil instead of vegetable and dark brown sugar.  My husband and I like spicy hot food and these changes were right on.  Cooked four chops that I wrapped with apple smoke bacon and made the six serving measurements for marinate.  Will definitely make again.

I made these chops last week and was surprised at how easy they were. I have only one suggestion, when turning the chops over, I actually placed them in a new pan as to keep the grease to a minimum. We loved them.

The flavor was good, but the sauce did not stick to the chops.  I would try marinating them then BBQ-ing them next time instead of baking them.

I did exactly as the recipe said but the meat turned out to be so dry. :(  My husband loved the sauce, so I'll give it two stars, but one star for me, unfortunately...

I made this tonight, based on the reviews, and this recipe was just bland. I only made two big chops, and let the entire thing sit in the sauce for an hour in the fridge before baking. I even added a clove of garlic, 1/4 cup chopped onion, and a tbsp of BBQ sauce to this recipe, and at most, it is just ok.

This marinade was ok. I ended up tripling it for 8 thin chops, but I had a little too much. I marinated for 7 hours.  I also wish I added garlic and spices because it was kind of bland. I don't know why this has so many reviews. The ketchup and soy sauce was way too strong, so I don't think I'll be trying this again, but if I do I will half those ingredients.

So many positive reviews on this so I was excited to try it and what a bummer. It tasted like a barbeque sauce....and a weak sauce at that. I think a store bought sauce would have been better. I won't make this again.

This recipe is so easy and tastes great!  I only made 3 pork chops and had just enough marinade for them, so if you make 6 pork chops you will need to double the marinade.  For the last 30 minutes, I covered the dish with tin foil and the pork chops came out so very tender!

Excellent with these changes. For the sauce, use 1 tbsp of lemon juice and only 1 tbsp of oil per batch of sauce. 
Make 1 batch of sauce for every 2 pork chops. Marinate for at least an hour and reserve some sauce for basting. I only had to cook my 1 inch pork chops for 30 minutes covered, then 5 minutes in the broiler. They could have possibly even cooked slightly less and finished cooking while resting. Thanks for the recipe! Will definitely use again!

I made only small pork chops, the sauce and the pork chops were great. My only recommendation would be to reduce the cooking time of the pork chops if the pork chops are small and thin. I wish i would have cooked them 15 to 20 min on each side instead of the full 30. It was served with mash potatoes and asparagus! Will cook it again

Great recipe!, love the flavor of the sauce!  I am a new cook, and am a bit perplexed.  I make two pork  loin center cut, bone in chope  a few times, and they come out pretty good, but a bit dry.  A little tough on the outside, but nice and tender in the center.  I bake the pork chops (covered) at 350, but they are done after 12 minutes per side (internal teperatrue is way over 145).  Not sure what I am doing something wrong that they come out a little dry and tough in some spots, but this recipe is a keeper!

My husband is a hard man to impress. I made these and he kept going on and on about how good they are and how he really really likes this recipe. I only made 3 boneless chops and the sauce (for 6 servings) was the right amount, probably could've stretched it out for one more. I would definitely make more sauce than the recipe calls for.

I have made this over and over again. I have made it exactly as written and have made slight changes. The only thing I did was I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil. And I HAVE to at least quadruple the sauce. MY KIDS DRINK THE SAUCE!! I do usually add extra lemon juice. If I am making extra sauce I dont use as much EVOO though. But every thing else gets doubled (or quadrupled) Thanks for the recipe!!

I was a little leery of the ketchup in the sauce, but this turned out wonderfully. The pork was juicy and perfectly cooked.  I did triple the amount of sauce just so I would have a little extra. I felt that the original amount barely covered the pork chops. All in all, great recipe!! My husband loved it!

I had 8 pork loin chops and I tripled the ingredients including 2 cloves of garlic and marinated them for a couple of hours with half of the sauce. I baked them covered for 15 minutes, turned them over and added the remaining sauce and left them uncovered for 10 minutes, then broiled them for 5 minutes to give the sauce a nice glaze. Also, I cut  a medium size onion in quarters and baked them as well. The taste was so flavorful and everyone loved them.

Great, easy recipe.  My husband and kids ate it right up.  I made 1 1/2 the amount of sauce and it was perfect for 7 thin-sliced boneless pork chops (from Aldi).  Might try to tweak it next time just for some variation, but the recipe is great as is.

Fantabulous. Only changes I made were olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and I thinly sliced some onion over top. Served with wild rice and baked beans, and my boyfriend who doesn't particularly care or pork loved the sauce!

Yum! East to make and tasty. Made it as directed, but instead of using six pork chops only made two, so I had more sauce per chop.

Even my 9yr old loved in.  Wonderful flavor.  The only thing I would add is for you to lightly salt the pork chops before you ad the sauce.  Cooking it low at 350 allows it to come out so tender.

PERFECT marinade for the chops! They came out amazing and tender and flavorful. Tangy, sweet, and savory! The only thing I did different, (because I read previous reviews) is that I let the chops soak in the marinade for about 6-7 hours before cooking. That way the flavor soaks in a little better. I made extra sauce to cover the chops with after they cooked. I made these for my friend and he LOVES the pork chops and thinks the marinade is from a store-bought bottle LOL!

This was incredible!  I made 2 pans and my family ate twice as much as they normally do!  I made one pan by the recipe, and one pan with strips of bacon on top of the sauce.  The bacon made a juicier chop but the flavor of the original recipe was better.  Also I doubled the sauce amount.  So good!  My husband is a chef and he took one bite and looked at me and nodded enthusiastically, then shoved another piece in his mouth :).  Will make again soon!

what am I missing, I don't understand why this is rated so high.  an hour to bake is waaaay too long, mine were over done after 45 minutes and the recipe does not say to marinate although I think that would be a good idea.  Also the sauce was runny and didn't glaze very well.

UGH!  This did not taste good at all.  I haven't done pork chops in a while, but this makes me not want to do them ever again.  What was the point of the oil?  It just slid off the chops, and it looked so nasty.

A-1 Marinade!  Only 1 minor change: added minced garlic.  Dinner plans changed so chops (4 large) marinated 48 instead of the usual 24 hrs, allowing plenty of time to soak up the flavors.
For those who complained of "dry meat", grill or broil the chops (and don't overcook!).  You'll never go back to baking pork chops.

I made this tonite. I took other reviewers advice and doubled it. It was a bit too sweet. Next time i will cut either the brown sugar or the ketchup in half and add either minced garlic or a bit of spice- maybe sliced jalapeno or something similar.

I had 1 lb. of pork chops and it was a perfect amount of marinade for extra to serve over mashed potatoes.  This was super easy, fast, and delicious.  My husband isn't the biggest fan of pork but he really liked this.

This was a great recipe, however, I doubled the sauce and I think next time I will be marinating the chops is the sauce for some time before I bake them. Maybe that will work better... If not, the recipe is still great as is and the flavor is wonderful! Thank you for the recipe!

LOVED THESE incredibly simply chops with what you most likely already have in your pantry (which I love that). I was afraid they'd be too sweet with brown sugar, but were not, but still I'd probably cut it back some just for sugar reasons--would still be great.

This was not too bad.  I'm sure it would have tasted much better had we not followed the internal recommendation of 160 degrees.  These were very dry.  I watched the mongolian pork chop recipe and they went with 140 degrees.  I think i will grill these next time as some others have done.

This was a delicious recipe! The set flavor goes perfectly with the pork.  I did add honey to help the sauce stick to the meat and to make it a bit thicker and somehow I was out of katchup so I substituted Heinz 57 instead.  Delicious and my boyfriend loved it too.

My boyfriend and I loved this! It was a perfect marinade and definitely my "go-to" for pork chops. The only adjustments I made was adding salt and pepper to the marinade (I thought it odd not seasoning the meat), and I grilled them (about 6 minutes for 350 degrees on each side). Juicy, fast, and delicious!

Used chipotle olive oil instead of vegetable oil which added a nice kick.  Made 4 pork chops instead of 6.  Wouldn't have been enough marinade with 6 chops. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious!  I quadrupled the marinade, adding a little bit of minced garlic and started with half of the sauce.  Dumped it out halfway through and added the other half.  I finished it under top heat which made the sauce the perfect consistency.  Oh and I used lime juice instead of lemon juice.

This was a very easy and delicious recipe.  I only had to bake the second side for ten minutes.  If I had gone any longer they would have been dry, so watch out for this.  I guess it depends on how thick your chops are. My whole family, including my picky 11 year old daughter, loved this. I'm definitely saving and making this recipe again!

I'll give 3 stars for the technique, but my family just didn't like the sauce at all.  The ketchup and Worcestershire just don't work well with the lemon juice and soy sauce.  The chops were fabulously tender and juicy, but I think next time I'll make my own sauce - either something hearty with worcestershire, garlic and A1, or a sweet Asian with the soy sauce, brown sugar, orange and hoysin.

I have had these before but decided to take a different approach to them. I didn't have lemon juice so instead I used 4 tablespoons of fresh squeezed orange juice straight from the orange. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic, and 1 teaspoon of my wife's favorite barbeque sauce. I'll only give you a hint at the brand (S**** B*** R**'* original). I think anyone can figure that one out but I would rather nobody get in trouble.

Made these last night as a change and they were very tasty. We loved the sauce.  I had no lemon juice on hand and tripled all of the rest of the ingredients to have extra sauce.  Had thin bone in pork chops cooked them for about 12 minutes per side and marinated as I turned them then broiled for about 5 minutes.  They were very good whole family loved them.  Thanks for the receipe.

Smelled awesome..tasted awesome. I seasoned my chops with onion and garlic powder and covered it with foil ...then removed the foil and broiled it the last five min ( per other reviewers)..You need to adjust the cooking time according to the thickness of the chop.

Very delicious. I doubled the sauce and added more on top and also added it on top of the carrots that I served with it. I also covered with foil until the last 5 min and then broiled uncovered. My two year old never eats the meat I make and she ate a ton. I was really impressed.

Just made this one tonight for my family and they really enjoyed it! I try staying away from frying stuff and the only way I've ever had pork chops is fried, so this totally worked for me : ) I think I'll cover them for about a half hr though because the meat could have been a bit more juicy. Nonetheless still a GREAT dish!

This is so simple and awesome! Followed the receipe to a T except for doubling the ingredients. After cooking the chops I seperated the juice from the fat, poured the juice into a pan, got that boiling. Mixed a couple tablespoons of water with a little corn starch. Added the water/cornstarch to the juice. It thickened up into an awesome dipping sauce.

Big hit in our house!  We used thin boneless chops so we reduced the cooking time to 30 minutes then 15 minutes.  Came out amazing!  
A nice change from eating chicken and beef all the time.

The sauce came out very tasty so I doubled it and added a little cornstarch to thicken it for gravy over my rice.I also added some diced onions and garlic just because I never really cook anything without it.

I love the warm seasons because all I have to do is marinade some meat and my husband cooks it on the grill. Dinner is a breeze.  I have come back to this recipe over and over this summer. I have finally concluded that this is the best marinade we have found loved by everyone! I don't change anything just double the sauce and ALWAYS marinade over night. This is a must. The lemon juice helps to tenderize the meat. Use on pork, chicken or beef. Enjoy!

My husband loves pork chops but I don't care for them. However I tried this marinade and now I have a reason to like them! It's also pretty good on chicken. It's very easy to make, as I always have the ingredients on hand. I swap olive oil for vegetable oil, which adds a bit more flavor and makes it a bit more heart healthy.

Oh, My gosh this recipe is so good! I've hunted for a recipe that would be like my mom made 30 years ago and THIS IS IT!

I made used all the ingredients listed, but I browned it in  with Paprika sprinkled on both sides. I put it in the oven with 1/2 the sauce, covered it, turned it over, drained and put the other 1/2 of the sauce on and backed the remaining 30 minutes uncovered. DELICIOUS! Thank you for a great recipe!

This recipe was AWESOME! The best pork chops I've ever had hands down. I doubled the sauce, because when making the marinade with the original measurements it was not enough to cover the chops. I also covered the pork chops with foil for the first thirty min. of baking time to lock in the moisture. It was so Yummy!

I thought this was a great, quick marinade. I had six pitiful, thin bone-in pork chops given to me by a food outreach. This saved them. I will get good pork chops next time and will double the marinade. That could be thickened, if you wanted a gravy. And, I think this marinade could be used for other meats...I'll try it on some boneless, skinless chicken breasts next time, as it uses most of the ingredients I use in my own marinade.

This recipe was pretty off. The "sauce" was not a sauce. It was a oily concoction. The flavor was great, but I would suggest you omit the vegetable oil and double the recipe. It did not make enough to cover both sides of my chops and I was pretty sparing. Also, it said bake 1 hour. Mine were ready in 25 min. It did not specify thickness, so the chops in the recipe must have been huge. Because mine were over done in 30 min(I cooked them to temp). Disappointing.

Excellent sauce!!  I doubled the recipe amounts and used Olive Oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also covered the pork chops for the first 30 minutes, drained liquid and then coated with the remaining sauce.  Very, very good!!

These were okay. I doubled the sauce because it didn't look like there would be enough. I marinated over night and just popped them in the oven when I came home from work. Good, nothing exciting but they were moist. Don't know if I'll make again.

I tripled the sauce and marinated the chops overnight. Then baked them covered for the first 30 min. This is the first time I've had pork chops that didn't turn out tough and dry. Delicious! Two thumbs up!

Very good marinade.  I didn't bake the chops as long as suggested.  It varies according to the thickness.  I baked slightly undercooked and finished off under the broiler a couple of minutes to crisp up the chop.  Hmm.

Love it!  To make things easier on myself I just put the whole amount of sauce on them from the beginning and flipped halfway through.  Turns out great!  I put some "sazon" all purpose seasoning on mine for a little more zing.

Once you memorize this recipe it's really easy to just eyeball the ingredients and mix up however much marinade you want want.  

Tonight I'm trying lime juice instead of lemon juice, I'm sure it'll be great.

Update: Lemon juice works great btw.

I've made this a few times with chops and chicken breast.  It's really versatile.  

If you're low on worcestershire sauce you can sub fish sauce.  I wasn't low on worcestershire but I had some fish sauce sitting around that I'm trying to use up.  They substitute very nicely, it won't give you the exact same flavor but one that's equally good.

I've also added a few drops of sesame seed oil to the recipe sometimes, that compliments the ingredients well.

Also I always make double the amount of this.  

If you want to make it more kid friendly, just use extra ketchup without cutting back on anything else.  Kid's will never learn how to get accustomed to new flavors if they're never exposed to them, right?

The pork chops were unbelievably tender after marinating for 24 hours. I'm not a huge fan of the powerful sweet taste so next time I will only use one tablespoon of brown sugar instead of two.

Awesome. 
I marinated the pork chops in a store bought garlic lemon marinade for about an hour. I added a squirt of chili sauce to the sauce to give it the perfect kick.  I flash browned in a cast iron skillet (no more than 2 minutes on each side).  I poured half the sauce over the chops and covered with foil for the 30 minutes.  Took out the chops, turned them over and added the remaining sauce and put it back in the oven for 20 minutes.  Made more sauce with the no oil and replaced all the ketchup with chili sauce.  Steamed artichokes and green beans. After the 20 minutes I removed the chops and threw them back in uncovered on broil for 2 minutes.  I poured the remaining sauce lightly on the plate and placed the chops on while I prepared the rest of  the veggies. 
It turned out so tender. Definite go to!
I also baked sweet potatoes while preparing the chops and when I took them out before broil they were perfect.

Used this recipe for my first time making pork chops and loved how easy it was. Made it for my little 7 year old girl and she couldn't get enough. Definitely going to be in the normal recipe rotation!

Very easy to make the tangy sauce is delicious however i feel that the recipe should increase the amount of marinade otherwise the pork chops can dry up.

This  was yummy! Didn't make a change to it all!
Except maybe triple the recipe. The sauce that was left over, I basted the chops, put them on a cooking rack, put the oven on broil cooked them til it made a nice glaze on the chops. Will be making it again and again!  Thank you for sharing!

It was great!!! but I did triple the recipe and marinated it for a couple of hours, then I doubled it again, to have more sauce to poor over at the end with a little extra, and I did cut down on the oil as well.  I covered it with foil for the first 30 minutes.  Family loved it, and will be making again, thank you so much for this recipe.

The marinade has a wonderful flavor but I do recommend cooking thick pork chops on a low heat for about two hours for tenderness. Also, marinate for pork chops before baking. This is a keeper for my family.

Very easy to make. My 1st time baking pork chops in the oven.

I added minced garlic & onions.
I also recommend using salt & pepper before marinating.
I marinated my thin boneless chops for about 6 hours and it still didn't marinate too well.
I recommend quadrupling the sauce.

I covered my chops for the 1st 30 minutes and they still came out dry.  I highly recommend the baking time listed for thick pork chops.  Please make sure when using thin boneless chops, to not overcook or it will be extremely dry & tough.  My thickest cut came out normal, but my 2 other chops came out very dry.

It has a great taste and sweetness. Def does not make it dry but more moist! I actually first marinated the pork chops with a "meat seasoning" packet first and then marinated the pork chops with this recipe. I can't wait to make it again!

Thank you!!!  Followed the recipe, nothing added different than the list of items, but preference I had to triple the amount to have enough sauce, used less oil ONLY (2) tblspns Olive Oil, oh, and (1) extra table spoon of brown sugar, lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce for taste preference. Worked great for me.  Baked 20 minutes covered and turned over and re-glazed and baked 10 minutes uncovered, empty extra juice poured a little more sauce and let cool for a minute or two.  =)  Very tasty!!!!

Followed recipe exactly.  Chops came out dry.  Maybe the chops need to be marinated for a period of time before baking.  I made the same amount of sauce for only 2 good size chops.

These turned out tender and delicious.  I doubled the sauce as suggested by other reviews.  I added a few shakes of garlic powder, ground mustard and black pepper for kick.  I let these marinate a few hours and then baked them.  Mine were done in 40 minutes and 1 hour would have been way too long so check them often.

I needed a quick simple dinner for last night and made this recipe exactly as written, except I doubled everything. I let the pork chops sit in the sauce for a little over an hour until I was ready to make dinner. These were DELICIOUS! My normally picky 5 year old had eaten her entire pork chop before I even sat down with my plate! I'll be keeping this one to use again!

Very Good!  I was looking for a new recipe for boneless pork chops and I think I have found a winner :)  Next time I might use less oil.

This recipe had replaced our old favorite recipe for baked pork chops!  AMAZING!  I doubled the sauce as others had suggested.  I also put mine in the oven at lunch at 225 degrees and baked them slow for 4 hours until I got home from work and they were perfect!  Serve with rice to soak up the juice!

Even with broiling, they still didnt catch the flavor well. Definitely need to use thick (bone in) chops...

This was pretty good. I added vinegar, garlic powder as per some reviews and also threw in pineapple because it was basically a sweet and sour. It was good on rice. I doubled the sauce.

The flavor was great! My boyfriend and i loved it! The only changes i will make next time is the cook time. My pork chops were a thinner cut and probably didn't need 1 hour of cook time.

This recipe is great as is, just double it. It has a great tangy, but not too tangy taste. Nice alternative to the can of cream whatever recipes for baked chops.

Very good! I have used this recipe on frozen pork chops because I forgot to take them out of the freezer and they still came out good.  All I did was increase the oven temp by 50 degrees and for the last 30 min reduce heat to what the original recipe calls for and let it cook uncovered.

A great flavorful and moist porkchop recipe. I followed the recipe as is except for finishing under the broiler the last two minutes. My porkchops finished in about 45 min, so be careful not to overcook. They were a hit with the hubby and kids. Thanks for a awesome porkchop recipe!

I baked these pork chops tonight for dinner. I doubled the recipe as others suggested. I covered the baking dish for the first 30 minutes and uncovered the dish for the last 30 minutes. The pork chops were juicy and tender. I marinated them in the refrigerator for about 2 hour before baking. My husband gave me the thumbs up. Thanks for this tasty recipe

Very good recipe. I added mushrooms to the top after 30 minutes and removed foil after 30 as well. A little bit dry, next time will bake for 20, remove foil and bake for another ten.

This recipe was ABSOLUTELY wonderful!!! It didn't smell too good at first, which had me a little worried, but the minute I dipped my finger in and stole a taste I couldn't wait to get the chops cooked so I could eat it!!! It was fantastic.  Just like everyone is saying, though, this does not make enough for six chops let alone four (which is how many I had).  I doubled this recipe for four chops and it seemed to be the perfect amount.  I would triple if you're going to be making six!!! But WELL worth it and more than simple to make!

I really enjoyed these. I made them exactly the recipe called for, just doubled the sauce. This is the first pork chop I have cooked in a long time that was not overcooked or bland. Yay! I will be making these again and again.

Will definitely use this marinade again.  We used hot sauce on ours too, and it didn't kill the awesome tangy flavor!!

This was awesome. I made minor mods to the recipe. Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, lime juice instead of lemon, and added garlic power to suit my taste. I put in the slow cooker and cooked until done. My husband who isnt a pork eater at ALL, loved it and asked for the extra to take in his lunch the next day for work. Doubled the recipe to serve over rice.

I make this using boneless pork chops and we LOVE it. I end up doubling the sauce so we have enough for our rice. Thank you for a great recipe.

This was a hit! My boyfriend said they were the best pork chops I've ever made! I doubled the recipe for a serving of six chops. I marinated both sides of the chops for about an hours. I followed another's suggestion and added sliced onions. Covered in foil for 30mins. Removed from oven and drained the extra juice. Turned chops over, added more sauce and baked uncovered for 30 mins. These chops were tender and juicy!

Thanks for sharing this recipe. Contrary to all the high ratings, I rate these as just OK, not good or great.   I suppose I prefer grilled chops more, and that may be the reason I wasn't thrilled by these.... I would make them again if it were impossible for me to grill for some reason.

I use boneless porkc hops and I definitely have to change the cooking time by half as, after one hour, they were really dry. Hope to change this next time. Thank you!

My family loves this recipe!  I have used pork and chicken and both turn out excellent!  I always double the sauce sometimes even more and serve it over rice.  My picky eaters love it too!  It's in the rotation of quick weeknight dinners.

I was really taking a chance making this tonight!  My husband doesn't like soy sauce and hates  worchestershire sauce.  I made it anyway.  It was great!  The hubby ate 3 chops and I ate one.  It is a keeper.  I told him the ingredients after dinner was over and he said I should make it again.  I think I will try it on chicken too.  Thanks Kim!

I simplified the recipe by saering the pork chops after seasoning them with s&p and italian seasoning(because I believe the sauce needs just a little more season)then I place them in a baking dish and poured the sauce over,then baked them at 375 for about an hour.They turned out really tender.I s a good recipe just adjust it to your own taste.

I read the comments on this recipe before trying and it really helped out a lot. I doubled the amount of sauce but used vinegar instead of lemon and it turned out really good, really tasty. It was a bit greasy so next time i make this i will probably use less oil or no oil at all. Overall, this is one great recipe Thanks Kim!

This is a keeper!!!  I followed the recipe with the following adjustments based on other reviews:  I tripled the sauce for 2 pork chops.  I didn't have enough ketchup so I added some hot and spicy bbq sauce and reduced the amount of oil.  Wonderful, tender and juicy!  Thank you for sharing!

I'm not a good pork chop cook.  I always make them too tuff, so I usually use a crock pot.  I actually baked these and followed the recipe to a tee.  My husband LOVED these and so did I.  I paired these with "Pesto Tomatoes" from this site and a salad.  This is a keeper!

Turned out tender and tasty.  I did shorten the cook time according to the thickness of my pork chops (cook time about 45 minutes).  My husband and I AND my 2 and 4 year old loved these.

I've made this twice so far.  It is so quick and easy and very tasty.  I throw the sauce drippings from the baking dish into a saute pan, add a little flour and  white wine or dry sherry, and cook until slightly thickend.  This gets poured over the chops and served with mashed potatoes and veggies.  A keeper!

These were terrific!  Followed the recipe as is, but there was so much juice that the sauce got watered down during cooking.  I made extra sauce to spoon on afterward.  So good!

An excellent and easy recipe. Made some small preparation changes. First, I doubled the recipe. Making it as is seemed to be not enough for the chops I had. I also put the chops into the sauce before cooking them for about an hour. Helped keep some extra moisture. Then, while it was cooking, I caramelized some onions and added them during when I flipped over the chops. Extremely tasty, simple and drool worthy. Will be making this again!

Great marinade!  Definitely need to double the recipe for 6 pork chops.  I marinated my chops for an hour, but not long enough.  Next time will marinate over night.  I also BBQ the chops rather than in the oven.

This marinate is wonderful!  I did follow some of the suggestions and I use sesame oil and it really brought out the flavor.  I used this on pork and chicken and it is great with both. I served this with Parmesan Potatoes from this site and it was wonderful.  This is a keeper!

Great marinade!  I actually doubled the marinade and let chops sit overnight. We then cooked on the grill and they came out delicious. Definitely will make again and bake during the winter months. Thanks for sharing!

I made this last night and was delighted with the taste!  I added thin slices of Bermuda onions and 1/2 cup of raisins.  Delicious! Doubled the recipe so that you can have enough for a gravy.

Delicious! A hit in my picky family of five. I also doubled the sauce to serve over rice.

These definitely need to marinate before just throwing into the oven. The sauce was a nice glaze for the meat. I doubled the sauce which worked out great because when I put it in the oven it was enough to make a nice bath of bubbling glaze around the meat - perfect. I also only did 2 bone-in chops. I recommend trying this one.

My pork chops were a little dry, but just a little. I could've used a bit more sauce, too, than was called for in the recipe. I think lowering the temp and cooking longer might've also made them perfect.

I'm not sure what happened.  I doubled the sauce, pursuant the suggestion of other reviewers.  I cooked 3 pork chops.  While the flavor was ok, my chops were a bit dry.  I cooked them 55 minutes, and kept them covered with foil 50 of those minutes.  Might be attributed to the fact that the chops were frozen and not fresh, but in the end, I didn't get the juicy result of other reviewers.  I may give it another try one day.

Surprisingly tasty and unbelievably easy. I only used 1 tb oil and may not use any at all next time. I will also cut down a little on the brown sugar.

Great recipe, excelent sauce. I did a low carb variation and substituted splenda for the brown sugar and cut the ketchup in half; it still turned out wonderfull without all the sugar.

5 stars for multiple reasons: the recipe uses ingredients I have on hand, is easy to make and is super delicious! I used the full recipe of sauce for 4 boneless chops and it was enough. Double the recipe if you want enough to season your side.

I am giving this 5 stars for the MARINADE itself. This is an excellent marinade and I think it would work better for grilled items like Pork and Chicken. The pork chops were a little dry for my taste. I did double the recipe and I only had 3 boneless chops. I will use this recipe again but for the marinade not for the baked chops.

i don't know how you can give this 4 stars!  the not-too-sweet sauce is the perfect pair for pork chops.  i used boneless, so i cooked on one side for only 15 minutes, then flipped, covered with remaining sauce and cooked for another 10 minutes and they were done.  the only thing i added was a garlic/basil mixture that i sprinkled on the chops after i poured on the sauce.  SUPER DELICIOUS!!!!

Very good - the pork stayed tender and the marinade wasn't overpowering, just gave a really nice flavor. I used sauce for 3 for 2 pork chops which allowed for a nice heated sauce to pour on top after plating.

I should have listened to one reviewer and followed my instincts.  This is more like a MEAT LOAF recipe.  In our house, we do not like pork chops that have a meatloaf flavor.  We did not care for it.

Double the sauce. It is delicious. I would cut the oil by half, that was my only complaint. Serve it over mashed potatoes..man, it was so good. Oh, and I marinated for about three hours...I think I will marinate overnight next time. One more thing, I poured the sauce into a small pan and simmered for about ten minutes to reduce it. Not necessary...but I like thicker sauces. Make this. You won't regret it.

I used six pork chops and had to make 4 times the amount of sauce the recipe calls for. I wanted them to be juicy because I had to let them sit in the fridge overnight for my husband to put in the oven the next day. They were very good and we will be making these again :)

These had a good flavor but I more than doubled the sauce and marinated them over night. I also seasoned the meat with tony's and garlic powder before the sauce. My meat came out kind of dry but that could have just been the kind I got.

Easy to make and has a great flavor.  I think if I made it again I would let it marinate in the sauce for awhile before cooking. I served it on rice with some cooked spinach on the side. Very good!

One bite and my eat- in -silence husband said, smiling, "Thanks, Hon. These are really good!" Will be making these again! I would strongly advise doubling the recipe for the sauce because it is so good. The meat is super tender and moist. I used boneless center-cut chops, so I shortened the time, and like many reviewers, would also recommend broiling for a couple of minutes to allow the sauce to adhere to the meat better.  Thank you, Kim! It's gonna be a good, good night! LOL

Great and easy, followed others suggestions added an onion and baked for 20 min covered, drained added the remaining sauce and baked uncovered for 15 min.  My pork chops were not thick and did not take the full hour to cook.  Moist and tender pork chops will make again soon!!!!

Very tasty! A great sweet and salty pork dish.  I will most likely reduce the amount of soy sauce next time just to cut down on that flavor, but I will definitely make this dish again!!!

Really juicy, delicious and flavorful!!  I followed the recipe and doubled it like others mentioned.  I also added onion powder, a little paprika and 1 tbsp. rice vinegar.  I covered it while cooking and broiled the last few minutes uncovered.  It looked beautiful, this one is a definate keeper!!

My pork had reached 175 degrees after just 30 minutes of cooking with a lid on the pan.  So I turned the temp down to 200 while other parts of the dinner finished and then finished the meat up with a quick broil.  Loved the flavors!

Believe it or not this was bland.  No depth to the flavor at all. It sounded exciting and flavorful but did not deliver.  The suggested baking directions of 375 and up made the pork very dry.  I will not make this dish again!

I rarely give reviews on the recipes, but these pork chops were soooo good!  I doubled the recipe and added some balsamic vinegar to the marinade.  They were delicious.  My whole family loved them, and believe me they are picky eaters.  Will be making regularly from now on!  I served with cubed potatoes tossed with olive oil and onion soup mix baked at 450 for 45 minutes.  Everyone loved dinner tonight!

Only changes were to double the sauce and use half ketchup, half bbq sauce as we prefer that mix for a bit of a smoky taste. I didn't flip my chops, however I did cover them and near the end of cooking removed the aluminum foil to let them brown. These were alright, I still prefer another recipe I use from AR.

Loved it!  Personally, I like a lot of sauce, especially if serving with rice which I did.  So I tripled the sauce and marinated 6 center cut chops for a few hours in some of it, saving the rest in the fridge for later.  I did sub sesame oil for veg oil, but only doubled that measurement.  I put the chops (including marinade) into a glass baking dish and baked them as directed, though I did cover them for the first 30 mins.  Then turned them (had to spoon off some grease/oil at that point), poured on the remaining sauce which I had simmered on the stove top and finished them off uncovered.  I did the broil trick for the last 5 mins to tack up the sauce but mine hadn't actually run off like others mentioned.  Maybe because I added the reserved portion later.  Chops were perfectly cooked, so tender, and the sauce was fabulous!  Even my fussy boyfriend really liked it.  That's saying something because he leans more toward bland foods and this meal is absolutely NOT "bland".  Thanks for sharing!  Yummy :)

Wow, this was surprisingly easy and it tasted delicious.  I've never even attempted making something like this, but you really can't go wrong.    I doubled the recipe for the sauce (minus doubling the extra sugar) and it was still yummy.  I also forgot that I wanted to boil/simmer the sauce first to make it a little thicker when the pork chop was cooking for the first half hour and when I checked on it the sauce had run off the chop. But I simmered the second half of the sauce and it stayed pretty well on the pork chop after that.    I served with roasted garlic lemon broccoli found on this site along with sarah's applesuace (also on this site).  Everyone loved it and I'm making it again tomorrow.  Thanks Kim. ;)

I followed this recipe as written except I covered for the first 30 minutes and cooked uncovered the rest of the time.  I only made two chops but made the same amount of sauce which was perfect.  I also put all of the sauce on in the beginning and just turned the chops over half way through when I removed the foil.  This was my first time making pork chops and they turned out delicious.  I will be adding pork chops to my main dish library.  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't care for pork chops that much, but these are very good.  I did marinate for about 5 hours and also tripled the sauce.  The only problem was that I found the sauce to be a bit thin. The last 15 minutes of baking time I took the chops out of the sauce, poured the sauce into a small pot and thickened it with cornstarch.  Simmered for a couple of minutes on top of the stove until it thickened. Then returned it to the original baking dish and poured the sauce over the chops and put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes.  It turned out perfect.  I will try it in the slow cooker next time which should really tenderize the chops. It went really good with "onion rice and pea and crab salad" also from this site.  This has definitely got to be the best place to find great recipes.

I made this for dinner last night, and followed the suggestions of other viewers to double the recipe for more sauce.  I did with the exception of the oil, this I did not double.  I also added 2 lge cloves of minced garlic to the sauce and then marinated the chops in the sauce in the fridge for 4 hours prior to cooking. The sauce is lovely, the meat was tender and tasty.  I paired it with the White and Wild Rice Pilaf reciped also from this site.  A very good sauce recipe that would be delicious on ribs or chicken as well!  A definite "keeper".

My family loves garlic, so I added about 1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic to a doubled recipe. I also pierced the chops with a fork and marinated them for about half an hour before baking. My daughter INHALED two chops and asked for more! This is a great recipe, and budget-friendly to boot. Thanks!

pretty yummy.  I think if I make it again I'll let the chops marinate in the mixture for an hour or so to really enhance the flavor.  my husband loved it:)

We didn't care for this at all. We ate it, but only because we had to. Won't make again, sorry.

I can never get my 2 year old to eat meat, I offer it with every meal, and he never eats it. This marinate is a godsend. He devoured a whole (large) pork chop, by him self. I want to  thank you for posting this!! Much appreciated!!

These are allright. I probably wont make them again. I marinated overnight, they had plenty of flavor, I just didn't care for the flavor. It's not bad, but not amazing.  To those who overcook them: Learn how to use a thermometer. Forget about the cooking times as stated and figure out how to use an oven properly.

Excellent! Very moist and flavorful! I did two things differently though, I let the meat marinade for awhile in the sauce before I cooked it, helped the meat to absorb the flavor! I added a bit more brown sugar too, but other then that it was grate! My family ate them up quickly : )

Simple and quick!  Great for working moms. Because I work and get home after my husband and children I marinated the night before, all my husband has to do is get home and pop it in the oven. Everyone loved them.

I was looking for an easy baked pork chop recipe and I found it.  This was simple and it turned out moist and delicious.  My husband and kids enjoyed it very much.  I will add this to my recipe box.

We enjoyed this. My husband wanted to grill the chops rather than have me bake them, and the sauce was nice for a marinade and basting. 4 stars because, while it wasn't over-the-top fabulous, still very good. I'll use it again.

I thought it was pretty good.  I put a homemade rub on the chops and browned on stove top before putting the sauce on.  Otherwise followed the recipe as stated.  The cooking time is too much.  Took them out after 45 min. and they were still a little dry.  Served with candied carrots, string beans, roasted garlic potatoes and cornbread.  Turned out to be a fairly decent meal.   I would make it again with a few modifications!

I let the chops sit in the marinade for about 45 minutes and then put all into a baking dish fit with a lid.  I baked a bit longer because I had America's cut chops.  Very good and my 4 year old loved them.

I found the suggested cooking time much too long. Next time, will follow others suggestions!  I also sprinkled black pepper and garlic powder on chops before adding sauce.  My BF said these were perfect, but much too dry and chewy for my son and I, after only 30 minutes total.

After reading everyone's comments,  I doubled the sauce, with half the oil.  Substituted OJ for lemon juice, with a dash of ginger, had 4 chops, and could have had more sauce. I also poured out the oil/sauce after the first 30 minutes, to reduce the fat ... divine!

These pork chops were delicious. I seasoned my pork chops first with some spanish seasoning, then I saw this recipe. I put the pork chops in the oven as directed and as it was cooking I poured the marinade on top. I flipped it over after about 20 minutes and poured more marinate. My son is a picky eater and he said "mom you should make this everyday." I will use this recipe again. Thank you.

Futzed around, worchestershire, soy, sweet hot mustard, garlic powder, apple cider vinegar, ketchup.  Boiled marinade after cooking it with chops.  Added packet of brown gravy to cut tang. Cooked chops covered about 30 min,  well recieved!

This was very good!  I tripled the sauce, used lime juice & added some apple cider vinegar.  I also baked it covered & broiled it the last 5 min.  I still wish the sauce was thicker, but still tasted excellent.  I served with winter vegetable hash.

This was a bit too sweet with a strange aftertaste IMO. I'm not a big ketchup fan, so this could have contributed towards it.

Wonderful! I just tried this tonight, and my husband is a very picky eater. He hates when I try something new, but he LOVED it! I left out the lemon juice, because I didn't have any and it still tasted great. This will definitely be on the menu more often.

Really good dish.  It's hard to find good ideas for pork chops that doesn't dry them out.   I sliced the chops before placing on a serving dish, then poured the hot marinade over them.  Very tasty and juicy.   I served it with mashed sweet potatoes.  Yum!

My family raved about these pork chops and it's all about the sauce! I definitely will double the sauce recipe, since the amount was not enough for six boneless chops, plus we wanted extra for dipping! Next time I will put the pork chops on a drip pan and not a baking pan. As the pork chops baked, they sat in a lot of drippings and the the sauce started getting watery. I put the done chops on a different pan and put them under the broiler for a couple of minutes so the remaining sauce would get slightly carmelized. SO GOOD!

The sauce tastes like a bland, sweet barbecue sauce – too sweet for our tastes.

This was ok... I thought the chops "boiled" in the sauce and didn't have an appealing look to them. About the only thing that saved it was that I made a quick reduction of 2 tblsp. butter, 2 tsp. brandy and 1 tblsp orange juice concentrate. I poured it over the chops and it saved the dish.

These were awesome- made them up last night with things I had around the house.  I used the full recipe for sauce for 4 small porkchops and substituted the worchestershire with a bourbon glaze sauce (didnt have worchestershire)  the boyfriend LOVED it.  I made with oven roasted potatoes and green beans.  It was delicious and EASY!

i thought the marinaded outside was good but the inside of the pork chop was plain. Therefore, my kids used ketchup to dip the chops into. I think i would make this again but let the marinaded items sit on the meat for a couple of hours so the inside could absorb the flavor as well.

I tripled the recipe (following previous review advice)for 6 pork chops. Turned out excellent! My husband hates to eat pork chops, but loved these. Definitely will make again. Did not have time to bake in oven, so cooked for about 20 minutes in cast iron skillet, then transferred to George Foreman grill to finish and sear in flavor.

This recipe turned out pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of pork chops because they always seem bland, but the sauce on these helped that. I did marinate the chops for about 5 hours and then made extra sauce to spread on before cooking.

Made a couple of times now & really like it. We did use others suggestion to double the sauce. When baking we've found that 20 min a side is enough. We covered the chops until the last 10 min when we uncovered them.  UPDATE: 5/1/2018 tonight we had these again & I don't know what was different but my hubby & I both couldn't figure why we gave these a 4 star because they should've been only a 2 or 3.  Why we doubled the sauce I still don't know because that was most of the problem I think. I'm deleting this from my recipe box cause I don't want to go through not knowing if they'd taste good or not each time I would've made them.

Tasty!!  Made these for dinner tonight, but since I was only cooking for hubby and I, cut the recipe in half (only used 2 chops).  I found the 'sauce' amount to be plenty.  I did mince a garlic clove into it and opted to use sesame oil instead of veg oil (nice complement).  I did only use 1 tsp of sesame oil even after cutting the recipe in half since I find it has a very prominent flavour and I didn't want it to overpower the other ingredients.  Baked covered for 30min, then uncovered for 10, perfect!  Juicy and moist, thanks!

Very tasty.  I marinaded the pork chops for several hours before cooking.  Baked in covered pan for 30 min, rotated and covered with remaining sauce.  Served with white rice and used the sauce from cooked chops to pour on rice.

This was great! Even though, like some other folks I changed things a bit. I didn't have worchestershire sauce or ketchup when I thought I did, so I subbed extra soy sauce and chili paste. Then, the oven was occupied, so I cooked them on the stove. Super good.

It's 4 stars, but I give it 5 stars with following changes: substitute chili garlic sauce for ketchup, decrease oil to 1 tbl. (as others suggested) Marinate chops for several hours. I then made another batch of marinade w/no oil. Placed chops on the grill, indirect heat, and brushed with marinade w/no 
oil while grilling.  I've used this for chicken on the grill (fabulous!) and am trying it with pork ribs on the grill tonight.

I have made this recipe twice, and my family loved it both times!! I poked holes in the chops, and brushed the sauce on and let them marinade for an hour.  I also made a double batch of the sauce and served it over white rice this time, and it was a huge hit! I also followed some other suggestions and put it on broil for the last 3 mins.

really wonderful considering how easy it was. I followed the recipe exactly and our chops were very tender...we had the thick ones. Chops are not juicy when you cut into them so make extra sauce...I made 3 times more and served over rice. Husband loved it...will try with chicken soon.=) Thanks 4 great recipe!

This recipe was good, not great.  I felt I should have made more of the sauce than what the recipe suggested and I only made 4 chops.  Also I think they would have been better if I actually marinated them for a few hours instead of just putting the sauce on and then baking right away. The flavor was very good though!

This was great!  I used one Tbsp sesame oil for a doubled recipe instead of all the vegetable oil, but I left everything else the same.  I left the sauce on for about 20 minutes before I cooked the pork chops, so they actually were marinated.  I broiled the pork chops for 6 minutes on each side.  These were some of the best pork chops I've had.

The marinate on this is very good.  I have a recipe that is similar to this, and this one is better tasting.  I also marinated the pork for about an hour, then broiled the pork.  I heated the marinated in a sauce pan and served it on the side (to save calories).

Excelent. The most tender ans savory pork chops I had cook. I suggest to marinate it a day before baking.

I made this recipe tonight looking for something new with pork chops.  I followed the recipe exactly except used only 3 pork chops and adjusted the recipe for 3 servings.  My family felt it was bland and not enough flavor.  If I made it again, I would add some other seasonings and marinade the pork chops for at least 30 minutes before baking. 
I don't know why so many gave it a high rating?

I think the sauce had a great flavor. I had to substitute the soy sauce for terriaki sauce. But the flavor was delicious. Also I cooked my pork chops for less time. between 30 and 45 min. This was a great recipe, I'm glad I tried it!

I followed the recipe, but took it out at the 45 minute mark.  It was so over cooked that we couldn't eat it.  I even had bought the thick sliced pork chops.  If anyone can tell me why this turned out wrong I would appreciate it.  And - when I say they were cooked beyond eating I mean it - they were like rubber.  And the reason I took them out of the oven at 45 minute mark is because my husband thinks I'm too paranoid about cooking temperatures - which I am.  But even I don't like rubber pork.  So bummed - I think they were probably already pretty well done when I flipped them at 30.  Please help.  :)  The sauce seemed amazing though - and it tasted great with the rice and veggies I had on the side.

Wonderful receipe.  I made it and doubled the marinate.  It was wonderful, and will definately make again.  It's great to get receipes on how to prepare different meat meals.  My husband, loved it, and he is hard to please.  Definately worth trying.  It's a winner receipe.

I switched the oil with italian dressing, and only had the second side in for 20 mins. I think that next time I will leave it covered for more than half, except the last 5 or 10 mins.

A quickly prepared and tasty dish.  I saved some calories by omitting the oil and carefully trimming the pork chops.  The recipe is a keeper!!

Tried these tonight and the family really liked!  Doubled the sauce, baked covered for 30 minutes, uncovered the last 30 minutes.  Good for quick, week-night family meal.  Served with wild rice and roasted asparagus.

Easy recipe to follow.  I tripled the ingredients in the sauce (although I would only use 3 tbsp of veg oil).  I also broiled the chops the last 3-5 minutes.  Even my son, who is the worlds pickiest eater, ate a chop.  Will make this again.

This was very tasty and so simple.  The flavors blended so well.  I did add a clove of garlic because I use garlic in almost everything I cook.  But otherwise, I wouldn't change the recipe at all.  Next time I am going to try it with chicken.

This was a true hit in our house for dinner.  I did sprinkle the chops with garlic powder and pepper before I put the marinade on.  I also baked 20 minutes on each side then broiled them the last 5 minutes to finish them off.  They were a little dry next time I will lessen the cooking time.  But I will say they were great and the smell while they baked through the house was perfect

Good flavor, good marinade.  I doubled the marinade to have enough for a sauce.  It's a thin sauce and not a sticky sauce unles you put it under the broiler uncovered like the other reviews say.  Served with noodles or rice and it's a filling meal.  Not something I would make all the time, but it's nice to have this recipe for a change every now and then.

Very good and tasty. I has no vegetable oil so I substituted peanut oil since it was going with the soy I thought it would blend well and it did. Family loved the taste especially my kids.

SO good!!  It was simple and delicious.  I marinated the pork chops for about 30 minutes before baking and the chops were  juicy and perfect.  My husband and my 2 1/2 year old son loved them, too!

We enjoyed the flavor and our pork chops were very tender. I doubled the marinade recipe, marinated the chops overnight in half. I baked them uncovered. First for 15 minutes  in the marinade they had sat in overnight. Then poured that off and basted with the other half and baked 15 more minutes. The sauce thickened and stuck to the pork just fine. Easy and delicious!

Quite good. If you follow the recipe and do not cover the pork chops the marinade does stick to the chops. Draining them half way through is a good idea, though.I let the chops sit in the marinade for  4 hours before baking.

as others said the marinade didn't "stick" to the chops. i tried corn starch yes it thickened but didn't help tasted good but i  think i will only use as a marinade in the feature.

I made this dish a few weeks back and it was good. I'd make it again because I typically have all the sauce ingredients in the house and it's easy and better than just plain porkchops. But, it's not outstanding or anything. A good week night main dish.

i made this last night.  instead of ketchup and sugar, i substituted some bullseye bbq sauce.  it also took about an hour and 15 minutes--could just be my oven.  i covered it with foil for the first 45 minutes.  very tasty.  will try the sauce with chicken, also.  thanks!

This was not a hit with my family.  The sauce was lackluster and the pork chops did not turn out tender at all!  I did what other reviewers suggested:  doubled the sauce, marinated for 4 hours before cooking, cooked first 30 minutes covered with foil, drained, cooked another 20 minutes uncovered then 3 minutes under the broiler to set the sauce.  This one won't stay in my recipe box.

I have to fair and give this 3 stars for flavor of the marinade.  It was tangy and a little sweet and overall pretty good.  My only problem is that I realized I don't care for pork chops at all.  I will use this on chicken though because as I said, the marinade was good.

Really good marinade. I made it exactly as stated but had no lemon juice...I also cooked for two so I cooked it for 20 minutes on one side and 15 on another. Really good flavor with stuff I had on hand.

Made this again with lemon juice...I make the marinade in a ziplock bag and swish it together with my fingers then put the (2, 1.5-2 inch thick boneless chops) in the bag and marinade it for 4-5 hours. I bake as stated above and it is soooo juicy and has really great flavor! Thanks for this recipe!!!!

This was liked by the whole family.  I chopped an onion and added it to the sauce.  Next time I might sautee it 5-10 minutes first.  I tripled the recipe for 6 good-size chops and had plenty of sauce.  One hour is way too much cooking time.  Mine were more than ready after 45 minutes.  One problem was that so much liquid came out of the meat, the sauce got a lot thinner than I wanted/expected.  Any fixes for this?  I tried pouring off all the sauce into a saucepot at the end and cooking it down, which helped some but everyone wanted to eat already.

I made this recipe, but I decided to marinate it for 1 hour before baking. I also changed the baking time to 20 mins per side because I tailored the recipe for 3. I will defently do this recipe again. My kids even liked it and they are real picky

This was simple and tastey. I made mine with 4 pork chops...but still used all the sauce. My only changes were to salt and pepper the pork before adding the sauce, drain the dish before adding more sauce, and I added a little hot sauce to the mixture. Thanks for a great recipe that I don't have to run out and get all the ingredients for!

it was very good, i just made it for dinner and it was very tasty. My husband enjoyed it alot, he was sceptical when i first was decribing it, but after tasting it he was impressed. Though the next time i will marinate it for about a day or so, that way the taste gets to seep into the meat.

Loved the sauce, but havent yet did the baked chops yet. I took the recipe and trippled it put it in a simmer pot to blend and desolve the brown sugar, and to reduce a little.Once cooled I put it in bottles to have when ready.I did however baked some ribs @ 200 in the oven covered and then tossed them on the grill basting with sauce.WONDERFUL!

I made these for a church dinner, and they were a big hit! But because i had t make them before church, and such a large quantity, i changed the cooing instructions up some. I used about 30 boneless chops, and put them in a turkey sized oven bag in my big roaster. On each layer, i poured a little bit of the sauce. Then when I had them all in, i poured the rest of the sauce in. I let them sit overnight in the fridge, and this morning i turned the bag over to let the sauce go ther other way. I cut my six slits in the bag and baked them for about an hour and a half at 350. They cooked perfectly, but the sauce ended up mixing with the juice. This made them less saucy, ut the shops themselves were full of flavor. Everyone enjoyed them though, and I even got a thumbs up from my father-in-law, who is usually skeptical about new things. The only thing was.. I didn't like them too much! But I was the only one.

Prep time was minimal and the flavor was good. Others commented on the baking time being too long.  I used a thicker cut of meat therefore the baking time was perfect. Just remember the size and cut of meat will dictate how long to bake.

This was good.  I liked the taste of the sauce.  I doubled the amount of the ingredients for the sauce (except for the oil), I used 3 tablespoons of olive oil instead of vegetable.  I used boneless pork chops and cooked it for 20 min. on each side at 375 and they came out perfect.  Will definately make again.

I thought the flavor of the marinade was excellent. Seeing the other reviewer's comments about the runniness, I substituted honey for the sugar and it thickened it up some. I also added a sprinkling of Italian seasonings to the top while baking. They complemented the flavor nicely and made up for the water from the chops dilluting the marinade. I will definitely make this again, but next time I think I will follow another reviewer's advice to pan sear them prior to baking.

This was very good!  I had 4 boneless pork chops and marinated them for 2 1/2 hrs in sauce as stated (minus 1/2 T. oil) plus 1 tsp garlic powder.  While I put that marinade together in one ziploc bag, I also put together another thing of sauce in another ziploc bag and refridgerated that along w/ the marinating pork chops and sauce.  Then when time to bake, I used the fresh sauce to put on according to recipe directions.  Only needed to bake about 10-15 min each side as my porkchops were only about 1/2 in thick.

Very tasty and easy meal!  Like others, I reduced cooking time a few mins.  Also pressed garlic and pepper right into the pork chop before adding sauce.  Sauce is great on rice!  Thanks for the keeper.

We've never baked our chops before. My husband was going to grill them tonight, but I thought maybe the flavor would keep and they would be more tender if we baked them!! Great recipe :)

These were really good.  Extremley tender and well flavored.  I used center cut bone in chops, so my cook time was about an hour and fifteen minutes.  I added some minced garlic to the marinade [I add fresh garlic to everything but my desserts hehe].  I also covered the chops in the marinade and wrapped them in saran rap in the fridge for about an hour before cooking.  I also doubled the marinade so I could add more during cooking.  All and all a really good weeknight recipe.

GOOD RECIPE- BUT it needs some changes!
First, I tripled the recipe for 6 thick pork chops. Second, I also added a little garlic. Third, there is a little too much vegetable oil, so cut that back. Last, they only need to cook for about 20-30 minutes total. Despite all of the changes, they turned out very yummy!

This was SO GOOD.  My husband took one bite of the pork chops and said that I have to remember this recipe.  The pork chops were very tender and the flavor was delicious.  I only wish I had made more pork chops!  This will be my new pork chop recipe.  I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil and I grinded some black pepper onto the pork chops before adding the marinade.  I also doubled the marinade and poured it on top of white rice.

Very easy to make with things you already have on hand.  I love these kinds of recipes.  I did only use about 2 TBSP of olive oil and a tsp of garlic paste and tripled the recipe to have some sauce to serve on the side.  Was very good, and easy to do.

I found this recipe very easy to make using ingredients I had on hand. The sauce was very good. I had to triple it since I was cooking 6 chops. I did add a bit of garlic to the sauce. It turned out great and kids loved it. will make again

These chops would probably taste better cooked on a charcoal grill.  The marinade wasn't really "Tangy" but it didn't overpower the flavor of the pork.  I will try this recipe again but I think I'll double the marinade ingredients then marinade the chops overnight then cook them on the grill.

Everyone loved these.  I used thick bone-in chops and they came out nice and moist.  I omitted the lemon since I didn't have any, only used half the oil, and also added two tablespoons jarred, minced garlic to a tripled sauce recipe.  Yum!  This is going into the rotation.

This is a fast and easy way to prepare pork chops.  Our two year old, who likes to dip everything in ketchup, really liked these.  I followed the advice of others and doubled the sauce but cut the oil in half (you really don't need much oil).  Thanks for sharing.

Although I loved the taste of the pork and the sauce, I will definitely use thicker pork chops because they were quite dry.  I am sure this recipe will merit the full 5 stars once I change the thickness.  I will also try as someone suggested to add peppers and onions to make it even more visually appealing as well as tastier.  Enjoy!

These came out very well. I did have to shorten the cooking time by nearly 15 minutes. If I had cooked them for the whole hour they would have been very dry and tough. The flavor was great, and I will be using this recipe again.

These pork chops are very good. I tripled the marinade, poured half over the chops and refrigerated the pan for several hours. The chops turned out very tender with good flavor. It does help to drain the pan halfway through the cooking time as others have suggested.

Awesome!!  We watch our carbs, so I used Splenda and low carb ketchup and it turned out great. Make sure you pour off the liquid after the chops bake for a bit like others recommended.  Will definitely make this again and again.

Just fixed this recipe today.  Very good, a solid 4.  I altered it a bit and used others' tips as well.  Coated the chops with a little flour, seasoned salt and pepper and seared it on a skillet first.  Layed the chops on a bed of onions then sprinkled a touch of lemon juice, ginger and cinnamon on top then the sauce.  To the sauce I added 1 Tbsp honey, 1 Tbsp apple juice, 1 tsp apple cider vinegar, pinch of minced garlic and 2 dashes of tobasco.  Instead of using 2 Tbsp ketchup I used 1 Tbsp ketchup and 1 Tbsp tangy barbecue sauce.  Do not use any oil,  it's not needed.  Next time I won't bake it as long.  Chops were still tender but could've been more tender.  I used 3, ~3/4" thick pork loin chops and baked them 15 min @ 325 then 5 min @ 350 on each side and used the amount of sauce for 6 chops.  The sauce is good, not like a barbecue or a sweet 'n sour but a nice blend of both.  Will try this recipe again and adjust the baking time : )

"Marinated" is a misnomer since these chops aren't marinated but rather baked with the sauce.  Anyhoo, the sauce is delicious and also works very well with chicken and vegetables served over rice.  My husband asks for it at least once a week.

Not a recipe I would try again unless I made this on the grill- I would also use grilled veggies (sliced onion and peppers)to add to the the chops-
alone.... not enough!

OUTSTANDING! I've made these several times and this remains my ONLY pork chop recipe.  I always use the big,fat pork chops from Costco.  They've never disappointed us.  I've passed this on to many friends and family with the same response -YUM and Easy!  Grew up with dry/flat/boned/ chop bricks that thanks to this recipe my 3kids will never have to eat :)  THANK YOU!!

This recipe was simple to prepare, but did not wow anyone in my family.  If I make these again, I would cut down the oil because there was a lot left in the bottom of the pan even though I used lean pork chops.  The sauce almost needs something else.  Maybe some sliced onions baked on top of the chops would make this recipe better.

Convenient.  Although this did not "knock my socks off", I liked it because it used the type of ingredients one always has on hand.  I think it's a better alternative to barbecue sauce, because it's not as thick, and the sauce sort of soaks into the meat, flavoring it a bit more. Thanks Kim for an easy supper.

I made this for supper tonight. I made it exactly as written, but took other reviewers suggestion and doubled the sauce.  I only baked them 20 minutes a side, and they were tender and juicy. The sauce was delicious, and the whole dish was quick and easy.

We enjoyed this as an alternative to bbq sauce. If you don’t lean towards a sweet sauce you could cut back a little on the sugar and be fine.

I made changes based off of many of the other reviews. Definitely had to triple the marinade as it was not enough. Used white wine vinegar rather than oil. Marinaded the chops for a few hours before baking and then broiled to get them crispy. They turned out wonderful. We will be making this again.

No flavor. I had 8 1” chops and had to double the sauce. Baking in the shallow dish caused them to retain too much juice which “watered” it down. Just flavorless. Won’t do again.

Wanted something new for supper, and this turned out AMAZING.
I didn't have brown sugar or lemon juice, so I used white sugar and orange-mango juice. I will 100% make this MANY more times!
I doubled the recipe for 8 pork chops, and paired it with mashed potatoes and baked beans, drizzling the "juice" over everything on the plate.

It was great. The only thing different I did was that I used garlic infused olive oil in the sauce that I used to marinate the pork chops. I tripled the sauce so that I could have sauce to cook the pork chops and sauce to pork over the chops.  I marinated the pork chops for about 6 hours. with the sauce.  It took about 30 minutes to cook.  I also broiled them a bit.  I served them with corn on the cob and garlic mashed potatoes.  There wasn't a drop of food left on the plate.  Definitely a keeper.

I cooked in the  oven then in a skillet for the second half of the cooking, they reached the 145 degrees quickly, I cooked until the internal temp reached 160 and they were just right. They retained the flavor of the seasoning which I modified with white sugar and orange juice since it was what I had on hand. Great recipe! Thank you.

I have made this a few times and my family likes it however we found the pork a little too tough. So this time, I boiled it first for about an hour than poured the marinade and baked and followed the recipe. This came out more delicious as the pork was a lot more tender and juicy.

Made it tonight for dinner, I made pork steaks instead of pork chops, I have a really PICKY 13 year old eater, his 11 year old brother isn't as tough of a critic lol but their father has his bachelors in culinary and I made this for dinner tonight and they gobbled it up!! I'm not going to lie when he seen me taking out all the ingredients to make the sauce he was like what are you doing? I said mind ya business lol and when he tasted the food he was like this is great! lol.........the only things i did different was double the sauce because I am a VERY saucy cooker and added a 1 tablespoon of lemon juice instead of 1 teaspoon because I absolutely LOVE lemon juice lol.......this recipe was great and I will definitely be using again!!!!

Fantastic!  I brined with salt and sugar first. Double the sauce (it's just that good). Cook 30 mins, check temp till it reaches 145°. Finish off by broiling a few mins.

I've made this recipe so many times, it's always a hit. Definitely double the sauce, we eat it with rice and my family loves the sauce so much they pour it over the rice. Watch the pork chops since pork cooks pretty quickly. If you have a thinner cut of meat 15 min on each side will cook it through.

It's a good recipe but I am playing around with the flavors to make it more on point because it's an odd combination of asian and western that doesn't quite mix.

I have always made pork loin chops with shake and bake but no matter how I cooked them they were dry and tough. I took a chance on this recipe. As I watched them cook I thought they would be tough. But they were incredibly tender and moist. Big hit with the family and me. Will definitely use this recipe next time.

The heat seemed a bit high, I'm used to "low and slow" for pork chops (275 F for 1 hour, etc). Though these tasted ok, they were definitely not as tender as I am used to. I even started to panic when I took them out because they felt so tough.

I’ve made this many times and it’s been a hit every time.  I use boneless chops about 1 1/2” thick.  I serve with rice and broccoli and make extra marinade to put on the rice. I’d give it six stars if I could!

I followed the recipe exactly except I only had 4 chops.  My boyfriend said it was ok.  I wasn't impressed. The sauce was ok but the chops didn't have any flavor at all.  Definitely use an instant read thermometer, I had bone-in chops and baked 15 minutes on each side and they were almost over cooked.

I followed the reviewer "Ijustmightbecrazy" and adapted the recommended changes. I doubled the ingredients for the two chops, marinated the chops for several hours, turning several times, reduced the marinade and baked the chops at 350 degrees for40 minutes ( 2 thick bone-in chops).  Perfect!  Thanks for the added recommendations!

Made the marinade as written, except I tripled it. Marinated them all day...about 8 hours. They had very little taste, as pork often does.

I don't love pork but this was delicious. the sauce was what made it so! I used about 1 lb of meat which was four chops. there probably would have been enough sauce for 1 1/4 lb meat. I would refer to this as a sauce vs marinade, semantics aside it was very good.

I doubled the sauce after reading several reviews about not having enough sauce.  I had a lot of sauce but that’s just fine with my son.  Very tasty and I would definitely make again.

This was good, but lacked the flavor punch I was looking for.  I doubled the sauce, and marinated the chops in a bit of it for about 8 hours, before covering them with more sauce and baking as directed.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I topped the chops with a final layer of sauce and quickly broiled them at the end, for a nice glaze.

Marinade was pretty good, but the cook time was off and I wound up overcooking my pork chops. Pretty sure hubby said not to make again.

It was a little dry, but I did like the sauce. I let the chops soak in buttermilk for a few hours. Doubled the sauce recipe. Sauced the chops and baked covered for 30 minutes, flipped chops and cook for another 20 minutes (still covered). I then drained liquid and added remaining sauce and broiled it for about 8 minutes (uncovered). I let it rest for about 10 minutes. I wouldn't mind using the sauce recipe again for something else.

I soaked the EASILY 1 1/2 inch thick bone-in chops in the marinade over night.  Used a thermometer set to 145 and covered the dish the chops were in the first 20 minutes at 350.  Then, I pulled out the chops, drained the liquid from the bottom of the dish and put the chops back and baked 15-20 more uncovered at 350.  Meanwhile, I saved some sauce aside from the sauce I made for the marinade and in the last 1/2 hour reduced it in a saucepan to thicken.  Used that thickened sauce to pour over over the finished 145 degree chops.  Now in the dinner rotation.  Thank you, Kim.

Good recipe, we like it.  I bought extra pork chops on sale, I  put half of chops (uncooked)in a freezer bag with half of sauce (tripled sauce for rice) and cooked the other batch for supper.  I also made extra rice and froze to go with my frozen chops and sauce, just thaw in fridge night before.

I'm always looking for new pork chop recipes but this one just didn't hit the mark.  Although the sauce was tasty my pork chops were dry (I used boneless chops).  I don't think I needed to bake them as long as stated.  Will maybe try again with modification.

My husband really doesn't love pork chops but he gave this easy recipe 5 stars. I tripled  the sauce with the exception of the oil. I only used 1 TBSP olive oil total. I used 2/3 of sauce to marinade most of the day. The remaining 1/3 I used for basting. My chops were pretty thin so I basted every 7 minutes and baked a total of 30.  They turned out very tender. We will have this again.

I am surprised this has such high reviews because we didn’t care for it.  It seems you could just add your favorite bbq sauce and bake for the same results. The chops definitely need to be pre-seasoned and browned at the end.

My family devoured these pork chops! I used four pork steaks that were  3/4" thick. I quadrupled the marinade, to make sure there was enough, as we like stuff saucy! Perfect amount, chops cooked perfectly along side some baked taters. This is now in the meal rotation. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

I made it per the recipe the first time.  Made it once on the grill also.  Then one time used more soy sauce as I love soy sauce.  Great recipe. I have even marinated the chops in the sauce before cooking them.  LOVE IT!!!

This was really good - another protein find for my growing son.   I did change a couple of things for personal preference. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and only used 2 teaspoons of brown sugar as I didn't want it to sweet.

I made the recipe as written other than making extra sauce. I did change the cooking method a bit. I heated a cast iron skilled (oiled) in the oven, and put the pork chops directly on the skillet, then poured some sauce over. I used a meat thermometer as my chops were thick. I also covered the chops for the first part of cooking Flipped them at about 70 degrees and added more sauce. The first side was seared so it made broiling less of an issue. I finished them to 145, pulled them out to rest and put the skillet on the stove. I had a bit of sauce left over so I added that to the pan and reduced it a bit. Hubs approved of the meal. I think a meat thermometer is key with chops or any loin meat. Pork is so lean these days that overcooking ensures a tough product. I served the chops with mashed potatoes and broccoli.

The flavor is great, BUT the baking time is way off. Be sure to use an instant read thermometer because my inch thick chops were dry and chewy after 45 minutes.

I loved the sauce. However, once on the chops and in the oven it kind of watered itself. Did not care for it much at the end. I will have to think of how to thicken it so it adheres to the chops. I did follow the recipe to a tee!

Turned out great, but I did the recipe for two pork chops not six like the recipe states. I would recommend doubling the amount of sauce for six chops!

The taste was good, but my sauce was much thicker than shown and it completely burned. There is a lot of sugar so of course it would burn. The chops were ok though just no extra sauce since it was all burned up.

Made it according to recipe. I used pork center cut chops about half inch thick. Cook 15 minutes on each side.  Some had second helpings. That’s the sign they liked it.

I did something wrong here.  I don't think my pork needed an hour of cook time.  Maybe 1/2 that.  These were dry as a bone and I did marinate them overnight.  I don't blame the recipe, I think I just overcooked them.

Nice easy meal to prepare and cook. Im a terrible cook who barely knows how to turn on the oven but I found this recipe easy to understand and follow. The only thing that I have changed is increased the sauce.

EASY - Good for family.  Made to the recipe but with double the sauce as suggested.   Tented the pan with foil for the first 30 minutes in the oven.  Drained out the excess liquid then  flipped the chops over and spread on more sauce for the remainder of the bake time.  Then broiled for 3 mins with the remaining sauce on top to finish......  DH thought the sauce was "too much" flavour but I thought it was exactly right for pork.  Very easy to make, ingredients on hand......used 1 inch pork loin chops, bone in.  Time was fine, meat stayed moist and tender.  Served with Basmati rice and buttered corn.   Will make again.  Can't give 4.5 stars to split the difference with DH, so I gave 4 .

I have made this several times in the last couple of years since finding it and always tastes great! I always double or triple the recipe and let t marinade. I also took a tip from someone else by only cooking them for 15-20 mins and using Tin foil for half the time and put it on broil for the last 5 minutes. The pork chops always come and tender this way and never dry. This is a keeper! My family loves it! I usually serve with whole grain rice or mashed potatoes. A great sauce over the potatoes as well!

I made this recipe for dinner using four pork chops (2 for me & 2 for my husband).  After my husband was done eating he started eyeing my plate wanting more.  We LOVE this recipe!  Needless to say, I will be preparing this recipe again.

Wonderful, easy recipe. I made just for 2 of us so only 2 porkchops. Just barely enough sauce as I made rice as a side dish and it was very tasty on the rice.  If I was making 6 porkchops I would probably triple the sauce.

Yum! Left full amount of sauce ingredients the same for just 2 pork chops. Added some cornstarch mixed with water 1/2 way through cooking to thicken the sauce. Glad I did all of that with the sauce, great served over the chops and couscous. Even the DH gave it 5 stars!

After baking 30 minutes, I added drained pineapple chunks and maraschino cherries to the pork chops and sauce.  I returned the baking dish to the oven and continued baking for the additional 30 minutes.  It was very good.

Well I followed the directions, with the exception I didn't bake them the full time. The weren't moist at all. Like many people I seem to fall into the dry pork problem sometimes.

I was looking for a recipe for chops that I didn’t have to pre-fry. This was so easy to put together and tasted delicious. I doubled the sauce because I wanted extra to put onto the rice I served with it. Delicious and easy 2 things I like. This is a recipe I may try on chicken.

This marinade is good but it is a bit thin (so I used 3 vs. 2 TBSP of brown sugar) and I made two batches.  I used one batch as a marinade on the chops, about 4 hours.  The other batch went on the chops when I flipped them after the first 30 minutes of cooking.  I also covered the first 30 minutes with foil.  Last note:  I only had 3 bone in chops, in my opinion, was just enough marinade , more chops will need more marinade.

1 star for the sauce. 0 for the pork.  Your video (which I didn't watch first) and your final photo don't match.  I used center cut pork loin chops  (which match your photo) and it was so tough and chewy we couldn't eat it!

We loved this!!  At the end of baking I put more sauce on top and broiled them until it carmelized. They were awesome!!!  You can add more brown sugar for this and it will carmalize quicker. I took them out of liquid and onto a different pan prior to broiling. They were still tender and delicious!  Be sure to poke holes on both sides of chops before baking to allow for marinade to get into them.

This sauce was so simple to make and was just right for my family's taste. Instead of baking, I broiled the chops. I put the sauce on one side, put it sauce side down in the pan and added sauce to the other side. I broiled it on HI four inches from the broiler for five minutes, then turned them, brushed on more sauce ( I doubled the recipe ) on the top side and broiled again on Hi for 5 minutes. I did this three times and then reduced the broiler to Lo setting and continued rotating two more times until the juices ran clear. The total cook  time was about 30 minutes, but the time will probably depend on how thick your chops are. They came out moist and flavorful and there was enough sauce left to add to the chops before serving or to use with rice as a side.  I will definitely use this again, maybe on the grill next time!

My fault the chops were like hockey pucks. I cooked it the prescribed time but wish I had put my thermometer in to alert when done instead of being petrified. The sauce was good. Going to try one more time but keep my meat thermometer in the chops

Excellent! I didn't make any changes. My chops were pretty thin so next time I will either get thicker chops or adjust my cook time down. The sauce was delicious!

This is a keeper!  I took the advice of another reviewer and doubled the sauce to pour over brown rice.  Also, I used thick cut pork chops.  My friend and I both were delighted with the recipe.  He absolutely raved about the sauce.  Served with a simple lettuce and tomato salad...so good!

Temporarily without an oven, so I cooked them in a cast iron pan with thickly sliced onion. The doubled sauce recipe was enough for five large chops plus plenty of drippings for mashed potatoes.  Definite redo, maybe next time in the oven :)

Flavor was OK but DO NOT COOK 30 minutes on each side.  Only need about 15 minutes per side.

The recommended temperature for pork chops was reduced to 145 degrees, but added a 3 minute rest time. I have used this new information and has resulted in a chop that is not as tough. 
"The USDA says the change does not apply to ground meats, including beef, veal, lamb, and pork, which should be cooked to 160 degrees. The safe cooking temperature for all poultry products, including chicken and turkey, remains 165 degrees Fahrenheit."

This was delicious and moist. I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce, so I substituted red wine vinegar instead. I also used Olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I covered with foil for the first half of cooking time. Loved it. My pork chops were thin, so I baked for a total of 40 minutes instead of a full hour. Will definitely make again!

These were really tasty. I used the pork chops I had on hand (4 really thin chops) and used the same measurements for the sauce. Instead of bushing the sauce on and adding it to the dish when baking, I opted to marinade my chops in the sauce for about 6 hours. At dinner time, I threw the chops and sauce into a Pyrex and baked for 20 minutes (on account of the thinness of the chops). They were perfect- flavorful and tender. I don't usually love pork, but I cleaned my plate for these! Thanks for a great and simple recipe!

Followed the recipe and doubled the sauce.  Pork chops came out terribly bland.  Sauce was good over rice.  Will not make this again.  I can't figure out how this recipe has so many good ratings.  We thought it was awful.  We actually threw away most of the pork chops because we couldn't eat them.

This was delicious!  My entire family devoured it...including the fussy eater in the house!  I am a very novice cook, but this was so easy.  I didn't have lemon juice, so I left it out.  I more than tripled the sauce recipe, which was great on potatoes.  And I added a little chopped onion and minced garlic to the sauce.  I covered the chops for 25 minutes, uncovered and did another 20 at 350, plus 3-4 minutes on broil per suggestions.  The pork was perfect - juicy, moist, and yummy!

Loved the sauce / marinade. came out dry and a lilttle tough. this could be from using old pork chops found in the freezer.  Will be trying this again on fresher pork chops. As well as reducing the cooking times a bit.   I did make extra marinade and used cornstarch to thicken it up after cooking was done.   All in all, this one is a keeper, at least for me.

After reading some of the reviews, I made this but used 1/2c brown sugar, 1/2c ketchup, and 1/4c of everything else, except lemon juice I used about 1/3 of the quarter - cup measure, trying to duplicate the exact recipe with more sauce,  without having to measure tons of tablespoons.  It was very tasty, if a little sweet, and there was plenty of sauce. Might cut the brown sugar down next time. Also, I think I would reduce the sauce a bit in a pan after cooking the chops. My husband was thrilled because the chops stayed moist - he hates dry pork. Served over rice with veggies on the side. Will definitely use this recipe again!

I had pork chops and just wanted to do something besides just bake...saw that I had every ingredient on hand except lemon juice, when I remembered that I had lemon pepper, so I used one tablespoon of that instead. It helped the sauce remain mixed, and I also served some of that sauce over white rice. Scrumptious!

I made three times the sauce, had some leftover.  I had thin chops, and cooked them for 25 minutes at 325° in Reynolds Oven Bags.  I had the large size, but it still took two.  I have already had my quota of evil pans for the month!  We ate it with long grain & wild rice and boiled carrots!

I made these for the first time last night. Using other reviewers' suggestions, I added a little jarred garlic to the sauce. I used four boneless  pork loin chops, which were approximately 1" thick. We have a good-size toaster oven and I baked the chops in it for 28 minutes total. I usually overcook pork, but not this time! My husband said they were cooked perfectly! I will make these again...doubling the sauce; using half as an actual marinade (for at least an hour) and the remainder to cook with.

So when reading recipes on here, I always ALWAYS look at the critical reviews. I'm glad I did, because this recipe as it is was not enough for 6 pork chops. Maybe the small thin ones? But not the larger butterfly ones (and especially not the bone in ones). I added some garlic and some teriyaki sauce to it, so it has a really nice rich flavor. It's a good quick marinade, so it's in the fridge for about an hour (give or take) before its grilled.

I followed the recipe just the way it was, with the exception of cooking at 325 degrees for an hour, and draining the juices from the pan when I flipped them at the 30 minute mark.  The flavor was awesome, and the pork chops tender and moist.  I will be making this again.

The sauce was too tangy for my liking so I added a little more brown sugar to make it sweeter.  I have no idea why the recipe said to cook the pork chops for an hour.  Mine were slightly overdone in a half hour, unless the recipe requires really thick pork chops.   At the end the pork chops were a little tough and the sauce was really thin and watery.  If this was used as an actual marinade to put the pork chops in for several hours, it might be okay.  I will try that next time.

Very tasty - I agree with others that the sauce should be doubled.  Also, I marinated the chops for a few hours beforehand.

Decent, not much flavor. Chops were over done when I checked  at 30 minutes when the recipe said to flip! I shudder to think what they woe've been like had I cooked the full 60 minutes!

Great recipe. I substituted apple cider vinegar in place of lemon juice because that is what I had.  I also followed others marinating it for a couple hours and cooking on 375  20 min per side then broil each side for 2-3 minutes. my chops were around 1 inch thick. Great.

I loved the flavor of this sauce. Cooking as instructed, the chops were a little overdone. Perhaps mine weren't as thick as the ones used in the original recipe? I'm definitely trying this recipe again...yum!

M-M-M-M   I had my adult son over for supper, and decided to try this. He inhaled it!  Took the left overs gladly.  I doubled the recipe for 4 chops.  I marinated for approx 2 hrs - turning every 30 minutes.  I added the some chopped onion, and 1 T. minced garlic.  This will go in our family cookbook!

This was excellent just as written. I tripled the marinade for 8 chops. I let it marinade for 24 hours then bbq'd them. These were absolutely delicious! Going to try this on ribs!!! Yummy!

The taste of the sauce was good, not amazing. A bit too sweet. I bought fairly thick loin pork chops. An hour at 350 is way too long. I checked them and removed them after 45 minutes and they were still very well done. The days of cooking pork that long are, fortunately, over. The author does state to cook to a temp of 145. After 45 mins, mine were over 160 even with less oven time. I like the fact that there is no flour or corn starch as I prefer to keep meals low carb. However, in the oven this sauce does not reduce and the chops are not really browned at all just cooked. 
If I make again , I would reduce the sugar and brown the chops first and cook the whole dish stove top  to reduce  the sauce and make it a little more of a glaze. I would remove the chops when cooked to medium or slightly less and continue to cook the sauce until reduced to more if a richer state. 
I did as other reviewers suggested make more sauce. I served  Shirataki noodles.   I try to follow a recipe as written, when making for the first time. Overall a good start but needs some adjustment. 
Thank you for sharing as it is always fun to try something different.

I had to double the amount for the marinade. My fiancee liked it way more than I did. I liked it, but he loved it. The pork smelled amazing in the oven, but it kind of made me nauseous when eating it. Not sure what that was about. It was cooked thoroughly; I'm just really picky about tastes.  I think most people would enjoy this, as the flavors meld really well.

The recipe sounds good and I have it in my recipe box, but what happened to the marinating. You just put the sauce over it and bake it and poor the other half on and bake until done. Marinating means to soak for a certain amount of  time.

Definitely double the sauce.  We used it as a marinade and then baked the pork chops in the sauce.  We did 2 large boneless pork chops in 35 minutes.

I have to say that initially I was very leery in making this marinade...but I was desperate not to have plain 'ol pork chops last night. I was pleasantly surprised! 

I doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did because it was just enough (I'm a sauce lover). I adjusted the cooking time just a bit because I only had two pork chops and they were  1 1/2 inches thick and bone in.  For the final stage of cooking, I poured on about 2 tbsp of marinade on top of each chop and put them under the broiler till the sauce caramelized. :)

We ate the chops with mashed sweet potatoes. It was a great meal and thanks for sharing your easy but delicious recipe!

Well, that was a waste of good pork chops. I knew an hour was way too long, but even after 45 minutes, the chops were so dry that the knife literally squeaked as I cut mine. The "marinade" tastes both boring and unpleasant, which is difficult to achieve.

I make this dish a lot! It's definitely a family favorite...I get requests for it at least twice a month. I always double the sauce ingredients...using half of it in the beginning and the other half at the 30 minute mark. A slight modification for me is to use orange juice instead of lemon juice. I also add a tablespoon of dried parsley to the sauce. The dish is great with white rice!

Super easy. Used thinner cut pork chops and turned oven up to 450 to cut cook time in half. Keto  diet substitutes stevia for the brown sugar and extra virgin olive oil for vegetable oil. Seasoned with oregano  garlic salt and cilantro

Pork Chops and ketchup. That's what it tasted like and I used less ketchup than the recipe called for. There was not enough marinade so I had to make extra. Very bad recipe.

Nice and simple, I did this with a thick porkchop that I had brined. Added a little Cumin and Garlic Powder but otherwise it's just fine as is.

Suggestions:
salt and pepper then add the sauce.
place on foil lined pan and then use a foil tent to keep moist.

The ONLY reason that this is getting a 4 star instead of a 5 is because the recipe doesn't call for salt and or pepper at all. SEASON SEASON SEASON SEASON!
Other than that , the ONLY change I made was that instead of an hour in the oven, I left them in for only about 50 minutes. I think had I left them in the extra 10 minutes, they would have started to get a little dry even with the foil tent.   
Now, from here on out, I followed the recipe to a "T" with the measurements.
I put the pork chops on a foil lined pan and then covered with foil to help keep them moist and boy oh boy did it work!!
Those chops came out tasting and looking so delicious!
NOTE:  if you are making more than 4 chops, I really think you need to increase the recipe for the sauce. 
I only made 2 chops  and what was left over didn't look like it would be enough for even 2 more really. 
So 2 - 3 chops = recipe is plenty
3 - 6 chops = double your recipe.

The sauce is tasty, but the bake time is entirely too long. I used bone-in, center cut chops that were a little thicker than average, but not the type labeled "thick cut." I believe 40-45 minutes would have been plenty of bake time. I might try the sauce again, but will probably just spoon it over sauteed chops or brush it on grilled chops during the last few mins of cooking. Would probably be great over chicken as well, or even as a stir fry sauce.

This was edible, but that's about all I can say about this. I have grilled, fried and shake-n-baked pork chops and they're all better than this. Sorry, but no trying this again for me or my family.

My mother followed this recipe and the chops were delicious, but we would like to know how a pirouette improves the flavour. ..or is it the moisture?

Quick, easy, and very tasty. I added that Korean hot sauce, (gochujang) for a little kick, but you don't have to use it. The chops were very moist. Will make again.

Each time I make it, the family wants more sauce. I'm up to 3 and 1/2 times the recipe for 4 thick cut pork chops. Sooooo delicious. I also took another reviewer's suggestion and bought a large pack of chops and split it into two dinners, frozen with the sauce.  I am not organized to remember to thaw it, so I cook from frozen for 30 minutes, turn them and then another 30 minutes. Works out great.

I loved the sauce! I'm not really a pork fan but i ate 2 whole chops! I will definitely make this again. I made a few changes out of what i had available, i used lime juice instead of lemon, and i used white sugar instead of brown. I will be trying the original next! So good.

I doubled the marinade because it looked like it would not be enough, it ended up being just enough.  I also poured all of the marinade on the chops and let them marinade about 3 hours prior to baking.  Maybe it is my oven which is only 2.5 years old, but, I checked them after 40 minutes and they were done, actually bordering on tough.  How could the submitter cook them for an hour?  My chops were between 1/2 and 1 inch thick.  The marinade was not too sweet.  This was a quick and easy recipe, will make it again.

Decent bbq style sauce recipe.  Not sure why it's called Marinated Baked Pork Chops.  Should be  BBQ  Sauce Glazed Baked Pork Chops.  But good results.  Everyone loved the chops.

It was decent but nothing special.  I made it as written and the sauce tasted fine, that is sweet,  but it didn't tenderize the meat, leaving the pork chop typically dry.  I used 3/4 inch thick chops.  Having said that, it was a quick and easy recipe and my husband enjoyed it.

**Under no circumstances** use that much oil.  I used half that and it was too much, I think it would have been better without any oil.  Other than that, I did not use Worcestershire sauce, and I added slightly more brown sugar and ketchup.  It was good, but would have been better without the oil.  Smells delicious when cooking!!  Also double the recipe if you have 6 pork chops.  Quadruple it if you want sauce for your rice.

I made this by the recipe. The sauce is good. The baking style in my opinion is where this goes wrong. Other than what sauce is left on top there wasn't much flavor that stuck. Next time I'll marinate the pork, maybe brown the chops with butter on the stove. Then bake shorter with additional sauce.

I made it for the first time with my family as the testers.  Everyone loved the chops!  I had 9 instead of the suggested 6 so by adding a little more of each of the marinade ingredients, it allowed for some dipping juice to be leftover.  The marinade has just the right amount of sweetness.  The chops were so juicy and delish.  I put aluminium foil over top for about 45 minutes and then took off the last 15 min.   Once they cooked for the full hour, I turned the broiler on low to give the tops of the chops a little crispness.  I will definitely makes these as a regular dish for my family.

Was looking for a simple marinade for pork chops; i don't make them very often. Will definitely make these again. Used olive oil instead of vegetable, cut sugar in half, and used 2 packets of spicy mustard (the kind you get with Chinese takeout) instead of ketchup. Marinated chops for several hours prior to cooking.  Sautéd mushrooms and onions in butter and worcestershire sauce to go with. Delish!

Overall a pretty good recipe.  For those of your who like a little more flavor though the next time I make it I will add some spices to the mix.  1 tsp pepper, 1/2 tbsp garlic powder, and 1 tbsp of Cajun seasoning.

The flavor was fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly for 4 chops and had plenty. I wish I had read the reviews before putting them in the oven. Or simply followed my instincts and covered them. (About 7 minutes in I pulled them out and covered them.) Ours were a little tough. Next time I'm going to try marinating them, as others have suggested, because we really liked the flavor.

Just okay. Husband liked it, I thought it needed something, maybe garlic? Next time I will use some of the sauce and marinate the  chops for an hour or so, then proceed as directed, with the addition of some garlic and  maybe a little more brown sugar.

I am new at this and thus followed the directions religiously.  The cooking time was too long and I burned the edges of the pork chops.  Also I believe these pork chops may have been thinner than normal and should have been cooked in less time.  The taste was OK, did not taste any strong tangy flavor I expected.  Again this may have been because the cook time was longer than it should have been.  I may try again later with thicker pork chops.

I made this last night for dinner. I agree with other reviews that you need to double the marinade, I had just enough for 5 large chops. I did season with garlic powder and seasoned salt lightly. They came out perfect in 30 minutes. This will be my go to recipe.

This was great. I did shake the pork chops in a bag with pepper, salt, paprika, and garlic powder. Doesn't seem necessary because the recipe itself is so flavorful.

We really enjoyed these, and they were ready in no time. SUper easy!!  The sauce is nice touch... enough for basting 3 large chops.  My son and husband aren't big on sauce, so this one was perfect.  Just enough to flavor, not overloaded.  They enjoyed them.  I only gave it 4 stars because the cooking time was way off.  I had 1-1/4" chops. I cut the cooking time in half, and it still was too much. Just keep an eye on their temp the first time you try them.  Next time I would try 10, 10, and a couple minutes under the broiler  like other reviewers have recommended.  Definitely will make again. Thanks for sharing!

The only change I made was to marinate the chops in the sauce for a few hours in the fridge. Tasty and simple!

I made it as the recipe said, but I didn't have but two pork chops, so I added 2 chicken breasts.  The sauce was good, but an hour was way too long.  Both chicken and pork chops were dry.  I will make again, but I'll probably cut the baking time down to 15-20 minutes on both sides.  I might also try to find a way to thicken the sauce a little.

This is a great recipe. I only tried it because I had all the ingredients but I'm glad I did. I made 2 changes, simply to suit my taste. I browned the pork chops after dredging them in seasoned flour and I substituted 1 tablespoon of sriracha sauce  for the catsup because I like a little kick. The flour made the sauce very thick , which I was fine with, but others might want to add more liquid

I will definitely make this again. 
I did let it marinate for about an hour or so before cooking, in the marinade I also put minced garlic and a little minced onion with a large chunk of onion. I then dumped the entire thing (marinade and meet and onion) into the baking dish, covered with aluminum foil for 80% of the cook time, added more sauce when I removed the foil. I ended up making way too much sauce because I love having more rather than less.
Also, I used very thin pork chops, (discounted pack at Albertsons) so I only made enough for one meal as I don't think it would have reheated well. And I used organic farmer's market ketchup which has a very different taste than traditional Heinz. 
But delicious all around!

A lot of recipes include the same ingredients, so I figured I'd give it a chance. To me, it tastes like a really thin BBQ sauce which I'm not really a fan of. It was too sweet for me.

Delicious! Was just a bit dry due to Extra Lean Pork. I would cook a little less. May 45 mins and check. 
Had brown rice, peapods & peppers sauteed in sesame oil. Added a little bit of salt and pepper but not much.

My 3.5 year old ate it all up as did my husband!

I have read and reread the recipe. Usually I am a decent cook and if I fail it is when I am winging it. At the 30 minute mark these were overcooked. My 9 year old couldn't chew through it. My chops were bone in just over an inch thick. I used a metal pan with tin foil under the chops for easy clean up... could that have caused this? I don't know but a waste of good meat.

The sauce is the star here. What I learned from this recipe is I need to get a better meat thermometer because that is really your true guide on time since this does not specify how thick the pork chops were and when I cooked mine for the recommended time they turned out overdone and tough.

I doubled the sauce recipe, halved the number of chops, and adjusted the cook time from one hour to 45 minutes which made this recipe pretty spectacular. The flavor is *marvelous* but I just didn't think the amount of sauce this recipe made was enough for three 1-in-thick pork chops, let alone six. I seasoned my three chops with salt and pepper, placed them in an 8x8 foil-lined metal pan, poured half the sauce on top, baked uncovered at 350 for 25 minutes, pulled them out and flipped them, poured the rest of the sauce on them, then popped them back in the oven for another 20 minutes. Overall, they turned out nice and juicy and the sauce was bomb.

Pretty yummy. I did add some Adobo seasoning first to the pork chops before covering the chops in the sauce. I doubled the recipe and put it on eight 1in thick pork chops.

My family all raved about these pork chops, telling me to do it exactly the same the next time. I did use bone in chops and, I put aluminum foil on the bottom of the baking dish, which made clean-up a breeze.

As others did, I increased the amount of the sauce, but only used 1 TBSP of oil.  My family enjoys a bit of heat with their meal so I added 1 heaping teaspoon of garlic & chili sauce.  I did not have time to marinate the chops, so I heated the sauce in the microwave to thicken it and make it adhere to the pork chops better.  We very much enjoyed this recipe.  While not followed completely, it gave a good starting point. Thank you for posting the recipe Kim

Mine came out bland following the recipe exact. All the glaze just melted off into the dish. I will try and and double the glaze and see if it can stick or soak in

I agree with most as I needed to practically triple the recipe to make enough sauce for my chops. I am feeding a family of 6! But I didn't change anything else. My family LOVES when I make this recipe and my daughter asked me to make these pork chops for her special birthday dinner!

I'm not a fan of pork but pork chops were on sale so I was looking for a recipe to try. This recipe was great! The meat turned out moist and tasty. Even my toddler ate it up. The only changes I made was based on other's suggestions to double the sauce recipe and to cover the chops for half of the baking time.

The marinade was very good. My only complaint is that the recipe calls for an hour in the oven at 350F (30 minutes for each side) to cook the pork chop to 140-145F. I had very thick chops and I checked the temperature with a probe ten minutes early and the meat was well over 200F and the chops were not tender as a result. The author apparently doesn't know anything about heat transfer and I really should have questioned this timing. I would recommend 15 minutes one one side, turn the chops over, and then monitor the temperature closely until the meat reaches the desired temperature.

I had rrecently made BBQ sauce from scratch and it had many of the same  ingredients. One of which was honey mustard, that was the perfect addition to this recipe. "Would  you happen to have any Gray  Poupon?"....."But of course ."( for those of us who used to watch T.V. With those things they called commercials....Ahh the good old days).

followed directions exactly, tho' Soy Sauce was lower sodium.  Baked 2 large 1 inch thick chops, after marinating them in the sauce for about 2 hours.  Re-coated with sauce before baking.  Covered pan with foil entire bake time.  

Tender, and juices from chops and steam from covering abut doubled the sauce.  Will make again.  Would be good on chicken too.

Fast, easy, and delicious! I will usually buy pork chops and freeze them with this sauce. When I take them out of the freezer I will make another fresh sauce to serve on the side. My family can't get enough of it!

I made this as directed. The only thing I did differently was to marinate it for a couple of hrs before baking. The chops were tender and juicy and had a very nice flavor. This is definitely a keeper.

Excellent!  I followed other recommendations and they came out very tender and juicy.  I tripled the soy, Worcestershire, lemon juice, brown sugar and ketchup.  Left the oil the same.  I marinated for 3 hours in 1/3 of the mixture.  When ready to bake I put them in a foil-lined pan, poured 1/3 sauce on top, and baked 20 minutes.  Turned them over and drained pan, poured remaining sauce on top and baked for an additional 20 minutes.  Then broiled for last 5 minutes.

I didn't use 6 pork chops , only 4. It gave it more flavor. At the end of the baking i let it broil for 2 min each side and it give it that crispy texture that i love.

I found this recipe last minute and decided to go with it. The marinade itself was fantastic how ever next time I will definitely double the recipe for 6 pork chops because I wish there was more. I also cooked the pork chops for about 40 minutes instead of an 30 on each side, but I guess that depends on the size of your pieces of meat. Overall fantastic recipe and I will definitely make again!

The chops I used were pretty thick so I made double the sauce (for 4 chops) and marinated them for about 10 hours, then made more sauce (single serving this time) and coated them before baking on both sides. I also added a couple cloves of minced garlic to the marinade and a little bit of crushed red pepper for spice! Delicious!

Tasty!  The sauce is not overpowering and added just enough flavor to the pork chops.  The only things I did differently was slightly brown the chops before putting them in the baking dish (with a sprinkle of salt and pepper) and added a little more lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce.  Baking time was only 30 minutes.  This is a keeper!

I made this tonight and it was a hit with the kids and the husband.  I boiled them first, and then baked them. They were so soft you didn't need a knife.

I followed the recipe  exactly except I used only 4 bone-in chops (about 1/2" thick).  I left them in the oven after turning the heat off to finish the rest of our meal - about 5-6 minutes; the sauce stayed on the pork chops.  My husband and I loved this dish.  The pork chops marinate during the baking time; they are tender and delicious!  Great flavor and so easy to prepare.  I will definitely make this regularly.

Delicious!  The only changes I made were to add some chopped fresh garlic, and kept it covered for the first 30 minutes of baking.  The sauce was kind of watery/soupy after cooking - but it flavored the pork chops nicely.  I'm going to try the sauce tonight with boneless chicken breasts.  Great recipe - easy,  has ingredients I always have on hand, and was told to "please make that recipe again!".

Made this last night, was looking for something that my kids could just put in oven and bake while I was working.  They loved it!  If I had been home would probably follow other suggestions and drain fat about half way through and add rest of sauce, but just cooking uncovered for 40 minutes was a yummy dinner for them.

Great recipe, in fact I'm making it right now. The timing depends on the size of chop, so I'm guesstimating. I added dried onion flakes and a bit of garlic this time, as well as a bit of garlic powder before the sauce. It tastes like something my Mom used to make. Definitely a keeper.

While I would not say this is "marinating"  in the traditional sense, it is still a tasty recipe.

This is my go to marinade.  I use it on the chops before I put them on my indoor grill.  Sticks to the meat beautifully.

First time I made it, I made it exactly as listed (except for tripling the sauce) and my family loved it!  The next time, I added grated garlic, toasted sesame oil and ginger.  It was even better.  Thank you to all of the previous reviewers for the good suggestions!

As other reviewers suggested, I tripled the sauce because I like it to coat the rice I serve with it too. I had five pretty thick cut boneless chops so I sliced them in half making ten thinner chops, another reason for tripling the sauce. I also added two large cloves of fresh minced garlic. I put HALF of the sauce in a gallon sized Ziploc bag with the ten thin sliced chops, and saved the remainder of the sauce to pour over the chops when I flipped them in the oven.  I squished the air out of the bag and squished the chops around to coat well.  I marinated them over night to have for dinner the next night.  I poured the chops with the marinade in the 9x13 dish and cooked at 350 for 30 minutes.  Then I flipped them over and poured the reserved marinade over the top of the chops and continued to cook for another 28 minutes while I cooked the Asian Coconut Rice (also from this site), and steamed broccoli.  When they were done, I took them out and let them sit for 2-3 minutes.  These were AWESOME over the rice with all that yummy gooey sauce!  Will definitely make this again.

I cook for a camp of 20 - 25 blokes in the Northern Territory, Australia. They really liked this - I cooked way more chops than I needed to and there was only one left!
I quadrupled the sauce, poured it over the chops in the trays and let it sit for an hour before I covered and cooked them (turned once halfway). I also added some slices of green cooking apples throughout the tray which baked nicely.
Next time I might add a bit of 'bite' like sweet chilli or something for another level to the flavours. Great sauce!!

This recipe is delicious! I followed the advice of another user and tented the pork chops with foil for the first 30 minutes of baking, and they turned out ridiculously juicy. Also, I usually double the marinade since I make about 5 chops at a time.

marinated two chops, then baked at 350  for about 20 minutes per side, covered pan with foil so sauce wouldn't dry out. Spooned sauce from baking pan over rice, too

I loved these! The only problem was that my mother kept sneaking into the kitchen and trying to eat all my sauce before i could use it. The only thing I did differently was exclude the ketchup because no one in our house likes it. They still turned out great and they're super easy to make, even for a beginner.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and honestly I thought it was just ok.  It wasn't bad and the pork chops were tender but the sauce wasn't excellent to where I have to make it again.  My boyfriend really liked it, but his daughter was with me and thought it was just ok.

Fantastic ! Nice simple recipe like I like. I love to make them verbatim when I can. I only went with another Tbsp ketchup and added a couple Tbsp good BBQ sauce. Then after cooking in a casserole dish I  took out the chops and added 2 Cups cooked rice to the juices and the pan scrapings and laid the chops back on top the rice and cooked another 15 min and served. Awesome dinner!! Thank you for sharing it. G.

Really good.  I marinated it overnight, and I added Coleman's mustard and about 5 cloves of minced garlic to the marinade.  We like garlic at our house...  I baked them for the full hour, and will probably do it 45-50 minutes next time, but there WILL be a next time.  This was easy and delish!  While the chops rested, and I did the sides, I poured the sauce into a small sauce pan and added some cornstarch and thickened it up.  Mighty good stuff!!!  The fam likes it!

These were great and I felt it was plenty of sauce.  I don't think the recipe is intended to be a sauce for the chops to be swimming in, but rather a glaze.   I usually have poor luck cooking pork chops but this recipe was perfect!!!  For a little extra zing, try using jalapeno flavored ketchup!

Very good sauce. The only change I made was to add garlic, as I needed my garlic fix.  That is the only change I made in ingredients, but 1 hour total cooking time is WAYYYYY too long.  I cooked 30 minutes, and next time will cut that down to 20 or 25 minutes unless I have very thick chops.  I think some people still tend to overcook pork.. I prefer mine moist.

These were good.  After reading some of the other reviews, I knew I was going to have to at minimum double the recipe for the sauce, so I did that, but did not add any additional oil and there was barely enough to cover my 4 pork chops.  As it cooked, it became very runny and didn't stick to the chops.  My chops were a little on the thinner side, so I tried cooking for 20 min on each side, but I think that was still too long since they were a little dry.  The sauce had great flavor but it was the consistency of water.  I think next time I will marinade the chops all day and then add some additional ketchup and brown sugar to hopefully thicken the sauce a bit.  Another option would be to use the broiler for a few minutes, like several others did.

We are not big on pork chops, however with the price of beef, we're eating pork chops and this recipe is excellent! My wife and I thought the mix of ingredients seemed odd, but it works great! We used the recipe the 1st time exactly as written, in the oven, was wonderful. We used the sauce on 3 pork chops, obviously applying the sauce much more generously then the recipe calls for. The 2nd time we marinated the 3 pork chops for 6 hours in half the sauce and then cooked them on the bbq. I applied some of the remaining sauce as I cooked and the remainder I put on the table to add to our rice or pork! A simple recipe that works, try it....well worth it!

Since it was my first time, I followed the recipe.  I used low salt soy sauce, though, as it was on hand.  Not at all too salty (and I'm on a low salt diet).  It was okay and I will use this recipe again, but with double the brown sugar, and will add a tablespoon of maraschino cherry juice for an extra flavorful punch and added color.

I made this, doubling the marinade/sauce part for two chops and let it sit for four hours before baking. It was okay, but didn't get raves in our house. I doubt I'll make it again. Seemed like I could have done just as well with a pre-made, bottled BBQ sauce. Sorry

Awesome tasting pork chops. I followed the recipe except I used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil. Pork chops were good and tender and very flavorful.

I was not a fan of this.  I think the pork needs to sit a bit to actually have the marinade work it's way into the meat a bit.  I found it very bland.  For my oven 45 minutes would have been better.  We found it way too dry and overdone.

I added one teaspoon of Siracha to the sauce.  I only made two pork chops but used the same amount of sauce ingredients as written in recipe.  Served with rice.  We enjoyed this recipe very much.

I doubled the recipe as I had more chops and it was perfect. It's a super quick, excellent marinade using all ingredients most of us have on hand. Perfect last minute marinade.

I normally do not care for pork chops but these were amazing! And so easy! My husband and kids said it was one of the best things I have ever made. I used bone-in loin chops. Will make this again very soon.

The sauce is very tasty. I read that vinegar can be used as a substitution for lemon juice. I used half a teaspoon of rice vinegar.  Also, I only had 4 pork chops that were maybe an inch thick. I put them in for 30 min. then flipped them, and after 10 more minutes, I decided to take them out.  They were very tender  and not dry! Next time I think I'll flip after 15 minutes and cook for another 15 so they will be more moist. 

Also, I had just enough sauce for 4 chops. If I had more I would need more sauce.

Made as written, I would give 4 stars.  I took other reviewer's suggestions on doubling the recipe - glad I did!  Also, I replaced the ketchup with chili sauce.  The only other (and big) change I made was I added 2 envelopes of onion soup - glad I did that too! It enhanced the flavor nicely.  I will definitely make this again, but will try to allow time for marinading the meat in the recipe first.  It was fine without, but the flavor definitely had not penetrated the meat, and was limited to the outside.  I will try this with chicken too!

To be totally honest, it was edible, but I didn't care for the taste at all. The one bright side of this recipe; however, is that the pork was still very juicy.

Made this for my husband and I.  I loved the flavor, and he was happy with it as well.  But it was WAY overdone.  The only thing that made the pork chops succulent was the fat that I DIDN'T trim.  I was in a hurry, and although I am all about following the recipe, I threw the chops in before realizing I hadn't trimmed them.  They were dry.  But they were thin chops and I had some idea that they would probably be cooked too long.  I should follow my intuition.

The recipe looked intriguing so I tried. I actually put in the slow cooker to save room in the oven for au gratin potatoes. The chops were simply fabulous, even better reheated the next day. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

I made this exactly the way it read and it was amazing! My pork chops were cooked through and very delicious. Next time I am doing 2 things differently: 1) having the marinade on the night before to get more flavor and 2) draining the liquid after the first 30 minute cook time because it spilled over in my oven.

Delicious. Not quite enough marinade for 6 chops unless you're extremely sparing. I recommend 4 or at most 5 porkchops instead of the 6 in the recipe. I also recommend pinning the porkchops before marinating them, to get the flavour more fully inside. Otherwise you're left with a delicious exterior with a moist but flavourless interior.

It came out really well. I found that the marinade was not quite enough so you will need to increase the amount, but it's very good. 

Used some garlic powder in marinade, didn't have lemon juice. Put some bread crumbs on top, seasoned the pork.

The recipe was great, but I burned the pork chops after only 20 minutes in the oven as directed. Just be careful to watch closely. Luckily they were still edible .

I tripled the sauce for 4 very large bone-in pork chops.  It was a perfect amount (with a little left over)after using it over rice.  The chops were a hit also!  This is a great tasting marinade.  I would also consider using on chicken.

After reading the recipe, I looked at the reviews.  I read so many suggestions and decided on a marinade variation that another reviewer had posted.  The marinade I used was 2 Tbsp of olive oil, 4 Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce, 4 Tbsp of lemon juice, 6 Tbsp of brown sugar, 3 Tbsp of ketchup, 3 cloves of garlic 4 Tbsp of vinegar.  I omitted the soy sauce since I didn’t have any.  I marinated the boneless pork chops (1” thick and eight of them) for about six hours I cut up two small onions and layered one of them on the bottom of a 13 x 9 pan.  I put on the pork chops and the marinade. Put the other onion on top. I covered it with aluminum foil. Cooked it at 350 and I flipped the pork chops over every fifteen minutes.  I did that because so many people said that their pork chops came out so dry.  It did take an hour for my pork chops to be done.  I did try to broil the pork chops for the last 10 minutes (doing both sides of the chops); since many people said that, this would thicken up the sauce.  It didn’t work which was fine, since it was tasty anyway.   I paired it with boiled potatoes and Green Bean Casserole.   

I invited my family to come and try this new recipe with me.  Okay, okay, I admit, I was using them as taste-testers.  My family liked this recipe, as did I.  A few minor things that I would change from what my family suggested.  First, I would to make a sauce from the leftover juice.  I would drain it and reduce it 50% (which I did read as a suggestion from someon

This was so flavorful! I used 1" thick pork tenderloin and baked it about 10 minutes longer because of the thickness. I covered with foil the entire cook time but turned on broil, opened up the foil and it was perfect. Amazingly, I had every ingredient except lemon juice so substituted orange juice and doubled the sauce. So tender and yummy. Enough sauce remaining to use as dip for the pork. In my favorites!!

My family loved this! I tripled the recipe because other reviewers said they didn't have enough sauce, but I ended up with too much, so I would only double the recipe next time. The extra cooked sauce in the pan was great over rice. Can't wait to make this again!

I made this exactly as the recipe reads and it was awful. I went back to look at the reviews and realized most of the 5 star reviewers changed either the way they cooked it, or the ingredients. If you have to change the recipe its not worth 4 or 5 stars. Complete waste of time and ingredients.

Tasty sauce, but the suggested cooking time (30 + 30 minutes) in a 350 degree oven is much too long!  I thought there had to be an be an error, so I checked the chops at 15 minutes and they already registered an internal temperature of 145!   I will definitely use this recipe again, but I'll check the temperature after the first 10 minutes.

With just a little tweaking this is easily a five star recipe! After reading other reviews I doubled the recipe, used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I still used the ketchup but added a teaspoon of garlic chili sauce and two teaspoons of minced garlic. I used low-sodium soy sauce so I could add a few drops of fish sauce. It balanced the flavor to near-savory perfection! I also covered the chops to retain moisture~ I will definately do this again!!! Would be a great grilling sauce.

The flavor was great on these but I only made 3 for my family and still cooked one hour.  They came out dry.  Will definitely make again but will reduce cook time a bit to make sure they stay moist.

This was way too sweet for my liking. If I make it again, I'll cut the brown sugar in half and add some hot sauce (like Franks) to it before cooking. It definitely needs some heat or more acid to cut through the sweetness.

I used the whole recipe for 3 thick pork chops and the amount was about right, allowing extra juice to drizzle on meat or side dishes after serving.  We had the chops with baked butternut squash and sauerkraut.  Delicious!

I make the marinade with no changes.  As others did, I double the recipe.  My pork chips are thick - salt and pepper and fry quickly on both sides.  Then bake as the recipe suggest.  My family loves these pork chops!  Even my very picky 9 year old girl.

My husband could not get enough of this dish! As others have suggested, I doubled the sauce for four boneless pork chops. I also used Penzey's spices as a rub, then browned the chops before baking. I tend to burn water, but this recipe was easy to follow and left a dish that, according to my husband, you'll be craving to make again and again!

I made this following the directions minus the lemon juice because I didn't have any.  They tasted very good but I had thin pork chops and ended up overcooking them and they were very tough.  I will definately be trying this again, but next time I will use my slow cooker and I will be making a lot more of the marinade.

Between the ketchup and the brown sugar the sauce was just too sweet. If I make this again I'll cut down on one or the other (or both).

Totally yum!  I bumped the oven up to 400 for the last 30 minutes, though, so the meat would brown.  The medium thickness chops were moist and delicious.  A new favorite!

The whole family really enjoyed this recipe. I had 4 bone in pork chops & I had to double the sauce recipe. Pork chops can tend to get dry for me but these were juicy and flavorful. Also, a note on the sauce, my mom uses something very similar to this for meatloaf and for baked chicken. Very simple and versatile. I will definitely make this again.

The sauce is great and easy to make/improvise.  I generally don't have 1 hour to wait on anything to cook, so I threw these in the Crock Pot with the sauce on low for most of the day.  They were flavorful and delicious, and I will make them again.

I really enjoyed the pork chops. I covered the dish with aluminum foil when cooking to prevent it from drying out. And I made double the sauce. I will definitely be making it again. My husband loved it,

This was so good.  Only things I did differently was tripling the sauce and marinating the chops in the sauce in a heavy duty Ziploc bag.  I left chops and sauce in frig all day.  I didn't use the leftover sauce because raw pork was in the sauce.  I will be making this again.   Hubby liked it.

I followed the recipe to the T, aside from doubling the sauce. The flavor of the sauce was great, however it was extremely thin and runny, and didn't really coat the pork chops when you pulled then out. Also, the pork chops were extremely dry, had to cut them up and then soak them in the brothy-style sauce. Then it tasted pretty good.

It was tasty but the chops were dry.  I think I should have covered them with foil.  Maybe American pork chops are thicker than what I can get here in Germany.  So, next time, I will cover them and probably cook them for a shorter time.

This is a basic sauce with ingredients you probably already have.  I substituted a flavored (garlic and chili) olive oil instead of the veg oil. Added some minced garlic and onion. Everyone enjoyed these, including guests, telling me to add it to the make again list.

I made this tonight in the convection toaster oven in a tray with a rack in it and it was excellent. I used the "sauce" more like a baste and not a "sauce" even though you can use it as such as in the video. I just a coated the top. This basically helps seal in juices and giving it a chance to brown more. It aso helps from having the chops boil in the sauce, which I don't like. I first poked my chops all over with a fork to get the flavors inside. I only topped the chops and turned and top coated the other side halfway through cooking time. I like a little more caramelization so I broiled each side for 5 mins, 10 mins before the end time. Delicious.

I absolutely loved this dish. The sweet glaze was perfectly done and I had no leftovers! My only critique is maybe cooking it for 5-10 minutes less, as the pork was thin and came out slightly over-done. I also tented the tray with tinfoil. Otherwise, I highly recommend this dish. It is super tasty and easy to make.

Extraordinary!  I didn't believe these would be so fabulous... after all, how could they be when the ingredients were so easy, the prep time was so fast, and the meat didn't soak in marinade for hours?  I was so wrong!  The meat was tender, I almost feel guilty for doing so little work for such a great result, and there was no need to change any of the ingredients or amounts.  Way to go Kim- hope you provide many more like this!

This was a good dish for a weeknight, quick and easy to make.  The sauce was sweet, and better than the bottled stuff that you can buy. The only change I made was that I brined my chops for a hour prior to cooking so that they wouldn't be dry. I do suggest to double the sauce since it was barely enough for the 4 chops that I cooked. Overall, very tasty!

I was looking for something quick and easy and this sure fit the bill!  Quite tasty!  I doubled the sauce (I had 5 thin pork loins) .    I covered the dish with alum foil, baked  30 minutes then uncovered for about 10 more at 375.   I made white rice and substituted a few tablespoons of water with  sauce so the rice would have the same flavor of the meat.  Yes, I will definitely make it again.

I tried the mix as directed, and liked it. I then tried it another way. I adjusted the amounts of the mix ingredients, with the exception of the oil. 2 tbsp of soy, 2 tbsp oil, 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice, 3 tbsp brown sugar, 3 tbsp ketchup. By doing this, it increases the thickness of the sauce, and reduced the temperature to 275° for 20 minutes per side for thinner chops. They turned out very well.

Loved this. Family devoured it. Made it exactly as written. Going to try letting the meat marinate in the sauce for a few hours before cooking next time for extra flavor. Planning to try it on some chicken next.

I doubled the sauce as some people suggested but I'm not sure that would have been necessary for my 6 large boneless chops.  The sauce was very runny after the first 30 minutes in the oven so I drained it all out of the pan before flipping the chops and pouring the remaining sauce over the chops.  Going forward, I will omit the oil from the sauce recipe.  I also think I will add fresh minced garlic as other cooks suggested.

Would definitely make again. My 2 and 4 year olds ate it up, and they are PICKY with meat. I added a dash of apple cider vinegar and added 1 tbsp of bbq sauce. I marinated for one hour, and used 3 boneless pork chops from Wegmans and cooked at 350 for 30-35 minutes and they were perfect!  I reduced part of the left over marinade and added 1 tbsp of butter as a sauce.

I love it!!! Made 4 regular thickness pork chops so I tripled the marinade recipe to make sure I had plenty (other reviews say how good it is). Glad I did because I have enough to try with chicken breast! Also, I cut the bake time down to 40 minutes which was fine but next time I think I'll cut it down to 30 minutes.

These chops were delicious!  Very flavorful and juicy!  I didn't change any of the ingredients but I did bake them at 325 for 25 minutes in my convection oven (2X).  You really need to double, triple or even quadruple the sauce ingredients if you are planning on using it as a topping for rice, etc.  I doubled the sauce recipe for seven chops and there was not enough for anything else.  That being said, these were some of the best pork chops I've ever made and they got rave reviews! ??

I made this recipe with bone in chops and without changing anything.  My family LOVED them. So simple to make, too. I wrapped leftovers in Saran. The next day I had them at room temp and they were as moist as the night before. Truly a delicious meal the first and second day.

Added garlic powder. Doubled the sauce. Baked 375 for 20 min each side and broiled a few mins for crispy outside. May marinade it a few hrs next time.

I've made this recipe twice. The  first time I made it, the chops came out dry, but flavorful. The second time I used a meat thermometer and they came out great. Everybody loved them. I don't know why everybody is all hung up on the "marinade" part. I think this recipe should not be entitled "marinated baked chops" and simply "delicious baked chops." That way maybe everybody can relax.

This is our favorite recipe for pork chops! However, I double the sauce and only use 2 chops.  I also don't marinade. I pour a little on the top before baking and again when I flip, and save the majority of the sauce for dipping.

I did not make any changes to the original recipe. I like to make new recipes just the way they are presented then I make changes if I feel some are needed. My husband and I like this recipe and I will make it again but the next time I will either reduce the baking time some or cover the dish with foil. The pork chops were a little dry but otherwise this is  keeper. Enjoy

I liked the recipe, but didn't love it! I made the pork chops with the exact ingredients listed. I did make 3 times the amount of sauce based on other reviews, and I marinated the pork chops for about 3 hours prior to baking. After baking for 30 minutes, I flipped the chops and added more sauce (which I had cooked and reduced to thicken after marinating.)  they were very tender, but something was off with the taste of the sauce to me.  I will try it again, but make changes to the sauce ingredients.

Really good sauce recipe! I have VERY picky kids and husband and all liked this recipe.  Only thing I changed was doubling sauce recipe and after baking for 1/2 hr (my chops were thin) I put them under the broiler for about 5 minutes to carmelize the sugar and add great flavor.

First of all, I was struck by the fact that this pork isn't marinated. I baked my 1-inch thick pork loin chops for twenty minutes on each side.  They were like leather.  Only the sauce made them edible.  The sauce is okay, but nothing special.  I would recommend putting in spice of some kind: oregano, creamed horseradish, or garlic to spice it up.

This was delicious!! Better than expected. We added a tablespoon of siracha because it tied in with our side dish. Perfectly sweet and spicy. Even my very picky 7 year old loved it.

It is necessary to increase the sauce.  I let them set all night in the sauce and baked  them for three hours at 250 degrees while I was away.  Everyone liked them.  I didn't have any soy sauce so I used teriyaki sauce.  This is a keeper.  I know I will make it many times more.

I tried a different pork chop recipe and it didn't come out as well, so I thought I'd try one where I marinate them first instead of fry them.  And it didn't disappoint.  The sauce was great, perfect blend of sweetness with the  tartness of the lemon juice.  And I paired it with some vegetables and mashed potatoes, great dinner.

The thickness of the chops was NOT specified. Nor was it specified bone-in or boneless. I used 1.5 inch thick bone-in chops, and I quadrupled all the ingredients (except for the sugar and the oil). I had six chops, and that was more than enough sauce.  It was a thin sauce.  I baked them for 30 minutes and they were almost done. I put more sauce on and let them bake for about 5 more minutes. I did NOT turn them over. They were pretty good.  I think it is an easy recipe. I probably could have merely doubled the sauce instead of quadrupling it.  I would make this again.

Made exactly as described except for halved the oil per other reviewers.  Huge hit and now a staple in our home.  I would minimum double, triple, even quadruple the marinade.  Next time I will actually marinade overnight.  Thanks for a great recipe.  You're making me look like a great cook to my new husband!

Easy and delicious. My chops were a little thinner so I didn't have to cook them as long. definitely line your baking pan for easy clean up. Can't wait to try this recipe over the BBQ. PS substituted 1 T purchase maple syrup for the brown sugar.

Very good and flavorful.  Used boneless pork loin and the chops were a little dry but that's my fault for over baking them.  Will watch more closely next time.

It's hard to get my kids to eat their meat, but this is ALWAYS a hit with them. There's never a single bite left on their plate. I like to dip the entire chop in the sauce, then put a little on top before baking and flip over half way through and add sauce on top again. Very flavorful!

Tried this recipe and my honey devoured three pork chops instead the two intended for him. I used the recipe but used grey poupon mustard instead of lemon juice . I baked it on both sides for 15 minutes each and then caramelized the chops in a pan with the remaining sauce! Soooo delicious!

The flavour in the sauce was good; I didn't add any extra spices. The pork chops I had were pretty thin and they were fully cooked after 20 minutes. Next time, I will try marinating the chops in the sauce first and try using a thicker chop.

I made this recipe for my hubby last week and we both loved it! We did double the sauce recipe - and glad we did because it was very tasty! Served with rice and a side of roasted parmesan broccoli it was a perfect (and super easy) week night dinner. The only thing I changed was that I left out the Worcestershire sauce but only because we didn't have any. Thank you to the poster :)

Very tastey. I tripled the sauce recipe but not the amount of oil when I did it and used half brown sugar & half honey . I forgot to put in the soy sauce and it was fine without it , but will put it in next time . Let them marinate for a couple hours . I poured all the sauce in the pan with the pork chops covered with tin foil and let them do their thing . They were very tender and moist

Delicious flavor!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, next time I will bake for 20min each side and check the temp, 30min was too long for 4 out 5 of the chops.

It tasted better with some brown gravy on top. Tasted to plain with just the pork chops. If I do make it again I'll have to make sure I have gravy with it again.

Just food this recipe, and I absolutely love it!, I did add a few things, I double the sauce, and added onions. I also covered it with foil for the first 30minutes, then took the foil off and cooked it uncovered for 20 minutes more.I will differently make this again.

Liked the marinade a lot, I just added one other thing to it, a tiny bit of cayenne pepper. My family likes spicy and this certainly added a little of that element to it without turning out to be overwhelming. And yes the sauce, I had to double the amount as it just wasn't enough even for three pork chops. ??

Great flavor, definitely need to soak the chops in the marinade for an extended period of time before baking.

This is without a doubt a favorite in my home!  I do 2x as much brown sugar until its more of a paste and we love it.  My husband was excitedly surprised at the taste, my teenager asked for 2nd's and the little ones even ate it too!!!! I make this at least 2x a month, we've worked it into the rotation!

An easy-to-prepare and tasty recipe. I made the sauce as indicated, only adding chopped onion before putting the chops in the oven. Cooking pork chops for an hour seemed too long, so I used a thermometer, and they were done in just over 30 minutes. I took the advice of several reviewers and after the cooking time, drained most of the juice and broiled the chops for a few minutes. A good meal.

I've made this three times now and each time I was told by my family and best friend how delicious it was. I use kosher salt and cracked black pepper to season the thick center cut chops I use. I also multiply the sauce times 6...trust me, you will want the extra to add when you plate your dinner. Separate the sauce in two bowls so the one you may want for the table isn't contaminated by raw pork if you use a brush to baste.

The family loved it. I did wrap a piece of bacon around the boneless chop. I also cover the chops and let them in the oven turned off just to soak up the juices for about an hour or two. Enjoy!

Love the marinade. I did as other reviewers said and made the full amount of marinade for two chops.I marinated them for several hours before cooking and instead of baking in oven cooked them on the charcoal  grill. I will make them again and plan to use the marinade on beef and chicken.

Excellent, my only critiques are that it's not a marinade, just a sauce and it might be a tad too sweet. I would suggest using approx 3/4 the amount of brown sugar.

Tried it as written. Something wrong with quantity of ingredients list ! It will not cover six chops, also 30 minutes each side will not cook them properly. Two and a half hours at 350 would be the least I would use. The sauce is nice, but inch / inch 1/4 won't be ready in one hour. Two stars only for sauce.

Delicious! I used 3 thick boneless pork chops and took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the marinade. I used half to marinate the chops for a few hours prior to baking. I baked at 375 for 15-20 minutes per side, added a bit more marinade after I turned them and then broiled for 3 minutes at the very end. I added the last bit of marinade right before broiling. The chops turned out perfectly! My husband said he thought they were the best chops I ever made. Can't wait to make this again!

Thumbs up from the hubs and I! I had thinner chops so I baked for 25 minutes at 375. Turned and basted again, baked for 10 minutes and then broiled for 5 minutes. The sauce...delicious! The chops...juicy! Together....amazing! After the first bite my husband said to make sure I save this recipe. He ended up eating two for dinner.  We had only 2 left for leftovers and he is sad I am going to take one for lunch tomorrow because he'll only have one, lol!

My husband isn't crazy about pork chops, but loved this recipe! I think the folks who rated it low because there wasn't enough sauce should read the poster's notes. "Kim" adds the caveat that she makes extra sauce for rice. I added onions, just because I love them, but we al enjoyed the different, delicious taste on chops.

Added minced garlic and skipped the oil. Sprinkled some parmesan and crashed black pepper over each side. Grilled chops in 'grill 2 convection' oven. Each side for 15 min. Served with mashed potatoes and spinach+tomatoes salad. We loved it. Would do it again.

Tried this recipe for dinner & it came out pretty good. My kids wouldn't eat it but they don't eat anything haha but hubby & I thought it was good. I did double the marinade recipe & put a little over half in a bag with the 4 boneless pork chops then I used our vacuum sealer to seal it & put it in the fridge for 4 hours. I then used the remainder of the sauce to brush on the top of the pork chops half way through the cook time & the rest my husband used to dunk his chops in.(This sauce was not used on the raw pork chops, it was placed in a separate dish once made & placed in the fridge.)

This was a great hit with me and my boyfriend. I made it tonight and he cleared his plate completely. 
I gave it 4 stars because I found the sauce to be too watery once cooked, and I had to add a few things to make the sauce taste better .
I added 1tbsp apple juice, 3 garlic cloves (crushed), 1 tbsp black pepper, 1 tbsp ACV and one half an onion grated. 

Next time I will be adding 1 or 2 tablespoons of corn starch or flour to help it thicken up a bit. Will be marinating over night as well. 

All in all a great recipe that is easy to make and the sauce is very easy to adjust to your personal preference.

I used this marinade for pork and chicken and it is awesome. I personally used 1 tbs of brown sugar instead of 2 because 2 was a bit sweet. Also, I found that the recipe, as written, only worked for 2 pork chops or about 6 chicken tenderloins, so I recommend doubling or tripling the ingredients for any more than that. Lastly, I let the meat marinate in the sauce overnight--awesome! The picture is last night's dinner--chicken, carrots, and onion all baked in the sauce, rice and peas on the side. Enjoy!

My two very picky boys gobbled this up. They both have textural aversions and aspergers disorder so getting them to eat "saucy" foods are a challenge, but I had them help me make this dish and they both really enjoyed it! Can't go wrong with ketchup and brown sugar to please picky eaters.

The first time I tried this, I did double the sauce and marinated for a few hours before cooking. Silly me didn't adjust the time since I was using thin boneless chops, so most of the chops were dry and/or overcooked. The second time I used this marinade, I prepared it for thick boneless loin chops doing everything the same. I had a much better end result! I did use Rice Wine Vinegar in place of the oil.

I doubled the recipe for the sauce and that gave me plenty for 6 pork chops. The flavor of the pork was fantastic! There was quite a bit of juice in the bottom of the pan. Next time I think I'll try starting them in a pan to lock some of the juice in.

Good recipe.  I agree this IS a marinade, however your not marinating your meat.  Just cooking with it.  The title of this recipe should be reworded.  I agree with others there is no way this is enough for 6 pork chops.  I made it with 2 because its just my husband and I and it was JUST enough.  Anymore chops and it wouldn't have been enough.  Good flavor though.  Really good.  We loved it.  I will probably use olive oil next time though.  I try to cut down on vegetable oil when I can.

Three stars is generous for how my husband and I felt about this recipe. The pork chops I used were center cut and about 1/2" thick.  Even though only cooked for half an hour, they were tough and dry and we didn't think the sauce was anything special either.

This was excellent but the cook time and measurements for the sauce are way off. I only baked them for 15 minutes on each side, and the internal temperature was 170 when I took them out. They were dry and a bit tough, but still tasted great (so I can only imagine how good they are when they are not over cooked!). I wanted to put them under the broiler to help the sauce stick (I had the same problem many others did with the sauce running off), but they were already over cooked. I only had enough sauce for 2 pork chops (I was only making 2, so that wasn't a problem). Next time I will reduce the oil to 1 TBSP, as others suggested. Hopefully this will make the sauce less runny. I will try reducing the cooking time and put under the broiler for the last 5 minutes.

My chops were dry and tough.  Didn't like the sauce either.  Total disappointment, except they did smell and appear good.  Neither one of those things count like taste and texture.

I should have known. The cooking time was too long. I overcooked the chops. Though they were still tasty, they would have been far better if they hadn't been overcooked. I'm not blaming the recipe writer; each oven is different and ours usually cooks things faster than most. Next time, I'll turns the chops at 25 minutes and check them again at 45 minutes. I could have also used a thermometer. That's what I get for multitasking, packing and cooking at the same time.

IF YOU USE BONELESS pork chops, only cook for 20-30 minutes MAX! I had four boneless pork chops (thick cut but not too thick) and I cooked them for 30 minutes at 375 and that was too much. I doubled the recipe for the sauce and marinated it for about an hour. It tasted great except for the pork being over done.

I quadrupled the sauce like another reviewer and added white wine vinegar (I didn't have rice wine vinegar). I marinated the chops for 5 hours and cooked them on a raised grate. I reduced the marinade, but added another 1/4 of brown sugar and the pan drippings. It came out really good.

This was really good!  The marinate is deffinately a new taste for us and we have tried many.  I chunked up a piece of porkloin as I didn't have any chops.  Yummy!!!  Will keep this recipe for my porkloin only.  I also added about a tbsp of onion flakes.  I thought my sauce would have had a thicker consistency at the end of the cooking time but nonetheless it was still very tasty.  We poured it over rice and some of our veggies.   I will absolutely make this again!!

This was great with a minor change.  My chops were very thin, so I seared them in a pan, then added the sauce and let it simmer in the pan until done.

This was really good!!  I tried to make it a little healthier by using applesauce instead of oil (which you can sub for oil in practically everything), low sodium for both the Worcestershire and soy sauce.  I agree that broiling for a few minutes to thicken the sauce is a must!   Also, marinating for a few hours or overnight makes them even better!

I love the sauce. However, there is nearly not enough!! In order to consider this recipe marinated, you must actually marinate it. I placed the pork chops in a shallow baking dish covered in half of the sauce for about 4 hours. Then I baked them in the oven as instructed. I would definitely recommend tripling the sauce as it is not enough.

Pork chops were juicy! Marinade was thin, but it tenderized the chops very well. Also, did not need an hour to cook. Only about 40 minutes at 350. Very good flavor. Will make this again.

The sauce was delicious and just the right amount for 3 thick pork chops.  Should have checked the internal temperature though.  An hour was too long and the meat was a little dry.

I followed the recipe to the T, with the exception of adding 2 tablespoons of golden rum.  I tasted the marinade prior and felt it was lacking substance.  With the addition of the rum I believe it was good, however my son wouldn't eat it.  :(

We used the ingredients to create a marinade as others suggested, but the end result was little better than "meh."

My "sauce" ended up very watery which made the chops taste pretty bland. I think marinating the chops ahead of time is the way to go and will do so next time. I really like the flavors in the sauce but wouldn't do this recipe again.

This is not really marinated, it was more of a BBQ pork chop.   Not sure I will do this recipe again in the near future,  as my family really enjoy my pork chops pan friend in a tiny bit of olive oil and a light dusting of flour and spices.

OMG....DELISH!!!  My family LOVED these - including my 8 year old who does not like pork chops said these were awesome!  Will be making these again and again!! Only thing I'd change is for a pack of 6 chops, I'd double the recipe.  Thanks! =]

My family and I love this recipe.  The only change that I make is marinating the chops in the sauce the night before.  No other changes needed.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

Wow! Holy smokes!! This recipe was excellent! Was very skeptical of this b/c of some of ingredients...like the ketchup! However, this made me look like a genius in the kitchen (which I'm not)! Only the I did was like other reviewers suggested was double the marinade, added a bit of minced garlic and put in ziplock bag & let sit all day in fridge then after putting in dish to bake added some onion slices on too of meat. I used 3 pork chops total! Covered w foil till last 5 mins then broiled for 5 mins! FABULOUS!!!????

Very easy and good flavor. Cut down oil to 1 Tablespoon and salt & pepper chops before pouring on marinade-otherwise make as directed.

This marinade is delicious.but I did change it a bit, by adding a large min

ced garlic clove.I used 4 top loin chops w/o the bone.I used the sauce amounts for 6. I decided to marinate the chops,but when I put it all in a large Ziploc..the chops were't covered well. So I quickly made the recipe again,and dumped it in.Satisfied with that..Marinated 4.5 hours in the fridge. Then  just lifted each chop out by a fork,dripping with sauce,and put them on a wire rack,in an aluminum foil lined pan.I added a little water to the pan, so the drippings wouldn't burn.Cooked on 375 for 15 min.,flipped over, brushed on a bit more sauce and cooked 15 min. more.Turned oven to broil, with pan about 4 inches from coil for 2 min., to brown it a bit. Meat was tender and tasty. I heated the extra sauce and we drizzled it on our chop after we cut it up..Next time I will score the meat before marinating, so flavors will soak in.To the person who said, mix all other ingredients before oil, I find if you use your spoon for oil  before your catsup, the catsup just slides right  off the spoon,instead of holding on.

Simple to do. Common ingredients usually found in your kitchen.  I baked the chops 30 min covered and then 30 more min uncovered and they came out great! Very nice flavor and moist.

Awesome! Like Claire K. I made the full amount of sauce for 3 chops. Also, by mistake I omitted the oil, but the sauce "stuck" to the chops very well, and everyone loves this recipe. I also added 1/4 cup minced onion and 1/2 teaspoon Garlic. Yum!!!

I tried this tonight and the pork chops were way overcooked...almost unedible.   Think I needed to select thicker chops...or significantly reduce the cooking time.  Not sure that I will make this again.

Very easy to make. I have done pork as well as chicken (family preference). I double and sometimes triple the sauce recipe so we can make yummy rice bowls with extra sauce. Left overs are easy to freeze and defrost for a easy 2nd meal.

Awesome marinade.  I've made this several times, always "eyeballing" the relative volumes (making more sauce than needed on purpose).  I added Sriracha for a little extra "bite" and it's fantastic.  I've also used this on chicken.

I really liked this easy recipe!  Nice and tender chops, and all the ingredients were already in my pantry.  I used 4 pork chops and thought the sauce amount was just right.  Because they were not swimming in sauce, the little amount spread on each chop (about 1 T. each)bubbled and cooked into a nice glaze with no broiling needed.  Strange name though because the chops don't sit in a marinade for any length of time at all.  I will definitely line my pan with foil next time because my dish will soaking for awhile with burnt on sauce.

I made these last evening for guests. They were WONDERFUL! Since I was cooking for a crowd, I used 11 chops. Others mentioned not having enough sauce. I tripled the amount, since I essentially was doubling the number of chops called for. It was just the right amount. I did decrease my baking time to 45 min. They were nice and moist, not at all dry. I think you need to factor in the thickness of the chop when determining baking time. This is definitely a keeper.

This recipe was quick and tasty and great because I already had all the ingredients on hand. I did leave out the vegetable oil and added a tiny bit of garlic and onion powders. I agree with others that the recipe is small--I made the full recipe and did just two ~6 oz boneless chops(could probably have done 3, but certainly not 6). Also, I only baked them 20 minutes on each side, and they were still a bit overcooked. If I had done 30 minutes on each side, they would have been charcoal.

This recipe is awesome. It can be even better following the common advise of other reviwers: Double the amount of sauce adding garlic and minced onion;  marinate the meat for about half hour. You can cook these in the oven (uncovered for last 20 minutes) , the grill or your stove top. It is finger-licking goood!!!

It's a sweet sauce but very easy to make - and you aren't marinating it. You add it just before you put the pork in the oven. I did double the sauce for my six pork chops. Very good, very quick. Perfect busy Mom recipe!

I didn't trim the fat off the pork chops, but I did drain the drippings and saved it for making gravy.  I agree there wasn't much sauce to coat both sides.  The pork chops turned out to be a great hit. My family loved them.  I will make this one again.

The whole family loved this, including my son who typically opts to eats Grape Nuts cereal for dinner rather than eat anything my wife or I might make.  I did modify the recipe a bit. All ingredients which the recipe calls for 2 Tbl, I up to 3 Tbl, and 1 Tbl gets upped to 2 Tbl.  I use 2 tsp lemon juice, and add 2 Tbl Liquid Smoke (any variety is good).  I generally cook these on Sunday, and let them marinade before we head to church.  We get home 3 hours later right around dinner time, and the chops are ready to go.  Also, I generally cook these on the grill.  I get the best results on my grill cooking on high heat (lid open)3 minutes on each side then rotate (get those nice cross-hatched sear marks) for another 3 minutes on each side.  If you have a nice fatty chop, you do need to tend them vigilantly to avoid flare-ups that WILL char the meat.

Yummy sauce!  Easy to make!  My family and I love sauce & gravy, so I tripled the sauce and after I finished cooking the pork chops I poured the sauce into a pan and mixed in a slurry of corn starch and water with it to thicken it up.  Delicious and complete meal made with Rice Roni and String Beans

I would go with thin pork chops to get the full benefit of the flavour of the sauce.  Good recipe and will be a go-to recipe in our house.

It was delicious my husband a very picky eater loved it!  Like everyone says I doubled the marinate and marinated the pork chops the whole day and added onions.  I used half the marinade and covered the pork chops with foil for 20 min then after I flipped and added the rest of the marinade for 15 min and the last 5 mins I broiled it!!  Wasn't satisfied with the sauce because it was to watery so I put the marinade I. A saucepan and added corn starch to make it nice and thick and then spread it back into the pork chops so it could be soaked in delicious marinade!

I love the  marinade for this recipe, I think it could be used for chicken too and it would be great, i wanted more of the marinate in the meat so i put it along with the chops in a large baggie to sit in the refrigerator fora couple of hours, big mistake i think, it dried out the pork chops, not terribly but enough, next time i will follow the recipe as is. Thanks Kim this was still yummy!

I always quadruple marinates anyway so I took liberties with the recipe. I also marinated my pork chops for about 5 hours. Pork chops came out tender and juicy. A huge hit at my house!

It was okay.  Fast and easy and most people will have the ingredients on hand.  My husband said the texture was strange but he is used to grilled chops.

Very good, simple & satisfying! Perfect for a weeknight, needs almost no attention. I did season the chops with salt and pepper before saucing them. I used the recommended sauce suggestion and thin cut chops!.

I am a total amateur when it comes to cooking. I had some pork chops and found this recipe on line and liked it. I followed the recipe exactly and served the chops on a bed of couscous with natural cooking juices poured over the dish and with a salad on the side and everyone loved it.

Great recipe!   The pork chops were a huge hit, everyone wanted seconds.  The only thing I did different was triple the sauce recipe.  1 batch for the first 30, 1 batch for the second 30, and 1 batch for the finale.

I was looking for a good recipe for pork chops and stumbled upon this one..I figured if there were over thousand likes, it must be good. I will give it a try.... .The result? The pork chops come out tender and favorable. Recipe is a keeper.

The taste was delicious. The pork chops themselves were a little over done and I would recommend thick cut pork chops for this recipe. I also doubled the marinate like many recommend. I will definitely try this recipe again with thicker pork chops!

I made the recipe as listed except I added fresh minced garlic(like many others suggested)plus I just made extra sauce and I did broil a little before serving. Everyone seemed to like it so I'll be making it again except I may cook it less bc I think I baked the chops a little too long.

Made this last night and the flavor was great. Only change I made was added a little more brown sugar and used EVOO. Both enhanced the flavor a little. Although this recipe calls for 6 chops, I used it on only 1. My chop was thick, though, about an inch but, following the cooking instructions, it came out perfect. Very tender and flavorful. I did marinate it before hand. Only complaint I have is the amount of sauce. Like I said, I only had one thick chop and used every bit of the sauce which was just enough. If I had more chops i would at least triple the recipe but, other than that, it was a perfect sauce.

This recipe lacks flavor and texture. It would be better if thickened and garlic were added but it still would not be good.It did nothing for the pork which was dry and tough (used center cut pork chops).The flavors clashed with each other.

I personally love pork chops but these were way too dry for me. I used bone in thin chops and they really only needed about 25min in that oven. I put them in for 40 minutes and they were extremely dry. Marinade was pretty good but needed more of it. Marinade is pretty tasty though! For a weekend meal, you really can't beat it

Yummy!!!  The only thing I altered was the cooking time.  I covered them and cooked them for 20 min. Turned them, added a little bit more sauce and cooked them for another 20 more mins uncovered.  Oh, sorry, I also double the sauce because it's so yummy!!  Will cook again for sure.

I agree with other reviews that this needs to be marinated for awhile.  Sauce was tasty but I added garlic and ginger as suggested by other reviewers.  Will try again and will double the sauce and marinate for a few hours.

Definitely double the amount of the marinade.  Trust me.  It's delicious and you'll want more.  I think it would help if the chops were allowed to soak in the sauce for at least a few hours, if not longer, to create more tenderness. Family seemed to like it!  I will make it again!

I used 6 small boneless pork chops and they were perfect for this sauce amount.    It was a hit and I will definitely make this again.    The chops were not dry at all.

Good tasting.  I marinated 5 1 inch chops for 5 hours.  Tripled the marinade sauce (A MUST).  Like Michele said, the sauce didn't stick very well to the chops.  My daughter ended up putting store bought bar-b-q sauce on them.  Covered them for the first 25 minutes with foil, took the foil off & flipped them & baked for 15 minutes, then broiled them for a few minutes.  Still came out a little dry.  Really have to pay attention when making pork chops.

The sauce was a hit.  Not a lot of sauce if you follow the recipe though...I multiplied it by six and had sufficient sauce for six pork chops and some extra to pour over the rice.  Pork chops were a little dry inside after an hour so I'll reduce the time a bit.

A good alternative to shake and bake.  Everyone enjoyed them.  Make more sauce if serving rice.

This was a good recipe. It'd be a great starting point as other reviews have mentioned because preparing it as is, the flavors of the dish don't really pop. Four star rating because it was pretty tasty considering the lack of fresh ingredients (I did use fresh lemon juice, though) or spices in the recipe. The meat was tender, but a had a bit of oil lingering from the pan (perhaps I did not trim the chops enough, maybe it was the addition of oil in the sauce). I served with a simple green salad. Overall, I would make this again with some tweaking of my own. Thanks for a new dinner recipe!

Probably closer to a 3.5 rating, but rated it 4 stars because the ingredients were so common, I was able to make it on a whim and it was extremely simple.  Would make again, but will probably add something...onions or something

I think I could drink this sauce. It is hard to keep pork chops juicy and this one works. I made it according to the recipe except..... I did marinate for 24 hours, doubled the amount of sauce (after reading other reviews). Very good!

I made this last night for dinner and my family LOVED it. All i did differently was to add minced garlic and some onions to the sauce. I let it sit it the sauce for half an hour before I put it in the oven. Delicious! Will be making this again.

Very easy and delicious. I grated two cloves of garlic, and chopped one half of a yellow onion and sprinkled thyme on top of the chops before pouring half of the marinade.  I also covered them and baked for thirty minutes before removing the foil and baking for an additional 25 minutes.

I loved this recipe! However, I tripled the ingredients. It just didn't cover all of our pork chops. I also marinated them all day. The flavor was wonderful but if I had to do it over again I would have marinated them at least 24+ hours.

What a super recipe!  I made this last night; the amount of sauce seemed a bit skimpy, so I decided last minute to double it.  I was so glad I did; since I don't use a meat thermometer, I baked the chops the full hour as directed, and they ended up on the dry side.  BUT--I had all that great sauce, so I gave everyone their own small bowl of sauce next to their dinner plates, and they totally loved dipping their meat into the sauce!  The taste was EXCELLENT!  The only thing I would change is the baking time--otherwise a great recipe and a real keeper!  This recipe's getting filed.  Thanks much!

Nice sauce. Made as is with a little garlic powder and red pepper flakes.   It's thick and more like bbq sauce than a marinade.  Despite the sugar it's not overly sweet either.   I quadrupled the recipe for about 8 pork loin chops(make it 24 servings for easiest measuring), marinated for a few hours, saved some sauce back (not from the marinade) and cooked it down and served it over the top.  Very tasty.

I doubled the sauce recipe, and it came out pretty good. I wasn't blown away, but it certainly wasn't bad. My boyfriend loved it; it's now one of his favorite dishes.

I'm typically one to avoid making pork chops, but I wouldn't mind making this again.

These chops were great.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were a big hit.  I cooked 5 medium size chops in a pyrex dish that I gently spray grease before hand to make cleanup easy.  I cooked for the exact time as recipe calls for with the chops covered with foil the whole time.  They came out moist and tender.  Great recipe will definitely be making again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Had some porkchops to cook but wanted something different as I am teaching my daughter to cook and this looked simple and sounded like it was tasty. I gave my daughter the recipe and set her to work. I read a book while she cooked dinner. To my delight the pork chop recipe was really delicious! Tender and slightly tangy but not too sweet. She served it with baked potatoes and asparagus. A keeper! Thanks

Made this tonight. It was good but we were not wowed. I decided to marinate the chops even though the recipe didn't specify a time for that. I intended to marinate for a couple of hours yesterday, but a different dinner plan arose so I ended up marinating 24 hours. Glad I did because the meat took on the flavors of the marinade quite nicely. The only other changes I made were, I used Red Wine Vinegar and EVOO like someone suggested. I upped the ingredient proportions with the exception of the chops. And finally, I cooked them in a lightly covered pan for 40 minutes straight and they was done. I only flipped them after they were cooked and let them set for about 5 minutes.

The sauce is bland and watery.  The one hour cooking time called for is far to long, the chops came out very dry.  I used thick cut chops.    Moving on!

This was a wonderfully simple recipe using common ingredients.  Just perfect!  My only disappointment is there are no left-overs.

I used 8 boneless pork chops and sliced them in half for a thinner version. Tripled everything except only used 2 1/2 T. Oil. It came delicious. 20 minutes each side was perfect. Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe because it's so quick and easy and uses ingredients that are always on hand. This sauce is really good! Although it was a little runny when it came out of the oven, I added a little flour and once it cooled down it thickened up a bit. Poured it over the chops and  mashed potatoes and we really enjoyed it. I used boneless pork chops that were just under an inch thick, baked at 350 15 min each side.

Enjoyed this recipe!  I used two butterfly pork chops and the sauce was not nearly enough.  Next time I'll double the recipe. These chops are the most tender baked chops I've had in a while though.  Will definitely make again.

These were delicious! I recommend bone in pork chops. I tried both boneless & bone in & boneless weren't nearly as tender! Will for sure make these again.

Firstly, and I hate to be pedantic, but this is a glazed pork chop, not marinaded.  However, it is still good.  I had to make one adjustment due to food allergies.  I substituted 2 tablespoons of yellow mustard for the soy and Worcestershire sauces, and I added about a teaspoon of seasoned salt (Tony Chachere's).  The result was absolutely fantastic!  It's even better if you switch to broil during the last 5 to 10 minutes of the cooking as it caramelizes the glaze and pork.

Great!  Used different cut of pork so I should have made more sauce, but that's my own fault.  The boyfriend liked it too!

We just had this and I am not sure what I did - the flavor was wonderful, I used pork terderloin cuts that I had and they were a little dry, I covered the dish with foil while baking to help hold moisture in and did not uncover.  But will for sure do this again as the taste was good.

This was really good! I made a double batch, and added a little minced garlic, marinated it for a couple hours, then baked. Broiled for a few minutes when it was done. The grand kids and I devoured them! Will keep this recipe handy, and the best thing is I always have the ingredients on hand. :)

This was great....my only suggetion would be less oil because it seemed like the oil kept the marinade from clinging to the meat; other than that it got a thumbs-up from my picky family!!

Followed recipe exact...and was okay. Sauce was exactly like BBQ sauce. I could've just poured a bottle of bbq sauce on top of pork chops and bake. Won't make this again.

This is a favorite in our house.  My 3 year olds call it "ketchup pork" and they LOVE it.  Quick and easy to make. Goes great with a side of rice and a salad.

My family has used this recipe for years. It is even better if you make the sauce ahead of time and let the pork chops marinate in the fridge before hand.

4 because nothing in life is perfect but this is a great, easy, yummy sauce. I marinated it beforehand in a Foodsaver bag for cooking the next day. To keep the sugar down, I used the Splenda type of Brown Sugar. The lemon juice is a great tenderizer. Like others I'll try this on chicken and probably a pork roast, too. Thanks for a great combo!

I made these pork chops and they turned out very good!!  They were super moist and my husband was very pleased.  I did add a touch of garlic powder and paprika.  I made the amount of sauce the recipe called for and it was enough for 2 pork chops.  I would double or triple the sauce if I were making more.

I made this recipe however added 2 teaspoons of white sugar and 1 tablespoon of honey to the ingredients and it was delicious. The addes sugar and honey gave the marinade a little sweeter taste which my husband and I both enjoyed.

I was searching for an easy baked pork chop recipe and found this one and so glad I did!  It was so easy to prepare and my entire family loved it, including my young children!   I triple the sauce, but only 1/2 the oil (which would be 3 Tablespoons).  Mummm, this is so delicious!

My family loved these even my very picky toddler ate it all off his plate. The only things I changed were instead of Worcestershire I used Dale's Liquid Steak Seasoning and I didnt have lemon juice so I used a little Sprite and I used boneless chops. it was amazing!!!

Awesome.  Follow what others did with foil covering for the first half.  My pork chops were at 160 degrees within 30 min. So I will cut back the time even more next time I use this.  My husband LOVED this recipe!

My family LOVED these! I made the sauce as directed except I doubled everything but the oil. I used only 3 TB instead of 4 for a double recipe. I also used 1.5 lbs pork chops, which was 3 large chops plus one tiny one. They were about an inch thick and delicious. Towards the end of cooking, I poured out the thin liquid and broiled it until it was a little less liquidy. Delish! My husband is requesting this again!

Mmmmmmmm!! My first time cooking pork chops and it was definitely a hit. I think next time I will either half or completely omit the oil as it didn't really seem necessary. I'll also marinate the pork chops, just so I can get even more of the flavors enhanced. Will definitely be making again.

These were so good. I substituted Worcestershire sauce with A-1 and the Ketchup with BBQ sauce since I was too lazy to go to the store. However they came out excellent! I used thinner pork chops so I cooked them 30 mins on one side and 15 mins on the other.

Delish! I'm a lazy cook, and this was amazing! I used bbq sauce instead of ketchup, and threw some hot sauce, chili powder and garlic in there to give it a little pop and made a 1/2mix sauce recipe for topping it with a little more wetness. 
This is one the best recipes out there.
My amazing cook of a mother-in-law WANTED THE RECIPE!

100% sucess

I marinated 3 pork chops (bone in) in the full amount of sauce for about 6 hours before we cooked them on the grill. We seared them on both sides over high heat before moving them to the cooler side of the grill to finish cooking. We poured the extra marinade over the chops as they were cooking. A++ AMAZING!! Next time I may add some cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit :)

I marinated these overnight, and they came out great. I replaced the ketchup with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ, since BF isn't a ketchup fan. Cut the veggie oil in half, & also added vinegar, garlic powder, & paprika as recommended by another reviewer.

So yummy! We were planning on doing these in the oven just like the recipe explained BUT we were starving so decided to fire up the grill. I kept some sauce to baste the chops as they cooked. My bf loved it and we will be making it with chicken like someone else suggested previously. Great, very tasty, and boy its easy! :)

My family loved it, and my husband said they were the best pork chops he'd ever eaten.  That's really saying a lot, so thanks for the great recipe.  :)

I doubled the recipe, because I have a family of 7.  It was easy and turned out great.

Yum-O. Pork chops were tender and the sauce was better than using bbq sauce and easy to make. This is a keeper, but I had to double the recipe for 4 chops.

This sauce was wonderful! I doubled the sauce as others suggested I uncovered the chops for the last bit of cooking. I added dried minced onion and garlic powder to the sauce just to suit my family's tastes. I served it with steamed broccoli and stuffing. The sauce tasted so good when it seeped into the side dishes on my plate. Yum!

These are really good! A nice change from the same old recipe. I served them with Baked Potato and Glazed Carrots. I added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar, but otherwise didn't change the ingredients. I baked at 375 for 15 min each side and broiled for 3-5 minutes at the end to chrisp up the top.  Next time I will reduce the oil in half and cook on a baking sheet to get the sauce to stick better. Overall this recipe was great and we'll be adding it to our keep file

very good... made as stated. might consider doubling the recipe, though- for only 3 pork chops as well. also may consider marinating them for several hours, or all day, before baking- think they would be even better.

Pretty good! I used honey instead of brown sugar and added some chili paste, white pepper, and sesame seed oil. Came out with a LOT of flavor!

These were pretty tasty chops!! I followed the other reviewers and broiled them for the last 4 minutes so the glaze covered the chops nicely. I didn't have soy sauce, so I used some mesquite marinade I had, which gave it a zing, and also only used 1/4 of the oil. Spread garlic and onion powder to season the meat, put in the oven for 40 minutes, covered for the first half, uncovered for the last, for 1-in pork chops and they turned out nice and soft! Thanks for a great recipe!!

I loved this recepie though I cut ingredients by using bbq sauce. chubbys worked good and just baked in the marinade, turning it in to a gravy. So good. Broiling the chops before they were eaten tasted good.

The sauce had a good flavor but we thought it had a bit too much brown sugar. I think I will try it once more with half as much sugar & see if that works. Pork Chops came out super tender!

Made exactly as listed and it was tasteless.  Probably should be marinated for awhile before cooking but that is not mentioned in the instructions.  Cooking time was way too long.  Will not be trying this one again.

This is a great sauce and great supper. My husband is not a fan of sweet sauces, but I took a chance and made it anyway! To my great pleasure he thought this was just right. He gave it 2 thumbs up as did both our daughters. I did double the sauce for our large chops. They came out moist and tender and, oh, so tasty! Thanks Kim.

I really liked this. It used regular ingredients you are likely to have on hand and the pork chops did turn out moist. I tripled the recipe for 6 large thin cut boneless sirloin chops, and it was too much sauce, they were kind of swimming but we just fished them out and ate them. Thin boneless chops are hard to cook without overcooking or toughening/drying them out so this was a good test. I didn't expect this to be spicy or real tangy judging from the ingredients, so I slathered the pork chops with cracked black pepper and kosher salt on both sides before cooking. This was delicious with jalapeno/cheese bread and a tossed salad. Thank you for the recipe.

I agree with a lot of the reviews -- you definitely need to double the sauce.  Otherwise, this is fantastic.  All four of my kids and my husband loved it, and that's a tall order!

I found these to be rather bland when all was said and done. Don't get me wrong, the sauce had a nice flavor, it just wasn't very strong. My hubby and I like fairly strong flavors especially in pork (not one of our favorite meats) and these just didn't do it for us. My parents seemed to like them just fine though.

We loved these pork chops!  I used 3 smaller pork chops so only needed to cook for a total of 35 minutes.  Doubled the sauce and added onions....will definitely be making this again.

I doubled the Ingredients, and instead of oil and lemon juice... I used 1/2 cup Orange Marmalade and 1 tbs. red wine vinegar, Apple Cider Vinegar would work also. Give it a try, I think it Rocks!

Fabulous recipe! I was tired of the same breaded baked pork chops. I did double the sauce ingredients and the family were spooning it on the chops and mashed potatoes.

I love making this and have been making it for a while now. Like someone else mentioned before, the sauce portions on this recipe does not seem to be enough for 6 chops. I make 3 or 4 times more of it in order to get all of them covered enough. I also bake it uncovered for the last 5-7 minutes. It's a hit in our home!

I've actually made this marinade and then made a foil packet and thrown them on the grill.  Or also just marinated the chops and then grilled them. Either way nummies!

Five stars for flavor- delicious! The sauce was fantastic with rice. The pork chops were a little tough but that is probably something I did. 2 boneless butterfly cut chops at 350 for 25 minutes, then 5 minutes under the broiler. I will definitely make this again.

This was very easy and I doubled the sauce like others suggested.  I rated it at a three because my pork chops were over cooked.  I used thin pork chops and an hour was to long.  I will try it again next time with less cook time, or with bigger pork chops.

I followed this recipe exactly and they turned out great. I am not usually a fan of pork chops but have really gotten tired of chicken & fish (our food staple). I made 4 chops for just me and my husband not thinking I would eat a whole one but I ended up eating both and so did he. I give it a 5 for how easy it was and how good the flavor is. Super easy, coat the chops and throw in the oven.

Great recipe, but I made so many changes that I don't know if it's still the recipe.  Like many people recommended I doubled up on the sauce.  I didn't have any worcestershire sauce so I omitted it.  Substituted it with oyster sauce instead.  I also used balsamic vinegar instead of lemon juice (because it's what I had on hand).  I also mashed up half of a kiwi and mixed that into the marinade and added a good dose of sesame oil (didn't really measure it). I included the brown sugar and ketchup.  I pour all of the sauce over the pork chops and let them marinate for an hour (heard that kiwi can turn your meat to mush if left on too long).  Popped them in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees, then turned the oven off and left the pork chops in the oven for an additional 15 minutes (don't know if it really made a difference).  They came out great.  I used bone-in, 1 inch thick pork chops and served with a side of baby bak choy and rice.

Easy and excellent!  I did double the recipe for the sauce because I read other reviews saying the amount called for was not enough.  Other than this I didn't change a thing and these turned out great!

Made according to the directions.  The flavor of the marinade/Sauce was not a hit at our house.  It was okay and since I had leftovers I cut the pork chops into smaller pieces and heated them on the stove with additional sauce.  We then had the leftovers with rice.  Everyone actually enjoyed this more than the original chops.  I won't be making this one again.

I followed the recipe as written and we just didn't feel it was good with the pork. The sauce itself wasn't bad but just lacking something.

I made this with boneless thin pork chops. I flipped and rebasted halfway through. They took about 30 minutes. I also had to add a rack to the baking dish because there was too much juice. I wanted them to be saucy, but not sloshy and wet, if that makes sense. They were perfect!

I made this tonight and it was a hit! I tripled the marinade though, and I'm glad I did. It was just the right amount. I didn't pour the marinade over the chops while bake, instead I used it to make a reduction sauce to go over the chops and rice.

So juicy, so tender.  I put all the juice in the chops and marinated it for 1 hour prior to baking.  Also added a handful of capers (drained) while marinating.  Its a keeper!!!!!!

Really tender and juicy! Definitely need to double the sauce if making more than 3, no questions about it! Also, I set it under the broiler for about 5 min after the initial 30 min and it was just perfect!

Reduced the serving size to 2 portions and halved the oil and added 1 tsp of hot pepper sauce. It was very tasty and moist although I did reduce the baking time to 45 minutes. The baking time of course as well as how much sauce to make will vary w/ the size of your chops. Will make again!

I made this last night and it went over very well with everyone in the family. Even my husband who says he doesn't like pork. I did make some changes like stated in other reviews. I used chili sauce and added about 2 teaspoons of choped garlic, because I did not have garlic chili sauce on hand. Everyone said this is a true keeper.

This was the best pork chops I've ever had. Even my husband who's not a pork fan said they were really good.   I made them with double the sauce as recommended in several reviews and did add minced garlic...about a tablespoon....and let them marinade for 30 mins or so.  This will definitely be made again.

I followed the directions exactly except that I doubled the sauce per some reviews.  I think the cook time/temp is excessive because my chops were dry and tough even though they were swimming in sauce.  The taste of the sauce is all right, but nothing out of this world.

Very simple to make.  The sauce had a nice flavor. I already had the sauce ingredients on hand (which was a bonus!).  I used the leaner pork loin chops which might have been a mistake.  Perhaps you could substitute them if you cut the cooking time in half.

I made the sauce and used it as marinade for grilling. It was very yummy kind of tasted like a teriyaki. I would like to try it on chicken too.

I took everyone advice, doubled the recipe, boneless chops so I cooked less time, reduced the oil etc., but these chops did not come out tender enough.  I only marinated for about 2 hours but this recipe needs much more.  I won't likely make them again.

They remind me of Chinese food. I would also recommend a thicker cut as mine became rather dry after cooking as suggested.

I made this last night and absolutely loved! I doubled the sauce, because I tend to overcook pork chops, but they turned out wonderful! The worchestire and brown sugar really came out in flavor. I topped with some rosemary (my uber favorite) and served to rave reviews!   Definitely a keeper in my recipe box. Super easy and you already have all the ingredients (except maybe the meat). Loved it!

This was a delicious meal that was SO easy to cook! My boyfriend and I are beginning to branch out a little bit when it comes to cooking, and both of us agreed that not only was this easy, but it didn't require a trip to the grocery store to get items we didn't already have. This is a repeat recipe for sure! Thanks!

These were delicious!  Hubby said "5 stars" and gave it a thumbs up.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I doubled the sauce and I grilled the chops.  I used boneless sirloin chops and served with the zucchini parmesan on this site.  Will make again!

I loved this dish and so did my husband.  I had lotsof left overs so I brought to my sisters and her family loved it too.  It is a simple dish that tastes like your eating at a restaurant. I served this over fish with rice.

Thus recipe was wonderful. I did as suggested and doubled the sauce and used as gravy. Very yummy. My 9 year old requested I only make these pork chops from now on... That's a keeper.

This recipe was "okay." The glaze was nice, but I also recommend doubling the sauce. I served the chops with steamed vegies and rice which made a nice meal.

Even marinating the pork chops overnight didn't really help this recipe...they looked nice, presentation wise, but the taste was really not very good...I would prefer some more spices, at the very least. Thanks for taking the time and submitting your recipe, I just didn't really like it.

This was tasty, but perhaps a little ordinary. The flavor of the marinade reminded me very much of meatloaf, and I found that I had to double the recipe to make enough for the 4 butterflied chops I was baking.

I made these tonight for supper and they were wonderful! I gave 4 stars because I think next time I will reduce the amount of oil because they were a little oily but otherwise they were both tasty and tender!

I had 7 pork chops and started off doubling the sauce. As I was putting the sauce on the pork chops my husband said it would be best to double it again for the other side. It smelled so good and everyone ate every bit of it. Will have to do it again. Thanks for this recipe.

I was in a pinch and found this recipe.  SO glad I did because I came back to find it today and now I am able to save it in my faves.  I think I quadrupled the recipe for four boneless chops and had a good amount leftover, so I would definitely recommend multiplying it for the amount you're making.  My family LOVED it. It's super easy and I almost always have the ingredients on hand and you don't have to marinate it that long (I tend to be last minute so this is perfect for me)  My fave part about it is that it makes almost like a glaze.  Delish!

I marinated the pork chops in the sauce for approx. 24 hours.  Very tasty! Marinade was simple enough.   I'm trying to wean my husband from his favorite - fried pork chops.  This recipe will definitely help in that endeavor.

Good recipe, marinate not as thick as I would have liked. I lined my pan with foil and also added garlic and paprika. I substituted olive oil for the vegtable oil, next time I will just omit it all together, I thought it was too oily. All in all, I'll try it again. Probably will try to marinate it a couple of hours before.

My lovely wife made this for our three teenage and it was a hit.  We came home from a date night and I was looking forward to some leftovers, but to my surprise there was none.  This was a simple and quick recipe I am sure I will have to try myself when the kids are out!LOL I'll just have to make extra extra next time!

Very good recipe, but I used 4 large boneless porkchops so I tripled the marinade ingredients.  Well, that was enough to cover them once.  So I made a second batch (again, tripled) that sat in the fridge until I was ready to turn them.  I added garlic, other than that, I left the recipe as is.  It was a hit.  Even my sons friend that was over and he "hates" pork chops : )

We all loved the pork chops and that is not an easy thing to say in our family! I did one thing different by accident. I put one TBS. lemon juice instead of the tsp. (wasn't reading correctly) I also doubled the marinade and let the pork chops marinate over 24 hours. Then we grilled them. They were scrumptious! I think the best we have made yet!

This just wasn't good.  It marinated for 3 hours, baked as directed and it came out overdone and so dry it's almost inedible.  Wasn't crazy about the flavor.

a bit spicy, but delicious. extremely easy to make. and a recipe i will make again.  I made a little more marinade and completeky covered the pork with marinade putting it in the oven, then i saved the marinade left and it was a great sauce for the pork and the spaghetti i served with the pork.

You do need to make more sauce as many suggested. I made these for a "dinner with the neighbors" event and everyone loved them! I used fresh center-cut chops from our local butcher.

So-so marinade. Definitely cheaper than anything store bought or from a bottle, but not any more spectacular than that either. I grilled the chops and can only imagine this recipe being successful when the chops are grilled. I imagine baking them would leave them with an unappealing visual presentation color-wise. Grill marks are always good!

The marinade was ok, but when I  added chilli flakes, 5 spice, molasses, and chipotle it was great!  I BBQed the pork.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe for my 6 thick chops and added some minced garlic because we are garlic lovers and it was very yummy.  I will use this recipe for pork chops from now on!

Wonderful!  I love the sauce...  I use it to marinate pork tenderloin, too.  I also use 1/2 chili garlic sauce in place of ketchup for an extra kick.  (we like spice)

Great as is.  I didn't change a thing.  All pork chops were devoured.  Great for something a little different.  I served them with garlic mashed potatoes and fresh steamed green beans from the garden.  Thanks! Update:  I forgot to mention that I used 3/4 to 1 inch thick boneless chops.  They were very moist and tender with the full 1 hour of cooking time.

Tried these on boneless pork chops last night. Had to quadruple the recipe to make enough marinade to soak the pork chops. I added some minced garlic, ground pepper, and cumin to the recipe. I used teriyaki sauce because I didn't have soy sauce. I marinated them for about 5 hours and them put them on the grill. They were fabulous! Going to try next on chicken or steak! Great recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly and my pork chops came out really dry and lacking flavor. I was disappointed as the prior reviews were excellent.  I think if the marinade was doubled and cooking time was reduced by 5 minutes then this would have solved my problem.

I doubled the recipe and marinade them overnight in the fridge. We bbq them and used Montreal steak seasoning. Then when we fliped the chops we poured the reserve juice on the chops.

I'm always looking for a new recipe to try and I got lucky with this one.  My hubby said this is how pork chops are supposed to be cooked.  We all loved them and I will make them again and again.  I didn't change the recipe at all but I did double it and I'm glad I did.

I use this recipe as a marinade for grilling pork chops. I marinade the pork for at least an hour, then grill. I reduce down the remaining marinade and brush on to the pork chops as they come off the grill. The pork chops (even thin ones) stay very moist!

This was really good! I used boneless pork chops and baked them for a total of 45 minutes instead of the whole hour. I also used 3 tablespoons of sugar instead of 4 (after doubling the recipe) and they were just sweet enough. I poured the extra sauce on some egg noodles and served with peas and the supper was delish! My husband and 3 year old daughter gobbled it all up :-)

For the first time, I made pork chops and not one but both of my children (5 & 2) asked for seconds.  Will definitely make this again.  I made double of the marinade, took half and reduced on the stove top to make a sauce. Added sliced onion, butter, garlic salt and some red pepper flakes to the sauce.  One change I'll make next time is to reduce the oil...it was a bit much and in the sauce I actually had to pour quite a bit out.

It was a very good recipe! As I read the reviews after I made it I found someone else had the same good experience doing it the way I had, too, which was 17 mins on each side at 375 and adding sauce a third time and broiling for 3 mins to crisp the chop and glaze the sauce. I didnt have worcs, so I used steak sauce and a couple dashes red wine. Tripled the sauce and was exactly enough to brush 6 chops three times. Will make this a part of our regular menu!

This recipe was very good and very easy!  I doubled the sauce for four chops, marinated about 8 hours and cooked chops in the marinade.  I would have liked the chops to be little more tender but I was multi-tasking and didn't check them sooner...still great though!

Pretty good I added a handful of chopped green bell pepper and it added great flavor. I increased the temperature to 375 and reduced the cooking time to about 20 minuits a side, then drained the liquid, and coated the pork chops in the marinade and broiled a couple minutes on each side to prevent the sauce from "sliding off" like many others commented.

My family really enjoyed the flavor of these pork chops, even my 3 year old who doesn't always eat his meat!  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I doubled the sauce as per other reviews.  Very yummy!  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe and also must give credit to another reviewer...'SavedbyGrace' for her helpful review, otherwise it would have turned out too dry.  I too made only 2 pork chops but didn't cut down on the amount of ingredients that it asked for.  I didn't have Worchestershire sauce so used Balsamic Vinegar instead.  However, next time I make this, I would use less vegetable oil.  It was very tasty...my husband ate the rest of the sauce over rice.  It was that good!

If you use thick porkchops, they will be fine for the cook time allotted. I made 3x the sauce and used 2 teaspoons of lemon juice all together. This one goes in my favs.

Yum!  I made it just as the recipe called for and I didn't care for the oil in it as it didn't cling to the porkchop as I would have liked.  The overall flavor was great though and it was easy to prepare.  I rated the recipe as is, but I made it again leaving out the oil and marinated the chops in the sauce.  That was absolutely perfect.

Juicy & flavorful, but try not to overcook them. Mine was done 50 min after putting them in the oven as instructed. Decided to give it another ten so the sauce would caramelize a bit more. Noticeably tougher but still ok. The sauce has a lot of flavor, similar to BBQ sauce, just no POW. I live in Texas so I am used to sweet sauce or spicy sauces that kick. This was not quite enough of either.

Awesome recipe.  I didn't have any lemon juice so I just used red wine vinegar.  Like others I doubled the sauce recipe.  I used half for marinade and half for sauce.  Even though I doubled the recipe I did not double the oil amount.  I didn't see the need.  The pork chops had great flavour and came out very well.

The actual sauce was delicious, though I did triple the recipe for just 5 thick chops (double probably would have been enough, though cutting it close).   My problem was with the temperature and cooking time given. My chops were about 1.5 inches thick and ended up taking a full hour to reach 140degrees at the recommended 350. While this is supposed to be medium-rare, they took so long to cook, they ended up dry and disappointing. Will try thinner chops next time.

I tried this on some thin cut bone in pork chops. It was a hit. The family loved it.  I didn't have any lemon juice, so I just left it out.  I also tried it on chicken. It was okay on the chicken. I like it best on the pork chops!

This sauce was ok.  I won't make it again. I think it was the wosteshire sauce that overpowered it.  My 1 and 3 yr olds loved it though. So maybe I'd make it again for them. Nothing special.

This was so so.  I doubled the recipe and even added paprika and hot sauce but still wasn't that flavorful.  Definitely needs some crushed garlic in the sauce and chopped onions on top for more flavor - will try next time.  Maybe would be better for grilled pork chops.

These were good. The flavour of the sauce was really nice, but there wouldn't have been enough of it. I doubled the sauce, used half to marinate the pork chops (for about 5 hours) and spread the rest on top after I flipped them in the oven. Mine took about 40 minutes to bake. If I make again, I will probably added some diced onion as suggested by others.

I was really skeptical about this dish when I read it, but decided to give it a try anyway. In the end my two year old (who doesn't really like meat) ate almost an entire pork chop! This recipe was fabulous and I will make it again! Thanks!

didn't have soy sauce so used stir fry sauce and it was really yummy.  the pork chops were VERY overcooked though- we used thinner, boneless chops and cooked them for 50 minutes.  I bet 35 would have been perfect.

Really tasty!  My family really enjoyed this....3 and 6 year olds too!    I read some of the other reviews & changed the recipe up a bit - added some chopped onion on top, covered the dish while cooking @ 375 for a total of 35 minutes & then broiled it uncovered for 5 minutes.  The only thing I will do differently next time is decrease the cooking time to a max of 30 minutes.

These didn't take an hour to get to 160, but were cooked perfectly at that temp. Also, I made the sauce exactly as listed and the amount was perfect. The family loved them. I'll be making them again!

I enjoyed making the homemade marinade.  I was hoping to love this but it was just okay.  I may try it again on the grill this summer.  It was too watery in the oven.

Just okay. There were nothing wrong with these chops, they just weren't anything special. I probably wouldn't make it again.

We thought this was pretty good.  I don't think we liked it enough to make it again.  Like others suggested, you need to double the sauce, which I did and was glad.

Pretty good! Added nice, sweet flavor to pork. Chops came out very juicy&tender. Next time I will do glaze on chicken.

Just wanted to add my voice to the chorus - turned some inexpensive pork steaks into a super duper meal.  I didn't measure anything either, just eyeballed it.  The Onion Rice recipe was an excellent side dish too (sauté diced/chopped onion in oil, add rice, stir for a min, add chicken stock and cook).  Darin

Made these for dinner last night, and served with sweet potatoes and broccoli. All of the sauces blended together well, and not one over-powered the other. I used the normal amount called for for 2 - 1.5 inch thick chops. I marinated for one hour in the pan I cooked in, and turned occasionally while cooking. Will definitely make this again.

We loved this!  I made 8 thin cut chops, thinking we'd have leftovers...but we ate them all!  My 8 year old son, a very picky eater, devoured them.  Even my husband loved them and asked me to make them again.  Next time I think I'll cut back or even omit the oil and see how that works.

It was ok. I think there is too much oil because the sauce didn't really stick to the chops. I also had to double the recipe because there wasn't enough to cover both sides.

The marinate was great tasting, but I followed the recipe exactly and the chops came dry sitting in runny, watery marinate.  The pork had only a hint of the marinate flavor.  Sorry - I would probably save more marinate for after it came out of the dish.

Pork was mildly flavored even with marinating but I had extra thick 2 inch chops.  Flavor was nice.  Kids liked the sweet glaze and used extra as gravy on the meat and mashed potatoes.

I used 6 bone in 1" thick chops and needed to use two pyrex dishes to fit them all.  I did the recipe for 6 servings but ended up tripling the recipe.  I used half over them and covered them and baked them for 20 min on 375.  I then drained off the extra liquid and poured the other half on and then baked another 20 minutes.  I took the foil off and then broiled on low for 3 minutes to carmelize the sauce on top.  The whole family (3 kids ages 5-14 and my husband) love them!

Very good sauce!  I had read the reviews so I also covered it with foil up to the last five minutes and because the chops were thin, cooked 15 minutes less.  The meat was moist and very tasty.  My family liked it very much.  Thank you for sharing!

I was very disappointed with this marinade. Once I made it following directions to a tee, I tasted it and the soy sauce was way too overpowering so I threw it out because no modifications were helping it. I didn't even bother ruining my meat with it.

I was sceptical thinking it would be too sweet, but it turned out great.  I did soak the chops in some of the marinade.  Then drained most of the water out of the dish and put the rest of the marinade over the chops and continued cooking.  I did broil for a few minutes to give a nice glazed look.  Very pretty and good.

After a second time trying this recipe and also after taking into account changes suggested by reviewers, I don't think I'll make this again. The meat proved too dry, the sauce wasn't anything to write home about (doubled or tripled even), and tonight my partner was disappointed.

I needed a fast recipe and this answered the call.  I used pork scaloppini instead of chops so baked it for a much shorter time.  I like the flavor of the sauce but I think it would work better next time to let it marinade because I didnt really feel the flavor soaked into them.  Also as everyone else said, the sauce ran out so maybe increase the ingredient portions a little.

I thought these were good, but my husband and two young boys (3 & 5) absolutely LOVED them.  I did not think either of my kids would eat a whole pork chop, but they gobbled them up.  We even used 1-inch thick chops!  The only thing we did differently was to just marinate them in the sauce for about six hours, and then put them on the grill and discard the sauce.  I love it when my men--big and little alike--love their dinner.  This one was a hit!  Thank you for the recipe!

I made a double recipe of this sauce replacing the vegetable oil with 1 Tbps sesame oil and marinated a pork tenderloin and adding the sauce while it cooked. It turned out fabulous. I liked the base of this sauce so much that I decided to use it again in a shrimp stir fry. I once again used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. I doubled the recipe and replaced one tsp of lemon juice with rice vinegar and I used a habanero ketchup for one of the tablespoons of ketchup. It gave the sauce a little kick, which was great in the stir fry. I love this sauce!

I made this recipe exactly as instructed!!!!  The only difference is that I changed settings for 8 people instead of the 6.    Everyone ate them up.  There was 5 of us, and 9 chops!  No leftovers tonight!

Very moist chop.  To seal the chops since I had very thick ones, I dipped them in an egg wash and Italian seasoned breadcrumbs.  I then browned them in butter and garlic, seasoned them in the pan with salt, pepper and chili powder, before putting them in the baking dish.

Just made this for dinner and my hubby and son raved about how tender the chops were.  Followed the recipe exactly as written, with the exception of cooking them a little longer and hotter because I had something else cooking with them.  It's a keeper the hubby is already requesting it for next week..thanks for easy recipe!

Really nothing to rave about. I followed the recipe to a tee and baked the chops. I also added some additional brown sugar as suggested by one of the other raters here. However, I found the marinade really not to be anything special. I feel I would have had the same effect with barbecue sauce.

This recipe is ok.  We marinated the pork chops for about 30 minutes, then grilled them.  Maybe baking would be better, but grilling was not a good idea because of the sugar burning on the grill.

Awesome recipe. Simple an SO good. I used it on chicken and it was great. I also doubled the recipe, and added a bit more lemon juice (fresh), a little fresh minced garlic, and some fresh ground pepper. I think I'll triple the recipe next time. I'm a live-in manager for a group home...my clients loved this. I will definitely make it again. Thanks!

When I made it I was out of lemon juice and it still turned out great. Would even use on chicken. I did sprinkle the meat with onion powder and garlic powder before coating with sauce.

This was such a quick and easy recipe.  Had chops and was bored with the same old thing.  I did brown mine first and used olive oil because I didn't have any veggie oil.  I thought they were terrific.  You can really season your chops anyway you prefer.  You could even add ginger if you like the extra bang.

Excellent marinade! simple, fast and my family thought it was great.  i let it sit in marinade in the fridge for 5 hours, and quadrupled the recipe for 7 chops.  only thing was that my chops were done in much, much less time (about 15 min/side), so they came out a bit tougher than i would have liked.  but still tasy nonetheless!

Sorry...not too impressed. The meat was nice and tender but the sauce didn't do it for me. I made it exactly as the recipe stated, but doubled it and added some minced garlic. The sauce glazed nicely, it just had kind of an overpowering tang to it.

The sauce is delicious!  This recipe makes just enough for 6 medium size pork chops.  The cooking time and temperature are off though.  I reduced the heat to 325 degrees and cooked the chops 20 minutes per side.  I also put them on a rack so that the sauce would form a glaze. I made extra sauce (minus the vegetable oil) to use as dip.  I placed the ingredients in a small saucepan and simmered them to dissolve the sugar, then cooled the sauce.

This was my first time making pork chops. I used this recipe on thinly sliced pork chops. My husband and kids loved it as well. I liked the sweet taste of the sauce and would definitely make this again. I doubled the sauce recipe as well and loved having extra to add on. Only the next time I would cook it at a lower temp longer to help the glaze not caramelize to much and keep my pork chops more tender and moist.

I took the liberty to double the sauce much better for keeping them moist and tender... also used half of a fresh lemon instead and it left a nice subtle hint after each bite. will definitly make again.

I cooked these up tonight and they came out pretty nice. I followed the recipe except I doubled the sauce as per the recommendation of others. I also covered the pork chops for the first half hour and uncovered them the second. They came out very juicy. Next time I will substitute the ketchup for bbq sauce per the request of my husband and see how that turns out.

Good flavor and easy to prepare.  I covered while baking and broiled for a few minutes at the end.  My pork chops were overcooked and dry, but the family did eat 'em up.

Yum! And I don't like bar-b-que at all so. So, wouldn't call these bar-b-que. Very flavorful! My chops were super thin so baked em for 20 minutes total and they were perfectly done.

I made these tonight using the suggestion of a previous reviewer: I added another TBSP brown sugar and I cooked them at 375 for 15 mins, then turned them over and put sauce on top and baked for another 15 mins, before broiling for 5 minutes.  Serves with green salad and mashed garlic potatoes.  Very delicious!

Very easy and delicious!!!  I followed the recipe exactly but opted for the healthier version by using sugar free ketchup and low sodium soy and splenda brown sugar and you couldnt even tell. I am not a pork eater and loved this.  The sauce can be a little runny so I reccomend broiling it for a few minutes to thicken up or maybe add more sugar?

I followed this to the letter with a minor exception...  Allowed three center cut loin chops to marinate for an hour or two, then grilled them on the barbarque.  Simply put, they were great.  Next time I will triple the recipe, brush the chops while on the grill and serve the marinate as a side sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

The best pork chop recipe I have found thus far.  The only change I made was I doubled the sauce. I also covered it for the first 30 minutes then drained it and baked it uncovered for another 20 minutes.  The sauce is great!!!

Great sauce. I also marinated for a couple of hours before baking.  The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because I think the cooking time is off.  I only baked for about 45 min. total and my chops came out pretty dry.

This was an excellent recipe! I was a bit skeptical about it at first, but the chops turned out great! I tripled the sauce for two chops, which was too much, and I added one clove of garlic and it tasted amazing! I am definitely going to be keeping this for the future.

Love it! Had no brown sugar, used BUSH beans (having with) sauce 2 TBs, added a little garlic, and salt seasoning on the flip, used full sauce recipe for 4 frozen thin chops de-boned. Used Pirex Pie Plate (Bachelor) cooked 30/30. Had Beaujolais, Beans, and this. Was only going to have 1 - was so great had 2 and saved 2. Wonderful! Thanks

Pretty good. The time might be a bit long, my chops came out a bit dry. And the do double or triple the amount of sauce for any amount over two chops.

Great recipe!  I had some chops sitting in the freezer and was looking for a recipe that I had all the ingredients for on-hand and this fit the bill.  The only change I had to make was I used lime juice instead of lemon because I had no lemon juice in the house.  They turned out excellent!  This one will be going in the kitchen recipe box as a regular meal!

I made these but I modified it a bit. I doubled the sauce and added 1/4 teaspoon cajun seasoning, garlic powder, basil leaves, black pepper and lemon & pepper. I doubled the amount of Worcestershire sauce and added an extra tablespoon of soy sauce. I only made 4 chops and doubling the sauce really made them juicy-er...Haha. My fiancee loved them and wants me to make them every week. Haha. They came out really great. The sace was a-freaking-mazing. Haha. Great recipe I will make it every week. :P

I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked this recipe !   The chops were excellent .  I did put them under the broiler for 5 minutes as other suggested and that held the sauce on perfectly .  I will definately make these again !

I followed everyone's tip by covering the chops and cooking for 10 minutes, adding more sauce, re-covering and cooking for 10 more and then removing the cover and broiling for 5 minutes and the chops came out perfectly cooked, juicy and very well seasoned. Will definitely make again.

Good recipe!  Simple, easy, tasty!  At the last minute I decided to add some minced garlic (after I baked for the first 30 min and flipped them).  They remained tender and juicy and we loved 'em!  Thanks!

This was so good!!!  We followed the recipe, plus we added a clove of minced garlic and some chopped onion.  After putting 1/2 the sauce on the pork chops we let the veggies marinate in the other sauce until adding it... one of the best pork chops I've ever had!!

I was excited to try this recipe after the good reviews, but was disappointed.  I actually marinated the pork chops for a few hours and feel that there wasn't much flavor to them, even so.  I also only cooked them for 20 min. each side and they came out pretty tough.

This was good, but I took the advice of another reviewer and pan browned my pork chops with a coating of flour. They were nice and brown coming out of the pan but after cooking in the sauce, the flour became gooey. I would suggest doing it without the flour.

I was tired of frying pork chops in a pan with different seasonings all the time.  This one looked good & I had all the ingredients except for the worsteshire. So, I substituted some A1 Steak Sauce (about a tablespoon cuz it's strong)  WOW! good stuff!

I love this recipe. I did not have the  Worchestershire sauce and cannot wait to try it with next time.  I also took advice from another recipe I was going to make before I saw this one and added walnuts to it. Wish I had the pecans. Would have been perfect!! With or without, this is great!! Also, marinated for about 2 hours, perfect!

Delicious!! Although I did not have pork chops, I did have chicken breats and like one other reviewer mentioned, I used the chicken.  My 2 picky...very picky eaters DEVOURED this asking for more!  My husband said this was simply delicious!  I think the brown sugar was the secret to making this taste so good.  The chicken was very moist.  This will be in my dinner rotation.

This was ok but I don't think I'd call it marinated.  It's really just pork chops baked with a mild barbeque sauce.  I made 3 pork chops instead of six and barely had enough sauce so I'd suggest doubling the sauce if you make six as the recipe calls for.

Great Stuff! I made it exactly, except that I only did 3 chops, not 6.  Turned out great...  I read about some of the changes made by others. Some sound interesting.

I made it as it is in the recipe.  Not enough of the sauce and it doesn't hold up well when cooked in the pan.  I agree that it should be cooked on a rack, but didn't try it that way.  I would also recommend doubling the recipe.  Cook time was too long, pork came out chewy.  Finally, the sauce is not very flavorful, it's sweet, but very bland...needs spice.

I made this last weekend and they were the best pork chops I have ever had! I made no changes except for doubling the marinade. Will make this more often.

We loved these chops! I used the following suggestions that others posted... tripled the amount of sauce, added extra brown sugar to thicken, added rice vinegar, cut the oil in half, sprinkled w/garlic salt prior to pouring on the sauce, covered the dish for the 1st 30min of cooking. The only thing I would do different is allow the chops to marinade in sauce prior to cooking. I also baked potatoes & used some sauce on them.  mmmm'

I doubled the recipe as other reviewers suggested and added a little bit more brown sugar.  The sauce was very tasty I just need to work on keeping the meat moist.

I had some very thick pork chops-so I wanted to try something different. The "marinated pork chop" were great. I basically tripled the marinade, then "soaked"  the chops for about 2 hrs. Before baking I basted the tops-put in a 350 degree oven after an 1/2 hr.I turned the chops over and basted the top-let cook for another 1/2 hr. & they were done. I added some chile garlic sauce-not much, as it very spicy away they went

I made the recipe exactly as posted.  We liked it and may try it again, but next time I will experiment with adding spices, as I found the flavor to be missing something.

I read previous reviews so I modified the recipe as advised. I tripled the recipe for the sauce and to me it seem to still be too thin.  The chops were really good and thankfully they weren't dry.  I also marinaded them in the sauce for about 90 minutes before cooking them in the oven.  I turned up the oven to 375 and only cooked them on each side for 15 minutes then I broiled them for 3 minutes before serving them.  I'll try this recipe again and next time I'll add some garlic salt to the chops before I put the marinade on them.

I am not sure if I did something wrong, but my entire family did not like this recipe.  It was almost like boiling the pork chops; they were not brown and the sauce was very watery.  Won't try this one again.

I didn't mind this dish, however my husband really didn't like it at all. It's very similair to a chicken in cola dish that I make often, that has fewer ingredients and a better taste. We won't be making this again.

My family and I normally don't like, nor do we eat pork chops, but I still wanted to give these a try... I figured there had to be at least one pork chop recipe out there.  And I was right, my whole family ate these, they tasted great and I will make them again!!!

This was so good! I did double the sauce. Also, I followed another reviewer's advice and covered with foil for the first 30 minutes of baking. I was a bit worried that they would be dry due to such a long cooking time but they were moist and delicious. Thanks so much for sharing!

Delicious!! I only cook for two, but I still doubled the recipe for the sauce (and only put in half the brown sugar), and spread the excess over the chops after serving. Also, if you can get your hands on "Curry Ketchup," use that instead of regular tomato ketchup. Or just add a teaspoon or so of curry powder when you're stirring the sauce. It really adds to the flavor!! My husband LOVED this recipe, and I will definitely be making it again!

This was a good and easy recipe after a long day at work! I did double the sauce, and will likely bake pork chops with this recipe again. (We ate regular apple sauce with it and found it to be a good combo).

Made this tonight - husband loved it...said he would give it 4 stars - I didn't think it was that great.  To me there is just something missing from the sauce.  Not sure I would make it again.

I found this really bland and was not happy at all with it. I followed it to the tee. I use this site often and when there are so many good reveiews generally it's a hit but I cook for a living and I would not put this one on a menu.

I doubled the sauce for this many chops like others suggested and it was needed. I broiled for last few minutes also. It was a little oily so I may leave someof that out next time. They were moist and really good using a thick cut of meat. I will marinate them longer next time to make the flavor a little stronger. I served with fried rice from here and it was great together. Also great the next day cold chopped on a salad with sunflower seeds, mandarin oranges, chow mein noodles and the left over sauce as dressing.

I made these pork chops for dinner last night.  They were pretty good.  The sauce was good...tastes like a homemade BBQ sauce.  Like others, I'll try it on chicken and ribs.  This recipe is a keeper.

I thought this was very tasteful!  My son loved it and he hates "chewy" meat!  I even used frozen pork chops without thawing and they were perfect.  I doubled the sauce with 6 boneless chops and there was enough to pour over the top to dip in.  Everyone thought it was very yummy!  Thanks!

Very good.I marinated the pork chops overnight with 1/2 the sauce and then continued with the recipe the next day with the other half of the sauce. Make sure you poke holes in the chops so the marinade soaks through.

This recipe is great!  Even family members who are not pork lovers thought this was good.  What's even better is that the ingredients for this recipe are usually found in most kitchens.  No shopping necessary.  I did not change the ingredients at all except to double the sauce.  I only baked the chops for a total of 45 minutes, and I removed the foil for the last 15 minutes as others have stated.  The chops were moist and delicious.

This is a great recipe when you don't know what to do with pork chops. It's simple, easy, and it lets the flavor of the meat come through without a lot of sauce.

The sauce was good, could have been a little thicker. Watch the time on the chops. Don't over cook them in the oven or they will be dry! 50 minutes was more than enough for inch thick chops!

This was really good I added 1 tbs of chili seasoning and I let the chops marinate for a couple hours in worstershire and soy sauce. I add way more of those two ingredients. It turned out great! Thank you

These are the best pork chops I have ever made and so simple.  I added 1 clove of minced garlic to the sauce, (we love garlic)I would definently recommend this recipe.  As someone else said I baked for 30 min. covered and another 20 uncovered.  The pork chops were very moist and my girlfriend can't get enough of them.  Thanks for the original!!

I cut back on the oil and used 1/2 tbs. sesame oil and 1/2 tbs. vegetable oil. I also added two garlic cloves and a big dash of cayenne pepper. I added all the sauce upfront, too. I baked the chops for a total of 45 minutes. Great recipe for a quick dinner--I had everything in the cabinet. Would probably be good in the slow cooker, too.

This recipe is delicious and very easy to make. I halfed the recipe fro a dinner for just my fiancee and I. they are definately cooked in a 1/2 hr. (for 3 chops) Accidently I added a teaspoon of italian seasoning to the 2nd sauce part and it tasted very good. These go great w/ stuffed peppers!

Not bad, but we thought this was a little bit bland, sorry! I cooked my chops for 35 mins total (20 mins one side, 15 the other) and they weren't dry.

My husband printed this recipe out to make, he made the sauce and I did the cooking.  I used pork shoulder steaks and the hour was just too long to bake.  The meat was a bit dried out, but other than that, it was good.  Hubby and son ate their servings, and the leftovers..  I'll try it again, but wont bake it for as long.

I thought that these were just ok but since the rest of the family enjoyed them I will give it four stars. They still turned out too dry for my taste, and I covered them for the first 30 minutes. But overall the taste was good. I may try this again and leave it covered a little longer. Thanks...

I normally skip it when brown sugar is called for in a recipe, but I decided to try it in this anyway.  This was extremely easy to make and a refreshing new way to have chops!

We're a breaded, pan-fried kind of pork chop family, so I was nervous to try this. But, both everyone really liked this recipe. I will definitely add it to my often used recipe list. Thanks!

Loved the sauce to this recipes thought it was great, I'll be trying this with chicken and salmon. The reason I gave 4 stars was the pork chop were a little dry, and I even covered with foil for first half of cooking. I made this recipe exactly and tasted it was very good, but I still added some minced garlic (garlic lover) and pepper.

This was really good! I didn't have lemon juice, but it didn't make any difference without it. I baked it longer than the recipe said so the meat almost fell off the bone! I'll definitely make this again. Thanks!

Good recipe!  However, one hour is wayyy too long to cook the chops unless you have really thick chops.  It reminded me of a VERY Americanized Asian recipe.  I tripled the recipe for the sauce and added cornstarch to thicken it.  I will serve this with rice and snow peas the next time I fix it since it seemed more of an Asian inspired dish and I will add some red pepper flakes for a kick.  (I fixed it with macaroni and cheese with green beans amadine the initial time I fixed it).

Quick & easy!! This sauce was a great marinade, but I had to double it like most of the others.  I also marinated the chops for the whole day and added a touch of garlic salt and cracked pepper just before I put it in the oven (on a rack so the grease would drip down).  Everyone LOVED it!

Why are these called Marinated Pork Chops when there is no marinating involved? I had really big chops and should have doubled the amount of sauce so that I would have more coverage. Mine came out really dry (I even pulled it out 10 minutes early)and pretty darn unexciting. Wouldn't not attempt again even if the sauce was doubled.

This recipe was awesome and a big hit with all of us.  It's easy and the things you need to make this most people have everything needed already in the   kitchen. It's VERY TASTY and the sauce is great for over rice too.  :-D

I gave this recipe 3 stars because although I loved the fact that the ingredients were all ones I already had in my pantry, it was so-so for us.  The flavor was good, but not great, and my chops were tough, even though I had done what others wrote and covered it with foil for the first 30 minutes.  Nice recipe, but I think I'll continue searching.

This recipe was a hit with my kids.  My 25 year old and 5 year old are extremely picky eaters, but both loved it, especially the 5 year old who said I just have to make this again. I followed another reviewer and increased the oven temp to 400 and shortened the cooking time.  For the last ten minutes, I broiled the chops five minutes on each side - the sauce carmelized, and they were absolutely wonderful.

This is a wonderful, tangy-sweet sauce.  I more than tripled the sauce(for my 2-servings) and after 30 minutes added a couple of sliced up granny smith apples.  It may be better to add the apples at the last 15 minutes rather than 30 minutes.  To taste, I guess!

This was alright. I suggest doubling the sauce and carmelizing the pork when it is about 5 minutes to being done.

I made this recipe the other night for my family. It was great! I recommend serving these with home fries (just microwave some potatoes until they are cookes, dice them up and fry them in a little oil.) and salad like we did. Thanks for the great recipe!

I was disappointed after reading other reviews.  I thought it was too sweet and the sauce did not mix well with the flavor of the pork chops.  Will not make again

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe! I doubled the recipe because I wanted to let the pork chops marinade a bit. I didn't have any Worsteschire sauce, so I decided to leave that out. But I did dice up an onion and put that in. I substituted teriyaki sauce for the soy sauce. I also added some salt, pepper, and about a teaspoon of garlic powder. I let the chops marinade for an hour or two, baked them for 30 minutes, then threw on another coating of the sauce for another 30 minutes. The chops were great! Thank you for posting this one!

Wonderful flavor! Will definitely make again. Next time I will definitely make extra sauce and reduce it in a pan after the chops have baked so that we can have them over rice. Can't wait to give it a try :)

These were tasty, but next time I will add corn starch to the sauce before I put it on the meat. That way the finished product will be a thicker sauce that can be used to pour over the rice.

I think the pork chops are dry. I think the sauce flavoring was good but this dish needed to have a sauce for the pork chops to make it less dry. I won't make this again.

Tasty!  I doubled the marinade per other's instructions, but it didn't really need it.  I used four thick cut chops instead of six thinner ones.  Very easy recipe and my family loved it.  This is a keeper.

Thought this was a little too salty tasting with the Soy sauce and the Worcestershire sauce, am going to cut back on those a little bit.  It did make the pork chops very tender though.

These pork chops were very good. I left off the soy sauce but added salt and pepper. As the others have indicated, I marinated mine for approx 4 hours before cooking.

We don't much like pork but I try to serve it anyway, and this made it not only tolerable, but all of it disappeared. Thank you! I wish the sauce would have turned out a bit thicker, but other than that I can't complain.

Very good! Extremely moist and tasted perfect. The only change I made was to make a little more sauce since I like extra, but all was very good. Thanks for the recipe! :)

The chops I used were a little thin so I reduced the time on the second half to 15 minutes. It's great, enjoyed it very much..
Thanks,

Delicious recipe. The sauce was great, leaning towards a light barbecue sauce almost. My chops turned out a little dry, so maybe I will slightly reduce the cooking time for the same temperature.

This was....okay.  Not terrible but certainly not mouth watering.  I made only a few adjustments per previous reviews.  I did the salt/pepper/garlic thing on the three 3/4" bone-in chops and then seared them to a golden brown on both sides.  I tripled the sauce and then followed the recipe exactly except I cooked them for only 15 minutes per side.  They were still a bit tough and overdone but not terrible.

My husband is picky and we BOTH loved it! I quadrupled the sauce recipe and served over jasmine rice with a really good fresh green bean recipe. We used half of the sauce while baking, and the other half to pour over the porkchops/rice. It had almost a chinese food kind of feel to it.  Very Good!!

I marinated pork chops  for a day before baking.  I really enjoyed the flavor, and will try this with some flank steak next time.  The flavors remind me of teriyaki steak skewers...

The sauce was really good.  Next time I want to make a couple changes of my own to add more flavor.  I cooked mine 15 mins on each side and that made it a little dry, too.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

The marinade for this is awesome! I took the advice of some previous posters and marinated the meat overnight. I also doubled the marinade recipe. I need to try it again though, because the meat was still too tough. I think I may of had a bad cut though. I will try again with thin cuts. This marinade would be good on chicken too!

These were good, but forgettable. I will find a better recipe next time. I would say for sure though that the pork chops do not need to be in the oven for an hour. I cooked mine 40 minutes and they were so hard to chew I didn't bother eating them.

THIS RECIPE WAS OK!  I THINK IT MIGHT BE BETTER IF YOU BROWNED THE CHOPS IN A SKILLET OVER HIGH HEAT FOR JUST A MINUTE ON EACH SIDE.  THEN PROCEED WITH THE REST OF THE RECIPE  THE MARINADE WAS A LITTLE THIN AND IT DIDN'T SEEM TO ADHERE TO THE CHOPS AT ALL.  IF YOU BROWN THEM, THEN THEY MIGHT RELEASE A LITTLE JUICE THAT WON'T BE ADDED TO THE OVEN DISH THEREFORE KEEPING THE MARINADE JUST A LITTLE THICKER.

This recipe was very easy however, like many stated the cooking time should be about 20-25 minutes on each side.  I cooked mine the entire hour and they were a little tough.  The sauce was very tasty and was excellent served with rice.  Next time I will adjust the time and use 1 tbs. vegetable oil and 1/2 tbs. of olive oil.

My recipe is for the grill.  Substitute the oil for 7up and add garlic.  Marinate over night and then cook on grill.  My family loves them! Has been a family receipe since I was little now I am passing it to my children.  Thanks for the idea of cooking in oven. We just always liked the grilled flavor.

The marinade was good, but the cooking time was way too long.  I would check after 30 minutes to see if it's cooked through.

Delicious but doesn't have a WOW factor for me.  I doubled the sauce but I think I'd triple it next time.  The chops came out pretty tender and most importantly the men and kids were happy! Thanks OP!

My family liked this meal even my 5yr old son liked it and asked for more.  Made this meal on stovetop and substituted chops with riblets thats all I had at the time (still pork) and left out the oil.  Still came out great do recommend it and will make it in the future.

No one in my usually non picky family liked these.  I will not be making these again. I am not sure what the issue was: the marinade? the fact we dont usually eat pork? Not sure........

I let chops marinate for a few hours. They were thin cuts, so I cooked them at 375 for 30 minutes.

loved these! I doubled the sauce. I also pan seared on both sides and didn't cook for as long as called. totally depends on the thickness of the chops so be careful!

I had 3 pork chops but I still doubled the sauce because it didn't really cover the chops with just one batch. WE enjoyed the flavor.  I also added onion and mushrooms with the meat.

This was a really good recipe, and very easy. Great for busy weeknights. I added sliced red peppers and onions and baked them with the pork. It came out delicious, and I'll be making this one again.

This was just an okay recipe for me.  The sause was really good and I did find that I had to bouble it in order to have enough for basting.  The chops came out kinda tough and that was disappointing :(  Was worth a try though.

These are really good. I use pork steaks instead of chops and they turn out tender. The marinate seems a little weird at first but when baked tastes so good on pork. I do drain off the liquid that accumulates when baking before I add the marinate the second time or they are too runny. I think I like them more than my family. Kind of reminds me of an asian flavor.

I followed this recipe almost exactly...I added a touch of honey to the sauce and put sliced onion and fresh mushrooms to the bottom of the pan.  I also added sliced pineapple to give it a hawaiian kick...then I added the pork chops on top and topped it with more pineapple. I gave it a four star rating because of the fact that I changed the recipe.  While it wasn't horrible...it wasn't the best either.  Hubby liked it, but I don't think I'll make again.

Easy, quick, and tasty. The Boy loves 'em. I found the sauce just sweet enough and my chops weren't dry at all. I think using bone-in chops is the key in recipes like this. Thanks Kim.

These were sooo delicious! One thing though, they turned out a little dry. I'm trying to figure out why; maybe I cooked them too long. Either way the flavor was absolutely delicious!

Pork chops were tender just like any oven recipe but the sauce was a bit too sweet. I am undecided if I will make this again.
