Yummy! I subbed tortilla chips for the corn tortillas, and cooked the chicken on a George Foreman grill. I didn't have cilantro, but I did have "Zesty Cilantro Salsa" which worked well. I also added 1 lg. chopped tomato to the bean mixture and served it with chips as a salsa. The flavor of the chicken was great even though I didn't have coriander. I am saving this recipe!

We loved this! I did make some changes though. I cut my chicken in half lengtwise in order to have more surface for the rub. I made the rub (omitting the cayenne for my kids) and let them sit for about 10 hours in the fridge. I grilled the chicken, sliced it and served on a bed of romaine topped with black beans, salsa, sour cream, the chicken and a little bit of cheese. The end result was very good, healthy, satisfying fare that even my kids enjoyed (after topping theirs with ranch instead of sour cream!)

Nom, Nom! This recipe was easy to prepare and delicious. I used leftover shredded chicken and added a 1/2 can of corn and chopped tomato to the beans.

I made this with some left over chicken from Costco one breast anf one thigh and drumstick cut up, added more salsa to the bean mixture, about 1 cup I think, and then layered the beans and then the chicken in Tortilla's covered with cheddar cheese and enchilada sauce. baked in a 350' oven for 30 minutes. Very good! Oh yeah, omit the lettuce!

I love a good Southwest style taco salad, but this one wasn’t my cup of tea.  It only has two flavors, chili powder and lime(or cilantro), all of which were overpowering.   Granted, it was easy to make for a quick last minute meal idea.   If I had to do it over, I would start with a good homemade black bean salsa made with fresh ingredients and garlic.

Only made the grilled chicken portion. Put in a tortilla with cilantro rice and black beans. Fantastic!  My whole family loved it.

This was great and we put it all in baked flour tortilla bowls.  My husband especially LOVED the black bean with cilantro and salsa mix.  We use fat-free yogurt with our mexi-dishes instead of sour cream and it gives it an awesome zing so we added that to the salad too.  Looked pretty and tasted yummy!

I have used allrecipes.com for over a year and I have found some pretty good recipes but this one is one of my favorites, and its the first one that I've left a review for. The bean and salsa mixture is delicious. The rub for the chicken gave it a good flavor and I really liked how the seasoning mixture stayed on the chicken while it was cooking on the grill. I didn't have any coriander so I made it w/o, I looking forward to trying it with the coriander.

This was very good!  I followed the recipe pretty closely with the exception of using ready-to-eat tostada shells, but next time I really want to try grilling the tortillas as the recipe states.  I cut the cayenne pepper in half to accommodate young eaters and the flavor was still very good, especially combined with the salsa/bean mixture.  In fact, there was so much flavor that we didn't even miss the cheese on these!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, MTCHYG!

I made half of this recipe for Hubs and me last night.  Hubs loved the seasoning on the chicken, but I felt after being grilled on a hot grill, the spices appeared to be burnt, however they didn’t taste burnt.  We both loved the bean/salsa combo.  Since cilantro isn’t a favorite of ours, I chose to use parsley instead, and only in the bean/salsa mixture, not in the salad.  We skipped the corn tortilla but I did serve the salad with tortilla chips.  We also opted to use some ranch salad dressing instead of the sour cream.  This was a really good salad and I know we’ll be making it again.  It’s great for these hot, humid summer days!

Delicious!  My DH and I really enjoyed our dinner tonight.  We had this filling salad and sliced cucumbers.  There wasn't a need to have anything else with it.  I did have one major chance with the recipe.  My chicken was already cooked.  I had roasted a whole bird and had a lot of meat leftover.  I made up the marinade in the morning and smeared it all over the cooked (cold) chicken breast.  At dinner time I threw it in a skillet to heat it and then proceeded with the recipe.  It was fantastic.  To my hubby's plate I added a little shredded cheese and fresh jalapeños.  We love hearty dinner salads in the summer time, and MTCHYG, yours didn't disappoint.  Thank you for sharing.

This was very good. I used store bought tostada bowls. I don't have a grill so just fried the chicken on the stove. The chicken was only okay but that's because I am not very skilled at cooking meat. I will make this again for sure!

This recipe was great. My son said it was the best chicken I've ever made.  I didn't have all the spices, so just substituted 4 tsp of taco seasoning and added brown sugar to that.  The salsa was great.  It's a keeper!

This was wonderful!  The chicken was fabulous and can stand on its own with any side dish.  The salsa and avocado added richness and creaminess, and the lime added a zing to it all.  It will now be in our regular rotation of dinners!

After I wasted a bunch of chili powder and olive oil I washed off the clumpy spice paste goop and then properly seasoned the chicken with some fajita seasoning after rubbing with olive oil.  If you're gonna marinade, then do so, otherwise apply oil and evenly sprinkle spice rub on the meat.  Also...not a hint of salt in this, not even gonna say anymore about that.  Mine was good though.

I followed this recipe exactly and was so psyched, thinking this would become one of my "keepers" (based on all the rave reviews). Wow. Were we ever disappointed. My husband, grown son and I found this dish to be rather bland and definitely not worth the prep work. We kicked it up with extra lime juice and it was just "okay".

This is fantastic.It is a beautiful salad. I wouldn't change one thing. I served it with the vegetarian Mexican inspired stuffed peppers from this site for a very filling healthy meal.One teeny thing,though, I NEVER consider avocado, lime and sour cream "optional"! Yum! Thanks for posting!

The chicken in this recipe is outstanding! I made it the way the recipe stated, except I didn't have cilantro, so I omitted it. It was fantastic! My picky eater even loved it. It doesn't need dressing, the salsa and black bean mixture with the sour cream were perfect. I did take the advice of another and sliced my chicken lengthwise to make it thinner and allowed the spices to cover more. I will definitely make this again!

Only made the chicken, not the salad. I thought the seasonings yielded very tasty chicken. I also used chicken tenderloins this guaranteeing tasty, moist chicken

Delicious!  It was a big hit! I tried the tortilla shells from the grocery but didn't like them.  Next time I will serve it over tortilla corn chips or maybe even blue corn chips.

We enjoyed this meal, although for our taste, the chicken was a bit bland.  Canned kernel corn in the black bean mixture added a nice texture.  It was easy to add spice by using hotter salsa.

This is such a versatile recipe. I followed it according to what I had on hand. Had some stuff, some I didn't. Threw some stuff in that I had that we enjoy in Mexican food. Everyone could top as they pleased - ranch, sour cream, cheese, peppers etc. my daughter turned her nose up to it at first - until she went back for seconds! Such amazing flavors and nice and fresh.

The chicken rub was phenomenal, and the salsa dressing was flavorful.

Loved it!  Just left out the cilantro because I'm not a fan. Use plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream and few white corn tortilla chips crumbled on the bottom and whole chips for scooping.

I was very good, I didn't have chicken breast so i used ground chicken. This recipe is a keeper.

The chicken came out delicious! So moist and flavorful.  I sliced my chicken breasts in half to make them thinner so they would cook faster. I rubbed the seasoning on quite heavy for lots of flavor and let them sit about 15 minutes.  I just got a tortilla shell baker from Pampered Chef so I put my tortilla in that and made bowls to serve it in.  Delicious! In addition to the avocado, sour cream and cilantro topping I added shredded Mexican blend cheese and diced tomatoes.

My first review ever on this site.  My husband and I absolutely LOVED this!  Added some grilled corn in with the salsa, broke the tortillas into pieces, and layered everything on top including some homemade guacamole.  Sooo good!  Will DEFINITELY make again!
