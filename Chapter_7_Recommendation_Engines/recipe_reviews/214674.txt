Simple, delicious, and with the July 4th holiday just around the corner this would be a great pound cake or short cake topper, not to mention vanilla ice cream!  I cut the recipe in half and used Splenda instead of sugar. Great after dinner treat!

We all enjoyed this fruit salad very much. I didn't add much sugar, just a couple tablespoons over the strawberries after I'd cut them, then I folded in the blueberries and bananas. At the last, I sprinkled in FRESH lemon juice. I think adding a full half cup of sugar would do a disservice to the natural sweetness of the fruit.

Beautiful, delicious and seasonally appropriate since strawberries and blueberries are plentiful and reasonably priced now. I liked the addition of the bananas, which provided a creamy contrast in texture as well as its role in the "red, white and blue." I skipped the sugar entirely and just gave it a drizzle of honey.  This was a perfect and fresh addtion to our Memorial Day Breakfast.

This went over very well at our holiday party tonight.  We had another family over, and the fruit was a hit with adults and kids alike.  My husband is not wild about blueberries, but even liked them in this, and said the bananas were "divine" with the "sauce."  Next time he wants me to make it with cherries instead of blueberries.

Quick, easy and delicious.  Did not add sugar because I thought the fruit was sweet enough.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

This was a very simple, festive, and tasty salad to make! Instead of sugar, I used about 3-5 tablespoons of honey, and mixed with equal parts lemon and lime juice. The honey created lots of "juice" for the fruit. The bananas did go a bit soggy after a few hours, but not as fast as they would have without the citrus. Pineapple or mango would work great as well. As long as the fruit is light enough in color, it makes a great contrast for the berries. This is also great served over pound cake, shortcake, angel food cake, etc, and topped with whipped cream. Yum!!

Very simple fruit salad. 1/2 cup of sugar is a bit much though. Half is more than enough or even a drizzle of honey.

This is the perfect patriotic dish.  It is colorful and you can use peak of the season berries with out adding a lot of sugar.  I took this to a garden club party.  It was a great success.  The recipe is perfect as written, however I skipped the sugar as the berries were very sweet and used the lemon juice over the bananas, adding them just before serving.  They loved it.

A simple and great recipe.  I tossed everything together, using just enough sugar to coat the fruit lightly, before leaving our house for a barbeque and it was ready by the time the food was served.  We've made this often with just strawberries and bananas, but the blueberries add a nice touch to the dish.

Very easy and tasty summer fruit salad, although I wish I had dialed back the sugar a bit from the original recipe.

This is not only a lovely salad, but makes a great breakfast or dessert.  Both the sugar and lemon juice are vital to this recipe.  However, if you don't have time to let the berries sit for 30 minutes, don't sweat it.  It's almost just as good if you just mix the ingredients altogether and just serve.  Thanks, ManassasMa, for a wonderful recipe.

Quick, easy, and delicious. Maybe a bit too much sugar for my tastes. I'll cut back to a quarter cup next time. The fruit is sweet enough!

Delicious fruit salad without added sugar! The bananas sweetened the salad nicely. I squeezed a little fresh lemon over the bananas prior to mixing and serving, kept them from turning brown.

Using raspberries, the fruit salad was  pretty when served on a leaf of red leaf (lettuce) and the lettuce captured the juices and syrup. I also made it as a buffet salad by lining a crystal bowl with red leaf and spooning the fruits into the middle . and after refrigerating, the fruits settled a bit . Using a solid spoon helped people scoop up as much "juice" as they wanted.

Light, refreshing and couldn’t be easier. I used a pint and a half of strawberries and about 3 Tbps of honey and lemon. No sugar and it was delicious. Also I put in the bananas just before serving it. Will make often especially now in the summer.

I put this over cottage cheese and enjoyed it very much as a side dish for a sandwich.

This was simple and great but as written...just too much sugar. I used 2 Tbsp of sugar instead and it was the perfect amount of sweet. Not overly sweet but just enough for the strawberries to create a glaze and mix with the blueberries and bananas. And the lemon added a nice touch, as well!

This worked very good.  I used powdered sugar instead.  I did cut back on the amount of sugar and lemon only because we are watching calories.  I will definitely be making it again!

Delectable! The lemon juice and sugar make a great combination that enhances the natural fruit flavors without overpowering them.
