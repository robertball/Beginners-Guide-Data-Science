Four and a half stars. Husband really liked it. These are the changes I made: used a full 32 oz. of Kitchen Basics original chicken stock. One can Italian-style stewed tomatoes instead of tomato paste. I also added about 5-6 oz of frozen chopped spinach (thawed and squeezed dry) to the sauteed onions, garlic and celery. I think this added to the texture and heartiness of the soup. As far as seasonings so, I added about 3/4 tsp of salt and about 1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper; also a dash of chipotle Tabasco. Kept the crushed red pepper as we like spicy food. Boiled pasta separately as per several reviewers' suggestions (thanks for that, by the way) and ladled soup over this in individual bowls. It really didn't even need cheese on top. Great flavor, low fat, wonderful way to eat some vegetables and get some fiber with the beans. Thanks for an easy soup recipe that I'll be happy to make several times this fall and winter.

This is the best pasta fagioli that I have ever tasted and I was raised on this stuff.  What I love most is that it is affordable, easy, and delicious.  The only bad thing is that it doesn't make a lot.

Not quite the Italian version I grew up with but good anyway. This is my version: No celery-substitute chopped carrots here (sweeter). Pepper flakes only to taste-don't use if you dont like(I dont). One can diced tomatoes instead of fresh, Ditalini pasta and kidney beans can be substututed for canellini if desired, more chicken broth to give it that soupier consistancy and a must is fresh grated parmesan cheese to sprinkle when served.

This recipe was a big hit with my family! We had a family dinner last week it was an Italian pot luck. I was told that I would never have to go to Olive Garden again for their soup. Thanks for the recipe :D ps. I used stewed tomatoes instead of peeling them and added more sauce and broth to have a more saucy soup. Great recipe!

Excellent recipe!  The only addition I made is some chopped spinach at the end.  Served with a chopped salad and garlic bread...a fabulous meatless soup...

Excellent Recipe!! As far as other reviewers have said i did not find this recipe to spicy. I actually added 1/2 tsp of red peppers, turned out fantastic. The recipe may benefit from 1 more can of chicken broth as it was very thick but fantastic. This is especially tue if you plan to store the leftovers and reheat later.

This soup is really good.  I added a can of pasta style tomatoes and used Cavattippi pasta and no beans but one could substitute kidney beans for the canellini beans.

Made this with normal pasta not spinach on several occasions. Now a regular in my house, I even remember this one of the top of my house now! Yummy but don't freeze and reheat it unless you don't mind tha pasta absorbing all the sauce

EXCEPIONAL RECIPE!!!  You don't need to go to the Olive Garden anymore to get good pasta fagioli!!!!   LOVED THIS RECIPE.    I did add two cans of chicken broth to it to stretch it and thin it out a little. I also shredded two fresh carrots. I did use one can of stewed tomatoes in place of two fresh tomatoes because I didn't have any fresh.  Also, I did cook the pasta separate since I don't like to cook the pasta in what I am making ever.  I also drained the beans first and rinsed them because I was afraid to add the liquid.   It was the BEST FAGIOLI we have ever made and I think is even better than the Olive Garden.   You won't be disappointed in this recipe!!!!!   THANK YOU FOR SHARING IT WITH THE WORLD!!!!!

I can't say I particularly cared for this. It was much too SPICY and had way too much celery. If you make this, you should decrease the amount of red pepper. The best part was the smell it made. May try this again with revisions.

This was incredible!  Just like Olive Garden's and I am so pleased.  DEFINITELY will be rotated into my "usual" meal planning dishes.  I doubled the chicken broth amount though because I like it really soupy.  I also did not use the spinach pasta but instead used, "small macaroni salad" noodles and it worked great!  Cannellini beans were also not in-stock at my small-town store so I used Great Northern beans and it was still fabulous.  Very easy to prepare: HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you're thinking of a slow-cooker meal!  Put all ingredients in and let it ride for 4+ hrs. on HIGH or 6+ hrs. on LOW.  Very filling and flavorful.  BEAUTIFUL!  Thanks, Star :)

Great recipe! It's similar to minestrone soup recipes I've tried. I found it a little spicy the first time I made it, so I cut the red pepper in half. I wanted to make the soup a little hardier, so I sauteed four pieces of bacon with the celery and onions. After adding the broth, I also threw in a few handfuls of spinach. I think the spinach absorbed some of the liquid, so I had to add an extra cup of chicken broth. Excellent!

This was a great base recipe for creating a delicious soup.  I made some changes: used 32 oz. organic chicken broth, used canned Italian-style diced tomatoes (with onions, basil, and thyme), traded the spinach pasta out for orzo (which I boiled before adding to the broth), used kidney beans (without liquid) instead of cannellini, added garbanzo beans, and stirred in some spicy turkey sausage (because I wanted this to be meaty).  Because the sausage was spicy, I didn't add the red pepper flakes and I didn't add any salt, since the broth had enough sodium.  I shredded and added about 1/2 c. baby spinach, as well. It is pretty fantastic and I'll definitely revisit this recipe!

This recipe is just the best.  I make it any number of times during the year and it disappears almost as fast as I make it.

Cooking time is not long enough. Celery was still crunchy, ick. I doubled the chicken broth and tomato sauce because everyone else is right; there is just not enough liquid. Do cook the pasta separately. It gets 4 stars for the flavor and ease of preparation but the amounts of ingredients and cooking time are way off... listen to the reviews on this one!

My family loved this with my adjustments: I used "ground" red pepper (I added less, we don't like it to hot), and "canned" diced tomatoes with garlic + onion instead of fresh tomato. I also "doubled" the recipe (got big eaters) so I put one can cannellini beans and one can small red kidney beans. I also added fresh baby spinach and shredded carrotts (cut up smaller). I cooked up one lb ground beef and one lb ground sweet Italian sauceage (sauteed onion, + celery with it). Served it with fresh baked bread. Although my favorite is the Olive Gardens pasta fagioli and I was hoping this would taste like theirs (but it didn't), I gave it four stars mainly because this is a good basic recipe. Will definiately make again, just might make a few more adjustments on the spices. A very hearty soup!

What a great recipe! I found out I have high cholesterol (I'm only 25-yikes!) and this fits nicely into my diet changes. I couldn't find spinach pasta at Wal-Mart, so bought "wacky mac" instead. I also substituted Italian Style Tomatos with no added salt for the fresh tomatos like other reviewers suggested. Will definately be making this again. Thanks for the quick, easy, healthy, and delicious recipe :)

Excellent soup recipe.  Followed recipe quite closely, except I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and did not have tomato sauce so added half a small can of tomato paste and added more broth.  I had fresh parsley, and added a little more pasta (I used wholewheat elbows instead of spinach pasta).  Soup was delicious and everyone loved it.  Definitely a keeper!  The only shame was that there was no leftovers!

I had never made Pasta Fagioli nor tasted it -- although it's a favorite of my Italian husband.  I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to make.  I followed the recipe although I used a 15 oz. can of Italian diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  I made it earlier in the afternoon and let it sit for a couple hours to let all the flavors meld.  I heated it back up to a low simmer in the same pan 15 minutes before we were ready to eat.  It was absolutely delicious - I served with some crusty bread and a salad as suggested.    My husband raved about it and suggested we bring some to his mother as part of our weekly Sunday night dinner with her....that was a huge compliment.  I will definitely make this again and may try adding some fresh chopped spinach leaves in the last 10 minutes of cooking.

Correction should be made to original recipe in reference to "2 stalks of celery"; should read "2 ribs".  Two stalks would yield about about 8 cups of celery....way too much.  Other than that, soup was quick and easy to prepare and tasted good too.

This was yummy! I had a little extra pasta I wanted to use up so I cooked it and added it.   I should  have added more brooth so the soup would not be so thick.  My mistake.  Thanks for sharing.

This soup is increadibly good, especially on a chilly fall evening. Quick and easy. I served it with cheddar garlic biscuits, what a meal. There are only two of us, so there was enough for another meal. The next night I added left over sloppy joe.

Delicious vegetarian soup! Rather than cutting fresh tomatoes (which I didnt have) I used Italian style stewed canned tomatoes and it gave it a very "Olive Garden" flare...great recipe!

This was very good.  The directions dont tell you what to cook the first few ingredients in so I used olive oil.  Also there is not quite enough liquid to cook the pasta in and it became too dry so I doubled the broth and tomato sauce.  That worked out very well.  I am giving 3 stars for these shortfalls but would give it higher on taste.  I realized that I was out of cannellini beans so I subbed garbanzo beans instead and told the kids they were teeny tiny canned potatoes and they ate it up!  LOL  Tasty recipe but the directions need adjusting.  I will make again with the changes to the liquids.  *** This recipe has since been edited to instruct you to cook the veggies in olive oil.  Glad to see it was edited since my review***

I was raised on this stuff. Best I have ever had. I doubled the recipe and added 2 Italian sausage sliced 1/2" thick and browned in pan before onions and celery. Also added chopped carots. Outstanding

This was a great soup! I had whole red chili's that I crushed so mine was quite spicy, which I loved. I used a mix of green and orange pasta with corkscrews also in there. I had some homemade chicken broth but not quite enough so I had to add some water.

One of our new favorites.  I added fresh spinach, 1/2 cup pasta, (instead of the spinach pasta) mushrooms and 3 turkey italian sausage links (cooked and sliced into coins).

This soup was good, however a bit bland when following recipe exactly.  I am the type of cook (HUGE foodies, my hubby and I) if I'm not creating something, I'm using a recipe and changing it to suit our tastes like most cooks do.  However I like to give every recipe a fair taste before dicing it up. I did not add celery.  The only thing celery is good for is with peanut butter or cream cheese on it, or other dips, but cooked, it's just yuck.  Use celery seed instead if you want the celery flavor in it.   I put all of my dried spices in cheesecloth and tied it up and dropped it in the soup pot.  Also added much more garlic and the squeeze of a fresh lemon, 1/4 cup white wine, smoky pepper, 1 tsp of Balsamic vinegar and salted to taste and it was fantastic.  Overall a good base recipe to just make your own changes with.

I got addicted to Pasta Fagioli thanks to the Olive Garden.  Since that's quite a drive from here, I had to feed my addiction by creating my own!  This recipe makes an amazinly delicious soup.  The Spinach pasta is key (I have tried other varieties but it's just not the same).  I have of couse tweaked this recipe to my own tastes since then, but it didn't have far to go to perfection.  So easy, so good!!!

We loved this recipe!  Had it for dinner the other night and having it again tonight with some crusty bread.  

My husband used a little beef broth mixed with the chicken broth because he didn't have enough. Other than that we did the recipe as it reads.

Excellent soup.  A big hit in our house.  I added spicy homemade sausage meatballs, too!  I also added extra chicken broth for more broth. And the fresh grated parm cheese is a must!

I have made this recipe 3 times now, each time with a different kind of bean, and each time it turns out awesome!!  I recommend doubling the recipe as it doesn't make a lot.  I have always used the canned tomatoes instaed of fresh; it tastes better.  This time I didn't have any fresh garlic so I substituted garlic powder and added more broth. SSSo good with freshly grated parm cheese on top!!  Healthy too!

This is a great soup that can be a last minute decision what with the ingredients being basic staples in most kitchens.  It is very easy to control the thickness of the soup with additional chicken broth to your liking.  Same with adding a bacon or sausage as others suggested. For our household, we enjoyed a "meatless" meal for a change and actually would have liked more beans.  And since we prefer beans with a softer texture, I simmered those in a separate pot until it was time to add them to the soup.  Next time I will add a larger can.  The only other thing I changed was I sauted the veggies and spices in a bit of canola oil. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This recipe was great! I took the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and it really helped: -I used carrots instead of celery -Stewed canned tomatoes instead of whole -Kidney beans instead of cannelini  -Added more chicken broth to give it a soupier consistency -Used regular pasta -Put in thawed and dried frozen spinach  This was a great fall recipe as it was hearty without being too heavy.  I will definitely do this again!

Wow!  I had never even had pasta fagioli before, but I love anything Italian, so I tried it.  The recipe has amazing flavor and is so easy to make!  I would recommend doubling the recipe as it didn't seem to make much.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

Tried this as it was on recipe of the day, not expecting much.  Boy, was I wrong!  My husband, who never says much, told me to be sure and keep this.  I made due with what I had..no celery, used celery seed..no tomato sauce, used a can of tomato soup...no fresh garlic, used roasted in the jar..no cannellini beans, used great northern. This was one of my favorites.  Thank you!!

I completely understand why people would say it is too spicy. It def has a kick at the end that is not in most traditional Pasta Fagioli. HOWEVER, I love love love spicy food so it was the perfect addition for me! If you are NOT a fan of spicy then simply omit the pepper flakes. I threw in a handful of frozen spinach cause I had it on hand. WONDERFUL!!!!

I made this soup this past weekend and what a treat!  My husband had not had what he called "good" pasta fagioli since he was a child.  I made a few revisions, however.  We are not big fans of a lot of cooked celery, so I just added about 1/4 tsp. of celery seed to the recipe.  I also pre-boiled the pasta before adding it to the soup.  My husband said it was THE BEST he had ever eaten.  I think next time, however, I will have to double the recipe!  Thank you Star Pooley for sharing your recipe with us.  It was so good, I do not even plan on trying any of the other recipes listed!

Delicious,
I browned and crumbled 1/2lb sausage, then added the celery, onion and garlic to it. Used canned fire roasted tomatos instead of fresh, and added fresh chopped spinach at the end. I added more chicken broth to create a less dense soup. Brought it to work and everyone loved it. Thanks for the recipe

The flavor of this soup was delicious. However, I made a couple of mistakes. First, I put it in the crock pot, second I added the uncooked pasta (added too much). I managed to save it from getting too thick (soup to me should be soupy). Like I said, the flavor was delicious!

We loved this!  Add Parmesan cheese and it makes it better!  We removed the beans because we didn't have them on hand and added rotini pasta because  it was the only pasta we had!

Awesome!  So flavorful and perfect consistency. 

I ended up only using 1/2 a can of beans... as well as adding 1/2 cup frozen spinach + 1 carrot.  This soup is so flexible, adding anything could be great! 

I also learned how to blanch tomatoes as a result of this recipe... so that was fun.  :)

I eliminated the chopped tomatoes and tomato sauce, and instead used 2 cups Cento All-in-One Crushed Tomatoes and 3 cups chicken broth. I also use Ditalini instead of spinach pasta, as that is our family's tradition for this dish.

I loved this! And it's great for a potluck where you need a vegetarian dish. Just use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock.

This was divine! I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used a can of diced tomatoes, and added about 1/4 cup of ketchup. Yep, ketchup. You can't even tell the difference, IMO. I used ditalini pasta instead of spinach pasta, and added a lot more red pepper flakes. I will make this again, thanks!

Excellent dish!  I omitted the celery, used a strong, homemade turkey stock instead of canned chicken broth, and used regular pasta.  I also doubled the recipe.  I love soup, and am very picky about my soups, but this is a definite keeper!   I was generous with the red pepper flakes, because hubby likes heat.  I don't, but it was still delicious!  Thank you for posting!

We enjoyed this very much....of course,like most subscribers, I "tweaked"it a bit...I added an extra can of broth, used petite diced tomatoes undrained instead of fresh and added some shredded grilled chicken I had leftover....great soup for a chilly evening with some garlic bread!

I followed this to a T except I didn't have the spinach pasta, it was plain pasta and I did add some fresh chopped spinach...however, nothing could have saved the "soup" part of the soup. By the time it simmered as in the recipe I had paste, so I added more liquid in order to keep some "soup"...even with that when I tasted it the tomatoe sauce part was absolutely flavorless (it still tasted like tomatoe sauce right out of a can) except for being hot from too much pepper flakes. I ended up adding another can of chicken broth, some dehydrated kale, but nothing could bring this soup up to speed. I've discovered that cooking with tomato sauce of any kind from scratch is a delicate balance of seasonings and simmering...otherwise its very acidic, thin, tasteless. This doesn't offer that.

I really enjoyed this soup. A couple of changes I made, I used a small can of chick peas and only half the can of white beans. Then I pureed the rest of the can of beans and added that to thicken the soup a bit. I also chopped up some baby spinach and added romano cheese right to the soup. Like others recommended, I cooked the pasta (I used ditalini) separately and will just add it in when I have a bowl. I also found the red pepper a bit too hot for me so ended up adding more tomato sauce to dilute that a bit. Next time will just cut the red pepper in half. Also, after simmering the broth before adding the beans I found it a little "chunky" for my liking, kind of like a salsa so I pureed in the blender, then added the beans.

I made this the other night.  It was fast & easy and tasted great!  I used crushed tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce and orzo instead of the spinach pasta.  I also added a can of chopped spinach.  Will definitely make over and over again!  Thanks for sharing this one!

The celery was crunchy. Don't add the spices until you add the liquids. The pasta takes longer than 10 minutes on simmer.

Awesome recipe - as per others added 1/2 lb of bacon; used 14 oz can of diced tomatoes in place of fresh; drained cannelli beans and added 1 c fresh spinach.  Also cooked pasta separately.  Result = incredibly filling, tasty recipe that husband enjoyed three bowls of for dinner.

Really good soup.  I added some additional garlic powder and basil, also added a can of drained kidney beans.  For the pasta I used acini di pepe (small round balls of pasta).

I doubled the recipe and made a few changes.  I used 2 cans of chopped tomatoes, 2 cans of chicken broth and 2 cans of water to make it more soupy.  I also added carrots and smoked sausage (my husband is not a fan of meatless ;-)  It was great!

I made this last night for my whole family (kids are 4, 2.5 and 1yo), doubting the whole time my kids would really like it.  There wasn't a drop left at the end of dinner!  I added more pasta than called for, along with some leftover ground meat we had from the night before and it made it a little thicker, which made it easier for my kids to eat.  Thank you for a delicious recipe and new meal to make for the kiddos!

This turned out just awesome!  Prepared it exactly as the recipe directed with the only exception that I substituted 2 teaspoons of lemon juice in place of the salt.  And all around hearty soup, very good for the coming cold weather.  Five stars!

This is very good and very easy. Quite spicy so if you like it a bit milder cut down on the hot pepper. The last 10 minutes of cooking I add a bit of spinach (or swiss chard) and a bit of pasta.

My nonna never ever used tomato in her pasta e fagioli.  I've had it both ways.  It is much better without the tomato.  It is less acidic.  More fresh to the palate

For the beans, we use canellini cooked slowly with a with a rind of Parmesano-Reggiano  For noodles, we always use broken pappardelle or ditalini.  And on pasta fagioli night, the shaker of crushed red pepper was always on the table!

This was superb, easy and filling without being heavy.  I used elbow macaroni and for half of the beans I had to substitute white hominy because I didn't have enough cannellini beans.  The second time I substituted all canned diced tomatoes and twice as much red pepper flakes.  Perfect

I tweaked this recipe and it is to die for! First, I used a crock pot and cooked on high for 4 hours. I doubled all the ingredients, making the following changes.
Instead of 2 tomatoes, I used a can of fire roasted tomatoes. Instead of tomato sauce, I used 1/2 can of tomato paste (small). I browned 2 # of spicy Italian sausage, drained it, and added to crock pot. During the last 1/2 hour, I added ditalini pasta and a bag of fresh spinach.
Top with fresh grated Parmesan cheese and serve with crusty Italian bread.

I made this last night for my wife and I, and we both loved it. We nearly always try a recipe per instructions for the first time and I'm very glad we did. The only addition we made was some a crusty french loaf and butter on the side. Delicious.

This recipe is great and so easy.  The only change I made was do not add the pasta in.  I added it the first time and the pasta sucked up the juice.  So the second time I added it to the bowls as I serviced it and it much better.  The whole family loves it and it's very hard to find something they will all eat.

The cook time is WAY off. The pasta doesn't cook in 10 minutes, as someone else mentioned. (Taste-test until it's cooked, or 20 min). The celery doesn't cook in 40, or pretty much at all with the onion at the beginning. (Cook celery and carrot if using first until semi-soft, then add the onions and garlic and cook until they are translucent). Also, use 2 cans of broth, or 1 1/2. I like thick soups more than thin ones, but this had hardly any soup texture to it. No way the cook who created this recipe followed it him/herself or everything would end up undercooked.

Wow! What a great recipe and so easy. Me and my boyfriend made this for dinner the other night and were amazed by the flavor. I added more chicken broth, tomato sauce, and frozen mixed vegetables the next night to the leftovers to stretch it and it only got better. Thanks for the great soup!

My family loves this!  I changed a few things, not because it wasn't great but because I eat vegetarian and the rest of my family doesn't.  I used vegetable stock instead of chicken broth, I used one can of Hunt's diced fire roasted tomatoes (with liquid) instead of fresh and I've used several different kinds of pasta.  I simmer it for 15 minutes and add the beans.  I then remove enough for myself and add diced or shredded chicken for the rest of the family.  Served with roasted Pugliese bread and my family raves every time!!!  They make me feel like a gourmet cook!!! Thanks for the great recipe Star!

It was very good, but alot of trouble for such a small amount of soup.  I added fresh spinach just before serving and that was really good, but as I stated, alot of work for the end result.

This recipe is so simple I canmake it after work and have a meal on the table quickly.  The ingredients are basic so that it is typically something I have on hand.  With a nice loaf of garlic bread it makes a great meal.  My daughter requests this meal weekly.

Very good, followed recipe exactly except for substituting the pasta for ditalini.  I cooked that seperately and added to the soup right before I ate it.  Excellent with crusty garlic bread and parmesan cheese on top.

If you like a veg heavy, tomatoey Pasta Fagioli this is a good recipe for you.  It was tasty enough and I might make this again, but I would probably make quite a few changes.    It wasn't as savory as Pasta Fagioli typically is.  I also like mine more creamy and this definitely ins't a creamy soup, very tomatoey (I expected as much, but still a definite point for why I wasn't particularly happy with it).  If you want a creamy and/or savory Pasta Fagioli, this isn't your recipe.

This is my favorite soup ever! It is perfect the way the recipe is written. I used a little olive oil for the celery, onion and seasonings part. I keep finding canellinis on sale now which is good! I will be making this often during the cold months. Thank you so much for a completely yummy and healthy recipe!!  PS:  If it was too spicy for you, next time go easy on the red pepper flakes. You can always add more, but you cannot remove them once you've added them.

This soup was wonderful with a few, minor, changes.  Instead of chopping my own tomatoes, I used 1 14.5 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes and added 2.25 cups of low sodium chicken broth.  It was fantastic!

Easy delicious recipe! I mostly followed the recipe but did make some changes:  sauteed the onion and celery in a little olive oil (recipe doesn't mention any oil), used a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh, added more chicken stock during the cooking (used stock vs broth) to keep it soupy, Also used dried homemade noodles instead of spinach pasta. We didn't find it too spicy at all. And it was excellent with a salad and garlic bread. I have loved all but one of the recipes on this site! Glad I found it!

Exceptional!  I've been preparing pasta fagioli my whole life, but this beats my recipe!  Deelish and less clean up by cooking the pasta in the sauce.  My only changes ~ I substituted basil for the Italian seasoning and I omitted the celery.  I've passed this recipe on to friends and family...

I followed other reviewers advice/changes and this is absolutely the best. I also like that it doesn't make too much.  Omitted parsley, added spinach to veggies, used can of italian tomatoes instead of fresh and sauce, added precooked small meatballs (ground beef w/seasoning only) and precooked veggie curl pasta.  I also used a tablespoon of jarred pesto in lieu of the italian seasoning.  I made it last night and had for lunch today.

Awesome! My mother-in-law makes Pasta Fagioli and I could never remember her recipe. The only change I made was to double the pasta and cut the onions and celery. Thanks, I've been trying to make this for 25 yrs! PJB Texas

Extremely simple to make and very tasty. Added a 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes with juices instead of tomato sauce and tomatoes and this worked out just fine.  Also just plain rotini....quite yummy!

Great recipe. I cheated a little and started with a leftover ham bone. I used that to grease the pot slightly before sauteing the onion, garlic, and celery. After adding tarragon, basil, red pepper, and oregano, I added about 12 cups of water, 4 chicken bouillon cubes and a chopped up tomato. I boiled this for two hours until all the remaining meat fell off the bone, added two cans of cannellini beans and cooked the pasta in a separate pot. I used the little tiny tube pasta. Then I boiled the soup an hour longer before adding the pasta. At the end I added a splash (1/3 cup) of half and half. I didn't add the tomato sauce since I like my pasta fagioli to be more of a white soup and I didn't have any spinach. This was gourmet quality soup that you usually only find in a very high end Italian restaurant. Delicious!

My husband & I really liked this recipe. I did take other's suggestion and cooked the pasta seperately, al dente, then added it while the soup was still hot. It absorbed some, but  not too much of the broth.  I also reversed the chicken broth/tomato sauce quantities. We will be using this hearty soup recipe again.

I have tried many, having enjoyed, recipes posted but this, by far, is the best.  I received rave reviews after serving the pasta fagioli.  I did alter the recipe slightly by adding 8 small canned tomatoes (drained) instead of off the vine tomatoes as I wasn't sure I'd be successful in peeling the them.  Great soup.

This recipe is great, and is now posted on my refrigerator!  I love Pasta Fagioli but for some reason I had never made it at home before.  The great thing about this soup is that with the exception of the celery, everyone should already have all the ingredients in their pantry.  I made the recipe as given the first time, but now substitute a medium can of diced tomatoes for the 2 medium tomatoes and it’s just fine.  If you can’t fine cannellini beans where you live (is that possible in this day and age?) any canned white bean will do.

I made this recipe and it was fantastic.  The only addition I made was to saute the celery & onion in about two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil.
Fantastic.

This recipe is very good BUT it was a bit tart (tomatoes) so I added a tbls. sugarand it was fine.
Also, since I am Italian & missed a more beef flavor to the fagioli, I did what my Italian chef uncle used to do...dice up a beef hot dog in tiny pieces and add to it during a simmering phase. You wouldn't believe the difference...YUM! (I use organic beef hot dogs from Whole Foods).
Thank you fo rthis recipe.

This was great!  I used this as a starting point and I made some changes.  I do not like fresh tomatoes so I used 2 cans of stewed and cut the broth in half.  I also added shreaded carrots, more seasoning and lean ground beef.  It came out more as a stew then a soup and even my husband liked it and he usually prefers a more hearty meal. Thanks Star Pooley for this one!

This soup was delicious. Hubby and I both loved it and I plan to make it often. The only change I made was that I used a one pound can of stewed tomatoes in place of the fresh tomatoes and tomato sauce.

I love hot Italian sausage so I add that, and another can of chicken broth,a few carrots for me, and a can of garbonzo beans to stetch the recipie out a bit as my husband loves taking it to work the next day for lunch.

I have this simmering as I write.  And of course, I have tasted it; well, actually, after the first taste I got a bigger spoon so I could try more!  It is excellent.  I used my own chicken broth and a large can of diced tomatoes and I've chopped up left over pasta.  I'll serve it with a some garlic toast for a very late supper with DH when he gets home.  He'll love it.

This was delicious. I doubled some of the ingredients to yield a larger amount of soup. I doubled the following: chicken broth, sauce, beans and pasta. The rest of the recipe I left as is with the exception of the tomatoes. I used diced, canned instead of fresh. It does have a little heat to it but my kids still enjoyed it. I'll will be saving this one to make in the future.

This is almost exactly how I make my Pasta Fagioli, except I don't use red pepper flakes; don't like too much heat. I use ditilini pasta and sprinkle on some parmesan cheese. I usually double my recipe and only use 1 (8oz) can of tomato sauce for a double recipe. YUMMMy! Served with some nice crusty bread and a salad, for a great quick meal. Think I'll make some right now; it's rather blustery outside today.

Excellent soup! In this recipe, I added shredded chicken chunks for a hearty meal and replaced celery with sliced carrots. Eat with crusty french bread and you've got a complete meal. We usually don't finish our leftovers, but my family finished the whole soup in less than a week!

pretty bland. added extra garlic and parsley, as well as white pepper and basil. this can easily be made into a vegetarian soup by substituting vegetable broth for the chicken broth. I omitted the bean liquid (yuck!) and it still came out just fine.

This was very good and reminded me of Olive Garden's.  I used 1 stalk of celery and 1 carrot to make it sweater.  I used slightly less of the red pepper and I'm glad I did as I don't like things too spicy.  Topped it off with a little parmesean and motzerella cheese.  Delish!

I think I put too many onions in, I used a medium and should have used a small. but the taste was great.

Delicious!  I didn't feel like dealing with the peeling and chopping of the tomatoes so I used 1 can of roasted diced tomatoes in their place.

I took the advice of another review and put this in the slow cooker, since I was going to be gone all afternoon. One bit of advice if you cook it that was- put the pasta in maybe halfway. My pasta was complete mush by the end of cooking, so that it had to all be picked out. I'm going to cook some more to go in the rest of it, but needless to say it was disappointing. My husband said the soup was "OK," but asked me not to make this recipe again.

This was quite good but needed some adjustments. After letting the vegetables simmer and then letting the pasta cook, the soup was way too thick. So I ended up adding an extra cup of chicken broth and about a quarter cup of red wine. I also added some salt, sugar, and extra Italian seasoning. In addition, I had to substitute canned tomatoes for fresh, a bit of cayenne pepper pepper for red pepper flakes, and black-eyed peas for cannellini beans because those were what I had. Oh--and when I added the black-eyed peas, I threw in some broccoli florets, too, just because we needed to use them. As the soup turned out, my husband and I really liked it.

Thought this was great and neighbors did too.. they asked for recipe.  I couldn't find spinach pasta so used the tri-flavor pasta.  My husband wasn't thrilled with the texture of canned beans.  I usually cook beans (dried) until they are soft so I might add the beans earlier next time to let them cook a bit more.

I found this soup to be rather bland.  I didn't use celery because I didn't have any on hand, but I'm not sure that would have changed the flavor all that much.  I also added 2 links of spicy turkey italian sausage, which I removed from the casings and browned with the onions and garlic.  I thought would have added a lot of extra flavor, but I guess I was wrong.  The soup was edible, but not this spectacular soup I was expecting based on the reviews.

The way I do it is to chop and fry bacon first then add the onion, etc.   The I put most of the can of canelli beans into the food processor.  When i add that to the soup, it becomes creamy and really delicous.

Excellent! I did add a can of fire roasted tomatoes along with the fresh, Italian rustic tri-colored pasta (Harris Teeter) instead of spinach pasta, and tossed in a handful of fresh spinach right before serving. Also, some freshly grated parmesan cheese on top...deleesh! Served alongside a big crisp Italian salad and homemade roasted garlic ciabatta bread...YUM! Thanks for a great recipe!

Great soup!  I didn't have any fresh tomatos, so had to use a can of Rotel!  That gave it a bit of a punch, but it was nice!  Used 1 can of kidney beans as that too, is all I had on hand.  I also used 2 cartons of chicken broth as I was having extra people for dinner so thought I'd make it stretch. I didn't add extra seasonings to counter the extra broth.  I didn't look close at the pasta amount and dumped the whole box of Rigatoni in.  Whoops!  But it was fine.  My kids enjoyed the extra pasta.  I served it with French bread and topped with parm. cheese.  I found it to have excellent flavor, and I tend to like things "well seasoned.  Thanks for the recipe idea!

After 27 years of marriage and many recipes, I have finally found a Pasta E Fagioli soup that my husband says tastes like the one his Italian grandmother made!  This is a very simple recipe as well.   I used Great Northern beans as the cannellini beans were unavailable, but other than that, I made the soup as directed.  I know this will be a regular addition to my menus.  Thanks!

Delicious and very easy to make! I substituted fresh chopped spinach for the parsley and it tasted awesome. Also once I goofed when making it and bought Great Northern beans instead of cannellini beans, and it was just as good if not a little better.

My Family loves Italian Food. On a cold Winter's night This recipie is great! Seconds were certainly in demand considering soup is not, generally, a favorite with the family. The second time I make make this recipie I will add a few slices of home made Italian sweet sausage and omit the tomatoe sauce using quartered tomatoes instead. The little change is my great grandaughter's suggestion. Thank you so much for allowing me to have free membership in your organization.

This was really tasty. We used whole wheat pasta instead of spinach pasta (because I couldn't find it) and it was great. The red pepper gives it a nice little zing, which I loved. Next time I will double the recipe, as this really just makes very little. Very yummy, though. We gobbled it right up!

Two thumbs up!  This soup has become my new favorite!!!  Instead of the 2 regular tomatoes, I used 1 can of the "Del Monte Diced Tomatoes with Basil, Garlic, and Oregano."  And, I love spicey foods so I doubled the amount of red pepper.  Perfect!  Way to go Star Pooley!

I didn't bother peeling the tomatoes & served the soup with whole wheat small shells (which I cooked separately so they wouldn't get too mushy when reheating the leftover soup).  I gave this 4 stars as I thought the original recipe was too spicy.  I only used 1/8 tsp. crushed red pepper & still needed to add one more can of chicken broth to dilute the taste of the flakes.  With the extra can of broth, I thought it was VERY good though & would make this again.

Absolutely Excellent!I'm sensitive to tomatoes/paste so I used dark red kidney beans instead.  Added the chopped spinach & some diced carrots - Absolutely fabulous!THIS is now my pasta fagioli recipe..Thanks Star! p.s. -Loving the crushed red pepper effect!

I made this recipe recently and substituted the 2 tomatoes with a can of stewed tomatoes and it was still very bland.  I added more of all of the seasoning and garlic and that helped a lot.  If you make this as written, be prepared for it to have little flavor.

We have made this many times and love it!  Changes I made:    substitute ditalini pasta for spinach pasta, also add 1 tsp of basil.  Suggest adding more chicken broth  than the recipe calls for, otherwise the resulting soup is pretty thick.

For myself, there is too much celery and hot pepper flakes. Any type of small pasta can be used instead of spinach pasta.

My wife and I loved this recipe. It was the best pasta fagioli soup we ever had and we both come from Italian American backgrounds.
I doubled the recipe with the exception of the onion and made plastic containers filled with it and froze it. It freezes well with Ditalini (didnt use spinach pasta and used 3 stalks of celery) in it too, this way we just "grab and go" and take a container to work for lunch! Made 8 plastic containers for the freezer.
Thank you Star Pooley for a great recipe!

We really loved this as a family.  Great taste and texture.  The only changes I made was vegetable broth (to make it vegetarian) and I didn't have spinach pasta so used plain.  It still came out fantastic, and the leftovers reheat well so I had a bonus for lunch!  I think that next time I will take the suggestion of adding some spinach to the soup, as that sounds tasty.

the taste was great, but the complaint I have is it called for only 1 can 14.2 oz. chicken Broth?  I made it with 2-32 oz. cans, and 1½ cups of water and came out great.  Also for soup I use Ditallini pasta, not the larger pasta as shown here as it absorbs too much of the liquid.  Other than that the soup was delicious!

I had to add more seasoning to this recipe; as it sat it was just a little too bland for my kids to really enjoy. I added Italian seasoning, a good dose of salt & pepper, fresh rosemary and tyme.  I also added beef & Italian sausage since we're such meat eaters in our house. With the additions, it came out wonderfully and made it to my permanent recipe box.

My husband always get this when we go out to Italian restaurants so I thought I would make this. But he does like meat so I put ground beef in and he could not find the cannellini beans at the store so I used white navy beans that I already had and beings I used the beef I used beef broth instead of chicken. We loved it although it is now completely different. Next time I will make it according to directions, I'll get the beans.

Lovely stuff.  I made some adjustments to use what I had-vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, a can diced Italian-seasoned tomatoes instead of fresh, so I skipped the Italian seasoning and the tomato sauce. And I used whole wheat Rotini, as that's what I had open.  I agree that the celery flavor is definitely there, but by the fourth or fifth bite I was enjoying it.  The pepper flakes add just enough heat; I adjusted the garlic and parsley to our own taste.  The cannelini beans are perfect in this.  I might add some diced carrots to increase the vegetable content next time, but this was pretty much perfect and a quick, easy soup.

This was excellent! I used 1 can of diced tomatoes instead of 2 fresh, 1 carton of stock instead of a can, and a 14.5 oz. can of tomato sauce. The red pepper flakes made it have a wonderful spicy flavor but not too strong. I used 1/2 cup ditalini pasta. I served this with 'bread machine rolls' found here on allrecipes. Would definitely make again!

I tried the recipe--I think it is great.  I did not have any lima beans so I used dark kidney beans.  Did not have any tomatoe sauce, so I used a small tin of tomatoe paste and the same amount of water.It is still yummy.

I don't know if I read the ingredients wrong, but 14 oz of chicken broth isn't enough liquid to make this a soup. Mine ended up very dry, especially after adding the pasta. Next time I will cook the pasta seperately and then add it. I ended up adding more chicken broth (about a cup) and 2 cups of water just to make it soupy. Also, I think pasta AND beans made it too starchy. Next time, it's one or the other. The flavor was ok though.

I personally don't like crunchy veggies in my soups and the cook time for the celery was insufficient to make it tender, even after sauteing an extra  10 min and simmering for half an hour.  I think steaming the celery separately would have done the trick.  Otherwise a good classic blend of flavors. I think V8 subs well for the tomato sauce, and canned diced tomatoes as well.  Thanks for submitting!

I made this for supper tonight, I had all the ingredients at home, and it went together very quickly.    I used stewed tomatoes in place of the tomatoes and whole wheat pasta, and my husband raved over it.  Said I can make this again and again.  And I will, had lots of flavor

Good quick basic recipe.  I didnt like the tomato sauce aspect, so justbused ancann of petite dice tomatoes with the juice, then added some extra vine ripe tomatoes. Also added one turnipnand one carrot, diced, then one finely diced Italian chicken sausage . Very tasty.

I followed the recipe except I substituted vegetarian broth for chicken broth. The pasta fagioli had a little bit more spiciness to it then I had anticipated...Good thing I love spicey foods! I'll definitely be making this again, I loved it!

Didn't change, and this recipe was fantastic!  My fiance gobbled it up & took some for lunch today too! Had no celery on hand, don't think i would have added anyway, not a big fan. i Finely chopped the onion, used about 20oz total of Chick.broth. Used 1 full cup of uncooked Ditalini pasta.  Added 1 uncooked/chopped up chick. breast at the same time i added the pasta.  Used a 19.5oz can of beans, liquid and all, needed the liquid(which i added when i added the pasta) to balance the extra pasta used.  Last 10mins when i added the beans, i also added about 4cups of fresh spinach.  DELISH!!!  will be making this again & again & again!  Thanks Star!

A very good traditional recipe.  Just a tip:  Slip off the outer papery husk on the beans, canned or cooled and cooked from dry.  These husks can spoil the consistency of the soup and can also get stuck in diners' throats - not a pleasant happening!

Delicious as is! The only thing I might change is cut down the beans to half a can as it was a little chunkier than I prefer.

I made this soup last weekend and it was a hit. I went a little over-board with the pasta so it soaked up the soup a bit but it was hearty and soo tasty. I shredded fresh pecorino romano cheese and served it with a hot loaf and it was delicious!

This was soooo good and so easy! I always thought it would be a big to do to make a soup but this was just great! It had great flavor and I didn't change anything about the recipes except I drained most about half of the liquid out of the beans and used regular white beans because that's all my store had. Great recipe, thank you!

I love this soup!  I always double the recipie.   I add a little chopped sausage or ground turkey and minced carrots & spinach to step 1.   I use a little less pasta and more veggies than the recipie calls for.  I've had to use different beans when out of cannellini beans, & it doesn't matter, this is such a delicious soup!  One of my favorite!

This was ok, would need some "perking" up (maybe add more garlic?) before it would appear on my menu again.  Would not make it this same way.

This soup has an excellent flavor, but based on a few prior reviews I expected a spicier flavor.  Instead, I could barely even discern the red pepper flake effect - it wasn't hot enough for me (and I don't have a particularly high tolerance for spicy food).  

I'm a neophyte in the cooking world so I might be asking a silly question, but what is the difference between pasta fagioli and minestrone?  If you like a good minestrone, you will like this.  I will make it again.

Being in the mood for pasta, but not wanting a bunch of gooey cheese, I made this for supper tonight. We both really liked it, even my meat lover hubby. I used my food processor to chop all the veggies which was a HUGE timesaver plus it gave it something other than a "stew" look. Kind of classy I thought. Other than that, I don't have much different than the other commitments. Very nutritious and delicious. Will make again.

First time making Pasta Fagioli...Superb. I was impressed with the ease and result of this wonderful soup. It surely is a keeper. I did double the recipe to freeze. and am thankful for the reviewers who mentioned added pasta last to the mix. Look forward to defrosting eating when the weather is cooler. Thanks for a great recipe.

I just made this and if not for the method, this would have got 5 stars from me hands down. The saute time takes 10 minutes not 5. Simmering took 40 for the celery to be tender enough. The only changes I made was using Vegetable broth because my daughter is Vegetarian, and I used small shell pasta. Everything else was exactly as written. This soup is amazing. So easy to make and so full of flavor. If you don't like your foods too spicy, cut down on the red pepper, It was perfect for us as is. We liked the spice. I am going to make double batches of this next time, so I can freeze some. If you do freeze, don't add the pasta. Add that after you thaw and reheat. 
Final rating: Method 4 stars, Flavor 5+ stars

I had been searching for a recipe that resembled the one I loved in Rome.  This is the one.  The only change I made was putting 1/2 the recommended amount of red pepper in the recipe, after reading that the 1/4 tsp. was rather spicy, and the result was perfect for my family.  Our 1, 3, and 7-year-olds finished their servings and asked for more.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was a wonderful recipe. I made this with dry Cannellini beans (not canned) and added a little fresh spinach to the soup at the end. It all amounted to a soup that will certainly grace our dinner table for many Fall and Winter seasons to come. Served with a homemade French Baguette made the meal savory and satisfying.  We also cook the pasta separately, adding some to the bowl and ladling the soup over it to keep the pasta from absorbing too much liquid and retaining its al dente texture.

Fiancé and I really enjoyed this tasty and filling soup. I made a few modifications, but nothing that inherently changed the original recipe. I added some carrot because I had some to use up. As a result, I increased the amount of chicken broth to just over 2 cups to make up for the added vegetable. Also, subbed fresh parsley for the dried because I have a bunch from my garden and used ditallini pasta as I didn't have spinach pasta. Very good and I'll make it again!

A hearty filling soup that's quick and easy to make. I was out of cannellini beans, so I substituted chick peas, which I actually like a lot more.   Many different pastas are appropriate;  I used elbows or mini farfalle that I had in the pantry.  Also substituted a 14.5 oz. can of petite diced tomatoes for the fresh tomatoes;  quicker, easier, and again, keep them in your pantry for use anytime.  This is a great winter time meal to make on a snow day for lunch or dinner.

So I made the recipe a with a few changes. I used crushed tomatoes and only used 1 cup of chicken broth. I also just used regular pasta noodles and half cooked them before adding them. But it was excellent! My fiancé and I loved it! I didn’t have any Italian seasoning either so I just threw in half a teaspoon basil, half a teaspoon oregano, a pinch of onion powder and a teaspoon of garlic powder

We loved this recipe!!  My husband asked for it again, so I obliged him.  I added a can of tomatoes, okra and corn for a little change. It's simmering, I'm waiting. Salad and cornbread!!!  Very good anything canned was low sodium as well as the stock.

My husband loves soups. He also especially loves Pasta Fagiloi. I found this a couple years ago and ever since then this is his absolute favorite and says it’s the best he’s ever had. We live in New Jersey, the land of Italian food. That’s a big statement here!

Good soup.  I doubled the pasta and omitted the beans because my kids don't Ike them.  I added the pasta a few minutes sooner than called for after reading several reviews.  The soup smelled wonderful while cooking and tasted good.

Easy recipe.  Leftovers taste great.  I added chopped ground beef and sweet Italian sausage I had in the frig which gave the meal added flavor without adding effort.

My nonna Giulia, rest her soul,made a similar Pasta eFagioli (pasta and bean soup), although her version called for a small bulb of fennel...no celery.  Slice and fry the fennel in butter  before adding it to the broth.  Delicious.

This is sooo good, only difference is I didn't add fresh tomatoes, and I only had rotel on hand (canned tomatoes and chiles), and then I added mozzarella and Parmesan afterwards. It's really good, the cheese gave it a more creamy color which I think is more aesthetically appealing.

My family loved this soup!  I doubled the broth and cut the red pepper flakes in half because my littles are wimpy when it comes to spice.  I also used ditalini noodles and a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes because I'm lazy like that.  Super yummy!!

Loved, loved, loved this recipe!  We made the recipe as written except for some added seasoned turkey as a protein.   Served with a salad and crusty baguette, it is a perfect dinner.

I used the recipe as a base. I added chicken broth as suggested and Italian sausage and omitted the celery as my family is not a big fan. I did add celery seasoning. My family really liked the dish and I will definitely make it again!

Huge hit tonight!  Made a few changes:  used 1 whole cup of pasta, 32 oz of chicken broth, can of diced tomatoes instead of chopping tomatoes, and did drain beans.  Amount of spice was perfect with the additional broth.  I will be making this again....it was husband & kid approved!

A delicious meal for two! I added 1 cup more chicken stock and doubled the pasta. I also used canned diced tomatoes...other than that, followed the recipe. We really liked the spicy tang, too. It wasn't too much...just right. We enjoyed it thoroughly and had plenty left over for another meal.

I'd say 4.5 stars because I didn't have all the ingredients, so had to adjust.  I didn't have tomato sauce, and I used my canned tomatoes rather than fresh.  I will definitely make it again, I took it to work for a carry-in and it was all gone by the end of the day.  Thanks for sharing.

I loved this soup!  It was very flavorful and quite healthy!  The only changes I made was to add 1/8 cup fresh basil, sub 1 14.5 oz can of petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes because I didn't have any, used a 14.5 oz can of tomato sauce instead of the 8 oz can and added 1/2 can of water since I like my soup not quite as thick.  My family loved it, just the right amount of spice, even for my 14 month old granddaughter!

I made a few minor adjustments such as vegetable stock instead of chicken as a personal preference. I also used fresh tomatoes instead of stewed and peeled and added some zucchini and green bell peppers. I also prefer to rinse the beans since the liquid tends to be thick and gooey. This is an excellent one pan meal!

It's really tasty. Next time I will leave out the red pepper flakes though :) too spicy. Also next time I will dilute with water or more chicken stock, since mine ended up being more of a pasta dish than a soup after the liquid mysteriously vanished.. But still I won't take away any stars because it was delicious!

I used ditalini macaroni instead of the spinach pasta so I added some chopped spinach to the soup.  Also, I just used canned chopped tomatoes which worked out very well.  We all thought it was very good.

I substituted with vegetable broth and it was a delicious vegan minestrone.  Next time I will definitely make a double batch and we'll enjoy leftovers the next day.  Do not double the hot pepper, though -- it's spicy enough.

The whole family loved it.  I didn't have celery and had to add straight oregano with additional italian seasoning for our taste.  It's great with a Roscato wine.

Made a delicious meal for us with some garlic bread and an Italian salad.  I wilted fresh spinach at the end and also added a little more water to make it more soup like.  Will make again.

Definitely better the second night...gives flavors a chance to be enhanced. I did not have fresh tomatoes and used canned ones,I'll never do that again:-( A bit of grated cheese and french bread is all that is needed for this to be a fabulous meal.

Excellent!  Very tasty and hearty soup.  I have always loved pasta figioli, but have never tried to make it.  I thought it came out restaurant-quality.  Though I must admit, I changed it a bit.  I used a 15 oz can of tomato sauce as that's all I had in the pantry.  I also doubled the noodles the recipe called for and used multi-colored spirila-style noodles fortified with vegies and excluded the celery - only because I forgot to pick it up at the store.  

Total cook time was about 60 minutes, and it turned out great.  Will definitely be making this again.  Even the kids liked it!!!!

Best pasta fagioli recipe I've found. I'm vegetarian, so I substituted the chicken broth for vegetable stock. I also had to make some substitutions with what I had in the house, so I also used a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and garbanzo beans instead of cannelli beans. Even with the substitutions, it came out amazing!

Easy and good, used ditilini.  Added maybe another can's worth of water as it got quite thick (could use 2 cans of broth next time)

This was delicious!  2nd time making it!  Followed directions almost exactly.  I made a double batch and wanted to add meat.   I made 2.5 lbs of sweet  Italian sausage mini meatballs.      Had friends over, and EVERYONE LOVED it!  Thanks for sharing!

i made it exactly as the recipe stated and i really enjoyed it. the only thing i didn't do was peel the tomatoes, just chopped 'em up with skin on and threw 'em in. i was a little worried at first about tasting all the veggies - i know i need them but i'm still a child at heart who doesn't always want to taste them... but they meshed together really well. i think i will take the advice of some other reviews in the future and add more chicken stock as my boyfriend and i both felt it wasn't "soupy" enough. also maybe try some different beans because these stood out too much for me. but will definitely make again.

This was delicious!  The only thing I changed was to add 1 more cup of chicken broth, 1/2 cup more pasta and in a pinch, I used crushed 15 oz can of crushed Italian tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes and tomato sauce. Loved it!

This was an excellent recipe. Great for a cold day and maybe on a hunting trip. I added more tomato sauce and put more broth in. Would've been to thick I believe without.

I usually have to make at least three separate dishes for my family due to allergies and two being vegan. I doubled the recipe and everyone could eat it because it was perfect for the whole crew!  After doubling it, it was GONE, so next time I will triple it to have some leftovers!! Yum!

I loved this recipe!  We eat gluten-free, so I used corn rotini for the pasta.  I only had 1 fresh tomato, so added a can of diced tomatoes slightly drained in a double recipe.  I also used 32 oz of gluten free chicken broth.  I'm so thankful to be able to make something like Olive Garden's Pasta e Fagioli that is gluten free!

I made so many changes since I didnt have all the ingredients handy but it was fabulous.  Broccoli for spinach, cooked steal cut oats for white beans, cooked pasta from a tomato dinner the previous night and I didnt have any celery.  Husband was sick and wanted a quick batch of soup but I couldnt get to store but he loved the franken-version of this recipe.

After reading all the rave reviews, I was really looking forward to this dish.  I made everything as specified except I omitted the celery and beans and did not peel the tomatoes.  This turned out very one-dimensional, with the only flavor discernable being the heat from the red pepper flakes.  I tried to fix it up but failed.  Sorry, but I will not be making this again.

Made this during the Superbowl.  It was easy enough that I didn't miss much of the game, and everyone loved it.  Once you've got the base done, all you have to do is add stuff and simmer--so easy!  Great flavor, too.  I used vegetable boullion instead of chicken broth.
