Yummy Yummy Yummy.  I make this one all the time.  I always leave the almonds out, though.  I made this one tonight for my boyfriend.  It is so quick, and so easy!  I've made it with fresh asparagus also.  It is SO good with fresh asparagus.  Just trim the asparagus(snap the ends where'd they'd naturally break) and leave them in boiling water for 2-4 minutes, depending on how you like your asparagus.  After you cook it a couple of times, you learn just how you like it.  I like using pencil thin asparagus.

I have to agree that while good, it wasn't amazing.  It just didn't have a lot of kick to it.

This recipe was fine, but not out of this world.  I like plain asparagas just as well.

Used fresh asparagus as well as butter and fresh mushrooms. I also used toasted sliced almonds from Trader Joes. Had to add a little bit here and there. It was average but scores high with easiness and quickness to prepare.
