It took an additional 15 minutes to brown. I would increase heat on the next try. Also, I doubled the chocolate.

These were an easy to throw together nice tasting cookie, but not something I'd buy Crunch (R) bars again to make.  However, if I had Crunch (R) bars needing using, I may make these.  If I'd make these again, I'd increase the PB (double).  THANKS for the recipe!
