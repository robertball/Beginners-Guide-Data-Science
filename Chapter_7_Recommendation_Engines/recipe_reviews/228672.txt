The cake itself is great, but I wish I would've skipped the topping. It stuck to the pan, despite the pan being adequately greased, and the cake looked pretty rough when it finally came out. Next time I'll leave the candied walnuts off the top.

Great recipe!  Instead of 1/2 vegetable shorting I added 1/2 of coconut oil. Delicious!

This cake is so moist. I followed all instructions, but substituted pecans for the walnuts.
