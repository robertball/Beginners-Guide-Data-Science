Wonderful recipe. I added 1 teaspoon of ground cloves, one teaspoon of vanilla extract, extra cinnamon, and extra raisins, and they were phenomonal. I was getting compliments for weeks afterwards.

I have made these several times now, and they are absolutely delicious! My husband can't have cinnamon, but the maple flavoring adds that extra "something" that more than makes up for it. Definitely a keeper, and now my favorite Oatmeal Raisin cookie recipe.

I was disappointed with these cookies.  They were not the thick, chewy cookies that I was looking for.  Although they taste good and are chewy, there is nothing particularly special about them and they go completely flat when they cool.

They were good, but they tasted like every other oatmeal raisin cookie.  I couldn't taste the maple flavoring at all.  Next time I will try doubling the maple flavoring to see if that makes a difference.

Easy, tasty and seemingly idiot proof.  I highly recommend this recipe, especially for those who don't bake or are unsure of their skills.  I left out the raisins, substituted vanilla for the maple, used margarine instead of butter, and they still turned out great.  The full recipe disappeared in less than 24 hours.

Everyone I made these for loved them. The maple flavoring really added something special to a traditional recipe. This is now my go-to recipe for Oatmeal Cookies.

These were awesome...flawless recipe. I make a few embellishments to have some fun with them: I left out the raisins and after they were cooled, i coated them in melted butterscotch chips and sprinkled with pecans. Extra yummy!

This recipe tastes exactly as it promises.  I added dried cranberries instead of raisins, but that is how I eat my oatmeal as well.

A delightful recipe!  I added a bit more maple flavoring second time around; even better!
