This is a five star recipe but - two things:  I always soak the oats in the milk to soften the oats before adding the additional ingredients which means you will need to add extra milk.  Also, because I didn’t want mushy apples, I removed them during the reduction process so I wouldn’t end up with applesauce.  Because of this, the texture and flavor was spot on, a great start to your day.

Something is wrong with this. It was so thick I couldn't stir it. Added another egg and double the milk to even get a pancake consistency. I have not cooked them yet.
