Deliciously different!  I didn't add the garlic cloves to the potatoes since the garlic was a little charred; I just added the garlic-infused oil which gave it a nice, subtle garlic flavor.
Will definitely make this again!

Not a fan of yams or sweet potatoes (not even regular potatoes) and I loved them! Really tasty and I believe the secret is in the roasted garlic! My family loved them. I didn’t add the water from the potatoes as the consistency was already very light (I even would’ve reduced the milk a little next time). But all depends on your taste! UPDATE 5/12: I made them again with little changes: used minced garlic and put it in the oven for 30 minutes with the oil. used 1/4 of heavy cream instead of milk. again no water. and I add sheddar cheese...Oh my goodness! delicious!!! better than the first time
Definitely a keeper!!!

I thought this recipe could be tweeked somewhat to incorporate the flavors better, but my husband really liked it.  I'm not a big rosemary fan, but loved the texture and garlic flavor of this recipe.  Also, it tasted more like potatoes than yams so if I made this again I'd reduce the amount of potato and increase the yam portion by about 1/4.

The BEST mashed potatoes ever! I've never baked them, per the final step - just mash them and put them on the table, where they are immediately eaten by my family.   These have become the standard for our family dinners.

I made with sweet potatos instead of yams and it was still very good.  Use fresh rosemary, it makes quite a difference.  I thought it had a very good overall taste, but if you like a strong garlic flavor use more.  My guests thought it needed a little more salt, but that may be because I used very little salt in cooking.

The reviews were 5 stars for this recipe so I gave it a try and I agree. I might make one small change and do the potatoes and yams 2/3 to 1/3 rather than 1/2 and 1/2 to mellow the flavor just a little but this was delicious. I also liked the taste of this recipe before baking as just mashed potatoes.

Update/Edit: Only 4 stars due to cooking method (would give 4-1/2 if I could). I steam the sweet potatoes on their own so they aren't watery. I mash the white potatoes with the milk/butter + a little sour cream - separately. I rough mash S/P's with 1 T finely minced FRESH rosemary (I don't recommend dried) and fresh Asiago cheese (didn't have parm) and add it all 'in' the potatoes. Salt & pepper both kinds of potatoes and don't use any 'potato' water - why use that?  THEN - I gently fold the two types together. I make ahead so these do get baked but covered. I think it looks rather unique since it's kinda two toned and everyone thinks they're delish. Have made several times but go a bit less on the S/P portion to white potato. I prefer white pepper in this vs black. I add fresh ground coriander, nutmeg & couple shakes of ground cayenne in the S potato mix. Nice idea & something easily modified for personal pref, thanks!

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner...It turned out well and was a nice change from regular mashed potatoes.  I sauted minced garlic with olive oil instead of using whole garlic cloves.  I only used about a 1/4 cup of the reserved liquid from boiling the potatoes.  It was plenty creamy without putting in any more of the liquid.

Yummy, yum, yum, yum! Excellent recipe! I can't believe anyone gave a bad review! My family loved it...even my picky 14 year old! One bit of advice for those people who made a short cut on the garlic...It is well worth the effort to roast the garlic. Delicious!

I found this recipe a few years ago and made it for Thanksgiving.  I wanted something different than the traditional mashed potatoes. I LOVED IT!  I made it the following year and on other occasions as well.  My guests enjoyed it as well.

The dried rosemary gave it a texture that I didn't care for.  Maybe it'll be better with fresh rosemary.

I altered the recipe by microwaving the potatoes in their skins (baked them), peeled them, and mashed them up in a bowl with the rest of the ingredients.  Also used jarred garlic. I reheated the dish after getting Hubby home from work tonight, he's "hooked" on it!  Many Thanks Ibby!

These are the best mashed potatoes.
It is easy to do, because you can do it in steps, not all at once.
I didn't change a thing, but have never had to use the reserve cooking liquid from the potatoes.
Thanks!

As a bunch of young college students having a Thanksgiving away from family, I made this dish just to say we had yams at Thanksgiving. Everyone started with a small spoonful to be nice and then before I knew it half of the dish was gone! It was a hit. I used minced garlic which took away half the time of roasting and I couldn't be more pleased with the way it turned out.

Turned out good and the family liked it too.  I recommend a bit more garlic and a little garlic salt mixed in before baking.. Although it takes some time to make these, the prep is pretty easy!  Made a good side dish at our Thanksgiving dinner tonight!!

Oh my these are good! I just made them up through the point where they go in the oven. Now I'll freeze them and heat them on Thursday. I had a bowlful first and will have to exercise self discipline not to eat more. As another reviewer said, they don't really have to be baked - but that step does make them easy to make ahead.  

The only change I made to the recipe was because I didn't have whole garlic but had the stuff in the jar. I took about 1/4 cup of that, drained it good and then browned it in olive oil and tossed that, olive oil and garlic, into the mashed potato mixture. I also added a little more rosemary than the recipe called for, probably more than a teaspoon.

This recipe is a keeper.

This is a nice change from regular garlic mashed potatoes. My grocery store had yams on sale this week, so I decided to give this recipe a try. I've never roasted garlic before, and boy does that smell good! You really have to like garlic to like this recipe. The consistency of these potatoes came out more whipped than just mashed. Very light and fluffy. I skipped the baking and just whipped them up in my mixer and served them with a little parm on top.

If you love garlic and rosemary, you'll love this recipe!  My husband and I liked it, but it was a little too strong in the garlic department for my young children!

my husband don't care too much for yams, so I tried this recipe and he loved it. The mixture with the roasted garlic made this recipe excellent!

Delish!!  Anyone out there that has a little ceramic  dish can roast the garlic in the microwave if pressed for time.  Drizzle a little olive oil & heat for 1 minute -- you'll be amazed at how little time it takes!

Wonderful! I served these with prime rib for Christmas dinner and they received rave reviews from my guests. Very creamy and sweet without the cloying sweet potato taste. I did not bake them but warmed them in the microwave just before serving. Brilliant!

This recipe is fantastic!  I smashed an entire head of garlic cloves, put them in a Pyrex custard bowl, and generously drizzled olive oil on top so that there wasn't a dry spot, but they weren't drowning, either.  Fresh rosemary is the key to this not being "spiky" when you eat it, or if you only have dry, you can roast it with the garlic (make sure to stir it around so that it's thoroughly coated) so that it infuses into the olive oil, and softens/plumps up a bit.  Grated parmesan works in the bottle works, but if you can find finely shredded, you get those cheesy stings that are oh-so-good!

Great recipe: we changed it a little to 2 lbs of potatoes and 1 lb of sweet potato just out of personal preference.  The roasted garlic and the hint of rosemary gave this dish a really sophisticated flavour without being too whacky for our Thanksgiving dinner.  Thanks so much!

I wouldn’t have thought of pairing the different types of potatoes… but I’m sure glad I tried it. This dish was excellent! My only adjustment was to use cream versus milk and fresh rosemary versus dried. Yum! Thanks, Ibby!

I love potatoes!!!!!  Any kind!  This was the  blandest, most indescribable potatoe dish we ever ate.  I followed the directions exactly. We love Yams, we love white potatoes, etc.  We've mixed them before and had great success.  All I can say is, glad I had gravy with the meal because I think there would have been a lot of leftovers.

I did this for Thanksgiving this weekend and it was a big hit - even though we were all sceptical.  The flavour was great and I'm not a big garlic fan.  I would add less garlic then taste and add to individual tastes.  Will definitely make this again with any chicken or meat dish.

I thought it was fabulous! I added one huge onion diced and boiled it together with the milk and water for the boxed white potatoe - YES!! - that I used. Put the jarred garlic in with that and then followed the recipe as given!
Is it a pretty dish and delectable as well!

I used 1/4 C milk, 2 T butter and about 3T Parmesan and did not bake it, but it was terrific! Pretty color and presentation.

Terrific -- for thanksgiving I left out the parmesan, but could see adding it back in for a prime rib side.  These were a great way to combine two holiday traditionals into one colorful dish...

I'm not a yam fan but Husband is, and he thought these were just ok. Quite a lot of work for not especially spectacular results. I'll probably make this again with regular potatoes and minus the yams. Oh well. Thanks anyway!

OMG. I just finished making these and I had to immediately come review them because they are SO good! I am trying this recipe solely b/c I found it on a blog for batch cooking freezer meals. I am so glad I did! I doubled the recipe and will have three side helpings out of it. I did make a few alterations. I did not use the cooking water. I used heavy cream instead of milk and only used about 3/4 cup (for my double batch). I used white pepper but that's just because I wanted it to be pretty w/out black specs. I can't wait for my DH to come home and try this!

I made this dish for a group of 64 college students, when we saw their plates there was nothing left of the potatoes!   I added extra rosemary, and used kosher salt and coarse ground pepper to step up the flavor.  I then added just a little brown sugar to enhance the yams. It tasted "savory sweet", and complemented the rest of the meal nicely.

I used jarred roasted garlic (2Tbsp) and fresh rosemary (1 1/2 tsp) and these turned out great! Tasty without being too spicy, you could still taste the potato and yam flavors.

I have made these both the way described in this recipe and they were great!  I decided to take these to a pot luck lunch at work, so instead of putting them in the oven, I put them in my crock pot, and they still turned out great.

A fun twist for potatoes. If I make it again I will add more garlic.

I don't know what these people are talking about, this recipe is awesome!!! I love the flavors of the potatoes together....and it's far from bland! Apparently these people put a pound of salt on everything they eat...wouldn't you agree??? I'm definately making these for Thanksgiving dinner.

These potatoes weren't too bad but nothing spectacular either. I don't know that I would make them again only because we like other flavors.

ummm, yummm! Baking it so that its crispy on the top but still creamy underneath- there was no left overs. What pigs. Sweet potatos are the way to go.

Did not need to use additional liquid.
Added about 3/4 cup parmesan.
The flavors mingled very well together.
Sensational!

I have Diabetes and especially liked the fact that this was something I could have without the guilt.  It was wonderful, and so easy to assemble.  I had only dried thyme in the house, it worked just fine. I also added a few carrots and red onions, a very easy recipe to adapt to most fresh veggies.  Will definitely make this again.

Everyone raved about this recipe.  I didn't have time to roast the garlic, so I sauted the minced garlic in olive oil before adding it to the mixture.  Superb!

A tasty way to have sweet potatoes that is NOT sweet!  I am not a big fan of adding brown sugar and marshmallows to yams or sweet potatoes, so finding this recipe was a nice treat!

I have made this recipe several times over the years.  I first saw it in Bon Apetite.  It is the best use of yams I have ever found.  I use a whole head of roasted garlic and fresh rosemary.  Superb!

Be generous with the salt and pepper. That really makes it for me. Also, I normally use about a tablespoon of fresh rosemary instead of dried. Otherwise, I haven't met a person who didn't absolutely love these yet!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  You can also use sweet potatoes instead of yams.  Instead of garlic gloves, I used minced garlic and simmered in olive oil over the stove until slightly golden brown.  I also used half & half in place of milk, and softened the dried rosemary by boiling with the potatoes.  I left out the salt, and omitted baking in the oven at the end.   It was absolutely delicious and will be making this for every Holiday meal and buffet.

Great recipe.  Made this tonight for the 6 of us and everyone really enjoyed it, ate it all up.  The rosemary/garlic combo was very complementary.  I used russet potatoes (baker potatoes) because they don't get gummy when they are mashed.  I drained the spuds and yams and they looked really moist so I did not add any of the milk but did add one raw egg when adding the butter, garlic and seasoning and beat everything in with beaters for 20 seconds.  Then baked it in the oven in a casserole dish.  The egg made it light in texture.  Great recipe.  Will be adding this one to the special occassion Thanksgiving, Easter etc rotation.  Thank you

I have made these two years in a row now and both times, the pan was scraped clean by the end of the meal. I went a little crazy with the rosemary the first year but this time, I used fresh rosemary and went a little lighter. It was perfect. I love that you can prepare it first and bake it before dinner! Great amount of garlic!

This is the first time I made mashed potatoes and yams.  I made it this past Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  Although the next time I make it I will add less milk because I like mashed potatoes to be thick.

Great dish.  I love it, because it’s different than your normal mashed potatoes.  I was skeptical to try it, because I hate sweet potatoes, but it turned out great.  It wasn’t sweet at all.  Next time, I will use more roasted garlic (personal preference).

Great dish.  I love it, because it’s different than your normal mashed potatoes.  I was skeptical to try it, because I hate sweet potatoes, but it turned out great.  It wasn’t sweet at all.  Next time, I will use more roasted garlic (personal preference).

If the usual sweet potatoe dishes are too sweet for your taste...this recipe is the way to go! Lovely rosemary (use fresh) and garlic goes well with turkey!

This was a weird blend of flavors.  It didnt get eaten.  The sweetness of the yams with garlic and parmesan just didnt work for us.

these were AMAZING. what i actually did was cut the tops of those small, red potatoes off, and hollowed them out. i baked them a bit, then piped the mashed potatoes and yams into the small potatoes. when people saw them, the orange yams, green rosemary, and red potatoes just left them speechless (not to mention the flavor)!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving a couple years ago.  Since then, my family has requested it at every get-together. The blend of the yams with the garlic and rosemary are wonderful!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is incredible! At first I wasn't too keen on having to bake the garlic, but it was totally worth it. It's super easy to make, and everyone will be raving about it for weeks. My husband said that I ruined his "mashed potato experiences" from here on out in restaurants, becaue theirs will never be as good as the ones I made!

INCREDIBLE! I can't do justice with words to how good these are. The addition of the beef bouillon is ingenius. Everyone raves over this dish. I've made it several times and I don't change a thing. 
Thanks!

One of the best potato dishes ever! I use this recipe many times throughout the year because it goes so well with roast pork, beef, or chicken, and I never change a thing about it. Thank you, this recipe is wonderful!!

My guests loved this! I thought it was pretty good, which says a lot since I don't like yams at all. A little on the sweet side for me--I may use more white potatoes next time. Tasted even better as leftovers--then the garlic really came through.

Out of all of the recipes that we tried this year for Thanksgiving, this was the only one that fell short.  It was OK, and that's it.  I would probably eliminate any water and use only milk, use slightly more fresh rosemary, and maybe more...I don't know, they just weren't that great.

EXCELLENT!!!  I did make a few changes.  Because I used about 2lbs of each type of potatoes I increased the amount of garlic (I used an entire bulb) plus added a bit more rosemary.  To make it creamier, I used an entire stick of butter.  Not the healthies of recipes, but it was yummy!

Great recipe. Very flexible. Unusual but not too weird. If I don't have time to roast the garlic, I use garlic powder and it still turns out nicely. I even got a rave review from my mother-in-law, who "hates" yams!

This is a really good dish!  I modified it a little, as I do all recipes to fit the dietary needs of my family.  I added diced onions and boiled them with the potatoes. It gave it a lot more taste, although this recipe is great as is.I also used fat free evaporated milk instead of regular milk, and used "I can't believe it's not butter" instead of real butter.  They were still so yummy! It is a bit more work than I anticipated but well worth it.

These were fantastic!  My boyfriend hates yams, so I made them with only russet potatoes, and they turned out wonderfully.  I'm not the biggest fan of mashed potatoes, but the rosemary and garlic flavor had me going back for seconds - this will be my only mashed potato recipe from now on.

I made this for my family on Thanksgiving, and even the boys who say they don't like sweet potatoes loved it! If you're not sure, use one more white potato and one less yam...but I'm tellin ya, if they like parmesan cheese they'll like this!

This is a great twist on potatoes and the flavor is wonderful.  The only thing is you need time to make two sets of mashed potatoes, so this was better for me to make on a weekend.

This recipe was wonderful.  All of those tastes blended well.  I found that I didn't need to use the reserved water.  The potatoes were very creamy and delicious!

This recipe is excellent! I was skeptical about the amount of garlic, but followed the directions and it was great. When I put it in the dish for the oven I thought I had way too much, but people were scrapping the dish at the end of the meal! Thanks!!

This is one of my favorite Thanksgiving dishes! I have been making it for at least a decade and it is a big hit every time. I do scale it up, making it with at least 3-4 lbs of potatoes and 3-4 lbs of yam and adjusting the rest of the ingredients accordingly. Otherwise, I suspect it would yield rather little for a holiday meal and I wouldn't have any leftovers, which would be a bummer. It does take a while to make, but it's so worth the effort!

I added too much potatoe water thinking I was making them moist, but it was flavorless.  I think more butter and milk would have been more flavorful..

I have made this twice now and adore it! It's a great crowd pleaser and wonderful for holiday gatherings. It doesn't need to be dressed with gravy or anything else--it's perfect on its own.

Surprisingly good. I used canned yams because it's what I had. Drained off the syrup and rinsed. All four guests had seconds.

First, get rid of the rosemary. It did NOT compliment the yams at all. It was actually pretty bad. Everything else was ok. I love yams but this just didn't do it for me. Pretty Blah.

perfect healthy and we can use our rosmary tree before it flowers. Don't go near the dried rosmary its tough and just not nice in this dish. printed and in the "Regular cook book"

Thanks

These were very good!  I added extra rosemary and used cheddar because I didn't have parmesan.

I think this recipe is different, I may not be a big fan of rosemary, it just was too different for us, looked great!

Although I didn't love this dish--a little too much garlic for me, my Thanksgiving guests loved it. Use fresh rosemary, it's much better.

Very yummy.  I was afraid the dried rosemary would be crunchy so I boiled it with the potatos which turned out great. After mashing I thought it needed a bit more of something so I added 2 tablespoons of brownsuger and ended up doubling the butter.  The extra butter gave just the right salt and richness.  Next time I'll try using cream instead of milk instead of the extra butter. They were a big hit at the Thanksgiving table!

I have changed few things. I microwaved the rosemary (added more than the recipe calls for), garlic and Olive oil for 3min. I then added only the olive oil to the potatoes. I baked it in muffin baking tin...thank you. Im waiting for my 4 yrs old to wake up and try it

I just made this recipe for dinner and it was fabulous! I don't like sweet potatoes much, but you couldn't really taste them in this recipe. My husband and I joined Team in Training and are training to ride in a Century ride in Nov. 2007 and they say potatoes are better fuel than pasta, so we are carbing up on potatoes! Thanks for a great recipe.

These mashed potatoes were great. I made them for Easter and the whole family loved them. The only thing I changed, is that I added Maggi instant chicken boullion to the reserved cooking liquid and therefore didn't add salt.

This is a great way to use up leftover yams.    To cut down on fat, I used no fat sour cream and 1% milk.  My husband, however added a thick layer of margarine with salt & pepper added to his.

tried this as a christmas side dish.  takes some extra effort that i'm not sure is worth it.  the potatoes kind of "dilute" that sweet yam flavor.  i'd suggest adding brown sugar to taste before baking.

This was delicious!  It made my whole apartment smell more homey and comfy.  I used fresh rosemary and grated cheddar cheese.  I also sprinkled the top of the potatoes with crushed flax seed before I baked it... a nice golden crust was the result.  Very good, I'm looking forward to making it again!

Very bland.  The rosemary, parmesan, salt and pepper really needed to be adjusted.  My husband and I both agreed that while fine, these potatoes were nothing special, and definitely NOT worth the amount of fat in them.

These did seem to be a a lot of work for a side dish but they were SO tasty.  I ate half of them this week and froze the other 5 portions.  I will make them again!

This is a fantastic way to serve potatoes.  The whole house smells delicious when these are in the oven.

This was a great side dish. Guests who claimed to not like sweet potatoes ate it and went back for more. No leftovers in site.

I would definitely recommend it.  It's easy and delicious.  We are used to more spicy food, so next time  I will add more roasted garlic and salt.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I served it with pork roast, everyone raved about it and had more second and third servings of this than anything else.  I stuck with the recipe except for adding a whole head of garlic.

Really good!  I took a loaf to my daughter's and we downed it in one sitting!  Feel free to add more garlic if you want! We loved it with fresh tomatoes.

My family didn't enjoy these potatoes at all.  The flavor of rosemary was overpowering, and I didn't like the texture.  I'm sure we used enough potatoes and yams because we had a whole pile of leftovers.

I really liked this recipe.  I had it for a dinner party side, and the guests were ho-hum about it and I was too busy to taste it that night, so left with the remains, I ate this for lunch for a week, and enjoyed every last bite entirely!  I accidently bought sweet potatoes instead of yams, but will try yams next time; it good none the less and a keeper for my husband and self!

So yummy that even though I made extra, the entire TWO casserole dishes went in one dinner sitting (amongst 7 people)!  Really unique and a nice change for Christmas dinner - I used orange sweet potatoes instead of yams - superb!

This recipe was FANTASTIC! It was by far the most popular dish at Christmas dinner and people were scraping the sides of the baking dish to get every last little bit. This is the best mashed potato dish I've EVER had. My new favorite recipe. Thanks.

This is a fantastic way to incorporate both potatoes into a dish. It helps save you some room in your oven for other things, rather then making seperate dishes of them both. 
My entire family loved this recipe, and asked for it on Christmas. 
Thank you for submitting such a wonderfully, tasty recipe.

A very easy recipe with excellent results. The yams and potatoes mix beautifully and the garlic and parmesan are not over powering. Wonderful.

We all loved this...even my kids! If you like the flavor of roasted garlic, you'll love these potatoes. My 12 year old daughter asked me to make this again before she was even finished her dinner! Very easy to make and smells SO GOOD when baking!

This was GREAT!  I made it last Thanksgiving and it was a tremendous hit.  My friend liked it so much last year, she is bringing it to a Thanksgiving dinner this year.  I am making it again too.  Thanks for the recipe :)
