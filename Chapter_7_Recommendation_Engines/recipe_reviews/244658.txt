We are totally nuts about butternut squash as a side or in soups. Just made it this afternoon, and 3 teenagers consumed all 8 portions!  The maple bacon on top made them swoon. Only change was using ½ tsp chipotle powder instead of ¼, and upped the broth to almost 4 cups because it was so thick. Absolutely incredible spices- sweet, hot, cinnamon- yum! Hands down best butternut squash soup we've ever made. Give it a try!

We truly enjoyed this soup and I made a lot of it, so I could freeze some for those cold winter days ahead!  I followed these directions with a few minor tweaks, due to allergies. I can't use onions or certain spices, so I had to substitute.  I added fresh basil, cinnamon, fresh thyme, fresh garlic, dried rosemary and pears that were just picked fresh off the tree.  After the squash finished roasting and it was all together and simmering on the stove, I added a 8 oz package of lo-fat cream cheese.  When the cream cheese had all melted and blended in, I let the soup cool a bit, before I put it through my food processor.  The soup was super creamy and ultra delicious!!  The bacon (I doubled this amount), on top was a pure delight, who doesn't love bacon after all!!!  I am so glad that I took a chance and made lots, because it will be such a tummy warmer on those cold wintry nights!  Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!!

We like our butternut squash soups thick and rich so I cut back on the chicken broth and added about 1/3 can of evaporated milk for a creamy texture.  I used turkey bacon so I didn’t have the bacon drippings; sautéed the onions in olive oil instead. The bacon gave it an interesting taste that grew on me as I simmered and tasted. I added about 2 Tbsp. of hickory smoked BBQ sauce; a great flavor addition which my husband loved. Before adding the BBQ sauce I thought the rosemary and thyme were a little strong, but after adding the BBQ sauce it was less noticeable. I did not have ground dried chipotle pepper so I just used a tsp. of some hot sauce. And I only had one green pear; used about ¾ of it in the soup and that worked fine.  Before serving, instead of sour cream, I topped with the cubes of the remaining pear and chopped pecans. If I had not portioned out in serving bowls I believe we would have consumed the entire pot in one sitting. There is such a variety of flavors. Excellent and satisfying on a cold winter day!

Topped with Pumpkin seeds.  Use yellow pears.  Use cinnamon and nutmeg but changed the chipotle to cumin and paprika.

Wow!  This is the most flavorful butternut squash soup recipe I've tried yet.  I don't like to cut up fresh squash, so I baked it first which can be done ahead of time.  Then, I was able to combine all ingredients when ready on the stovetop and use the immersion blender.  My husband is already asking me to make it again.

My family LOVES this soup! I usually roast the butternut squash when the oven is already hot and then put it in the fridge. Then when I’m ready to make soup it goes really fast. I never have pears at home, but I do have those squeeze packs of unsweetened apple sauce. I throw in two of those. I use a whole carton of chicken broth. If I don’t have chipotle I use 1-2 tsp of chili powder and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. It’s soooo good with grilled cheese sandwiches!!

I used dry rosemary instead of fresh, and chipotle chili powder instead of the chipotle pepper.  Very rich and filling, and tastes better the next day.

This thick, spicy, nutritious soup has become one of my favorites. It's a wonderful fall dish, but is very nutritious anytime, and is a wonderful company dish, too.

Delicous! I made this in the Instant Pot. I added some carrots and 1 sweet potato.  Since my bacon wasn't maple-flavored, I added a little maple syrup. Nice balance of sweetness and subtle spiciness.

We have made the soup many times and it is delicious! However last night my husband made it even better by smoking the butternut squash on the grill using pear wood for 45 minuets. The smokey tones enhanced the taste of the squash and took the soup to a new level.

I found this recipe searching "vegetarian squash soup" recipes on this site but made it anyway, without the bacon. (I'm a bacon-lover but had been asked to bring vegetarian soup to a potluck). I substituted olive oil for bacon fat, and considered adding some maple syrup, but the pears made it sweet enough already. I also used veggie bouillon cubes for the stock.  Guests loved it!

This was horrid. It was like a pear apple sauce. Even my hubby looked at me and said, "I'm glad you made bread." I must be  a butternut lover and this had too much pear and it was thick (I saw that comment a few times). I really did follow the recipe perfectly, even went out to buy yellow onions and chipolte chile powder.  Nope. Never again. Ordering pizza now.

ALSO>>>>> I used the magazine recipe Nov 2017. IT DOES NOT SAY TO ROAST BUTTERNUT LIKE THIS RECIPE DOES.

might have made a difference....

This is an elegant soup with just the right balance of sweet and hot. I would increase the chipotle a bit next time. Of course the bacon is the frosting on the cake!!

A little time consuming, but worth it. Husband found it a tad sweet and was glad there was bacon in it. When we make it next, we're not going to do the maple bacon. My 6 & 8 year olds really liked it a lot.

Make this, but added more cinnamon and nutmeg as I thought the rosemary and thyme overpowered it a bit. Topping with the bacon and sour cream helped.  It was okay, but a bit disappointing for my holiday meal. I don't know if I'd make this again.
