The taste of blueberries goes very well with chocolate. They turned out really well and my whole family liked them. Make sure the blueberries aren't cold. Mine were and they made the chocolate hard too soon. I just stuck the whole mixture in the microwave for about 30 seconds to re-melt it and it was fine. Sure the blueberries released some juice when they were warmed, but that didn't seem to do anything.

Creative idea. I had blueberries left over from a recipe so I gave it a try. I was thinking they might taste like the packaged gourmet chocolate blueberries, which are really good. They didn't. We ended up throwing these out. Not because it was bad, but if you wouldn't eat a handful of blueberries anyway, you might not like these either, even if they are covered in chocolate.

This is a summer-time favorite in our family, also.  Use good quality chips, and make sure that the blueberries are at room temperature and dry before coating them with chocolate.  If you are trying this recipe for the first time, you may find that the first one or two clusters may not seem like anything special.  But, they become addicting. My oldest son can consume a batch himself in a day.

To make it healthier I substituted 1 Tb of Unrefined Coconut Oil for the shortening, plus I used organic choc. chips. and added 3/4 cup finely ground walnuts.

Love the crunch of the chocolate with the soft fruitiness of the blueberries.  So easy to make.  I used baking squares (6 semi sweet and 2 unsweetened).  Also I know this may sound weird, but I sprinkled a bit of cayenne pepper on top of each just before putting them in the refrigerator.  It provides a spicy note at the end that is just delicious (if you like that kind of thing!)!

These were good. I drizzled the top with melted white chocolate chips mixed with some corn syrup. I liked the crunch of the refrigerated chocolate with the "pop" of each fresh blueberry!

This recipe good with blueberries but is excellent using large marshmallows.  My six year old daughter loved helping prepare this dessert, so between taste and ease of preparation, it is sure to be a keeper.

These were ok, I think that the shortening just makes the chocolate taste a little wax-like. Still an easy, fun recipe. I liked them on top of ice cream.

Very good and easy. I blueberries that we picked at a local orchard, that were nice and firm.  My 4 year old daughter helped. It is a great recipe for your child to help with.  I will make this again.

These were incredible!  I also used butterscoth, white chocolate and milk chocolate.  All were yummy!  It is important to make sure your blueberries are fresh.

I normally buy chocolate covered blueberries from Costco and they are not cheap. I substituted coconut oil for the shortening only because that's what I had. I am thrilled to have found this recipe. So quick and easy to make and so delicious!

This is a perfectly light after-dinner dessert. Chocolate and blueberries pair very well together and don't leave you feeling coma-induced. Extremely easy to make.

I just made a personal recipe for this. Same exact recipe minus the shortening. However, I added vegetable oil to the chocolate. They can be made frozen too using frozen blueberries. They are worth a try.

This was a big hit with my friends, handed out small bags as heart-healthy Christmas gifts.  Hated to use that much shortening so cut that ingredient back to just a tsp. and it worked beautifully.  Thank you!

Amazing recipie. I loved it. Fresh berries DOES mean fresh, I made it with frozen thawed berries, and it just isn't the same. Amazing recipe. I'm taking it to youth group tonight, and i'm positive that it'l be a hit. :)

These turned out really good.  I used butter flavored crisco instead of oil.  I think they taste better at room temperature.

It was so easy. I added a light dusting of cayenne pepper to some, sea salt to some, and cinnamon sugar to some. The rest were plain. All were greatly appreciated by the family. The berries burst so nicely. I agree that they need to be dry and room temperature before adding them.

So delish! My mom made these and used wild black huckleberries that are ripe and ready to pick in the winter in our area (pnw). Just the perfect amount of sweet and tart. Love, love, love these!
