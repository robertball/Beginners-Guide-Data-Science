One of my family's favorite dishes! My mother is Japanese, and her recipe is almost identical. She uses red wine vinegar in place of lemon juice. We also add about 1/2 cup water to dillute the saltiness of the soy sauce.  Another variation is using 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce with 1/4 cup soy sauce. Traditional yakatori is sliced thin and threaded onto skewers. The meat is easily sliced when partially frozen. I make this dish for lots of parties and potlucks. It's always the first to go.

This is one of the very BEST marinades we have had.  The only thing different I did was use sesame oil in place of the vegetable oil.  WOW!! I would give this more than 5 stars. Hubby said you can't get anything better than this at any restaurant.

Great marinade! Almost as good as my mom's! I didn't bother to cube or skewer, just 6 whole steaks.  I laid in a glass 9x13 dish and poured the marinade over all, flipping occassionlly.  You can always tell a good marinade by seeing how much steak sauce my family uses with the steak. Tonight, very little was used b/c the flavor was great!  Highly recommend this recipe.  Thanks Rayna!

I love to entertain, and this recipe is always a hit. These are always the first to disappear from the table.I use half sesame oil and half vegetable oil. The sesame oil adds a little more of the oriental flavor.I also do these with chicken breast strips that I have pounded flat with a meat mallet. Yummy! Thanks for sharing, Rayna.

Mmmmmmmmmmmm!  I just got through eating this with my family and it was a HUGE hit!  The only thing I changed was that I used fresh grated ginger in the marinade and I sliced the meat into thin strips and threaded it onto the skewers.  I can't wait to try this with chicken and pork!  THANK YOU!

This is a GREAT marinade!  Make sure you use light soy sauce, otherwise it is too salty.  Even with using light soy sauce I was worried because the marinade tasted really salty, but I worried for nothing.  I marinated my meat (london broil cut into cubes) for 3-1/2 hours and then put the meat onto skewers and broiled.  It was so delicious!  I will definitely be making this again!  Cheers to the cook!!

Addition to original post:  1/4/03  I just tried this marinade on chicken and it turned out really great!

so yummy- we made this for a short-notice BBQ with a couple of friends as an alternative to burgers and dogs- really easy and so much more impressive. made it again for a birthday party and was a big hit then too. we used half sesame and half regular oil, and substituted the white sugar with brown. we tried it on chicken and sirloin and it was great with both. this is a new favorite with our families and we'll definitley make it frequently in the future!

Wonderful, just wonderful!  I used chuck meat and it came out so tender and tasty.  With the leftover marinade, I boiled it for 5 minutes.  Then added more soy sauce (light), brown sugar, chili paste, pepper, water and red wine vinegar to my liking and boiled it another minute.  Then added some paste make with water and cornstarch to thicken.  Served it with grilled onion, red & green bell peppers and steamed rice - BETTER than a restaurant!!!!

Very good!  I used low sodium soy sauce and substituted red wine vinegar for the lemon juice.  I let this marinate all day.  We served it with grilled veggies and rice.

I prepared this with the challenge of grilling it outdoors, in the dark – and overcooked it, doggone it.  But I wouldn’t have liked it even had I cooked it to perfection.  To me, most things marinated in soy sauce taste like salt and so did this.  But my wife thought differently.  She found the blend of flavors in the marinade slightly sweet, slightly salty and very delicious.  Barely three stars from me, a solid five from her, averages to a not quite four-star recipe.

I didn't try this, but my family said that it was "good". I didn't hear any rave reviews, but they all seemed to like the dish well enough for me to make it again. Hubby pulled his back out and I didn't feel like lighting up the grill, so I used my grill pan on top of the stove. Next time we'll definitely bar-b-que the meat. I'll also use the marinade with chicken for myself and see if we can get this rating up to a five. Thanks Rayna!

Love this recipe!  I used organic low sodium Tamari instead of soy sauce and it was perfect.  Boiled the marinade down and used as a dipping sauce for veggies.  Yum!  Served with Cucumber Sunomono from this site, white rice, and grilled veggies.

Love the recipe but just wanted let you know that Yokitori in Japanese uses only chicken. Yaki means grill and tori means bird/chicken.

I make a marinade really similar to this, but I like to use sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, and also add a bit of garlic, a splash of sweet sherry and a good sprinkle of Chinese five-spice seasoning. I usually use it on thinly sliced flank steak, but it's excellent on the sirloin as well.

I lived in Japan for four years. Chicken on a stick is yakitori. The marinade has an interesting flavor.

The marinade is very good. My husband is Japanese and Yakitori always is chicken. The name means some kind of bird and in our time it means chicken. As far as I know when you order yakitori in a Japanese restaurant it's always chicken. So I'm giving this a 4 star since you can use the marinade to any meat and even fish.

This was delicious!  I made almost as the recipe stated.  My husband and I are not big lemon fans, so I reduced the amount of lemon juice.  I did not have green onions, but I added some thinly sliced onions to the marinade.  Also, we didn't feel like getting the grill set up for this little amount of meat, so I cooked it in a frying pan.  After the meat was cooked (we like our steak medium), I removed the steak & set aside on a plate.  Then, I added a little more oil, to the pan, and some already cooked brown rice.  Then, I added sweet soy sauce, a little more ginger, sesame seeds and frozen peas.  Once the peas were cooked (just a few minutes), I added the steak back to the pan.  We had a one pan hit!  My husband & I loved it!

This an excellent marinade.  I took the advice of another reader and used  1/2 cup red wine vinegar in place of the lemon juice since that is what I had on hand. I also diluted  it by adding a 1/2 cup of water to cut down the saltiness.  You won't be disappointed.

I marinated for about 5 hours and the flavor was excellent.  We BBQ'd chunks of sirloin on skewers and the meat was so tender, I've never had sirloin steak that tender! Will definitely make again.  The house smelled wonderful, just from making the marinade! Loved the green onions too!

When I was in Okinawa I bought yakitori from a vendor on the streetcorner.  This recipe brings back those memories.  I am going to sell it at the farmer's market this week, so will be marinating it for a couple days.  Thanks for posting!

Great flavor. I tenderized the steak with a Jacaard needling device prior to marinating. That allowed the meat to soak in more of the marinade.

Good Recipe, until I came to the nutritional Info. 1800 plus mg of salt. I did not use soy sauce but subed Braggs Amino Acid instead. Recipe came out great. When we learn to cook without loading up on salt for flavor then we will cook healthy and know what " Scratch " cooking is all about. There is alot of herbs out there that are better tasting and good for us. And we don't neet the Goverment to tell us what to eat!!

Easy to make and good!  I cooked in my grill basket, found that it gets cooked more evenly than on a skewer.

Just as I remember it, when I was a kid living in Guam. Hmmmm soo good, didn't do anything different from the recipe other then using boneless pork chops, pounded slightely, trimmed the little bit of fat off the edge, and sliced in half to fit on the screwers nicely. Wonderful Wonderful.

A little too salty.  It needs some broccoli or something.  I cooked it in a crockpot.

I did take the advise of others and used red wine vinegar in place of lemon juice, used 1/4 cup of soy sauce and 1/4 cup of teriyaki sauce, used sesame oil and half vegetable oil.

Yum, yum, yum!!!  Made this for husband and 6yo son, and all are fans!  This was so delicious.  I took what others said and cut down the soy sauce w/ water.  Also, I doubled the marinade and marinated mushrooms, red bell pepper, onions, and zucchini. Made kabobs out of this all, and it was a hit!  Will make again!

I marinated overnite and this was delicious!  I sliced it in thin pieces as you would find in an Oriental grocery.  I subbed sesame oil for regular; red wine vinegar for lemon and added water to dilute the low sodium soy.  This is now one of our rotators.  Made 3 lbs and froze 1/2 for later, and it's already marinated!

This is fantastic!  We liked it with beef and chicken.  I also used 1/4 cup each soy sauce and teriyaki sauce, as well as 1 tbsp each lemon juice and balsamic vinegar.  I marinated the meat then skewered right before grilling.  I boiled down the extra marinade to remove any bacteria from the meat then added it to onion and zucchini during the last few minutes of sauteeing.  Served it all over jasmine rice.  Again, fantastic!

This came out very good.  I used two nice pieces of top sirloin that I left whole.  I marinaded all day (10 hours) and was glad I hadn't cut the meat because the flavors had penetrated entirely thru the meat.  I did use reduced sodium soy and subbed a lil teriyaki sauce (maybe 2 TBSP).  I also used fresh ginger and a touch less sugar (brown, not white).  I think next time I would take the advice of JC Perez and add a splash of water.  The meat was very flavorful but any longer in the marinade and it would have been too overwhelming.  I served wtih grilled pineapple and AR's tangy avocado cucumber salad.  Next time I'll try this out with chicken!

Easy, and delicious. My wife and I loved it, and so did our 12-year-old son. Our younger daughters are still at the age when "not McD" is automatically bad - but even they ate more than any other new food they tried. 
I used wood skewers, and a small frame to keep the meat off the grill. I think that made some difference.
This is a keeper! Thank you!

I made this for the first time Wednesday night.  I only had 30 minutes to marinade, though this was amazing!  My husband the following day, jumped out of bed and raced to the fridge to claim the leftovers for his lunch. Can't wait to make this again...this time I'll marinade 4 hours to see how much more amazing this can be!  Two thumbs up!

I thought this was going to be fabulous, with all those great ingredients.  My family said "yum, teriyaki!" and got out the bottle of Kikkoman teriyaki sauce for 'more'.  

I guess "all those great ingredients" taste like Kikkoman.  It was good, but nothing too special.  By the second day, I did a taste test... it *did* taste like Kikkoman.  Bummer.

haven't tried this but I have a very similar recipe that I also put 1/2 tsp white pepper in.  Got the recipe in Okinawa when we lived there for 3 1/2 years.  Yakitori (in Okinawa) was always done with chicken.  This marinade is also wonderful on grilled steaks, chops etc.

This recipe is based on a basic Asian marinade, however, it would be better served if you add 1/2 cup of sweet rice wine. I often use this marinade for London Broil.

Soooo Good!  We did chicken (and since it never soaks up marinade that well) we marinated overnite in a ziploc...then skewered and grilled. Used sesame oil, extra garlic (always), lite soy, fresh ginger, a dash of teriyaki that was taking up fridge space and a bit of brown sugar too.  Simple great flavor.  Just perfect for summer grilling!  Thanks Rayna!!

Beautiful 5-star presentation!!  I threaded the cubes of sirloin onto the skewers alternating with 1 inch chunks of red and yellow peppers and Vidalia onions which looked spectacular and tasted great.  We all thought this was too salty though, so next time, I'll use part water in place of the soy sauce and maybe add a little extra sugar too.  This would be great to make ahead for company, when the salt level is corrected.

I must have done something wrong. Even though I cook Asian cuisines all the time, and I followed all the instructions closely, it  tasted nothing like yakitori. My suggestions would be to halve the amount of soy and use a better quality cut of beef...or just use a different recipe!

This was good, will try it again. I ran out of propane and had to finish them in the oven. I did a no no and made a stir fry sauce with the left over marinade (probably would not do that w/ pork or chicken) Rice noodles went really well with this (rice stick).

Great tasting. Used a round steak instead of sirloin and marinated it for 6 or 7 hours. Very tender and yummy. I used full strength soy sauce and would probably switch to low sodium next time. Served it with a ramen salad recipe that I got off of here and it went together nicely.

A real winner!  Shame on those who are so critical of the name of this dish.  If you are looking for authentic ethnic dishes, I sugguest you go to another site or buy a cookbook.  The meat was tender and not salty - I used low sodium soy sauce and used less than suggested. I served the meat with a little rice, pita bread and homemade tzatziki sauce.  It was delicous - family can't wait until I make it again.  Who cares what the name is!

Wow just Wow!  rave reviews from hub, daughter and niece..she wants me to cook at her wedding...this surpassed my pork chops in her view which has been her fav for years lol...I have to say I left out the sesame seeds..just because they get stuck in our teeth, okay so we are old, did sub the lemon juice and added the red wine vinegar as another reviewer suggested...I really don't know why...I was afraid because I ended up marinating them for 24 hrs...but all was good this is a keeper and I know and I apologize for reviewing something that I didn't follow exactly but I don't ever follow a recipe exactly....I modify them to my families taste so I apologize to Rayna but dang this was good so thank you Rayna!!!

This was excellent and my family really enjoyed it! I put the meat on the skewers after it was marinated. I also added fresh mushrooms, canned potatoes, and green peppers to the skewers.

I love allrecipes. Before I decide to make an allrecipes dish, I typically begin by reading the reviews. I was so fustrated reviewing peoples 'blogs' about Yakitori... Ok we get it baked chicken.... I made this recipe with beef and it was FANTASTIC! I added one additional clove of garlic and a few slices of fresh ginger. I meant to follow the marinade time, but stuff happens and we didn't make it until the next night. I will try this recipe again and again... chicken pork beef... who cares! This is a quick dinner that will surely become a common feature at our table. Even my picky child liked it! Thank you Rayna... It was great!

I used two types of steak when making these. 1 a thick chuck steak and the other a thinner round steak.  Got better reviews with the thicker steak.  Only variations I made were to use 1 T sesame oil and 1 T Canola oil, toasted the sesame seeds, and used 1 T fresh ginger. I like to make marinades way in advance, let the meat soak overnight in a freezer bag then the following morning toss in the freezer. Perfect for busy day dinners or last minute dinner guests. I skewered mine with fresh pineapple cubes, fresh green and yellow squash, and whole baby bella mushrooms and served over basmati rice. All in all we liked it but I think it lacked "something".  Next time I'll increase the lemon juice, I think it needs a little extra "punch".

Great flavor in this marinade!  I cut up two chicken breasts and marinated them for a little over 4 hours.  I came home and stir fried them while some rice and veggies steamed and I dumped the chicken and the rice and destroyed it all myself.  I'm just now recovering from eating all of that deliciousness.

Outstanding marinade.  I made some meat for dinner for my parents, meat for a small party, and meat the next day for a lunch between me and my best friend.  VERY efficient and delicious.  Omit the green onions and ginger?  Are you crazy?  They're what MAKE this dish!

Very good!  Thoroughly enjoyed it - I did about half and half sesame and vegetable oil.  (I think all sesame would be too much for us). I even accidentally forgot the green onions and it was still good!  Can't wait to do it again with the onions. I marinated overnight.

I made this recipe and my husband and I both loved it.  It is very easy, just marinade and grill.  I put all the marinade ingredients in a  bowl, mix well and add the cubed steak.Mix it down in the marinade real good.  Cover and refrigerate in bowl, instead of putting on skewers.  Put on skewers just before grilling for better marinade.  I did not add white sugar, I added brown sugar instead.  A much better flavor with soy sauce.  Definitely let soak for 4 hours or more.  I cut the meat into about 1 inch strips and pounded with a tenderizer so it would soak up the marinade better.  Try this, it is good.

We thought this excellent.  I found the meat hard to cut evenly and place on skewer but the flavor was very good and I will try with other cuts of meat.

The whole family loved the flavor of this and it was simple to make. However, next time I make it I will use low sodium soy sauce. The salt content was a little too much. But, we will definitely make this again.

This was wonderful and I don't usually give recipes a 5. I usually tap out at 4. I followed the marinade recipe to a T. I used thin cut top sirloin steak and let it marinade for 5 hours. I then skewered it and grilled on high heat for about 2 minutes on each side. It was lightly charred on the outside and so tender on the inside. My husband and I argued over who got to eat the leftovers for lunch. We decided to split it but I've got my eye on him!! Wonderful! Thank you so much for sharing.

Nice flavour, easy to prepare.  My two year old couldn't get enough, repeatedly said "more meat Mom"

Classic marinade, simple ingredients, wonderful flavor! We enjoyed this very much. I do recommend that you use low sodium soy sauce. Thanks for such a yummy recipe!

Awesome meat! I prepared the marinade with all sesame oil, red wine vinegar in lieu of lemon juice, real grated ginger (so I had to use more) and more garlic (we like it), more green onions--everything else the same. We also used sliced the meat instead of cubing it. Later we sauteed it in olive oil for cooking. Then immediately cooked the marinade----I could not let that hard work and wonderful aromas go. We had it with rice and boy that marinade was soooooo good on that rice and vegetables!!!! Thanks Rayna we will definitely be using it many times :-)

This is a very good marinade.  I made the recipe exactly as stated except I used flat iron steak so instead of cutting the meat in cubes, I thinly sliced it and then marinated it 24 hours.  My daughter absolutely loved it.  My marinade was not salty as other reviewers had mentioned but I had used a low sodium soy sauce.

This is super amazing!  I marinated my sirloin steak cubes for 18 hours before cooking them in an electric skillet.  It was fast and delicious with brown rice and steamed broccoli.  The only change I made was using the sesame oil in place of the vegetable oil.  I will definitely be making this again!

Yum yum!! We loved it! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers for fear of it being too salty. I used only 1 TBSP of sugar, 1/4 cup soy sauce + 1/4 water, & I substituted red wine vinegar for the lemon juice (I didn't have lemons). Everyone else thought it was perfect and had seconds. I personally thought it was a bit "salty" for my taste, but I also lack sodium in my diet, so my taste buds aren't used to it much, but the fact that a picky 8 year old wanted more (this little boy hates ice cream) was enough for me to give it 5 stars! I just might use low sodium soy sauce next time. Very flavorful & definitely a staple in the rotation now.

I love this recipe and have for years.Thank you Rayna! The only sub I make is to use low sodium soy sauce. Other than that I usually double the recipe to have leftovers for lunch the next day.   I'm not sure what yakatori at a Japenese restaurant tastes like, but by wife and kids love this and ask for it. I think that if my "BF" or whatever handed me back a plate of food that I had cooked after one bite we may have a problem. My BF would be eating a PBJ ASAP! I guess the people I cook for are a little more gracious and a lot less pretentious that some folks.

This was delicious.  We made it with chicken instead of beef and only had time to marinate it about an hour, but it was full of flavor.  Will definitely make again, quick and easy.

5 stars for easiness, and 4 stars for taste.  The only thing I changed was that I used large cubes of chicken and grilled for about 4 minutes,flipped and grilled for another 4 minutes.  Everyone loved these, especially the kids.

This recipe was a hit with my entire family.  I've made it twice in one week.  Once with the sirloin, once with Chicken.  I pared it with Restaurant Style Fried Rice from this site and got rave reviews!  I would change only one thing, cut back on the sugar.  It was a little sweet with 2 TBsp so I tried 1 TBsp and it was perfect.  Thanks!

Due to circumstances beyond my control (OK, I was craving mexican!!) the meat marinated 3 days... so flavorful!  We put cubes of meat + marinade in a plastic bag in the fridge, then, the day we grilled, we drained and skewered it.  That worked great for us.

Very Good! I used sirloin cut into strips instead of chunks (because I was short on time) and marinaded for five hours.  I broiled instead of grilled because I was out of charcoal and they turned out great. Just to let you know, I've been trying to duplicate the paper wrap chicken sauce at two local chinese restaurants and this is it!  Can't wait to try it on chicken.

Serve this with some sticky white rice and a japanese cucumber salad.  Yum.  Next time I'm going to cook the beef a little less so that it will be more juicy.

I substituted rice vinegar for the lemon juice and sesame seed oil for the oil but otherwise stayed true to the amounts and the ingredients in the recipe. I did add sliced onions and quartered mushrooms to the skewers as well. These were awesome with sticky rice and some sriracha on the side!

This has become a family favorite! I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and a little less sugar but overall the same recipe. I string the meat on the skewers with onion and peppers before grilling - oh so yummy!

This was a HUGE hit with my family. Great flavor. This will be my go to recipe for sirloin from now on. Perfection and I like the comments that show this is a versatile recipe, you can sub some things in and out as needed so it’s convenient.

The flavor is on point for this recipe. I made a few changes according to what I had on hand. I had some peppers, onions, and mushrooms that needed to be used up - so I add that. I used beef stew cubes and added a kiwi to the marinade for tenderizing. After sautéing the veggies and meat, I stuck it in the crock pot for about 2 hours. It was delightful. Thanks for another great meal!

We used this on chicken...and I baked it for almost 30 min in the oven @ 350 degrees.  It was absolutely delicious!  My whole family loved it.  I think this will replace teriyaki in our meal line up.  I can't wait to try it on beef . We used light soy sauce and the flavor was perfect. I would be afraid regular soy sauce would be way too salty.

This was very tasty, except I definitely should have used low sodium soy sauce.  I used both chicken & steak, and served it over brown rice, along with the mandarin vegetable medley (cold salad) recipe I found on this site.  Dinner was a big hit!  Next time I think I'll save the marinade and make Ruthie V's sauce ~ sounds yummy.

This marinade gives a really nice flavor. I've made some changes: white vinegar for lemon, agave syrup for sugar, sesame oil for half of oil. Will try with chicken.

I used the marinade with a pork tenderloin and added sesame oil instead of sesame seeds. It came out very flavorful. I really like the lemon flavor which balances the salt from the soy sauce.

The predominant flavour is salt and it left a blackened mess on my electric grill.  Maybe it's not meant to be marinated overnight?  I used Kikkoman all-purpose soy diluted with water.

This is a fabulous recipe!  We like it best with chicken, but it's also delicious made with beef.  Have yet to try it with pork.  I used fresh ginger because it was all I had on hand.  The only other time I had tried Yakatori was at one of our local Japanese restaurants (it was made with chicken) and I loved it.  I had no idea how to make it at home until I came across this recipe and I'm glad I did because it's just great and everyone in my family loves it.  Thanks Rayna!

I thought the flavour was great.  I have to admit I did marinate for 24 hours. My husband thought I was going to too much trouble to cube the beef and put it on skewers but I thought it was different from just steak like we normally have.  Prep was quick and easy.  I will make again.

I ended up marinating this for about 24 hours since I wasn't able to cook it when I wanted and it was awesome! My husband wanted it again the next night! Even all of my kids ate it and none of them are big on beef! I did use sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. I just love the flavor of the sesame oil better.

This recipe is amazing. We made this yakatori, along with other recipes, at a party we hosted and my husband couldn't barbecue it fast enough. It was tender and delicious. I marinated it overnight and did not alter any of the ingredients.

We have always used this with chicken and it is always fabulous! Use reduced sodium soy to reduce the salt.  Great recipe!

Pretty good on chicken. I haven't had it cooked on the grill...only broiled. I might just sautee the chicken/beef sometime instead of broiling. 
I don't do anything to the recipe at all and it's all pretty good!

This was very good, I had to broil the meat, I'm sure it's even better on the grill.  I used low salt soy sauce and marinaded overnight.  I boiled the remaining marinade and added sweet thai chili sauce, it was a fantastic dipping sauce.

I was not feeling well and wasn't up to eating but I had a small eye round roast in the frig that had been defrosted a few days before and had to be cooked before it went bad. I ended up cutting it into large cubes and marinated that and some onions for the day.  I put them on skewers and broiled them in the oven.  I had a little taste and was amazed at how moist and flavorful the meat was and my guy LOVED it.  I served it with The Most Delicious Green Beans which is also on this site.  It made for a nice, quick dinner.

My 3-year old loves anything on a stick.  I've been using the basic soy sauce and brown sugar marinade but this is by far much better.  I think the lemon juice adds a nice "twang" to it.  Only thing I did different was used brown sugar instead of white and used flank strips instead of sirloin cubes.  This will be my new basic recipe from now on!

The best marinade I ever had with chicken!! I used fresh grated ginger, half sesame half vegie oil like other have suggested.  Placed fillet chicken breast without skewer (1/2 inch thick) in the broiler (6-7 inches from the heat) for about 5 minutes on each side and serve with rice.  YUMMY! thank you!

Really good!  As suggested, I used half sesame/half vegetable oil, which gave it a really nice Asian flavor.  This goes on our "regular dinner menu" list!

This was delicious. I used cubed pork tenderloin and let it marinate for more than 24 hours.  Definitely will be a favorite in our family from now on.

OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!  This is an excellent marinade!!!!!!  I cut up a flank steak and marinated it all day, the meat was tender, and oooooooh so sweet!!!  I didn't have any sesame seeds and I was short on funds so I went to the fresh bagel bin and bought one, came home and rubbed a few off, and there you go!!  Thanks so much for this great recipe!!!  I can't wait to try it on chicken!!!!

This was O.K. but IF I tried this again I would alter the ginger amount or eliminate it altogether. We thought it tasted too strong in this presentation. Sorry, we really didn't care too much for this.

Maybe it was pilot error, but I didn't like this recipe. However, it did make the meat very tender. My husband thought this recipe would make a good marinade for jerky. I will try it for that.

I made this ahead, slipped the meat on skewers with the marinade into plastic ziplock bags and took it camping. We grilled it over the fire and it was a huge hit!  I served it with boil in the bag rice and grilled mushrooms.  Definatly easy and a fabulous meal.
