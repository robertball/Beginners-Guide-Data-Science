This was a  great recipe.  I made three changes, but it turned out great. 1. I added a can of Kidney Beans 2. I added a can of Tomato Sauce  (this is MUST for this recipe) 3. I used more cheese about 2 cups (we like cheese) a mix of Mozt. & Cheddar  Also, for the Chili Seasoning, I used a Tablespoon of the Chili Seasoning Mix II from here, it was great!.  I also whole wheat macaroni noodles. I find that they give the noodle more flavor and texture.

This recipe really deserves 5 stars, but I altered it some!  No celery, but did saute the onion w/meat.  Used Mexican style stewed tomatoes, added a few shakes of chili powder, s&p, garlic & onion powder.  I let it simmer and tasted.  Needed something, so used 1 beef bouillon cube to 1/2 cup water and let it simmer a little bit longer.  PERFECT!!!  Also I used the spiral noodles (Rotini) in the bottom of the casserole (cooked very aldente), then the chili mix and put plenty of cheese over the top.  I baked 10 minutes covered and another 10 uncovered.  My family devoured it, thank you so much for such a great recipe!

There are too many better recipies on this website to bother with this one -- it's all right, but mostly too heavy and not tasty enough.

This was good, it certainly fed my husband and I for days afterwards, which was nice.  I made the recipe as written but really felt like it was missing something.  Other reviewers mentioned adding tomato sauce, which I think would be a good idea.  I added salsa to each plate of leftovers I had and loved it that way.  I'll mix it in with the original dish next time.

This was really good. We put more cheese on top when we cooked it. Got to have a lot of cheese.

This was pretty good, but I made a couple of changes.  I used a mixture of cumin/corriander/chili powder in a 1:1:1 ratio (about 1/2 TBLSPN. of each for me!) instead of the seasoning mentioned here.  Also, I found that adding more hot sauce made it even more yummy!  It's great that you can freeze this and eat it later!  Thanks for posting it.

I give this 3 stars as written, because it was pretty boring until I made a few adjustments. First of all, I added some garlic powder, cumin, hot sauce, a splash of lime juice, and s&p. I used more cheese, and topped it with some roughly crushed Ranch-flavored chips. This was an unbelievably easy and very tasty meal. I would definitely make this again. Thanks, Sarah!

I'd leave out the celery(it added nothing) and add even more cheese. It was really good and both my kids and hubby liked it! I used fresh garden tomaotes, which I feel added to the flavor.  Even better days later as a leftover.

Solid dish.  But I don't agree with the "ready in 30 mins" label, because that assumes that you've already cooked the pasta and browned the meat.  Doesn't that time count?!

Tastes really good for how easy and quick it is to make.  I made it for friends, and everyone definitly wanted seconds.  probably will add some vegetables next time to bulk it up.

This was pretty yummy! I added a tbsp of sour cream and a can of cheddar soup to make it a little more creamy plus some additional spices for how we like things. Makes a lot and really is good!

This was a great recipe, although I did alter it quite a bit. First, I used elbow macaroni noddles instead of egg noodles (I halved one of those typical boxes that they sell in stores--so about 8 oz). Also, I left out the onion, celery, tomatoes, and corn (we're a picky, unhealthy family :D). I used two 15 oz cans of chili and an entire 8 oz jar of taco sauce, and maybe about a half a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Turned out great; my husband and I loved it and will definitely be making this often.

I made this last night with a few changes.  Personally, I don't like canned chili so, I used a package of mild McCormick chili mix added to the ground beef after it was drained.  I also added a 6oz can of tomato sauce to the tomatoes.  Instead of the egg noodles, I used a package of Uncle Ben's Ready rice.  This is a great week night meal.  It has a lot of flavor and clean up is easy.  You only have one big skillet and a 13X9 pan to wash.  Be sure to spray the oven pan with non stick spray before you put the casserole in so clean up is easy.

Needs more chili seasoning. I'd put 1/2 to the whole packet in. (But I like spice and flavor.) Also 1 tablespoon of hot sauce is not enough, it needs 2 like the directions say. Very yummy and healthy!

Just food.  Okay, but nothing great.  Will not make again.  If I am going to the trouble to cook want a little more in a recipe.  The prep time was way off.  It takes at LEAST 20 minutes to cook the pasta and brown the meat.  Should read ready in apporx 50 minutes not 30.  This is not a 30 minute meal.

I made this for my family tonight.. They LOVED it, my husband could not get enough. I didnt add the hot sauce for my girls sake. But my husband and I did add it to our own plates. I am a cheese lover so I added more cheese. And it seemed like it would be a little dry so I added a can of tomato sauce too... Great dish, will make again, Thanks!

Very Good.  My whole family enjoyed this even my 2 and 4 year old.  I added cayenne pepper to the adults bowls after dishing out the kids.  I also used Sharp cheddar cheese instead of mozzerella.  Delicious.  We will make this all winter long. Mmmm!

Great recipe to have on cold days! I did change the recipe some because my family always has to have extra cheese in everything and it came out perfect.

I have a friend who is a vegetarian, but she slips up EVERY time I make this recipe!

After making it time and time again, I've made a few adjustments. I use ground turkey now for a healthier meal, and you really can't tell the difference. I also prefer things spicy, so I generally double up on the chili seasoning and hot sauce. I use the Italian cheese mix instead of straight Mozzarella, and I sprinkle a few handfuls on top of the chili before baking. I'd recommend serving it with fat-free sour cream for a nice mix.

Enjoy!

I have a friend who is a vegetarian, but she slips up EVERY time I make this recipe!

This recipe was easy and very yummy!!

I would put extra cheese in mixed in the casserole.  I served it with a dollup (sp?) of sour cream on each serving and with corn bread.

I have recommended this recipe to several of my friends.

thanks Sarah,
Nicole

Pretty good!  Per other reviewers, changed this up a bit.  Added some taco seasoning, used 1/2 cup taco sauce instead of 1/4 cup, used frozen corn and added some chopped red pepper.  Used the 'no yolk' egg noodles.  Fast and easy to put together, especially with pre-cooked ground hamburger.  Family friendly.

i followed the recipe, but made a few changes. I didn't use celery, and i used taco seasoning instead of sauce. And added a little chili powder. It came out pretty yummy, my hubby loved it :)

This was just okay for my family. I added a can of tomato sauce as suggested and it was pretty moist. But the flavor was a little off. It wasn't bad, just okay. Won't become a staple in our house, but I might make it again if I feel like tinkering with it.

It's a good recipe. In the future we may alter it. The household was not a fan of the celery. We also my use a stringier cheese next time.

much better than anticipated...I've had to make some changes due to food allergies. I removed the onions, celery and corn. I added chilli powder, salt and pepper to taste.

I thought this was pretty good. I added cheese into the dish instead of on top. I also added two cans of chili beans with the sauce instead of chili. Very good with extra taco sauce!

I made my own chili (spices) with the meat, added chili powder, cumin, crushed garlic, and cayenne pepper, sauteed onion.  Left out the celery.  I also used crushed tomatoes instead of diced.  I couldn't even taste the taco sauce...my opinion leave it out. Added a lot more cheese about 2 cups.  Using the taco packet and taco sauce could be a whole different dish, which would not be chili casserole but taco casserole. Overall a good dish for something different.

This was quick and pretty good, but not great. I used medium shell pasta since that's what I had on hand, a whole pound of beef, and shredded cojack instead of the mozzarella. I didn't think the combo of mozzarella and chili sounded all that appetizing. Very simple and hearty, thanks.

I used taco seasoning rather then taco sauce as suggested by other reviewers.  I also used penne pasta since I didn't have egg noodles on hand.  My husband said there wasn't enough cheese.  The flavor was kind of bland.  Couldn't give this recipe a rave review.  It was just alright.

I thought this was really good but I did make some modifications based on things I had on hand.  I used leftover taco meat in place of the ground beef and a small can of tomato sauce instead of hot sauce.  I used a mix of cheddar and mozz. cheese and put additional cheese on the top.  I will make this again.

This was a very good recipe.  My whole family enjoyed it and we had no leftovers, which is unusual for us!  I did change it just a bit, by omitting the hot sauce and substituting a can of chili tomato sauce (tomato sauce for chili fixings).  This was still hot enough for us and I also added extra cheese.

My family thought that the celery taste was weird the first time we made this, so the second time, we sauted zucchini and onion and left everything else the same.  It was very good.  Thank you!  Noodles of your choice are fine, i'm sure.  Relish!   Thanks so much

It was very good, and very easy. Hubby loved it, didn't have any to freeze because he ate it all in 3 days. I did change a little, but only because of what I had on hand. Left out celery. Used left over taco meat, left over homemade chili, frozen corn, gluten free penne pasta, and more cheese than recipe called for. Chili already had onions, garlic, and diced tomatoes; and the taco meat was appropriately seasoned... didn't need taco sauce. Served with sour cream, homemade salsa, salad, and cornbread. Making it again tomorrow. :)

This is a staple in our house!  The kids love it and it makes great left overs. The only thing I change is that I use chili without meat.  Otherwise, great, simple recipe.

Easy and quick meal. I would not recommend the onions or sautée them before adding. The onions were a little too strong.

Another winner. Kids liked it, husband liked it and husband said he'd take left overs for lunch which is always a good sign! As recommended from other reviewers I added a can of tomato sauce and used 2 cups of a mexican cheese blend insead of mozzarella (1 cup mixed in casserole, 1 cup on top) otherwise I followed the directions as is. The only thing I'd do different next time is sauté the onions for a few minutes to soften them up more as they weren't quite done to our liking. There was a lot left over so if you need a quick lunch the next day you'll be covered! For my side dishes I made corn bread and a basic spinach salad, only topped with hemp seed and poppy seed dressing.  Yummy!

I'd like to add pepper jack cheese to it next time to spice it up a bit. It tastes even better the next day.

I had a few decisions to make on the ingredients here, since the recipe wasn't entirely clear. For the chili: with beans or without? I chose "with". For the taco sauce: mild, medium or hot? I chose "medium".  For the cheddar cheese: sharp or mild? I chose "mild". Should the can of corn be drained or not? I mostly drained it without thinking before I stopped myself - no big deal, I'm sure. For the egg noodles: wide or extra wide? I got the wide ones. Also, my can of tomatoes said only "diced" - presumably they were peeled too. I couldn't find a couple of the ingredient sizes in my store - 15.25 oz. can of corn instead of 15, and I used half of a 16 oz. package of egg noodles, since I've never seen an 8 oz. one.
Anyhow, I'm compulsive about following recipes to the letter. It didn't say how long to simmer the meat/veggie mixture, so I just simmered it for "a while".
It was pretty easy to make, but when all was said and done, I thought the dish was just okay. It was fairly saucy after only 20 minutes of baking - I would've liked it to be less so. And I would've liked a lot more cheese. It lasted me for four meals.

Very easy and very tasty!  I used less onion and celery because I have a picky eater in my family.  But even the picky eater had seconds!

Thanks for a great recipe, Sara.  We really enjoyed it.  The only change I made was that I used a can of chili without beans.

After I got this all mixed and ready to pour into baking dish, I just couldn't figure out where the moisture would come from.  So I added 16 oz. of tomato sauce.  Was happy with this recipe.

I use rice instead of pasta and it's easy and tastey and a bit healthier.  My husband loves it with guacamole on top.

This was very good, and the celery gave it a little "crunch"!  I put out a dish of low fat sour cream for those who would like to add that to their serving. Almost everyone did!!
