1:
when making these cookies please use exact measurements ..   

2:
USE   Bakers Semi sweet Chocolate  Baking squares or A Similar Product of semi sweet chocolate squares. 

3:
PLEASE DO NOT USE CHOCOLATE CHIPS.. IT DOESN'T WORK TOO WELL.  it makes the batter too runny I have always used squares to make these. I dont use  Chocolate chips to make these. And they have never failed me ever when I used squares.

4:
make sure you are using   butter and exact measurements.

5:
THIS BATTER DOES NEED TO STAND FOR AT LEAST 5 MIN MIN ..10 MINUTES MAX.

6:
Use Regular size eggs Do Not use  Large or Ex Large eggs because that would thin the batter more .

I REALLY HOPE THESE TIPS HELP.

These are the best cookies I've ever made.  It has a crisp outside with a chewy middle.  My sister had a problem (and to a lesser extent, I did the first time) with the cookies becoming too thin, but it was a matter of actually allowing the batter to sit for at least five minutes before spooning it onto the cookie sheet.  The batter needs to congeal or something.  As for the person who had problem estimating with the chocolate chips...each baking square is one ounce, so if you have a 12 oz package of chocolate chips just use the whole bag.

Great cookies! You HAVE to follow the recipe and let this batter sit for the chocolate seize up a little before you bake them. I had to let mine sit longer than stated, probably 15 minutes. They are sensitive in the oven (mine were perfect in 12 minutes) and there is not a lot of wiggle room between not done and too done. My family really loved these, so I will probably make them again, but they do take some mollycoddling, so only make them if you can commit to the recipe and to watching them closely. Thanks!!

There are great for chocolate lovers!  The batter alone is incredibly rich.  I followed the recipe exactly and used unsalted butter.  Let it rest for 10 minutes and it hardens up quite a bit... make sure to flatten them before you put them in the oven.  The second time I made them I ran out of sugar so I used closer to 2/3 cup, and I substituted chocolate chunks for the walnuts.  They came out puffier and not as crackly, but they did flatten out a bit after they cooled.  I baked them for 14 minutes this time but I think 12 is enough.  My coworkers thought these were fantastic!  Great recipe :)

I thought these were just OK.  I replaced the nuts with white chocolate chips.  Recipe's OK, but I probably won't make them again. Thanks for sharing the recipe, though.

I have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time. I didn't have 12 squares of baker choc, only had 8, so I cut the rcipe in half best I could, except I didn't have walnuts, so I put a sprinkling more of flour in the dough. I had to try this recipe, even with all the mixed reviews my dough turned out perfect, i think alot of the trick is to really fold in the flour mixture, and let it set. Also be sure to use baker semi sweet squares, and butter, not margerine. Since I halved the recipe, I used 1 large egg. The origianal recipe calls for 3 normal size eggs. I left the dough set at room temp 5 mins then stuck it in freezer for 5 more. I spooned the dough onto the greases/floured cookie sheet in 1" balls trying not to touch the dough too much, baked for 7 minutes....the cookies come out looking like the dough balls I put in..So, those of you who got flat cookies must have done something wrong. My nexy batch I pressed the dough balls down a little...and they turned out perfect. these are perfect little fudgey brownie bites for your chocolate cravings!

These are really good! I was worried because of some of the bad reviews so I halved it and it came out great!  I don't know why there were so many problems with them - my 3 year old niece helped me and they still came out great! I had to make another whole batch because my family ate them all!

Sinfully delicious. I can't even believe how good these are. They need to be made *EXACTLY* as the recipe states, including using regular sized eggs and listed mixxing speeds. I had only large and extra large, so I used 3 large, but with one of them I halved the white to prevent runniness. I skipped the walnuts, but no harm. And they absolutely must sit for about 10 minutes before baking. Using baking squares and doing everything else the same (unsalted butter, we are baking), even the mixer speeds, they're absolutely amazing, hands-down the best chocolate cookie I've ever had. They're so rich, I put a little caramel ice cream topping on my last bite and it was *perfect.* I am going to keep this recipe forever.

I am surprised by any good reviews.  This batter was way too runny.  It definitely needed more flour.  My cookies did not come out like the ones in the picture but absolutely flat and very difficult to removed from a greased baking sheet so they crumbled.  Oh the flavor was good but they were not presentable.  I think I will keep looking for that perfect chocolate cookie recipe.

This was awesome- in the words of my husband. He rarely wants me to bake for him but he was hungry and found this recipe and loved it. YOU MUST FOLLOW DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY!!!! Make sure chocolate is cooled before adding, other wise it will be runny

This is the lowest rating I've given any recipe on Allrecipes.  Followed the recipe exactly, and the batter turned out runny.  I should have checked the other reviewers suggestions before attempting. I agree with one reviewer who stated he could fix this recipe, but it'd be just as easy to just choose another.  Even though the batter was runny, I still attempted to bake.  They came out as flat crisps that in no way resembled brownies or cookies.

Definitely needed more flour, but that made them less chocolatey & tasty.  I melted semi-sweet chocolate chips and dipped them in it (let it harden) and they were saved!  They were great after the added topping.

Fantastic!  Wonderfully rich.  Easy to make.  Will make this in place of brownies whenever I want more of a "single serving" type of brownie.

After I read the other reviews, I should have known better than to make these cookies.  I had to add a lot of extra flour to make them keep the shape of cookies.  They taste ok (not great) but they look unappealing because they're so flat.  I might try to save them by sandwiching some frosting between two cookies.

This is the BEST recipe ever! I made it today and i was amazed by how the batter turned out fluffy texture this was I looking for I’ve been craving these cookies for over a month and I couldn’t find any recipe close to what I was looking for then I came across this recipe the ingredients sound it perfect for me. I used 16 chocolate squares and added 2 tbts unsweetened cocoa powder and used chocolate chips instead of walnuts then baked them for 10 mins only! They turned out great! My 6 years old LOVED them my husband was amazed by the taste and texture of the cookies and told they taste like they were made in the Bakary. THANKS for this incredible recipe I will defiantly make these again!

these cookies came out very thin and spread out way too much in the oven. I think this recipe would've tasted better if the batter was much thicker like most cookie recipes. Even letting the batter sit for about 5 minutes like the recipie says is not long enough. It sounds like a great recipe but it didnt work well for me.

I just made these & sorry to say it did not come out right at all. I used all ingredients as stated, but batter was way too thin. I knew it my mind that I needed to add more flour, but thought I would stick to the recipe. It came out as one huge “cookie” covering my entire large cookie sheet. Won’t make again.

I used semi-sweet chocolate chips from Trade Joes and the recipe worked perfectly! After I stirred in the nuts, I let the batter stand for 5 more minutes like a previous review recommended and that was a great tip. That extra 5 allowed everything to congeal a little more. Lastly, my 1 mistake was I used cooking spray to grease the pan and I over dusted it with flour so I ended up flour-y cookie bottoms. So I would recommend butter to grease the pan and a very light dusting of flour. The cookies are SO TASTY!!!

I have been looking for a brownie cookie recipe, and wanted to try this. I didn't have any semi-sweet baking chocolate, so i went ahead and tried chocolate chips despite what the recipe said. I followed the recipe exactly, just subbing chips for the baking chocolate, I did omit the nuts, I don't like them.  Here is what happened: batter was a touch thin, I waited for it to seize up, seemed thin still. I added just a quarter cup more flour and waited again. Baked a batch, and they looked pretty good, like the picture. The longer my dough sat, the firmer it got, and each pan of cookies came out a little thicker. When I only had a little dough left, I threw in some peanut butter chips, and they came out looking nice and thick. So, my suggestion is, that if you want to make these with choc chips, add a quarter cup more flour to the original recipe, and let the dough sit, even chill it for just a few minutes. It does work, and has a good chocolate flavor. I am an avid baker, and always tinker with recipes, to get them to work. This one was a quick fix, if all you have is chocolate chips in the house!

Rarely do give a negative review, but No matter what I did the batter when in the oven spreaded so much and became so liquidy that it was impossible to pick up with the spatula.  One reason may be due to me because I did not have baking squares so I used chocolate chips and did my best to estimate the equivilant of 12 squares of chocolate so I used about two cups of chips and maybe that was too much or maybe this recipe just does not work as well as it should, I don't know.  I ended up having to add at least1 1/2 more cups of flour just to make the batter more like dough and less like hot fudge syrup.  I had to continue to bake one drop at a time till I found the correct batter so I did not end up wasting all the batter.  It was at about 1 1/2 to two cups of flour that it finally turned out ok, ok, not great.  The only positive thing about this was that it tasted pretty good.  They had descent chocolate flavor.  I'd just find a better recipe than trying to figure out this one.

I used white chocolate chips instead of walnuts.
