I used the thinnest pan I could. Must not have been a jelly roll pan. I had to bake it a little longer to make sure it was done. The directions for the frosting did not work out at all! I had to add more milk than the recipe called for to even make a frosting! I used my past knowledge of cake baking to help me. The taste for this cake is not bad.

These were really good. They taste like peanut butter cookies in cake form. Like another person said they're more of a cake than chewy but they were good.
