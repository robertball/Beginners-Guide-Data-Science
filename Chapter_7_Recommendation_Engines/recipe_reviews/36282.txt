Very easy to prepare and good results.  The hardest part was grating the orange peel.  I also added a bit of orange marmalade. The end result was good, but I didn't really taste any of the orange flavor.

This was good, but not as citrusy as the recipe claims, in my opinion.  I even added extra dried orange peel due to the feedback in other reviews.  Maybe I'll try it again with more peel/orange juice.

EXCELLENT!!! Very, very good! Juicy chicken with a nice kick.. Couldn't taste the orange very much, but still very very good! I garnished with chopped onion and cilantro on a tortilla. This one's a keeper!

As many reviews commented, you can't really taste the orange in this recipe even though I doubled what the recipe called for. It did taste "citrusy", so I can't complain too much :) I served this to my father, grandmother and husband and they all liked it. I'm sure I'll make this again.

Pretty good, but lacked the zing I expected from the orange.
