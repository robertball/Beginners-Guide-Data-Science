This recipe ROCKS!  There's just something about chocolate and cinnamon...mmmm!  The only thing that I do differently, is instead of bothering with melting the chocolate in a container, I just sprinkle the top of the pan with the chips and put the pan back into the oven for a minute or two until the chips are spreadable.

This got great reviews from my friends; however, the chocolate was too messy.  I had to refridgerate it in order to cut the cookie into bars.  Unfortunately, because it was a very hot weekend I had to put the left overs in the refrigerator and the cookie becomes stale, not to mention that chocolate should not be refridgerated.  I'll try this again, only next time I'll stir the chocolate chips into the batter before baking and not on top.

Yum - I think I'd cut the chocolate by half next time.  I like my chocolate but it's a lot.  It didn't quite temper so it's sort of like gooey frosting, but it's delicious.  I think these would be great with some peanut butter or peanut butter chips in them.  Or maybe peanut butter chips swirled with melted chocolate chips for the topping.  Really good overall!

These cookies were delicious and relatively easy to make. I melted the chocolate in the microwave and spread it over the cookies as soon as they came out of the oven. They took a long time to cool enough to cut, but  they were worth the wait. Next time I would cool them in the freezer if I was pressed for time.

This cookie bar was too much.  I had to put the chocolate in the refrigerator to set up and the cookie part was too "cakey" for my taste.  Not a bad recipe, but I won't make again.

I added 1/2 cup cocoa to the batter and 1.5T oil.  Batter was still a bit dry and sticky;hard to work with. Finished product is like a brownie with oatmeal, just not super moist.  Satisfied my chocolate graving, just don't like dealing with the sticky batter.

I found these rather dry - possibly because I used oil instead of marg., but my family loved them. Next time I think I'd use only two cups of oats.

This was OK but we probably won't make again.  I sprinkled the chips over top right after it came out of the oven and covered with a cookie sheet until they had melted, then used a spatula to frost.  Had to refrigerated to cut easily but the oatmeal part wasn't great when it was cool.  Not a BAD recipe, just don't know if it's worth a repeat.

I love this recipe and make it a lot. I mix the chips in, donâ€™t melt on top and I add 2t of cinnamon because I love cinnamon. Great recipe!
