Tasty! I did feel like the salsa was a bit heavy on the citrus, but that's just my opinion. I used fresh red cherry tomatoes from my garden and instead of brushing the tortillas w/ butter (which I love), I just sprayed them w/ cooking spray to be a little healthier, and that worked out great. Nice and fresh...I would make this again, but adjust the acidity to suite my taste. Thanks for sharing. :)

Yummy! I sprayed the tortillas like someone else suggested. Also, used the street taco size tortillas and make little pizzas out of them! A nice lunch! Tasty, too!
