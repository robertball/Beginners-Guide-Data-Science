Boring, bland, missing much.  The ingredients really did not blend together.

I thought this was such a light, yummy, healthy salad. I served it at my son's birthday party and the adults didn't stop complimenting it the entire time.

Cottage cheese is the dressing for this pasta salad.  Fresh chopped veggies, pasta and low-fat cottage made for a nice salad with a different twist.  This will be great in the summer and I feel you could use any fresh vegetable combination.

This recipe is a good base. I used frozen steamed broccoli and cauliflower because it's what I had on hand and it worked well once cool. Also, had to add some Light Italian dressing to give it the extra flavor it needed.

ThIs was very easy to make. I only changed the cottage cheese to one with garlic and chives in it. It tasted wonderful (waaaay better than I thought it would be after reading some of the other reviews) and was nice and filling. If you feel like it needs more flavor I recommend a adding a small amount of creamy Garlic avocado dressing to your portion. Also I am making it again with spring onion and cucumber added to it.
