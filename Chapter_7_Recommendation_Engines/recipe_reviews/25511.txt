The way I originally submitted this recipe was not on frozen rolls!  I don't know how it was changed.  I always use the Pepperidge farm dinner rolls in the foil pans.  This recipe will fill 2 of those trays.  They taste just like the popular miniature burgers!  Everybody kept asking for more.

Great and simple recipe!!  I used about 3/4 of the onion soup mix as recommended by others and they turned out great!  I used brown and serve rolls that I had baked previously according to the directions.  I then used 2 9x13 pans to put the bites into with the meat packed into them.  The key is to make sure that the foil covering the bites is good and tight otherwise the bites can come out hard instead of soft and delicious!

I am not sure why these are called Super Bowl Bites, but my family likes them no matter what they are called.  I made the whole recipe a few weeks ago, and froze half for a later date.  What a nice surprise when I made the frozen ones last night.  This recipe reads like it should just be a simple recipe, certainly not something an 'experienced' cook would think should be gourmet.  I would make these again easliy and know that my family will enjoy them. Thanks Kathy W.!

To solve any bun problems-flatten meat out onto a cutting board, and use pizza cutter to cut into squares. Bake on cookie sheet covered in foil. Heat premade dinner rolls (e.g. Sara Lee) in microwave for 45 seconds. Buns will be soft but not soggy.

I enjoyed these and they were very easy to make. I used both Hawaiian Sweet Rolls and Hawaiian Honey Wheat - the store I went to didn't have Savory Butter flavor as another poster mentioned.  The sweetness was a little overbearing, but I could taste the concept of the recipe and will definitely be making it again with a different roll. That being said, I followed the recipe to the letter with one addition, I placed the pan of "bites" inside another pan that had about a 1/2-inch water in it.  The steam would prevent the rolls from getting hard on both the top and bottom. The smell of this dish was definitely that of WC, the taste was close - close enough, everyone enjoyed them. I didn't have a problem with the cook time as others did, the meat was done in 30 minutes just as stated in the recipe and it wasn't soggy or unevenly cooked.  I still have some of the mix left, I just have to run to the store and get some more rolls.  This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks Kathy W for posting it. TIP: If your rolls are buring, check the location of your oven rack, it may be too close to the top or bottom of the oven, it s/b in the center. Also if the meat is not done in the time recommended, the patty may be too thick, these should be thin burgers, just like the restaurant. UPDATE: I tried the recipe using Hawaiian Savory Rolls WITHOUT the water bath and the rolls were kinda crunchy/toasted, I prefer the softer bun using the water bath.

Just like White Castle, if you can get the meat cooked!  There is a lot of conflicting info in the reviews and after reading it all I tried the recipe as submitted but ended up with raw meat. So, I retried using 90/10 ground beef and mixed ingredients then rolled meat mixture out and cut into 24 squares with a pizza cutter. I placed patties in a large glass baking dish and baked meat only at 350 for 25 minutes which was a little long...try 15-20 minutes. Then I placed the patties on buns (do not use sara lee; this is WAY too much bread) using King' Hawaiian SAVORY BUTTER rolls. Cover in foil and heat in oven at 350 for 10 up to 15 minutes until warm. These were cooked and delicious!

Whatever you do, do NOT use whole wheat rolls to make these.  I did and it was horrible.  The wheat taste was overpowering after baking and we had to throw them away.

White Castle has nothing on these little morsels! My husband could not get enough! Made them twice, the first time I followed directions but the second time I found it easier to bake the frozen rolls per the package directions then slice them, add the meat mixture, top with processed cheese slices and serve. Man are these good! Must try!

We loved this recipe!! I doubled the filling for 24 rolls, didn't seem like 1 pound of ground beef would be enough. Perhaps the rolls I found were a little larger? I scooped the meat on to the rolls with a small icecream/cookie scoop, and it worked out perfectly for 24. Cooked them for closer to 45-50 minutes since there was more meat. Yum! Can't wait to make them again!

We used to make something similar to this and lost the recipe.  I am so happy that we found it again, and this one may even be better.  We mad these for Thanksgiving, while we watched football.  Everyone loved them and gobbled them up in a flash.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

I Read several reviews before making these and used a combination of tips. First rolled out beef mixture and baked on foil lined cookie sheet for 15 minutes. Next, I cut them in squares with a pizza cutter and placed on rolls. I used Hawaiian king rolls. Some thought these were to sweet but we liked them. I used a glass baking pan and covered them tightly with aluminum foil. Baked for additional 15 minutes. I have made them twice now and everyone loved them. They are not "gourmet", as some reviews criticized but are easy and tasty. Kids and husband loved them. 
You can also use a leaner beef and less cheese to make them a little less fattening. Also, I used about 1.5 lbs of beef, a full packet of soup mix, and about 6 ounces of cheese.

Made these for Super Bowl party yesterday - they were a hit! Used 93% lean ground beef, they were not greasy at all. I did add more meat (about another 1/2 lb) to the one packet of soup mix and threw in some more cheese.  I agree that one pkg for just 1 lb of meat would be too much. Used King Hawaiian rolls. Placed them in a low-sided pan so that there was no air space above the rolls, wrapped the foil tightly and they stayed nice and soft. Had the left overs for dinner tonight, heated in the micro wave they were still soft and yummy. Thanks for the recipe!

I used the whole pack of seasoning and it was not too strong at all.  I actually thought they could have used more salt.  I bought 2 packs of Sarah Lee dinner rolls, they came in packs of 12 rolls.  The rolls are all attached together so I split them into bunches of 6 rolls stuck together.  I sliced the tops off each bunch of 6 rolls and put the bottom parts into the baking dish.  I divided the meat up into 4 parts and plopped it down on each section of rolls.  Then I spread the meat out so it covered all the bottoms.  Topped them, covered with foil and cooked 35 minutes.  They came apart easy because the rolls were already divided I just had to pull them apart a little.  The bread was soft, not soggy and the meat was perfectly cooked.  The way I made them was quick and easy with no mess.  The kids loved these mini burgers with chips.

I really liked these. I'd maybe try a little less dry onion soup mix. Tasted a little over powering with the whole packet.

Made these the other night using the recipe on here for dry onion soup mix in place of the packaged stuff. The flavor was good and buns were soft but the meat was hard and dry. Don't know why as I followed the recipe exactly. Maybe my oven was hotter? I may try again but not sure what to do differently to keep the meat from getting dried out as I want to be sure it's cooked thru too.

Turned out way better than I expected, the bottom of the roll wasnt greasy at all. I used Hawaiian rolls, and I wont do that next time, as it made them too sweet. Everyone loved them still, and this is such a different recipe than Im used to, with the raw meat going on the rolls like that. Im very pleasantly surprised!

These are wonderful! I used one package of Hawaiian Rolls (12), ground chuck, 2% cheddar cheese, light mayo, and the dry soup mix. I put 1/2 the recipe on one package of rolls, just as the recipe says to do.  No soggy bottoms at all. I was a little concerned that they would be too oniony, but they weren't. Definitely a keeper! *** The next day, I wrapped one in a paper towel and warmed it up in the microwave.  Still very good!

This recipe is so good.  Though I couldn't bring myself to put raw meat on the buns.  Sarah Lee now makes mini buns and these worked great for me.  At the suggestions of other reviewers, I pre-cooked the meat - flattened in a 13x9 pan - and baked for 8 mins.  Then cut and put on the buns.  SO GOOD!  This is definitely a keeper.

These are GREAT.  We made these last night to give them a trial run before Super Bowl.  I followed the recipe and added minced dried onion & a few dashes of worcestershire (only because that is what we add to homemade turkey burgers).    We definitely did not think they were salty as some reviewers.  I used dinner rolls from the bakery section of the grocery store.  I did top with a damp papertowel while cooking, which was needed.  The bottom bun was still a little on the hard side but not a big deal.  I don't think a damp papertowel on the bottom would work.  I cooked at 350° for 40 minutes and the meat was done.    My husband and daughter said they taste exactly like "sliders" & LOVED them.   (I submitted a photo and unfortunately there is really no way to make them look as good as they taste.)    Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It is a keeper.

My husband really liked these, me not so much, but I think thats just due to personal tastes.  I flattened burger mix onto a small cookie sheet and baked at 350 for 15-20 minutes.  Then I cut the meat into square pieces to fit inside the buns.  I used Sara Lee dinner rolls for the bread and baked the sadwiches for a few minutes in the buns.  Pretty easy.

These were just okay to me.  They were a little bit bland for my taste.  The bread was dry, but that's because I didn't use the ready-to-bake rolls but rather already prepped bakery rolls.  Will try them again with a little more spice and the ready-to-bake rolls.

These were really excellent!  The bottom of the rolls (I used Hawaiian butter ones) did get a little crispy so next time I'll put them in a water bath.  Thanks!

These are so good!  I did cut back a little on the onion soup mix as well and added a tiny bit more cheese...You can't make enough of these!

These were really tasty! I made the recipe exactly as written and didn't find them salty at all. I used Pepridge Farms slider rolls and they were the perfect size. These were super simple to put together and had awesome flavor. I will definately be making these again! Thanks for posting. :)

Made these for Super Bowl and they were a hit! I used the suggestion of another reviewer and pressed the meat mixture into a rectangle then cut squares to hit the rolls using a pizza cutter. Simplified the assembly. I also tried precooking 1/2 of the meat on a cookie sheet covered with foil before putting on the rolls, then heating in oven covered in foil until warmed enough. The other 1/2 I cooked the meat on the rolls as directed in the original recipe. I did not think the buns were too soggy this way and preferred the taste, the meat flavored the rolls a bit. I did use 95% lean beef so it was not overly greasy. I did think the full amount of onion soup mix was too salty so next time I will cut back on it and add either fresh chopped onion or dried minced onion. I did serve with dill pickle slices, mustard and ketchup on the side so people to dress their sliders to taste.

This recipes is exactly how I hoped it would be from the reviews! Having moved to the Northwest from the Midwest, I discovered that there are no White Castle restaurants here. This is definitely the perfect White Castle "fix"! My whole family loved them and I will make often.  Followed the recipe exactly and super easy!!

This recipe is so full of flavor.  I have used inion soup in my hamburger mixture and it did not get the oomph!! that this recipe gave to it.  I guess the cheese had something to do with it.  Anyway, my family, (husband, 8yr. old and 2 yr. old) loved it.  Thanks Kathy W.

Awesome! Mixed ground chuck, mayo, Lipton onion soup mix, and shredded cheddar, pressed in a 9x13 pan and baked on 350 for about 20 min. Then used a pizza cutter to cut the meat into squares. Added to Sara Lee dinner rolls, wrapped in foil and "steamed" in oven for about 8 minutes. Added a dill chip and a squirt of mustard and voila! The whole family loved them. Really easy to prepare too. Will be making these again for sure!

WOW, these are awesome, i followed others suggestions and pressed and pre cooked hamburger mixture into  9x13 pan, cooked at 350 for 25 minutes then cut into 18 squares (because they shrank so much) i used 1.19 lbs of ground round and followed the original directions for 8 oz shredded cheddar and 1 pkg dry onion soup mix and TBS mayo . after the meat mixture was cooked and cut i split the rolls and placed the square piece of hamburger  into the rolls. and then wrapped the whole bunch of them in double wrapped tin foil and placed them back in oven at 250 to warm and steam the rolls.. the only problem is they stuck a bit to the bottom of the tin foil.. the taste was amazing served them with baked french fries II

I just moved into my own house and I've never cooked before, so I'm learning by experimenting.  I was having a few friends over for the Super Bowl and searched and found this recipe this morning.  I decided to chance it and was blown away how great it is.  It's super easy to make and it tastes amazing.  My friends scarfed them down in no time.  I definitely recommend giving this one a try ASAP.

I added I Tbsp steak sauce instead of the onion soup mix. These are fantastic. We had a wedding at our house and I served these burger bites during the cocktail hour. They were a huge hit. I also just served them at Super Bowl XLII and everyone loved them!!

I did as other reviewers did and used only half of the onion soup mix. The only problem I had was that the bottom of the bun was crunchy and hard. Is there something else I should do to make them soft?? I used lean meat, was that the problem? Thanks anyways.

I made two changes -- I cut the onion soup mix in 1/2 and I didn't have any rolls, so I used Pillsbury Flaky Biscuits (which made only 16). The biscuits made it really great actually and I highly recommend trying it that way! The only needed to cook about 30 minutes. Anyway, they came out really good. I probably would use some salt or something next time, though. So, all in all, very good.

These are simple to make, easy on the budget, and a big hit with the everyone. 
What more can you ask for? 
I couldn’t find the buns listed in the recipe so I used regular hamburger buns.

Very good sliders!  I made them for the Super Bowl and they were a hit!  My husband took the leftovers to the office and he said that they heated up well in the microwave.  The next time I make them I will decrease the onion mix.  We are not big onion eaters, though!  I took the suggestions of other members and rolled the beef mixture onto a cutting board and then cut perfect squares.  I then placed the sliders on the top portion of a broiler pan (completely covered in aluminum foil) and placed it on top of the bottom pan that I had filled with water.  I tightly covered the sliders and baked them in a gas oven for 35-40 minutes!

Very good!  I also cooked the meat first on a 9x13 pan, because speading raw meat on buns sounded kind of gross.  But the flavor of these was so good!  I followed other reviewers and used hot dog buns cut in thirds (that way I didn't even have to go to the store, I had everything on hand) It wasn't too much onion soup mix for us, but I did have about 1 1/2 pounds of meat.  Great recipe, so easy and delicious, I will make these often.

I followed recipe other than my cheese being mozzarella simply because that is all I had.  These really did taste like white castles.  Even the heart burn later :).  My rolls came in an aluminum tray so I assembled in the tray and wrapped the entire tray in heavy duty aluminum foil.  Baked for 30, my buns were perfect and my meat was cooked.  Family loved them.  I will make these again!!

We love this recipe! I've made it twice within 2 weeks.  I followed the recipe exactly.  We did not feel the entire packet of onion soup mix was too much.  It was perfect.  I even think I can sub lowfat mayo, and it will still be good.

I made these for a superbowl party and replaced the hamburger meat with ground turkey. I also used whole-wheat rolls. I don't think anyone even noticed because they were too busy scarfing them down! They were gone within an hour...

These were awesome! I made them for super bowl and everyone loved them. My boyfriend liked them better the next day microwaved because the bottoms weren't crunchy. If they could be made without the bottoms getting crunchy they'd be even better!! Very close to White Castles!!

These were pretty good. The recipe was a little confusing when it came to the rolls though. I bought already baked dinner rolls and just cooked the meat on a griddle. I am assuming the recipe wanted you to buy frozen dinner rolls but I am not sure

These are sooo good!I was a little scared of the raw meat going on the bun,thinking it would end up greasy but it didnt.I used 85% ground beef and Martins Potatoe party rolls,which come in a 24 pack.Everyone loved them.

This rolls were absolutely fabulous!  So easy to make and they were all gone in no time.  These are great for kids and adults also.  Didn't really change a thing except I added just a little more mayo.  Per other reviewers, I used a damp paper towel on top of the rolls.  They came out perfectly.  Thinking about trying them on the grill.  Has anyone attempted this?  Would be interested in knowing how they turned out.  Great recipe - Thanks!!!

Not that good. The meat tasted like mini meatloaves. The buns however where good. I liked the crispy bottoms.

We love these! I could've sworn I had onion soup mix but couldn't find it so I just added minced dried onion. I also added a little salt & pepper & just put sliced american on top instead of cheddar. They taste like a cross between White Castle & McD's little cheeseburgers. MMMmm

Amazing!! I used the savory butter Hawaiian rolls. Just make the meat mixture, slap it on the rolls and bake, yum! No need to pre bake the rolls, use fresh not frozen and save yourself a step.

These burgers have an amazing flavor!!! I made them as sliders the first time and they turned out great, the only downfall was that the buns got hard quickly so the leftovers didn't taste as good.  About a week ago I decided to see if the same recipe would work for regular hamburgers, and it surely did!  I used probably about 3/4lb of ground beef and created the mixture by using low fat mayo instead of regular.  I also didn't use the entire packet of onion soup mix because I was afraid of overdoing it.  After making the mixture I made two patties and put them in the oven in a 8x8 pan with foil over top of them for the same time directed by the recipe.  There was a ton of juices in the bottom of the pan which showed me how much the slider buns soak up.  The burgers tasted great to me and my husband complimented me on them. I think they could have been a little more flavorful so I'm going to use more (probably all) of the onion soup mix next time around and I'm going to continue cooking them in the oven without rolls so I can get the least amount of fat per serving that is possible.

These were a huge dissapointment.  There was hardly any flavor and the bread just overwhelmed any meat flavor there might have been.  I only made 14 (instead of 24 as the recipe calls for) and it was still tasteless.  Will not be making this again.

Taste is right on with these, but I didn't have the courage to spread the meat mixture directly onto the buns in a raw state (I have a 3 yr old.)  I precooked it for like ten minutes beforehand.  Here's the secret White Castle addition I added - mix a small bottle of strained Veal Baby Food into the meat mixture -- yup, believe it or not!  The buns are important in this recipe too - I think the best option is cheap store brand hot dog buns cut into thirds, personally.  I got some nice mini kaisers from the bakery but they were just too bready and not authentic.  Great recipe idea though - thank you for the post!

My hubby and kids love these little burgers.  I do use the wet paper towel on top that other reviews suggested and using a 9x13 pan to pat out the meat and cut into even squares is great.  I usually use ground turkey and 1/2 pack of of the soup mix, but do add some of my homemade bbq sauce or A1 to the mix.  these reheat great in the microwave.

Love the idea, but not crazy about the flavor of the burger.  Have never been to White Castle, maybe they are supposed to taste this way.  The recipe though did work great--used a very lean beef so no greasy buns.

Made these for our Canadian Grey Cup night and they were a hit!  Turned out really nice, and were very easy to make.  Almost tasted like a sausage roll to me because the bun gets a little crispy.  We did have some left over which my husband also really enjoyed in his lunches for a couple days.

Ok. I just made these. Followed recipe, except after reading reviews only used 3/4 Pkg soup mix. These had a great flavor, but was not seasoned/salty enough. Saved half of mixture to make tomorrow and will add the rest of the soup packet. Also, was worried that they may be soggy after just putting the raw meat on the roll, but the opposite was true. Cooked mine for 25 minutes and the meat was very done, but the rolls were almost burnt, VERY crispy (even after covering very tightly with foil). Tomorrow will only cook for 15-20 minutes and/or maybe at slightly lower oven temp.

These were so good! I did use the whole packet of seasoning, and did not think that it was too salty and I don't care for salty foods. I couldn't make them quite as stated since I only had cheap hamburger and didn't want all of that grease in my rolls. So I also baked the meat in the 9x13 that I had also made rolls in at 400 for about 15 min. I didn't add the cheese in, one of the kids don't like it, so I sprinkled it on top after baking. Even my three year old, who never eats any meat but chicken, ate her whole slider. I made Sweet Dinner Rolls from this site and made 16 sliders.

This is great recipe for get-togethers. I have made it several times. My only recommendation is not to squeeze a double batch in a pan. The middle burgers do not get done and the outside burgers dry out quickly.

Wow these taste just like White Castle! I did change it up a bit. I first browned the ground beef on a skillet. While the meat was browning I added 1 tablespoon of mayo, 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce,a little bit of dried minced onion, and some handfuls of shredded cheddar cheese. I then baked them in the oven for about 10 minutes and put more cheese on the rolls. Woah! They were amazing!!!I think next time I will caramelize some onions to put on the burgers!

I made two batches of this recipe. One batch was on soft dinner rolls. The second batch was on french bread baguettes. They were both equally delicious, but the men liked the bigger french bread bites. The only thing I will change next time is I will add more meat on the buns. Served with mustard and pickles!

These are delicious!  They do taste very close to White Castle hamburgers.  I have ketchup, mustard, and dill pickle slices available for individual people to add if they choose.  I usually use hot dog buns cut in thirds for the bread.  I tried them with Kings Hawaiian rolls once, but they weren't that great on the sweet bread.  Overall a great recipe!  Thanks!!

Easy, easy, easy! And my family loved them. I had a little more than a pound of very lean beef, used a whole Knorr package (which is more than the recipe calls for), and opted for potato rolls.  Would not change a thing.  Everyone asked for it to be permanently added to the family's recipe book.  Even cold the next afternoon, they were still good.

These were a real hit!  Be sure to add a pickle or two as soon as they come out of the oven.  These really take care of the craving for White Castles. Thanks for sharing your fun, easy and yummy recipe!

These were a total hit at my Super Bowl party.  It's a month later and I am still getting requests for the recipe.  I gave them 4 rather than 5 stars because the buns do get a little soggy/mushy - maybe slightly leaner meat may have worked better, but the trade-off may be flavor - I would definately make them again!

So delicious for such simplicity! My son's eyes lit up with surprise when he took his first bite. We don't have any White Castles up here, and these are very close. My only problem is that my rolls get hard instead of soft. Any suggestions? I doubled the foil the second time but they still came out crunchy.

Awesome. like many reviews i use hawaiin rolls. i cut them in half and throw them in the oven on a tray with about 2 minutes left on the time.  I use 85/15, 90 was too lean and changed the flavor for us too much.  i use lipton onion soup mix. when i cook them i only use about 75% of recommended cheese and put it on the side after. to spice things up i take about 2 tablespoons of pickled jalepeño juice and 5 tablespoons of dices pickled jalepeños to the beef mix before cooking. i make 12 equal patties per the other ingredients suggested on the orignal recipie.  after 20 min i pull out the tray a sprinle the remaining cheese on top of each pattie and place 1 pickled jalepeño on the top of each. it usually cooks perfectly at 23-24 min for our liking. after they come out i place a dill pickle slice on top of each as well.

I made the miniburgers exactly according to recipe, and they turned out surprisingly delicious! (I was very skeptical about raw meat on bun). And they were even better the next day warmed in microwave! I will make them again leaving out some of the onion soup mix. Also, it only made 12-I used potato dinner rolls.

I made these for the Super Bowl and the taste was great. The only thing I will change next time is to not bake them in the bun. The bottom of the buns got a little hard and my family likes them soft. Taste was amazing though!

I was impressed at how these turned out. They were very easy, and quite tasty.  Despite many comments, I found that 1lb of meat was sufficient for 24 buns. I used dollar rolls, and a small scooper to portion out the meat, and the ratio was very good. I also found the cooking time needed to be more like 40 minutes.  Definitely a good dish for a crowd!

These were good. I topped them with pepperjack cheese and sliced up baby pickles. Next time I'd put the cheese on during the last 10 minutes of baking. It made everything really greasy.

Followed the recipe exactly, but added a water bath below pan. Some reviews suggested adding a moist paper towel on top of rolls before baking. I will do this next time, as the tops of the buns were kind of crispy. Overall, a delicious recipe that was simple to make.

I lived in Brooklyn years ago, just down the street from a White Castle.  I never understood the appeal of their steamed sliders, I always thought they were slimy & gross. So I hesitated when I saw others comparing this recipe to the white castle version. I just made this yesterday (for the Super Bowl, yes!) and luckily it turned out delicious. The flavor is definitely very onion-y. I happen to love that, but I would cut back a bit on the soup mix if you don't love onion. As suggested in the recipe, I cooked this in the pan that the mini rolls came with. I used a pound of beef for only 12 buns so my burgers came out thicker, and I had to cook them longer. The buns were perfectly crispy yet soft inside. I added a lot more cheese. The texture of the meat ends up soft - a lot like meatloaf, so it can be hard to tell when it's cooked all the way through. This was a big hit with my husband. A genius way to cook mini burgers.

These are very good, although they do of course turn out extremely greasy...delicious though, and I was able to save them for a few days afterward in the fridge for lunches and snacks.

Amazing!  a much easier way to make sliders!  the onion soup mix is way too much though...cut it in half or even a quarter.  a shake or two of some dried minced onion doesn't hurt either!  i also spread some dill pickle relish on a few! yummy!  will make over and over!

I thought this was great.  My five kids agreed.  Since Onion Soup mix has MSG, I used dried onion and salt instead ( you could always use seasoning salt).  I also used the Earth Grains Thin Buns for lower carbs.  They were delicious as there is not much dough to get soggy.

I love these things!! I have made them several times and they always turn out great. I think the amount of onion soup mix depends on your taste. I always double the recipe and just use one packet but just because I don't like alot of salt and many of my friends don't really like onions. I usually use Giant Eagle brand dinner rolls. I use a cookie scoop for the meat mixture, flatten it and press it onto the top half of roll. It seems to keep the shape that way. Excellent every time. Thanks for a great one!

I have made these a few times and they always go over great.  The one change I made was doubling the recipe (adding a little less onion soup because it was too salty)and spreading it out onto a 9x13 baking pan (with sides) and baking it @ 350 for apx. 25 minutes or until no longer red.  Used a pizza cutter to cut squares and put onto the small dinner potato rolls.  You can also use hot dogs rolls by cutting the ends off and then slice them however large you need.  I have also made this and keep some in the freezer to keep on hand for a quick snack or easy dinner for the kids.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe! I love Crystals and White Castle so I was really excited to try this recipe. It lived up to my expectations. I used King's Hawaiian small butter rolls that I purchased at Wal-Mart. I had to sub. sour cream for the mayo, because I hate mayo. I prepared each roll with the meat mixture and then wrapped each roll with foil. After baking I let the burgers cool a bit before I unwrapped them, like 2-3 minutes. Served with ketchup and sliced pickle they were amazing!

I prepared these for our Super Bowl party and was holding my breath while doing so. This is b/c the other reviews made me a bit fearful w/ the soggy, or hard bread comments.  Well, I am here to state, they turned out PERFECTLY and ALL were eaten and enjoyed by everyone-kids and adults.  I used the rolls that you have to bake for about 8 minutes (w/ the lil' puffy guy that giggles). I did bake them first, sliced them in half, and added the beef mixture as instructed.  I used beefy onion soup mix and Velveeta shreds instead, and covered the (disposible) pan tightly, and they were soft and flavorful!  I think the rolls worked really well, b/c they are a little thicker and can handle the juices w/o becoming soggy. I will definetly make these from now on when we host events at our home.

Such a disappointment!  Onion taste was too strong; buns were hard; meat never got done.  Not even my easy to please husband would eat these.  If I try again, I'll cook meat on George Foreman grill first then put on buns. And no Onion soup mix!  I'll season with some worstershire sauce and salt/pepper.

I brought these into work for my boss's birthday and my co-workers loved them. I thought they were just ok. I expected them to taste more like white castles. In order to keep the buns from drying out I placed a couple of damp paper towels on the bottom of a 9x13 pan then sprayed it with non-stick spray. I then put the burgers on top and placed another damp paper towel over the burgers before wrapping in tin foil.  No problems with dry buns.  Also, they taste best with pickle and mustard.

Made these for the superbowl party.  They were totally unappealing.  Smelled very oniony - looked like white castle, but very mushy consistentcy.  Definitely will not make again.

Pretty Good, but the Lipton Onion Soup Mix is an overkill.  I think next time I will omit the soup mix and just add some A1 steak sauce for flavor.  I will also use jalapeno jack cheese for some extra "Bamm"!

These went over well at the party. When I make them again I will cut the onion soup mix by half. It seemed to be a little too much with the entire packet. They were not only good, but very easy to make.

When I made these I had to cook them for almost an hour to get them to brown and my husband had to cut the rolls in half they were so hard. (I used Rhodes texas dinner rolls-frozen-24 in a bag) I liked the taste but my husband thought they tasted like mini meatloaves on a roll.

EASY     TASTY     BUDGET FRIENDLY     KID APPROVED   

Did a trial run for super bowl party, made to the recipe using 93% lean meat & the Savory butter rolls. No water bath used and still no issues with the rolls.   .   And not soggy either!    

  I actually mixed the meat on a paper plate and then  divided up the meat mixture into equal parts and rolled each into a ball.  then I flattened it with my palms to fit the rolls.   (Used disposable kitchen gloves,   I didn't want a lot of uncooked meat making dirty dishes/pizza cutters, etc.  bit of a germ phobe I guess) 

Hubby very happy with the results, going on the menu for the game.  Three rolls wouldn't fit into the pan so I just wrapped them up in foil and baked that way.  Came out great!!!!!!!!!    No muss no fuss 

Thanks very much Kathy!!!!

Update 11/13/16:   I have made these so many times this past year because of requests from family members who love them, that I have the recipe memorized.  No better recommendation than that!  Note, I ALWAYS make to the recipe, see comments above

These were a hit at my Sugar Bowl party.  Everyone raved about them. Though I used all the same ingredients I did things a little different in the cooking.  I did not want greasy soggy buns so I opted to press the meat mixture on a nonstick cookie sheet and bake at 350 for 25 min.  When you see the amount of grease that comes from the meat mixture you will appreciate this extra step.  There was a lot of grease!   Then I cut the meat into squares and placed them on the buns.  I covered with foil and placed back in the oven for about 10 min. This warmed the buns and everything came out perfect.   Thanks for a great recipe!

Total success!I premixed meat mixture night before. I did precook the meat in the oven for a few minutes (325 for 8 mins.). Assembled as directed and cooked as directed and out came these awesome sliders! Next time, I'll follow directions exactly. Weird how the bun didn't sog up the way I imagined it would. Used Martin Potato Slider Rolls, added pickles and ketchup. Tasted exactly like WC!  Thanks for sharing.

Decided to try this for a Super Bowl party I was going to. Made it just like the recipe says except I omitted the onion mix and used ranch seasoning mix instead. Soo good! They were a big hit. Thanks for the recipe.

OMG! I made these for the first time for Superbowl Sunday and they are a HIT!! I could only find frozen Parker Rolls at the grocery store, so I let them rise and partially baked them (about 7 mins.), and then cut them in half. I used a tablespoon to measure out the meat mixture, then I rolled it and flattened it to the size of the rolls. I used a 9X13 baking pan and covered the rolls with foil, and then I covered the whole pan with foil and baked them for the time specified in Kathy's recipe. They were perfect!

I found if I use 90/10 or 97/3 ground beef the bites do not get too greasy. I also line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place the bites on a wire rack and that also helps out I have made these bites probably hundreds of times in the past 5 or 6 years. Very easy and very yummy!!!!

Flavors are there but it took twice as long for the meat to cook and even then we found a couple of super rare ones.   Buns were dry on the edges and tasted almost burnt.

I subbed 1.2 lb of ground turkey, 2% shredded cheddar cheese, and baked in a 9x13 pan before I cut with a pizza cutter and served on dinner rolls.  They went over very well when I served them for dinner and when I took them to a Super Bowl party.

These are delicious and not at all soggy. I placed a damp paper towel on the top buns before wrapping in silver foil as another person suggested. The bottom buns were actually crunchy.

The only rolls I could find in the store were the aunt millies.  They are about double the size so there are only 12.  The flavor was great, just like those famous mini burgers.  I put a water bath in the oven to try to prevent the rolls from getting to done, but they still were a little hard.  I think next time I will cook for a few minutes less as the meat was plenty done enough.

This was a fun idea for a week night meal for our family.  I used Sara Lee dinner rolls and ground round.  We weren't crazy about the sogginess of the buns from the grease of the meat and may cook meat first next time.  Used another reviewers idea for placing damp paper towel over buns to keep them for getting overly dry on their tops.  This worked great.  Overall fun idea for a recipe.

I really like this recipe.  I did not mind the rolls being a little "crispy" on top.  We added more mayo after they were done.  Very good.

The taste was great! The only problem was the buns came out a bit too hard. I think next time I'll roll out the meat, cut into squares and bake covered as directed. Then just warm the rolls up a little at the end. Will definitely make again---thanks for the recipe!

I tried these 3 ways, prebaking the buns a bit, not baking them, and not baking whole wheat buns! Just to see....They all came out great, and the gang actually prefered the unbaked bun variety, less work for me! Made the meat mixture just as directed. A delicious, fun recipe! If you have teenage boys gaming at your house this should be a staple!

These were good but mostly just tasted like onion soup mix.  It's important to not use more that 1 lb. of hamburger.  The package I had was 1 1/2 lbs. which added an extra half hour to the cooking time.

This is my first review I have ever done....  I absolutely loved these. I used Hawaiian Savory Butter rolls as one had suggested. I also baked the meat separately on a cookie sheet as another had advised and then cut the meat with a pizza roller and distributed onto the buns. A pound of beef was not enough for my 24 rolls. I will use more meat next time.

These were a hit at our Super Bowl gathering.  I used ground turkey breast, which can be dry, so I added another tbsp of mayo to the mixture. Will definitely make again.

I was very reluctant to put raw meat in the buns and then put in the oven. It turned out superb. I left out the cheese and the mayo. It wasn't missed. They went very quickly. A 1/2 pound of ground chuck from Whole Foods was enough for the 12 mini/slider buns I bought.

I made this recipe as written.  The bottom bun was soggy and I used 92% beef.  We ate them as open faced sandwiches, the meat was delicious and I cooked them for 40 minutes, so do others eat them soggy?

First time submitting a review although I use this site frequently. That is how good these mini burgers came out!   They were much better then I had expected and very easy to make.  I was concerned the that raw meat would not fully cook or would make the roll soggy and gross but not so.  These were a huge hit with the crowd of kids and adults.   I followed the recipe with one exception, I used ground turkey instead of beef...so good.  Also I made them in the morning and kept them in the firdge until game time and everyone raved about them.  The leftovers were even tasty as a midnight snack.  This one is a keeper for sure.

I must have done something wrong.  The buns were hard, even when I took them out of the oven after the recommended cooking time.  At that point in time the filling was not cooked completely, so I cooked them a little longer. I used 93/7 ground beef...maybe a bit less lean would be better.  I will keep on reading the reviews to see where I failed.  Otherwise, I will not be making again.

These are great little burgers. I am lucky my breadstore supplies Krystal with thier buns and sells the surplus at the store cheap. I followed the recipe exactly except used colby jack cheese cause thats what I had, this is a keeper.

The taste of these were great!  But my bottom buns were soggy and burnt, and I only cooked them for 20minutes.  Luckily I only made 4 the first time.  With the remaining burgers I fried them in a skillet, nuked the buns for about 10 seconds, and then put the burgers together.  I will definitely make them again because I love those famous little White Castle and Krystal burgers, but I'll cook them differently.

Grrrreat! I was a bit scared because of other reviews but decided to give em a whirl. They were perfect and easy. The best part was that I only needed a few ingredients for this. 1 LB of chuck for 24 "mini burgers". I was confused as to which type of roll to use. I used a dinner roll, the soft kind that you purchase in the bread isle. I used more than half the packet of onion soup mix also b/c of reviews. And yes, these do remind you of a White castle burger(slider). I opted to spread this burger mix out on a cutting board and cut it into squares and place on the bun. The bun wasn't especially soft but not too hard either. After they cool off and need to be nuked that problem is quickly solved. Will be making these again soon.

I would have given this 10 stars if I could!  Like others I'm sure, I was real leary about putting the uncooked hamburger on the already cooked dinner roll...but this came out absolutely perfect and soooo yummy!  The flavor was awesome, and everyone last night at the Super Bowl party raved about the taste too.  This is my new 'take to a party' dish.  Extremely quick to put together too.  I used the buttermilk rolls and cooked them according to the package - great recipe!

Great burgers....do take like White Castle - I will definitely make these anytime I'm craving!  The crowd at the Superbowl party raved over them! However, the buns did get a little too toasted for me.  I did put the wet paper towel over the top!  Still great though!

After reading all of the reviews and directions I have become very confused.  Do you use frozen rolls (still frozen) and cook OR do you prepare as package directions state and then cut the uncooked dough in half (scissors), assemble, then bake? Or am I missing it all together and you bake the rolls according to package directions, assemble sandwiches, then rebake?  I'm so confused, PLEASE HELP!!!!

This recipe is great! Really does have that White Castle flavor. I did have the problem with the bun drying out, so I tried damp paper towels underneath as suggested by another reviewer, but then I had dry on top, soggy on the bottom. Maybe I should cover them with foil and add a small pyrex dish of water to the pan, will try next time. Anyway, all in all these things rock!

I am hesitant giving 4 stars because the recipe is so good and so easy too!  Fun to make and eat!  Served for dinner. The buns were crispy on the top and bottom (even with wet paper towel sprayed with Pam that stuck a bit anyway!), and will experiment with other buns and maybe a wet paper towel on top too (???), BUT we kinda liked them crispy (pan rolls). I could not find the brand that was suggested by submitter (thanks for the great recipe! My 2 boys, husband and myself almost the entire recipe! (I thought about splitting it!  I may try another variety of soup mix next time, but the amount suggested was perfect for us!  Yummy!  Cannot wait to make again!  Would be wonderful for guests!

I made these for the Super Bowl last Sunday and they were such a hit.  I am a beginning chef at best and these looked easy enough.  I'll tell you they were gone by the end of the game and everyone was asking for the recipe.  The buns were slightly crunchy despite wrapping them tightly as suggested but no one seemed to mind as they were still delicious!

Made this for the super bowl. People compared them to white castle burgers. I used Turkey meat instead. Unlike other reviews, they didn't get soggy at all but that's probably because they were turkey. Couldn't taste a difference. I also used the damp paper towels suggestion. Great for parties!!

I goofed when making this recipe...I don't follow directions very well (and this has caused me much grief throughout my life :(  I browned the ground beef first then added the other ingredients except the cheese. Let this simmer until the dried onion was tender, then added the cheese. I then spooned the mixture in between the halved rolls, covered w/foil and baked for 25 min. THEY WERE FANTASTIC! Grease-phobes, however, won't like this recipe because the buns soak up the hamburger fat just like White Castles do. Excellent recipe.

These were pretty good, the bread gets gooey and i fancied them up with carmelized onions.  My husband said they had too much "other" flavor besides meat and he hated them. I'll make them again, but maybe with less onion powder in the mix.

These were great! I made them lastnight for Monday night football. I used Morning Star "soy crumbles" instead of beef. I had two people who aren't vegetarians and they both loved these. I thought they were delicious, too and I will make these again.

This recipe was very disappointing.  It gets two stars just for being very easy, but it just didn't have a good flavor.  The sandwiches came out soft, but my guys said that they tasted like bad Krystal burgers.

Seasoned my ground chuck like I normally season my burgers so no need for dry onion soup as onion powder is a staple in my seasoning variety.

These were so delicious its ridiculous.  I put the meat mixture between two sheets of waxed paper and rolled to an eighth of an inch then cut into squares and put on Hawaiian sweet rolls.  
Thanks to whoever posted this one.  It's a keeper!

Made these for my 16 year old and his buddies for super bowl. (No cheese). Used Hawaiian rolls. All 24 gone in 2 min, even with all the other food. Lol. Cooked 30 min. Update: this remains a crowd pleaser!

My family raved over this and insisted that these be in regular rotation.  The flavor is great, I wish I'd cut the onion soup mix back by 1/4 but they were very good anyway.  I only used 12 Sara Lee dinner rolls but kept the same amount of meat.  They took about 10 minutes longer to cook through but I think the meat to bun ratio was good.  About 5 minutes before they were done when I opened up the foil to check the temp of the burgers for doneness I brushed melted butter over the top buns and closed them back up again to finish.

This recipe is a hit with a slight change in the cooking process. I gave the recipe 4 stars because as is the bottoms were very hard. To avoid this, we cook the burgers on a broiler pan with a shallow layer of water in the bottom part of the pan,  just enough water to cover the bottom of the pan. Still wrap the burgers with aluminum foil tightly to seal in the moisture while cooking. This then allows the burgers to be steamed as a Krystal or White Castle burger is. Cook for 45-50 minutes. Allow to cool on the pan for 5-10 minutes uncovered. 

Also, we use King's Hawaiian rolls and 90% lean ground beef. I have made this recipe at least 8 times using this method and its great. The meat is cooked thoroughly in the middle and the bottoms are still soft. It has been a hit at several football parties.

I was surprised that you could put raw meat in buns, put them in the oven and not have a greasy mess.  Well you don't have a mess with this recipe just good sliders.

This was delicious. The next time I make it, I will decrease the amount of onion soup mix because it ended up being very strong -still delicious, but strong. I also used a wedge of laughing cow cheese instead of the mayonnaise and that worked great. Thank you for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe w/the exception of the rolls (I used dinner rolls, cooked according to package). My rolls came out a little crispy, not soft, not sure why. Overall, they were delish!

This is a great recipe!  My family loved it!  I made them exactly as directed.  The only problem was the rolls were too crispy on the bottom.  I made sure they were tightly covered with foil.  I did use a glass pan and that may have been a problem.  Also, the meat was not cooked through at 30 minutes, so I did bake an extra 10 minutes.  I know the meat was not too thick as I did not use more than the recipe required and I used the Savory Butter Hawaiian rolls.  I did not use all the meat mixture.  Next time I will be sure to use a metal pan and I may spread the meat out on a pan and cook separately.  Even with the cr

These are a party favorite! So easy and delicious, especially with Hawaiian sweet rolls as buns. Just don't forget to cover them in the oven - I did once and they were like little bricks! Still tasty though! Haha

I did not have the dry onion soup mix so I used a 3/4 of a can of condensed campbells french onion soup, added it the meat  mixture. Recommend the sweet hawiian rolls for sure! This is a great recipe and good for entertaining.

Very tasty burgers. I used a whole packet of beefy onion soup mix - didn't taste too oniony for us. I cooked the meat patties on a cookie sheet covered in foil for about 30 minutes. ALOT of grease came out of the burgers, so the buns would have been soaked had I done it that way. The grocery store was out of dinner rolls, so I actually used mini bagels - and they tasted very good!

Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I was incredulous immediately when I read this recipe.  As I foresaw the bottom bun because soaked in grease, the top bun was over cooked and hard and the meat was gray and unappetizing looking.  The taste was fine.  I followed the recipe exactly and covered it tightly with thick aluminum foil.    I did this recipe a second time and just fried them in a ribbed frying pan and warmed the buns in the toaster oven.  They were great.  Gene

I wasn't really impressed. It didn't make the buns as soggy as I expected, but I thought these were just OK. Great idea though.

I made these based on everyone's rave reviews but my family didn't like them at all.  If I make something like this again I won't use the strong Lipton Onion Soup mix, but maybe just some worstechire (sp?) sauce and a bit of onion powder.

These really did disappear!! The perfect addition to my Super Bowl party! I doubled the recipe and used 2 packets of Golden Onion dry soup mix by Lipton. I also put the meat on small snowflake rolls. These were a HUGE hit! They were so moist and tender... some people put pickles on them, but most just ate them as they were. I would make these again anyday!!

Super easy and delicious!  I used almost a whole packet of onion mix and it was good, but quite onion-y.  Would probably stick with half packet next time.  Will definitely make again!!

I can't give these anything but 5 stars!!!  I did use a little less than one package of soup mix, just the right amount I think.  I also put a damp paper towel over the hamburgers before covering with foil.....the were perfect!!!

These were very disappointing, especially after reading so many + reviews.  They are nothing like a burger, the cheese & onion mix & burger just turned into a weird tasting concoction & ruined a perfectly good batch of rolls.  I made them for SuperBowl & they hardly got touched.  I followed the recipe 100% & I had no problems with the bread being soggy or the rolls being too dry, it was just that the meat mixture was not tasty at all.  I had to cook it another 25 minutes before the meat reached 160 degrees, I suspect that many of the people who have made this are eating it undercooked & that is very scary! These might taste exactly like White Castle but I have never had any.  In the future, I am going to be more cautious about ratings, it is obvious that there are people who really like this recipe, just not my family & friends.

Slightly disappointing after all the hype. I didn't get any rave reviews &  have leftovers. Buns stayed pretty soft even w/o the damp paper towel. Just 1/2 the packet of onion soup mix was still too much. Next time, I would omit the soup mix & season the meat myself; although, I'm not sure when there will be a next time.

Hmmm...  With 5 stars I was expecting something really yummy.  These aren't that bad, but certainly not impressive.  An OK snack for a bachelor to make for his buddies, but nothing an experienced cook would be proud to serve.
