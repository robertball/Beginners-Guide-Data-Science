After making a few adjustments I found this to be one of our favorite recipes in our home! To make a 9x13 pan, I add 2 1/2-3 cups of COOKED long-grain rice (we prefer Basmati rice), add carrots to the celery to make about 2 1/4 cups (the carrots add more flavor than the celery alone), no more than 1 cup mayo, DEFENITLY add 2 cans of cream of chicken and if the mixture seems to dry add some milk until it looks better, and instead of topping with plain cornflakes use Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds!!! The honey gives it an awesome added flavor, it seemed to be the flavor that was missing after I made it the first time word for word from the orginal recipe. Oh, and I only cooked it for 20-30 minutes until it was warm. HIGHLY Recommend!!!

I have been looking for years for this recipe. I grew up with this dish, and it is one of my favorites! I tweaked it a little to suit our tastes, and the results were amazing. Here's what I did: - shredded the chicken instead of chopping into cubes; - used one can of cream of mushroom and one can of cream of chicken; 
- used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream; - finely diced the celery and sauteed it until soft; - used the water that I poached the chicken breasts in to cook the rice; - added pepper to taste; - doubled the amount of corn flake topping;  - baked casserole (without topping) for 30 minutes, then added the topping and baked for the final 15 minutes. Adding the topping in the last 15 minutes keeps the corn flakes from over-browning. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! :)

This is hands down my favorite all recipes dish ... with a few alterations.  I use sour cream instead of mayonnaise and roast garlic cream of mushroom as opposed to cream of chicken.  You can bulk up the almonds and celery, too, for a more hearty dish.  I've even made this with brown rice ... yum!

I made this with what I had on hand - no almonds or cornflakes.  I used half the amount of rice.  I added chopped green pepper and carrots, to increase the amount of vegetables and make it more of a one-pot meal.  I added some fresh chopped rosemary to the veggies and some grated parmesan cheese to the soup/mayo mixture.  These added a lot to the overall flavor.  Since I had no cornflakes, I made breadcrumbs by whirling a crust of bread in the food processor with some more parmesan cheese.  Instead of feeding 12, cutting back on the rice and adding more veggies meant it fed four easily.

This was ok, if I make it again I'll definitely make some changes. As it was, I followed some previous reviewers' advice and doubled the soup and added more sour cream than mayo.  It also used brown rice and bulked up the almonds and celery.  I think it needs a little more in the way of seasoning, and I can't imagine it coming out right with only one can of soup.  Also, i think I might try sliced sauteed mushrooms next time - and possibly as other reviewers mentioned I might try toasting the almonds to add to the flavor.  It was a good base for a casserole, but could definitely use some tweeking based on personal tastes.

I read all the previous comments and took some of the same advice. I used a box of uncle bens rice mix(butter/herb) and cooked it in the microwave. I sauteed the onion and celery with butter and garlic(2 cloves) and instead of mayo I added 1/4 cup of sour cream. I also added 1/4 cup of milk. I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of chicken. I cut up the chicken and cooked it in the same pan as the celery and onion but I added a bit of olive oil. Since the casserole bakes for 45 mins I did not cook the chicken very long in the skillet(5 mins or so) I topped the casserole with durkee fried onions instead of the potato chips/butter. It was soooo yummy!!!!

I love this casserole!!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for the cornflake topping.  Instead, I topped the casserole off with prepared Pepperidge Farm (Herb Seasoned) Stuffing.  (Add 1 1/4 c boiling water and 2-3 tbl of butter to 4 cups stuffing mix.)

This was fantastic.  My 3 year old cleaned her plate.  I halved the recipe, used cream of celery soup and ommited the celery.  I baked it in a 2 qt. casserole. (I did not halve topping or soup).
It was great!!!!!  Great for covered dish suppers.

Very good casserole overall- I added fresh sliced sauteed mushrooms, and I also used whole chicken breasts- placed them on top of the casserole and cooked it the same otherwise. I thought it needed more flavoring, some seasoning salt or garlic- it was a little bland.

Yum! This is a good dish. It has a unique flavor that we liked. (Although be aware that prep time is longer than the 30 min. Cooking, chopping and assembling all the ingredients took me at least 45 min.)
I made this recipe the first time, with the mayo and soup, as written. I only had 1/4cup of almonds and since my family does not like celery a lot I only added 1/2 cup minced celery with 1/4 cup minced carrots. I added some "nature's season", to the soup mix to add more flavor, since others said it needed something. The rice turned out moist and the mayo gave it an almost buttery flavor, although it still needed a little something extra.
The second time I added 1/2c. mayo and 1/2c. sour cream, as others suggest. The final result was not as good! We did not enjoy it nearly as well. It took away that unique flavor. 
Also, I know others are adding extra soup to make it more creamy, but this recipe isn't meant to be a creamy, soupy consistency. This changes the recipe too much; to something different. I still want to add a little more spice in the future.  Thanks for this good recipe.

My family of boys loves this recipe with a few changes!  I saute garlic in with the onion and celery, omit the mayo, use 1 can cream of celery and 1/2 can of cream of mushroom. This makes it more dry. Add broccoli florets and chopped baby carrots for color, mix in a few Durkee onions then top with the rest at the last minute. My boys like soy sauce on it believe it or not and it's good that way too!

Wow- this was a nice treat- very different from the usual casserole.  I did make a few changes- instead of mayonnaise I used one 8oz block of cream cheese and added 1/2 cup of milk.  I also sauteed the onion, celery, and chicken in white wine and butter before mixing it in with the rice.  I also added peas and carrots to the mix to give it some extra veggies.  Had to use a 9x13 pan instead of 8x8- this was a lot of food!  The whole family loved it- we will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

Very Very Delicious!  I added chopped carrots, and more onions, and followed everyones advice and did sour cream instead of mayo, and an extra can of soup over brown rice.  Amazing! Very addicting.

Sorry, the casserole was bland... but bland typically isn't a problem for me.  I don't like spicey foods. I used some of the tweaks given (2 cans of soup, water chestnuts, peas instead of celery because I hate celery). But the worst thing I did was try that honey bunches of oats for topping. Not only was the casserole too bland for even moi (and that was with adding salt and pepper), but the honey bunches of oats gave the savory dish a very unwanted sweet tang. I barely ate my portion and had to apologize profusely to my dinner guest.

I omitted the mayo and used a tin of cream of celery soup instead. I didn't have any celery, so I used sliced mushrooms. As per another reviewer, I used Ritz crackers instead of cornflakes to top it off. This was really good! Next time I think I'll make sure I have celery and I'll probably add other veggies as well - mushrooms again and maybe some chopped broccoli.

Try these modifications:
1. Prepare 2 cups of rice
2. Toast Almonds for more flavor
3. Saute two cloves garlic, diced green pepper, 2 cups celery, 1 cup onions and two chicken breasts cut into bite size peices
4. Combine with a can of water chesnuts and rice into a 9x13" pan  
5. Layer prepared Couscous with Parmesan vice Corn Flakes as topping
6. Place into pre-heated oven at 350 for 30 minutes or until golden brown on top

This was a good recipe, but I agree that it needed som extra flavor. I took advise of others and added some garlic. I assumed that the rice was to be cooked with water (2/1 ratio). The recipe should specify though.

this recipe was wonderful, i added a can of baby cob corn(drained)some sliced carrots and a little bit of grated cheddar cheese. I also toasted the almonds and for the topping i added some chow mein noodles. I just felt these additions gave it a little more color and a more oriental feeling.
to date it is my most requested recipe

YUM!  My husband is picky when it comes to cassaroles (no cream of mushroom for him!) and we both LOVED this!  I omitted the butter on the top (almost - I put 3 tiny specks) to save fat and no one noticed a thing.  Highly reccommended for weeknight or company.

this was a really great casserole, especially with a few minor changes that i made to the original recipe.  for the mayo, i used a 1/2 cup of light mayo and a 1/2 cup of light sour cream, added an extra can of cream of chicken soup, and instead of cornflakes used crushed club crackers on top.  i love the crunch that the almonds added - makes it different from your everyday chicken casserole.  very good!

This is a delicious recipe.  I followed the recipe except I did add 2 cans of cream of chicken soup as as well adding some carrots to the celery (thanks for the suggestion!), and instead of the cornflakes, I used crushed ritz crackers and almonds.

This would have been bland (so good for picky children)as is.  I added 1/2 cup sour cream, 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1 tsp. dill.  I liked the combination.  I only had pecans so I used those instead of almonds.  I also used crushed potato chips instead of the corn flakes because I didn't have corn flakes.

I thought this dish tasted wonderful, but it was a bit on the dry side.  Next time I make it I'll try two cans of cream of chicken soup, or maybe one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of celery.  I'll also add more salt, and lots of pepper to add a little more taste.

This was an ok recipe. It was dry and kind of tasteless. If I ever decide to make it again, I will add another can of cream of chicken soup and toast the almonds

I adjusted this recipe to 24 for our little towns pot luck supper and it was a big hit - not a grain of rice left.  However I did have to add an extra can of cream of chicken soup and 1 cup of mayo to get the perfect creamy texture I wanted.

After reading all the reviews (thank u), I made some changes for a 5 star recipe. Added chopped garlic to the celery/onion w/more butter, cheddar cheese to the mixture, toasted the almonds, and added dried cheddar onion rings for the topping.  I made rice according to the directions on bag. My husband loved it & he doesn't care much for chicken/casserole's.

With modification I gave this a 5 but without it would probably only get a 2.  I followed many reviewers advice and only used 2 cups cooked rice (I made instant).  Next I used 2 tbsp. butter to saute the veggies, added garlic and fresh lemon juice and salt & pepper.  Other than that everything else was the same.  If you use all the rice in this recipe I would double the sauce.

Very tasty and easy - works well to use rice and chicken prepared in advance.  A bit bland, but may need a little something in the dressing (or just some salt and pepper).

This dish really turned out good.  I have to agree with the other comments, DO NOT USE 4 CUPS OF RICE.  I used 2 cups of uncooked rice, and I STILL had 2 cups of cooked rice left over.  It wasn't a disaster, though.  I used the idea that others had, and made a rice pudding from a recipe I found on this site.  In the casserole, I cut up the chicken and cooked it in a skillet with curry seaoning.  Afterwards, I sauted the onions in the same skillet with the leftover juice.  I left out the celery.  I also toasted the almonds.  It was delicious.

This was a great company casserole. It was not only wonderful tasting but an attractive dish as well.  I did use the extra rice for rice pudding, toasted the almonds first and add some crushed garlic.  It is one to be repeated.

This recipe was easy to make and delicious, but I would definately make some changes before I try it again.  Firstly, I would add only approximately 2-3 cups of rice.  I would also toast the almonds before adding to the mix.  Also, be sure to use 9x13 dish and mix the mayonaise and chicken soup into the rice very well.

I also fixed this recipe for my son and daughter-in-laws wedding and had many people ask for the recipe.  I agree that the 4 cups of rice in the recipe should be "cooked rice" not uncooked rice.  When following the recipe the first time I had waaaay too much rice and had to make a rice pudding, boy did that disappoint my family.

Very Good.  We liked the crunchiness of the almonds(which I toasted),the celery and the cornflakes on top.  Flavors blended together well.  I will make this again.  I agree with other review that suggests that it is 4 cups of COOKED rice not 4 cups uncooked rice.

Honestly, I'm surprised this was catered in for someone's wedding. I found it to be pretty bland. =/ It wasn't bad, but it just tasted like chicken and rice with no seasoning to me. I do enjoy chicken and rice...but I was expecting a more flavorful dish. I'll be giving away the leftovers. Sorry!

Good if you have no other food in the house.  I adjusted like other reviewers suggested by adding half mayo and half sour cream, and used Honey Bunches of Oats on top.  It was more like rice with a few pieces of chicken, and this recipe wouldn't have been enough food for 12 if we didn't have hors d'oeuvres and a first course.  It was okay, but I won't be making it again.  And, the recipe says to top with crumbs and tablespoons of butter, but I think it may have worked better if the crumbs were combined with melted butter in a pot and then poured on top of the casserole as I do with another casserole that I make quite often.

So good! I also added a touch of sour cream, used 2 cans of soup and used ritz on top. I also used two bags of wild rice mix for my rice. It added a little color and flavor. We just prefer the wild rice mix in our house.  All in all the concept of this recipe is wonderful. I am adding it to my casserole list!

Pleasantly surprised family loved this recipe and gobbled it all down. Did as others suggested with 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayonnaise plus used 1 1/2 cans cream of chicken soup.  I also used honey bunches of oats with almonds but in small portion so not to make it too sweet.  For seasoning I used Emeril's Essence at 1 - 1 1/2 tsp. Sprinkle cheese on top and back!  Family loved it!

I made this recipe as written except I added fresh mushrooms, used sour cream in place of the mayo and used Honey Bunches of Oats with almonds as suggested by other reviewers. The casserole was fast and easy to prepare. Would recommend using the cornflakes,the Honey Bunches of Oats were to sweet for us. The casserole does need seasoning, as written it's quite bland.

great recipe. used 1/2 c sour cream and 1/2c blue cheese salad dressinginstead of Mayo.Added some cut asparagus. Also used Balsami rice cause thats what I had
on hand. Baked in 9x9 pan had plenty for 4 with a few left overs. used ritz crackers with the almonds and sprinkled both on top the last ten minutes. was sort of soupy, so let stand for 10 before serving on toast points.

Can't put my finger on exactly was wrong, did it need ?garlic, ?black pepper, ?mushrooms, ?can of green chile peppers, ?artichokes.  It was just okay but I imagine it would be a really good "tweaker".  Tried this once again with sour cream, mayo, both types of soup plus added fresh mushrooms and shredded carrots and garlic to the saute mixture.  Still just okay.

Bland. Husband said it would "be alright for a Tuesday night meal." Added fresh ground black pepper as well as French tarragon in order to liven it up a bit. Also, used half mayo/half sour cream instead of all mayo.

I think the 4 c. UNcooked rice is an error - the recipe should say 2 c. uncooked or 4 c. COOKED.  4 c. uncooked rice is a mountain of rice & too much for the recipe!  I toasted the almonds before adding them - delicious!

Great recipe!!!  And so easy to make!

I defenitely would suggest doubling the amount of soup.  I also just quartered some cooked chicken so that it left great portion sizes that were easy to serve.  

I also didn't have any corn flakes so I used Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds!  It not only tasted great but smelled great when it was cooking!

I am sorry to say that this recipe was so greasy and tasteless that my husband and I could only eat one helping.  Yes, I followed the recipe exactly as given, but it was one of the worst tasting recipes I have ever tried.  I am a pretty good cook and I thought this sounded pretty good, so I tried it, but my husband who likes almost anything I put in front of him, had to admit that he could barely choke it down and did not want anymore of it.  I couldn't blame him and I through the rest of it out.  It was a waste of ingredients.  I have made quite a few recipes found on this site and have had a good outcome with most.  I guess everyone has different tastes.  Sorry for the bad although honest review.

Based on other reviews, I doctored this a bit- I used  3/4 c. sour cream in place of the mayo and then added milk until it was the right consistency, added paprika, more onion and garlic. What I ended up with tasted ok, it was just really unsophisticated. It wasn't a total loss but I don't think I will be making this again.

I made this for the first time and thought it was delicious! I also used 2 cans of soup and used the Honey Bunches of Oats cereal although I did not add the carrots. I did not have to add extra milk and it came out fine. My husband actually went back for seconds and he is a picky eater! I will be making this again! I took a photo of the one I made and added it above. It's the one in the glass pan. 5 stars!

Wow, loved-loved-loved this! I did change a few things to lighten it up a bit (non-fat cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken; low-fat mayo; Pam spray instead of butter to saute and on topping).

This was hearty and comforting.  I used 3/4 cup of mayo and 1/4 cup of sour cream, and just the one can of cream of chicken like the recipe calls for, despite the many reviews calling for 2 cans of soup, and mine wasn't dry at all.  I boiled chicken breasts and thighs with celery, carrot, onion, and garic, and used the broth to cook the rice in - it was very flavorful, and even my husband, who hates celery, loves this, which I thought was funny since celery is a main flavor in the dish!

This was my first time making a casserole with rice, I usually make is with pasta. It was ok. I add seasonings for extra flavour. I also sauted garlic, red pepper and carrots. I halfed the mayo and added sour creams as per the suggestions of others.

This is a classic that I modified slightly from others' suggestions. I replaced mayo with sour cream and put Stovetop stuffing on top. I also used an entire onion and added garlic to the chicken. It's even better reheated a day or 2 later!

We loved this dish. However i followed the advice of others and added a 1/2 cup sour cream, a extra can of soup, some milk, and I sauted 3/4 cup chopped carrots, 1 red pepper chopped, and onions together till soft and added to the rice mixture. It was yummy!

I should rated this recipe years ago.  My first time using this receipe was after the Thanksgiving using leftover turkey. I've followed it without modifcations. I DO cheat and buy steamed rice from the local Chinese Restaurant though.  It is divine and comforting all at once.  Now it's become a tradition that I make this casserole the weekend after Thanksgiving.  I think my family looks forward to this casserole as much as they look forward to Thanksgiving.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I guess I can't call my version almond chicken casserole since I didn't use them because I didn't have them, but what I made based on this recipe has become a favorite. Instead of corn flakes I used Honey Bunches of oats.  I used Honey Bunches of Oats with Peaches crushed very fine for the topping. It would probably be even better with the almond version of the cereal.

This was an OK dish for a weeknight dinner.  It's hardy but a little on the bland side.  I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of the 1 can of cream of chicken.  I also omitted the chicken and added broccoli instead to make it vegetarian.

Excellent. My husband really likes this recipe. I'm not usually a big fan of casseroles, but this one was great. I was afraid this recipe would be bland, but it wasn't. I toasted the almonds before I added them, and it brought their flavor out more. Great. It was very simple to make.

It was fairly bland and tok a lot longer to prepare than noted.  I sauteed mushrooms in soy sauce and added to the recipe to give it some flavor- after that it was delicious!

My family normally does not like casseroles.  It was a big suprise when everyone raved over it!
I did use 2c cooked rice and a cup of chicken stock to make it a little more moist.
Thanks for a winner!!

I have made this recipe many times, it became a family favorite. The first time I didn't have almonds so I used cashews, and I used half wide rice and half brown rice. Have fun with this one it's very good no matter what rice or nuts you use.

Loved it! Hubby who doesn't like rice found it just okay. Daughter 1 didn't like it, daughter 2 liked it. I did cut down the mayo to 3/4 cup. I may cut it down to 1/2 cup next time. Found there wasn't much chicken for the amount of rice, so maybe I'll up the amount of chicken. Loved the cornflakes on top, and may sprinkle some cheddar cheese on top after it's done baking next time. Very comforting casserole. Will make again.

We liked this, although it seemed to be missing some sort of spice.  In the meantime, though, adding ketchup on our individual servings is great.  Good comfort food!

I followed other's advice and used 2 cans of soup as well as the honey bunches of almonds on the top. I also sprinkled some shredded cheddar cheese on top, before adding the cereal topping. And I omitted celery, but used carrots instead. I was skeptical of the recipe because I wasn't sure how much I'd like a rice casserole, but I wanted to try it. All in all, it was pretty good, but I don't think I'd make it again. I prefer my casseroles to have pasta in them. The rice just didn't appeal to me as much as I'd hoped. And I think the honey cereal topping added more weirdness than pizzaz. I should have stuck with the cornflakes!

It was just ok, I added curry powder and tried to save it, but it was bland.  I made the recipe for the Hot Chicken Salad and it was similar, but didn't have the rice in, you serve it over rice, and It was soooo good, I almost ate it all before I put in the the oven.  Try that one.

Really good!  I agree with BeccaP's changes.  I also swapped the cup of mayo for a 1/2 cup of light mayo and 1/2 cup of light sour cream.  I also added the extra can of cream of chicken soup.  It wouldn't have been nearly as creamy as it was if I hadn't.

Very good, too much rice in my opinion, I didn't add all of the cooked rice and I could have cut it back a little more. Loved the crunchy almonds, next time will leave out the cornflake crumbs and maybe just sprinkle with a little cheddar. Overall a good recipe.

Excellent recipe ***** I cut the chicken into strips and used mushroom soup but followed everything else in the recipe. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this dish turned out to be. It'll be a regular at our house from now on!!!

very good and easy.  I fried the chicken and cut up into small pieces.  Used two cans cream of mushroom and used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream.  I didn't have celery or corn flakes on hand, but will add them next time.

This is probably the best casserole I've had in awhile.  Even my hubby, who is not usually very excited about chicken LOVED it and said to add it to the permanent collection.  At the recommendation of another commenter, I added carrots and put Honey Bunches of Oats on top instead of Cornflakes.  Very yummy!

I followed many of the suggested adjustments: used brown rice; added some garlic; added extra soup; split mayo & sour cream. The end result was still bland and unremarkable.

I used a can of each soup, chicken and mushroom. (it was too much-should have stuck to the recipe) We liked it a lot but I will need to scale down next time. I only used 1 cup of uncooked rice and thought that was plenty. Loved the celery and almonds and will add even more next time.

I followed some of the other suggestions and added carrots, slightly less mayo and 1/2 cup of sour crean as well as milk.  I also substituted Honey Bunches of Oats with almonds instead of cornflake crumbs.  Although I liked the taste, family wasn't too crazy about this one.

This was just ok, I'm not sure I would make it again. Hubby didn't care for it because of the celery and almonds, and I thought it was a decent base but a little bland. I had to cut way back on the rice because it seemed like too much. Good texture however, and a nice comfort food.

My husband found this too bland to eat, but as I had a cold and had completely lost my sense of taste and smell, I had the challenge of eating it all myself throughout the week.  It had great texture though, which is important when you don't have flavor. :)

This was very good, my family definitely wants it again, with some revisions.  This time I used creamy chicken verde soup, and breadcrumbs instead of the cornflakes.  It was a bit dry, so I think next time I will add a 1/2 can of green enchilada sauce to moisten it up and increase the tex-mex flavor.

This is good but needs to be modified: use peas instead of celery, add some garlic to the onion sautee, add 1/2 cup sour cream and some milk or it will be too dry. Use crushed sour cream and onion potato chips instead of the cornflake crumbs. I think I will add some mozzerella next time to up the flavor even more.

This recipe was very good.  I made a few minor changes based on previous reviews.  I also used roasted garlic mushroom soup, toasted the almonds for more flavor, used Durkee onions in place of the cornflakes.  I substituted 1/2 c. of sour cream in place of the mayo, but next time I'm going to try the mayo instead.  I think it was slightly dry but the flavor was wonderful.  Next time I will try the mayo or maybe a little chicken stock added.  Also, don't forget to add the Durkee Onion rings just the last few minutes of cooking.  I forgot and they got pretty charred!  Great recipe, definitely a keeper and I'll make again.

We enjoyed this very much! Although, I took the advice of some others and made some changes. I used cream of mushroom soup w/roasted garlic and french onions instead of corn flakes. I made it the night before and put it in the fridge. then added the onions before cooking. The ONLY complaint I have was that I used all of the same amounts of ingredients this recipe called for and I only had enough for an 8x8 pan. ?? Maybe my chicken breasts were smaller..? I will make this again.

This casserole is delicious! I grew up with this dish and have been looking for the recipe for years.  

*One tip for making this dish even better is to prepare the casserole the night before (everything except the cornflake topping) and let it sit overnight in the fridge before you cook it. The flavors have a chance to mingle, and it really adds to the overall flavor of the end product. When you're ready to bake the casserole the nexy day, make the cornflake topping and add it just before you place it in the oven. 

Thanks for the recipe, K.T.! This is the perfect cold day comfort food. :)

I cut the chicken into bite-size pieces, browned them in olive oil, then added the onion and carrots and sauteed them til they were soft. If I were to make this again, I would omit the celery, and maybe use sliced mushrooms instead - I didn't much like the contrast of the celery and the almonds. I did, however, like the cornflake crumb coating. This is a great recipe for when you don't have much time in the kitchen. Thanks, KT!

I used brown rice.  I think the rice soaked up most of the sauce, because it was very dry.  I used french fried onions on top instead of corn flakes.  The next day I served it and added another can of Cream of Chicken soup, and stired in the onion topping.  It was better the second time around.  I won't make it again.  I used Miracle Whip instead of real mayo.  Wonder if that would make a difference in flavor?

To Dry ... I wondered if the recipe had been misprinted and should have only used 2 cups cooked rice. I have used a similar recipe from you sight and the rice was considerably less, resulting in a moister finished product.  This recipe needs to be adjusted.

I found this receipe to be very rich, perhaps I used too much mayonnaise.  However it was tasty.

Good recipe but needs tweaking.  There is something missing, I just don't know what.  I used brown rice, fat-free mayo and no butter.  I boiled the chicken breasts (3) and sautéed the onion and celery in a little bit of olive oil.  Very easy if you already have chicken cooked.
