My mother used to make a lemon sauce for gingerbread.  When I saw this recipe, I just had to try it.  I am so glad I did. This is a wonderful sauce for gingerbread! Thanks for the memories!

I had unexpected dinner guests the other night and needed a quick dessert. I had some Apricot Brandy Pound Cake (this site) in the freezer, but no ice cream or frozen topping. I had been intrigued with this recipe because of the nutmeg content, so I finally made it. I didn't have freshly grated, but used dried. It still came out wonderful. This sauce is soooo yummy. I know it would be great over ice cream, cake, bavarian cream, or whatever. You can make it as lemony as you want by increasing or decreasing the lemon juice.Thanks Ginger!

Just like my mom use to make!  I serve over bread pudding!  I didn't have a lemon so I used concentrated lemon juice and omitted the rind.  I'm sure it would be even more yummy with those ingredients!

This was so incredible!!! I served it with pound cake for a bridal shower, and it was definitely the hit of the party! Light, intensely lemony, not overpowering and not too rich. I did double the amount of lemon juice and peel. Fantastic!

Very nice and simple.  I prefer tart over sweet, so next time I would increase the lemon juice a little, and decrease the sugar (just by a TBS or two).  I used the zest and juice from one large lemon for this recipe.

Simply fantastic!  I served this over cheesecake at a wedding reception.  Everyone wanted the recipe and asked for seconds (and some thirds!).  Thanks for a great recipe.

I added twice the amt of nutmeg and twice the amt of butter... turned out great. But note that you have to cook down the water and sugar mix quite a bit to the consistency you want... will take time. Thanks

Delicious.  I also added a 1/4tsp cinnamon.  I didn't want quite such a transparent sauce so I added about 1/4c whipping cream to give the sauce more depth.  It's perfect, nice and creamy.  I made it to serve over Cheesecake Squares from this site.  I can see using this sauce for a multitude of dishes.  Thanks for your comments everyone and to Ginger P. for the recipe.

I made this to put over bread pudding, and it was delicious! I did leave out the nutmeg, because I am not a fan of it.

Very lemony flavour, very runny. Next time I will try 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and see how it goes.  Very easy to make. I used it over angel food cake. I also used regular nutmeg, will try fresh next time to see if it makes a difference. Not a very yellowy colour either but the zest looks pretty.

This was very good! I made a pumpkin/date square, topped it with a dollop of sweetened cream cheese, and drizzled with lemon sauce. It made a great fall dessert!

I just have to say thank you, thank you, thank you, Ginger.  This sauce was absolutely wonderful, I wouldn't change a thing.  It has the perfect balance of lemon so that it isn't overpowering.  I love lemon but some people like a more mild lemon flavor.  This is that sauce.  If you want it to have a stronger lemon taste then just add more lemon.  Also, I think the nutmeg really makes this sauce.l  I will only be using this lemon sauce recipe in the future.  I made it this evening to drizzle over my crepe recipe.  My kids, my husband, and I were blown away.  So simple, with a great flavor.  Thanks again!

Waaaaay back when I was working, one of my co-workers would bring in gingerbread with a lemon sauce on the side that was incredibly good.  I asked for the recipe and got put off until I realized she wasn't going to part with it!  Well, Ta Da, this one is as good as it gets!! Very similar to the one my co-worker made but IMHO, this one definitely has more flavor.  I served it over warm gingerbread and we loved it.  I have a bread pudding recipe on this site and very anxious to try it with that as others have mentioned.  Ginger, this recipe totally rocks!  Thank you for sharing!!

I was worried that it would not work well with the bread pudding i made but it actually made the dessert better.  It is a little tart and thin.

This sauce is so delicious! Didn't omit or add anything, I was leery about the nutmeg but oh it gave it a good flavor.I glazed a lemon poppyseed pound cake and the sauce complemented the cake nicely.

I followed recipe exactly and served over lemon cake; the nutmeg gives it an extra kick. I did think the sauce was a little runny, however, and I used a heaping tablespoon of cornstarch; next time I'd use more.

I never had this with nutmeg, but that adds a very nice familiar flavor. Kids ate it up quick!

Used this sauce to top Berry Bread Pudding and it was just the right amount of sweet/tart combination for the berries.  Would also be good atop gingerbread or a simple pound cake.  Very good -- thanks!

Loved it!! 
Left out the nutmeg, cause I didn’t have any. Used this sauce on top of a coconut custard pie. Everyone loved it. I will be using the recipe for many other kinds of cakes. Would be great drizzled on a blueberry coffee cake!

This is very similar to the recipe I've been using for years to make lemon sauce for gingerbread. I do increase the cornstarch to 2 Tbsp, and I make sure that I use at least 3 Tbsp of lemon juice -- if my lemon doesn't yield quite that much, I top it up with bottled. I make this in the microwave and it's pretty much perfect: a free-flowing, tart lemony sauce.

Very tangy.  I served it over lemon loaf .  It was a little thin so I added a little more corn starch to thicken it . I would make it again.

I loved the recipe but because of allergies and wanted it to be healthier I did make some changes. I only made half the recipe just to try it out first. I used all brown sugar. 1/4 c oil w/1/4 c of homemade Apple butter (applesauce can be substituted). To substitute eggs, 1/4 c  Apple butter and 1/4 c applesauce. I wanted to use the Apple butter to get more flavor. (1/4 c applesauce = 1 egg).  Like some of the other reviews I did increase the other seasonings by 1/2. I did use butter milk instead of water. I make my butter milk with almond milk and vinegar. The recipe made 6 mini bundt cakes. Delicious?? One of my pictures was cut short, so I did send in a second.

I adore this sauce.  I do change a few things, I add one egg yolk to give it a great "lemon" color.  I beat the egg yolk, then add little of the hot liquid to the egg yolk while whisking, then a little more to temper the yolk, then add it all back to the sauce.  I also double the amount of lemon and zest, I love lemon. If it doesn't thicken up after the addition of the yolk enough for you, you can always make a little slurry with more corn starch and water and add a little at a  time until it thickens up enough for your taste.

This sauce was a tiny bit thinner than I'd have liked, but it tasted perfect on some baked french toast with berries.  Since I don't like nutmeg all that well, I left it out and put in about half a teaspoon of finely minced fresh ginger with the lemon peel and butter.

Easy and very good! I was looking for a sauce for angel food cake and was going to make a lemon curd. Didn't want to deal with the egg, and then I found this recipe. I made a half version, using up a Meyer lemon and adding lemon juice concentrate for the rest. Per a reviewer's suggestion, I added a few big pieces of zest, and it will be easy just to take out later. I didn't care for the color, so I added one drop of yellow food coloring, and now it looks much better. This will be a great topping for many things (ice cream, bread pudding come to mind). Thanks for the simple recipe, GINGER P!

Extremely easy and tasty. I used 3 limes instead of lemons. I also added a pinch of cinnamon instead of nutmeg as I was using the sauce with a pineapple upside down cake which was cinnamony.

Great recipe for lemon sauce and so versatile because it can be used on other cakes and not just gingerbread.    If you are a lemon lover like us then you can add more zest.   We do cut back on sugar but that is our personal tastes.    Should be in everyone's file for ever and ever.

This is just like my Grandma made for warm gingerbread years and years ago.Now I made this recipe andI am going to stop looking!  It is the  best I have ever tried and I have been looking for a few years now!  Everyone loved it and said it tasted like it might have been served in Williamsburg during the Colonial period.  Thanks so much!

Lovely!  So easy to make.  Is wonderful on gingerbread, but I can think of lots of other uses for it, too!  I do make it without the lemon peel zest because my husband doesn't care for it, but I stick to the recipe otherwise.

Well I thought the taste was fine but this didn't turn out how I wanted.  I had to keep adding cornstarch and it was still runnier than I wanted.  I'll try another recipe next time.  But it tasted great so if you want a thin consistency, try this one.
