Better than I expected! 
Topped it off with a little parmesan cheese and used fettuccine noodles instead of spaghetti. 
Delicious! Thank you for the receipe.

Solid recipe.  Nice building spicy level.  Added more garlic but only because we LOVE garlic.  Quick, easy, good.  Ticks all 3 boxes for a weeknight dinner.

Tip: Be sure to stir regularly when on the IP saute function to avoid scorching.  Also, remove noodles from IP immediately when done for the same reason.  The bottom of that pot is hot!!

This was excellent as written! I was worried when I opened the IP to find so much liquid still left . I was sure it was going to end up  a big runny mess but 7 minutes on the saute mode and this thickened up perfectly. This recipe is full of flavor, super simple, and one of my favorite IP recipes so far. 5 stars all the way!

I made this tonight. I did not have green onion so I used regular onion. I also added mushrooms and a small sweet pepper because they needed to be used. The sauce is good. I saved this recipe so I can make it again.
