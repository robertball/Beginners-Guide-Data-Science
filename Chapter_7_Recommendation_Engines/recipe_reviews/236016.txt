Our family loved this!  Including my daughter who has no "heat" tolerance.  Most chilis without much kick are also without much taste!  Thankfully, this one has a rich flavor and is plenty meaty.  Next time I might even trim out some of the meat.  Great for a wintry afternoon!

This was a really great base recipe.  
When I realized it had no chili seasoning....per the original poster's note that his wife is allergic.
So, I added 1 1/2 tablespoons chili powder, 1 tsp cumin, and 1 tsp salt.  
I also sort of halved the recipe when I realized 4 cans of beans would make more than could fit in my crockpot...so 1 lb of beef, 1/2 an onion, 1 can of kidney beans, 1 can of black beans, 1 can of corn, and just two peppers..1 green, 1 red.  The rest of the ingredients remained the same.  And I added mushrooms cause they sounded good.
Turned out perfect.  A hit with everyone at the potluck. And I can't wait to eat up the leftovers.  Good stuff!!
