This is a great recipe but I have a few suggestions before starting on this recipe...
About the crust.....It's not a pie crust it's a modified cookie dough recipe so don't roll it out. After making the "crust", form it into a ball and place the ball in the middle of a SPRAYED pie pan, flatten and spread the cookie dough crust out and up the sides of the pan with your fingers, it will get sticky but instead of watering or oiling your fingers just lightly flour the surface of the dough. It also takes about 12-15 minutes for the crust to brown around the edges. Don't wait for the crust to get totally browned because when it cools it will crumble like an overbaked cookie.
For the glaze.....the cornstarch needs to be dissolved in cold water before being placed in the saucepan with the rest of the ingredients, so reserve 1/2 cup of the water needed in the glaze to dissolve the cornstarch in, then pour the cornstarch mixture in with the rest of the ingredients. Also, once the glaze comes to a boil reduce the heat to low. The glaze will thicken upon cooling. When ready to assemble the pie, you may need to reheat the glaze slightly to get it to pouring consistency.

This is a wonderful strawberry pie.  I did make a couple of changes though.  After baking the pie crust and cooling it I take 1/2 of an 8oz pkg. of cream cheese mixed with a tablespoon of powdered sugar and put that on the bottom of the crust before adding the strawberries.  Also, when making the "sweet syrup" I add about 2 or 3 tablespoons of lemon or lime juice (just enough to give it a little tart taste) and a 1/2 pkg. strawberry jello.  Very, very good.  thank you Pat for a wonderful recipe.

This was very good but pretty sweet.  I think next time I will cut back a little on the sugar or add a Tbsp. of lemon juice, as a previous reviewer recommended.  Also, it could use a little more crust.  I will probably increase the ingredients by 50%.  Also, it did not want to come out of the pan cleanly so the pieces were not very presentable.  Next time, I will give my pan a quick shot of spray oil.

I tried this recipe with one of the suggestions to add a little jello to the sauce.  Actually, I used a whole box and it works wonderfully.  I've also used this recipe as a template for making a peach variety using red and yellow food coloring and peach jello.  Absolutely wonderful!!!  Everyone who has had some of either version loved it and wants more!!!!  I'm going to try a tropical version next.

Best strawberry pie EVER! Everyone in my family loves it and I can never wait for the glazing to cool before the whole thing is my belly! If you can't make a homemade crust, or don't have the stuff to make it, I used the instant ones (usually 2 per package) but sometimes not as buttery or flakey. Great either way! YUMMMMM

WOW! I have to admit that when I decided to try this, I was making it for my kids and thought there was no way it would be better than my mother's strawberry pie. WOW! Was I wrong. We all really loved the taste and texture. I did double the amount of the glaze though so it would cover more of the strawberries. This is definitely what I'll be taking to family functions and work potlucks.

The crust was exceptionally good; the consistency of it is more like a cookie dough, but don't worry, it turns out great when baked! For a holiday pie, try using green food coloring!

I added 2 Tablespoons of strawberry Jell-O
to the recipe.  It made the strawberry flavor much richer!

This recipe is sooooo easy and so good.  I defrosted frozen stawberries and then mix them in with the gel.  Very good and very easy.  If I don't have red food coloring, I will omit that.

UPDATE: I ASKED MY MOM WHAT DESSERT SHE WANTED ME TO SERVE FOR HER BDY. SHE CHOSE THIS (SHE SAW IT IN THE FRIDGE ON SAT.)!!! SOOOO good! My "to be" MIL requested I bring a dessert for Easter dinner. B/c I was hosting myself (Sat. eve.), and had a LOT of stuff to to do for that, I wanted a dessert that required min. prep, but exceeded my expectations flavor-wise. This was just the ticket! I must admit.... I wasn't expecting much. After tasting the crust (a bit broke off!) & glaze, I wasn't impressed. HOWEVER, the irony of this recipe is the simplicity of ea. part - once asssembled, everything complements ea. other nicely. One other plus+.... The ing. for this are inexpensive, you probably have most on hand anyways & assembly is a snap! I made a few ch., not b/c they were necessary, but b/c I wanted to. :-) Instead of using a pie plate, I dbl. the crust & used my new tart pan. I had to bake a little longer b/c of that, prob. 20 min. total (a guess since I didn't time it). My only other ch. was to toss my strawberries w/ the glaze & then dump into my tart shell. I think next time I'll add some Jell-O as others have done. Handy tip: To easily hull your strawberries, use a STURDY straw. Simply push the straw up from the bottom thru the stem, and viola - instant hulled berries! My fiance's bros (who don't like sweets) HAD to have a slice when they saw how good this looked. Both licked their plates clean!!! Try this with a dollop of whipped cream. It's divine! Thx. for sharing. :-)

Delicious filling. I didn't make the crust, I just made a regular pie crust instead. The filling is great because the Jello gives the filling an extra strawberry kick. The amount of cornstarch is just right so the filling isn't soupy, yet it's not rubbery-firm either. The only modification I made was to add a tablespoon of lemon juice for some contrast to the sweetness. This is my go-to recipe, it's so easy (especially if you use a pre-made pie crust).

I absolutely loved this recipe.  It was very simple to make and turned out very well.  The crust was delicious.  I actually made a little extra crust because I love a good crust in a pie.  Will certainly make this pie again...and will use the crust recipe for other pies!  Thanks!

I followed another reviewer's advice to put a layer of cream cheese mixed with a little powdered sugar on the crust before adding the strawberries. Delicious! It made it taste like cheesecake! We liked this much better than the Jell-o variety.

I really liked it. I left out the food coloring and the clear look was okay. Just less red, so I deem it unnecessary for the pie. Unfortunately the crust sunk, which was pretty disappointing. Aside from that it was really good. I would make it again.

Amazing! I made it for my friend's birthday and she could not believe I made it. The crust came out to be cookie-like and she was so in love with it (as was I). I'm pretty surprised at how good it really is even though it was so simple to make! Thank you Pat Collins!

Great and east!!! My daughter, who was skeptical, loved it!  Only problem was that the crust stuck to the pan, I used a stoneware pie dish, guess I should have greased it.  I baked the crust for 14 minutes.  Some reviews said the syrup did not thicken , I followed the recipe exactly and it thickened great.  I always dissolve the cornstarch with some of the water called for in the recipe before adding it with the other ingredients to make sure it mixes completely. I added the food dye after it thickened.  At first, when I tasted the syrup after it thickened, I thought it was sweet, but not what I wanted for the pie.  However, after pouring it over the berries in the crust, refrigerating the pie, and then serving, it was perfect.  I thought it was the perfect amount of syrup/glaze for the pie, I used 2 quarts of berries ( the size one larger than the pint- think that is a quart), hulled the berries, and laid the berries on their side with the point of each berrie going into the hole where the next berry was hulled.  This packed them in, and then had a few extra to stand upright on top.   The crust was great for this pie.  Definately will make again, so easy and good!

Did not seem like enough glaze. Pie ended up soggy (could of been my fault). It was tasty though. I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

I especially liked this crust since pastry making is not something I do well.  DGV's suggestion of making a ball of the dough and spreading it in a sprayed pan was a big help!  Mine did stick some but more spray and less pressure will probably help next time.  I also used my KitchenAid mixer with the white beater to mix the dough (the dough hook would probably work great but didn't know where it was, since I don't do pastries:-)  Next time, think I will add some finely chopped pecans or almonds to the crust.  My filling was a little runny but my strawberries were just past their peak.  Probably adding a little strawberry jello as others suggested would help, but didn't have any.  I used drops of red coloring until the color suited me, maybe 6.  All in all, a good pie and a 'homemade' crust that even I wouldn't be afraid to take to a potluck.  Will try the crust for other pies as well.

This is hands down the BEST fruit pie crust.  I have used this with strawberry, blueberry and even lemon pie.  Any recipe that needs a sweet baked crust this is the one that I will go with.  Everybody who tries it demands that I give them the recipe.  It is so crisp, quite like shortbread.  And EASY!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.

This was a good tasting dessert. I used butter instead of margarine for the crust, and forgot the vanilla extract, and it still tasted excellent. I think I overcooked the glaze; it turned out really gloppy on the strawberries. I think next time I make this I'll toss the strawberries in the glaze first before putting the strawberries in the pie shell, which will make for an even coating of glaze. And indeed, as others have said the crust is what makes this dessert special.

Hi! I have made this recipe now about 4 times.  When I get in a hurry, I just use a graham cracker crust. My husband now asks me to make another one. It's the best! Thanks

Should the margarine be cold and cut in, or softened and mixed in completely? Who knows? It doesn't say to grease the pie pan, even though it's absolutely necessary. I greased mine per reviews and it still stuck to it completely in several spots. It is impossible to pull an intact "piece" of pie out of the pan using this crust. And, as most reviewers have mentioned, it bakes not in 8-10 minutes but takes nearly 20 minutes to lightly brown. Once you get the crust out of the pan in its little tiny crumbs and pieces, you realize this dessert is better served in a bowl rather than on a plate, as a kind of strawberry jell with shortbread crumbles mixed in. While tasty, the fact it can't be served in wedges makes it in no way a "pie." The strawberry-jell mixture is tasty and pretty much the same thing you'll find in any strawberry pie recipe, such as in my Betty Crocker cookbook. However, it's impossible to "pour" the cooled jell over the strawberries because it has...cooled, and thickened. Do what another reviewer said and mix the berries with the jell before putting into the crust. I had been hoping to find an easy, non-pastry crust for chilled pies for those times I don't want to go to the hassle of pastry. This is not the crust I was looking for.

My big guy and I loved this! The crust was great, I didnt have any problems with it. I did use butter instead of marg., though. I quartered my strawberries, too and mixed them in well with the sugar combo. before adding to pie crust.

This pie is delicious!  I did not make the crust, used a store bought frozen one, and still everyone raved about this pie.  I will make again for sure!

I am cheating and just reviewing the crust. I made it to go with a coconut cream pie. It was great. A slight hint of powdered sugar. I suspect it would be even better with a fruit pie like this. I put it with a coconut cream pie with whipped topping, which was already really sweet and this made it even sweeter, almost too sweet. The only downside is the crust crumbled when I took it out of the pie plate. If you don't care about presentation and taste is everything, then you will LOVE this crust!

5 stars for the crust! Simple and easy to make. 0 stars for the glaze - it's too think, syrupy, and sweet. I even used more strawberries than a quart. It really ruined the flavour of the strawberries. I will try again with a different fruit filling, like the Strawberry Pie II filling previously suggested.

This is one of the BEST strawberry pies I've ever made.  It's SO simple you can make the whole thing in under 20 minutes.  My crust I baked for about 12-13 minutes, it never really went brown though but that was cooked well enough.  A big tip for the glaze is make sure you mix the sugar and corn starch together FIRST, then add the water.  The first time I made this I just threw it all in the sauce pan, but when the corn starch mixes with the water it doesn't always break down so there were a bunch of white chunks, mixing it first eliminated this completely.  I also poured the glaze over the strawberries almost immediately after boiling for 5 minutes.  When you let it cool it gets very thick and globby but when its boiling it pours very easily in between the berries and then hardens into a gel.  I used a 10 inch pan but another thing I ended up doing was making almost another half batch of the glaze since I didn't find that the original amount was enough.  Next time I make this I'm going to make individual pies because when you cut this is falls apart.  Would be amazing to serve at a dinner and give everyone their own little pie. This is an amazing recipe, try it!

I got excellent reviews on this pie! I myself found it a little sweet, but my roommates loved it! I would suggest adding some lemon juice to the pastry to make it a little less sweet. I couldn't have eaten more than one piece without my teeth hurting. It's great with whipped cream!

The taste isn't bad, but first you have to make. Not a recipe for the beginner cooks!  The direction are very, very vague. Good luck to anyone who attemps this recipe. Allrecipe.com should be watchful to the recipes they post.

the crust is wonderful, holds up tot he strawberry goo very well. The flavor of this pie is great, but could use a little more cornstarch. The pie looked great until I cut it. Turned into bowls of goo and whipped cream. I will try this pie again with more cornstarch

I made this recipe for Easter yesterday and loved it! I made it as written but when pressing the crust into a 9 inch pie plate there was not enough to bring it up the sides so I made another 1/2 batch and that worked great but had to cook it a little longer. Thanks for the great recipe!

I only used the recipe for this crust but for the filling i used the strawberry glazed pie recipe. This crust is really good its basically a shortbread crust and just melts in your mouth. next time i might add a tablespoon of powdered sugar cuz i'd like it more sweet; i have a sweet tooth.

I have never given any recipe on here a rating this low. The crust did not stay together and you couldn't even really taste it. That is if you could get it out of the pan in one piece!I gave 2 stars because the pie looked wonderful. The strawberries were excellent, but nothing worth trying again. will keep looking for a better recipe.

Wonderful! I did follow a bunch of other reviewers' suggestions and added lemon juice to the gel, turning the heat down as soon as it reaches a boil.
I used freshly picked local strawberries. I will definitely be trying this with other seasonal fruit this summer (blueberries, peaches).

This pie was easy and very good.  I already had a crust, so I did not use the crust on this recipe.  The strawberry filling was very good as is.  I would suggest to the people that thought it had no flavor to get home grown berries, not berries from a grocery store.  The flavor of the berry is what makes the pie!!

I made this for my husband's birthday and he said it was "luscious."  That's a high compliment coming from him.  I used fresh strawberries and put 1/2 pkg. sugar-free strawberry jello in with the glaze mixture because I was out of red food coloring.  The crust is fantastic.  Goes really well with the strawberries.  Topped with Cool Whip, this is a refreshing summer dessert.

I'm sorry, but I just didn't like this.  My husband (who is really easy to please) said it just tasted like strawberries with jell on top.  I must have done something wrong since it's gotten such great reviews from others.  I will not even bother to make this again though.  Good luck!

love the crust! followed the recipe and the crust came out brilliant. had to bake it for more than 15 mins though. *** greased and dusted the pan with a lil flour so the pie slid off the pan perfect. i did my pie with 1/2 strawberries and 1/2 cherries. great combo. except next time i would use more berries and less gel ;)

I have tried this pie 3 time is the past week.  I have followed others suggestions, but still can't get it to turn out.  It always taste great, but never looks the best.  The first time the filling did not thicken & I did not grease my pan so it stuck.  The second time my sauce turned out great, but I greased my pan & the crust slid down & formed a big cookie.  I through the filling in  a store bought crust.  I seem to have the filling down( I use the kool aid for color & sweetness) but the crust mever seems to fit all the way up the sides of the pie pan.  The taste is awesome.  Just wish I could get the crust down.

YUMMY! I love the crust and will try it with other recipes.  I just sprayed the bottom of the glass pie plate and had no trouble with sticking or sides sliding down. I found the syrup sweet enough, and I used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 splenda. Will definitely make again!

I've made this pie twice in the past week!  It's wonderful!  I quartered my strawberries because I like the texture better than just big strawberries and gel, I would use 2 1/2 cups of quartered strawberries and instead of pouring the gel over them I would first mix the strawberries and gel, then pour them into the crust to get everything more evenly set. LOVED the crust, so easy and tastey.  I used glass pie dishes and sprayed them with nonstick baking spray and there was no sticking with the crust, which really surprised me because I always have trouble with the crust sticking on other recipes.  Husband loved it too, I'm sure I'll be making this again next time we have strawberries in the hosue.  I wonder if you could do this with blueberries and blue food coloring...sounds like it might work!

I used my own pie crust recipe, and used this "simple syrup" method but but instead of just food coloring I added a pkt. of strawberry flavored Kool-Aid.  It was delicious and gorgeous.  Some had mentioned that it wasn't sweet enough, but the Kool-Aid certainly took care of that.  I also added about 1/4 cup more sugar and would probably just stick with the amount called for in the recipe, it was REALLY sweet but so good. I'm going to cut back the amount of cornstarch next time as it seemed a little too coagulated.  My three boys and husband loved it as well.  Took some pictures as this was one of the prettiest pies I've ever made.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  I knew a lot of recipes call for gelatin and I was out so this was perfect.  As many changed as I made, I still give it a 5 star rating.

I made this with my 4 1/2 year old daughter. Very easy and very yummy - everyone loved. I sprayed a little non-stick spray on my pie pan before baking the crust, and had no problems with the crust sticking like some other people mentioned. Will make again for company!!!

I used this recipe for the crust and was not very pleased.  Instead of forming a side crust on the pie plate, it slid down during baking and was like a large cookie at the bottom of the pan.

This is an excellent pie!  We picked up a good-sized basket of fresh stawberries from the farmer's market and were looking for some recipes to try.  Glad we tried this one.  Just a note - I had make up some extra glaze since I didn't have enough.

The crust on this pie is delicious.  However, when baking the crust it didn't brown in the 8-10 minutes suggested.   It just needs to be baked a little longer. 
Next time I might use a little less cornstarch in the glaze.  It was a little thick for my taste. 
Overall, it was great with a big dollop of whipped cream.

This is my third time looking for this recipe.  Each time I make it, I fall in love with it again. So simple, and a great way to use the large boxes of strawberries I buy in the spring and summer.

This was very good, but I give it *** because as written it didn't thicken enough so I removed some of the juice and mixed 2 more tablespoons of cornstarch in it then added it back to the saucepan.  My total boiling time was approximately 7 - 8 minutes.  The crust is very good but a little difficult to work with because it sticks to your hands.  I finally cleaned and dried my hands and rubbed them with a little butter to help with the sticking problem.  You have to work to get this crust 'molded' in your pan, but I believe it is worth the time.  If the recipe had worked for me as written, I would have definitely considered *****.  Thank you, Pat.

I used the crust from this pie and used the filling from Marge koriakin's Strawberry Pie II.  It was W-O-N-D-E-R-F-U-L-!!! The pie crust is very easy to make, but mine turned out a bit gritty and took a little longer than 10 minutes to bake.  All in all it was a wonderful crust.  Will definetly be making this one again.

Not bad.  The thing I found about it is that It didn't make enough sauce for the berries and the sauce gelled quickly as it cooled so it was hard to "pour over".  I took advice and greesed the pan.  Also I found the dough a little frustrating to work with. Never know, I might make it again.

So simple and so delicious.  I might use a little less margarin or a little more flour for the crust next time.  I had it nicely pressed up the sides of the pie plate but after It baked it melted to the bottom...it still tasted fantastic, I just had to bake the crust a little longer!!

I made this recipe for a party, and everyone LOVED it. It is a really great way to take advantage of the season when you can get the large flats of strawberries. It was very easy to make, and kind to the "pastry challenged". It's sweet enough for the kids to like, but not so much so that adults will hate it.

The strawberries add extra juice, so i think it is better if you use less water in the glaze/filling.

The flavor of this recipe is almost exactly as I remember.  Big Boy strawberry pie was my child hood favorite.  I had a bit of a problem with the crust.  I felt that the directions were not clear.  I wasn't sure if I was suppose to roll it or just dump the mixture in the pie plate and press it in.  My crust did stick to the pan. Over all the flavor was excellent and my 10 year old said that the pie was "better than a slurpy."  That is a huge success.

This is my go to strawberry recipe. I've made it several times and it comes out absolutely delicious every time. I follow the reviews and add to it and listen to others suggestions. I did attempt the cream cheese spread and had problems so skipped trying that. The crust has to be mashed into the pan. Kind of a cookie crust :)

Best strawberry pie I've ever had and I don't have a big sweet tooth.  Made it for my husband but cut the sugar by half (for me).  It turned out wonderfully with a perfect flakiness to the crust.  Thank you for such a simple and delicious fresh pie recipe!

Our favorite summer treat.  The crust is like a sugar cookie.  Best made and served on the same day.  Don't cook the filling too long or it gels up into big goopy mess.  Cooked correctly, you will get many requests for recipe at your next potluck.

I can only rate the crust, for taste I would rate it much higher, but it didn't bake well for me. I baked it for longer than written and sprayed my dish, poked holes, etc - and the sides slipped down, making it mostly slip to the bottom. Maybe cooking spray is not needed here, I will try the recipe again, since I love the taste & don't love traditional pie crust as much. I used the Strawberry Pie II recipe for the filling (which was great!) -

I made this recipe when strawberries were sadly out of season and I used frozen berries.  The crust was very yummy and I think with fresh berries, this would be even better.  I plan to make another attempt soon!

Sorry, but this turned out very runny!  The crust tasted OK, but I agree with others that it was almost cookie-like.  I followed the recipe exactly and even though it tasted fine, it looked horrible!  I will probably not try this one again.

Good recipe, great crust.  This is my new favorite crust, but my oven took a bit longer to bake, like others said.

I made this one evening and it was gone in a flash.  All I got was one little piece :-(  But that piece was wonderful and apparantly everyone else in my household thought so too.  Will definitely be keeping this on my list of favorites.

This was really good, and SO easy.  I was a little wary because of the weird gelatine thing, but this was actually really good.  It is not gourmet, but really good and VERY easy!  I am giving it five stars for how easy and tasty it is.

Excellent pie!!!  Used whole frozen strawberries that I defrosted, drained, cut into halves and sprinkled an 1/8 th cup of sugar over them.  Added a total of 3 tablespoons cornstarch into the cup of water and then added the sugar, salt and food coloring.  When the glaze was cool I gently mixed the strawberries into the glaze and then filled my own pie crust.  This pie set up beautifully over night.  No drips or runs!!!

I had never made a pie before and made this one. It came out perfect! It was so easy and very good. Next time I will try using butter instead of margerine for the crust.

I used the glazed berry portion of this recipe, but haven't tried the crust.  The glaze was simple to make, and came out almost exactly as I had hoped it would.  It wasn't sweet enough for my liking though.  For me it definitely needs more sugar.  A good summer recipe though when you have plenty of strawberries on hand.

The taste of this crust was nice, however, mine like others, stuck in the pan.  I even greased the dish first but it was almost impossible to get out of the pan.  The sauce was okay, it tasted very sweet and a lot like vanilla; I think it needed something for a bit of tartness, or maybe leave out the vanilla?

Very good recipe...however, please be sure to spray your pie plate with nonstick spray to ease the pie out of the dish.  Also, great is 1 cup heavy whipping cream beat together with 1/4 cup of sugar to add to this wonderful pie.

This is a wonderful strawberry pie. The fact that the fruit don't need to be cooked gives it the real flavour of the strawberries. I didn't have any problem with the cookie crust, but I mixed the sugar and cornstarch in the saucepan before adding water; this way, 5 minutes from boiling point was the perfect time. Pressing the dough evenly in the pan was what took me the more time!!!

This was fantastic.I used the prev tip about sprinkling flour over the dough and it worked a treat because it is VERY VERY STICKY. I only used 1/2 cup sugar because of prev suggestions of the syrup being too sweet. It was perfect and my husband (who after 10 years informed me he didn't like strawberries) loved it and has asked for it every night - not very likely. Thank you so much Pat.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It turned out 100% too sweet and syrupy. I was hoping for something more like a fruit tart, but its sweeter than any fruit pie I've ever had. I even added several tablespoons of lime juice because of what other reviewers had written. Also, I added 1/4 box of lemon jello because I was worried about the sauce thickening properly as most reviewers noted trouble with this. I'm glad I did that. I would never try this recipe again.

I have made this recipe two times so far. The first time I made it was amazing. The filling thickened right up once it cooled, it wasn't drippy and it was so flavorful. The second time I made it I had a little trouble with it thickening. I am going to assume it was my fault and reccomend this recipe quite highly. I already sent my sister the recipe.

After I made the syrup I tasted it and it was a little sour.  I was afraid my guests wouldn't like it but I added fresh strawberries and whipped cream which kind of made a perfect blend!  All said it was really good.  Did have trouble getting the crust to stay up on the sides of the pie pan.

The "syrup" that the strawberries are poured into didn't have much flavor.  It would be better if it had a strawberry flavor to it as well.

Best strawberry pie I ever ate!  The only thing I would do differently is spray my pie plate with non-stick cooking spray before pressing  in the crust.  My crust stuck to the pie plate but boy was it delicious!

This pie was pretty good, but after the first day in the refrigerator it was very liquidy.  I must have cooked the crust a little too long because it was pretty crunchy. I would probably try another recipe before using this one again.  It was very simple to prepare though.

I too tried strawberry gelatin in place of the food coloring. It added just enough sweetness that would not have been there otherwise. The substitution of almond extract is a nice touch as well. This would be a fun recipe to play around with- such as adding crushed pineapple with the strawberries, for  example. Good effort, Big Guy!

I was searching for an excellent strawberry pie and have found it. This was a hit with all who tried it and kids loved it. The crumb-topped crust really puts this pie above others.

I like the crust, but the cornstarch sauce didn't really complement strawberries as it was supposed to be...

I have served this at Church Functions as well as at home and have had nothing but "raves". For those in Canada, people have said it is even better than the Strawberry Pie served at the White Spot Restruants. the instructions for the crust took a little figuring out that you just needed to pat it into the pie pan rather than rolling it out but the rest was easy to do  Looks absoltuely beautiful also.

This pie takes only a few minute to make, it's incredibly easy and tastes great.  There's no crust to roll out which saves enourmous amounts of time!! This is a very simple tasting pie, serving it with whipped cream is a must!  This is also a great one for dieters who only want to eat the filling and leave the fatty crust aside!!

Not bad but I believe it probably would be better with a sweeter glaze like someone else mentioned adding Jello.  A layer of a sweetened cream cheese filling under the glaze & berries might jazz it up also.

One improvement on this recipe is to put it in a shortbread crust.  Made with 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup margarine and 5 1/2 TBLS powdered sugar - pressed into a 9 inch pie plate and baked for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.

I have tried several recipes for Strawberry Pie and have not yet found one that is this easy or tasty.  I tried the canned saufce but I do not like it and was hoping there was a recipe that was made from scratch.

I thank you very much for this one.
