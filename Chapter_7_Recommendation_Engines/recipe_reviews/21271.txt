These were pretty good. i'm rating it a 3 for the original recipe because i altered it when it didnt quite work for me. i found when the bananas were sliced they stuck to the top of the waffle iron. The next time i made them i mashed the bananas and put them in the batter. This worked much better and they tasted very good!i've made them this way many times now!

These were so yummy!  I mashed the bananas a bit and then added them to the batter so there was chunky banana mush in there.  I also added a little cinnamon.  Spraying the waffle iron with non-stick spray first was a must!  I would definitely make these again.

Although the recipe only made 3 waffles on my large belgian-waffle maker instead of 4, I was very pleased with the taste. This recipe is also more nutritious than most waffle recipes, considering only one egg is used. Considering I'm a banana lover, this recipe gets an A+!

THANK YOU!! This is a good waffle recipe. My toddler is allergic to eggs, so I made it substituting the egg with 2 tbs oil and 1 tsp baking powder. Tastes great. We ate them with maple syrup. Maybe next time I'll add some sugar for a little more sweetness.

Makes great Waffles.  Instead of slicing the bananas I mashed them up and mixed them in.  I also added some oil to the mix to make it nonstick.  My whole family loved them.

A good recipe. We added chopped walnuts, and substituted regular milk with vanilla soymilk.  We also slightly mashed out bananas into the mix.  Texture was good, and outside crunchy. We didn't have to add any extra milk as other reviewers have had to. I didn't think it was earth shaking, but it was good, and we'd make it again.  All my kids asked for seconds.

Simple and satisfying! I added some cinnamon and a little more nutmeg for an excellent flavor. Also, I am a huge banana fan, and thought that only 2 banana slices per pancake was a little cheap, so I put 3 or 4 in each pancake. It was great!

These were the absolute worst waffles I've ever had! I do not recomend this reciepe at all. I think it would worked better if I would have used waffle mix, instead of all purpose flour, and baking mix. Again..I do not recomend this reciepe at all.

My husband devoured these! I used whole wheat flour to make them a little heartier and mashed the bananas instead of slicing them, to prevent from sticking to the waffle iron. I also added a teaspoon of brown sugar for flavor. The recipe made 5 waffles in total.

These waffles were easy and quick to make with the bananas mixed in with the dough. I used almond milk instead of the regular and 2 tbsp of oil for non-stick properties. The waffles are mildly sweet and have room for extra spices of your choice. They come out crispy on the outside, and soft with some specks of bananas on the inside. I've got 4 and a half waffles with this recipe. Since I have to use natural sweeteners for my son, these waffles are perfect. I will be making these again. Thanks!

Absolutely awesome, would reccommend to anyone, make sure you have a good waffle iron, as any recipe is not guaranteed without a good iron.

I tried to make these for a brunch party this morning and stupidly didn't do a test run in advance.  I followed the recipe's suggestion to simply put the banana slices between two layers of batter.  The banana heated too much and began to steam and force batter out of the waffle iron, and prevented the batter from bonding top to bottom.  The result was a two-part, sticky mess that could not pass at all forr a waffle.  In the end, I gave up and made pancakes with the batter and served the bananas over them.  Overall, the batter was a decent recipe and the technique instructions were a failure.

This was my first attempt at waffles so any imperfections I contribute to my lack of skill and not the recipe. Like others I mashed the bananas and added cinnamon. I also added two tablespoons of sugar. The battered looked a little thin so I added 1/4 cup of flour but next time I will stick to the recipe. I think they would be crispier.

I think that this is a pretty good recipe.  I have a toddler who loves waffles, but because I don't give him syrup, I try to find ways to change them up for him...he loves bananas, so this was a perfect treat for him.  I did cheat a bit though, I used premixed pancake batter (you know, the one where you just add water). ;-p

very wonderful! I took the advice from others and mashed my bananas, added cinnamon and of course sprayed my waffle maker with cooking spray. I think I may add some toasted chopped walnuts or pecans next time to add a bit more texture. Also to make them a bit heartier, I used 3/4 cup white flour with 1/2 cup wheat flour. My 3 year old asked me to make these every day. :-)

Makes a yummy waffle, but I only got 3 mini-sized (little more than a 1/2 cup scoop of batter) waffles instead of 4.  I mashed the bananas and mixed them in with the batter, as opposed to putting in slices.  I used light vanilla silk since I was out of regular milk, and I also added 2 tbs of brown sugar to the recipe to give it a little sweetness.  I found that it took 2 1/2 to 3 minutes on my electric griddle.

Great recipe, I prefer to make a large batch and freeze the rest.  I tripled the size, used mashed bananas and added 2 cups raisins.  After having them for dinner and breakfast, we only had 1 left to freeze.

I mashed the banana and added it directly to the batter. Made a double batch to freeze some for easy breakfasts. Next time I will add a little sugar as I prefer a little bit of a sweeter waffle so I can toast them an go without adding syrup, etc. Nice recipe.

These came out perfectly!! I followed it nearly to the T minus some healthier substitutes. Vanilla soy milk and egg beaters and strawberries, since we were out of bananas!! I also folded the strawberries into the mix and they came out perfectly will definitely make again.

Tasty--we did mash the bananas in.  Also swapped in 1/4 cup whole wheat flour to add a little extra flavor.  For us it made 5 round waffles.  Next time may add a bit of salt.

I had a hard time with the waffles not sticking to the waffle iron, even when I liberally sprayed with cooking spray.  The batter was okay and I'm sure that it worked well for others, but it just wasn't what I wanted.

I personally liked them, alot! I had to double the recipe, although it turns out I really didn't. This was the first time I ever made waffles with a waffle maker, and the waffles turned out rather very brown. I figured this was the result of mashing the bananas, rather than slicing them.

The waffles come out crispy at first, but in the process of keeping them warm, they soften. In my last batch, I added Vanilla Extract, cinnamon, cloves, and more nutmeg. This made the waffles better!

This reciped needed fat content, so I added a generous TBSP of butter and that did the trick. I also replaced 1/4 cup of the flour with oats, making the waffles healthier and crunchier.  The bananas can also be cut or mashed into the batter while it is still in the bowl.

Added cinnamon, sugar, more nutmeg and mashed up the bananas, then added to the mix. Had to pry a bit but they came out fine. Made a couple with chocolate chips added as well. The taste was good but the appearance was kind of blah. Overall, I would make again.

My little girl was sick and didn't want anything to eat until we mentioned banana waffles. I doubled the recipe and left out the nutmeg (I think a dash of cinnamon would be good as well). I also mashed up the bananas and stirred them into the batter. My son and I loved ours smothered in peanut butter and syrup.  Thanks for sharing this really yummy recipe.

The taste was good, but I had a lot of problems getting them to cook all the way through without burning. If I took them out when they where a (dark) golden brown, they were undercooked in the middle and made it seem like I was chewing a banana flavored sponge. The only ones that were cooked all the way through were burnt on the outside.
I also had a big problem with them sticking to the waffle iron. Both issues I've never had before.
Was really looking forward to this recipe, but ended up being disappointed. :(

I double this recipe because I have three hungry children in the morning and also freeze a lot of breakfast breads for later snacking and travel. So I mixed everything up and added pumpkin spice, brown sugar and cinnamon and a touch of vanilla... Started my batch and noticed, even when baked a couple cycles the insides were still gooey, so I ended up adding some whole wheat pancake mix to thicken it up. That did the trick, they were fluffier and cooked all the way thru. Over all I think this is a good start to a waffle recipe, but needs to be tweeked for anyone who needs to have fluffy waffles!!!

The flavor is great, the execution is flawed. I followed the recipe instructions for putting sliced bananas between dollops of batter, and I will be spending my evening cleaning my burnt waffle iron :( However, the flavor was great and they rose beautifully, so I can't complain too much. Thanks for the recipe!

These are very good they taste a lot like banana bread and I mashed the bananas then put them into the batter and mixed them in instead of just chunks in your waffle.

Excellent, although I didn't try as is.  Like others I mashed the bananas, but I mixed them with the eggs separately from the batter (which I used 1 and 1/4 c of pancake mix in place of the flour and baking powder).  Cooked mine for about five minutes each until golden brown on one side.  Delish!

Very good waffles! However, I mashed up the bananas and then added them to the batter; I don't think the flavor would carry if they were left sliced. Great with peanut butter or syrup. Suggest adding walnuts for a banana nut waffle. Also good with whole wheat flour, and better for you!

Add Walnuts and also cur the banana into pieces and mixed in with two egg whites instead of one egg, and whole wheat flour. Made some strawberry syrup by modifying the recipe on this site with orange juice/zest and some cornstarch. Turned out really good.

These were delicious and easy for a Saturday morning breakfast! I followed other reviewers suggestions and mashed up the bananas and added them to the batter. I think that a 3rd banana could be used for extra banana goodness. I used nonstick spray to make sure they wouldn't stick, but really liked that this recipe didn't use oil or sugar. I added 1tsp of cinnamon, upped the nutmeg to 1/4tsp, and served with butter spread and just a touch of warm maple syrup. My husband and toddler son couldn't get enough of them- this one's a keeper!

I use this recipe as a starting point.  Sub half wheat flour.  Add 1/2 to 1 extra banana, smashing 1 and slicing the rest.  Add cinnamon, add about 1tbsp on brown sugar, and add nuts.  This has become a staple weekend breakfast for us.

I'm a little tired of making banana muffins for my little guy, so I decided to try banana waffles. I mashed up the bananas after reading other reviews (actually, my 2 year old did), but other than that followed the recipe. I doubled it, because I make waffles to freeze them for breakfasts for him(waffles go in the car easily!). Turned out great, and my son and husband LOVED them!

Ahhhhhh. Ok, I didn't exactly follow the recipe - I followed others' advice and mashed the bananas and added them to the waffle batter. BUT, I think it would have turned out worse if I had sliced the bananas and layered them in like the recipe calls for. The batter was so insanely thick. It came apart in the waffle iron, and I had to scrap it out. I thought, maybe I'll add oil..more scrapping. Well, maybe it needs a little more milk...more scrapping...maybe another egg to hold it together...scrapping. More milk? Scrapping. Mind you, I oiled the waffle iron between each attempt. In the end, the batter was much more like traditional waffle batter, with almost 2 cups of milk, and another egg, and maybe 3-4 tbsp of oil. Still it did not work. HOWEVER, the altered batter did make incredible pancakes!!! So, if I do this again, I think I'll just make the pancakes (though, I am tempted to try the original recipe with the layering, just in case it works because it is a much healthier batter). Thank you for ultimately giving me a great banana pancake recipe, at least :)

Just made these waffles for brunch - I had leftover bananas, so went looking for a recipe. I mashed the bananas, added the milk and egg to them, then 1 tbsp sugar and finally the flour mixture with 1/4 tsp cinnamon as well as the nutmeg and 1/4 cup of chopped pecans. I have a Belgian waffle maker, and the first waffle was soggy (as I think about it - mashing the banana would not help!). So I then sprayed the waffle maker (even though it is a non-stick variety) and added 1/2 cup more of flour to the remaining batter - so the first waffle I discarded, but after the extra flour and spraying the waffle maker, the result was very good and made 3 good sized waffles. Remove as soon as cooked as they overcook easily. I'll add 2/3+ cup of flour to the full recipe next time I make them Loved the banana nut flavour.

Thanks for sharing.

I wasn't really impressed by these - they were overwhelmingly banana flavored (yes, I know they were banana waffles) and I thought they really could use another flavor to compliment the bananas.  I did change the recipe by dicing the bananas and mixing it all together as well as cooking them on a Belgian waffle maker that makes letter and number blocks.  Maybe if I try them again I'll add mini chocolate chips and chopped nuts - then it would be more banana bread flavored.  Thanks anyway!

Pretty good - wasn't a fan of the chunks of banana int eh first batch I made so second time I mashed up the banana and it was better.  Added a little cinnamon and then poured a little chocolate sauce over them for the kids for a treat and they loved them.

These stuck to my waffle iron and we really couldn't eat them. I gave them three stars because I did try a small piece and the overall taste is okay. Next time I will try using a banana extract.

my family like the recipe very nicely I added pecans  to the batter  which gave it a nice crunch. i specialy enjoy  not having to add sugar to the mix. If you like bananas you will enjoy this recipe.

Made as-is, the waffles were doughy and mushy and slightly bitter.  I added nearly another 1/2 cup of flower and 1/8 cup sugar, restirred it up, and tried again.... then they tasted good although they still were too soft for our liking once done.  I had to put them in the toaster before serving.

these were ok but I like waffles that are krisp on the outside and moist on the inside, these were moist but didn't have the crisp outside. the taste was good. I mashed the bananas into the mix and added a 1/2 tsp sugar and used 1/2 tsp vanilla. I will stick with Banana Pancakes and regular waffles.

This is one of the best waffles that my wife and I have ever had! Very easy to put together and great texture. I took the advice from another who mashed the bananas and mixed with the batter.
I will give this 5 star rating after adding melted butter to help with sticking in the iron add to the flavor!

Made these waffles for my daughter and I for breakfast today. We both thoroughly enjoyed them and will definitely make them again. I added a teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon to the batter only because we both love the flavors.

I made the recipe as is, and I would rate it 3 stars.  I made them again with the following changes: I mashed the bananas and mixed them into the batter, I added a tablespoon of sugar and a half a teaspoon of cinnamon for flavor, and I used soy milk because I like the flavor.   I added just a little more milk than it called for, and this made 4 full waffles instead of 3 3/4 from the original recipe. I have made them several times now with the changes and I love them!  I always make extra and freeze the leftovers for quick breakfasts.

I mashed the banana like some reviewers suggested.  I like them, but they are sort of soft and I think next time I'll put a little bit of sugar in the batter.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Used the Foreman waffle plates -6 or 7 min and awesome...not as crisp as I'd like, but that could be the grill.  I also used half whole wheat flour.

Delicious waffles...and easily customizable. I tripled this recipe, adding 1 tsp of nutmeg and 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Also mashed the bananas--using five large ripe ones when tripled. Added a little canola oil, as well as separated yolks from whites, whipping whites into creamy froth before adding to mixture. We cook in waffle iron for 3 minutes. Delicious--and excellent for reheating for school-morning breakfasts.

Delicious!  I substituted 1/4 cup of the flour with oat bran, used whole wheat flour instead of white, added a couple of tablespoons of ground flax seed, and used 3 small mashed bananas.  Perfect consistency, nice and sweet.  Whole family loved them!

This recipe was very good. I followed everyone else and mashed the bananas, I added some cinnamon to taste and not necessary, but I also added couple tablespoons of sugar (I have a relentless sweet-tooth) Will be making these again. I think this will be a great base recipe for other fruits too.

Made these for breakfast . . .very good!  I, too, mashed the bananas  a bit and put them in the batter.  I'm not awake enough in the morning to layer like the recipe stated!  Plus, I'm not that exacting a cook . . . .the ingredients are great, though, it's  a good combo.  I'm not a huge fan of waffles or pancakes in general and usually make them bc bf is, but I really liked these.  I wanted to add cinnamon but I didn't and they were still great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good. I didn't have all the ingredients for my favorite whole wheat banana pecan waffles, and this was a fair substitute. Instead of plain ol' nutmeg, however, I used apple pie spice for a little kick.   However, this recipe only made two waffles in my Waring Pro deep pocket Belgian waffle maker.

Like others, I added mashed bananas to the mixture, and also added a little cinnamon. Topped them with maple syrup and a wee sprinkle of chopped pecans. Wonderful! Thanks, Jennifer!

Modified recipe by: 1) Roughly smashing the bananas 2) Subbing in 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour 3) Adding cinnamon and cloves to the batter 4) Adding a TBSP of sugar 5) Instead of adding 1 egg, I used two egg whites, beaten until stiff, and one egg yolk. The result was excellent - a slightly sweet waffle with a light, but chewy texture.  They tasted amazing for something so relatively healthy.

Num num num!  I made this a little healthier by subbing  half of the regular flour w/ whole wheat.  I mashed up the bananas as suggested and added a dash of cinnamon. Topped with 100% pure maple syrup and a dollop of whipped cream. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was a hit with my family. I read a few reviews before preparing it and tried some of the alterations. My version used half whole wheat flour, cinnamon, mashed bananas, and a bit of sugar. They were definitely sticky, but it was worth peeling them off the waffle iron. I will be making this recipe again.

I put the bananas INTO the waffle mixture. Just mashed them up and then folded them in at the end. I highly reccomend doing this instead because otherwise the waffles sort of tended to burn and not turn out that great.

Followed the recipe to the letter, only doubling it. I used a fresh banana, thought the waffles should have been sweeter. I might try it again using a ripe banana. Also thought the waffles were a bit soggy as well. I prefer a waffle a bit crisper. I even left them to cook in the waffle iron longer than suggested.

I am rating this recipe 5 stars because it was sooooo easy to make.  I don't personally care for waffles, but my husband does.  He ate every single bit on his plate.  I actually even ate one.  The banana flavor was just a nice change of pace and since I hate throwing out bananas at the end of the week, this recipe was perfect.  FYI:  I subbed whole wheat flour (1 for 1)for the white flour and they still came out great.

I thought these were really good.  I substitued 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for some of the AP flour and mashed the bananas into the batter.  They had a really wonderful flavor and puffed up nicely in my belgian waffle maker.  A nice healthy alternative to my usual gut-busting waffle recipe filled with butter and sugar.

I made these this morning, and they were delicious! I was only cooking for me, so I halved the recipe, except I only added a pinch of salt (1/4 tsp seemed excessive.) I substituted the flour for whole wheat flour, and I also threw in a couple sprinklings of cinnamon. Instead of mashing the banans, as others have done, I chopped them into little chunks and threw them in with the batter, which worked really well. Overall they turned out great - not too sweet, but with a nice nutty flavor. I will definitely make these again.

Loved them! My 4 year old was thrilled- & we were as well.  I switched to 1/2 whole wheat flour/rest AP.  Added about 1/2 t.  cinnamon & an extra dash nutmeg/mashed the bananas(which were extra ripe).  Buttered the non-stick waffle maker & they were still a bit sticky-but well worth the patience to peel them off!  Thanks for the recipe!

Made the recipe exactly as written and I wasn't particularly impressed by the results. The batter was very thick and I had to add much more milk in order to make it pourable and when cooked they were very dense and a little tough. The flavour was ok, however I think it needed a dash of vanilla.

These waffles have become a regular Sunday staple for my husband and I - really delicious and about 9,000,000 times healthier than the standard "take one stick of butter, 5 eggs, and a cup of sour cream" versions.  One change we've made is to mash 2 bananas with a fork & mix them into the batter, instead of putting the slices on the batter in the waffle iron.  This keeps the waffles from sticking to the iron - and still gives a great banana taste.  Thanks for your contribution to our weekend brunch ritual!

Sliced the bananas and mixed them all into the batter, along with some blueberries. I highly suggest topping fruit pancakes/waffles with fat-free fruit yogurt (let the waffle cool down a bit so the yogurt doesn't get warm).

I halved the recipe since there's just two of us and there were a few changes I made - I mashed half of the banana and added it to the wet ingredients before mixing it all together, then folded in thin slices of the rest of the banana (sliced and cut in half). I also added a bit of cinnamon to the batter. I think having some of the banana mashed adds banana flavor throughout instead of just in the bites with a chunk of banana. The bites with chunks are my favorite, though, so I would definitely recommend saving some banana to slice and add like the recipe states (though I think I'd slice in quarter chunks next time so it's easier to get in the waffle iron). You get a nice banana flavor with this recipe, but I love an even more intense banana flavor so I would like to try adding another half banana to half the recipe (another whole banana to a full recipe) to intensify it a little more. I definitely plan on making this again!

These smell delicious. Instead of nutmeg, I added pumpkin pie spice,  a couple tablespoons of sugar in the raw and a large splash of vanilla. These are okay waffles, not bad, but cooked very unevenly in my waffle maker.

Easy adaptable recipe! I added 3 eggs and 3 mashed bananas, (because I had too many) reducing milk to achieve waffle batter consistency. I also added a little cinnamon and vanilla as reviewers suggested and the results were excellent! The family loved them.

Turned out deliciously .  Added the mashed bananas to the batter as someone else suggested. Used almond milk instead of 1% cows milk for my lactose intolerant grandson.

Not very good waffle consistency, I thought it was a bit too heavy. Also there was no need to chop up 2 whole bananas because this recipe only produced 3 waffles in my waffle maker. Kinda disappointed because I like to make batter for at least 4 waffles and freeze the unused portion.

I wish I had read the reviews before making these waffles.  I would have mashed the bananas into the batter.  This was a good waffle, and if I make these again, I will try using strawberries.

I did follow this recipe however, I did add some vanilla extract and sub cinmamon for the nutmeg. Only because my oldest is allegic to nuts. I also mixed in the bananas after smashing them into the batter. Plus added 1/4 c sugar for some seeetness. They came out perfect

Love, love, love this recipe! Just like the other reviewers I mashed the bananas and I added a table spoon of sugar but there were a delicious way to use up a couple of bananas! They freeze well, too! I made a double batch and freeze the extra, and when I’m busy in the morning just pop it in the toaster and I use a crispy waffle in no time!

Oh my goodness!  These were so good!!  Like some of the others I added the smashed bananas to the batter.  I also added a little cinnamon and pecans.  I put these into my belgian waffle maker and they made 3 perfect waffles.  I am definitely looking forward to trying these with red bean paste and walnuts - that sounds so good!

The batter is too thick and is not as good as the other top rated non banana recipes. I prefer just adding bananas to the normal waffle recipe over this one.

I just love these so much, I've made them over a dozen times. In fact I get so excited when my bananas on the counter turn too soft to eat because then I know it's waffle time! I've made these as instructed with the sliced banana in the middle and while I did enjoy the surprise pockets of banana goodness, I felt like that method of making them was a little too much hassle for me. I prefer to mash the bananas and fold them into the batter, it just makes everything easier. As for the batter, the only thing I change is that I use wheat flour for that extra fourth cup of flour and add a slight sprinkling of cinnamon. I love that these don't use sugar, because I don't have much of a sweet tooth, especially in the morning,  and I think the mashed bananas add the perfect amount of sweetness! This recipe is quick, easy, delicious, and didn't require any whisking of egg whites to make it fluffy- it already is fluffy! Woohoo!

Yummy basic recipe. I added more banana and mashed it like other reviewers had said. Great way to use up overripe bananas! I also added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla. I also added a tablespoon of vegetable oil for nonstick purposes, as I don't use sprays. They were delicious, like banana bread. I found this recipe to yield about 10 waffles in my Belgian waffle maker. They're about 3"x4" waffles. Thanks for another great one All Recipes!!

Made 3/4 of the recipe for Frank and me.  Added nutmeg and cinnamon and used buttermilk instead of 1% milk.  Used 1 small egg and 1 banana.  369 calories per serving.

I made these for my husband and son, and they loved them! The only substitution I made was to switch out the milk because my son cannot have milk. We added Silk brand original almond milk. I would definitely make these again! As long as you fully cover the banana slices you won't get any sticking to the waffle iron.

This recipe was okay. I only used 2 tsp of baking powder instead of 3 because I thought that would be too much, and it was just enough to make the waffles fluffy without tasting the baking powder. 

The sliced bananas didn't work out too well; even with the extra batter over top of them the bananas turned into brown/black goo. I would sooner just place the slices on top of a cooked waffle.

I'll try this again by mashing the bananas into the batter and see how that goes. I'll rewrite my review afterwards.

I made these with 3 bananas (mashed up) and gluten free flour and a small teaspoon of zantham gum.  I love the taste of them - slightly sweet.  Will definitely make them again.

Like many others, I mashed the bananas. Made very moist, soft waffles. A nice way to avoid adding all the vegetable oil or melted butter that other recipes call for. Will definitely make these again.

This is a really good recipe. The only thing I changed was that I mashed the bananas and added them to the wet ingredients.  What I loved about it was that there is no added sugar or fat. The waffles were not what you would call a typical crisp waffle, but I put some in the freezer as an experiment. I was trying to find a way to crisp them up. When I needed them I put them into the microwave for about 15 seconds to thaw, then into my toaster. That's when I got a good crisp waffle. Here's what I thought about the ingredients. Everything worked for me, but I thought a pinch more salt would add to the flavor and maybe omit the nutmeg and exchange it for some cinnamon. The nutmeg was a little overpowering even in the small amount called for. When I made the recipe for the second time I added some roughly chopped walnuts to the batter. This added more crunch and it tasted wonderful. Over all we loved the basic waffle recipe  and will share it with people we know who can't have added sugars and fats in their diets.  It's a keeper.

These were great! As everyone else, I mashed the bananas and mixed them in with wet ingredients. I think the reviews mentioning undercooked insides might have used large bananas. Mine were small, 180g total, and the insides came out fully cooked.

Good waffle recipe. Make it often. My changes are as follows: mash bananas and add to batter. use oat or wheat flour and substitute a 1/3 of the flour with protein powder. almond milk instead of regular milk. no nutmeg (personally don't like it). These changes were made because we avoid white flour/sugar and try to be health conscience. Today I added chopped walnuts. Made a nice change. Going to try using quick cook oats next time.

I did the mashed banana mixed in option and these turned out great! I also added 1 tbsp of oil and a little cinnamon to the mixture. The texture of these waffles were perfect, moist and fluffy inside and slightly crisp outside. I will definitely make again.

I'm not a huge fan of baked bananas, but I thought these were pretty good, and my kids really liked them! I followed the layering technique as described, and didn't have any problems with it. I did oil up my waffle iron pretty well, though. I didn't have any cooking spray, so I poured in a teaspoon or two of grapeseed oil, then turned it a few times to make sure both sides were coated. I may try adding it to the batter next time. A waffle batter really should have enough oil that you don't have to oil the iron at all, so I'm giving this a four as written. I also made a few ingredient substitutions based on what I had available. I used half cake flour and half whole wheat, and mixed up some powdered milk instead of using fresh.

Very tasty!  I doubled the recipe and made Belgian waffles.  Served them with some cinnamon butter, maple syrup and fresh blueberries and raspberries.
