We sliced it and served it in wraps with the sauce - delicious. I will make the sauce again for sure & use it with chicken or any other barbecued meat.

The lamb tasted great. The BBQ sauce recipe was about twice as much as was needed for the roast. I also found the BBQ sauce was too tart, so I added about 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I cooked it med. rare (145deg) and it was perfect. I will make this again with the marinade, but probably make a different BBQ sauce as it is not really appropriate to for the lamb.

I used the same marinade but used a lamb steak instead. For the BBQ sauce I kept the recipe the same but tweaked it a little by adding about a tablespoon of honey and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. Very tasty. I served with polenta and sauted kale
