WOW! What an excellent idea.  It works well with non-canned cranberry leftovers, and tastes great as it's own dish rather than being merely topping.  A fantastic and easy way to use cranberry relish as a dessert!!!!

This is very simple to throw together and tasty as well. I used leftover homemade cranberry compote. I was out of pie to serve this with, so I chose to break up ginger snaps and layer them with the cranberry mixture in a sundae glass.

Oh man. This is delicious. I used "lite" whipped topping and you couldn't tell the difference.
