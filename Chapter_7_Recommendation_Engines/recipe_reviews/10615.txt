These are really good.  I followed the recipe and was glad I did.  I read the reviews, but I barely had enough chocolate.  Glad I followed the recipe.

YUMMY! I have made this 5 times now and this was very good, a great find....  I prefer pecans to walnuts as i find walnuts little to bitter! I like to grind the nuts more to make them finer and not so crunchy! Spreading the batter on to the parchment paper is a bit tricky so be ready- I once added caramel to mine and it was fantastic....although you must be sure not to add all the chocolate! They call for TOO much chocolate i would use half the amount with or without the caramel!!!! I would def consider this a delicacy,as you can not eat to many before you get sugar-outed!  you can be creative with this recipe! I will def make this hundreds and hundreds more times...... Thanks for this recipe. The BEST TOFFEE I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!! YUM YUM YUM!

These are rather good altho they're pretty rich. My dad complained that he couldn't eat very many at a time because of all the sugar. Maybe use a little less if you have a low sugar tolerence. Oh, and a mistake i made was putting the chocolate on before the cookie part hardened/ cooled enough... yeah that didn't work all that well. Let it cool a little more XD

This was just okay for me and my family.  But I am wondering if it didn't turn out because I baked it in a 9x13 cake pan. Next time I will use the cookie sheet.

Liked this recipe. It was very easy and quick.  I think toasted almonds would have made this even better.

These were fast, simple, and a hit among all ages at our neighborhood BBQ. Substitutions: gluten free flour (to accommodate allergies) and hazelnuts (thatâ€™s what I had). Definitely let them cool before spreading chocolate, then cool again in the fridge before cutting. Based on other reviews regarding sweetness, I cut them smaller than other tray bakes

I made this recipe exactly as it says and they turned out great. I cut them into long rectangles because they are very rich and a small cookie is enough for one person. Sort of reminded me of of a chocolate covered shortbread cookie. One pan made so many cookies! I will be using this recipe again. I love how simple it is, I had most of these ingredients on hand.
