I think this is a good recipe, but even though I like all the ingredients, I did not care for the salad.  I chose to reduce the oil to 1/3 cup, & used rice vinegar in place of white wine vinegar because that is what I had on hand.  I would increase the amount of vinegar & lemon juice combined, to equal the amount of oil. I would recommend reducing the amount of thyme by half, especially if marinating overnight/leftovers, unless you really like a strong thyme flavor.  When baking the beets I also recommend standing them on the stem end to bake, because I found it difficult to peel them & see where the peel was,when baked on whatever surface landed on the pan.  This may be due to using larger beets which had to bake longer.  I'm disappointed that I didn't like the finished salad better than I did.

I made this for thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit. We tried it prior to the big day with canned beets but I really enjoyed the fresh beets and they were not hard to cook. We all really enjoyed the dressing. The feta really adds a nice touch.

Beautiful and delicious salad with a regrettably DULL name.  If I wouldn't have had the list of ingredients to look at I would have passed "Beet Salad" right up.  And besides, there's so much more going on with this salad than just beets! We loved the dressing with the 3:1 oil to vinegar ratio we prefer.  I also liked that it called for the less harsh white wine vinegar and lemon juice.  I did, however, skip the thyme, preferring the clean and simple flavors of the dressing without it.  I also loved the presentation and the beautiful, less common components of the salad itself.  No feta on hand, and Hubs doesn't like it anyway; so he enjoyed his with fresh shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano and I happily had the blue cheese he detests on mine.  A simply lovely, sophisticated salad.

What a fabulous tasting salad! Instead of roasting the beets, I boiled them on the stovetop (for time's sake) and it came out delicious. I would recommend making more of the dressing, just because I don't think it coated the salad well enough for the amount of greens I used.

This salad was excellent. Also beautiful to look at and healthy. Make sure to use small, fresh beets, as it makes a big difference to the flavour. Thanks so much for the great recipe.

This was very good. I love the combination of the sweet dressing and beets and the salty feta (I added a bit more to play up the salty/tangy side). I used raw, shredded beets, and I tossed in more endive because I love the texture it adds. The only thing I'd do differently is I'd use a touch more dressing. I think this would also be good with fresh oregano in addition to the thyme. Unfortunately, this didn't hold up so well the next day; the endive got a little mushy.

I really liked this salad and so did my friends. Next time I make it I will leave out the endive, but I think that's just because I don't like it...

Took a gamble and made this for company last night and it was very well received! Love receiving compliments on a meal! The dressing is very nice but did make some small changes using only one tablespoon of Dijon and used fresh basil instead of thyme (added after blending) and a bit more honey. I roasted the beets just wrapping in foil and roasting until the meats seems tender when inserted with a skewer (depending on size, could be an hour or so). A tip for peeling is to hold the beet in a paper towel and rub, the skin will come right off. I prefer Goat Cheese on a beet salad and so did our guests but had the Feta available for Hubs. I didn't use any endive, it would make a pretty presentation but I personally find it bitter. I will definitely make this again! Thank you!

YUM!  Loved this one!  The dressing was perfect and I made it with exact porportions.  I added a small bit of red onion.  Will make this again!

Have never had so much praise for a salad as I have from this one.  Looks beautiful on the place too!
I omitted the endive and it worked out perfect.

There are so many taste sensations going on in this salad that your mouth will be doing the happy dance. Slightly sweet, slightly bitter and that nice bite from the feta all works to make one incredible salad. Try adding some candied pecans for another layer of texture and crunch. Yum and thank you Robbie Rice!

On a whim I bought packaged beets from Trader Joes and was looking for something fun to use them. Hubby sprang a last minute business dinner on me so what better time to try a new recipe?! This salad is delicious. There were only 7 of us so I halved the recipe, left out the endive and added shredded carrots for color. Thanks to other posters, I used the full recipe of dressing and it was perfect. Hubby's client asked me to send him a bottle of my 'special dressing'. Gotta love that!

I subbed in romaine lettuce cause I had some and added balsamic vinegar and lemon zest.  I also used bottled red shredded beets.  It was absolutely delicious.

Didn't like the dressing much. I took MRSLUCKYSTONE's suggestion and cut the thyme and oil by 1/2, but I still thought the thyme and mustard tastes were too strong. Maybe I should have upped the vinegar, too, like she suggested. I liked the salad, though, and had it again with balsamic & olive oil and liked it better that way.

I really loved the tangy tart/sweet aspect.  After adjusting the recipe down to 2 portions, you’re just better off whisking the ingredients in a measuring cup (old school :)

This salad is a home run!  I don't even enjoy beets.  Like at all.  But being tired of the same 'ol, same 'ol and wanting something different from the starch and cooked veggie staple to go with the pork tenderloin I was making, I chose this salad and pan fried brussel sprouts with bacon.  I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception that instead of endive, I used a combination of spring mix and mache lettuces.  Roasting the (as suggested, small) beets wasn't a big deal and I'm thinking they taste better than jarred and that's why I've stayed away from the veggie in the first place.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and added some toasted walnut pieces to the salad.  The vinaigrette is *beautiful*.  I thought a full tsp of thyme would be too much.  Nope!  I used a grainy dijon mustard which made it look almost poppyseed.  It was only the two of us eating dinner, so I drizzled the vinaigrette over the salad as opposed to tossing everything together.  Very pretty.  Very tasty.  Not sure why the pic has mushrooms as the recipe doesn't call for them.  This is a beet salad, not a beet and mushroom salad?  In any event, this recipe, as is, is definitely being added to my binder of go-to recipes.

This recipe was wonderful....I axed the Belgian endive and added candied pecans and it has become one of my favourite salads!  I have also done it with toasted slivered almonds and it was equally delicious! The dressing is really nice to use on any salad.

Love this!  I wanted something quick and easy after work today so I cheated by using canned (not pickled) beets, and I was done in 5 mins.  The dressing is perfect.

Great tasting and very healthy.  I used red leaf lettuce because I had it on hand and it was straight from the garden. I tore it into bite-size pieces.  Also I used fresh beets that I had cooked the night before.  The dressing is very tasty and different from the usual.  I also added some finely chopped toasted pecans just because I always like the nutty crunch and great flavor. I love the combination of the flavors and will definitely make this again. This does deserve a fancier name than just “beet salad”.

This was a hit at a birthday potluck dinner. Some folks avoid nuts and/or dairy, so I divvied the lettuce/spinach/dressing mixture onto five large romaine leaves as individual salads (instead of the endive) on a platter. People chose feta or shaved parm topping; toasted almonds and extra cheese were in a small side dishes.  I used both gold and red beets for color; and used an immersion blender rather than drag out the heavy equipment, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Will certainly make it again.

Not yet, but I am going to.  Question, why put mushrooms in the photo and not the recipe?

I have made this salad multiple times including dinner parties and everyone loves it. The only thing I changed is that I add toasted walnut pieces which I think is essential. The thyme dressing is amazing.

loved the beets!  great salad dressing too.  i forgot to add the feta cheese, but it was very light and flavorful.   i thought the endives would be nice for the presentation, but it would totally have been fine without it.  nobody really ate the leaves either.

I added walnuts and used a bag of "spring mix" salad.
