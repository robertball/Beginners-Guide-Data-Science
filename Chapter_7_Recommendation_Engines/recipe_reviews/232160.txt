This was simply wonderful.  I used butter not margarine but otherwise followed the recipe as written and served it at a dinner party....and then shared the recipe with everyone there.  The crust is so delicious and unexpected I'd like to try a modification of it as a topping on a crumble.  Just the right amount of sweetness, the lemon really boosts the berry flavor and the creamy centre was divine.  I loved how easy it was to get it out of the pan without it falling apart as well - presentation was lovely.  Thank you so much for a new favorite at my house.

I zested my lemons before I juiced them and added that to the cream cheese mixture.  Yummy! It fit nicely in a 9" pie dish.

It was delicious! I made it for a crowd of 30 and everyone loved it! The lemon and blueberry are great together. I let mine chill in the fridge overnight after I put it together to ensure it set completely. I will definitely be making this again. For a homemade dessert, it was so simple.

This would easily be a 5 star, but it didn't thicken the way it should have.  In spite of that, the flavor was amazing!  My family loved it and I will definitely make it again.  I used frozen blueberries and will add an extra Tablespoon of cornstarch next time.  Hopefully that will thicken the blueberries a little more.  The cream base wasn't very firm either, but it was okay.  Flavor was a 10

Delicious! I used fresh huge blueberries, cut back on the sugar a little for the crust, used 1/2 can sweetened condensed milk.
Would make again!

I needed to serve 12 so I doubled the recipe but I only used one can of condensed milk instead of two. I also reduced the sugar for the blueberry topping by 25%. People couldn't stop reaching about it.

When I was making this recipe I zested the lemon that I was using. After I put the cream cheese layer over the crust, I sprinkled some lemon zest over it before I put the blueberries on top. I used about a tablespoon. The recipe turned out amazing! I will definitely make this again! It’s much easier than the recipe I was using and it tastes just as good if not better!

This was super easy to make.  I made for a 4th cookout.  I absolutely love the lemon and blueberry flavors together.  I followed recipe exactly but used butter instead of margarine because it’s what I had.  Thanks for a keeper!
