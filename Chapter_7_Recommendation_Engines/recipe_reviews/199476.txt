I've used this over and over as a dressing for both pasta and potato salads. You can also use this for your own unique tossed green, just wisk in some fat free milk or low fat buttermilk until it's the consistancy that you're looking for. Keep in mind, the longer it sits, the better it is. I use this dip/dressing on just about everything now. Egg white omelettes. Mexican meals. In egg/tuna/chicken salad sandwiches. My family just can't get enough of it!

KEEPER!  I must admit that I made it without the low-fat mayo and sour cream but with the non-fat Greek-style yogurt, and I also left out the bacon bits (preference).  Don't even think about leaving out the horseradish (I love the Inglehoffer brand)!  I had to make it in the 10 minutes I had this afternoon, and it was ready tonight with full flavor.  We started out dipping our carrots and broccoli in it--yum!  Then we had it on our salads (mixed with a little Italian dressing).  We are now thinking that it will be ever so yummy in something like gyros.  And the mind keeps working on new ideas of how to use this new addition to our recipe box!  Thanks, Tat2!  PS:  In reading my review, I wanted to make sure that you knew I used regular mayo and sour cream!

I love this recipe for so many reasons! I'm not a fan of ranch dressing, but this is light and refreshing, and the fact that's it's basically guilt free, it just made it taste even better. This is a real winner, especially for those of you who don't like "diet" dips or dressings. By the way, please use as a salad dressing too. Yummy!

This is GREAT, & only gets better. Good for up to a week in fridge. I've made this several times over the past 2 months. Of the herbs & spices, I use fresh if & when available (such as the garlic, dill, basil, etc.) I used New Mexican red chile powder, & 'hot' Hungarian paprika. The 2 cooked slices of real bacon were reduced to tiny particles in a mini-food processor. The sour cream & mayo were low fat (50% less fat). I have cut-up vegs available to dip in it & eat as much as I want; especially good are cucumber slices & red bell peppers. Also great with no- or low-fat 100% whole wheat crackers, like Kavli Norwegian crispbreads, German Wasa crispbreads, & Akmok crackers. Also used some of this ranch dip in AR's "Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabobs", with these changes: 1/3 c. of this NGZ Ranch + 1/3 c. buttermilk + double the rosemary + increased all other ingredients by 50% = excellent, & comparable in taste to the orig. chicken kabob recipe. I highly recommend this dip!

I put a bit of this dip in a small bowl to dip veggies in for lunch.  After my veggies were gone I had just a tiny little bit of dip left.  I licked the bowl.  Seriously.  I want to feel ashamed, but I don't because it was so good!  I followed the recipe exactly, except used low fat(not fat free) sour cream and mayo, and cooked up some real bacon and crumbled it in.  I think I will go refill my bowl now....and maybe just get a spoon!

I ended up modifying this recipe simply because I didn’t have low fat mayonnaise or sour cream on hand.  I wanted to keep this recipe low cal, so I used reduced fat cream cheese that I had in the refrigerator .I used Greek yogurt instead of plain and omitted the bacon bits, simply to keep the calorie count down.  After allowing the dip to set for several hours, I took a taste—heaven!  The flavors of the herbs and spices are fantastic.  As if I hadn’t made enough changes to this recipe already, I decided to make one more!  Had an English cucumber on hand; diced up about 1 cup and added it.  This doesn’t change the flavor, just adds volume and crunch.  Due to using cream cheese, this turned out to be more of a spread.

Just let me say that this is absolutely DELICIOUS! My hubby and 2 year old totally tore this up at dinner tonight. I served it with a fresh veggie platter as a side for dinner and it was a huge hit. I can't wait to try this in my potato salad. This is a must try recipe! Thanks, Tat2. :)

I made this dip for Thanksgiving to bring with a veggie platter.  I'm sorry to say that this was just not popular at all.  No one felt that it tasted anything like ranch dip or ranch dressing.  I did love the fact that it was low-fat, though.

Looks like I'm one of the minority that didn't like this. I really wanted to love it and it looked great on paper, but it just tasted like plain yogurt and thyme/basil. The herbs were so strong that they overpowered everything else. I agree with previous reviewers who said that it tastes nothing like ranch dip. Sorry. I was really excited about making this but everyone who tried it agreed that it was a disappointment.

I'm on a low sodium diet so this was just what I was looking for--healthy and low in salt.  I just left out the bacon bits and used full fat sour cream (less sodium that way) and it was still great.  A healthy alternative to processed dips/dip mixes.

Wow! This is a gem! I bought a tub of strained greek non fat yogurt from Costco and needed to use it up along with my sour cream. I just happened to need a dipping sauce for my potato wedges so i came online searching and found this!!! I used all fresh herbs, garlic, coarsely fresh ground black pepper. I omited bacon bits, didn't have any and I left out the chili powder for personal preference. It has not had time to set and meld as of yet but it tastes awesome. I love the fact that I can adjust this to my taste. I cannot wait until later on to use a dipping sauce for my oven fresh seasoned potato wedges (from this website) and with my ranch burgers tonight. If you have a chance to use fresh herbs I highly suggest that you do becuase it makes a world of difference in the food, sauces and marinades...Oooh..thank you Sarah Jo!!!

As is often the case with giving a review, the opinion given usually boils down to a matter of taste. I found this only slightly resembled a ranch dressing in flavor and there was something about the combination of spices that didn't add up for my tastebuds. I'm not sure, but I think it was the thyme and basil. I always appreciate a recipe for a home made version of something usually storebought, so I will play around with the seasonings a bit, maybe try it without the horseradish. I have to say though, Hubby LOVED it, so hopefully he'll be happy with a slightly revised version! Thanks, Sarah Jo.

I made this for a pot luck. Most people seemed to like this. I did not care for it a whole lot. I didnt really get a "ranch" flavor. Probably wont be making this agin.

This is an excellent dip.  I used regular mayo, low fat sour cream and fat free greek yogurt.  I left out the bacon bits because I didn't have any, but I did all the rest the same as written.  I kept sticking stalks of celery in it while it was chilling and it just kept getting better.  I suspect the left overs will be even better. Thanks for sharing a really tasty recipe, Tat.

I made this recipe according to directions without alterations.  Absolutely perfect as is.  I believe this will become a staple in my fridge.  This would be wonderful on baked potatoes, or even as a chowder soup base.  The taste is almost addictive.  At first glance, the recipe looks complicated because of so many ingredients.  However it only took about 10 minutes to prepare and most of the ingredients would be in any good cook's kitchen.  If possible, I would give this 10 stars.

I left out the bacon bits because I don't get the whole bacon/ranch thing, and used full fat mayo and sour cream. Added a little milk to make a pourable dressing. It was a little bland right when I mixed it up but after being in the fridge for a couple hours, it was almost perfect! It needed a little more salt - maybe from the lack of bacon bits? But about 1/2 tsp more salt and it was perfect. The best thing about it is the horseradish - I love it, my kids hate it, which means this ranch is ALL MINE.

My husband has high blood pressure and high cholesterol. I make this with fat free everything (including fat free mayo) and I omit the salt and add additional garlic and black pepper. It is absolutely amazing and he loves being able to have a yummy snack again without the guilt. YAY!!!

I took this dip along with a veggie platter to a pot-luck get-together with my friends on Saturday night. Not only was it a simple make-ahead recipe which is ideal for me (I have MS), but everyone RAVED about the taste! One friend called this 'a party in your mouth' lol! I was also so pleased to be able to tell them that the items in the dip were reduced fat and reduced calories. That just made them love it even more!  Thanks so much for sharing.

Outstanding but even better without the horseradish.  I left it out by accident, tasted and it was amazing.  Then I remembered the horseradish (which I really like, by the way), added it and tasted again - not quite as amazing, which was surprising.  Next time I'll just leave that out.  Thanks a ton for this great recipe!  (PS I used all full-fat ingredients.)

Oh YUM! Love this! I omitted the horseradish (not a huge fan) and the bacon bits (didn't have any on hand), but this is fantastic. I had a really hard time putting it in the fridge to chill, I wanted to eat it right away! I keep thinking of all the things I will serve it with. Thanks for sharing with us! :)

Went to a party last night and I was the dip woman.  Brought this with veggies and it was a definite hit.  I did a small survey and not one person felt guilty after eating this so the title is right on?? Thanks Tat2 for a good recipe.

Light and interesting dip It is very tasty, very diet-friendly, and good with veggie dippers. I'm sure it's even better after it's set for awhile. Next time, I'm upping the horseradish and leaving out the pepper. There wasn't enough zest for my burnt out taste buds. :D Thanks! --- You know what? It IS better after it's set overnight. I just had some on crackers and I had to tear myself away from it. I still wanna up the horseradish, but this overnight transformation earned this dip it's last star. Awesome.

This is a very good, low fat ranch dip.  I had to leave the horseradish out, as I didn't realize I was out :( but this was still a very tasty dip for fresh veggies.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Sarah Jo!

This review is based on the actual recipe with no alterations.
Really great dip!!! Everyone loved it.
I have also made it a few times leaving out the horseradish but I've put in chipotle chili powder.  You can do almost anything with this recipe.  Thank you to the author for posting!!

The only change I made was to omit the horseradish, because I don't usually have any.  This is a great alternative to the store bought ranch mix and my family especially enjoyed the addition of the bacon bits.

This is really tasty! I left out the thyme & basil due to personal preference but I really liked the dip overall. I used it as a dip for the oven fresh potato wedges on this site & it tasted awesome. It's very addictive and would be fantastic with any kind of raw veggie. The next time I make it, I may leave out the bacon bits just to see the difference. Bacon is such a strong flavor and after this sat awhile, the bacon flavor becomes very obvious. You can certainly play this recipe up or down according to your own personal preference. Thanks!

Yummy and zesty! I used all low fat ingredients as Sarah has suggested and also used crisp crumbled turkey bacon. I loved the taste of the horseradish and the dill which stood out to me. Served with a veggie tray for the game. I felt "No-Guilt"!!!  Thank you Sarah aka Tat2....great recipe!

i was very nervous making this.  i used all fresh herbs.  it tasted very 'green' to me.  perhaps using dried herbs would be better.  i will try that next time.  it was well received though, so i will make it again.  other than using fresh herbs, i followed the recipe.

Thank you tat for a delicious and healthy dip.  I use it just about on anything.  It is especially good with baked potato wedges.  The best part is it even gets my 2 year old to eat carrots!  Thanks again :)

Thank you for a a great low-fat dip recipe! This is wonderful as given. I accidentally used non-fat vanilla yogurt (whoops)...but it still tastes great with all the seasoning.

Delicious, and easy to put together. Being vegetarian, instead of the bacon bits I added a little liquid smoke. I can't imagine it being any better and I have dipped a multitude of things into it since I made it. Thanks!

That long list of spices equals a great balance of flavors.  I used low fat versions of the sour cream and the mayo, and real bacon.  I'm looking forward to thinning it to use as a salad dressing.  Delish!

I cringe at anything that's fat-free or close to it, but this was very good! I think the combination of yogurt, mayo and sour cream helps cover up any conception of "diet" dip, as well as the abundance of flavors from the other seasonings.  Only changes I made were to use light sour cream and I omitted bacon bits, both changes based on what I had on hand.  It really needed to sit for a few hours before it wowed me, but we pretty much inhaled one whole recipe as a dip for veggies  and then as a spread to use on burgers - mine was a veggie bean  burger, and this dip was a PERFECT addition!  Only change I would even consider making is to maybe replace the dried parsley with fresh.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was fantastic!  Nothing I used was low-fat (weight isn't a concern for me, luckily), the yogurt I used was homemade, and for the bacon bits I actually fried bacon and crumbled in it.  This stuff is amazing.  My mom even ate it on pork chops!

Thank you, Sarah Jo!

I used full-fat dairy, because I knew my party "audience" would prefer it that way.
After the holidays, I know I'll prepare this as intended. 
I left the beautifully balanced spices as devised. If it's not broke, don't fix it. I used uncured, nitrate- free bacon for even less guilt. :  )
Dee-lish and delightful in a pretty serving bowl.

This dip is so good! The horseradish really adds a great flavor. I dipped baby carrots in it while my husband and kids dipped baked potato chips in it. We all loved it!

If I could give this ten stars, I would!!! I followed the recipe to the letter, and after mixing everything together, I gave it a taste test...I couldn't stop eating it! Nothing needs to be changed with this recipe. This is definitely a delicious no-guilt dip. Thanks Sarah Jo :)

Wow, is this yummy! I made it as a dip for my 92-year old mom. I'm trying to get more protein in her, so used Greek yogurt in place of plain yogurt. I also used full fat everything  (to get her more calories) and veggie bacon bits. I didn't add horseradish. I used veggie bacon bits. I just made it and have been digging in myself already! I can't wait to share this recipe!

Wow.  This is amazing.  I loved it.  I tasted before I let it set in the fridge and it already tastes good.  I plan to use this tonight when I make my chicken ranch avocado tacos.  I did just a few things different.  I omitted green onions, bacon and red chili powder.  I don't care for those so it was my own taste.  And lastly I used 0% chobani plain greek yogurt instead of the regular yogurt.  Yummy can't wait till it settles in the fridge.

16 indredients!  Wow!  Yummy!  Tthe bacon bits add bulk and taste.  I substituted chives & onion for green onions.  Wish I had put in green onions, but that meant a trip to the grocery store.

Just finished making it right now, most of the ingredients already in my fridge and pantry.  My health-conscious teenage daughter is doing more than taste-testing that I may not have enough for my work's dip day tomorrow.  AMAZINGLY GOOD!

This dip is delicious!  I made this to serve with veggies for friends who are serious about their diet, and they raved.  Thing is, you don't even notice it's low fat because it's so tasty.  Made exactly as written, and prepared the night before so it had great thick consistency and the flavors melded perfectly.  Thanks for a yummy recipe!

We LOVED this! Really a nice dip, and I love that I can snack on it and not feel bad about it. I didn't change anything in the recipe, and will definitely be making it again soon. :) Thanks Tat!

This was great! I made dressing by adding some fresh buttermilk that I had leftover from making butter. I had to use a little more mayo and some sour cream because when I opened my plain yogurt it had mold on it (ugh!) I didn't have any green onions, so I used some dried chives and I omitted the bacon bits because I didn't have any. Super good! I'm trying to get my husband to stop eating the bottled ranch so we'll see how he likes this!

The list of ingredients may look a little over powering but I have to say, the end result is very good. We dipped veggies in it and could have used it on baked potatoes. Also a great salad dressing.

This was very good. I HIGHLY suggest using non-fat greek yogurt as it is even more satisfyingly creamy as regular whole fat yogurt. Mmmm!

Made this several times.  First time without the horseradish (didn't have any) or bacon bits.  Loved it either way.  H2 and I use it as a dip or salad dressing.  I've even used it for breakfast (spread on toast instead of butter with a sliced hard boiled egg).  Great recipe.

I made this twice, once with 1 teaspoon horseradish and once without any.  I think this is an excellent dip!  It had a really nice kick, with or without horseradish.  I'll keep making this as my new stand-by dip and use 1/4 teaspoon of horseradish.

Thanks, tat2! This got inhaled with baby carrots and those pretzel-crackers! How did you come up with such a tasty treat that is actually not bad for you?? Much obliged for sharing! ** update: LOVED this as a topping to the Butter Bean Burgers (that I turned into Black Bean Burgers) from this site!

Great recipe!  I love how healthy it is and that you get a little calcium when you eat it.  I served it with carrots and sweet potato chips (you gotta try sweet potato chips!).

This is a wonderful dip recipe! I discovered that it tastes really good after it sits for a day or two. I didn't use fat-free products as the recipe called for; I used low-fat instead, because that is what I had around the house. I also used chives instead of the green onions for a milder onion flavor, and skipped the horseradish because I don't care for it. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe! I will definitely make it again!!!

I've wanted to try this ever since it 'came on the scene' here at AR.  I finally picked up the non fat plain yogurt that I was lacking and rushed home to whip this up. O....M....G....this is, well, I have no words for it as every time I take a taste, I immediately utter "mmmmm". I could hardly wait until it was chilled enough to sample and am already thinking this would be wonderful to dip my wraps in.  BF came home and took a taste and loved it.  It's phenomenal.  I bow to you, queen Tat2!  :)  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I thought it was a decent dip. I made this a few months ago and I liked it but the family wasn’t crazy about it. I had a ton left over and had to through some out. If I make it again I’ll exclude the bacon.

This is the very guilty version. Real mayo, Creme freche, and Greek style fatty yoghurt. Umami Mami. No bacon bits.  lemon juice to zing it up a bit. Good basics to play with.

My husband loved this with all the veggies he likes to munch!  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception that I didn't worry about low fat anything (too much sugar is added to lower fat content).  He just about are all of my "trial run "  in one sitting!  I was a little daunted by all the spices listed, but I actually had everything on hand, so it was a huge success at my house!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I've made this almost every other day since the first time, my hubby likes it so much!  We always try to have lots of veggies on hand, so this just takes it up a notch in the flavor department.  The only thing I do differently is leave out the salt altogether and go easy on the hot stuff.  Otherwise, it continues to stand the test of repeated batches!  Seriously good dip!!

When I first started making this I tried only using the yogurt and even though it was good I felt like it was missing something so I added the mayo and it was great, so I decided to add the sour cream too and that kinda killed it for me. I think next time I'll only use sour cream and mayo or yogurt and mayo, not all three. Also, I don't usually use low fat, non-fat stuff but I thought I'd give it a try. Next time I'll use the full fat stuff for sure. Overall it was a decent recipe but it did need some tweaking to get it just right.

My 1st-3rd grade American Heritage Girl Scout group needed to make and share a food for one of their badges. For health reasons, we do not do low-fat versions of products, so I used the real version of mayo, yogurt, and sour cream. I also dropped the bacon bits (we weren't cooking) and all the spicy spices bc it was for young people. EVERYONE LOVED IT! From kinder to high schoolers and all the moms. The bowl was liked clean.

I was looking for a homemade ranch dip because every one I found in the store had MSG in it. This one is a winner! I didn't use bacon only because I had everything else on hand but no bacon. It was still delicious!

This was very good when it was fresh but 2 days later it was runny and inedible.  Maybe I just didn't eat it fast enough?

Not bad! I really enjoyed this. My husband didn't, but he's not a fan of dips (or dairy products in general). :) My only complaint is that I'd like a little more spice / zip. I'll be sure to increase the amount of horseradish (or pepper) to my liking next time. Because I only needed enough dip for myself, I halved this. My only other change was subbing Hormel REAL bacon pieces for bits. This paired great with potato chips and cut-up veggies (mini carrots, broccoli and cauliflower) and our stromboli sandwiches. Thanks for sharing, Sarah! :-)

My husband said that he liked this dip, but he rarely ate it, so I'm giving it four stars instead of five.  Otherwise, it's fun to make, uses lots of spices up if you have too many in your cupboard, and makes enough for a large crowd!  Next time I will split the recipe by 4 for just one person.  I have no guilt about eating fat, BTW, so I used regular mayo, yogurt & sour cream.

Very tasty. I used as many fresh ingredients as I could (bacon, basil, garlic), and added a few more spices- cayenne, chipotle and smoked paprika.

This was great! I was so surprised at how well the flavors blended and it tastes delicious on raw veggies, a perfect healthy snack. Me and my boyfriend both agree that this dip is much better than any other store bought brand we have tried.

DELICIOUS!! We couldn't wait to try it, so we only let it sit for about 30 mins, but it's still good with veggies.  I can't wait to try it tomorrow as i'm sure it just gets better with age!

We really enjoyed this dip!  Made as written but was short on parsley - only had half the amount and it still tasted great. Thanks for sharing!

This is really good.  I added hot pepper sauce to give it more zip.
