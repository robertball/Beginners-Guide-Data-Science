very tasty and messy. 1/2 lb beef per sandwich is too much, used closer to 1/3 lb and still had overstuffed sandwiches.  My roast beef was left over lunch meat from a party, along with a ton of Provolone cheese so I used Provolone instead of the Swiss.  Also cut the amount of horseradish in half, which is a good thing or the kids would not have eaten it.

Maybe I was really hungry but I thought these were really great.  My only comment would be the amount of beef per sandwich.  Per recipe it would be 1/2 lb of beef per sandwich and that is a LOT of beef along with the onions, mushrooms etc.  I would plan for 8 sandwiches with this amount of meat.  You could up the onions without changing a thing.

A couple key problems with this:

1. Way too much filling. There's no realistic way to dip "the dipper" with that amount of meat on it. If I were to make it again, I'd probably cut that in half.

2. Horseradish sauce is too strong and drowns out the other flavors. I'd leave it off.

Maybe without these two problems there's a good recipe here, but I didn't care for it as is.

I was not thrilled with this.   There was a little too much going on in my opinion - the sweet marsala wine, the strong garlic spread, the equally strong horseradish spread.  I did not think the flavors worked all that well together.  I think it has good bones but I wouldn't make it again without changing it pretty substantially.

Bread makes this sandwich. You will never go back to a regular French dip. So good!

Made this for dinner last night. It was delicious!  Didnâ€™t make the garlic paste but buttered the ciabatta rolls and sprinkled them with garlic bread seasoning. Halved the amount of roast beef. Everything else was the same. Absolutely one of the BEST french dips we have had.

4-26-14:  Great, although the garlic basil spread was a little too strong for my taste.

This recipe was just awesome! I used it as a reference and made a few changes to suit my taste. No horseradish, and instead of the other spread called for I just made a garlic butter. Havardi instead of swiss,added red bell pepper and as I don't eat beef I laid on a fried egg instead. A mix of flavors that make your taste buds wake up and take notice!

like every one else this one was awesome.had ended up adding half the amount of horse radish. as well make sure you add plenty of liquid to make the dipping sauce. I will make this one again for sure.

I was afraid to try this recipe, as there weren't a lot of reviews.  I had nothing to be afraid of, as this is an awesome sandwich!

This sandwich is hellishly good! That`s why it`s not so healthy for you. Made this a couple of times, and comes out perfect! I would love to make this at a large party, but, it would be too much work. A great meal for once in a while! CHEERS!
