I have been making corn this way for years.  For 6 servings, use 4 tbs mayonnaise, 2 tsp fresh lime juice, 1 tsp cumin and mix together.  Roll the grilled corn in butter, then the mayonnaise mixture, sprinkle with Cotija cheese (do not use Parmesan as it is not the same nor authentic to the corn the street vendors serve in Mexico), sprinkle with McCormick's Mexican hot chili powder.  Serve immediately ~ your taste buds will thank you!

I love this recipe because I modified the following based on another recipe online:
 
- Mixed in one bowl, 3 tbsp of mayonnaise and 2 tsp of lime juice to it. 

- Mixed in another bowl, 2 tbsp grated parmesan cheese, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp ground red pepper, 1/4 tsp ground cumin and 1/8 tsp salt  

After grilling the 4 corns (shucked) until tender 10-15 minutes, I glazed the corn with the mayonnaise mixture, then sprinked the spices onto them.

I recommend serving this meal with Black Bean Burritos.

This recipe is only the starting point:  I strongly suggest that you follow the recipe that SKHOUSTO shared in her review...it is definitely 5 star!  It bears repeating:  

3 tablespoons fat-free mayonnaise
2 teaspoons fresh lime juice
2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan cheese
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/8 teaspoon salt
4 ears shucked corn
Cooking spray

Prepare grill. Combine mayonnaise and juice in a small bowl. Combine cheese and next 4 ingredients (through salt) in another small bowl.
Place corn on a grill rack coated with cooking spray. Grill corn 12 minutes or until tender, turning frequently. Remove corn from grill; brush with mayonnaise mixture, and sprinkle with cheese mixture. Serve immediately.

This recipe works better with white corn.  Plus, you need to soak it in water with the husk still on for about 30 minutes.  After that, remove from water, cook until the husk is charred.  Remove the husk for a juicy treat.

In addition to the lime, and if you like hot food, most vendors add chile guajillo and a little salt.  It's a chile power - Cayenne is an OK sub.  This stuff is really excellent - almost addicting! Great side dish if you just use corn off the cob and have no time to grill!

I couldn't find cotija cheese so I used grated parmesan.  It turned out great.  I have also used this recipe with corn cut off the cob.  It was very creamy and had a great flavor.

Growing up in East Los Angeles, this was one of my favorite after school snacks! The recipe the street vendors used was, they boiled the corn, rubbed mayo on them, sprinkled the cotija over that, squeezed on butter(usually parkay),squeezed on lime juice, and then sprinkled on chili powder (optional),in that order. I hope this helps, absolutely delish!

If you are cooking the corn indoors, pre-heat the oven to 400ÂºF.  For 4 cobs use the following directions - 1.  Mix: 3 tbsp of mayonnaise and 2 tsp of lime juice 2.  Mix in a Separate Bowl: 3 tbsp grated Parmesan,       1 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp ground red pepper, 1       tsp ground cumin and 1/2 tsp salt 3.  Roll shucked corn in mayonnaise mixture and       then sprinkle the spice mixture on top  4.  Wrap each cob tightly in tin foil 5.  Cook for 25-30 minutes

We will be grilling this alot this summer. So different and tasty! Don't be afraid of the mayo, It really is used as a binder.  I can't wait to share this with my friends at our first barbeque this spring. This corn is going to knock their socks off!!

I lived in Chicago for years and missed the "elotes man" and his cart.  So now I my own version of "Mexican Corn".  But I do not do it with corn on the cob.  I use a bag of fresh frozen corn, 2 Tablespoons butter, 1/4 mayo, parmasean cheese, and salt and pepper to taste.  My family LOVES it.

I was a little scared to throw these on the grill w/out husks or foil but they cooked beautifully & we loved the charred flavor. I used low-fat mayo & I subbed fresh grated parmesan for the cotija. And I just mixed the melted butter up into the mayo & slathered it on. I forgot the lime though....that would have been a great addition.

Very good - I skipped the butter and added the spice - Tajin, look for it in your local grocery store - it is chili powder with lime. Otherwise I suggest using chili powder.

I love corn on the cob fixed this way.  It's important to use Cotija cheese...we tried Parmesan once and it was just not the same.  I do use a shortcut, though.  I buy "Mayonesa" brand mayonnaise...it already has the lime in it!

Best corn on the cob I have ever had. And I've had a lot!!! The butter is a must, the mayo is just a wonderful creamy note, and the cotija cheese and lime send it over the top!

Made this tonight and I accidentally mixed the butter and mayo together before I basted it onto the corn but it was still really good. I also added cayanne, chilli powder and cumin to the mayp mixture. Used grated ramano for the cheese and roasted in the oven on 350 for about 15 minutes since I realized we didnt have charcoal. It came out perfect! I will be making again soon!

You can't go wrong with this recipe!  After grilling to a light/medium char:  I omitted the butter, brushed on some low fat mayo, rolled it in grated pecorino romano cheese (nice and tangy), dashed some chili powder on it and finished it with a squeeze of lime.  SO GOOD!  This will definitely be on my 'Last Supper' menu...LOL

Definitely will grill corn this way every time - I put the butter & mayo on before grilling - added spice mixture and then grilled - made a nice crust on the corn - big hit with everyone - the lime is a must at the end

I made this last night but I made a couple little changes and it was PERFECT!  First, I shucked the corn then buttered it and wrapped in tin foil.  Grilled for about 30 minutes, turning every 5 or so.  Then, opened the foil and used a spatula to lightly coat with mayo, liberally sprinked with Cotija and then with Mexican Hot Chili Powder.  Served right on the same tin foil with a slice of Lime, it was PERFECT!  Amazing...

Almost always make our corn-on-the-cob like this! My brother-in-law won't eat it any other way! Can easily substitute parmesan or romano for the cotija & I set out a shaker of chile con limon. For a relative w/ dentures I just remove the ears of corn from the stalk & mix everything to gether in a bowl. Kind of addictive actually!

We first learned about eating corn this way at a church fair.  Now I have the exact, and simple
directions.  We so enjoyed it last night with the new bumper crop of corn this year!!!Thank you for sharing!  ***Oh you don't have to use grilled corn, boiled/simmered works fine!  The cheese is now found in most grocery stores, found ours at a Walmart Supercenter!

Delicious.  Don't skip the lime and make sure you use cotija cheese.

This corn is AMAZING! I added a sprinkle of chili powder on mine and it was soo good! Oh, and instead of sprinkling the cheese on, after you put the butter/mayo on roll it in the cheese. even better!

As the first reviewer suggested, I sprinkled with combined seasoning mix.  Also soaked corn with husks for awhile before grilling. This is almost heaven food. My husband said this was the best corn he's ever had. I agree. For me, the lime squeezed on takes it over the top.

Delicious!!!!  My kids even liked it.  The only tip I have is that you should grade the cotija cheese so it sticks to the corn easier.  We will make this again for sure.

Very, very good recipe for fresh corn! I had this twice at parties before deciding that I had to learn how to make it on my own :o) I did use other reviewers recommendations (the most popular ones) and used parmesan cheese just because I already had it and didn't want to buy the cotija cheese just for this recipe. So yummy! I'll use this one again many times. Thank you! Oh yeah, I did leave the corn in the husk after cleaning off the silks so I wouldn't have to worry about burning/charring it too much.

Made this tonight for the first time... the family loved it! picky eaters (girls, ages 9 and 13) ate 2 each! Used skwebsters suggestions and it was awesome! Plan to make it this Saturday for 100 people at a Surprise Party for a friend, should go well with the Carnitas, and other Mexican fare! Thanks for a great recipe!

So yummy! I expected to find this recipe using parm' instead of cotija(would've used cotija either way). Cotija's definitely better if you can find it in your local market.

This was extremely well received by my entire family at a non conventional Christmas eve feast.  
I did make some slight changes though, by using 3 normal sized cans of  white shoepeg corn, drained, and poured into a pyrex 8x10 baking dish.  I used 1/2 cup of butter by cutting it up into pats and placing them on top of the corn and broiling it in the oven until some of the kernels became brown.  I then added about 1/2 cup "light" mayonnaise then squeezed in some lime juice and sprinkled on parmesan cheese.

I live on the Mexico/U.S.A. border and there are many elote vendors here. The most delicious ones are grilled of course! Chili powder, however, is a must and is very common here.  Thanks for sharing.

I am so glad that I have found a great way to get some 'elote' when a street vendor cannot be found.

For my preference, I omitted the butter, but stuck with the mayo, cotija, and added some pico de gallo (the powdered version found in the mexican aisle of the supermarket).  I always wondered what red 'spice' the vendors use, and a Mexican friend of mine told me it was pico de gallo.

Anyway, it is great corn!  Be sure to use a squeeze of lime!  Delicious!

Love this. I was first introduced to this when I worked at a restaurant that had a lot of Mexican employees. They used Parmesan because that's what we had at the restaurant, and that's what I use because I always have some on hand... so good!

My family loves this recipe. We make it with fresh corn on the cob when its in season and then we make it in the winter with frozen corn. We just throw the corn in a pan with some butter and cook until it starts to brown and then mix in the mayo and cheese.

My brother has been eating corn like this for years since his neighbor who is Mexican introduced it to him.  Since he's raved about it for years, i decided it was finally time for my family to give it a whirl.  So, the result is that this is most likely the ONLY way we'll eat corn on the cob ever again!  My 9 yr old son who despises mayo, ate his corn so fast, it was all over his face!  When I told him there was mayo on it, he said he'll only eat it on corn.  So delish, i can't even explain.  Going to have to make sure all summer that I have Cojito cheese on hand!  Can't wait to try it with our corn from the garden!! :-)

This was a delicious way to dress up grilled corn on the cob!  I didn't have cotija cheese so I freshly grated some Parmesan cheese instead.  I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't mind the mayonnaise at all.  But after making it as written I will probably skip the butter next time due to the unnecessary extra calories. Thank you for posting this recipe!

YUMMY!  This was the first time I grilled corn straight on the rack without foil or in the husk; it was really good this way.  We enjoyed the flavors even though I used parmesan in place of the cotija cheese.  I will have to look for it in the stores next time I make it. My butter had some garlic from making garlic bread and I sprinkled a little chili powder as well as salt & pepper.

This is a good recipe-- I personally love Elotes. But if you want it to be authentic, use mayo con limon. This is what hispanics normally use. It adds a very light citrus twist to it. So this is how we make it in my home, cook the corn shucked, spread mayo con limon (mayonnaise with lime), roll in cotija cheese, and spread a little ketchup on it. That is how you normally see it.

I agree on the cheese while one store might not have it it's not that hard to find. I found it this time at Sprouts last time at safeway.

It was good, but if you're serving a crowd that has never tried it before, it could be a major miss. My crowd didn't take to it like I had thought. However, when I got my picky guests to try it, they opened up and really liked it.

My new favorite way to eat corn. My boyfriend and I have this at least twice a week. I get the Cojita cheese at either Raley's/BelAir or Winco in the Sacramento area.

AMAZING!! Anytime we grill corn I always make this for me. I grew up eating these especially when we went to Mexico. Oh, this brings back memories. :)

Loved this. I want more now for breakfast!! I mixed up the butter mayo and spices all in one bowl, sprad it on the hot corn and topped with the cotija cheese. Just the best. I didn't have acess to a grill so I cooked the corn on the stovetop for a  few minutes.. bet it is even better grilled

Love this! I do what another reviewer suggested and mix the mayo with lime and in a seperate bowl mix the cheese with chili powder, cumin and red pepper. then coat the corn after the mayo stuff has been rubbed on. I've also used the crumbly queso fresco cheese once when I could not find cojita cheese, which was even better I thought. Because it's a little messy, I cut the kernals off the cob and into a bowl and eat it that way. YUM!

EXCELLENT!!!These were sooooo good. The entire family loved it. I did make changes. I did not use the grill. I baked in a covered dish for 25 minute on 350. mixed the mayo and butter together and spread on corn right after it came out of the oven. then sprinkled parmesean cheese (could not find cotija. I will definately make this again.

Perfect Recipe, but I had to spice it up "Latino Style" with some cayenne pepper sprinkled atop the grated cheese.  
Note:  Parmesan cheese does work well as a substitute, and boiled corn (boiled in buttery, salted water) makes this recipe a hit too !!!

What a wounderful recipe. A real change of pace from the usual grilled corn on the cob. I usually have ears left over not this time. I just added a little salt to mine and that was it.Use the lime wedge's you won't regret it.
Thanks for sharing

I have never been very fond of corn on the cob. For some reason, the picture along with this recipe got my attention, so I tried it. OMG, I now love corn on the cob. As many have said, the recipe doesn't sound all the good, but you must try it. I did make some tweaks as skwebster recommended. I added 1/2 t. chili powder, a dash of cayene,a dash of cummin and some salt to the mayo. I went to 3 stores before I found the grated cotija cheese. Ranch Market (a Mexican Supermarket) had it in their cheese deli in bulk. This really was great. And I even forgot the lime.

This is about the Best way to eat corn, IMO. All I do is put the corn in a hot oven. I don't bother shucking it either, in fact, hot corn is Easier to shuck, just pull it all off. Just be careful, Hot you know! I put the mayo on a paper plate and roll the corn in it. Holding it like a taco. Once it is covered, just sprinkle with with the cheese. This corn has enough fat that I don't bother with butter. Just give it a healthy squirt of Sriracha sauce and put on a big bib!! EXCELLENT!

For those that have settled for parmesan chesse as a replacement to Cojita cheese, what a shame. This recipe AS IS does not need tweaking, modifying or any overhaul whatsoever. I tried the parmesan cheese method because I did not have all the ingredients, and at the time it deserved a very good rating, until I got my lazy butt to the store and got Coitja cheese.  I finally made the real deal and the parmesan cheese method was instantly downgraded to OK. Make this corn as is and I guarantee you will be the gourmet griller you sought out to be. Cotija cheese all the way!

I am so glad a reviewer posted how to make this cheese with parmesan because I couldn't find cotija in the grocery store.  Mixed in one bowl, 3 tbsp of mayonnaise and 2 tsp of lime juice to it. - Mixed in another bowl, 2 tbsp grated parmesan cheese, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp ground red pepper, 1/4 tsp ground cumin and 1/8 tsp salt.   This was a perfect combo!!  I served with chili-lime chicken kabobs found on allrecipes.

I am a big fan of Elote!! I was looking for a different way to make it. It wasn't as good as my original way. Sweet corn, you dont need butter. and instead of the wedges of lime which is NOT optional, you have to put a seasoning on it. Lemon Pepper, or Cayenne is MUCH better! Good for a different ingredient though!

At first glance, elote does not sound very appetizing at all to me... hmm corn on the cob with mayonnaise. But, my husband asked for it and ... not bad. I made it the first way and the husband liked it but he wanted something more. So, instead I just put butter spray all over the ear first. Then, instead of just mayonnaise, I mix mayonnaise with equal part of hot sauce. It gives it a great flavor (and kick).  Cojita cheese is good on it.  I have also made this with 3 blend Italian cheese, when that's what I had on hand, and once with cottage cheese. Very good. This is a different way instead of regular old boring corn-on-the-cob.  Also, letting it flame over the fire is delicious.  If you do not plan on cooking your corn over fire though, do not boil it instead. I know a fast trick!  If your corn is thawed (if not, thaw it),  wet a paper towel and ring it out.  Wrap your shucked corn inside the paper towel, then microwave it on high for about 5 minutes (depending on your particular microwave.  Mine used to take 5 but now it takes 6 or 7, so it really just depends).  Your corn will taste just as good microwaved as it does boiled, it's just easier.  I hope I helped someone out there.  Thank you.

This is very similar to the elote i make, except i boil the corn. then spread the mayo, sprinkle queso fresco evenly, and drizzle a small amount of butter on top. For those in my family that love chili, i add some pico de gallo to theirs. That said, this recipe is great, the grilled corn really brings out the flavor and i will be making elote both ways from now on.

Wonderful! I followed the top recommendations and did the following as the base recipe looked a little plain: Mixed 3 tbsp of mayo and 2 tsp of lemon juice in one bowl. Mixed in another bowl: 2 tbsp grated parmesan cheese, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp ground red pepper, 1/4 tsp ground cumin and 1/8 tsp salt After grilling the 4 corns (shucked) until tender 10-15 minutes, I glazed the corn with the mayonnaise mixture, then sprinked the spices onto them. Note: I used some high quality chile powder for this and kind of eyeballed the measurements. So good! The most unique corn on the cob I've had. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was good and the cotijo was salty, so no need to add salt.  I think I will try to make it more melty next time.  I had it where it was more liquefied...and really liked that.

A few adjustments:    I replaced the cojita cheese with grated parmesan, which is easier to find. I also thinned out the mayonnaise by adding the lime juice to it and seasoned it with salt and pepper. I made it a little healthier by cutting out the butter and sprinkling some cayenne pepper on the top of the cheese. Voila!

Amazing! After vacationing in Mexico and being unable to find a vendor with this corn I had to make it when I returned home. I was apprehensive about the mayonnaise, but WOW! We sprinkled with cayenne pepper too! We will be having this again.

This was a great recipe, perfect for Cinco de Mayo!  I found the cojita cheese at a wonderful Mexican grocery store, and I'll be back to shop there many more times, for sure.  Thanks for turning me on to this yummy treat, LOVED it!

This is sooooooo so good! I've made this a few times, the only thing is I don't have a grill. I just buy frozen corn and boil it for 8 minutes then add the butter, mayo and roll it in the shredded cotija cheese. I also sprinkle it with chili powder and cayenne pepper. I agree with many other reviewers.. I will never go back to eating regular corn on the cob. The cotija cheese has such a great mellow flavor, I really can't imagine trying parmesan on here after trying the cotija. Don't be scared off by the mayo, if you spread it on lightly, just enought to bind the cheese, then you won't be able to taste it at all.

For the life of me I can not find Cojjito cheese, so I used my favorite fresh grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and it was phenomenal on the grill!!!  I am going to keep hunting...

Yum!  Does sound quite different but everyone loved them.  The lime part was about 50/50, some said it put it over the top, some said it ruined the corn, so serve the lime on the side.

This is so crazy delish! I've made this about 10 times and love it. I've used every kind of cheese and seems like my family loves it with the shaved fresh parmesan cheese. The Cojita is great too. Lime is a MUST and brings all the flavors together. My new fav way to eat corn!

we enjoyed this a lot, it was kind of difficult to cook on the grill, but it was still good.  didn't have the cotija cheese, so used parm - next time I will get some cotija cheese and try it with that.  thanks for the recipe

This is really the best corn ever! It took me a while to find the cotja cheese ... you'll find it at a grocery store with a larger selection of fine cheeses. It was so worth it. Amazing flavor, No leftovers here. Absolute must try.

After trying street corn at a local restaurant, I began searching for a recipe and found this one, so I thought I'd give it a try. My husband absolutely raved about it and ate 3 of the 4 ears of corn!! Will definitely be making this again!!

This recipe is spot on... but, you forgot the chili powder! You have to sprinkle chili powder over the mayo and cheese on the corn or it just isn't authentic.

Delicious!  The whole family loved it.  We made this with fresh bi-color corn, which is a sweeter corn.  Husked it & tossed on the grill, no soaking as another reviewer suggested.  I wasn't paying attention to the details & mixed the melted butter with the mayo instead of pouring on melted butter then the mayo.  I'm going to continue to do it this way because it worked out so nicely & was easy to coat in one step.  The cojito cheese is a must in my opinion.  We could have eaten just this for our entire meal.

OMGOODNESSS I planned an On the Border Fiesta for my boyfriend for about 50 people and this corn was so delicious. I used regular corn on the cob nibblets instead of fresh corn. I followed the recipe as stated and it was so easy. People were a little skeptical of the mayo but when they tried it, LOVED IT!  Everyone is still asking for me to cook Mexican food for my gatherings.

We don't shuck the corn when grilling, just soak it in cold water for a couple hours and grill with the husk on for some of the sweetest juiciest corn, and it doesn't burn. The husk will peel back easily after cooked, although it is hot, so watch it. I just mixed all the mayo, soft butter, lime and spices up in a bowl and we buttered our corn with it, super easy.

Exactly! This is how its made.. I make this all the time. First time I went to Mexico, I had one and been hooked ever since. You want authentic Mexican food, the only place you will find that is in the heart of Mexico. And there, they don't use parmesan cheese.

This it the first I have rated a recipe on this site! I made this tonight and it was excellent! In fact, it is the best corn I have ever tasted! I rolled the corn in butter, then put mayonaise/lime juice mixture on it and sprinkled with Cotija cheese and chili powder! It was so good the family ate it all! yreka2011

I used a combo of the recipes that others posted. I brushed my corn with mayo and 1/2 way through the grilling, sprinkled the cheese/spice mix on it. After it was done, I rolled it in butter and then spread the mayo/spice mix on it and sprinkled it with extra cheese! Will definitely make again! Delicious!

This was soooo good!!  We had people over for dinner and everyone went crazy over it!  People even had seconds and thirds!  I used parmesan cheese instead of cotija because we couldn't find it. I sprinkled on 1 tsp. of chili powder too. Great!!

This was so delicious and easy!  I kind of cheated because I saw this video with a guy throwing the whole corn in the microwave, shucks and silks and everything and microwaving 4 minutes for each cob and then the shucks and silk falls off.  It's like magic.  So I cooked it in the microwave and then followed the recipe exactly with the addition of Tony's season salt and threw it on the grill for a couple of minutes while the rest of the meal was finishing cooking, just for flavor.  We all had corn all over our faces.  Definitely a big hit and will be repeated!

The idea is intriguing & I do like the flavor of the cheese & seasonings.  The corn, which was fresh from our garden, did not cook well on the grill - the texture was very odd.  I have never had Mexican corn on the cob so I am a little uncomfortable about giving this a low rating.  Maybe it is usually starchy & chewy?  The basic flavors were yummy but the combo with the grilled corn just wasn't good.

I added a lot of different seasonings and also didn't have the cotija cheese. Nor did I have parm. cheese, but I did have asiago, which tasted great with my concoction of spices. Thanks for the recipe!

My corn was just ok.  This is most likely due to the fact I did not have access to a grill and had to put them into the oven.  I will only try this recipe again if I can use a grill.

Really fun to try something different for corn on the cob.  I cut out the butter, used parmesan cheese, and just added lime juice to the mayonnaise.  I think I would like it more with some of the spices that people suggested.

so happy to find recipe I just read it in a doctors mag while in the waiting room and couldn't remember one ingredient.  I also added chilli pepper to sauce with mayo and butter then sprinled with parm cheese.  A great tip for cooking coorn on the grill is to leave husks on then cook then when tender remove the husks easier and all hair comes off easier.

I prepared this dish, but I used frozen corn on the cob and shredded parmesan. It was still tasty. The next time the grill is fired up, I'll be sure to include this on the menu.
Thanks for the recipe.

I grew up spending summers in Saltillo, Mexico and would eat street corn. My family would tell me not to eat street food, but it was so good. This is excellent and reminds me of the corn I got there. I added a little hot Mexican chili powder.

I model my elotes after La Purisima in Monterrey, NL, MX so this feels a bit incomplete or plain (which may be better for some audiences).  Roasted corn, lime, mayo, Tajin, cotija, Valentina hot sauce, and Mexican crema are on mine, in that order.

The best way I've found to cook the corn is boil it for 5-6 minutes, then grill it to get some carmelization. Add Sriracha or chipotle peppers in adobo sauce to your mayo to make an aoli. Your guests have never had corn like this. It will change your life (a very small part of it)

Used Mexican crema instead of mayo. This one definitely depends on the corn, the second time I made it, it was inedible due to tough corn. But the first time, everyone wanted to know if there were seconds.

It came out delicious but I did make some slight changes.  I mixed the mayo with the lime juice and I added chili powder.   It certainly elevated a simple corn on the cob.  I will make again.

Hubby and I were really looking forward to this, but we were disappointed.  LIme and corn just didn't really work together for us.  Didn't like it at all.

I enjoyed this, but the family, not so much. They prefer just plain old-butter and salt on ears boiled in hot water or grilled in wet shucks if the ear of sweet corn is good. If it is great, I tend to agree with them. But since all sweet corn is not great, I can see this as being a great way to cover less than spectacular sweat corn and still make it interesting/appetizing. (Problem is not knowing which you have until you bite into it.) I would definitely try to combine with a good Mexican meal of some sort.

Wonderful recipe - for time's sake, I had to make some changes. I started with 6 cans of sweet corn, drained.  I stirred together 1 stick of melted butter, 1/2 c of mayo, more or less; 3/4 c. Parmesan (no Cotija cheese available), a splash of lime juice, and a generous amount of Tajin seasoning. I stirred this creamy mixture into the corn and baked at 350 for 30 minutes. It is brings a really nice, summery taste! Many thanks for the original recipe!

I will start out by saying that this was delicious. I was unable to find cotija cheese so I did use Parmesan, and the flavors worked surprisingly well together. I did use a bag of frozen corn and cooked it on the stove instead of grilling it due to time constraints. I definitely want to try this grilled next time. We will definitely be doing this again! Thank you so much for the recipe!

I adapted this to make similar to my friend's recipe. I used the butter, mayonnaise, lime juice, chili powder, and Parmesan cheese! So delicious. Might add cumin next time.

It was pretty good. I felt it needed something more. Not sure what. I had to cool it a little longer than 10 min to get a mice char. Now what do I do with all the Cojita cheese that is left over?

I made the corn by baking with husks on (trimmed)  at 350 for 30 minutes  (which is the best way I have ever found) then shucked the corn and used butter, the mayo/lime sauce. Also a mix of grated Parmesan/Romano cheese before topping with the spices. We LOVED this recipe!

I have been making this for a while and my family loves it. We are divided though on the cheese. Some of us prefer parmesan and some like the Mexican cheese. Either way you can't go wrong.

Following another reviewers method, I wrapped each shucked, buttered ear in foil and grilled for about 30 minutes.  Added the rest of the delicious ingredients once cooked.  Served in the foil packet!  This is our new addiction!!

My opinion...don't be afraid of too much chili powder when making. Also, I needed to cook closer to one hour (but everyone's ovens are a little different). IT WAS A BIG HIT THOUGH. EVERYONE LOVED IT!

Love how this turned out, although I've only eaten via canned corn. For those that can't find Cotija cheese, Parmesan sprinkles work just as good!

I too added spices. An excellent treat, but it's better when you add spice. Also, a very pretty dish to serve.

I made this for my Granddaughter's 10th birthday dinner. The kids are all picky eaters and don't like very many vegetables. They loved this one. This one is a keeper!!!

The recipe, as written, has so much butter & mayo we could not taste the flavor of the corn. I recommend cutting butter and mayo in half, absolutely use the lime, parmesean works fine, and cumin is a nice addition.

Finally tried this. Yes, I followed advice of other reviewers and mixed mayo w/ lime juice and sprinkled corn with cayenne pepper and cumin. Also totally skipped butter (I actually forgot the butter, but then realized that it was not necessary). This was met with skepticism, but was quickly devoured. So quickly that not everyone got to try it! Will definitely be making this again.

Whole family loved this. Was really quick and tasty. I used the Mexican cheese it asked for and it really makes the difference. If ur making this you must use the cheese it asked for. I found it in Walmart so it shouldn't be that hard to find it.

My favorite way to make corn on the Cobb ! The sauce is so deliciously addictive! I add a little smoked paprika , cayenne and chili powder - sends the sauce to the moon . The recipe as written is fantastic just noting some tasty changeups !

I love this recipe. Though I leave the husks on and just remove the silk. I soak it in a bag of water for an hour or so and then I put the whole thing on the grill to cook. Sweet and juicy!

The best! I didn't have the Mexican cheese so used a mild feta. I oiled the corn and BBQ for about 12 min but keep turning it!

This is really good. Almost as good as the elote mans.  I add chili powder to mine, the spicier the better. We sometimes boil the corn because we live in Phoenix and it's just too hot to barbecue in the summer. If you can find real Mexican corn, the kind that is white and not sweet, it will taste a lot better. The butter is not essential, we usually leave it out and just use mayonnaise but then again I know people who leave out the mayo and just use butter.  Either way, just leave the condiments out and have each person prepare theirs according to their taste

I gave this recipe 4 stars for giving me the idea. I skipped the butter, but added Franks hot sauce, cumin, and smoked paprika to the mayo.then I coated in that delicious cheese. It was to die for. My family loved it and voted this the only way they want corn on the cob from now on!

Delicious. I cut the corn off the cob after grilling & mixed in the other ingredients. Didn't have cotija cheese so I substituted fresh parmesan. Good w/o the lime, which I didn't have on hand. Grilling until lightly charred added a delicious element to the corn!
P.S I'm not an EXPERT as I accidently used in my profile. Must figure out how to change.

This is the 1st time I tried and I love it!!!
I grilled corns on George Foreman Grill about 15minutes. Don't forget to roll the corn a quarter turn so it cooks evenly. 
Spread the mayo and sprinkle smoke paprika and a little bit of cayan paper. Finally squeeze a wedge of lime! Yumm!!
I omitted butter and cheese. Healthy and yummy!! :)

Elote is THE BEST, and this is a good basic recipe to get you started with the concept. Upon eating this, my husband said "I'm done with regular corn on the cob. I'll never eat it again. What's the point?" We've been eating and loving elote all summer.

I have made this many times & found that you really don't need the butter.  Cotija cheese is a MUST if you want to make Mexican corn.  Yes, Parmesan is good also, but not the same, & not Mexican.  I also do this with corn off the cob-it's amazing!

I now have to try this with lime!! I have been making it a lot recently, it becomes one of those recipes you crave for no reason. The reason for only 3 stars is that your supposed to use Mexican La Crema, mayo is not the authentic way, and Tapatio hot sauce. Quick tip.. if pressed for time, make a "salad" with frozen corn and it is just as good.

My husband and 2 toddlers LOVED these. I oven-roasted the corn in their husks at 350 for 25 minutes because I am too lazy to grill. I sprinkled my hubby's with hot chili pepper but gave my 2 preschoolers the corn without chili. All loved it and went back for seconds. 5 stars!

just plain old good stuff!!! We make this almost every summer. If you don't have the cotija cheese which can be hard to find depending on where you live, you can substitute parmesan. YUM.

Family loved this.  Completely different than what we would usually have.  My only recommendation is to make sure you get your corn when it is in season.  Our corn wasn't the best.  Will definately make it again!

This has become a summer staple with my family.  Sometimes we eat it with cookout, sometimes by itself!  Thanks for sharing.

I too was a little leary of using mayo but this turned out great.  I made this with corn off the cob and used Mrs. Dash's extra spicy seasoning and shredded parmesan cheese.  The whole family loved it.

O MAN!  This is just like you get at mexican food stands, and sooo good.  Sprinkle w/ cayenne for an added kick, but doesn't need it.  For lower fat, use Mayo made w/ canola oil.

Excellent dish even though I made some changes. I left out the mayo and sprinkled some chili powder on the corn for more flavor per other reviews. Also used grated parmesan cheese instead of the cotija.

I've had this before about 10 years ago.  I never knew what it was called and having moved from the state where I got it, have never seen it since!  I'm currently 5 months pregnant and have been craving THIS and lucky for me I found it!  It was JUST like how I remembered.  IMO, I would leave out the parm cheese.  I also add a dash of chili powder on the top just for an extra splash of color and a big pop in taste! YUM!!

Mmmmmm! This was sooo good! I'm not a fan of eating corn right off the cob, so I boiled the ears first, put them on the grill to get some char marks, and then cut the corn off the cob. I mixed the butter, mayo and some chili powder in a bowl, and then mixed the corn it. I then mixed in some parmesan. I know some people said parmesan wasn't good in it, but I used a high quality grated one and thought it was very good. I was testing out the recipe on my husband for possible use at a bbq this weekend, and this was definitely a winner!

I never knew grilling corn on the cob would be so much easier. I put them on the grill with the husks on, and grilled them until the husks were burned and falling off. Then I made the sauce that SKHOUSTO suggested, only I mized it all together. I found that I didn't like the sauce on the elote, but the sauce was perfect as a condiment on my garden burger!

Once you try corn on the cob this way, you will never want corn any other way. Delish! Recently, I didn't have the mexican white cheese and substituted shredded mozzerella. The flavor is pretty close as mozz is also a mild tasting cheese. Parm is too strong and overpowering, not even comparable to the sweet and creamy taste of this recipe... I'm drooling on my keyboard.

This was awesome! I made it tonight for two hungry men and myself, and we all devoured it! I used ground Parmesan cheese and couldn't find the chili powder, but the dried red pepper flakes made it quite spicy enough!

This recipe sounds so strange, but it is delicious. I even make it with boiled corn. I usually use parmasean cheese because I always have that on hand, and I never serve it with lime.

Surprisingly delicious.  Even for those that are not regularly a fan of mayo. The cojita cheese was the ticket.  I served these at a family dinner along with the Taquiera Style Tacos from this site.  A fantastic combination.  My brother in law is from Mexico and was so pleased with the corn.  He had told us about the mayo with corn thing before and we all thought it sounded yucky.  After reading the reviews I decided to give it a try.  Wow, so glad I did!  And my brother in law told me it was dead on to the way he ate it in Mexico.  Awesome.

I make this all the time! You would think this combonation doesn't go very well, but it's SOO good. In winter we use canned corn. I also use Parmesan cheese and cheyenne pepper. To cut out the fat, I do not add butter to mine, but the hubby loves it on his!

After looking at theingredients for this recipe, I HAD to try it.  I had a hard time imagining it being good, but I was pleasantly surprised!  I think if I didn't know it was smothered in mayo, I would have enjoyed it better but even with that in mind, I did like it.  My hubby and kids loved it!  Just make sure you wipe your babes clean after dinner--  Thank you for sharing!

I had this for the first time from a street vendor in Los Angeles and just fell in love with it.  I have a hard time finding cotija cheese in Detroit, so I just sub parmesan instead ... I've fed this to quite a few skeptical people, who in the end, really liked this recipe.  I'll keep making corn this way!
