I have been making this recipe for the past 3 or 4 Christmases - family and friend just LOVE them.  However, I too have had the problem others describe with crumbly cookies.  I've tried all sorts of things to avoid it and nothing has worked... until today.  I make several other biscotti recipes and noticed this year that this recipe calls for double the amount of baking powder.  So I made my last batch of these cookies with half the baking powder.  VOILA!!  Perfect cookies!!  Give it a try.  Great recipe.  By the way, I've made this recipe with all sorts of different types of chocolate and nuts - all great.

Very impressive cookie! I made this for gifts at Christmas for teachers and friends, (along with a home made cappuccino mix.)  It received rave reviews.  Personally, I thought it was a bit too sweet with all the chocolate chunks, so I would reduce them slightly next time. I also tried replacing some chunks with Whole unblanched almonds and it made for a very pretty cookie with the contrasting light nuts and white chocolate in the dark cookie dough. I'll make this again and again!  Definately wait the hour (even a half hour) to cut these before the second bake.  Cutting them while hot will guarantee a crumbly mess. AND you must use a very good, very sharp knife.  It makes a huge difference.

This recipe was my first try at making biscotti. Everyone loved these.  I really didn't know what to expect.  I kept reading reviews about it being difficult to cut them for the second baking.  They are a little fragile, but with the right knife, they are not hard to do at all.  The first time I made them was kind of trial by error, but they are not hard just a little time consuming.  Like making bread.  I found that shaping the batter was easy to do if you wrap it in waxed paper, then you can push and flatten without a mess.  I used a ruler to make sure I had the proper size for baking, so that on the second baking they would be crisp and dry as they should be.  All in all, my family and friends loved them.  You need a little extra time to make them, but they are worth it.

My mom makes biscotti for me every Christmas.  When I ran out I thought I should try making some myself.  I did a search for chocolate biscotti in allrecipes and this one appealed to me the most.  I didn't have white chocolate squares and used about 1/3 cup white chips instead.  They are a really nice contrast against the dark biscotti.  I baked mine at 350 instead of 375 for twenty minutes.  I also sliced mine after only cooling for 15 minutes (I might only wait 10 minutes next time as the longer you wait the more crumbly they are).  I then baked the slices at 325 for only 5 minutes per side.  They are perfect.  Great for dunking in tea.  My kids aren't fans of biscotti as biscotti really needs dunking but I let them have the ends of the logs after the first baking.  They liked them like that (they said they tasted like brownies).  My dad says he enjoys these more than my mom's.  Sorry mom - I still want some of yours next Christmas!

Excellent!  First try at Biscotti baking and this was not only good, but easy.  I substituted white chips for the white chocolate and it worked out just great!

Absolutely delicious. I love the fact that these can made for like 5% of what biscotti costs in coffee houses. Speaking of coffee houses, if you want your biscotti as crispy as it is at coffee houses, definitely go for the 25 minutes. I pulled em out right at 20 when the toothpick first came out clean, and then had to add extra time in the second bake. They still aren't quite as crispy as coffee house biscotti, but they're still absolutely delicious. Who would have ever guessed that biscotti could be so easy to make at home?

Baked up very nicely.  For the second baking I left them in for the specified time, then turned the oven off and left them in for about another 15 minutes.  Crisp beautiful cookies.  Very elegant desert served in a fancy glass with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and two cookies! A HUGE winner!!!!

Yummo!  This is the first biscotti recipe I have made and I am very pleased with the results.  I think this batch tastes better than any I've ever bought.  Prior to choosing this particular recipe, I reviewed MANY biscotti recipes online. I made a couple of changes based on other recipes, suggested changes, and high reviews.  Instead of allowing the loaves to cool for one hour prior to slicing, I cut them after only 15 min of cooling.  Also, I put them back in the oven for 10 minutes on each side instead of 5.  I like my biscotti very crispy and these are perfect! They are delicious and I can't wait to share them.

I thought this was very good, though I preffered the coconut walnut biscotti better (just preference), but thought this recipe was still worth 5 stars.  As for texture, sometimes you need to ignore the recipe and go with what feels right.  I had to adjust the flour to get the consistency right.  If you've never made biscotti before, to form it into a log it should be firm but not crumbly.  Yet, it definietly  shouldn't stick to your fingers.  I preferred to dip this biscotti in chocolate (did both dark and white) to give it an extra sweetness.  Tip: Use a ruler to help shape the biscotti: use the flat side of a normal 12 inch ruler and "scrape" the biscotti into shape on a flat (preferably cold) countertop. This way you can tell just how thick and how flat the biscotti is; if that made any sense.

This biscotti recipe is the very best chocolate one I've tried. Its not too sweet, and the blend of semi-sweet and white chocolate provide great flavor. Follow the recipe exactly, cut with a serrated knife and you will have one the the best textured and flavored biscotti you've ever eaten! Thanks Janet.

Great biscotti recipe - very chocolatey and not overly sweet!  I added a Tbsp. of vanilla and used miniature chocolate chips but other than that, didn't change a thing. Be sure to let the biscotti cool before cutting or it will crumble. I drizzled it with some additional white chocolate - delicious!

I had never made biscotti before, but had read enough to know that I should be very worried about creating a crumbly mess.  My worries were for nothing- these turned out perfectly!  I did allow them to cool for about 15 minutes before slicing and I used an electric knife to slice- which probably helped with the crumble factor.  This recipe is excellent and I will definitely use it again.  They're actually better a few days out than they are fresh.  Thanks, Janet!

Fabulous!!! I used dark cocoa powder, coarse-chopped macadamia nuts, "swirls" morsels and mini morsels of dark chocolate and they came out dark and beautiful, not too sweet.  The smaller the added morsels, the less likely you will break up the cookie when you cut it.  I suggest you shape the logs into even, flat-topped bricks (3"X9")inside of parchment paper.  If you straighten the edges and flatten the top and sides, they will transfer easily to the baking sheet and cut perfectly.  Use a bread knife to saw slowly through the loaf to make perfect cookies.  I doubled the recipe with no adverse affects.  Yum!

I've been making biscotti for years, but wanted chocolate biscotti this year and thought I'd try these.  These are flavorless - I was so disappointed. Definitely needs more cocoa or something! Dipping them in chocolate didn't help either.

They should call these triple chocolate biscotti since there are two kinds of chips and the cocoa!  The dough was very sticky, so I refrigerated it for about an hour and then floured my hands in order to press the dough into logs.  My husband can't tolerate white chocolate so I substituted 4 oz of sliced almonds which went very nicely with the chocolate flavor.  He LOVED them, but I thought they were just OK, so I'm giving these 4 stars.

OHHHHHHH!!!!!!  YUM-MEEEE!!!! These are just amazing! super easy to make and do NOT miss the step of putting the dough in the fridge for 10 minutes! It firms up nicely, then WET your hands andand it is then super easy to shape the logs on the cookie sheet - I put mine on parchment paper to bake. Fabulous flavour! Thanks for the recipe! Will definitely make AGAIN!!!

Great - everyone who tries these loves them!  I half the baking powder, substitute chopped almonds for the white and chocolate chips, and use a ziplock bag with a hole cut in the corner to drizzle white chocolate on top.  I had never made biscotti before trying these but the recipe is pretty straightforward.  Thank you for sharing, Janet!

I have made these a few times and they always turn out perfectly. They taste as good on the fourth day as they did on the first. Usually I add pecans and a tsp of vanilla, and I cut them about 10 minutes after I take them out of the oven.  I have never had any problems with crumbling. Great recipe.

This is remarkably good, considering the unconventional method...  It would be helpful to include whether or not this calls for American or European style cocoa.  Take care to watch the white chocolate from burning.  Very nice recipe.  Thanks!

I love this recipe!
I've made it a dozen times and give them away as gifts to friends and family. They're that good!
I use 2 king size Hershey bars of chocolate with almonds, chop them up and throw in the batter instead of the chocolate chips and white chocolate; The recipe is very forgiving for the extra chocolate I put in. If I'm feeling fancy I'll melt chocolate and dip the cookies in it too, but these are awesome as is.
I also had some issues with it being crumbly until I started using a sharper knife and waited the whole hour to cut. 
As far as rolling it out I wait the ten minutes for it to get cold in the fridge and flour a giant wooden chopping block, then roll it out into a log as fast as I can.
Really simple, delicious cookies that I can make for a fraction of what coffee shops sell them for. (&put in way more chocolate too!)

I made this tonight and was very happy with it. I did struggle with it crumbling a little when I cut it and after I did the 2nd baking on one side, it was even more crumbly, so I didn't flip it. The taste was delicious and I used both white chocolate and semi-sweet, along with some blanched slivered almonds. I'm getting ready to dip it in some decaf...YUM!

I made these with the suggestion of cutting the baking powder in half and I only cooled them for about 12 minutes after the 1st baking and then cut them into slices. I think cooling them for the hour that the recipe suggested could contribute to the crumbling problem others are having because they are cooling too much and are not as soft when slicing them. I also added a little vanilla to the recipe, and after cooling them after 2nd baking I dipped the bottoms into melted chocolate.  Very yummy!

AMAZING!!!! Biscotti is one of my specialties and this recipe is great! I think the key is to use really good quality chocolate chips, I used Bernard Callebaut chocolate chips both white and dark and this biscotti turned out to be by far the best chocolate biscotti I have ever made. I think next time I might use only dark chocolate and add maraschino cherries into the mix.

This makes a fantastic chocolate biscotti.  It’s not as crunchy as other biscotti but has excellent chocolate flavor.  I followed the recipe with the exception of not adding white chocolate morsels but added some chopped walnuts.

This is over the top good!!!!!  I'm always trying to cut down on the sugar and I was able to use about 1/3 less  with good results.  I did the whole thing in my kitchenaid mixer without a problem, although the batter is thick.  I used parchment paper instead of greasing the pans and it worked very well.

Very unhappy with this recipe. It's not biscotti. It's too soft, way too crumbly. Probably makes a good cookie.

This was my very first shot at making Biscotti - daughter had to have an authentic Italian food for a project at school.  I read all the hints and tips plus I watched a couple Youtube videos showing how to handle the dough, etc.  Turned out excellent and had several moms ask for the recipe.  My daughters asked me to make it again for the family this time.

Liked this recipe but needs more chocolate flavor. I omitted the chocolate chips and added one cup of chopped hazelnuts.

I have loved this recipe for years. I first got it from this site several years ago before I had a printer for my computer, so I copied it by hand to a recipe card.  It is among the most cherished in my kitchen!  Although I like eating them as biscotti, and they are excellent, I also love to make them into drop cookies and cook them for just the first bake time.  The result is a rich but not too sweet, melt-in-your-mouth cookie with the perfect crumb.  Yum-o!!!

Taste and texture were perfect. Did not have the problems I have heard of in other biscotti recipes. I did add 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp almond extract to recipe and used special dark cocoa powder for an extra rich chocolate taste. I also only added 1/2 cup chocolate chips and added 1/2 cup pecans, but that is just my personal taste. I drizzled melted pink candy melts over the cooled cookies for Valentine's Day. Got rave reviews and was asked for the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I've been using this recipe for a while.  We make it exactly as suggested sometimes and sometimes I use mini chocolate chips instead of suggested and add 1 1/2 t almond extract and 1/2 c almonds. Either way my friends and family love it with their favorite cup of coffee!

These have a nice flavor, not too sweet but next time I would omitt the white chocolate because it really had no flavor to me.  Definitely do not wait an hour to cut, I do it as soon as it's out of the oven, use two long spatullas to lift it off the pan, use a towel to hold and cut with a serated knife and start putting them back in the oven! This usually reduces the crumbling. Great recipe but still favor Jandee's "Biscotti" recipe, maybe the difference is oil vs. butter!

We've got a winner here!  This biscotti will knock their socks off.  For my first attempt, it was very easy to prepare, however I had trouble getting 12 out of each log.  Practice will make perfect.  The taste and appearance it there.  THANK YOU!

Seriously delicious! Mine cracked and crumbled when I cut them. No, I didn't let the logs cool for a full hour before cutting...I need someone to give me some tips. Mine might not have turned out very pretty, but they sure taste good!

Love, love, love the taste - but like other reviewers, my biscotti ended up being very crumbly (I did follow other reviewers' suggestions and only used half the baking powder). And watch your fingers when handling the warm biscotti - hot chocolate bits stick to fingers (a tasty problem though!).

First, the taste of these is really delicious. Perfect for a biscotti. However, after following others suggestions and warnings as to how crumbly this is nothing helped. It crumbled and fell apart every chance possible. I was very disappointed in this recipe. I won't make it again. I followed the recipe properly, I have extremely sharp and very nice knives and I took suggestions from others as to when the best time to cut is. Nothing worked. Good luck to others.

I've never made biscotti in my life and shied away from it because I thought it was going to be difficult.  I took the bull by the horns and decided to make this for our cookie plate for Christmas dinner.  It was SO EASY!  It cut like a dream using a serrated bread knife and though crunchy, it's not so crunchy as to crack a tooth like some biscotti I've eaten.  Not over sweet, would be wonderful dipped in coffee or hot chocolate.  So much for Christmas...I made them two days ago and they're gone.  Guess I'm making more.  Thanks for an easy and pretty fool-proof recipe!

Very good biscotti recipe.  After reading reviews, I did take the temp down to 300 on the second round.  I ended up with a crunchy yet semi-soft biscotti that wouldnt break your teeth when biting into :).  5 stars!

Having made various kinds of biscotti I would have to say this is one of the better receipes.  The dough was easy to work with and did not stick to my hands, however I ended up adding 2 cups of flour for a little bit of a stiffer dough.  Also added 1/2 cup of cocoa powder because I love a deep chocolate taste.  Wanting to develope even deeper taste I used 1/3 lt brown sugar and 1/3 white sugar.  Believe me you won't be sorry.  This cookie is wonderful because it's not too sweet like some other receipes I have made.  Lastly not sure how but I only came out with 24 biscotti.  Try this cookie you won't be disappointed.

I followed some suggestions from others for my first try with this recipe.  I opted to slice after 15 minutes instead of an hour.  I had some crumbly ends but otherwise was happy with turnout. Coated the flat end in semi-sweet chocolate and drizzled white chocolate over the top ends.  Gave them plenty of drying time between steps and the result was very good for dunking. Update: cut back the baking powder to 1 tsp. Waited a little longer to cut the second time,around 25 min. Excellent results second time around.

Very good.  Almost too chocolate-y.  Will try this same dough minus the chocolate chips and with dried cherries added next time.

This is a wonderful recipe. For the second baking, we baked them for about 11 minutes "standing up," (not on one side or the other). They turned out great - not too crispy or hard. 
We also cut them about 3 minutes after taking them out of the oven the first time, using a sharp steak knife. 
The end result was delicious, both with and without coffee! We've found our baked goodies for our neighbors this year.

This worked well and the flavor was very nice. I used slightly less cocoa (personal preference) and omitted the added chocolates, instead adding 1 cup crushed slivered almonds and 1 tsp. almond extract. There is no way I could've gotten 36 biscotti from this recipe, though; I ended up with 14.

These are sweeter than the Brownie Biscotti, however, they are yummy!  I've eaten 3 already and need to stop!  I used mini semi sweet chips as that is what I had and I chopped my baker's white chocolate bars as the recipe stated.  I'm becoming the biscotti queen, I want to keep on making them and not stop!  lol

I have read and re-read at least 30 different biscotti recipes (on more than just allrecipes) and tried others to see why this one was so crumbly. I also tried waiting 30 minutes for one loaf (as 1 reviewer suggested) and only a few minutes for the other log as another reviewer suggested, both times using a very sharp serrated knife. There was no difference, they were both crumbly and I lost around 10-15% of the cookies. It was suggested that perhaps the amount of liquid makes a difference (maybe an extra egg could help?) but nearly all the other biscotti recipes had the same approx. 2 cups flour:2 eggs ratio and not many issues with crumbling. Next time I think I'll try the extra egg. Very good cookie but I'm unsure I could give it as a gift because of appearance.

Very easy and quick compared to normal biscotti recipes. The only minor complaint I have is that when I turned the biscotti on the trays, they crumbled. Despite of that, they are DELICIOUS!

I liked this better than "brownie biscotti." I used only semi-sweet chips-no white chocolate. Turned out just crispy enough, but not hard.

Fantastic biscotti.  I doubled the recipe and only got about 4 dozen.  I like a softer cookie, so on the second baking, I baked for 9 minutes and removed from the over, for me the flipping and third bake was not necessary.

This was my first time making biscotti and it turned out great!  I only added 1 tsp baking powder based on previous reviews.  They weren't too hard or too soft.  So yummy dipped in coffee or tea!  I read online that to ensure they are crispy enough, let them cool overnight in the oven then put them in an airtight container.  This is what I did and they were perfect!

This is a good Biscotti.  I used unsalted butter, omitted the baking powder altogether (you don't want 'fluffy'), used a good quality Dutch processed cocoa and Ghiradrlli white and mini chocolate chips.  To compliment the chocolate flavor, I added 2 tablespoons of orange zest.  Before baking, I rolled each part in a mixture of granulated sugar and finely ground almonds.  Totally excellent flavor.

Delicious!  I didn't have any white chocolate so I left that out and added chopped almonds instead.  Loved the combination of the chocolate and almonds.  This is definitely the best biscotti recipe I've ever made.

Love this recipe. I will keep making this over and over. I substituted 1 1/4 cups mini semi-sweet chocolate chips since I do not like white chocolate, and they came out perfect. Just really watch them in the oven in the last few minutes of the second cooking. They go from done to overdone very quickly, especially if your baking sheet isn't really high quality.

I am not the biscotti eater in the family, so I can only rate this on how well the recipe went for me as far as preparation, which was very smoothly.  Biscotti is a bit time consuming to make with the double baking and slicing, but I wouldn't say it was difficult.  This dough came together nicely and baked perfectly. I gave this away in gift baskets and everyone said they enjoyed it. Thanks!

They tasted soooo good, but I ran into trouble making them. I cut the baking powder in half as suggested. When I put the loaves in the oven, they burned within 10 min. I don't know why :( I quickly flipped the loaves over, and lowered the oven to 350 F, and continued with the rest of 10 min. After I took them out of the oven, I sliced them into half inch slices, and sliced off the burned side. Then baked them right away at 325 for 9 min. No crumbling. So no need to wait. Just need to watch the initial first bake oven temp.  Will definitely make again.

These were just ok.  I like my chocolate biscotti with more chocolate.  Maybe it's the ingredients.  I got a great chocolate biscotti from Gina's Homemade in Scottsdale.  Those biscotti rocked. I got the biscotti in a gift basket along with pizzelle.  I wish I had their recipe.

Of course anything with chocolate chips in it won't taste bad, but I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out way too cake-like and not firm like real biscotti.  I'm very disappointed in how they turned out and would be very afraid to dunk one of them into my coffee, for fear of it dissolving.  An excellent biscotti recipe at allrecipes.com is called "Biscotti" by Jandee (I don't know this person in any way, by the way).

LOVED this recipe. followed the ingredients to a "t" but did change the amount of time i baked them for. I know that biscotti is supposed to be super crispy but i wanted mine a little softer. Drizzled with white chocolate, you'd swear they were store bought. i will definitely be making this again, probably this evening if my family likes them as much as i think they will!

These are awesome. I followed another reviewers advice and only used 1 tsp of baking powder. This worked out perfectly and were't crumbly at all. I used 3/4 cup white chocolate chips instead of the squares. Very yummy!

This was my 2nd time making Biscotti.  I added chopped dried cherries instead of the white chocolate chips.  They did get a little too dark on the bottom cause my oven runs very hot at the bottom and tends to burn things before it cooks the rest of it (woo for a stove that must be from the 40's or 50's...).  I ate them all plain and all by myself.  Was a very easy recipe.

I am on a low carb diet, and I modified this to suit my needs. It still tastes great! Here is what I did: I substituted 2 C. of almond flour for all of the flour. I used splenda instead of the sugar, and I didn't use the chocolate chunks or chips. Great results! Thanks for the basic recipe which inspired me!

This is a tasty biscotti, but it does not have the texture of a traditional biscotti cookie.  For me, it was too crumbly and not as "hard" as it should be.  My cookies fall apart when dunked in espresso.  The cookie does taste very good - very chocolatey but it will fail to impress a real italian.

I only gave this 4 stars, because they were just alright.  I think it is my personal preference.  I guess I just prefer Biscotti "not so sweet"  They were good but for me not my favorite.  I did everything like I should and I was in Biscotti mode, I made three separates receipes today, so I know what i am doing - yet these were very soft when it came to the second cooking and hard to flip you had to be extremely gentle when flipping them.  They started crumbling.  When they were finished in the second cooking, I just took the pans out and left them sitting on the counter for two hours, they seemed to have improved once they air dried.

I have made this biscotti 3-4 times.  I use a mix of semi sweet chips, milk chocolate chips and white chips.  I melt some of the white chips after the biscotti cools and drizzle it over.  Awesome

Great Biscotti. I added 1/2 tsp. of almond extract because that is very traditional in biscotti. I also had to leave in the oven longer after the second bake. Turned oven off and left in their for 25 minutes. Excellent! I will be giving these as gifts this Christmas!

This is great and easy to make! I didn't have white chocolate on hand so I used swirled chocolate chips and it still came out great! Melted chocolate and flavored it with peppermint extract, dipped the bottom half of cookie in the chocolate to finish them off- made them look so nice and even better flavor. Will definately be a regular on my holiday baking list!

Excellent flavor! Everyone that tried them loved them!  The dough is easy to work with. I used the new Hershey Special Dark cocoa for the extra rich flavor.

Great biscotti recipe! I substituted pecans for the white chocolate and they were a huge hit. If you like a traditional flavor these are wonderful. However be sure not to overbake - when your toothpick comes up dirty you may have hit a chocate chip so prick a few more times for good measure.

Excellent recipe!! Thank you very much. My grandma gave me some white chocolate, and I had nothing to do with it (not much of a fan of white choc.) But it tastes wonderful in this recipe. The flavour is just wonderful. Great with a cup of coffee :)

I found that using a serated knife to slice the biscotti makes it much easier.

Very nice!  I used White Choc. Chips instead of the squares.  Giving them out at a bake exchange so they're in the freezer, but will drizzle with white chocolate (or maybe even both) before giving away.  I messed up the oven temp. so they came out almost burned, but apparently they taste good so I will make again properly this time :).

Easy to make, but be sure to cut shortly after removing from the oven so they don't crumble.

This is my first time making biscotti. I didn't have a problem making the dough however I wasn't sure how wide I should roll it after the dough is divided to two parts. (It only mentions 9" tall). It turned out for me like the thinkness of a cookie but it taste great. i.e. it didn't self-rise at all. Anyone has some advise for me?

This is probably one of the best recipes for biscotti I have tried in a long time.  I used chocolate chunks and toasted hazelnuts instead of the white chocolate.  This is my new fave recipe!  Very easy!

This is a wonderful recipe. I made a batch of these last weekend and will be making a double batch of them this weekend. I had some leftover peanut butter chips and white chocolate chips, so I used a quarter cup of each of these and a half cup of semisweet chips, skipping the chopped white chocolate. My opinion is that any type of chocolate is good chocolate!

This was my first attempt at making biscotti, and it turned out great. My family raved about these chocolate-lover's cookies, and I've passed the recipe on to them. The only changes I made were to use egg substitute instead of the eggs, and Splenda in place of the white sugar. I'll definitely be making this recipe again, and it stores and ships very well.

This is an excellent recipe!  I made it 3 times during the holidays.  Very rich flavor.  I used white chocolate chips, and only 1/4 of the amount that the recipe called for.  I didn't want them to be too sweet.  MMMmmmm good!  I will make this recipe often. This cookie keeps well.

I made for a progressive dinner party- I was in charge of dessert. Everyone loved the biscotti. I used a dark metal cookie sheet and reduced the cook time as it started to burn. I also dipped an end in white and milk chocolate for extra flavor.

After reading reviews that stated there wasn't enough chocolate, I doubled it using a half cup.  If you want chocolate, you usually want lots of it !  Instead of using the powdered Hersheys, I used bars of gourmet Chocolate and ground them up in my Ninja. I did not add the white chocolate.  To me that stuff is just just fake vanilla chips haha.  I threw in the chocolate chips and  chopped walnuts.  Oh my gosh it tasted like fudge brownies .  I forgot to mention that I upped the sugar to one whole cup.  I did have to leave mine in the oven for a longer period of time.....and additional 9 minutes.  Mind you each oven will be different.  Just watch them.  After they cooled I dipped the bottom half of mine in melted gourmet chocolate thinned with cream and sprinkled chopped walnuts on top. Supper yummy recipe with the changes I made.

I loved this chocolate biscotti recipe. I switched the semi sweets for Milk chocolate only. Skipped out on the white. Cut them while still warm which made it very easy to cut! I've made Biscotti many times over the years. I always cut while warm because it is easier to cut that way.  This recipe was easy and very good!

Delicious and easy recipe.  I added a bit more cocoa powder, some salt and I used Andes baking bits instead of chocolate morsels and they taste great.  I melted some of the Andes bits and drizzled over the cookie and they are amazing!

I've made this recipe dozens of times. Some tips from my experiences: 1) I use baker's sugar; I always found regular sugar to make the cookies too hard. 2) I add toasted almonds and/or toasted coconut to gild the lily. 3) I use a Henkels serrated bread knife to cut the cookies. This is especially critical if you have hard ingredients such as almonds in the dough.

So yummy! I will try Amy's suggestion of 1/2 the baking powder to make them less crumbly.

I used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder and the dark chocolate bits....I didn't have white chocolate but I had a bag of Dove dark chocolate squares with peppermint bark. I cut the squares up and used them in place of the white chocolate. They are delicious!! Only thing, they did spread out quite a bit and the slices are much longer than I would have liked. I think next time I will make the logs longer...I did 9 inches as the recipe stated. But it still gets 5 stars for taste.

I made these over Christmas, with other biscotti, and forgot to rate them. Anyways, these were good. I thought they were more like a biscotti brownie in flavor. For the semi-sweet chocolate I had used a mix of semi-sweet and milk chocolate. I had liked that these were not excessively sweet.

This is a great biscotti. The dough is easy to work with you can change the white chocolate to all dark or vice versa. Or add nuts instead. I did not find it at all soft or crumbly. Bakes up very well. Rather than used greased sheets, I mix and bake it on parchment - easy peasy clean up!

I loved this recipe! This was my first go at making biscotti and I found it brilliantly simple and easy to follow and it was absolutely delish! I made a little modification in terms of sweetness - I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of 2/3 cups of white sugar. And followed the advise of another user and reduced the baking powder to 1-1.5 tsp. Thank you for sharing this recipe Janet!

This was the first time I ever baked biscotti & although it's not perfect, I am pleased enough to try this recipe again. I was trying to make this recipe just a little healthier by changing 1/2 cup of butter to 2 tbsp & adding 1/2 cup of mashed ripe bananas. It gave it a banana-y flavor but I personally liked it. Not bad at all if you're looking for something different than the typical cookie or brownie! :)

Easy to put together, but it crumbled when I sliced it. It was quite crisp enough for a biscotti, but still delicious.

I just tried this recipe. Very easy to make and very good. But I did find I had to leave them in the oven just a bit longer to harden. I had no problems like some others with crumbling. I will make these again.

These were good. I followed the recipe exactly, including cooking times, except I added almonds as well as the chocolate chips. Not as crunchy as some other biscotti recipes.

I made this white chocolate chips and replaced the semisweet with chopped walnuts. And I halved the baking powder as recommended. Not bad. A recipe to play with. :)

Loved this recipe...made them for Valentine's day for my sweetie. I ran a "tunnel" in the middle and put raspberry jam in them. They went over really well! Next time I will do the flour by feel as the they were really hard to get to stay in the log formation.  Ultimately use really great cocoa and the flavor will reward you! Decedent!!!

Very easy, very tasty, and yields a good amount of tender-crisp dark brown biscotti.  I love this recipe!  The only mod I made was I inverted the plain dough out onto some cling wrap and kneaded two large handfuls (about 1 cups worth) of semi-sweet choc chips into the dough.  Will definitely be making these again, perhaps with some dried fruit and the addition of the other types of chocolate for gifts in the future.

I substituted almonds instead of the white chocolate pieces and used dark chocolate chips. These cookies are absolutely wonderful, excellent recipe!!  As others have noted, it does take a little time to make these, but all in all it's not that hard and they are such a treat to have around. Definitely worth the effort.

Great! I love the hard cookie with the chunks of chocolate and just the right amount of sweetness. They are supposed to be hard so I like to make them a day ahead of time at least so they will harden enough by the time they are served. I found them to be too soft for biscotti when they were fresher.

I love to bake and this was an easy recipe to work with.  I didn't have any chocolate chips so I used a semi-sweet chocolate bar and chopped it up in the food processor; they turned out great and everyone that I gave them to LOVED THEM.  Thanks for the great recipe for my baking collection!

This recipe is Delicious! And Easy! I did take reviewer Amy's advice and 1/2 the Baking Powder and they turned out perfectly! With my second batch I let the dough chill for about an hour and it was a lot easier to manipulate but if you dont have the time for that it worked the other way too. This is fantastic!

I tried this recipe originally for someone who couldn't eat my standard biscotti with almonds.  I wasn't excited about it, thinking that the chocolate was be too dessert like but I was pleasantly surprised with the result.  This recipe makes a not-to-sweet Italian biscuit that is perfect with coffee, just the way biscotti should be. I made a batch again this week.  My only suggestions would be to grease up your hands before molding the loaves and maybe cook a little longer before flipping so the slices are more firm and less likely to crumble.  I also might leave out the chocolate chips and just use the white chocolate--or cut the quantity.

This is a nice crunchy cookie. I found that while I was cutting them they would break apart me sometimes so make sure you make them thick slices.It had a very chocolate flavor to them and tasty great right after they were dipped into chocolate while the chocolate was still nice and runny.

I just discovered the joy of biscotti the other day and I am totally addicted. Granted this is the first biscotti I have ever made but to me it was really good. It was chocolately enough and sweet enough that I could taste it but subtle enough that it blends well with the coffee.

They looked nice and smelled great, but the 2 t. of baking soda gave it an aftertaste.  Cut it back to 1 t. and i'm sure they'll come out better.

This was excellent.  I gave as gifts for Christmas and people raved about them.  I thought they were pretty good tasting.  A little crumbly to cut, though.  I'll have to work on it next time.  Thanks.

I left out the white chocolate and added chopped almonds and a splash of almond extract instead.  They were delicious.  After i got the basic shape formed, i sprayed a rubber spatula w/ nonstick spray and smoothed the loafs out.  It worked like a charm!  I did have trouble cutting them though, a few fell apart, but it may have been my knifes fault.  Use a super sharp knife!

Much like the "chocolate dipped orange biscotti" the dough was a pain in the hoo-ha to work with, but the results were delicious.  
Make these only if you're willing to get messy for some good biscotti!

Pretty good :).  I used pecans instead of white chocolate--I don't like white chocolate that much and I love nuts--and added almond extract, so there was just the slightest bit of almond flavor to go with the chocolate.  Mmmmm.  Even when following the suggestion of waiting only 10-15 minutes to slice the loaf, it was still fairly crumbly, but I managed to keep the slices together for the most part.  Otherwise, it's a tasty and easy recipe.

My husband actually made this in Dec. '07 "just because", and I don't usually have biscotti.  But as it turned out, this is an awesome recipe.  He had friends and relatives requesting that he make lots more.  This is a definite do over and over and over ..

I have made these three times now and they have come out better each time.  I made some changes to the recipe,  I use 2 heaping tsp of baking power, replace 3/4 of the AP with Whole Wheat Flour, and use 1oz of Andes Mint Chips.  I bake them for 25 minutes for the first bake and then allow them to cool for 30 mintues before slicing and then cool for another 30 mintues.  On the second bake I baked them for 10 minutes on each side.

I made these biscottis today along with 2 other biscotti recipese (Cinnamon Sugar Biscottis and Brownie Biscottis)& I'm proud to say that in texture & crispiness.....these are true biscottis!!!!!

After the first bake they were warm, soft & tasted like brownies! (I wonder if you could just take them out & leave them like that because if so then this would be the best brownie recipe ever along with the Brownie Biscotti recipe because after the first bake they taste the same!) But then after the second bake they got dry & crispy & got a slight bitter chocolate taste which was just fine!

The changes that I made were that instead of adding the white chocolate squares & semisweet chocolate chips I added 1/4 of a bar of Lindt's Dark Chocolate & Orange chocolate along with 1/8 of a bar of Lindt's 85% Dark Chocolate that I chopped up into chunks along with 2 tsp. of powdered sugar just so that it wasn't too bitter from all of the dark chocolate. I also added about a tablespoon or 2 of shreaded unsweetened coconut & like 5-8 hazelnuts.

The result was a very gourment TRUE BISCOTTI!!!!! (but for flavor I personally prefer the Brownie Biscotti recipe.....they really do taste like brownies! YUM-O!!!!!)

This was my first time making Biscotti. I thought it came out great. They tasted like a brownie. I thought they were sweet enough. I recommend letting them cool for the whole hour before you cut them. I did and they didn't crumble at all. I will be making them again soon to give as a gift.

This was my first time making biscotti--and they turned out great. I did make one mistake--I cooked the loaves on seperate trays, one on the top rack and one on the bottom rack. The loaf on the bottom rack burned a bit on the bottom. I was able to fix it by just scraping the bottom of the loaf with a sharp knife. Lesson learned!

I halved the recipe, to try it out. They were gone very fast. It's for chocolate lovers who don't like their cookies too heavy or too sweet. Will make again.

Very nice biscotti recipe. It wasn't too sweet for my taste and the white chocolate added the perfect hints of extra sweet to this recipe. I used white chocolate chips instead of chocolate chunks. Also it crumbled quite a bit while cutting but I managed to save a a few of them without breaking. The biscotti itself came out really nice, though a few came out brownie textured, which I believe is a fault on my part cause they were cut a bit thicker than other pieces which came out exactly like biscotti is supposed to. I enjoyed it both ways though, thanks for the post!

This recipe was really good but a LOT sweeter than any biscotti I've ever had.  I'll probably leave out almost all of the chocolate next time.

This recipe is great, I have never made biscotti before and they turned out perfect.  A couple of things I changed, would reduce the temp on the initial bake. Also I only let them cool about 15 minutes before I cut them. I also melted some dark chocolate and spread it on the top and then let them cool a   little and then dusted them with confection sugar. Awesome!!!

Delicious! I made these for a gift and they turned out beautifully... nice presentation and not too crumbly. Like previous posters have mentioned, be sure to let the cookies cool before cutting. I used miniture chocolate chips and regular sized white chocolate chips in lieu of the chopped white chocolate squares. Thanks for the recipe.

Being Italian, these biscotti's were REALLY good. They were not to sweet, satisfied my chocolate craving, and was really yummy. They were light and crisp. I left them in the oven a little longer, cause i like my biscotti on the crisper side. I also added almonds instead of white chocolate cause i did not have any. They turned out gread, and I HIGHLEY suggest them! :D CIAO

I made this for the first time yesterday for company, and the husband is allergic to nuts.  It was absolutely EXCELLENT, and a great alternative to the traditional almond variety.  The only downside is that they crumble VERY easily, so I recommend slicing them immediately upon removal from the oven.  All in all, these are great, and I will definitely make them again.

Very good overall... I probably did not cook them quite as long as I should have, since I was feeling impatient.  I ended up dipping them in some melted dark chocolate, which worked very well.  These also keep very well... mine still tasted pretty good after a couple weeks.  (Great for Christmas gifts)

I really liked this biscotti recipe.  I am not a fan of white chocolate so I used 1 heaping cup of "Double Chocolate Chips" from Ghirardelli (they're a combination of semi- and bitter-sweet chocolates) instead of the white chocolate and semisweet chips, and the biscotti were fantastic.  I followed the recipe as it's written otherwise.  I did have a bit of trouble cutting the logs into slices; some of the slices were crumbly at one end.  But they tasted great anyway...

My first try at chocolate biscotti!  Using the 2 chocolates makes it a very pleasant chocolate flavor.  Gave this as a gift and it was a definite hit!!

I have no idea if I did it wrong or not. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except for the white chocolate. I replaced that with peanuts. It seems okay, but it isn’t crisping up for the second bake and it seemed very crumbly. Should’ve stuck with what this called for lol. I bumped up the heat a bit too see if it would crisp up. But, I have a feeling these will be more crumbly than I would’ve liked...

Took longer to bake than 25 minutes prior to cutting and baking again... closer to 35 - 40... but that could be because when the dough was rolled out it was a bit thick. However, the finished product was delicious!

This is an amazing recipe. Simple ingredients, we sometimes skip the white chocolate, twice the double chocolate chips. Other times, the loaf doesn't make it to the second bake. :D

I made this recipe for a group of 13 kids, and they absolutely loved it! I wasn't able to find the white chocolate squares at the store, so I bought 4 oz. white chocolate chips and chopped them up a bit. This was so fun and easy to make; I will definitely be making these again!

Eliminated the white chocolate and used Ghirardelli's Bittersweet Chocolate chips rather than milk chocolate. It gave it more of a rich, truffle taste, which I love. Delicious!

I did make these and they turned out great. I gave it three stars only because I thought it was a little too sweet, too much chocolate. I know it really depends on the person. Give it try you may like it that way.

Being a little pressed for time, I put all the ingredients in the bread machine set to the dough cycle. After it was mixed, about 5 to 6 minutes,  it was ready to shape and bake!!! Came out perfect!!

These were very tasty.  I've made two batches for home and now I'm making this along with gingerbread biscotti for gifts.  This biscotti is definitely softer than traditional hard and crunchy biscotti, but still has great flavor.  I haven't changed the recipe at all, other than switch the order that some things were added.  Definitely worth it.

I started making this recipe because it looked and sounded good.  But then I realized it didn't call for salt.  So I went ahead and added about 3/4 tsp. salt.  Then after adding the dry ingredients to the creamed, I thought the dough was too stiff/dry.  So I added 1 tsp. almond extract and about 1/4 c. scotch whiskey. (It's the only liquor I had on hand but I'm sure rum or brandy would be great too) that made the dough more pliable and what I'm more used to for biscotti.  Oh and sorry I didn't care for white chocolate so I used mini semi-sweet morsel instead.  It came out great.  Granted I don't know what the recipe would have been like in its original form.  But I appreciate the basics of it very much. ??

very tasty. I made some changes because i wanted to use oil inplace of butter. Used 1/2 cup of oil , upped the cocoa by double and used 1 tablespoon of baking powder. Also decided to use my white chocolate for a drizzled garnish.

These are amazing! I didn't have white choc so, I subbed in 1.5 oz slivered almonds. The batter makes for a tender crisp biscotti. Very very good. Making another batch tomorrow!

This recipe is fantastic! everyone loves it, even those who don't love biscotti. The only change I made was at the end. I removed them from the oven, covered them with a towel to slow down the cooling to reduce cracking. let them cool for only 10 minutes, cut them and cooked them for 9min each side. I got this from another recipe and it worked great. I don't know that the original way would not work, but I knew this did.

Following the advice of one of the reviewers, I only added 1 tsp baking powder; following another suggestion, I cut the biscotti 15 minutes after the first baking. 
They came out absolutely delicious!! I'm adding this recipe to my permanent collection of great desserts to make.

These are perfect! I don't drink coffee so I tried dipping them in chi tea with a little pumpkin spice. The chocolate chips melted in my mounts making a great sensation. If you haven't made it, I'd recommend that you do.

Small changes, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 cup each white and chocolate chips.  Crisp but not rock hard, edible without dipping.
Tip: If you cool longer before the second bake, they will harden and break as you try to slice them. If you cool shorter before the second bake, they won't be firm and will fall apart. I slice them after 15 minutes, but do not move them! Leave them in place for another 45 minutes to let them firm up. Then separate slices and do the second baking.

So good! I do not consider myself a baker one bit, and was scared to try something so 'advanced' like biscotti. This recipe is so easy to follow, they turned out amazing!! I used milk chocolate squares instead of white because that's what we had lying around, added almonds, and halved the baking power like someone suggested in the comments. They are too die for. When shaping the dough, it helps to cool it for a bit longer, I think (15 minutes instead of 10) and shape it by putting it in plastic wrap for easy clean up. I would recommend this recipe to anyone, regardless of skill level! Delicious!

Disappointing, they crumbled and fell apart. More like a broken sour brownie bite. Not a good idea to add the chocolate chips or white chocolate because it burnt quicker. Should have read the reviews and taken the advise to use only half the amt of baking powder so it wouldn't have tasted so chalky.

Great tasting biscotti. I used hazelnuts only because I did not have white chocolate. I also only waited 10 minutes after the first baking to cut them. I thought they might be too cool to cut well after an hour. I have to admit that 2 or 3 crumbled. Other than that they were great!

My husband can't get enough chocolate so these were well received by him.  Add a cup of coffee (his other favorite thing) and he was one happy camper.

i used semi sweet and milk choc chips and did a few easier steps after initial bake...cool only 10 min and use electric knife to slice them. they still crumble a lil but not as bad as the first batch which i did exactly as written. baked 10 min turned and 10 min more. turned out just perfectly crispy and 'biscotti-ie'!

These were frustrating, but kinda worth it.  I halved the baking powder as others suggested, but they were still a bit of a pain to work with--the dough was much stickier than the other biscotti I made, and they didn't firm up too much after the first baking (the logs were like giant chocolate chip cookies).  I had planned on letting them cool for 10 minutes or so before cutting (based on the other recipe I'd made), but they were so soft, I had to wait about 40 and still had some breakage issues.  So, I don't know if I'd go through that to make them as biscotti again, though the final product was delicious.  However, I might use the recipe (baking only once) to make awesome triple chocolate chip cookies!

Finally I have to give this a review. This is the 4th time I went to this recipe. First time I used dried cherries in the recipe. Today, choc chips AND a second batch with chips & almond slivers. Everything I've done comes out great!

Fantastic recipe! Everyone loved these - even a non-biscotti person!  I make biscotti, and found that the dough wasn't stiff enough so added 1/4 c. more flour.  If you oil your work surface and hands nothing will stick.  I also have better luck cutting when the logs are still warm - less crumbs.

I made these for the second time last night and the were not really my cup of tea. I did over cook them as I was watching a movie at the same time but I think I will try something different next time when making an italian dessert.

I did break the Biscotti up and mix it in with some vanilla icecream and I thought that made them more to my liking.

Only added a pinch of salt and loved them. TO CUT - use a chef's knife and just push down through the slices, don't saw back and forth with a serrated knife. I let them cool 10-15 minutes before cutting, but didn't notice the lower temp for the 2d and 3d baking and ended up with a couple slightly burnt ends, but they were yummy dunked in coffee. I might add vanilla or powdered espresso next time, and maybe nuts and bittersweet chips. I'll definitely keep this recipe - was about to make more today but think I'll wait after just eating 5 with a pot of coffee - buzz buzz buzz!

I've always had a love/hate affair with biscotti--most times it's usually been way too dry or hard to really enjoy, but this recipe is REALLY good.  I left out the white chocolate pieces, and added premium chocolate chips, which gave the biscotti a deep, sweet chocolate taste.  My husband and mother really liked this, and a girlfriend's niece got hold of these, I'm told, and ate nothing else all night long!  Next time I make, I'm going to dredge some of the pieces in ganache and see how that works.  Thanks a million for this wonderful, good-tasting recipe!

I thought theses were good...but they did taste more like a very hard cookie (as the dough ingredients would suggest) rather than a true biscotti.  However my kids really liked these and did not need to dunk them in a hot drink to be able to chew them.

Tasted delicious, but I am too fussy to use them as gifts because they were too crumbly to be pretty.  I tried adjusting the times/temps as others have, but it did not help.  I ended up with 24 so-so looking cookies.

I was a little nervous making this, but it turned out great! It may seem at first that the biscotti is not hard enough after the final baking, but after letting it cool COMPLETELY, it is perfect!

Loved it!!!
I've made one other biscotti recipe before, and this one is by far better. I cut them aftre about 15 minutes of cooling instead of the one hour. I made sure that the consistancy was moist but not sticky. Will make this one again for sure!!!

Very good.  I saved the semi-sweet chocolate chips, and after the biscotti were done, I melted the chips and spread the melted chocolate over one half of the tops of the cookies.

Yummy.  I cut them after about 10 minutes of cooling and I did fairly well but it was tricky.  I think I lost 15% due to crumbling.  For some reason, the Cinnamon Hazelnut Biscotti were much easier to cut...  
Everyone at work loved them!

Excellent.  Made it several times.  A change from the usual drop cookie.

These biscotti are tasty, but they are not TRUE ITALIAN biscotti.  They are WAY too cakey.   Real biscotti are hard and are usually dipped in coffee.  I would not make this recipe again.

I love these! The only change I would make next time is to cut them 15 minutes after removing them from the oven. They were too crumbly after waiting an hour.

The kids had not heard of biscotti.  They just loved this one.  It was a little crumbly, but it was so moist and rich tasting.

Excellent flavor and texture. Surprisingly, the white chocolate doesn't have as much flavor as one would think having added 4 squares of chocolate. Try drizzling on melted chocolate when the baking is done, though the chocolate chips and cocoa give the biscotti enough chocolate flavor.

not quite like what I'd buy at Starbucks, but good nonetheless. I didn't add the white chocolate chips.

This is my first time baking biscotti.  I found it to be somewhat dry(but maybe it's supposed to?) and it needed some sweetness on the outside so I melted some chocolate with butter and milk and just spread it on one side of each cookie.  Much better.  Some have commented that this made it less dry which was a positive thing.  Some of the cookies crumbled upon the cutting and turning so I only ended up with 26 presentable cookies in the end.  It's still good and everyone loved it.

Tasted very good, but did not stay together at all. Biscotti crumbled at the slightest touch - would definitely not hold up for dunking. I will experiment some more, it could be my technique.

Amazing!  I made this for Christmas gifts and was sad I kept so little for myself.  The white chocolate really takes it up a notch.  The first batch I made without it weren't quite as good.

This was my first time trying biscotti, and these just didn't do it for me. The flavor is ok, but I had a very hard time slicing the "logs".. they just crumbled everywhere. I, too, felt the 3rd baking was a bit unnecessary since they were already very dark and hard. I had such a difficult time slicing them up. We'll see how the rest go over for Christmas.

This was my first attempt at making biscotti, and they turned out GREAT!! They were easy to make, and they tasted wonderful, not too sweet. I took some advice from the other reviews and baked them for only 7 mins each the second and third times, and they turned out perfect! I have already been asked for this recipie by friends!!

I didn't care for this recipe.  I thought there wasn't enough difference in chocolate flavors.  It tasted too bitter.  Maybe using a different type of chocolate chip would have helped.

Loved them!! I didn't have white chocolate so I used  toasted almonds, didn't bake the third  time. I liked them the way they were without baking the third time.  Will make them again and they will be great to take to parties.
