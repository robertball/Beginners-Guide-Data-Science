I don't know if it was my smoked pork shanks (a real possibility) or my fresh herbs, but this had a very bitter taste.  I had to do some majoring doctoring to correct this. Sorry, Chef John - it may have been my ingredients, it may have been my herbs but this was not a hit as written.

Easy to make - just plan in advance. Do not omit the gremolata - adds some pizazz to the dish. You will appreciate it! Even tho it is 100 degrees outside, this hearty dish was so delicious!

My son went to a restaurant and ordered a pork shank.  It was tough and uncooked, so I went online to find a recipe to use it and found this one.  I followed the directions until the part where you refrigerate it.  We just ate the beans right after they cooked.  Very good, but needed more salt and seasoning.

My wife and I got a whole hog with the smoked shanks. In looking for a recipe for the shanks I wanted to try this bean soup. I did it exactly like Chef John. Added the gremolata and the dish was superb. No need to change anything.

Very hearty recipe. Great techniques to learn in this recipe. I went the extra mile and made the gremolata and wasn't sorry.

I didn't have fresh herbs so used dried and it was perfect. Put half the meat in the dish and then used the other half for potato soup. Yummy recipe!
