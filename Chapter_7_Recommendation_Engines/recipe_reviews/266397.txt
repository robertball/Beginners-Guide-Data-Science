This was delicious! I left out the cheese, reduced the pepper to an 1/8 tsp and did add the red pepper flakes. We've never had grilled broccoli before and I am getting tired of baking it. I love it cooked so much more this way!!! We did not have a grilling pan so we wrapped it in tin foil. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent recipe and easy to make for a quick side dish! Made as written and we liked the addition of the red pepper flakes too. Perfect hint of heat here n there, but not overwhelming for us. I would have never thought to make cheesy broccoli on the grill, but this recipe worked and the cheese melted nicely (I think my DH used more than called for as he wanted extra cheesy). This recipe will definitely be a repeat here. Thanks for the recipe bd.weld!
