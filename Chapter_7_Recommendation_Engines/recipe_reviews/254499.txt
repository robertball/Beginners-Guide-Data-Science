Almost the pie I have been yearning for, I will attribute it to user error, or sentimentality, a lady who is now in Heaven, made the best cherry pie!!! I have wanted to duplicate it an this is the closest I have ever gotten! will make again! I used Northstar Cherries, that I picked. Too sour to eat and I cut the sugar a little as I wanted it tart.

I followed the directions exactly and the pie was so sour and tasted earthy. Maybe it was the cherries.

Made it for the first time, 2 pies.  Took one over to daughters for dinner.  All loved it especially the grandkids!  I got the cherries from my neighbour, just over 6 pounds!  So I just made 4 more pies :-)

Delicious! I used  jarred Morello pitted sour cherries. Served it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yum!
