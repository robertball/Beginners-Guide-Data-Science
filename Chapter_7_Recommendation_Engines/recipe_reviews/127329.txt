Simple and very comforting. I used FF half-n-half, SF vanilla pudding mix and brown sugar Splenda. Even my kids loved it!

This is too easy! It was ready to serve as soon as I made it and didn't need refrigeration time. That was probably due to the fact that my pumpkin had been refrigerated, so all of my ingredients were cold from the start. I also made my own whipped cream and used it instead of Cool Whip.

This is not a gourmet recipe however, it is a very yummy dessert for the fall.  My son could eat the whole bowl.  Sometimes I put the mixture in a graham cracker pie crust and then top with the pecans. Very pretty and different than the usual pumpkin pie.

HUGE HIT!  EASY! YUMMY!  I have made this several times since the first.  I have even tried it with lower fat ingredients and still just as yummy!  Great on top of a graham cracker crust or with ice cream too if you are feeling really indulgent!

I used sugar free jello and poured the mousse into a graham cracker crust -- my husband, who is diabetic, LOVED it.  For the topping, I used Splenda brown sugar blend.

Another follower of the "the worse it is for you the better it tastes" rule. I have to limit myself to making it around the excusable holiday-binge time, but it's SO delicious!
