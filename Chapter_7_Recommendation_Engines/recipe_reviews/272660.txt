I have become obsessed with chicken tenders so tried this recipe. First time I made it, the suggested Asian spice rub was not available at my grocery store so I substituted a Vietnamese dry rub they carried. It was just ok. But I took a chance and ordered the suggested spice online and wow did it make a difference! Loved the recipe second time around. I double the sauce because I buy a larger package of tenders.  Very tasty, easy to do, moist chicken---what's not to like!
