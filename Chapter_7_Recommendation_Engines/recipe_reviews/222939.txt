As this recipe’s first reviewer, I’m happy to say that while this may not be particularly unique, it is nonetheless particularly delicious.  I often prepare any number of different vegetables with bacon and it has never let me down, especially when fresh minced garlic is added! Tonight I chose to use both green and yellow patty pan squash, but zucchini or yellow squash would be equally as good.

Great use of all the squash we have in the summer. Just the right amount of bacon. I did drain it after cooking - before serving because the squash gives off so much water.

This was good. The mistake I made was not to peel and seed the squash first.

This was great. I added potatoes to it because I wanted to make it an entire meal. I will certainly have it again.

Made this tonight to accompany chicken cordon bleu - it was great. The only difference was I added about 3/4 cup chopped yellow peppers to mine. The peppers sweetened it a bit, and I thought it was fabulous! Thank you for the recipe! I'll definitely be making this again!

Most recipes that call for summer squash use so little of it, there's a ton of the veggie still unused. But I was able to plow through 1 and 1/2 large sunburst squash with this recipes. I also added some diced read potatoes from the garden and spiced it up with a little thyme, garlic powder, and cumin. All my kids were begging for seconds.

I love this take on squash. however I do something a bit different.  preboil squash to tender a little and add sugar to give just a hint of sweetness.  Love this recipe.  I saw it as I am looking for other recipes for squash that are not caseroles and cracker based!!  Suggestions?  please!!

Wonderful dish. Found this when my dad mistakenly bought squash instead of cucumbers... my experience with squash as been boiled and I didn't care for it but this recipe is wonderful. I did leave out the salt and pepper (bacon usually has plenty of salt for my taste and my brother isn't big on pepper). So far I've made this twice... second time I added garlic with the onions and it mixed wonderfully sautéed.

I usually don't care for bacon in recipes, but this was good. I added some poblano peppers for color and spice. Also, I drained the bacon, peppers and onions and mixed them in with the sliced squash and put them in a covered baking dish in the oven to cook. Less fat and the flavors blended nicely.

This is good.  The key to making this really delicious is using very FRESH garden squash. Nothing fancy, but a good reliable side to lots of main dishes.

My husband and I both really liked it.  I’ve made it twice in the past week. It’s easy and relatively quick.

I simply followed the recipe, and everything flowed right into  place. I cooked the squash a little longer maybe 15 mins more, yet a wonderful side Loved IT !
