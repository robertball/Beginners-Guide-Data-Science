My husband and I are following a specific diet which include a lot of fresh vegetables. I found this recipe today and made it for dinner tonight and it is wonderful. I see myself making it again and again.

Delicious!  I follwed the recipe fairly accurately, but did not steam the brocooli.  This made it fairly crunchy, but that is the way my family likes it.  The goat cheese really adds a wonderful flavor.

This was really tasty. I added a splash of balsalmic to the tomato mixture while heating and some sliced red bell pepper to the broccoli mixture. Also substituted a pinch of sugar for the maple syrup (maple syrup really did not sound good in this.)  Everyone loved it. It's great as a light main course.

I love tomatoes and broccoli and my husband loves goat cheese, so I really thought this was going to be a big hit. Neither one of us liked it. It was a little too sweet for me. I don't think the syrup was necessary. But it also had a strange bitterness

Easy to make and very tasty. Next time I will use fresh tomatoes as the canned ones left a vinegar taste that some did not like.

This has a great flavor! I didn't have olives or celery so did without, but I think with everything else it is plenty. I also didn't have the syrup and replaced it with honey, which I think works just as well without making it too sweet.

Amazingoved by all who tried it. I skipped the goat cheese and it was still good. Be careful when you cook it because it cools quickly. I will make it again.

This dish was very good and surprisingly filling. I knew it was a hit when my boyfriend had a second helping (this guy rarely refills his plate). I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and about a cup of tomato sauce. I added close to a 1/2 cup of the goat cheese. I will definitely make this dish again.

This was different, but we enjoyed it.  I had plenty of tomatoes from my garden, so I used those.   My quantity was probably a little off because my sauce was pretty thick, btu we all enjoyed it.

What an easy and tasty way to use up leftover crudite!  Spooned over brown rice and served as a main dish with a few shakes of red pepper flakes on top.

This recipe made a nice change on every day boring vegetables. I didn't make it exactly as stated, but used the general idea. I never add salt to anything, so no salt or pepper and I didn't have any maple syrup, so that was left out. The cheese I used was reduced fat cheddar, but that worked fine. I did up to direction 3 as directed, but had no tomatoes either, so substituted them with a jar of reduced salt Dolmio spag sauce. Also had no olives, but added chopped green beans, frozen corn to the carrot, onion, garlic, celery, broccoli mix, stirred through the sauce and topped with cheddar cheese, which I cooked at 180c until cheese melted. Very tasty and my fussy son who rarely eats his veggies ate it all up very happily! Thank you!

We did not like this recipe at all. It lacked flavor and the goat cheese and Parmesan just did not accentuate it. It was like someone messed up their dish so they threw cheese on top to fix it. Just our thoughts.

I enjoyed this but the rest of my family didn't really like it.  Unfortunately I won't be making it again.

Sweet and yummy. Made this exactly like the recipe reads except I didn't use canned tomatoes since I had fresh.  It is kind of busy so next time I think I'd probably only use the Parmesan and drop the olives and carrots.

This recipe was delicious. I was a bit unsure of adding the maple syrup as I thought it would make the dish sweet. But I added it and it didn't taste sweet. I think it gave the canned tomatoes a better flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I added additional seasoning to the mixture (basil, etc). I also used frozen broccoli-cheaper and easier.  Overall great easy dish. Will make again.

This is a delicious recipe. I followed the instructions and found it had a lot of flavor. I wonder if the person that thought this was too sweet did not use genuine Vermont maple syrup. That can make all the difference. You do need to add salt and pepper to taste. If yours was bland, maybe you needed more of these?

I threw some of the leftovers in a pan this morning and added a couple eggs. It was a delicious breakfast too!

Very good.  Had a happy accident when I used a can of organic diced tomatoes with green chiles.  Used chopped kalamata olives instead of green olives.  steamed the broccoli very lightly, and seasoned with thyme and and extra clove of garlic.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as indicated.  Served it over polenta, and it was a big hit with my husband.

Great taste. Easy and much more healthy than the usual broccoli bake.
