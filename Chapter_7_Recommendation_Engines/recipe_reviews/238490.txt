This made a very nice filling for my favorite multi-grain wraps.  I don't like raisins and used dried cranberries in their place.  To make it fast and easy, I used rotisserie chicken breast that I had cubed up the day before.  This was great texturally; creamy avocado, crunchy walnuts, chewy dried fruit, meaty chicken.  This had great flavor as well; savory and a bit sweet at the same time, wonderful freshness from the basil and a hint of tartness from the lime juice.  What are you waiting for?  Go make this now!  :)

My husband and I are doing the Dr. Oz 2 week rapid weight loss plan, and it can be hard to find recipes that are allowed.  This is perfect!  We both enjoyed it, minus the raisins and walnuts - just our personal preference.

To me, the flavors didn't really seem to go together. It wasn't awful or anything, very edible. Just kind of weird. But as we were eating it, we both kept making suggestions for how we would change it next time. So I guess it's a good inspiration recipe, but I won't be making this again in this way. But hey, clearly I am in the minority here, so I say give it a shot and see what you think.

This is absolutely delicious. I wasn't sure at first, I thought that I would miss Mayo... But the avocado is a wonder substitution.

This was excellent!!! I did not add raisins or walnuts because my 10month old wanted to eat it too! Served on a spinach and kale tortilla and added a dash of garlic and herb seasoning. So light and easy to make!

Fantastic. I am generally not a raise in person, and I contemplated not putting them in, but decided to anyways, and I am glad I did. They added just the right sweetness to the chicken salad. Fresh basil is a must. Excellent recipe!

I added cumin as suggested by another user and omitted raisins as I didn't have any.  Served with cucumber slices for a satisfying paleo lunch!

This was great.  My family loved it.  I used fresh garlic and added some cumin and onion powder to my chicken.  It was a nice addition.

Was quick and easy. This recipe will become a easy fill in for those busy nights. The only change I would make is the amount of lime juice, it was a little too much.

I didn't have enough basil (only about a tablespoon of dried) so I changed it up a bit. I added about 2 tablespoons of cilantro, 2 diced scallion, 1/2 cup red onion very finely diced, half a red bell pepper diced, 2 finely chopped celery stalks, garlic powder to taste, and a teaspoon of grated fresh ginger. I also cooked the diced chicken in a tablespoon of olive oil, minced garlic, salt and pepper mainly because it doesn't say how to.  The changes didn't add to the calories or fat content because they were all vegetables. This is a great recipe. Easy, quick and great for lunch leftovers! Definitely a keeper.

Quick and easy, now a family favorite. We ve made this receipe 4-6 times in the past two months. Overtime here is the adaptive receipe to our taste, We dry rub the chicken with sea salt and fresh ground pepper, double the spices in the receipe, added an extra avacado for 4 servings, occasionally add some chopped apples for more crunch. Be sure avocado are ripe.

Turned out really well, a delicious alternative to the Thai peanut sauce chicken wraps we usually make! I added a bit of cucumber for an extra crunch and loved it!

Really good! I slow cooked some chicken breast the night before and used that after shredding. The raisins and nuts give it a yummy twist! Definitely a keeper :) Thanks!

This delicious meal left my family and I feeling both full and pleasantly surprised. I used garlic powder instead of the salt and added a little onion powder as well. Also I boiled the chicken breasts in chicken broth before shredding it. Served on whole wheat tortillas with a cucumber salad with a light dill dressing (also from this site).

Made this for lunch today- my husband and I enjoyed it very much.  We subbed the Bibb lettuce wrap style with serving it over a bed of mixed greens with tomato and cucumber .  Next time I'm trying this mixture (minus chicken) over a piece of grilled mahi. 

Careful with the lime juice.  I used one med size lime at it had a citrus kick to it however it may be better for most to use 1/2 lime, taste and add accordingly.

A delicious recipe, but add the lime juice a little at a time so it doesn't turn out too sour.
