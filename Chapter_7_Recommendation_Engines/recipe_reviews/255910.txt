I was unable to find the fresh chile's but did find them dried. The dried ones didn't have a lot of heat to them after they were reconstituted so I ended up adding crushed red pepper flakes. This was a good recipe but next time I will use apple cider vinegar instead. This was super easy though and one that can be customized to suit your tastes. Oh and use Mexican oregano if you have it.
