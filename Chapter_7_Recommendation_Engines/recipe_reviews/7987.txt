This is advice to others who might be turned off by previous comments.  Dump cake is not somethig Jessica invented.  The first one I made had cherry pie filling (yum), and I have tried blueberry, apple, and peach pie filling.  The cherry dump cake recipe uses cinnamon; therefore, I use plenty with all of the pie fillings. Also, don't bother cutting the butter; just melt it.  Vary the amount of butter depending your taste. (Real butter makes a big difference.) I like cake mix on the top and bottom.  Experiment.  Blueberry, apple, and peach pie filling might need added sweetener or sugar; just taste it before assemblying the cake.
Don't expect an actual cake to pop out of the oven; expect a cobbler.  If you're not pleased, try changing something (i.e. the amount of butter, coverage of the butter, sweetener, cooking time, etc.)

Wonderfull camping recipie. I make this in my motorhome.  My grandkids love it.  To distribute the butter evenly, I use cold butter and a small grater.

If you notice this is my 2nd review. I did what others stated about melting the butter instead of thinly slicing.. NO WAY...Came out way soggy & i even drained a lil juice since I was trying the melted butter way. NOPE not for me.. The other is a little time consuming because you have to cover all AREAS with thinly sliced butter or will have dry patches. The time is worth it to me. Did not like the melted butter way, wish I did a lot quicker.. but nope...  read my other review on this because this is outta this world good!!!!

I LOVE to bake.  I bake a lot of recipes that are very involved and time-consuming.  My father explained a cake to me he saw on a cooking show and wanted it for Fathers Day.  I, of course, turned to AllRecipes.com and found this recipe.  I was a little hesitant because it seemed way too easy.  I made it and followed some other reviewers suggestions and added 1/2 cup brown sugar sprinkled on top followed by the cinnamon.  My husband and my sister-in-law wouldn't shut up about it!!  I can't believe slaving over a stove making all of these fancy things - and this is the one he absolutely loves - go figure!  Thanks - I'll be making this over and over and over....

This cake was so good. I changed the recipe a little though. Instead of just adding the dry cake mix on top of the peaches I mixed the cake mix with the eggs and the oil and then I spread the cake mix over the peaches. I also sprinkled cinnamon over the peaches. Very delicious served with vanilla ice cream on top.

I am used to making peach cobbler from scratch, so I was hesitant to try this recipe but did so since I did not have alot of time the day I was making dinner for friends.  Everybody loved it and I received just as many compliments when I make the homemade version! I read the reviews and also put a stick of butter in the freezer before grating on top of the cobbler. I also used the butter recipe yellow cake mix and used 3 cans of the peaches (only used the syrup of 2 cans). I added brown sugar, vanilla, 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg to give it that extra something.  It was a big hit and I have already made 3 times for guests.  Try and with the little extra ingredients you won't be disappointed.

Great recipe.  Loved the ease of preparation and inexpensive items found in most kitchen pantry's.  Made the recipe exactly as written and it was wonderful, but I have since customized it to my family's preference.  Increased the peaches to 2.5 cans and drained the syrup from the 3rd can only (we like more peaches), used peaches in LIGHT syrup and I haven't been able to tell the difference.  Sprinkled cinnamon over peaches before adding the cake mix and then finished the recipe with a 1/3 cup dark brown sugar on top of the cake mix, followed by the the cinnamon and finally chilled a cube of butter and grated it over the top (handheld cheese grater works wonders for this).  This spreads the butter more evenly and allows it to achieve a crystalized finish. Rave reviews every time!

I have made this recipe for many years and my family loves it. I partially drain the peaches and mine is never soggy. I also find it easier to melt the butter or margarine and drizzle it over the top.

I've made this several times and it's a good, easy dessert.  To cut down on the "sweetness", use peaches in very light syrup instead of heavy syrup.

Yummy, I made it for dinner. everyone loved it couldn't belive that you put the cake mix in dry.
Wasn't sogy, I did drain off some of the juice. I used peaches that I had canned with no sugar. 
Put about 1/4 cup brown sugar on top of mix with some cinnamon & the butter.

Very good, quick and easy to make.  My 13 year old made it with very little help from me.  It's rich and very sweet, but the sweetness lessens after the first day and the taste is great.  I have tried regular and lite peaches.  The lite is definitely the best.  I added about 1 1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon to the peaches and sprinkled cinnamon on top of the butter.  It was a VERY big hit and everyone loved it.  The best part is that noone knew that the topping was a cake mix! This one's a keeper. I've made it at least 10 times!  Just too easy!!

My Bunco group loved this!  Be sure to cut the butter into tiny pieces to ensure it melts properly and you don't end up with powdered cake mix on the top.

This is a delicious and easy cake to make.  I like to put the dry cake mix in a bowl, melt the butter and pour it over the cake mix.  Then I mix it until crumbly and sprinkle on top along with some chopped walnuts.

This is a great recipe. However, I made a few changes. I used 1 29oz. cans of peaches with juice, plus a 16oz. can w/o the juice. I sprinkled cinnamon over the peaches before covering with cake mix, sprinkled a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon over cake mix. Finally, I shredded butter over topping as suggested by another reviewer. It turned out great, not soggy at all...baked for 60 minutes.

I made this yesterday as a way to use up some fresh peaches. I read a lot of reviews and here is what I did.  -used 9 very large peaches, sliced thin -sprinkled with a little brown sugar and cinnamon -sprinkled with a buttered pecan cake mix -did the freezer/grater trick with the butter -sprinkled with more cinnamon I have to say this turned out perfect!! Delicious and hit the spot. Can't wait to try it with different fruit/cake mix combinations. I also gave the recipe to a friend and she made it today also!

This was an INCREDIBLE cobbler!!  Last week, I used a recipe from this site to make a fabulous (and very time-consuming!) cobbler out of cherries and blueberries.  Since it was so delicious, we were all craving another, so I looked up a faster recipe.  This ended up being, by far, the best cobbler I've EVER had.

I made a few changes:  I used 1 can blueberries in heavy syrup, 1 large can (29 oz) peaches in heavy syrup, 1 average can peaches drained, and 2 small tropical fruit cups (I was getting desperate for filling!).  I then sprinkled 1/2 cup white sugar over the fruits in the pan.  Next, I cut 1 1/2 sticks of butter into the cake mix with 3/4 cup brown sugar.  I scattered this on top, and then baked for 45 minutes!

Make sure to give the cobbler time to set.  I waited about 4 hours before we cut into it, which gave it the opportunity to set.  This was a FABULOUS cobbler!!  I have honestly never had better, even from bakeries.  Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

AMAZING!  I mixed the peaches, juice, and cake mix together, reserving about a half cup of cake mix for the topping. I added a tsp of Mexican Vanilla to the mixture. (vanilla makes EVERYTHING better, right?) Then, poured into my Pam sprayed pan, topped evenly with the reserved cake mix, added about a 1/3 cup brown sugar like others had suggested, sprinkled cinnamon, then added the thinly sliced butter evenly on top.  It is HEAVEN!!!!  Even better when topped with Vanilla Ice cream.... I am so happy to have found this recipe!!  Thank You, Jessica!

I consider this to be one of my favorite KISS (keep it simple, stupid) recipes!  It takes 5 minutes to throw together and the end result is fantastic and perfect for company or potlucks.  Definitely slice the butter instead of melting it.  The crust gets crispier when the butter melts into it instead of just the top.   I tried grating the butter once, but the butter clumped together and it was hard to get it evenly over the top.  And if you love the peaches (like me!) use 2 29oz cans of peaches, but drain one of the cans first so it won't be soggy.  I actually have this in my oven right now.  Yum!!!

This was very very very good! I kept the juice of one can, and drained most out of the other.  I then sprinkled about a tsp of cinnamon right over the peaches, then spread the cake mix over it.  I cut about a stick of butter in thin slices and placed all over top, IT DOES NOT WORK WELL melting the butter and drizzling.  Plus it will get to dark too if you put the cinnamon over the topping, i think since i put it over the peaches it took away that "canned"taste.  Overall, very good recipe, and I baked at 350 for 40 mins.  Mmmm

Not a recipe which knocks me out of my socks, but still a very tasty dish. STILL - **why** would anyone fuss with trying to push the cake mix into the fruit & its syrup ???? Drain the syrup into a bowl, add mix, beat until smooth & pour over the fruit in the baking dish. Slick as a trout, much faster. I've done it with both approaches now, and there is no way I'll fool with the "push it down" method again. Taste & texture are comparable.

I am sorry this tasted like baking soda and baking powder. I have to agree with a past review maybe if you actually make the mix with the oil and eggs then pour it over it would take the taste of baking soda away.

Excellent as written.  I loathe when people take a recipe and alter it so severely.  Really...you aren't rating the recipe, you are rating a creation you came up with.  No, Jessica isn't the first one to come up with this recipe...but I do like the one she  listed.  Thanks so much for sharing, hon, and keep them coming!

I made this dessert tonight for my husband and daughter, using fresh farm market peaches that were nearly overripe.   After peeling and slicing the peaches, I tossed them with some cinnamon sugar and nutmeg before spreading them in the pan.  I melted the butter and drizzled it over the cake mix, then sprinkled the top with brown sugar and cinnamon.  I then served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  So simple, and it came out absolutely, insanely delicious! I look forward to making this again, perhaps with apples in the fall.

I have made this recipe many times and it's terrific!  As many others have said, the butter needs to be distributed evenly over the top or there will be dry spots. I add about 1/4 cup extra butter to make sure it's all covered.  NOTE:  I do not drain 1/2 the syrup as others have suggested.  I prepare it the night before and let all the ingredients meld in the fridge overnight, then bake the next day.  I like the results better!

The best way I have found so far to mix the cake mix and butter is to let the butter sit to room temp and mix it in with the cake mix that way and crumble on top. The butter is even and perfect. I make this with peaches cherry/pineapple, blackberry, strawberry, anything!

Turned out amazing.  Will make it again, and again.  I used fresh peaches left over from canning.  Ladled in some left over simple syrup, spread the dry cake mix evenly over the top, thinly cut and placed butter over nearly every inch.  I only had to use a wee bit more butter than called for to cover it well.  I left out the cinnamon because I didn't have any.  This was not a problem.  I was unsure about how liquid the juicy part was after baking but realized soon enough that it thickens up as it cools.  Ate it warm and had seconds.  Okay, maybe it was thirds.  Don't judge me.

I make this quite a bit for a quick family dessert and I do one stick butter, cut into squares and distributed over the dry cake mix. When I first started making this, I drizzled the melted butter which caused the cake to be soggy. The butter squares cut up makes
for a crispier, more cobbler like topping. 

EDITED 07/23/08:
I made this again today, only using half 
canned apple pie filling and a can of 
no-sugar diced peaches. I also added a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and a couple good shakes of nutmeg. I can't explain how good this smelled. Nothing like a simple dessert to make a bad day better!

This was a great, super easy recipe.  I used white cake mix as I didn't have yellow on hand.  It turned our wonderfully.  I also used fresh peaches instead of canned (8 peaches).  I sliced them and cooked them with about 1/4 c. of sugar and some cinnamon.  The fresh peaches and sugar made a great syrup.  It was just enough to keep the cake from being too dry or too wet.

I love this dump cake more that peach cobbler!  The secret for me has been grating the stick of butter straight from the fridge on top of the cake mix with my hand grater.  This covers the mix perfectly.

This is so gooey and great!  Definitely drain some of the syrup so it doesn't get soggy, and cut up the peaches a little if they don't cover the bottom of the pan, and it will turn out fabulous!  What a treat for potlucks!

Mmmm.. This was fantastic. Used a smaller than 9x13 dish, but it came out absolutely scrumptious.  Will probably just melt the butter next time, but used a veggie peeler on really cold butter to make shavings to spread over the cake mix. I liked the other suggestion of putting some oats/brown sugar in the topping with the cinnamon too.

I love making dump cake - I just put the stick of butter (not margarine) in the 9x13 pan and it melts while the oven preheats, then literally dump in the peaches (I slice each slice into thirds) and dump the cake mix on top - and I don't mix ANY of the ingredients together! -  then sprinkle with cinnamon and chopped pecans. So delicious and soooo easy!!! Also have made it with 1 can crushed pineapple + 1 can cherry pie filling. Also really yummy!!!

A few things I've found that help prevent the sogginess are to #1 drain one can of peaches and #2 sprinkle half of a pkg of peach gelatin into the peaches befor topping with the dry cake mix. Everyone always loves this.

This a great recipe! I drained the peaches and also recommend to layer the bottom of the pan with a thin layer of the cake mix and pat it down.  Put stick of butter in freezer as you prepare and then"shave' it, using a grater,  over the top for a crisp topping. I mixed brown sugar with cinnamon and used that for the top, be generous!

I changed this recipe quite a bit from the original because I wanted a peach crisp but am still giving it 5 stars because when a recipe can stand up to so many different variations, it deserves 5 stars!

I used 2 16oz bags of frozen peaches, thawed and about 4 fresh peaches sliced up.  Added about 1/4 cup ginger syrup (fresh ginger added to simple syrup and boiled until thick), some crystallized ginger and ground cinnamon to the peaches.  Used SPICE CAKE MIX but I wanted more of a crumbly texture for the topping so I used 1 1/2 sticks unsalted slightly softened butter, added 3/4 cup oats, and 1/2 cup chopped almonds (I was out of pecans).  Used two forks to mash everything up into large crumbles which I evenly distributed over the peaches.  Baked as the recipe suggests.

This was ABSOLUTELY the best peach crisp/crumble I have ever tasted!!  My friends were fighting over the last bits in the pan and were threatening to lick the pan clean!  The ginger was definitely a great addition!

I used a French Vanilla cake mix, (it was all I had) and grated the cold butter like someone mentioned. Great idea! My house smells like Disney World main street! Tastes very good. I added cinnamon sugar mixture to the top and only had to bake it35 minutes. It was done. Great recipe!!

I made this last night for a party at my job.  I found it to be very easy to put together and the ingredients were readily available.  I did make a few changes, I kept the basic recipe but added some freshly ground nutmeg to the peach mixture, as well as I put some butter pieces in the mixture, and I sprinkled the top with cinnamon and some brown sugar.  It was delish!!  It's a good recipe if you don't want to spend time in the kitchen and make something that will wow the crowd!

I think this is the best version of the Peach Dump Cake that can be made with canned peaches.  I combined many of the tips and this is what I got.  Ok: I used 3 -15 oz. cans of the peaches in juice (not syrup). After I poured the peaches in the pan, I mixed the cake batter with the juice from 2 cans and poured it on top and spread it evenly with a spoon.  I then sprinkled about 3/4 cup of quick cook oatmeal evenly over the top to cut the foreshadowed soggy in the other comments. Then I spooned the full amount of butter/melted on top.  I then sprinkled cinnamon and brown sugar over that.  Cooked  @ 375 for 45 min. exactly.  It was great!  If you want it cake like this would be the way to go.  I like it a little more "soggy" so next time I will add another 1/2 can of juice!  Enjoy!!!

I love this recipe!!!! I have made it numerous times always with great results and compliments. I melt my butter and completely cover the batter with it, I cook it about 10-15 minutes longer than the recipe calls for to ensure there are no soggy spots. I also take the juice from the peaches and mix it with the batter then pour that over the sliced peaches. Turns out perfect and yummy every time!!!

Excellent idea! I had bought fresh peaches and wanted to use them up and was looking for something like this. I made a few modifications. Obviously, used fresh peaches, I added a handful of fresh strawberries, I used a pastry blender/cutter and mixed a few spoonfuls of brown sugar and cold butter. I don't mind spending the few extra minutes to use the pastry blender...to me it made it a perfectly crusted top and perfectly moist below! Delicious!

Very easy to make and delicious!! I took a fork and pressed the cake mix into the syrup and then I melted the butter and drizzled it over the top rather than cut it up. Didn't last long at all-I will definitely be making this again.

NOTE: YOU HAVE TO PRESS the cake mix DOWN into the liquid or you will end up with powder on top. 

ALso, if you want a healthier variation, use frozen peaches or drained peaches to cut down on SUGAR.  IT WAS TOO SWEET FOR ME. So, Use water instead of the fruit juice.  

Also, instead of butter , you can use OIL or smart balance. I use a mixture of canola and light olive oil and drizzle this over the top (oil won't clog the arteries like butter or margarine).

Very quick, easy, and delicious recipe.  I used enough peaches to cover the bottom of my pan (used peaches in light syrup)and covered with cake mix, then pieces of butter, and then sprinkled on a layer of brown sugar followed by a little cinnamon.  Served warm with vanilla ice cream...absolutely wonderful!

Holy jeez. I read most of the reviews and I honestly can't understand how y'all were able to stomach this. The most helpful critical review is right - it tastes like peachy baking soda. I followed the recipe and then added a bit of brown sugar on top as I saw in another review. It smelled a-ma-zing! It even looked awesome. The consistency is exactly what I was hoping for - crusty top, cakey middle, gooey bottom. But it tasted so, so, so salty (baking soda) that no amount of ice cream, whipped cream, or frosting could render this cake palatable. Ugh, this was horrible. I wouldn't even recommend it to my enemies.

We love this recipe.  I like to add a couple handfuls of frozen blueberries with the peaches.  I also drain one of the cans of peaches, add 1/4 cup of brown sugar on top of the cake mix, and an extra sprinkle of cinnamon.  I could eat the whole pan.  Love love love it.  Thanks!

The ONLY reason I gave this 4 stars is because the original calls for canned peaches.  I use fresh fruit whenever possible.  I was looking for a way to use up some JUMBO (1 lb each) peaches we got from the local orchard, and this has the most reviews with such a high rating.  I now know why!  I used about 3 lb of fresh peaches, dribbled with a little bit of maple syrup (2 Tbsp?), and followed the rest as written (but with grating butter as was suggested by many).  This is DEFINITELY a keeper with the mod to fresh peaches.  (fresh fruit and boxed cake mix... I know... but peaches shouldn't come in a can :-p)

A huge hit and oh so easy. I used 12 fresh sliced peaches and sprinkled 1 tsp. cinnamon on top (if they're ripe no need to add sugar).  I also increased the cinnamon sprinkled on top to 1 tsp. Grating the cold butter worked great.

This is ridicously easy!  I cannot believe that I've never made this recipe until now.  I baked this at the cottage this past weekend for the  family and they couldn't believe how tasty it was!  I used 1 1/2 cans of 28 oz sliced peaches in juice, drained 1 can fully.  I also added 1/4 cup of brown sugar to the top and grated the butter over top that.  Served with a good quality vanilla ice cream.  This will now be my "go-to" dessert recipe!

I make this all the time because its one of my husbands favorite desserts. I use the light peaches in juice, add another can of peaches, but drain that one, and dont use cinnamon, but Im sure itd be great. I have never had a problem with it being soggy or having dry mix. I just slice the cold butter and lay it out evenly over the cake mix. I cant imagine adding extra sugar to this like other reviewers say they do, its already so sweet.

Wow, this was awesome! I made this when my in-laws came over and had to hide the box of cake mix from my mother-in-law so she wouldn't see that it wasn't homemade. I agree with draining the peaches before using. I'd bet this recipe would work well with cherry pie filling and chocolate cake mix. Or blueberries and lemon cake...the possibilities are endless!

Although this recipe is great just the way it is, I have made a few modifications to it by adding a half of cup of cream cheese wiped and folded into the peaches before I put them into the pan. After that I put chopped pecans on top of the peaches and  used a cinnamon swirl cake mix then I drizzled the melted butter on the mix and it's not too soggy nor too dry.Try this its really good.

Traditionally i've made Dump Cake with crushed pineapple and cherry pie filling.  I now have a new tradition, Peach Dump Cake.  I love this because it's not overly sweet nor does it have a bite to it(which is what you get with the pineapple and cherry).  Three alterations were made; I used 1 and 1/2 sticks of butter and omitted the cinnamon (by accident).  The butter I cut up into thin pats and placed over the dry cake mix. Draining the peaches, I used canned peaches in light syrup.

Everyone loved this dessert. It was very easy to make - I let it bake a little longer than the 45 minutes because it looked soggy but it came out fine. I would have given it five stars but it is very rich.

I used fresh peaches,sliced about 2 cups and added 3/4 cups of water. I also use a reduced fat cake mix and it turned out very good.

Delicious and so easy!  However, next time I would try using peaches in light syrup, as it was a bit sweet for my taste with the heavy syrup (though everyone else in my house liked it just as it was).

Just made this tonight and it is fantastic!!!
I did follow some of the suggestions made in the reviews:
*I used 3 regs sized cans of Delmonte Freestone Peaches - two with the juice and one drained.
*Sprinkled cinnamon over the peaches and on top of the cake mix
*Sprinkled brown sugar on top of the cake mix
*Sliced the butter and arranged evenly over the top of the cake mix
*Baked for an additional 10 minutes because it looked a bit runny after the 45 minutes.
I can't wait to try this again with other fruit and cake mixes!!

This was fabulous! Used peaches in lite syrup and sprinkled 1/4 cup of brown sugar over the top to make it crunchier, and grated a stick of butter from the freezer. I did cut up the peaches into little bite-size chunks, right there in the glass dish. This just couldnt be easier, and it tastes like you slaved over it. Thanks for sharing!

Yummy and super easy!  Everyone loved this delicious desert.  I got my stick of butter super cold and used a potato peeler to "shave" the butter.  Doing that enables you to cover every bit of the cake topping, thus no dry cake mix showing.
Will definitely make again!!

This has to be one of the easiest AND yummiest desserts that I have ever made. I made the recipe in an 8x8 pan, so I just halved all of the ingredients. I added some brown sugar on top, and I still cooked it for 45 mins. Both myself, and my boyfriend both LOVED it! It also goes really well fresh out of the oven with some vanilla ice cream on top. It also made the house smell so wonderful. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

This recipe is the bomb!!!!  My church fed a women/children homeless shelter yesterday and I had promised spaghetti and peach cobbler.  I came across this recipe. It looked easy and used less ingredients. I drained the juice, cut the peaches into small pieces.  I am a Watkins rep, so I used our Apple Bake spice. I poured some juice in pan with peaches and a little over the cake mix.  On top of cake mix I grated frozed butter (better coverage) and sprinkled a little white sugar. Feeding so many (50), I used foil lasagna pans I got from the Dollar Store.  I will be using this recipe for an afternoon snack for my church and whenever I get a sweet tooth.  Thanks again!!!!

With my changes it was 5 stars!  I added a cup of fresh blueberries to the peaches.  I also sprinkled about 1 T. of cinnamon and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  On top of the cake mix, I added about 1/2 cup of pecan halves and about 1/4 cup more butter.  This was OUTSTANDING!!! YUMMY!!!

I was looking for a recipe to use some fresh peaches that were going soft. SO I used this recipe and modified it a bit. I covered the 13x9 pan with peeled and sliced fresh freestones. I had one extra that I liquified with a hand blender. Since this recipe called for canned with the juice, I added some simple syrup to the sliced peaches. The cake mix was added and sprinkled with cinnimon sugar. This tip can be used by all; rather than slicing the butter, I used frozen unsalted butter and grated it. Then I sprinkled it over the top. This came out great and served it warm with vanilla ice cream....Mmmmmmm

This was a good recipe that I used with fresh white flesh peaches my neighbor gave me from his tree.  I just added a little cinnamon and sugar before adding the cake mix. I also used a cheese grater with really cold butter to distribute it evenly over entire pan.  This worked like a charm.  Thanks to the reviewer who suggested that.  Overall very easy and quick recipe for good dessert.  UPDATE: Used mixed fresh berries and was a delicious topping for ice cream.

Tasty and easy - went together in ten minutes and baked while we ate.  For those of you who said it was soggy, I wonder if you have had cobblers before, which are supposed to be juicy on the bottom and cakey on the top.  Mine was like this but the cake was not soggy at all.  I used a Golden Butter Yellow Moist Deluxe cake mix (or something like that) and used 3 cans of peaches in 100% fruit juice. Drained one can but dumped the other two.  Cut my peaches up and used a grater with cold butter for the top (thank you reviewers who submitted those tips!)  I used half the butter the recipe called for and still got the top well covered with the grating method.  No dry spots - I mashed all the mix down into the juices well.  My family loved this recipe!  It's not something I'd serve for a fancy dinner party because it's not super pretty and the texture is a little spongy for me, but the taste was very good!  Kind of down-homey, so it was perfect for a family dessert.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!!  It is so easy and cheap and makes your house smell great.  I made a couple of small changes.  I used peaches in light syrup.  I added a drained can of chopped peaches because I like a lot of fruit.  I also used light butter.  AFter it cooked for 15 minutes, I took it out and sprayed it down with butter spray.  When it was done I took a spatula and lightly pressed the top crust down to make sure it wasn't too powdery since I used light butter.  Just a few extra steps to lighten it up and the reviews were more positive then when my mother in law made it with real butter.  It ijust isn't as rich and the topping is crisper.  I have tried this with blueberry pie filling which was ok but not as good as the peaches.  I also tried it with apple pie filling which I would not recommend.

This recipe was very easy and VERY good. I would use an extra can of peaches because I like it a little juicier. I also used Orange Supreme cake mix by Duncan Hines. I give this recipe and A+++!

Rich & tasty and a cinch to make-------a real comfort food desert in the tapioca pudding/apple crisp family. My only suggestion is it may be better to use unsalted butter. This tasted really salty to me and I'm a salt fiend....just not in my dessert!

UPDATE:
I made this a second time with three cans of sliced peaches that I cut in half. This time I used a frozen stick of butter when shredding and it worked much better, resulting in an even distribution over the cake mix. I also added a little less than 1/2 tsp. nutmeg sprinkled over the cinnamon.  I still stirred it just a bit at 35 minutes and then baked for another 13 minutes.


I made this with a couple of tweaks. I used 3 cans of peach halves with heavy syrup and one can with light syrup. I drained the light syrup and one of the heavy syrup cans. I sprinkled 1/4 cup brown sugar and the cinnamon on top. I grated a cold stick of butter over top top.  At 35 minutes, I stirred it up and baked the remaining 10 minutes. Stirring seemed to help reduce the liquid and increased the cake texture. My husband loved it and I'll definitely make this again.

I have made this many times and we love it.  I throw the cake mix and stick of butter in the food processor and then sprinkle over the top of peaches, then sprinkle on the cinnamon.  Easy-peasy! =)  Hubby and BIL have to have ice cream on top.  =)

SO delicious. My husband raved about it, and said it was the best peach cobbler he's ever had. (he had no idea i used boxed cake mix) - added some candied pecans, brown sugar, nutmeg and cinnamon on top, and used southern style canned peaches that already come with brown sugar and cinnamon flavoring.  SO delish. Also had some fresh raspberries on hand so i halved them and threw em in. Wonderful dessert served with vanilla ice cream.

I didn't know this recipe was on here. We do this down south, except with a few changes. I use 1 cup of butter and I cut it into the cake mix until it make crumbs. I add nutmeg and cinnamon to the mix. Then crumble on top of the I peaches. Then I press cherrys into the top as a design. Very easy southern dessert! We love it.

Very quick dessert to throw together and tastes so good. Pretty sure I will be making this again!  I did cook for an additional 10 minutes as I always prefer a crunchier crust.  Thank you for sharing...

I have made this dish several times and I wanted to update my review.  I've made the recipe as written and it is great, but I absolutely enjoyed the dish with the following changes: I took the advice of previous posters and 1. put some cake mix on the bottom of the dish 2. sprinkled nutmeg and a little brown sugar on top of the peaches 3. grated frozen butter (over the dish) on top of the cake mix and 4. sprinkled cinnamon and brown sugar on top of the butter. Happy eating and thanks to all for the amazing tips.

nice refreshing dessert...and so simple!   i used - 2 cans peaches in lite syrup and a bag of frozen peaches.  I threw in a 1/2 pint of fresh raspberries too.  drained one can of peaches and added about 1/2 remaining liquid to cake mix. I melted the butter, added to cake mix and spread batter over cinnamon & nutmeg sprinkled peaches.  I also crumbled a cup of brown sugar over batter and cooked as directed.  served w/ vanilla frozen yogurt and whipped cream.   yummy!

I made this for a family get together and the adults and the kids loved it! I added some nutmeg (It's great with a sprinkle of brown sugar as well) and used a little more butter than the recipe. My only suggestion would be to drain the juice off the peaches. Thanks for the wonderful recipe, It's a staple in our home.

This was delicious and so easy. You can't go wrong with a dump cake. The only thing i would have done differently is to drain a little of the peach juice before preparing it. It was a little too runny but did thicken slightly as it cooled.  I will make this again with this alteration.

This is the perfect dessert to make when you are in a pinch for time, ideas and grocery items in your pantry.  I've also made it with different fruits.  My husband, who is not a sweets eater, loves this "cake".  When we go visiting he begs me to bring it.  I always receive raves.  THERE IS NO WAY TO MAKE A MISTAKE WHEN MAKING THIS CAKE.  It always comes out great!!

This was PERFECT! I have been making this for years but the secret is pressing down the cake mix. makes a huge difference. Of course you must have ripe and sweet fruit. I made exactly the way it is written and my family was crazy about it. Delicious fruit and crunchy topping.

Loved it for it's ease and how well it went over with my family. I've made dump cakes before with different ingredients and more commonly with angelfood cake mix, so using the yellow mix was a first for me. 
When I put in the two cans of peaches, it sure didn't look like enough for my three guys, so I added another can on a whim, figuring I'm experimenting and if it doesn't turn out, it's a lesson learned... well it turned out great with 3 cans of peaches! I followed the recipe to a T otherwise and it was delicious.
For those of you complaining about the sweetness, you could try the angelfood mix, which tends to bake up a little fluffier, or try peaches in their own juice instead of heavy syrup. I will make this one again. One of my boys likes cobblers with a little milk on it, while the rest of us enjoy it with ice cream. A nice quick economical treat, and my family thinks I slaved over it!

I prefer a cobbler over cake but DH and friends raved about this recipe served with vanilla ice cream. I used 2 x 29oz cans of peaches in heavy syrup, assembled the ingredients in the casserole dish the night before,  I put some of the cake mix on the bottom of the dish as recommended, mixed in instant oatmeal to the top cake mix layer. I assembled the ingredients the night before and baked it 4 hours prior to serving. I'd like to try this with other fruits as recommended by other reviewers. Next time, I will use light syrup fruits next time or skip the sugars if I use heavy syrup; put >1/3 of the cake mix in the bottom; mix in quick cook oats and/or chopped nuts with the top layer for more crunch. Thanks for the recipe.

This is not a cake...it is like a crumble or cobbler. This is super easy and pretty cheap. I DO recommend that you take the time to slice the butter very thinly instead of melting it like some of the reviews suggest. When you melt the butter, it tends to pool in the middle or sides as it cooks, leaving some areas very dry and others soggy. You can try this same recipe using blueberries, cherry pie filling or a combo of berries. This recipe is a HUGE hit in my house!

Good and quick, a little sweet for my taste.  I  microwaved the cake since the gas ran out.  It worked out well just the same (12 mins on high, or more depending on microwave)  Make sure to turn the cake manually if it can't revolve.

This is soooo good! I followed the recipe exactly like it said. Towards the end of the cooking time it still had a lot of powder cake mix, so I melted 1/4 cup of butter and drizzled it all over it and used a fork to mix it up a bit. We put it back in the oven and just kept an eye on it till it looked finished. We served it with maple walnut ice cream and it was awesome!

This is a good recipe, however I added more of some of the ingredients. I was told that it was the bomb (meaning excellent). Used 3 cans of peaches instead of 2, drained syrup from one can. I mixed white sugar (1/4 cup) and cinnamon (2 tbs) to peaches. Then after adding dry cake mixture, used 1 1/2 sticks of melted butter on top to cover mix, sprinkled more cinnamon on top and sprinkled lightly with more white sugar. Baked in oven until crusty golden brown top. Yummy, made twice within one week!

What a great fall dessert!  I used Butter Pecan cake mix, added a lot of cinnamon and some ginger to the peaches.  I also melted the butter, and used 1/2 stick more than was called for.  It's great with fresh whipped cream!!!

OUTSTANDING!!!!  Best dessert recipe I've made in a while and very easy to make.  I used fresh peaches in place of the canned and added pecans to the topping.  I also followed the advice of others and melted my butter and poured on top of the cake mix.  Delish!!

I have made this recipe for years and to make it even better, I add a couple of tablespoons of flour to the peach juice to thicken it up a little, and I spoon the butter carefully over the top of the cake mix, than I sprinkle sugar on top, it turns out nice and golden that way.  Its a great recipe. :)

Ok, I thought this was a yummy dessert. Not exactly my cooking style. But time was of the essence and I was too lazy to even think abut some complicated dessert! I mean really, 3 ingredients!!!! How awesome is that! I never bake with cake mixes or canned fruit for that matter but this was so simple and yummy I would definitely make again.

Loved this! I did as others said & drained 1 can & left juice in other can. Also shaved my butter across to cover all areas of cake mic & sprinkled with cinnamon. Taste is delicious. Have tried peaches, blueberries etc.

Very sweet, but very yummy.  My husband was actually the one who made it -- I just read the directions to him as he went.  He cut the butter into very thin slices and laid them all over the top.  It baked to a beautiful crisp!

A standard favorite comfort food.  I've made this using both 2 cans of peaches and 3 cans.  Depending on how many you use, the texture of the dish is altered.  I always use a fork to break up any potential clumps in the cake mix and to make sure that it's spread evenly over the peaches.  Then dizzle the butter over the top to cover the entire dish evenly.

Awesome recipe!  In our case I took some peaches that were getting ripe and were not all that sweet and skinned them.  Since there was no syrup we added maple syrup since we did not have corn syrup.  And it came out to be one of the tastiest desserts we have made!

As a quick and easy recipe, this is great. It was a bit sweet for my taste, but that is a good think b/c then I can't eat too much! Next time I'll use three cans of peaches. Also, I used peaches in light syrup and about 2/3 of butter that this called for b/c I couldn't stomach using the whole stick! Wasn't dry at all--even with these adjustments.

THIS WAS REALLY A GOOD RECIPE. I DID MAKE A FEW ADJUSTMENTS. I SPRINKLED THE PEACHES WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SUGAR IN ADDITION TO THE CINNAMON. I ALSO SPRINKLED THIS MIXTURE  ON TOP. ABOUT 10 MINUTES BEFORE THE CAKE WAS DONE, I SPRINKLED PECAN PIECES ON TOP. IT WAS SOOOOO GOOD.

I have made this recipe for years.  I use a butter pecan cake mix instead of the yellow cake mix and it makes it super yummy.  If you don't have a butter pecan cake mix in the house, just add chopped walnuts or pecans to the yellow cake mix.

It was super simple for a weeknight dessert. I did use two big cans of peaches and drained the liquid out of one. I also forgot to add the cinnamon in the process of trying to cook dinner. All in all it turned out nice and the only thing it was missing was a nice scoop of ice cream

PRETTY GOOD. VERY EASY. I THINK IT IS MUCH BETTER WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM AS MENTIONED. PARTS OF MY WERE A BIT "CAKEY" TASTING..THINK I NEED TO ADD A FEW MORE PATS OF BUTTER.

I made this and it was SOOO yummy. But I did changed a few things. I baked it in a 9x9 pan and I added cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar to the peaches and on top of the cake mix. I also used a white cake mix because that was all I had on hand! :)

Absolutely loved it- took to a ladies function and everyone wanted to recipe. I did use 2 29 oz cans of peaches for a 9x13 pan, draining all the juice from one can and a little from the second can as it seemed like alot, and it turned out perfect. I find that melting the butter and stiring the cake mix into it works fabulous as all the batter has butter. Turns out beautiful. Cant wait to make it agian!!

I've made this recipe several times now in the past couple of months for various occasions, potluck, holidays, etc.... and it always comes out perfect.  The easiest recipe I've ever tried.  I've had to share the recipe several times now.  Everybody loves it and there is never any left, even if I double it.

This was fantastic! I did make some changes though. I used 9 small fresh peaches and one can of sliced in juice. Also added brown sugar and cinnamon to the cake mix, AND 2 peaches and cream instant dry oatmeal packets, and 2 apples and cinnamon instant dry oatmeal packets. I would've added oatmeal, but didn't have any. I suppose that would work just as well, probably 2 cups worth. Used one stick of margarine, small dots all over the top. No problems with it being too runny, my butter covered well enough because there were no dry spots. This is fantastic. I will make it again and again. I have even forwarded it to many of my friends! Thanks!

Very Good.  Used one 16 ox can peaches, and single layer cake mix.  Sprinkled cinnemon on peaches and juice, added cake mix, cut butter, sprinkled cinnemon and added pecans half's.

This was YUMMY, but I did double the peaches. Also, I used peaches in fruit juice rather than heavy syrup. Still tasted great.

O.M.G! Amazing! I accidentally used pie filling instead of peaches in syrup...and it still turned out great! I used pampered chef's "cinnamon plus" blend and it really brought out the flavors. I'm sharing this recipe with all of my friends! Thanks for sharing!

Very good...if you're looking for a quick way to do the butter w/out melting it (I don't like the way it turns out w/ melted butter)...freeze the cube of butter and then grate it with a cheese grater over the cake mix.

This is delicious!     I have to tweek it though because I live in Brazil and our peaches and cakes are different size packages! haha  I just did rough amounts and it worked... but I can tell that if the porportions were perfect... it'd be even better!

YUMMO! I make different variations of "dump cake" and it's always gooooood. I throw a stick of butter in the freezer a few minutes before I plan to use it. I cut the stick in half length wise then cut the halves in half- I then cut these up into thin pats. I think next time I will drain a bit of the syrup from the 2nd can as this was a bit to liquidy for me, thought the syrup would thicken up- but no... Easy Peasy

Easy and tasty!!  This is a very good but I agree, it is a  sweet dessert and may not be for everyone. I leave the cinnamon out and I add another tablespoon of cut up butter ( and a few shakes of salt on top as I like sweet and salty together).  My oven may be off because it took closer to an hour for my top to brown.  This is one of my go to quick desserts! Thanks =)

I was very skeptical, but this turned out delicious!  I used peaches canned in their own juice and also sprinkled a little bit of brown sugar on the top before baking.  I topped with real whipped cream (not the stuff in the tub) before serving.   I will definitely make again .... and again......

I'm trying to figure out why this turned out so poorly.  I'm spooning out dry cake mix from this dish and what topping did get moist tastes  and feels like mush.  I'm going to keep looking for a recipe I'll use over and over again.

Although I carefully grated cold butter all over the surface, there were still a LOT of dry, powdery pockets of plain cake mix.  The concentrated cake/butter mix on top tasted too salty/powdery, and ruined the home-canned peaches beneath.

This was the easiest dessert I have ever made.  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream and my husband thought I slaved all day.  I will be making this a lot.

Every time there is a family gathering, I am always asked to make this favorite desert. I made a little variation to this recipe. I sprinkle brown sugar over the top and I also add chopped walnuts. This gives it a nice crisp top and also it adds a nice flavor.

This is fantastic with 1/2 package of instant vanilla pudding mixed in with 3 cans of peaches and juice to thicken up the liquid. I also topped the butter with 1/2 cup of brown sugar and topped with cinnamon. It wasn't soggy at all. The crust on top was crispy and delicious!

So easy to make! I did drain a little bit of juice from one of the cans of peaches, as mentioned before ... I also grated the butter across the top rather than cut in slices ... The grated butter worked wonders!! SO EASY TO MAKE!

I made this and I didn't drain the peaches because the directions didn't say to, and it was completely watered down and didn't taste very good.  I had very high hopes for it because it smelled absolutely divine while it was baking.  I dumped in two cans of peaches, sprinkled the dry cake mix on top and then sliced up butter all over the top and baked.  The top (crumble) tasted awesome, but it didn't really absorb that much of the liquid and I think even more liquid came out of the peaches too.  The crisp top was basically just floating like a big crispy island on the liquid.  After letting it sit a while to cool it did start to absorb some of the liquid but now it's a big soggy mess with still some excess liquid in the bottom.

Sooo Good! Make sure to loosen the clumps in the cake mixture before dumping it on top of peaches or you'll get hard-ish clumps of cake in a bite.  Although so delicious, I think next time I'll use 3 cans of peaches (in heavy syrup) but drain one can.  Using salted butter helps cut the sweetness a bit.  Have a big ol glass of cold milk on hand!!!

I took this to the office and it disappeared in a couple of hours.  A keeper!  Like other reviewers, I used peaches in lite syrup, used only half the juice, sprinkled cinnamon over the peaches before putting on the cake mix, and sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon on top.  I put the butter in the freezer and shredded it before putting on the cake.  I think slicing it would work too.  This comes out way more like a cobbler than a cake, but so incredibly simple and so incredibly delicious.  Next time I'll serve with vanilla ice cream.  YUMMY!

I consider this recipe to be my secret weapon for impressing guests at dinners or picnics.  It is soooooo easy. I use freestone peaches to give it a taste that rivals cobblers made from home-canned or fresh peaches.  I also sprinkle nutmeg and cinnamon directly on top of the peaches before adding the cake mix. Top this off with some premium vanilla ice cream and listen to the compliments roll in!!!

SO easy to make right out of your cupboard!  I make one change to try to remain (semi) healthy - 

instead of slicing butter all over the top and adding tons of calories/cholesterol, I smear a light layer of applesauce over the yellow cake mix.  It doesn't come out crispy like a cobbler, but more moist like a regular cake.  Try it if you're interested in saving some calories!

My husband and I are giving this recipe 5 stars because it was simple, quick and very tasty! A nice switch from the apple version I make. I had always used melted butter but after grating the butter like someone else suggested, I will continue to do that frm now on. Just gives better butter coverage. I also drained the peaches. I might try adding some berries and making a melba sometime. Thanks for the great weekday recipe!

I made this yesterday a nd It came out great. I made it in a 9X9 and I only used about 3/4 cake mix. My only suggestion that i didnt do is to flatten out the clumps, and make sure its flat before I toppe dit with butter. I cant wait to try with variations!

I give this a five because it was easy and tasted good.  I did notice that the cake batter crust had inconsistent texture.  Some parts of the cobbler had gritty texture.  Still giving this a five because I probably didnt press the cake mix into the peaches enough.  I will add a extra peaches and syrup next time.

we only had one serving of this, it was ok, but I did what others recommended and that was to mix the juice from the peaches into the cake mix.I also added an egg to the cake mix, maybe I shouldn't have.
Other than that it turned out fine, not soggy, but the taste was just not there for us. I usualy make peach cobbler from scratch.
Thanks though

So good! I used peeled and sliced fresh peaches sprinkled with a little white and brown sugar. I used another reviewer's idea and shredded a chilled stick of butter over the cake mix--this worked great at evenly distributing the butter.

Served warm with vanilla ice cream--to die for!

My husband was making funny "yummmm" and "Ummmhmmm" noises as he ate it- and he couldn't believe it tasted soooo good, but was so easy to make (he saw me make it from start to finish in approx 5 minutes).  I did add (as previous reviewers mentioned) some nutmeg to the peaches and some cinnamon + brown sugar on top.  I would give this a 4.5**, but to be a 5 it needs a little bit MORE filling.  Adding another can of drained peaches would likely do the trick.  Thanks!

A friend told me of a similar recipe and it was GREAT!  Also, for a change, you can use cherry pie filling with a little added water and a chocolate cake mix - instant chocolate covered cherry taste!  Try it - you will like it!

What a quick and easy recipe!  I made it for my family tonight and there is not 1 piece left!  Just incase anyone else has this dilema..the store I went to did not have a yellow cake mix so I bought a vanilla cake mix instead.  It was very good! I would recommend this to anyone!  I will definately make this again!

This is GREAT!!  I got lots of compliments!!!!  I only had one change.  I didn't think that 2 cans were enough peaches so I used 2 full cans and then drained the juice from the 3rd can and just used the peaches.  Seemed to work just fine.  Will use this again!!  THANKS!

Very, very easy to make when you are short of time and ingredients for something more fancy. Tasted better with some frozen raspberries sprinkled in with the peaches (about 1/4 cup)for a Peches Melba effect and color.

If I could give this 6 stars I would! I just made this and ate almost a third of it myself, and I'm not a big girl! I used a 29 oz can of peaches, Pillsbury Moist Deluxe yellow cake mix, and squirt butter all over the top. This was much easier than chipping up the butter and saved time because it only needed to cook 30-35 minutes! DELICIOUS!

I just made this today and it was by far, the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted.  I didn't know that peaches could be cooked wrong...  Maybe there was too much syrup in the canned peached I bought because the cake mix just turned into liquid and settled to the bottom.  I did everything accourding to the recipe and I don't know how other people who've reviewed this came out with dry patches!  Mine was pure goo and I won't make it again.  I'll stick to my Granny's recipe and forget about taking shortcuts.

This dessert is almost an exact replica of a peach cobbler my family enjoyed at our local restaurant. The only addition I made, 1/4 cup of brown sugar sprinkled atop the cake mix.

This recipe was very good and very easy.  I used a 29oz. can of peaches in heavy syrup and used the entire cake mix, but put it in a smaller baking dish because the peaches didn't cover the bottom of the 9x13 inch pan. I only baked it for 35 minutes and it was getting quite brown on the top, anymore time and it would have been ruined. My guests liked it served warm with Cool-Whip.  This is a recipe that I will try again with different fruits.  Thanks!

This is a wonderful recipe, except I have to use my own canned peaches, but I know, I'll just make the water sweet with a bit of sugar.  Thanks, Cathy

I enjoyed this as a variation to the traditional peach cobbler. As previously recommended, I topped with brown sugar as well as cinnamon and I really enjoyed that. I served this warm with ice cream. Yum!

Ok...not trying to be funny...just trying to figure out how some folks got it wrong?? This was my 1st time making this and it came out perfect. I crumbled graham cracker crust up and layered the bottom. Put in the peaches and put brown sugar & cinnamon on top. Then I put a layer of cream cheese over that. I mixed the cake mix in a bowl and added brown sugar, white sugar and cinnamon then poured it on the peaches. I forgot to press it down. I put the butter pieces on then drenched it with coconut oil. ( I use coconut oil anytime something calls for butter.) I cooked it until it was brown. I let it sit for 2 hours before digging in. It was the best cobbler I have ever tasted.

For all of those who have small families a tip just for you. I made this using 1 can of peaches and 1 box of Jiffy cake mix (9oz).  Use cinnamon and brown sugar topping as you choose. I used a 9 inch deep pie pan baked 35-40 minutes and it worked out great.  Its just the two of us and we both had 2  large servings.

This is a classic dump cake made with peaches. The recipe needs nothing more added unless you like some coconut as a third layer.  I saw some people whining because they thought the cake mix should be prepared the way it is on the box. I'm just dying for these know it alls to try it and see what happens: peach cakebread . Yuck.  Jessica has it right. If you want sprinkle some nutmeg on there.. Otherwise this is a spot on recipe for any dump cake. You use DRY cake mix. This came out great as my dump cakes always do. It's easy and you serve with some vanilla ice cream. Everyone likes this. Thanks Jess for refreshing my memory. I didn't change at thing and it's beautiful, bubbly and brown on top..

I have been making this recipe for 5 years now and everyone I serve it to absolutely loves it!

I use peaches in light syrup or their own juice. I sprinkle cinnamon onto the peaches and 1/4 C brown sugar over the cake mix. Gives it a nice little crust.

are you guys ready for this?! I used red velvet cake instead of yellow (all I had on hand)and drained the juice from one can of peaches. I melted the butter in the microwave and poured over top. It came out awesome! I will defiantly make this again

This was always called "Peach Dessert" by my family, hence we had no expectations of pie crust. When we first made this in the 1950's, the recipe called for "Gladiola Yellow cake mix" and if we tried any other brand, it just wasn't anywhere near as good. When Gladiola stopped making our beloved cake mix...we thought this was the end forever of "Peach Dessert" Since it was so loved by not only us but every one we fixed it for (I used to make it when I was only 11 years old) we compromised and used other brands...still better than no PD at all! "Dump cake" became popular in the 80's maybe a little earlier, and it was very different because it was made with pie filling not canned peaches. Today when we make this dessert, we have come to learn that it must be eaten warm right away because it's just not that good days later. So my suggestion is make it only for enough people to consume as it comes out of the oven.... just like pancakes...they aren't as good re-warmed up the next day. So if you wait to taste it the next day and base your reviews on that.....no wonder!...LOL :)  oh yeah and 55 mins is way too long in my oven.....45 mins is all.

I  just tried making this today due I didn't have anything sweet in the kitchen. I followed the recipe as written but I added some sugar cinnamon mix on top with a few pecans. I love peach cobbler and this is a keeper for be. Being single might not be a good ideal to make to often...lol.

Holy Cow!! Why didn't I know this was s-o-o-o easy! The hardest part was getting the cake mix boxes open! Since there were no 18.25oz cake mixes on the shelf, I used -2- Jiffy yellow (9oz each) -2- 8x8 pans, easy peesy, -1- can, -1- box to each pan!  I did take another posters advice and added a bit of brown sugar on top of the peaches before "dumping" the cake mix on. -2- pans, one for now and one in the freezer for later (there is only the two of us!) The downside... I made it before I made supper and, of course, had to taste test... Oooopsy!

I froze unsalted butter & then grated it- covered perfectly & took just a couple of minutes to do. I also used 32 oz of frozen peaches thawed in the microwave & poured about a half cup of simple syrup (4 oz water + 2 oz sugar) over them. I also sprinkled a little brown sugar over the top along with the cinnamon.  The peaches turned out great & the top crust was fantastic. Unfortunately there was a little dry cake mix in between (which may have been a result of not using a lot of syrup). Even so, it was a fairly tasty concoction & easy to make. Lot of calories in that butter however so I'm not sure I'd want to do it too often.

Quick, easy and deliciously satisfying!  Great when you want or need something fast.  I always keep canned peaches and a yellow cake mix on hand so I can make this.  It's great to quickly stir together before dinner, pop it in the oven and serve nice and warm with vanilla ice cream for dessert.

It's way too sweet and the cake mix did not absorb completely leaving dry cake powder on top.  It was mushy on the bottom.  I would not make this again.

Yum!  Used fresh peaches and thinly sliced apple because I didn't have canned - cooked for 10 min in simple syrup (1/2sugar 1/2water), then I let them sit in it for awhile.  Drained and topped with mix, slices of butter, a little brown sugar and cinnamon.  Some parts were deliciously crispy.  Served with vanilla ice cream.  Exactly what I needed tonight!

This is a favorite in our house. I think a friend gave it to me years ago. The end product is dependent entirely on the quality of your peaches and the flavor of cake mix you use. I use a golden French vanilla mix, lots of cinnamon and two cans of good quality (in heavy syrup) peaches. I also grate the butter over the top. This distributes it very evenly. Then another sprinkle of cinnamon. Everyone raves about it! Great for family bbq's and larger gatherings where simplicity and an end product that is nearly guaranteed to be good are essential.

Everyone like this dessert, and, it was easy to put together.  I used earlier comments, and put brown sugar on top of cake mix, so husband thought it was just a bit too sweet.  Will definitely make again, without the brown sugar.

I tried this recipe and wasn't pleased with how it turned out. I did use a cake mix with pudding, which another reviewer said not to do but I think possibly the directions should include actually mixing the cake mix into the peaches and syrup. Mine came out with a lot of dry cake mix, still all grainy.

Excellent, delicious, and easy cake.  I made this for my husband's birthday and got rave reviews.  I doubled it and used one large can of homemade peaches and one can of store bought canned peaches.  I added the syrup from about 1/2 of the homemade bottled peaches.  I am also allergic to milk, so I substituted smart balance light original for the butter.  I cut it into the cake mix before adding it on top.  Serve hot!

Just made this after remembering about a similar dessert made for me. Turned out perfectly not runny no dry spots. The only reason i put 4 stars is because it needs another can or 2 of peaches. I love sweet and this one does it!

Delicious! Tastes like something you would order for dessert at a resteraunt and so inexpensive to make. I added brown sugar and sprinkled with oats along with the cinnamon. Serving warm with vanilla ice cream on top is a must! Thank you for a simple yet wonderful recipe.

I made this today and was really pleased. I did drain a bit of the juice from the peaches first. I used peaches in lite juice and was happy I did. I also did use a bit of brown sugar on top per some recommendations. My one suggestion about the butter:use it cold so that is easier to slice up and place on top. Will use this again, and maybe try other canned fruit variations.

Yum! This is soooo tasty! I only had 1 can of peaches so I also added 2 fresh peaches sliced up.  My only issue with the outcome is the brown sugar sort of carmelized into a hard surface across the top.
I'm going to keep experimenting with this.  In fact I just pulled another one out of the oven, but this time I used berry pie filling.  I worked the brown sugar down into the cake mix layer a bit, and lowered the oven temp a bit.  This recipe goes together so quickly and sure gives you a tasty dessert for minimal effort!

OMG, suuuuuper yummy!! And super easy!! I followed the directions and just added 1/2 c brown sugar like others suggested, did not melt the butter but cut it in like the directions state and I did drain some of the juice from the can like other reviewers suggested but I don't think I will do that the next time. The sauce really thickens up as it bakes so I think it could have used a little more juice. But it still tasted great as is and will definitely be making this again!

I followed the advice of others and cut my butter into the cake mix, i also added more peaches (but not the extra juice).  I thought it was too mushy, consistancy was terrible.  My boyfriend liked the taste but i would not make this again.

I make this all the time using pie filling on the bottom and instead of mixing butter in the cake mix take 1 cup of I can't believe it not butter spray or the spray parkay.....mix with the cake mix and then press down on your fruit or pie filling.....sprinkle your nuts or brown sugar and cinnamon on top and spray with a little butter spray... much better I think.

So, I made this recipe two ways. I made it according to the recipe exactly, and then I made it based on other reviewers' recommendations. In following the recipe, I felt like this needed more peaches. So, maybe add another 15 oz can & drain it. Also, I think I would cut the butter into the cake mix next time.  In making it following other people's suggestions, I added another can of peaches (drained) and mixed the cake mix according to the box directions & poured the batter over the peaches. This was horrible! I baked the cake for 45 minutes and top of the cake was golden brown, but the middle was not done at all. It didn't taste good either. I felt like the filling needed to be thicker under the cake. I would suggest following the recipe on this one....don't make the cake batter!

I have always enjoyed this over vanilla ice cream, learned about it from some friends I met while in the service and it just popped into my mind to make and this was exactly what I was looking for.  Very quick easy and economical.

Oh geesh, how easy is this?!  Used a "Butter Golden" yellow cake mix, forget by who, either Betty or Duncan.  I had some cinn/sugar in a shaker already, so I used that on my peaches (lite peaches) Then on top of the cake mix, I did also add some brown sugar and some extra cinnamon.  This was very delish.  I only have a little vanilla ice cream, so I saved that for the others and I had some lite whipped topping so I could give it a try.  It was yumm-o.  Thanks for sharing

A friend made this recipe and thought I picked the fruit out (because I don't like fruit), the cake was delicious!  It does have a strong butter flavor to it, but this is by far the easiest recipe I have ever seen made in my life.

Absolutely delicious!  I made this for a work potluck and we devoured it.  I cut down the butter a little (maybe 1/3 cup instead of 1/2) and it was still moist and delicious.  Next time I think I will add an extra can of peaches (minus the juice) b/c I think it could have used a few more.  I will definitely make this again!

We really enjoyed this. I added some brown sugar to the top of the cake mix, about 1/4 cup, and sprinkled with cinammon, too. I also melted the butter and drizzled it over the top rather than chopping it. Very yummy!!!

I used "Lightly Sweetened" peaches.  As others suggested, I melted the butter before putting it on, but still had to go back and add a few pats in dry spots.  I also sprinkled some brown sugar on right before the butter, but I can tell this would have been five stars even without it.  I had three helpings tonight and will definitely be making it again!!!

I've made this a few times now and my husband and sons love it, but my daughter and I really didn't care for it. But last night I made this and these were the changes - I used 1 can of peaches with the heavy syrup and 1 can with natural juice, I added an additional can of peaches but drained them, added cinnamon and brown sugar to the peaches, and sliced the butter thin to cover the top. With just these few changes it was so yummy, even my daughter and I couldn't resist it! Very easy, tasty dessert.

Very good & easy. Use more peaches, less juice, no additional sugar, but a sprinkle of cinnamon and chopped pecans over peaches before sprinkling on the cake mix. Slice cold butter thin and cover whole top.  Couldn't be any easier.  Also delicious with butter pecan cake mix.

This was sooooo easy and yet VERY delicious!   I used 4 small cans of peaches in lite syrup and added 1/2c of brown sugar to the top as others suggested.  Served it with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and Everyone at work loved it!!!!  There were no leftovers.........I will make this again!

This is by far the best and the only way I will make peach cobbler for now on!  I made a few variations.  I used two large cans of peaches (in light syrup) drained one can completely and the other I dumped all in.  I put a handful of brown sugar on the peaches and sprinked cinnamon and nutmeg, very little.  I spread butter yellow cake evenly and cut land o lakes butter to thin slices and covered the cake well.  This is the trick to get it evenly brown on top.  The crust was crisp and it was just the right amount of sweetness!!!  YUM YUM!!!!  I will definitely make more!!!!!!!!

I followed another reviewer and mixed the cake mix w/ the peaches in the syrup minus 1 cup that I sprinkled on top with slivers of butter. Def. too much liquid with dry spots of mix - so I just stirred it all up. Next time - I will drain the liquid. This is not a cobbler - but a dump cake. And though I had some runny issues - it is really good with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. My Family loved it & for me, that is all that matters.

It was really good! I was skeptical at first and next time I will grate the frozen butter bc slicing it doesn't cover all of the cake batter but besides that I used 2 fresh peaches in a 8x8 pan bc i have two small kids and didn't need alot of this, I mixed in cinnamon, vanilla and sugar and used lemon cake mix. It's a really good contrast and the vanilla ice cream makes it soooooo good!!!! LOL I will make this again bc it's super easy!

DO NOT do what I did. In the name of speed I did as some had suggested and poured the melted butter over the cake mix.The butter was HOT and immediately turned the mixture into one large clump. I spent 15 minutes unclumping it until it resembled crumbs. The end result was peach crumble. I used a butter pecan cake mix, which went well with the fresh peaches. Alls well that ends well.

Delicious and perfect, exactly as written. I used the method of slicing off thin squares of butter and placing them all over the face of the crumb topping before baking ... it really didn't take long. So easy and excellent!

I liked this recipe because it was so easy! I did not use a full stick of butter. (Probably used 5.5 tablespoons) Also, I added some brown sugar. I thought it tasted pretty good, as did my friends. However, most of us agreed that it felt heavy and I personally thought it tasted a bit too sweet. Next time, I will use the peaches in light syrup, or fresh peaches, and I will not add the brown sugar. I think I might also mix the cinnamon into the cake mix itself and sprinkle some extra on top. Overall, good recipe, but I will make it next time with the above changes.

AWESOME! I took this to a family 4th of July party and everyone loved it.  It was gone before everyone had a chance to try it.  It is so easy to make and I will definitely be making it again.  I made it just as the recipe called and had no problems.

Memories of my mother-in-law making this, seems like she melted the butter, so I tried it this way. Came out tasty, everyone enjoyed. A little too runny, next time I will use less juice. Will also try cutting melted marg into cake mix before topping fruit, the original version was not a crumbly topping that I remember.

Delicious!  I followed several other suggestions from viewers.  First, I used a small cheese grater to cover the entire cake with butter (worked like a dream).  Second, I topped with about a half cup of brown sugar sprinkled on top of the butter.  I just sprinkled the cinnamon on top of that.  In the future, I may try adding more peaches.  I like a lot of fruit. Just a personal preference, though.

I followed some of the other members changes.  I like mine with more peaches so I used 2 cans of 29 oz lite peaches, partially drained.  I also mixed them with a little cinammon.  It was so good, I had to make 2 pans for my husbands unit!

My family loved it. We ate the whole dish in one night. The only thing I changed was the cake mix. I used butter flavor because I didn't have yellow cake mix and I used 2 teaspoons of sugar and then I sprinkled it with cinnamon.

I made this several times this fall.  I did change the recipe a bit.  I used two cans of peaches one with juice one without.  For the topping I melted a stick of butter and then mixed the cake mix into it and then sprinkled on top of the peaches.  I have made other dump cakes and it was nice to find a new variation.

Going middle of the road on this one for several reasons ... and a suggestion.  First, it is very sweet and definitely needs the cinnamon others have suggested.  Next, the texture is neither cake or cobbler but somehow pulls off the taste of both. Overall, its an okay, quick dessert and what was expected from a few boxed/canned items. Now for the suggestion: I actually divided the ingredients into two square pans because I had seen a similiar recipe that included a small can of drained pineapple on top of the peaches with syrup, and I wanted to try both while testing.  Weeellll, the peach/pineapple recipe disappeared with everyone coming back for seconds, but this version ... just the peach ... got left behind after the first sample.  Maybe something you might want to try when you make your next batch.  :O)

Yummy! I have made this twice so far, the second time I used the cinnamon to blend into the dry cake mix then after spreading the butter I used cinnamon sugar to shake on top making it a crusty, crunchy coating and that was a huge hit. We also found it is actually better the day after. I had it warm too & it was good, but once the cake settles and the cinnamon blends....yeah.

Deeelicious! And soooo easy. I did increase the peaches to 2(28 oz) cans but used only 1/2 of the syrup from the 2nd can. I also sprinkled some brown sugar on top before baking.  Will make again!

Have been making this for years.  My family really enjoys this with a French Vanilla cake mix instead of basic yellow cake.  Melting the butter seems to completely change this, so I always take the time to use cold butter that can be thinly sliced and laid out.  If you don't have ice cream try a simple drizzle of vanilla glaze (milk, powdered sugar, butter, & vanilla extract).

Absolutely wonderful - people have asked for this recipe a lot!!! I used a butter pecan cake mix instead of the yellow, 3 15 ounce cans of peaches, sprinkle chopped pecans and brown sugar/cinnamon on top --- WOW!  If you like coconut, sprinkle some of that on top too!  SOOOOO GOOD!

This recipe was easy and GOOD!!!!! I had to buy more cans of peaches because 2 16oz cans was NOT enough! I had to add 2 more! I shredded cold butter like others suggested (great idea!) AND I added brown sugar to mine as well, I added the brown sugar to the top, on top of the butter, but I think next time I will mix it with the cake batter before putting on top of the peaches because it carmelized too much on the top. Thanks for the easy delicious recipe!

I don't know what went wrong with this one but it was really mushy under the topping.  I pushed the cake into the peaches as instructed. We liked the peaches but the rest was not really edible.

I was a bit nervous to make considering the simplicity of this cobbler, but I am so glad I did.  I made it for a group of 7 friends and they all raved about it.  I served it with french vanilla cool whip and it was heavenly.  Be sure to take a spatula and press the cake mixture into peaches.  Also, I used one large and one small can of peaches and it was perfect!

We all loved it! I used eight fresh peaches without adding any liquid. It turned out just right.

Great recipe.  I used canned peaches in light syrup in order to reduce the sweetness factor.  It turned out great.  It was still sweet, but not sickening sweet.

I've made this several times now and everyone loves it!  Definitely mix the cake mix with peach syrup first.  I melt the butter and spread it with a brush.  Easy and Good!

This is delicious! My husband won't stop asking me to make it! After making it the first time though I decided to drain one of the cans of peaches because it seemed a little too runny. VERY simple, yet tasty!!

Unbelievable.  This is an awesome and soooo easy recipe.  AThis will be something I will try over and over with different canned fruit.  A few modications - I used 3 cans Light S&W Sweet Memory Peaches with Cinnamon and Brown Sugar, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, and added chopped walnuts to the top before baking.  And as other reviewers, I mixed my cake mix with the syrup from the peaches before putting on top of the peaches.  Turned out perfect.

This is really very tasty and smells wonderful while baking. Have it in the oven as your guests arrive and their mouths will start to water!  I added a tad extra butter and I melted it first in order to avoid the dry spots.  I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon to the peaches.  Next time, I may try some chopped nuts on top.  Yummy!

We loved this.  I bought chopped peaches which worked really well.  Next time I would add another can of peaches.  I also added brown sugar with the cinnamon and some pecans coarsly chopped. I drained most of the liquid, I was afraid it would be too runny.  Over all I though this was really delicious and not too sweet for us especially with ice cream.  My husband already asked me to make it again.

This recipe is so easy I could hardly beleive it worked. Use peaches in light syrup if you want a slightly less sweet cake, but be prepared for it to be a bit on the drier side.

We didn't really like this recipe. It was too sweet. My husband and I both thought that the cake mix should have been prepared as normal with water and eggs, etc. then poured over the peaches and baked.

I love this recipe. I could not find 16 ounce cans of peaches in a heavy syrup, but instead I used 1-15 ounce can and a 30 ounce can of peaches in a heavy syrup and it came out perfect. I only had a corner left after my family went back thirds.

It doesn't get any easier then this! My mother made this recipe for years, my sister and I always thought it was her secret recipe, she only recently told me how easy it was. This comes out perfect every time, I have made this with peaches, cherry, and apple pie filling. Always wonderful!!

I made this the other night for dessert.  I have to disagree with the majority of posters...this was a waste of time/ingredients.  Even hubby who will eat anything wouldn't eat more than a couple of bites.  We threw the whole pan out.

Soooo good and easy!  I took this to a family picnic and everyone raved all day about it.  I made a few minor changes to the recipe.  I used one 29 oz can and one 15 oz can of peaches, just drained the smaller can.  I added cinnamon and brown sugar to both the peaches and the topping.  Also added a 1/4 cup more of melted butter to make sure it covered the top.  I baked it about 10 more minutes so it wasn't as runny, it turned out fabulously.

Super easy and fast.  I just love these dump cakes!

I bought fresh out of season peaches and made a simple syrup.  Tossed the sliced peaches in the syrup, added to the pan and continued with the recipe.  What a delightful dessert for a Sunday supper!

Peach cobbler is my husband's favorite dessert, so this was a hit.  Nice and easy -- good variation on a quick, simple, yet oh-so-tasty dessert. As I have made this through the years, I have made a couple of additions/changes. I use one can of peaches WITH the juice (usually the juice rather than the syrup for me) and then drain the other can, as it can get a little too juicy otherwise. I've also changed up the spice combo, added chopped pecans, almonds or walnuts, etc. A chance to "BYOC". Either way, with something this easy, it's almost a little embarrassing when someone (other than the hubbs) tells you that it's the "best thing they've ever tasted!"  (OK, so it was just barely cool enough to serve. And there was ice cream involved. But, a win is a win!)  Thanks, Jessica.

My family loved this, especially warmed up with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!  I used peaches in lite syrup, french vanilla cake mix (just because I didn't have a yellow cake mix on hand), and topped it with 1/4 c. of brown sugar and then the cinnamon before baking.  By the end of the night, the entire pan disapperared!  Thanks for this easy recipe Jessica :)

Okay, so I didn't have any yellow cake mix, so I used Pillsbury Cranberry Quick bread mix, and it came out even better! For those who didn't like it too sweet, the quick bread isn't as sweet. The peaches and little bits of cranberry melded well.  I bet it would taste yummy with apple pie filling instead of peaches as well. Or you could put the apple pie filling and the cinnamon swirl quick bread mix, then the butter.  I am having fun experimenting with this recipe.

This was simple and delicious.  I made it for company and took other reviewers suggestions and sprinkled some brown sugar and pecans on it.  Next time I would crush the pecans much smaller, but I will make this time and time again.  This did NOT turn out soggy or too crispy for me.  I cooked it about an extra 4-5 mins. just to be on the safe side.  Thanks for the killer recipe!

Just a little too sweet for my family.  Probably would be really good with fresh peaches and no sugar on them.  the cake mix contains PLENTY of sugar.

I put the cinnamon over the peaches then mixed the cake mix with the melted butter to create a crumble then sprinkled it over the peaches. Worked like a charm and everyone loved it! Great go to for quick dessert.

Use 3 cans of peaches
MIX WELL!!! The syrup from the peaches will aid in preventing uncooked cake mix
Cook for an hour or more to ensure the cake mix is done

Excellent! This is so easy to make. A couple of things, I could only find a 29 oz. can of peaches in heavy syrup and the cake mixes are now only 15.25 oz. The first time I made it this is what I used but it didn't have enough peaches in my opinion so I drained some of the juice from a 15oz can and added it and it came out absolutely fantastic!!! Don't forget to press the mix down with your hand or a spoon so that the mix will soak up the juice.

I made this  for Fellowship Hour after our Church Service this past  Sunday. It was a huge hit! Not a mouthful left! When asked by a few people how I made it, and I told  them, they couldn't believe it! The only thing that I added was sprinkling on some brown sugar and nutmeg (along with the cinnamon) before placing the thinly sliced butter pieces on top! Oh, and I did cook it for 15 minutes longer. Wonderful and so easy!

I used peaches in fruit juice...3 cans but only used the juice from 1 can. Instead of putting the butter on top, I whirled the cake mix and butter in my food processor and covered the peaches. Added a little brown sugar and the cinnamon on top. Delicious!

We have made this recipe for years! It always turns out great! We even make it in a Cast Iron Dutch oven while camping. Use 14 coals on the bottom & 12 on the lid. Serve with ice cream! Mmmmm!

Very easy and good tasting,  One thing that should be clearly stated is to use chunk peach pieces in heavy syrup.  The recipe doesn't specify this and my husband bought peach slices. Its OK but I think the peach chunks would have spread through the recipe better.

I was disappointed in the flavor of this dump cake. I am a huge fan of cherry dump cake, and since I love peaches, I thought I would give it a try! On my first outing with a recipe, I usually follow the instructions, so on this one, I added the cinnamon, which I questioned. Personally, I don’t care for cinnamon on peaches, I prefer a light addition of nutmeg, very light. I feel this dump cake would have been better using no added spice, and allowing the flavor of the peach to shine on it’s own.

I used a combination of chopped fresh peaches and pears, mixed used only half the cake mix and an egg, mixed it then dotted cubed butter in small pieces on top. Cardamom is especially good with peaches. Tastes wonderful and with only 3 adults living in our house made a better sized dessert for us...also tastes great for breakfast!

I’ve made this for YEARS and it is always a crowd pleaser. I usually cut up the peaches to make sure they cover the bottom of the pan evenly because they put fewer and fewer peaches in the can these days. :( I also prefer to use a butter pecan cake mix and slowly drizzle the melted butter over the top of the dry cake mix. Sometimes I sprinkle chopped pecans on top before baking. We always serve warm with a dollop of whipped topping.

This is what I have found out making dump cakes.      Most the the time we want to have a cobbler warm with ice Cream. Which is delicious. But if you eat a dump cake warm it is soggy. So you need to let it cool so it has a firm consistency. 
Then try. It’s delicious

Great desert!! everyone loved it too! I used a large can of peaches in light syrup and added 1 tsp of cinnamon on the peaches then spread the cake mix and about 1/4 cup of brown sugar on it. I also used a cheese grater for the cold butter and it spread nice and evenly  over the top of the cake. This went well with our summer BBQ!

Very very good! Although, I used peaches in light syrup. Sprinkled those generously with cinnamon and let sit while I followed a previous reviewers suggestion. I cut the butter into cake mix, as if making biscuits. Combined some cinnamon and brown sugar and sprinkled on top which gave it a nice crisp. I'd like to try with some chopped pecans in that brown sugar... this is good stuff, especially with ice cream!

Wow!  What a surprise recipe this is.  This dish came out great!  I was in a panic for a last minute dessert with company coming over.  I'm 99% of the time a make-from-scratch kind of chick.  I was hesitant, but after reading the reviews I went for it .  I had no time to waste.  I like this recipe as it is easy to add to it and still get a delicious cobbler like dessert.  As per some of the review suggestions and my tweaks, I used:  3 cans of peaches using the juice from 2 of the cans, added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon stirred into the peaches in the baking dish, after the cake mix was evenly on top of the peaches, I sprinkled evenly about 1/3 cup brown sugar, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, then grated a VERY cold stick of butter over the top - this makes it easier to get the butter evenly everywhere!   After baking, there was a beautiful slightly crunchy layer of brown sugar/butter, then a nice thin layer of the cake, and then delicious peaches. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Delicious.  Perfect and SO easy!  Saved the day for me. :)

I did make some changes. I used canned peaches packed in juice (2 29 oz cans) drain all of one can & half of the second one 1 1/2 sticks of real butter. I added nutmeg1 1/2 TSP of vanilla extract, & 1TBP lemon juice. The best I've had in a while, quick & easy. Topped with Cool Whip.

I make this quite often for pot lucks and unexpected guests.  I use 1 large can of sliced peaches (undrained) + 1 regular sized can (drained) in it's own juice rather than heavy syrup.  I sprinkle cinnamon over the peaches before covering with the yellow cake mix and pressing it down.  I use real butter and slice a stick in thin slivers so that there is enough to cover the whole cake evenly.  This is the most time-consuming part, but I've tried it other ways and this definitely is the best for appearance and taste (there's no white cake powder showing on the finished product this way.)  I sprinkle the top with cinnamon and then lightly with brown sugar.   We like it best with French Vanilla Cool Whip (when you can find it) or French Vanilla Ice Cream.  Yummy and sooo easy.

This was soooo yummy!! I followed the directions EXACTLY only adding  a wee bit of brown sugar on top. That gave it the perfect sugary crunch! The cinnamon I used is a Saigon Cinnamon and has a sweet smokey flavor!!!  This was easy and sure to be a continued hit!!! #Awesome (wish I could upload the foodie pic I took!)

Very good and very easy, the only recommendation I would make is to use a good quality can of peaches, I used a cheap brand and as you know there arent as many peaches in a discount brand.

This was so easy and so delicious! The only change u made was the topping, I did 1/2 C Brown sugar, 1 tablespoon of cinnamon, A half teaspoon of nut meg, and a teaspoon of vanilla, mixed that up and sprinkled it all across the top. Oh, I also took the advice of another reviewer and froze the stick of butter and graded it all across the top of the dry cake mix. It turned out perfect everybody loved it! Not soggy at all

Usually i only do this with canned peaches or pears and white or yellow cake... but I did recently make it with jarred cherries and chocolate cake - oh soooo good!!! And to go along with others no way should you melt the butter before hand - thinly slicing or grating is the best.

I made this but I drained the juice and added corn starch and some sugar to taste and boiled it so it is more like a pie filling. And I slice the margarine on top. I think it would be more even on top. IT IS SOOOOO GOOD. And it is the first dessert gone when I take it to outings.

Great recipe; I will make this again! I did add 1/3 cup of brown sugar sprinkled on top, then cinnamon. I did not melt the butter, rather I cut it into small pieces and laid them on top throughout. Came out just like a cobbler! It's so good warmed up with a scoop of ice cream. Thanks for sharing!

Okay, you can laugh.  This is the first review I've written and the lack of 5 stars is my fault, but I didn't want anyone else to make the same mistake.  I followed a couple of other's suggestions with adding blueberries, the brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg and I grated the frozen butter on top although the darned stuff thaws out too fast and was all over my hands.  I thought I memorized the recipe from the office (computer) to the kitchen, but when I finished and came back to check the oven time, I saw that I has missed "Press down firmly."  So, I threw a piece of waxed paper over the butter and spices and pressed down.  Well, most of it stuck to the waxed paper and I had to scrape it off and gob it back down on top of the still fairly dry cake mix. Are you laughing yet?  Fortunately, I only made this because I had a big can of peaches and wanted to do something with them, so no one else was expecting cobbler tonight.  I just took it out of the oven and it looks like a spotted leopard.  I tasted a corner of it and it tastes pretty good even though it's uglier than sin.  A bit too sweet for me though -- think I'd leave off the brown sugar next time.  Better luck to you guys.  It should have been much easier!

If you want to cut down on the sweetness and/or cut down on the carbs, there is an easy fix.  My husband's family calls this Fruit Cocktail Cake.  So we use 2 cans of fruit cocktail, 1 of peaches and 1 of pears, cut into pieces.  (14 oz cans, not the big one)  I drain the juice out of most of the cans and just make sure the fruit is moist.  Then use sugar free cake mix on top.  Like everyone says, good easy recipe.  Wonderful taste and nobody ever thinks its dry cake mix!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is even better with 1/2 tsp salt added to the cake mix, and the final topping melted butter drizzled over the cake mix topped with 3/4 C chopped pecans, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  For an added twist, add 1/2 C drained crushed pineapple to the peaches!  Yum~~!

I've always loved peach cobbler when camping so this is perfect for just hanging out at home!  The only thing I would change next time is I would drain half of the peach juice out. Of course I added ice cream only way to do it :)

OMG! This is so good. I somewhat followed this recipe (I only had one can of peaches) and may have used more butter (melted) than required, but this turned out so good. I have make sure I keep all of the ingredients in my pantry and fridge at all times! It's so easy to make for when you're craving sweets and soooo good!

I LOVE this recipe! I always have cake mixes on hand and this is a great change for an all day treat. I make mine a little crunchier on top by adding Rolled Oats and brown sugar and cinnamon. I love I can toss this together and forget about it in the oven for a while and keep making dinner.

This was my first dump cake experience.  I grated the butter on top and used lite canned peaches, but otherwise followed instructions as written.  Top was unexpectedly crispy!  My family seemed to like it.  People had seconds. Personally I found it very sweet, even with the lite peaches and probably won't go out of my way to make this again.

My family loves peach and apple cobbler....I love this recipe because it is quick and easy!  I tweak it just slightly though.  I usually use 2 cans of apple pie filling instead of peaches.  I sprinkle cinnamon on top of the apples and again on top of the cake mix.  I always melt the butter and drizzle on top especially around edges....and last but not least I sprinkle a cup of dark brown sugar across the top for a crispier topping.  It always turns out awesome!!!!

Made this yesterday but used a box of Jiffy Cake mix, which was the perfect amount of cake mix.  I also added to the peaches 1 tbl spoon of brown sugar and then cinnamon.  After adding the cake mix, I sprinked a lil more cinnimon and added sliced butter throughout.  It didn't last for more than 20 minutes in our house.  Definately a great quick treat for after dinner.

Yum! This was FANTASTIC. Not only was this SUPER easy to prepare, it was also well-received by my dinner guests. Because I had little time or energy to prepare an elaborate dessert (I focused all of my effort on Easter dinner), this was a perfect choice for me. I literally prepped this in under 5 minutes. Other than subbing peaches in light syrup (trying to appease a diabetic), draining one can of them (I feared a soggy outcome otherwise) and mixing my cinnamon and peaches together, I made no changes. As if this isn't great as is, my only suggestion for next time is to either a) double the amount of peaches called for or b) bake everything in a smaller (i.e. 8 x 8 in.) dish instead. I like a thick cobbler. There was just enough of it to form a very thin layer in my 9 x 13 in. stoneware pan. :( Served wtih Ben & Jerry's cinnamon roll ice cream, this was the BOMB! Thanks SO much for sharing, Jessica!

Not bad for a very simple, easy recipe.  Bf was a bit put off the first time I served it bc some of the topping was a bit hard, but if you heat it that deals with it.  He's still a bit baffled, but it's a quick, easy cobbler that used up both peaches and a cake mix, so I thought it worked well.  I used cherry chip cake mix and it worked.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is an absolute favorite in our house and we have experimented with just about every kind of canned fruit and haven't found too many that don't work out well.  The only thing that we have noticed is that fruit in it's own juice needs to have just the juice from one can.  I'm sure it's because there is less sugar so it doesn't make a real gooey syrup, but it still works well and tastes great.

I take it to potlucks and everyone is shocked that it's not a time consuming process.

Great recipe!  My family requests it all the time.  I put the butter in the freezer for a few minutes and it makes it very easy to get thin slices. Very easy and it tastes great!  I serve it with vanilla ice cream. Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good. I melted the butter beforehand as well, and there was still one teeny tiny crumbly spot - still wasn't bad! Keep an eye on this because it will burn quickly. All in all it's a pretty good dessert, though not the cobbler I'd use for the 4th of July.

So wonderfully EASY...that is the best part. It is delicious as well. Everybody loved it. I was in a pinch to make something quick. I didn't have any yellow cake mix on hand so I used a box of carrot cake mix. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it came out very yummy. Served it with a nice vanilla custard sauce.

VERY VERY easy to make.  I added more cinnamon than required, and also sprinkled brown sugar on top of the very thiny sliced butter.  I only used about 1/2 of the cake mix box...I think using any more would have been too powdery since I partially drained the peaches.  It was quite delicious!

Have made this several times as written.  Turns out good every time.  I made it with a butter pecan cake mix today and it is even better.  I personally melt the butter and drizzle over the whole thing.  Enjoy!

This was so easy. It took well under 10 minutes to prepare. Everyone seemed to like it and the smell was awesome as our friends arrived for a cook out.

Wonderfully easy and delicious dessert to make!  My 6- and 8-year-olds did most of the work.  I used peaches in light syrup and at the suggestion of others, sprinkled with brown sugar as well as the cinnamon.  I baked mine in a convection oven and it was done in about 30 minutes.  So good served warm with vanilla ice cream!!

I have mead a version of this recipe for years and LOVE it.  What I do differently is this:   1) I use a box of spice cake mix in place of the yellow cake mix.  2) I take a heaping spoonful of the cake mix and stir it into the fruit.  3) I slice the butter in to pieces and place them on to and also sprinkle brown sugar abd cinnamon on the top (I just take it out of the bag and sprinkle it until the top is lightly covered).  finally I frequently make this in a dutch oven (with feet and a rimmed top) while we are camping.  when I do this I line the pan with foil to make cleaning easier. Once the charcoal is ready place 9 coals on the ground, then 18 on the top. It takes about 40 min.  Note- you do need to watch this, rotate the pan occasionally to avoid hot spots. Towards the end take a peek inside (lifting the lid with pliers) to see how its doing, you don't want the sugar to scorch.  If you have a large group you can stack the ovens with nine coals on the bottom and in between ovens and 18 on the top oven.   Yum!!!

5 stars......I needed to make 2 cakes so I used 1 1/2 29oz cans of peaches in light syrup for each pan.  Then I mixed a spice cake and butter brickle cake mix together.  Omitted the cinnamon then.  Very delicious!!!

This was soo easy to make. I dumped the peaches in the baking dish then sliced them. My daughter dumped the cake mix over the peaches and put the pieces of butter ove the cake mix. Turned out great.

What a wonderfully easy and delicious dessert to make with a bunch of girl scouts!  I used 2 cans of peaches in juice, draining one of them.  And the girls took turns cutting the butter in the cake mix with a pastry blender until crumbly.  It insured uniform distribution of the butter.  Baked it a little longer, but the edges browned nicely.  A big hit with whipped cream.

Yummy! This tastes amazing warm and pretty good at room temperature. I used peaches in extra light syrup and drained off about half the syrup. My cake was not at all soggy, but perfectly moist. Thanks! :)

Didn't change a thing and I loved it!! My boyfriend is from Georgia so he is a big fan of peach cobbler, I came across this recipe and I thought it would be an interesting alternative - soooo good! Never lasts very long (thanks to me :]) and is a favorite in my house now! Can't wait to make it again!!

I mixed the drained peach syrup and 1 stick of melted butter into the dry cake mix (I used butter recipe yellow mix) and poured over the peaches, sprinkled with cinnamon and baked for about 30 minutes.  This makes a very quick good desert with little work.  I find it to be a cross between cake and cobbler, not quite one or the other.  Kids loved it - I found it a bit sweet, but will use light syrup peaches next time.

My mother started baking this cake in the 70's...I changed mine up a little.  I found thinly sliced butter is better than melted and I put brown sugar (I use lite syrup peaches) and chopped pecans on top!  It's a great cake for last minute guests or if you're feeling something sweet fast...it's a pantry staple.  Also most fruit pie fillings work too.

This is very good.  I love peach cobbler and this is a great way to change it up a bit.  I like sprinkling the top with chopped pecans and sometimes even add crushed pineapple with the peaches.

SO good and SO easy! I did use LITE peaches instead of the heavy syrup.  This was still REALLY sweet, even with the lite, so I will always use those.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe overall, but I made changes.  The first time I made it I did as written and found it very very sweet, and I usually like very sweet things.  Second time I made it I used two large cans of peaches, drained the juice out of one, and only used enough cake mix to cover the top, which was about 3/4 the box.  The second time was MUCH better.  I served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  It is super easy, and have a good flavor...can't be easier for the taste!

This was really good!  I'm not usually a fan of peach desserts, but for some reason it sounded good today.  I only had one can of cinnamon brown sugar peaches, so I mixed in some frozen unsweetened strawberries.  Since I was using peaches that already had cinnamon in them, I omitted the cinnamon from the recipe.  I tried to follow another reviewer's suggestion for grating the butter, but that didn't work so I just sliced it really thin and laid it evenly over the top of the cake mix.  It was delicious!  I topped it with whipped cream, but next time I think I want to try vanilla ice cream.

This is amazing!!! I made it and everyone loved it! I followed the recipe and enjoyed it a lot. The second time I made it I followed a reviewers suggestion and mixed the peach juice with the cake mix this made the cake a lot more even in texture and better overall!! I would give this 10 stars if I could!!

So I absolutely stink at any type of baking. A five year old could do this it's so easy! I used store bought peach pie filling and then grated butter/margarine on the top covering the entire pie area. It turned out AMAZING!! I also put in two pie pans and baked at 350 for 30 minutes and golden brown on top, YUMMSTER!!

I tried this out with my boys which is the acid test for me. Not only did they love it, but their friends did too. I used the suggestion of melting the butter and pouring over the recipe.  This one is a keeper!

This is soooo good!!!  I took some of the other cooks' advice, and drained some of the syrup from the peaches to avoid the sogginess.  I also sprinkled the peaches with about 2 tsp of cinnamon, and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I also topped the cake batter with cinnamon. I melted the butter, and I used a spray margarine to avoid the dry patches that others mentioned. I topped it with whipped cream. It smelled soooo good while it was baking too!!!!  Thanks a lot!!!!

This is very tasty.  I love the crust, but the heavy syrup in the peaches made this one a little too sweet for me.

This recipe is amazing and kids love it.  I made it for high school kids and they have requested it repeatedly and it is soooo easy to make not to mention very inexpensive.  I sprinkle the cinnamon on top the peaches and on top the cake mix.  I also add about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar which I sprinkle on the peaches too before adding the cake mix.

This cake was pretty good - not bad but not fantastic, hence my middle-of-the-road 3-star rating.  It was super easy - my husband thought I was crazy just dumping everything into the pan without mixing it!  I drained about half of the juice from the peaches, just so they weren't swimming in it, but still felt like this cake was a bit soggy.  Putting cinnamon on the peaches definitely helped the flavor.  We ate this and enjoyed it well enough, but probably not enough to make it again.  But thanks, though - it was a fun experiment!  :)

This recipe deserves a 5 star for being easy and fast, but a 4 star for creativity. I have been making what my small children called "Dumptruck cake" for years.  You can use every kind of filling.  Cherry and Pineapple mixed together is good.  With apple pie filling, I add oats and cinnamon. Fruit cocktail is good.  You can even do pumpkin at Thanksgiving time.  Just follow the pie recipe for your pumpkin, then throw your topping on.  Like a previous person said, you can change the type of cake mix you use, but I like yellow cake the best. Things you can add to change it, nuts, cinnamon, brown sugar, oats, coconut, ect.  This is the dessert I make when I have "short notice" about company. Or if I'm too busy to get fancy!!

Love this!  So fast and so good! I do add another can of peaches, drained, so we have lots of fruit and I use the kind in juice or lite syrup.  I have had no trouble with "dust" on top. It's come out with a crisp topping every time!

try adding a small vanilla pudding to the lite peaches..gives it more of a peach cobbler look.  you can also try adding oats,nuts and brown sugar to the cake mix to make it more like a peach crisp..
using spice cake instead of the butter cake mix is not bad either. There is so many different ways to make this...but it's always easy and always good

Amazingly good! I took the advice of fellow cooks and changed the following: I used peaches with light syrup and poured off half of the syrup. I sprinkled 1/4 cup packed brown sugar ontop of the cake mix. I used *very* cold butter and a small grater and grated the butter all over the cake and sugar. This recipe is my new favorite.. I can not wait to try other fillings/fruits.. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Turned out GREAT! I followed other tips and melted the butter. I used a white cake mix because thats all I had on hand. This is a Keeper. Perfect with vanilla ice cream.
This is a awesome recipe for kids to make. While its in the oven let them make homemade ice cream!!

I've made this for years.  I always melt the better as well.  I also put a little cinnamon and nutmeg right in the melted butter. Lastly, I sprinkle a little sugar over the top of the cake before puting it into the oven.  It's also great with crushed pineapples in heavy syrup and a pineapple cake mix.

This turned out perfectly for me!  I didn't drain the peaches at all.  I followed one reviewer's advice and applied the butter by using a fine cheese grater and a frozen stick of butter.  I also sprinkled about 2 T. of sugar on top of the cobbler about 15 minutes before it came out of the oven.  Thanks for this easy and delicious recipe!  I will definitely make it again.

I don't think this had enough peaches, it could definitely use an extra can.  I used most of the juice and it wasn't too soggy.  I didn't care for the flavor of the cake either but I'm sure that had to do with the mix I chose.  My fiancé who isn't a dessert eater ate all of his then finished mine.

I used a pastry cutter to blend the butter and the cake mix and tossed some pecans in, too.  It's a MUST to double the peaches, I can't imagine not doing it.  This recipe is so quick, easy and inexpensive.  It's a definite keeper!

It was ok, but pretty much tasted like cake mix and peaches.  No big "Wow!"
However, I will say that if you are in a bind where you need to throw something into the oven in 90 seconds to take to a party....this is a good candidate.

This is yummy. I used a 28 oz can of peaches and a 16 oz can too. I melted the butter instead of slicing (I really don't see what difference it makes if I melt or slice). I topped it off with chopped pecans (lots of them) and a whole lot of cinnamon. Served with vanilla ice cream. This is my new favorite dessert.

So dang easy and good! Definetely something you could throw together at the last minute. I think chopped pecans would be an excellent addition if you like nuts.

This is SO simple & deliscious!!!! I add uncooked oatmeal sprinkled on top before baking & some nutmeg w/ the cinnamon.  You get a BIG hit for a little effort!!!  I also cut up the peaches (after dumping in the dish) into chuncks, makes it easier to serve & eat. Enjoy!!!

This is really good. I used two cans of light peaches. Also instead of melting the margarine I sliced up a stick and a half into small slices and put them on top of the cake mix. I think this way you get better coverage and you get no dry spots. I will definately make this again.

Tried this recipe, for the short time it took to prepare, I thought it was good. Used peaches in light syrup instead of heavy syrup, if I didn't it would of been way too sweet.

This was pretty ordinary.  Two cans of peaches didn't cover the bottom of my baking dish, so I rummaged around in the cupboard and found a can of mango slices which I added. Other than that, I made no changes.  This was certainly edible, and as my husband says "Hey, it's dessert."  But I probably won't make it again.  There are too many other intriguing recipes on this site.

I made this for Father's Day, and not a crumb was left. It was SO easy to make. The only thing I did different, was I melted the butter and drizzled it. I can't believe what a success it was. My son is bugging me to make more. Thanks!

This recipe is very easy, but I feel it lacks some taste. If I make it again, I will add some sugar to the cinnamon and possibly some to the peaches.

Oh my gosh, SO GOOD! I had just picked a ton of fresh peaches from the orchard, so I cut a small 'x' into the skins and placed them in boiling water for about 1 minute. Then dumped them in ice water to cool, peeled and chopped them. It was so fresh, sweet.

My mom makes this, too, it is so easy and so good! My mom's recipe says to use Butter Brickle cake mix, if it can be found, I found a Butter Pecan cake mix and it was divine! I divided it up between 2 8" cake pans and cooked them for probably closer to an hour. One pan I took to work and it was gone by the afternoon. The other pan stayed home w/me and, darn, no body in the house likes peaches, so I had to eat it all by myself! ;) Thanks for sharing the recipe, Jessica!

This dump cake is awesome, we make it in a dutch oven over the campfire when we go camping.  I also have substituted 1 can cherry pie filling and 1 20oz can of crushed pineapple with juice for the peaches. YUMMY!!!

This recipe was the best ever. I was looking for a good and easy peach cobbler recipe, and I think I have found it. My son the picky eater loves it also. I just made it on Saturday, and today (Wednesday) I am making it again. The recipe says that it makes 24 servings, I think it was more like 6 servings!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and this very unappetizing. It didnt resemble cobbler at all. Granted, it was extremely easy to make, but I wouldnt do it again. We didnt enjoy this dessert at all.

WOW!  This recipe is so darn good!  It exceeded my most lofty expectations and so EASY to make!  You don't even have to grease or flour the pan.  I will be making this recipe over and over again.

When you want a cobbler that is quick and easy, this recipe is perfect.  My husband (who doesn't like sweets) ate half of the dessert the first night. It was good.

Wow this is so good!  My hubby, who normally does not like peaches, loved this since the peaches are a bit toned down by the cake and cinnamon.  Thanks for this easy, yummy recipe!

Excellent and soooo easy!  I substituted peaches in lite syrup (only because I bought the wrong kind of peaches)and still got raves from the office.

I think the hint to add less juice would make the cake rise a bit more.  Therefore I will try this recipe again ----otherwise I would have deleted it.

Was ok...didn't drain the peaches which added some more liquid.  Also added some cinnamon and sugar as topping.  Will make again, as it's easy.  Be careful to not overbake as it dries out quickly.

This was the best dessert that I have made in awhile.  Not only did it taste great the prep was a so quick.  In fact I made this while I finished dinner so that when I pulled dinner out of the oven in went dessert!! My only advice is that I used a cheese grater to spread the butter, it worked well.  Next time I might try to make it the less sweet way.

This was as easy to prepare as opening the cans of peaches!  My in laws were in from out of town and we were having dinner at my grandmothers so they could all meet and i fixed this desert and everyone flipped over it!  It took no time to prepare so i didn't miss a moment with the in laws but it tasted like i had slaved over it all day, great recipe i will definatley pass it along thanks for sharing!

This was really good, but it is really sweet as well. I loved how simple it is. Next time I'll probably use more butter, to avoid having the powder mixture on some of the cake.

Wow, this was the best cobbler, definitely not "cake-like".  I made it for my fiance who was not interested in anything having to do with peaches.  But he changed his tune when he came in from yardwork to find this wonderful addition to our dinner.  We cleaned it out in a matter of days.

This recipe was a good starting place. The 1 can of peaches did not fill the bottom of a 9 x 13 inch pan, or even the 7 x 11 inch pan that I used. I added a can of cherry pie filling as well, and it turned out great. I also decided to get a more "cobbler" feel by adding some plain instant oat meal (not maple or anything, although peaches & cream may be good too). I added 2 pouches (although 3 would be better) and mixed them with sugar and melted margarine. I spread the mix on top of the cake mix and baked it all together. It did take a long time to bake and dried out on the edges first, but I just covered them with foil and left the middle open until it cooked a little more thoroughly, and then covered the whole thing with foil, until it finished baking. It needed a long time until the cake mix wasn't all mushy and was better the next day warmed in the microwave. Tasted a bit too much like the cake mix, next time I might just skip that part and add flour to the oat meal mix. Great place to start. Thanks!

I really wanted to like this recipe but I don't. It never really cooked properly. Trying to get the center done the top just dried out and got crusty and tough. Next time I will go back to my basic Betty Crocker tried and true and take the time so that the ingredients are not wasted. Sorry!

I'm giving this 2 stars for the ease of making it and 1 star for taste.  This is a good quick dessert if you really need to throw something together in a hurry, but it taste too much like dry cake mix for my taste.  The other reviewers are right in this is very rich.  Have some milk on hand.

Everyone loved it. I followed a few suggestions and topped cake mix with brown sugar, and melted 2 sticks of butter and poured over. It was perfect and everyone loved it.

Best I ever made. Turned out wonderful. I added 1/4 cup brown sugar (sprinkled over cake mix) then cinnamon  and grated butter.  Did have to cook it an addition 15 mins.  This is such an easy recipe. To the lady that said it taste like baking soda, I would suggest she cook it an extra 15-20 minutes. Make sure the top is golden brown when you take it out of the oven.

I made this exactly like the recipe says..its really good but I had an inch of liquid in the bottom of my dish.  When I saw it I first thought I was supposed to drain the cans but looking back at the recipe it doesnt say to drain them. Like I said this tastes really good but way too much liquid in it, we had to scoop the cobbler off the top of the liquid.

Made only one change, wish I hadn't! I changed the sliced peaches with diced peaches. WRONG!  It turned out delish... but the presentation would have been better if they were sliced. Awesome cobbler taste!!

I forgot to take a picture and it is ALL gone already. I made it last night. I used fresh peaches  that I had canned last year. It was so easy and quick to make. I served it with vanilla ice cream. I just stuck to the recipe exactly. I think it is on the menu again for next week end!

Super tasty.  I used fresh peaches and increased amount to make up for the missing juice.  It was excellent.

I used a vanilla cake mix because that's what I had on hand but followed the rest of the directions as written. It is so simple. It was delicious. My family asked me to make it again. It's a keeper.

I took this peach dump cake to an event at our local library and it disappeared in minutes along with the homemade creme fraiche to top it off. I added fresh peaches with the canned peaches since it's peach season here in Vermont and sprinkled the top of the cake mix with a cinnamon-sugar mixture. Now everyone wants the recipe. Wait till they see how simple it is to make!

Easy AND delicious. We love peach cobbler, and this is a recipe that is wonderful even though you use canned, not fresh.
Definitely try the suggestion of a little brown sugar and cinnamon on the top~it not only tastes divine, it makes your kitchen SMELL divine! :>
 BTW,  mine came out better when I partially drained the peaches, but I used "Lite," so that may've made the difference.

I followed SL's suggestion of using 3 cans peaches, adding cinnamon on peaches and topping with brown sugar and cinnamon.  The "crust"  turned out great, reminding me of a crisp more than a cobbler (which was fine to me).  I drained the 3rd can of peaches but when  cooked there was still WAY to much liquid...maybe because one of the cans was fruit juice and not syrup?  The extra peaches are great but also made it overflow the pan when cooking.  The taste/texture were great but will probably only use 2 cans of peaches next time.

Shredded butter and tried to spread evenly but the areas missing butter didnt bake right and was still powder mix. Added butter to these areas after pressing into the fruit and baked another five mins and resolved. Did half cherry with cherry pie filling and half peach in hvy syrup. Worked well and I really liked the crispy pieces that formed. Will def try again but need to find a better assembly method that provides even butter coverage. Maybe tabs spread over entire thing isthe way to go after all.

I made this but used a few of the changes recommended. I added the 1/2 cup of butter to cake mix and blended until it was of a coarse consistency.  Then sprinkled brown sugar on top and some cinnamon.  Everyone loved it!  So easy

I will definitely make it again and no I didn't make any changes; but wished I had bought, cherry pie filling as well. I knew I wanted that variation but could not figure out while in the grocery store which cherries were going to give me the taste that I was craving. It turned out beautifully just the same and the taste was perfect! #loveit

I used fresh peaches as recommended on the other reviews.  By using Duncan Hines classic cake mix and Earth Balance spread, my plant based diners  were able to give this recipe a vegan 5 star review.  coconut ice cream was a tasty addition.

This was super easy to make as the recipe indicates. I was able to put the cake together before the oven was even at temperature. The result was tasty. The butter created a somewhat crunchy toffee-flavored top which enhanced the sweetness of the peaches beneath. Next time I’m going to sprinkle some ground ginger on the peaches before I add the cake mix. I think that will add a nice zing.

Since I am diabetic I made it with sugar free yellow cake mix and fresh peaches with one small can of peaches packed in their own juice without added sugar.  It is delicious.  The only thing I would change would be to use four-five peaches instead of three to increase the peach bottom of the cake.  I loved it though.  And I plan to make it later with pineapple and/or blueberries.

I did tweak the recipe based on other reviews. Added the brown sugar generously on top with the cinnamon and mixed the cake mix with the 1 cup peach juice and 2 eggs prior to pouring on top. The butter shredded with a cheese grater made an amazing crust. Very pretty and tasty!!

My husband says he makes this in the stove top dutch oven cobbler.  Always gets eaten up quickly by the scouts.  I liked it but it was a little too sweet.  Maybe try peaches in their own juice next time.

I made this when we had company for dinner and it was a huge success.  I used some fresh peaches and one can of peaches in lite syrup instead of the heavy syrup and it was just wonderful.  I will make it again soon.  It was so easy.  The cooking time was perfect.

I used fresh nectarines and it came out very good, however, the canned product would probably work better.  Could add some simple syrup to the fruit, which would help up the moisture in it.

Good! I used the grill instead of heating up our house by using the oven and it cooked completely and was delicious with vanilla ice cream. The butter on top gives it some saltiness, to offset the sweet.

EASY! DEF DO THESE TIPS: Freeze stick of butter for at least 24 hrs; easy grating. Grate butter over ENTIRE pan evenly; worth the time.  I used peaches in light syrup. I used my hand and pressed cake mix into very wet peach mix- this is what u want; semi mush like a batter. I used light metal pan 375 middle arch exactly 45 min. Great and would serve guests.

This was super easy, however, I will change a couple of things. I will make it in a smaller and deeper pan. The layers are too thin. I’m also going to use an extra can of peaches to ensure that the cake mix is totally wet. Otherwise, it’s dry and not good.

The cans of peaches I could find were 29oz and 14.5 oz so I used the large one with syrup and drained the smaller one and only used the peaches.
I took the advice of another reviewer and added cinnamon to the peaches, sprinkled on the cake mix, mixed some brown sugar with more cinnamon and sprinkled that on, then the butter.
Served it with butter pecan ice cream.  It was great!

This tastes very good to me, and it is so easy to make. However, there needs to be some adjustments to the recipe's ingredients list as the cake mix and peach can contents, as listed, no longer exist on the grocery shelves.

Make different variations of this in the dutch oven often when camping.  Easy and so yummy as it is, but if you want to kick it up a bit try a Butter Pecan cake mix and sprinkle the top with some chopped nuts and coconut (if you like).  Not sure how some think it tastes like baking soda, as there is no baking soda in cake mixes.....

I’ve been making Dump-cake since 1988, when it was introduced to me at a Family reunion. There were two kinds served, the Peach and the Cherry and they were both Delicious! When I bake the Peach dumpcake I add a drop of Vanilla extract after I dump the peaches in the bowl/pan and then I  add a sprinkle of Nutmeg and cinnamon on top after I cut the butter up, and I Use a whole stick of butter always!

We've made dump cakes for many, many years and love them!!  But haven't seen a review that adds the finishing touch..... Nuts!!  Add some chopped pecans on top before you bake.  If you really want to get elaborate, add a little cream of some sort on top when you're ready to eat.  Enjoy!

I have been making this for years, and actually made one for the first time in a long time last week. I used a can of peaches, which I cut into bite size pieces, and a can of crushed pineapples. I melted and poured a whole stick of butter on top. It was delicious! It helps to mix in the dry cake mix a little bit.

1 used 1 28 oz can of peaches in fruit juice, sprinkled some minute tapioca over, then white cake, press firmly.  Topped with cold butter pats , toasted chopped walnuts, cinnamon, and dark brown sugar...... I have made this many times with different variations.   The plate always comes home clean.  I top with vanilla bean ice cream or whipped cream.

Delicious as is!  One extra 15 oz. can of peaches, drained, was what it took to cover the bottom of my  9 x 13 pan.   Other reviewers' tip to freeze the butter and use a cheese grater was great, butter was distributed more evenly to create the golden cobbler crust.  Will be trying different fruits.  Everyone loved it.

I made this as a dessert for my daughter and, I this past Memorial Day and, we LOVED IT!!  I followed the recipe with a twist , it was quick and, very easy.  The only adjustments I made was adding a little Nutmeg on top  with the Cinnamon and Brown Sugar on top before I placed in the oven.  We ate it all in in two settings.  Adding French Vanilla Ice Cream on top gave it that extra punch I wanted.  Satisfied my sugar craving and, I'm good for a few weeks.  When I make again, I may add cake mix to the bottom and, mix the brown sugar in the peaches before placing in the pan.  I did use real butter and, I did cut it up, although I may melt and spread the next time.   I also, used three cans of peaches and, cut up I only used one can of the juice from the peaches and, once it set , it set perfectly. I did leave juice to the side just in case because this was my first time making and, wasn't sure if it would dry.   I think it would have been bland had I not added brown sugar.

Extremely easy to make. From the first bite I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I did add my own twist. Added brown sugar and a good amount of cinnamon. This put the cake in a league all by it’s self. Next time I will add more peaches but not the juice.

Really delicious. Used one 29 oz. can of peaches and added the 1/4c brown sugar on top with cinnamon. So good. I make a lot of dump cakes. Take the suggestion made to use your cheese grater to grate the stick of butter. Always have powdery patches until I grated. Will never do it any other way. Definitely will make again

Someone may have already mentioned this, but when I make this recipe, I cut the butter into the cake mix with a mashed potato tool. It ensures the butter is distributed evenly.

Soooooo good!! I’ve made this so many times. You can even change the fruit. I’ve used cherry pie filling and apples. It is very sweet so some may not like that. I also use a butter cake mix instead of yellow.

Family loved this!  Everyone requested seconds!!  Easy and quick to do, which is a bonus.  I used a large can &  a small can drained (the more fruit the better).  To the 9 x 13 pan filled with my peaches I added about 2 tsp vanilla, sprinkle with brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg (maybe about 1/2 tsp?).  Before I top with cake mix,I stir to make sure it's mixed.  Top with cake mix , sprinkle brown sugar,cut up butter and layer completely to cover.  Top with a smidge of nutmeg and press in.  Baked a little longer till golden brown.  The extras gave more of homemade taste (=  .  Could use with any fruit or a combination of fruit. This is a keeper!!!  Next time may try using one regular can and one light can, but either way soo delicious.

This recipe is one ingredient away from the recipe I have been making for 35 years.  All I called it was peach cobbler. We made it in a Dutch oven while camping. It’s a great recipe either way. Not sure how anyone would have a problem with the taste of this cobbler. I have never had yellow cake mix that tasted like anything other than yellow cake mix.  It’s easy and tastes delicious.

No changes. But did read some of the comments, and cut the butter thin and made sure a good portion of the cake was covered. I  took a spatula and patted the cake mix down and didn't mix it with the syrup, as some comments suggested.   Tasted great. I do think next time I will use peaches in a light syrup just to see how it compares.

Delicious , so I made it 2 days in a row as it didn’t last . I used 3 cans of peaches in heavy syrup and only drained 1 of the cans . I sprinkled brown sugar cinnamon and nutmeg over the peaches and then over the  butter on top. I baked mine for a hour and 10 min so the top would get crusty like cobbler .

******Updated******   I had a lot of surprise guests, so needed to double this recipe.  Only whole peaches which I cut, in the can, with clean kitchen shears into pieces.  Only one can, so tossed in a can of fruit cocktail.  The only surprise for was I NEVER buy butter with salt, and this time, had a 1/2 lb with salt.  I couldn't figure out what was wrong with the cake until I decided it was salted butter.  For those who had bad luck with this, quality ingredients matter.  If you buy a low quality cake mix this won't be as tasty.  Also, 10,000 thank yous to the person who suggested grating the frozen butter on top.  Best idea ever.          
 I was really pleasantly surprised by this simple recipe.  Besides being ridiculously easy, it was very tasty and didn't last long on any plates.  Other than adding more peaches, I followed the recipe.  Next time, and there will be many next times, I will add more cinnamon to the top, and maybe cut back some of the juice from the peaches.  I would like to be able to find canned in light syrup, but living in Guatemala, we only see those in heavy syrup, and so it was sweeter than I like.  I will also add the juice of a lime to the juice to cut some of the sweetness.  Thank you for an excellent time saver and very pleasing dessert.

I made it!! I kind of doubled the recipe. Two boxes of cake mix small layer on the bottom, the rest on the top. I went with two fresh peaches, can of cut up peaches, and one of pie filling pictures. I look at some of the reviews add brown sugar on top, and some cinnamon. I looked at some reviews and They said when they melted the butter it was still wet so I decided I thought maybe it would be a little dry and I needed the liquid so I would melt butter. I would say it’s not wet but maybe I can use a little more liquid. There’s nothing wrong with it. People did actually enjoy.

I liked the flavors but it was missing the sugar crunch. I will try adding brown sugar on top next time. This is an easy recipe to make!

I made it but, it wasn't the best.     This was my first dump cake and my last.    I normally make peach cobbler the old fashion way and I will stick to that.    My son liked it but I will not make this dump cake again.    

The cake mix was still on top even after I pushed it into the peaches.    It was rather dry.     This recipe to me is for those who really don't know what a really good cobbler taste like and this was not it.

I have to mention a review by mommaj that gave 1 star, and said it "tasted like baking soda and baking powder." I followed this recipe to the letter and it was great, mimicking peach cobble to a T! If what she wrote was how hers tasted, she did something wrong. And being such a simple recipe, I'm wondering where she went wrong. LOL

It was wonderful and received many compliments and one request for the recipe. FYI  all 3 major brands, Duncan Hines, Pillsbury and Betty Crocker cake mixes are now 15.5 oz which makes no difference. I too used peaches in light or very light which I found at Walmart.. I used 3 cans, I drained one. I realized after I added the peaches I had grabbed a can of apricots. So, any canned fruit would work. I think using light or very light syrup peaches and adding cinnamon, which I added on top of the peaches, will help on cutting the sweetness. Freezing the butter, as was suggested, worked great! Yummy and easy

OMG Good!!! Made exactly as the recipe stated except I sprinkled brown sugar on top as suggested by other reviewers. The only problem was that I only made one!!!
Thank you for the recipe. My daughter who stated she does not like peach anything ate the most.

I was not a huge fan (I wanted more texture...more like a traditional cobbler)... but my son ate at least 1/2  of the pan.  Super easy which is always a bonus for a busy family.

peach juice and added a mixture of 1/2 sugar and 1/2 Splenda. 
 I added 1/4 tsp of fresh grated nutmeg. 
  I WILL make this again !

This recipe worked well however I added finely chopped walnuts, about a cup.  You could do pecans as well.  This recipe could incorporate other fruits too!  Years ago my Mom made dump cake with a can of cherry pie filling and a can of chopped pineapple leaving juice in and sprinkled a package of cherry jello before finishing with cake mix, nuts and then butter. Delicious!

Very disappointing. I tried this twice. The first time I forgot to press it down firmly and the texture was dry and unappetizing. My mistake. The second time I followed the recipe and made it exactly as set out. Still disappointing. The cake mix didn't incorporate nicely into the dessert and the texture was still odd and floury.  Sorry, but I won't try this one again.

Delicious! I made it 100% according to the recipe and my family loved it! I will definitely make again.
BTW- I cut the butter into very small pieces to sprinkle over and chose to add the cinnamon.

Amazing!  My cousin used to make this but would never share the recipe because she said it was too ridiculously easy. So happy to find it. Best tip I’ve read was to grate the butter. It worked liked a charm and was evenly spread atop the cake mix. Genius suggestion by another poster. Thanks! Yummy

Only difference is, instead of slicing the butter and placing it here and there, I melted the butter and evenly distributed it over the cake mix, and baked it for around 10 minutes longer. Turned out beautifully and was a hit with my family. Wil definitely be making it again.

This is so easy and everyone loved it. Thanks to everyone for the tips. I used peaches in light syrup and wouldn't want it  any sweeter. I also used an extra can of peaches drained.  Also grated the butter on top, came out crispy and brown, no dry spots. Brought it to a potluck and it was a hit.

This was my first time making this recipe. I sliced the butter thinly so I could evenly place the butter across the top. I also sprinkled brown sugar on top of the butter before baking. I used peaches in light syrup and a Duncan Hines French Vanilla white cake mix. I set the timer for 45 mins but ended up baking for a total of 55 mins. It was amazing! Even my non-dessert eaters loved it. This will be a go-to recipe for me from now on. Yum!

Really good and super easy. I did tweak the recipes a bit. I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar over the peaches. I then added the cake mix and the butter then sprinkled cinnamon and brown sugar over the cake mix. Was wonderful! Hubby raved.

I made this recipe yesterday 5-25-18 exactly as written and it was really good.  I shared with neighbors who also remarked how good it was.  Crust tasted buttery and delicious.  There was no sogginess as some reported.  I will definitely make again.

I seasoned peaches with sugar,  brown sugar,  vanilla extract,  and cinnamon before i put on the cake mix.  I sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon on top of the cake mix and used a whole stick of butter sliced into little cubes.

Yummy & Easy!  According to other reviews I added about  a half cup of brown sugar &  a half cup of white sugar.  It was quite sweet, but had a nice caramel flavor on top because of it.  I also used European butter which gave it a real richness.

The was a quick easy way to get the taste of peach cobbler without the effort. I used 3 cans of peaches with the syrup of only 2.  I added the cinnamon, nutmeg and a splash of vanilla on top of peaches, melted the butter added a couple tbs extra and brown sugar poured that over the top of the cake mix and it came out great. I checked it at 45mins and I wanted it a bit darker so I let it go another 6 mins or so.

I made this once before and found that it was somewhat runny on the bottom and too well done on the top.  I modified it just a little by removing about  1/2 cup of the heavy syrup and used 1.5 boxes of yellow cake mix.  The first box I placed in the pan and stirred to absorb the liquid.  The half box was then sprinkled on top.  I shredded my stick of butter to spread more evenly because the first time I used butter pats and the cake wasn't cooked completely under those spots.  Regardless of how it looked, it was delicious.  This would go well with whipped cream, or even a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I made this recipe for my son's 1st birthday for a crowd of about 25 people. I tripled it and there were leftovers, even though people LOVED it. It took about 10 minutes to assemble and so I just needed to throw it in and then I could forget it for the next 45 mins while I finished prepping for the party. It was SO EASY! And very popular. The recipe says to flatten it. This is so the cake mix soaks up the peach syrup. Next time I would either mix the two together or flatten it and then fluff it up so the top isn't so flat and shell-like. I will definitely be making it again. It'll be my go-to for when I need a fast and easy dessert that people will love.

Quick, easy and delicious!  That's what the Peach Dump Cake is!  I substituted crushed pineapple for one of the cans of peaches and used fruit that was packed in juice.  It was not sweet at all, which was good for the diabetics in my family.  Everyone enjoyed this one and suggested that I make it again... >^..^

Not as good as my 1 cup peach cobbler but very tasty and good either way.  I used 2-24 oz jars of peaches in light syrup, draining both and only used 1 cup of the syrup.  I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the peaches,  and on top on the cake mix, which a also added Lt. brown sugar. I took the advise of many reviews here and shredded the butter all over evenly and baked for 55 mins. Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic, quick & easy peach cobbler.  Only made a few changes, used 3 (15 oz) cans of sliced peaches all in light syrup, 2 undrained & 1 drained, used nutmeg instead of cinnamon.  Rather than grating the butter, I put the cake mix & cold butter in my standup mixer & mixed till the butter was cut into small pieces. Also, took the advise of another reviewer & made it the night before. Took it our of fridge, till it was almost room temp. Baked it for 60 min.  Served it with light cool whip.  This is a keeper in my recipe file, as having the ingredients in the pantry when you crave for something sweet & easy to make.  Jessica THANK YOU so much for sharing your wonderful recipe.

Added a touch more real butter. Tasted great. It's nearly impossible to make this taste bad but, by the reviews, you can see nothing is impossible when it comes to cooking.

I made this according to the directions below. It made my house smell wonderful but the cake mix part was still in a powder after 45 minutes. Blech! I won't be making this again.

This is a really good recipe and couldn't be any easier.  The only changes I made (because my husband is diabetic) was to use sugar free cake mix and no  sugar added peaches in lite syrup.  I also sprinkled a little sugar on top (he can have a little sugar) along with the cinnamon.  Easy peasy and oh so yummy (and rich).

My whole family loved this dessert!  I loved the fact that it could be made with things I already had in the pantry. I served it with aerosol whipped cream because that's what I had, but it would be great with vanilla ice cream!

I love this recipe!  I use 4 cans of fruit, 2 drained and 2 with syrup and 2 sticks melted butter.  I make with canned peaches or canned apricots.

My mom made this when I was a kid; the things I would change are two cans of peaches and set aside half the juice to pour over the top before putting in the oven. Makes it far more consistent!

This was amazing!  I was so skeptical that this would be a flop that I made cupcakes as a backup for my husband for Valentine's Day. So he ended up with two awesome desserts instead of one and this one was definitely the better of the two. My only changes were that here in Australia, I couldn't find peaches I heavy syrup, so they were just in the normal juice. I layered a bit of cake mix and butter on bottom as suggested by another review. Also, I added a half a cup of brown sugar on top after cake mix and butter, again, as suggested by another review, then sprinkled with cinnamon. Unbelievably easy and oh so yummy! Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe was great!  After reading other reviews, I decided to add brown sugar, vanilla and nutmeg as suggested by others that actually made this recipe.  It was absolutely wonderful!!!  My granddaughters and I really enjoyed it.  This one is a can't miss!

This is a great recipe to prepare in a Dutch oven as well. Quick, easy, delicious and simple cleanup when you use a liner. A little taste of home out in the woods. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was extremely easy to make. I took others advice and grated the frozen butter for the top which was good for the even browning. But, work quickly because the shredded butter softens very fast in your fingers when putting it on.  The cake part was a little too sweet for my taste in the final result. I would only make this again if I can find a cake mix that is not so sweet. So I would give it 5 stars on easy of prep and final appearance and 3 stars on taste only because of the sweetness. Peach taste was great!

This was very good, especially warm with ice cream.  Mine got a touch too dark on top after baking for the minimum time.  I would prefer a more cake-like cobbler.  Next time I will try making the cake batter as directed on the box instead of using the dry mix.

Love, Love, Love this recipe.  I was first introduced to it when my Eagle Scout son brought home some leftover from a camp out.  He and his troop do at least two dutch oven cobblers for each camp out and they love them.  They use the pie filling for convenience sake on the trail.  I use fresh peaches if available or canned if not.  I have made this for our mission trips, special birthdays, and just at home for after dinner.  So easy and delicious.  I agree with the cold butter sliced and spread out over top of dry mix and draining the peaches a little bit so it's not too soggy.

I mixed allspice with the peaches instead of  topping with cinnamon. Yes, I will make the peach dump cake again it was delicious. Next time I will double the recipe, it went fast.  I am going to try different fruit different also.

4 stars for ease. I used 2 cans in light syrup. I melted the butter and mixed it with vanilla cake mix before putting it on the fruit. Next time, I would use 3 cans of fruit, draining one can. I did forget the cinnamon.

Very good cobbler.  I don't know how someone stated that it tasted like baking soda and baking powder when a cake mix is used.   That statement makes no sense to me.

Simple, easy and tasty, what more do you want.  I added a 1/4 teaspoon of Almond extract to the peaches.  Brings out the flavor of the peaches.

This dessert is really a easy recipe and it is delicious. I have made this dessert way too many times.  Just looking at this recipe there are a few things that really should be noted.
#1  You must use the peaches that are in heavy syrup (or the recipe won't come out right).
#2  You must use butter (not margarine) or the recipe won't come out right.
#3  Slice butter up into pats, lay the pats of butter covering the powdered cake mix. This along with the heavy syrup from the peaches helps cook the dry cake mix. 
#4  I let mines bake at least 1 hour, sometimes a little longer or until the juices from the peaches are bubbly and the top is a nice brownish color.

I have made this many times. It's a quick go to dessert recipe with easy ingredients that I often have on hand. I prefer to drain most of the syrup from the peaches, or it is too soggy for my preference.

Let me start off by saying the juices from the peaches do not mix in with the cake flour that's why the cake flour has butter on top of it therefore when you cook the cake the spots where you place the butter would would become a very delicious dumpling but besides that part between the butters is cake flour so I had to start in the juices from the bottom which made it look an edible then I cooked it and now I have no juice so it became like a bread pudding with peaches and it great flavor will make sure that I had some kind of liquid to the cake mix next time

I like to use peach pie filling too. It makes it a little fluffier. but with an egg for a little more fluff and a little less sweet. Definitely mix the peaches in with the batter. 
a little streussel on top never hurt ;)

I first tried this recipe camping with boy scouts. We made it in a Dutch Oven using coals as heat source.  I find it to be very good and so easy to make.  The kids loved it too.

This was exceptional!  I did use (2) 28oz cans of peaches, draining one can.  More peaches worked for us.  I sprinkled cinnamon and a little brown sugar on top of peaches, before adding the cake mix.   Also, I could only find 15.25oz cake mix, but it worked perfectly.  Getting the butter across the top was a bit difficult.  Will try to freeze the butter and use shredder next time.  I made this for a dinner party and the entire pan was empty in less than 10 minutes!

The only change I made in this recipe was to melt the 3 ounces (instead of 1/2 cup) of butter and mix with most of the juice from the peaches.  After smoothing the cake mix over the top I poured the liquid over as evenly as possible.  You could smell the butter as it was cooking and everything turned out juicy and the topping browned and cooked. (I also used peaches in a light syrup as heavy wasn't available.  Have made twice now and everyone raves about it.

Fantastic!  I made exactly as it states with no add-ins.  I did grate the butter as someone suggested and I think that is the way to go.  For the heck of it I also sliced all the peaches in half after dumping them in, it seemed to spread them out over the pan more evenly.  We all loved this!

Talk about YUM!! I'm guilty of changing things up a little bit... Used Apple pie filling; coated them w/cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. Kept the original 'format' - dry cake mix on top of apples; covered w/ pats of butter, and then sprinkled cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice on top.  Only needed a 11x7 (2.2 QT) pan. A BIG HIT with the family for out Father's Day dinner!

As far as dump cakes go this is five stars... HUGE TIP though: put the stick of butter in the freezer for a bit first then grate it and disperse evenly over the top of the cobbler as the final step before placing it in the oven. If you do this it will melt evenly and still become crispy on top (gooey underneath) and not soggy like the "melted butter" way.  No disrespect to the butter melters. We all like our dump cobblers a little different :)

We hit a BBQ place last week and tried their peach cobbler.  It was amazing!  Rich and and extremely buttery with sweet peach and a touch of savory cinnamon.  I remembered seeing this recipe on here and claimed I could recreate that fantastic desert.  I was right and this is the recipe!  It's easy and fantastic!  This will be my, "The recipe is a family secret" take along for get togethers for years to come.

This is the same recipe my grandmother made for us as kids...wonderful!  Her directions were slightly different - melt the butter and add the cinnamon and peaches. Pour into the pan and add cake mix on top - stir until the cake mix is moist. Personally I like it gooey on the bottom so I don't mix it very well.

I change it a little bit. I used one can of the peach juice, 2 eggs and mix it together. The rest I do.. Great and I NEVER have left overs. Thank you for the great basic recipe.

My daughter made this and I thought it was good.  I made just a couple of small changes. First I sprinkled some cinnamon right over the peaches before adding the cake mix. Next, instead of a yellow mix, I used a butter pecan mix - yum. I also thought spice cake would work well too. Anything this easy, quick and tasty is a keeper!

Considering how easy this is, it's actually not bad.  People seem to be torn on how to do the butter.  I cut very thin pats and covered the top.  I also sprinkled the peaches with cinnamon and brown sugar and then a little more cinnamon on the cake mix.  I drained one of the cans of peaches, used a 9x9 dish, and cooked for 45 minutes which might have been a little too long.  I would definitely make this again the same way, but probably cut the time down to 40 mins or so...

Very good!  I used a package of frozen peaches, and only half the cake mix and butter, put everything into an 8" square pan and baked for 45 minutes.  Will definitely make again.

This was too sweet for me and tasted like a plain yellow cake with peaches poured over the top. I was hoping for something a little more authentic.

This cake was delicious. I made it as a birthday cake for my nanny and she loved it. It was gone the next day. I am already getting requests to make it again. I cant wait to try this cake with other fruits.

EXCELLENT!  I have began making this just this past summer.  So quick and easy and so darn tasty.  As with any peach cobbler, I believe vanilla bean ice cream is a wonderful match.  If I could make one suggestion, be sure to keep the windows closed...the neighbors will definately smell it from miles away.  I know my husband can!

I liked it, hubby liked the crust, my 4 year old spit it out. I followed the advice of the other viewers and added brown sugar to the top. I checked the recipe several times because I couldn't beleive I didn't need to do something to the cake mix and checked it several times in the oven. I did not use the cinnamon my family really doesn't like it. It was good not the cobbler I grew up on I actually prefer more of a pie like crust.

Used fresh peaches and my cake was still a bit soggy.  Next time I'll use a smaller dish size.  I took the recommendation of other reviewers by mixing the butter into the flour with a pastry cutter. Probably wouldn't make again.  It is also VERY sweet, so you can cut the sugar.

This recipe was really good.  I used a white cake mix and I added some cinnamon and some pumpkin pie spice also (just a tad).  I used one can of peaches and drained most of the juice out, and I also used one can of peach pie filling. I sprinkled cinnamon and a dash of pumpkin pie spice. Then I put the white cake mix on top, and I took the advice of another person and shredded COLD butter on top and it was easy and worked out great.  I got good reviews from everyone who tried it and it was super easy!  I will definitely be making this again!

This was REALLY GOOD.  by accident, my husband brought home no sugar added peaches sweetened with splenda and half-the-sugar yellow cake mix (he swore it was an accident!) but we made it anyway and it was DELICIOUS.  i didn't put much butter on it because i was out, but i used what i had, sprinkled dark brown sugar over the top and topped it with a drizzle of honey before baking.  we both went back for seconds!!  i usually don't like reduced-sugar desserts, but i will definitely be making it again!

This cake is actually addicting!! The first time I made it my husband and I ate the whole thing in one night (I don't recommend this lol). Instead of ice cream we used extra creamy cool whip. YUM!! But it is good by itself too.

This was very good.  I used 1 can of peaches in light syrup and 1 small bag of frozen peaches.  I thought the topping was a little too sweet for my taste, but  we still enjoyed it.  I would definately try it again and maybe add only half the cake mix and some oatmeal or something to cut the sweetness

Good cobbler taste!  It didn't turn out as well as I expected, though.  I should have melted the butter and drizzled it on top of the mix.

Super easy to make! I made this a few times, and I decided to cut back on the butter the second time around (I used 2/3 of one stick of butter instead of the whole stick)and I just cut the pats  a little smaller. I think it was just as good, and no one noticed the difference! I also tried this with pineapples instead of the peaches...yummy! I'm going to try canned strawberries in light syrup next...the possibilities are endless!

This turned out amazingly wonderful.  It is more of a cobbler than a cake.  I have been baking for 40 years, and this is my first dump cake to make.  I don't know how I got away with not making this before.  I loved it, and recommend it.

The kids loved it.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars.  I think next time I will put a little brown sugar on top and a little cinnamon in with the peaches.  All around good and so easy.  I will make again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I sprinkled a little nutmeg and brown sugar over the peaches before adding the dry cake mix. I used 1 stick of frozen Land O Lake butter to grate over the top of the cake mixture. All I can say is YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY !!!!

My family loves dump cake and we were dying to try this one. I changed the peaches in heavy syrup to a no sugar one and melted the butter ahead of time to pour it over the cake mix. Those tips were very helpful, thank you. I've been asked to make this again and to send to a work related gathering. Awesome version!

I agree with another reviewer: I, too, spend a great deal of time baking fancy desserts from scratch, and this one, which was so incredibly simple and done in about 5 minutes, got just as many raves as my intricate and time-consuming recipes. I didn't have peach jello, so I used a watermelon fusion type, and it was still terrific. I also used two cans of peaches, one in light syrup and one in heavy syrup, and used the liquid from the light peaches. It was sweet but not overpoweringly so.  I'm definitely going to try some other dump cake recipes.

I made this using three large cans of peaches in light syrup, with the syrup mostly drained off.  Then topped the peaches with a 1/4 c of brown sugar and sprinkled the cinnamon on the peaches.  This made a large pan of cobbler, enough for a potluck!  By using items from the dollar store, I made the whole batch for under $5. Definitely a budget dessert for a batch of people!

I made this cake after finding myself with 10 lbs of fresh peaches and the end result was a super delicious creation that my husband and I polished off in 3 days (and I don’t usually even eat sweet stuff)!  I changed the original recipe a bit using fresh peaches in homemade heavy clove/cinnamon syrup and omitting the cinnamon on top (as the peach syrup was already quite spicy.)  I served it warm with some whipped up heavy cream with a touch of sugar.  Will definitely make again and again.

I used white cake mix and added 1tsp of vanilla and nutmeg. I only had canned peaches with lite syrup available so I used them.  It came out a little runny. But, after it sat for a while, it thickend up. I will probably use heavy syrup next time and drain a little bit.

I love baking and wanted to try something w/Peaches in it for my dad and boyfriend on Father's Day. Needless to say, the whole cake was gone in a matter of minutes and there was a request for more. There were some dry patches but somehow that didn't matter to them.
Thanks for the easy recipe!

MMMMM... so good and easy. I forgot the cinnamon but it was fine. I’m sure it would have tasted better with it though. I used a 29 ounce can of peaches and added three bananas. TRY THIS WITH BANANAS!! It is soo great mixed together and the bananas thicken it up a bit. I grated the butter on top of the cake mix. I bet a little less could have been used for health related reasons. Thanks so much! Making again very soon...

Instead of putting two cans of peaches in heavy syrup, I used one can of peaches in heavy syrup and two cans (11 oz.) of mandarin oranges in light syrup. It turned out so delicious!!! My boyfriend and I are fans of sweet desserts and this recipe definitely fit the bill.

This was okay. When three days later I still have half a pan left that's not a good sign.  Especially with a husband and three kids to eat it.  I liked it but I don't think anybody else did.

I loved it .. But it was a little sweet. Peaches are one of my favourite fruits so anything with them usually tastes great... it took me a lot longer than stated to cook it to a consistency at all like a cake or cobbler, for a long time it was just like raw cake mix. It was Good, but not the best ive had!

The only changes I made were adding an extra can of peaches, cinnamon, vanilla, and increasing the baking time by about 10 minutes.  I also made sure that all of the cake batter was moistened before baking.  It definatley turned out more along the style of a peach cobbler, which was great.  Fantastic recipe.

This was very yummy and easy! I used a can of peaches in heavy syrup and a can of peaches in light syrup. It wasn't too sweet or too bland. I added a LOT of cinnamon, probably about two tablespoons worth. I served it right out of the oven with vanilla ice cream on top. YUMMY! It tastes even better the next day after its warmed in the microwave for about a minute. Very easy to make!

The recipe was very tasty...it tastes great with ice cream...kinda like peach cobbler.  The only downfall was that I had to "press" the cake mix into the peach syrup  after it was supposedly almost done.  It was still a dry cake mix on the top but after it was well soaked, the dish was nice.  I think it would be better to add the butter before you add the cake mix.  I will try this recipe again though!

Thank you for this recipe! I made this about 20 years ago. It was on the back of a cake mix box. I didn't keep the recipe and I have been looking for it ever since then. Thanks again.

I made two pans of this and took it out camping with a large group.  It didn't turn out looking as good as I'd hoped, but it was eaten up nonetheless.  Even cold it was delicious, and I have a feeling it would be so much better warm and fresh out of the oven with ice cream!  
I read other reviews before making this and ended up mixing peaches in heavy and light syrup, and I was very happy with the results.  Not too sweet- it was just right!  I also melted the butter and poured it over the top - this seemed to work better than cutting it up would have.  
This is definitely a good, quick recipe to hold on to!

Made for Mother's Day and it was a big hit.  Added 4 cans of peaches in light syrup (2 with juice/2 without) because hubby loves them and it came out wonderful.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

I was in Girl Scouts as a kid, and we did a lot of Dutch Oven baking on our camp outs. Fruit cobbler was a staple dessert, and was made exactly the same way, using any pie filling or canned fruit, dry cake mix and butter. I had forgotten about it until I saw this recipe today. I made it this afternoon and it's already half gone! The only change I made was adding more peaches (about 3 cans total). Thanks for a delicious recipe!

This recipe was so easy and tasty too.  I divided the ingredients equally into a muffin tin for single, clean looking servings.

Terrific recipe.  Brown sugar on top worked out great.  Didn't drain anything, cooked it 5 minutes longer, though. Baking it made the whole living area like heaven.
