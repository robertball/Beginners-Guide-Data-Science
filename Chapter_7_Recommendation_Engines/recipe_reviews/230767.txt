Hi, I'm the writer of the recipe.  We like this spread with 2 medium-size cloves, but if you have concerns or if you're using large cloves, start with less, the cheese's flavors will intensify overnight.  You always can add more garlic if it suits you.  ***12.20.18 UPDATE*** Instead of crackers, spread some cheese down the middle of a piece of salami, and roll up into a cone.  Nice for an appetizer tray or snack board.

Update: The garlic in this recipe is overpowering by the next day... Should cut the amount by half or more...

This spread is really yummy on crackers! I enjoyed having a homemade version of such an expensive cheese.

I made this to use in the recipe for Baked Cod with Boursin Cheese, also on this site, subbing this recipe for the Boursin Cheese.  I made half of the recipe as written, which was plenty to coat the top of two fish filets.  In fact I had a little leftover which was great on crackers.  This is a snap to put together and one that Iâ€™ll definitely make again!  Thanks lutzflcat!

Had no vermouth, so used heavy whipping cream. Two cloves of garlic may be too strong. May cut back to one clove next time.  I ground the dry herbs with the salt before adding them to make the pieces smaller.
Tastes great, and a lot like the Boursin spreads I paid a fortune for at Christmas!
