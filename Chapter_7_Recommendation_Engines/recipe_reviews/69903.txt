Excellent recipe!!! My husband and I both loved it!!! I added some sun dried tomatos and didn't have sherry so I just used some red wine that I had instead.  My husband and I both love garlic, so I added extra. We're having it for dinner again tonight -second time this week!

I love this recipe.  It's easy and tasty.  The only change I make is to add a little milk at the end to create a sauce.  That way there is more to enjoy.

After reading the other reviews I used half and half instead of sour cream and had plenty of sauce.  I put the basil, pine nuts and 1/2 of the half and half in a food processor and it was wonderful.  Would be plenty to put on pasta, if desired.  Salt was needed.

Good recipe and fairly healthy.  I added cooked, chopped asparagus at the end and it worked very well with the sauce and chicken.

Outstanding and easy!  Even my pickiest eater (11 yrs old) loved it. Since I had a 10 oz jar of pesto sauce, I substituted that for the pine nuts & basil.  It worked out wonderfully.  We'll make this one over and over!

We loved this!  I had to change it a bit - only had some fresh pesto so I added that instead of the fresh basil and pine nuts.  I served it over pasta and it went down a treat!

This was a great tasting and easy to prepare dish!  I followed recipe exactly and it was very tasty.  Perhaps the only thing I might do differently next time is make more of the sauce since there wasn't really enough sauce to add a little pasta to the dish.  Thanks for the recipe Jodie4!

Quick, easy and good.  I subbed nonfat plain yogurt for the sour cream to reduce the fat content. Unfortunately, my aubstitution yielded a somewhat watery sauce, but the flavor was fine.

This is a wonderful and easy creamy pesto recipe. I ended up blending the garlic, basil, pine nuts and cream in a blender and then added the sauce to the already cooked chichen and let it simmer for a few minutes. I served it over white rice. Great recipe! Thank you.

My husband and I didn't particularly care for this at all.  I am a big fan of pesto usually, so I'm not sure what went wrong.

I made this recipe for a course I'm taking and it was a total hit.  It didn't take very long at all and was a hit even with the people who don't like reuglar pesto sauces.

Really didn't care for this. The "sourness" of the sour cream dominated the dish. Not sure if I'll attempt it again, but if I do, I would use cream cheese/chicken stock instead of sour cream as it looks like a yummy cheesy alfredo type sauce but tastes too sour.

This is one of our family's favorite dishes and it is SOOO easy! Super quick, no fuss and delicious. The only thing I do to change anything is add MORE basil (double)and double the sour cream so there's a lot of sauce to spoon over the chicken and any pasta. Thank you so much for this recipe! It's the best!

Pretty good, I took another users advice and only used 2 chicken breasts so there was more sauce, it came out perfect. The flavor was a little bland, it was missing something. But was still good, I would make this again.

I have tried this recipe two times, and have found it to be a let down. While it is very flavorful, there is absolutely no creaminess to it. I will not make this again.

This was delicious, very flavorful.  I served it with Jasmine rice and a salad!!  Will make again.  I didn't care for the pine nuts though, I think I will try a different nut next time.

This was great!  I only used two chicken breasts but kept everything else the same- this way there was enough sauce.  I think that with 4, there wouldn't have been enough.  I liked how it used light sour cream.  Served with Delicious and Easy Mock Risotto, and it went really well.

Based on other reviews, I halved the amount of chicken.  I served over pasta and fed 3 people, but there was not nearly enough sauce.  If you're feeding a family of 4, I would double this recipe, but not the amount of chicken.

This is a quick and easy recipe, I typically would've sautéed the garlic first, and maybe would've browned the pine nuts as well first but the flavor was good as written.  I was a little challenged with the overall consistency of the sauce.  I see some people talk about thinning it, but I really had the opposite problem.  The moisture from the chicken and sherry was to much to burn off without overcooking the chicken.  Next time I will spoon off most of the liquid before adding the sour cream.  I had to thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch.  Thank you so much for the  recipe!
