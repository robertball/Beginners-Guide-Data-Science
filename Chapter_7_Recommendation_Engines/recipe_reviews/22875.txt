I have to give this recipe only 2 stars..Although the flavor and the crumb topping were quite flavorful, the overall pie was very watery. I don't know why I didn't follow my instinct to add flour to the apple mixture. If you are making this pie, be sure to add flour to the mixture unless you want a watery mess!

This is tasty, but it is so similar to apple crisp I might just forgo the crust next time and have that instead.  The recipe is really enough to fill 2 pie shells.  I would definitely cover the entire top of the pie with tin foil for at least some of the baking time, so the bottom crust can bake through and not burn the top.

Very easy, tasted great!  I used Granny Smith apples, and added 1/4 C. brown sugar and 1 T. flour to the apple mixture.  I liked this topping better than the traditional 2-crust pie.  I don't think there will be any leftover by the end of the evening.

very tasty recipe, but you need to add flour to apple mixture or it is to juicy and you have a soggy crust. i used 2 tbsp. also 8 apples is to variable i used 8 first time and it was way to much apple took to long to cook top had to be covered to stop burning second time i used 6 cups chopped apple

This was very good. I used firm granny smith apples and they were cooked perfectly at 45 minutes. I also cut the allspice to only half a teaspoon, but I thought it still overpowered the other flavors. If I made this again, I would just leave it out altogether. I also drizzled melted caramels over the top after it was done and this helped keep the top from crumbling so much.  It was very good and went fast!

This was the greatest apple pie my family and I ever had.  I doubled the amount of the crunch on each pie and even baked just the crunch mix to use on plain vanilla ice cream.  It was amazing!!!  I love that crunch!!! I even used it in my yogurt and cereal.  Thank you!!

Im not a huge apple pie fan but this is better than a tradional double crust pie! I used cortland apples... I also took a suggestion from someone else and melted about 20 caramels with about 2 tablespoons of half and half and drizzled it over top.  Served with vanilla bean ice cream.  Yum yum yum!

My sister Alexandra made this recipe too and told me about it. This was good. I had people who do not like apple pie eating this. The one thing I did take off was the pecans. They gave it an odd flavor. I did not have Macintosh apples available so I used 10 little Granny Smith's apples, which I let marinade overnight in the apple mix. This was enough for 2 regular pies. Next time I will try this in a deep dish pie crust instead. Overall, Dee-lish !!

This was very yummy as apple pie recipes go. I had to use sliced almonds instead of the pecans because that is what I had on hand, but it turned out great.  I couldn't stop eating the topping before I put it on the pie.  It's a wonder that the topping made it on the pie at all!

YUM!!  This was a great apple pie recipe that was easy to modify to gluten free by just using a GF crust and GF oats.  So delish with vanilla ice cream! Thanks for sharing.

My husband loved this pie (he'd love any pie really) and the crunchy crust is a really great way to do a one crust pie but i prefer syrupy pies and found the filling in this one to be dry. Depends on your preference...

We really liked this (I'm eating my second piece now!)  The topping is really simple but surprisingly delicious.  I used 8 macs and added 1T of flour as others suggested. The pie wasn't completely cool so it was still somewhat drippy. Once the pie had been refrigerated it solidified nicely. We'll definitely make this again.

I used Macintosh apples but I did add a little flour after reading reviews.  The pie came out perfect.  It was delicious!!  I also used chopped walnuts because I didn't have pecans.

Delicious! I used 6 jonagold apples, omitted the allspice and used walnuts instead of pecans. the pie needed to be baked much longer since my apples created a lot of juice. maybe a higher temp would help. when i cut into it, the pie didn't hold together so it was more like a cobbler, but the flavor was so delicious no one minded!

I was afraid there might have been too much butter in the topping, but it was perfect. I made two of these for pi day, one for the office and one for at home, and it was a huge hit in both places.

This was pretty good. The apples were still crunchy which I don't prefer but all in all, this is a solid apple pie recipe. Next time I will omit the walnuts as they tasted like kind of an afterthought. On second thought, I may add them in with the apples...that might work.

This was a good pie recipe. I left out the nutmeg and allspice just a personal preference. I would make this again for something different from the normal apple pie.

Overall pretty good.  The crisp topping is a nice change from the standard top crust.  Very easy to prepare with good results.  Double the cinnamon if you like a little extra spiciness with your sweet.

Following recipe exactly, felt it could use a little more cinnamon and it turned out very watery, definitely needed a little bit of flour in the apple mixture

The flavors of the pie were good, but even after letting the pie cool for a few hours, it never set and we couldn't even cut it into slices; it was a watery mess.  I should have followed my instinct and added a bit of flour to the apple mixture.  I used 6 Macintosh apples and that was still too many for the deep dish pie crust.  If you try this pie, perhaps mix your pecans in with the crumb topping so they don't burn during baking.

I use Empire apples since they lean slightly more tart than sweet.  They made a great pie.  And, without a second crust or lattice, this pie is "healthier" than others and makes a very good and different pie.  Everyone loves it.  Also, try it with the "Healthier Pie Crust" which has coconut - you'll be pleasanty surprised (but lessen the sugar somewhere).

Good but not as good as my normal crunch pie. Maybe I should have used more tart apples. I did a combo ofJonamacs and Granny Smith. I'm thinking that I like the more dense and tart Granny Smiths:) Anyway it's good enough and worth a try for someone like me that hates doing top crusts.

This is great!  I modified it by doubling all of the spices, to make the flavors stronger.

I was able to only get one piece of this pie.  It really is good and it goes very fast!
