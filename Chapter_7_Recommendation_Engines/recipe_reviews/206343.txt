This recipe changed my angle on home made burgers
I'd cut the total citrus amounts in half to keep that bold beef flavor.  My wife is a citrus skeptic and was impressed. Try using different cheeses. Blue cheese and goat were surprisingly good fits

My boyfriend and I LOVED this recipe. We changed it a bit, though, and made it more like sloppy joe's and used swiss cheese instead of pepperjack. Definitely a winner.

I saw this recipe and I had to try it.  The burgers were tangy and had a refreshing end of summer flavor, but something was missing.  I think the next time I make then I'll reduce the fruit zest I use by 1/2 and perhaps add some jalapenos or cayenne pepper to give it a little zip.  Some tiny bits of the orange may make them a little more juicy and sweet.  Certainly a good start, but it needs some tweaking still.

I'll tell you what, this lil kid has the knack.  I was interested because how quick and simple it was, and dog gone it it was not a let down.  Kids like simple and not so spicy foodso maybe it is not for the seasoned chef but great twist on the all-american burger.

When I first saw this recipe I was intrigued w/ the ingredients.  I thought surely NO WAY would this even taste good, and WOW was I wrong.  While there are many BBQ sauces, I chose Sweet Baby Ray's hickory brown sugar.  I stayed on course w/ this burger and it's a fantastic burger!  Way to go to the little miss who created it!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and the burgers fell apart on my grill. Some sort of binder (like an egg) is needed to hold them together. Great flavor though and unusual for a burger.

This is awesome!! Bison makes a super yummy (and healthier) alternitive to beef. This is a great recipe as it is easy to adjust according to one's taste. Will make again for sure!
