This does make for a good chicken soup. However, this recipie has nothing to do with the Hot and Sour soup, not even remotely.

I followed this recipe to the T, but something went wrong. I'm guessing it was the rice vinegar. As soon as I added it, the soup took on a horrible odor that permeated the house. My family wouldn't even try the soup. It tasted fine, if you could get past the smell.

Not really like soup I've had in Chinese places. I only gave it 3 stars because I added so much extra stuff to bring it along. I added cooking sherry, soy sauce, bean sprouts and 1t chili paste.

This is a delicous hot and sour soup!  It goes together fast and tastes authentic.  It is a wonderful mix between veg soup and chili...AND it's low carb!  I served it with Moo Shu Chicken Wraps and fortune cookies for an impromptu dinner party!

This is a great simple oriental soup recipe.  It is not like the Hot and Sour soup served in Chinese restaurants, but it is an excellent soup with a great oriental flavor.  I left out the red bell pepper and added some water chestnuts and diced firm tofu; It came out great.

I added snow peas and rice because I like a hearty soup. I served this along side our main dish and have no complaints. Thank you!

I found it to be a nice soup, not quite like the ones in the restaurants. It is Low carb ( which is what i was looking for). I found that there was a bit too much rice vinegar for my taste- i will put in 25 mls instead. It is a good base to start with- i will be making it again.

Very good version of hot and sour soup.  My husband liked this recipe for both the flavor and ease of making.

Even though I did add bean sprouts and tofu, the original recipe really has a good flavor.  The vinegar gives it just the right amount of zip.  This soup will be a staple in my house!

This recipe is a keeper! It's the first time I try making a Hot and Sour soup. It tastes just like the one I normally have at a Mongolian restaurant, except no tofu and a tad spicier. It's exactly what I'd expect of a hot and sour soup, so I have to disagree with the previous review.

Does not have flavorful taste of restaurant soup; I question the recipe - 8 cups of broth - 6 green onions - are out of proportion to other ingredients.

I was disappointed in this soup. I followed the recipe exactly and it was quite bland. I added red pepper flakes, pepper and salt and it improved some. I am going to keep looking for a good hot and sour soup recipe.

I thought this was great. Made some changes: usd vegetable broth instead of chicken, used black pepper instead of peppercorns. We loved it. It was perfect for a cold night!!
