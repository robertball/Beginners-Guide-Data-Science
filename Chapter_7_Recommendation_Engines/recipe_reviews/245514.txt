So nice to discover that there's a recipe to the way I've been making chili for years.  You can make this as spicy as you want by what Rotel you add like mild, hot, etc.  Also adjust the seasoning to your taste.  My husband doesn't like chili too spicy so I use the mild Rotel,  1/2 the French's Chili seasoning pack and one can of Bush's mild chili beans.  This all blends nicely together for a mildly spiced chili.  It's really a wonderful, easy and quick way to fix chili....good basic recipe!

This is a great recipe for that classic chili I crave on freezing cold, drizzly Seattle nights. It's been hard to find a recipe my kids like, but they gobbled up bowls this. I added chopped onions and sour cream to make extra yummy - and gave them tortilla chips for dipping.

After cooking the ground beef and onions, I added all the ingredients to a crock pot and cooked the chili on high for 3 hours.  My husband LOVED it especially since I made a mistake and added diced tomatoes with green chilis rather than plain diced tomatoes.  He likes his chili hot!

30 minute Chili from Rotel Haiku: "Had to add alot, to make this more flavorful. Still, basic & good." Well, it was an easy chili to throw together, but the only flavor came from the seasoning packet, the goop from the can of chili beans, and the Rotel, so I had to doll up my bowl a little more when I served it; maybe if it simmered for longer than 10 min. the flavors would've had more of an opportunity to develop, but I think it really needs alot more doctoring up in the ingredient department to be more than just another basic chili. Froze the leftovers and plan on using them either over baked potatoes or in a Frito pie.
