Hubby is a cheese addict.  I thought I would surprise him with a treat....and boy did he think this was a treat.  I used sharp cheddar instead of processed (his favorite cheese).  Will definately be making this one again.  Thanks.

Instead of using processed cheese, I used 1 cup shredded sharp chedder cheese.  Very good, with almost any bagel or sour dough bread cut into cubes and "toasted" in the oven.  The chedder cheese made it easier to "blend" in and the thought of not melting processed cheese turns me off.

I made this for a potluck lunch and it went FAST! It was easy to make and tasted good. I served it with bagel chips and I added extra green onions. Everyone at my table commmented me on it. Thanks for a good, easy recipie!

I make a variation of this for work food days...8oz cream cheese, 1 jar Kraft Old English cheese (usually near the velveeta in the stores) and 1 tsp garlic powder, or to taste.  It is always one of the first things to disappear, and people ask for the recipe everytime!

This is great!!  I use regular cream cheese and add garlic powder to it.  I usually have to double or triple this recipe because it goes so quick.

Totally impressive. This was so good on crackers, bread sticks, and even with veggies. But it was outstanding as a bread dip. I used Kraft Old English sharp cheese spread in the little glass jar and plain cream cheese and then tossed in a palmful of freeze dried chives. About 2 T worth. Thanks what a fabulous dip!

I took this dip so a Christmas Party and it was a huge hit! I ran out and had to make more.  I followed the suggestion of using the shredded sharp cheddar instead of the processed stuff.  I will definately make this again.

Alright, so I gave this a two, BUT it can easily be made into a five star recipe. The problem is the dip is lacking seasoning. I agree with the reviewer who said it has a very cheez whiz flavor to it. It's a good base, but you need to add more into it than just these two ingredients, otherwise the processed cheese flavor takes over. I used a hand mixer to blend the ingredients, and then I added a lot of onion powder and garlic powder (do it to taste.) I then added a large handful of the Mexican blend cheese. Would have preferred a sharp cheddar, but didn't have any on hand. Another reviewer mentioned the dip being too stiff...if that happens (which was not the case with mine) just add a little bit of milk to it. Not a big deal. With these adjustments, I give it a five star rating. I served my dip on beer bread, and it was delicious.

It was one of those items that NO ONE did NOT like.  Every ounce of it was gone by the end of the evening! And how easy can you get.

Proof that a good appetizer dip doesn't have to be complicated to be delicious!  I used the chives cream cheese as specified and Cheez Whiz.  It lasted about 5 minutes.  Thanks!

So easy to make!  And pretty tasty, too - although I'd definitely use cream cheese with chives next time like the recipe specifies (I forgot and got plain).

Kid approved!  Used the reduced fat cream cheese and added chives.  I only used half of the processed cheese as was called or in the recipe.

Used whipped cream cheese, added garlic powder, and dried chives. Not bad. But very easy. Enjoy!

I was disappointed with this dip.  I was looking for a cheese dip to use with soft pretzels, but this stayed thick like cream cheese consistency.  I was expecting a creamier dip.  I melted sharp cheddar with the cream cheese, but it was too stiff for dipping the pretzels.  The flavor was ok- maybe it'll be better with onion bagels or something.

I used plain cream cheese and stirred in some fresh green onions instead.  I also added a 6 ounce can of crab meat and some Old Bay and pepper -- very yummy to use as a bagel spread for breakfast or lunch.
