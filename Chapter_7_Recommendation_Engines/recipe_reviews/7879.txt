I made this in a 9x13 pan and I was a bit nervous that the batter was spread too thin.  But I lessened the baking time to 20 minutes and it came out perfect.  This was delicious.

What a delightful screw up this was! I followed the recipe pretty closely but added 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup of pineapple juice. I also didn't cube the pineapple, I used the rings out of a can. I originally made just one batch but silly me didn't read the pan size and put it all together in a 9x12. So I made another batch to fill the pan up and baked a bit longer, more like an hour. I was completely ready for a disaster but to my surprise it was fantastic. Not dry, not too moist but just perfect. So double your recipe and stick it in a 9/12 to enjoy even more. Also give your mixing a lot of love. The batter is wonderful too. Lick your spoon!

If the cake turned out a disaster, perhaps you made a mistake. Cooking is chemistry and you have to follow directions to a tee. Really cream that butter and sugar, and beat well between additions. The batter fluffs up like a meringe, so don't expect cake-mix consistency. 

I did do some modifications. (I found the cake a bit DRY) Here's what I recommend:

(1) Yes, REDUCE the topping butter to 1/4 cup. Cube it, put it in the pan, and put the pan in the oven while it's preheating. Save the step. Sprinkle with brown sugar and combine with fork. 

(2)Really pile on that pineapple: be generous in the size of your cubes because they'll shrink!! Don't dry the pineapple, let those juices soak into the batter.

(3) Cut the flour 1/4 cup, and reduce baking time by 5-7 minutes. 

This is a great recipe! So glad I found it. It will become a perineal favorite in this home. Thanks!

This was my first time ever making pineapple upside-down cake, and thanks to this recipe, it turned out great!  I cut back on the butter for the topping by half, and I went ahead and melted it in the hot oven right in the pan, and then I went ahead and mixed the brown sugar into the melted butter.  I used canned pineapple rings and put marachino cherries in the middles of the pineapple rings.  Then I sprinkled a little bit of chopped pecans over that.  I cut back on the salt just a tiny bit because I didn't have unsalted butter and didn't want it to come out too salty.  Instead of milk, I used 3/4 cup of the reserved pineapple juice, which gave the cake wonderful flavor.  I beat the batter real well between each step and the batter came out real nice.  Oh, also I used cake four instead of all-purpose.  Lastly, I only had an 8" round pan and I had a little extra batter, so I went ahead and prepared three custard cups just like the pan, and poured the rest of the batter in those.  The cake was done in about 43 minutes, and the custard cups were done in about 32 minutes.  I'm glad I put the custard cups in the other cake pan I had, because the the sugary, buttery topping came up out of the sides a little bit.  This is so good!  I can't wait to eat more of it!  :o)

The only thing I can think of is that maybe people are using too much pineapple??  I used pineapple rings -- just enough to cover the top of the cake.  And this thing turned out PERFECT.  I honestly wouldn't change a thing about it.  Even the topping was perfect.  I liked that it was extra buttery and yummy. Have no fear, this is a GREAT recipe.

I gave this a five star rating, assuming the amount of butter was incorrect. I used 1/2 cup butter total. I little more than 1/4 cup for the cake and the remainder for the topping. I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 pineapple juice for the 3/4 cup milk. This cake was okay the day I made it, but it was awesome the next day. So, if you need a make ahead dessert with ingredients you have on hand, this might be the ticket!

One night, I thought to myself, "Self, I would like some cake....cake with pineapple..." So, I logged onto allrecipes, and found...this great recipe! I used half of a 1lb, 4oz  can of pinapple chunks, drained and crushed. Also, going off of what someone else reveiwed, I only used about 3/4 of a stick of butter, rather than the whole stick. I still think the 'topping' was to soggy though, and next time I would reduce the butter even more, maybe 2/3 of a stick. Hope this helps.

I made this last year for my father (who lives in another state) who really enjoys pineapple upside down cake. Based upon previous versions I have tasted, I was not particularly fond of this cake. However, when I made this for my father, it was so moist and very flavorable that now I would eat this cake. My father enjoyed the cake so much, that he has requested that I make him one to bring to him when I come to visit I am going to make.  Because I am such a stickler for using fresh products, I make this using fresh pineapple, preferable golden pineapple.

This sounds like a similar recipe I saw on Good Morning America years ago. I've been making it for years and it's terrific! I use canned pineapple rings, dried very well, and make sure the butter mixture is a good consistency (I don't melt it all the way) before spreading it in the pan--that way it bakes into an almost crunchy topping for the cake. When serving, I place a few pansies in the middle and serve it warm with vanilla ice cream. It's a gorgeous, delicious dessert!

I followed this recipe with only 2 ingredient changes - 1/4 cup less flour, because I rather have a moist cake than dry and I only used 1/2 cup butter, total. I followed the advice of another reviewer and only partially melted the butter. I used the fresh pineapple chunks, just like the recipe called for. It baked in a 10" non-stick springform pan lined in parchment on the disc bottom and the sides sprayed with Pam. It came out PERFECT! It was my son-in-laws birthday cake and we served it warm with whipped cream. It FLEW!!!At last - something to do with my fresh pineapples!!!

This cake turned out to be a soggy mess. The proportion for the butter and brown sugar was definately way off. I read the reviews on this recipe before trying it. So I merely greased the pan with butter and sprinkled the brown sugar over it, but ultimately the end product was a messy and soggy cake. I am still curious how others find this cake good?

Great recipe ... first time I've ever made this and was in bind for a bake sale and it turned out great!!!  Person who bought it loved it and it was so easy I couldn't believe it!  I was in a hurry so I used canned pineapple rings instead of fresh and I baked it in a 9x13 pan for 20 minutes like someone else suggested.

this is a delicious recipe.however it was a tad too sweet for me (though everyone who tried the cake absolutely LOVED it!) as suggested by the many who have tried this recipe, one should really reduce the amount of brown sugar to 1/4 cup and the white sugar to 1 cup.

I made this cake for my father for his birthday at his request.  Both he and my mother thought it was the best Pineapple Upside Down Cake they ever had!   I followed the recipe as written with the exception of using canned pineapple and using a 50/50 mixture of milk and pineapple juice.

Absolutely delicious!  I'm making it again tonight.  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe.

Wonderful!!! is all I can say. This was my very first from scratch cake. It turned out beautifully. I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 cake pan and cooked it for 55 minutes. My family and guest couldn't get enough of it.

I made this cake exactly like the recipe, and did not like it.  Way too dense, not enough flavor in the cake, although everybody else seemed to like it.  I think I would have preferred one of the recipes that call for cake mix in the box.

Having never made a pineapple upside down cake before, I was a little nervous about this. It didn't say to use a two inch tall cake pan, so when the butter and pineapple juices started oozing out, causing smoke to pour out of my oven, I got pretty worried. But the guys at my boyfriend's frat house loved it, and I didn't think it was bad, myself. :) I'll definitely be using this in the future, but I think it will be ok without so many pineapple . . . that way my smoke alarm will stay quiet. :)

This was a horrible recipe.  I followed the recipe to the letter and all I got was a soggy mess. The melted butter to brown sugar ratio was WAY off.  I would not recommend this to ANYONE.

Baked as directed and the resulting cake was a little dry and more crumbly than expected. Not as much pineapple taste as I would prefer. Next time, I will try it with some pineapple juice instead of all milk.

I made this exactly as the recipe said and it came out DELICIOUS! Only thing I did different was cube up the butter and let it melt into the pan while the oven pre-heated. Saved a step. I also used a rectangle Pyrex baking dish (13x9) and it came out wonderful. Honestly...DO NOT BE AFRAID TO USE AS MUCH BUTTER AS IT CALLS FOR!!!

i cut the recipe in half bc i was just using a small loaf pan to do a test run and it was soooo good. i'm no baker by any means so i was pleasantly surprised. it was the best i've ever tasted, very very moist & delicious. I have to say though, there are like 7 one star reviews out of about 80, so that leads me to believe they are just not doing it right :)

Different from the other pineapple upside down cakes I've had before, but I can't point out what it is. Mine didn't turn out very pretty, but it was delicious. The brown sugar syrup surfaced to the top while baking, but didn't overflow. It glazed over the cake, giving it a nice caramel flavor. The texture was a little funny, but I'll make this again and update this review.

I too found the topping soggy but it did not detract from the wonderful taste.  I have never made a pineapple cake with it made in chunks but it was good.

This is a really good recipe. My husband thought it was too sweet but he says that about pretty much everything. had to use coconut extract instead of vanilla, its all i had - but it worked.  Next time, i'll add shredded coconut to the batter to give it a bit more flavor.

Doubled recipe for 9x12 pan but only used 1/2 cup butter (melted - in the pan in the warming oven) It may have been okay with only 1/3c. Took this to work for a persons birthday who wanted pineapple upside down cake and EVERYONE loved it. Also used whole wheat flour and no one could even tell.

This turned out nicely although it really didn't fit well in the small cake pan and could have used a larger pan. Nice cake, moist and not heavy. Texture was perfect density, not too light and fluffy not too heavy. I used margarine, canned pineapple and pineapple juice reserved from the canned pineapple instead of the milk. Very good! Almost as good as my Grandma used to make in her cast iron skillet.

This cake was awesome.  I reduced the butter and brown sugar as was suggested by other reviewers.  Also I used half milk and half pineapple juice for added flavor.  I made one day prior to serving and it was a big hit.

This cake came out great.  It sounded a little complicated, but was really easy.  I didn't even have the right sized pan, but it was still good.  I used a can of crushed pineapple that I drained really well, and used the pineapple juice instead of milk.  Plus, I sprinkled some chopped walnuts on top of the butter-brownsugar mixture on the bottom of the pan.  It was great!

I am new to cooking, so the recipe seemed a little time consuming, however my boyfriend who likes pineapple upside down cake apsolutely raved about it.  The cinnamon added an specially nice touch.  It was moist, and sweet.  A definate keeper. The best I've ever had.

I tweaked the recipe a bit and it was wonderful.  I used 1/2 of a l lb.4 oz. can of pineapple chunks (instead of fresh pineapple) and used the pineapple juice from the can as a substitute for milk.  I also  included 3 marachino cherries (halved) and  2 T of pecan pieces sprinkled in with the pineapple pieces in the bottom layer.
This was even better than the pineapple upside down can my mother used to bake.  Ymmm!

I have been baking since I was in 6th grade. This cake was great as written.  If I was a beginer baker I would be afraid to try any recipe with the things written on this site! With this and other recipe's!!  Leave the recipe's alone!  If they turned out bad maybe YOU made a mistake.  You tweak and add a pinch of this, take something away from and then are not happy.  This cake as written was moist and had just the right amount of juices and yum... Maggiemae

I made this with my 4 year old son, we love to bake together.  We cut a piece of waxed paper to fit the bottom of a spring form pan, laid down pineapple slices and cherries first, then the brown sugar and butter mixture over those.  We mixed and baked the rest of the cake exactly as the recipe instructed, and it turned out perfectly.

I tweaked the recipe a little bit because I cross-referenced with some other recipes online. I separated the eggs; yolks to the creamed butter and whites with cream of tartar whipped until they formed peaks. My finished product turned out great except that the top layer was kinda soggy and wet. I might be adjusting the amount of butter in the caramel mixture next time. =)

The first time I made this cake it taste ok. I followed the reciped to the letter and it was a bit dense and little on the dry side but my family ate it anyway. I made this cake again tonight but changed up the ingredients. (1) I doubled the recipe for a 10 X 3 inch pan (2) substituted 1 cup flour for 1 cup cake flour (3) used 1/4 cup pineapple juice in my batter for added flavor (4) alloted more time 1 hr. 40 mins for baking due to doubling the recipe. IT IS EXCELLENT NOW!!! MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH!!!

I consider myself an excellent cook, but not a baker. This recipe is great and makes a very tasty cake. I did not dry the fresh pineapple, but other than that, pretty much followed the recipe - it takes a lot of beating, but it's worth it...

This was my first time making pineapple upside-down cake.  It turned out well, and my guests really like it.  I used a 9x13 inch pan.  I wish the cake was little fluffier--it was not yellow like in this picture, but overall a yummy dessert!

Following the directions carefully I found this cake to be wonderful.  For the soggy messes, I would suggest that if you use different ingredients (ex: canned pineapple instead of fresh) you will get a different result if you don't modify other ingredients also.  Canned pineapple is much more wet than fresh and often times much sweeter, depending on how it is canned.

I made this so good that I almost cried!  I used a flute pan to bake. I used crushed pineapple from a can.  I had to strain the juice before placing in the pan. I didn't have any cherries but I threw in a few pecans. All the ingredients were left the same.  I only added 1 tablespoon of the leftover pinapple juice in the cake batter and baked for 40 minutes. (my oven cookes fast) Simply marvelous!

Make it into cupcakes for a party because I didn't want to have to worry about cutting and serving.  Thank goodness I sampled one before heading out the door.  The cake was flavorless and had a blah, pasty texture.    The top was goo.  I normally get raves from friends on my baking skills.  There was NO way I was going to serve this!  I was under time pressure and ended up running to the store and got some Jiffy yellow cake mix....and I NEVER used boxed mix!  It wasn't fabulous, but much better than this recipe turned out.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!  This was the best pineapple upside down cake I made!  The cake was super moist and taste wonderful by itself.  Instead of using maraschino cherries I used cherry pie filling.    I did double the recipe to make it in a 9x13 pan.  I also used less milk about 1/2 cup and then substituted the remainder with 1 cup pineapple juice.  My family loved this cake.  The cake wasn't gone and my son was already asking me when I was going to make it again.  Again, thank you.

This was so good warm from the oven. It would be really great with fresh pineapple, however all I had on hand was pineapple rings which I did not pat dry, and I stirred the butter and brown sugar in the cake pan as suggested by other reviewers.

baked a pineapple upside down cake before but this one is definitely the best so far...my family loved it...I will be using this one for sure from now on, I made a little change, I added 1/4 cup of reserved pineapple juice and a cup of milk instead of the 1 1/4 milk it called for and didn't bother cutting the cherries in half...the cake didn't last the night, it disappeared that quick...

Delicious! Doubled the recipe and baked in a glass 9x13, for about one hour. Used canned pineapple rings as well, only needed one can. The topping around the pineapple was great and definately what was missing out of the last recipe for this I tried. Thanks a bunch for the recipe, exactly what I was looking for!

If I do this again I would omit at least 1/2 the butter for the topping if not all together. Wasn't thrilled with the cinnamon in the cake itself.  Next time I'll just do a box mix.

There was way too much butter in the topping and my cake came out greasy. Next time I make this cake I will definately cut the amount of butter in half.

I had no pineapple, but wanted to use up some frozen rasberries, so I substituted! The cake turned out so well, just a little funny looking. It was delicious! It was not as sweet as it would have been with pineapple, but the raspberries were nicely tart. I will try this recipe again with pineapple, as I found the cake to have great flavour and texture. The hint of cinnamon was good, even though I don't usually like cinnamon in my baked goods. Great recipe!

Absolutely delicious! Turned out perfect, nice and gooey and perfectly sweet. Other people mentioned problems with butter and terrible turnout, but I followed the recipe exactly, only adding the cherries, and it turned out wonderful. Don't know what everyone else is talking about! Highly recommended!

This is great! I reduced the topping as others had said, and used round segments of pineapple out of a tin.  This was gooey, moist .. and gone within 5 minutes! One for keeps!

This was a great recipe!  I used muffin tins greased with butter to make individual cakes.  (This helps so you don't eat the whole thing at once).  They were extremely tasty.  Very buttery and moist.  I did decrease the flour by 1/4 cup.  I wanted to be sure they were not dry like some other cake recipes I've tried.  The next day I reheated for a few seconds in the microwave and washed down with a cold glass o' milk.  YUM!

I made this recipe exactly as posted.  I used a 9 inch round baking pan.  Overall, a good recipe.  The only thing that was missing was a moister cake.  I didn't have any pineapple juice to add to the batter in place of some of the milk but I will make sure I have some on hand next time.  The family really liked it and I will be making it again very soon.

A really nice recipe. Definitely a keeper!!! I pretty much follwed the directions. Reading the previous suggestions, I thought I'll reduce the quantity of flower by 1/4 cup, but when I reached there, I felt the batter too liquidy, so I put the entire quantity in. It was not too dry. I used fresh pinapple. I think the trick is to use fresh, juicy pineapples.. for the juice will seep down into the cake and make it very moist. I had cut the pineapple early in the morning and put it in the fridge. I made the cake only some 4 hours later. So a little juice had collected at the bottom of the pan (abt 2 tsp)wich I added to the batter. But I don't think that would have made a difference to the moistness of the cake. I also added about 2 tsp of cinnamon. It added a wonderful flavour to the cake. I was scared whether I'll have any sticky problems, for I used a normal rectangle mold, but it came out very easily. All in all a wonderful recipe. I brought the leftover pieces from dinner to work today and it disappeared like the proverbial hot cakes :) I have got requests to make it for out next party.. :) :)

I have lost my pineapple upside down cake recipe and have been looking for one to replace it. While this one was ok, I think I will continue searching. I added pineapple juice to the batter to make it sweeter. It came out kind of doughy. Overall, ok but I think there's better out there.

I made this last night and attempted it with a bag of frozen  pineapple chunks that were wet - and it worked just fine.  The cake turned out fabulous!  I would defintely make this recipe again.  I did use honey in place of the brown sugar and will try Splendia for the white sugar next time.  Excellent cake!

I think I solved the too dry/not sweet enough problems! Instead of the milk, I substituted the reserve juice from my skinned, cored pineapple bought at the store, which ended up being about 1/3 of a cup. To which I added a tablespoon of pomegranate juice and then topped it off to 1/2 cup using vanilla rum. It made the whole cake taste like a giant pina colada! Also, I accidentally used two sticks of butter instead of one in the batter. It resulted in a super moist cake that fell apart under my fork. Definitely not the right texture for a cake, but it certainly wasn't dry! So maybe adding an additional 2-3 tablespoons of butter would give just the right consistency? Or just reducing the flour by 1/4 cup, as one reviewer suggested.

This recipe is wonderful.  It is not quite as sweet as a traditional pineapple upside down cake but that is why we liked it so much.  If you want it sweeter you can probably use pineapple juice instead of milk but I have never tried it that way.

okay, I don't know why some people think this is soggy or way too much butter?? I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out PERFECT. I did sub margarine for butter but other than that just did what it said and it is scrumptious. Great version of a classic fav. thanks Nina.

This turned out perfectly! Thanks :) I took some suggestions from the reviews and used a little less butter in the topping and then I used half milk and half pineapple juice for a yummy flavour and moisture in the cake. Kids and I enjoyed it very much.

I cut the butter used for the base down to 1/4 cup as well as others did, used cake flour because I don't think a cake should be made using All purpose flour. Turned out awesome, the cinnamon is growing on me, still not sure if im digging it!! But overall it is a great cake

I had a pineapple that was slightly over-ripe and thought maybe making a cake would be good before it went bad. Searched and found this recipe which was quite simple. I followed the directions (didn't read a single review), but forgot to add the vanilla. I used a 11 1/2 x 8 1/2 pan. Bake time could have been less than what I set it for (but we were branding calves and couldn't get back to the house in time to test), but it did fine with 50 minutes. After reading reviews, I think I agree that the amount of butter could be reduced, but as written, this recipe is still a winner. Thanks!

This was very good, but -as much as I LOVE cinnamon- I would prefer a touch less of it.  Also, I think it would be better with some crushed pineapple in the cake itself, instead of only having the pineapple as a topping.  Will make again with a few minor changes!

Just finished making this at my sister's request for her birthday.  I don't eat pineapple upside down cake so I wasn't familiar with the baking process or what it was supposed to look like.  After the fact, I now  know there is WAY WAY WAY too much pineapple.  I used less than 2 cups and it was still WAY too much for a 9 inch round cake pan.  The toothpick came out clean, and the cake looked perfect from the oven.  However, everything that seeped under the pineapple did not cook and it have a sloppy mess on my hands.  The part of the cake that did cook was very yummy so I will try again tonight but I will only place maybe 4 or 5 rings AT MOST of pineapple.

WAY too much butter.  If I make this again, I would cut the butter requirements in half.

The cake was moist and the fresh pineapple was delicious (make sure to use a really ripe pineapple), but the overwhelming butter was just too much.  I followed the recipe instructions exactly and was expecting a real WOW factor, which none of my family received.  A disappointment.

followed this exactly, except there's no way I could get 3c of pineapple in there - I put about 1/2 a pineapple down and moved on. I didn't have a 9" pan so I used an 8"... wouldn't do that again! the mix at the bottom came up the side and bubbled over, causing smoking and requiring me to clean the oven. All that aside, the end product was fabulous. It was ready to pull out after 45 minutes and was just delicious.

I have had Pineapple Upside down cake that was so much better than this.  The topping was just mushy, not sweet and flavorful.  The cake itself was just average.  It was just not good at all.  And if you follow the recipe, it doesn't look like the picture.  It makes a small round cake size.  I definitely won't make this again.

Followed recipe exactly, pretty tastey! I would prefer more of a carmelly top, the brown sugar/butter just absorbed into the cake.  Next time will try with peaches or blueberries.  Really liked the cake flavor, must be the cinnamon!

This is not -- I repeat, not -- a bad recipe. In fact, this cake got me rave reviews. It's moist and buttery and cinnamon-y.   I did take quite a few of the suggestions of the reviewers, though.   a) Probably too much butter for the topping. I used 3/4 a stick, and kept adding brown sugar until I was satisfied.  b) Instead of 3/4 cup of milk, used 1/2 cup of pineapple juice and 1/4 cup of milk c) Added cherries  After baking 45 minutes, the outside was getting slightly burnt, and the inside was still slightly undone. I threw a piece of foil over the cake, baked an additional 5 minutes, and it came out perfect. With the extra brown sugar, this gave the edges a scrumptious, sweet crunch.  Fantastic recipe.

I just made this cake for the first time and it is delicious. I wanted to make a dessert using a fresh pineapple I had and found this recipe. I wanted to use all my pineapple so I baked it in a 9x13 inch pan. I had more space to layer my pineapple. I decreased the butter I mixed with the brown sugar to 1/4 cup. I baked it for 50 minutes. It turned out perfect and is SO GOOD. I will be making this again. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Wow! This cake is wonderful. The only deviation was my usual of adding far more vanilla than called for! And I baked it in a square pan rather than round. I use only fresh eggs from a lady in the neighborhood, which might have something to do with the fluffiness, but wow, this recipe was beautiful to make. The batter was amazingly fluffy and made a huge amount. We ate this for dessert after our Easter dinner...served it warm with whipped cream. I baked it longer than 55 mins, but I think it may be due to pan size. It separated perfectly out of the pan. It was soooo beautiful and so delicious, and super easy!!! This cake would make a great gift or to take to the office.

I love this recipe- I always make it in little ramekins so everyone in the family gets their very own cake. This is the only cake my 4 year old will eat. I don't dry the pineappe and I do mix in some pineapple juice with the milk and it is always great!

The proportion for the brown sugar was way off in my opinion. And the middle of the cake didn't seem to want to cook all the way.

My review may increase to 5 stars after trying a second attempt. My first attempt was made using a spring-form pan... WARNING: check if your spring-form pan is water-tight before using!  There is a lot of butter in pan, and it melts into a thin liquid that can leak out of a small opening.  Luckily I noticed the sound of butter spattering on the bottom of my oven and was quickly able to slide a pan underneath to catch all that butter! I'm sure the cake would have turned out more buttery and tastier had it not leaked out. I will give this another try in a regular pan... I think I will have improved results.  This first attempt has already turned out pretty good.

Success! This was my first baking project in several years since I travel so much so I made it for my office at work and it got rave reviews. I almost did not get a piece it went that fast. I will have to make another example of this with even more love and care since this outting was so delicious.

This was the first time making an upside down cake and I thought it was Yummy! I did make changes only due to I try not to use dairy and eggs too much. So instead of milk I used soymilk and pineapple juice. I used Ener G egg replacer and Earth Balance for the butter. Was not too dry doing it this way. Will make again.

I was scared to make this cake and have it turn out right after reading all the reviews.  The recipe seemed so simple and easy to follow. I omitted all the extra butter, flour and juices from pineapple and still the cake came out soo soggy, too running at the top.  It was not sweet at all.  Recipe needs revisions and the right measurements of ingredients.  I hope this turns out better for others good luck!!

I loved this recipe. I've never had this cake with cinnamon before, but I liked it. I followed the directions, except I melted the butter in the cake pan and stirred in the brown sugar and I used a 9x13 and doubled the batter. I also didn't dry off the pineapples. I will absolutely make this again!

This was yummy!  I'll most likely make this again, but I'll cut down on the butter in the brown sugar/butter mixture.  I used pineapple rings with maraschino cherried in the middle.  My two little girls helped me make this and we cooked it in a heart shaped pan!  Lots of fun!

This is a great recipe. I wanted to make a cake for dessert tonight but I didn't have a cake mix. I like that it doesnt use cake flour because that is something I usually don't keep on hand.

Really great recipe. I added a tablespoon of molasses in the topping and 1 1/2t of almond extract in the cake. Perfect, very moist. Pineapples didn't shrink. I wouldn't leave anything out.

I loved this recipe!  It was my first attempt at pineapple upside down cake but it came out AMAZING - moist, tender and not to sweet (I am a diabetic so I actually prefer that!).  

I did review the notes beforehand and think perhaps next time I will use some of the pineapple juice in place of the milk and perhaps up a the cinnamon a bit but it was really good.

We served it fresh from the oven with vanilla bean ice cream.

Thanks for sharing such a fabulously simple recipe!

This Cake has great texture to it but it isn't sweet enough. I varied the receipe by replacing the milk with pineapple juice and Rum. Good Idea but not enough sweetness to it.

This makes a pretty good cake.  I am used to pineapple upside down cake having a yellow cake, but this is a little different.  Definitely recommend heating leftover slices for about 20 sec on defrost in microwave before eating--it tastes much better warm.

I substituted soy milk for the milk and milk-free margarine for the butter with great success.  The cake had a lovely soft and light texture and the pineapple topping was tasty.  It was best while still warm from the oven, but still quite good the next day.

Maybe a little less butter with the brown sugar as I had trouble getting it all incorporated ( and it bubbled over a little bit in the oven)  but very tasty.

Pretty good.  Changes:  instead of milk. I used 1/2 cup almond milk and 1/4 cup pineapple juice.

I’d suggest cutting butter that is combined with the brown sugar from one cube down to 3/4 cube.  

Also be wary of the liberal coating of butter which is added to the pan before you pour in the sugar mixture.  I used too much.  Just need a little bit.

What a beautiful cake! Absolutely delicious! I followed the instructions to a T (well, almost) and man it was soooooo good! I got compliments from everyone. It just melts in your mouth, it’s moist and just the right amount of sweet. I used canned pineapples, I also used 75% pineapple can syrup and 25% milk. I also added a bit of nutmeg to the mix (personal preference). The brown sugar I used was dark so it ended up looking like it was burnt (but it wasn’t) next time I’ll use a lighter brown sugar or mixup white and brown sugar to get a brighter color. I can’t wait to make this again.


2nd time: I used 70% white sugar and 30% brown sugar for both the caramel and the cake itself.
Didn’t change anything else. Great recipe!

Awesome cake, specially for tea time.  Will make again and probably serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
Only my cake cracked in the middle o want to know how to avoid it.

Delicious, moist and flavorful!  I used a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple (drained and then squeezed dry with cheese cloth), about 20 maraschino cherries, substituted pineapple juice for the milk, and cut the butter back to 6 T. (salted butter) for the topping with an additional 1/2 T. butter just for buttering the pan. It was done perfect right at 45 mins and slid right out of the pan without sticking. I think the trick is getting the pineapple as dry as possible to avoid a soggy cake. Also 3 cups of pineapple wouldn’t have fit in my regular 9 in. cake pan, if using that much, I would use a bigger/deeper pan.

I have to give this cake a  star rating.  I is so moist and the flavor is great. The only possible  thing I would change is not adding the cinnamon I really didn't care for the taste of pineapple and cinnamon.  I did make this cake in a  9 x 13 inch pan with a few changes. I melted 3/4 cup butter in the pan and increased the brown sugar by 1/4 cup and used enough pineapple to fill the pan. By doubling the cake ingredients it is perfect for a larger cake.  I am sure this cake will become a family favorite.

Love this recipe! I used crushed pineapple drained. And I used 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup reserved juice from drained pineapple. Also, all I had was salted butter and it came out delicious, I adjusted the salt to 1/4 tsp instead of 1/2 tsp.

Great dessert. I used canned pineapple and baked in a springform pan (dripped in the oven a bit) Turned out great I also used 1/2 cup milk with 1/2 cup of pineapple juice and used rings instead of chunks.

Such a good recipe! The batter was so silky and light, and the end result was delicious. I made the recipe as written, but I think next time, I might add some shredded coconut to the top with the pineapple.

I followed the recipe exactly and did not have any issues. I ended up with a delicious, moist and fluffy cake. Reading other comments about soggy mess or dry cake, I knew I had to be careful with moisture control. A couple tips I have: 

1) The topping butter does seem to be a little bit much, but I didn't have problem making it work. I recommend NOT melting the butter completely (to the point where it's translucent). Just melt it to when there's still some solid left. Then stir it to melt the rest. It should still be opaque. Depends on how moist your brown sugar is, you might have some leftover runny butter. Just drain the excess out before pouring into pan.

2) The pineapple really needs to be dried well, otherwise you run the risk of it making the cake too wet and a soggy mess. When I need to dry pineapple, I always use a salad spinner. It does the job fantastically. Not to mention you get some extra pineapple juice!

3) If you dried the pineapple well, then you don't have the luxury of having extra moisture. So always under bake when in doubt. I baked it for 30 minutes first on slightly higher than middle rack. Since this cake doesn't run the risk of collapsing, I pulled it out and checked it with toothpick to judge how much time is still needed. I baked it for another 10 minutes. I pulled it out and left it in the pan to cool/finish baking for 15 minutes as instructed. It was perfectly moist and fluffy.

Made as written and it came out well.  The bottom of the cake was a little bland but the topping was sweet and delicious.  Cinnamon might not be needed.

I wish I would have read the reviews first. I think most are right and you can use less butter when you are mixing it with the brown sugar probably also a 9 inch pan works great. You do need to bake it at least 45 if not 55 minutes. This cake was absolutely delicious, moist, and beautiful flavor

Followed the recipe exactly and found it a tad too sweet and the cake too firm. The flavour was great with a cup of coffee. A good cake to serve with company - I made it for just my husband and I it was a bit much for the following days.

Amazing. Changes: 1) half the butter and brown sugar on top; 2) 1.25 cups flour for moisture; 3) 1 TSP almond extract instead of cinnamon.  Plan to cut the pineapple smaller next time.

I was so excited because I was craving this, and thought I had canned pineapple chunks, but I’m such a dope, and I opened the can only to find crushed pineapple. I used it anyhow. I had to halve the recipe because I only had a square pan, so I did the recipe exactly as written, except for my goofy crushed pineapple and I baked it for 35 minutes. I don’t usually photograph my food, but I’m posting a photo of it, because I wanted to show that it turned out great even with my impromptu substitution, for which I used a whole can of crushed pineapple, squeezed it to death, and sprinkled it on the bottom layer. The bottom (top) is nice and carmelized and has some crunch around the edges, and it came out of the pan really easily. If your bottom (top) is soggy, I think it’s like one other reviewer mentioned, that you either used too much pineapple, or I’d say you didn’t squeeze it well enough. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the butter amount or any of the ingredients, proportions,  or directions in this recipe. Great cake!

Four stars because it's too much butter and sugar. I decreased both to adjust but still had butter oozing out of the pan while it baked.  Very tasty cake though. I also added some lemon zest.

The answer to why it is coming out right for some and wrong for others  is right in the recipe itself. I suspect there is a missing ingredient in the 'topping'= flour. It may even be regular sugar, or banana mash, or shredded coconut. There is no way you can "spread" that concoction of butter and brown sugar. It's a liquid. It will do nothing other than pour unless you refrigerate it. I added 1/4 cup of flour to the butter/sugar mixture. Adjust to whatever suits you. Also, dropping your cake pan on your counter a few times will settle your design and get rid of any large air pockets. I turned my oven to 400f for the initial rise and then down to 350 to continue the baking.

This turned out to be pretty good. Made some changes-- sprinkled some chopped pecans onto the brown sugar, didn't dry out the pineapple (used 1 can of rings, cut into pieces), used half-and-half (needed to use it up) instead of milk and about 1/4 cup pineapple juice to make up 3/4 cup liquid, added some almond extract instead of vanilla. Made high-altitude adjustments also (added 2 TBSN flour, decreased baking powder, added 2 TBSN juice, baked at 365); baked for over 50 min b/c it was in an 8x8 pan. Quite tasty.

Great recipe. All I did differently was to reduce both the brown and white sugars by one third. Added the pineapple juice from the can  about a half cup. Then I had need to add more flour,about a third of a cup. Which btw i used self rising  So no baking powder or salt needed. Added a bit more butter to the skillet and i nixed the cinnamon and added vanilla insread. I also added another egg.  Finally I used pineapple rings from a can instead of fresh. And added some marachino cherries for effect. I baked it in my 8 inch round cast iron skillet. The results was stunning. Everyone at the potluck raved. I think it was tasty but I didn't even get one bite. I should have made two!  Thanks for the great recipe! Sarc..........


I wonder if anyone will catch the subtle irony of my complete change of the recipe. Doubtful. Why are people so rude to do that. Anyway I made the cake as the original and it was perfection. Oh it was true about the dinner. Everyone was quite impressed. Big kudos for such an easy recipe with excellent results. Thank you

I made a couple tweaks as per the other comments and it turned out delicious. First, for the topping, I cut the amount of butter in half and used just 1/4 cup. I also reduced the amount of flour by a quarter cup. Lastly, I baked it for just 30 minutes. It was a rather thin cake, but tasted absolutely wonderful. This is the first time I have tried upside down pineapple cake and must say I am very impressed.

This is the first try with this cake. I used pineaple juice along with milk  .I made this with less butter . About 1/4 stick on the topping and 3/4 stick in the cake . Also I used almond extract instead of vanilla. We had to bake it for almost an hour. My niece and I do baking crafts every weekend and she loved this one. Success!!!

It was super delicious and moist. I poked holes with a toothpick once I took it out the oven to let the juices of the pineapple soak in once I flipped it over. My dad said it was his new favorite cake. Easy to make and just the right amount of sweetness and tartness

This is a delicious cake and I think the fresh pineapple makes the difference.  I just felt like making an easy cake so I chose this one.  I saw one recipe where you must separate the eggs and whip the egg whites and fold into the batter.  I'm sure it make a good cake too, but this one is easy to make and after a day on the farm taking care of 31 baby ducks,  horses, dogs and cats I just really wanted something good and easy.  This is it.

So the cake was okay, lovely flavor, but I think the butter /brown sugar at the bottom needs to be crumbly rather than soupy, so I will definitely cut butter for next time.

As I usually do, I made this the first time exactly in accordance with the recipe and was very  pleased.  The cake is moist and the hint of cinnamon in the batter is delightful.  The topping was gooey and using fresh pineapple chunks takes it up even another notch.  I have a new go-to recipe for pineapple upside down cake!

Followed the recipe exactly, with one exception.  I only had heavy cream.  I substituted it for the milk.  My cake came out quite dense.  Maybe due to the cream.  But it baked well, looked OK, and tasted good.  It was easy overall. I am going to try it again and shoot for a much fluffier batter and hopefully a spongier cake.

I used a 8x8 square glass pan,  cut down the butter for topping to around 5/8 of the amount that the recipe recommended,  used brown sugar instead of white sugar (lack of white sugar in my kitchen),  used Kitchen Aid Mixer to mix all the ingredients really well, and baked the cake for the full 55 min. The cake turned out to be GREAT and delicious! Good cake thickness. Good level of sweetness to go with fresh pineapple chunks that my husband and I cannot finish because they were way too tart.  My first pineapple upside down cake.  It is totally a success.

This was very easy to make and a very moist and tasty cake. I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I had been wanting to try a pineapple bacon upside down cake for some time. I only had 4 strips of bacon left over in a package. I cooked those off, crumbled them. Since I was afraid there was not enough bacon flavor I used the bacon drippings for part of the  melted butter. Bacon drippings are natural and have the same calories/TBL. as butter. I am not apologizing. It was very moist and tasty. More bacon the next time would be even better.

Recipe is super easy. However I used veg. oil instead of butter in the cake batter. And also used pineapple syrup in the compote and yoghurt instead of the milk. I also added 1/4 cup of flour to make the batter thicker. It was delicious

I made this cake with the adjustments suggested by other reviewers. I used 1/4 butter for the topping and 1/4 in the batter. Also used 1/3 milk and 1/3 pineapple juice. Cake tasted great. Moist and not too sweet. Took longer to cook in the oven - a full hour (gas mark4) Husband who's not usually a fan of cake loved it. Will definitely be making again. 
4/5 because of the adjustments needed to the original recipe

Delicious and moist! Cake overflowed. Next time will take some of the batter  to make 1 or 2 single serving cakes.

It is a good recipe in theory, but I subbed some things out, to reduce the richness.
What worked:
I subbed:
-brown sugar topping with coconut sugar
-1/2 cup butter with 1/2 cup vanilla favored greek non-fat yogurt
-skipped adding additional vanilla altogether
-used 3/4 cup almond flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour instead of 1.5 cups all purpose flour
-2/3 cup brown sugar in the cake with 1/2 cup agave nectar
-3/4 cup milk with equal parts 0% milk and unsweetened almond milk
-omitted the cherries altogether, just did not have them on hand.

Believe it or not, it was still way too rich and sweet.

What did not work:
The thickness of the pineapple, I might have cut it too thick. It needs to be cut no more than 0.25 inch thick - even that might be too much. The pineapples did not cook through in my first attempt.

USED ALL THE BUTTER called for, so glad I did! My cake was perfect and had a crazy delicious caramel around the edges! My only change was I used white sugar with a drizzle of cane syrup in place of the brown sugar because I was out. Perfect as is, not soggy or even greasy.

I tweaked the recipe just a smidge, and it turned out perfectly. I substituted reserved pineapple juice for the milk, used canned pineapple rings and I placed pecan halves in between the pineapple rings ( just for eye-candy). absolutely THE BEST!!!

I have made pineapple upside down cakes for years with my grandmother and my mother,we used milk and pineapple juice and cooked our cakes in a 10"castiron skillet.  We always heated the butter and brown sugar in skillet while we mixed the cake ingredients. So you may want to try this way of baking.  Just be sure to butter skillet well.  In cooking in cast iron you need to watch your tempature and check for doneness with a toothpick.

This recipe makes a delicious, old-fashioned cake with a pretty presentation. I've made it several times with great results. You can substitute peach slices, apple, or mango instead of pineapple, if you like.

It was so dry (and I even added extra pineapple juice and the juice from the cherries) and very dense.  Even the topping was just ok, not as sweet and gooey like my old recipe.
I must find it!!!

I made these in muffin cups and they turned out great! The batter tastes a bit bland.. More like bread than cake, but the brown sugar coating made up for it.

I followed this to a tee besides adding little vegetable oil to a cake batter since I used all the butter with brown sugar. I baked it in one of those cake pans the side comes off and it was perfectly done in 45 minutes. It looked like bakery cake after I flipped it and tastes heavenly! All my kids inhaled their slices I'm definitely making this over and over again!

This seems to be way too much for a 9" round pan. My cake bubbled over the pan & created a mess in the oven. What stayed in the pan, however, was very good. Next time I'll use a 9 x 13 pan.

If I could give this more stars I would. I love that it uses fresh pineapple and the cake is made from scratch. My husband doesn't like chocolate or sweets very much, but he had two servings of this.  I had trouble not cutting into it before dinner! The cake is so moist and the sweet topping is perfect. We have what i think of as raw sugar here, brown and white sugar are super expensive.  I used the raw sugar in both instances and it turned out perfectly.

This recipe is a Disaster! I followed the recipe as it says.  My gut kept telling me to put it into a 9x13 pan like the picture shows, but the recipe says "9" round cake pan". The batter bubble over 25min in and I had cake bater all over and a house filled with smoke! :( I should have put it in a 9X13!

This was the first pineapple upside down cake I have made and I love it. It is much better than the yellow cake box mix and canned pineapple version I have tasted from other peoples kitchens. Flavorful, great texture, delicious!

Great recipe, I make it in 9*13 inch pan, without cinnamon and adding about 1/4 cup orange juice with 1/2 cup of milk - instead of 2/4 cup milk-, I got many compliments on it juicy and very delicious so thanks for this great recipe :-)

This was ok - but I found the cake a bit a bit dry. Maybe it would have been better sitting a day. I can't imagine reducing the butter as other reviewers indicated.

I was looking for a recipe that called for fresh pineapple instead of the canned that I usually use.  I sliced it as it shows in the picture instead of cutting it into chunks, but I doubt that could have made much difference in the sogginess.  We had one slice each and tossed the rest.  Besides the soggy middle, the all-purpose flour made the corners that did cook properly too dense.  I have another recipe that calls for cake flour and it is much lighter.  I won't be making this again.

So far this cake is just what i am looking for!  just right for my small family.  The batter is excellent.  I did not sift and it was still good. I will use less butter for the topping.  I haven't taken it out of the oven yet but it was oozing over the batter.  At this point if it comes out looking like a beast it will still be eaten tonight!!!  This is a keeper, for sure.

I followed the recipe to a T other than the butter/sugar mixture which the mixture was really runny so I added a little more brown sugar. Next time I will definitely cut back on the butter. When I turned the cake over onto a plate the top was soggy to the point my fruit was falling out. I used some paper towels to blot extra fluid off. But  overall the cake tasted good.

This cake was very tasty, but turned out to have a very 'bread-like' texture (the batter was rather liquidy). Perhaps part of the problem was that I baked it in a 11" dish instead, so it was rather thin. I used the substitutions suggested by other reviewers, like using 1/2 cup butter total and substituting pineapple juice for half of the milk required. Would probably try a different recipe if making this type of cake again.

I bought a pineapple to mix with banana for my baby's breakfast, and ended up with quite a lot left over. I searched for recipes using fresh pineapple, and came across this one - YUM! I'm used to my gran's cake mix/canned pineapple recipe which is delicious, but I thought ours was at least as good as hers. I didn't have a cake pan on hand, so we used two loaf pans. It was a little flatter than normal, due to splitting the recipe into two pans, but it tasted fabulous!

The fresh pineapple really makes this a special treat.
