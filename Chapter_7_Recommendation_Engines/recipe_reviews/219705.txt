Putting jalapenos on my pizza is nothing new for me, putting pineapples on my pizzas is also nothing new...but the two together, I never thought about that. I loved the sweet and spicy all in one bite. My husband and son put some pepperoni and tomato sauce on theirs. I tried it that way also, but I really liked it without the tomato and pepperoni...next time I make half this way, so I can have more slices. Thanks Catherella for such a great idea.

Love jalapenos on cheese only pizza and had never thought to use in conjunction with pineapple so I thank you so much for your pizza idea :-)  You have a good recipe here, however, I made a couple of changes based on my own personal taste. Ditched the Italian herbs, parsley and the 1/2 cup of parmesan used to coat the pineapple and instead of those ingredients switched up the flavors with the following: Reduced the mozzarella to 3 oz and mixed in 3 oz smoked gouda and 3 oz of smoked cheddar with the mozzarella. Wasn't sure if you meant fresh or canned chopped jalapenos but since I had neither on hand used 1 cup (love extra heat - LOL) of jarred sliced jalapenos. Yummo!

Awesome.  I followed the recipe (using previously frozen "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust...fabulous & the recipe is here on AR) w/minimal "tweaks".  I did not measure the seasonings, as I was making this on 1/2 a pizza...I simply brushed a bit of EVOO on the crust and sprinkled both the Italian seasoning and parsley over top (I was wary of the parsley and almost left it off, but I'm glad I didn't; it works!).  I used fresh pineapple and canned jalaps and added a bit of diced onion, too, which was a wonderful addition!  I used mozzarella cheese, as well as a bit of cheddar, some grated fontinella, and a bit of crumbled goat.  I just realized when I came back to upload a photo and write this review I forgot to toss the pineapple chunks in parmesan; I WILL do this next time.  And, YES, there most definately WILL be a next time.  And a time after that.  And a time after that....

This was a winner! Followed others and added pepperoni and onions to it as well. Also, used refrigerated chopped pickled jalapenos instead of the fresh. I didn't measure anything just did it all to taste. We loved the flavor combos going on here. The only thing I may change next time is to use pineapple tidbits instead of the chunks for better distribution. This is a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

Yummmm! I just wish there were more protein. I got hungry too quickly afterward. However, I'm pregnant; that could be part of the issue. :)

I maded this recipe as stated except that I subbed the pizza crust for a sliced french baguette.  I also scaled the recipe to a smaller portion so therefore just eyeballed all the ingredients.  This recipe is really, really good and I wished I had more when my serving was gone!  Definitely a keeper for me!  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Catherella1!

Great combo of pizza toppings, I love the spicy/sweet flavor, just be sure to drain those pineapple chunks well, and use fresh jalapeno if you can find it (i found it really makes a difference). Thanks for sharing :)

Spicy, sweet with a touch of saltiness - this pizza has it all, expect meat.  It was exactly what I was looking for, for dinner tonight.  I made 'Syrian Bread' from AR to use as the crust, and made individual pizzas.  I made mine as written, but added onions, tomatoes, and sweet peppers to the guys.  We all loved the combination of the jalape√±os and pineapple.

This is one amazing pizza hands down!  The pineapple, jalapenos and mozzarella go so well together, who would have thought?!  I made this for just myself so I used a Naan bread in place of the pizza crust.  Will be making this a lot!!

Tonight we had some friends over for pizza, and we made two---one with Exquisite Pizza Sauce and all the regular things (pepperoni, pineapple, mild sweet sausage, etc), and the other we divided into two parts: one buffalo chicken pizza and the other this one.  Well, I would have preferred just having this one hands down.  So yummy!  For half of it I used half a minced fresh jalapeno and fresh pineapple along with parmesan and mozzarella.  I would recommend this for anyone!  It was just the perfect mix of ingredients.  I may just have to try it again tomorrow because it was that good.  Thanks for the recipe!
