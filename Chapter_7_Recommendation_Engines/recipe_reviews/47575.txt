You can substitute pear juice with pineapple juice(either from can or fresh pineapple) which will make the meat really tender.    Increased the sesame oil to 1T instead of 1t and added green onion to it.

Very good, smells wonderful!
I needed something to go with a soba salad (from this site also), and finally decided to try this. It's been in my list of favorites for a while. After reading and comparing reviews, I doubled mine as this: 3/4 Cup lite soy sauce, 2 Cups pear juice, 6 Tbl white sugar, 4 Tbl minced garlic, 2 Tbl sesame oil, 2 tsp. sesame seeds (toasted), 1/4 tsp black pepper, 2 pound thinly sliced rump roast, green onions and carrots. I marinated for 3 hrs.
(to easily thinly slice the meat, freeze for about 2 hrs)
I made a reduction from the leftover marinade, and served it with some jasmine rice.
Next time, I'll tenderize the meat, to make it more soft.

This made good beef, however, I recommend sticking to the 1 hr. marinade time. I left mine overnight and the soy was so strong it tasted like my homemade jerky. It still gets 4 stars because we love that salty home made jerky taste. I'll have to try again with less marinade time.

This is such an easy, delicious recipe. And flexible. Tonight I used OJ in place of the pear juice and pork instead of beef. WIN.

I loved the flavor. I marinated the meat for 24 hours. I didn't use any MSG but did add steamed broccoli to the skillet when cooking the meat. Excellent!

Tasty tasty, says my kids but like every asian dish I make they like lots of sauce so I put 2 cups of pinneaple juice to one cup of soy sauce and then doubled it in the recipe. Blended it all up with garlic and three onions and still they wanted more of the delicious sauce.  Fried marinated pieces on the pan with the marinade and let half of it evaporate to thicken the sauce and served it over rice.  Yum!!!

This was a real hit!  I did substitute pineapple juice for the pear juice as one reviewer suggested.  I also used an organic soy sauce (no MSG) and omitted the MSG.  You don't need it  as the dish is very flavorful and it's an excito-toxin. I will definitely be making this again.

Instead of pear juice, we added half a can of sliced pineapples. It tenderizes the meat. Also, we throw the sauce mixture into a blender, including the onions. Just blend it all together, then soak the meat in this blended mixture. Came out great!

I couldn't find pear juice, so I used the wine..couldn't find sesame seeds, so I left them out...let it marinate for 2 1/2 days, and then stir fried...Wonderful!! Even the two year old liked it--and he isn't a big fan of meat. (Hubby liked it so much he asked me to make if for his mother when she visits this weekend.)

SO good, almost exactly like that in my fave Korean restaurant.  Used brown sugar and froze the beef before slicing for thinner cuts.  Highly recommend. Ate with red lettuce leaf.

I spent a year in Korea back when I was in the Army in the '70s.  While there I purchased a Korean Recipe book and perfected making Bulgogi.  Along the way I lost the cook book..

This recipe is nearly a perfect reproduction, and may actually be better than what I remember..

Like others have mentioned, I also used pineapple juice... 

The only change I would make is to reduce the amount of pepper by about 30% or so...

But...thanks, this was great!

This dish is fantastic.  So full of flavor.  I used moose meat instead of beef because we have a freezer full and this is probably one of the best ways I've cooked it.  We put it over rice. The kids loved it so much there wasn't enough!

This turned out great!  I really like bulgogi and was suprised when I stumbled across this recipe.  I used pineapple juice instead of wine, because that's what I had and it made more sense to me.  At first I used my grill pan, but when the house got smokey I switch to a large skillet and we liked the meat cooked in the skillet better.  I really liked this recipe.  I even made it two days in a row.  I can't wait to taste it barbequed in the summer.

Love this recipe.  My Aunt made this while we were growing up, and now I can make it myself.  Though because of the soy sauce this has alot of sodium so we cannot eat this too often.

Accidently added an entire cup of sugar but still came out tasty.  I used low sodium soy sauce and used the pears from the canned pears that I used for the juice as part of the marinade.  Very tasty and kids really liked it.

I loved this recipe! I thought it was even better than the Bulgogi at a local Korean restaraunt, not to mention cheaper. I marinated the meat for 24 hours and it came out sooo tender. I can't wait to make this again!

Very tasty!  I would recommend less pepper though - and my family likes pepper.  I used pear nectar since I couldn't find pear juice.  I don't know if it would have come out differently, but it was yummy.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Tasty! Although I would never, ever eat monosodium glutamate (MSG) since it's really very unhealthy. Instead you could use salt or stock.

I used pork for this and it was still really good. I also added green bell pepper and 1 tsp. chile garlic sauce. However, when I was cooking it, the pork got really tough and chewy. Maybe I will cook it for a shorter time if I make it again.

Please cut the soy sauce in half, it will make all the difference. Also double the pear juice! Overall take somewhat like the restaurants.

I followed this recipe to the tee but used the wine instead of the pear juice. Maybe the pear juice would have made it better. I did grill it on an indoor grill and let it sit in the marinade for about an hour and a half before doing so. Even so it was not very good. It was just okay. Probably will not make it again.

This is the best i've ever had.. 
better than my mum'z. 
adding the pear juice makes the meat very flavourable.

Very nice.

I won't use this recipe again.  I have had Bulgogi from my Korean friend and it was different than this.  Thanks for the recipe, but it didn't taste like what I am use to.

My kids are very picky eaters escpecially when it comes to meat.  I let them help make the marinade putting everything in a blender even onions, (as suggested by one viewer) and then we just fried the meat in a pan and had it with white rice.  So good.

I found it too salty, otherwise it was good.    I used fruit cocktail juice (not the syrup, but the juice).  I also used stewing beef and it still turned out ok.

Unbelievably tasty! Turned out better than our favorite Korean restaurant. I cut back on the black pepper to turn down the spice and used pear juice. A definite favorite in this household!

This was good but I didn’t grill it. I cooked it on the stove in a skillet. I kept all the liquid and cooked brown rice at the same time with the meat. After the rice was cooked I added half a bag of frozen green beans. One skillet meal!

I decided to cut the amount of soy sauce in half, used pineapple juice instead of pear, no MSG, green onion instead of white, and chicken thighs instead. I served it with white rice and topped it with some chopped green onion. It turned out great. Definitely will make again. My husband loved it too, and he can be pretty picky

This had much potential. There was too much pepper for my family's liking. There are a couple people in my family that do not like spicy food. I like it, but this was too much black pepper. I think my mistake must have been that I tried using the sauce as a type of gravy for the rice. I liked the general flavor of it, so I will make an adjustment the next time.

I thought it was a little salty. Might reduce the soy sauce next time. Reduced the sauce. Made bulgogi tacos topped with kimchi and sriracha. Will definitely make again.

I subbed apple juice for the pear or white wine and did not use MSG as we have a sensitivity to it in our family; made no other changes. This was just way, way too much black pepper. I'm wondering if 1 Tablespoon is a mistake in the recipe. I will make this again, try the pineapple juice suggestion, and cut back substantially on the black pepper.

I tried this in the crock pot, and it was wonderful! I subbed Adobo seasoning for the MSG, and used a little rice vinager in addition to white wine, and added some smoked paprika and ground allspice: I will definitely make this again!

Yum! I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and halved the soy sauce, and I replaced the pear with pineapple juice. Served on lettuce wraps with sesame rice and kimchi. The best part? I made the marinade in a gallon-sized ziptop bag over my lunch hour, put the meat in, and when I got home, dinner was ready in the amount of time it takes to make a pot of rice! Loving this recipe, and will make it again!

I learned to make Bulgogi when we were stationed at Camp Humphreys back in the 80's and have been making ever since.   Had never tried it with the pear juice before. I did add carrots as this is how I have always had it. Yum-my!

Yum!  Made this tonight with jasmine rice and loved it.  I did also use half the soy sauce (light) and double the pineapple juice.  Cooked it with the broiler and reduced the leftover marinade for a little sauce.  Will definitely make this again soon...  I'm only giving it 4 stars because I modified it.  As modified, I thought it was a 5!

I tend to follow recipe instructions pretty closely when I first make a dish. Big mistake this time. The recipe instructions didn't say to do so, but if you're going to make this dish - remove the meat from the marinade and drain well before cooking.    I assumed, that as it didn't say to remove from the marinade, that the liquid was going to make a sauce. Well it did alright.  Even though I didn't use anywhere near all the marinade, the dish still tasted like pure salt.   I'll try one of the other Bulgogi recipes on this site before I ever try this again.

Definitely should lower the amount of soy sauce.  Also, if you don't have pear juice on hand, my mom purees kiwis or adds sprite for sweetness.

This was very good but not quite what I was looking for.  We love bulgogi from a restaurant in Reno and that is what I'm searching for.  So, the search goes on however, I will be making this again....just wouldnt call it bulgogi.  I followed the recipe exactly...well almost.  I decided to pan fry the meat so I added all the meat and all the marinade to the pan, cooked it until the meat was done and the marinade boiled down some then added a little cornstarch to thicken it up.  We love sauce.  Yummy!

This was okay, but too much like regular terriyaki.  I even halfed the soy sauce.  Not like what I had in Korea.

Very, very good.  It has been several years since I last enjoyed eating at a Korean restaurant, but this definitely brought back fond memories.  It tasted just as I remembered.  I did take the advice of others and halved the amount of soy sauce and doubled the amount of pear juice.  Overall an excellent recipe.

This was good but it does not taste like the bulgogi my mother-in-law makes or that we have eaten at the restaurants here in Dallas.  I think there is too much soy sauce and it is taking away some of the authentic flavor.  May try again with less soy sauce.

Family loved it!  Other than letting it marinate for 2 hours, I followed the recipe to the dot.

I didn't have any pear juice...next time I will try that.  I love love loved this dish.  I shaved the beef nice and thin and the marinade was wonderful.  I served it with fried rice and it was a hit!

WARNING:  Way, way too much salt.  Much saltier than Korean restaurant bulgogi.  Wish I had cut down on the soy sauce, at least by half, maybe more.  I should know better. What was I thinking??????

This recipe was awesome! I made it for a friend and she loved it, but I have to say it was so good I ate most of it! I did however use sirlon steak instead. It came out wonderful! Will make again!

The recipe was good but a little too salty for me. I would recommend apple or pear juice over white wine. Also please note that monosodium glutamate is the long name for MSG.

My korean friends told me that I can put kiwi juice instead of pear juice.  I love this recipe, it tasted just like at restaurant! Thanks!

I've never taken the time to write a review before, but this was so easy and incredibly delicious I just had to write and say "thank you".  Even my 1 and 3 years old kids loved it.  This will be part of our regular monthly menu.
