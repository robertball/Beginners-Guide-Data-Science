Very Nice, BUT... here's what I added/changed:

Balsamic Vinegar
2 cloves Roasted Garlic (not raw)
Fresh diced Basil (more)
Vidalia diced Onion(sweet)
Since Parmesan is very strong, I halved the amount and used ONLY freshly grated Aged Parmigiano Reggiano Parmesan and the other half I used Freshly grated Pecorino Romano.

On the bread I:
Quickly toasted the bread on high heat on each side for 90 seconds (this gives you a very nice texture of crispy outside with a pliable inside (which keeps the toast from "shattering" when bitten. Plus the bread still has a nice flavor.
 And Most Important:

Use San Marzano Tomantoes instead of Romas... they have much more flavor and are Sweeter than romas. This really gets your taste buds going with the contradictions of flavors. If you can grow and use them from your garden, Even better!

If you want mini pizzas: do the MooseArella thingy.

I have read many variations and all are very good!

It was definitely missing something, so I did what someone else suggested and added maybe a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar, and I used fresh basil, instead of dried. I also added some freshly diced onion for a little kick, and it was perfect.  Also, I would let it set out for a bit after refrigeration, and serve it on garlic bread... wonderful!

Fantastic!!  Restaurant quality!  I should have doubled the recipe.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added balsamic vinagar.  I put the ingrediants on freshly made italian herb bread and toasted it in the oven at 350 degrees for maybe fifteen minutes.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This is delicious & tastes better the longer you let it sit in the fridge. I tasted it, & although it was very delicious, wanted to add my own special "touch" to it. So I added a splash of Balsamic Vinegar, some red pepper flakes, salt, & freshly ground black pepper. We used fresh basil, & may consider adding some onion next time. This is a great basic recipe that you can customize to your desire. You can add fresh herbs (oregano, parsley, rosemary, etc.), different cheeses (Romano, Asiago), etc. Have fun with it. Enjoy on a crusty baguette.

When I made this I took a loaf of French bread and sliced it lengthwise, brushed a little olive oil on it and toasted it for just a few minutes. Then I added the bruschetta mixture and put it back in the oven for around 10 minutes. I think I'll sprinkle a little mozzarella over it next time but this was still great.

I love this site but get disgusted with people who totally change the recipes. Submit your own! AND the food snobs who say "only use FRESH this" or "only the best that". Good grief people!

I have to be honest, I didn't even get to taste this...I made it for a party of 70 and put it out...by the time I turned around, it was all wiped out so
I'm guessing everyone loved it.

I cut French bread into rounds, brushed with olive oil, and toasted in oven for
10 mins at 350. Bruschetta was added right before serving.

Definently a great bruschetta recipe! I think next time I try I will follow previous reviewers suggestions and add a little more onion (I only added a tiny bit) and a splash of balsamic vinegar to give it a little more flavor. I toasted the baguette at 350 for about 5 min. and then topped it with the mixture and stuck it back in there for about 3 more min. Excellent!

This was a total hit at my girls party this weekend! I used all fresh ingredients and added some chopped cilantro and some chopped purple onion. I used shredded parmesan which made the consistency really good! I minced the garlic up really good to make it a paste before I added it then I let it sit overnight like the recipe said. I piled it on bite site bagette slices and broiled until the edges of the bread were toasted instead of just serving cold. My friends couldn't get enough!

I used 1/2 the amount of basil, 1/2 the amount of Parm (but really used romano, don't like the flavor of parm), let sit overnight.  Toasted sliced french bread, then put on the tomato mixture with mozzarella and placed in oven to broil, just until a light golden color.  VERY YUMMY.  Already have had to share the recipe with others.

I used this mixture over chicken & pasta, yum!
I did marinate all the ingredients over night to give it more flavor.
Very easy recipe.

Recipe is oily and the cheese is too much for the amount of tomatoes used.  I suggest adding the ingredients in partial amounts so as to find a consistency that mets your tastes.

Very easy and very good.  I allowed the mixture to sit for an hour before baking it - the eight hour marinade isn't necessary.

This was great!! My boyfriend wanted it everyday for two weeks! I usually serve it on toasted slices of french bread brushed with olive.  Then I top with the brushetta mixture and some feta cheese. Yum!

Between my husband and my two guests, this appetizer did not last long! Next time I will double the recipe. I followed the advice of another reviewer and added shaved peelings of parmesan cheese to the top and it definitely made it prettier.

Really fabulous. I added chopped fresh basil for color and flavor. Slice a flat focaccia into long strips, brush with olive oil, bake until they're crispy, and top with this yummy bruschetta. A great appetizer!

I'd use this recipe again except next time I won't add the grated parmesan.  It didn't look appetizing.  I'll use shaved parmesan cheese on top before broiling.

way too cheesy! it almost was paste-like when complete. i ended up with triple the tomatoes and adjusted everything else to taste. added balsamic vin. and some onions as others suggested. a good base recipe for an ingredient list but needs tweaking for sure. thanks for the recipe anyhow.

Letting the ingredients set in the fridge overnite was the key to an awesome taste.  I tried it once soon after mixing and once the next day, it was definitely better the next day.  I toasted the french bread for 1 minute (under the broiler) and then topped it off with the mixture and toasted again for about 3 minutes until it was heated through...Yummy!!!

This recipe was the average Brushetta recipe, but as every Brushetta, very tasty.  To make this the best Brushetta ever, I spread my toasted french bread slices with prepared Pesto.  This truly does really make the Brushetta even better.

This is a good typical bruschetta.  I like diced canned tomatoes seasoned with garlic or basil.  to that I add fresh plum tomatoes.  Also, I like extra parmesean cheese on top.

Excellent and very simple. I used a healthy splash of balsamic and fresh basil, to me there just was no other way. I also put shredded parmesan on top and put the bruschetta topped toast points back in the oven for a few so it would melt. Lovely, my guests loved it.

This was good, even though I like quadrupuled it.  It gave me what I needed for all the right ingredients.  The one thing I did change was not to use seasoning salt.  I did add a little bit of sea salt instead.  This was the 1st time I made bruschetta and made it for a dinner party.  Everyone loved it and said it was great.  I will definitely make again.

This was very after I added other ingredients based on other reviews.  I added balsamic  vinegar, onion and  just a little bit of sugar.  I brushed the french bread with EVOO and sprinkled with garlic and Parmesan cheese then toasted for a few min. in oven.  After I put the Bruschetta on I sprinkled a little more cheese on top before serving.

Made this for a romantic dinner with my boyfriend he really loved it as did I. Refrigerated during the day and it was still crunchy. Served it on lightly toasted Italian garlic bread. Can't wait to make it again.

YUM.  I made this last night for my in-laws and they both commented (to each other) that it was very good, I'm not sure if they realized that I made it (see my mom-in-law is very, well say, "stuffy").  Reguardless, it went over well, I used roma tomatoes and added a little onion powder.  I served it on french bread (from this site) and I really liked it as well.  Thanks Azriel!

I used roma tomatoes and fresh basil, as I don't think dried would have been as appetizing.  I didn't add the parmesan until right before cooking.  I did add a splash of balsamic vinegar which seemed to enhance the flavors.  Excellent recipe!  My husband and I ate this all up in one sitting!!

Added the balsamic vinegar like everyone suggested. Let it sit 24 hours and ate it on garlic toast. Absolutely great; can't wait to try it with other types of bread.

awesome base recipe! although i feel you need to add 1 T of balsamic vinegar and 1-2 cloves of minced garlic.definitely use fresh basil (i used about 1/4 cup fresh) and let it sit for at least 10 min to let the flavours mix. i took this to a pot luck with just some cut up bread and left out the melted cheese. it was delicious and everyone asked for the recipe. at home we add some finely cut up onion for a little extra flavour and crunch.

Yummy, however I think it would be better with roasted garlic, fresh basil and a little balsamic.  But this recipe is great during the winter when you have that craving and no fresh veggies!!

The name says it all!  When the tomatoes started falling off the vine this year I pulled this recipe out and made Bruschetta for my friends.  I think I may have created a monster in making it for them because they keep asking for more!  The only thing I changed was to add more salt - but that's a personal preference.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is good!  Mixed all the ingredients plus all the additional ones like balsamic vinegar, onions, fresh basil, fresh parsley in the mix, overnight it and put it on top of sliced italian bread that was baked at @350 in the oven for 10 mins.  Delicious!

I love this stuff, and will eat it as a whole meal sometimes! Use fresh basil, basalmic, and some finely chopped olives; the olives add a salty flavor that can't be beat.

I changed this quite a bit as I made it for a large number of people on  Christmas Day. First I de-seeded the tomatoes and then chopped them. I used fresh basil leaves, added red onion and a splash of balsamic vinegar. I let the mixture sit for 3 hours before serving on toasted Italian hard bread. The result was fantastic. I think without the changes I made the tomatoes would have been a bit bland. There is nothing better than fresh basil. The dried stuff just doesn't have enough flavour.

I tried this by itself, spooned onto thin slices of toasted baguette and I think it would be good this way if you used FRESH basil and a dash of balsamic of red wine vinegar ~ but I found it very blah as is. (Sorry Azriel) I think it is a very good base though. I doctored mine up by spooning them onto baguette slices, topping with shredded mozzarella, and popping into the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese. It's the only way I could get The Boy to eat them ~ of course the "Picky" wouldn't touch them at all but, well, that happens with a lot of things.

I substituted several smaller Roma's instead of 2 large tomatoes.  I agree with the other reviewer who said this was too cheesy.  This was still good though and the benefit is that unlike some other Bruschetta recipes there aren't a ton of ingredients.

This tasted ok, but way too cheesey in my opinion.  I guess I've learned that I prefer my Brushetta more natural.

This is great. I doubled the recipe and added two more tomatoes.  I let it sit overnight, but kept tasting it throughout the night and i ended up eating half a loaf of sliced french bread.  I served this over sliced french bread brushed with olive oil and toasted in the oven, then added the bruschetta. Recommend using the bread that needs to be finished baking for 10 minutes after being bought from store. If you don't like tomatoes you probably won't like this.

Thanks for the recipe. Sometimes I only want a four ingredient recipe. especially if it just an appetizer. I see some reviewers totally change the recipe to the point it is harder to shop for and prepare than the main course. Thanks again.

used a baguette sliced, sauteed the garlic sliced,  in a little hot olive oil in a non stick skillet till golden, removed and minced fine and added to the tomato mixture,then toasted the baguette in the oil till crispy( it holds up to the juicy tomato mixture better) I used grape tomatoes, fresh basil, purple onion, minced fine, and an Italian cheese blend. stuck the loaded toasts under the broiler for 2 minutes,awesome..

Best bruschetta I've had. Like others, I added some diced onion. I brushed the tops of French bread slices with olive oil, broiled on low until just toasted, then added topping with shredded mozarella and broiled on low 'til melty. First batch disappeared before I could try it -- had to make more!

Love this recipe, but it really needs two VITAL changes: first, use FRESH basil, finely chopped. Second, mince the garlic and combine with the olive oil. Throw it into the microwave for 30 seconds. It gets the garlic a little cooked and infuses the olive oil with flavor! I could eat the entire batch...

I prefer to use fresh basil and 1/2 olive oil with 1/2 real butter and mix with this the tomatoes and garlic I use small loaf of french or italian bread or even bread sticks and slice them and top the ingredients on and broil them under the broiler for just minutes but you have to watch them they brown fast..

I have made this about three times now and everytime I make this it gets rave reviews.  Everyone just loves it.  I take some of the other suggestions and add fresh basil, oregano and balsamic vinegar. This infuses the tomatoes with such great flavor sitting overnight.  I also place a mixture of mozzarella and provolone cheeses on top of the bread and bake until melted then serve.  This is a great recipe.  Thanks!

My husband and I had a dinner party, everyone LOVED it.

I added some capers, tripled the garlic cloves and didn't refrigerate it.

Also, on some of the bread slices I added kalamata olive spread, which was great.

Easy, delicious recipe!

Great recipe but I changed it up a little. I brushed the bread with olive oil, put it in the oven at 400 for about 5 - 10 minutes. I substituted Parmesan with mozerella. I put the topping on the bread and stuck it into the oven until the cheese was melted. Turned out fantastic.

We really liked this for a quick and easy Bruschetta.  My daughter loves Bruschetta so I will use this recipe at home.  Don't think I would take it to a party or anything though.  It doesn't look that pretty with all the cheese in it.

My husband and I love this recipe.  I added a little bit of chopped red onion which added to the flavor but be careful of adding too much, after the mixture chills overnight, the onion is just a little strong.  We put spoonfulls on sliced french bread and baked it in a 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes.  So yummy.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for a dinner party because I needed a vegetarian cheese free recipe--I did one bowl without Parmesan and one with.  I don't even like tomatoes and I loved this.

I used canned whole tomatoes instead of fresh and got a great taste anyway.

DELICIOUS! I fixed this up one morning for a "movie date" I had at my house. My guests loved it, and the most appealing aspect was that it took me hardly any time to make. Enjoy my fellow Allrecipeans!

Excellent brushetta.  Didn't have fresh basil but will use it next time.  I assume the olive oil "divided" means using the second 2 Tbsp. for brushing on the slices of bread before browning them.  Definate keeper, Thanks Loll

I have been trying to find a recipe for bruschetta that would match the bruschetta I have at my favorite recipe. This one comes amazingly close! I tested a little before my dinner party to make sure it's okay and now I want to eat it all before the party!

This recipe is awesome! I too used fresh basil and I also used Maui Onions (Sweet!) instead. I opted not to use balsamic vinegar like many other users. I did  however add capers. It added that extra vinegar & flavor. Excellent!

Great recipe!  I doubled the recipe and used 3 garlic cloves.  Served it over crostini (french baguette sliced very thin, spread with a mixture of softened butter and minced garlic, topped with some freshly grated parmesan and baked in the oven till toasted).  I thought for sure it would need vinegar since I like the taste of it but it didn't at all.  I also used fresh basil, much better in my opinion!  It was excellent!

This bruschetta is dangerous! I have to force myself to share or else nobody will get any. We entertain quite a bit, and this has become  a standing requirement by our guests. It's easy, it's fresh and it's a relatively healthy way to snack. UPDATE: I've been making this for a few years now and here are my recommendations...only use roma tomatoes, the flavor is always good; use fresh basil and use 3 times the amount of dried called for in the recipe, it makes a great difference! Also, if possible, use fresh grated parmesan, it also makes a difference. I still do the recipe exactly if I don't have the fresh counterparts, but using the fresh makes a great recipe even better!

This recipe is great. Its my first time making bruschetta and second time eating it! I made a few little changes though. I spread a thin layer of butter over the sliced bread (on the side where you put the toppings) and baked in preheated oven for 5 mins to make the baguette crust crispy. Then i applied the chilled mixing. I did not add the cheese bcos i dont like the taste of it and my boyfriend of italian heritage thought it was brilliant. Give it a thumbs up!!

My husband and I love brushcetta and I have tried a couple of recipes before, but there wasn't one that we could both agree that we liked.  Well...this one did it!  We both loved it.  I left out the cheese and just put it on top before I tossed it in the oven, and I took the suggestion from other cooks to add a splash of balsamic vinegar.  Thank you for sharing this fantastic recipe!

I made this recipe and it was a huge hit with my family.  It was very simple to make.  I used about 6-8 plum tomatoes instead of 2 regular tomatoes.  I also used 2 cloves of garlic.  It made it little over a cup and a half or so and it was gone so quick I couldn't believe it.  I served it on slices of a french baugette. I will have to double or even triple the recipe next time.  I really think that the cheese put this recipe over the top.  I will definately be making this recipe again and again.

This recipe is great!  It tastes just like the bruschetta we get from our favorite restaurant.  I added a bit of balsamic vinegar to it, and it's perfect.  Yummy!

The only thing I added was red wine vinegar, in large part because I had it on hand when I was making this. This recipe was a big hit at the office party!!

First, THANK YOU FOR SHARING. This was extremely easy to make & as a single mom who works full time and has active kids I truly appreciate quick, delicious recipes.  I wanted to give it 4.5 stars because I did follow previous suggestions by adding a little balsamic vinegar & some onion.  I also toasted some nice italian bread brushed with a little oilive oil.  Both my kids loved this & asked when I would be making it again.

Not light , olive oil masks the other flavors ..suggest Adding a tiny amount of lime juice or red wine or white Balsamic vinegar . Use fresh Basil if possible,and hold the parm,allow guest to Add their own Parm. If they wish

Changed things up. I used fresh basil, cherry tomatoes, crushed a few cloves of garlic, added quite a bit of chili powder for the kIck, and added a splash of balsamic vinegar. Kept to the rest of the recipe. Made this three times in three days, and learnt a few things. First off its best marinated overnight. Also, removing all the pulp and slicing the tomatoes into small pieces made for a really pretty presentation. Tried a few variations, cold bread with cold bruschetta, bread toasted in the oven with the bruschetta on it, and bread toasted on a pan with a generous heaping of melted butter in the pan and adding the bruschetta straight from the fridge. The third one was the absolute best, as voted by the people helpfully test tasting the various batches. This is wonderful for parties where you can sneak out for a few minutes and emerge with a nicely decorated plate that is demolished within seconds. Thanks for sharing!

Was wonderful - just added 1 tsp Balsamic to give it a bit of BANG and it was wonderful. It was pretty too - made a very simple dish look very complicated. Even had a guest ask me for the recipe!

Oh man - best bruchetta ever is NO JOKE!  I made a quadruple batch and it was gone faster than I could cut the bread to go with it!  Some said that it was too garlicky, but most thought that it was just right!

Good recipe. I did use fresh basil instead and toasted the bread with a little olive oil. There were none left at the end of the party.

Very easy and delicious. I add a tsp of oregano sometimes as well. I like to pretoast the baguettes w/ garlic & olive oil brushed on top for extra flavor before adding the bruschetta.

Loved it! And so did my family. I broiled thin slices of baguette and served the topping at room temperature. Next time, I may try broiling it again with maybe mozzarella on top after the tomato mixture is added.

Cool & refreshing bruschetta which is good for a picnic.  Only difference I made was substituting already bottled  Italian herbed flavored olive oil for the plain variety.  It was so easy.Will make again.

I've never had this before, but decided to add it as an appetizer to my italian dinner menu. My guests and I were pleasantly surprised. It was very tasty! I used a multigrain italian bread loaf from the grocery store. I sliced & brushed it with olive oil and then toasted it in the oven. I placed the bruschetta on the bread and broiled it for another 10 minutes. It turned out great!

This is one of my favorite appetizers and this recipe was the best I've ever had.  I used roma tomatoes (about 4 for one recipe) and served it cold on toasted Italian bread.  Made a double recipe for a party and it went before everyone even got there!  Absolutely delicious.

Excellent!  I didn't add balsamic vinegar - but I did do 1/2 tsp dried basil and added four leaves of chopped fresh basil.  The flavor is intense - and one I WILL be making again and again!  It's one of the few things my  husband now asks me to make for the weekends when we go places or people come here.

Really good Bruschetta! My guests loved it! Since my fridge is quite cold, I let the tomato mixture warm up a hair before serving on fresh toasted ciabatta.

I made this for a dinner party and it was gone before I could snag a piece. A huge hit.  Just don't pour the juice left over in the bowl onto the bread...too soggy.  Otherwise, an amazing beginning to a meal!

This is yummy. My family loved it.  I didn't have olive oil and just used vegetable oil and let it sit overnight. We brushed melted butter and garlic over french bread, toasted it for 5 min, then add the tomato mix and toasted another 5. YUMMY!

I made this for a party and not even a quarter of it was touched. I'll continue searching for a better recipe.

I used half the olive oil and cheese to top the bread slices, then toasted them in the oven at 350 for about 6 minutes.  It made a big difference!  Other than that I followed the recipe and it was  great.

This was the first time I made brushcetta and it came out wonderful.  I infused the oil and garlic as suggested by another reader; and also let it set overnight--awesome!  I bought some small, individual garlic breads in the natural section of the grocery store and put the bruschetta on top of that with some mozzarella cheese and popped it in the toaster oven for 5-10 minutes--excellent appetizers for my guests!!  My guests loved them.  Thanks Azriel for sharing your recipe!

This is very nice and refreshing. I added another clove of garlic just becuase I am a fiend for it. This will be good to make with the tomatoes I grow in my garden in the summer.

When I made this it came out kind of watery, perhaps from the tomatoes.  I served in a bowl as a kind of dip, though, and it was great.  If you want it as a topping I'd recommend seeding and draining the cubed tomatoes.

Be warned: the garlic smell from the bruschetta will knock you over backwards when you first open your fridge after leaving it overnight!  But don't panic--your guests (and even your tomato-hating husband) will LOVE LOVE LOVE it, and suck it up until it's gone!  For what it's worth, I serve it on slices of french bread, brushed with a melted butter/olive oil mixture and then toasted in the oven.  But I've had guests just toss the bread aside and eat the bruschetta mixture with a spoon!  Right on for this recipe!

I made this recipe in bulk and served it to about 100 people, and they could not get enough of it.

One thing I did that seemed to work very nicely: I infused the olive oil with the garlic for a couple hours before adding any of the other ingredients.  It really enhances the flavor.  I also used fresh basil and can't imagine doing it any other way.

Don't forget to season the tomato mixture to taste before refrigerating. This will MAKE OR BREAK your bruschetta, since tomatoes come in different varieties and different flavors and acidic levels.

Serve on thin slices of toasted baguette.  The bite-sized portions will make the perfect finger food, and your guests will just gobble it up.

Liked this a great deal. I didn't wait for the flavors to meld together overnight and simply tossed them together and served on toasted French baquette slices. I used grape tomatoes because that is all that I had so the flavor may have been sweeter than intended by the recipe's author. I also didn't add any seasoning salt because my grated parmesan was very salty. This was quick and easy and is definitely a keeper. I am planning on serving this at a party this weekend. THANKS!

I found that this recipe was improved by using fresh basil, adding about 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar, and leaving it at room temperature for an hour or so before serving.  Also, it does not alter the balance of flavors dramatically to lower the olive oil amount by half and/or add more tomatoes.  (I think they are better if chopped fairly small) In a pinch, a mixture of roma and grape tomatoes is good.  Also, I have served this without the cheese and it still is a greatly appreciated appetizer.

Excellent! I have made this twice. The second time I omitted the garlic as I found it overpowering. Instead I toasted garlic butter on french bread, then broiled with shredded mozzerella on top. The parmesan cheese is a must as is the chopped onion and balsamic vinegar. Will definately make this again and again.

This was good.  The addition of the vinegar as suggested by others was a good choice.  I did choose to marinate mine overnight and it was excellent.  Good stuff.

I used this recipe as a guideline and used fresh herbs; chives, sage and parsley.  My husband was skeptical at first but truly loved it. I de-seeded the tomatoes and it turned out great.  It might be good with plum tomato...I think fresh herbs are the way to go. Thanks!

I added 1/2 sweet yellow onion, a little extra ROASTED garlic, and added an artisain garlic bread to accompany.  My traditional italian friend gave it an enthusiastic 2 thumbs up.  You can use fresh basil instead of dried!

Added onions and used garlic powder. Let it sit overnight and then added balsamic vinegar the next day for more flavor. Easy recipe but needs to adjusted to ones preferences.

I tried this recipe tonight.  It was great.  My only complaint was with the amount of oil.  I didn't care for the oily after-taste, but that's probably me.  One thing I do want to say is that, while recipes should be able to be rated based on their ability to stand alone, their adaptability to other ingredients and cooking methods makes a recipe all the more attractive to me.  If you don't want to take suggestions to heart, fine.  I don't think people who write in with ideas mean to say that you HAVE to do things their way.  I appreciate those suggestions, but some are pretty 'out there' and I just by-pass those.  Rather than get angry about them, I like the fact that people are expressing ways to modify the recipes.

I pre-toasted the bread and spread pesto and crushed olive mixture on it before I added the tomato  then broiled it briefly.

This is a wonderful, simple recipe you can throw together quickly. After reading the reviews, I decided to follow the recipe as is. I was pleasantly surprised. It is really flavorful! Even my ten year old son who hates tomatoes loved this! Thanks for sharing, I will definitely be making this often.

My wife did not bring home fresh basil tonight so I decided to try this. I'm sorry to say but no one liked it. Way too much cheese and too little oil. And you absolutely require fresh basil.

This was my first time making bruschetta and this recipie was super easy! I did add 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar like the other reviews suggested, and I used fresh basil instead of dry and more of it. Also, I threw in some fresh green onion since I had some in my fridge already. I would definitely add some sort of onion to it.. I only let it chull for 2 hours but it tastes perfect to me. I put the mixture on some toasted French bread slices... So good!

This was a HUGE hit at my office.  I only gave it 4 stars because of all the changes I made.  I added a yellow onion, 3 cloves of minced fresh garlic, a squirt of bold Italian dressing and some red pepper flakes.  I didn't feel like going to the store for french bread, so I just quartered and toasted some regular white bread.  This was gone in minutes and everybody was raving about how good it was!  Will definitely be making it many times again in the future.

Made this with a splash of balsamic vinegar and it is perfection! My best advice? Make double or triple batches.... you will never have enough... it just disappears.

Made this today for a cocktail party and its awesome.  NO WAY you need all that olive oil - i just barely drizzled it on and added a splash of balsamic vinegar.  Great flavor and very easy!  Used Roma tomatoes.

This was a great recipe! It is good warm or chilled - my family goes nuts over this when I make it. I changed the ingredients a bit by adding black olives, it gives it a little kick.

Made this with the ingredients given. I didn't have 8 hours for it to marinate, so I marinated for 2 hours at room temperature, and it was fine. Toasted baguette slices brushed with oil under the broiler and then broiled again very briefly once I put the topping on. Served with broccoli cheese soup for a great light supper. Thanks!

Love the flavor. I use fresh basil though and a pinch of hot pepper flakes to up the spice. My DH loves this and when I see him come home with fresh tomatoes and French bread I know what he wants!

Good recipe. I added balsamic vinegar. I also toasted slices of fresh french bread in the oven, and covered them with a little bit of olive oil before baking.

I love this recipe!! It's so fresh tasting!! The only changes I make are to add a few cloves of galic (we are all garlic lovers in our house!!) and slice some spring onions up and add them too. Really tastes better the longer you leave it!! I make this often and never get tired of the great flavour!!! Yum!!

I've tried a few bruschetta recipes and this is the one I will use from now on. Only changes/adjustments:  I cut the bread, brushed it with oil, and toasted in the oven for apx. 10 minutes.  I also used fresh basil and balsamic vinegar.  I used shaved parm. and stuck it under the broiler to finish it off.

These were the hit of our holiday party last weekend!  Everyone raved about them.  I made a few variations -- I used balsamic vinagrette salad dressing (not balsamic vinegar since I didn't have any home), a bit more garlic, and no cheese.  I let everything marinade for about 5 hours.  These are extremely easy to make, healthy, and delicious.  The only downside is that these cannot be made ahead of time, as they get soggy.   Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

This was my first time ever making bruschetta & was very pleased with the result. I didn't have time to let it chill for 8 hrs, so made mine 2 hrs ahead. Served it on slices of French baguette, sprinkled with mozzarella & melted in oven several min @ 350F. Brought it to a baby shower & was eaten up very quickly!! Thanks for this great & easy recipe.

Took advice and use a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar (excellent advice) also added some imitation crab meat (just for some filler). Last two times I used baguette but couldn't toast it right. I think next time I'll use french bread

This recipe does not need so much olive oil! I made it with half and it was just fine. Also, for those reviewers that say it is missing something, add some finely diced onion and a splash of balsamic vinegar, it makes all the difference!

I studied abroad in Italy and ate lots of Bruschetta, and this recipe is ALMOST like the real thing. It's missing one important ingredient, though: Fresh mozzarella. Slice this on top of the mix and let it melt over the tomatoes in the oven for 2 minutes. Also, sprinkle 1/2 a teaspoon of Basalmic vinegar to give it a little kick. I also used 2 cloves of garlic instead of just one.

I have never had this before so decidied to make it my husband and I loved it. I also added the balsamic vinegar, let some other had said glad that I did and I also added red onion very good too. I didn't have mozzerella to melt on top with have it next time and try it. That sounds like it would be good on top of it. Very good will make again. Glad that we tryed it.

I made this for a dinner party. I mixed it the night before and used the next evening.  I always add double the garlic in all my recipes and this was no exception.  I brushed the bread with olive oil, spread on the mixture and added some fresh mozzarella crumbles. Delicious.  This is a great bruschetta and easy.

This really is the best bruschetta ever!  I made a few changes, I added a splash of Italian dressing to the mix which gave it a little something.  I baked the bread at 350 for 8 mins with a little butter and garlic salt on it.  Then added the mix and baked another 3 minutes.  It was perfect.  Thanks!

Awesome! Used plum tomatoes for more "meat" and less juice. Added a splash of balsamic and it was perfect-- our guests loved it

Great for the amound of effort & time!! No question, it needs a generous pinch of salt and a dash of balsamic vinegar.  Pre-toasting the bread allows it to stand up to the juiciness of the tomatoes without getting soggy too quickly, but this is not a do-ahead kind of thing.  I used parmesean and mozzerella on top of mine and everyone loved it.

Great base recipe. With added touches, it's a 5-star, but not quite alone. Balsamic vinegar is a must as is fresh basil. I add probably about 1/4 C balsamic vinegar and let it marinade in that with the other ingredients. Fresh chopped onion is also a great addition. With these additions, the recipe is to die for!

This is one of the best Bruschetta recipes I've ever had! It tasted exactly like the one my boyfriend and I had on our anniversary at an upscale restaurant in San Diego. VERY simple to make and not expensive either! I served this on Easter to two French friends who absolutely loved it! Serve it on toasted french bread.

I made it and added an extra clove of garlic (I love garlic) and it was AMAZING!!! It was great by itself, awsome on the bread and a great touch to salad- I had some left over and thought "why not?" so I tossed the left over into my salad and it added the finishing touch.
Will suggests it to others and will make again no in a heartbeat.

I made it in the a food processor- I cut the tomatoes into 4 and added everything. Blended it for a few seconds (3). The only thing is I didn't big pieces of tomatoe but I also made a large batch and was too lazy to chop.

I made this for a shower I threw, and it was a big hit. I had other toppings for the bread, so I just put the mixture on the side and broiled slices of italian bread. I bet it would be yummy on the bread when toasted and topped with more cheese.

Thank-you for the great recipe! It was a hit with everyone! I adjusted it a little: I used fresh basil, only chilled the mix for an hour. I then toasted a sliced beget, and topped it off with the mix and returned to the oven to warm every up.

This was the first time I made this and everyone loved it. I did add with the olive oil to the bread basil pesto from a jar. I took others advice and used fresh basil and the cheese. I cooked it in my toaster oven ( it cooked about 10 at a time) so the house wouldn't heat up from the oven. I will be using this for along time. Thanks

This was good, but not the best I've ever had.  I love cheese, but the Parmesan seemed to take away from this recipe rather than add to it.  It also made it a little unattractive.  Sorry, I'm going to keep looking for a perfect bruschetta recipe.

This was very tasty after sitting in the fridge for a couple days.  Added a bit of balsamic vinegar for a kick.  Next time I'll add some fresh green herbs rather than the dried...seemed to need a bit more color.

Good taste, like the garlic.  I also added a little balsamic vinegar.  I agree with a previous reviewer, though - fresh basil would really make this recipe shine.

I made this for my fiance's b-day party and it was a huge hit... I did make a few changes though: halved the parmesan and the olive oil, and subbed dried for fresh basil (and added a little extra for color). I didn't let it rest more than 1 hour and it still tasted great  :)

I can't believe I hadn't rated this recipe yet. I always make mine with fresh basil. I made this this morning and will try it with lightly toasted tortillas (for lower carb). That is how a local restaurant serves it and it's so yummy

This recipe is good, but I did make some changes that I think improve it a bit.  I mixed the ingredients together minus the cheese, and used fresh basil. I didn't let it sit overnight (I don't think it makes much of a difference). I baked it on top of sourdough for 10 minutes and didn't add the cheese until the very end. It's a yummy & easy snack that takes just a few minutes to prepare.

This is the BEST Bruschetta recipe that I have seen! I worked in a resturant that had wonderful bruschetta, and this is the closest recipe that I have found to it! The only thing is to use fresh basil, other than that, it is great!!

Easy, good, just takes a while to rub all those little pieces of toast with the garlic if you're having a cocktail party, so allow for it and make them ahead of time!

Great, EASY, recipe. I've made it twice and it has been a big hit each time. I used canned petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes due to laziness.

At first I think it intimidated guests at my Valentines Day party, but once they tried it, they loved it.  I even sent the recipe home with some.  Since tomatoes are really out of season for MN in February, I bought seasoned canned tomatoes and used the other recommendations and added onion and balsmic vinegar.  It turned out really good!

To die for!!  I used 1 1/2 Tbl. fresh basil instead of dried basil, and didn't chill in the refrigerator.  I used 1/4 tsp. seasoning salt, and 1/8 tsp. pepper.  Just spread the mixture on French bread slices, and broil.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was very excited to try this one.  I wasn't that impressed.  I refrigerated overnight, the oil seemed to separate too much for the rest of the ingredients.  It wasn't a hit at our dinner party.

I made this bruschetta recipe yesterday and served it tonite along with an excellent focaccia bread I also found from this site. My husband remarked "good stuff" and the next thing you know he's bypassed the bread part and spooning the bruschetta straight from the serving bowl into his mouth. Good thing we didn't have company....

This was pretty good... Not the best ever, but pretty good. I added some red onion to bring a little more flavor to it, but it was really just a basic bruschetta. Might make again.

It was made much better by using fresh basil and adding Balsamic and onions like many others have suggested.  Next time, I might try green onions.  I also cut out the parmesan and sprinkled a little mozarella on top - I loved it that way.

This is very good and easy to make. I didn't have any fresh herbs so I used Italian seasoning instead. I also used garlic powder, added some red onions, green onions, and parsley. Very yummy! I will definitely have this on my party menu. Thanks.

The only reason I gave this a low "kid friendly" rating is that my kid rarely likes anything! My husband and I own an Italian restaurant and this is now on our Saturday night menu! We always make extra for the waitstaff. Once they taste it they can REALLY sell it. It really is the BEST.

I'm not a huge tomato fan but I do like bruschetta and this was good!  We made this for a bridal shower and it was very well received.  We doubled the recipe, added some extra garlic and let it sit for about 16 hours.  The flavors melded nicely and tasted great served over toasted baguette slices.  This was a big hit with our tomato lovers!  I'll definitely be making this one again!

I woke up this morning in the mood for bruschetta for breakfast (don't ask) so letting it sit for 8+ hours wasn't an option.  I halved the recipie (except for the garlic - I just used a small clove) and broiled it in the oven on whole wheat toast (it made 4 slices) - it came out PERFECT and tasted so wonderful even without the time for the flavours to blend better.  Definitely a keeper, I can't wait to try it the 'real' way!

This was a fantastic recipe! I ran out of parmesan so I ended up adding it about an hour before serving. It was still fabulous, I also added more garlic! I love garlic! =)
Thanks for the great recipe!..  MUCH better then the store bought stuff. =)

Very good! Pro-tip: Add the ingredients gradually and taste as you go. When it's to your liking, stop and enjoy. Having said that, I thought this was tasty ans I would make this version again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was tasty. I only got mine to marinate for 2 hours. Used fresh basil, omitted the parmesan and cut back oil to just a Drizzle. Serves mine on top of cream cheese baguette.

This was very good.  I buttered and toasted the bread.  Next time I would use fresh basil, add some red onion and use fresh grated  parmesan.  Also add some garlic to buttered bread while toasting.

Everyone loved it. As other reviews have said, add Balsamic Vinegar. I went with 3/4s of a tablespoon. I also added some green onions. I brushed some olive oil on each side of the bread, toasted it for 5 mins at 350 degree, took it out of the oven, flipped the bread to the other side and added the toppings, and then put it in the oven again for another 3-5 mins.

This is a really solid bruschetta recipe. It's a good place to begin if you want to get a little creative, but is certainly very good as written. The ingredients should be easily found in most pantries and it's easy to throw together quickly as a very worthy side dish or appetizer.

i tried this receipe for the first time straight from the movie
julia,julia.... mouth watering as she fixed it..researched and found it
have been eatin it ever since. last summer fix it religiously every day with fresh tomatoes which r to die for... but hav use store bought ones.  they past the test as well... i read as many as the reviews as i could after seein tht there were like 200.. i gave up.... love all the tweets.however i was lookin to see if anyone had tried usin cream cheese..... so i decided to join the rest of the group........
after toastin my french bread on each side on top of the stove.. i make my mixture with fresh garlic,and onions... ddn' hav any basil but after lookin at all the reviews goin to get some fresh... instead of jus plain olive oil which i kno is healthier, i used italian dressing an not a lot. jus enough... after puttin all ingreds. together... i put my batch in the refrig.. but after crustin my bread, i started to spread cream cheese then put my mixture on top... ofter tryn it tht way the first time it wz amazin... been doin it every since.... but u really hav to be a lover of cream cheese... an even usin the fat free ddn stop th combination of things... hope someone else has tried the cream cheese as well.definitely goin to get some fresh basil and appreciate the balsamic splash......

The most important for the great bruschetta taste is the freshness of the ingredients. Tomatoes have to be tasty, Use the ones from own garden, farmer's market or during the winter months Campari tomatoes (can get them at Costco or Sam's club and some grocery stores). Basil is better fresh, finely chopped; garlic minced, better than crushed. Mix together, add GOOD tasting EVOO. I let it stand for up to 1-2 in room temperature. Tomatoes loose taste when refrigerated. It will get little soupy. My friends fight over  the left over juice! 
Before serving add salt to taste. No need for parmesan, or balsamic. 
Slice baguette in ? inch slices, brush with the same good EVOO and broil until nicely  golden, turn and broil the other side. Place on the platter and spoon tomato mix on the warm  toasts.  Enjoy!

Diced onion is a must. Add some lime/lemon juice for more depth. Because I have homemade pickled red onion (made with red wine vinegar), I omit the vinegar part. Fresh herb is preferred. I use chopped cilantro because I have it in the fridge. Fresh parsley or basil will do as well. My friend also adds fresh chive in hers. As for olive oil, I drizzle enough just for the consistency. I also spread coconut oil on toasted bread before assembling the buschetta. 3 servings down to my belly in 10 minutes. Yum!

great starter, added green onions, fresh basil, fresh parsley and fresh lemon juice (instead of balsamic)...no Parmesan to the mixture, but grated some on top after it was put together on toasted Italian bread

Very good and easy!  Make sure to let it chill at least 8 hours.  I was hesitant because it wasn't that good before it chilled, but the next day it was very tasty!

This was very, very good.  I used it on toast for an appetizer with chicken chili.  Leftovers of the bruschetta I put in pita pockets with ham for kiddos lunches.  They LOVED it!

I used all the same ingredients - The only think I did different is cooked the Bruschetta mixture just long enough to hear it sizzle, then transferred it to a bowl to cool.  I felt that cooking it mixed and marrinated all of the flavors without waiting the full 8 hours.  I made sure not to cook it to long so that the tomatoes were still in some type of chunky consistency.

We made this with tomatoes fresh from the garden and basil fresh from the garden.  garlic powder instead of the clove of garlic.  it was fast, easy and absolutely delicious!  It sat for maybe 10 minutes before we ate it on French bread sliced and buttered and toasted in a toaster oven.  Love putting the parmesan cheese right in the other ingredients.

Very good, I made it for a pot luck dinner we went to.  My wife and I were on a strict diet and it was perfect.  I took some french bread and sliced it real thin and placed it in the oven to toast.  It turned out excellent.

Have been making my own similar recipe for years - as other readers suggested, add balsamic vinegar to taste (I love it so usually go overboard) and use fresh basil whenever possible.  If you haven't tried fresh basil before, beware, it could change the way you view basil and other fresh herbs.  I now grow my own basil so it's always on hand!

This is a really good basic bruschetta recipe. I scaled everything down for 2 people and added about 1/3 cup diced yellow onion.  I also used regular ground salt instead of seasoning salt and half fresh parmesan cheese and half grated.  Also added about a quarter cup of mozzarella cheese.  I'm not sure if you're supposed to toast the bread and spoon the bruschetta on afterwards, but I brushed some bread with olive oil, spooned the bruschetta on, and broiled it for about 4 minutes and it turned out perfect.  Very yummy.

This was a really great bruschetta recipe. Easy and delicious. I rated it a 4 instead of a 5 because i think it is definitely better with suggestions from other reviewers. I also added a couple splashes of balsamic, 3-4 chopped or diced garlic cloves (i love garlic) and a healthy portion of chopped onion. I sauteed the onion and garlic first, but i dont think thats absolutely necessary. Finally, i added some shredded mozzarella to the mixture for some texture and to hold the mixture together. I marinated them ingredients together overnight and spooned them onto mini bread slices and toasted. Everyone at our christmas party loved them! Thanks for the recipe - i think its very versatile and i will definitely make again.

I love the simplicity of this recipe, however, it was missing something - MORE GARLIC! I will double it next time.  Also use fresh basil.  A bit of oregano won't hurt either.

Really good.  I think it might be missing a little something, maybe a little onion, and I added more garlic than the recipe called for, but a great bruschetta nonetheless.

DIDNT GO OVER VERY WELL THE FIRST TIME, BUT AFTER I FOUND OUT IT IS BETTER TOASTED I MADE IT AGAIN FOR THE GUYS I WORK WITH. THEY LOVED IT! I ALSO TOPPED IT WITH FRESH MOZZARELLA BEFORE TOASTING.

This is an excellent recipe!  My husband and I enjoy this during summer when there are more tomatoes than we know what to do with!  We slice up a take and bake asiaog garlic batard from the grocery bakery, pile on the tomato mixture (which we've usually marinated for a day or so), then fire up the grill.  We use a greased foil and toast the bruschetta - watch it, though.  Open flames + bread can sometimes = more open flames and blackened bruschetta.  The toastiness really adds a nice texture.

Good recipe but made a few changes: Only used 1T Olive Oil, increased garlic to 2 cloves, added 1T of Balsamic Vinegar, and added 2T finely diced red onion. Left out the Parmesean cheese b/c our toast already had it on it. I only had about 4 hrs to refrigerate this and it turned out great.  Bringing it back to room temperature tastes best. We made a Bruschetta Bar and allowed our guests to serve themselves using the premade Nonni's Panetini Garlic Parmesan Toast.

Not the "best" bruschetta ever, but very good.  We broiled french bread in the oven with a bit of butter on top, then  added the bruschetta.  Very tasty!

Yum! This was better than store-bought bruschetta. I added tomatoes from our garden. I only used 3 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese and a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. I will definitely make this again.

Wow!!! Fantastic! I added 1 tbs balsamic vinegar and it was superb. I made it to use up the bounty of tomatoes from our garden. My son (12) asked for it as an after school snack and ate it all! Great recipe, thanks!

Super easy, I never measure anything I cook by taste but this is very easy to make.  I like to toast my bread on the grill and then serve this cold on top.  It makes a great summer snack

This was my first attempt at bruschetta and it was fantastic!  Followed the recipe to a tee.  A great way to use up your summer garden tomatoes.  I mixed it with risotto and it was outstanding.  Thanks!

I used a wheat baguette instead of french bread.  I will use fresh herbs next time to get a stronger, fresh flavor.  I also cut back on the cooking time since my bread pieces were smaller.  This was a great addition to our pasta dish.

Very Good!! I took other reviewers' suggestions and added some Balsamic vinegar. Also added fresh basil. I used about 7 seeded Roma tomatoes as well instead of the bigger tomatoes. Toasted some baguette and then topped with the tomato mixture and broiled till the parmesan cheese melted. Heavenly! I had about a cup leftover, the next night I tossed some chicken cutlets with olive oil and italian seasoning, cooked on the stove in the grill pan, topped with bruschetta and then mozzarella, finished in oven till cheese was melty. I will make it again just for the leftovers!!

Excellent and simple recipe. My husband gives it a 4.5. I did not have any Parmasean Cheese so I just used Mozarella. I started off by using garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. After about 8 hours of Marinating it still seemed a little flat so I added just a pinch of garlic salt that topped it off just right. I did not use seasoning salt since I went the garlic route. I also added a touch of Oregano. Before baking I pretoasted the french bread like others recommended after first brushing it with olive oil and sprinkling a little garlic salt for flavor. After toasting I then added the tomatoes and mozarella and baked until the cheese melted.

A very good and simple bruschetta recipe.  I scaled it up easily for 20 servings and added a 2:1 olive oil to balsamic vinegar.   I didn't add the cheese to the mixture but melted the Parmesean into crisp cookies and laid one on top of the finished product.  People couldn't get enough of them.

This was exactly what I was looking for. I used this as a topping on the "peppered focaccia" recipe from this site. I seeded the tomatoes, doubled the basil and sprikled feta cheese on top before baking it on a pizza stone for around 25min until nicely browned and golden. I cooked it right after preparing it and it turned out great. The parmasan cheese really makes for a nice flavor. Thank you for sharing, this is added to my family's favorites.

I don't like tomatoes but made this for the family and they loved it! I substituted garlic powder for fresh garlic because I had none but none were the wiser.

I use fresh basil which is much better, plus I add a splash of herb vinegar to give it a kick!  And the Italians take a garlic clove cut in half and rub the cut side on grilled bread, lightly drizzel with a good quality olive oil, its delicious just like that or with your favorite topping.

Resist the urge to taste this until it has sat in the 'frige for a few hours! I thought it was pretty good last night, but today, it is absolutely delicious! It could definitely be played around with, but I loved it exactly as written. Thanks, Azriel!

I made this for my housewarming party.  I doubled the recipe and was worried because it had a lot of liquid.  But it was delicious!  Baked on the bread w/oil & pepper for 10 minutes.  I was told I make the best bruschetta ever!  Thank you for sharing!!

I made this as an appetizer for dinner and my boyfriend loved it!  He and his roommate couldn't stop eating it.  One substitution I made which I liked was instead of the olive oil, I used low-fat Italian dressing.  It gave it a nice added flavor that complimented the fresh garlic well.

Very good-I used fresh basil since I had it. I also used a little chopped red onion too.  Would make a nice pasta sauce.

This was good but a little too greasy.  Next time, I will cut down the oil.  I served over crackers because I didn't have any slices of bread.  Quick and easy.  Thanks.

This was just great. It was simple and easy.I toasted the bread an one side,  flipped the pieces over and put the bruscetta on the toasted side,  topped it with fresh grated parm, and back in the oven till warm.  This will always be my recipe.  Thanks!

Everyone loved this bruschetta and asked for the recipe.  I added 1 tsp oregano, fresh basil, extra garlic,   a drizzle of balsamic and used the parmesan/romano blend from Trader Joes. I didn't have time to chill for very long, so just set covered bowl on counter for about 4 hours. I served it on toasted baguette slices brushed with olive oil. It was really good!!!

Very easy and fool proof.  I was concerned because of my pathetic winter tomatoes, but it turned out great anyway.

Super easy recipe to make, but I felt it needed a little more flavor or kick.  I made this a couple of times and found that adding some finely diced onion, fresh basil instead of dried & some vinegar or lemon juice made it taste great!  All in all, a great base for the best bruchetta ever!  :  )

I serve most of the parmesan on the side, and usually accompanied by a balsamic vinegar reduction. The vinegar adds that sweet twang to the dish. Fresh basil, in my opinion, is a must for any uncooked recipe that calls for basil. Also for a little bite, you can rub a garlic clove across a toasted baguette. A little garlic goes a long way.

I wasn't all that impressed with this recipe. I love bruschetta, but this just didn't have the zing I was looking for. Will keep looking . . .

Made this once for company and once for my son's birthday party.  Went over well both times.  I add a little more garlic and a splash of balsamic vinegar.  Delicious.

Excellent.  Used fresh basil & added some kalamata olives.  Only let it sit for 2 hours & that seemed fine.

Although this was incredibly quick and easy, it think it would be much better if prepared with fresh basil rather than dried.
