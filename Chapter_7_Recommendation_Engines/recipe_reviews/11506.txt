WOW!  I had overripe bananas and did not want to make bread or cookies.  Found this one and it is already in the recipe book.  I am eating my 4th piece now!  I did make a few changes.  I used extra light olive oil instead of butter.  Reduced the sugar by 1/2cup and used 1/2 brown/white.  I replaced the almonds with walnuts and added coconut.  I did not ice it at all.  Super yummy.  I do think I will reduce the amount of sugar by another 1/2 cup next time.  The dates make it plenty sweet.  If I was to ice it for taking it to an event, I would definately reduce the sugar.  Oh yes, I mashed the bananas.  I used 3 very ripe ones.

Wow, this tastes SO good. I love dates and bananas together and this is no exceptioin. I cut the sugar back by 1/4 cup, didn't add any almonds because I didn't have any on hand, and used dried dates as opposed to the softer, moist ones packaged in plastic (although I'll definitely try to use those next time I make this). The end result was a moist delicious cake-like dessert that is just awesome with the lemon glaze on top. I made this on a whim and out of boredom, but I'll definitely be making this again and again in the future.

This recipe was great!  I had some dates to use up, so I decided to give it a try.  My family loved them.  They were moist and delicious, although my 4 year old thought the icing was too lemony, and made me scrape most of it off his pieces.  I recommend it!

This was an interesting, yummy recipe!  The cake is quite sweet, and the icing tart - exactly the opposite of what one might expect of a snacking-type cake.  I made a few changes... the thought of big smushy banana chunks in my cake made me shiver - so I substituted the 2 c. sliced bananas for 1 c. mashed bananas - ahhhhh, much better... mild, banana flavour, no chunks, still a very moist cake!  Also, I used half whole wheat and half white flour to give it even more of a "health kick".  Thanks for an interesting recipe, Sandra!

This is a truly wonderful recipe. 
I did change the recipe a bit. Split suger between lt. brwn sugar and white sugar, used 5 ripe bananas - coursely chopped for some added texture and since I love spices - added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of cinn. They can out so moist and the banana flavor is exceptional!!! Do try this recipe. You will not be disappointed. Enjoy!

We enjoyed this combination of bananas, dates, and almonds.  After reading other reviews, I decided to cut the sugar in half and that was about right.  I think that the full amount of sugar + sweet dates + frosting = sugar overload.  I mashed 2 bananas and sliced 2 more which I folded in at the end with the dates and almonds.  If you think you might not frost these, make sure to tuck the banana slices down into the batter as they become discolored on the surface. I think this recipe is enhanced with the frosting. It is just the right amount to cover the top and add zip but not be that overly thick frosting that has become the rage lately.

These were OK, but I probably won't make them again since there are so many way better recipes on this site. They lasted quite awhile and it's not something I would make for company.

Very good recipe but it more like cake than bars.  The only addition I made to the cake was adding 1 teaspoon cinnamon to the batter.  The frosting instead of 2 Tbs lemon juice we used the pulp from a fresh lemon & some juice to equal 2 Tbs.  I also needed to increase the powdered sugar to 2-1/2 cups.  I will make this again.

This cake was quite good!  I followed the recipe with the exception of mashing my bananas (4 full ones) and adding 1/2 t. cinnamon.  I brought it into work and it was well received.  I think the addition of the lemon frosting really brightened it up.  I added chopped dates to the top to give everyone's palette's a heads up! :)

These were really really yummy.  I changed the recipe a bit by cutting out the dates and adding a cup of chocolate chips instead, and they turned out great.  Also, I had to double the recipe for the icing, because the regular amount simply wasn't going to cut it.  Next time I make them I will omit the lemon juice from the icing and simply add milk instead, so it's just like vanilla icing.  I found that the whole lemon taste didn't really match the bars at all.  Other than that though, they're were delicious and I just love them.  Chewy and moist, and even better straight from the frige!  Mmmmm!

This was delicious but I only gave it 4 stars because I made a few changes based on instinct.  1) I only used 1 cup sugar - 1/2 white & 1/2 brown - and it was plenty sweet. 1 1/2 cups would be way too sweet. 2) I added 1 tsp. cinnamon - adds huge flavour. 3) I used walnuts instead of almonds - I think almonds have more flavour and prefer them in baked goods. 4) I used 1 cup flour and 1 cup rolled oats instead of 2 cups flour. I love oats and it added wonderful texture. I baked in a loaf pan. Very moist, very flavourful - family loved it and devoured it.

My third date bar. What can I say, I'm addicted to dates. I think I've finally realized though, that to achieve the denser texture I'm looking for, I would omit or drastically reduce all leavening agents. Secondly, this would have been even better with more banana, at least one more big ripe one. Then, more almonds and dates, at least so that it's 1 and 1/4 cup dates and 3/4 cup almonds. I had to use oil instead of butter, just because I was out, and it ended up fine, just a little dry. If using oil make sure to add 1/4 a cup of some other moisture, like applesauce, oil, or butter. Due to a dislike of icings and frostings, I omitted it all together and served the bar heated with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. I actually wanted to make this recipe because I had old bananas and I wanted to try something different rather than banana bread, but to me it really was exactly like banana bread. I really wish I had added more dates and almonds!

I reduced the sugar to 1c (1/2 white and 1/2 brown) and mashed the banana as well.  It was plenty sweet and so delicious while still warm.

What a great dessert this is.The only thing I did different was to mash the bananas and coarsely chop the almonds.The lemon icing was fantastic.I love citris so I added a teaspoon of lemon zest too.There isn't a thing that I could add to improve on this.I gave one of my coworkers a piece and he thought it was awesome too.I can't wait for the next time I make this.I'll be taking this to the next potluck dinner at church too.

Quite tasty, even without the frosting. I opted to halve the amount of sugar, as my bananas were fairly ripe and the dates quite sweet on their own. I only had extra large eggs, so this was more like a cake than a dense bar as it rose quite a bit. I mashed the bananas instead of slicing and kept the date whole- would cut them really small next time as my toddler didn't enjoy their texture and picked them out. Will definitely make this again, and you can make this even healthier with other changes too.

The sweet batter and tart icing do really work well together. I was a bit disappointed that my "cake" turned out like cake and not like the "bar" that is pictured. Not sure if I added too much baking powder or something else was off. I will try it again, because it was so tasty, but be more cognisant of measures or perhaps use an additional banana or more oil/butter.

These were delicious! I scaled this down to 12 servings (1/2 a recipe) and baked it in a 9" x 9" glass pan for 30 minutes. I also cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup (instead of 3/4 cup for the half recipe). I decided to frost these with a cream cheese frosting instead of the lemon frosting listed here (because I had 4 oz. of cream cheese in the fridge to use up). The cake is moist,  dense, with a tender crumb. The cream cheese frosting put these over the top! Loved the dates in there too! Will make this one again! Thanks!

Just like banana bread. I didn't use topping as it didn't need it.  I substituted Oat flour and flax eggs, no nuts, for my vegan girls. They never had dates so it was good to see them enjoy this. It was super moist and yummy.

These came out great. I live at high altitude;  did not adjust and still worked.  I did use almond vs. vanilla extract and added a little extra of it as the almond tastes great.  I also used the coconut-covered date bars from Spouts Market vs. plain dates which added some extra flavor.  Icing was good as well; used almond extract there, too.

Always looking for a good bread / muffin recipe for ripe bananas so I don't have to throw them away -- this is a good one! We are watching our sugar intake, so I only used 1 cup of sugar and omitted the frosting. These were still wonderful! Hubby ate 1/4 of the pan in one sitting!

I just finished making this cake! Two pieces later....it's awesome! I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup Splenda brown sugar and 1/2 cup baking Splenda. I also used Eggbeaters in place of the eggs.

I'm gluten and milk free and still found this to be a great recipe.  I used gluten free flour and added 1/2 tsp of xanthum gum (not sure if it was really needed but did it just in case), used the olive oil instead of the butter as someone suggested, cut the sugar to one cup (1/2 white sugar, 1/2 coconut sugar) and added some grated coconut.  It came moist and delicious and I didn't even bother with the frosting.  I would definitely use this recipe again.

I made a few changes to this based on what I had in the kitchen. I used walnuts instead of almonds & used one mashed banana. Bar was sticky & good tasting. Icing could of used a bit more taste, but had good consistancy.
