I just tried this recipe out.  The cookies came out so good and buttery.  Delicious!  The cookies actually taste like the butter cookies that come in the danish blue tin at the gerocery store.

I made these delightful cookies for Christmas and have been baking them ever since! My family and friends love these cookies and have standing orders in - thankfully, they are easy to make! I roll my logs in colored sugar for a little extra sweetness.

This is a very easy cookie to make. My family loved them. I did add hazelnuts to the top of some and M & M's to the top of some. Great cookie for Santa.

This is a good recipe to use up extra egg yolks.  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, but I think I'll try using all butter next time because simple recipes require the best ingredients.  Initially I had some trouble slicing the slightly thawed logs that have been frozen.  However, the dough became less crumbly and sliced nicely after it thawed out a bit more.  I sprinkled some colored sugar sprinkles on top of each unbaked cookie to make them more attractive.  All in all, these were good cookies, and I will use the recipe again.

This recipe is better than the cookies in the blue tin from the grocery store! They are so easy and taste great! I froze them over night and cut them with a bread knife while frozen.  It worked great!  Roll them in colored sugar for the holidays!

Precisely what I was looking for. Excellent party cookie when rolled in multi colored sprinkles. To tint, add food coloring to butter mixture, it's hard to complete once the flour is added.

This is an awesome butter cookie recipe. I found it to have just a bit too much flour for mixing though, perhaps an 1/8 to 1/4 cup too much. Anyway, a variation could be to add 1/4 to 1/2 cup chopped nuts, an old neighbor of mine did this and they were wonderful too.

These are the best butter cookies I have ever had, and trust me when I say that I have had many. Also the scent coming from the oven is one I wish to bottle and sell to Glade. You will not regret these cookies unless of course you are calorie counting ;)

These cookies are GREAT, I love butter shortbread cookies and these were the closest to it. There were easy to make, put away the cookie presser. This is my #1 Butter Cookies.

I made these cookies with 2 cups of special medicine butter. It was very strong medicine. These cookies are so very delicious. They have an excellent texture like they came from the mall. Everyone should eat these cookies.

These were a wonderful cookie!  I rolled one log in colored sprinkles and they were gobbled up.  Two logs are in the freezer now.  I like the convenience of taking them out, slicing, and popping them in the oven.  Thank you!

These cookies somewhat like the Royal Dansk ones (the cookies in the blue tin), but the texture and taste is more like shortbread cookies.   This recipe is lacking that "butter" taste, but still decent.   If you want these cookies to be firm, refrigerate it for at least an hour.  I made a mistake of thinking it was firm, and my result was that the cookies were expanded.  Sorry if people are taking this the wrong way, but the Royal Dansk cookies are better. But if you want butter cookies that are soft, then go for this recipe!

I've been looking everywhere for a recipe that tastes like the Royal Dansk butter cookies... and this is not it. Maybe it's just me, but they just taste like sweetened flour. So.... royal dansk they are not (IMO)

These cookies taste great. My challenge was that I ended with a soft, gooey mess and even after an hour in the refrigerator, was not stiff enough to slice/bake. I ended with with tablespoon gobs of batter on the cookie sheet just so I can bake and taste them. I might try the recipe again just to make sure I didn't miss anything the first time. Thanks for submitting the recipe.

These are good but based on the reviews I expected them to taste like the store-bought refrigerator cookies. They taste more like Christmas cut-out cookies. I wanted chewy but these were very crisp. Good but not what I expected.

I looked around and tried a couple of different butter cookie recipes, most of them tasted like a sugar cookie except this one. This was the best butter cookie recipe I have ever tasted. When I opened the oven they smelled just like the cookies in the blue tin. When my husband tasted them he said "you found it"!

Our family loves almond so I substituted almond extract for the vanilla.  I also iced the cookies with almond butter icing.  Absolutely delicious!

This was a boring cookie. The taste was okay but if I make them again I would add peppermint extract or maybe almond to give it a little punch. They were just to blah but good with hot cocoa or coffee.

I was looking for a recipe that was similar to the blue tin cookies and this was delicious. Very similar. The only thing I did differently was used 2 whole eggs rather than 4 yolks. Saving this recipe!

For years, I have said the only thing that could those butter cookies in the tin better, was if they were softer. I have FINALLY found exactly that!! These turned out amazing. Followed the recipe to a T, they sliced perfectly (after being rolled in wax paper and refrigerated, as directed), kept their shape, and they taste great!! Reviewers keep in mind, if you're looking for the exact same thing you find in the tin, you'll probably be disappointed. They are much softer, with a bit of a lighter flavor, but still wonderful! Definitely a keeper, thanks so much for helping me finally find what I've been looking for!!

I made them exactly as the recipe said, rolled them and stored them in the refrigerator for several days. I cooked them for 5 minutes and they came out like thin wafers. Yummy but I don't know what I did wrong.

Don't have 4 egg yolks so I used 2 eggs instead and add a littled more flour. Turns out fine. I also add cocoa in half of the dough and tried to make black and white cookies...delicious cookies though the design was abit disasterous

They were okay but not what I was hoping for. Definitely too much flour and they just weren't like the cookies in the blue tin many of you are talking about..

OMG! These cookies are soooo good. I didn't do the log thing but they still came out awesome. I made these for a birthday party and everyone loved them. It was so easy, I can't wait to find excuse to make them again. I added this one to my recipe box. A++++

I was craving for those butter cookies that come in a tin but didn't want to go out all the way to buy them.  Then I found this recipe and it's definitely a keeper! It's easy, ive all the ingredients on hand and the cookies taste like those from the blue tin, just that mine weren't as crisp.

Yum! My 9 year old daughter was craving butter cookies and she made these almost completely by herself. They remind me of the butter cookies you buy in a tin during the holidays but so much better since they are homemade. Very convenient to make the dough and keep half frozen for the next time you are craving these cookies (and you will crave them!)

Turned out fine.....only problem.......I had to pipe them cause they did not freeze in 2 hours. The next day, after they were frozen, they were easy to slice.

The dough was easy to make. The flavor is smooth and buttery rich. Ten minutes was not an accurate time for my oven, 12-14 minutes at 1/4” thickness seemed right for a light golden brown edge.

With the original recipe...Thought it tasted too floury and not enough butter...So I made it again substituting the flour with Almond flour as well as adding a extra stick of butter...When I added the Vanilla extract I also added some butter extract and it brought the cookies to the next level making them all sorts of buttery goodness without the Almond flour taking over the taste...Everything came out very well all around...As you can see with what's left it was a hit

#1 These are BUTTER cookies, not sugar cookies. Different recipes, different flavors. If you're looking for a sugar cookie, this is NOT your recipe. Butter cookies should never be overly sweet (for the purists). Please don't make these with margarine or shortening. The results will not be the same as with butter. 


#2 If your dough is crumbly, you're probably adding too much flour. Spoon your flour into the measuring cup and don't pack when you level it.  Other possibilities include using small eggs, or even leaving out butter. As written, this recipe calls for 4 sticks of butter--a full pound. Also, flour can vary in the way it holds moisture, so watch your dough. Add it in portions and when the dough looks as though it's holding together well--firm, but not crumbly-- you have it.


#3 Watch your "log" size for quicker chilling. I made mine approximately 2" in diameter, in two separate logs. They were more than well-chilled in just over an hour, and I was able to leave one in the refrigerator while working with the other, then switched.  If you make short, fat logs, it's going to take a lot more time to chill. Use a thin-bladed knife if possible for cutting, cut the slices first, then place on your cookie sheet (or better yet, parchment, especially if you're not letting your sheets cool first).


#4 If you're looking for a cookie that tastes like the tinned versions, you may like changing out the vanilla for a half teaspoon (1/2 tsp) of almond extract, or even a combination

I didn't change a thing. I do have some notes. If you use a double bottom cookie sheet, then the cookies need to be cooked a lil longer. I cooked mine at 350 for about 14 minutes. I kept my cookie logs in the refrigerator for over 24 hours before slicing and baking.  These cookies are extremely delicious and exactly what I wanted. Thanks a bunch!

This is a spritz cookie recipe. They are uniformly an excellent cookie! For those who had trouble with crumbliness, please note that 2 cups is 4 sticks! I am pretty sure the errors are from not knowing the conversions.

I'm not a baker so I have to say this was a success. I read the reviews and decided to use 1/2 cup less flour, as many reviewers recommended.   I love to taste the buttery flavor of a butter cookie.  That's exactly how it turned out.  It's very easy to make. I keep a log of the cookie dough,wrapped  in wax paper, in the fridge.  When I want a little treat with a cup of coffee, I just cut a few slices off, place it on a small cookie sheet, and pop it into the toaster oven.  It's fast, easy, and delish.

Great recipe. I did a couple things to make it tastier. I used a little brown sugar in place of white (2T if the recipe is reduced 75%), I doubled the vanilla and almost doubled the salt. These are awesome. Next tome I'm going to put food coloring in them so they look like the ones I got at the store as a child. Very nostalgic. Thank you!

I did the recipe today and everyone loved them, except that I think I made them too tick so they tasted too bread like for me (I know that was my mistake) but I guess I was the only one who notice that.  they basically fought over them, LOL.

Ok, first off, my dough was crumbly!! It is suppose to be crumbly because we are making cookies people, not cake!!! So i rolled the dough in wax paper into a log and immediately cut into it, no refrigeration needed. I also had to turn my oven up to 400' degrees and cook the cookies for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges turned brown. My cookies were not soft and chewy but actually crunchy like school cookies. I dipped a fork in water then in sugar and pressed down onto the cookies to make indentations and leave the sugar on the unbaked cookies. The were A-O-K!!! I try and test every recipe that is in my recipe book on allrecipes.com and this one gets a B in my book, only because if you aren't a baker or at least a little familiar with baking then you can def mess this recipe up. Overall, AWESOME recipe!

I really liked these cookies!  I was looking for an easy way to make butter cookies at home -- wanted a recipe with a handful of ingredients you usually have on hand.  This is it.  And they tasted plenty buttery to me!  With a pound of butter, how could they not?   I also bought colored sprinkles to give them some color.  Mine didn't turn out round though.  The roll flattens on the bottom when they sit in the refrigerator.  Doesn't affect the taste of course.  I mainly make them for my mother (who's alway looking for something sweet and doesn't care if the cookie has a funny shape).  The last batch I made, I put the roll (didn't make a full batch) in the freezer and they were ready to cut and bake a lot sooner.  I'm going to see if I can find a way to keep the logs from flattening and then try to keep from flattening the log as I cut the cookies.  Like others have said -- a keeper.  I even put the list of ingredients in my phone so, while I'm at the store, I know whether I have to pick up an ingredient I'm
out of.  If a cake that takes a pound of butter is a pound cake, then this must be a recipe for Pound Cookies!  Call them what you want, they're great.

this was an easy dough to work with through a cookie press with no need to chill.  I did have to add more vanilla and also added a bit of butter extract in order to add to the flavor.  This is not a sweet cookie so colored sugar is a nice addition without being overwhelmingly sweet.  I did some with 2 clicks of the press per cookie and some with 1 click.  I preferred the flavor of those that were a slightly browner color around the edges; it gave them a more buttery flavor.

My brother requested that I make cookies that taste just like these one Christmas butter cookies my parents would buy when we were little so I made these. He said they tasted just like them so I was verrrrry happy. Also, I had the Royal Dansk kind the day before I made these and they are pretty similar! I do everything the same except I trade the half cup of white sugar for brown sugar to add more flavor. I coated the top of the cookies in red and green sugar sprinkles for the holiday season. I also have made a powdered sugar/butter/whipping cream glaze for them. It's nice to make a simple tasting cookie for a change. My mom LOVES these and always requests me to make them. I would suggest dipping them in sugar or sprinkles otherwise they might be a bit boring. These are great with tea!

These are the best butter cookies I've ever made/ate. I was short on butter so instead of butter I used butter flavored shortening. Yummy!

delicious cookies! absolutely like what others said, taste like the danish butter cookies that came in blue tin. However, i have difficulty to roll them into a log though as the batter was very smooth. Not sure if this is because i overmixed the butter and sugar. so i just put in the parchment paper and roll it bit by bit and ended up in square. i refrigerate it for a day. but it melted quite fast after i took it out to slice, so i have to continuously keep it in refrigerator while waiting for the batches baked in the oven. maybe it's because i live in Malaysia (a hot and humid country). I wonder if anyone have advice on how to make it look nice as im thinking of giving this away as a give. can i pipe it out? Thanks SAMM for a great cookie recipe!

I give them a 4star because I am not sure if I did something wrong. After combining the flour with the butter mixture, the mix was crumbly. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be like this, so I added a little buttermilk to make it stick together. They were pretty good though. If anyone can tell me if the mix is supposed to be crumbly, please do let me know.
