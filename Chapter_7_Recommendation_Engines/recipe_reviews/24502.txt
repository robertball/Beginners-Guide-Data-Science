Excellent! Quick little cheat tip on sauce? If you are pressed for time like I always am, buy a jar of chicken gravy. Heat it up.  Mix a few teaspoons of soy sauce with it.  Nobody will know the difference! :o)

Figured out how to make nice patties! Mix your cooked veggies and shrimp in with eggs mixture and then drop into the pan! I was able to get nice brown patties. I also used the chicken gravy & soy sauce trick! I am too impressed with myself!

Very authentic and really tasty.  I did add soy sauce to the egg mixture and I substituted ham for the shrimp.  It was a very simple yet excellent meal.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is my husband's absolute favorite dish when going out for Chinese and this recipe is the real deal!!!  We followed the recipe but chose imitation crab instead of the shrimp and omitted the salt.  We decided to make one big pancake and flipped it over into another skillet.  We also used the super easy sauce using 1  1/2 c. chicken broth, 2 Tbl. corn starch, 2 Tbl lite soy and a pinch of sugar.  Never would have dreamed this dish could be so easy, but I will DEFINITELY MAKE THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!

This was an excellent egg foo yung.  I only used a sprinkle of salt instead of the whole teaspoon, and it was plenty salty for us.  Next time I would totally omit the salt, and perhaps sub some light soy sauce for some of the real.  Very Yummy!!!

This was so easy to make, but I can't figure out how to end up with a nice patty like the restaurant.  Mine falls apart easily.  Also, I need the gravy recipe to compete the meal.

Not bad! A good tip to make really nice patties is to mix the veggies w/ the egg and spoon onto a pan on low-med heat. Do not touch them for a minute or two and then flip. They should come out perfectly golden brown and in one piece!

We really enjoyed this.  I used 3 eggs and 1/2 cup of egg whites.  Next time I will add more bean sprouts.  I also used jarred chicken gravey with light soy sauce.  Served with white rice and egg rolls.  Thanks Sal!

I tweaked the recipe a bit with the vegetables, omitting bean sprouts and adding mushrooms and water chesnuts.  My first attempt at egg foo young (which is my personal standard order when we order chinese) and it was delicious!  For the gravy we just mixed a jar of chicken gravy with a little bit of soy sauce.

This is the second time I've made it--love it!  It is easy, has nice veggies in it, and I can tweak it so that it's wheat-free by skipping the soy sauce.  This is the best new recipe I've tried in the last few months, and the only one I really want to keep in my repertoire.  For my taste, a tiny bit less salt (along with no soy sauce) was salty enough for me.  Thanks!

Very easy and good recipe. I omitted the salt because of the soy sauce. After quick cooking the veges I added them to the beaten eggs then made my patties. Used the chicken gravy and soy sauce for the foo young gravy and turned out great, definitely a keeper!

I made a few changes like not adding soy sauce when frying the veggies,  I used imitation crab meat instead of shrimp.  I beat the eggs and added the veggie mixture to the eggs, then poured into lightly oiled pan.  Used can chicken gravy with some soy sauce.  Deliciious !

Delicious! We reduced the salt from 1 teaspoon to 1/4 teaspoon.  After we sautéd the vegetables as instructed, we let them cool a bit and then added them to the bowl of beaten eggs (we also added the soy sauce here, since we had forgotten to put it in).  We made patties using 1/2 cup of mixture poured into 4 inch egg rings, flipping after the bottom had browned.  The taste is just like you get in a restaurant!  For sauce, we followed advice from other reviews and combined one 16 oz. can of chicken gravy with about two teaspoons of soy sauce and heated it on the stove.  We then added 1/8 cup of milk because the flavor seemed too strong, but that might have just been the brand we used.  My family felt the sauce also went well with the steamed veggies and white rice we had with the meal.  Four out of four household members voted to make this again! ;)

This was an easy recipe, which I love.  On the advice of another reviewer, I used chicken gravy with some soy sauce added.  My son, who hates most vegetables, really liked this dish.

Instead of cooking sprouts, sauté onions & celery and pour over bean sprouts in a bowl. Let rest for 10 minutes- perfect time to heat oil and scramble eggs. Sprouts will loosen up but stay crisp enough for awesome texture and flavor :0)
