A good basic pizza sauce. Much better than store bought! The olive oil really adds a nice flavor. The only I suggest is adding some salt to really make the flavors pop.  Be forewarned that this will make a mess on your stove. Now's the time to break out the splatter guard! :) I did as suggested and quickly pulsed the diced tomatoes in my Ninja before adding to the pot. Worked perfectly!

Excellent balance of herbs and tomatoes, adding olive oil at ends gives great flavor.

Try substituting the red pepper flakes with a one inch chunk of pepperoni quartered, and substitute the brown sugar with an ounce of Chianti or Cabernet Sauvignon wine.

We just returned from an extensive trip to Italy and we were on the hunt for a pizza sauce that is similar to the typical sauce on the pizzas in Italy.  This is it!  I used Cento (Italian brand) tomato puree and didn't change any of the ingredients.  It is perfect.  Thank you!

This was delicious and easy.  I didn't have puree so I threw slightly drained canned diced tomatoes and all other ingredients (including the oil) into a blender for a few minutes before transferring them to a pot.  Because I have fresh herbs in my garden right now, I threw fresh basil and oregano in the blender with everything too and it was just wonderful.  My children thought it was the best!
