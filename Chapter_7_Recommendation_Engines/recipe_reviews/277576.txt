I served this last night at our small Christmas party.  I used a four-pound roast, thinking we'd have leftovers,  but the whole thing got eaten, right down to the last potato.  Definitely a keeper.  The only change I'd make is that I'd cook it a bit less next time -- it was lovely and juicy when we first sliced it but by the time we got around to seconds it was a bit dry.  I'll take it out of the oven at 140 degrees next time.

A great recipe and wonderful flavor. The only real adjustment I would recommend is toy around with the amount of honey in the mixture. I found that, with the called for amount  of honey, the paste was a bit too thick to get good coverage. Thin it out a bit more with extra honey and don't be afraid to use your hands to get good coverage. It's messy, but well worth it.

Very tasty way to cook pork loin. You would not find this in Morocco though as it is a Muslim country.....

I'm definitely making this again! It was delicious! 

I did have a problem with the rub not... rubbing. I think that was a Me problem more than a recipe problem. My place is a little drafty and I think the honey started solidifying so the rub was more of a sticky paste that I couldn't spread very well.

Impossible to spread the “paste” over the meat.

I enjoyed this, but the rest of the family was split 50/50...(thus the 4).  The Moroccan spices are heavy and you if you don't enjoy that, then this one may not be for you.  But if you do, (like I do) you will enjoy it.

Delicious. Easy. I didn't have the right kind of pork apparently....not all 'pork loin roasts' are created equal. Mine was bone in, and so it took a bit longer but was jist as delicious. I subbed Shishito peppers for  Anaheim and gave my veggies a little scoop of minced garlic before tossing them in for their fifteen minutes... mostly because I forgot about the mint and garlic sauce! I also increased the spice amounts to a tablespoon for every teaspoon because altitude really dulls down flavor alot of the time. Everyone loved it and is begging me to make it again.....which I will.

Amazing! The recipe works as written, right down to the cooking time. Don't forget the sauce.

Really delicious! Great recipe. My young kids weren't fond of the flavors, but the adults at the table loved it.
