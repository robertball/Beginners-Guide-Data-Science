I was running low on sour cream, I used half mayonnaise. The sour cream and mayonnaise I used was reduced fat. I made no other changes. VERY good.

We thought it was great!  We even used non fat sour creme and it had excellent flavor.  Dill can tend to be overpowering but with the dijon mustard mixed in it gave it a little kick!  We had it on chicken with asparagus and then even used it on our baked potatoes!  Thanks!

Excellent.  Very quick and tasty with fish and vegetables.  We used low fat sour cream and I added just a touch of sugar.  We served it on Mother's Day with grilled salmon, she loved it!

Looking at the recipe it seemed like it called for an overload of mustard.  Sure glad I ended up using the full amount. This was delicious.  If I were to change anything it would only be to season it with salt and pepper.

This is a tasty, tangy dip. I enjoyed it with the salmon patties I made, but it would be good with a tray of crudites, too. I had to substitute Creole mustard, so I my dip had a bit more zip, but I still enjoyed it. I think that fresh dill is very important for this recipe, because I've made it with dried and the flavor just falls flat; it's easy to keep a patch of dill growing in your garden, on your patio, or even as a houseplant in a sunny window so you can have fresh dill whenever you want it!

I did not care for this sauce.  I should have read the previous reviews before trying this recipe.  As many other reviewers noted, the flavors are not quite balanced.  I thought the combination of sour cream and lemon made it too tart.  I had to add some sugar and mayonnaise to tone down the tartness.  I probably would not add so much mustard if I had to make this again.

Excellent - used dry dill, dried mustard and low fat sour cream.  Careful when making because if you taste it when you make it, it doesn't taste like much.  Once its chilled a while the flavors really come out.

Outstanding, yet very easy recipe. Added a touch more dill and a couple pinches of fine ground Chipotle pepper. Actually thinned leftovers and used for a dressing the next day. Excellent!
Thanks Lisa

Too much dijon for me, but I did like it. I just made it for my leftover salmon. Whipped it up before the reheated fish was even cold. Very yummy, but needs less mustard

Good sauce made with ingredients I had on hand.  I used much more fresh dill though, somewhere around 1/4 cup and it was great on our trout tonight.  Thanks!

Both my husband and my 14 month old loved this sauce! This went perfectly over baked salmon fillets.  We wound up spooning the leftover sauce over steamed baby carrots and green beans. I took a chance with a spicy brown mustard and it was wonderful.  Thank you!

This is great with grilled salmon.  Definitely don't go by what it tastes like before it chills...it needs fridge time to bring out all of the flavors.  I have to make this every time I make any kind of grilled or baked fish.  We love it.

very nice dill sauce. Because I was only making for two people I sclaed it down a bit. I also added a little mayonnaise because it seemed to be something and I also added teeny pinch of sugar. I mixed it well and let it marinate overnight. This goes well with grilled salmon or any fish dish.

This was really tasty.  I subbed NF yogurt for 1/2 of the sour cream and whole grain mustard for dijon.  It was great!  I found this just before serving salmon fishcakes (Nigella Lawson) so didn't have time to let it chill as directed.  After dinner, I tasted the sauce again.  It was definitely better for the sitting time.  I'll be sure to make it ahead next time so the flavors can meld before serving.

I made this to serve over "Spicy Tuna Fish Cakes" from here at AllRecipes.  I found the flavor to be a little too strong on the sour cream side, so I added a couple Tbs of mayonnaise and a little kosher salt.  I didn't have any fresh dill, so I used dried dill and let the mixture sit in the fridge for about 45 minutes so the dill could rehydrate and the flavors could marry.  I think next time I'll also add a bit of zest from the lemon in addition to the juice.  I'm anxious to try this sauce on salmon!

Wonderfully Easy and delicious!  I add a bit of mayo with the Sourcream.  This is our new staple with grilled salmon filets!

Whipped this up with dried dill since it was all I had. I made it to go with some basic baked Tilapia, but it's so good, my mind is spinning with all the stuff I could put it on and in.

This was so good! I always try the recipe word for word for an honest review before making adjustments, this time was no different. It doesn't need any changes. On it's own the sauce does taste strong and maybe to 'mustardy', but baked on salmon (which is how I prepared it) it was fantastic. True crowd pleaser. Very creamy and subtle. Definite keeper. I finally found the perfect dill sauce!

I made this for the first time tonight to go over salmon. I feel the mustard overpowers the taste of the dill. I might make this again minus the mustard.

This sauce goes very well with salmon. When it tried it by itself, it didn't taste like anything special, but it was a nice addition to my baked salmon.

Very simple, eggless, and GREAT on grilled salmon.  My little kids loved it plain!  I will definately make this again and again.  (I used dried ground mustard seed instead of prepared mustard.)

I was fixing Salmon for dinner and my son suggested I try Dill Sauce with it, so I looked up this recipe and thought it added a nice touch and was very good for a change.  I didn't have Dijon mustard so I used Deli style and didn't have fresh dill so added 3/4 tsp. dry.  Will have this again.  Thanks!

I'm not really a big fan of dill sauce, but I was making salmon patties and found this sauce.  Everyone raved over it and kept asking me what I put in it.  I actually liked it myself and it went wonderfully with the salmon.  Definitely a keeper!

Been using this recipe for years now, and decided to write a review because my husband and I can't eat salmon without it anymore. So easy, so good. A couple times I have had to use regular mustard in place of Dijon and it still turns out great. I'm usually cooking for 2, and recipe is easily halved so that we don't have too much left over.

This is a great sauce! I also added mayonnaise and upped the amount of dill. When I poach the fish I also add some of the poaching liquid to the sauce to thin it out a little bit. Adds flavour, too!

This is a great dip/sauce to have on hand. I eat lots of salmon and I love a good dill sauce with a baked filet. I made the recipe as written, but I think I added more dill, dijon, and green onion to help cut the sour cream taste. I love sour cream, but everyone in my family doesn't, so I tried to mask it as much as possible for their sake.  I also took some to work with me to dip my Triscuits in.Would work also as a veggie dip. Thank you for sharing!

I truly enjoyed this Sauce with my Salmon - I think it would be good with other preparations as well - Baked Potato?  I had to use dried dill (less than fresh called for) and I still enjoyed.  Thanks for the recipe !

Served it with pork tenderloin that had been marinaded in olive oil, lite soy sauce, paprika, and chives.  Divine!  I think it will go great with chicken too and intend to try it soon.  Don't be afraid to try this one on other meats.

Great sauce for salmon.  I think it best to chill at least an hour beforehand to get the flavors to mix, especially the dill and lemon.

This is pretty good. It would probably be better if I had a better-tasting Dijon. I might make this again sometime with a better Dijon; this is far, far better than tartar sauce for sure! Thanks for the recipe :)

I thought this was fantastic-I think I will start cooking fish more just so I have an excuse to make this sauce.  Fabulous!

Yummy!  I added a little garlic to this because I was serving it with garlic salmon.  It was terrific.

What I like about this recipe is the ease and flexibility in preparation.  Taking other reviewers' comments under consideration, I reduced the mustard slightly; added more dill, a teaspoon of sugar, and some ground crushed red pepper.  I also refrigerated it for several hours.  It made a marvelous dip for spinach-artichoke wontons or "bites." It was a hit with everyone!

Loved it! This was a perfect condiment to go with our salmon patties. I've never been known to eat any fish without malt vinegar/lemon and tons of ketchup but I actually preferred this sauce to my usual favored ketchup. Thanks, this was delicious and I will be making this again.

Nice combo of flavors! I used half sour cream, half lite mayo, added salt and pepper and a dash of cayenne. I prefer lots of lemon in everything so I increased that and used fresh dill. Served it on top of salmon patties..yum! This sauce would be great on grilled salmon or shrimp, maybe even chicken too. Will keep this one in the recipe box!

I think I'd only make this again if I need some sauce for fish and the recipe's ingredients are all that I have in the house.  I used reduced-fat sour cream, don't know if that had something to do with it but, as many have commented here, it's difficult to balance out the flavors.  Maybe practice might make perfect but I can't be bothered--it was just too blah.  

Following the recipe I had to add less than a teaspoon of sugar to reduce the tartness.  I used the recommended amount of dill but this didn't add enough flavor yet if I had used as much dill as I might have needed for a strong dill flavor it would have proably made the sauce green! Bottom line:  edible, but definitely not memorable.

I read the reviews and let the flavors marry for 12 hours, tasted and I thought the recipe was too tart for my taste buds.  I did as one suggested & added 1 tsp sugar and that did the trick.
Yummy.

Tasted too much like mustard.  I had to add the entire container of sour cream to tone down the mustard taste. Once I got the ingredients right, I thought it was really good.  The whole family still didn't like it...too mustardy.

Used this with garlic salmon from this site and while it was too tangy for my taste, my husband could not stop raving about it the entire meal.  In fact, he loved that I didn't like it bc that just meant more for him!

I made this sauce for serving with smoked salmon. Didn't have mustard on hand so used finely chopped capers instead. This made it a bit tart so I added a little white sugar for balance. Everyone said it worked well with the salmon.

I added a little mayo and used dried dill because I didn't have fresh. This reminded me a lot of a sauce my grandma use to make for salmon when I was a kid.  However, she would peel and de-seed a cucumber, chop it into small pieces and add it with the sauce.  I didn't do that this time because I wanted to see how the original turned out, but I am going to add the cucumber in next time out of nostalgia.

Have been making this recipe for years.  It is super easy and tastes wonderful  whether on fish or meat or even chicken.   I did make a tiny change this time, just to see if it would work -- I added 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and the flavor was kicked up a few notches.  We just loved it.

Delicious!  I did make some changes though...replaced half the sour cream with mayo, mustard powder instead of prepared mustard, some puréed garlic and some lemon juice.  Perfect side for salmon!

Delicious!!  I have made this sauce twice now and my husband and I love it!  I tend not to have fresh dill on hand, so I use 1 tsp of the dried dill.  Other than that, I follow the recipe as stated and it turns out great.  We use this recipe to pair with the recipe "salmon with lemon and dill" by Michelle Ramey and it goes perfectly.  Another plus, you don't have to make it hours ahead of time for the flavors to meld.  I make the sauce - set it in the fridge - then move on to making the fish - and in just a short bit of time, the sauce has a great flavor.

My 12 year old daughter was inspired by this recipe. I make the Salmon and she makes this sauce. She follows the basic instructions every time, but tweaks it a little without allowing me to see what she does . It always turns out perfect! and complements the salmon so well. I don't know how she does it.

This sauce was delicious with salmon. A bit overpowering with veggies for me but I mixed in my rice and it blended well.  This one is a keeper, and I will make again...with my salmon. Thanks for sharing!

Will definitely make again.

Just a little heavy on the Dijon mustard for me, but this couldn't be easier to make.  I'd  cut the Dijon in half in the future.  Also, a little salt & pepper wouldn't hurt either.  Had this today on Mom's Salmon Mousse on this site.

Followed the recipe as written and felt it was to string of mustard. I toned it down with some Marzetti's dill dip. Next time I will cut the mustard in half. Very good when served with salmon.

Everyone always loves this sauce - we make it for the cedar plank salmon recipe (also on allrecipes.com).  It's fantastic & so easy.  I actually increase the dill, but you can add as much as your preference

I liked it. Used less mustard though. Served it with this salmon: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Garlic-and-Dill-Salmon/Detail.aspx  I really liked it and will definitely keep the recipe.

This was a wonderful sauce. I used this with the salmon loaf I prepared from this site. My teenage son really liked both recipes as well. I didn't add as much mustard and increased the lemon juice. MMM Good.

I made this recipe as written but found it too tart for my taste and so gradually added a little sugar until it was perfect.  Thanks Lisa

I've made this many times and it's always a big hit. I've used fat free and lite sour cream, fresh and dried dill and it always comes out great. Although, when using dried dill, it helps to let it sit so the flavors can meld. We never eat salmon anymore w/o this versatile sauce. LOVE IT!!

This went over better than I expected.  I used it on some smoked salmon at a company pot-luck.  I did not veer from the recipe.  After it chilled and let the flavors get happy (lol), it was very good and made an excellent choice to go w/the fish.  I can see how this would be good on veggies and maybe even chips.   Very good recipe.  Very good.

I used fat free sour cream and this came out great! Even though it seemed a bit sharp when I tasted it by itself, once I put it on salmon it was absolutely wonderful. This one makes it to my recipe file!

Maybe it was because I put this on flounder instead of salmon, but I found it to be very bland.  I had to add some lemon pepper and garlic to the sauce in order for it to have any flavor at all.

Very, very good. I used dry dill weed and it was delicious! Thank you for a great alternative to tartar sauce!
