I felt these needed a bit more sugar so I sprinkled powdered sugar on them as I ate them. My blueberries which I had previously flash frozen were very sweet. The recipe called for plenty of blueberries so there was at least one in every bite which made the muffins a bit sweeter. The recipe does not tell you how far to fill the liners so I went with 3/4's of the way. I wound up with 16 muffins that were quite small since they did not rise very much. Next time I will fill to the top. Thank you for the recipe.

Something went wrong! I got 22 muffins out of this recipe but they did not  turn into muffins.  Was I supposed to make a flour out of the oatmeal?  I ended up scraping the filling out of the liners and using it as breakfast cereal!  What a waste of time and a mess.??

I liked this! Very simple, great for a quick breakfast, or snack. And my toddler loves them!
I was a little disappointed about them sticking to the paper (picture provided). Next time Iâ€™ll just spray the cups with Pam...
