I did a website search for Cracker Barrel's coke cake and came up with several recipes very similar to this...the one I made is this recipe without the sour cream all other ingreds. same amount. Another diff. is it said to bake in a sheet pan (12x18) for 25min. Frosting is same. This was pretty good, not chocolatey like at Cracker barrel. The coke flavor is subtle, my family ate it, they like it well enough but I dont think I'll make again. Mine cooked fine in 25 min in a 12x18pan.

What did I do wrong?  I made it according to recipe.  When it came time to bake it, it says 30-40 minutes.  I  kept on checking it and it wasn't done.  Finally after 48-50 minutes I took it out, put the frosting on and waited for it to cool.  YUCK that wasn't like a brownie it was like dough.

Okay, what did I do wrong. Cake came out of the oven done, nice and high. Made frosting and poured over cake; cake fell and has the appearance of a dense brownie. Tastes great, rich, with cola undetone. Just looks different, strange. Help
