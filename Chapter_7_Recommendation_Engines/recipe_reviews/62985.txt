So fast and so easy. I loved this recipe, as did the "FUSSY" people in my household who won't eat macaroni salads because of the "too crunchy" onion, green pepper or celery, found in most macaroni salad recipes. I used drained canned chicken... delicious! Think I may add a few chopped hard boiled eggs next time. And for those (like me) who like onion, green pepper or celery in their Macaroni salad, it can always be added to this recipe. Cooking for "FUSSY" eaters can be a challange... thanks, Joslyn, for a great recipe.

Making just a couple common sense adjustments to suit our preferences - reducing the mayo to about a cup and using thawed frozen baby peas and fresh chopped scallions instead of the canned peas/onions - this was pretty tasty.  It was even better after adding a teaspoon of dijon mustard and a little chopped fresh dill.  I can definitely see myself making this again. Thanks!

I used this recipe as a guideline to making "Plain" Macaroni Salad. I made a few changes and omitted the salmon, so all in all it was pretty good. Maybe would be better if I followed the recipe. Thanks!!

Way too much may. Frozen peas might make it pallatable...I wouldnt waste your time on this one though.
