Unfortunately this wasn't a hit in my family.  It tasted like it should have been a topping for nachos and not a meal.  :(

Made for dinner tonight and loved it! Hubby ate it as well. :) I added a can of Bush's Grillin' Beans: Black Bean Fiesta and left out the onions and garlic (didn't have any). A tad bit bland but did have flavor. Will make again! Served with warmed flour tortillas. Leftovers tomorrow will be Nacho style! Makes a lot (serves more than 6)!

Very good but I added rice and taco sauce because of the other reviews that I had seen saying it wasn't casserole enough. Added 2 cups of slighty undercooked white rice and served it on warm tortillas it was a hit :)

Had Rotel and salsa on hand but just regular corn.  I always have frozen onions and peppers for cooking on the fly so I used a cup of that rather than the onion in the recipe. We both enjoyed it. After reading the reviews we just served it in a bowl, not unlike chili or hamburger helper in the consistency. Hubby said it was worth a repeat. May try the black bean idea I saw in one of the reviews.  May try a few jalapenos next time. I think this is gonna be on our "comfort food" list.

I wasn't crazy about this but I am giving it 4 stars because the rest of the family liked it. I was expecting it to be firmer..............like a casserole that you can cut out of the pan but instead it had to be spooned out. I made it into burrito filling and put it in warmed flour tortillas.

We are on a low carb diet so I substituted a 7 oz can of green chilis for the corn.  I used several spices while browning the ground beef, chili powder,  hot chili flakes, cumin, seasoning salt, etc.  I forgot to put in the salsa but I used a 14 1/2 oz can of crushed tomatoes with cilantro and lime juice so it came out really good. The family liked it a lot and I would make it again.

I made exactly as directed and the family loved it. My husband added hot sauce - this recipe is great in that you can add ingredients to your taste. It's a keeper!

We had this for dinner last night and my hunny loved it. We served it as is with cornbread on the side. It had a little heat but not over the top. We really enjoyed it the first time and he enjoyed it as left overs today. I made exactly as state except I added 11 oz of mexican corn instead of 7oz. mostly just because my store didn't carry the smaller cans.
