What a terrific way to use left over mashies.  A good basic recipe as is, but, you can easily 'doctor' it up a bit.  I ended up adding fresh parsley, a teaspoon of chix bouillion, extra onion, extra mashies, grated some cheese into it and added bacon.  You could really add about anything to suit your families tastes.

I agree with the other reviewers - a great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes!  I tried as written first and found it too be a little thin so I added an extra 1/2 cup mashed potatoes.  I tasted it again and found it to be slightly bland...so I added a small envelope of low salt chicken bouillon.  It was awesome.  I garnished it with grated cheese and bacon pieces but it is super good on it's own.  Don't omit the celery salt...it needs it.  The soup is hearty and filling.  Kid friendly too as my toddler ate it up and so did my teenagers.  Thanks for the recipe!  Here's a tip:  Using a whisk is a must - to make your soup smooth and to make sure the milk doesn't burn on the bottom while heating it up.

Could not be easier!!  Tasted good, but a little bland for our taste.  I made sure I made it exactly as written before I added anything that anyone else suggested.  We certainly could eat it this way, but you can also make it into a loaded mashed potato soup quickly and easily, by adding cheese and bacon.  I look forward to using my leftover mashed potatoes this way and playing with the taste too.  There is nothing better than a good basic recipe that you can change to suit your family!! Especially when it is this easy to make. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was delicious and easy.  I increased the onion a little and cut the amount of milk back to 1 1/2 cups. I also added a stalk of sliced celery and a clove of pressed garlic.  I sauted the celery and garlic with the onion. My husband loved it!

Very good! Great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes. I used minced garlic instead of onion and added some chicken bouillon. Then, I put some shredded cheddar on top right before serving. Mmmm!

This is a great base recipe. I would never have thought just to thin out my mashed potatoes with milk to make a soup. But this is awesome. This is one of those recipes where measurements don't matter. You have to make this to taste. Everyone likes different amounts of salt, butter, whether or not to add sour cream, bacon bits, cheese, etc. For our families taste I did add all 3 of the previous things. I added sour cream to the soup in the pan and the cheese and bacon bits on the top when serving. It was amazing!! I did add rosemary to my mashed potatoes when I initially made them and it was still great in the soup. Even if your potatoes weren't good to start with I think you could really doctor them up when making the soup. I highly recommend this recipe. I will probably be making bigger batches of mashed potatoes just to make the soup a couple nights later.

This recipe is only as good as your mashed (or loaded smashed) potatoes.  If they're good, this is WONDERFUL. To those that find it bland, I recommend salt and pepper to taste. Or make better mashed potatoes.  ;-)  Actually - one tip for the reviewer who found it watery - that also could've been your potatoes, their moisture content varies, after all.

THANK YOU SO MUCH! This is now, officially, my favorite recipe ever. It tasted just wonderful, my girls ate it up and they are really picky eaters. I have always thrown out mashed potatoes the next day and hated wasting the food. But now I have this recipe! I did use 2 cups of mashed potatoes instead of 1 1/2, but mine were very creamy to start.

I'm so glad to have found this recipe - what a great use for leftover mashed potatoes.  This recipe is good, but I thought it needed a little extra something, so I added a sprinkle of real bacon bits and sharp cheddar cheese.  Thanks.

This was really good. I sauteed garlic, celery & onion til al dente (I like the crunch) added some water & low sodium chicken powder. Less milk because I like it pretty thick. Yum, this is a great way to use up leftover mashed taters!

It is perhaps unfair for me to review this recipe because I used it as a base for a one-pot dinner meal.  

I sauteed 1/2 large onion, 2 stalks of celery, 1 large thinly sliced carrot, about 8 oz of sliced mushrooms, and 3 crushed cloves of garlic in butter prior to adding in milk, mashed potatoes, and the remaining ingredients.  I had to adjust the seasonings a bit, as well as the amount of milk (I think I used about 2.5 cups), but the soup came out really tasty, and the celery and carrots added what I thought was a much needed crunch.  

I also diced up some cooked chicken and threw it in last minute to warm up, but it didn't add too much to the taste of the soup.  I would have been better off making it into a sandwich.

Excellent and so easy!  Have a ton of leftover mashed from Thanksgiving.  I did double the recipe (to feed more than 3) but added an extra cup of mashed.  I started by fine chopping 2 celery stalks I had to use up (so skipped th celery salt) with a chopped onion and 3 cloves of garlic (we love garlic) and sauted with olive oil in a soup pot until softened.  I added the potatoes, milk, salt, pepper and 2 packets of chicken bouillion, warmed it up and it was ready.  I didn't like that it was lumpy (maybe because my potatoes were so cold to start?) so I popped in my immersion blender to the pot and gave it a blending.  There were still some bits of celery and potatoes but not as lumpy.  This was so quick and easy.  I did eat about 1/3 of a bowl and loved it.  I then added some shredded cheese to the bowl and stirred.  I must say, even though I am not a big cheese fan, that the cheese raised it up a notch and it was quite delicious.  Two thumbs up from both my picky and non-picky sons.  Will definitely make again and share the recipe with all of my relatives.  A great recipe with little effort.  Thanks!!

Loved this! I followed the recipe loosely by adding celery, carrots, curry powder to taste, onion salt instead of celery salt (had none!), and a cup of chicken broth. It was sooooo good!

Honestly-I can't believe how good and simple this is! Instead of milk I added chicken broth to thin the mashed potatoes. Added leftover skillet corn with bacon and a bag of frozen veggies. The kicker is to add shredded leftover turkey for an outstanding soup that has a fabulous taste. I bet you can't have just one bowl!!!

Good base for a "clean out your fridge" kind of soup. I added a couple cloves of minced garlic and used chopped celery instead of celery salt. Because my mashed potatoes had both sour cream and butter in them (Sour Cream and Chive Mashed Potatoes), I really didn't need THAT much milk. Just a little. I did use one can of FF/no MSG organic chicken broth and threw in about a cup of leftover shredded sharp cheddar we had leftover from last night. Great for a rainy day like today and made enough for me to have for lunch for a couple days. SUPER cost effective and a great way to use up leftovers! EDITED: The next day, I pureed the soup in my blender, then reheated. I liked the pureed soup much better.

A delicious way to use leftover mashed potatoes...I made the soup extra rich by adding some sour cream.  No chives now that the summer garden is gone, so I used green onion in the soup and for the garnish.  Also french fried onions to add some crunch.

I loved this! I don't have/like celery salt so I just added a little kosher salt and then topped with shredded cheddar and fresh green onions. A GREAT way to use up leftover mashed taters! This'll be a hit after thanksgiving when we're all sick of turkey!

Very good! I wanted something creamy and cheesy for lunch, and I happened to have left over mashed potatoes in the fridge. I added some cheddar and a little garlic along with some parsley. next time I think I'll add some bacon.

This has become one of my family's faves. Thanks for sharing the recipe. I did find it a little thin the first time when I made it as directed. When I added a few more potatoes, it was perfect. Thanks again.

This recipe gave me just the inspiration I needed to use leftover mashed potatoes, rotisierie (sp?) chicken and grilled pork loin chops.  I subsituted and/or added a few things I had on hand such as leeks for onions, added leftover chicken and pork chops cut into 1/2" chunks, diced celery and fresh corn right off the cob.  Plus, stock was made from the chicken carcass and used to enhance the richness of the base along with the milk and butter.  I, also, peeled and chopped a few potatoes into 1/2" chunks then sauteed the veggies lightly in olive oil, added enough stock to cover then combined all the ingredients with the mashed potatoes in a stock pot and let simmer with just a splash of rice wine vinegar for brightness.  The stock was made with a few whole pieces of celery and onion then added in some fresh herbs (bay leaf, rosemary, sage) as well as a few flakes of dried red pepper.  My husband loved it, and the fresh corn cut off the cob added a wonderful sweet "pop" as you ate.  (Yes, corn and potatoes are both starches, but the combo works.)

This is the first time I have reviewed a recipe but I just HAD to with this one. I had a huge amount of mashies left from Tksgiving.  My son is a Cordon Blue chef grad. and asked to me find a recipe for using them in soup. This one was so simple even I could do it.  He added some free range leftover chicken broth to the pot. Oh my goodness!  FABULOUS!! Hot and comforting and flavorful! I am going to make mashies tomorrow just to make this soup again!

All Recipes to the rescue.  Needed potato soup for diet purpose.  No potatoes in house but used instant potatoes.  Turned out great.  Will make again.  I used Carnation fat free.

This is a great way to use up left over mashed potatoes.  I added more potatoes than it called for because I wanted my soup to be a little thicker than it turned out.

This did not suit my tastes.  It was very thin and bland.  It would need lots of adjustments for me to make it again.

What a great way to use up a heap of Thanksgiving leftovers! I scaled the recipe up to 6 servings and sauteed 1 small onion and 1 tablespoon of minced garlic in about 4 tablespoons of butter. I then added 1 can of chicken broth, 4+ cups of mashed potatoes (mashed with sour cream, onion and chive cream cheese, butter, salt, pepper, ect.) and enough milk to thin it out. Once it was heated through I tossed in my chopped leftover turkey and a can of corn. Seasoned with salt, pepper, chives and celery seed (didn't have any celery salt on hand). Ended up with a tasty chowder and cleared out my fridge!

This was OK.  Not a lot of flavor, even though I added some garlic with the onion and served with shredded Cheddar cheese and bacon.  I doubled the recipe to 6 servings but even holding back the milk to 3 cups I thought it was too thin.

This is a great simple recipe!! I had leftover mashed taters and looked on here for ideas. I cut my onions in thick pieces to give texture and I did not thoroughly sauté them so there was an extras little crunch and texture in the soup. You can add ½ and ½ instead of milk and it is wonderfully creamy.  Top with pepper jack cheese and bacon makes it wonderful with a zing!

This is a good base soup as others have said, but I had to add more than 1 1/2 cups mashed potatoes to make it the consistency that I wanted.  Also I used a whole onion, celery seed instead of celery salt. I added salt and pepper to taste..didn't measure.  If I had cheddar cheese I would of topped it off with that. Chopped bacon would of been good too, as would left over ham.  Definately will make this again, but will add to it as needed for taste or whatever I have in the fridge that I think would go good into it.

I thought this was an excellent way of using up my left over red potatoes. I mashed some and left some in chunks. I did add a bit of green onion but other than that, stuck to the recipe and it turned out wonderful. I did have some left over and the next day tried it with a pinch of shredded cheddar. That was a nice combination as well. I will be keeping this one on hand.

I tend to over do the Mashed Potatos and there is ALWAYS a ton left. This was a great recipe to use up the leftovers. The recipe was easy and everyone liked it. Served it with a Ceaser Salad and some fresh french bread to dip it in.

This recipe makes an awesome use of leftover mashed potatoes. It's worth planning for leftover MPs so you have a base for a quick soup. I bet it would be extra yummy with melted cheddar on it. I have made this a few times now and suggest adding milk a bit at a time until you get consistency desired, especially if doubling.

This is one of the best soups I've ever made!  From now on, every time I make mashed potatoes, I will have to "accidentally" make way more than is needed just to make more of this soup.  I pretty much followed the recipe as it was, but I sort of eyeballed the potatoes.  The mashed potatoes I used were baby-reds, jackets on, with lots of chives, and those textures with the creamy soup turned out really well.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

This was surprisingly good. I had leftover garlic mashed potatoes so it made a creamy, garlic potato soup. I only put 1 1/4 cup of water and then added a little more potatoes  to make it thicker. (it was even better and more thick the next day)

My family loved this recipe, even my VERY picky 2 year old. I used a little bit of garlic powder, not the celery salt. It was a little to runny, I'll use less milk next time. Great use for left over mashed potatoes! Thanks!!
