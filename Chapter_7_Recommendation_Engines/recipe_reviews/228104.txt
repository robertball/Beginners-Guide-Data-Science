I have read and reread this recipe looking to see if I misunderstood the step after leaving it over night to drain. I think perhaps a step was unintentionally omitted? The SALT must need to be rinsed off of the cucumber and onion mixture before you puree it, because following the above instructions (and this was after the anticipation of my whole family waiting three days to taste it) produced a substance too salty to consume. It was overwhelming, and I LOVE salt. We were so disappointed. I could tell, however, had it NOT been so salty it would have been delicious--with bright cucumber notes and the slight heat from the mustard seeds? I still cannot bring myself to dump it out, but it is inedible. I plan to try it again next time we have a surplus of cucumbers, I will update my results when I do. 
I have never left a negative review here, and I certainly mean no disrespect to the individual who posted this recipe. It sounds like a wonderful idea!

Great flavor!! 
When I initially mixed my veggie slices with the salt,  I added water and mixed till the salt dissolved. In the morning I rinsed the drained veggies again with plain water and let drain an hour. I followed the original irections except I substituted 6 tbsp. dry mustard for the mustard seeds.

I rinsed the veggies after draining them and they were still too salty to use. Next time I will try draining them with either less salt or no salt. there is a delicious potential here !
