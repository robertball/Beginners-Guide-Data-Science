I made this recipe exactly as written and it was good.  However, next time I will not add the cheese to the coating mix but will add it on top 10 minutes before baking is finished.  Also I would suggest drizzling butter on the coated chicken before baking to make it a little more juicy.  Overall a very good recipe.

I thought I had a packet of dry ranch dressing mix but it was dry Italian dressing mix (oops) however I did have some regular ranch dressing, and this really looked good.  SO, I decided to mix the ranch dressing (I eyeballed it, probably about 3/4 a cup) and the cheese, dip the chicken in that and then dredge in the bread crumbs.  I only had the Italian seasoned bread crumbs, but I didn't think it mattered too much.  My son, who can be picky about meat sometimes, LOVED this!  It's a winner and will make again!  Thanks for a great, and easy recipe!

We liked the flavor in this crispy baked chicken.  I think its flavor would appeal to a lot of people and I could see where it would be popular at a pot luck.  I used dry panko bread crumbs because they make it really crispy.  I used a combination of shredded Monterey Jack and Cheddar because that is what I had on hand.   The package of shredded cheese had the two mixed together.   I did not have a package of the ranch dressing mix so I made some using Scotdog's Dry Buttermilk Ranch Mix recipe from this site.   On the first couple of pieces of chicken the breading was not sticking to the chicken as well as I liked so I stirred an egg into the milk and that helped the breading stick a little better.  I placed the chicken on a baking rack inside a baking dish to keep the bottom of the chicken crispy.   I sprayed the chicken with cooking spray and then put it in the oven.  I can't say the exact time as the power went out during a thunderstorm while it was in the oven.  So it took longer than usual.  The end result was a delicious flavorful crispy chicken.  As I like spicy foods, next time I might use pepper jack cheese or add a little cayenne to give it a little heat.  Thanks Joanne for a new recipe to try.

Made this tonight for dinner.  It was very good and moist.  I did sprinkle some garlic salt on the chicken breast before because I was thinking it might be low on salt with just the breading.  It added a nice garlic flavor to it.  Just use a little so it doesn't become too salty.  I also used buttermilk instead of milk because it is what I had on hand.  The buttermilk adds to the ranch flavor.  Yum!

Threw the extra breadcrumb/cheese mix over the tops of the  chicken breasts and covered with foil before baking - delicious and easy.

SO good. Add Frank's Hot Sauce here and there before baking and you create a buffalo-ranch chicken. Making this tonight....can't wait!

This is a nice way to jazz up baked chicken breasts.  I made this and then sliced the breasts and served it on a salad, very tasty!

I would actually give this about 4.5 stars...it was quite good!  The consensus was that the ranch wasn't as noticeable as we thought it should be.  It just was a little bland.  However, the ranch was much stronger when we reheated some leftovers.  This was very easy to make.

Delicious! I have seen recipes for chicken with ranch dressing all the time. Some with the dressing, some with the dressing mix, but I had never tried the dressing mix before. Then one day, on a whim I grabbed a couple packets at the store. And I'm glad I did! This was delicious! It's very easy to make and instead of rifling through my spice cabinet for seasonings, I know I can just throw this together. For those wondering, it does not taste like ranch (at least not to me or my step daughter) it tasted just like seasoned chicken. We also did not use monteray cheese. We didn't have any on hand so we used a mix of queso fresco, cheddar and swiss. I imagine you could use any kind of cheese and it would be great. Try it!

I made this for a potluck.  It was extremely easy to make for a large crowd and everyone enjoyed....even the kids.  My daughter told me it was restaurant quality, what a huge compliment.  I took someone else's feedback and drizzled melted butter over the top.  Very delicious and even good left over.

I first made this when we were living in Chile.  I couldn't find the powdered mix so I used regular ranch dressing and added cheese then sort of coated the chicken in the bread crumbs, omitting the milk part.  It actually turned out pretty good and my hubby and kids really liked it.  It was super fast and easy to boot.  So I just made it again, not as good this time.  I don't know if its because the powder ranch mix is too salty, but it was much drier and way too salty.  I went back to the recipe to be sure that I wasn't supposed to make the powder into a dressing first, it doesn't indicate to do so.  So the take home message, for me anyway, is to just use regular ranch dressing (which we usually have on hand anyway).  Hope this helps!!

I did not have breadcrumbs so I used bisquick which wasn't as crunchy as it could have been but was still very good.  Did pour melted butter over the top and didn't put the cheese on until the final 10 minutes.  My husband and kids really liked it.

I thought it was really good and my picky kids loved it! I think it could do without the cheese because it didn't stick to the chicken and I had to put it in for an extra 15 min. I flipped it after 40 min for the moist outside on both sides.

I only had 2 boneless chicken breast halves (although they were quite big) so I cut them in half and used 4 pieces. Used panko and made sure to pat the chicken dry with paper towels before coating, in order to help the coating stick. Despite the amount of chicken I used I still used all the panko/ranch coating. Added an egg to the milk to help it stick.  I also didn't add cheese until the last 10 minutes of baking time, and I used a combo of parmesan and mozzarella because it's what I had on hand.  I also drizzled the coated chicken pieces with 2 T of melted butter before baking.  I thought this was tasty and my picky child ate every bite too.  Might add garlic powder next time.

Not bad.  I didn't have jack cheese so I just used cheddar.  Bf and I enjoyed these.  I didn't measure anything but just eyeballed and it worked perfectly.  Served with a potato and green bean salad.

I don't understand why I didn't like this one.  Reviews are so good.  I didn't change anything, and followed directions exactly.  The cheese didn't melt and the coating would not stick even when pressed onto chicken.  Flavor was really strong ranch and didn't care for it at all.  Feel bad as I rarely rate things so low.

Perfectly tender and delicious!  Easy dinner for a busy school night!  I used slices of Jack cheese, and put them on top, I do think the shredded would've been better.

I made this recipe for my family and they loved it. My daughter is not a big meat eater and asked for more. We will be making this again.

I, too put the cheese on top, at the end. The second time, I made a quick salsa with my peppers & tomatoes. I spooned the salsa on top and covered with monterey jack cheese. Best ever!

This was ok.  The chicken was a little dry and my family didn't really care for it.  I followed the recipe as written.  However I did take one reviewers advice and put the cheese on top.

It wasn't spectacular, but it was really good for an easy baked chicken. I did dip in butter instead of milk and added extra cheese on top right before it was done.

This was so good!! I followed the recipe exact and we loved the coating on the chicken!  Oh I just remembered I added a beaten egg to the milk as Occasional Cooker had mentioned to make sure the coating stayed on the chicken.  I wanted to sprinkle a little more cheese on the chicken but DH thought we should just try it as it's written which we did but next time I might like to add a little more to the tops :) We'll have this again!

I thought it was quite bland, and didn't get crispy at all.  Glad I tried it before I made it for a Meal Train.  Next time I'll try seasoning the breading and/or the chicken, and bake it on a cookie sheet instead of 8 x 10 pan.

family really liked it - I wouldn't really change it. It's not the most flavorful, but it has just enough to give the "boring" chicken breast a little life.

I made this using another reviewer’s suggestions.  Add the cheese to the top of the chicken about 5-10 mins before it’s done cooking.  I also only cooked about 25 mins and it was perfect!  Very tasty!

Delicious! I put half of the cheese in with a Panko bread crumb mix and sprinkled the other half over the chicken 10 minutes before it was done. Also, I used a baking rack over a baking pan so the chicken would be crispy on both sides. Last, I mixed one egg in with the milk so the bread crumb mixture would stick better. Yum!

Turned out great. I added a small dollop of mayo (sub for egg, didn't have any eggs), into the milk. Followed the rest of the directions as listed. Yummy! Will make this again.

This is a good solid recipe. I followed it exactly. Nest time I would put the cheese on the last part of the cooking process. When putting it in with the bread crumbs, (as recipe calls for) the duration of cooking the cheese didn't stand out from the breading and the cheese was crunchy and bland. Others suggested putting butter on as well, I think I will consider that as well. Definitely a keeper.

Very easy recipe.  I made this recipe as written and it came out very flavorful.   I may try adding the cheese in the last 10 minutes just to see how it comes out.  I liked having it mixed in though.

The concept and cooking times were spot on but I put my own twist on it. I first marinated the chicken breasts in Italian salad dressing. Rather than milk, I used the same dressing mixed with olive oil then breaded it. Before putting it in the oven, I drizzled olive oil on the chicken to keep it moist. I topped the chicken with shredded mozzarella about ten minutes before cook time was up. Amazingly delicious and moist.

Had the same issues that others had.  Cheese not sticking to the chicken when pressing the chicken into the bread crumb mixture (thus having to pile it on top after it's in the baking dish), and the cheese just baking instead of melting.  Aside from not getting much cheese taste, it was good tasting.  Will try again and put the cheese on separately towards the end.

I was looking for something different and I thought I'd give this a try because I had the ingredients. I measured out my 1 ounce pack of ranch and found it to be roughly 6 tsp. I used 2 tsp. of the ranch pack and added that to a half cup of mayonnaise and a 1/4 cup of milk and made a ranch dressing marinade for the chicken. I followed the rest of the recipe as listed above except the ranch in the breading was then only 4 tsp. instead of the whole pack and it turned out good. We liked this and would make it again.

Super easy and pretty tasty. My roommate said, "I don't even need ketchup!" which is very high praise from her! I only had cheddar cheese on hand, but I think next time I'll leave out the cheese.

I made this dish according to recipe (except for doubling it, that is) with the sole exception I sprinkled a little of the left-over mix on top, and it was heavenly.  I would recommend this dish to anyone who wants a delicious, wholesome and relatively low-calorie meal.

Try this one letting the chicken sit in Butter milk for a few hours instead of just dipping in milk. Then flour egg and bread crumb mixture. Sure to please. I also like to use Dark meat chicken.

This was zero "wow factor".  It is breaded chicken with a slight ranch flavor.  Easy to make, but doubt I will do it again.

nothing to write home about. If you don't want the crumb topping to be soggy on top, drizzle melted butter or spray with butter PAM.
