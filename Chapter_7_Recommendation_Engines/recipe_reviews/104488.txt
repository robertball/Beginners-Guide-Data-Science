Great stuff! Based on other reviews, I reduced the sour cream to 1/4 cup and increased the heavy cream to 3/4 cup and it is wonderful! Great texture! This one goes in the recipe box.

I used this recipe for my 2nd attempt at home made whipped cream (I didn't LOVE the results the first time I made a different recipe).  This is spot on.  The sour cream makes all the difference in the world.  This has a delightful flavor and consistency.  I did reduce the sour cream by 1/2, as I was afraid of too much *tang* and I"m glad I did.  It was perfect.  I chilled my bowl and beaters about 30 minutes before whipping.  THANKS for a great recipe!

Well I am always the one that orders "extra" whipped cream on everything so I love to make my own.  This was good...it was much more thick and creamy vs. the normal "whipped" texture.  Tasted almost like cheesecake probably because of the sour cream.  Would be great with berries or a fruity dessert.  Will make again!

This was so good and very easy.  I served this over strawberry shortcake and my husband could not get enough! Be sure to chill the bowl.

I needed a whipped cream frosting recipe, but I wanted to it to have more substance than just plain fresh whipped cream.  Adding the sour cream made the consistancy perfect for the cake! Not too sweet so as not to overdo the great taste of the dark chocolate cake I put it on.

This is the BEST substitute for cool whip! It lasts a long time in the fridge...like, we used it on a banana pudding dessert with vanilla wafers and an oreo cookie pudding dessert on the same night and we had some left over till the next morning and it was fine...not melted all over the place like regular whipped cream and not full of artificial stuff like whipped topping. Try it!

Absolutely delicous! The ability to make it several hours ahead is very helpful when entertaining.  It holds up very well.  I made it about six hours ahead.  I was serving 8 and I doubled the recipe and it was just enough. Also, I increased the confectioners sugar by 1/3 and liked how it came out.

Think of this as gourmet Cool Whip.  I made it to top a sweet potato pie and everyone liked it.  It was still stable in the morning and I ended up eating the rest for breakfast (no pie, just the cream!).  The first time I made this I did follow others suggestions and used 1/4 cup sour cream and 3/4 cup heavy cream.  I upped the powdered sugar to 1/3 cup because some mentioned it wasn't very sweet.  I usually don't modify recipes the first time I try them but I was feeding someone who typically doesn't care for sour cream and I was unsure how strong the original recipe would be.  The second time I followed the recipe exactly (except for 1/3 cup powdered sugar, not a major change) and it was still delicious with just a slight tang reminiscent of cheesecake.  If you don't tell anyone there's sour cream in this I doubt anyone would ever guess.  I never had a problem getting it to stiff peaks with a deep, chilled bowl and whisk and my stand up mixer.  It didn't take any longer to whip than just whipping cream would take.  I can't wait to try this on apple pie.

This was pretty good. I doubled the amount of heavy cream for less of a sour cream taste and adding 1/2 packet of unflavored gelatin completely dissolved in 2 oz of warm milk. When the cream was beaten to about 10 seconds away from the stiffness I like I added the dissolved gelatin and continued beating to incorporate it evenly. Adding the gelatin stabilizes the whipped cream allowing it to be kept in the refrigerator for several days without going runny.

Tastes really good! I used it on top of a coconut cake that called for plain whipped cream. I imagine it would be very good with fresh fruit. I don't think this whips up with as much volume as just plain whipping cream, so beware if you need a specific quantity, you'll probably have to scale up. Also, mine didn't come out quite as stiff as regular whipped cream does. After beating for quite some time I was afraid to beat any longer for fear I'd have butter and it was still fairly loose. The flavor is great though!

This has to be the easiest thing I have ever made. Very light and lots of flavor. I used the advice of the the other reviews and used 1/4 c. sour cream and 1/3 c. confectioners sugar. I put my metal bowl and paddles in the freezer (while I got my ingredients together). I had no problem whipping it into peaks. Hold your mixer straight up and move your bowl in circles instead of moving the mixer. It creates a smooth and even mixing motion that allows for smooth and even texture. Just my personal experience. No more Cool Whip for me!

Oh wow, this was good & silky. My husband has diabetes so I used 3 T of Splenda instead of powdered sugar. Cut the sour cream in half. Very, very good!

This is a lovely recipe. To ensure great results and wonderfully flavored whipped cream I always purchase  "pasteurized" rather than "ultra pasteurized cream". Look for it at Trader Joe's and/or Whole Foods.  It makes all the difference in the world!  Another trick for making a very stable whipped cream is to add some dry, powdered milk while whipping the cream.  Use the dry milk in lieu of the sour cream for a more pure whipped cream flavor.  Made this way the cream will hold not only overnight, but several days in the fridge.

It's ok as is.  It didn't give the the peaks that I was looking for.  This produces more of a soft peak.  I changed it to 1 cup of whipping cream, 1/2 cup sour cream 1/3 cup confectioners sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla and I got what I was looking for.  I'm using this on a Pumpkin Cheesecake with Gingersnap crust.

Did anyone tell Hot Mamma, who said that this was her first try,  that heavy or "whipping" cream whips up without adding anything? That's even easier! You don't need sour cream, and if you want it sweetened, you can use regular sugar. You whip it right before you serve it.

This was DELICIOUS!! I can't imagine why anyone had trouble getting this to stiffen; I had peaks within 3 minutes.  Maybe they have never made a meringue type dish before and didn't know the steps to whipping?  I didn't chill the bowl and still didn't have problems.  Just mix on low to incorporate all ingredients (about 30 seconds) and then whip on medium-high until stiff. If it seems like its not stiffening you can increase speed.  I didn't change the recipe at all, and it was so good I had to refrain from licking all the utensils AND bowl clean! (I only succeeded in refraining from licking the bowl =P) It has a SLIGHT tang of cheesecake, but if I didn't know there was sour cream in it I never would have guessed.  This is definitely a welcome addition to my recipe box! I'll be using it for strawberry shortcake, but I will definitely find more uses for it! Thanks for the recipe!

Absolute perfection!  Love the slight tang the sour cream adds.  I had to whip mine for about 7 minutes to get it thick and added a bit more confection sugar when it was taking so long (maybe a teaspoon at most).  Had it with the Country Apple Dumpling recipe also found here on AR (which is a must to try if you haven't yet!).

This was my first attempt at making homemade whipped cream.  Made this to top a blueberry tart.  I didn't have any sour cream on hand so I used cream cheese instead.  It was a hit even for my three little picky eaters and my husband. I will make this again and again!!!

Perfectly adequate whipped cream. I gave it a 5 because you can't really go wrong with heavy cream - its going to be good. The sour cream adds a nice tanginess, and it just takes a few minutes to prepare whipped cream thats vastly superior to the store bought stuff.

this was easy.  my whipping cream didn't seem to peak until I added the sugar.  Once I added the sugar, it whipped right up.  My husband said it wasn't sweet enough.  I didn't mind since we were using with crepes and used Blueberry Sauce submitted by ISYBEL and that was already sweet.  I would give this 4.5 since it could be a little sweeter.

So good! I took the other reviewers advise and halfed the sour cream. I also stuck with granulated sugar. Would have given five stars had I not made changes.

I made this tonight to top "Banana Cream Pie Made Easy" from this site. I screwed it up but still tasted fantastic!! I was in a hurry and tried to follow some of what I read in the reviews. I cut the sour cream back to 1/4c, used 1c of heavy cream (it was already in the bowl LOL!) and used 1/2c of confectioner's sugar!! Best pie I ever made and my company loved it too!! I guess the sour cream toned down the sweetness of the sugar. Next time I'll I won't get so carried away when I get baking!!

This was so easy and soooo yummy, I did end up using a little less sour cream which made this whipped cream perfect.

This is a great recipe. I like it much more with white sugar instead of powdered sugar though. Try that if it doesn't taste quite right to you. Love it, love it, love it!

I followed the ingredients to the letter and then whipped forever and could not get stiff peaks. Wondering if I missed something.

This turned out great.   I made this to go on top of a chocolate creme pie--they were a great combo.   I cut back on the sour cream and added more cream like several other reviewers and was happy with the results.

This is okay. I use 1 cup heavy cream, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon powdered sugar.  Whatever I do, I never use Cool Whip because it has a really nasty flavor and after taste.  I always use the real thing.  And mine will keep more than one day.

I used this on a strawberry shortcake recipe and it was quick and easy to make. I did not measure it but it did seem to make more than the 1.5 cups. Also, I did not have an electric mixer but was still able to achieve the right consistency just using a fork! It went over extremely well and everyone raved about it. Much better tasting than store bought whipped cream worth the extra ten minutes it took to make!

1st time I made this, I followed the recipe.  2nd time, I reduced the amount of sour cream.  Was very good, but a little too much for us.  I put the bowl in the freezer for a few minutes prior to making.  Will increase the vanilla next time.  Great recipe and easy to modify based on your own taste.

I changed it a little to 3/4 cup cream and 1/4 cup sour cream because that was all the sour cream I had. Turned out great! Very flavorful and it held overnight in the fridge extremely well. When put on ice cream, it was still holding when the ice cream had already melted! Thank you for the recipe thymekeeper!

After reading other reviews, I made sure to chill the bowl and beaters. I also decided to mix the sour cream, vanilla and powdered sugar in a small separate bowl prior to adding to the chilled bowl containing the heavy cream. It whipped up very quickly and nicely. But I was somewhat dissappointed that the sour cream didn't made a bigger difference. The taste wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special either. It was a nice, thick, creamy whipped cream but not a whole lot different than the recipe minus the sour cream.

I made a pumpkin cake tonight and thought I had some whipped topping to use for it - nope. I had heavy cream I could have whipped, but decided to look at recipes for something else (I had heard about stabilizing cream with pudding so that was originally what I was after) and found this one. This recipe is so easy and tasty for something like my cake - or a pie that you would normally use Cool Whip. I actually like it better for this because the tang of the sour cream was slightly apparent and was really nice with the sweetness of the cake. Thanks for the recipe - I'll make it again!

This is terrific!  Holds up really well in my fruit salad. I have made this several times, and it holds up more than overnight.  I usually make a double or triple batch, and it has held up really well for the couple of days that it lasts over the holidays.

I ended up making this, because my local grocery store was out of cool whip. This was really easy to make. I made the sour cream by adding a half tbsp. of vinegar to a half cup of whipping cream. My standing mixer, fitted with a wire wisk attachment, was used to whip this up in less than two minutes. The taste and texture was great! Don't think I'll be going back to using Cool Whip again :) Thanks for sharing.

The tasted really good, although I still prefer "plain" whipped cream (cream and sugar only).  We used it in a trifle and the sour cream helped cut the sweetness of the other ingredients and suited it perfectly.

The title is misleading it should read "Easy and Really, Really, Good Whipped Cream.  I fill a the mixing bowl up with ice water and and soak the blending utensil as well.  It really helps.  Adjusting the sour cream can make it range from frosting like to traditional.

Amazing and very easy. Used for strawberry shortcake and the sour cream really accented the strawberries very well. I cut the sour cream down to 1/4 cup based off of other reviews, and I'm very happy with the result. Will use this recipe over and over again.

This recipe was A-MAAAAAZING!!! It was such a light, refreshing taste! Oh yea, it surprisingly had a cheesecake flavor too! I made a substitute with the vanilla. I used real vanilla beans; it gave it that Breyers vanilla ice cream look lol(YUM!). I've also doubled the recipe for 2 strawberry banana cream pies. Now that I know how to make whipped cream AND how simple it is to make, I have NO reason to buy that canned stuff again!! One more thing...I whipped it a bit longer than suggested (abt 7-8 min). I wanted it to be extra fluffy and it was! :)

This tasted too much like sour cream. I  made two batches. One with 1/4 c of sour cream and 3/4 cup heavy cream and one as the recipe stated, 1/2 and 1/2. The one with less sour cream was MUCH better.

Yummy, yummy! I made this to go with some pies I was taking for Thanksgiving. This was preferred over the cool whip my mother-in-law put out. I loved the flavor. I will admit that I only used 1/4 cup of fat free sour cream, and upped the cream to 3/4 cup. I used splenda instead of sugar. It wasn't quite sweet enough so I added an extra 1/3 cup. Very tasty though, and I loved the consistency. Definitely a keeper.

If I could give zero stars I would. It tasted a little too much like sour cream and there wasn't enough flavor, I couldn't eat it it was so bad. I would not recommend even trying it, don't waste the ingredients.

This turned out beautifully! I used 1 cup heavy whipping cream, a half cup sour cream 1/4 cup powdered sugar and a half tsp vanilla. I put my metal mixing bowl and whisk in the freezer for about a half hour. It filled up a 8 oz empty Cool whip bowl perfectly. Thanks

This is a nice stable recipe for piping. I loved the flavor and texture. I did use 3/4 cup of whipping cream, 1/3 cup of powdered sugar, and 1/4 cup of sour cream. The sour cream gives it good stability and a lovey taste. I chilled the bowl and whipping attachment in the freezer prior to making. I put the whipping cream, sour cream, and vanilla in the bowl first and started whipping adding the powdered sugar slowly during the process. I used a Kitchenaid stand mixer and it whipped up very quickly.

The sour cream makes the difference.  Made it a 2nd time and I didn't have sour cream, it was definitely missing that extra deliciousness.  You can also adjust the sweetness to your liking.  If you don't want your whipped cream to turn an off-white from the vanilla extract, make sure to use the clear vanilla extract.

Best whipped cream I've ever had! I liked that it wasn't too sweet and had the perfect consistency. I added about 1/4 cup more powdered sugar to cut the tang of the sour cream (before reading the other reviews) and then it was delicious. No more cool whip in this house!

This was pretty good.  It wasn't as sweet at first, you could really taste the sour cream, so I added a little more 10x sugar and it was good to go.  All in all, good recipe, but be aware that the sour cream gives it a slightly different taste than you may be used to.

I so wanted this to work.  I thought it would be just perfect on the cheesecake that I had made.  But it was just a soupy mess.  I whipped and whipped with my stand mixer, nothing.  I read the reviews that said all of a sudden this would just come together and thicken up, but that never happened.  Not saying that I wouldn't give it another chance, but I went with a different whipped cream recipe on this occasion.

I was just looking for the right ingredients and this told me what i needed to know. I poured in what was left of my small carton of heavy cream (about 3/4 of it), and what looked like 1 part powdered sugar (compared to the cream- 1 part sugar, to 4 parts cream...make sense? i dunno) anywhoo then poured in what looked like about a tsp of vanilla and started beating it with my electric mixer for 5 mins or so...it was BEAUTIFUL!!! I dont really like sour cream, and it was fine without it. I LOVE this! :) thank youuu, its very tasty on my coconut cream pie

Why must you put sour cream in a whip cream recipe?  I only use a small amount of sugar and heavy cream and whip.  It does need sour cream or vanilla and still taste better than cool whip or canned.  The texture is always very light.

The sour cream is what separates this whipped cream from store bought. It makes it tangy.  However, it's a bit too tangy. I'd recommend cutting the amount of sour cream in half, or, if you want something like store-bought, omit it entirely and add a small pinch of sea salt to counteract the sweetness.   Very good recipe! I'll definitely be making it again!

Great recipe!  The sour cream adds a nice tanginess and creaminess to it. fI have aforever made whipped cream using just the mixer and the cream, vanilla and white granulated sugar, but will always use this recipe now.  LITTLE TIP: squeeze in just a little fresh lemon juice.  That gives a nice zing too!

Very yummy and a nice change of pace from regular whipped cream.  Tart, yet sweet, plus a creamy and dense texture.  This won't replace regular whipped cream, but will be nice to have as an option.

I made this to go on strawberry shortcake and was not disappointed. I think the sour cream makes it perfect for strawberries.

So good! I followed some reviews and reduced the sour cream to 1/4c, increased the heavy cream to 3/4c, and I made sure the metal mixing bowl and metal whisk were super cold before I started.  I also used Splenda instead of regular sugar.  It turned out so delicious!

This recipe is nothing spectacular...tastes just like the whipped cream from the container.  I was hoping for a little more homemade taste, but it worked for what I needed it for.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was a little too sour for my taste. It would be great for berries or other fruit that would balance it out, but we wanted it for pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving. So I made another batch with just a tablespoon of sour cream and a little more confectioners sugar and it was fabulous! I could not believe how good it was. Far and away the best whipped cream I have ever tasted. Everyone absolutely loved it and couldn't believe it was made from scratch. Much, much better than cool whip. And for those who have never made whipped cream before be sure and use a taller bowl or measuring cup to mix it in. From personal experience, if the mixing bowl is too shallow the cream will not thicken, ever... and you'll realize it when it turns to curds and whey! I use a two or four cup pyrex measuring cup depending on how much cream I am making. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for on top of pumpkin pies in hopes of offering a fun alternative to plain ol' store-bought whipped cream.  Turned out to be a poor choice for us - it was not sweet at all - tasted more like sour cream than whipped cream.  After realizing that I gradually added almost another whole cup of confectioner's sugar but to no avail - still sour.  It was the right texture however. I did used a chilled bowl and whisk for my KitchenAid with this recipe.

This was delicious, but the original recipe did have too much sour cream. That amount of sour cream worked with my old-fashioned strawberry pie, but not with much else.  I increased the heavy cream to 1 cup and reduced the sour cream to 1/4 cup.  Confectioner's sugar and vanilla was just right.  It's perfect!

Based on other reviewers suggestions I increased the heavy cream to 3/4 cup and reduced the sour cream to 1/3 cup.  The whipped cream was very tasty but still seemed like it had too much sour cream so next time I'll try 1/4 cup instead.  Mine never had stiff peaks but was "whipped" enough for my liking.  Will definitely use this recipe instead of buying cool whip from now on!

I made this yesterday and it was delicious. I love the texture, it was thick yet fluffy and light. Per suggestions, I used only 1/4 c sour cream and 3/4 c cream.  

I could taste the sour cream a little bit, yet it still tastes really good.  Next time I will replace the sour cream for plain yogart, I might even add a pinch of nutmeg for flavor.  

Either way, we loved it and this is going to be my main recipe for whipped cream. Like others, I don't think i'll ever buy whipped cream again.

Mmmmm Tasty! Didn't have any confectioners sugar; what was a girl to do? I did have Splenda.....well I used the same proportion of Splenda as the Confectioners sugar and whipped that baby up.....Whipped up well producing softer peaks but was still a keeper...who needs confectionary sugar anway!

To make this turn out perfectly, prepare the mixing bowl by filling it with ice water and letting it sit for at least five minutes. I made this by hand whisk and it came out great -- not as stiff as from the can, but there's only so much you can do without pressurized air.

Very nice texture, and tastes great.
The sour cream is very over powering I'd probably reduce or use this specific whipped cream with other dishes. Just a little to tart for the chocolate cake we made. 
Thank you for sharing.

Nice consistency. Sour cream kept the cream whipped.  Next time I would use only one-third of the amount of sour cream because the taste was a little overpowering.

Tasted very good but would not thicken at all so we weren't able to use it for our pudding pie. But husband is saving it to add to his coffee...too bad it didn't work for us.

My family loved this - I used Greek yogurt in lieu of sour cream and it was delicious!

I took someone else’s advice on here and did 3/4 heavy cream and 1/4 sour cream. It is so airy! Tastes amazing! I was quite impressed!

best recipe I have made for whipped cream . have made this a few times now. the first I used more sugar, less sour cream and topped pies , it was delicious. this last time I followed the amount of sour cream and just a bit more sugar. I used this in a parfait. it was perfect.

The flavor of this was amazing.  I did as suggested and reduced the sour cream and my husband went crazy for it on top of a fruit cobbler.  Great easy recipe!

This turned out great for a dessert all on its own. Followed the recipe but doubled up the measurements to make more I ended it adding sliced up strawberries, bananas, and blueberries. Delicious!

This was fantastic! I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, because ...that's just what I do to cut down on our fat intake.  Very creamy and not too sweet-perfect on strawberry shortcake!

Much better then just whipped cream.  Tip:  Make sure your bowl and beaters are icy cold  in order to get nice peaks.

Used this recipe on the Lemon Blueberry dessert recipe I found here also.  It was wonderful!  I doubled the recipe, but I listened to the other reviews & cut the sour cream in half.  It came out great & was delicious!   I will definitely use this recipe for whipped cream again!!

Ok, I am going to admit that I altered the recipe without trying the original. I wanted to do an experiment for someone's birthday and used this recipe as a base. The only alteration I made was to substitute the sour cream with lemon pie-filling. It was amazing. And while I have yet to try the recipe 'As-is', I would have to think that it is even better when you follow the recipe. This is definitely staying in my recipe book. Thanks!

I made this to top a dense Christmas Cake that had lots of dried fruit in it. I needed something less sweet than a traditional whipped cream. It was the perfect compliment to the sweet, chewy, spicy cake!

When I made it everyone loved it! They couldn't stop eating it! I would defiantly make it again because it was sooooooo light and fluffy with a great taste of vanilla. (I recommend using the real vanilla extract instead of the imitation one because it's stronger.) I also used 1/4 of a cup of sour cream instead of a half of a cup because I was afraid of getting the tang that came with the sour cream. Overall I would recommend making it and I would make it again!??

based on this recipe,  I'm giving  4 stars only because it was a little too tangy. I'll reduce the source cream by half next time and 3/4 heavy cream. but it was delicious all the same

This recipe is wonderful.   I did reduce the sour cream by half as previous reviewers had recommended.  It was very smooth and creamy.  My family doesn't normally like homemade whip cream, but they loved this recipe.

Turned out perfect! Even after being refrigerated overnight ir still had perfect consistancy. I used low-fat sour cream because it was what was on hand.

Oh.  My.  Goodness!!  I will NEVER buy cool whip ever again!  This was oh so yummy, that the family kept sneaking spoonfuls from the fridge before I could add it to the strawberry shortcake I had made it for.  This was a hit, and definitely a keeper!  Thank you SO much for sharing this delectable recipe!!

As written, for me, it tastes too much like the sour cream.  The second time I made it, I reduced sour cream to 1/4 c and upped the heavy cream to 3/4 c.  I added a bit more vanilla for my own personal taste as well.  After the alterations, it's five stars.  Having said that, both the original and adjusted versions whip up to a beautiful consistency.

My family has been making whipped cream for pies, etc. for years. I did take others advice and reduced the sour cream by half and adjusted the whipping cream. Never would have thought to put sour cream in it. This recipe is going in the recipe box. I'll have to pass on the secret to the rest of the family.

I'll never buy Cool whip again! This was so easy to make and the flavor was very good. I followed the suggestion of others and increased the cream to 3/4 cup and reduced the sour cream to 1/4 cup. I also increased the sugar to abt 1/2 cup and it was perfect. of course, i had to stop and keep scraping the sides, but the consistency was perfect for my first time. Will definitely make again. THANK YOU!!

Made this last night to pair with the old fashioned strawberry shortcake on allrecipes.  I did stick the whipping cream in the freezer for awhile and checked it often to shake it and make sure it wasn't going to freeze.  I had a hand held blender and it took I'm guessing ten minutes plus for it it thicken. It was awesome and my friends loved it.  They liked it better than the standard whipped cream I also made.  There's a lot more depth in flavor to this but just a bit heavier.  For not being a good cook this came out great!

Great recipe; super easy, super quick, and great tasting.  I only had splenda, but it still held up (which I wasn't expecting).  I can't wait to get some real sugar so that I can try it as it was intended.

So easy, and very tasty.  I followed the reviews and increased the heavy cream to 3/4 cup, and decreased the sour cream to 1/4 cup.  It was delicious!  I made ahead and kept chilled, and it was still light and fluffy.

Love the flavour and texture of this whipped cream. It is a little more soft and less dense then just plain old whipped cream.

I used granulated sugar and didn't notice a difference. Also, skipped the sour cream for an even lighter fluffier whipped cream! So, so, so good!

I loved it. I used yogurt instead of sour cream because I had it on hand, and to me has same texture. It worked great and I did not have run out to get an ingredient like sour cream that I rarely use. It reminds me of the coolwhipped topping but homemade.

The first time I made it, it was perfection!  Delicious with perfect consistency, peaks, fluffy everything, delicate taste. The second time I made it, I wasn't exact with the ingredients and I can taste the sour cream a bit too much for my liking. Next time, I'll be exact again and hope it comes out like it did the first time :)  Try it out for yourself!

I don't know what I did wrong.  I used a Kitchenaid mixer and tried the recipe twice, but both times they never made the stiff peaks I was looking for.  I swear I mixed it on high for at least 10 minutes each "try," but neither time it worked.  However, it still tasted great w/ the strawberry shortcake I was making.  Just had to think of it as a decadent cream, and not the fluffy whipped topping I was hoping for.  I also added a little more confectioners' sugar (1/3 c) and a squeeze of lemon juice.  The taste was a little different - I liked it but my husband thought it tasted a little strange...didn't like the sour cream part.  Not sure if I'll try this one again.

This whipped cream is very flavorful! Much more so than store bought, and with a better consistancy. You can definately taste that there is sour cream in there though, so you might want to play with the proportions to get it to your liking. But made as-is my sister said it tasted like cheesecake- so it's good in my book!

Fantastic! Very creamy & delicious! Better than store bought. Mine turned out a little tangier than it should have, but that was my fault - only had fat free sour cream. However, it was light and fluffy, easy to make, and worked perfectly fine using 1/2 regular white sugar as well. Just add slowly and stir stir stir!

I wanted something that tastes a little more like what you might buy at the store, but the sour cream lends a flavor that prevents that.  It's still very good, though.  This whipped up really easily and stayed that way for a bit, without melting in the fridge, which was a plus.  Next time I'll probably go for a more basic recipe, though...

Good flavor. Tastes best with fruit pies. Not so good on pumpkin pie.

My family loves this recipe.  I listened to everyone else and only put 1/3 of the sour cream in.  I don't think I will ever buy whipped cream again

This was excellent! I did as other viewers suggested, I increased the cream to 3/4 cup and deceased the sour cream to 1/4 cup. So yummy! I served this with the Belgian Waffles and the Chocolate Waffles I from this site. This recipe is a keeper!! I will never use cool whip again!

This was good especially since we didn't have any ready made in our fridge.

Great recipe! Will definitely use again.  I followed everyone's advice and reduced the sour cream.  I doubled the recipe and still only used 1/4 cup of sour cream.  I made it the night before for lunch on the following day.  It was tasty!!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very good!! Tasted like cheesecake, it wasn't tart at all... only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that it was so rich... not quite the consistancy of whipped cream, but it was really good!

I made this whipped cream to top Waffles with fresh strawberries.  Because of the sour cream, it was a bit tart for this purpose.  It does make a very thick and cheesecake-like cream.
