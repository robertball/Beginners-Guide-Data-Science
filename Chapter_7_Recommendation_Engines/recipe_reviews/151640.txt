I made this in the slow cooker and it was delicious.  I could not find the Pace chipotle salsa so I used 2 jars of the regular salsa with a can of chipotle sauce (not the chiptoles in adobo).  I cut my pork shoulder into pieces but not 2" chunks just because I didn't want it to dry out.  I took the meat out, shredded with a knife and then added back to the sauce in the crock pot.  Served on toasted buns.  It was a hit...delicious!!!

I only used a 2.5 lb. roast, so I didn't use as much salsa. I omitted the mustard and instead added BBQ sauce. Cranberries gave it a great kick. I also didn't serve this with coleslaw because I can't stand it. I made sweet potato chips in the oven-- delicious. Good meal!

I made this for a New years Day party. It was fast and a big hit.  Unfortunately, we didn't have many leftovers.  I would make it again, my 3 teenage sons loved it.

I was looking for something to make with ground meat in the slow cooker that was not meatballs or chili - so I came upon this recipe!  I changed the meat in this recipe  - I used 2 lbs of ground bison (browned first), and I scaled down the recipe by using:  a 26-oz jar of mild, chunky salsa / a 14-oz can of whole berry cranberry sauce /  1/2 cup brown sugar / 2 tbsp prepared mustard / and 1/2 tsp. fresh grated nutmeg.  I lightly salted and peppered the bison while it was browning.  Came out very nice - served over rice with peas on the side!

The flavor was good, but no great.  The coleslaw added a little special something.  I did add hot salsa which gave the recipe a kick.  I would rate this a B.  I did have better.

I did this in a slow cooker with a pork loin roast. It came out a little dry because it is a leaner cut of meat. The sweetness of the cranberries kind of turn the salsa into a barbeque sauce. I did not add the mustard or nutmeg.  I also use regular salsa instead of the chipotle salsa because I was worried about the heat, so I just added the amount of chipotle pepper in adobo sauce that I know my family can tolerate. A nice change from your standard pulled pork and bbq sauce.

This is the best pulled pork I have ever had! This could have been served at a 5 star restaurant. No kidding!
