I did not mix this drink by adding the coffee granules to the ice--what I did was mix the coffee into the half in half and stirred until the instant coffee dissolved, then poured it over the ice and then added the Diet Coke. Interesting drink. I liked that it combined my two favorite things, Diet Coke and coffee.

I used Diet Coke since it's my cola of choice. I also mixed the coffee into the half and half because I didn't think it would mix well otherwise. When the Coke meets the coffee and half and half, it puts on a big fizz show. Might be fun for a few minutes, but the taste just isn't something I care to experience again.

oh my gosh, everyone thinks I'm nuts because I put diet coke in my iced coffee! Now I have proof, I'm not the only one! Actually my favorite is a 32 oz Quick Trip cup fill with ice, a big splash of frozen cappuccino and then fill with diet cook. Tastes like the cappuccino without all the calories. I love this idea. I'm sharing it on facebook. Thanks.

This drink certainly is an acquired taste! It thought it was ok, and believe it or not, thought it needed to be a bit more sweet, so I added 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar, and mixed it (stirred well) into the cream and coffee granules in my large 24 oz. mason mug.  I then filled the mug half full with mini ice cubes, and slowly poured my Coke over the ice.

Surprising. I thought that it would taste weird because of the Cola (and it does), but it's really good. PS.: Replaced the half-and-half by milk cream.

Well, all I can say was this was odd, different, yet not too bad. It kind of reminded me of a float after the ice cream was melted. Maybe, like putting a scoop of coffee ice cream on top of cold soda as it does bubble up quite a bit. The ice is definitely necessary. I needed one large glass for half the recipe. I used diet Pepsi for the soda. The drink also had an after taste of coffee punch, which I actually like too.
