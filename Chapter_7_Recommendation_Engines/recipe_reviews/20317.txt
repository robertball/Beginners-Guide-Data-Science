Contrary to what others have said about this rhubarb crisp, I found it turned out wonderful.  My husband loves it!  If it is made with just a bit more top layer, it turns out much nicer.  My husband made it and added more flour to the top layer.  Turned out amazing.  We've tried it with fresh and frozen rhubarb and both turned out wonderful.  Good luck!

I was skeptical since I've never made a crisp recipe that mixed the oats in with the fruit, but this was fantastic.  I made it exactly as written, with the exception of being a bit more liberal with the cinnamon and my rhubarb was frozen not fresh.  Everyone loved this, I'll be making it again and again.

Wonderful, making a 2nd batch.  I added 1 full cup of oats.  Made it just a bit thicker.

This recipe was great!  Contrary to the few reviews below which didn't like it, I think if you put in the 1 teaspoon of the salt and baking soda there won't be a problem...  It turned out quite nice on the first time.  We put in 4 cups of rhubarb (as ours has done plants amazingly well this year) and then bumped everything up a little.  I would probably up the amount of oats as one other person suggested to make it a little thicker.  This was a great recipe that I will definitely make again.

This turned out delicious!  I changed some ingredient amounts after reading other reviews.  I took out the white sugar & used 3 packets of artificial sweetener, I like oatmeal so I increased the oats to 1 cup, increased cinnamon to 1.5 tsp.  For the topping I increased the flour to 1 cup and decreased the salt to 1/4 tsp.  Also a little secret, I let the rhubarb soak in the sugar mixture for 15 minutes, very yummy!

Since the ingredients seemed to be in order, then I put the brown sugar in with the topping ingredients. I always double cinnamon in any recipe. wish i would have read the reviews first and I would have omitted the salt altogether. Tasted great & I will probably make it again since I have a great supply of the best rhubarb around. Serves three. My husband, son & me. I could have maybe stretched it to six.

I have to agree with many on here who think this crisp could use vast improvement.  I thought I would list all of my changes out here, but I think it would be easier just to submit a whole new recipe.  Some basics you should know if you plan to make this is that the oatmeal mixed into the fruit absorbs 90% of the moisture, the added flour is just overkill and will turn out like glue.  Way too much sugar drowns out the tartness of the rhubarb which I really like.  The topping has a WAY TOO HIGH flour to butter ratio to the point where it doesn't even brown and all you can taste is flour and baking soda. Not great.

Horrible - I made this for my family - no one liked it.  Not sure what the problem is too much baking soda - just bland tasting ... won't be making this again!

Am I the only one who noticed it calls for 1 tsp. ground cinnamon but doesn't tell you where it goes? Anyway...I didn't know where to add it so I sprinkled it into the flour/salt/soda/margarine mixture.  I think this tasted pretty good, a little salty, but add a scoop of vanilla ice cream and you will not notice any saltiness.

It turned out horrible.  Way too much butter.  It tasted like sugar and butter, no rhubarb taste at all.  A waste of ingrediants!

This was the first time I've ever cooked or eaten rhubarb, and I thought this recipe was delicious!  Maybe a little less salt, but still very good.  I will definitely make this again!

This is excellent as written.  However , if you would like it thicker, just add more oats.  Thanks for posting....

I like fruit filled crisps and cobblers.  Although I nearly doubled the rhubarb but didn't increase flour & oats, this is very doughy - if you like dough stuck to your teeth and the roof of your mouth, this is for you.  I'm still looking for a traditional recipe that takes advantage of the wonderful flavor & texture of rhubarb without being overwhelmed with too much sugar, flour and oats.  I have been disappointed so far and wish I had my grandmother's recipe!

I wish I had read the reviews before choosing this recipe - I wasted my rhubarb that was given to me on this recipe - WAY too sugary, it was runny, the topping was not like a crisp should be - we couldnt' even finish a small bowl.

I was given fresh rhubarb from a coworker.  This is the recipe I chose to make.  Because I am a vegan, I used Earth Balance butter instead of butter.  It was delicious, I doubled the recipe to share at work.  They loved it too.

This is an awesome dessert and easy to make.  I was a little worried since I didn't read the reviews until after the crisp was already baking, the topping is salty, like a pie crust, but when you scoop it out and eat everything together it is soooo good.  Just made another one last night since it goes so fast.  Yuuuummmmmm!!!!!

I've now made this a few times, and it's pretty good.  I halved the salt/baking soda, because it was too salty the first time.  I also usually use a little more rhubard.  Worth trying!

A little sugar added to the topping made it even tastier.  Hubby said it is better than his mom's rhubarb pie.  I'm not a fan of rhubarb but I loved this!  Definitely a keeper.

This was more like a rhubarb cobbler then a crisp.  Way too sweet (the recipe called for too much sugar!) and mushy, & I even cooked it longer then what was called for.  Disappointed...since I wanted a really good "crisp"!

I would definitely add a couple more cups of rhubarb.  It was very sweet.  And, I may alter the topping a bit so that it is crumbly.

This is actually quite good. I really liked the oats mixed in with the rhubarb.   I made one change... added 1/2 c flour to the topping as it was quite buttery. It took 40 min on convection bake...my rhubarb might not have been cut small enough.  I'd make this again.

Rhubarb itself was good, however a little on the sweet side. I agree with other reviewers as the topping tastes like butter and flour.

I really liked this version. It tastes like the recipe I used to make30 years ago but didn't make it for a long time because I lost my recipe in a move. I did add about 2 tsp. of cinnamon which gave it that flavor I remembered so well. In all, with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream, it's very special!

I doubled the recipe and it came out VERY salty! I made it with a mixture of rhubarb and strawberries. That part was good. I double checked EVERYTHING. While I thought maybe I switched baking soda for baking powder, but found out that it was the right box.

I did not care for this recipe. A bowl full of sugar and a salt topping. I think there is something wrong with where the ingredients go. The brown sugar and cinnamon should go in the topping.

I did not like this recipe.  It calls for mixing the oats, flour, cinnamon, sugar and rhubarb then topping it with plain flour, margarine, soda and salt.  This made a gooey mess with diluted flavor.  Much better to pick a recipe that calls for sweetened rhubarb covered with sweet crunchy topping.

Very good!!  I doubled the recipe, but not the white sugar and put it in a 9x13 pan, turned out great, next time I will also decrease the brown sugar and the  butter a little bit.  We ate it with ice cream, I will be making this again!

Quick and very tasty. I would decrease the white sugar as it was a bit to sweet for me.  Would suggest 3/4 c.  Also, I added some vanilla and lemon juice. Thanks.

While I thought the rhubarb was yummy, the topping needs a change. It was very bland and not crisp at all.

Very nicely done. Although I almost didn't add the cinnamon since it is missing in the instructions.  I added more flour for the topping and some chopped pecans (like the topping on a dump cake).  Great way to use rhubarb.

Super easy, I 1/3 the recipe because I had so little rhubarb and I cooked it in a loaf pan.  I also replaced the margarin with coconut oil, starting with 2 tbsp (for my smaller batch) and adding a bit til I had the right consistency.  Easy, vegan, sweet, sour, and salty!  Love it.

Worst rhubarb crisp recipe ever. It didn’t even seem right while making it, but decided to see how it turned out. The topping is just a flour paste. No “crisp” at all. Since when do the oats get mixed into the rhubarb instead of being used in the topping? Can’t believe this is the first google hit for a rhubarb crisp.

Used frozen rhubarb so drained about 1/2 cup liquid off first from 31/2 c rhubarb. Also reduced brown sugar to 1/2 cup, as we like it tart. Very good, and will definitely make it again.

The only change I made was combined apples and the rhubarb. I didn't have enough of either. I added more butter and crumble to the top and extra cinnamon.

This is a quick recipe and easy to make. I didn't have enough rhubarb so substituted a cup of apples. It was still tart and tasty. I would recommend cutting down on the sugar in the topping. It was too sweet for my family.

Very good, however, next time I make it will leave off the flour topping which we found made it too dry.  Hence '4' rating.

I love rhubarb, and this turned out great.  I used frozen rhubarb with no issues, other than I cooked it a bit longer.  I took advice from previous reviews and increased the topping slightly.

Meh... Needs to cook a while longer, and WOW - That salt is something else.   Defiantly needs ice cream or cream.

I should have read all the reviews as I will not make again.  I found it too salty and could taste baking soda.  This was the first time I mixed oatmeal with rhubarb. It was too thick (no juice) as the rhubarb are soft but was not done.  Chewy.  I baked it 40 minutes even but I think the oatmeal soaked up all the juice so the rhubarb wasn't cooked.

Didn't like it. It was runny and salty and I won't ever make it again.

This was so easy and I really loved the taste of the brown sugar in the recipe.  Will make again and may even experiment with peaches and apples.  Definitely recommend this recipe.  Great warmed up in microwave the second day!

Made this for our family yesterday with fresh rhubarb from my uncle's garden and it was a hit. We made a few adjustments though. We doubled the recipe and cooked it for a total of 55 minutes. We changed the topping as well by adding some sugar and some oats which gave it sweetness and variety. We also added three (keep in mind this was the doubled recipe and we probably should have only used two) eggs to the rhubarb mix for a slightly more custard-y taste. All in all, the recipe worked out well.

The recipe does not have the right texture to be eaten alone. It would be better as a topping on ice cream

I loved the flavor of this crisp except I would leave out the salt altogether from the topping next time.. also, it makes a square pan.  In my 2 quart rectangle it was too flat.  The rhubarb filling was the perfect balance between sweet and tart.

This was wonderful but I am convinced that it is because I let it bake about 50 minutes.  I normally don't like rolled oats in a crisp recipe but the oats just thickened the rhubarb.  I also made my own brown sugar with molasses.

This was ok.  I prefer the crumb topping with the oats on top instead of in with the fruit...I probably wouldn't make it again and would go with my old standby recipe but it was fun change of pace for one time.

Not thrilled. Tho topping was not as I expected and it probably needed more sugar. A bit tart. I would highly recommend the Rhubarb Dream Bars though!

I found this much too sweet and would cut out the brown sugar completely and add only 3/4 c granulated sugar at the most.  There was not enough butter to make a good topping and am sorry but this was a flop.

This recipe is awesome! If you plan on taking a picture of it, that is. It smells good, looks good and tastes just terrible...lose the salt entirely, I'm thinking.

Not the best recipe, but very easy to make.  I don't know, I'm torn on this one.  I brought it to work party and about 1/3- 1/2 of the people tried it, and of those people, most of them liked it.  Aesthetically, it's not the most appetizing looking desert.  It was okay.
