I made these as cupcakes.  I cut back on the butter by 1/4 cup and back on the sugar by 3/4 cup leaving everything else the same and these turned out perfectly.  They are still a little on the sweet side for me so, I will continue to cut back on sugar to find that point that my family prefers.  Good recipe!
