This is great!  Be sure you are ready to eat it right after you make it. It melts fast. I used a food processor because a blender is not strong enough.

I was pretty skeptical of how this would turn out, but I really love it!!  It satisfied my craving for something cold and sweet (even though I left out the sugar).  I hardly even like fruits, too. I will definitely be making this again. (I used Coconut unsweetened vanilla milk)

One reviewer said it did not have the right consistency and flavor to be called ice-cream. That reviewer obviously did not use the correct tool for processing! I used a Ninja, and it turned out creamy and smooth! I used 1 Tablespoon of Splenda and doubled the vanilla and peanut butter. It was yummy! It tasted like creamy Banana-Peanut Butter ice-cream!

This needed more milk to smooth out, maybe 1/4 cup for 4 bananas. I cut back on the sugar & needed help to make this work in a blender. I did add a dash of vanilla - it really improved the flavor. Next time, I will make this with room temperature bananas and just freeze it for later.

Yum! So easy to make, and the whole family liked it. We added 2 spoonfuls of almond butter instead of peanut butter. Will definitely make again.

I would recommend using 2 scoops of peanut butter (I used a regular spoon), and slightly more vanilla extract. Not too much more. I would also note that it is more similar to a shake/smoothie than ice cream, so I would put it in a cup or glass and drink it with a straw than in a bowl with a spoon like ice cream.

I followed the recipe exactly except that the bananas were not overripe. It was pretty good, but I wouldn't really call it ice cream; both the consistency and flavor are far from it. I guess that's why the title put 'ice cream' in single quotes.

Yummy! I didn't have milk, so instead of the vanilla, sugar, and milk, I added a bit of yogurt. Topped it off with a few walnuts.

Just made this, it was creamy and made me forget any longings for real ice cream. But- I added more milk (~2 tablespoons total) and more peanut butter (also ~2 tablespoons) so it had a bit more peanuty flavor. I can't imagine it would've tasted much like peanut butter otherwise.

AWESOME!! I love this recipe b/c I don't have an icecream maker at home so it's usually hard to find such a good recipe like this one:) I added the amount of liquid needed then added a little more as I went along to get the consistency I needed. This satisfies my sweet tooth, and it's healthy!

Loved this recipe for a simple, quick and somewhat healthy dessert option.   I don't understand why some folks are saying that it turned out like a smoothie.   Mine was so thick that I had to add half and half to thin it down, maybe about 1/4 cup overall.   Otherwise it was just clumping to the sides of the blender.    I used the blender on pulse and kept pushing the mixture down to the blades and pulsing some more adding a little cream at a time.   This stuff does melt rapidly.   So you need to work quick and make sure that your bananas are well frozen to start.   The final consistency was like soft ice cream.   But, I actually made it early and put it back in the freezer.   Then I took it out about 10 to 15 minutes before eating it, and it softened to about regular ice cream consistency.   I'd suggest if you're going to eat it right away to put your bowls or cups in the freezer to chill them down first.   Maybe even chill down your blender pitcher to stop it from melting.   

I couldn't really taste the peanut butter very much.   So would probably add more next time.   I also used more vanilla as others recommended.   I topped it with diced strawberries.

Ok for a quick cool treat but like other reviews I wouldn't call it ice cream either, more like a thick smoothie but good

I only made one serving, so I used 1 banana, 1/2 tbs of peanut butter, and 1/4 tsp of milk. After I blended the ingredients I put it in the freezer for about 45 minutes. I would suggest putting it in the freezer for maybe more like 1 hr 30 min. Very good recipe!

I only gave this four stars because I made several changes. I didn't have frozen bananas so used two bananas that were overripe. Like others I used one tbsp of peanut butter, one tsp of Splenda and one tbsp of yogurt instead of milk. I used my magic bullet to whip thenput mixture in the freezer. A half hour later it was frozen but still soft. My husband is addicted to ice cream but is diabetic and found this a great substitute for ice cream. Just wished I had made a double batch!

It was amazing how much this tasted like ice cream, with a very smooth and creamy consistency. I put chocolate sauce on top and really felt like I was having a treat, not a substitute for real dessert.

This was great! I actually modified it to be a "smoothie" by adding 1/3 cup greek yogurt and 1/8 cup coconut milk. Soo good
