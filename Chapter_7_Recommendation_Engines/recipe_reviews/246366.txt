Not so sure if I agree calling this a snickers ice cream, it's missing nougat and caramel; however I did make it using the exact ingredients and found agave isn't needed unless you want something super sweet. I chose to use chocolate soy milk for a more pronounced chocolate taste. I made this in my Vitamix and it was done in less than 2 minutes (prep work included).

Well...nothing except a Snickers could taste like a Snickers, but this is a very good HEALTHY peanut butter chocolate ice cream! You will definitely need a high end blender for this. Even my Vitamix had to work really hard getting it all blended up.

I thought this was supposed to be like ice cream so I put it in the freezer.  It was flavorful but really rock hard, not creamy .

This made a very nice, healthy treat. It was a welcome change from all the frozen banana smoothie/ice creams I make all the time. I used vanilla soy milk and didn't think it was too sweet with the agave nectar. I have a Ninja blender, and this whirled up with no problems; actually, it turned out rather like a smoothie. I'm not sure if mine just mixed too powerfully or if I should have frozen it for a bit first. The only thing I'd change is to use creamy peanut butter next time and add peanuts if I want crunch. The blended peanuts weren't the best texture for me, but it was still good enough that I ate it all. :)

Snickers? I'm not sure about that but definitely a hot weather treat that's sure to please any peanut butter and chocolate fan. Shoot - It doesn't have to be warm weather to enjoy this. Great flavor. It was difficult to blend, even in the Vitamix using crushed ice to start with. I added a bit more carob than called for (think I doubled it) because the 1 tsp called for didn't give it enough flavor for me. I am not a vegan so I subbed honey and I also had cashew milk on hand. I don't buy soy. Easily adaptable. Great treat!
