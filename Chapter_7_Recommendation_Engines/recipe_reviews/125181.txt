I needed an easy potato dish like this but didn't have any onion soup mix so I used some sliced onion (about half a medium one) and Lawry's seasoned salt. Love it!

I've been making these for years, I bake uncovered and stir twice while cooking.  They're also excellent wrapped in foil and cooked on the BBQ.  My kids love the "little crunchy things" so much, I often dice an onion and add in order to have more "crunchy things"-- Don't tell them it's onions!

Not bad, but I'm just not that crazy about the onion soup mix. I used olive oil vs. veg. oil and lined my pan with foil. I baked these at 400 and turned them a few times during cooking. I don't think I'd make these again though....

I made this with a packet of Ranch soup mix instead of onion soup and we loved them.  I broiled them at the end for about 10 min. to get them to brown and threw a little shredded parmeson on top too.

We loved these easy to make potatoes!  Substituted 1/3 cup vegetable broth for the oil for a healthier alternative and they turned out great.

Great potatoes!  Just like with all the other oven roasted potatoes I've made recently they are great lukewarm.  I have a hard time putting the leftovers in the fridge, I just stand there and eat them.  Oh well.  I did change up the baking instructions.  I baked them at 375 in a shallow foil-lined pan, uncovered for about 35 minutes, tossing once or twice.

Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. This was good. but not my favorite way to make potatoes. Don't think I will try it again.

I had these last week at my monthly Book Club. After one bite all I could "discuss" was these delicious potatoes. My book club friend was kind enough to give me the recipe. Funny thing is; she directed me to AR.... something I'm usually doing. These are just about the easiest and tastiest potatoes going. If I could, I'd give this recipe 10 Stars!

I have been making these potatoes for years!  Just saw the recipe on here though so I made them again to add a picture!  I used VERY small red potatoes so I just left them whole.  Very tasty and easy!!!

Have made this multiple times, always turns out great. I would definitely cook uncovered, as it took longer than stated time to cook covered.

The flavor was terrific. I used EVOO instead of regular vegetable oil. My potatoes did take an hour to cook, but I think that's because I cut them thicker than 1/2. I cut them into chunks rather than slicing them. I recommend that when you cook them uncovered for the last bit, that you turn up the heat to really roast them and get them crisp on the outside. Great, easy recipe!

This is one of my favorite side dish recipes - it goes great with sloppy joes, smoked sausage, or hamburgers to name a few.  This is a great base recipe that I've been using for quite a few years - recently I started sprinkling a little garlic powder, a little bit of seasoning salt & some pepper along with the onion soup mix before mixing in the oil.  I dice the potatoes and add in about 4-5 carrots cut about the same size as the potatoes... so yummy, and the carrots go so well with this I won't make this recipe without them anymore!  This recipe is pretty versatile - make it as is and it is so tasty, add in some additional spices you like and the carrots and this is FANTASTIC!

These potatoes were very good.  My husband and 3 year old loved them.  I had to cook them about 10 minutes longer than the directions, but otherwise they were delicious.

Very yummy and so easy too. ! As others suggested, bake at a higher temperature if you like them crispier. I made the recipe as is since it was my first attempt, and even though the potatoes were soft, everyone still loved them and all were eaten. So, crispy or not. these are delicious.

I have made these for years.  My version is to peel and cut baking potatoes into strips like French fries , coat them with olive oil and the soup mixture and bake them in a 400 degree oven uncovered.  I give them a toss when half-way done.  Test one and determine if done to your likeness.

I've been making this Lipton recipe for years.  I use whatever potatoes I have on hand.  If I end up using more than 2 lbs of potatoes I just add some dry minced onion to the bag to add to the onion flavor without needing to add more soup mix, but I usually double the recipe anyway because we like to have leftovers in the morning to have with eggs for breakfast.  I also bake them on a large baking stone for extra crispiness.  These are very tasty and always a big hit!

These are the same potatoes my mom used to make for us, and now I make for my family! I use whatever potatoes I have on hand, usually Russets. And I add a few shakes of Italian seasoning before I bake them uncovered. I've made many different types of poatoes and ALWAYS come back to these!

These were great! I should have greased my pan, since I didn't stir them while baking, and they ended up stuck like glue but the flavor was very good. I had another dish going at the same time so I had to adjust the cooking time but that wasn't a problem.

I adore these potatoes! I just made them tonight...in fact I'm munching on them as I type.Huge hit with the family. I added a thinly sliced onion w/ mine as well. Cooked at 350 for 45 min. Then for 20 min at 400. Stirring every 10 minutes once increased temp. YUMMY!

This is one of those great recipes that tastes great and looks impressive for little effort. I find using regular russet potatos peeled and chopped tastes great too. (I'm sure any potato would do depending on what you like or have on hand)I found that this recipe called for a bit too much oil. Usually I like to add enough oil that all the potatos are lightly covered in the oil/onion mixture. Definitely a keeper.

Thanks for this easy recipe. I did not follow this recipe exactly.  I added two onions sliced to the mixture. I think I will cut out at least 5 minutes of baking.  The potatoes were nice and soft, but my husband likes his potatoes a little harder.  The taste was fabulous.

Have been making these for years, also does very well on the barbecue wrapped in tin foil. Sometimes I add a twist to them when barbecuing and top them with grated cheese---yummy!

These were fabulous!  My husband loved them too.  I used only 1/2 the oil called for to save calories and I covered them for 10 minutes, then the rest of the time uncovered.  Perfect!!

My husband does not like mashed potatoes so I needed a potatoe dish for him for Thanksgiving this one was a big hit I used olive oil instead of vegitable oil for more flavor and finely chopped up green pepper and red pepper for extra flavor and color the mashed potatoes were barely touched everyone was going for the roasted potatoes.

These were SO good!  I made them alongside BBQ chicken for dinner last night and they were excellent!  I used about 1.5 lbs of potatoes, a couple TBSP of canola oil and a package of onion soup mix.  I grilled them on the BBQ in a foil packet for about 35 minutes; the end result was very good!

Very tasty, roasted potatoes don't get much easier than this recipe! I did use 5 pounds of potatoes and doubled the oil and soup packet, this turned out really good. You may also use the mushroom and onion soup packet, or the garlic and herb. Very good and quick to put together. Thanks :)

Took to Schaeffer's - they all loved them - use Knorr's French Onion Soup Mix packet and put on middle to top rack of oven.  Line pan with aluminum foil.  May also use olive oil.

This was great, easy, not messy and a do over for any occassion.  I made with onion soup mix and then again with beefy onion soup mix.  I did use all the suop mix when baking for a bold flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

these were kinda disappointing. I used russet potatoes instead of red, and it took them about 75-80 minutes instead of 50. the end result was good but not great. probably wouldn't make again.

Update: 5 years later, I tried red potatoes, olive oil, and onion soup mix, and did 450 for 30 minutes and it turned out well.

Lots of compliments from my guests. They need to be real crispy though. Be careful they aren't coverd too long while baking. They will get soggy. Very tasty and super easy though!!

I used the Dry Onion Soup Mix recipe from this site in lieu of the pre-packaged mix.  I lined my pan with foil to make clean up a breeze.  I used a large bowl with a lid, in lieu of a plastic bag for mixing.  I offered salt and pepper at the table, which was needed perhaps because I used the homemade onion soup mix.   This is a great simple recipe with nice flavor.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Schelby Thompson!

Nothing special. We actually prefer our regular roasted potatoes - olive oil, fresh garlic, salt & pepper.

Perfect for a brunch.  I didn't use any oil, and I chopped the potatoes into cubes.  They baked perfectly and nobody knew they were so simple.

This recipe was a good and easy recipe to follow, but I did follow the suggestions made in a few other reviews.  I baked the potatoes at 350 for 35 min and then the additional 15 min; however, they potoatoes still were not fully cooked.  I put them back in the oven for a second round of 15 minutes and then broiled them for 8 minutes. I also added salt, pepper and parmesan cheese before broiling them because otherwise the recipe is bland.

this was a huge hit with my husband and I!  LOVED IT!  I halved my mini-reds and as per a previous reviewer's suggestion, put it in the oven for 40 minutes at 350F, stirring them halfway, and then upped the temp to 400F for another 10-15 minutes.  They came out perfectly!

Easy and delicious way to prepare potatoes.  I only had half a packet of onion soup so I added a small packet of dry mushroom soup and the flavor was great.  I might try this with lots of different soup mixes!

These potatoes are easy and a nice compliment to many main dishes.  I put the diced potatoes into a large bowl, stir the dry mix to coat the potato pieces evenly, then add olive oil.  I never cover them. Give them a stir about 1/2 way through the cooking process.  I cook them for about 50 min. My family likes them a little crunchy yet they are still soft in the middle.  Enjoy!

I have been making potatoes like this for years. The only addition is about a tablespoon of Dijon Mustard. Adds a little zip. Also bake at 375 as you get a little crisper finish. Always get compliments on this recipe.

These were pretty good, but not anything extremely special. Will probably make again, but just for a mix up from the usual. Not because they were exceptional.

I tried this expecting something more flavorful, however, it was a disappointment.  Very bland tasting.  They really didn't get crispy but were cooked perfectly.  Won't try again.

These turned out great.  I used evoo and onion soup mix.  I then followed the directions.  Since I used white potatoes instead of red, I may have needed to let them brown a bit longer but I didn't want the onion pieces to burn.  It was a good change of pace from mashed.

I tried to make this recipe in the crock pot because I was short on oven space.  It didn't work.  It made the potatoes mushy.  We even tried putting them in the oven after everything else was done to see if it would "crisp them up" & it didn't help.  They tasted okay, but did not look good.  Might try again, only this time, I will cook in the oven!

Very simple, I covered mines with AL foil so that they wouldn't be so hard. Then I took the foil off for about 10 minutes so that the potatoes could get a little crispy.  Other than that, my family enjoyed them

I cut these potatoes smaller than 1/2 inch and it took well over an hour to cook them through.  I also thought this needed more spices.
