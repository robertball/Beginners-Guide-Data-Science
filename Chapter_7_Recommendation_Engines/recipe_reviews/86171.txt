YUCK...The sauce was so thick, I could have spackled the wall with it!!!  1/2 cup of flour was just way too much. Cardboard has better flavor. I tried to follow the recipe, but in the end couldnt save it. What a waste of ingredients!

It was pretty easy to make since it used common ingredients.  I had no tomato paste, so I used a half a 16-oz can of Italian-seasoned diced tomatoes, which added flavor to the sauce.

Everyone enjoyed this.  The sauce was very thick,, but I added a lot more, a lot more, homemade stock.  I also added some chopped coriander at the end.  Next time, I will only use a tablespoon of flour.

I thought this was very tasty.  Only thing I did differently than recipe was to cook the onions and garlic in the oil for the sauce rather than with the chicken.  Was afraid it would burn while browning the chicken.  Only thing I thought it needed was some salt and pepper.. I used dried rosemary
