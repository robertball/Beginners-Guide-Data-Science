I thought I would try this as I had the green tomatoes and all the other needed ingredients on hand. I used to have an old recipe however I lost it many years ago so I looked to find a comparable one. The spices and ingredients  are standard for other spice cakes. I really doubted the recipe when I stirred and folded it into my cake pan. It was quite thick. I thought the moisture from the tomatoes would improve it. The cake baked up in 45 minutes. The  color was pale and unattractive. I was going to add walnuts however  forgot and I am glad I didnt because it would have been drier. The texture was gummy and  chewy. It did have a good flavor warm.  I  do not expect it to be ate by my sugar toothed husband.
