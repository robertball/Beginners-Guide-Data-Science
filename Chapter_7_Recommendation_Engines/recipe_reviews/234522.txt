Made for Recipe Group. Really good flavor on the sauce. I used Heinz chili sauce. I covered the pan while cooking although the recipe doesn't say covered or uncovered. I think next time I would drain the juices off when I add the sauce and then cook uncovered the last 30 minutes or so. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this for Recipe Group...I liked it, but I think the cooking time for the ribs were off...they came out pretty dry. Hubby wasn't big on the sauce, but me and the little guy thought it was great! In fact, I thought this sauce would be great over cocktail meatballs for an appy, which is what I may try next time. All in all, it was tasty, but do keep check on the ribs, so they don't overcook like mine did. Thanks for sharing. :)

The sauce for this recipe is really good, but is fairly spicy and I only used about a 1/4 cup Sriracha for chili sauce and ketchup for the rest.  I put mustard on a second batch of ribs for the first hour of baking, and actually liked this batch more.  

Also note, since the sauce isn't added until the last hour, you can make the sauce after you put the ribs in the oven, no need to wait if you're running a little short on time.

I give this 4 1/2 stars.  I think the sauce is awesome!  Deduction of half a star for it needing to be cooked probably another hour to get fall apart tender.  It was a little tougher than we would have liked.  Other than that this was fantastic!

This was delicious my entire family loved it. Note: Chili sauce is not spicy. Heinz chili sauce comes in a glass bottle like their cocktail sauce. It is a thicker slightly sweeter ketchup type sauce. Substituting sriracha and ketchup doesn't come close to what this is supposed to taste like.

Recipe Group: The whole family enjoyed these ribs! I convect roasted, covered, for an hour at 325 while I let the sauce simmer. I ran out of chili sauce so I added a bit of ketchup, then realized we didn't have any beer so I subbed root beer :) Then I poured the sauce over the ribs and covered again, roasted for 30 minutes then took off the cover and went another five minutes to glaze the top a bit. Falling off the bone and tasty, thanks for sharing the recipe!

This recipe was super easy and super tasty!!!!! My husband loved it to the point that he wanted me to freeze the extra sauce for later! Unfortunately I had no ribs but substituted boneless pork chops. I hard seared the chops on the stove then topped with the reduced sauce and baked them for just an hour. Would definitely make this again!

Good basic recipe. I added a few sprinkles of chili powder. For me , I wish I had increased the sauce amount about 1.5 times. Also, cooking time can be reduced 10 min or so, use a meat thermometer to verify. My first try was a little dry at 2 hours in a 342 degrees convection oven set to bake.

I liked it. It needed to cook longer. I made it with the sririchi and ketchup.  Had a definite tang. Much better the next day when I made it into bbq sandwiches

Good!  Needed more sauce and maybe not put it on till the last half hour of cooking.

Had to wing this one a bit. I had boneless country ribs so I had to adjust the cooking time. Did it by feel. Cooked for 45 minutes at 350 degrees. Checked with a thermometer and they were done. Covered with sauce, turned  heat up to 375 and let them go another 25 minutes. To my suprise , they came out still juicy and wonderful. My spouse loved them that night and for lunch on another day. Will definitely use this recipe again- next time with bone-in ribs. You can play with the sauce. We like a little heat so added cayenne and a splash of Worcestershire sauce. I also grabbed the tip from one review about using prepared mustard on the meat before it went in the oven. Glad I did.

Didnâ€™t really follow the recipe but was close.  Will try again, follow for more taste, drain some fat before adding sauce with the hope ribs will crisper up a bit more.

I thought I followed the recipe as written but must have missed something, because the meat was really, really dry. My family was too polite to complain, but no one had seconds. The sauce burned to a gummy paste on the bottom of the pan. I'll try a different recipe next time.

Recipe Group Selection:  27, December 2014 ~ My husband and I really enjoyed this New Year's Day dinner.  I purchased a 2 lb. package of boneless country ribs, so I halved the sauce recipe.  The sauce thicken nicely and added a nice flavor to the ribs.  I added sauerkraut and potatoes to the pan when baking the ribs.  Also served, 'Pumpkin Cornbread' and 'Classic Texas Caviar' both from AR.  It was a wonderful "good luck" new years meal.
