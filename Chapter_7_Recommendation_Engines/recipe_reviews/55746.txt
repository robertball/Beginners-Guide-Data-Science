DROOL!! This was such a good dessert! The only thing that I did wrong was add too much vanilla to the whipped cream, it was double strength vanilla and I did not see that until it was too late. And I also used Frozen strawberries. But It still turned out excellent! I would suggest to follow the recipe as is, it was wonderful with frozen strawberries, but I am sure it would be heavenly with fresh ones! Good luck and I hope you enjoy this one as much as our family did!

This was a great recipe!  I made it when my future in-laws came to visit, and my fiance's dad, who is quite the baker, said it was the "best strawberry shortcake" he's ever had!  I'll definetally make it again.  I made it the night before which made assembly easy.  I would use more strawberries and whip cream next time, as we used all of them for 4 of us.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

We made this last night and it was delicious!  I loved the recipe for the biscuits and will never go back!  The only change we made was that we used whipped cream from the can instead of making it.  I think vanilla ice cream was be a great addition, as other reviewers mentioned.

I only made the shortcake and strawberries part of the recipe and used vanilla ice cream instead of whipped cream.  Absolutely delicious and will be the only strawberry shortcake I make from now on.  I used fat free half and half since that's all I had at home and it still worked fine.  You could probably use milk as well to replace the cream in the bread.

The shortcakes really do melt in your mouth!  This is such a great recipe.  I pretty followed it exactly, except that I macerated the strawberries in a little triple sec along with the sugar.  All my friends loved this dessert!

It's amazing how something so quick and so easy
can taste soooo good!  Since fresh strawberries
aren't always available, I substitute thawed
frozen strawberries in syrup.

I made this recipe and it was an instant hit with my wife.  The only change I made was that I spooned soft-serve vanilla ice cream between the sliced shortcake along with the strawberries then topped the whole dessert with the whipped cream and more strawberries.  Very decadent and delicious!

This was pretty good.  I wouldn't call it "melt-a-way", it was more your typical good shortcake.  I was hoping for something a little more cakelike, and not the regular biscuit kind.  Oh well, family and friends liked it well enough.

I'm a pastry chef and tried this new shortbread recipe. Good. Simple to make.  Stored well for next day use.  Try making berries the day before. Add 1.5oz of Chambord to berries. I've made this with frozen raspberries and blueberries when fresh berries are out of season. Mix strawberries with powdered sugar for a less grainy mix.  Add some sweetened whipped cream on top for that perfect touch!  Yum!

I GIVE UP! i tried making these shortcake 4 times already, but it keeps coming out horrible. NOt sure if they are supposed to be hard as a rock, but mine were. Plus there are so many different kinds of whip creams out there, which whipping cream are u supposed to use? i used whip cream in the tall can, cool whip in the plastic box AND whipping cream in the dairy section in the milk carton...with the first 2 they came out hard and with the whipping cream, the cakes were so sticky i couldnt even knead the dough! I dunno what im doing wrong, can someone let me know? :(

This recipe is great.  I added a little vanilla to the shortbread and strawberries.  The shortbread came out soft and biscuit-y after 20 minutes.  Everyone wanted to eat the shortbread before the strawberries and cream were even added.

These were great!  I substituted milk for the whipping cream when making the shortcakes.  I'll probably use Cool Whip next time in place of the cream.

I've always had strawberry shortcake for my late-May birthday, and this recipe made it one of the best. I used about 30% whole wheat flour and it was wonderful! Guests at my party were from the South and said it was done "the right way."
