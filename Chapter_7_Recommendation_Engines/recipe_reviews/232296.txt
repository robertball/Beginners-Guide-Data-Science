Not bad.  I didn't have pockets in my pita, so I just made it an open faced sandwich and toasted it all at the end since I prefer not to melt cheese in the microwave.  Since the recipe is just for one and I decided I wanted tuna salad for later, I basically quadrupled this recipe.  I like the addition of rosemary but am on the fence about the olive oil--not sure I'm a fan, but I'm glad I tried it as is.  I have never tried tuna salad with olive oil.  Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out great! The only change I made was that I put it in the oven instead of the microwave. I preferred to be golden brown and crispy.

Awesomely tasty and so easy! I had small pitas (6 in.) so it actually made 2 servings. I also used some lettuce as garnish. Will definitely make again!

I would agree. Next time I would skip olive oil and just go with mayo. I did like the rosemary.
