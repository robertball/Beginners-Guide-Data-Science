Wow, this was great soup!  Only two tweaks:  I used hot Italian turkey sausage and cremini mushrooms.  Everything else stayed the same.  The soup had great flavor from the sausage, and just enough heat to make the soup taste well-seasoned.  Rich and satisfying on its own for lunch, or for dinner with a salad and some crusty bread,  this recipe is a keeper!

Warning, this soup depends a lot on what sausage you use - I already wrote a review but after making this soup a couple of times, I've discovered this issue. The first time I made it, it was absolutely amazing. The second time, I used a different brand of sausage and drained off a lot of the sausage grease and it was not nearly as good. So if you make it and aren't impressed, you may want to try a different meat before you give up on it entirely.

OMG, delicious! Great method! I used half a Spanish chorizo, casing removed and diced, and two chicken mango sausages (what I had on hand). After the onion, carrot and garlic were cooked, I added a 10 oz bag of TJ's Organic Tuscan kale (remove spines first) and sauteed for a minute or two. Then only a quart of fat free chicken broth and added a can of Great Northern beans (not drained) and about 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes along with the oregano. Brought to a boil, then simmered about one hour. Yum!  I omitted the bay leaf, cauliflower and mushrooms. It did not need them, but I might try next time. There will definitely be a next time!

Made without the mushrooms and it was wonderful - even my 6 year old ate it.  Used spicy sausage as suggested.  Once I cooked it on the stovetop I needed 2 hours before serving, so I put it on low in the slow cooker.  Vegetables were still nicely crispy.

This was terrific—I had everything on hand and made it exactly as posted. We served it with garlic bread and all five of us loved it. To make it a bit more hearty in colder weather, I think I'd consider thickening the broth with corn starch or adding [asta for a more substantial meal. But I'll make this again just the way it is.

Have made this soup several times and its always a hit!  We definitely prefer hot sausage, but have used sweet sausage with some added spices.  The only thing I do different is remove the sausage from their casing and cook that way.  I find it goes a little farther that way and is in better size portions.

I did a recipe search with ingredients I had on hand and this soup turned up.  I had chicken spinach asiago sausage, (a bit spicy), and it worked wonderfully!  I was only missing the cauliflower so substituted red skin potatoes.  My family really enjoyed it, also.

I cooked this soup in a pressure cooker. Along with all of the ingredients, I used Italian sweet sausage links, sliced them, then threw them straight into the pressure cooker. I cooked the soup  for 35 minutes on the “soup” settingMy husband hates kale and he enjoyed this soup. I’d totally make this again!

I tweaked this soup a bit because I’m not a fan of mushrooms and I used vegan sausage. I replaced the cauliflower and mushrooms with zucchini and eggplant (honestly the cauliflower just wouldnt fit in my pot! lol). Holy , it was amazing. The fact that you only put one seasoning in and it tastes so yummy is the best part. so hearty & full of veggies while also being filling and satisfying.

This soup was excellent! Being sick, I needed something easy and light to make and this recipe hot the spot for me. I opted for sweet Italian turkey sausage, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I didn't have kale and used spinach. The flavors really meld well and the sausage lends a perfect flavor in the  broth. Served with baked baguette slices. Comforting soup I'll definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe!

This soup was really tasty and healthy, will definitely make again (probably soon since I have a lot of unused kale and cauliflower). The only change I made was using mild Italian turkey ground sausage from Publix Greenwise. It gave great flavor in every bite. Otherwise I followed recipe exactly. As with all soups I made it early in the day so flavors could mature before supper time.

I made this just as the recipe called for and my husband loved it.  I am happy if he loves what I cook, by the way I loved it also, going to make it again tonight.  I use mild Italian sausage I think spicy Italian sausage would be good too.

Loved this recipe.  The two things I did above this recipe was to us Italian chicken sausage and I put about a 1/2 cup of noodles in at the last.  Very good.  Lots of flavor.

We had leftover cooked bratwurst and some broccoli so we added it to the mix.  It was so tasty and hearty and good and we ate it for days without getting tired of it!!  Yummy!

I followed the recipe to a T. It was delicious! The Italian sausage adds the perfect amount of flavor. Pretty easy to prepare as well. My boyfriend loved it, and I was able to sneak some healthy veggies into him ;) I will definitely be making this more often.

This was delicious! I used Russian purple kale, and purple carrots.  I added some Canadian bacon, as I didn't have as much sausage on hand.  I also substituted leeks for the onions, and I added asparagus and Brussel sprouts as well instead of mushrooms.  At the end, I finished it with a little parmesan and fresh basil.  It was hearty, veggie-ful, and scrumptious.  I will definitely make this again!

I did make a couple of minor changes to make this healthier. I used Italian turkey sausage to cut down on the fat and low sodium chicken broth to cut down on the sodium. Other than that, the only difference was to add more garlic because we always add more garlic to everything. I did use spinach instead of kale because that's what I had in the house. The garlic is really the only thing that would affect the flavor at all, so I feel comfortable giving this recipe 5 stars. It really was delicious and other than the prep work (which is typical for most recipes, was easy to put together. I used my pressure cooker, but it really isn't necessary if you don't have one. I love making homemade soup during the cold winter months. I will definitely be making this again.

This soup was delicious. I am on the dukan diet and it complies with the rules on protein vegetable days. To make it work with the diet I used  Italian chicken sausage and nonfat reduced sodium broth.. Everything else was the same and it still tasted great even without the mushrooms because I didn't have any

I liked this very much! So did my 12 & 2 y.o. Children! Only adjustments I made was: Tofurkey Sausage (because we are vegetarians); more garlic (because we love garlic); more kale and I topped mine with powdered chili pepper and cheese after I served in my bowl! Soooo good... Going for second now!

Didn't have mushrooms. Added a can of chunky tomatoes, Thought it was bland. Probably better with spicier sausage. Most soups need more cooking time. That might also help

I used sundries tomato and kale sausage and used a little more of each vegetable than what it called for. This soup is really salty with no added salt, but still very flavorful and filling! !
