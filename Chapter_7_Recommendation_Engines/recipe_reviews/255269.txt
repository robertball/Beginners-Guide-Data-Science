Great basic recipe for tortilla soup! I didn’t have bacon, but it was delicious nonetheless. I added extra chipotle peppers because we like spicy food. Thank you for sharing your recipe, it’s easy & delicious!

Watch those Chipotle peppers. 
I would add some rice to tame it a bit and maybe some cabbage.
